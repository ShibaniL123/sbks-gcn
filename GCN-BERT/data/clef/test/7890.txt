FIELD Systems for treating a denatured nerve to reduce pain due to neuritis are provided. More particularly, treatment systems comprising a press for applying a compressive force to a nerve to physically block axon regrowth are provided. BACKGROUND Acute and chronic pain management has been a concern for as long as medicine has been practiced. Several methods of inducing analgesia and anesthesia have been developed. For example, the use of chemical substances is perhaps the most common approach to pain relief which requires suitable substances that are effective, safe to humans, and do not cause complications or abnormal reactions. Despite advances that have been made in the field of anesthesiology, and in the field of pain relief in general, there are still some drawbacks to chemical-based approaches. For instance, the anesthetics generally available today must be administered in carefully graduated doses to assure the patient's well-being, require extended periods of fasting prior to treatment, and are often accompanied by undesirable after effects such as nausea. One alternative to anesthetics that is commonly used for providing pain relief is ablation in which nerves and/or tissue is removed and/or destroyed. Ablation procedures can use either cold or hot ablation procedures and techniques. Various categories of ablation include but are not limited to electrical, radiation, light, radiofrequency, ultrasound, cryotherapy, thermal, microwave and hydromechanical. One form of hot ablation is radiofrequency ablation. During radiofrequency (RF) ablation, current passing through tissue from the active electrode leads to ion agitation, which is converted by means of friction into heat. The process of cellular heating includes almost immediate and irreparable cellular damage, which leads to coagulation necrosis. Because ion agitation, and thus tissue heating, is greatest in areas of highest current density (e.g., closest to the active electrode tip), necrosis is limited to a relatively small volume of tissue surrounding the RF electrode. Another form of ablation uses cold ablation and is sometimes called cryoablation. During cryoablation, tissue is frozen or rapid freeze/thaw cycles are inflicted upon the tissue. Cryoablation allows treatment mapping pre and post procedure where areas of tissue can be mapped by limited, reversible and/or freezing. Cryoablation can be monitored and visualized on ultrasonography, CT and MRI. Currently available nerve ablation devices and techniques leave nerve sheaths intact allowing for nerve axons to regrow across damaged tissue and restore sensory and motor function. The speed at which this regeneration occurs depends upon the method and duration of the procedure used. This restoration of sensory and motor function can occur as quickly as a few weeks to a few months. Therefore, the nerve ablation procedure needs to be repeated over and over to reduce pain symptoms that re-occur. The use of nerve ablation devices may result in neuritis, inflammation of nerve tissue, or creation of nerve clusters, such as, for example, nerve balls. Such pain may recur in patients as many times as the nerve ablation procedure is repeated. Once a nerve is damaged or denatured, affected nerve tissue locally releases various cytokines such as nerve growth factor (NGF). NGF is essential in promoting the growth and survival of the nervous system. Once NGF is released, nerve regrowth begins in the form of damaged tissue being repaired and new nerve fibers and branches being formed. If left unchecked, the newly grown nerve tissue may grow back into a problematic portion of tissue in a patient or into a nerve ball. Accordingly, there is a need for systems to physically block axon regrowth by positioning a device at predetermined locations along a denatured nerve to apply compressive force to the nerve. Application of such a compressive force prevents the transmission of NGF to damaged or denatured nerve tissue, and thus, prevents regrowth of nerve tissue. Further, there is a need for devices and methods that provide mechanical blocking capabilities of nerve and/or soft tissue. Devices and methods that assist in the control of neuritis in a tissue being treated are also needed. SUMMARY In one embodiment, a surgical implant for blocking neural regrowth following a surgical procedure is provided. The implant comprises a press having a first portion and a second portion. The second portion is movable with respect to the first portion. The first and second portions each have an inner surface configured to engage tissue, such as, for example, a denatured nerve. In one embodiment, a method for surgically treating pain in a patient is provided. The method comprises the step of ablating a nerve at a surgical site with an ablation probe so as to denature at least a portion of the nerve. A clip is then implanted onto the denatured portion of the nerve in order to apply a compressive force sufficient to prevent nerve growth while leaving a nerve sheath of the nerve intact. In one embodiment, a surgical implant for blocking neural regrowth following a surgical procedure is provided. The surgical implant comprises a press, such as, for example a clip or clip, having a first portion and a second portion. The first portion is coupled to the second portion by a hinge such that the second portion is moveable relative to the first portion. The first and second portions each have an inner surface configured to engage a nerve. In some embodiments, at least a portion of the clip is coated with a non-conductive polymer. In some embodiments, a surgical tool is configured to move the clip between a first orientation in which the first portion is separated from the second portion by a first distance and a second orientation in which the first portion is separated from the second portion by a second distance, the second distance being less than the first distance. In some embodiments, the first portion comprises a locking mechanism configured to maintain the clip in the second orientation.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION Devices for preventing the regrowth of nerves for the treatment of pain are disclosed. Specifically, the disclosed devices include a mechanical device configured to place a compressive force on a denatured nerve to prevent nerve growth. The following description is presented to enable any person skilled in the art to make and use the present disclosure. Descriptions of specific embodiments and applications are provided only as examples and various modifications will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art. In one embodiment, a novel device and methods of use for blocking regrowth of nerve tissue comprising a press, such as, for example, a clamp or clip, is provided. The described device and method of using the device eliminates the need for repeat nerve ablations on the same nerve by physically blocking axon regrowth. The clip is a ligation or small cliping device that applies a compressive force on a portion of a nerve so as to pinch the selected portion of the damaged nerve closed. Various designs of this clip are possible. In one embodiment, a two-step procedure for using the disclosed clip is presented. First, nerve ablation is conducted using an RF, Cryo or related probe. Once the nerve is ablated, a mechanical device is applied to the denatured portion of the nerve to block axon regrowth across this section of nerve. This mechanical device is physically applied to the nerve segment so as to reduce and/or close the internal space of the nerve sheath, thereby blocking the path for the axons proximal to the ablation to reach the distal potion of the nerve. The clip also prevents a distal nerve from sending chemical signals across the blocked path to the proximal nerve so as to prevent regrowth of the nerve that could typically occur without a physical blockage. The process of destroying the nerve fibers in this area first with ablation will also eliminate any pain sensation due to the mechanical device. The other advantage of this device is that by leaving the nerve sheath intact (i.e., no disruptions in wall) nerve fibers are prevented from growing outside the blocked portion and causing painful neuritis. In one embodiment, the clip is placed under direct visualization of the ablated nerve using a minimally invasive cannula and/or endoscope. Alternatively, the clip is placed using a percutaneous procedure by sliding an instrument within or over the introducer needle that was used to perform the nerve RF or Cryoablation procedure. In various embodiments, the clip can be a plastic band, inflatable balloon, metal clip or clip, or shape memory clip. In other embodiments, the clip is spring loaded or mechanically deformed once in place over the nerve. In one embodiment, the clip is tied in place onto the nerve through a tightening of a band. Additionally, the clip may be held in place through the injection of a settable material around or inside the nerve.

For example, targeted nerves may have a diameter of about 1 mm to about 2 mm, about 2 mm to about 4 mm, about 1 mm to about 5 mm, or about 0.5 mm to about 5 mm and therefore different size clips can be configured to provide the proper amount of compressive force to prevent nerve growth. In various embodiments, radiographic markers can be included on the clip to permit the user to accurately position the clip into the desired site of the patient. In this embodiment, the user may accurately position the clip in the site using any of the numerous diagnostic imaging procedures. Such diagnostic imaging procedures include, for example, X-ray imaging or fluoroscopy. Additionally, visualization of the surgical site can be enhanced through the use of a surgical cannula or an endoscope. Examples of such radiographic markers include, but are not limited to, barium, calcium phosphate, and/or metal beads. For example, the radiographic marker can be ring-shaped or dispersed as small pellets throughout the clip. In various embodiments, the clip may include a transparent or translucent portion that can be visualizable by ultrasound, fluoroscopy, x-ray, or other imaging techniques. In such embodiments, the transparent or translucent portion may include a radiopaque material or ultrasound responsive topography that increases the contrast of spacer 10 relative to the absence of the material or topography. Methods of Blocking a Denatured or Damaged Nerve The present disclosure also provides for methods of blocking a nerve from regrowing after it has been denatured or damaged in a surgical procedure. In one embodiment, a method for surgically treating pain in a patient is disclosed comprising the step of ablating a nerve at a surgical site with an ablation probe to denature at least a portion of a nerve. In various embodiments, the ablation probe comprises a heating probe or a cryogenic freezing probe. The methods comprise disposing a probe at a surgical site, wherein the probe comprises an interior surface defining an internal passage and an exterior surface comprising a tip. The internal passage has a filament comprising an opening configured to heat or to cool the exterior surface of the probe to a selected temperature. The probe is positioned adjacent to a nerve and/or soft tissue at a selected location in the body of a patient so as to ablate the nerve and/or soft tissue. Once the nerve is ablated, the clip is placed on the denatured portion of nerve 32 to apply a compressive force sufficient to prevent nerve growth while leaving a nerve sheath of nerve 32 intact. As shown in FIGS. 7 and 8, the application of the compressive force also physically reduces and closes an internal space of the nerve sheath so as to block a path for axons proximal to the denatured portion of the nerve to reach a distal portion of nerve 32. Furthermore, the compressive force also prevents the distal portion of nerve 32 from sending chemical signals across the blocked path to a proximal portion of nerve 32 that is responsible for regrowth. In one embodiment, the clip is implanted onto nerve 32 through the use of an implantation tool to move the clip from a first orientation in which a first potion, such as, for example, portion 18, of the clip is separated from a second portion, such as, for example, portion 20, of the clip by a first distance and a second orientation in which the first portion is separated from the second portion by a second distance that is less than the first distance. In one embodiment, the clip is configured to be gripped by a hand of a medical practitioner to move the clip between the first and second configurations. In the first orientation, the inner surfaces of the first and second portions, such as, for example portions 18, 20, of the clip are spaced apart from one another so that the clip can be positioned onto nerve 32. Once positioned on nerve 32, the clip is moved to the second orientation such that the inner surfaces of the first and second portions engage nerve 32. In one embodiment, the inner surfaces have a frictional surface configuration for engagement with tissue to enhance fixation. In some embodiments, the inner surfaces may include alternate surface configurations, such as, for example, rough, arcuate, undulating, mesh, porous, semi-porous, dimpled and/or textured according to the requirements of a particular application. In various embodiments, the inner surfaces comprise protrusions, barbs, spikes, hooks, or tips configured to engage nerve 32. In one embodiment, the clip is resiliently biased in the second position such that once in place over nerve 32, the clip will maintain a compressive force to block regrowth of nerve 32. In one embodiment, a locking mechanism on the inner surfaces of the first and second portions is used to maintain the clip in the second orientation once the clip is positioned over nerve 32. As discussed herein, the locking mechanism 40 comprises a deformable member, such as, for, example a suture 42 disposed with first portion 18 and a rigid loop 44 disposed to second portion 20. Suture 42 locks clip 12 in place when it is tied through loop 44. Portions 18, 20 are sized such that once portions 18, 20 are moved to the second configuration over nerve 32, suture 42 and loop 44 will be disposed adjacent one another to facilitate engaging suture 42 to loop 44. In one embodiment, a settable material can be applied around or inside the nerve to hold the clip in place and/or prevent leakage of NGF. In one embodiment, locking mechanism 40 comprises a protrusion 46 disposed to the inner surface of first portion 18 and an aperture defined by second portion 20. Portions 18, 20 are sized such that once portions 18, 20 are moved to the second configuration over nerve 32, protrusion 46 and aperture 48 will be disposed adjacent one another to facilitate engaging protrusion 46 to aperture 48. Protrusion 46 is configured to snap into aperture 48 when portion 20 is rotated such that protrusion 46 comes into contact with aperture 48. In some embodiments, the user may accurately position the clip in the site using any of the numerous diagnostic imaging procedures. Such diagnostic imaging procedures include, for example, X-ray imaging or fluoroscopy. Additionally, visualization of the surgical site can be enhanced through the use of a surgical cannula or an endoscope. In various embodiments, the clip may include a transparent or translucent portion that can be visualizable by ultrasound, fluoroscopy, x-ray, or other imaging techniques. In such embodiments, the transparent or translucent portion may include a radiopaque material or ultrasound responsive topography that increases the contrast of spacer 10 relative to the absence of the material or topography. In various embodiments, kits are provided that include device 10. The kits can include at least one probe, at least one clip and at least one insertion instrument. In some embodiments, the kits include different sized clips for different sized nerves. In some embodiments, the probe and/or the insertion instrument in the kits is reusable for multiple procedures after cleaning and sterilization. Specific clinical application of this instrument include destruction of nerves causing facet and discogenic back and leg pain, destruction of soft tissue causing stenosis pain symptoms, and many other orthopedic and oral maxillofacial pain. Many other painful conditions associated with arthroscopic, otolaryngological or spinal procedures that use ablation can use the devices and methods described herein. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made to various embodiments described herein without departing from the spirit or scope of the teachings herein.
