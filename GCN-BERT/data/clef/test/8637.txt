FUNCTIONALIZED PRIMARY ALKYLTRIFLUOROBORATE SALTS INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE TO ANY PRIORITY APPLICATIONS [0001] This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/949,056, filed March 6, 2014. The contents of the Provisional Patent Application are incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. BACKGROUND [0002] Boronic acids, trif!uoroborate salts and the corresponding N- methylimidoacetate (MIDA) complexes are used as synthetic intermediates for the synthesis of complex molecules using the Suzuki-Miyaura palladium catalyzed cross-coupling reaction. This reaction is used extensively in biomedical and pharmaceutical research. While a large number of aryl, heteroaryl and vi y] boronic compounds are readily available, only a few alkyl and fewer still functionalize alkylboronic derivatives are available. [0003] There are few methods that can be used to directly prepare boronic derivatives via hydroboration. These methods either used the strongly Lewis acidic haloboranes, HBX2 or the very sluggish catecho!borane or pinacolborane. In both cases, these reagents reduce many functional groups. In general, dialkylborane are somewhat less reaction towards reduction and more selective in hydro borations readily forming the mixed borane, R2BR'. However, are very fe methods that allow a selective removal of the two alkyl groups. The best known example of this reaction is the elimination of the isopinocampheyi groups using an aldehyde such as benzaldehyde or acetaldehyde to yield alpha-pinene and the boronic ester. The limitation to using the diisopinocampheylborane, Ipc2BH is significant reduction of functional groups, cost of the alpha-pinene used to prepare Ipe^BH. Also, the elimination does not always result in the formation of the desired product. [0004] The one group reductive alkylation reaction has been known since the early 1960's. One equivalent of trialkylborane, R3B, is reacted with one equivalent of p- benozoquinone in an aqueous THF solution resulting in the preferential transfer of the more substituted alky! group for the alkylhydroquinonone (reduction) and formation of a borinic acid , R2BOH. Despite a number of papers no one reported more than a one group transfer. [Ό005] What is needed is a general method to prepare functionalized primary alkyl trifiuoroborates and the corresponding boronic acids or esters without protecting and deprotecting the functional group. Such methods would expand the scope and types of compounds that can be prepared using Suzuki-Miyaura reaction. In addition, boronic acids have been demonstrated biological activities and are also used as intermediates in other important organic reactions; therefore the development of methods that avoid laborious protection and deprotection of functional groups in the preparation of boronic acids or esters would significantly aid the field of organic synthesis. SUMMARY OF THE EMBODIMENTS [0006] Some embodiments of the present application provide methods for the preparation of primary alkyl boronic acids and potassium alkyl trifiuoroboraie salts optionally containing protected and unprotected functional groups, using a two group reductive a!kylation reaction. Some embodiments are directed to various compounds prepared by these methods. [0007] in some embodiments, terminal aikenes containing unprotected functional groups (including, but not limited to, aldehydes, ketones, esters, amides and nitriles) can be cleanly hydroborated with dialkylboran.es. In some embodiments, the hydroborating reagents can be based on secondary alkyl groups. In some embodiments, such hydroborating reagents include, as examples, dicyclohexylborane, 9-borobicyclononane, disiarnylborane and diisopinoeanipheylborane. In some embodiments, the functional groups show minimal reduction and the hydroboration reactions form the primary alkyl group in excellent regioseleetivity. In some embodiments, the formed mixed borane, R?BR', can undergo a rapid two-group reductive alkylatiori with p-benzoquinone, transferring the secondary auxiliary groups in preference to the primary alkyl ones. In some embodiments, addition of potassium hydrogen difluoride converts the alkyihydroquinone ester into the corresponding potassium alkyltrifluoride salt and alkyihydroquinone. In some embodiments, the primary alkyl trifiuoroboraie salt can be isolated in excellent yields. In some embodiments, the functional groups do not show any indication of reduction and can be used without protecting groups. The salts can be converted into the corresponding alkylboronic acid or ester. [0008] Some embodiments provide methods for hydroborating a terminal alkene or a 2-alkyl alkene comprising contacting a. terminal alkene or a 2-alkyl alkene, and a dialkylborane; wherein the terminal alkene or the 2-alkyl alkene comprises an unprotected functional group, to provide a mixed trialkyl borane. In some embodiments, the mixed trialkylborane can have the formula R2BR', wherein each R is independently alkyl or cycloalkyl, each substituted or unsubstituted by ai l, or two R groups taken together form a cyclic alkyl group, bonded to the boron atom B, wherein the cyclic alkyl is substituted or unsubstituted by aryi; and R' is alkyl or alkenyl having an unprotected functional group. [0009] In some embodiments, the unprotected functional group can be, for example, an aldehyde, ketone, alkyl or aryl carboxylic ester, alkyl or aryi tertiary amide, or a nitrite. The dialkylborane can be, for example, dicyclohexylborane, 9-borobicyclononane (9- BBN), disiamylborane, or diisopinocampheylborane. [0010] In some embodiments, little or no reduction of the functional group occurs (e.g., less than about 10%, less than about 5%, less than about 2%, or less than about 1%, with respect to the initial terminal alkene or a 2-alkyl alkene compound) in the hydroboration. The hydroboration product was prepared with excellent regioselectivity.

[ΘΘ47] The present application thus provides novel compounds prepared by the methods described herein, intermediates for the synthesis of the compounds described herein, as well as methods of preparing the compounds described herein. The invention also provides compounds as described herein that are useful as intermediates for the synthesis of other useful compounds. DETAILED DESCRIPTION [ΘΘ48] Primary alkylboronic acids and esters and corresponding potassium alkyltrifluoroborate salts are readily prepared by the rrydroboration of terminal alkenes and terminal alkynes containing unprotected and protected functional groups using dialkylboranes, such as dicyclohexylborane, 9-BBN, disiamy!borane and diisopinocampheylborane. The unprotected functional groups include, but are not limited to, aldehydes, ketones, carboylic esters and amides in addition to nitriles. There is little, if any, reduction of the functional group and these borane hydro borating reagents show good to excellent regioselectivity forming the primary alkyl group. [0049] The resultant mixed alkylborane can undergo a facile two group reductive alkylation with an α,β unsaturated carbonyl compound, for example, p-benzoquinone. This transfers the secondary alkyl groups, forming a functionalized primary alkylboronic ester of the corresponding alkylhydroquinone. This ester can be converted into the corresponding potassium alkyltrifluoroborate salt. The yields from the hydroboration of the alkene to the trifluoro borate salt are often at least 80% and can be has high as 99%. In one embodiment, this is the first method to prepare functionalized boronic acids or these derivatives without protecting and deprotecting the functional group. These compounds can be used in widely used coupling reactions, such as the Suzuki-Miyaura reaction. [ΘΘ50] The present application is also directed, in part, to the two-group reductive alkylation with trialkylboranes using α,β-un saturated carbonyl compounds. The migratory aptitude for this reaction has the more substituted alkyl groups, that is, 3° > 2° > 1 ° carbons bound to the boron atom transferring faster to form the corresponding alkylated carbonyl compound. [0051] The two-group migration allows one to remove the auxiliary secondary groups in the commonly used dialkylboranes such as 9-BBN, disiamylborane, dicyclohexylborane and diisopinocamphey!borane forming an alkoxy boronic diester or boronic acid, depending on whether the reaction is quenched with water or an alcohol. This product can then be converted into the potassium trifluoroborate salt. [0052] Primary alkyltrifiuoroborate salts and the corresponding boronic acids can thus be prepared using this two-group reductive alkylation reaction.

[0056] The term "and/or" means any one of the items, any combination of the items, or all of the items with which this term is associated. The phrase "one or more" is readily understood by one of skill in the art, particularly when read in context of its usage. For example, one or more substituents on a phenyl ring refers to one to five, or one to four, for example if the phenyl ring is disubstituted.

Any listed range can be easily recognized as sufficiently describing and enabling the same range being broken down into at least equal halves, thirds, quarters, fifths, or tenths. As a non-limiting example, each range discussed herein can be readily broken down into a lower third, middle third and upper third, etc. As will also be understood by one skilled in the art, all language such as "up to", "at least", "greater than", "less than", "more than", "or more", and the like, include the number recited and such terms refer to ranges that can be subsequently broken down into sub-ranges as discussed above. In the same manner, all ratios recited herein also include ail sub-ratios falling within the broader ratio. Accordingly, specific values recited for radicals, substituents, and ranges, are for illustration only; they do not exclude other defined values or other values within defined ranges for radicals and substituents, [0060] One skilled in the art will also readily recognize that where members are grouped together in a common manner, such as in a Markush group, the invention encompasses not only the entire group listed as a whole, but each member of the group individually and all possible subgroups of the main group. Additionally, for ail purposes, the invention encompasses not only the main group, but also the main group absent one or more of the group members. The invention therefore envisages the explicit exclusion of any one or more of members of a recited group. Accordingly, provisos may apply to any of the disclosed categories or embodiments whereby any one or more of the recited elements, species, or embodiments, may be excluded from such categories or embodiments, for example, for use in an explicit negative limitation.

Many such techniques are well known to the skilled artisan. Accordingly, many of the known techniques are elaborated in, for example.

Applications of the methods and reaction products described herein [0082] The alkylboronate esters and trifluoroborate salts generated in the reactions described herei can be readily converted to primary alcohols and to primary alkylarenes using standard synthetic transformations. The primary alkylboronate esters can also be further derivatized to provide scaffolds for combinatorial libraries. For example, boronic acids or esters can be transformed into myriad functional groups including aryl or vinyl groups via Suzuki-Miyaura couplings (Miyaura and Suzuki, Chem, Rev. 95: 2457-2483 (1995); Suzuki, J. Organomet. Chem, 576: 147-168 (1999); Miyaura, In Advances in Metal- Organic Chemistry, Liebeskind, Ed.: JAI: London, Vol. 6, pp. 187-243 (1998); see also Metal-catalyzed Cross-coupling Reactions; Diederich and Stang, Eds.: Wiley; Wienheim, 1998). Organoboron compounds can also undergo efficient transmetallation to palladium and other transition metals followed by reactions with aryl haiides and the like, or coupling under oxidative conditions, to provide various synthetically valuable compounds. Numerous examples of such reactions are described in standard references texts such as March's Advanced Organic Chemistry: Reactions, Mechanisms, and Structure, 5th Ed. (M.B. Smith and J. March, John Wiley & Sons, New York, 2001). [0083] The following Examples are intended to illustrate the above invention and should not be construed as to narrow its scope. One skilled in the art will readily recognize that the Examples suggest many other ways in which the invention could be practiced. It should be understood that numerous variations and modifications may be made while remaining within the scope of the invention. [0084] Some embodiments provide methods for boronic derivatives to undergo both 1 ,4-additions to conjugated enones as well as 1 ,2-addition to aldehydes. Some embodiments provide methods for the Mizoroki-Heck catalyzed cross coupling reactions of aryl and vinylboronic derivatives. Some embodiments provide methods for the Boron- Mannich (Petasis) reaction. Some embodiments provide methods for the formation of carbon-heteratom bonds. Some embodiments provide methods for the Chan-Lam coupling reaction. EXAMPLES [0085] Additional embodiments are disclosed in further detail in the following examples, which are not in any way intended to limit the scope of the claims. [ΘΘ86] All of the alkyltrifluoroborate salts are fully characterized by high field NMR. The spectra collected included 1-D nB, 39F, 1H and 13C as well as DEPT and 2-D NMR experiments on COSY and HSQC. The spectra were run on Varian VNMRS 400, INOVA 500 and VNMRS 600 MHz NMR spectrometers using indirect detection pulse field gradient probes. Example 1 : Preparations of Functionalized Potassium Primary Aikyltrifliioroborate Salts via Hydroboration of a Terminal or 2 -Alky -1 -alkene and Dicyclohexylborane, 9- Borabicyclo[3.3.1 Jnorsane (9-BBN), Bis(3-methyl-2-butyl)borane (disianiylborane) or Diisopinocampheylborane (Ipc2BH) [0087] The same flask, described below, used to prepare the dicyclohexylborane or diisopinocampheylborane, was used for the hydroboration of the functionalized terminal alkene. Tetrahydrofuran was added to the solid diaikylborane. In the cases of disiamvlborane or 9-BBN, a known volume of standardized borane-THF solution was added to a septum capped side-armed round bottom and fitted with a magnetic stirring bar and gas- inlet adapter. The functionalized alkene was added to the borane solution, 1 .1 equiv, and the reactions were monitored by 3 3B NMR. Most reactions were complete within 1 hour at room temperature (~22 °C). [0088] The percent of the boronic derivatives at 53 ppm versus the amount of the trialkvlborane can be used to determine the amount of reduced functional group versus amount of hydroboration. The regioselectivity can also be determined by a variety of techniques. The 1-alkyl group is shifted upfield to a greater extent than the 2-alkyl groups. One can determine the regioselectivity of the hydroboration of the functionalized alkene based on the percentage of these two shifted species. It is known that functional groups affect the regioselectivity in hydroboration reactions. [0089] A 1.0 molar solution of freshly sublimed p-benzoquinone in THF is slowly added dropwise to the THF solution of the mixed trialk vlborane formed above. There was an immediate loss of the intense quinone yellow color on addition. This color began to persist after 1.8 equiv of the quinone had been added. [0090] A THF solution containing one equivalent of alkylboronic ester was hydrolyzed with four equivalents of H?0 for 30 minutes. Approximately ¾ of the THF wras removed under vacuum and the reaction flask was filled with N?. A serum vial containing a small magnetic stir bar was charged with 2.5 equivalents of KHF2, capped with a septum, and thoroughly flushed with N2. Boiled water (2.5 niL/g KFIF2) was added to the serum vial with the aid of a syringe and stirred until the salt dissolved. The l H .■ solution was added dropwise with the aid of a double-ended needle to the THF solution of boronic acid and stirred for 30 minutes. Water and THF were carefully removed under vacuum until the solids are dry. The gas-inlet valve was removed from the reaction apparatus and the solids were transferred to an Erlenmeyer flask with the aid of acetone. The acetone was heated to dissolve the organics, which were then filtered through a pad of powdered cellulose filter aid on a Buchner funnel. The acetone was removed on a rotary evaporator; the remaining solids were triturated with ethyl ether, filtered on a Buchner funnel and washed with ether. The ether solution contained the alkylhydroquinone based on the auxiliary group used for the hydroboration. [0091] Characterization: The nB NMR spectrum showed a single broad quartet resonance signal 4-7 ppm, free of any other boron materials. The ! F spectrum also showed a single resonance signal in the region -135-140 ppm. This signal is indicative an alkyltrifluoroborate salt, and there was a lack of any signals that can be attributed to the hydrogen di fluoride, potassium fluoride or tetraiiuoroborate. The proton NMR spectrum is consistent with structure of the alky group and the hydrogens attached to the a-carbon are shifted upfield, 0.1 - 0.2 ppm, observed as a broad multiplet. The 1 C NMR spectrum is in agreement with the expected chemical shifts of the structure using chemical shifts shielding values based on known alkyltrifluoroborate salts. In general, formed compounds are fully characterized and assigned using 'H, C, COSY and HSQC experiments. The NMR spectra also indicate a pure compound with impurities of less than 1 %. Example 2: Reductive Alkylation of 1 ,4-Benzoquinone Using Mixed (Methylated) Qrganoboranes [0092] The reaction vessel was charged with (hex)2BMe (3 ml., 2.59 mmol); to which, 3 niL of THF was added as a diluent. The charged reaction vessel was then placed in a room temperature water bath. Approximately two equivalents of p-benzoquinone (0.528g, 4,888 mmol) were weighed out and dissolved in 5.1 ml, THF, which gave a volume of 5.7 mL of ~1M solution. The quinone solution was introduced to the reaction mixture by dropwise addition at a consistent, slowr rate during which the quinone color changed as alkylation proceeded. Approximately 4.5 hours after the quinone addition was initiated, the color was extinguished. The general procedure for reductive alkylation of benzoquinone by mixed organoborane is below. R = /i-hexyl [0093] A 0.5 niL (- 0.1036 mmol) aliquot of the borane solution was removed for ! !B NMR spectroscopic analysis. The spectroscopy revealed a resonance signal at 53.8 ppm with an estimated integrated product area of 26.93%, to which was assigned the mixed alkyl bormic phenolate ester, (hex)BMe(hexHQ). The mentioned signal was occluded by a signal at 53 ppm with an estimated area of 5.75%, to which was assigned the previously seen borinic species; most probably, (hex)BMe(Ohex). Further upfield were seen two overlapping signals at 29.9 and 28.4 ppm, respectively. The signal at 29.9 ppm had an estimated area of 42.9%. Two borane species were attributed to this signal; notably, the alkylated boronic phenolate ester (-40.5%), and the previously seen boronic species (~2.4%). [0094] After the foregoing analysis, the reaction was quenched by the addition of 0.085 niL N2 purged DI water (-4.68 mmol), while the reaction solution stirred for 15 minutes. In this manner the alkylated quinone was liberated from the borane, and the air stable boronic acid was formed. j -'xasiiplc 3 ; Reducl ivo Aikyhi ion of" = . - nvoq i inonc LVinu M ixed { N'ortrnol hyiat i ) Trialkylboranes [0095] The reaction diagram for reductive alkylation of 1 ,4-benzoquinone by mixed alkylborane is below. [0096] Reductive alkylation in THF: A reaction vessel was placed in a room, temperature water-bath, and 3 mL THF was added to the vessel. The reaction vessel wras charged with 1 mL (-2.4 mmol) of (Cy)2Bhex. Benzoquinone (0.2594 g; 2.4 mmol) was dissolved in 2.6 ml, THF. A dropwise addition of the first equivalent of benzoquinone was performed over approximately two minutes. [0097] A 0.5 mL aliquot of the reaction mixture was removed for l !B NMR analysis. Within 15 minutes of the benzoquinone's addition, spectroscopy showed a signal at 83 ppni with an area of 7.5%, attributed the initial borane, (Cy)2Bhex . The dominant signal was seen at 53.6 ppni with an area of 87.4%, and was attributed alkylated hydroquiiioiie borinic ester, and the borinic ester side -product of the initial borane. A third signal was observed at 31 ppm with an area of 5.1 %, to which was attributed alkylated hydroquinone boronic ester. [0098] A second equivalent of benzoquinone (0.2396 g; 2.2 mmol) was dissolved in 2.4 ml, THF then added dropwise over a two-minute period to the reaction mixture. [0099] Another 0.5 mL aliquot was removed from the reaction vessel for UB NMR analysis. Less than 15 minutes after the benzoquinone addition was complete, nB NMR spectroscopy showed a single signal at 27.9 ppm, which indicated all of the borane had been converted to alkylated hydroquinone boronic ester. An addition of deionized water (-0.09 mL; ~5 mmol) hydrolyzed the boronic ester and liberated alkylated hydroquinone. [0100] Reductive Alkylation in Et20 THF solution: The foregoing experiment was modified by substitution of Et20 for some of the THF in the reaction vessel, and by -77- making the two equivalent addition of benzoquinone without an intervening 55 B NMR analysis. The reaction vessel was placed in a room temperature water-bath, and 3 mL Et20 was placed in the vessel. The reaction vessel was then charged with 0.5 mL (-1.2 mniol) of the (Cy)?Bhex. TWO equivalents of benzoquinone was measured (0.2594 g; 2.4 nimol) and dissolved in 2.6 mL THF, Dropwise addition of the benzoquinone over a period of 90-120 seconds was performed. [0101] A 0.5 mL aliquot of the borane solution was removed for ! ! B NMR analysis. Notably, the borane solution was clear of any color within 1 5 minutes of the benzoquinone's addition. The spectroscopy showed a signal at 52 pprn with an area of 24,9%, to which was attributed the alkylated hydroquinone borinic ester and the unidentified borinic species side-product of the initial borane. The dominant signal was observed at 30.1 pprn with an area of 75.5 %, to which was attributed the alkylated hydroquinone boronic ester. Further nB NMR analyses were made for another 48 hours. The final analysis showed a signal at 53 pprn with an area of 2.1 %, attributed to the borinic ester. The dominant signal was seen at 31 .2 pprn with an area of 94.7% attributed to the boronic ester. [0102] The boronic ester was hydrolyzed by addition of deionized water (-0,09 mL; ~5 nimol) to quench the reaction and to liberate the alkylated hydroquinone moiety. [0103] Reductive Alkylation in Pentane/THF solution: The foregoing experiment was modified by substitution of pentane for some of the THF in the reaction vessel, and by making the two equivalent addition of benzoquinone without an intervening UR NMR analysis. The reaction vessel was placed in a room temperature water-bath, and 3 mL pentane was placed in the vessel. (Cy)2Bhex was used, and the reaction vessel was charged with 0.4 mL (-0.96 nimol) of the borane. Solid benzoquinone was measured (0,2077 g; 1 .92 mmol) and dissolved in 2.1 mL THF. Dropwise addition of the benzoquinone was completed within two minutes. [0104] A 0.5 mL aliquot of the reaction mixture was removed for ! LB NMR analysis. Notably, the borane solution was clear of any observable color within 15 minutes of the quinone's addition, the spectroscopy showed a signal at 52 ppm with an area of 26.8%, to which was attributed the alkylated hydroquinone borinic ester and the borinic species side- product of the initial borane. The dominant signal was observed at 30.2 ppm with an area of 73.2%, to which was attributed the alkylated hydroquinone boronic ester. [0105] The final NMR analysis was performed 25 hours after the benzoquinone addition was completed. A signal was seen at 53 ppm with an area of 3.1%, to which a borinic species was attributed; also seen was the dominant signal at 30.9 ppm with an area of 96.9%, attributed to the alkylated hydroquinone boronic species. The boronic ester was hydrolyzed by addition of deionized water (-0.04 ml.; ~2 mmol) to quench the reaction and to liberate the alkylated hydroquinone moiety. Example 3: Separation and Characterization of »~Hexyl~Boromc Acid [0106] Hydrolysis of the borane intermediate liberated alkylated hydroquinone and formed n-hexyi-boronic acid. A 0.2 mL aliquot of the boronic acid was removed and 0.5 mL of CDCI3 was added for performing ] H and l 5B NMR analyses. The "B NMR spectroscopy showed one signal at 32.2 ppm, likely the n-hexyl-boronic acid. Analysis of the Ή NMR spectroscopy revealed 0.71 ppm (t, J = 8.2 Hz, 2 H's); 0.87 ppm (t, J = 7.3 Hz, 3 H's); and a series of unresolved signals in the range of 1 .22 - 1.50 ppm, likely the protons of the interior carbons of the boronic acid's hexyl suhstituent. Example 4: Synthesis of Potassium 5-oxohexyitrifluoroborate [0107] Dicyclohexylborane was prepared in a THF solution using air-sensitive techniques working under a nitrogen atmosphere. The 50 mL reaction flask with a side-arm, stir bar, and gas-inlet adaptor were oven dried, assembled hot, the side-arm covered with a septum and cooled under a stream of dry nitrogen.

Terms and phrases used in this application, and variations thereof, especially in the appended claims, unless otherwise expressly stated, should be construed as open ended as opposed to limiting. As examples of the foregoing, the term 'including' should be read to mean 'including, without limitation,' 'including but not limited to,' or the like; the term 'comprising' as used herein is synonymous with 'including,' 'containing,' or 'characterized by,' and is inclusive or open-ended and does not exclude additional, tmrecited elements or method steps; the term 'having' should be interpreted as 'having at least;' the term 'includes' should be interpreted as 'includes but is not limited to;' the term 'example' is used to provide exemplary instances of the item in discussion, not an exhaustive or limiting list thereof; adjectives such as 'known', 'normal', 'standard', and terms of similar meaning should not be construed as limiting the item described to a given time period or to an item available as of a given time, but instead should be read to encompass known, normal, or standard technologies that may be available or known now or at any time in the future; and use of terms like 'preferably,' 'preferred,' 'desired,' or 'desirable,' and words of similar meaning should not be understood as implying that certain features are critical, essential, or even important to the structure or function of the invention, but instead as merely intended to highlight alternative or additional features that may or may not be utilized in a particular embodiment of the invention.

The various singular/plural permutations may be expressly set forth herein for sake of clarity. The indefinite article "a" or "an" does not exclude a plurality. A single processor or other unit may fulfill the functions of several items recited in the claims. The mere fact that certain measures are recited in mutually different dependent claims does not indicate that a combination of these measures cannot be used to advantage. Any reference signs in the claims should not be construed as limiting the scope. [0120] It will be further understood by those within the art that if a specific number of an introduced claim recitation is intended, such an intent will be explicitly recited in the claim, and in the absence of such recitation no such intent is present. For example, as an aid to understanding, the following appended claims may contain usage of the introductory phrases "at least one" and "one or more" to introduce claim recitations. However, the use of such phrases should not be constraed to imply that the introduction of a claim recitation by the indefinite articles "a" or "an" limits any particular claim containing such introduced claim recitation to embodiments containing only one such recitation, even when the same claim includes the introductory phrases "one or more" or "at least one" and indefinite articles such as "a" or "an" (e.g., "a" and/or "an" should typically be interpreted to mean "at least one" or "one or more"); the same holds true for the use of definite articles used to introduce claim recitations. In addition, even if a specific number of an introduced claim recitation is explicitly recited, those skilled in the art will recognize that such recitation should typically be interpreted to mean at least the recited number (e.g., the bare recitation of "two recitations," without other modifiers, typically means at least two recitations, or two or more recitations). Furthermore, in those instances where a convention analogous to "at least one of A, B, and C, etc." is used, in general such a construction is intended in the sense one having skill in the art would understand the convention (e.g., "a system having at least one of A, B, and C" would include but not, be limited to systems that have A alone, B alone, C alone, A and B together, A and C together, B and C together, and/or A, B, and C together, etc.). In those instances where a con vention analogous to "at least one of A, B, or C, etc." is used, in general such a construction is intended in the sense one having skill in the art would understand the convention (e.g., "a system having at least one of A, B, or C" would include but not be limited to systems that have A alone, B alone, C alone, A and B together, A and C together, B and C together, and/or A, B, and C together, etc.). It will be further understood by those within the art that virtually any disjunctive word and/or phrase presenting two or more alternative terms, whether in the description, claims, or drawings, should be understood to contemplate the possibilities of including one of the terms, either of the terms, or both terms. For example, the phrase "A or B" will be understood to include the possibilities of "A" or "B" or "A and B." |0121] All numbers expressing quantities of ingredients, reaction conditions, and so forth used in the specification are to be understood as being modified in all instances by the term, 'about,.' Accordingly, unless indicated to the contrary, the numerical parameters set forth herein are approximations that may vary depending upon the desired properties sought to be obtained. At the very least, and not as an attempt to limit the application of the doctrine of equivalents to the scope of any claims in any application claiming priority to the present application, each numerical parameter should be construed in light of the number of significant digits and ordinary rounding approaches. Furthermore, although the foregoing has been described in some detail by way of illustrations and examples for purposes of clarity and understanding, it is apparent to those skilled in the art that certain changes and modifications may be practiced.
