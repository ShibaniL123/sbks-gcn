A solution of (1S,2S,5R)-5-((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)-2-methylcyclohexane-1-carboxylic acid (18b, 4.0 g, 10.1 mmol), triethylamine (3.1 g, 30.3 mmol), and diphenyl phosphoryl azide (DPPA, 4.2 g, 15.1 mmol) in toluene (100 mL) was stirred at 110° C. for 3 h. Benzyl alcohol (5.5 g, 50.4 mmol) was added and stirring continued at 110° C. for 32 h more. After cooling to room temperature, the reaction was concentrated and the residue was purified by silica gel chromatography (eluting with ethyl acetate in pet. ether) to give benzyl ((1S,2S,5R)-5-((tert-butyldiphenylsilyl)oxy)-2-methylcyclohexyl)carbamate (18c, 2.8 g, 55%) as an oil.
