CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims domestic priority on Applicant's U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 62/000,143, filed on May 19, 2014, the content of which is incorporated herein by reference. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates generally to the conversion of a large bale of forage and bedding material, such as hay or straw, into small rectangular bales of the forage material, and more particularly, to an apparatus for converting the large bale of hay or straw into a stream of material that can be fed into a conventional hay baler for forming small rectangular bales of hay or straw that can be manually handled. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The use of large balers, particularly large rectangular balers, to package hay or straw into large bales of the forage or bedding material, enables the producer of the bales to more easily transport the large rectangular bales for sale in the marketplace. The large rectangular bales of hay or straw are typically sized to fit on the bed of a tractor trailer for shipment of large quantities of the forage or bedding material from the site at which the forage crop was grown to the location where the forage crop can be sold in the marketplace. Large rectangular bales will typically weigh between 600 to 900 pounds and, as a result, require mechanization to handle the bales, either to place them on the trailer for transport, or to move them from one trailer to another. Small rectangular bales of hay or straw will typically weigh between 40 and 60 pounds and, accordingly, can be handled manually without requiring any mechanization to load or unload the small rectangular bales. However, the time required to load a trailer with small rectangular bales is substantially longer than the time required to load a trailer with large rectangular, or even round, bales by using loader mechanization to position the bales on the trailer. As a result, the popularity of placing forage or bedding material, including hay and straw, into large, highly compressed packages has increased. Nevertheless, many consumers of baled forage or bedding materials prefer to have the small rectangular bales in order to facilitate handling at the time of distributing the forage or bedding material to the animals. It would be desirable to provide a device for reconstructing a large rectangular bale of forage or bedding material into a plurality of small rectangular bales that can be manually handled. It would also be desirable to provide a device that would be operable to disintegrate a large rectangular bale into a stream of loose forage or bedding material that can be fed to a conventional small rectangular baler. It would also be desirable to provide a method of repackaging large rectangular bales of forage or bedding material into small rectangular bales of forage material. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is an object of this invention to overcome the disadvantage of the prior art by providing an apparatus that can convert large rectangular bales of forage or bedding material into small rectangular bales that can be handled manually. It is another object of this invention to provide an apparatus that will disintegrate large rectangular bales of forage or bedding material into discrete components of the material that can be repackaged into smaller bales that can be manually manipulated. It is a feature of this invention that an inclined conveyor having spikes projecting therefrom pull individual slices of the material from the formed large rectangular bale and elevate the slices for subsequent processing thereof. It is another feature of this invention that the apparatus is formed with a tumbler bed that extracts discrete components of the material from the slices and allows the discrete components to fall through the tumbler bed to be received by a collecting conveyor. It is still another feature of this invention that the tumbler bed is formed by a series of tumbler shaft assemblies that are arranged in a generally horizontal array rearwardly of the inclined conveyor, with each tumbler shaft including a plurality of transversely spaced disks having teeth projecting outwardly therefrom to engage and disintegrate the slices of forage or bedding material. It is an advantage of this invention that each tumbler shaft assembly is operated at a faster rotational speed than the tumbler shaft immediately forwardly thereof. It is another advantage of this invention that the disks of adjacent tumbler shaft assemblies are placed into an interleaving arrangement. It is yet another feature of this invention that the rearwardmost tumbler shaft assembly is cooperable with a rake member having tines that projects downwardly between the disks of the rearwardmost tumbler shaft assembly to complete the disintegration of the slice and direct the material downwardly onto the collecting conveyor. It is still another advantage of this invention that the disintegration of the large rectangular bale slices by the tumbler bed creates a fluffy windrow of forage or bedding material on the collecting conveyor that can be repackaged by a small rectangular baler into smaller bales. It is still another feature of this invention that an approach conveyor is utilized to load large rectangular bales thereon to be conveyor to the bale disintegration apparatus. It is yet another advantage of this invention that the apparatus includes a spiked roller that is operated at the same peripheral speed as the slices of material being elevated by the inclined conveyor to place the slices from the inclined conveyor to the tumbler bed. It is still another advantage of this invention that a hold-down mechanism is formed with downwardly and rearwardly oriented bars to press the slices of forage or bedding material onto the tumbler bed to enhance disintegration thereof. It is a further advantage of this invention that the interleaved intersection of disks of adjacent tumbler shaft assemblies creates an aggressive disintegration action by downwardly moving teeth on the forward tumbler shaft assembly and the faster upwardly moving teeth of the rearward tumbler shaft assembly. It is still another object of this invention to provide an apparatus for converting large bales of forage or bedding material into smaller bales which is durable in construction, inexpensive of manufacture, carefree of maintenance, facile in assemblage, and simple and effective in use. These and other objects, features, and advantages are accomplished according to the instant invention by providing an apparatus for disintegrating large rectangular bales of forage or bedding material and reforming the disintegrated material into smaller rectangular bales. The apparatus includes an inclined conveyor having spikes projecting therefrom to remove slices of material from the large bale and a spiked roller to move the slice rearwardly onto a tumbler bed that receives the slice and affects disintegration thereof. The tumbler bed includes a plurality of transverse assemblies having disks interleaving with the disks on adjacent assemblies with each assembly rotating faster than the assembly immediately forwardly thereof. The disintegrated material falls through the tumbler bed as discrete components that land on a collecting conveyor that conveys the material rearwardly to a small rectangular baler for repackaging. The apparatus further includes a hold-down mechanism that presses the slices toward the tumbler bed to enhance disintegration. An approach conveyor feeds the large rectangular bales loaded thereon to the inclined conveyor for processing.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT Referring now to FIGS. 1-5, an overall view of the large bale conversion machine can be seen. Any left, right, upper and lower references are made as a matter of convenience and are determined by standing at the rear or discharge end of the machine 10 and facing the approach conveyor 12 where the large rectangular bales to be converted into a number of smaller bales are positioned to begin the conversion process. The function of the bale conversion machine 10 is to convert a large rectangular bale of forage or bedding material, such as hay or straw, into a number of smaller bales by disintegrating the large bale and conveying the disintegrated forage or bedding material to a conventional small baler 60 for re-baling the forage or bedding material into the smaller rectangular bales. One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the large rectangular bales of hay or straw will weigh in the range of 600 to 900 pounds and must be moved by mechanized devices, such as a front end loader on a tractor (not shown). The large bale conversion machine 10 begins with a horizontal approach conveyor 12 onto which large rectangular bales of forage or bedding material are placed thereon by a mechanized device, such as a front end loader or a skid steer loader. The baler twine used to retain the shape of the large rectangular bale is manually removed to facilitate the subsequent disintegration of the large bale. The approach conveyor 12 has a plurality of slats 13 attached to endless conveyor chains 14 that operate to move the large bale rearwardly toward the bale disintegration apparatus 20. At the rearward end of the approach conveyor 12, the bale conversion machine 10 includes the bale disintegration apparatus 20 that begins with an inclined conveyor 15 oriented preferably at approximately 45 degrees to the horizontal orientation of the approach conveyor 12 to initiate the disintegration process. The inclined conveyor 15 is supported on the frame 21 of the bale disintegration apparatus 20 and is formed with an endless conveyor 16, preferably a belt conveyor, having a plurality of spikes 17 affixed to slats 18 at spaced intervals along the endless conveyor 16. The spikes 17 engage the end of a large rectangular bale of forage or bedding material and operate to remove a slice of the forage or bedding material from the large rectangular bale, which then falls rearwardly onto the incline conveyor 15 to be conveyed thereby upwardly away from the large bale at the lower end of the incline conveyor 15. One skilled in the art will recognize that large rectangular bales of forage or bedding material are formed in the same general manner as small rectangular bales by a baler that compresses discrete charges of the forage material into a baling chamber forming slices of forage material until a sufficient number of the slices are collected to create a large rectangular bale of a desired size. These compressed slices of forage material are held together in the large rectangular bale shape by the baler twine. Thus, the spaced slats 18 on the inclined conveyor 15 engage subsequent slices of the forage or bedding material to provide a substantially continuous flow of slices of forage or bedding material moving upwardly by the incline conveyor 15. One skilled in the art will also recognize that the expression of “rectangular bales”, whether large or small, is sometimes referred to as “square bales”. A primary difference between large bales and small bales is that large bales is that the large bales are too heavy for manual manipulation and require mechanization to handle large rectangular or square bales, while small bales can be moved manually. Referring now to FIGS. 1-12, the individual slices of the hay or straw are moved vertically and rearwardly by the incline conveyor 15 to the upper end thereof. At the upper end, the bale disintegration apparatus 20 includes a spiked roller 22 oriented transversely to the flow of hay or straw moving upwardly and rearwardly on the incline conveyor 15. The spiked roller 22 is rotated at the same peripheral speed as the slices of hay or straw moving along the inclined conveyor 15 and includes a plurality of rows of spikes 23 that extend radially out of the roller 22 to engage the slices of hay or straw moving over the upper end of the inclined conveyor 15. The function of the spiked roller 22 is to strip the slices of forage or bedding material from the upper end of the inclined conveyor 15 and move the slices rearwardly beneath the spiked roller 22 onto the tumbler bed 30. The tumbler bed 30 is formed by a series of tumbler shaft assemblies 31-35 extending transversely across the apparatus 20 and being oriented in a rearward succession from one another. The tumbler shaft assemblies 31-35 are driven, as defined in greater detail below, in increasing peripheral speeds as the tumbler shaft assemblies 31-35 are located rearwardly. In other words, the first tumbler shaft assembly 31 is driven at about 30 RPM and each tumbler shaft assembly rearward thereof is driven incrementally faster until the last tumbler shaft assembly 35 is driven at about 80 RPM. Each tumbler shaft assembly 31-35 is formed with a central shaft 36 on which is mounted a plurality of spaced apart disks 37 with each disk 37 having a plurality of radially extending teeth 38 connected to the respective disk 37 and projecting outwardly therefrom to aggressively engage the slices of forage or bedding material moving across the tumbler bed 30 by the rotation of the tumbler shaft assemblies 31-35. The disks 37 of each of the tumbler shaft assemblies 31-35 are located between the disks of the adjacent tumbler shaft assembly 31-35 to form an interleaved relationship between the respective disks 37. In the way of an example, the first, third and fifth tumbler shaft assemblies 31, 33 and 35 can have twelve transversely spaced disks 37 on the central shaft 36, while the even numbered tumbler shaft assemblies 32, 34 could have eleven transversely spaced disks 37 with each of the disks 37 on the even tumbler shaft assemblies 32, 34 being positioned between the corresponding disks 37 on the adjacent tumbler shaft assemblies 31, 33 and 35. With each rearward tumbler shaft assembly rotating faster the tumbler shaft assembly in front of it, the teeth 38 aggressively tear apart the forage or bedding material within the slice as the slice passes over the interleaved area between two adjacent tumbler shaft assemblies 31-35. The dislodged hay or straw falls between the respective disks 37 onto a collecting conveyor 29 located below the tumbler bed 30. By the time the slice of forage or bedding material is conveyed to the last tumbler shaft 35, most of the material has been dislodged from the slice and little remains. At the rearward end of the tumbler bed 30, a rake member 39 is positioned such that the teeth 38 on the last tumbler shaft assembly 35 pass between the rake tines 39a, which provides a final shredding action to the remaining material in the disintegrated slice. The net result is that the forage or bedding material within the slice is disintegrated by the tumbler bed 30 and deposited onto the collecting conveyor 29 in a fluffy condition reminiscent of a windrow of hay or straw in the field when originally harvested and baled. At the end of the collecting conveyor 29, a conventional small rectangular baler 60 is positioned to receive the disintegrated forage or bedding material and re-bale the material into the desired small rectangular bales that are of a size that can be manually manipulated and handled. Above the tumbler bed 30, a hold down device 40 is supported on the frame 21 of the bale disintegration apparatus 20 and is formed of angled bars 42 that keep the slice of forage or bedding material pressed downwardly against the tumbler bed 30. The hold down device 40 enhances the disintegration action of the progressively increasing speeds of the tumbler shaft assemblies 31-35 by preventing the slice of forage or bedding material from moving upwardly as the upwardly moving teeth 38 engage the slice. The drive mechanism 50 is best seen in FIGS. 3, 8 and 9. A drive motor 45 is preferably mounted on the rear of the frame 21 of the bale disintegrating apparatus 20. This drive motor 45 can be hydraulically or mechanically powered, but preferably the motor 45 is electrically powered as the bale conversion mechanism 10 is intended to be operated in closed spaces. A chain drive 47 intertwines a sprocket 51-55 on each respective corresponding tumbler shaft assembly 31-35 wherein each sprocket 51-55 has a larger diameter compared to the smaller diameter sprocket immediately rearwardly thereof. In other words, the fifth sprocket 55 on the rearwardmost tumbler shaft 35 is the smallest diameter sprocket and the first sprocket 51 on the forwardmost tumbler shaft 31 is the largest diameter sprocket. With the chain 47 passing around each respective sprocket 51-55 and an idler sprocket 56 between each adjacent pair of drive sprockets 51-55, the chain drive 47 operates all of the tumbler shaft assemblies 31-35 in the same direction, i.e. clockwise when viewed from the left side of the tumbler bed 30, so that the slices of forage and bedding material are conveyed rearwardly over the tumbler bed 30 as the tumbler shaft assemblies 31-35 are rotated. The forwardmost tumbler shaft 31 also includes a transfer sprocket 57 about which a second chain 48 is entrained to transfer rotation power to a drive sprocket 58 for the inclined conveyor 15 and then by a third drive chain 48a to a drive sprocket 59 affixed to the spiked roller 22 that will assure that the spiked roller 22 is operated at the same speed as the inclined conveyor 15, but in the opposite direction. The approach conveyor 12 and the collecting conveyor 29 can be driven by separate drive motors 49, 49a, and particularly electrically powered drive motors 49, 49a. In operation, the bale conversion machine 10 receives a supply of large rectangular bales (not shown) of forage or bedding material, such as hay or straw, on the approach conveyor 12 typically placed on the approach conveyor by a mechanized device capable of handling the weight of the large rectangular bales. The baler twine (not shown) holding the large rectangular bale together is removed, preferably manually so that the baler twine is not incorporated into the disintegrated forage or bedding material as processed by the bale conversion machine 10. The approach conveyor 12 moves the large rectangular bales toward the bale disintegration apparatus 20 for processing. The large rectangular bales are received at the bottom of the inclined conveyor 15 whereby the spikes 17 remove a slice of forage or bedding material from the large rectangular bale, with the slice being typically one to three inches thick, and deposit the removed slice onto the inclined conveyor 15. The inclined conveyor 15 elevates the removed slice to the upper portion of the inclined conveyor 15 where the spiked roller 22 engages the slice and conveys the slice from the upper portion of the inclined conveyor 15 under the spiked roller 22 and onto the tumbler bed 30. Meanwhile, the inclined conveyor 15 continues to remove subsequent slices of forage or bedding material from the supply of large rectangular bales on the approach conveyor 12 to provide a substantially continuous flow of slices elevated on the inclined conveyor 15. The slice of forage or bedding material passes from the spiked roller 22 to the first tumbler shaft 31 whereupon the teeth 38 on the first tumbler shaft assembly 31 start to remove the hay or straw from the slice. However, a more aggressive disintegration action occurs at the interleaved section between the first and second tumbler shaft assemblies 31, 32 where the teeth 38 on the first tumbler shaft assembly 31 are drawing the hay or straw downwardly while the teeth 38 on the second tumbler shaft assembly 32 are moving upwardly at a greater speed than the teeth 38 on the first tumbler shaft assembly are moving. Similar action happens at each succeeding interleaved area between adjacent tumbler shaft assemblies, as each further rearward tumbler shaft assembly is being rotated faster than the tumbler shaft assembly forwardly thereof. By the end of the tumbler bed 30, most if not all of the hay or straw in the slice has been disintegrated and dropped onto the collecting conveyor 29 immediately below the tumbler bed 30. The rake member 39 at the rear of the tumbler bed 30 catches any remaining forage or bedding material so that the interspersed teeth 38 on the fifth tumbler shaft assembly 35 passing between the rake tines 39a finally disintegrate the slice. The collector conveyor 29 removes the disintegrated forage or bedding material from the bale disintegration apparatus 20 and delivers the fluffy hay or straw to a rearwardly positioned conventional small rectangular baler 60 that will operate to re-bale the disintegrated forage and bedding material into smaller rectangular bales that can be manually handled and manipulated. It will be understood that changes in the details, materials, steps and arrangements of parts which have been described and illustrated to explain the nature of the invention will occur to and may be made by those skilled in the art upon a reading of this disclosure within the principles and scope of the invention. The foregoing description illustrates the preferred embodiment of the invention; however, concepts, as based upon the description, may be employed in other embodiments without departing from the scope of the invention.
