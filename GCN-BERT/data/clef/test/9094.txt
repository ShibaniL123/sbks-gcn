SOLID FORMS OF A PHARMACEUTICALLY ACTIVE COMPOUND FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to various forms of compounds, for example, compounds that have use in pharmaceutical applications. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The compound 4-{ [(2R, 3S,4R,5S)-4-(4-Chloro-2-Fluoro-Phenyl)-3-(3-Chloro-2-Fluoro- Phenyl)-4-Cyano-5-(2,2-Dimethyl-Propyl)-Pyrrolidine-2-Carbonyl]-Amino}-3- Methoxy - Benzoic Acid is represented by formula (1) The compound of formula (1), or compound (1), as well as methods for making it, are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 8,354,444 and WO2011/098398. 4-{ [(2R,3S,4R,5S)-4-(4-Chloro-2-fluoro-phenyl)-3-(3-chloro-2-fluoro-phenyl)-4-cyano-5-(2,2- dimethyl-propyl)-pyrrolidine-2-carbonyl] -amino }-3-methoxy-benzoic acid (C31H29CI2F2N3O4) is a potent and selective inhibitor of the p53-MDM2 interaction that activates the p53 pathway and induces cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis in a variety of tumor types expressing wild-type p53 in vitro and in vivo. Compound (1) belongs to a novel class of MDM2 inhibitors having potent anticancer therapeutic activity, in particular in leukemia such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and solid tumors such as for example head and neck, non-small cell lung, breast and colorectal cancers, as well as sarcoma. The above-identified international patent application and US Patent describe Compound A in crystalline form and is herein incorporated by reference in its totality. The crystalline form of the compound has an on- set melting point of approximately 277 °C. The crystalline forms have relatively low aqueous solubility (<0.05 μg/mL in water) at physiological pHs (which range from pHl.5-8.0) and consequently less than optimal bioavailability (high variability). It is thus desirable to obtain a form of the compound which has improved solubility/dissolution rate and bioavailability. Active pharmaceutical ingredients (API's) may be prepared in a variety of different forms, such as for example salts, solvates, hydrates, co-crystals. API's may also be in their amorphous state or one or several crystalline forms (polymorphs). Depending on the form, the physicochemical properties of an API may change, leading to e.g. different solubility, thermodynamic stability, density or melting point of different forms. Such physicochemical properties therefore may have significant influence of the efficacy or bioavailability of a known API. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides solid forms of compound (1) selected from the group consisting of, a) a substantially amorphous form of compound (1); b) a hemi -hydrate, hydrate, hemi- solvate or solvate of compound (1); c) a polymorph of compound (1); or harmaceutically acceptable salt of compound (1). In one particular embodiment, said solid form is selected from a hemi-hydrate or -solvate designated form IV, V, VI, VII of compound (1). In another particularly preferred embodiment, said solid form is selected from a polymorph designated form I, II and III of compound (1). In yet another preferred embodiment, said solid form is selected from the substantially amorphous form of compound (1). In another embodiment, the invention provides a method of for treating a disease or condition in a mammal in need thereof. The method includes administering to the mammal an effective amount of a composition comprising a solid form compound as described herein. The solid forms disclosed herein may be further processed into any type of solid pharmaceutical preparations or dosage forms, which are known to the person of skill in the art. Particularly preferred are oral dosage forms such as tablets, capsules, pills, powders, suspensions, pasts and the like. Detailed descriptions of suitable excipients as well as methods for making such pharmaceutical preparations can for example be found in: Raymond C. Rowe et al, Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients, 6th edition, 2009, Pharmaceutical Press (Publ.); ISBN-10: 0853697922. Consequently, so obtained pharmaceutical preparations form further embodiments provided herein.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION As used herein, the general term "amorphous forms" denote a material that lacks long range order and as such does not show sharp X-ray peaks. The X-Ray Powder Diffraction (XRPD) pattern of an amorphous material is characterized by one or more amorphous halos. More specifically, the term "amorphous form" as used herein refers to the amorphous form of 4- { [(2R,3S,4R,5S)-4-(4-Chloro-2-fluoro-phenyl)-3-(3-chloro-2-fluoro-phenyl)-4-cyano-5-(2,2- dimethyl-prop yl)-pyrrolidine-2-carbonyl] -amino }-3-methoxy-benzoic acid (compound 1) as such, provided said amorphous form does not form a one phase system, such as for example a solid dispersion or microprecipitated bulk powder (MBP) together with any type of supporting material such as polymers or the like. The amorphous form of the invention is preferentially substantially pure, meaning the amorphous form includes less than about 15%, preferably less than about 10%, preferably less than about 5%, preferably less than about 1%, even more preferably less than 0.1% by weight of impurities, including other polymorph forms of compound (1). In some embodiments, at least about 30-99% by weight of the total of compound 1 in the composition is present as the amorphous form. In further embodiments, at least about 70%, at least about 80%, at least about 90%, at least about 99% or at least about 99.9% by weight of the total of compound 1 in the composition is present as the amorphous form. Also provided by the invention are compositions consisting essentially of compound (1) wherein at least about 97-99% by weight of the compound (1) is present in the composition as an amorphous form, a polymorph form, a solvate form as described herein or combinations thereof. The term "polymorph" as used herein means one of the different crystal structures in which a compound can crystallize. Polymorphs are best characterized by their space group and unit-cell parameters. This term is reserved for materials with the same elemental analysis. "Ambient temperature" means any temperature in the range of 18 to 28 °C, preferably 20 to 24 °C. The term "composition" refers to a pharmaceutical preparation suitable for administration to an intended animal subject for therapeutic purposes that contains at least one pharmaceutically active compound, including any solid form thereof. The composition may include at least one additional pharmaceutically acceptable component to provide an improved formulation of the compound, such as a suitable carrier or excipient. The term "pharmaceutically acceptable" indicates that the indicated material does not have properties that would cause a reasonably prudent medical practitioner to avoid administration of the material to a patient, taking into consideration the disease or conditions to be treated and the respective route of administration. For example, it is commonly required that such a material be essentially sterile, e.g., for injectibles. FTIR (Fourier- Transform Infrared) spectra were recorded as film of a Nujol suspension of approximately 5 mg of sample and few Nujol between two sodium chloride plates, with an FTIR spectrometer in transmittance. The Spectrometer is a Nicolet™ 20SXB or equivalent (resolution 2 cm-1, 32 or more co-added scans, MCT detector). Characteristic wavenumbers for the solid forms according to the present invention are shown in Table 1 below: Table 1: Characteristic Bands (cm 1) in the IR Spectra for amorphous, polymorphs and solvates of Compound (1).
