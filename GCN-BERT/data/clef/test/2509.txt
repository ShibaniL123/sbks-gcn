Synthesis of Compound 53
The compound 52 (108 mg, 0.16 mmol) was dissolved in 16% NH3/MeOH (6 mL), and the solution was stirred. After 16 hours, the disappearance of the raw material was confirmed by TLC (CHCl3:CH3OH=5:1, UV, anisaldehyde). Then, the solvent was distilled off under reduced pressure. A compound 53 (70.1 mg, 0.16 mmol, 98%) was obtained as a yellow oil.
