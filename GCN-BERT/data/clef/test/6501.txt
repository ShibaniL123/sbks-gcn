Arylation Product 3kp:
To a 2-dram vial with a PTFE-lined cap was charged with acetal 1k (34.4 mg, 0.0997 mmol), ethyl 2-iodobenzoate (110 mg, 0.399 mmol), NBE-CO2Me (21.9 mg, 0.144 mmol), Pd(TFA)2 (3.4 mg, 0.0102 mmol), TFA-Gly-OH (3.5 mg, 0.0205 mmol), AgOAc (67.1 mg, 0.402 mmol), and DCE (2.00 mL). The resulting mixture was heated to 100° C. and stirred for 24 h. After cooling to room temperature, ethylenediamine (0.100 mL) was added, and the resulting mixture was stirred at 23° C. for 2 h. The mixture was filtered through a plug of silica gel, eluting with EtOAc (30 mL), and the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by flash column chromatography (5:1 hexanes/EtOAc eluent) to afford arylation product 3kp together with an unidentified impurity (27.0 mg total). (53% recovery of starting material 1k was also observed in the crude NMR prior to purification.) Impure arylation product 3kp was then dissolved in MeOH (2.00 mL), HCl (gas) was bubbled through the mixture until the pH ˜1, and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 22 h. Sat. aq. Na2CO3 (5 mL) and water (10 mL) were then added, and the mixture was extracted with EtOAc (3×15 mL). The combined organic layers were washed with brine (10.0 mL) and dried over anhydrous Na2SO4. The solvent was removed by rotary evaporation, and the resulting residue was purified by preparative TLC (3:1 hexanes/EtOAc eluent) to afford biaryl alcohol 6kp (11.9 mg, 37% yield, Rf=0.44 in 2:1 hexanes/EtOAc) as a colorless oil.
