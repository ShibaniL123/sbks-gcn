FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a pet mat assembly for feeding animals. More particularly relates to an assembly for feeding pet animals BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Pets like dogs and cats often have a habit of pushing their food around while eating from a plate or bowl, thus creating a mess, resulting in the spillage of food/water on the floors or carpet. There are many pet bowls known in the art which have a non-slip/skid surface to protect the bowl from slipping over the floor in order to minimize the spillage of food/water contained in bowl. These bowls face certain limitations as they are usually made up of multiple-components which are either separately assembled or integrated in one, and hence these bowls are costly. In case of any damages assembled bowls are required to be replaced immediately. In case of integrated bowls, proper washing of such bowls always remains a difficult task; also they are not safe for a dishwasher, and hence it is difficult to provide proper hygiene to one's pet. US2004/0237901 discloses a pet mat; wherein the upper surface is provided with one or more raised bumps such that a common pet bowl placed on any part of upper surface will fall within the interstices between the pattern of the bumps and prevent the movement of the bowl around the mat. The main disadvantage of this product is that it is difficult to clean and therefore not a long term solution. US2009/0068423 discloses a food safe pet mat comprising a support and an outer layer, wherein outer layer is plastic food safe and an image is printed on at least one of the support surfaces. While this article may have aesthetic appeal, is still does not successfully solve the problem of spillage of food by pets while eating. There are several other mats which are present in the market. Hence, there is need to provide an improved device to protect the floors and carpet from food/water spillage. Thus the present invention addresses this need and provides an article for feeding animals, which effectively prevents the movement of the bowl during feeding by an animal and subsequent spillage of the contents thereof. OBJECT OF THE INVENTION It is an object of the invention is to provide a pet mat assembly for feeding animals, which prevents or minimizes the spillage of food/water caused by the pets.
