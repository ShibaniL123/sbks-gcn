Step 2: Synthesis of tert-butyl 4-(4-(2,2-dibromovinyl)-3-fluorophenyl)-3,6-dihydropyridine-1(2H)-carboxylate
To a solution of tert-butyl 4-(3-fluoro-4-formylphenyl)-3,6-dihydropyridine-1(2H)-carboxylate (3 g, 1 eq) in dichloromethane (50 ml) was added with carbon tetrabromide (4.89 g, 1.5 eq) and triphenylphosphine (7.73 g, 3 eq). The mixture was stirred for 1 hr at 0Â° C., and extracted with dichloromethane and water. The organic layer was washed with brine, dried over anhydrous MgSO4 and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was purified with column chromatography to prepare the title compound (4.13 g, 91%).
