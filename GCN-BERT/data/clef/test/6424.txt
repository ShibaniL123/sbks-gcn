The term guiding a cable as used here in specific embodiments, describes the housing or passing of a cable as in, for example, cable ducts or cable trunkings. The term guiding a cable as used here in specific embodiments describes the positioning, gathering, holding up or supporting the cable. The term guiding a cable as used here in several embodiments, denotes the taking along of the cable in a movement which is performed by the device according to the present invention. A medical dosing apparatus is in specific embodiments an apparatus for dosing liquids, medical solutions, infusions and so on. In specific embodiments according to the present invention, the dosing apparatus exhibits at least one holding chamber for the substance or solution to be dosed, e.g., in the form of a variable volume syringe, a support device for the holding chamber, a movable section as well as at least one device according to the present invention for guiding at least one cable. In some embodiments, the medical dosing apparatus according to the present invention additionally exhibits at least one electrical component—as for example an electrically powered sensor—and/or a positioning element for moving the movable section. The positioning element is, in specific embodiments according to the present invention, a moving tube. In some embodiments according to the present invention, the positioning element revolves around its own longitudinal axis during movement of the movable section. The holding chamber is in some embodiments a—in most cases cylindrical—cavity with a movable piston arranged within, also known as a plunger, as well as an orifice or opening to allow the output of the contents of the holding chamber. The filling of the holding chamber can be accomplished through various means; it can for example be filled by the doctor or during production. In some embodiments, the holding chamber is made of plastic. The holding chamber can be a conventional pharmaceutical syringe. The holding chamber can be formed as a single-use product (disposable). Alternatively, it can be designated for repeat use. In some embodiments, the orifice or opening to release the contents of the holding chamber is formed with a screw thread. The screw thread can be formed to connect to a tube (e.g., an intravenous drip tube), a hollow needle (cannula), a catheter, a three-way valve or similar. The screw thread can be formed as a standardised connecting system (particularly Luer-Lock). In some embodiments, the movable section of the dosing apparatus is connected to the movable piston of the holding chamber or designed for one such connection. The movable section is shaped as a handle in specific embodiments. The positioning element and/or the device according to the present invention is or respectively are in specific embodiments according to the present invention connected to the movable section of the dosing apparatus or at least designed for such a connection. The connection between the positioning element and/or the device according to the present invention on the one side and the movable section on the other side can be designed to be detachable or non-detachable. The positioning element can cause the movable section to move with the help of, for example, a carrier or by means of an appropriate connection. By this means for example, the piston of the holding chamber can be moved by means of the positioning element in order to release the contents of the holding chamber through the orifice. In some embodiments according to the present invention, the positioning element is connected to a motor, e.g., a stepper motor, a drive or actuating device, to which a controller or control system can be interfaced. In specific embodiments according to the present invention the cable is connected to the electrical component of the dosing apparatus or features the electrical component. An electrical component can be a sensor, a circuit, an optical-coupler or similar. In some embodiments, the device according to the present invention is over its entire length or in at least a section thereof, a cable conduit. In specific embodiments, the device according to the present invention exhibits over its entire length or in at least a section thereof, a round, square, oval or any other cross-sectional form, particularly a closed cross-sectional form. The device according to the present invention can be manufactured from plastic, metal, fibre-reinforced material or other materials or feature such. The device according to the present invention can be straight and/or have single or multiple bends or can have another form. In specific embodiments, the device according to the present invention is connected so as to move together with the movable section of the dosing apparatus, or designed for one such a connection. In some embodiments, the device according to the present invention is connected to the movable section in a type of carrier function. A carrier function can, for example, be a non-permanent positive fitting connection, e.g., constructed as a pin or ring on the device according to the present invention such that, e.g., by a linear movement of the movable section, the device will be carried along with it. In specific embodiments of the invention, the device according to the present invention is connected permanently to the movable section of the dosing apparatus, or designed for such a connection. The term permanent in these embodiments of the present invention denotes a limited or unlimited period of time. A limited period of time can amount to, for example, one day, several days, weeks, months or years. A limited period of time can, for example, add up to from commissioning to a next service date. A limited period of time can also be from the first installation of an electrical component and with this the first use of the cable in the dosing apparatus, until the exchange or replacement of these components at a later point in time. A permanent connection can be formed so as to be detached again or non-detachable. A detachable connection is achievable for example by means of a plug-in (e.g., press-fit) of the device in the movable section of the dosing apparatus, a screw fit, or a detachable adhesive. A connection can be sealed against liquids or gases using methods known to a person skilled in the art. In specific embodiments according to the present invention, the cable is connected to a sensor fixed in the dosing apparatus, which is designed and/or suitable to detect the presence and/or the position of at the least the movable section and/or the holding chamber within the dosing apparatus. The sensor can be an active or passive sensor. In some embodiments according to the present invention, the sensor is an ultrasonic sensor, an opto-electronic sensor, a capacitive sensor or another sensor type. Also sensors based on other measurement principles are encompassed according to the present invention, for example magnetic-inductive sensors. The section of the device according to the present invention or dosing apparatus to be detected can be suitably prepared or formed. So, for example, the holding chamber can include materials that can be detected with a magnetic-inductive sensor. In some embodiments, according to the present invention, the checking of the location or position by means of the sensor is carried out through a comparison of the currently received sensor signals with reference signals. In specific embodiments, the device according to the present invention is inserted into a connection aperture in the dosing apparatus or is designed to be so inserted. In some embodiments according to the present invention, the connection aperture is positioned in a housing—or a section hereof—of the dosing apparatus. In some embodiments according to the present invention, the connection aperture connects an interior of the dosing apparatus with an exterior of the dosing apparatus or the vicinity of it. In specific embodiments according to the present invention, the connection aperture has a round cross-section wholly or at least in a section thereof. The cross-section can also however be oval or square or exhibit any other form. In some embodiments, the device according to the present invention is pushed into the connection aperture of the dosing apparatus, or plugged in or otherwise inserted. In specific embodiments according to the present invention, at least the device and/or the connecting aperture respectively are formed completely or in part thereof as a sleeve, or feature such. In specific embodiments according to the present invention, a sleeve is a tube or a tube section. Sleeves can, for example, be made from plastic or metal with the known advantages of these materials. In specific embodiments of the present invention, the sleeve- or tube-formed connection aperture in the dosing apparatus is arranged in such a way or provided for such an arrangement that it extends out from the housing section in which the connection opening is positioned at least 20 mm, preferably at least 25 mm, further preferred 30 or 35 mm into the interior and/or out to the exterior of the dosing apparatus. In some embodiments, the sleeve- or tube-formed connection in the dosing apparatus exhibits a length of 20 mm or 25 mm or 30 mm or 35 mm. The sleeve can also exhibit a length between these values or shorter than 20 mm or longer than 35 mm. The lengths identified in the two preceding paragraphs are advantageous by virtue of, for example, that disinfection liquids cannot enter the interior of the dosing apparatus through the connection aperture. Greater lengths in some embodiments according to the present invention are not required for this. In specific embodiments of the invention, the device according to the present invention is arranged or designed for the arrangement in which at least one section of the device according to the invention is arranged inside at least one section of the—for example sleeve-formed or not sleeve-formed—connection aperture so as to slide relative to this. In some embodiments of the present invention, the materials of the device according to the present invention and the structure surrounding the connection aperture are chosen in such a way that both elements are low-friction or friction-optimised for a sliding motion against one another. Suitable material combinations are known to persons skilled in the art. In specific embodiments of the invention, the device according to the present invention is arranged or designed for the arrangement to be totally or at least with one section of the device coaxially—or fundamentally coaxially—slidable within the connection aperture. The treatment apparatus according to the present invention is in some embodiments a blood treatment apparatus, particularly a hemodialysis apparatus, a hemofiltration apparatus or a hemodiafiltration apparatus. The method to enable or carry out detection of the position of a movable section encompasses in specific embodiments according to the present invention the arrangement of the device according to the present invention or a section thereof inside a connection aperture or inside a section of the connection aperture. Specific embodiments of the present invention feature one or more of the hereafter stated advantages. The present invention provides a device for guiding a cable in a medical dosing apparatus. In carrying out the operation of the dosing apparatus, the cable can advantageously be moved relative to this or a section thereof, without in this case being mechanically loaded, for example, in the area of its connection to a sensor or to the movable section of the dosing apparatus. The cable will not be damaged during its movement. Such damage could be kinking, damage from proximity to hot machinery parts, damage from sharp edges, damage from resting on moving parts, cable breakage or the like. Such damage will be advantageously prevented by the guidance of the cable together with the device according to the present invention. Furthermore by way of example, a cable or conductor by means of which a movable component inside the dosing apparatus or an apparatus for another purpose can be provided with power or transmit a signal, may be guided to the outside without damage during use in order to, e.g., be connected to a power source or a signal receiver external to the device. In specific embodiments of the invention, the penetration of dripping water (e.g., through a water ingress protection according to IPX1), disinfecting agents or other liquids to the interior of the dosing apparatus will be advantageously prevented. These advantageous properties in specific embodiments according to the present invention result from the length of the connecting aperture; in some embodiments by virtue of a narrow gap between the device according to the present invention and the connecting aperture (this is valid especially when the device according to the present invention is arranged coaxially in the connecting aperture). Thus can internal electrical components such as sensors be protected from moisture. The device according to the present invention can be a low priced commercially available tube or can likewise be produced economically as an injection moulded part. The cable can be installed simply into the device according to the present invention in that it can be pulled through or inserted into it. In the inside of the device according to the present invention the cable is advantageously protected from damage from external effects or through catching on components of the dosing apparatus as well as through mechanical stress from other causes. In doing so, elaborate cable routing can advantageously be dispensed with. The cable that is guided in the device according to the current invention, during movement of the movable section of the dosing apparatus, requires no—or at least little—movement of the cable relative to the device according to the present invention, given that the cable is slid or moved together with the device. This also constitutes a protection from mechanical stress of the cable. The present invention will be exemplarily explained in the following with the help of the accompanying drawings in which identical reference numerals refer to similar or identical components. In the partly simplified representations, it applies: FIG. 1 shows in partial longitudinal section a medical dosing apparatus (100) with a device (1) according to the present invention for guiding a cable (3). The device (1) of FIG. 1 is shown exemplarily as a first sleeve or tube. This is in the upper area hereof guided in a connection aperture (5) embodied as a second sleeve or tube. The connection aperture (5) connects the inner area of the dosing apparatus (100) with the outside of the dosing apparatus (100). By virtue of the length of the connection aperture (5) on the one side and the narrow gap between connection aperture (5) and device (1) on the other side, in the example of FIG. 1, the ingress of dripping water, disinfecting agents, or other liquids to the inside of dosing apparatus (100) will be advantageously prevented. The lower end of the device (1) according to the present invention (relative to the embodiment in FIG. 1), is connected to a handle (300)-shaped movable section of the dosing apparatus (100). The lower end of the device (1) is open to the inside of the handle (300). Thus the cable (3) which is connected to a sensor (7) arranged in the handle (300) can be inserted in the device (1) according to the present invention from beneath. The cable (3) can be guided to the exterior together with the device (1) according to the present invention through the second tube- or sleeve-formed connection aperture (5). The sensor (7) is designed in this application example to detect a syringe plunger (9) of a syringe (200) on the handle (300). Thus, the presence, the intended position of the syringe (200) in the dosing apparatus (100) and/or the position of the syringe plunger (9) relative to the syringe (200) or to the dosing apparatus (100) can be detected. A clamping device (13) (of which in FIG. 1 only one part of the in principle two-part clamping device is shown) fixes the syringe plunger (9) in the handle (300). A positioning element (11) is connected to the handle (300). The positioning element (11) is intended to move the handle (300) and with it the syringe plunger (9) with the object of dispensing substances or solutions held within the syringe (200). The positioning element (11) can be connected to a motor, for instance a stepper motor, e.g., at the upper end of the positioning element (11). By means of a suitable motor controller, a pre-determined quantity or rate of medication can be dispensed from the syringe. When or if the positioning element (11) moves forward (in FIG. 1 in an upwards direction), the syringe plunger (9), the device (1) for guiding the cable (3) in addition to the handle (300) will be moved together with the positioning element (11). FIG. 2 shows a cross-sectional view of the dosing apparatus (100) of FIG. 1. The cross section plane lies in the area of the syringe plunger (9). The cross-section of the cable (3) is shown inside the device (1). The connection aperture (5) not shown in FIG. 2, however, is attached above the section plane. The clamping device (13) fixes the syringe plunger (9) in the handle (300) from two sides. FIG. 3 shows the section of the dosing apparatus (100) according to the present invention of FIG. 2 in a two-dimensional view from above (relative to the view in FIG. 2). The cross-section plane corresponds to that shown in FIG. 2 but is however shown in a plan view here. FIG. 4 shows an un-sectioned side view of the dosing apparatus (100) of FIG. 1. From the device (1) according to the present invention, the cable (3) is guided out to the exterior of dosing apparatus (100). The device (1) according to the present invention is in turn inserted through the tube-formed connection aperture (5) and rises out from the interior of the dosing apparatus (100). The device (1) according to the present invention is arranged to be slidable within the connection aperture (5). During operation of the dosing apparatus (100), the following parts and respectively sections will be moved upwards (relative to the view in FIG. 4): the syringe plunger (9), the handle (300), the clamping device (13), the device (1) according to the present invention (guided in the connection aperture (5) which is fixed to the housing of the dosing apparatus (100) and the cable (3) guided in the device (1).
