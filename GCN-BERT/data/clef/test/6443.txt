Intermediate 3: 3-methyl-2,4,5,6-tetrahydropyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrazole
Step 1: tert-butyl 3-methyl-2-((2-(trimethylsilyl)ethoxy)methyl)-4,6-dihydropyrrolo[3,4-c] pyrazole-5(2H)-carboxylate
Tert-butyl 2-((2-(trimethylsilyl)ethoxy)methyl)-4,6-dihydropyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrazole-5(2H)-carboxylate (3.0 g, 8.85 mmol) was dissolved in dried tetrahydrofuran (60 mL), and cooled to -78 Â°C. Thereto was added dropwise a solution of butyl lithium in tetrahydrofuran (2.4 M, 5.5 mL, 13.2 mmol), and stirred at low temperature for 1.5 hours. Methyl iodide (1.90 g, 13.2 mmol) was added dropwise, stirred at low temperature for 5 hours, and then warmed to room temperature. Water (50 mL) was added, and extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic phase was dried, evaporated, and concentrated, and then the residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography to give tert-butyl 3-methyl-2-((2-(trimethylsilyl)ethoxy)methyl)-4,6-dihydropyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrazole-5(2H)-carboxylate (1.5 g). Yield: 48 %.
