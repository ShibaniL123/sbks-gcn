FIELD OF THE INVENTION Described herein are irreversible kinase inhibitor compounds, methods for synthesizing such irreversible inhibitors, and methods for using such irreversible inhibitors in the treatment of diseases. Further described herein are methods, assays and systems for determining an appropriate irreversible inhibitor of a protein, including a kinase. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION A kinase, alternatively known as a phosphotransferase, is a type of enzyme that transfers phosphate groups from high-energy donor molecules, such as ATP, to specific target molecules; the process is termed phosphorylation. Protein kinases, which act on and modify the activity of specific proteins, are used to transmit signals and control complex processes in cells. Up to 518 different kinases have been identified in humans. Their enormous diversity and role in signaling makes them attractive targets for drug design. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Described herein are inhibitors of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk). Also described herein are irreversible inhibitors of Btk. Further described are irreversible inhibitors of Btk that form a covalent bond with a cysteine residue on Btk. Further described herein are irreversible inhibitors of other tyrosine kinases, wherein the other tyrosine kinases share homology with Btk by having a cysteine residue (including a Cys 481 residue) that forms a covalent bond with the irreversible inhibitor (such tyrosine kinases, are referred herein as “Btk tyrosine kinase cysteine homologs”). Also described herein are irreversible inhibitors of tyrosine kinases that have an accessible cysteine residue near an active site of the tyrosine kinase (referred herein as “Accessible Cysteine Kinases” or ACKs). Also described herein are irreversible inhibitors of any of the aforementioned tyrosine kinases, in which the irreversible inhibitor includes a Michael acceptor moiety. Further described are such irreversible inhibitors in which the Michael acceptor moiety preferentially forms a covalent bond with the appropriate cysteine residue on the desired tyrosine kinase relative to forming a covalent bond with other biological molecules that contain an accessible SH moiety. Also described herein are methods for synthesizing such irreversible inhibitors, methods for using such irreversible inhibitors in the treatment of diseases (including diseases wherein irreversible inhibition of Btk provides therapeutic benefit to a patient having the disease). Further described are pharmaceutical formulations that include an irreversible inhibitor of Btk. Compounds described herein include those that have a structure of any of Formula (A1-A6), Formula (B1-B6), Formula (C1-C6), Formula (D1-D6), Formula (I), or Formula (VII), and pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates, esters, acids and prodrugs thereof.

Unless otherwise indicated, conventional methods of mass spectroscopy, NMR, HPLC, protein chemistry, biochemistry, recombinant DNA techniques and pharmacology, within the skill of the art are employed. Unless specific definitions are provided, the nomenclature employed in connection with, and the laboratory procedures and techniques of, analytical chemistry, synthetic organic chemistry, and medicinal and pharmaceutical chemistry described herein are those known in the art. Standard techniques are optionally used for chemical syntheses, chemical analyses, pharmaceutical preparation, formulation, and delivery, and treatment of patients. Standard techniques are optionally used for recombinant DNA, oligonucleotide synthesis, and tissue culture and transformation (e.g., electroporation, lipofection). Reactions and purification techniques are performed using documented methodologies or as described herein.

It is also to be understood that the terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only, and is not intended to limit the scope of the methods and compositions described herein, which will be limited only by the appended claims. Unless stated otherwise, the terms used for complex moieties (i.e., multiple chains of moieties) are to be read equivalently either from left to right or right to left. For example, the group alkylenecycloalkylene refers both to an alkylene group followed by a cycloalkylene group or as a cycloalkylene group followed by an alkylene group. The suffix “ene” appended to a group indicates that such a group is a diradical. By way of example only, a methylene is a diradical of a methyl group, that is, it is a —CH2— group; and an ethylene is a diradical of an ethyl group, i.e., —CH2CH2—. An “alkyl” group refers to an aliphatic hydrocarbon group. The alkyl moiety includes a “saturated alkyl” group, which means that it does not contain any alkene or alkyne moieties. The alkyl moiety also includes an “unsaturated alkyl” moiety, which means that it contains at least one alkene or alkyne moiety. An “alkene” moiety refers to a group that has at least one carbon-carbon double bond, and an “alkyne” moiety refers to a group that has at least one carbon-carbon triple bond.

The term “alkynyl” refers to a type of alkyl group in which the first two atoms of the alkyl group form a triple bond. That is, an alkynyl group begins with the atoms —C≡C—R, wherein R refers to the remaining portions of the alkynyl group, which is either the same or different. The “R” portion of the alkynyl moiety may be branched, straight chain, or cyclic. Depending on the structure, an alkynyl group includes a monoradical or a diradical (i.e., an alkynylene group).

The term “fused” refers to structures in which two or more rings share one or more bonds. The term “carbocyclic” or “carbocycle” refers to a ring wherein each of the atoms forming the ring is a carbon atom. Carbocycle includes aryl and cycloalkyl.

Designations such as “C1-C6 heterocycle” refer only to the number of carbon atoms in the ring and do not refer to the total number of atoms in the ring. It is understood that the heterocylic ring can have additional heteroatoms in the ring. Designations such as “4-6 membered heterocycle” refer to the total number of atoms that are contained in the ring (i.e., a four, five, or six membered ring, in which at least one atom is a carbon atom, at least one atom is a heteroatom and the remaining two to four atoms are either carbon atoms or heteroatoms). In heterocycles that have two or more heteroatoms, those two or more heteroatoms can be the same or different from one another. Heterocycles can be optionally substituted.

FIG. 2 presents an illustrative line graph showing inhibition of collagen-induced arthritis in male DBA/1OlaHsd mice. Compound for vehicle was dosed orally once per day starting at day 1. Dexamethasone was included as a positive control. Paw inflammation was scored from 0-5 and averaged across all paws from all animals for each group in the study. Compound 1 at 12.5 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg regressed inflammation through the end of the study (day 11) while 3.125 mg/kg significantly reduced the increase in paw inflammation. FIG. 3 presents an illustrative line graph showing inhibition of disease progression in a mouse MRL/lpr model of lupus. MRL/lpr mice (Jax strain 000485) were dosed orally once per day from 8 weeks of age until 20 weeks of age and urine protein levels were measured weekly. Compound 1 at 3.125 mg/kg, 12.5 mg/kg, and 50 mg/kg significantly reduced proteinuria, indicating amelioration of the progressive autoimmune renal failure seen in this mouse strain. FIG. 4 presents an illustrative bar graph showing inhibition of mast cell degranulation in a mouse passive cutaneous anaphylaxis model. 23 hours after mice were sensitized with an intradermal injection of monoclonal anti-DNP-IgE in the back, they received a single oral dose of Compound 1 or vehicle. After one hour, animals were challenged with an intravenous injection of DNP-BSA and Evans Blue dye and the area of extravasation was measured. Increasing doses of Compound 1 significantly decreased the amount of Evans Blue release, indicating decreased mast cell activation and vascular permeabilization. FIG. 5 presents an illustrative line graph showing in vivo plasma concentrations post-dosing of male jugular vein cannulated rats with Compounds 1, 7, 8, and 12. Blood samples were collected at 0.0833 (5 minutes), 0.333 (20 minutes), 1, 3, 6, 9, and 24 hours post-dosing from orally dosed rats. Compound 1 and Compound 12 have a short half-life in vivo. In contrast, Compound 7 and Compound 8 have a significantly longer in vivo half-life. Compounds like 1 and 12 are predicted to have enhanced kinase selectivity in vivo because inhibition will be sustained only for those kinases that are irreversibly inhibited. FIG. 6 presents an illustrative bar graph showing brief exposure to Compound 1 in vitro is sufficient to inhibit B cell activation in normal human B cells. B cells were purified from blood from healthy donors by negative selecting using the RosetteSep Human B cell enrichment cocktail. Cells were plated in growth media and indicated concentrations of Compound 1 were added. After incubation for 1 hour at 37° C., cells were washed three times using an 8-fold dilution in growth media for each wash. Cells were then stimulated with IgM F(ab′)2 for 18 hours at 37° C., stained with anti-CD69-PE antibody and analyzed by flow cytometry. This protocol mimics the predicted exposure of cells to Compound 1 in vivo and demonstrates that inhibition of B cells is sustained despite washing out of Compound 1. FIG. 7 presents illustrative ACKs, including Btk and Btk cysteine homologs. FIG. 7 discloses SEQ ID NOS: 2-14, respectively, in order of appearance. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Irreversible Inhibitor Compounds In the following description of irreversible kinase inhibitor compounds suitable for use in the methods described herein, definitions of referred-to standard chemistry terms may be found in reference works (if not otherwise defined herein), including Carey and Sundberg “Advanced Organic Chemistry 4th Ed.” Vols. A (2000) and B (2001), Plenum Press, New York. In addition, nucleic acid and amino acid sequences for Btk (e.g., human Btk) are disclosed in, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,326,469. Unless specific definitions are provided, the nomenclature employed in connection with, and the laboratory procedures and techniques of, analytical chemistry, synthetic organic chemistry, and medicinal and pharmaceutical chemistry described herein are those known in the art. Standard techniques can be used for chemical syntheses, chemical analyses, pharmaceutical preparation, formulation, and delivery, and treatment of patients The inhibitor compounds described herein are selective for kinases having an accessible cysteine residue (such kinases are also known as Accessible Cysteine Kinases, or ACKs) that can form a covalent bond with a Michael acceptor moiety on the inhibitor compound. In some embodiments, the cysteine residue is accessible or becomes accessible when the binding site moiety of the irreversible inhibitor binds to the kinase. That is, the binding site moiety of the irreversible inhibitor binds to an active site of the ACK and the Michael acceptor moiety of irreversible inhibitor gains access (in one embodiment the step of binding leads to a conformational change in the ACK, thus exposing the cysteine) or is otherwise exposed to the cysteine residue of the ACK; as a result a covalent bond is formed between the “S” of the cysteine residue and the Michael acceptor of the irreversible inhibitor. Consequently, the binding site moiety of the irreversible inhibitor remains bound or otherwise blocks the active site of the ACK. In one embodiment, the ACK is Btk, a homolog of Btk or a tyrosine kinase having a cysteine residue in an amino acid sequence position that is homologous to the amino acid sequence position of cysteine 481 in Btk. See, e.g., kinases in FIG. 7. Inhibitor compounds described herein include a Michael acceptor moiety, a binding site moiety and a linker that links the binding site moiety and the Michael acceptor moiety (and in some embodiments, the structure of the linker provides a conformation, or otherwise directs the Michael acceptor moiety, so as to improve the selectivity of the irreversible inhibitor for a particular ACK). Generally, an irreversible inhibitor compound used in the methods described herein is identified or characterized in an in vitro assay, e.g., an acellular biochemical assay or a cellular functional assay. Such assays are useful to determine an in vitro IC50 for an irreversible inhibitor compound. For example, an acellular kinase assay can be used to determine kinase activity after incubation of the kinase in the absence or presence of a range of concentrations of a candidate irreversible inhibitor compound. If the candidate compound is in fact an irreversible inhibitor, kinase activity will not be recovered by repeat washing with inhibitor-free medium. See, e.g., J. B. Smaill, et al. (1999), J. Med. Chem. 42(10):1803-1815. Further, covalent complex formation between a Kinase and a candidate irreversible inhibitor is a useful indicator of irreversible inhibition of the Kinase that can be readily determined by a number of methods (e.g., mass spectrometry). For example, some irreversible Kinase-inhibitor compounds can form a covalent bond with the aforenoted cysteine residue (e.g., via a Michael reaction). High throughput assays for many acellular biochemical assays (e.g., kinase assays) and cellular functional assays (e.g., calcium flux) are documented methodologies. In addition, high throughput screening systems are commercially available (see, e.g., Zymark Corp., Hopkinton, Mass.; Air Technical Industries, Mentor, Ohio; Beckman Instruments, Inc. Fullerton, Calif.; Precision Systems, Inc., Natick, Mass., etc.). These systems typically automate entire procedures including all sample and reagent pipetting, liquid dispensing, timed incubations, and final readings of the microplate in detector(s) appropriate for the assay. Automated systems thereby allow the identification and characterization of a large number of irreversible compounds. Irreversible inhibitor compounds can used for the manufacture of a medicament for treating any of the foregoing conditions (e.g., autoimmune diseases, inflammatory diseases, allergy disorders, B-cell proliferative disorders, or thromboembolic disorders). In some embodiments, the irreversible inhibitor compound used for the methods described herein inhibits a Kinase activity with an in vitro IC50 of less than 10 μM. (e.g., less than 1 μM, less than 0.5 μM, less than 0.4 μM, less than 0.3 μM, less than 0.1, less than 0.08 μM, less than 0.06 μM, less than 0.05 μM, less than 0.04 μM, less than 0.03 μM, less than less than 0.02 μM less than 0.01, less than 0.008 μM, less than 0.006 μM, less than 0.005 μM, less than 0.004 μM, less than 0.003 μM less than less than 0.002 μM less than 0.001, less than 0.00099 μM less than 0.00098 μM, less than 0.00097 μM, less than 0.00096 μM, less than 0.00095 μM, less than 0.00094 μM less than 0.00093 μM less than 0.00092, or less than 0.00090 μM). In one embodiment, the irreversible inhibitor compound selectively and irreversibly inhibits an activated form of its target tyrosine kinase (e.g., a phosphorylated form of the tyrosine kinase). For example, activated Btk is transphosphorylated at tyrosine 551. Thus, in these embodiments the irreversible Btk inhibitor inhibits the target kinase in cells only once the target kinase is activated by the signaling events.

Protecting groups are used to block some or all reactive moieties and prevent such groups from participating in chemical reactions until the protective group is removed. In one embodiment, each protective group be removable by a different means. Protective groups that are cleaved under totally disparate reaction conditions fulfill the requirement of differential removal. Protective groups can be removed by acid, base, and hydrogenolysis. Groups such as trityl, dimethoxytrityl, acetal and t-butyldimethylsilyl are acid labile and may be used to protect carboxy and hydroxy reactive moieties in the presence of amino groups protected with Cbz groups, which are removable by hydrogenolysis, and Fmoc groups, which are base labile. Carboxylic acid and hydroxy reactive moieties may be blocked with base labile groups such as, but not limited to, methyl, ethyl, and acetyl in the presence of amines blocked with acid labile groups such as t-butyl carbamate or with carbamates that are both acid and base stable but hydrolytically removable. Carboxylic acid and hydroxy reactive moieties may also be blocked with hydrolytically removable protective groups such as the benzyl group, while amine groups capable of hydrogen bonding with acids may be blocked with base labile groups such as Fmoc. Carboxylic acid reactive moieties may be protected by conversion to simple ester compounds as exemplified herein, or they may be blocked with oxidatively-removable protective groups such as 2,4-dimethoxybenzyl, while co-existing amino groups may be blocked with fluoride labile silyl carbamates. Allyl blocking groups are useful in then presence of acid- and base-protecting groups since the former are stable and can be subsequently removed by metal or pi-acid catalysts. For example, an allyl-blocked carboxylic acid can be deprotected with a Pd-catalyzed reaction in the presence of acid labile t-butyl carbamate or base-labile acetate amine protecting groups. Yet another form of protecting group is a resin to which a compound or intermediate may be attached. As long as the residue is attached to the resin, that functional group is blocked and cannot react. Once released from the resin, the functional group is available to react. Typically blocking/protecting groups may be selected from: Other protecting groups, plus a detailed description of techniques applicable to the creation of protecting groups and their removal are described in Greene and Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 3rd Ed., John Wiley & Sons, New York, N.Y., 1999, and Kocienski, Protective Groups, Thieme Verlag, New York, N.Y., 1994, which are incorporated herein by reference for such disclosure.

Further Forms of Compounds Compounds disclosed herein have a structure of any of Formula (A1-A6), Formula (B1-B6), Formula (C1-C6), Formula (D1-D6), Formula (I), or Formula (VII). It is understood that when reference is made to compounds described herein, it is meant to include compounds of any of Formula (A1-A6), Formula (B1-B6), Formula (C1-C6), Formula (D1-D6), Formula (I), or Formula (VII), as well as to all of the specific compounds that fall within the scope of these generic formulae, unless otherwise indicated. The compounds described herein may possess one or more stereocenters and each center may exist in the R or S configuration. The compounds presented herein include all diastereomeric, enantiomeric, and epimeric forms as well as the appropriate mixtures thereof. Stereoisomers may be obtained, if desired, by methods such as, for example, the separation of stereoisomers by chiral chromatographic columns. Diasteromeric mixtures can be separated into their individual diastereomers on the basis of their physical chemical differences by methods known, for example, by chromatography and/or fractional crystallization. In one embodiment, enantiomers can be separated by chiral chromatographic columns. In other embodiments, enantiomers can be separated by converting the enantiomeric mixture into a diastereomeric mixture by reaction with an appropriate optically active compound (e.g., alcohol), separating the diastereomers and converting (e.g., hydrolyzing) the individual diastereomers to the corresponding pure enantiomers. All such isomers, including diastereomers, enantiomers, and mixtures thereof are considered as part of the compositions described herein. The methods and formulations described herein include the use of N-oxides, crystalline forms (also known as polymorphs), or pharmaceutically acceptable salts of compounds described herein, as well as active metabolites of these compounds having the same type of activity. In some situations, compounds exist as tautomers. All tautomers are included within the scope of the compounds presented herein. In addition, the compounds described herein can exist in unsolvated as well as solvated forms with pharmaceutically acceptable solvents such as water, ethanol, and the like. The solvated forms of the compounds presented herein are also considered to be disclosed herein. Compounds of any of Formula (A1-A6), Formula (B1-B6), Formula (C1-C6), Formula (D1-D6), Formula (I), or Formula (VII) in unoxidized form can be prepared from N-oxides of compounds of any of Formula (A1-A6), Formula (B1-B6), Formula (C1-C6), Formula (D1-D6), Formula (I), or Formula (VII) by treating with a reducing agent, such as, but not limited to, sulfur, sulfur dioxide, triphenyl phosphine, lithium borohydride, sodium borohydride, phosphorus trichloride, tribromide, or the like in a suitable inert organic solvent, such as, but not limited to, acetonitrile, ethanol, aqueous dioxane, or the like at 0 to 80° C. In some embodiments, compounds described herein are prepared as prodrugs. A “prodrug” refers to an agent that is converted into the parent drug in vivo. Prodrugs are often useful because, in some situations, they may be easier to administer than the parent drug. They may, for instance, be bioavailable by oral administration whereas the parent is not. The prodrug may also have improved solubility in pharmaceutical compositions over the parent drug. An example, without limitation, of a prodrug is a compound described herein, which is administered as an ester (the “prodrug”) to facilitate transmittal across a cell membrane where water solubility is detrimental to mobility but which then is metabolically hydrolyzed to the carboxylic acid, the active entity, once inside the cell where water-solubility is beneficial. A further example of a prodrug is a short peptide (polyaminoacid) bonded to an acid group where the peptide is metabolized to reveal the active moiety. In certain embodiments, upon in vivo administration, a prodrug is chemically converted to the biologically, pharmaceutically or therapeutically active form of the compound. In certain embodiments, a prodrug is enzymatically metabolized by one or more steps or processes to the biologically, pharmaceutically or therapeutically active form of the compound. To produce a prodrug, a pharmaceutically active compound is modified such that the active compound will be regenerated upon in vivo administration. The prodrug can be designed to alter the metabolic stability or the transport characteristics of a drug, to mask side effects or toxicity, to improve the flavor of a drug or to alter other characteristics or properties of a drug. By virtue of knowledge of pharmacodynamic processes and drug metabolism in vivo, once a pharmaceutically active compound is known, prodrugs of compounds can be designed (if desired) (for examples of this procedure applied to other compounds, see, e.g., Nogrady (1985) Medicinal Chemistry A Biochemical Approach, Oxford University Press, New York, pages 388-392; Silverman (1992), The Organic Chemistry of Drug Design and Drug Action, Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, pages 352-401, Saulnier et al., (1994), Bioorganic and Medicinal Chemistry Letters, Vol. 4, p. 1985). Prodrug forms of the herein described compounds, wherein the prodrug is metabolized in vivo to produce a derivative as set forth herein are included within the scope of the claims. In some cases, some of the compounds herein-described are prodrugs for another derivative or active compound. Prodrugs are often useful because, in some situations, they are easier to administer than the parent drug. They are, for instance, bioavailable by oral administration whereas the parent is not. The prodrug optionally has improved solubility in pharmaceutical compositions over the parent drug. Prodrugs may be designed as reversible drug derivatives, for use as modifiers to enhance drug transport to site-specific tissues. In some embodiments, the design of a prodrug increases the effective water solubility. See, e.g., Fedorak et al., Am. J. Physiol., 269:G210-218 (1995); McLoed et al., Gastroenterol, 106:405-413 (1994); Hochhaus et al., Biomed. Chrom., 6:283-286 (1992); J. Larsen and H. Bundgaard, Int. J.

Sites on the aromatic ring portion of compounds of any of Formula (A1-A6), Formula (B1-B6), Formula (C1-C6), Formula (D1-D6), Formula (I), or Formula (VII) can be susceptible to various metabolic reactions, therefore incorporation of appropriate substituents on the aromatic ring structures, such as, by way of example only, halogens can reduce, minimize or eliminate this metabolic pathway. Compounds described herein include isotopically-labeled compounds, which are identical to those recited in the various formulas and structures presented herein, but for the fact that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into the present compounds include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine and chlorine, such as 2H, 3H, 13C, 14C, 15N, 18O, 17O 35S, 18F, 36Cl, respectively. Certain isotopically-labeled compounds described herein, for example those into which radioactive isotopes such as 3H and 14C are incorporated, are useful in drug and/or substrate tissue distribution assays. Further, substitution with isotopes such as deuterium, i.e., 2H, can afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements. In additional or further embodiments, the compounds described herein are metabolized upon administration to an organism in need to produce a metabolite that is then used to produce a desired effect, including a desired therapeutic effect. Compounds described herein (for example, compounds of any of Formula (A1-A6), Formula (B1-B6), Formula (C1-C6), Formula (D1-D6), Formula (I), or Formula (VII)) are optionally in the form of, and/or used as, pharmaceutically acceptable salts.

The salts are recovered by using at least one of the following techniques: filtration, precipitation with a non-solvent followed by filtration, evaporation of the solvent, or, in the case of aqueous solutions, lyophilization. It should be understood that a reference to a pharmaceutically acceptable salt includes the solvent addition forms or crystal forms thereof, particularly solvates or polymorphs. Solvates contain either stoichiometric or non-stoichiometric amounts of a solvent, and are optionally formed during the process of crystallization with pharmaceutically acceptable solvents such as water, ethanol, and the like.

Solvates of compounds described herein can be conveniently prepared or formed during the processes described herein. In addition, the compounds provided herein can exist in unsolvated as well as solvated forms. In general, the solvated forms are considered equivalent to the unsolvated forms for the purposes of the compounds and methods provided herein. It should be understood that a reference to a salt includes the solvent addition forms or crystal forms thereof, particularly solvates or polymorphs. Solvates contain either stoichiometric or non-stoichiometric amounts of a solvent, and are often formed during the process of crystallization with pharmaceutically acceptable solvents such as water, ethanol, and the like. Hydrates are formed when the solvent is water, or alcoholates are formed when the solvent is alcohol. Polymorphs include the different crystal packing arrangements of the same elemental composition of a compound. Polymorphs usually have different X-ray diffraction patterns, infrared spectra, melting points, density, hardness, crystal shape, optical and electrical properties, stability, and solubility. Various factors such as the recrystallization solvent, rate of crystallization, and storage temperature may cause a single crystal form to dominate. Compounds described herein are optionally in various forms, including but not limited to, amorphous forms, milled forms and nano-particulate forms. In addition, compounds described herein include crystalline forms, also known as polymorphs. Polymorphs include the different crystal packing arrangements of the same elemental composition of a compound. Polymorphs usually have different X-ray diffraction patterns, infrared spectra, melting points, density, hardness, crystal shape, optical and electrical properties, stability, and solubility. Various factors such as the recrystallization solvent, rate of crystallization, and storage temperature may cause a single crystal form to dominate. The screening and characterization of the pharmaceutically acceptable salts, polymorphs and/or solvates may be accomplished using a variety of techniques including, but not limited to, thermal analysis, x-ray diffraction, spectroscopy, vapor sorption, and microscopy.

Cysteine-Targeted Kinase Inhibitor Discovery Platform Kinases/Inhibitors SAR Approach Protein kinases, which act on and modify the activity of specific proteins, are used to transmit signals and control complex processes in cells. Up to 518 different kinases have been identified in humans. Many kinase inhibitor compounds non-selectively bind and/or inhibit these kinases because the active sites of some of these kinases are similar in structure. Such cross-reactivity is not a desired feature of a kinase inhibitor compound because of the potential for undesired side effects when such a compound is being administered to treat a disease or condition. We have observed that small differences in the structure of kinase inhibitor compounds have profound effects in the selectivity of similarly-structured kinases (e.g., ACKs, including, Btk and the Btk kinase cysteine homologs). As a result, we have developed assays, methods, and systems for converting a non-selective inhibitor compound into a highly-selective inhibitor compound. In brief, the non-selective inhibitor compound is provided with a Michael acceptor moiety and a linker moiety that links the Michael acceptor moiety to the remainder of the non-selective inhibitor compound. A series of linker and Michael acceptor moieties provides a small library/panel of test inhibitor compounds. The inhibitor library/panel is contacted with a panel of structurally related kinases (e.g., Btk and the Btk kinase cysteine homologs). Binding is determined by a variety of means, included fluorescence detection (or via any other detectable label), mass spectrometry, or a combination of approaches. An Activity Probe is optionally used to detect binding of members of the inhibitor library/panel to the kinase library/panel. The binding data is then optionally collected and analyzed to provide a structure-activity relationship (SAR) between the structure of the members of the inhibitor panel/library (e.g., Michael acceptor and/or linker moieties) and the activity of binding to and/or inhibiting members of the kinase panel. Based on this information, further modifications are suggested if necessary. We have successfully used this approach to improve the binding and selectivity of Btk inhibitor compounds (see Examples herein, including “Kinase Inhibitor Discovery Platform” example section). A similar approach can be use for converting a selective inhibitor compound for a group of similarly-structured ACKs (including, Btk and the Btk kinase cysteine homologs) into a more highly-selective inhibitor compound (e.g., more selective for a particular ACK over structurally-similar ACKs), or for converting a selective inhibitor compound for a particular ACK (e.g., Btk) into an even more selective inhibitor of that particular ACK. For example, in brief, the selective inhibitor compound (which, for example, contains an active-site binding moiety, a linker moiety and a Michael acceptor moiety) is modified. In one embodiment, a series of linker and Michael acceptor moieties provides a small library/panel of test inhibitor compounds. The inhibitor library/panel is contacted with a panel of structurally related kinases (e.g., Btk and the Btk kinase cysteine homologs). Binding is determined by a variety of means, included fluorescence detection (or via any other detectable label), mass spectrometry, or a combination of approaches. An Activity Probe is optionally used to detect binding of members of the inhibitor library/panel to the kinase library/panel. The binding data is then optionally collected and analyzed to provide a structure-activity relationship (SAR) between the structure of the members of the inhibitor panel/library (e.g., Michael acceptor and/or linker moieties) and the activity of binding to and/or inhibiting members of the kinase panel. Based on this information, further modifications are suggested if necessary. We have also successfully used this approach to improve the binding and selectivity of Btk inhibitor compounds (see Examples herein, including “Kinase Inhibitor Discovery Platform” example section). Thus, for our highly selective BTK inhibitor Compound 1, we engineered an electrophilic center capable of irreversibly inactivating the target enzyme, BTK. That is, to an active site binding moiety of a reversible inhibitor was added a linker moiety and a Michael acceptor moiety that achieved a high degree of potency and selectivity by (1) fitting the core scaffold into the active site ATP binding pocket of kinase enzymes, and (2) forming a covalent bond with Cysteine-481 located in BTK. The chemistry required for covalent bond formation involves an electrophilic moiety that acts as a Michael acceptor, which bonds with a nucleophile (such as Cys-481) present in a precise location within the active site. In another example, the linker and Michael acceptor moiety of Compound 1 was modified to provide Compound 9 which has a different selectivity pattern. Table 1 is a table showing the degree of inhibition of a panel of kinases for two example compounds. IC50s were determined using the in vitro HotSpot kinase assay (purified enzymes, 33P-ATP, an appropriate substrate and 1 μM ATP.) Compared to Compound 1, Compound 9 has similar potency toward Btk, but significantly less potency toward JAK-3, ITK, and EGFR and significantly more potency toward the src-family kinases lck, c-src, FGR, Fyn, Hck, and Lyn and Yes. Thus, subtle modifications in the linker moiety and the Michael acceptor moiety are important for the design of selective ACK inhibitors.

Thus, in one aspect described herein are methods of identifying an irreversible inhibitor of a kinase selected from Btk, a Btk homolog, or a Btk kinase cysteine homolog (or indeed, any ACK) comprising: (1) contacting a multiplicity of kinases selected from Btk, a Btk homolog, or a Btk kinase cysteine homolog (or indeed any ACK) with a compound that comprises a Michael acceptor moiety;(2) contacting at least one non-kinase molecule having at least one accessible SH group with the compound that comprises a Michael acceptor moiety (this step allows for the selection of inhibitors that have low selectivity for higher abundance biological molecules that have moieties that irreversibly react with the inhibitor; thus preventing the inhibitor from binding to the desire ACK when administered as a drug to a patient); and(3) determining the covalent binding of the compound that comprises a Michael acceptor with the multiplicity of kinases and the at least one non-kinase molecule; and repeating steps (1), (2), and (3) for at least one other compound that comprises a Michael acceptor moiety. In a further aspect, the following steps are added: (4) comparing the covalent binding of the compound that comprises a Michael acceptor with the multiplicity of kinases and the at least one non-kinase molecule; and repeating steps (1), (2), (3) and (4) for at least one other compound that comprises a Michael acceptor moiety. In a further aspect the irreversible inhibitor compounds are also contacted with at least one non-ACK kinase in order to determine the selectivity of the irreversible inhibitor compound for the ACK relative to the non-ACK. By way of certain relevant examples of non-kinase molecules with at least one accessible SH group are glutathione and/or hemoglobin. Because of the high abundance of these molecules in typical biological systems (e.g., in a patient), the desired irreversible inhibitor compounds have low selectivity/reactivity with these non-kinase molecules. In certain embodiments of the Kinase Inhibitor Discovery Platform, an Activity Probe (described in more detail herein) is used as a rapid diagnostic method for determining whether a test inhibitor compound has irreversibly inhibited an ACK. In one embodiment, the Activity Probe is itself an irreversible inhibitor of an ACK, and further, has a reporter moiety (e.g., a fluorescent moiety) as part of its structure. When used in competition with a test irreversible inhibitor, the absence of a ‘reporter’ signal on an ACK is one indication that the test irreversible inhibitor has prevented the Activity Probe from binding to the ACK (and that the test irreversible inhibitor has a higher binding affinity for the ACK than the Activity Probe). In certain embodiments, the Kinase Inhibitor Discovery Platform, steps (1) and (2) are conducted in vivo and step (3) is conducted in part using an Activity Probe. Further, in certain embodiments, the determining step uses mass spectrometry, fluorescence, or a combination thereof. As described herein, in one embodiment, the inhibitor tested with the Kinase Inhibitor Discovery Platform comprise an active site binding moiety, a Michael acceptor moiety, and a linker moiety that links the Michael acceptor moiety to the active site binding moiety. For example, in such a scheme, the following information is collected and analyzed: the structure-function activity relationship between the structure of the linker moiety and/or the Michael acceptor moiety of each compound, and the binding and/or selectivity of each compound to at least one kinase. Further, in certain embodiments, structure of the active site binding moiety of each compound is not varied, whereas the structure of the linker moiety and/or the Michael acceptor moiety is varied. In one example, the inhibitors have the structure of Formula (VII): wherein: wherein is a moiety that binds to the active site of a kinase, including a tyrosine kinase, further including a Btk kinase cysteine homolog; Y is an optionally substituted group selected from among alkylene, heteroalkylene, arylene, heteroarylene, heterocycloalkylene, cycloalkylene, alkylenearylene, alkyleneheteroarylene, alkylenecycloalkylene, and alkyleneheterocycloalkylene;Z is C(═O), OC(═O), NHC(═O), NCH3C(═O), C(═S), S(═O)x, OS(═O)x, NHS(═O)x, where x is 1 or 2;R7 and R8 are independently selected from among H, unsubstituted C1-C4 alkyl, substituted C1-C4alkyl, unsubstituted C1-C4heteroalkyl, substituted C1-C4heteroalkyl, unsubstituted C3-C6cycloalkyl, substituted C3-C6cycloalkyl, unsubstituted C2-C6heterocycloalkyl, and substituted C2-C6heterocycloalkyl; orR7 and R8 taken together form a bond; andR6 is H, substituted or unsubstituted C1-C4alkyl, substituted or unsubstituted C1-C4heteroalkyl, C1-C6alkoxyalkyl, C1-C8alkylaminoalkyl, C1-C8hydroxyalkylaminoalkyl, C1-C8alkoxyalkylaminoalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted C3-C6cycloalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted aryl, substituted or unsubstituted C2-C8heterocycloalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted heteroaryl, C1-C4alkyl(aryl), C1-C4alkyl(heteroaryl), C1-C4alkyl(C3-C8cycloalkyl), or C1-C4alkyl(C2-C8heterocycloalkyl). In such a scheme, the following information is collected and analyzed: the structure-function activity relationship between the structure of Y—Z and/or of each compound, and the binding and/or selectivity of each compound to at least one kinase. Further, the structure of of each compound is not varied, whereas the structure of the linker moiety (Y—Z) and/or the Michael acceptor moiety is varied. In certain embodiments of the Kinase Inhibitor Discovery Platform, the resulting inhibitor is selective for one kinase selected from Btk, a Btk homolog, and a Btk kinase cysteine homolog over at least one other kinase selected from Btk, a Btk homolog, and a Btk kinase cysteine homolog. In some embodiments, this selectivity is at least 5×, at least 10×, at least 20×, at least 50×, or at least 100×. In further embodiments, the resulting inhibitor is selective for at least one kinase selected from Btk, a Btk homolog, and a Btk kinase cysteine homolog over at least one other non-kinase molecule having an accessible SH group. In some embodiments, this selectivity is at least 5×, at least 10×, at least 20×, at least 50×, or at least 100×. In further embodiments, the resulting inhibitor is used in the therapeutic methods described herein, or in the pharmaceutical compositions described herein. Activity Probe Compounds Because of the Kinase Inhibitor Discovery Platform described herein optionally utilizes an Activity Probe, the following section describes the design, structure and use of non-limiting examples of Activity Probes. The Activity Probe compounds described herein are composed of a moiety comprising an inhibitor of Btk, a Btk homolog and/or a Btk kinase cysteine homolog (hereinafter, a “Kinase Inhibitor”), a linker moiety, and a reporter moiety. In one embodiment, the Kinase Inhibitor is an irreversible inhibitor. In another embodiment, the irreversible Kinase Inhibitor binds to a non-catalytic residue in the ATP binding pocket of Btk, a Btk homolog and/or a Btk kinase cysteine homolog (hereinafter a “Kinase”); in further embodiments, the non-catalytic residue is a cysteine residue. In some embodiments, the Activity Probe forms a covalent bond with at least one non-catalytic residue of a Kinase. In other embodiments, the Activity Probe forms a non-covalent bond with at least one non-catalytic residue of a Kinase. In a further embodiment, the Activity Probe forms hydrogen bonding within the ATP binding pocket of a Kinase. In yet a further embodiment, the Activity Probe has Van der Waals attractions with the Kinase. In some other embodiments, the Activity Probes described herein are activity dependent such that the probe binds only an active Kinase. In further embodiments, the Activity Probe binds a Kinase that has been switched on by phosphorylation by upstream kinases. In yet a further embodiment, the Activity Probes described herein are activity independent such that the probe binds Kinases that have not been switched on by phosphorylation by upstream kinases. In some embodiments, the Activity Probe labels a phosphorylated conformation of a Kinase. In other embodiments, the Activity Probe labels a Kinase in a non-phosphorylated conformation. In some embodiments, the Activity Probe is permeable to cells. In further embodiments, the linker moiety is selected from a bond, a substituted alkyl moiety, a substituted heterocycle moiety, a substituted amide moiety, a ketone moiety, a substituted carbamate moiety, an ester moiety, or any combination thereof. In further embodiments, the reporter moiety is a moiety that is detected using standard or modified laboratory equipment. In one aspect is a Activity Probe of Formula (I) comprising: wherein: A is a Kinase Inhibitor moiety; X and Y are independently selected from the group consisting of: a bond, —O(C═O)—, —NRa(C═O)—, —NRa—, —O—, —S—, —S—S—, —O—NRa—, —O(C═O)O—, —O(C═O)NRa, —NRa(C═O)NRa—, —N═CRa—, —S(C═O)—, —S(O)—, and —S(O)2—; wherein forms a N-containing heterocycle; B is a linker moiety;C is a reporter moiety; andRa is hydrogen or alkyl. In one embodiment, the moiety comprising an irreversible Kinase Inhibitor is derived from an irreversible inhibitor of a Kinase.

By way of example only and in some embodiments, the observed potency, selectivity, and cell permeability of compounds such as Compound 2 are appropriate to incorporate these molecules into a Kinase-targeted, activity based probe that allows direct visualization of Kinase activity in intact cells. In vitro profiling against a panel of greater than 100 kinases showed Compound 2 to be a highly potent and selective inhibitor of Tec family kinases, including, Btk, as well as Src family kinases. Without limiting the scope of the compositions and methods described herein, it is postulated that the structural basis for the selectivity is covalent modification of a non-catalytic cysteine residue (Cys 481 in Btk) that is conserved in the ATP binding pocket of the Tec family and several other kinases. However, in other embodiments, any irreversible Kinase Inhibitor that binds to the non-catalytic cysteine residue in the ATP binding pocket of a Kinase is used in the compounds and methods described herein. General Synthesis and Characterization of an Illustrative Activity Probe Without limiting the scope of the compositions described herein, an illustrative probe was synthesized by attaching a bodipy FL fluorophore to an irreversible inhibitor via a piperazine linker. The piperazine linker served to maintain probe solubility and provided spatial separation between the fluorophore and the pyrazolopyrimidine core. In some embodiments, the linkage formed is a stable linkage. In other embodiments, in the case where the conjugate comprises two components, the linker moiety forms a linkage, in some embodiments, a stable linkage, between the Kinase Inhibitor moiety and the reporter moiety. In some embodiments, the linker moiety is stable and provides the means to control and determine the distance between the Kinase Inhibitor moiety and the report moiety. Further, in some embodiments, the linker moiety is selected such that the probe's solubility is maintained. In some embodiments, the linker moiety is a piperazinyl moiety. In further embodiments, a piperazinyl-based linkage is formed by using a piperazine containing compound. In other embodiments, the number and order of units that comprise the linker moiety is selected such that the length between the first component and the second component, as well as the hydrophobic and hydrophilic characteristics of the linker is controlled. In the present context, spatial separation means a thermochemically and photochemically non-active distance-making group and in some embodiments is used to join two or more different moieties of the types defined above. In other embodiments, spacers are selected on the basis of a variety of characteristics including their hydrophobicity, hydrophilicity, molecular flexibility and length. The spacer, thus, in some embodiments, comprises a chain of carbon atoms optionally interrupted or terminated with one or more heteroatoms, such as oxygen atoms, nitrogen atoms, and/or sulphur atoms. Thus, in some embodiments, the spacer comprises one or more amide, ester, amino, ether, and/or thioether functionalities, and optionally aromatic or mono/polyunsaturated hydrocarbons, polyoxyethylene such as polyethylene glycol, oligo/polyamides such as poly-.α-alanine, polyglycine, polylysine, and peptides in general, oligosaccharides, oligo/polyphosphates. Moreover, in other embodiments, the spacer consists of combined units thereof. In further embodiments, the length of the spacer varies, taking into consideration the desired or necessary positioning and spatial orientation of the active/functional part of the Activity Probe. Without limiting the scope of the compositions described herein, in some embodiments the reporter moiety is Bodipy. In the present context, the term reporter moiety means a group which is detectable either by itself or as a part of a detection series. In some embodiments, the labeled Activity Probes described herein are purified by one or more procedures including, but are not limited to, affinity chromatography; anion- or cation-exchange chromatography (using, including but not limited to, DEAE SEPHAROSE); chromatography on silica; reverse phase HPLC; gel filtration (using, including but not limited to, SEPHADEX G-75); hydrophobic interaction chromatography; size-exclusion chromatography, metal-chelate chromatography; ultrafiltration/diafiltration; ethanol precipitation; ammonium sulfate precipitation; chromatofocusing; displacement chromatography; electrophoretic procedures (including but not limited to preparative isoelectric focusing), differential solubility (including but not limited to ammonium sulfate precipitation), or extraction. In other embodiments, apparent molecular weight is estimated by GPC by comparison to globular protein standards (PROTEIN PURIFICATION METHODS, A PRACTICAL APPROACH (Harris & Angal, Eds.) IRL Press 1989, 293-306). In one aspect, the in vitro inhibitory potency of a probe against a panel of selected Kinases as a rapid means of confirming accessibility of the reactive moiety to the Kinase active site is tested. By way of example only, although less potent than the parent Compound 2, the illustrative probe of Compound 3 retains potency against Btk (IC50˜90 nM). Thus, the piperazine linker and bodipy fluorophore do not seriously compromise accessibility of the illustrative probe to the enzyme active site. The Activity Probes described herein label kinases at the non-catalytic Cys 481 (or a homologous cysteine) and that in some embodiments, probe labeling does not require the catalytic machinery per se. As such it differs from canonical activity-based probes that target the enzyme catalytic machinery directly. In some embodiments, the Kinase undergoes a phosphorylation dependent conformational change that is tightly coupled to ATP binding and kinase activation. In some embodiments, effective labeling by a probe requires the Kinase to be in its active conformation in order to directly detect Kinase activity in cells. In other embodiments, effective labeling by a Activity Probe does not require the Kinase to be in its active conformation in order to directly detect Kinase activity in cells. Therapeutic Uses of Irreversible Inhibitor Compounds Described herein are methods, compositions, uses and medicaments for the treatment of disorders comprising administering to a patient in need an irreversible inhibitor of an ACK. In some embodiments, the ACK is Btk or a Btk homolog. In further embodiments, the ACK is Blk or a Blk homolog. In yet further embodiments, the ACK is tyrosine kinases that share homology with Btk by having a cysteine residue (including a Cys 481 residue) that can form a covalent bond with the irreversible inhibitor. See, e.g., protein kinases in FIG. 7. The methods described herein (which includes uses of a pharmaceutical composition to treat a disease or disorder, or uses of a compound to form a medicament for treating a disease or disorder) include administering to a subject in need a composition containing a therapeutically effective amount of one or more irreversible Btk inhibitor compounds described herein. Without being bound by theory, the diverse roles played by Btk signaling in various hematopoietic cell functions, e.g., B-cell receptor activation, show that small molecule Btk inhibitors are useful for reducing the risk of or treating a variety of diseases affected by or affecting many cell types of the hematopoietic lineage including, e.g., autoimmune diseases, heteroimmune conditions or diseases, inflammatory diseases, cancer (e.g., B-cell proliferative disorders), and thromboembolic disorders.

Thus, a subset of tyrosine kinases other than Btk are also expected to be useful as therapeutic targets in a number of health conditions, including: autoimmune diseases, which include, but are not limited to, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, osteoarthritis, Still's disease, juvenile arthritis, lupus, diabetes, myasthenia gravis, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, Ord's thyroiditis, Graves' disease Sjögren's syndrome, multiple sclerosis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, Addison's disease, opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome, ankylosing spondylitisis, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, aplastic anemia, autoimmune hepatitis, coeliac disease, Goodpasture's syndrome, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, optic neuritis, scleroderma, primary biliary cirrhosis, Reiter's syndrome, Takayasu's arteritis, temporal arteritis, warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia, Wegener's granulomatosis, psoriasis, alopecia universalis, Behçet's disease, chronic fatigue, dysautonomia, endometriosis, interstitial cystitis, neuromyotonia, scleroderma, and vulvodynia.heteroimmune conditions or diseases, which include, but are not limited to graft versus host disease, transplantation, transfusion, anaphylaxis, allergies (e.g., allergies to plant pollens, latex, drugs, foods, insect poisons, animal hair, animal dander, dust mites, or cockroach calyx), type I hypersensitivity, allergic conjunctivitis, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis.inflammatory diseases, which include, but are not limited to asthma, inflammatory bowel disease, appendicitis, blepharitis, bronchiolitis, bronchitis, bursitis, cervicitis, cholangitis, cholecystitis, colitis, conjunctivitis, cystitis, dacryoadenitis, dermatitis, dermatomyositis, encephalitis, endocarditis, endometritis, enteritis, enterocolitis, epicondylitis, epididymitis, fasciitis, fibrositis, gastritis, gastroenteritis, hepatitis, hidradenitis suppurativa, laryngitis, mastitis, meningitis, myelitis myocarditis, myositis, nephritis, oophoritis, orchitis, osteitis, otitis, pancreatitis, parotitis, pericarditis, peritonitis, pharyngitis, pleuritis, phlebitis, pneumonitis, pneumonia, proctitis, prostatitis, pyelonephritis, rhinitis, salpingitis, sinusitis, stomatitis, synovitis, tendonitis, tonsillitis, uveitis, vaginitis, vasculitis, and vulvitis.a cancer, e.g., B-cell proliferative disorders, which include, but are not limited to diffuse large B cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, B-cell prolymphocytic leukemia, lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma/Waldenström macroglobulinemia, splenic marginal zone lymphoma, plasma cell myeloma, plasmacytoma, extranodal marginal zone B cell lymphoma, nodal marginal zone B cell lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, mediastinal (thymic) large B cell lymphoma, intravascular large B cell lymphoma, primary effusion lymphoma, burkitt lymphoma/leukemia, and lymphomatoid granulomatosis.thromboembolic disorders, which include, but are not limited to myocardial infarct, angina pectoris (including unstable angina), reocclusions or restenoses after angioplasty or aortocoronary bypass, stroke, transitory ischemia, peripheral arterial occlusive disorders, pulmonary embolisms, and deep venous thromboses.mastocytosis, which include but are not limited to diseases characterized by hyperactive mast cells.bone resorption disorders, which include but are not limited to Paget's disease of bone, osteoporosis, and the bone changes secondary to cancer, such as occur in myeloma and metastases from breast cancer. Symptoms, diagnostic tests, and prognostic tests for each of the above-mentioned conditions include, e.g., Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine©,” 16th ed., 2004, The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. Dey et al. (2006), Cytojournal 3(24), and the “Revised European American Lymphoma” (REAL) classification system (see, e.g., the website maintained by the National Cancer Institute). A number of animal models are useful for establishing a range of therapeutically effective doses of irreversible inhibitors, including irreversible Btk inhibitor compounds for treating any of the foregoing diseases. For example, refer to Examples 1-4 of the “Therapeutic Uses” section of the Examples included herein. Also, for example, dosing of irreversible inhibitor compounds for treating an autoimmune disease can be assessed in a mouse model of rheumatoid arthritis. In this model, arthritis is induced in Balb/c mice by administering anti-collagen antibodies and lipopolysaccharide. See Nandakumar et al. (2003), Am. J. Pathol 163:1827-1837. In another example, dosing of irreversible inhibitors for the treatment of B-cell proliferative disorders can be examined in, e.g., a human-to-mouse xenograft model in which human B-cell lymphoma cells (e.g. Ramos cells) are implanted into immunodeficient mice (e.g., “nude” mice) as described in, e.g., Pagel et al. (2005), Clin Cancer Res 11(13):4857-4866. Animal models for treatment of thromboembolic disorders are also known. In one embodiment, the therapeutic efficacy of the compound for one of the foregoing diseases is optimized during a course of treatment. For example, a subject being treated optionally undergoes a diagnostic evaluation to correlate the relief of disease symptoms or pathologies to inhibition of in vivo Btk activity achieved by administering a given dose of an irreversible Btk inhibitor. Cellular assays are used to determine in vivo activity of Btk in the presence or absence of an irreversible Btk inhibitor. For example, since activated Btk is phosphorylated at tyrosine 223 (Y223) and tyrosine 551 (Y551), phospho-specific immunocytochemical staining of P-Y223 or P-Y551-positive cells are used to detect or quantify activation of Bkt in a population of cells (e.g., by FACS analysis of stained vs unstained cells). See, e.g., Nisitani et al. (1999), Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci, USA 96:2221-2226. Thus, the amount of the Btk inhibitor compound that is administered to a subject is optionally increased or decreased as needed so as to maintain a level of Btk inhibition optimal for treating the subject's disease state. In one embodiment are methods for identifying biomarkers suitable for determining patient response to an irreversible ACK inhibitor (including, e.g., a compound of Formula (I)) comprising administering to a test subject a composition containing an amount of the irreversible ACK inhibitor (including, e.g., a compound of Formula (I)) sufficient to inhibit B cell receptor signaling and correlating B cell receptor signaling with apoptosis. In another or further embodiment are methods for selecting a patient for treatment for lymphoma with an irreversible ACK inhibitor (including, e.g., a compound of Formula (I)) comprising measuring pErk or Erk transcriptional target levels in a patient sample, and correlating a high level of transcriptional targets with a positive response to the treatment. In another or further embodiments are methods for measuring a patient's response to treatment comprising administering to the patient an irreversible ACK inhibitor (including, e.g., a compound of Formula (I)), measuring pErk or Erk transcriptional target levels in a patient sample, and correlating a reduced level of transcriptional targets with a positive response to the administration of the irreversible ACK inhibitor (including, e.g., a compound of Formula (I)). Combination Treatments The irreversible Btk inhibitor compositions described herein can also be used in combination with other well known therapeutic reagents that are selected for their therapeutic value for the condition to be treated. In general, the compositions described herein and, in embodiments where combinational therapy is employed, other agents do not have to be administered in the same pharmaceutical composition, and are optionally, because of different physical and chemical characteristics, have to be administered by different routes. The initial administration is made, for example, according to established protocols, and then, based upon the observed effects, the dosage, modes of administration and times of administration are modified. In certain instances, it is appropriate to administer at least one irreversible Btk inhibitor compound described herein in combination with another therapeutic agent. By way of example only, if one of the side effects experienced by a patient upon receiving one of the irreversible Btk inhibitor compounds described herein is nausea, then it is appropriate to administer an anti-nausea agent in combination with the initial therapeutic agent. Or, by way of example only, the therapeutic effectiveness of one of the compounds described herein is enhanced by administration of an adjuvant (i.e., by itself the adjuvant has minimal therapeutic benefit, but in combination with another therapeutic agent, the overall therapeutic benefit to the patient is enhanced). Or, by way of example only, the benefit experienced by a patient is increased by administering one of the compounds described herein with another therapeutic agent (which also includes a therapeutic regimen) that also has therapeutic benefit. In any case, regardless of the disease, disorder or condition being treated, the overall benefit experienced by the patient is in some embodiments simply additive of the two therapeutic agents or in other embodiments, the patient experiences a synergistic benefit. The particular choice of compounds used will depend upon the diagnosis of the attending physicians and their judgment of the condition of the patient and the appropriate treatment protocol. The compounds are optionally administered concurrently (e.g., simultaneously, essentially simultaneously or within the same treatment protocol) or sequentially, depending upon the nature of the disease, disorder, or condition, the condition of the patient, and the actual choice of compounds used. The determination of the order of administration, and the number of repetitions of administration of each therapeutic agent during a treatment protocol, is based on an evaluation of the disease being treated and the condition of the patient. Therapeutically-effective dosages can vary when the drugs are used in treatment combinations. Methods for experimentally determining therapeutically-effective dosages of drugs and other agents for use in combination treatment regimens are described in the literature. For example, the use of metronomic dosing, i.e., providing more frequent, lower doses in order to minimize toxic side effects, has been described extensively in the literature Combination treatment further includes periodic treatments that start and stop at various times to assist with the clinical management of the patient. For combination therapies described herein, dosages of the co-administered compounds will of course vary depending on the type of co-drug employed, on the specific drug employed, on the disease or condition being treated and so forth. In addition, when co-administered with one or more biologically active agents, the compound provided herein may be administered either simultaneously with the biologically active agent(s), or sequentially. If administered sequentially, the attending physician will decide on the appropriate sequence of administering protein in combination with the biologically active agent(s). In any case, the multiple therapeutic agents (one of which is a compound of Formula (A1-A6), (B1-B6), (C1-C6), or (D1-D6) described herein) are optionally administered in any order or even simultaneously. If simultaneously, the multiple therapeutic agents are optionally provided in a single, unified form, or in multiple forms (by way of example only, either as a single pill or as two separate pills). One of the therapeutic agents may be given in multiple doses, or both may be given as multiple doses. If not simultaneous, the timing between the multiple doses may vary from more than zero weeks to less than four weeks. In addition, the combination methods, compositions and formulations are not to be limited to the use of only two agents; the use of multiple therapeutic combinations are also envisioned. It is understood that the dosage regimen to treat, prevent, or ameliorate the condition(s) for which relief is sought, can be modified in accordance with a variety of factors. These factors include the disorder from which the subject suffers, as well as the age, weight, sex, diet, and medical condition of the subject. Thus, the dosage regimen actually employed can vary widely and therefore can deviate from the dosage regimens set forth herein. The pharmaceutical agents which make up the combination therapy disclosed herein may be a combined dosage form or in separate dosage forms intended for substantially simultaneous administration. The pharmaceutical agents that make up the combination therapy may also be administered sequentially, with either therapeutic compound being administered by a regimen calling for two-step administration. The two-step administration regimen may call for sequential administration of the active agents or spaced-apart administration of the separate active agents. The time period between the multiple administration steps may range from, a few minutes to several hours, depending upon the properties of each pharmaceutical agent, such as potency, solubility, bioavailability, plasma half-life and kinetic profile of the pharmaceutical agent. Circadian variation of the target molecule concentration may also determine the optimal dose interval. In addition, the compounds described herein also are optionally used in combination with procedures that provide additional or synergistic benefit to the patient. By way of example only, patients are expected to find therapeutic and/or prophylactic benefit in the methods described herein, wherein pharmaceutical composition of a compound disclosed herein and/or combinations with other therapeutics are combined with genetic testing to determine whether that individual is a carrier of a mutant gene that is known to be correlated with certain diseases or conditions. The compounds described herein and combination therapies can be administered before, during or after the occurrence of a disease or condition, and the timing of administering the composition containing a compound can vary. Thus, for example, the compounds can be used as a prophylactic and can be administered continuously to subjects with a propensity to develop conditions or diseases in order to prevent the occurrence of the disease or condition. The compounds and compositions can be administered to a subject during or as soon as possible after the onset of the symptoms. The administration of the compounds can be initiated within the first 48 hours of the onset of the symptoms, within the first 6 hours of the onset of the symptoms, or within 3 hours of the onset of the symptoms. The initial administration can be via any route practical, such as, for example, an intravenous injection, a bolus injection, infusion over 5 minutes to about 5 hours, a pill, a capsule, transdermal patch, buccal delivery, and the like, or combination thereof. A compound should be administered as soon as is practicable after the onset of a disease or condition is detected or suspected, and for a length of time necessary for the treatment of the disease, such as, for example, from about 1 month to about 3 months. The length of treatment can vary for each subject, and the length can be determined using the known criteria. For example, the compound or a formulation containing the compound can be administered for at least 2 weeks, between about 1 month to about 5 years, or from about 1 month to about 3 years.

Pharmaceutical Composition/Formulation Pharmaceutical compositions are formulated in a conventional manner using one or more physiologically acceptable carriers including excipients and auxiliaries which facilitate processing of the active compounds into preparations which can be used pharmaceutically. Proper formulation is dependent upon the route of administration chosen. A summary of pharmaceutical compositions described herein is found, for example, in Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, Nineteenth Ed (Easton, Pa.: Mack Publishing Company, 1995); Hoover, John E., Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa. 1975; Liberman, H. A. and Lachman, L., Eds., Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Marcel Decker, New York, N.Y., 1980; and Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms and Drug Delivery Systems, Seventh Ed. (Lippincott Williams & Wilkins 1999).

Exemplary carrier materials include, e.g., binders, suspending agents, disintegration agents, filling agents, surfactants, solubilizers, stabilizers, lubricants, wetting agents, diluents, and the like. See, e.g., Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, Nineteenth Ed (Easton, Pa.: Mack Publishing Company, 1995); Hoover, John E., Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa. 1975; Liberman, H. A. and Lachman, L., Eds., Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Marcel Decker, New York, N.Y., 1980; and Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms and Drug Delivery Systems, Seventh Ed. (Lippincott Williams & Wilkins 1999). A “measurable serum concentration” or “measurable plasma concentration” describes the blood serum or blood plasma concentration, typically measured in mg, μg, or ng of therapeutic agent per ml, dl, or 1 of blood serum, absorbed into the bloodstream after administration. As used herein, measurable plasma concentrations are typically measured in ng/ml or μg/ml. “Pharmacodynamics” refers to the factors which determine the biologic response observed relative to the concentration of drug at a site of action. “Pharmacokinetics” refers to the factors which determine the attainment and maintenance of the appropriate concentration of drug at a site of action. “Steady state,” as used herein, is when the amount of drug administered is equal to the amount of drug eliminated within one dosing interval resulting in a plateau or constant plasma drug exposure. Dosage Forms Moreover, the pharmaceutical compositions described herein, which include a compound of any of Formula (A1-A6), Formula (B1-B6), Formula (C1-C6), Formula (D1-D6), Formula (I), or Formula (VII) can be formulated into any suitable dosage form, including but not limited to, aqueous oral dispersions, liquids, gels, syrups, elixirs, slurries, suspensions and the like, for oral ingestion by a patient to be treated, solid oral dosage forms, aerosols, controlled release formulations, fast melt formulations, effervescent formulations, lyophilized formulations, tablets, powders, pills, dragees, capsules, delayed release formulations, extended release formulations, pulsatile release formulations, multiparticulate formulations, and mixed immediate release and controlled release formulations.

In still other aspects, using standard coating procedures, such as those described in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 20th Edition (2000), a film coating is provided around the formulation of the compound of any of Formula (A1-A6), Formula (B1-B6), Formula (C1-C6), Formula (D1-D6), Formula (I), or Formula (VII). In one embodiment, some or all of the particles of the compound of any of Formula (A1-A6), Formula (B1-B6), Formula (C1-C6), Formula (D1-D6), Formula (I), or Formula (VII), are coated. In another embodiment, some or all of the particles of the compound of any of Formula (A1-A6), Formula (B1-B6), Formula (C1-C6), Formula (D1-D6), Formula (I), or Formula (VII), are microencapsulated. In still another embodiment, the particles of the compound of any of Formula (A1-A6), Formula (B1-B6), Formula (C1-C6), Formula (D1-D6), Formula (I), or Formula (VII), are not microencapsulated and are uncoated. Examples of Methods of Dosing and Treatment Regimens The compounds described herein can be used in the preparation of medicaments for the inhibition of Btk or a homolog thereof, or for the treatment of diseases or conditions that benefit, at least in part, from inhibition of Btk or a homolog thereof. In addition, a method for treating any of the diseases or conditions described herein in a subject in need of such treatment, involves administration of pharmaceutical compositions containing at least one compound of any of Formula (A1-A6), Formula (B1-B6), Formula (C1-C6), Formula (D1-D6), Formula (I), or Formula (VII), described herein, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, pharmaceutically acceptable N-oxide, pharmaceutically active metabolite, pharmaceutically acceptable prodrug, or pharmaceutically acceptable solvate thereof, in therapeutically effective amounts to said subject. The compositions containing the compound(s) described herein can be administered for prophylactic and/or therapeutic treatments. In therapeutic applications, the compositions are administered to a patient already suffering from a disease or condition, in an amount sufficient to cure or at least partially arrest the symptoms of the disease or condition. Amounts effective for this use will depend on the severity and course of the disease or condition, previous therapy, the patient's health status, weight, and response to the drugs, and the judgment of the treating physician. In prophylactic applications, compositions containing the compounds described herein are administered to a patient susceptible to or otherwise at risk of a particular disease, disorder or condition. Such an amount is defined to be a “prophylactically effective amount or dose.” In this use, the precise amounts also depend on the patient's state of health, weight, and the like. When used in a patient, effective amounts for this use will depend on the severity and course of the disease, disorder or condition, previous therapy, the patient's health status and response to the drugs, and the judgment of the treating physician. In some embodiments, the irreversible kinase inhibitor is administered to the patient on a regular basis, e.g., three times a day, two times a day, once a day, every other day or every 3 days. In other embodiments, the irreversible kinase inhibitor is administered to the patient on an intermittent basis, e.g., twice a day followed by once a day followed by three times a day; or the first two days of every week; or the first, second and third day of a week. In some embodiments, intermittent dosing is as effective as regular dosing. In further or alternative embodiments, the irreversible kinase inhibitor is administered only when the patient exhibits a particular symptom, e.g., the onset of pain, or the onset of a fever, or the onset of an inflammation, or the onset of a skin disorder. In the case wherein the patient's condition does not improve, upon the doctor's discretion the administration of the compounds may be administered chronically, that is, for an extended period of time, including throughout the duration of the patient's life in order to ameliorate or otherwise control or limit the symptoms of the patient's disease or condition. In the case wherein the patient's status does improve, upon the doctor's discretion the administration of the compounds may be given continuously; alternatively, the dose of drug being administered may be temporarily reduced or temporarily suspended for a certain length of time (i.e., a “drug holiday”). The length of the drug holiday can vary between 2 days and 1 year, including by way of example only, 2 days, 3 days, 4 days, 5 days, 6 days, 7 days, 10 days, 12 days, 15 days, 20 days, 28 days, 35 days, 50 days, 70 days, 100 days, 120 days, 150 days, 180 days, 200 days, 250 days, 280 days, 300 days, 320 days, 350 days, or 365 days. The dose reduction during a drug holiday may be from 10%-100%, including, by way of example only, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, or 100%. Once improvement of the patient's conditions has occurred, a maintenance dose is administered if necessary. Subsequently, the dosage or the frequency of administration, or both, can be reduced, as a function of the symptoms, to a level at which the improved disease, disorder or condition is retained. Patients can, however, require intermittent treatment on a long-term basis upon any recurrence of symptoms. The amount of a given agent that will correspond to such an amount will vary depending upon factors such as the particular compound, disease or condition and its severity, the identity (e.g., weight) of the subject or host in need of treatment, and is determined according to the particular circumstances surrounding the case, including, e.g., the specific agent being administered, the route of administration, the condition being treated, and the subject or host being treated. In general, however, doses employed for adult human treatment will typically be in the range of 0.02-5000 mg per day, or from about 1-1500 mg per day. The desired dose may conveniently be presented in a single dose or as divided doses administered simultaneously (or over a short period of time) or at appropriate intervals, for example as two, three, four or more sub-doses per day. The pharmaceutical composition described herein may be in unit dosage forms suitable for single administration of precise dosages. In unit dosage form, the formulation is divided into unit doses containing appropriate quantities of one or more compound. The unit dosage may be in the form of a package containing discrete quantities of the formulation. Non-limiting examples are packaged tablets or capsules, and powders in vials or ampoules. Aqueous suspension compositions can be packaged in single-dose non-reclosable containers. Alternatively, multiple-dose reclosable containers can be used, in which case it is typical to include a preservative in the composition. By way of example only, formulations for parenteral injection may be presented in unit dosage form, which include, but are not limited to ampoules, or in multi-dose containers, with an added preservative. The foregoing ranges are merely suggestive, as the number of variables in regard to an individual treatment regime is large, and considerable excursions from these recommended values are not uncommon. Such dosages may be altered depending on a number of variables, not limited to the activity of the compound used, the disease or condition to be treated, the mode of administration, the requirements of the individual subject, the severity of the disease or condition being treated, and the judgment of the practitioner. Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of such therapeutic regimens can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, including, but not limited to, the determination of the LD50 (the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED50 (the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between the toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio between LD50 and ED50. Compounds exhibiting high therapeutic indices are preferred. The data obtained from cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage for use in human. The dosage of such compounds lies preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include the ED50 with minimal toxicity. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. Dosing Strategies to Increase Selectivity Described herein are irreversible kinase inhibitors that are selective for one or more ACKs, including a Btk, a Btk homolog, and a Btk kinase cysteine homolog. In some embodiments, the irreversible inhibitors described herein also bind reversibly to other kinases (some of which, in some embodiments, are also ACKs). As a means of enhancing the selectivity profile, such inhibitors are formulated (formulation includes chemical modifications of the inhibitor, use of excipients in a pharmaceutical composition, and combinations thereof) such that the pharmacokinetic profile favors enhanced selectivity of the inhibitors for an ACK over a non-ACK. By way of example only, an ACK is formulated to have a short plasma half-life. In other embodiments, an ACK is formulated to have an extended plasma half-life. For example, as shown in the Examples, Compound 1 and Compound 12 have a short half-life in vivo. In contrast, Compound 7 and Compound 8 have a significantly longer in vivo half-life (FIG. 5). Compounds like 1 and 12 are predicted to have enhanced kinase selectivity in vivo because inhibition will be sustained only for those kinases that are irreversibly inhibited. Further, given that the irreversible kinase inhibitors described herein have both reversible (in general to non-ACKs) and irreversible (generally, to ACKs) activities, in vivo properties of absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) are selected in order to optimize the therapeutic index. Specifically, in some embodiments, rapidly cleared compounds cause only brief inhibition of reversibly inhibited targets while maintaining sustained inhibition of irreversibly inhibited targets.

Synthesis of Compounds Example 1 Preparation of 4-Amino-3-(4-phenoxyphenyl)-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine (Intermediate 2) 4-Amino-3-(4-phenoxyphenyl)-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine (Intermediate 2) is prepared as disclosed in International Patent Publication No. WO 01/019829. Briefly, 4-phenoxybenzoic acid (48 g) is added to thionyl chloride (100 mL) and heated under gentle reflux for 1 hour. Thionyl chloride is removed by distillation, the residual oil dissolved in toluene and volatile material removed at 80° C./20 mbar. The resulting acid chloride is dissolved in toluene (200 mL) and tetrahydrofuran (35 mL). Malononitrile (14.8 g) is added and the solution and stirred at −10° C. while adding diisopropylethylethylamine (57.9 g) in toluene (150 mL), while maintaining the temperature below 0° C. After 1 hour at 0° C., the mixture is stirred at 20° C. overnight. Amine hydrochloride is removed by filtration and the filtrate evaporated in vacuo. The residue is taken up in ethyl acetate and washed with 1.25 M sulphuric acid, then with brine and dried over sodium sulfate. Evaporation of the solvents gives a semisolid residue which is treated with a little ethyl acetate to give 4.1 g of 1,1-dicyano-2-hydroxy-2-(4-phenoxyphenyl)ethene as a white solid (m.p. 160-162° C.). The filtrate on evaporation gives 56.58 (96%) of 1,1-dicyano-2-hydroxy-2-(4-phenoxyphenyl)ethene as a grey-brown solid, which is sufficiently pure for further use. 1,1-Dicyano-2-hydroxy-2-(4-phenoxyphenyl)ethene (56.5 g) in acetonitrile (780 mL) and methanol (85 mL) is stirred under nitrogen at 0° C. while adding diisopropylethylamine (52.5 mL) followed by 2M trimethylsilyldiazomethane (150 mL) in THF. The reaction is stirred for 2 days at 20° C., and then 2 g of silica is added (for chromatography). The brown-red solution is evaporated in vacuo, the residue dissolved in ethyl acetate and washed well with water then brine, dried and evaporated. The residue is extracted with diethyl ether (3×250 mL), decanting from insoluble oil. Evaporation of the ether extracts gives 22.5 g of 1,1-dicyano-2-methoxy-2-(4-phenoxyphenyl)ethene as a pale orange solid. The insoluble oil is purified by flash chromatography to give 15.0 g of a red-orange oil. 1,1-Dicyano-2-methoxy-2-(4-phenoxyphenyl)ethene (22.5 g) and 1,1-dicyano-2-methoxy-2-(4-phenoxyphenyl)ethene oil (15 g) are treated with a solution of hydrazine hydrate (18 mL) in ethanol (25 mL) and heated on the steambath for 1 hour. Ethanol (15 mL) is added followed by water (10 mL). The precipitated solid is collected and washed with ethanol:water (4:1) and then dried in air to give 3-amino-4-cyano-5-(4-phenoxyphenyl)pyrazole as a pale orange solid. 3-Amino-4-cyano-5-(4-phenoxyphenyl)pyrazole (29.5 g) is suspended in formamide (300 mL) and heated under nitrogen at 180° C. for 4 hours. The reaction mixture is cooled to 30° C. and water (300 mL) is added. The solid is collected, washed well with water, then with methanol and dried in air to give of 4-amino-3-(4-phenoxyphenyl)-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine.

(R)-tert-butyl 2-(hydroxymethyl)pyrrolidine-1-carboxylate (0.5 g; 1.5 equivalents) was added to the mixture followed by the addition of diisopropyl diazodicarboxylate (0.5 mL). The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 4 hr. The reaction mixture was concentrated and purified by flash chromatography (acetone/CH2Cl2=1/1) to give intermediate 3 (1.49 g). Intermediate 3 (1.49 g) was treated with 4 mL of TFA and 5 mL of CH2Cl2 and stirred overnight at room temperature and then concentrated to dryness. The residue was dissolved in ethyl acetate (100 mL) and then washed with dilute aq. NaHCO3 (100 mL). The ethyl acetate layer was dried (MgSO4), filtered and concentrated to −20 mL and then 4.0 M HCl\dioxane (1 mL) was added and a yellow precipitate formed. The solid was collected by filtration and washed with ethyl acetate (20 mL). The solid was suspended in ethyl acetate (100 mL) and again washed with dilute aq. NaHCO3 (100 mL). The ethyl acetate was dried (MgSO4), filtered and concentrated to provide 0.43 g of a light yellow solid. The solid (0.14 g, 0.36 mmol) was stirred in THF (3 mL) and TEA (015 mL, 1.1 mmol) was added, followed by cooling the reaction with an ice bath for 30 min, then acryl chloride (30 μL, 0.36 mmol) added and the reaction was stirred for 2 hr.

A variety of lymphoma cell lines were incubated with a range of concentrations of Compound 1 to determine the GI50, the concentration that results in 50% decrease in cell proliferation (FIG. 1A). Compound 1 inhibits tumor growth in DOHH2 and DLCL2 xenograft models (FIGS. 1B and 1C). For in vitro cell proliferation assays, cells were seeded in 96-well plates in standard growth media (in most cases RPMI+10% fetal calf serum) and Compound 1 was added in a 9-point dilution series ranging from 10 uM to 0.04 uM with DMSO at 0.1% final concentration in all wells. After 72 hours, cell number was measured using Alamar Blue using manufacturer's protocol. A dilution series of untreated cells was run in parallel to verify that the Alamar Blue assay reliably reflected cell number and that growth conditions were not limiting. The GI50, the concentration that results in a 50% decrease in cell number, was calculated using Calcusyn to fit the dose-response curve. GI50 values were confirmed in two or more separate experiments for each cell line. For in vivo lymphoma xenograft studies, 5E6 DOHH2 or DLCL2 cells in 50% matrigel were implanted subcutaneously in SCID mice and dosed orally with Compound 1 beginning when tumor size reached 100 mm2. Example 2 Inhibition of Collagen-Induced Arthritis in a Mouse Compound 1 inhibits collagen-induced arthritis in the mouse. Male DBA/1OlaHsd mice were injected intradermally with 150 microliters of 2 mg/mL Type II collagen in Freund's complete adjuvant with supplemental M. tuberculosis, 4 mg/mL and boosted with the same injection 21 days later. After paw inflammation was established, animals were randomized and Compound for vehicle was dosed orally once per day starting at day 1. Paw inflammation was scored from 0-5 and averaged across all paws from all animals for each group in the study. Compound 1 at 12.5 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg regressed inflammation through the end of the study (day 11) while 3.125 mg/kg significantly reduced the increase in paw inflammation (FIG. 2). Dexamethasone was included as a positive control. In another study, Compound 1 was dosed at 12.5 mg/kg to such mice over: (a) each day of an 11-day period; (b) days 1, 2, and 3 of an 11-day period; or (c) days 9, 10, and 11 of an 11-day period. Intermittent dosing reduced the increase in paw inflammation. In addition, Compound 9 was dosed to such mice at a level of 12.5 mg/kg or 50 mg/kg each day of an 11-day period. Compound 9 reduced the increase in paw inflammation. Example 3 Inhibition of Lupus in a Mouse Model Compound 1 inhibits disease progression in the mouse MRL/lpr model of lupus. Compound 1 at 3.125 mg/kg, 12.5 mg/kg, and 50 mg/kg significantly reduced proteinuria, indicating amelioration of the progressive autoimmune renal failure seen in this mouse strain (FIG. 3). MRL/lpr mice (Jax strain 000485) were dosed orally once per day from 12 weeks of age until 20 weeks of age and urine protein levels were measured weekly using Clinitech Multistick dipstick. Example 4 Inhibition of Mast Cell Degranulation Compound 1 inhibits mast cell degranulation in a mouse passive cutaneous anaphylaxis model. Increasing doses of Compound 1 significantly decrease the amount of Evans Blue release, indicating decreased mast cell activation and vascular permeabilization. (FIG. 4) Mice were sensitized with an intradermal injection of monoclonal anti-DNP-IgE in the back. 23 hours later they received a single oral dose of Compound 1 or vehicle. After one hour, animals were challenged with an intravenous injection of DNP-BSA and Evans Blue dye. Mast cell degranulation leads to vascular permeability and the distribution of the dye into the skin of the back. The area of extravasation after 1 hour is measured.

The resulting isotonic solution is then incorporated into ophthalmic delivery units, such as eye drop containers, which are suitable for ophthalmic administration. Example 6 Levels of Tonic BCR Signaling Predict Response to Compound 1 To identify biomarkers that correlate with response to Compound 1, phosphorylation events in the BCR signal transduction pathway were investigated. A panel of phospho-specific antibodies that recognize activating phosphorylation sites on Syk, Btk, BLNK, PLC-g1, PLC-g2, ERK, and AKT were used and tested the effects of Compound 4 on both basal phosphorylation and phosphorylation following BCR stimulation driven by anti-IgM or anti-IgG cross-linking We examined phosphorylation patterns in both a Compound 1 sensitive cell line (DOHH2) and a Compound 1 resistant cell line (Ramos). Compound 1 inhibits most BCR-stimulus induced phosphorylation events with similar potency in both cell lines. However, when we examined basal phosphorylation levels, we found higher basal phosphorylation in DOHH2 compared to Ramos, with phospho-ERK in particular indicating higher levels of basal or tonic signaling in DOHH2. Furthermore, Compound 4 significantly decreased pERK levels in unstimulated DOHH2 cells (IC50<10 nM), but not in Ramos cells. A panel of nine Btk expressing B cell lymphoma cell lines was screened for basal pERK levels. Seven lines expressed significantly higher levels of basal pERK, and of these, 5 were sensitive to Compound 1 (GI50<1.3 uM), while the two cell lines with low pERK levels were resistant to Compound 1. This data shows that tonic BCR signaling contributes to the survival of a subset of lymphoma cell lines, and that inhibition of this signaling by Compound 4 is correlated with induction of apoptosis. Two additional experiments demonstrate that sensitivity to Compound 1 is correlated with high levels of pERK. First 1 uM of Compound 4 reduces expression of the known ERK transcriptional target Egr-1 within 1 hr, with maximal downregulation (10-fold) achieved by 4 hr. Second, in the lymphoma cell line WSU-DLCL2, BCR cross-linking by anti-IgG (30 ug/ml) overcomes inhibition of pERK by Compound 4, showing that strong BCR stimulus activates parallel pathways to pERK that do not require Btk. BCR stimulus also rescues WSU-DLCL2 from Compound 1 induced cytotoxicity, further confirming that inhibition of pERK is correlated with apoptosis induction by Compound 1. Taken together these data show high levels of pERK or ERK transcriptional targets such as Egr-1 serve as useful markers for lymphomas in which tonic BCR signaling is contributing to cell survival and that these lymphomas are particularly sensitive to BCR pathway inhibitors such as Compound 1. Kinase Inhibitor Discovery Platform and Pulse Dosing Example 1 Design of an Inhibitor Because the ATP binding sites of the >500 kinases in the human genome are highly conserved, it has proven difficult to engineer selectivity for individual kinases using conventional reversible binding inhibitors. For our highly selective BTK inhibitor Compound 1, we engineered an electrophilic center capable of irreversibly inactivating the target enzyme, BTK. The approach employed structure based design to achieve a high degree of potency and selectivity by (1) fitting the core scaffold into the active site ATP binding pocket of kinase enzymes, and (2) forming a covalent bond with Cysteine-481 located in BTK. The unique chemistry required for covalent bond formation involves an electrophilic moiety that acts as a Michael acceptor, which bonds with a nucleophile (such as Cys-481) present in a precise location within the active site. Example 2 Inhibitor Screening Approach By way of example only, a panel of 50-100 Cys-targeting kinase inhibitors is generated. The molecular orientation and positioning of the electrophilic group in these inhibitors in relation to the Cysteine residue will affect the potency and selectivity of a given inhibitor. Each inhibitor will then be profiled for kinetics of kinase inhibition (Ki) for each of the ten Cys-containing kinases, effect on tumor cell proliferation (GI50), effect on relevant off-targets (hERG, CYPs), drug-like characteristics (solubility, c log P) and ability to block labeling by the active site probe. This panel of diverse inhibitors are then be used in cell assays (for example, inhibition of tumor growth) to screen for a phenotype of interest. With the phenotype, the identification of additional inhibited kinases is determined using the active site probe and mass spectrometry. Example 3 Inhibition of a Panel of Kinases for Compound 1 and Compound 9 In another example, the linker and Michael acceptor moiety of Compound 1 was modified to provide Compound 9 which has a different selectivity pattern. Table 1 is a table showing the degree of inhibition of a panel of kinases for two example compounds. IC50s were determined using the in vitro HotSpot kinase assay (purified enzymes, 33P-ATP, an appropriate substrate and 1 uM ATP.) Compared to Compound 1, Compound 9 has similar potency toward Btk, but significantly less potency toward JAK-3, ITK, and EGFR and significantly more potency toward the src-family kinases lck, c-src, FGR, Fyn, Hck, and Lyn and Yes. Thus, subtle modifications in the linker moiety and the Michael acceptor moiety are important for the design of selective ACK inhibitors.

For example, in Table 2, Compound 9 and Compound 12 both inhibit Btk with a similar potency as Compound 1, but they are both significantly less potent inhibitors of EGFR, ITK, and JAK-3. As another example, Compound 11 is similar to Compound 1 for inhibition of Btk but does not bind glutathione as readily. A calculated value (e.g (1/Btk IC50)/Glutathione conjugation rate) as shown in the Table 2) is used to compare compounds for their ratio between potency at inhibiting their target and their non-specific binding to other SH groups, such as those in glutathione. As shown in Table 2, this calculated value is 4.7 for Compound 1 and for 239.6 for Compound 11. Calculated ratios such as these are used to quantitatively compare different compounds and select compounds for further study. Example 4a Enzyme Inhibition For enzyme inhibition assays, compounds were tested in range of ten concentrations from 10 uM to 0.0005 uM using purified enzymes and the Hotspot kinase assay. Reaction conditions were 1 uM ATP, one hour incubation with inhibitor, and kinase activity detected using 33-ATP phosphorylation of an appropriately selected peptide substrate. Dose-response curves were fit using Prism, and the IC50, the concentration at which enzyme inhibition is 50% of maximal inhibition, was determined. See Table 2. Example 4b Glutathione Binding Assays For the glutathione binding assays, 5 mM glutathione, 10 μM Btk inhibitor in DMSO (10 μL) and 6 equivalents of N′N′ Diisopropyl ethyl amine were combined in 1 mL potassium phosphate buffer. The mixture was incubated for 0, 15, 60 minutes at room temperature and the reaction was stopped with 10 equivalents of formic acid. 50 μL of each reaction mixture was injected on HPLC (Mobil Phase A: 0.2% formic acid in water, Mobile Phase B: 0.2% formic acid in acetonitrile, HPLC Column: Metasil Basic 3μ, 150×4.6 mm, 10% B, Gradient: 10% to 90% B, Detection: UV/Vis 260 nM). Rate of reaction was reported as nmole GSH conjugate conversion per minute from the normalized ratio for area under the curve from HPLC chromatograms for both GSH conjugate and the parent. Example 4c Cell Proliferation Assay Analogs are generated that are Btk inhibitors and that are cytotoxic to the lymphoma cell line DOHH2. See Table 2. For the DOHH2 cell proliferation assay, cells were seeded in 96-well plates in standard growth media (RPMI+10% fetal calf serum) and compounds were added in a 9-point dilution series ranging from 10 uM to 0.04 uM with DMSO at 0.1% final concentration in all wells. After 72 hours, cell number was measured using Alamar Blue using manufacturer's protocol. A dilution series of untreated cells was run in parallel to verify that the Alamar Blue assay reliably reflected cell number and that growth conditions were not limiting. The GI50, the concentration that results in a 50% decrease in cell number, was calculated using Calcusyn to fit the dose-response curve.

In contrast, Compound 7 and Compound 8 have a significantly longer in vivo half-life (FIG. 5). Compounds like 1 and 12 are predicted to have enhanced kinase selectivity in vivo because inhibition will be sustained only for those kinases that are irreversibly inhibited. Male jugular vein cannulated rats were administered a single dose of all test compounds at 8 mg/kg each, in combination by oral gavage. Dose volumes were adjusted based on body weight data collected immediately prior to dosing. Blood samples were collected at 0.0833 (5 minutes), 0.333 (20 minutes), 1, 3, 6, 9, and 24 hours post-dosing from orally dosed rats. The samples were collected into plasma separator Microtainer tubes with anticoagulant (lithium heparin). Plasma samples were prepared by centrifugation (5 min at 5000×g), and at least 100 μL were transferred to storage tubes and stored frozen at −80° C. Plasma samples were thawed and 75 uL aliquots were transferred to centrifuge tubes to which 10 μL aliquots of internal standard solution (1 μg/mL) were added. The samples were not diluted with blank plasma prior to further processing. Soluble proteins were precipitated by the addition of 200 μL of acetonitrile, followed by centrifugation (20 min at 16,000×g). The samples were evaporated to dryness and reconstituted in 200 μL of water containing 0.2% formic acid and 10% methanol. All samples were loaded onto an autosampler maintained at 6° C. and evaluated for concentrations of test compounds using LC-MS/MS. Example 6 B Cell Inhibition Brief exposure to Compound 1 in vitro is sufficient to inhibit B cell activation in normal human B cells (FIG. 6). This protocol mimics the predicted exposure of cells to Compound 1 in vivo and demonstrates that inhibition of B cells is sustained despite washing out of Compound 1. B cells were purified from blood from healthy donors by negative selecting using the RosetteSep Human B cell enrichment cocktail. Cells were plated in growth media (10% RPMI+10% fetal calf serum) and indicated concentrations of Compound 1 were added. After incubation for 1 hour at 37° C., cells were washed three times using an 8-fold dilution in growth media for each wash. Cells were then stimulated with 10 ug/ml of IgM F(ab′)2 for 18 hours at 37° C. Cells were then stained with anti-CD69-PE antibody and analyzed by flow cytometry using standard conditions. Example 7 Optimizing the Therapeutic Index of Kinase Inhibitors Given that kinase inhibitors described above will have both reversible and irreversible activities, we select their in vivo properties of absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) in order to optimize the therapeutic index. Specifically, rapidly cleared compounds are expected to cause only brief inhibition of reversibly inhibited targets while maintaining sustained inhibition of irreversibly inhibited targets. Depending on the degree to which sustained inhibition of particular targets results in therapeutic effects or toxicities, we identify compounds with an optimal combination of in vitro selectivity profiles and in vivo ADME properties. 1.
