(E)-3-(4-((1R,3R/1S,3S)-6-(1-ethyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)-2-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-3-met hyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrobenzofuro[2,3-c]pyridin-1-yl)-3,5-difluorophenyl)acrylic acid
(E)-methyl 3-(4-((1R,3R/1S,3S)-6-(1-ethyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)-2-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-3-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrobenzofuro[2,3-c]pyridin-1-yl)-3,5-difluoroph enyl)acrylate 76f (110 mg, 0.199 mmol) was dissolved in 5 mL of methanol, then 1 mL of 2 M sodium hydroxide was added. The reaction mixture was warmed up to 40°C and was stirred for 1 hour at 40°C, then the reaction was stopped. The reaction solution was cooled to room temperature, then 1 M citric acid was added to adjust the pH to 5-6. The reaction solution was extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic phases were combined, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by high performance liquid chromatography to obtain the title compound (E)-3-(4-((1R,3R/1S,3S)-6-(1-ethyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)-2-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-3-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrobenzofuro[2,3-c]pyridin-1-yl)-3,5-di fluorophenyl)acrylic acid 76 (100 mg, yield 93%) as a yellow solid.
