DETAILED DESCRIPTION In the following detailed description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings, which form a part hereof. In the drawings, similar symbols typically identify similar components, unless context dictates otherwise. The illustrative embodiments described in the detailed description, drawings, and claims are not meant to be limiting. Other embodiments may be utilized, and other changes may be made, without departing from the spirit or scope of the subject matter presented herein. It will be readily understood that the aspects of the present disclosure, as generally described herein, and illustrated in the Figures, can be arranged, substituted, combined, separated, and designed in a wide variety of different configurations, all of which are explicitly contemplated herein. Provided herein are monomers, polymers, and compositions that generally relate to derivatives of acrylamide, including carbohydrate based derivatives of acrylamide. Exemplary molecules that can serve as monomers and/or polymers include Formula XIV, and Formula XV, and combinations thereof: wherein R1, R2, R3, L1, X1, Z1, Z2, Z3, Ym, X2, L2, R4, R5, and R6 in Formula XIV can include those options provided in more detail below, and wherein R1, R2, R3, L1, X1, Z1, Z2, Z3, and Ym can include those options provided in more detail below. In some embodiments, the acrylamide derivative can have a carbohydrate and/or five or six membered ring attached to it, such as a pyranose moiety. In some embodiments, such arrangements can provide additional benefits and/or alternative properties over acrylamide, variants thereof, and/or polymers thereof. In some embodiments, the degradation products from an acrylamide derivative are, or are similar to, adenosine triphospate (ATP) and/or urea, which are generally non-toxic and can readily be handled by humans and other organisms. In some embodiments, the acrylamide derivative can act as a cross-linker and allows for cross-linking of various polymers and/or other molecules. In some embodiments, even the cross-linker arrangements can also have degradation products that are also bio compatible. In some embodiments, one or more of any degradation products from the cross-linker can also be nontoxic (e.g., be, or be similar to, ATP and/or urea). The present specification provides a brief definition section, followed by sections describing acrylamide derivatives, polymers thereof, methods of making and using, etc., followed by an examples section. Definitions As used herein, “alkyl” refers to a straight or branched hydrocarbon chain that includes a fully saturated (no double or triple bonds) hydrocarbon group. The alkyl group of the compounds may be designated as “C1-C4 alkyl” or similar designations. By way of example only, “C1-C4 alkyl” indicates that there are one to four carbon atoms in the alkyl chain, i.e., the alkyl chain is selected from methyl, ethyl, propyl, iso-propyl, n-butyl, iso-butyl, sec-butyl, and t-butyl. Typical alkyl groups include, but are in no way limited to, methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, tertiary butyl, pentyl, hexyl, and the like. As used herein, “alkylene” refers to a straight or branched, fully saturated (no double or triple bonds) hydrocarbon tethering group that forms bonds to connect molecular fragments via their terminal carbon atoms. The alkylene group of the compounds may be designated as “—C1-C4 alkyl-” or similar designations. By way of example only, “—C1-C4 alkyl-” indicates that there are one to four carbon atoms in the alkylene chain. Examples of alkylene groups include but are not limited to methylene (—CH2—), ethylene (—CH2CH2—), propylene (—CH2CH2CH2—), dimethyl-methylene (—CH(CH3)2—), and butylene (—CH2CH2CH2CH2—). As used herein, the term “hydroxyl” refers to a —OH group. As used herein, “carboxyl” refers to “—C(═O)OH” group. As would be appreciated by the skilled artisan, a carboxyl group also includes its conjugate base. As used herein, “substituted” refers to independent replacement of one, two, three, or more of the hydrogen atoms in the specified structure with a substituent. For example, methane substituted with one or more chlorines would include chloromethane, dichloromethane, trichloromethane, and carbon tetrachloride. Acrylamide Derivatives While a variety of acrylamide derivatives are disclosed herein, generally, the acrylamide derivative is one that includes a carbohydrate moiety. In some embodiments, any appropriate carbohydrate moiety can be used, including various 5 and/or 6 membered rings, such as various sugar moieties. FIG. 1 depicts some embodiments of possible carbohydrate moieties that can be employed, e.g., a root mono and bis amino pyranose. Such compounds can be combined with acrylamide (FIG. 2, left), for example, as shown in FIG. 3, to produce an acrylamide derivative of acrylamide pyranose. In some embodiments, the use of a carbohydrate, and/or sugar, and/or pyranose structure on an acrylamide molecule allows one to create a monomer and/or polymer product, whose natural breakdown product is, or is similar to, ATP and/or urea, natural, biological, products. For example, as shown in FIG. 4, which depicts a reaction scheme, in some embodiments, the acrylamide pyranose polymer, when broken down, results in ATP and urea, products which are not harmful (and can even be useful) for biological organisms. Thus, in some embodiments, the present compounds present an advantage over traditional acrylamide products, because the monomeric form of traditional acrylamide can be harmful, if not cancerous. Furthermore, as noted above, in some embodiments, the acrylamide derivatives provide for a cross-linker. In some embodiments, this can be achieved by employing a carbohydrate with at least two amino groups on it (such as the his amino pyranose structure shown on the right of FIG. 1) with the acrylamide. Because of the additional amino group, the carbohydrate can serve as a cross-linker between acrylamides and/or polyacrylamides (see, e.g., the right side of FIG. 5), thereby providing for a cross-linked structure of acrylamide and/or acrylamide polymer. In some embodiments, the cross-linked structure allows for the formation of a more rigid product. In some embodiments, the composition can be cross-linked to a level so as to provide a gel or gel-like composition of greater rigidity than a typical polyacrylamide gel. In some embodiments, the cross-linker can also have or provide a degradation product similar to that of the non-cross-linking embodiments, e.g., resulting in a non-toxic degradation product, such as ATP and urea and/or variations thereof. Due to the mechanisms of action outlined for the acrylamide derivatives provided herein, one of skill in the art will appreciate that these derivatives can be formed for a variety of acrylamide variants (and polymers thereof), such as α-methylacrylamide, α-aethylacrylamide, α-cyanoacrylamide, maleic acid mono and bis sugar amide, itaconic acid mono and his sugar amide, fumaric acid mono and bis amide. Furthermore, hydroxyl moieties can be functionalized with a variety of substituents such as alkyl, ethers, and esters containing wide variety of functional moieties. Some non-limiting examples include 3-[(3,4,5,6-tetrahydroxy-tetrahydro-pyran-2-ylmethyl)-carbamoyl]-acrylic acid, but-2-enedioic acid bis-[(3,4,5,6-tetrahydroxy-tetrahydro-pyran-2-ylmethyp-amide], 3-[(3,4,5,6-tetrahydroxy-tetrahydro-pyran-2-ylmethyp-carbamoyl]-but-3-enoic acid, 2-methylene-N-(3,4,5,6-tetrahydroxy-tetrahydro-pyran-2-ylmethyl)-succinamic acid, N-(3,4,5-trihydroxy-6-methoxy-tetrahydro-pyran-2-ylmethyl)-(meth)acrylamide, 2-methyl-N-(3,4,5-trihydroxy-6-methoxy-tetrahydro-pyran-2-ylmethyl)-(meth)acrylamide, 2-methylene-N-(3,4,5-trihydroxy-6-methoxy-tetrahydro-pyran-2-ylmethyp-succinamic acid, 3-[(3,4,5-trihydroxy-6-methoxy-tetrahydro-pyran-2-ylmethyl)-carbamoyl]-acrylic acid, N-(3,4-dihydroxy-5,6-dimethoxy-tetrahydro-pyran-2-ylmethyl)-(meth)acrylamide, N-(3-hydroxy-4,5,6-trimethoxy-tetrahydro-pyran-2-ylmethyl)-acrylamide, and N-(3,4,5,6-tetramethoxy-tetrahydro-pyran-2-ylmethyl)-acrylamide. In some embodiments, the amide moieties can be moved around the sugar ring. In some embodiments, the present acrylamide derivatives (and/or polymers thereof) can be used as an alternative to methacrylate and other acrylics. In some embodiments, one difference between acrylamides and acrylates is that oxygen does not inhibit polymerization for the acrylamides while oxygen strongly inhibits polymerization of acrylates. In some embodiments, a difference between acrylamides from acrylates is that degradation products of acrylamide are much less acidic. Thus, in some embodiments, degradation of the acrylamide carbohydrate (such as an acrylamide sugar) allows for a product that has a degradation product that is less harmful than the degradation product for a traditional polyacrylamide. In some embodiments, any carbohydrate moiety can be attached to the acrylamide (and/or polyacrylamide). In some embodiments, any sugar moiety can be attached to the acrylamide (and/or polyacrylamide). In some embodiments, when the acrylamide derivative has a sugar moiety attached to it, the sugar moiety is in a ring form (e.g., as shown in FIG. 1). In some embodiments, the sugar is in its linear form. Depiction of the ring form herein (including the claims) denotes the option of both the ring and linear form, unless otherwise specified. Thus, the depiction of the ring form is generic to both configurations, unless otherwise specified. It is understood that any composition can, and under most scenarios will, include species in both of the structural arrangements. In some embodiments, a 5 or 6 membered ring can be employed as the moiety for the acrylamide derivative. In some embodiments, any six-membered ring that has five carbons and one oxygen can be used. In some embodiments, the ring can include 1, 2, 3, or 4 OH groups. In some embodiments, embodiments the ring can include 1, 2, 3, or 4 carboxylines, acetyl derivatives, sulfur, phosphors, nitrogen, ester, ketones, and/or ethers. In some embodiments, the sugar can be a decose, heptose, pentose, aldose, tetrose, glucose, galactose, fructose, and/or manose. In some embodiments, the oxygen in the ring (e.g., FIG. 3) can be substituted with a sulfur. In some embodiments, the nitrogen in the structure (FIG. 3) can be substituted with a sulfur. In some embodiments, a sulfur can be substituted at positions 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 of the molecule shown in the right side of FIG. 3. In some embodiments, any one or combination of the above can be made to any of the molecules provided herein.

In some embodiments, the acrylamide pyranose derivatives can be used as a hydrogel and/or polymer fixative in cosmetic products. In some embodiments, these compositions have increased safety. The following examples are directed to some such embodiments. Example 8 Preparation of Linear Acrylamide Pyranose Polymer (pAAP) In a four-neck 500 ml separable flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a dropping funnel, and a condenser, N-(6-deoxy-D-galactose)-acrylamide monomer (NMA), 20 g; distilled water, 50 ml; and tetrahydrofuran, 150 ml, are combined. The flask is warmed up to 60 degrees Centigrade under air with stirring, and a specified amount of 2,2′-azobis(4-methoxy-2,4-dimethylvaleronitrile) is added as a polymerization initiator. The solution will change into a gel-like material in about 20 min. This point is tentatively taken as a standard for the end of reaction. Disappearance of monomer at this point can be confirmed by silica gel thin layer chromatography (TLC). After the reaction, the reaction mixture is concentrated under reduced pressure at room temperature, and remaining water in the viscous liquid is removed by freeze-drying to isolate poly(N-(6-deoxy-D-galactose)-acrylamide), pAAP, as a white solid. Example 9 pAAP Hydrogels 2.7 g of N-(6-deoxy-D-glucose)-acrylamide and 0.3 g of 2-methyl-N-[3,4,6-trihydroxy-5-(2-methyl-acryloylamino)-tetrahydro-pyran-2-ylmethyl]-acrylamide are added to 6 mL of distilled water and mixed thoroughly. Propylene glycol (3 ml) is added to the solution followed by the addition 0.2 g of Darocur 1173. The solution is then exposed to UV light at 350 nm for 5 min which initiates the polymerization thereby forming a hydrogel. Example 10 pAAP Methacrylate Copolymer To a 3-neck reaction kettle outfitted with a condenser, argon inlet, and stirrer 10.0 g of N-(6-deoxy-D-galactose)-acrylamide, 4.0 g acrylic acid, 6.0 g of ethyl methacrylate, and 60 mL of THF are combined and mixed thoroughly. The solution is deoxygenated and warmed to 70 degrees Centigrade. To the warmed solution, 5 mL of a 5% AIBN in THF solution is added by dropwise addition. The reaction is allowed to proceed for 36 hours. The liquor is precipitated by a 50-50 mixture of ethanol/hexanes three times. The polymer is collected by filtration and dried under vacuum to yield a white solid of a PAAP methacrylate copolymer. Example 11 pAAP/Sodium Acryloyldimethyltaurate Copolymer To a 3-neck reaction kettle outfitted with a condenser, argon inlet, and stirrer is added 10.0 g of N-(6-deoxy-D-galactose)-acrylamide, 6.0 g sodium acryloyldimethyltaurate and 60 mL of water and mixed thoroughly. The solution is deoxygenated and warmed to 70 degrees Centigrade. To the warmed solution, 5 mL of a 6% (w/v) ammonium persulfate and 12% (w/v) sodium metabisulfite solution are added. The reaction is allowed to proceed for 36 hours. After the reaction, the reaction mixture is concentrated under reduced pressure at room temperature, and remaining water in the viscous liquid is removed by freeze-drying to isolate the copolymer as a white solid of PAAP/sodium acryloyldimethyltaurate copolymer.

Unless otherwise specified, the section headings are not to be taken as excluding the combinations and/or variations of embodiments in other sections and are being used for convenience only. In regard to the text and figures of the detailed description, in some embodiments, the structures depicted as his amino derivatives can be applied in a mono amino setting, simply by the removal of one of the nitrogen groups. Similarly, the structures depicted as mono amino derivatives can be applied in a his amino setting, simply by the addition of one nitrogen group as appropriate. Similarly, compositions and/or monomer embodiments can be formed into their polymeric versions (in either a homogeneous or heterogeneous manner) and that the polymers depicted also describe the monomeric forms. These aspects, of course, do not apply to the claims. The present disclosure is not to be limited in terms of the particular embodiments described in this application, which are intended as illustrations of various aspects. Many modifications and variations can be made without departing from its spirit and scope, as will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Functionally equivalent methods and apparatuses within the scope of the disclosure, in addition to those enumerated herein, will be apparent to those skilled in the art from the foregoing descriptions. Such modifications and variations are intended to fall within the scope of the appended claims. The present disclosure is to be limited only by the terms of the appended claims, along with the full scope of equivalents to which such claims are entitled. It is to be understood that this disclosure is not limited to particular methods, reagents, compounds, compositions or biological systems, which can, of course, vary. It is also to be understood that the terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only, and is not intended to be limiting. With respect to the use of substantially any plural and/or singular terms herein, those having skill in the art can translate from the plural to the singular and/or from the singular to the plural as is appropriate to the context and/or application. The various singular/plural permutations may be expressly set forth herein for sake of clarity. It will be understood by those within the art that, in general, terms used herein, and especially in the appended claims (e.g., bodies of the appended claims) are generally intended as “open” terms (e.g., the term “including” should be interpreted as “including but not limited to,” the term “having” should be interpreted as “having at least,” the term “includes” should be interpreted as “includes but is not limited to,” etc.). It will be further understood by those within the art that if a specific number of an introduced claim recitation is intended, such an intent will be explicitly recited in the claim, and in the absence of such recitation no such intent is present. For example, as an aid to understanding, the following appended claims may contain usage of the introductory phrases “at least one” and “one or more” to introduce claim recitations. However, the use of such phrases should not be construed to imply that the introduction of a claim recitation by the indefinite articles “a” or “an” limits any particular claim containing such introduced claim recitation to embodiments containing only one such recitation, even when the same claim includes the introductory phrases “one or more” or “at least one” and indefinite articles such as “a” or “an” (e.g., “a” and/or “an” should be interpreted to mean “at least one” or “one or more”); the same holds true for the use of definite articles used to introduce claim recitations. In addition, even if a specific number of an introduced claim recitation is explicitly recited, those skilled in the art will recognize that such recitation should be interpreted to mean at least the recited number (e.g., the bare recitation of “two recitations,” without other modifiers, means at least two recitations, or two or more recitations). Furthermore, in those instances where a convention analogous to “at least one of A, B, and C, etc.” is used, in general such a construction is intended in the sense one having skill in the art would understand the convention (e.g., “ a system having at least one of A, B, and C” would include but not be limited to systems that have A alone, B alone, C alone, A and B together, A and C together, B and C together, and/or A, B, and C together, etc.). In those instances where a convention analogous to “at least one of A, B, or C, etc.” is used, in general such a construction is intended in the sense one having skill in the art would understand the convention (e.g., “ a system having at least one of A, B, or C” would include but not be limited to systems that have A alone, B alone, C alone, A and B together, A and C together, B and C together, and/or A, B, and C together, etc.). It will be further understood by those within the art that virtually any disjunctive word and/or phrase presenting two or more alternative terms, whether in the description, claims, or drawings, should be understood to contemplate the possibilities of including one of the terms, either of the terms, or both terms. For example, the phrase “A or B” will be understood to include the possibilities of “A” or “B” or “A and B.” In addition, where features or aspects of the disclosure are described in terms of Markush groups, those skilled in the art will recognize that the disclosure is also thereby described in terms of any individual member or subgroup of members of the Markush group. As will be understood by one skilled in the art, for any and all purposes, such as in terms of providing a written description, all ranges disclosed herein also encompass any and all possible subranges and combinations of subranges thereof. Any listed range can be easily recognized as sufficiently describing and enabling the same range being broken down into at least equal halves, thirds, quarters, fifths, tenths, etc. As a non-limiting example, each range discussed herein can be readily broken down into a lower third, middle third and upper third, etc. As will also be understood by one skilled in the art all language such as “up to,” “at least,” and the like include the number recited and refer to ranges which can be subsequently broken down into subranges as discussed above. Finally, as will be understood by one skilled in the art, a range includes each individual member. Thus, for example, a group having 1-3 cells refers to groups having 1, 2, or 3 cells. Similarly, a group having 1-5 cells refers to groups having 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 cells, and so forth. From the foregoing, it will be appreciated that various embodiments of the present disclosure have been described herein for purposes of illustration, and that various modifications may be made without departing from the scope and spirit of the present disclosure.
