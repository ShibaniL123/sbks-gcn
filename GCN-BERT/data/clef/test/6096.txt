CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61/485,462 filed on May 12, 2011 and entitled “Systems and Methods for Improved Customizable, Embellished Footwear,” which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. FIELD OF INVENTION The present disclosure generally relates to systems and methods for improved customizable, embellished footwear. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Consumers are ever searching for footwear that is comfortable, that matches outfit color schemes, that is of an appropriate dressiness (casual, fancy, etc.), that is suitable for various types of weather, that is in keeping with the latest fashions and trends, etc. Meeting all of these demands requires consumers spend an inordinate amount of money on footwear that may only be used occasionally. Thus, others have developed customizable footwear that can be used for multiple occasions, with only the attachment or detachment of embellishments. However, others' footwear suffers from many defects. For example the embellishments may rotate out of the proper orientation, the footwear may not be worn without the embellishments, the embellishments may cause discomfort, and others. There is thus a need in the art for improved customizable, embellished footwear. The present invention addresses this need. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In accordance with exemplary embodiments, the present disclosure comprises footwear having one or more eyelets through which a backing element and a decorative top engage each other. The footwear preferably comprises a sandal or a flip flop and the eyelet may be located anywhere on the footwear, preferably on a strap, The eyelet may be configured to receive a decorative element. The eyelet may have a frame comprising one or more internal non-elliptical features forming an internal perimeter of the eyelet frame such as one or more internal polygonal features comprising at least three internal straight sides configured to engage one or more external geometric features (e.g. a polygonal feature comprising at least three external straight sides or any other external non-elliptical or non-circular shape or feature) of one or both of the backing element and the decorative top (for example a post of the decorative element) to prevent unwanted rotation of the decorative top. A notch and groove type configuration between the eyelet and one or both of the backing element and the decorative element and/or weight distribution of the decorative element may also be used to prevent unwanted rotation and thereby maintain the decorative top's desired orientation. Similarly, the decorative top may be configured with an indexing feature. The indexing feature may be integral with the post protruding from the bottom of the decorative element. The indexing feature may also be coupled to or integrally formed in the decorative top. The indexing feature may be configured to engage a plurality of indexing holes, such that the decorative element may be positioned in various orientations. In exemplary embodiments, the eyelet may itself have decorative characteristics such that the footwear may be worn without the backing element and the decorative top. The backing element and the decorative top may engage each other threadably or with one or more snaps, clips or the like. Magnetism may also be used. The backing element may also have a smooth, rounded and/or soft external surface to provide added comfort to the wearer. In exemplary embodiments, the decorative top itself is an embellishment or is coupled to an embellishment. Exemplary embellishments may comprise crosses, stars, flowers, logos, and the like. In yet other exemplary embodiments, an embellishment is layered between the eyelet and the decorative top and may have an eyelet substantially similar to the footwear's eyelet. In still other exemplary embodiments, an embellishment layered between the eyelet and the decorative top extends over one or more straps of the footwear. The embellishment may be connected around the strap with any suitable fastener, including for example, Velcro®, one or more snaps, clips or the like. In some exemplary embodiments, an embellishment extends over one or more straps of the footwear without being coupled at the eyelet.

Bow 121 may include eyelet 107 at center of bow 121. Eyelet 107 may vary in shape, size and material. Sliding eyelet frame 108 may have one or more internal polygonal features configured to engage one or more external geometric features (e.g. a polygonal feature) of one or both of backing element 118 and decorative top 113 (for example post 112 of decorative top 113) to prevent unwanted rotation of bow 121. Eyelet 107 may be a prong eyelet, an eyelet, a screw eyelet, a grommet, a screw grommet, a snap, a screw rivet, a hollow rivet, a rivet, a button hole, a button, a cut out shape, a threaded hole, a hollow opening, or any combination of these or other suitable embellishments, or any other embellishment mechanisms, used at least in part to fix rotation of bow 121. In various embodiments, sliding eyelet frame 108 is two pieces. However, eyelet 104 may comprise any number of pieces. In operation, bow 121 may removably attach to sandal/flip flop 105 in various ways. For example, bow 121 may attach by sliding eyelet 107 comprising sliding eyelet frame 108 of bow 121 along post 112 located on decorative top 113 and by sliding post 112 of decorative top 113 through eyelet 104 comprising stationary eyelet frame 106 located on strap 102 of sandal/flip flop 105. Bow 121 may be retained by connecting and tightening backing element 118. However, in another embodiment bow 121 may attach by sliding eyelet 107 comprising sliding eyelet frame 108 of bow 121 around eyelet 104 located on strap 102 of sandal/flip flop 105 such that sliding eyelet frame 108 is seated around an outer perimeter 130 of stationary eyelet frame 106. Decorative top 113 is configured to slide post 112 through eyelet 104 comprising stationary eyelet frame 106 located on strap 102 of sandal/flip flop 105. Bow 121 may be retained by connecting and tightening backing element 118.
