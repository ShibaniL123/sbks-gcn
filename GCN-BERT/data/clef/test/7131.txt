BICYCLIC PYRROLE DERIVATIVES USEFUL AS AGONISTS OF GPR120 CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims the benefit of U. S. Provisional Application 61/783,158, filed on March 14, 2013, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention is directed to bicyclic pyrrole derivatives, pharmaceutical compositions containing them and their use in the treatment of disorders and conditions modulated by GPR120. More particularly, the compounds of the present invention are agonists of GPR120, useful in the treatment of related diseases and disorders, such as for example, Type II diabetes mellitus. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION A diabetes mellitus epidemic is unfolding across the globe with the World Health Organization (WHO) reporting a worldwide prevalence of 177 million patients with diabetes. It is estimated that the incidence of all forms of diabetes totals approximately 2.8% of the world population. The number of newly diagnosed diabetic patients is increasing by 4-5% per year. The total number of people with diabetes worldwide is projected to rise to 366 million (4.4% prevalence) in 2030. Type 2 diabetes accounts for approximately 95% of all diabetes cases. Long-term complications of type 2 diabetes include atherosclerosis, heart disease, stroke, end-stage renal disease, retinopathy leading to blindness, nerve damage, sexual dysfunction, frequent infections, and difficuIt-to-treat foot ulcers, sometimes resulting in lower limb amputation. Diabetics are twice as likely to develop cardiovascular disease or have a stroke, 2 to 6 times more likely to have transient ischemic attacks, and 15 to 40 times more likely to require lower-limb amputation compared with the general population. The total estimated cost of diabetes in 2007 in the US was $174 billion, including $116 billion in medical expenditures. The largest components of medical expenditures attributed to diabetes are hospital inpatient care (50% of total cost), diabetes medication and supplies (12%), retail prescriptions to treat complications of diabetes (11 %), and physician office visits (9%). This may be related to the lack of durable efficacy of current drug therapies for Type 2 diabetes (> 50% Type 2 patients are not reaching the targeted blood glucose control with current oral medications after 5 years of treatment). There is a general consensus that a considerable need exists for improved awareness, diagnosis and new, more effective, drug therapies for diabetes. GLP-1 is secreted from specific cells in the colon according to a meal and is a key regulator of glucose homeostasis, linking the gut, brain and pancreas. GLP-1 potentiates insulin secretion, reduces glucagon secretion and preserves β-ο℮ΐΐ function whilst also improving satiety. Levels of post-prandial GLP-1 are reduced in type 2 diabetics and dramatically elevated according to gastric by-pass surgery, contributing to the amelioration of type 2 diabetes in these patients. Approaches that prolong the half-life of GLP-1 (JANUVIA (Merck), GALVUS (Novartis)) or activate the GLP-1 receptor (ΒΥΕΤΤΑ (Amylin)) have been recently approved for use in type 2 diabetes. Hyperinsulinemia in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus results from peripheral insulin resistance, coupled with inadequate pancreatic insulin secretion and elevated glucagon levels. There is a strong correlation between obesity and peripheral insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia. Accumulation of free fatty acids in insulin responsive tissues other than fat (i.e. muscle and liver) results in tissue insulin resistance. Additionally, free fatty acids have a direct effect on the pancreas and in the colon and further stimulate glucosedependent insulin secretion and GLP-1 release with acute exposure whereas chronic exposure of free fatty acids impairs insulin secretion and becomes toxic to the β-ο℮ΐΐ. In the liver, hyperinsulinemia per se has been linked to exacerbating insulin resistance by increasing liver fatty acid accumulation and hepatic glucose output creating a vicious cycle of disease progression. Current therapeutic strategies only partially address the complex pathology of free fatty acids in the exacerbation of diabetes. Agents that target both liver and pancreas function, directly or indirectly via GLP-1 release, either individually or in combination with current treatment, could significantly improve blood glucose control while maintaining β-℮℮11 function. Agents that potentiate GLP-1 release also have the ability to reduce weight, providing additional benefits. GPR120 is a seven transmembrane g-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) that is predominantly expressed in the intestine and adipose. GPR120 functions as a receptor for long chain free fatty acids (FFAs). Acute FFA stimulation of GPR120 in GLP-1 expressing cell-lines amplifies GLP-1 release. Administration of a-linolenic acid into the colon of mice increases GLP-1 and potentiates insulin release according to a glucose challenge. In contrast to agonists of GPR40, the existing literature suggests that a GPR120 agonist would potentiate insulin secretion and reduce glucagon indirectly via GLP-1 release. GPR120 is also expressed in adipose, with expression induced during differentiation. Inhibition of GPR120 expression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes has been shown to reduce adipocyte differentiation. The role of the receptor in the adipose or in the taste cells of the tongue where it has also been found remains unclear. GPR120 is a Gq coupled GPCR that acts a receptor for long chain fatty acids. It belongs to a family of lipid binding GPCRs that include GPR 40, 41, 43. Functionally, GPR120s closest homolog is GPR40. The cloned rat and mouse GPR120 receptors have been cloned and have >85% homology with the human receptor. GPR120 signals through Gq to elevate intracellular Ca+2 levels as well as activate MAP kinase signal transduction cascades. GPR120’s activation of calcium flux and PKC activation is most likely how FFAs contribute to the release GLP-1 in the L-cell. Although relatively little is known about GPR120 due to lack of potent, selective pharmacological tools or a documented metabolic phenotype of GPR120 knockout mice, the potential to elevate GLP-1 from a small-molecule perspective is attractive as a novel approach to unmet medical need in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus and related disorders. The beneficial effects of elevating GLP-1 are already well validated in the clinic and in addition to improved glucose homeostasis, offer the potential of weight loss. Thus it is theorized that GPR120 agonists may be complementary to existing diabetes therapies that affect liver insulin sensitivity and those that preserve β-℮℮ΐΐ function. There remains a need for GPR120 agonists for the treatment of disorders including, but not limited to obesity, Type II diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and the like.

Where the processes for the preparation of the compounds according to the invention give rise to mixture of stereoisomers, these isomers may be separated by conventional techniques such as preparative chromatography. The compounds may be prepared in racemic form, or individual enantiomers may be prepared either by enantiospecific synthesis or by resolution. The compounds may, for example, be resolved into their component enantiomers by standard techniques, such as the formation of diastereomeric pairs by salt formation with an optically active acid, such as (-)-di-p-toluoyl-D-tartaric acid and/or (+)-di-p-toluoyl-L-tartaric acid followed by fractional crystallization and regeneration of the free base. The compounds may also be resolved by formation of diastereomeric esters or amides, followed by chromatographic separation and removal of the chiral auxiliary. Alternatively, the compounds may be resolved using a chiral HPLC column. Additionally, chiral HPLC against a standard may be used to determine percent enantiomeric excess (%ee). The enantiomeric excess may be calculated as follows [ (Rmoles-Smoles)/(Rmoles+Smoles) ] X 100% where Rmoles and Smoles are the R and S mole fractions in the mixture such that Rmoles+Smoles = 1. The enantiomeric excess may alternatively be calculated from the specific rotations of the desired enantiomer and the prepared mixture as follows: ℮℮ = ([a-obs] / [a-max]) X 100.

PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS The present invention further comprises pharmaceutical compositions containing one or more compounds of formula (I) with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Pharmaceutical compositions containing one or more of the compounds of the invention described herein as the active ingredient can be prepared by intimately mixing the compound or compounds with a pharmaceutical carrier according to conventional pharmaceutical compounding techniques. The carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending upon the desired route of administration (e.g., oral, parenteral). Thus for liquid oral preparations such as suspensions, elixirs and solutions, suitable carriers and additives include water, glycols, oils, alcohols, flavoring agents, preservatives, stabilizers, coloring agents and the like; for solid oral preparations, such as powders, capsules and tablets, suitable carriers and additives include starches, sugars, diluents, granulating agents, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like. Solid oral preparations may also be coated with substances such as sugars or be enteric-coated so as to modulate major site of absorption. For parenteral administration, the carrier will usually consist of sterile water and other ingredients may be added to increase solubility or preservation. Injectable suspensions or solutions may also be prepared utilizing aqueous carriers along with appropriate additives. To prepare the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention, one or more compounds of the present invention as the active ingredient is intimately admixed with a pharmaceutical carrier according to conventional pharmaceutical compounding techniques, which carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending of the form of preparation desired for administration, e.g., oral or parenteral such as intramuscular. In preparing the compositions in oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed. Thus, for liquid oral preparations, such as for example, suspensions, elixirs and solutions, suitable carriers and additives include water, glycols, oils, alcohols, flavoring agents, preservatives, coloring agents and the like; for solid oral preparations such as, for example, powders, capsules, caplets, gelcaps and tablets, suitable carriers and additives include starches, sugars, diluents, granulating agents, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like. Because of their ease in administration, tablets and capsules represent the most advantageous oral dosage unit form, in which case solid pharmaceutical carriers are obviously employed. If desired, tablets may be sugar coated or enteric coated by standard techniques. For parenterals, the carrier will usually comprise sterile water, through other ingredients, for example, for purposes such as aiding solubility or for preservation, may be included. Injectable suspensions may also be prepared, in which case appropriate liquid carriers, suspending agents and the like may be employed. The pharmaceutical compositions herein will contain, per dosage unit, e.g., tablet, capsule, powder, injection, teaspoonful and the like, an amount of the active ingredient necessary to deliver an effective dose as described above. The pharmaceutical compositions herein will contain, per unit dosage unit, e.g., tablet, capsule, powder, injection, suppository, teaspoonful and the like, of from about 0.01 mg to about 1000 mg or any amount or range therein, and may be given at a dosage of from about 0.01 mg/kg/day to about 300 mg/kg/day, or any amount or range therein, preferably from about 0.1 mg/kg/day to about 100 mg/kg/day, or any amount or range therein, preferably from about 0.5 mg/kg/day to about 50 mg/kg/day, preferably from about 1.0 mg/kg/day to about 25 mg/kg/day, or any amount or range therein. The dosages, however, may be varied depending upon the requirement of the patients, the severity of the condition being treated and the compound being employed. The use of either daily administration or post-periodic dosing may be employed. Preferably these compositions are in unit dosage forms from such as tablets, pills, capsules, powders, granules, sterile parenteral solutions or suspensions, metered aerosol or liquid sprays, drops, ampoules, autoinjector devices or suppositories; for oral parenteral, intranasal, sublingual or rectal administration, or for administration by inhalation or insufflation. Alternatively, the composition may be presented in a form suitable for once-weekly or oncemonthly administration; for example, an insoluble salt of the active compound, such as the decanoate salt, may be adapted to provide a depot preparation for intramuscular injection. For preparing solid compositions such as tablets, the principal active ingredient is mixed with a pharmaceutical carrier, e.g. conventional tableting ingredients such as corn starch, lactose, sucrose, sorbitol, talc, stearic acid, magnesium stearate, dicalcium phosphate or gums, and other pharmaceutical diluents, e.g. water, to form a solid preformulation composition containing a homogeneous mixture of a compound of the present invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. When referring to these preformulation compositions as homogeneous, it is meant that the active ingredient is dispersed evenly throughout the composition so that the composition may be readily subdivided into equally effective dosage forms such as tablets, pills and capsules. This solid preformulation composition is then subdivided into unit dosage forms of the type described above containing from about 0.01 mg to about 1,000 mg, or any amount or range therein, of the active ingredient of the present invention. The tablets or pills of the novel composition can be coated or otherwise compounded to provide a dosage form affording the advantage of prolonged action. For example, the tablet or pill can comprise an inner dosage and an outer dosage component, the latter being in the form of an envelope over the former. The two components can be separated by an enteric layer which serves to resist disintegration in the stomach and permits the inner component to pass intact into the duodenum or to be delayed in release. A variety of material can be used for such enteric layers or coatings, such materials including a number of polymeric acids with such materials as shellac, cetyl alcohol and cellulose acetate. The liquid forms in which the novel compositions of the present invention may be incorporated for administration orally or by injection include, aqueous solutions, suitably flavoured syrups, aqueous or oil suspensions, and flavored emulsions with edible oils such as cottonseed oil, sesame oil, coconut oil or peanut oil, as well as elixirs and similar pharmaceutical vehicles. Suitable dispersing or suspending agents for aqueous suspensions, include synthetic and natural gums such as tragacanth, acacia, alginate, dextran, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, polyvinyl-pyrrolidone or gelatin. The method(s) of treating disorders as described herein may also be carried out using a pharmaceutical composition comprising any of the compounds as defined herein and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The pharmaceutical composition may contain between about 0.01 mg and about 1000 mg of the compound, or any amount or range therein; preferably from about 1.0 mg to about 500 mg of the compound, or any amount or range therein, and may be constituted into any form suitable for the mode of administration selected. Carriers include necessary and inert pharmaceutical excipients, including, but not limited to, binders, suspending agents, lubricants, flavorants, sweeteners, preservatives, dyes, and coatings. Compositions suitable for oral administration include solid forms, such as pills, tablets, caplets, capsules (each including immediate release, timed release and sustained release formulations), granules, and powders, and liquid forms, such as solutions, syrups, elixers, emulsions, and suspensions. Forms useful for parenteral administration include sterile solutions, emulsions and suspensions. Advantageously, compounds of the present invention may be administered in a single daily dose, or the total daily dosage may be administered in divided doses of two, three or four times daily. Furthermore, compounds for the present invention can be administered in intranasal form via topical use of suitable intranasal vehicles, or via transdermal skin patches well known to those of ordinary skill in that art. To be administered in the form of a transdermal delivery system, the dosage administration will, of course, be continuous rather than intermittent throughout the dosage regimen. For instance, for oral administration in the form of a tablet or capsule, the active drug component can be combined with an oral, non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable inert carrier such as ethanol, glycerol, water and the like. Moreover, when desired or necessary, suitable binders; lubricants, disintegrating agents and coloring agents can also be incorporated into the mixture. Suitable binders include, without limitation, starch, gelatin, natural sugars such as glucose or betalactose, corn sweeteners, natural and synthetic gums such as acacia, tragacanth or sodium oleate, sodium stearate, magnesium stearate, sodium benzoate, sodium acetate, sodium chloride and the like. Disintegrators include, without limitation, starch, methyl cellulose, agar, bentonite, xanthan gum and the like. The liquid forms in suitably flavored suspending or dispersing agents such as the synthetic and natural gums, for example, tragacanth, acacia, methylcellulose and the like. For parenteral administration, sterile suspensions and solutions are desired. Isotonic preparations which generally contain suitable preservatives are employed when intravenous administration is desired. To prepare a pharmaceutical composition of the present invention, a compound of formula (I) as the active ingredient is intimately admixed with a pharmaceutical carrier according to conventional pharmaceutical compounding techniques, which carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending of the form of preparation desired for administration (e.g. oral or parenteral). Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers are well known in the art. Descriptions of some of these pharmaceutically acceptable carriers may be found in The Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients, published by the American Pharmaceutical Association and the Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain. Methods of formulating pharmaceutical compositions have been described in numerous publications such as Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms: Tablets. Second Edition. Revised and Expanded. Volumes 1-3, edited by Lieberman et al; Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms: Parenteral Medications. Volumes 1-2, edited by Avis et al; and Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms: Disperse Systems, Volumes 1-2, edited by Lieberman et al; published by Marcel Dekker, Inc. Compounds of this invention may be administered in any of the foregoing compositions and according to dosage regimens established in the art whenever treatment of disorders, as described herein, is required. The daily dosage of the products may be varied over a wide range from about 0.01 mg to about 1,000 mg per adult human per day, or any amount or range therein. For oral administration, the compositions are preferably provided in the form of tablets containing, 0.01,0.05, 0.1,0.5, 1.0, 2.5, 5.0, 10.0, 15.0, 25.0, 50.0, 100, 150, 200, 250 and 500 milligrams of the active ingredient for the symptomatic adjustment of the dosage to the patient to be treated. An effective amount of the drug is ordinarily supplied at a dosage level of from about 0.01 mg/kg to about 300 mg/kg of body weight per day, or any amount or range therein. Preferably, the range is from about 0.1 to about 100.0 mg/kg of body weight per day, or any amount or range therein. More preferably, from about 0.5 to about 50.0 mg/kg of body weight per day, or any amount or range therein. More preferably, from about 1.0 to about 25.0 mg/kg of body weight per day, or any amount or range therein. The compounds may be administered on a regimen of 1 to 4 times per day. Optimal dosages to be administered may be readily determined by those skilled in the art, and will vary with the particular compound used, the mode of administration, the strength of the preparation, the mode of administration, and the advancement of the disease condition. In addition, factors associated with the particular patient being treated, including patient age, weight, diet and time of administration, will result in the need to adjust dosages. One skilled in the art will recognize that, both in vivo and in vitro trials using suitable, known and generally accepted cell and / or animal models are predictive of the ability of a test compound to treat or prevent a given disorder. One skilled in the art will further recognize that human clinical trials including first-in-human, dose ranging and efficacy trials, in healthy patients and / or those suffering from a given disorder, may be completed according to methods well known in the clinical and medical arts.

Mass spectrum (ESI, m/z): Calcd. for CuHnCIFsNCfe, 318.0 (Μ+Η), found 318.1 Biological Example 1: in vitro Assay Human GPR120 DiscoveRx PathHunter B-Arrestin assay Assay Principle: The binding of an agonist (medium/long chain fatty acids or small molecule agonists) to the G-protein-coupled receptor GPR120 activates phospholipase C, leading to release of intracellular Ca+2 through the generation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (lnsP3 or IP3). GPR120 activation can also trigger intracellular signaling via recruitment of 3-Arrestin. In the present method, agonist-induced activation of the human GPR120 receptor is monitored through the use of PathHunter CHO-K1 GPR120 3-Arrestin Cell Line engineered by DiscoveRx, as detailed below. The cell lines are designed to coexpress both the ProLink/Enzyme Donor (PK)-tagged GPCR and the Enzyme Activator (EA)-tagged Beta-Arrestin fusion proteins. Upon GPR120 receptor stimulation / activation, the EA-tagged 3-Arrestin portion is translocated to the tagged receptor, where the two enzyme fragments are brought within close proximity. Under these conditions, these fragments can interact and form an active Beta-gal enzyme complex through Enzyme Fragment Complementation (EFC). This active Beta-gal complex can enzymatically hydrolyse the substrate to produce a detectable light signal; therefore, activation as a function of agonist concentration can be expressed as an EC50 value to determine relative compound activities. This in vitro assay therefore serves to assess compound agonist activity of the GPR120. Procedure B-arrestin A: In Procedure 3-arrestin A, the cell used were PathHunter CHO-K1 GPR120 3-Arrestin Cell Line, expressing the long form of human GPR120 (Genbank accession number NM_181745), with 3000 cells per well. Procedure B-arrestin Β: In Procedure 3-arrestin Β the cells used were PathHunter CHO-K1 GPR120S 3-Arrestin Cell Line, expressing the short form of the GPR120 receptor (Accession #NM_181745), with 5000 cells/well. Assay Procedure: The selected CHO-K1 GPR120 3-Arrestin cells were cultured in Ham’s F12 media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% Glutamine, 1χ p/s, 800 pg/ml G418 and 300 pg/ml Hygromycin Β (for selection). Cell stocks were maintained and grown in a sub-confluent state using standard cell culture procedures. The day before the experiment, the cells were harvested with non-enzymatic cell dissociation buffer and re-suspended in complete growth media at the desired concentration. A Corning 384-plate was then seeded with the proper number of cells in a volume of 25 pL, per well. The seeded plates were incubated overnight at 37°C. On the day of the experiment, the Assay Buffer containing (a) HBSS with Ca++ and Mg++, (b) 20 mM HEPES, and (c) 0.1% BSA stabilizer (pH 7.4) was prepared. The growth medium was gently removed from the cell plates and 20pL of Assay Buffer added to each well. The plate was then incubated at 37°C for 60 mins. Test compounds were serially diluted in Assay Buffer to desired concentrations (more particularly, to one or more of the following μΜ concentrations: 25μΜ, 12.5μΜ, 6.25μΜ, 3.125μΜ, 1.562μΜ, 0.781 μΜ, 0.391 μΜ, 0.195μΜ, 0.098μΜ, 0.049μΜ, 0.024μΜ, 0.012μΜ). Five μΐ of compound dilution was then added to each well and the plate incubated at 37°C for 90 mins. The detection reagents were prepared according to the manufacture’s instruction. Twelve pL of the detection reagents were added to each well and the plate incubated at room temperature for 60 mins. The plates were read on an EnVision instrument, using Protocol name: Luminescence, Plate type: 384 Costar, Measurement height: 3 mm, Measurement time: 1 s, Aperture: 384 Plate aperture. The %activity relative to the positive control was calculated using the following equation: Countcompound- Countvehide %Activity = Χ100% Countp0stivite control" CountvehjC|e The %Activity values were plotted versus the concentration of test compound and fitted to a sigmoidal dose-response curve with a Hill slope = 1 (fixed value) using nonlinear regression with GraphPad Prism 5.0 to calculate the EC50 values. The Fitting Equation was: Y=Bottom + (Τορ- Bottom)/(1 +10A((LogEC5o-X)*HillSlope)), where X is the log of the concentration and Υ is the response. Biological Example 2: in vitro Assay Human GPR120 in Calcium Flux Assay Assay Principle This in vitro assay serves to assess test compound agonist activity against the short splice variant (SVS with Accession number NM_001195755.1 confirmed by sequencing data) of the GPR120 receptor. The Human Short splice variant #2 (NM_001195755.1) is missing an in-frame coding exon compared to variant 1 (the Human Long splice variant NM_181745.3), resulting in a shorter isoform (GPR120-S) lacking a 16 aa protein segment compared to isoform GPR120-L. The assay platform utilizes HEK-293 cells stably transfected to express the Human GPR120 short form. These cells are first loaded with the Ca+2 sensitive dye, Fluo-4 NW. Upon stimulation, intracellular released Ca+2 can bind to the dye and alter its fluorescence intensity. This increase in fluorescence signal, and thus the flux in intracellular [Ca2+], is detected and quantitated by fluorescence imaging using a FLIPR reader. The effect of the agonist is measured as a function of concentration and used to calculate an EC50 based upon a response curve. Procedure Calcium A: In this procedure 2500 cells / well were employed. Procedure Calcium Β: In this procedure 4200 cells/well were employed. Assay Procedure: A Human GPR120 clone (Genbank accession number NM_001195755.1) was placed into the pcDNA3.1 mammalian expression vector carrying the neomycin resistance gene. A stable mammalian cell was generated by placing the above clone into a ΗΕΚ293 background. Clonal cells responding to long chain fatty acids had expression levels of GPR120 confirmed by RT-qPCR. Human HEK-GPR120 cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM)/F12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% L-Glutamine and 1% penicillin/streptomycin and 0.5 mg/ml G-418. Cells were split 2 times a week to keep the cells in the log-phase growth. In preparation for the assay, ΗΕΚ cells stably transfected with Human GPR120 (2.5Κ cells per well in 25uL growth medium) were seeded into 384-well plates and then incubated overnight (37°C, 5% C02). The next day, the media was changed to 20 μΐ assay buffer and the cell starved for 1 h at 37°C. The dye loading solution (2Χ dye) was prepared using 10 ml assay buffer, 100 μΐ of 250 mM probenecid, 1 bottle of Component A, and 20 μΐ of dye in DMSO. Twenty μΐ of the 2Χ dye loading buffer was then added to each well. The plates were incubated at 37°C for 30 min, then at room temperature for an additional 15 minutes, before performing the assay on FLIPR. Test compounds were prepared in assay buffer (2 μΐ of test compound + 198 μΐ assay buffer, final DMSO in assay plate is 0.2%) at the desired concentration, more particularly at 100μΜ, 50μΜ, 25μΜ, 12.5μΜ, 6.25μΜ, 3.125μΜ, 1.562μΜ, 0.781 μΜ, 0.391 μΜ, 0.195μΜ, 0.098μΜ, 0.049μΜ, 0.024μΜ and 0.012 μΜ. The assay was performed on a FLIPR plate reader using the following parameters. Baseline was read for 10 seconds at 1 sec intervals. The program was set to transfer 10pL of ligand from compound plate to cell plate after baseline reading. Aspiration was executed at: 10pl/sec speed, 4.6μΐ height; Dispensing was executed at: 30pl/sec speed, 45μΐ height. After compound addition, each well was read for 300 sec, with measurements collected at 1 sec intervals. The kinetic data from the FLIPR was based upon a 5 minute window for data collection. The fluorescence of each sample well was used for individual calculations of a normalized RFU value, which was defined as maximum minus the minimum response. The normalized fluorescence reading (RFU)calculated as follows: RFU = Fmax - Fmin data were fitted to a sigmoidal dose-response curve with a variable Hill(<2) using nonlinear regression with GraphPad Prism 5.0 to calculate thevalues. The Fitting Equation was: Y=Bottom + (Top- +10A((LogEC5o-X)*HillSlope)), where X is the log of the concentration and Υthe response. compounds of formula (I) were tested according to as described in Biological Example 1 and 2 above, with results as listed3 below.

The animals were sorted into treatment groups the day before the study by body weight. Animals outside the bounds of ~30-50g were left out of the study. The animals had been handled and shammed a total of 5-8 days (1-3 days immediately prior to the study). Glucose (in 1ml syringes) was drawn up the morning of the study. Test compounds were kept spinning and were only drawn into 1ml syringes prior to study commencement. Animals were bled via tail snip to determine basal glucose levels prior to dosing of treatments. An Ascensia BREEZE Blood Glucose Monitoring System by Bayer was used for determining glucose levels. Animals were moved into the testing room at ~9-11am, to yield them time to acclimate. The bleeds and dosing started at approximately 1 pm in 30-second intervals per animal. All groups were dosed 30 minutes prior to glucose administration at a dose volume of 10ml/kg (the dose volume was calculated separately for each individual animal). Test compounds were administered at two or more of the following dosages: 0.1 mg/kg, 0.3 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg. Thirty minutes after the first dose (with test compound) animals were bled again for a second baseline, or Τ=0, and immediately dosed with glucose (20% solution; TEKNOVA, 250ml sterile bottle w/ catalogue number G0525) via a ΡΟ injection. The exact dose volume for glucose was also calculated separately for each individual animal. Blood glucose was measured at 15, 30, 45, 60, and 90 minutes post-glucose administration via the snipped tail. If an animal reached a value of “HI”, the upper limit of the glucometer (600mg/dl) was substituted as the blood glucose value and the study was analyzed as normal with no exclusions. If 50% or more of any treatment group reaches a “HI” value at least once, the study was considered invalid and repeated. Glucose values were typed into an EXCEL spreadsheet where they were used to calculate glucose AUC and delta AUC post-compound and post-glucose. The glucose excursion curves and the different versions of the AUC’s were graphed in GraphPad Prism 5. Statistical Methods: Note: All statistics completed in this study were completed using the statistical software package GraphPad Prism 5. Standard procedures for analyzing data sets from screening GPR120 compounds in DIO mouse OGTT's were as listed here below. In addition to the statistics that were run using GraphPad Prism 5, Microsoft Excel was used to calculate the percent changes in AUC from vehicle groups as detailed below. Change from -30 to 0 BSLN Glucose, Raw Glucose AUC -30 to 90min, Delta Glucose AUC -30 to 90min, Raw Glucose AUC 0 to 90min, Delta Glucose AUC 0 to 90min were analyzed using Column Statistics Analysis, with mean values used to calculate % change from the vehicle mean group, as well as mean, SEM and / or % change from vehicle, where appropriate; and using One-Way ANOVA w/ a Tukey Post-Test (Comparing All Pairs of Columns) with each treatment group examined to see if it was statistically significant compared to vehicle (*= P<0.05, **= P<0.01, ***= P<0.001). Representative compounds of the present invention were tested according to the procedure as described in Biological Example 3, with results as listed in Table 3-4, below.

Individual mice weighed anywhere in the range of 25-30 grams on study day. The mice were fasted, with removal of food occurring at 7am on the morning of the study. Animals were moved into the room at 10:00am, to give them time to acclimate. Glucose (insulin syringes) was drawn up either the night before or the morning of the study. Glucose was dosed (IP) at 1.5g/kg at 7.5ml/kg (20% glucose straight TEKNOVA, 250ml sterile bottle w/ catalogue number G0525). Test compounds were kept spinning and were only drawn into the syringes prior to study commencement. Animals were bled via tail snip to determine basal glucose levels prior to dosing of treatments. An Ascensia BREEZE Blood Glucose Monitoring System by Bayer (using unique 10-test disks) was used for determining glucose levels. The bleeds started at approximately 12:45pm and dosing started, at 1-minute intervals, immediately after. All groups were dosed 30 minutes prior to glucose administration at a dose volume of 10ml/kg (the dose volume was calculated separately for each individual animal). Thirty minutes after the first dose animals were bled again for a second baseline, or Τ=0, and immediately dosed with glucose via an i.p. injection. The exact dose volume for glucose was also calculated separately for each individual animal. Glucose measurements were taken at -30min prior to compound dose, at t=0 (immediately prior to glucose dose), and at 15, 30, 45, 60, 90min post glucose dose. Glucose values were entered into an Excel sheet and graphed in GraphPad Prism. The following were calculated from Prism: Change from -30 to 0 BSLN Glucose, Raw Glucose AUC -30 to 90min, Delta Glucose AUC -30 to 90min, Raw Glucose AUC 0 to 90min, Delta Glucose AUC 0 to 90min. Β: C57bl6 mouse OGTT: The assay design is the same as that described above for the C57bl6 mouse IPGTT. The difference is that glucose was dosed ΡΟ at 3g/kg, 7.5ml/kg of 40% glucose.
