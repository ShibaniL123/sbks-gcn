The present disclosure relates to an organic electroluminescent compound and an organic electroluminescent device comprising the same. An electroluminescent (EL) device is a self-light-emitting device which has advantages in that it provides a wider viewing angle, a greater contrast ratio, and a faster response time. An organic EL device was first developed by Eastman Kodak in 1987, by using small aromatic diamine molecules and aluminum complexes as materials to form a light-emitting layer [Appl. Phys. Lett. 51, 913, 1987]. The most important factor determining luminous efficiency in the organic EL device is light-emitting materials. Until now, fluorescent materials have been widely used as light-emitting material. However, in view of electroluminescent mechanisms, since phosphorescent materials theoretically enhance luminous efficiency by four (4) times compared to fluorescent materials, phosphorescent light-emitting materials are widely being researched. Iridium(III) complexes have been widely known as phosphorescent materials, including bis(2-(2’-benzothienyl)-pyridinato-N,C3’)iridium(acetylacetonate) ((acac)Ir(btp)2), tris(2-phenylpyridine)iridium (Ir(ppy)3) and bis(4,6-difluorophenylpyridinato-N,C2)picolinate iridium (Firpic) as red-, green-, and blue-emitting materials, respectively. At present, 4,4’-N,N’-dicarbazol-biphenyl (CBP) is the most widely known host material for phosphorescent materials. Recently, Pioneer (Japan) et al., developed a high performance organic EL device using bathocuproine (BCP) and aluminum(III)bis(2-methyl-8-quinolinate)(4-phenylphenolate) (BAlq) etc., as host materials, which were known as hole blocking materials. Although these materials provide good light-emitting characteristics, they have the following disadvantages: (1) Due to their low glass transition temperature and poor thermal stability, their degradation may occur during a high-temperature deposition process in a vacuum. (2) The power efficiency of the organic EL device is given by [(π/voltage) × current efficiency], and the power efficiency is inversely proportional to the voltage. Although the organic EL device comprising phosphorescent host materials provides higher current efficiency (cd/A) than one comprising fluorescent materials, a significantly high driving voltage is necessary. Thus, there is no merit in terms of power efficiency (lm/W). (3) Furthermore, the operational lifespan of the organic EL device is short, and luminous efficiency still needs to be improved. Korean Patent Application Laying-open No. 10-2012-0095997 discloses a compound in which at least one carbon atom of a crosslinked triarylamine is replaced with a nitrogen atom. However, it fails to disclose a compound in which the nitrogen-containing moiety is a quinoline or quinoxaline. The first objective of the present disclosure is to provide an organic electroluminescent compound which can provide an organic electroluminescent device having a long lifespan and a lowered driving voltage and showing excellence in luminous efficiency such as current efficiency and power efficiency, and color purity. The second objective of the present disclosure is to provide an organic electroluminescent device comprising the organic electroluminescent compound. The present inventors found that the above objective can be achieved by an organic electroluminescent compound represented by the following formula 1. wherein X and Y, each independently, represent -CR12- or -N-, with the proviso that X and Y are not be simultaneously -CR12-, and R1 to R12, each independently, represent hydrogen, deuterium, a halogen, a cyano, a substituted or unsubstituted (C1-C30)alkyl, a substituted or unsubstituted (C6-C30)aryl, a substituted or unsubstituted 3- to 30-membered heteroaryl, a substituted or unsubstituted (C3-C30)cycloalkyl, a substituted or unsubstituted (C1-C30)alkoxy, a substituted or unsubstituted tri(C1-C30)alkylsilyl, a substituted or unsubstituted di(C1-C30)alkyl(C6-C30)arylsilyl, a substituted or unsubstituted (C1-C30)alkyldi(C6-C30)arylsilyl, a substituted or unsubstituted tri(C6-C30)arylsilyl, a substituted or unsubstituted mono- or di-(C1-C30)alkylamino, a substituted or unsubstituted mono- or di-(C6-C30)arylamino, or a substituted or unsubstituted (C1-C30)alkyl(C6-C30)arylamino; or may be linked to an adjacent substituent(s) to form a substituted or unsubstituted 3- to 30-membered, mono- or polycyclic, alicyclic or aromatic ring, whose carbon atom(s) may be replaced with at least one hetero atom selected from the group consisting of nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur, wherein the heteroaryl contains one or more hetero atoms selected from the group consisting of B, N, O, S, Si, and P.

[Device Example 1] OLED using the compound of the present disclosure OLED was produced using the organic electroluminescent compound of the present disclosure as follows.

The ITO substrate was then mounted on a substrate holder of a vacuum vapor depositing apparatus. HI-1 was introduced into a cell of the vacuum vapor depositing apparatus, and then the pressure in the chamber of said apparatus was controlled to 10-6 torr. Thereafter, an electric current was applied to the cell to evaporate the above introduced material, thereby forming a first hole injection layer having a thickness of 80 nm on the ITO substrate. HI-2 was introduced into another cell of the vacuum vapor depositing apparatus, and was evaporated by applying an electric current to the cell, thereby forming a second hole injection layer having a thickness of 5 nm on the first hole injection layer. HT-1 was introduced into a cell of the vaccum vapor depositing apparatus, and was evaporated by applying an electric current to the cell, thereby forming a first hole transport layer having a thickness of 10 nm on the second hole injection layer. HT-2 was introduced into another cell of the vacuum vapor depositing apparatus, and was evaporated by applying an electric current to the cell, thereby forming a second hole transport layer having a thickness of 60 nm on the first hole transport layer.
