Example 4. Preparation of SM-4: 2-hydroxy-2-trifluoromethylacetophenone
A 500 ml flask was charged with phenylglyoxal hydrate (15.21 g, 100 mmol, 1.0 eq.), (trifluoromethyl)trimethylsilane (31.1 g, 205 mmol, 2.05 eq.), and dimethoxyethane (200 mL) under nitrogen stream. The mixture was stirred for 10 minutes at 0° C., after which CsF (280 mg, 2.0 mmol, 0.02 eq.) was added to the mixture in small portions over 10 minutes. The reaction mixture was stirred for 1.5 hours at 0° C. (caution: this reaction has an induction period and is exothermic). Subsequently, the mixture was stirred for 30 minutes at room temperature. THF (20 mL) and 6N HCl (80 mL) were added followed by stirring for 1.5 hours. The upper layer was separated, the lower layer was extracted with Et2O (100 ml×2), and the organic layers were combined. The organic solution was washed with brine (50 mL), dried over anhydrous MgSO4, and filtered. Solvents were removed in an evaporator and the crude product was purified by column chromatography (hexane/AcOEt) to obtain the target compound as a white solid (2.96 g, 14.5% yield).
