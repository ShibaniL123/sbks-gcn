SUBSTITUTED BICYCUIC AUKOXY PYRAZOUE ANAEOGS AS AEEOSTERIC MODUEATORS OF MGEUR5 RECEPTORS CROSS-REFERENCE TO REEATED APPLICATIONS [0001] This Application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/662,287, filed on June 20, 2012, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH [0002] This invention was made with government support under grant numbers ΜΗ73676, ΜΗ62646, and ΜΗ89870 awarded by the National Institutes of Health. The United States government has certain rights in the invention. BACKGROUND [0003] Glutamate (L-glutamic acid) is the major excitatory transmitter in the mammalian central nervous system, exerting its effects through both ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors. The metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) belong to family C (also known as family 3) of the G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). They are characterized by a seven transmembrane (7ΤΜ) a-helical domain connected via a cysteine rich-region to a large bi-lobed extracellular amino-terminal domain (Figure 1). While the orthosteric binding site is contained in the amino-terminal domain, currently known allosteric binding sites reside in the 7ΤΜ domain. The mGluR family comprises eight known mGluRs receptor types (designated as mGluRl through mGluR8). Several of the receptor types are expressed as specific splice variants, e.g. mGluR5a and mGluR5b or mGluR8a, mGluR8b and mGluR8c. The family has been classified into three groups based on their structure, preferred signal transduction mechanisms, and pharmacology. Group I receptors (mGluRl and mGluR5) are coupled to Gaq, a process that results in stimulation of phospholipase C and an increase in intracellular calcium and inositol phosphate levels. Group II receptors (mGluR2 and mGluR3) and group III receptors (mGluR4, mGluR6, mGluR7, and mGluR8) are coupled to Gai, which leads to decreases in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels. While the Group I receptors are predominately located postsynaptically and typically enhance postsynaptic signalling, the group II and III receptors are located presynaptically and typically have inhibitory effects on neurotransmitter release. [0004] Without wishing to be bound by a particular theory, metabotropic glutamate receptors, including mGluR5, have been implicated in a wide range of biological functions, indicating a potential role for the mGluR5 receptor in a variety of disease processes in mammals. Ligands of metabotropic glutamate receptors can be used for the treatment or prevention of acute and/or chronic neurological and/or psychiatric disorders associated with glutamate dysfunction, such as psychosis, schizophrenia, age-related cognitive decline, and the like. Further, without wishing to be bound by theory, increasing evidence indicates mGluRs play an important role in lasting changes in synaptic transmission, and studies of synaptic plasticity in the Fmrl knockout mouse have identified a connection between the fragile X phenotype and mGluR signalling. [0005] The identification of small molecule mGluR agonists that bind at the orthosteric site has greatly increased the understanding of the roles played by these receptors and their corresponding relation to disease. Because the majority of these agonists were designed as analogs of glutamate, they typically lack the desired characteristics for drugs targeting mGluR such as oral bioavailability and/or distribution to the central nervous system (CNS). Moreover, because of the highly conserved nature of the glutamate binding site, most orthosteric agonists lack selectivity among the various mGluRs. [0006] Selective positive allosteric modulators (“PAMs”) are compounds that do not directly activate receptors by themselves, but binding of these compounds potentiates the response of the receptor to glutamate or other orthosteric agonists by increasing the affinity of an orthosteric agonist at the orthosteric binding site. PAMs are thus an attractive mechanism for enhancing appropriate physiological receptor activation. [0007] Unfortunately, there is a scarcity of selective positive allosteric modulators for the mGluR5 receptor. Further, conventional mGluR5 receptor modulators typically lack satisfactory aqueous solubility and exhibit poor oral bioavailability. Therefore, there remains a need for methods and compositions that overcome these deficiencies and that effectively provide selective positive allosteric modulators for the mGluR5 receptor. SUMMARY [0008] In accordance with the purpose(s) of the invention, as embodied and broadly described herein, the invention, in one aspect, relates to compounds useful as positive allosteric modulators (/.℮., potentiators) of the metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 5 (mGluR5), methods of making same, pharmaceutical compositions comprising same, and methods of treating neurological and psychiatric disorders associated with glutamate dysfunction using same.

[0026] Additional advantages of the invention will be set forth in part in the description which follows, and in part will be obvious from the description, or can be learned by practice of the invention. The advantages of the invention will be realized and attained by means of the elements and combinations particularly pointed out in the appended claims. It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are not restrictive of the invention, as claimed. DESCRIPTION [0027] The present invention can be understood more readily by reference to the following detailed description of the invention and the Examples included therein. [0028] Before the present compounds, compositions, articles, systems, devices, and/or methods are disclosed and described, it is to be understood that they are not limited to specific synthetic methods unless otherwise specified, or to particular reagents unless otherwise specified, as such may, of course, vary. It is also to be understood that the terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular aspects only and is not intended to be limiting. Although any methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice or testing of the present invention, example methods and materials are now described. [0029] All publications mentioned herein are incorporated herein by reference to disclose and describe the methods and/or materials in connection with which the publications are cited. The publications discussed herein are provided solely for their disclosure prior to the filing date of the present application. Nothing herein is to be construed as an admission that the present invention is not entitled to antedate such publication by virtue of prior invention. Further, the dates of publication provided herein can be different from the actual publication dates, which can require independent confirmation. A. Definitions [0030] As used herein, nomenclature for compounds, including organic compounds, can be given using common names, IUPAC, IUBMB, or CAS recommendations for nomenclature. When one or more stereochemical features are present, Cahn-Ingold-Prelog rules for stereochemistry can be employed to designate stereochemical priority, E!Z specification, and the like. One of skill in the art can readily ascertain the structure of a compound if given a name, either by systemic reduction of the compound structure using naming conventions, or by commercially available software, such as CHEMDRAW™ (Cambridgesoft Corporation, U.S.A.). [0031] As used in the specification and the appended claims, the singular forms “a,” “an” and “the” include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, reference to “a functional group,” “an alkyl,” or “a residue” includes mixtures of two or more such functional groups, alkyls, or residues, and the like. [0032] Ranges can be expressed herein as from “about” one particular value, and/or to “about” another particular value. When such a range is expressed, a further aspect includes from the one particular value and/or to the other particular value. Similarly, when values are expressed as approximations, by use of the antecedent “about,” it will be understood that the particular value forms a further aspect, ft will be further understood that the endpoints of each of the ranges are significant both in relation to the other endpoint, and independently of the other endpoint, ft is also understood that there are a number of values disclosed herein, and that each value is also herein disclosed as “about” that particular value in addition to the value itself. For example, if the value “10” is disclosed, then “about 10” is also disclosed, ft is also understood that each unit between two particular units are also disclosed. For example, if 10 and 15 are disclosed, then 11, 12, 13, and 14 are also disclosed. [0033] References in the specification and concluding claims to parts by weight of a particular element or component in a composition denotes the weight relationship between the element or component and any other elements or components in the composition or article for which a part by weight is expressed. Thus, in a compound containing 2 parts by weight of component X and 5 parts by weight component Y, X and Y are present at a weight ratio of 2:5, and are present in such ratio regardless of whether additional components are contained in the compound. [0034] A weight percent (wt. %) of a component, unless specifically stated to the contrary, is based on the total weight of the formulation or composition in which the component is included. [0035] As used herein, the terms “optional” or “optionally” means that the subsequently described event or circumstance can or cannot occur, and that the description includes instances where said event or circumstance occurs and instances where it does not. [0036] As used herein, the term “allosteric site” refers to a ligand binding site that is topographically distinct from the orthosteric binding site. [0037] As used herein, the term “modulator” refers to a molecular entity (e.g., but not limited to, a ligand and a disclosed compound) that modulates the activity of the target receptor protein. [0038] As used herein, the term “ligand” refers to a natural or synthetic molecular entity that is capable of associating or binding to a receptor to form a complex and mediate, prevent or modify a biological effect. Thus, the term “ligand” encompasses allosteric modulators, inhibitors, activators, agonists, antagonists, natural substrates and analogs of natural substrates. [0039] As used herein, the terms “natural ligand” and “endogenous ligand” are used interchangeably, and refer to a naturally occurring ligand, found in nature, which binds to a receptor. [0040] As used herein, the term “orthosteric site” refers to the primary binding site on a receptor that is recognized by the endogenous ligand or agonist for that receptor. For example, the orthosteric site in the mGluR5 receptor is the site that glutamate binds. [0041] As used herein, the term “mGluR5 receptor positive allosteric modulator” refers to any exogenously administered compound or agent that directly or indirectly augments the activity of the mGluR5 receptor in the presence or in the absence of glutamate in an animal, in particular a mammal, for example a human. In one aspect, a mGluR5 receptor positive allosteric modulator increases the activity of the mGluR5 receptor in a cell in the presence of extracellular glutamate. The cell can be human embryonic kidney cells transfected with human mGluR5. The cell can be human embryonic kidney cells transfected with rat mGluR5. The cell can be human embryonic kidney cells transfected with a mammalian mGluR5 The term “mGluR5 receptor positive allosteric modulator” includes a compound that is a “mGluR5 receptor allosteric potentiator” or a “mGluR5 receptor allosteric agonist,” as well as a compound that has mixed activity comprising pharmacology of both an “mGluR5 receptor allosteric potentiator” and an “mGluR5 receptor allosteric agonist”. The term “mGluR5 receptor positive allosteric modulator also includes a compound that is a “mGluR5 receptor allosteric enhancer.” [0042] As used herein, the term “mGluR5 receptor allosteric potentiator” refers to any exogenously administered compound or agent that directly or indirectly augments the response produced by the endogenous ligand (such as glutamate) when the endogenous ligand binds to the orthosteric site of the mGluR5 receptor in an animal, in particular a mammal, for example a human. The mGluR5 receptor allosteric potentiator binds to a site other than the orthosteric site, that is, an allosteric site, and positively augments the response of the receptor to an agonist or the endogenous ligand. In one aspect, an allosteric potentiator does not induce desensitization of the receptor, activity of a compound as an mGluR5 receptor allosteric potentiator provides advantages over the use of a pure mGluR5 receptor allosteric agonist. Such advantages can include, for example, increased safety margin, higher tolerability, diminished potential for abuse, and reduced toxicity. [0043] As used herein, the term “mGluR5 receptor allosteric enhancer” refers to any exogenously administered compound or agent that directly or indirectly augments the response produced by the endogenous ligand in an animal, in particular a mammal, for example a human. In one aspect, the allosteric enhancer increases the affinity of the natural ligand or agonist for the orthosteric site. In another aspect, an allosteric enhancer increases the agonist efficacy. The mGluR5 receptor allosteric enhancer binds to a site other than the orthosteric site, that is, an allosteric site, and positively augments the response of the receptor to an agonist or the endogenous ligand. An allosteric enhancer has no effect on the receptor by itself and requires the presence of an agonist or the natural ligand to realize a receptor effect. [0044] As used herein, the term “mGluR5 receptor allosteric agonist” refers to any exogenously administered compound or agent that directly activates the activity of the mGluR5 receptor in the absence of the endogenous ligand (such as glutamate) in an animal, in particular a mammal, for example a human. The mGluR5 receptor allosteric agonist binds to a site that is distinct from the orthosteric glutamate site of the mGluR5. Because it does not require the presence of the endogenous ligand, activity of a compound as an mGluR5 receptor allosteric agonist provides advantages over the use of a pure mGluR5 receptor allosteric potentiator, such as more rapid onset of action. [0045] As used herein, the term “mGluR5 receptor neutral allosteric ligand” refers to any exogenously administered compound or agent that binds to an allosteric site without affecting the binding or function of agonists or the natural ligand at the orthosteric site in an animal, in particular a mammal, for example a human. However, a neutral allosteric ligand can block the action of other allosteric modulators that act via the same site. [0046] As used herein, the term “subject” can be a vertebrate, such as a mammal, a fish, a bird, a reptile, or an amphibian. Thus, the subject of the herein disclosed methods can be a human, non-human primate, horse, pig, rabbit, dog, sheep, goat, cow, cat, guinea pig or rodent. The term does not denote a particular age or sex. Thus, adult and newborn subjects, as well as fetuses, whether male or female, are intended to be covered. In one aspect, the subject is a mammal. A patient refers to a subject afflicted with a disease or disorder. The term “patient” includes human and veterinary subjects. In some aspects of the disclosed methods, the subject has been diagnosed with a need for treatment of one or more neurological and/or psychiatric disorder associated with glutamate dysfunction prior to the administering step. In some aspects of the disclosed method, the subject has been diagnosed with a need for positive allosteric modulation of metabotropic glutamate receptor activity prior to the administering step. In some aspects of the disclosed method, the subject has been diagnosed with a need for partial agonism of metabotropic glutamate receptor activity prior to the administering step. [0047] As used herein, the term “treatment” refers to the medical management of a patient with the intent to cure, ameliorate, stabilize, or prevent a disease, pathological condition, or disorder. This term includes active treatment, that is, treatment directed specifically toward the improvement of a disease, pathological condition, or disorder, and also includes causal treatment, that is, treatment directed toward removal of the cause of the associated disease, pathological condition, or disorder. In addition, this term includes palliative treatment, that is, treatment designed for the relief of symptoms rather than the curing of the disease, pathological condition, or disorder; preventative treatment, that is, treatment directed to minimizing or partially or completely inhibiting the development of the associated disease, pathological condition, or disorder; and supportive treatment, that is, treatment employed to supplement another specific therapy directed toward the improvement of the associated disease, pathological condition, or disorder. In various aspects, the term covers any treatment of a subject, including a mammal (e.g., a human), and includes: (i) preventing the disease from occurring in a subject that can be predisposed to the disease but has not yet been diagnosed as having it; (ii) inhibiting the disease, i.e., arresting its development; or (iii) relieving the disease, i.e., causing regression of the disease. In one aspect, the subject is a mammal such as a primate, and, in a further aspect, the subject is a human. The term “subject” also includes domesticated animals (e.g., cats, dogs, etc.), livestock (e.g., cattle, horses, pigs, sheep, goats, etc.), and laboratory animals (e.g., mouse, rabbit, rat, guinea pig, fruit fly, etc.). [0048] As used herein, the term “prevent” or “preventing” refers to precluding, averting, obviating, forestalling, stopping, or hindering something from happening, especially by advance action. It is understood that where reduce, inhibit or prevent are used herein, unless specifically indicated otherwise, the use of the other two words is also expressly disclosed. [0049] As used herein, the term “diagnosed” means having been subjected to a physical examination by a person of skill, for example, a physician, and found to have a condition that can be diagnosed or treated by the compounds, compositions, or methods disclosed herein. For example, “diagnosed with a disorder treatable by modulation of mGluR5” means having been subjected to a physical examination by a person of skill, for example, a physician, and found to have a condition that can be diagnosed or treated by a compound or composition that can modulate mGluR5. As a further example, “diagnosed with a need for modulation of mGluR5” refers to having been subjected to a physical examination by a person of skill, for example, a physician, and found to have a condition characterized by mGluR5 activity. Such a diagnosis can be in reference to a disorder, such as a neurodegenerative disease, and the like, as discussed herein. For example, the term “diagnosed with a need for positive allosteric modulation of metabotropic glutamate receptor activity” refers to having been subjected to a physical examination by a person of skill, for example, a physician, and found to have a condition that can be diagnosed or treated by positive allosteric modulation of metabotropic glutamate receptor activity. For example, “diagnosed with a need for partial agonism of metabotropic glutamate receptor activity” means having been subjected to a physical examination by a person of skill, for example, a physician, and found to have a condition that can be diagnosed or treated by partial agonism of metabotropic glutamate receptor activity. For example, “diagnosed with a need for treatment of one or more neurological and/or psychiatric disorder associated with glutamate dysfunction” means having been subjected to a physical examination by a person of skill, for example, a physician, and found to have one or more neurological and/or psychiatric disorder associated with glutamate dysfunction. [0050] As used herein, the phrase “identified to be in need of treatment for a disorder,” or the like, refers to selection of a subject based upon need for treatment of the disorder. For example, a subject can be identified as having a need for treatment of a disorder (e.g., a disorder related to mGluR5 activity) based upon an earlier diagnosis by a person of skill and thereafter subjected to treatment for the disorder. It is contemplated that the identification can, in one aspect, be performed by a person different from the person making the diagnosis. It is also contemplated, in a further aspect, that the administration can be performed by one who subsequently performed the administration. [0051] As used herein, the terms “administering” and “administration” refer to any method of providing a pharmaceutical preparation to a subject. Such methods are well known to those skilled in the art and include, but are not limited to, oral administration, transdermal administration, administration by inhalation, nasal administration, topical administration, intravaginal administration, ophthalmic administration, intraaural administration, intracerebral administration, rectal administration, sublingual administration, buccal administration, and parenteral administration, including injectable such as intravenous administration, intra-arterial administration, intramuscular administration, and subcutaneous administration. Administration can be continuous or intermittent. In various aspects, a preparation can be administered therapeutically; that is, administered to treat an existing disease or condition. In further various aspects, a preparation can be administered prophylactically; that is, administered for prevention of a disease or condition. [0052] The term “contacting” as used herein refers to bringing a disclosed compound and a cell, target metabotropic glutamate receptor, or other biological entity together in such a manner that the compound can affect the activity of the target (e.g., spliceosome, cell, etc.), either directly; i.e., by interacting with the target itself, or indirectly; i.e., by interacting with another molecule, co-factor, factor, or protein on which the activity of the target is dependent. [0053] As used herein, the terms “effective amount” and “amount effective” refer to an amount that is sufficient to achieve the desired result or to have an effect on an undesired condition. For example, a “therapeutically effective amount” refers to an amount that is sufficient to achieve the desired therapeutic result or to have an effect on undesired symptoms, but is generally insufficient to cause adverse side effects. The specific therapeutically effective dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the disorder being treated and the severity of the disorder; the specific composition employed; the age, body weight, general health, sex and diet of the patient; the time of administration; the route of administration; the rate of excretion of the specific compound employed; the duration of the treatment; drugs used in combination or coincidental with the specific compound employed and like factors well known in the medical arts. For example, it is well within the skill of the art to start doses of a compound at levels lower than those required to achieve the desired therapeutic effect and to gradually increase the dosage until the desired effect is achieved. If desired, the effective daily dose can be divided into multiple doses for purposes of administration. Consequently, single dose compositions can contain such amounts or submultiples thereof to make up the daily dose. The dosage can be adjusted by the individual physician in the event of any contraindications. Dosage can vary, and can be administered in one or more dose administrations daily, for one or several days. Guidance can be found in the literature for appropriate dosages for given classes of pharmaceutical products. In further various aspects, a preparation can be administered in a “prophylactically effective amount”; that is, an amount effective for prevention of a disease or condition. [0054] As used herein, “kit” means a collection of at least two components constituting the kit. Together, the components constitute a functional unit for a given purpose. Individual member components may be physically packaged together or separately. For example, a kit comprising an instruction for using the kit may or may not physically include the instruction with other individual member components. Instead, the instruction can be supplied as a separate member component, either in a paper form or an electronic form which may be supplied on computer readable memory device or downloaded from an internet website, or as recorded presentation. [0055] As used herein, “instruction(s)” means documents describing relevant materials or methodologies pertaining to a kit. These materials may include any combination of the following: background information, list of components and their availability information (purchase information, etc.), brief or detailed protocols for using the kit, trouble-shooting, references, technical support, and any other related documents. Instructions can be supplied with the kit or as a separate member component, either as a paper form or an electronic form which may be supplied on computer readable memory device or downloaded from an internet website, or as recorded presentation. Instructions can comprise one or multiple documents, and are meant to include future updates. [0056] As used herein, the terms “therapeutic agent” include any synthetic or naturally occurring biologically active compound or composition of matter which, when administered to an organism (human or nonhuman animal), induces a desired pharmacologic, immunogenic, and/or physiologic effect by local and/or systemic action. The term therefore encompasses those compounds or chemicals traditionally regarded as drugs, vaccines, and biopharmaceuticals including molecules such as proteins, peptides, hormones, nucleic acids, gene constructs and the like. Examples of therapeutic agents are described in well-known literature references such as the Merck Index (14th edition), the Physicians' Desk Reference (64th edition), and The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics (12th edition), and they include, without limitation, medicaments; vitamins; mineral supplements; substances used for the treatment, prevention, diagnosis, cure or mitigation of a disease or illness; substances that affect the structure or function of the body, or pro-drugs, which become biologically active or more active after they have been placed in a physiological environment. For example, the term “therapeutic agent” includes compounds or compositions for use in all of the major therapeutic areas including, but not limited to, adjuvants; anti-infectives such as antibiotics and antiviral agents; analgesics and analgesic combinations, anorexics, anti-inflammatory agents, anti-epileptics, local and general anesthetics, hypnotics, sedatives, antipsychotic agents, neuroleptic agents, antidepressants, anxiolytics, antagonists, neuron blocking agents, anticholinergic and cholinomimetic agents, antimuscarinic and muscarinic agents, antiadrenergics, antiarrhythmics, antihypertensive agents, hormones, and nutrients, antiarthritics, antiasthmatic agents, anticonvulsants, antihistamines, antinauseants, antineoplastics, antipruritics, antipyretics; antispasmodics, cardiovascular preparations (including calcium channel blockers, beta-blockers, beta-agonists and antiarrythmics), antihypertensives, diuretics, vasodilators; central nervous system stimulants; cough and cold preparations; decongestants; diagnostics; hormones; bone growth stimulants and bone resorption inhibitors; immunosuppressives; muscle relaxants; psychostimulants; sedatives; tranquilizers; proteins, peptides, and fragments thereof (whether naturally occurring, chemically synthesized or recombinantly produced); and nucleic acid molecules (polymeric forms of two or more nucleotides, either ribonucleotides (RNA) or deoxyribonucleotides (DNA) including both double- and single-stranded molecules, gene constructs, expression vectors, antisense molecules and the like), small molecules (e.g., doxorubicin) and other biologically active macromolecules such as, for example, proteins and enzymes. The agent may be a biologically active agent used in medical, including veterinary, applications and in agriculture, such as with plants, as well as other areas. The term therapeutic agent also includes without limitation, medicaments; vitamins; mineral supplements; substances used for the treatment, prevention, diagnosis, cure or mitigation of disease or illness; or substances which affect the structure or function of the body; or pro- drugs, which become biologically active or more active after they have been placed in a predetermined physiological environment. [0057] As used herein, “EC50,” is intended to refer to the concentration of a substance (e.g., a compound or a drug) that is required for 50% activation or enhancement of a biological process, or component of a process. For example, EC50 can refer to the concentration of agonist that provokes a response halfway between the baseline and maximum response in an in vitro assay. For example, an EC50 for mGluR5 receptor can be determined in an in vitro or cell-based assay system. Such in vitro assay systems frequently utilize a cell line that either expresses endogenously a target of interest, or has been transfected with a suitable expression vector that directs expression of a recombinant form of the target such as mGluR5. For example, the EC50 for mGluR5 can be determined using human embryonic kidney (ΗΕΚ) cells transfected with human mGluR5. Alternatively, the EC50 for mGluR5 can be determined using human embryonic kidney (ΗΕΚ) cells transfected with rat mGluR5. In another example, the EC50 for mGluR5 can be determined using human embryonic kidney (ΗΕΚ) cells transfected with a mammalian mGluR5. [0058] As used herein, “IC50,” is intended to refer to the concentration of a substance (e.g., a compound or a drug) that is required for 50% inhibition of a biological process, or component of a process. For example, IC50 refers to the half maximal (50%) inhibitory concentration (IC) of a substance as determined in a suitable assay. For example, an IC50 for mGluR5 receptor can be determined in an in vitro or cell-based assay system. Frequently, receptor assays, including suitable assays for mGluR5, make use of a suitable cell-line, e.g. a cell line that either expresses endogenously a target of interest, or has been transfected with a suitable expression vector that directs expression of a recombinant form of the target such as mGluR5. For example, the IC50 for mGluR5 can be determined using human embryonic kidney (ΗΕΚ) cells transfected with human mGluR5. Alternatively, the IC50 for mGluR5 can be determined using human embryonic kidney (ΗΕΚ) cells transfected with rat mGluR5. In another example, the IC50 for mGluR5 can be determined using human embryonic kidney (ΗΕΚ) cells transfected with a mammalian mGluR5. [0059] The term “pharmaceutically acceptable” describes a material that is not biologically or otherwise undesirable, i.e., without causing an unacceptable level of undesirable biological effects or interacting in a deleterious manner. [0060] As used herein, the term “derivative” refers to a compound having a structure derived from the structure of a parent compound (e.g., a compound disclosed herein) and whose structure is sufficiently similar to those disclosed herein and based upon that similarity, would be expected by one skilled in the art to exhibit the same or similar activities and utilities as the claimed compounds, or to induce, as a precursor, the same or similar activities and utilities as the claimed compounds. Exemplary derivatives include salts, esters, amides, salts of esters or amides, and N-oxides of a parent compound. [0061] As used herein, the term “pharmaceutically acceptable carrier” refers to sterile aqueous or nonaqueous solutions, dispersions, suspensions or emulsions, as well as sterile powders for reconstitution into sterile injectable solutions or dispersions just prior to use. Examples of suitable aqueous and nonaqueous carriers, diluents, solvents or vehicles include water, ethanol, polyols (such as glycerol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol and the like), carboxymethylcellulose and suitable mixtures thereof, vegetable oils (such as olive oil) and injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate. Proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of coating materials such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions and by the use of surfactants. These compositions can also contain adjuvants such as preservatives, wetting agents, emulsifying agents and dispersing agents. Prevention of the action of microorganisms can be ensured by the inclusion of various antibacterial and antifungal agents such as paraben, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid and the like, ft can also be desirable to include isotonic agents such as sugars, sodium chloride and the like. Prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form can be brought about by the inclusion of agents, such as aluminum monostearate and gelatin, which delay absorption. Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsule matrices of the drug in biodegradable polymers such as polylactide-polyglycolide, poly(orthoesters) and poly(anhydrides). Depending upon the ratio of drug to polymer and the nature of the particular polymer employed, the rate of drug release can be controlled. Depot injectable formulations are also prepared by entrapping the drug in liposomes or microemulsions which are compatible with body tissues. The injectable formulations can be sterilized, for example, by fdtration through a bacterial-retaining fdter or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid compositions which can be dissolved or dispersed in sterile water or other sterile injectable media just prior to use. Suitable inert carriers can include sugars such as lactose. Desirably, at least 95% by weight of the particles of the active ingredient have an effective particle size in the range of 0.01 to 10 micrometers. [0062] A residue of a chemical species, as used in the specification and concluding claims, refers to the moiety that is the resulting product of the chemical species in a particular reaction scheme or subsequent formulation or chemical product, regardless of whether the moiety is actually obtained from the chemical species. Thus, an ethylene glycol residue in a polyester refers to one or more -0CH2CH20- units in the polyester, regardless of whether ethylene glycol was used to prepare the polyester. Similarly, a sebacic acid residue in a polyester refers to one or more -CO(CH2)8CO- moieties in the polyester, regardless of whether the residue is obtained by reacting sebacic acid or an ester thereof to obtain the polyester. [0063] As used herein, the term “substituted” is contemplated to include all permissible substituents of organic compounds. In a broad aspect, the permissible substituents include acyclic and cyclic, branched and unbranched, carbocyclic and heterocyclic, and aromatic and nonaromatic substituents of organic compounds. Illustrative substituents include, for example, those described below. The permissible substituents can be one or more and the same or different for appropriate organic compounds. For purposes of this disclosure, the heteroatoms, such as nitrogen, can have hydrogen substituents and/or any permissible substituents of organic compounds described herein which satisfy the valences of the heteroatoms. This disclosure is not intended to be limited in any manner by the permissible substituents of organic compounds. Also, the terms “substitution” or “substituted with” include the implicit proviso that such substitution is in accordance with permitted valence of the substituted atom and the substituent, and that the substitution results in a stable compound, e.g., a compound that does not spontaneously undergo transformation such as by rearrangement, cyclization, elimination, etc. It is also contemplated that, in certain aspects, unless expressly indicated to the contrary, individual substituents can be further optionally substituted (i.e., further substituted or unsubstituted). [0064] In defining various terms, “A1,” “A2,” “A3,” and “A4” are used herein as generic symbols to represent various specific substituents. These symbols can be any substituent, not limited to those disclosed herein, and when they are defined to be certain substituents in one instance, they can, in another instance, be defined as some other substituents. [0065] The term “ aliphatic” or “aliphatic group,” as used herein, denotes a hydrocarbon moiety that may be straight-chain (i.e., unbranched), branched, or cyclic (including fused, bridging, and spirofiised polycyclic) and may be completely saturated or may contain one or more units of unsaturation, but which is not aromatic. Unless otherwise specified, aliphatic groups contain 1-20 carbon atoms. Aliphatic groups include, but are not limited to, linear or branched, alkyl, alkenyl, and alkynyl groups, and hybrids thereof such as (cycloalkyl)alkyl, (cycloalkenyl)alkyl or (cycloalkyl)alkenyl. [0066] The term “alkyl” as used herein is a branched or unbranched saturated hydrocarbon group of 1 to 24 carbon atoms, such as methyl, ethyl, «-propyl, isopropyl, «butyl, isobutyl, v-butyl, /-butyl, «-pentyl, isopentyl, v-pentyl, neopentyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl, nonyl, decyl, dodecyl, tetradecyl, hexadecyl, eicosyl, tetracosyl, and the like. It is understood that the alkyl group is acyclic. The alkyl group can be branched or unbranched. The alkyl group can also be substituted or unsubstituted. For example, the alkyl group can be substituted with one or more groups including, but not limited to, alkyl, cycloalkyl, alkoxy, amino, ether, halide, hydroxy, nitro, silyl, sulfo-oxo, or thiol, as described herein. A “lower alkyl” group is an alkyl group containing from one to six (e.g., from one to four) carbon atoms. The term alkyl group can also be a Cl alkyl, C1-C2 alkyl, C1-C3 alkyl, C1-C4 alkyl, C1-C5 alkyl, C1-C6 alkyl, C1-C7 alkyl, C1-C8 alkyl, C1-C9 alkyl, C1-C10 alkyl, and the like up to and including a C1-C24 alkyl. [0067] Throughout the specification “alkyl” is generally used to refer to both unsubstituted alkyl groups and substituted alkyl groups; however, substituted alkyl groups are also specifically referred to herein by identifying the specific substituent(s) on the alkyl group. For example, the term “halogenated alkyl” or “haloalkyl” specifically refers to an alkyl group that is substituted with one or more halide, e.g., fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine. Alternatively, the term “monohaloalkyl” specifically refers to an alkyl group that is substituted with a single halide, e.g. fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine. The term “polyhaloalkyl” specifically refers to an alkyl group that is independently substituted with two or more halides, i.e. each halide substituent need not be the same halide as another halide substituent, nor do the multiple instances of a halide substituent need to be on the same carbon. The term “alkoxyalkyl” specifically refers to an alkyl group that is substituted with one or more alkoxy groups, as described below. The term “aminoalkyl” specifically refers to an alkyl group that is substituted with one or more amino groups. The term “hydroxyalkyl” specifically refers to an alkyl group that is substituted with one or more hydroxy groups. When “alkyl” is used in one instance and a specific term such as “hydroxyalkyl” is used in another, it is not meant to imply that the term “alkyl” does not also refer to specific terms such as “hydroxyalkyl” and the like. [0068] This practice is also used for other groups described herein. That is, while a term such as “cycloalkyl” refers to both unsubstituted and substituted cycloalkyl moieties, the substituted moieties can, in addition, be specifically identified herein; for example, a particular substituted cycloalkyl can be referred to as, e.g., an “alkylcycloalkyl.” Similarly, a substituted alkoxy can be specifically referred to as, e.g., a “halogenated alkoxy,” a particular substituted alkenyl can be, e.g., an “alkenylalcohol,” and the like. Again, the practice of using a general term, such as “cycloalkyl,” and a specific term, such as “alkylcycloalkyl,” is not meant to imply that the general term does not also include the specific term. [0069] The term “cycloalkyl” as used herein is a non-aromatic carbon-based ring composed of at least three carbon atoms.

A further discussion of aromaticity is found in Morrison and Boyd, Organic Chemistry, (5th Ed., 1987), Chapter 13, entitled “ Aromaticity,” pages 477-497, incorporated herein by reference. The term “aromatic group” is inclusive of both aryl and heteroaryl groups. [0077] The term “aryl” as used herein is a group that contains any carbon-based aromatic group including, but not limited to, benzene, naphthalene, phenyl, biphenyl, anthracene, and the like.

The term “biaryl” is a specific type of aryl group and is included in the definition of “aryl.” In addition, the aryl group can be a single ring structure or comprise multiple ring structures that are either fused ring structures or attached via one or more bridging groups such as a carbon-carbon bond. For example, biaryl refers to two aryl groups that are bound together via a fused ring structure, as in naphthalene, or are attached via one or more carbon-carbon bonds, as in biphenyl. [0078] The term “aldehyde” as used herein is represented by the formula -C(0)H. Throughout this specification “C(O)” is a short hand notation for a carbonyl group, ℓ℮., C=0.

The heterocycloalkyl group can be substituted with one or more groups including, but not limited to, alkyl, cycloalkyl, alkoxy, amino, ether, halide, hydroxy, nitro, silyl, sulfo-oxo, or thiol as described herein. [0094] The term “hydroxyl” or “hydroxy” as used herein is represented by the formula -OH. [0095] The term “ketone” as used herein is represented by the formula A1C(0)A2, where A1 and A2 can be, independently, an alkyl, cycloalkyl, alkenyl, cycloalkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkynyl, aryl, or heteroaryl group as described herein. [0096] The term “azide” or “azido” as used herein is represented by the formula -Ν3. [0097] The term “nitro” as used herein is represented by the formula -NO?. [0098] The term “nitrile” or “cyano” as used herein is represented by the formula -CN.

[00101] The term “thiol” as used herein is represented by the formula -SH. [00102] “R1,” “R2,” “R3,” “Rn,” where η is an integer, as used herein can, independently, possess one or more of the groups listed above. For example, if R1 is a straight chain alkyl group, one of the hydrogen atoms of the alkyl group can optionally be substituted with a hydroxyl group, an alkoxy group, an alkyl group, a halide, and the like. Depending upon the groups that are selected, a first group can be incorporated within second group or, alternatively, the first group can be pendant (i.e., attached) to the second group. For example, with the phrase “an alkyl group comprising an amino group,” the amino group can be incorporated within the backbone of the alkyl group. Alternatively, the amino group can be attached to the backbone of the alkyl group. The nature of the group(s) that is (are) selected will determine if the first group is embedded or attached to the second group. [00103] As described herein, compounds of the invention may contain “optionally substituted” moieties. In general, the term “substituted,” whether preceded by the term “optionally” or not, means that one or more hydrogens of the designated moiety are replaced with a suitable substituent. Unless otherwise indicated, an “optionally substituted” group may have a suitable substituent at each substitutable position of the group, and when more than one position in any given structure may be substituted with more than one substituent selected from a specified group, the substituent may be either the same or different at every position. Combinations of substituents envisioned by this invention are preferably those that result in the formation of stable or chemically feasible compounds. In is also contemplated that, in certain aspects, unless expressly indicated to the contrary, individual substituents can be further optionally substituted (i.e., further substituted or unsubstituted). [00104] The term “stable,” as used herein, refers to compounds that are not substantially altered when subjected to conditions to allow for their production, detection, and, in certain aspects, their recovery, purification, and use for one or more of the purposes disclosed herein. [00105] Suitable monovalent substituents on a substitutable carbon atom of an “optionally substituted” group are independently halogen; -(CH2)o^R°; -(CH2)o-40R°; -O(CH2)0-4R°, 0-(CH2)o^C(0)OR°; -(CH2)o^CH(OR°)2; -(CH2)o 4SR°; ACH2)0 4Ph, which may be substituted with R°; -(CH2)o^O(CH2)0-iPh which may be substituted with R°; -CH=CHPh, which may be substituted with R°; -(CH2)o-40(CH2)o-i-pyridyl which may be substituted with R°; -N02; -CN; -N3; -(CH2)o 4N(R°)2; -(CH2)0^N(Ro)C(O)R°; -N(R°)C(S)R°; (CH2)o_4N(R°)C(0)NR02; -N(R°)C(S)NR°2; -(CH2)0-4N(Ro)C(O)OR°; N(R°)N(R°)C(0)R°; -N(R°)N(R°)C(0)NR°2; -N(R°)N(R°)C(0)OR°; -(CH2)0 4C(0)R°; C(S)R°; -(CH2)o_4C(0)OR°; -(CH2)0^C(O)SRo; -(CH2),MC(0)0SiR03; -(CH2)0^OC(O)R°; -OC(0)(CH2)cmSR-, -SC(S)SR°; -(CH2)0^SC(O)Ro; -(CH2)0 4aO)NR°2; -C(S)NR°2; C(S)SR°; -(CH2)o-40C(0)NR°2; -C(0)N(OR°)R°; -C(0)C(0)R°; -C(0)CH2C(0)R°; C(NOR°)R°; TCH2)o 4SSR°; ACH2)0 4S(0)2R°; -(CH2)0 4S(0)20R°; -(CH2)0 40S(0)2R°; S(0)2NR°2; TCH2)o 4S(O)R°; -N(R°)S(0)2NR°2; -N(R°)S(0)2R°; -N(OR°)R°; C(NH)NR°2; -P(0)2R°; -P(0)R°2; -0P(0)R°2; -0P(0)(0R°)2; SiR°3; -(C, 4 straight or branched alkylene)0-N(R°)2; or -/Ci 4 straight or branched alkylene)C(0)0-N(R°)2, wherein each R° may be substituted as defined below and is independently hydrogen, C| ℮ aliphatic, -CH2Ph, -O/CH2)0 iPh, -CH2-(5-6 membered heteroaryl ring), or a 5-6-membered saturated, partially unsaturated, or aryl ring having 0-4 heteroatoms independently selected from nitrogen, oxygen, or sulfur, or, notwithstanding the definition above, two independent occurrences of R°, taken together with their intervening atom(s), form a 3-12-membered saturated, partially unsaturated, or aryl mono- or bicyclic ring having 0-4 heteroatoms independently selected from nitrogen, oxygen, or sulfur, which may be substituted as defined below.

[00111] The term “leaving group” refers to an atom (or a group of atoms) with electron withdrawing ability that can be displaced as a stable species, taking with it the bonding electrons. Examples of suitable leaving groups include halides and sulfonate esters, including, but not limited to, triflate, mesylate, tosylate, and brosylate. [00112] The terms “hydrolysable group” and “hydrolysable moiety” refer to a functional group capable of undergoing hydrolysis, e.g., under basic or acidic conditions. Examples of hydrolysable residues include, without limitation, acid halides, activated carboxylic acids, and various protecting groups known in the art (see, for example, “Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis,” T. W. Greene, P. G. Μ. Wuts, Wiley-Interscience, 1999). [00113] The term “organic residue” defines a carbon containing residue, i.e., a residue comprising at least one carbon atom, and includes but is not limited to the carbon-containing groups, residues, or radicals defined hereinabove. Organic residues can contain various heteroatoms, or be bonded to another molecule through a heteroatom, including oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, phosphorus, or the like. Examples of organic residues include but are not limited alkyl or substituted alkyls, alkoxy or substituted alkoxy, mono or di-substituted amino, amide groups, etc. Organic residues can preferably comprise 1 to 18 carbon atoms, 1 to 15, carbon atoms, 1 to 12 carbon atoms, 1 to 8 carbon atoms, 1 to 6 carbon atoms, or 1 to 4 carbon atoms. In a further aspect, an organic residue can comprise 2 to 18 carbon atoms, 2 to 15, carbon atoms, 2 to 12 carbon atoms, 2 to 8 carbon atoms, 2 to 4 carbon atoms, or 2 to 4 carbon atoms. [00114] A very close synonym of the term “residue” is the term “radical,” which as used in the specification and concluding claims, refers to a fragment, group, or substructure of a molecule described herein, regardless of how the molecule is prepared. For example, a 2,4-thiazolidinedione radical in a particular compound has the structure: regardless of whether thiazolidinedione is used to prepare the compound. In some embodiments the radical (for example an alkyl) can be further modified (i.e., substituted alkyl) by having bonded thereto one or more “substituent radicals.” The number of atoms in a given radical is not critical to the present invention unless it is indicated to the contrary elsewhere herein. [00115] “Organic radicals,” as the term is defined and used herein, contain one or more carbon atoms. An organic radical can have, for example, 1-26 carbon atoms, 1-18 carbon atoms, 1-12 carbon atoms, 1-8 carbon atoms, 1-6 carbon atoms, or 1-4 carbon atoms. In a further aspect, an organic radical can have 2-26 carbon atoms, 2-18 carbon atoms, 2-12 carbon atoms, 2-8 carbon atoms, 2-6 carbon atoms, or 2-4 carbon atoms. Organic radicals often have hydrogen bound to at least some of the carbon atoms of the organic radical. One example, of an organic radical that comprises no inorganic atoms is a 5, 6, 7, 8-tetrahydro-2-naphthyl radical. In some embodiments, an organic radical can contain 1-10 inorganic heteroatoms bound thereto or therein, including halogens, oxygen, sulfur, nitrogen, phosphorus, and the like. Examples of organic radicals include but are not limited to an alkyl, substituted alkyl, cycloalkyl, substituted cycloalkyl, mono-substituted amino, disubstituted amino, acyloxy, cyano, carboxy, carboalkoxy, alkylcarboxamide, substituted alkylcarboxamide, dialkylcarboxamide, substituted dialkylcarboxamide, alkylsulfonyl, alkylsulfmyl, thioalkyl, thiohaloalkyl, alkoxy, substituted alkoxy, haloalkyl, haloalkoxy, aryl, substituted aryl, heteroaryl, heterocyclic, or substituted heterocyclic radicals, wherein the terms are defined elsewhere herein. A few non-limiting examples of organic radicals that include heteroatoms include alkoxy radicals, trifluoromethoxy radicals, acetoxy radicals, dimethylamino radicals and the like. [00116] “Inorganic radicals,” as the term is defined and used herein, contain no carbon atoms and therefore comprise only atoms other than carbon. Inorganic radicals comprise bonded combinations of atoms selected from hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, silicon, phosphorus, sulfur, selenium, and halogens such as fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine, which can be present individually or bonded together in their chemically stable combinations. Inorganic radicals have 10 or fewer, or preferably one to six or one to four inorganic atoms as listed above bonded together. Examples of inorganic radicals include, but not limited to, amino, hydroxy, halogens, nitro, thiol, sulfate, phosphate, and like commonly known inorganic radicals. The inorganic radicals do not have bonded therein the metallic elements of the periodic table (such as the alkali metals, alkaline earth metals, transition metals, lanthanide metals, or actinide metals), although such metal ions can sometimes serve as a pharmaceutically acceptable cation for anionic inorganic radicals such as a sulfate, phosphate, or like anionic inorganic radical. Inorganic radicals do not comprise metalloids elements such as boron, aluminum, gallium, germanium, arsenic, tin, lead, or tellurium, or the noble gas elements, unless otherwise specifically indicated elsewhere herein. [00117] Compounds described herein can contain one or more double bonds and, thus, potentially give rise to cis/trans (Ε/Ζ) isomers, as well as other conformational isomers. Unless stated to the contrary, the invention includes all such possible isomers, as well as mixtures of such isomers. [00118] Unless stated to the contrary, a formula with chemical bonds shown only as solid lines and not as wedges or dashed lines contemplates each possible isomer, e.g., each enantiomer and diastereomer, and a mixture of isomers, such as a racemic or scalemic mixture. Compounds described herein can contain one or more asymmetric centers and, thus, potentially give rise to diastereomers and optical isomers. Unless stated to the contrary, the present invention includes all such possible diastereomers as well as their racemic mixtures, their substantially pure resolved enantiomers, all possible geometric isomers, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. Mixtures of stereoisomers, as well as isolated specific stereoisomers, are also included. During the course of the synthetic procedures used to prepare such compounds, or in using racemization or epimerization procedures known to those skilled in the art, the products of such procedures can be a mixture of stereoisomers. [00119] Many organic compounds exist in optically active forms having the ability to rotate the plane of plane-polarized light. In describing an optically active compound, the prefixes D and L or R and S are used to denote the absolute configuration of the molecule about its chiral center(s). The prefixes d and 1 or (+) and (-) are employed to designate the sign of rotation of plane-polarized light by the compound. For example, a compound prefixed with (-) or 1 meaning that the compound is levorotatory or a compound prefixed with (+) or d is dextrorotatory. For a given chemical structure, these compounds, called stereoisomers, are identical except that they are non-superimposable mirror images of one another. A specific stereoisomer can also be referred to as an enantiomer, and a mixture of such isomers is often called an enantiomeric mixture. A 50:50 mixture of enantiomers is referred to as a racemic mixture. Many of the compounds described herein can have one or more chiral centers and therefore can exist in different enantiomeric forms. If desired, a chiral carbon can be designated with an asterisk (*). When bonds to the chiral carbon are depicted as straight lines in the disclosed formulas, it is understood that both the (R) and (S) configurations of the chiral carbon, and hence both enantiomers and mixtures thereof, are embraced within the formula. As is used in the art, when it is desired to specify the absolute configuration about a chiral carbon, one of the bonds to the chiral carbon can be depicted as a wedge (bonds to atoms above the plane) and the other can be depicted as a series or wedge of short parallel lines is (bonds to atoms below the plane). The Cahn-Inglod-Prelog system can be used to assign the (R) or (S) configuration to a chiral carbon. [00120] Compounds described herein comprise atoms in both their natural isotopic abundance and in non-natural abundance. The disclosed compounds can be isotopically-labelled or isotopically-substituted compounds identical to those described, but for the fact that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number typically found in nature. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorous, fluorine and chlorine, such as 2 Η,3 Η, 13 C, 14 C, 15 Ν, 18 0,17 0,35 S, 18 F and 36 Cl, respectively. Compounds further comprise prodrugs thereof, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts of said compounds or of said prodrugs which contain the aforementioned isotopes and/or other isotopes of other atoms are within the scope of this invention. Certain isotopically-labelled compounds of the present invention, for example those into which radioactive isotopes such as 3 Η and 14 C are incorporated, are useful in drug and/or substrate tissue distribution assays. Tritiated, i.e.,3 Η, and carbon-14, i.e., 14 C, isotopes are particularly preferred for their ease of preparation and detectability. Further, substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium, i.e., 2H, can afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements and, hence, may be preferred in some circumstances. Isotopically labelled compounds of the present invention and prodrugs thereof can generally be prepared by carrying out the procedures below, by substituting a readily available isotopically labelled reagent for a non- isotopically labelled reagent. [00121] The compounds described in the invention can be present as a solvate. In some cases, the solvent used to prepare the solvate is an aqueous solution, and the solvate is then often referred to as a hydrate. The compounds can be present as a hydrate, which can be obtained, for example, by crystallization from a solvent or from aqueous solution. In this connection, one, two, three or any arbitrary number of solvent or water molecules can combine with the compounds according to the invention to form solvates and hydrates. Unless stated to the contrary, the invention includes all such possible solvates. [00122] The term “co-crystal” means a physical association of two or more molecules which owe their stability through non-covalent interaction. One or more components of this molecular complex provide a stable framework in the crystalline lattice. In certain instances, the guest molecules are incorporated in the crystalline lattice as anhydrates or solvates, see e.g. “Crystal Engineering of the Composition of Pharmaceutical Phases. Do Pharmaceutical Co-crystals Represent a New Path to Improved Medicines?” Almarasson, O., et. al, The Royal Society of Chemistry, 1889-1896, 2004. Examples of co-crystals include ρtoluenesulfonic acid and benzenesulfonic acid. [00123] It is also appreciated that certain compounds described herein can be present as an equilibrium of tautomers. For example, ketones with an a-hydrogen can exist in an equilibrium of the keto form and the enol form. 9 s OH Η X amide form imidic acid form Likewise, amides with an N-hydrogen can exist in an equilibrium of the amide form and the imidic acid form. As another example, pyridinones can exist in two tautomeric forms, as shown below. Unless stated to the contrary, the invention includes all such possible tautomers. [00124] It is known that chemical substances form solids which are present in different states of order which are termed polymorphic forms or modifications. The different modifications of a polymorphic substance can differ greatly in their physical properties. The compounds according to the invention can be present in different polymorphic forms, with it being possible for particular modifications to be metastable. Unless stated to the contrary, the invention includes all such possible polymorphic forms. [00125] In some aspects, a structure of a radical can be represented by a formula: ■Rn which is understood to be equivalent to a formula: wherein η is typically an integer. That is, R" is understood to represent five independent substituents, R"(a), R"(b), R"(c), R"(d), R"(e). By “independent substituents,” it is meant that each R substituent can be independently defined. For example, if in one instance R"fal is halogen, then R"ni) is not necessarily halogen in that instance. [00126] Certain materials, compounds, compositions, and components disclosed herein can be obtained commercially or readily synthesized using techniques generally known to those of skill in the art. For example, the starting materials and reagents used in preparing the disclosed compounds and compositions are either available from commercial suppliers such as Aldrich Chemical Co., (Milwaukee, Wis.), Acros Organics (Morris Plains, N.J.), Fisher Scientific (Pittsburgh, Pa.), or Sigma (St. Louis, Mo.) or are prepared by methods known to those skilled in the art following procedures set forth in references such as Fieser and Fieser’s Reagents for Organic Synthesis, Volumes 1-17 (John Wiley and Sons, 1991); Rodd’s Chemistry of Carbon Compounds, Volumes 1-5 and Supplemental volumes (Elsevier Science Publishers, 1989); Organic Reactions, Volumes 1-40 (John Wiley and Sons, 1991); March’s Advanced Organic Chemistry, (John Wiley and Sons, 4th Edition); and Larock’s Comprehensive Organic Transformations (VCH Publishers Inc., 1989). [00127] The following abbreviations are used herein: “ACN” means acetonitrile; “AcOEt” means ethyl acetate; “DCM” means dichloromethane; “DIPE” means diisopropyl ether; “DMF” means /V, /V- dimcthylformamidc; “LCMS” means liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry; “MeOH” means methanol; “[M+H]+” means the protonated mass of the free base of the compound; “M. p.” means melting point; “NMR” means nuclear magnetic resonance; “Rt” means retention time (in minutes); and “THF” means tetrahydrofuran. [00128] Unless otherwise expressly stated, it is in no way intended that any method set forth herein be construed as requiring that its steps be performed in a specific order. Accordingly, where a method claim does not actually recite an order to be followed by its steps or it is not otherwise specifically stated in the claims or descriptions that the steps are to be limited to a specific order, it is no way intended that an order be inferred, in any respect. This holds for any possible non-express basis for interpretation, including: matters of logic with respect to arrangement of steps or operational flow; plain meaning derived from grammatical organization or punctuation; and the number or type of embodiments described in the specification. [00129] Disclosed are the components to be used to prepare the compositions of the invention as well as the compositions themselves to be used within the methods disclosed herein. These and other materials are disclosed herein, and it is understood that when combinations, subsets, interactions, groups, etc. of these materials are disclosed that while specific reference of each various individual and collective combinations and permutation of these compounds cannot be explicitly disclosed, each is specifically contemplated and described herein. For example, if a particular compound is disclosed and discussed and a number of modifications that can be made to a number of molecules including the compounds are discussed, specifically contemplated is each and every combination and permutation of the compound and the modifications that are possible unless specifically indicated to the contrary. Thus, if a class of molecules A, Β, and C are disclosed as well as a class of molecules D, Ε, and F and an example of a combination molecule, A-D is disclosed, then even if each is not individually recited each is individually and collectively contemplated meaning combinations, Α-Ε, A-F, B-D, Β-Ε, B-F, C-D, C-E, and C-F are considered disclosed. Fikewise, any subset or combination of these is also disclosed. Thus, for example, the sub-group of Α-Ε, B-F, and C-E would be considered disclosed. This concept applies to all aspects of this application including, but not limited to, steps in methods of making and using the compositions of the invention. Thus, if there are a variety of additional steps that can be performed it is understood that each of these additional steps can be performed with any specific embodiment or combination of embodiments of the methods of the invention.

Metabotropic glutamate receptor activity [00387] The utility of the disclosed compounds and products of disclosed methods of making, in accordance with the present invention as potentiators of metabotropic glutamate receptor activity, in particular mGluR5 activity, can be demonstrated by methodology known in the art. Human embryonic kidney (ΗΕΚ) cells transfected with rat mGluR5 were plated in clear bottom assay plates for assay in a Functional Drug Screening System (FDSS). In the alternative assay, ΗΕΚ cells transfected with human mGluR5 were plated for assay in the FDSS. In some cases the ΗΕΚ cells transfected with human mGluR5 are the Η10Η cell line. Alternatively, the ΗΕΚ cells transfected with human mGluR5 are the Η12Η cell line. Rat assay results were found to correlate well with human assay results. The cells were loaded with a Ca2+-sensitive fluorescent dye (e.g., Fluo-4), and the plates were washed and placed in the FDSS instrument. After establishment of a fluorescence baseline for about three seconds, the compounds of the present invention were added to the cells, and the response in cells was measured. Five minutes later, an mGluR5 agonist (e.g., glutamate, 3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine, or quisqualate) was added to the cells, and the response of the cells was measured. Potentiation of the agonist response of mGluR5 by the compounds in the present invention was observed as an increase in response to non-maximal concentrations of agonist (here, glutamate) in the presence of compound compared to the response to agonist in the absence of compound. [00388] The above described assay can be operated in two modes. In the first mode, a range of concentrations of the present compounds were added to cells, followed by a single fixed concentration of agonist. If a compound acted as a potentiator, an EC50 value for potentiation and a maximum extent of potentiation by the compound at this concentration of agonist was determined by non-linear curve fitting. In the second mode, several fixed concentrations of the present compounds were added to various wells on a plate, followed by a range of concentrations of agonist for each concentration of present compound; the EC50 values for the agonist at each concentration of compound were determined by non-linear curve fitting. A decrease in the EC50 value of the agonist with increasing concentrations of the present compounds (a leftward shift of the agonist concentration-response curve) is an indication of the degree of mGluR5 potentiation at a given concentration of the present compound. An increase in the EC50 value of the agonist with increasing concentrations of the present compounds (a rightward shift of the agonist concentration-response curve) is an indication of the degree of mGluR5 antagonism at a given concentration of the present compound. The second mode also indicates whether the present compounds also affect the maximum response to mGluR5 to agonists. [00389] In one aspect, the disclosed compounds and products of disclosed methods of making exhibit potentiation of mGluR5 response to glutamate as an increase in response to non-maximal concentrations of glutamate in human embryonic kidney cells transfected with a mammalian mGluR5 in the presence of the compound, compared to the response to glutamate in the absence of the compound. In a further aspect, the human embryonic kidney cells can be transfected with a mammalian GluR5. In a still further aspect, human embryonic kidney cells can be transfected with human mGluR5. In a yet further aspect, human embryonic kidney cells can be transfected with rat mGluR5. It is to be understood that “transfected with a mGluR5” (e.g. human mGluR5) refers to transfection of the indicated cells with an appropriate expression construct comprising the nucleic acid sequence coding for the indicated mGluR5. The nucleic acid sequence for an mGluR5 can be a cDNA sequence which is full-length or alternatively a partial cDNA sequence a subset of the full-length cDNA sequence. Appropriate expression constructs are available to one skilled in the art, as are methods for manipulation of the desired cDNA sequence. [00390] In a further aspect, the disclosed compounds and products of disclosed methods of making are allosteric modulators of mGluR5, in particular, positive allosteric modulators of mGluR5. The disclosed compounds can potentiate glutamate responses by binding to an allosteric site other than the glutamate orthosteric binding site. The response of mGluR5 to a concentration of glutamate is increased when the disclosed compounds are present. In a further aspect, the disclosed compounds can have their effect substantially at mGluR5 by virtue of their ability to enhance the function of the receptor. [00391] In particular, the disclosed compounds and products of disclosed methods of making exhibit activity in potentiating the mGluR5 receptor in the aforementioned assays, generally with an EC50 for potentiation of less than about 10 μΜ. Preferred compounds within the present invention had activity in potentiating the mGluR5 receptor with an EC50 for potentiation of less than about 500 ηΜ. Preferred compounds further caused a leftward shift of the agonist EC50 by greater than 3-fold. These compounds did not cause mGluR5 to respond in the absence of agonist, and they did not elicit a significant increase in the maximal response of mGluR5 to agonists. These compounds are selective positive allosteric modulators (potentiators) of human and rat mGluR5 compared to the other seven subtypes of metabotropic glutamate receptors. [00392] In a further aspect, the disclosed compounds and products of disclosed methods of making can exhibit positive allosteric modulation of mGluR5 in the cell-based assay methods described herein, i.e. the disclosed compounds and disclosed products of making can exhibit positive allosteric modulation of mGluR5 response to glutamate as an increase in response to non-maximal concentrations of glutamate in human embryonic kidney cells transfected with a mGluR5 (e.g. a mammalian, a rat, or a human mGluR5) in the presence of the compound, compared to the response to glutamate in the absence of the compound. For example, the disclosed compounds and products of disclosed methods of making can exhibit positive allosteric modulation of mGluR5 in a aforementioned cell-based assay with an EC50 of less than about 10,000 ηΜ, of less than about 5,000 ηΜ, of less than about 1,000 ηΜ, of less than about 500 ηΜ, or of less than about 100 ηΜ. In a further aspect, the disclosed compounds and products of disclosed methods of making can exhibit positive allosteric modulation of human mGluR5 in the Η10Η cell-line with an EC50 of less than about 10,000 ηΜ, of less than about 5,000 ηΜ. of less than about 1,000 ηΜ, of less than about 500 ηΜ, or of less than about 100 ηΜ. [00393] In vivo efficacy for disclosed compounds and products of disclosed methods of making can be measured in a number of preclinical rat behavioral model where known, clinically useful antipsychotics display similar positive responses. For example, disclosed compounds can reverse amphetamine-induced hyperlocomotion in male Sprague-Dawley rats at doses ranging from 1 to 100 mg/kg ρ.ο. D. Methods of making the compounds [00394] In one aspect, the invention relates to methods of making compounds useful as positive allosteric modulators of the metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 5 (mGluR5), which can be useful in the treatment of neurological and psychiatric disorders associated with glutamate dysfunction and other diseases in which metabotropic glutamate receptors are involved.

In particular, the compounds can be prepared according to the following synthesis methods. It is also contemplated that pseudohalogens (e.g. triflate, mesylate, brosylate, etc.) can be used as leaving groups in place of halogens in certain aspects. [00399] The disclosed compounds may be synthesized in the form of racemic mixtures of enantiomers which can be separated from one another following art-known resolution procedures. The racemic compounds of disclosed compounds may be converted into the corresponding diastereomeric salt forms by reaction with a suitable chiral acid. Said diastereomeric salt forms are subsequently separated, for example, by selective or fractional crystallization and the enantiomers are liberated therefrom by alkali. An alternative manner of separating the enantiomeric forms of the compounds of disclosed compounds involves liquid chromatography using a chiral stationary phase. Said pure stereochemically isomeric forms may also be derived from the corresponding pure stereochemically isomeric forms of the appropriate starting materials, provided that the reaction occurs stereospecifically. 1.

It is also understood that the products of the disclosed methods can be employed in the disclosed methods of using. Ε. Pharmaceutical compositions [00420] In one aspect, the invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising the disclosed compounds. That is, a pharmaceutical composition can be provided comprising a therapeutically effective amount of at least one disclosed compound or at least one product of a disclosed method and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. [00421] In certain aspects, the disclosed pharmaceutical compositions comprise the disclosed compounds (including pharmaceutically acceptable salt(s) thereof) as an active ingredient, a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, and, optionally, other therapeutic ingredients or adjuvants. The instant compositions include those suitable for oral, rectal, topical, and parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, and intravenous) administration, although the most suitable route in any given case will depend on the particular host, and nature and severity of the conditions for which the active ingredient is being administered. The pharmaceutical compositions can be conveniently presented in unit dosage form and prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. [00422] In various aspects, the invention also relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent and, as active ingredient, a therapeutically effective amount of a disclosed compound, a product of a disclosed method of making, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, a hydrate thereof, a solvate thereof, a polymorph thereof, or a stereochemically isomeric form thereof. In a further aspect, a disclosed compound, a product of a disclosed method of making, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, a hydrate thereof, a solvate thereof, a polymorph thereof, or a stereochemically isomeric form thereof, or any subgroup or combination thereof may be formulated into various pharmaceutical forms for administration purposes. [00423] As used herein, the term “pharmaceutically acceptable salts” refers to salts prepared from pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic bases or acids. When the compound of the present invention is acidic, its corresponding salt can be conveniently prepared from pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic bases, including inorganic bases and organic bases. Salts derived from such inorganic bases include aluminum, ammonium, calcium, copper (-ic and -ous), ferric, ferrous, lithium, magnesium, manganese (-ic and -ous), potassium, sodium, zinc and the like salts. Particularly preferred are the ammonium, calcium, magnesium, potassium and sodium salts. Salts derived from pharmaceutically acceptable organic non-toxic bases include salts of primary, secondary, and tertiary amines, as well as cyclic amines and substituted amines such as naturally occurring and synthesized substituted amines. Other pharmaceutically acceptable organic non-toxic bases from which salts can be formed include ion exchange resins such as, for example, arginine, betaine, caffeine, choline, Ν,Ν dibenzylethylenediamine, diethylamine, 2-diethylaminoethanol, 2-dimethylaminoethanol, ethanolamine, ethylenediamine, N-ethylmorpholine, N-ethylpiperidine, glucamine, glucosamine, histidine, hydrabamine, isopropylamine, lysine, methylglucamine, morpholine, piperazine, piperidine, polyamine resins, procaine, purines, theobromine, triethylamine, trimethylamine, tripropylamine, tromethamine and the like. [00424] As used herein, the term “pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic acids”, includes inorganic acids, organic acids, and salts prepared therefrom, for example, acetic, benzenesulfonic, benzoic, camphorsulfonic, citric, ethanesulfonic, fumaric, gluconic, glutamic, hydrobromic, hydrochloric, isethionic, lactic, maleic, malic, mandelic, methanesulfonic, mucic, nitric, pamoic, pantothenic, phosphoric, succinic, sulfuric, tartaric, p-toluenesulfonic acid and the like. Preferred are citric, hydrobromic, hydrochloric, maleic, phosphoric, sulfuric, and tartaric acids. [00425] For therapeutic use, salts of the disclosed compounds are those wherein the counter ion is pharmaceutically acceptable. However, salts of acids and bases which are ηοηpharmaceutically acceptable may also find use, for example, in the preparation or purification of a pharmaceutically acceptable compound. All salts, whether pharmaceutically acceptable or not, are included within the ambit of the present invention. [00426] The pharmaceutically acceptable acid and base addition salts as mentioned hereinabove or hereinafter are meant to comprise the therapeutically active non-toxic acid and base addition salt forms which the disclosed compounds are able to form. The pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts can conveniently be obtained by treating the base form with such appropriate acid. Appropriate acids comprise, for example, inorganic acids such as hydrohalic acids, e.g. hydrochloric or hydrobromic acid, sulfuric, nitric, phosphoric and the like acids; or organic acids such as, for example, acetic, propanoic, hydroxyacetic, lactic, pyruvic, oxalic (i.e. ethanedioic), malonic, succinic (i.e. butanedioic acid), maleic, fumaric, malic, tartaric, citric, methanesulfonic, ethanesulfonic, benzenesulfonic, p-toluenesulfonic, cyclamic, salicylic, p-aminosalicylic, pamoic and the like acids. Conversely said salt forms can be converted by treatment with an appropriate base into the free base form. [00427] The disclosed compounds containing an acidic proton may also be converted into their non-toxic metal or amine addition salt forms by treatment with appropriate organic and inorganic bases. Appropriate base salt forms comprise, for example, the ammonium salts, the alkali and earth alkaline metal salts, e.g. the lithium, sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium salts and the like, salts with organic bases, e.g. primary, secondary and tertiary aliphatic and aromatic amines such as methylamine, ethylamine, propylamine, isopropylamine, the four butylamine isomers, dimethylamine, diethylamine, diethanolamine, dipropylamine, diisopropylamine, di-w-butylamine, pyrrolidine, piperidine, morpholine, trimethylamine, triethylamine, tripropylamine, quinuclidine, pyridine, quinoline and isoquinoline; the benzathine, /Υ-m c t h y 1 - D - glucami η c, hydrabamine salts, and salts with amino acids such as, for example, arginine, lysine and the like. Conversely the salt form can be converted by treatment with acid into the free acid form. [00428] In practice, the compounds of the invention, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, of this invention can be combined as the active ingredient in intimate admixture with a pharmaceutical carrier according to conventional pharmaceutical compounding techniques. The carrier can take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration, e.g., oral or parenteral (including intravenous). Thus, the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention can be presented as discrete units suitable for oral administration such as capsules, cachets or tablets each containing a predetermined amount of the active ingredient. Further, the compositions can be presented as a powder, as granules, as a solution, as a suspension in an aqueous liquid, as a non-aqueous liquid, as an oil-in-water emulsion or as a water-in-oil liquid emulsion. In addition to the common dosage forms set out above, the compounds of the invention, and/or pharmaceutically acceptable salt(s) thereof, can also be administered by controlled release means and/or delivery devices. The compositions can be prepared by any of the methods of pharmacy. In general, such methods include a step of bringing into association the active ingredient with the carrier that constitutes one or more necessary ingredients. In general, the compositions are prepared by uniformly and intimately admixing the active ingredient with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both. The product can then be conveniently shaped into the desired presentation. [00429] It is especially advantageous to formulate the aforementioned pharmaceutical compositions in unit dosage form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Unit dosage form as used herein refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active ingredient calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. Examples of such unit dosage forms are tablets (including scored or coated tablets), capsules, pills, powder packets, wafers, suppositories, injectable solutions or suspensions and the like, and segregated multiples thereof. [00430] Thus, the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention can include a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and a compound or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the compounds of the invention. The compounds of the invention, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, can also be included in pharmaceutical compositions in combination with one or more other therapeutically active compounds. [00431] The pharmaceutical carrier employed can be, for example, a solid, liquid, or gas. Examples of solid carriers include lactose, terra alba, sucrose, talc, gelatin, agar, pectin, acacia, magnesium stearate, and stearic acid. Examples of liquid carriers are sugar syrup, peanut oil, olive oil, and water. Examples of gaseous carriers include carbon dioxide and nitrogen. [00432] In order to enhance the solubility and/or the stability of the compounds of Formula (I) in pharmaceutical compositions, it can be advantageous to employ α-, β- or γcyclodextrins or their derivatives, in particular hydroxyalkyl substituted cyclodextrins, e.g. 2-hydroxypropyl-p-cyclodextrin or sulfobutyl-p-cyclodextrin. Also co-solvents such as alcohols may improve the solubility and/or the stability of the compounds according to the invention in pharmaceutical compositions. [00433] Because of the ease in administration, oral administration is preferred, and tablets and capsules represent the most advantageous oral dosage unit forms in which case solid pharmaceutical carriers are obviously employed. In preparing the compositions for oral dosage form, any convenient pharmaceutical media can be employed. For example, water, glycols, oils, alcohols, flavoring agents, preservatives, coloring agents and the like can be used to form oral liquid preparations such as suspensions, elixirs and solutions; while carriers such as starches, sugars, microcrystalline cellulose, diluents, granulating agents, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents, and the like can be used to form oral solid preparations such as powders, capsules and tablets. Because of their ease of administration, tablets and capsules are the preferred oral dosage units whereby solid pharmaceutical carriers are employed. Optionally, tablets can be coated by standard aqueous or nonaqueous techniques [00434] A tablet containing the composition of this invention can be prepared by compression or molding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients or adjuvants. Compressed tablets can be prepared by compressing, in a suitable machine, the active ingredient in a free-flowing form such as powder or granules, optionally mixed with a binder, lubricant, inert diluent, surface active or dispersing agent. Molded tablets can be made by molding in a suitable machine, a mixture of the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent. [00435] The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention comprise a compound of the invention (or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof) as an active ingredient, a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, and optionally one or more additional therapeutic agents or adjuvants. The instant compositions include compositions suitable for oral, rectal, topical, and parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, and intravenous) administration, although the most suitable route in any given case will depend on the particular host, and nature and severity of the conditions for which the active ingredient is being administered. The pharmaceutical compositions can be conveniently presented in unit dosage form and prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. [00436] Pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention suitable for parenteral administration can be prepared as solutions or suspensions of the active compounds in water. A suitable surfactant can be included such as, for example, hydroxypropylcellulose. Dispersions can also be prepared in glycerol, liquid polyethylene glycols, and mixtures thereof in oils. Further, a preservative can be included to prevent the detrimental growth of microorganisms. [00437] Pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions. Furthermore, the compositions can be in the form of sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of such sterile injectable solutions or dispersions. In all cases, the final injectable form must be sterile and must be effectively fluid for easy syringability. The pharmaceutical compositions must be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage; thus, preferably should be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (e.g., glycerol, propylene glycol and liquid polyethylene glycol), vegetable oils, and suitable mixtures thereof. [00438] Injectable solutions, for example, may be prepared in which the carrier comprises saline solution, glucose solution or a mixture of saline and glucose solution. Injectable suspensions may also be prepared in which case appropriate liquid carriers, suspending agents and the like may be employed. Also included are solid form preparations that are intended to be converted, shortly before use, to liquid form preparations. [00439] Pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention can be in a form suitable for topical use such as, for example, an aerosol, cream, ointment, lotion, dusting powder, mouth washes, gargles, and the like. Further, the compositions can be in a form suitable for use in transdermal devices. These formulations can be prepared, utilizing a compound of the invention, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, via conventional processing methods. As an example, a cream or ointment is prepared by mixing hydrophilic material and water, together with about 5 wt% to about 10 wt% of the compound, to produce a cream or ointment having a desired consistency. [00440] In the compositions suitable for percutaneous administration, the carrier optionally comprises a penetration enhancing agent and/or a suitable wetting agent, optionally combined with suitable additives of any nature in minor proportions, which additives do not introduce a significant deleterious effect on the skin. Said additives may facilitate the administration to the skin and/or may be helpful for preparing the desired compositions. These compositions may be administered in various ways, e.g., as a transdermal patch, as a spot-on, as an ointment. [00441] Pharmaceutical compositions of this invention can be in a form suitable for rectal administration wherein the carrier is a solid. It is preferable that the mixture forms unit dose suppositories. Suitable carriers include cocoa butter and other materials commonly used in the art. The suppositories can be conveniently formed by first admixing the composition with the softened or melted carrier(s) followed by chilling and shaping in moulds. [00442] In addition to the aforementioned carrier ingredients, the pharmaceutical formulations described above can include, as appropriate, one or more additional carrier ingredients such as diluents, buffers, flavoring agents, binders, surface-active agents, thickeners, lubricants, preservatives (including anti-oxidants) and the like. Furthermore, other adjuvants can be included to render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient. Compositions containing a compound of the invention, and/or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, can also be prepared in powder or liquid concentrate form. [00443] The exact dosage and frequency of administration depends on the particular disclosed compound, a product of a disclosed method of making, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, a hydrate thereof, a solvate thereof, a polymorph thereof, or a stereochemically isomeric form thereof; the particular condition being treated and the severity of the condition being treated; various factors specific to the medical history of the subject to whom the dosage is administered such as the age; weight, sex, extent of disorder and general physical condition of the particular subject, as well as other medication the individual may be taking; as is well known to those skilled in the art. Furthermore, it is evident that said effective daily amount may be lowered or increased depending on the response of the treated subject and/or depending on the evaluation of the physician prescribing the compounds of the instant invention. [00444] Depending on the mode of administration, the pharmaceutical composition will comprise from 0.05 to 99 % by weight, preferably from 0.1 to 70 % by weight, more preferably from 0.1 to 50 % by weight of the active ingredient, and, from 1 to 99.95 % by weight, preferably from 30 to 99.9 % by weight, more preferably from 50 to 99.9 % by weight of a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, all percentages being based on the total weight of the composition. [00445] In the treatment conditions which require positive allosteric modulation of metabotropic glutamate receptor activity an appropriate dosage level will generally be about 0.01 to 1000 mg per kg patient body weight per day and can be administered in single or multiple doses. In various aspects, the dosage level will be about 0.1 to about 500 mg/kg per day, about 0.1 to 250 mg/kg per day, or about 0.5 to 100 mg/kg per day. A suitable dosage level can be about 0.01 to 1000 mg/kg per day, about 0.01 to 500 mg/kg per day, about 0.01 to 250 mg/kg per day, about 0.05 to 100 mg/kg per day, or about 0.1 to 50 mg/kg per day. Within this range the dosage can be 0.05 to 0.5, 0.5 to 5.0 or 5.0 to 50 mg/kg per day. For oral administration, the compositions are preferably provided in the form of tablets containing 1.0 to 1000 milligrams of the active ingredient, particularly 1.0, 5.0, 10, 15, 20, 25, 50, 75, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 400, 500, 600, 750, 800, 900 and 1000 milligrams of the active ingredient for the symptomatic adjustment of the dosage of the patient to be treated. The compound can be administered on a regimen of 1 to 4 times per day, preferably once or twice per day. This dosing regimen can be adjusted to provide the optimal therapeutic response. [00446] Such unit doses as described hereinabove and hereinafter can be administered more than once a day, for example, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 times a day. In various aspects, such unit doses can be administered 1 or 2 times per day, so that the total dosage for a 70 kg adult is in the range of 0.001 to about 15 mg per kg weight of subject per administration. In a further aspect, dosage is 0.01 to about 1.5 mg per kg weight of subject per administration, and such therapy can extend for a number of weeks or months, and in some cases, years. It will be understood, however, that the specific dose level for any particular patient will depend on a variety of factors including the activity of the specific compound employed; the age, body weight, general health, sex and diet of the individual being treated; the time and route of administration; the rate of excretion; other drugs that have previously been administered; and the severity of the particular disease undergoing therapy, as is well understood by those of skill in the area. [00447] A typical dosage can be one 1 mg to about 100 mg tablet or 1 mg to about 300 mg taken once a day, or, multiple times per day, or one time-release capsule or tablet taken once a day and containing a proportionally higher content of active ingredient. The time-release effect can be obtained by capsule materials that dissolve at different pH values, by capsules that release slowly by osmotic pressure, or by any other known means of controlled release. [00448] It can be necessary to use dosages outside these ranges in some cases as will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Further, it is noted that the clinician or treating physician will know how and when to start, interrupt, adjust, or terminate therapy in conjunction with individual patient response. [00449] The present invention is further directed to a method for the manufacture of a medicament for modulating glutamate receptor activity (e.g., treatment of one or more neurological and/or psychiatric disorder associated with glutamate dysfunction) in mammals (e.g., humans) comprising combining one or more disclosed compounds, products, or compositions with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. Thus, in one aspect, the invention relates to a method for manufacturing a medicament comprising combining at least one disclosed compound or at least one disclosed product with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent.

The present invention also relates to such a combination for use as a medicine.

The different drugs of such a combination or product may be combined in a single preparation together with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or diluents, or they may each be present in a separate preparation together with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or diluents. F. Methods of using the compounds and compositions [00454] The amino acid L-glutamate (referred to herein simply as glutamate) is the principal excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian central nervous system (CNS). Within the CNS, glutamate plays a key role in synaptic plasticity (e.g., long term potentiation (the basis of learning and memory)), motor control and sensory perception. It is now well understood that a variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders, including, but not limited to, schizophrenia general psychosis and cognitive deficits, are associated with dysfunctions in the glutamatergic system. Thus, modulation of the glutamatergic system is an important therapeutic goal. Glutamate acts through two distinct receptors: ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors. The first class, the ionotropic glutamate receptors, is comprised of multi-subunit ligand-gated ion channels that mediate excitatory post-synaptic currents. Three subtypes of ionotropic glutamate receptors have been identified, and despite glutamate serving as agonist for all three receptor subtypes, selective ligands have been discovered that activate each subtype. The ionotropic glutamate receptors are named after their respective selective ligands: kainite receptors, ΑΜΡΑ receptors and NMDA receptors. [00455] The second class of glutamate receptor, termed metabotropic glutamate receptors, (mGluRs), are G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) that modulate neurotransmitter release or the strength of synaptic transmission, based on their location (pre-or post-synaptic). The mGluRs are family C GPCR, characterized by a large (~560 amino acid) “Venus fly trap” agonist binding domain in the amino-terminal domain of the receptor. This unique agonist binding domain distinguishes family C GPCRs from family A and Β GPCRs wherein the agonist binding domains are located within the 7-strand transmembrane spanning (7ΤΜ) region or within the extracellular loops that connect the strands to this region. To date, eight distinct mGluRs have been identified, cloned and sequenced. Based on structural similarity, primary coupling to intracellular signalling pathways and pharmacology, the mGluRs have been assigned to three groups: Group I (mGluRl and mGluR5), Group II (mGluR2 and mGluR3) and Group III (mGluR4, mGluR6, mGluR7 and mGluR8). Group I mGluRs are coupled through Gaq/11 to increase inositol phosphate and metabolism and resultant increases in intracellular calcium. Group I mGluRs are primarily located post-synaptically and have a modulatory effect on ion channel activity and neuronal excitability. Group II (mGluR2 and mGluR3) and Group III (mGluR4, mGluR6, mGluR7 and mGluR8) mGluRs are primarily located pre-synaptically where they regulate the release of neurotransmitters, such as glutamate. Group II and Group III mGluRs are coupled to Gai and its associated effectors such as adenylate cyclase. [00456] Post-synaptic mGluRs are known to functionally interact with post-synaptic ionotropic glutamate receptors, such as the NMDA receptor. For example, activation of mGluR5 by a selective agonist has been shown to increase post-synaptic NMDA currents (Mannaioni et.al. J. Neurosci. 21:5925-5934 (2001)). Therefore, modulation of mGluRs is an approach to modulating glutamatergic transmission. Numerous reports indicate that mGluR5 plays a role in a number of disease states including anxiety (Spooren et. al. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Therapeut. 295:1267-1275 (2000), Tatarczynska et al. Br. J. Pharmaol. 132:1423-1430 (2001)), schizophrenia (reviewed in Chavez-Noriega et al. Curr. Drug Targets: CNS & Neurological Disorders 1:261-281 (2002), Kinney, G.G. et al. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Therapeut. 313:199-206 (2005)), addiction to cocaine (Chiamulera et al. Nature Neurosci. 4:873-874 (2001), Parkinson’s disease (Awad et al. J. Neurosci. 20:7871-7879 (2000), Ossowska et al. Neuropharmacol. 41: 413-420 (2001), and pain (Sait and Binns Neurosci. 100:375-380 (2001). [00457] Phencyclidine (PCP) and other NMDA receptor antagonists induce a psychotic state in humans similar to schizophrenia. In schizophrenia patients, PCP and ketamine exacerbate/precipitate pre-existing positive and negative symptoms in stable patients. Treatment with NMDA receptor co-agonists can improve positive and negative symptoms. A schematic of the NMDA receptor is shown in Figure 1. Activation of mGluR5 potentiates NMDA receptor function as shown in Figure 2. Orthosteric ligands lack subtype selectivity and can cause unwanted side effects. Allosteric modulators (see Figure 3) that can target transmembrane domains offer a pharmacologically attractive alternative. In one aspect, transmembrane domains can be significantly less conserved than extracellular loop regions. [00458] The compounds disclosed herein are allosteric modulators of metabotropic glutamate receptors, in particular they are positive allosteric modulators of mGluR5. Without wishing to be bound by a particular theory, the compounds disclosed herein are allosteric modulators of metabotropic glutamate receptors, in particular they are positive allosteric modulators of mGluR5. Again, without wishing to be bound by a particular theory, the compounds disclosed herein do not appear to bind to the glutamate recognition site, the orthosteric ligand site, but instead to an allosteric site. In the presence of glutamate or an agonist of mGluR5, the compounds of this invention increase the mGluR5 response. The compounds disclosed herein are expected to have their effect at mGluR5 by virtue of their ability to increase the response of such receptors to glutamate or mGluR5 agonists, enhancing the response of the receptor. [00459] Hence, the present invention relates compounds disclosed herein for use as a medicament, as well as to the use of a compound disclosed herein or a pharmaceutical composition according to the invention for the manufacture of a medicament, including, for example, the manufacture of a medicament for treating or preventing, in particular treating, a condition in a mammal, including a human, the treatment or prevention of which is affected or facilitated by the neuromodulatory effect of allosteric modulators of mGluR5, e.g. positive allosteric modulators thereof. The present invention also relates to a compound disclosed herein or a pharmaceutical composition according to the invention for use in the treatment or prevention of a condition in a subject such as a mammal, including a human, the treatment or prevention of which is affected or facilitated by the neuromodulatory effect of allosteric modulators of mGluR5, e.g. positive allosteric modulators thereof. 1.

Generation of human mGluR5 stable cell line [00601] Human mGluR5a cDNA in pCMV6-XL6 mammalian expression plasmid was purchased from OriGene Technologies, Inc. (catalogue number SC326357) and subcloned into pcDNA3.1(-). Human embryonic kidney (ΗΕΚ)293Α cells were then transfected with human mGluR5a pcDNA3.1(-) using LipofectAmine2000 (Invitrogen) and monoclones were selected and tested for functional response using a Ca2+ mobilization assay. Monoclones were named for the species (“H” for human) plus the location on the plate (e.g. “10H”). 7. Cell-based Functional Assay [00602] ΗΕΚ cells transfected with the human mGluR5a receptor (Η10Η or Η12Η cell line) were plated at 15,000 cells/well in clear-bottomed poly-D-lysine-coated assay plates (BD Falcon) in glutamate-glutamine-free growth medium and incubated overnight at 37°C and 5% CO2. Cell-lines used were either the Η10Η or Η12Η cell-lines expressing the human mGluR5 receptor. The following day, the growth medium was removed and the cells were washed with assay buffer containing IX Hank’s balanced salt solution (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), 20 1τ1Μ HEPES, 2.5 1τ1Μ probenecid, pH 7.4 and left with 20 pL of this reagent. Following this step, the cells were loaded with calcium indicator dye, fluo-4 AM, to a final concentration of 2 μΜ and incubated for 40-45 min at 37 °C. The dye solution was removed and replaced with assay buffer. Cell plates were held for 10-15 min at room temperature and were then loaded into the Functional Drug Screening System 6000 (FDSS 6000, Hamamatsu, Japan). [00603] After establishment of a fluorescence baseline for about 3 seconds, the compounds of the present invention were added to the cells, and the response in cells was measured. 2.3 minutes later an EC20 concentration of the mGluR5 receptor agonist glutamate was added to the cells, and the response of the cells was measured for about 1.7 minutes. All test compounds were dissolved and diluted to a concentration of 10 mM in 100% DMSO and then serially diluted into assay buffer for a 2χ stock solution in 0.6% DMSO; stock compounds were then added to the assay for a final DMSO concentration of 0.3% after the first addition to the assay well. Calcium fluorescence measures were recorded as fold over basal fluorescence; raw data was then normalized to the maximal response to glutamate. Potentiation of the agonist response of the mGluR5 receptor in the present invention was observed as an increase in response to submaximal concentrations of glutamate in the presence of compound compared to the response to glutamate in the absence of compound. 8. Data analysis [00604] The concentration-response curves of compounds of the present invention, obtained in the presence of EC20 of mGluR5 receptor agonist glutamate to determine positive allosteric modulation, were generated using Microsoft Excel with IDBS XLFit add-ins. The raw data file containing all time points was used as the data source in the analysis template. This was saved by the FDSS as a tab-delimited text file. Data were normalized using a static ratio function (F/Fo) for each measurement of the total 350 values per well divided by each well’s initial value. Data was then reduced as to peak amplitudes (Max - Initial Min) using a time range that starts approximately 1 second after the glutamate EC20 addition and continues for approximately 40 seconds. This is sufficient time to capture the peak amplitude of the cellular Calcium response. Individual amplitudes were expressed as %EMax by multiplying each amplitude by 100 and then dividing the product by the mean of the amplitudes derived from the glutamate ECMax-treated wells. pECTo values for test compounds were generated by fitting the normalized values versus the log of the test compound concentration (in mol/L) using a 4 parameter logistic equation where none of the parameters were fixed. Each of the three values collected at each concentration of test compound were weighted evenly. Individual values falling outside the 95% prediction limits of the curve fit were automatically excluded from the fit. A compound was designated as a positive allosteric modulator if the compound showed a concentration-dependent increase in the glutamate EC20 addition. %E\iax for compounds may be estimated using the resulting corresponding parameter value determined using the curve fit or by taking an average of the overall maximum response at a single concentration. These two methods are in good agreement for curves with a clear plateau at the high concentration range. For data that show an increase in the EC20 response, but, do not hit a plateau, the average of the maximum response at a single concentration is preferred. For consistency purposes across the range of potencies observed, all EMax values reported in this application are calculated using the maximum average response at a single concentration. The %EMax value for each compound reported in this application is defined as the maximum % effect obtained in a concentration-response curve of that compound expressed as a percent of the response of a maximally effect concentration of glutamate. Table I above shows the pharmacological data obtained for a selected set of compounds. [00605] For compounds showing a lower potency (e.g. as indicated by a lack of a plateau in the concentration response curve), but with a greater than a 20% increase in glutamate response, a potency of > 10 μΜ (pECso < 5) was estimated. 9. Activity of Compounds in Cell-based Assays [00606] Table V below lists specific compounds as well as experimentally determined mGluR5 activity determined in a cell-based. The mGluR5 activity was determined using the metabotropic glutamate receptor activity assays in human embryonic kidney cells as described herein, wherein the human embryonic kidney cells were transfected with human mGluR5. The data in Table III were obtained using the HI0Η cell-line which expresses recombinant human mGluR5. The compound number corresponds to the compound numbers used in Tables I and II.

Prospective In Vitro Effects [00607] The compounds provided in the present invention are allosteric modulators of mGluR5, e.g. positive allosteric modulators ofmGluR5. These compounds can potentiate glutamate responses by binding to an allosteric site other than the glutamate binding site. The response of mGluR5 to a concentration of glutamate is increased when compounds of the formula given below are present. These compounds are expected to have their effect substantially at mGluR5 by virtue of their ability to enhance the function of the receptor. The behaviour of mGluR5 positive allosteric modulators can be tested using the intracellular Ca2+ mobilization assay method described above which is suitable for the identification of such compounds. For example, disclosed compounds as described hereinbefore, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, or polymorph thereof, are expected to show such in vitro effects. Moreover, compounds prepared using the disclosed synthetic methods are also expected to show such in vitro effects. 11. Prospective In Vivo Effects [00608] Generally clinically relevant antipsychotic agents (both typical and atypical) display efficacy in preclinical behavior challenge models. The compounds described in the preceding examples are expected to show in vivo effects in various animal behavioural challenge models known to the skilled person, such as amphetamine-induced or phencyclidine (PCP)-induced hyperlocomotion, and other models, such as NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 -induced locomotor activity conducted in rodent, such as rat or mouse, but may be conducted in other animal species as is convenient to the study goals. Compounds, products, and compositions disclosed herein are expected to show in vivo effects in various animal behavioural challenge models known to the skilled person, such as amphetamine-induced or phencyclidine (PCP)-induced hyperlocomotion in rodent, and other models, such as NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801-induced locomotor activity. These models are typically conducted in rodent, such as rat or mouse, but may be conducted in other animal species as is convenient to the study goals. [00609] A suitable assay for determination of the in vivo effects of the disclosed compounds is the induced hyperlocomotion animal model. Briefly, locomotor activity can be assessed as mean distance traveled (cm) in standard 16x16 photocell testing chambers measuring 43.2 cm (Length) χ 43.2 cm (Width) χ 30.5 cm (Height) (Med Associates, St. Albans, VT). Animals are habituated to individual activity chambers for at least 30 min prior to drug administration. Following administration of drug or vehicle, activity is recorded for a 90 minute time period. Data are expressed as the mean (± SEM) distance traveled recorded in 5 min intervals over the test period. The data are analyzed using repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by post-hoc testing using Dunnett’s test, when appropriate. A difference is considered significant when ρ <0.05. [00610] Amphetamine sulfate can be obtained from Sigma (Cat#A5880-lG; St. Louis, MO) and 10 mg is dissolved in 10 ml of water. The test compound, i.e. a suitable disclosed compound, a product of a disclosed method of making, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, or polymorph thereof, is formulated in a volume of about 10 ml with an amount of drug appropriate to the dosage desired in the assay. For example, the appropriate amount of test compound can be mixed into a 20% (w/v) 2-hydroxypropyl-p-cyclodextrin aqueous solution. The solution is formulated so that animals are injected with a volume equal to about 10Χ body weight. The mixture is then ultrahomogenized on ice for about 2-3 minutes using a device such as the Dismembrator (Fisher Scientific Model 150Τ). Then the pH is checked using 0-14 EMD strips and adjusted to a pH of 6-7 if necessary. The mixture is then vortexed and stored in a warm sonication bath until time to be injected. In a typical experiment, animals are administered samples of the following: (a) amphetamine sulfate, 1 mg/kg, administered subcutaneously; and, (b) test compound is administered at the appropriate doses, e.g. about 5, about 10, about 20, about 50, and/or about 100 mg/kg, by oral gavage. Test compound can be administered by oral gavage, intraperitoneally, or intramuscular as deemed appropriate by the physical characteristics, in vitro activity, and/or pharmacokinetic behavior of the test compound, and as would be reasonably ascertained by one skilled in the art. [00611] The study is carried out using male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing about 225g-275g, between about 2-3 months old (Harlan, Inc., Indianapolis, IN), were used. They are kept in the animal care facility certified by the American Association for the Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AALAC) under a 12-hour light/dark cycle (lights on: 6 a.m.; lights off: 6 p.m.) and have free access to food and water. [00612] The animals are habituated in Smart Open Field locomotor activity test chambers (Hamilton-Kinder, San Diego, CA) with 16x16 photobeams to automatically record locomotor activity for 30 min and then are dosed with vehicle or test compound as described above. The rats are then placed into cages. At 60 min, all rats are injected subcutaneously with 1 mg/kg amphetamine or vehicle and then monitored for an additional 60 min. Animals are monitored for a total of 120 minutes. Data are expressed as changes in ambulation defined as total number of beam breaks per 5 min periods. [00613] The data for the dose-response studies are analyzed by a between-group analysis of variance. If there is a main effect of dose, then each dose group is compared with the BCD vehicle / amphetamine group. The calculations are performed using JMP IN 8 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) statistical software and graphed using SigmaPlot9 (Saugua, MA). [00614] Compounds of the present invention are expected as a class to show in vivo efficacy in a preclinical rat behavioral model, where known, clinically useful antipsychotics display similar positive responses. For example, disclosed compounds as described hereinbefore, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, or polymorph thereof, are expected to show such in vivo effects. Moreover, compounds prepared using the disclosed synthetic methods are also expected to show such in vivo effects. 12.

They were kept in the animal care facility certified by the American Association for the Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AALAC) under a 12-hour light/dark cycle (lights on: 6 a.m.; lights off: 6 p.m.) and had free access to food and water. The experimental protocols performed during the light cycle were approved by the Institutional Animals Care and Use Committee of Vanderbilt University and conformed to the guidelines established by the National Research Council Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals [00616] Locomotor activity was assessed as mean distance traveled (cm) in in Smart Open Field locomotor activity test chambers (Hamilton-Kinder, San Diego, CA) with 16 χ 16 photobeams with chambers measuring 43.2 cm (Length) χ 43.2 cm (Width) χ 30.5 cm (Height) (Med Associates, St. Albans, VT). The animals were habituated for 30 min and then dosed with vehicle or test compound. The rats were then placed into cages. At 60 min, all rats were injected subcutaneously with 1 mg/kg amphetamine or vehicle and then monitored for an additional 60 min. Animals are monitored for a total of 120 minutes. [00617] Data are expressed as the mean (± SEM) distance traveled recorded in 5 min intervals over the test period. The data was analyzed using repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by post-hoc testing using Dunnetf s test, when appropriate. A difference was considered significant when ρ <0.05. The data for the dose-response studies were analyzed by a between-group analysis of variance. If there was a main effect of dose, then each dose group was compared with the vehicle amphetamine group. The calculations were performed using JMP IN 8 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) statistical software and graphed using SigmaPlot9 (Saugua, MA). [00618] Amphetamine sulfate was obtained from Sigma (Cat#A5880-lG; St. Louis, MO) and 10 mg was dissolved in 10 ml of water. Test compound, 2-(benzyloxy)-5-(6-(dimethylamino)pyridin-2-yl)-6,7-dihydropyrazolo[ 1,5-a]pyrazin-4(5H)-one (B 15), was formulated in a volume of 10 ml with an amount of drug appropriate to the dosage indicated. The appropriate amount of compound was mixed into a 20% 2-hydroxypropyl-p-cyclodextrin (2-ΗΡ-β-Οϋ ) solution. The solution was formulated so that animals were injected with a volume equal to about 10Χ body weight. The mixture was then ultrahomogenized on ice for 2-3 minutes using the Dismembrator (Fisher Scientific Model 150Τ). Then the pH was checked using 0-14 EMD strips and adjusted to a pH of 6-7 if necessary. The mixture was then vortexed and stored in a warm sonication bath until time to be injected. Animals were administered the following: (a) Amphetamine sulfate (“Amph”), 1 mg/kg, administered subcutaneously; (b) 2-(benzyloxy)-5-(6-(dimethylamino)pyridin-2-yl)-6,7-dihydropyrazolo[l,5-a]pyrazin-4(5H)-one, dose as indicated in Figure 4, was administered by oral gavage (“p.o.” in figure); and (c) vehicle, pH 7, administered by oral gavage.
