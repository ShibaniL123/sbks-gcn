Example 7-10 : Preparation of [6'-(3-dimethylamino-acryloyl)-3'-methoxy-[2,2']bipyridinyl-6-yl-imidocarbonic acid -1,3-bis(1,1-dimethylethyl)ester (LIII)
(6'-Acetyl-3'methoxy-[2,2']bipyridinyl-6-yl)-imidodicarbonic acid-1,3-bis(1,1-dimethylethyl)ester (LII) (55 mg, 0.12 mmol) was added to 3 ml of N,N-dimethylformamide dimethyl acetal (DMFDMA) and the resulting mixture was stirred with reflux for 20 hrs. And then, the mixture was extracted with 30 ml of water and 30 ml of ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed with brine two times. The organic layer was treated with magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) and filtered, and the resulting solution was concentrated and purified by silica gel column chromatography (normal hexane : ethylacetate = 1 : 1, v/v) to give the title compound as a solid (38 mg, 0.08 mmol, 67 %).
