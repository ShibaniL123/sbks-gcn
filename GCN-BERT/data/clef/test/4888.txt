CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION The present application claims priority from U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/697,132, filed Sep. 5, 2012, entitled “Solar Powered Hydroseeder/Fertilizer Machine”, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. FIELD The invention pertains to hydro-seeding and more specifically a hydroseeding system that is economical, efficient, portable and environmentally friendly. BACKGROUND Hydroseeding (or hydraulic mulch seeding, hydro-mulching, hydraseeding) is a planting process that uses a slurry of water, seed, mulch and fertilizer. The slurry is transported in a housing, either truck-mounted or trailer-mounted and sprayed over prepared ground in a uniform layer. Alternatively, helicopters and aircraft can be used where larger areas must be covered, such as, for example, burned wilderness areas after a fire. Hydroseeding is an alternative to the traditional process of broadcasting or sowing dry seed and promotes quick germination and inhibits soil erosion. Hydroseeding is used to seed grass on residential and commercial sites (highways/motorways etc.), golf courses, lawns and areas too large, inaccessible or unsuitable for conventional methods. Starting a lawn by hydroseeding is considerably cheaper than laying sod/turf and quicker than dry seed. It is also used to spread mixtures of wildflower and tree/shrub seeds or turf grasses for erosion control. Hydroseeding typically has similar costs to dry seeding techniques that combine seed and straw mulch. Further, the hydroseeding slurry is weed free whereas straw mulch can contain weeds. Also, hydroseeding is less than ¼ the cost of laying sod/turf. Disadvantageously, there has never been a portable hydroseeder due to the pressure required to eject the mulch. As described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,717,285, hydroseeding is currently done by hiring a contractor that has a truck with separate housings for the water and dry ingredients (mulch, seed, fertilizer and water etc.) and an agitator pump to mix the water and dry ingredients to produce a slurry that can be spread over a large area. U.S. Pat. No. 4,913,356 describes a portable seeding device that uses suction, using the venturi effect, to lift a mixture of water and seed from a jar. The constriction required to lift the seed and water out of the jar using the venturi effect is insufficient to allow mulch and fertilizer to be added to the jar. Additionally, the amount of seed, mulch, fertilizer and water required to cover at least one square foot area would make the jar extremely large and unwieldy. Therefore, there is a need for a hydroseeder that is economical, efficient, portable and environmentally friendly that overcomes the problems of the prior art. SUMMARY The problems of the prior art have been successfully overcome by the present invention, which is directed to a portable hydroseeding method. The system comprises a portable housing means for containing a slurry, a propellant means connected to the housing and outlet control means for distributing a slurry. The propellant means can be a direct current battery powering a direct current pump/motor connection or a direct current battery charged by a solar panel(s) or solar cell(s) which in turn powers the direct current pump/motor connection. Preferably, the propellant connection is a direct current motor/pump battery connection (solar optional). The housing may hold all of the parts needed to complete the steps needed to comprise a direct current portable hydroseeder that is economical, efficient and affordable, but it may also be noted that some or all of the portable hydroseeder's parts may be mounted to a cart, wagon or hand truck etc. The housing further comprises an threaded cap/lid, a agitation/return jet valve circuit, an output valve direct current pump(s)/motor(s) circuit, in another embodiment a booster agitation pump/motor for agitating a slurry, a booster pump/motor for boosting and distributing a slurry, an output nozzle valve for controlling the output of the slurry to the earth, a return circulation circuit for the agitation pump/motor, a direct current output motor/pump for slurry distribution and or agitation, a vacuum slurry pickup hose inside of the tank, an optional dual vacuum slurry pickup for circulation and mixing of the slurry, an electric switch or if multiple pump/motors are used switches, a direct current battery to power the motor(s)/pump(s), a solar panel or solar cell to charge the direct current battery and a solar panel charge controller to maintain the proper charge in the direct current battery. The housing, control valves and water and slurry jets may be constructed from wood, plastic, aluminum, steel, fiberglass, carbon fiber, polyethylene, resin, vinyl, PVC and glass, but preferably from stainless steel. There is a method for using the direct current portable hydroseeding system comprising of the of: a) removing thatch and or dead vegetation from one or more than one areas to be seeded; b) loosening the soil from one or more than one areas to be seeded; c) placing the hydroseeder proximate to one or more than one areas to be seeded; d) fill the hydroseeder ½ with water; e) prime hose(s) and pump(s) with water; f) adding dry ingredients to the hydroseeder; g) turn on hydroseeder to form a slurry; h) opening the outlet control valve; i) applying the slurry to the loosened earth until the housing becomes free of seed; and j) repeating steps c through i until all areas are seeded.
