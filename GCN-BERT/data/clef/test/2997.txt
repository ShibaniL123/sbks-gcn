IMMUNOMODULATING β-Ι,ό-D-GLUCANS CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS [0001] This application claims priority from U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/990,337, filed May 8, 2014, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. FIELD OF THE INVENTION [0002] This invention relates to modifications of -l,6-D-glucans and the ability of these compositions to modulate an immune response. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0003] The cell walls of fungi evoke a powerful immune-stimulatory response. More than 50% of the cell walls of Candida albicans is composed of an inner layer of P-l,3/l,6-D-glucan covalently linked to a variety of cell surface mannoproteins [Klis, F. M. et al. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 26, 239-259, 2002]. Preparations of these P-l,3/l,6-glucans act as immunostimulants [Lee, J.N. et al. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 65, 837-841, 2001 ; Sakurai, T. et al. J. Leukoc. Biol. 60, 118- 124, 1996]. [0004] Specifically, P-l,6-D-glucan, more than P- l,3-D-glucan, has been shown to recruit and activate human neutrophils [Rubin-Bejerano I. et al., Cell Host Microbe. 2(1): 55-67, 2007]. The activation is mediated by endogenous anti-P- l,6-glucan antibodies, mostly of the IgG2 isotype [PCT/US09/42117], as well as C3 proteolytic fragments of the complement system [Rubin-Bejerano I. et al., Cell Host Microbe. 2(1): 55-67, 2007]. Therapeutic agents that include -l,6-D-glucans can be conjugated to a targeting moiety (e.g., a cancer targeting antibody; see, e.g., PCT/US07/23307), as well as methods of using these conjugates as therapeutic agents, e.g., to treat various cancers. [0005] Accordingly, compositions comprising P-l,6-D-glucan oligosaccharides of specific sizes can be useful for the preparation of therapeutic agents. In some embodiments, the oligosaccharides have been modified in a way that would allow conjugation to targeting moieties. Such chemically modified β- 1 ,6-D-glucans have also been assayed for binding to the endogenous anti-P-l,6-D-glucan antibodies, thereby maintaining the desired function. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0006] The present invention provides novel β- 1 ,6-D-glucans and compositions thereof. Such compositions provide the ability to be recognized by IgG2 antibodies.

Suitable substituents include those described below for a substituted aliphatic group and also include those described in the specification herein. It will be appreciated that two substituents of the alkylene group may be taken together to form a ring system. In certain embodiments, two substituents can be taken together to form a 3-7-membered ring. The substituents can be on the same or different atoms. [0053] The term "alkenylene" refers to a bivalent alkenyl group. A substituted alkenylene chain is a polymethylene group containing at least one double bond in which one or more hydrogen atoms are replaced with a substituent. Suitable substituents include those described below for a substituted aliphatic group. [0054] The term "alkynylene" refers to a bivalent alkynyl group. A substituted alkynylene chain is a polymethylene group containing at least one triple bond in which one or more hydrogen atoms are replaced with a substituent. Suitable substituents include those described below for a substituted aliphatic group.

For example, the aryl group is a C6-ioaryl group (i.e., phenyl and naphthyl). Aryl groups include, without limitation, optionally substituted phenyl, naphthyl, anthracenyl, and phenanthrenyl. The terms "aryl" and "ar-", as used herein, also include groups in which an aryl ring is fused to one or more cycloaliphatic rings to form an optionally substituted cyclic structure (e.g., 2,3- dihydroindenyl; 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroaphetalenyl; 1 ,2-dihydronaphthalenyl; 2,3-dihydronaphthalenyl; 8,10- dihydroanthracenyl, fluorenyl, and the like.

As will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art, "heteroaliphatic" is intended herein to include, but is not limited to, heteroalkyl, heteroalkenyl, heteroalkynyl, and heterocyclyl moieties. Thus, as used herein, the term "heteroalkyl" includes straight, branched and cyclic alkyl groups, as defined herein, which are optionally substituted with one or more functional groups, and that contain one or more oxygen, sulfur, nitrogen, phosphorus, or silicon atoms, e.g. , in place of carbon atoms. An analogous convention applies to other generic terms such as "heteroalkenyl", "heteroalkynyl", and the like. Furthermore, as used herein, the terms "heteroalkyl", "heteroalkenyl", "heteroalkynyl", and the like encompass both substituted and unsubstituted groups.

[0058] As used herein, the terms "heterocycle", "heterocyclyl", "heterocyclic radical", and "heterocyclic ring" are used interchangeably and refer to a stable 3- to 8-membered monocyclic or 7—10- membered bicyclic heterocyclic moiety that is either saturated or partially unsaturated, and having, in addition to carbon atoms, one or more, such as one to four, heteroatoms, as defined above. When used in reference to a ring atom of a heterocycle, the term "nitrogen" includes a substituted nitrogen. As an example, in a saturated or partially unsaturated ring having 0-3 heteroatoms selected from oxygen, sulfur or nitrogen, the nitrogen may be N (as in 3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrrolyl), NH (as in pyrrolidinyl), or NR+ (as in N-substituted pyrrolidinyl). [0059] A heterocyclic ring can be attached to its pendant group at any heteroatom or carbon atom that results in a stable structure and any of the ring atoms can be optionally substituted. Examples of such saturated or partially unsaturated heterocyclic radicals include, without limitation, tetrahydrofuranyl, tetrahydrothienyl, piperidinyl, decahydroquinolinyl, oxazolidinyl, piperazinyl, dioxanyl, dioxolanyl, diazepinyl, oxazepinyl, thiazepinyl, morpholinyl, and thiamorpholinyl. A heterocyclyl group may be mono-, bi-, tri-, or polycyclic, preferably mono-, bi-, or tricyclic, more preferably mono- or bicyclic. The term "heterocyclylalkyl" refers to an alkyl group substituted by a heterocyclyl, wherein the alkyl and heterocyclyl portions independently are optionally substituted. Additionally, a heterocyclic ring also includes groups in which the heterocyclic ring is fused to one or more aryl rings. [0060] The terms "heteroaryl" and "heteroar-", used alone or as part of a larger moiety, e.g., "heteroaralkyl", or "heteroaralkoxy", refer to groups having 5 to 14 ring atoms, preferably 5, 6, 9, or 10 ring atoms; having 6, 10, or 14 π electrons shared in a cyclic array; and having, in addition to carbon atoms, from one to five heteroatoms. A heteroaryl group may be mono-, bi-, tri-, or polycyclic, for example, mono-, bi-, or tricyclic, (e.g., mono- or bicyclic). The term "heteroatom" refers to nitrogen, oxygen, or sulfur, and includes any oxidized form of nitrogen or sulfur, and any quaternized form of a basic nitrogen. For example, a nitrogen atom of a heteroaryl may be a basic nitrogen atom and may also be optionally oxidized to the corresponding N-oxide. When a heteroaryl is substituted by a hydroxy group, it also includes its corresponding tautomer. The terms "heteroaryl" and "heteroar-", as used herein, also include groups in which a heteroaromatic ring is fused to one or more aryl, cycloaliphatic, or heterocycloaliphatic rings.

The term "heteroaralkyl" refers to an alkyl group substituted by a heteroaryl, wherein the alkyl and heteroaryl portions independently are optionally substituted. [0061] An aryl (including aralkyl, aralkoxy, aryloxyalkyl and the like) or heteroaryl (including heteroaralkyl and heteroarylalkoxy and the like) group may contain one or more substituents and thus may be "optionally substituted". In addition to the substituents defined above and herein, suitable substituents on the unsaturated carbon atom of an aryl or heteroaryl group also include and are generally selected from -halo, -N02, -CN, -R+, -C(R+)=C(R+)2, -C≡C-R+, -OR+, -SR°, -S(0)R°, -S02R°, -S03R+, -S02N(R+)2, -N(R+)2, -NR+C(0)R+, -NR+C(S)R+, -NR+C(0)N(R+)2, -NR+C(S)N(R+)2, - N(R+)C(=NR+)-N(R+)2, -N(R+)C(=NR+)-R°, -NR+C02R+, -NR+S02R°, -NR+S02N(R+)2, -0-C(0)R+, -O-C 02R+, -OC(0)N(R+)2, -C(0)R+, -C(S)R°, -C02R+, -C(0)-C(0)R+, -C(0)N(R+)2, -C(S)N(R+)¾ -C(0)N(R+) -OR+, -C(0)N(R+)C(=NR+)-N(R+)2, -N(R+)C(=NR+)-N(R+)-C(0)R+, -C(=NR+)-N(R+)2, -C(=NR+)-OR+, - N(R+)-N(R+)2, -C(=NR+)-N(R+)-OR+, -C(R°)=N-OR+, -P(0)(R+)2, -P(0)(OR+)2, -0-P(0)-OR+, and -P(0)(NR+)-N(R+)2, wherein R+, independently, is hydrogen or an optionally substituted aliphatic, aryl, heteroaryl, cycloaliphatic, or heterocyclyl group, or two independent occurrences of R+ are taken together with their intervening atom(s) to form an optionally substituted 5-7-membered aryl, heteroaryl, cycloaliphatic, or heterocyclyl ring. Each R° is an optionally substituted aliphatic, aryl, heteroaryl, cycloaliphatic, or heterocyclyl group. [0062] An aliphatic or heteroaliphatic group, or a non-aromatic carbocyclic or heterocyclic ring may contain one or more substituents and thus may be "optionally substituted". Unless otherwise defined above and herein, suitable substituents on the saturated carbon of an aliphatic or heteroaliphatic group, or of a non-aromatic carbocyclic or heterocyclic ring are selected from those listed above for the unsaturated carbon of an aryl or heteroaryl group and additionally include the following: =0, =S, =C(R*)2, =N- N(R*)2, =N-OR*, =N-NHC(0)R*, =N-NHC02R° =N-NHS02R° or =N-R* where R° is defined above, and each R* is independently selected from hydrogen or an optionally substituted Ci_6 aliphatic group. In certain embodiments, an aliphatic group (e.g., an alkyl group as described herein) comprises one or more substitutents independently selected from alkoxy, aryloxy, sulfhydryl, alkylthio, arylthio, halogen, alkylsilyl, hydroxyl, fluoroalkyl, perfluoralkyl, amino, aminoalkyl disubstituted amino, quaternary amino, hydroxylalkyl, carboxylalkyl, and carboxyl groups. [0063] In addition to the substituents defined above and herein, optional substituents on the nitrogen of a non-aromatic heterocyclic ring also include and are generally selected from -R+, -N(R+)2, -C(0)R+, -C(0)OR+, -C(0)C(0)R+, -C(0)CH2C(0)R+, -S(0)2R+, -S(0)2N(R+)2, -C(S)N(R+)2, -C(=NH)-N(R+)2, or -N(R+)S(0)2R+; wherein each R+ is defined above. A ring nitrogen atom of a heteroaryl or non-aromatic heterocyclic ring also may be oxidized to form the corresponding N-hydroxy or N-oxide compound. A nonlimiting example of such a heteroaryl having an oxidized ring nitrogen atom is N-oxidopyridyl. [0064] As detailed above, in some embodiments, two independent occurrences of R (or any other variable similarly defined in the specification and claims herein), are taken together with their intervening atom(s) to form a monocyclic or bicyclic ring selected from 3-13-membered cycloaliphatic, 3-12-membered heterocyclyl having 1-5 heteroatoms independently selected from nitrogen, oxygen, or sulfur, 6-10-membered aryl, or 5-10-membered heteroaryl having 1-5 heteroatoms independently selected from nitrogen, oxygen, or sulfur. [0065] Exemplary rings that are formed when two independent occurrences of R+ (or any other variable similarly defined in the specification and claims herein), are taken together with their intervening atom(s) include, but are not limited to the following: a) two independent occurrences of R+ (or any other variable similarly defined in the specification or claims herein) that are bound to the same atom and are taken together with that atom to form a ring, for example, N(R+)2, where both occurrences of R+ are taken together with the nitrogen atom to form a piperidin-l-yl, piperazin- 1 -yl, or morpholin-4-yl group; and b) two independent occurrences of R+ (or any other variable similarly defined in the specification or claims herein) that are bound to different atoms and are taken together with both of those atoms to form a ring, for example where a phenyl group is substituted with two occurrences of OR+ , these two occurrences of R+ are taken together with the oxygen atoms to which they are bound to form a fused 6- membered oxygen containing ring: It will be appreciated that a variety of other rings (e.g., spiro and bridged rings) can be formed when two independent occurrences of R+ (or any other variable similarly defined in the specification and claims herein) are taken together with their intervening atom(s) and that the examples detailed above are not intended to be limiting. [0066] Unless otherwise stated, structures depicted herein are also meant to include all isomeric (e.g., enantiomeric, diastereomeric, and geometric (or conformational)) forms of the structure; for example, the R and S configurations for each asymmetric center, (Z) and (E) double bond isomers, and (Z) and (E) conformational isomers. Therefore, single stereochemical isomers as well as enantiomeric, diastereomeric, and geometric (or conformational) mixtures of the present compounds are within the scope of the invention. Unless otherwise stated, all tautomeric forms of the compounds of the invention are within the scope of the invention. Additionally, unless otherwise stated, structures depicted herein are also meant to include compounds that differ only in the presence of one or more isotopically enriched atoms. For example, compounds having the present structures where there is a replacement of hydrogen by deuterium or tritium, or a replacement of a carbon by a 13C- or 14C-enriched carbon are within the scope of this invention. Such compounds are useful, as a nonlimiting example, as analytical tools or probes in biological assays. [0067] As used herein, the term "amino acid," in its broadest sense, refers to any compound and/or substance that can be incorporated into a polypeptide chain, e.g., through formation of one or more peptide bonds. In some embodiments, an amino acid has the general structure H2N-C(H)(R)-COOH. In some embodiments, an amino acid is a naturally-occurring amino acid. In some embodiments, an amino acid is a synthetic amino acid; in some embodiments, an amino acid is a D-amino acid; in some embodiments, an amino acid is an L-amino acid. "Standard amino acid" refers to any of the twenty standard L-amino acids commonly found in naturally occurring peptides. "Nonstandard amino acid" refers to any amino acid, other than the standard amino acids, regardless of whether it is prepared synthetically or obtained from a natural source. In some embodiments, an amino acid, including a carboxy- and/or amino-terminal amino acid in a polypeptide, can contain a structural modification as compared with the general structure above. For example, in some embodiments, an amino acid may be modified by methylation, amidation, acetylation, and/or substitution as compared with the general structure. In some embodiments, such modification may, for example, alter the circulating half-life of a polypeptide containing the modified amino acid as compared with one containing an otherwise identical unmodified amino acid. In some embodiments, such modification does not significantly alter a relevant activity of a polypeptide containing the modified amino acid, as compared with one containing an otherwise identical unmodified amino acid. As will be clear from context, in some embodiments, the term "amino acid" is used to refer to a free amino acid; in some embodiments it is used to refer to an amino acid residue of a polypeptide. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENT INVENTION [0068] Also described herein are new methods that now allow the preparation the β- 1 ,6-D- glucan oligomers of the formulas described herein. Reagents and starting materials are generally available from commercial sources such as Aldrich Chemicals (Milwaukee, Wis.) or are readily prepared using methods well known to those skilled in the art (see, e.g., Louis F. Fieser and Mary Fieser, Reagents for Organic Synthesis, v. 1- 19, Wiley, New York (1967-1999 ed.), Beilsteins Handbuch der organischen Chemie, 4, Aufl. Ed. Springer-Verlag, Berlin, including supplements (also available via the Beilstein online database) or Carbohydrate Chemistry: Proven Synthetic Methods, Pavol Kovac, Ed., CRC Press, Boca Raton). [0069] Various methods for the preparation, isolation, and characterization of lower β- 1 ,6-D- glucan oligomers (e.g., 4-mer through to 9-mer) have been described. Exemplary methods include those described in Linberg, B. et al. Acta Chem. Scand. 8, 985-988, 1954 (relating to chemical transformations of pustulan, a 20 kDa P-l,6-linked D-glucose polysaccharide obtained from several species of lichen); Zhu, Y.; et al. Carbohydrate Res., 332, 1-21, 2001 (chemical synthesis); Fujimori, Y. et al. Carbohydrate Res. 344, 972-978, 2009 (enzymatic synthesis); and Bi, H. et al. Carbohydrate Res. 344, 1254-1258 2009 (natural product extraction). a-l,6-D-Glucan structures are also described in Honda, S. et al. Methods, 1992, 4, 233-243. Exemplary oligomeric β- Ι,ό-D-glucans are described Agri. Biol. Chem. 43, 2029- 2034, 1979; Carbohydrate Res . 332, 1-21, 2001; and Carbohydrate Res. 344, 972-978, 2009. Glucans are also described in Carbohydrate Research, 2013, 366:6-16. New methods for the preparation of such oligomers would be useful for the preparation of the oligomers described herein. [0070] In the present invention we have devised a new, general process for the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of pustulan that now allows for the efficient production and isolation of higher oligomers (e.g., greater than nona-saccharides). The P-l,6-D-glucan oligomers from the 10-mer through the 20-mer described herein are novel compositions of matter. Such oligomers have been isolated as discrete substances, characterized by mass spectrometry, and the stereochemical assignment of repeating β-Ι,ό-D- glucose stereochemistry has been made based on their derivation from the parent β-Ι,ό-D-glucan polymer pustulan. [0071] In the general case, oligosaccharide synthetic methodology has as its key step the selective activation of a glycosidic center (C- l) in a suitably protected donor reactant followed by the formation of a bond to the oxygen of a free hydroxyl group at C-6 of a suitably protected acceptor reactant, giving rise to a product that has both reactants linked 1 ,6 through a newly formed glycosidic bond. When an acyloxy substituent such as acetate or benzoate is present at C-2 of the donor, there is often a high degree of selectivity for β- stereochemistry of the resulting glycosidic bond. The tendency for β-stereoselectivity of the newly formed glycosidic bond is thought to arise from neighboring group participation by the acyloxy group located at the 2-position of the donor, such that the acyl carbonyl stabilizes the build-up of positive charge at C- 1 , thus blocking the approach of a nucleophile from the a- face and directing it to the β-face of the donor reactant [Lindhorst, T. K. Essentials in Carbohydrate Chemistry and Biochemistry, Wiley- VCH: Weinheim, 2003]. [0072] General chemical synthesis strategies for preparing useful synthetic precursors for the higher P-l,6-linked D-glucose polysaccharides described herein divide along two lines: solid phase synthesis and solution phase synthesis. Solid phase methods providing high stereoselectivity for formation of each β-1,6 glycosidic linkage are described for the preparation of simple P- l,6-linked D- glucose polysaccharides of up to five glucose units comprised of branched P-l,6/l,3)-linked D-glucose oligomers. These methods employ a variety of activating functionalities in the donor reactant, including phosphates, epoxides and phenylsulfoxides [Zheng, C. et al. J.Org. Chem. 63, 1 126- 1 130, 1998; Andrade, R. B. et al. Org. Lett. 1, 181 1, 1999; Plante, O. J. et al. Science, 291, 1523, 2001 ; Nicolaou, K. C. et al. J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 1 19, 449-450, 1999]. [0073] Several solution phase syntheses described in the literature provide specific examples of preparing P-l,6-linked D-glucose polysaccharides in the range of dimers to octamers. Examples include the polymerization of 2,3,4,5-tetra-O-acetyl-D-glucose in the presence of zinc chloride followed by removal of the acetyl groups to give a mixture of P-l,6-linked glucose di-, tri-, terra-, hexa-, and heptasaccharides [Parish, C. R. et al. PCT, WO 199633726] and stepwise synthesis using trichloracetimidate intermediates to prepare di-, tri-, terra-, hexa- and octa^-l,6-linked D-glucose polysaccharides [Zhu, Y. et al. Carbohydrate Res. 332, 1-21, 2001]. One example that illustrates the complexity of stepwise synthesis and the critical attention that must be paid to careful strategic choice of orthogonal reactivity to achieve selectivity when forming each β- 1 ,6-linked glucose is seen in the five- step synthesis of a per-benzoylated O-pentenyl P-l,6-linked glucose hexa-saccharide [Kaeothip, S. et al. J. Org. Chem. 76, 7388-7398, 201 1]. Other oligosaccharides are described in WO 1996/33726. [0074] For illustrative purposes, the reaction schemes depicted below provide potential routes for synthesizing the compounds of the present invention, as well as key intermediates. For a more detailed description of the individual reaction steps in certain embodiments, see the Examples section below. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that other synthetic routes may be used to synthesize the inventive compounds. Although specific starting materials and reagents are depicted in the schemes and discussed below, it will be recognized that other starting materials and reagents can be easily substituted to provide a variety of derivatives and/or reaction conditions. In addition, many of the compounds prepared by the methods described below can be further modified in light of this disclosure using conventional chemistry well known to those skilled in the art. [0075] In another aspect, the invention features methods for the preparation of β- 1 ,6-D-glucan oligomers, e.g., as described herein in Schemes I-XI. [0076] In other embodiments, the invention features compositions comprising synthetic intermediates or compounds described in Schemes I-XI as described herein. [0077] In one embodiment, P-l,6-D-glucan oligomers of formula (la) can be generally prepared according to Scheme I, comprising Steps a, b, and c. In Step a, the P-l,6-D-glucan starting material A containing a C- 1 hydroxyl is reacted with an acylating agent to produce a per-acetylated glycoside B. In Step b, intermediate B is reacted with a Lewis acid and an alkyl alcohol to give a β-Ο-alkyl glycoside C. In Step c, material C is hydrolyzed (e.g., using basic hydrolysis) to remove the acyl groups to give an oligomer D according to formula (la), wherein R is an unsubstituted or substituted alkyl. Scheme I Reactions: a) (RCO)20 or RCOCI/base; b) Lewis acid catalyst, AlkylOH; c) basic hydrolysis [0078] In another embodiment, the β-Ι,ό-D-glucan oligomers of formula (la) can be prepared as shown in Scheme II. Scheme II Reagents and Conditions: a) Ac20, NaOAc, solvent, heat; b) Lewis acid, HOfCHjCHjO^CHjCHjCI, DCM; c) NaN3; d) NaO e, MeOH [0079] In Scheme II, the β- 1 ,6-D-glucan starting material A containing a C- 1 hydroxyl is reacted with acetic anhydride/sodium acetate to produce a per-acetylated glycoside B (Step a). In Step b, intermediate B is reacted with a Lewis acid such as FeCl3 and a halo-substituted alkyl alcohol selected from the group HO(CH2CH20)aCH2CH2Cl to give a β-Ο-haloalkyl glycoside F, wherein a is 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. This material F is reacted with sodium azide to give an azido-substituted O-alkyl glycoside E, which is reacted with NaOMe/MeOH to give the oligomer G of formula (la) wherein R is azido-substituted alkyl. [0080] Unexpectedly, we have observed that the Lewis acid, the solvent and the reaction conditions used in step c in Scheme II play a critical role in obtaining a successful outcome. When using the Lewis acid SnCl4/Ag02CCF3 in dichloromethane [see, e.g., Ceccione, S. et al. Carbohydrate Chemistry: Proven Synthetic Methods, pp. 175-180, Pavol Kovac, Ed., CRC Press, Boca Raton], we obtained fragmentation and formation of mixtures of alkyl glycosides of several lower order oligosaccharides. The development of synthetic conditions using FeCl3 in toluene, and heating at 45 °C with careful monitoring gave the desired alkyl glycoside in high yield and with reduced fragmentation. [0081] In another aspect, the invention features any of the oligomers described in any of the synthetic schemes described herein, as well as compositions comprising said oligomers. In one embodiment, the oligomer has a structure according to B, , wherein n is 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 1 1, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, or 20. In some embodiments, n is 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, or 18. In some embodiments, n is 8, 9, 10, 1 1, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, or 20. In other embodiments, n is 8, 9, 10, 1 1, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, or 18. [0082] In another embodiment, the P-l,6-D-glucan oligomers of formula (Ia)can be prepared as shown in Scheme III. Scheme III R' = alkyICO- or ArylCO- R" = alkyICO- or ArylCO- Reagents and Conditions: a) Lewis acid, HO(CH2CH20)aCH2CH2CI, DCM; b) hydrolysis In Scheme III, the alkyl or aryl moiety of the carbonyl group is, independently, substituted or unsubstituted. This scheme uses as one reactant a suitably protected acceptor reactant H composed of n D-glucopyranoside units, wherein x is an integer from 0 to 6 (e.g., x is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6), and containing a β-oriented O-alkyl (unsubstituted or substituted) group at CI of its first unit and a free hydroxyl group at C6 of its terminal unit. In other embodiments, x is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. The donor reactant J is a suitably protected molecule composed of y D-glucopyranoside units, wherein y is an integer from 0 to 6 (e.g., y is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6), and containing an activating functionality such as trichloroacetimidate, arylsulfmyl, arylsulfide, acetyl, and thioimidate at CI . In other embodiments, y is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. Condensation in Step a of this acceptor donor pair using appropriate Lewis acid catalysts results in an oligomeric β- Ι,ό-D- glucan product K. Subsequent hydrolysis in Step b removes the protective groups giving the product D according to formula (la). [0083] We have observed unexpected reactivity in step a of Scheme III when attempting the condensation of a 4-mer acceptor (alkyl = CH2CH2N3; x = 3; R = C6H5CO) with a 2-mer-donor, A (R - t-BuPh2Si) B (R = Et3Si) When the 2-mer donor was the tert-butyldiphenylsilyl-substituted A, only traces of the desired 6-mer product was observed; however when the donor was the triethylsilyl-substituted B, we obtained the desired 6-mer. [0084] In another embodiment, the method Scheme IV can be used for the preparation of compounds of formula I. Scheme IV Reagents and Conditions: a)H2Nalkylazide, NaBH3CN, b) H2CO, alkylCHO or arylCHO, NaBH3CN, In Step A, the β- Ι ,ό-D-glucan starting material A containing a C- l hydroxyl is reacted with an azido- substituted primary alkylamine under conditions of reductive amination. This reaction gives a β- Ι ,ό-D- glucan L that is reduced by one D-glucopyranose unit, wherein the terminal reducing D-glucopyranose unit has been transformed into a 1 -amino- 1 -desoxy-D-glucitol. That intermediate is subjected to the reductive alkylation with formaldehyde, or an alkyl or aryl aldehyde to give a trisubstituted amine M according to formula I. [0085] In one embodiment, β- 1,6-D-glucan oligomers of formula I can be generally prepared according to Scheme V. Scheme V Reagents and Conditions: a) amino acid, NaBH3CN, b) for R = H: H2CO or alkylCHO or arylCHO, NaBH3CN, A β- 1 ,6-D-glucan starting material A containing a C- 1 hydroxyl is reacted with an amino acid under conditions of reductive amination to afford a compound comprising, e.g., a carboxyl alkyl (e.g., where an aliphatic amino acid is used) or a carboxy aryl (e.g., where an aromatic amino acid is used). In correspondence with scheme IV this reaction gives a β- 1 ,6-D-glucan N that is reduced by one D- glucopyranose unit, wherein the terminal reducing D-glucopyranose unit has been transformed into a 1- amino- 1 -desoxy-D-glucitol. In cases where the product is a secondary amine, that intermediate may be further transformed by reductive alkylation with an alkyl or aryl aldehyde to give a trisubstituted amine O. The resulting product has the composition (la) wherein R is (2R,3R,4R,5RS)-2,3,4,5- tetrahydroxy-6-(N-alkyl-N-(carboxy-substituted alkyl))hexyl. [0086] In one embodiment, β- 1,6-D-glucan oligomers of formula I can be generally prepared according to Scheme VI. Reagents and Conditions: a) reductive amination: • a mono-protected bisamine NHR"'-R"-NHPG where R" is an alkylene, arylene, or heteroarylene; PG is a nitrogen protecting group; and R'" is H or alkyl; and NaBH3CN b) reductive amination when R'" = H: • H2CO, (alkyl)CHO, (aryl)CHO, or (heteroaryl)CHO; and . NaBH3CN c) deprotection (e.g., acidic conditions or hb/Pd) A β- 1 ,6-D-glucan starting material A containing a C- 1 hydroxyl is reacted with a sutibly mono protected bis-alkyl under conditions of reductive amination to afford a compound comprising, e.g., an amino alkyl (e.g., where an aliphatic bis amine is used). In correspondence with scheme IV this reaction gives a β- 1 ,6-D-glucan N' that is reduced by one D-glucopyranose unit, wherein the terminal reducing D- glucopyranose unit has been transformed into a 1 -amino- 1 -desoxy-D-glucitol. In cases where the product is a secondary amine, that intermediate may be further transformed by reductive alkylation with an alkyl or aryl aldehyde to give a trisubstituted amine O'. The resulting product has the composition (la) wherein R is (2R,3R,4R,5RS)-2,3,4,5-tetrahydroxy-6-(N-alkyl-N-(protected amino-substituted alkyl))hexyl. Subsequent removal of the protecting group provides the product O" wherein R is (2R,3R,4R,5RS)- 2,3,4,5-tetrahydroxy-6-(N-alkyl-N-(amino-substituted alkyl))hexyl. In another embodiment, the molecules of the present invention are prepared as shown Scheme VII Reagents and Conditions: a) H2NOalkyl or H2NOaryl; b) NaCNBH3; c) CH20 or alkylCHO or arylCHO, NaBH3CN, A β- 1 ,6-D-glucan starting material A containing a C- 1 hydroxyl is reacted with an alkyloxyamine to form an oxime P. The oxime is reduced to an amine Q, and the amine is alkylated under conditions of reductive alkylation with an alkyl or aryl aldehyde to give a trisubstituted amine R. The reduced oximes of Scheme VII are novel compositions of matter. [0088] In another embodiment of the present invention is shown in Scheme VIII. Scheme VI II pustulan n = 1 -18 (e.g., n = 2-18) Reagents and Conditions: a) TfOH, HOalkyl, heat; b) size exclusion chromatography This scheme expands the scope of synthesis of O-alkyl glycosides of β-Ι,ό-D-glucan from other synthetic methods [Hattori, T. et al. Carbohydrate Res. 366, 6-16, 2013]. Scheme VIII employs the reaction of pustulan with an alkyl alcohol and triflic acid to produce a mixture of 3- to 20-mer O-alkyl glycosides, in which the configuration at the anomeric carbon is largely a. This mixture is separated into the individual oligomeric P-l,6-D-glucan-a-0-alkyl glycosides (la). The a-methoxy compositions of scheme VII are novel. [0089] In another embodiment of the present invention as shown in Scheme IX the molecules of the present invention (lb) contain a substituted thio group at C- 1.

In one embodiment of this scheme, a β- 1 ,6-D-glucan starting material A containing a C- 1 hydroxyl is reacted with acetic anhydride/sodium acetate to produce a per-acetylated glycoside as in scheme II. This intermediate B is reacted with an alkylthiol, substituted alkylthiol, alkenylthiol, alkynylthiol, alkylenethiol, alkynylene thiol, arylthiol, or heteroarylthiol and a Lewis acid catalyst to produce an acetylated P- l,6-D-glucan thioglycoside S. This material is reacted with NaOMe/MeOH to give T, wherein R is alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, alkylene, alkynylene, aryl or heteroaryl. In some embodiments, R is unsubstituted. In other embodiments, R is substituted. [0090] In one embodiment of Scheme IX ethane thiol is used to react with the per-acetylated glycoside in the presence of boron trifluoride diethyl etherate to give a per-acetylated ethylthioglycoside. Hydrolysis of this product gives a compound (lb) wherein R is ethyl. Compounds of this structure are novel compositions of matter. [0091] In a variation of this scheme, the target β- Ι ,ό-D-glucan thioglycoside, having β as the predominant stereochemistry at the anomeric center is formed directly from the reaction of a β- 1 ,6-D- glucan with an aryl or heteroaryl thiol and 2-chloro- l ,3-dimethylimidazolium chloride [Tanaka, T. et al , Chem. Lett. 38, 458-459, 2009]. The arylthio- and heteroarylthioglycosides of the β- Ι ,ό-D-glucan 3-mer to 20-mer are novel compositions of matter. In another embodiment of the present invention as shown in Scheme X the molecules of the present invention (lb) contain an alkyl or aryl thio group at C- 1. Reaction of pustulan with an alkyl or aryl thiol and acid produces a mixture of oligomeric β- 1 ,6-D-glucan thioglycosides, which are separated into individual compounds with size exclusion chromatography. Scheme X pustulan n = 1 -18 (e.g., 2-18) Reagents and Conditions: a) TfOH, HSalkyl or HSaryl, heat; b) size exclusion chromatography [0092] In another embodiment of the present invention as shown in Scheme XI composition (la) wherein R is alkyl is selectively oxidized to give an acid of composition (Ic). (Ia) (Ic) n = 1 =18 Reagents and Conditions: a) TEMPO, NaHC03, Ca(OCI)2, i-BuOCI [0093] In another embodiment of the present invention as shown in Scheme XII composition (la) wherein R is alkyl is selectively oxidized to give an aldehyde of composition (Id). TEMPO has been used to oxidize methyl glycosides of unprotected mono-saccharides to give unprotected dialdo-glycosides [Angelin, M. et al. Eur. J. Org. Chem. 4323-4326, 2006]. The aldehydes of formula (Id) wherein R is methyl are novel compositions of matter.

The resulting mixture was stirred vigorously at room temperature (23 °C) for 1.75h, during which time the mixture thinned out noticeably. At the end of the stirring time a fine, black slurry remained in the flask. The mixture was transferred to a beaker containing 427 mL «-propanol to induce precipitation. The mixture was transferred to centrifuge tubes and the solid material was separated from the liquid by centrifugation lOOOxg, 5 min). The supernatant (containing HC1 salts and lower order sugars) was decanted to provide light brown pellets. The pellets were washed successively with ethanol (2 x 10 mL) and n-propanol (1 x 10 mL) to remove traces of lower order sugars (mono- and di-saccharides). Water (3.0 mL per tube) was then added to each tube (partial solubility) and the subsequent mixtures were stirred overnight (stir plate) at room temperature. Centrifugation of the tubes yielded dark brown pellets (precipitation of unreacted polymeric material) and clear supematants. Pooling of the supematants and freeze-drying yielded the target mixture of β-Ι,ό-D- glucans as a tan powder (2.673 g, 44% by mass). Size range: 1- to 20-mer ; with the bulk of material in the 3- to 8-mer range (as determined by LC/MS-ELSD analysis). Example 2 [0096] HILIC method of purification - The oligosaccharide was dissolved in either minimal amounts of water or DMSO. The sample was introduced to a Waters Xbridge Amide 5μηι column (19 x 250mm). The purified oligosaccharide was eluted from the column utilizing a gradient of 80% acetonitrile w/ 0.1% triethylamine:20%water w/ 0.1% triethylamine to 35% acetonitrile w/ 0.1% triethylamine:65%water w/ 0.1% triethylamine. Alternatively, 0.1% ammonium hydroxide was utilized in place of triethylamine. This method was useful in isolating individual β-Ι,ό-glucan oligomers containing from 1 to 20 D-glucose units. [0097] In addition to the 3-mer to 9-mer β-Ι,ό-D-glucan oligomers, there were obtained the following compounds: (formula 2) 2a. a 10-mer (n = 8), [0-P-D-glucopyranosyl-l,6-]9-D-glucose: m/z = 1639 (M+H+), 1657 (M+NH4+), 1662 (M+Na+); 2b. an 11-mer (n = 9), [O-P-D-glucopyranosyl-l,6-]10-D-glucose: m/z = 1802 (M+H+), 1819 (M+NH4+), 1824 (M+Na+); 2c. a 12-mer (n = 10), [0-P-D-glucopyranosyl-l,6-]n-D-glucose: m/z = 1964 (M+H+), 1981 (M+NH4+), 1986 (M+Na+); 2d. a 13-mer (n = 11), [0-P-D-glucopyranosyl-l,6-]i2-D-glucose: m/z = 2126 (M+H+), 2148 (M+Na+); 2e. a 14-mer (n = 12), [0-P-D-glucopyranosyl-l,6-]13-D-glucose: m/z = 2288 (M+H+), 2310 (M+Na+); 2f. a 15-mer (n = 13), [0-P-D-glucopyranosyl-l,6-]i4-D-glucose: m/z = 2450 (M+H+), 2472 (M+Na+); 2g. a 16-mer (n = 14), [0-P-D-glucopyranosyl-l,6-]i5-D-glucose: m/z = 261 1 (M+H+), 2633 (M+Na+); 2h. a 17-mer (n = 15), [0-P-D-glucopyranosyl- l,6-]i6-D-glucose: m/z = 2774 (M+H ), 2796 (M+Na+); 2i. an 18-mer (n = 16), [0-P-D-glucopyranosyl- l ,6-]i7-D-glucose: m/z = 2936 (M+H+), 2958 (M+Na+); 2j. a 19-mer (n = 17), [0-P-D-glucopyranosyl- l,6-]18-D-glucose: m/z = 3098 (M+H+), 3120 (M+Na+); and 2k. a 20-mer (n = 18), [0-P-D-glucopyranosyl- l,6-]i9-D-glucose: m/z = 3260 (M+H+), 3282 (M+Na+). Example 3 Separation of oligosaccharides by SEC [0098] Separations were carried out using a P2 resin (Bio-rad) in which fines had been removed. The resin was packed onto two 1 -meter XK 50/100 columns (GE Healthcare) connected in series, such that the bottom of column 1 was connected to the top of column 2. Separations were achieved isocratically with an Agilent 1 100 HPLC system, using 0.1 M acetic acid as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 3.5 mL/min. Samples were injected at the top of column 1 and eluted materials were collected at the bottom of column 2 using a fraction collector. Sample size ranged from 5- 13 mL with concentrations from 0.1 to 0.2 g/mL. Fractions were analyzed using a MALDI-TOF 4800 (ABSciex) using 4'- hydroxyazobenzene-2-carboxylic acid (Sigma- Aldrich) as the matrix in reflectron positive mode. [0099] The separations were performed using one of two procedures: in the first procedure, a sample was injected at the top of column 1 and fractions were collected as they eluted from the end column 2. In this method, the mobile phase was pumped from a reservoir containing OA M acetic acid. Using the first procedure, carbohydrates from nine units to one unit in length were resolved and were purified. In the second procedure, initially, columns were connected in a loop, so the mobile phase that eluted from the bottom of column 2 was used to feed the top of column 1. Injected samples were run in this looped arrangement to extend the length of column. After the injected sample had passed through the second column once, the loop was opened and column 1 was fed from a reservoir containing OA M acetic acid. Subsequently, fractions were collected as they elute from the bottom of column 2. The second procedure permitted the resolution and isolation of carbohydrates from eleven units to one unit in length. Example 4 Methanolysis of pustulan pustulan (formula 3); n = 1-18 (e.g., 2-18) [0100] A solution of pustulan (1.4 g, 0.038 mmol) in MeOH (6.1 mL) and DMSO (37.8 mL) was treated with TfOH (47.0 μΐ., 14 equiv). The reaction mixture was warmed to 80°C. After 6 h, TLC analysis showed conversion of the pustulan to a ladder of oligomers ranging from 3-mer and higher. The products were precipitated out with acetonitrile (300 mL) and a pellet formed via centrifugation (3000 rpm x 5 min). The supernatant was removed and the pellet was suspended in water (10 mL) and was warmed to 50°C to obtain solution. The mixture was then centrifuged (3000 rpm x 5 min) and the supernatant was separated from the pellet. This solution was purified by P2 SEC. Example 5 Preparation of methyl [0-P-D-glucopyranosyl-l,6]5-D-glucopyranoside (formula 4) [0101] The oligosaccharide mixture from Example 4 is dissolved in either minimal amounts of water or DMSO. The sample is introduced to the Waters Xbridge Amide 5 μηι column (19 x 250mm). The purified oligosaccharide is eluted from the column utilizing a gradient of 80% Acetonitrile w/ 0.1% triethylamine:20%water w/ 0.1% triethylamine to 35% Acetonitrile w/ 0.1% triethylamine:65%water w/ 0.1% triethylamine. Alternatively, 0.1% ammonium hydroxide may be utilized in place of triethyl amine. The individual oligomeric β-Ι,ό-D-glucans appeared as pairs of a- and β-OMe anomers with the a- anomer as the predominant isomer. The title compound is obtained by evaporation of the appropriate eluent. m/z = 1005 (M+H+), 1022 (M+NH4+), 1027 (M+Na+). [0102] Similarly prepared by the method of Example 4 were: a.

Example 11 Per-acetyl n = 1 -6 [0112] Into a microwave reaction vial was placed a mixture of β-Ι,ό-D-glucan oligosaccharides (177 mg, grey powder, size range ~3-8). To this was added acetic anhydride (1.0 mL, 10.6 mmol) and sodium acetate (97 mg, 1.2 mmol). The mixture was treated to microwave irradiation (CEM Discover) at 125°C (200 W) for the following time cycles: 10 min, 4 x 5 min. Additional portions of acetic anhydride (500 μί) and sodium acetate (2 x 50 mg) were added after cycles 1 and 3, and 4 and 5, respectively. Analysis by LC/MS was conducted on an aliquot of the reaction mixture after each cycle to assay the extent of acetylation. Additional cycles of microwave irradiation were applied, as necessary, until full conversion was achieved, as indicated by LC/MS. [0113] At the end of the reaction, the mixture was filtered off on a Hirsch funnel, solids rinsed with ethyl acetate, and the filtrate concentrated in vacuo to yield a brown oil. The oil was taken up in ethyl acetate (20 mL) followed by washing with water and brine (10 and 5 mL, resp.), was dried (MgSO/t), was filtered and was concentrated in vacuo to give the crude product as a light brown foam.
