Intermediate 5: 4-(cycloheptylamino)-2-(methylsulfanyl)pyrimidine-5-carbaldehyde
A suspension of ethyl 4-chloro-2-(methylsulfanyl)pyrimidine-5-carboxylate (CAS#5909-24-0, 16 g, 68.7 mmol), cycloheptylamine (9.34 g, 82.5 mmol) and DIPEA (17.8 g, 138 mmol) in THF (150 mL) was stirred at room temperature for 18 h. Solvents were evaporated, the residue dissolved in water (150 mL), and the solution extracted with EtOAc (150 mL×2). The combined organics were washed with sat. aq NaCl (150 mL×2), dried over sodium sulfate, and concentrated to give ethyl 4-(cycloheptylamino)-2-(methylsulfanyl)pyrimidine-5-carboxylate (5a, 21 g, 99%) as yellow oil. MS: 310 [M+H]+.
