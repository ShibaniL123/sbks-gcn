rac-(2R,3R,4R,5R)-3-(tert-butyl)-1-(cyclohexanecarbonyl)-N-((2-methoxyethyl)sulfonyl)-4-((6-methyl-4-(trifluoromethyl)pyridin-2-yl)amino)-5-phenylpyrrolidine-2-carboxamide
A 4 mL vial was charged with a stir bar, a solution of rac-(2R,3R,4R,5R)-3-(tert-butyl)-1-(cyclohexanecarbonyl)-4-((6-methyl-4-(trifluoromethyl)pyridin-2-yl)amino)-5-phenylpyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid (20.0 mg, 0.04 mmol) in dichloroethane and a solution of 1,1'-carbonyldiimidazole (CDI, 13.5 mg, 2.22 eq, 0.08 mmol) in dichloroethane. The vial was capped and placed to stir at 42° C. for 4 hours. To the mixture a solution of 2-methoxyethanesulfonamide (15.7 mg, 3 eq, 0.112 mmol) in dichloroethane and 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU, 17.0 μL, 3 eq, 0.112 mmol) was added and the vial was capped. The vial was placed to stir at 50° C. for another 2 hours. Upon completion the compound was concentrated to dryness and redissolved in 1400 μL of dimethyl sulfoxide/methanol (1:1 v/v). The mixture was purified using reverse phase HPLC to obtain rac-(2R,3R,4R,5R)-3-(tert-butyl)-1-(cyclohexanecarbonyl)-N-((2-methoxyethyl)sulfonyl)-4-((6-methyl-4-(trifluoromethyl)pyridin-2-yl)amino)-5-phenylpyrrolidine-2-carboxamide (8.3 mg, 33.8% isolated yield).
