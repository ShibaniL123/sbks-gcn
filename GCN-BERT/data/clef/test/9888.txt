BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE Field of the Disclosure The disclosure relates to covering devices and more particularly pertains to a new covering device for covering a shoe while driving to prevent scuffing or other damage to the shoe. SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE An embodiment of the disclosure meets the needs presented above by generally comprising a base wall and a perimeter wall coupled to and extending from a front section of the base wall. The perimeter wall and the front section of the base wall define a front cup for receiving and extending over a front portion of a shoe. An arcuate sidewall is coupled to a rear section of the base wall defining a heel cup for receiving and extending around a heel portion of the shoe. The front cup, the heel cup, and a medial section of the base wall define a cover. A strap extends from the cover for coupling the cover to the shoe such that the base wall extends along a sole of the shoe. There has thus been outlined, rather broadly, the more important features of the disclosure in order that the detailed description thereof that follows may be better understood, and in order that the present contribution to the art may be better appreciated. There are additional features of the disclosure that will be described hereinafter and which will form the subject matter of the claims appended hereto. The objects of the disclosure, along with the various features of novelty which characterize the disclosure, are pointed out with particularity in the claims annexed to and forming a part of this disclosure. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS The disclosure will be better understood and objects other than those set forth above will become apparent when consideration is given to the following detailed description thereof. Such description makes reference to the annexed drawings wherein: FIG. 1 is a top front side perspective view of a shoe protecting cover device according to an embodiment of the disclosure. FIG. 2 is a bottom view of an embodiment of the disclosure. FIG. 3 is a top front side perspective view of an embodiment of the disclosure in an unsecured position on a shoe. FIG. 4 is a top side perspective view of an embodiment of the disclosure in use. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT With reference now to the drawings, and in particular to FIGS. 1 through 4 thereof, a new covering device embodying the principles and concepts of an embodiment of the disclosure and generally designated by the reference numeral 10 will be described. As best illustrated in FIGS. 1 through 4, the shoe protecting cover device 10 generally comprises a base wall 12 having a front section 14, a rear section 16, and a medial section 18 extending between the front section 14 and the rear section 16. An outer side 20 of the front section 14 of the base wall 12 has a length greater than a length of an inner side 22 of the front section 14 of the base wall 12. Each of a plurality of ridges 24 extends into a bottom surface 26 of the base wall 12. The ridges 24 are arranged into a front array 28 positioned on the front section 14 of the base wall 12 and a heel array 30 positioned on the rear section 16 of the base wall 12. The ridges 24 of each of the front array 28 and the heel array 30 respectively are concentrically spaced. A perimeter wall 32 is coupled to and extends from the front section 14. The perimeter wall 32 and the front section 14 of the base wall 12 define a front cup 34 having a closed front end 36 and an open back end 38 wherein the front cup 34 is configured for receiving and extending over a front portion 40 of a shoe 42. The front cup 34 is configured to cover a substantial amount of the shoe 42 to prevent scuffing of the shoe 42 while operating the pedals of a vehicle. An arcuate sidewall 44 is coupled to and extends upwardly from the rear section 16 of the base wall 12. The sidewall 44 and the rear section 16 of the base wall 12 define a heel cup 46 configured for receiving and extending around a heel portion 48 of the shoe 42. Together, the front cup 34, the heel cup 46, and the medial section 18 of the base wall 12 define a cover 50. An outer surface 52 of the cover 50 may comprise a durable synthetic material such as synthetic leather or the like. An inner surface 54 of the cover 50, particularly of portions abutting an outer surface of an upper of the shoe 42, may comprise a soft leather material, felt, or the like. A strap 56 is coupled to and extends from the cover 50 and may extend more particularly from the medial section 18 of the base wall 12, wherein the cover 50 is configured for coupling to the shoe 42 such that the base wall 12 extends along a sole 58 of the shoe 42. A loop 60 is coupled to a first end 62 of the strap 56. A second end 64 of the strap 56 is insertable through the loop 60. A fastener 66, such as hook and loop fastener, a snap, or the like, is coupled to the strap 56 wherein the second end 64 of the strap 56 is securable to a medial portion 68 of the strap 56 securing the cover 50 to the shoe 42. The medial section 18 of the base wall 12 may be angled relative to the front section 14 and the back section 16 such that the medial section 18 extends rearwardy and laterally across the shoe 42 from the front section 14 towards the rear section 16 when the cover 50 is coupled to the shoe 42. More particularly, the medial section 18 of the base wall 12 may extend from an outer side 70 of the cover 50 to an inner side 72 of the cover 50 relative to the shoe 42 as the medial section 18 extends rearwardly from the front section 14 of the base wall 12. In use, the cover 50 is positioned over the shoe 42 and secured using the strap 56 to hold the cover 50 over the shoe 42 while driving a vehicle. A single device 10 may be provided or a complementary pair may be provided to permit covering of a pair of shoes. With respect to the above description then, it is to be realized that the optimum dimensional relationships for the parts of an embodiment enabled by the disclosure, to include variations in size, materials, shape, form, function and manner of operation, assembly and use, are deemed readily apparent and obvious to one skilled in the art, and all equivalent relationships to those illustrated in the drawings and described in the specification are intended to be encompassed by an embodiment of the disclosure. Therefore, the foregoing is considered as illustrative only of the principles of the disclosure. Further, since numerous modifications and changes will readily occur to those skilled in the art, it is not desired to limit the disclosure to the exact construction and operation shown and described, and accordingly, all suitable modifications and equivalents may be resorted to, falling within the scope of the disclosure.
