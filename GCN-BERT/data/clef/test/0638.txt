BACKGROUND Skin aging is a progressive phenomenon, occurs over time and can be affected by lifestyle factors, such as alcohol consumption, tobacco and sun exposure. Aging of the facial skin can be characterized by atrophy, slackening, and fattening. Atrophy corresponds to a massive reduction of the thickness of skin tissue. Slackening of the subcutaneous tissues leads to an excess of skin and ptosis and leads to the appearance of drooping cheeks and eye lids. Fattening refers to an increase in excess weight by swelling of the bottom of the face and neck. These changes are typically associated with dryness, loss of elasticity, and rough texture. Hyaluronan, also known as hyaluronic acid (HA) is a non-sulfated glycosaminoglycan that is distributed widely throughout the human body in connective, epithelial, and neural tissues. Hyaluronan is abundant in the different layers of the skin, where it has multiple functions such as, e.g., to ensure good hydration, to assist in the organization of the extracellular matrix, to act as a filler material; and to participate in tissue repair mechanisms. However, with age, the quantity of hyaluronan, collagen, elastin, and other matrix polymers present in the skin decreases. For example, repeated exposed to ultra violet light, e.g., from the sun, causes dermal cells to both decrease their production of hyaluronan as well as increase the rate of its degradation. This hyaluronan loss results in various skin conditions such as, e.g., imperfects, defects, diseases and/or disorders, and the like. For instance, there is a strong correlation between the water content in the skin and levels of hyaluronan in the dermal tissue. As skin ages, the amount and quality of hyaluronan in the skin is reduced. These changes lead to drying and wrinkling of the skin. Dermal fillers are useful in treating soft tissue condition and in other skin therapies because the fillers can replace lost endogenous matrix polymers, or enhance/facilitate the function of existing matrix polymers, in order to treat these skin conditions. In the past, such compositions have been used in cosmetic applications to fill wrinkles, lines, folds, scars, and to enhance dermal tissue, such as, e.g., to plump thin lips, or fill-in sunken eyes or shallow cheeks. One common matrix polymer used in dermal filler compositions is hyaluronan. Because hyaluronan is natural to the human body, it is a generally well tolerated and a fairly low risk treatment for a wide variety of skin conditions. Originally, compositions comprising hyaluronan where made from naturally-occurring polymers, which exist in an uncrosslinked state. Although exhibiting excellent biocompatibility and affinity for water molecules, naturally-occurring hyaluronan exhibits poor biomechanical properties as a dermal filler. Tezel and Fredrickson, The Science of Hyaluronic Acid Dermal Fillers, J. Cosmet. Laser Ther. 10(1): 35-42 (2008); Kablik, et al., Comparative Physical Properties of Hyaluronic Acid Dermal Fillers, Dermatol. Surg. 35 Suppl 1: 302-312 (2009); Beasley, et al., Hyaluronic Acid Fillers: A Comprehensive Review, Facial Plast. Surg. 25(2): 86-94 (2009); each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. One primary reason is that because this polymer is uncrosslinked, it is highly soluble and, as such, is cleared rapidly when administered into a skin region. Tezel, supra, 2008; Kablik, supra, 2009; Beasley, supra, 2009. This in vivo clearance is primarily achieved by rapid degradation of the polymers, principally enzymatic degradation via hyaluronidase and chemical degradation via free-radicals. Thus, while still in commercial use, compositions comprising uncrosslinked hyaluronan polymers tend to degrade within a few days after administration and thus require fairly frequent reinjection to maintain their skin improving effect. To minimize the effect of these in vivo degradation pathways, matrix polymers are crosslinked to one another to form a stabilized hydrogel. Because hydrogels comprising crosslinked matrix polymers are a more solid substance, dermal fillers comprising such hydrogels remain in place at the implant site longer. Tezel, supra, 2008; Kablik, supra, 2009; Beasley, supra, 2009. In addition, these hydrogels are more suitable as a dermal filler because it's more solid nature improves the mechanical properties of the filler, allowing the filler to better lift and fill a skin region. Tezel, supra, 2008; Kablik, supra, 2009; Beasley, supra, 2009. Hyaluronan polymers are typically crosslinked with a crosslinking agent to form covalent bonds between hyaluronan polymers. Such crosslinked polymers form a less water soluble hydrogel network that is more resistant to degradation, and thus requires less frequent reinjection, than the non-crosslinked hyaluronan compositions. Current dermal fillers can be associated with a variety of side effects. For example, administration of a dermal filler to an individual is typically performed using a syringe or needle. Such administration could result in one or more unwanted side-effects, such as, e.g., pain and discomfort to the individual, bleeding in and under the site of administration, and itching, inflammation and irritation in the vicinity of the administration site during and after the administration of the dermal filler. The dermal fillers disclosed in the present specification address these and other unwanted side-effects by providing hydrogel compositions comprising agents that reduce, step, or prevent one or more of these side-effects. Additionally, a dermal filler formulation must be capable of withstanding sterilization which is a strict requirement before the product can be sold (the product must be sterile). Sterilization can be carried out by steam sterilization, filtration, microfiltration, gamma radiation, ETO light or by a combination of these methods. It is known that a dermal filler can be steam sterilized (autoclaved) without substantial degradation of physical properties, but when a dermal filler formulation contains an additional labile ingredient (such as an antioxidant, anti-itch agent, an anti-cellulite agent, an anti-scarring agent, an anti-inflammatory agent, an anesthetic agent, an anti-irritant agent, a vasoconstrictor, a vasodilator, an anti-hemorrhagic agent like a hemostatic agent or anti-fibrinolytic agent, a desquamating agent, a tensioning agent, an anti-acne agent, a pigmentation agent, an anti-pigmentation agent, or a moisturizing agent) the entire dermal filler formulation or at least the additional (heat labile) agent is traditionally sterilized by a non-heat treatment such as by a filtration sterilization method. Thus, a known dermal filler product (REVITACARE® Bio-Revitalisation, REVITACARE® Laboratory, Saint-Ouen-l'Aumône, France) is sold in two separate vials or containers, one vial containing the HA (which is autoclave sterilized)) and the second vial containing any additional ingredients (the second vial contents are sterilized by filtration). Another known dermal filler product NCTF® 135HA (Laboratoires Filorga, Paris, France) is sold in a single container holding both hyaluronan and any additional ingredients, all having been sterilized by microfiltration. The dermal fillers disclosed in the present specification addresses this issue by developing dermal fillers that are entirely sterilized by a heat treatment, i.e., in some embodiments of this invention, none of the components are sterilized solely using a non-heat treatment such as, e.g., filtration. SUMMARY The present specification provides novel dermal fillers useful for treating skin conditions that remain stable after a heat treatment used to sterilize the compositions. One aspect of the disclosed dermal fillers, and a significant distinction over known dermal fillers, is that dermal fillers disclosed herein are prepared by: 1) mixing glycosaminoglycan polymers and the additional agents(s) disclosed herein, and then; (2) heat treating the dermal filler composition to at least 100° C. (no filtration sterilization of any component); (3) where such treatment maintains the desired properties of the hydrogel compositions. The disclosed hydrogel compositions do not exhibit any significant degradation as shown by pre and post autoclaved testing. The disclosed hydrogel compositions are substantially heat stable as determined by the retention of one or more of the following characteristics after sterilization: clarity (transparency and translucency), homogeneousness, extrusion force, cohesiveness, hyaluronan concentration, agent(s) concentration, osmolarity, pH, or other rheological characteristics desired by the hydrogel before the heat treatment. The hydrogel compositions disclosed herein can also exhibit greater stability than a hydrogel composition without the additional constituent. Without wishing to be bound by theory it may be that the hydrogel matrix of the cross-linked glycosaminoglycan polymers used in our formulation sequesters, renders non-reactive and thereby prevents the additional ingredient (as set forth in Examples following) from degrading and causes degradation of the dermal filler formulation during steam sterilization. Additionally, the additional ingredient can be hydrophilic and provides protection to the glycosaminoglycan polymers from degradation during steam sterilization and/or after administration of the dermal filler formulation to a patient. Without wishing to be bound by theory, the incorporation of an additional ingredient in the dermal filler formulation may inhibit free-radical scavenging at the injection/implant site, thereby prolonging dermal filler duration after patient administration. After steam sterilization, the additional ingredient can, upon administration (as by subdermal injection), be released from the dermal filler formulation for cosmetic or therapeutic effect. Thus, aspects of the present specification provide a hydrogel composition comprising a glycosaminoglycan polymer and at least one agent selected from an antioxidant, an anti-itch agent, an anti-cellulite agent, an anti-scarring agent, an anti-inflammatory agent, an anesthetic agent, an anti-irritant agent, a vasoconstrictor, a vasodilator, an anti-hemorrhagic agent like a hemostatic agent or anti-fibrinolytic agent, a desquamating agent, a tensioning agent, an anti-acne agent, a pigmentation agent, an anti-pigmentation agent, or a moisturizing agent. Glycosaminoglycan polymers useful to make such compositions include, without limitation, chondroitin sulfate polymers, dermatan sulfate polymers, keratan sulfate polymers, and hyaluronan polymers. Other aspects of the present specification provide a method of preparing a hydrogel composition disclosed herein, the method comprising a) mixing the glycosaminoglycan polymer and the at least one agent; and b) heat treating the mixture; wherein the heat treatment maintains the desired hydrogel properties disclosed herein. Yet other aspects of the present specification provide a method of treating a skin condition in an individual in need thereof, the method comprising the steps of administering a hydrogel composition disclosed herein into a dermal region of the individual, wherein the administration improves the skin condition. Skin conditions treated by the disclosed compositions include, without limitation, augmentations, reconstructions, diseases, disorders, defects, or imperfections of a body part, region or area.

A chondroitin sulfate polymer may also include D-glucuronic acid residues that are epimerized into L-iduronic acid (IdoA), in which case the resulting disaccharide is referred to as dermatan sulfate. A chondroitin sulfate polymer can have a chain of over 100 individual sugars, each of which can be sulfated in variable positions and quantities. Chondroitin sulfate polymers are an important structural component of cartilage and provide much of its resistance to compression. Any chondroitin sulfate polymer is useful in the compositions disclosed herein with the proviso that the chondroitin sulfate polymer improves a condition of the skin. Non-limiting examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts of chondroitin sulfate include sodium chondroitin sulfate, potassium chondroitin sulfate, magnesium chondroitin sulfate, calcium chondroitin sulfate, and combinations thereof.

Disaccharides within the repeating region of keratan sulfate may be fucosylated and N-Acetylneuraminic acid caps the end of the chains. Any keratan sulfate polymer is useful in the compositions disclosed herein with the proviso that the keratan sulfate polymer improves a condition of the skin. Non-limiting examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts of keratan sulfate include sodium keratan sulfate, potassium keratan sulfate, magnesium keratan sulfate, calcium keratan sulfate, and combinations thereof.

Hyaluronan polymers can be purified from animal and non-animal sources. Polymers of hyaluronan can range in size from about 5,000 Da to about 20,000,000 Da. Any hyaluronan polymer is useful in the compositions disclosed herein with the proviso that the hyaluronan improves a condition of the skin. Non-limiting examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts of hyaluronan include sodium hyaluronan, potassium hyaluronan, magnesium hyaluronan, calcium hyaluronan, and combinations thereof. Aspects of the present specification provide, in part, a hydrogel composition comprising a crosslinked glycosaminoglycan polymer. As used herein, the term “crosslinked” refers to the intermolecular bonds joining the individual polymer molecules, or monomer chains, into a more stable structure like a gel. As such, a crosslinked glycosaminoglycan polymer has at least one intermolecular bond joining at least one individual polymer molecule to another one. The crosslinking of glycosaminoglycan polymers typically result in the formation of a hydrogel. Such hydrogels have high viscosity and require considerable force to extrude through a fine needle.

The amount of an anti-oxidant agent included in a composition disclosed herein is an amount effective to reduce or prevent degradation of a composition disclosed herein, such as, e.g., enzymatic degradation and/or chemical degradation of the composition. As such, the amount of an anti-oxidant agent included in a composition disclosed herein is between about 0.1% to about 10% by weight of the total composition. Non-limiting examples of antioxidant agents include a polyol, a flavonoid, a phytoalexin, an ascorbic acid agent, a tocopherol, a tocotrienol, a lipoic acid, a melatonin, a carotenoid, an analog or derivative thereof, and any combination thereof. A composition disclosed herein may comprise a single antioxidant agent or a plurality of antioxidant agents, a retinol, coenzyme, idebenone, allopurinol, glutathione, sodium selenite. Aspects of the present specification provide, in part, a hydrogel composition disclosed herein that may optionally comprise a polyol. As used herein, the term “polyol” is synonymous with “sugar alcohol,” “polyhydric alcohol,” and “polyalcohol” and refers to a hydrogenated form of carbohydrate, whose carbonyl group (aldehyde or ketone, reducing sugar) has been reduced to a primary or secondary hydroxyl group (hence the alcohol), such as, e.g., mannitol from mannose, xylitol from xylose, and lactitol from lactulose. Polyols have the general formula H(HCHO)n+1H. Both monosaccharides and disaccharides can form polyols; however, polyols derived from disaccharides are not entirely hydrogenated because only one aldehyde group is available for reduction. Non-limiting examples of polyols include glycerol, erythritol, threitol, arabitol, erythritol, ribitol, xylitol, galactitol (or dulcitol), glucitol (or sorbitol), iditol, inositol, mannitol, isomalt, lactitol, maltitol, and polyglycitol. Other non-limiting examples of polyols can be found in, e.g., Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms and Drug Delivery Systems (Howard C. Ansel et al., eds., Lippincott Williams & Wilkins Publishers, 7th ed. 1999); Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy (Alfonso R. Gennaro ed., Lippincott, Williams & Wilkins, 20th ed. 2000); Goodman & Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics (Joel G. Hardman et al., eds., McGraw-Hill Professional, 10th ed. 2001); and Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients (Raymond C. Rowe et al., APhA Publications, 4th edition 2003), each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. Aspects of the present specification provide, in part, a hydrogel composition disclosed herein that may optionally comprise a flavonoid (Table 2). A flavonoid (or bioflavonoid) refers to the class of polyphenolic ketone-containing and non-ketone-containing secondary metabolites found in plants that are well known to have diverse beneficial biochemical and antioxidant effects. Non-limiting examples of flavonoids include C-methylated flavonoids, O-methylated flavonoids, isoflavonoids, neoflavonoids, flavonolignans, furanoflavonoids, pyranoflavonoids, methylenedioxyflavonoids, prenylated flavonoids, aurones, flavones, flavonols, flavanones, flavanonols, flavan-3-ols, flavan-4-ols, leucoanthocyanidin (flavan-3,4-diols), anthocyanidins, and tannins.

See for example, Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences Mac Publishing Company, Easton, Pa. 16th Edition 1980. Aurones are compounds derived from 2-benzylidene-1-benzofuran-3-one. Non-limiting examples of aurones include 4,5,6-trihydroxy-aurone, aureusidin, hispidol, leptosidin, maritimetin, and sulfuretin. Three major classes of ketone-containing flavonoids are flavones, compounds derived from 2-phenylchromen-4-one (2-phenyl-1,4-benzopyrone); isoflavones, compounds derived from 3-phenylchromen-4-one (3-phenyl-1,4-benzopyrone); and neoflavones, compounds derived from 4-phenylcoumarine (4-phenyl-1,2-benzopyrone)(Table 2). Flavones are themselves divided into four groups based on the presence or absence of 3-hydroxyl 2,3-dihydro functional groups: flavones, compounds derived from 2-phenylchromen-4-one lack both functional groups; flavonols (3-hydroxyflavone), compounds derived from 3-hydroxy-2-phenylchromen-4-one have the 3-hydroxyl group, but lack the 2,3-dihydro group; flavanones, compounds derived from 2,3-dihydro-2-phenylchromen-4-one have the 2,3-dihydro group, but lack the 3-hydroxyl group; and flavanonols (3-hydroxyflavanone or 2,3-dihydroflavonol), compounds derived from 3-hydroxy-2,3-dihydro-2-phenylchromen-4-one have both functional groups. Non-limiting examples of flavones include acacetin, apiin, apigenin, apigetrin, artoindonesianin P, baicalein, baicalin, chrysin, cynaroside, diosmetin, diosmin, eupatilin, flavoxate, 6-hydroxyflavone, genkwanin, hidrosmin, luteolin, nepetin, nepitrin (nepetin 7-glucoside), nobiletin, orientin (isoorientin), oroxindin, oroxylin A, rhoifolin, scutellarein, scutellarin, tangeritin, techtochrysin, tetuin, tricin, veronicastroside, vitexin (isovitexin), and wogonin.

Non-limiting examples of neoflavonoids include calophyllolide, coutareagenin, dalbergichromene, dalbergin, and nivetin. Non-ketone-containing flavonoids, include flavan-3-ols and catechins. Flavan-3-ols (flavanols) are a class of flavonoids derived from 2-phenyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-chromen-3-ol skeleton. Catechin possesses two benzene rings (called the A- and B-rings) and a dihydropyran heterocycle (the C-ring) with an hydroxyl group on carbon 3. The A ring is similar to a resorcinol moiety while the B ring is similar to a catechol moiety. There are two chiral centers on the molecule on carbons 2 and 3. It has therefore four diastereoisomers. Two of the isomers are in trans configuration and are called catechin and the other two are in cis configuration and are called epicatechin. Non-limiting examples of non-ketone-containing flavonoids include afzelechin, arthromerin A, arthromerin B, catechin, epicatechin, epigallocatechin, epicatechin gallate, epigallocatechin gallate, epigallocatechin gallate, epiafzelechin, fisetinidol, gallocatechin, gallocatechin gallate, guibourtinidol, meciadanol (3-O-methylcatechin), mesquitol, propyl gallate, robinetinidol, and thearubigin.

Tannins are compounds derived from 2-phenylchromenylium. There are three major classes of tannins: hydrolyzable tannins; non-hydrolyzable tannins (condensed tannins; proanthocyanidins); and pseudotannins. Hydrolyzable tannins are themselves divided into four groups: oligomer tannins including aglycone tannins and glycoside tannins; ellagitannins; gallotannins, and unclassified tannins.

A phytoalexin refers to the class of antimicrobial molecules with antioxidant effects synthesized de novo by plants in response to an incompatible pathogen infection. Non-limiting examples of phytoalexins include resveratrol (3,5,4′-trihydroxy-trans-stilbene), allixin (3-hydroxy-5-methoxy-6-methyl-2-pentyl-4H-pyran-4-one), glyceollin, phaseolin, and medicarpin. Aspects of the present specification provide, in part, a hydrogel composition disclosed herein that may optionally comprise an ascorbic acid agent. Ascorbic acid (Vitamin C), (5R)-[(1S)-1,2-dihydroxyethyl]-3,4-dihydroxyfuran-2(5H)-one, is a monosaccharide oxidation-reduction (redox) catalyst found in both animals and plants that reduces, and thereby neutralize, reactive oxygen species such as hydrogen peroxide. Ascorbic acid also interconverts into two unstable ketone tautomers by proton transfer, although it is the most stable in the enol form. The proton of the hydroxyl of the enol is removed. Then a pair of electrons from the resulting oxide anion pushes down to form the ketone at the 2 or 3 position and the electrons from the double bond move to the 3 or 2 position, respectively, forming the carbanion, which picks up the proton resulting in two possible forms: 1-carboxyl-2-ketone and 1-carboxyl-3-ketone. Non-limiting examples of ascorbic acid agents include ascorbic acid agents include ascorbic acid and sodium, potassium, and calcium salts of ascorbic acid, fat-soluble esters of ascorbic acid with long-chain fatty acids (ascorbyl palmitate or ascorbyl stearate), magnesium ascorbyl phosphate (MAP), sodium ascorbyl phosphate (SAP), and ascorbic acid 2-glucoside (AA2G™) disodium ascorbyl sulfate, vitagen. Aspects of the present specification provide, in part, a hydrogel composition disclosed herein that may optionally comprise a tocopherol and/or a tocotrienol. Tocopherols and tocotrienols comprise a group of antioxidant agents collectively referred to as Vitamin E. All feature a chromanol ring, with a hydroxyl group that can donate a hydrogen atom to reduce free radicals and a hydrophobic side chain which allows for penetration into biological membranes. Both the tocopherols and tocotrienols occur in alpha, beta, gamma and delta forms, determined by the number and position of methyl groups on the chromanol ring. The tocotrienols have the same methyl structure at the ring, but differ from the analogous tocopherols by the presence of three double bonds in the hydrophobic side chain. The unsaturation of the tails gives tocotrienols only a single stereoisomeric carbon (and thus two possible isomers per structural formula, one of which occurs naturally), whereas tocopherols have 3 centers (and eight possible stereoisomers per structural formula, one of which occurs naturally). In general, the unnatural 1-isomers of tocotrienols lack almost all vitamin activity, and half of the possible 8 isomers of the tocopherols (those with 2S chirality at the ring-tail junction) also lack vitamin activity. Of the stereoisomers which retain activity, increasing methylation, especially full methylation to the alpha-form, increases vitamin activity. Non-limiting examples of Vitamin E include tocopherols (like α-tocopherol, β-tocopherol, γ-tocopherol, and δ-tocopherol), tocopherols analogs and derivatives (like tocopheryl acetate, sodium tocopheryl phosphate (STP), polyoxyethanyl-α-tocopheryl sebacate, and tocopherol polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate (TPGS)), tocotrienols (like α-tocotrienol, β-tocotrienol, γ-tocotrienol, and δ-tocotrienol), tocotrienols analogs and derivatives. Aspects of the present specification provide, in part, a hydrogel composition disclosed herein that may optionally comprise a lipoic acid (LA). Lipoic acid, (R)-5-(1,2-dithiolan-3-yl)pentanoic acid, is an organosulfur compound derived from octanoic acid that contains two vicinal sulfur atoms (at C6 and C8) attached via a disulfide bond and is thus considered to be oxidized (although either sulfur atom can exist in higher oxidation states). The carbon atom at C6 is chiral and the molecule exists as two enantiomers R-(+)-lipoic acid (RLA) and S-(−)-lipoic acid (SLA) and as a racemic mixture R/S-lipoic acid (R/S-LA). Only the R-(+)-enantiomer exists in nature and is an essential cofactor of four mitochondrial enzyme complexes. Aspects of the present specification provide, in part, a hydrogel composition disclosed herein that may optionally comprise a melatonin. Melatonin, N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine, is a pervasive and powerful antioxidant found in animals, plants, and microbes. Aspects of the present specification provide, in part, a hydrogel composition disclosed herein that may optionally comprise a carotenoid. Carotenoids are tetraterpenoid organic pigments that are naturally occurring in the chloroplasts and chromoplasts of plants and some other photosynthetic organisms like algae, some types of fungus some bacteria and at least one species of aphid. Structurally, tetraterpenes are synthesized biochemically from eight isoprene units resulting in a 40 carbon skeleton that can be terminated by hydrocarbon rings. There are over 600 known carotenoids; they are split into two classes, xanthophylls (which contain oxygen) and carotenes (which are purely hydrocarbons, and contain no oxygen). Chemically, carotenes, including lycopenes, are polyunsaturated hydrocarbons containing 40 carbon atoms per molecule, variable numbers of hydrogen atoms, and no other elements. Some carotenes are terminated by hydrocarbon rings, on one or both ends of the molecule. Non-limiting examples of carotenes include α-carotene, β-carotene, γ-carotene, δ-carotene, ε-carotene, ζ-carotene, lycopene. Xanthophylls hydrocarbons containing 40 carbon atoms per molecule that either contains hydroxyl groups and/or pairs of hydrogen atoms that are substituted by oxygen atoms. For this reason they are more polar than the purely hydrocarbon carotenes. Some xanthophylls are terminated by hydrocarbon rings, on one or both ends of the molecule. Non-limiting examples of xanthophylls include lutein, zeaxanthin, neoxanthin, violaxanthin, α-cryptoxanthin, and β-cryptoxanthin. Aspects of the present specification provide, in part, a hydrogel composition disclosed herein that may optionally comprise a Vitamin A. Vitamin A includes retinol, retinal and retinoic acid and the different geometric isomers of retinol [(2E,4E,6E,8E)-3,7-dimethyl-9-(2,6,6-trimethylcyclohex-1-enyl)nona-2,4,6,8-tetraen-1-ol], retinal and retinoic acid resulting form either a trans or cis configuration of four of the five double bonds found in the polyene chain. Non-limiting examples of Vitamin A include retinol, retinal, retinoic acid, isomers of retinol, isomers of retinal, isomers of retinoic acid, tretinoin, isotretinoin, and retinyl palmitate.

Aspects of the present specification provide, in part, a hydrogel composition disclosed herein that may optionally comprise an antihemorrhagic agent. An antihemorrhagic agent includes hemostatic agents and antifibrinolytic agents. A hemostatic agent is a molecule that acts to reduce, stop, and/or prevent bleeding in the case of a ruptured blood vessel. One class of hemostatic agents is Vitamin K and its analogs or derivatives. Vitamin K and its 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone derivatives is a group of lipophilic, hydrophobic vitamins that are needed for the posttranslational modification of certain proteins, mostly required for blood coagulation but also involved in metabolism pathways in bone and other tissue. The function of vitamin K in the cell is to convert glutamate in proteins to gamma-carboxyglutamate (gla). An antifibrinolytic agent is a molecule that acts to promote blood clot formation. Antifibrinolytics include aminocaproic acid (ε-aminocaproic acid) and tranexamic acid. These lysine-like drugs interfere with the formation of the fibrinolytic enzyme plasmin from its precursor plasminogen by plasminogen activators (primarily t-PA and u-PA). These drugs reversible block the lysine-binding sites of the enzymes or plasminogen and thus stop plasmin formation thereby preventing fibrinolysis and the breakdown of a blood clot. The amount of an antihemorrhagic agent included in a composition disclosed herein is an amount effective to reduce, stop, and/or prevent bleeding experienced by an individual upon or after administration of the composition. Ethamsylate (dicynene/dicynone) is another hemostatic agent.

In another embodiment, a composition disclosed herein does not comprise an anesthetic agent. Aspects of the present specification provide, in part, a hydrogel composition disclosed herein that exhibits a complex modulus, an elastic modulus, a viscous modulus and/or a tan δ. The compositions as disclosed herein are viscoelastic in that the composition has an elastic component (solid-like such as, e.g., crosslinked glycosaminoglycan polymers) and a viscous component (liquid-like such as, e.g., uncrosslinked glycosaminoglycan polymers or a carrier phase) when a force is applied (stress, deformation). The rheological attribute that described this property is the complex modulus (G*), which defines a composition's total resistance to deformation. The complex modulus is a complex number with a real and imaginary part: G*=G′+iG″. The absolute value of G* is Abs(G*)=Sqrt(G′2+G″2). The complex modulus can be defined as the sum of the elastic modulus (G′) and the viscous modulus (G″). Falcone, et al., Temporary Polysaccharide Dermal Fillers: A Model for Persistence Based on Physical Properties, Dermatol Surg. 35(8): 1238-1243 (2009); Tezel, supra, 2008; Kablik, supra, 2009; Beasley, supra, 2009; each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. Elastic modulus, or modulus of elasticity, refers to the ability of a hydrogel material to resists deformation, or, conversely, an object's tendency to be non-permanently deformed when a force is applied to it. Elastic modulus characterizes the firmness of a composition and is also known as the storage modulus because it describes the storage of energy from the motion of the composition. The elastic modulus describes the interaction between elasticity and strength (G′=stress/strain) and, as such, provides a quantitative measurement of a composition's hardness or softness. The elastic modulus of an object is defined as the slope of its stress-strain curve in the elastic deformation region: A=stress/strain, where A is the elastic modulus in Pascal's; stress is the force causing the deformation divided by the area to which the force is applied; and strain is the ratio of the change caused by the stress to the original state of the object. Although depending on the speed at which the force is applied, a stiffer composition will have a higher elastic modulus and it will take a greater force to deform the material a given distance, such as, e.g., an injection. Specifying how stresses are to be measured, including directions, allows for many types of elastic moduli to be defined. The three primary elastic moduli are tensile modulus, shear modulus, and bulk modulus. Viscous modulus is also known as the loss modulus because it describes the energy that is lost as viscous dissipation. Tan δ is the ratio of the viscous modulus and the elastic modulus, tan δ=G″/G′. Falcone, supra, 2009. For tan δ values disclosed in the present specification, a tan δ is obtained from the dynamic modulus at a frequency of 1 Hz. A lower tan δ corresponds to a stiffer, harder, or more elastic composition. In another embodiment, a hydrogel composition disclosed herein exhibits an elastic modulus.

In another embodiment, a hydrogel composition disclosed herein exhibits a tan δ. In aspects of this embodiment, a hydrogel composition exhibits a tan δ of, e.g., about 0.1, about 0.2, about 0.3, about 0.4, about 0.5, about 0.6, about 0.7, about 0.8, about 0.9, about 1.0, about 1.1, about 1.2, about 1.3, about 1.4, about 1.5, about 1.6, about 1.7, about 1.8, about 1.9, about 2.0, about 2.1, about 2.2, about 2.3, about 2.4, or about 2.5. In other aspects of this embodiment, a hydrogel composition exhibits a tan δ of, e.g., at most 0.1, at most 0.2, at most 0.3, at most 0.4, at most 0.5, at most 0.6, at most 0.7, at most 0.8, at most 0.9, at most 1.0, at most 1.1, at most 1.2, at most 1.3, at most 1.4, at most 1.5, at most 1.6, at most 1.7, at most 1.8, at most 1.9, at most 2.0, at most 2.1, at most 2.2, at most 2.3, at most 2.4, or at most 2.5.

Aspects of the present specification provide, in part, a hydrogel composition disclosed herein having a transparency and/or translucency. Transparency (also called pellucidity or diaphaneity) is the physical property of allowing light to pass through a material, whereas translucency (also called translucence or translucidity) only allows light to pass through diffusely. The opposite property is opacity. Transparent materials are clear, while translucent ones cannot be seen through clearly. The silk fibroin hydrogels disclosed herein may, or may not, exhibit optical properties such as transparency and translucency. In certain cases, e.g., superficial line filling, it would be an advantage to have an opaque hydrogel. In other cases such as development of a lens or a “humor” for filling the eye, it would be an advantage to have a translucent hydrogel. These properties could be modified by affecting the structural distribution of the hydrogel material. Factors used to control a hydrogel's optical properties include, without limitation, polymer concentration, gel crystallinity, and hydrogel homogeneity. When light encounters a material, it can interact with it in several different ways. These interactions depend on the nature of the light (its wavelength, frequency, energy, etc.) and the nature of the material. Light waves interact with an object by some combination of reflection, and transmittance with refraction. As such, an optically transparent material allows much of the light that falls on it to be transmitted, with little light being reflected. Materials which do not allow the transmission of light are called optically opaque or simply opaque. In an embodiment, a hydrogel composition disclosed herein is optically transparent.

A hydrogel composition disclosed herein may be further processed by pulverizing the hydrogel into particles and optionally mixed with a carrier phase such as, e.g., water or a saline solution to form an injectable or topical substance like a solution, oil, lotion, gel, ointment, cream, slurry, salve, or paste. As such, the disclosed hydrogel compositions may be monophasic or multiphasic compositions. A hydrogel may be milled to a particle size from about 10 μm to about 1000 μm in diameter, such as about 15 μm to about 30 μm, about 50 μm to about 75 μm, about 100 μm to about 150 μm, about 200 μm to about 300 μm, about 450 μm to about 550 μm, about 600 μm to about 700 μm, about 750 μm to about 850 μm, or about 900 μm to about 1,000 μm. Aspects of the present specification provide, in part, a composition disclosed herein is injectable. As used herein, the term “injectable” refers to a material having the properties necessary to administer the composition into a skin region of an individual using an injection device with a fine needle. As used herein, the term “fine needle” refers to a needle that is 27 gauge or smaller. Injectability of a composition disclosed herein can be accomplished by sizing the hydrogel particles as discussed above. In aspect of this embodiment, a hydrogel composition disclosed herein is injectable through a fine needle. In other aspects of this embodiment, a hydrogel composition disclosed herein is injectable through a needle of, e.g., about 27 gauge, about 30 gauge, or about 32 gauge. In yet other aspects of this embodiment, a hydrogel composition disclosed herein is injectable through a needle of, e.g., 22 gauge or smaller, 27 gauge or smaller, 30 gauge or smaller, or 32 gauge or smaller. In still other aspects of this embodiment, a hydrogel composition disclosed herein is injectable through a needle of, e.g., about 22 gauge to about 35 gauge, 22 gauge to about 34 gauge, 22 gauge to about 33 gauge, 22 gauge to about 32 gauge, about 22 gauge to about 27 gauge, or about 27 gauge to about 32 gauge. In aspects of this embodiment, a hydrogel composition disclosed herein can be injected with an extrusion force of about 60 N, about 55 N, about 50 N, about 45 N, about 40 N, about 35 N, about 30 N, about 25 N, about 20 N, or about 15 N at speeds of 100 mm/min. In other aspects of this embodiment, a hydrogel composition disclosed herein can be injected through a 27 gauge needle with an extrusion force of about 60 N or less, about 55 N or less, about 50 N or less, about 45 N or less, about 40 N or less, about 35 N or less, about 30 N or less, about 25 N or less, about 20 N or less, about 15 N or less, about 10 N or less, or about 5 N or less.

Aspects of the present specification provide, in part, a hydrogel composition disclosed herein that exhibits cohesivity. Cohesivity, also referred to as cohesion cohesive attraction, cohesive force, or compression force is a physical property of a material, caused by the intermolecular attraction between like-molecules within the material that acts to unite the molecules. Cohesivity is expressed in terms of grams-force (gmf). Cohesiveness is affected by, among other factors, the molecular weight ratio of the initial free glycosaminoglycan polymer, the degree of crosslinking of glycosaminoglycan polymers, the amount of residual free glycosaminoglycan polymers following crosslinking, and the pH of the hydrogel composition. A composition should be sufficiently cohesive as to remain localized to a site of administration. Additionally, in certain applications, a sufficient cohesiveness is important for a composition to retain its shape, and thus functionality, in the event of mechanical load cycling. As such, in one embodiment, a hydrogel composition disclosed herein exhibits cohesivity, on par with water. In yet another embodiment, a hydrogel composition disclosed herein exhibits sufficient cohesivity to remain localized to a site of administration. In still another embodiment, a hydrogel composition disclosed herein exhibits sufficient cohesivity to retain its shape. In a further embodiment, a hydrogel composition disclosed herein exhibits sufficient cohesivity to retain its shape and functionality. Aspects of the present specification provide, in part, a hydrogel composition disclosed herein that exhibits a physiologically-acceptable osmolarity. As used herein, the term “osmolarity” refers to the concentration of osmotically active solutes in solution. As used herein, the term “a physiologically-acceptable osmolarity” refers to an osmolarity in accord with, or characteristic of, the normal functioning of a living organism. As such, administration of a hydrogel composition as disclosed herein exhibits an osmolarity that has substantially no long term or permanent detrimental effect when administered to a mammal. Osmolarity is expressed in terms of osmoles of osmotically active solute per liter of solvent (Osmol/L or Osm/L). Osmolarity is distinct from molarity because it measures moles of osmotically active solute particles rather than moles of solute. The distinction arises because some compounds can dissociate in solution, whereas others cannot. The osmolarity of a solution can be calculated from the following expression: Osmol/L=ΣφiηiCi, where φ is the osmotic coefficient, which accounts for the degree of non-ideality of the solution; η is the number of particles (e.g. ions) into which a molecule dissociates; and C is the molar concentration of the solute; and i is the index representing the identity of a particular solute. The osmolarity of a hydrogel composition disclosed herein can be measured using a conventional method that measures solutions. In an embodiment, a hydrogel composition disclosed herein exhibits a physiologically-acceptable osmolarity. In aspects of this embodiment, a hydrogel composition exhibits an osmolarity of, e.g., about 100 mOsm/L, about 150 mOsm/L, about 200 mOsm/L, about 250 mOsm/L, about 300 mOsm/L, about 350 mOsm/L, about 400 mOsm/L, about 450 mOsm/L, or about 500 mOsm/L. In other aspects of this embodiment, a hydrogel composition exhibits an osmolarity of, e.g., at least 100 mOsm/L, at least 150 mOsm/L, at least 200 mOsm/L, at least 250 mOsm/L, at least 300 mOsm/L, at least 350 mOsm/L, at least 400 mOsm/L, at least 450 mOsm/L, or at least 500 mOsm/L.

In still other aspects of this embodiment, a hydrogel composition exhibits an osmolarity of, e.g., about 100 mOsm/L to about 500 mOsm/L, about 200 mOsm/L to about 500 mOsm/L, about 200 mOsm/L to about 400 mOsm/L, about 300 mOsm/L to about 400 mOsm/L, about 270 mOsm/L to about 390 mOsm/L, about 225 mOsm/L to about 350 mOsm/L, about 250 mOsm/L to about 325 mOsm/L, about 275 mOsm/L to about 300 mOsm/L, or about 285 mOsm/L to about 290 mOsm/L. spects of the present specification provide, in part, a hydrogel composition disclosed herein that exhibits a physiologically-acceptable osmolality. As used herein, the term “osmolality” refers to the concentration of osmotically active solutes per kilo of solvent in the body. As used herein, the term “a physiologically-acceptable osmolality” refers to an osmolality in accord with, or characteristic of, the normal functioning of a living organism. As such, administration of a hydrogel composition disclosed herein exhibits an osmolality that has substantially no long term or permanent detrimental effect when administered to a mammal. Osmolality is expressed in terms of osmoles of osmotically active solute per kilogram of solvent (osmol/kg or Osm/kg) and is equal to the sum of the molalities of all the solutes present in that solution. The osmolality of a solution can be measured using an osmometer. The most commonly used instrument in modern laboratories is a freezing point depression osmometer. This instruments measure the change in freezing point that occurs in a solution with increasing osmolality (freezing point depression osmometer) or the change in vapor pressure that occurs in a solution with increasing osmolality (vapor pressure depression osmometer). In an embodiment, a hydrogel composition disclosed herein exhibits a physiologically-acceptable osmolality. In aspects of this embodiment, a hydrogel composition exhibits an osmolality of, e.g., about 100 mOsm/kg, about 150 mOsm/kg, about 200 mOsm/kg, about 250 mOsm/kg, about 300 mOsm/kg, about 350 mOsm/kg, about 400 mOsm/kg, about 450 mOsm/kg, or about 500 mOsm/kg.

In still other aspects of this embodiment, a hydrogel composition exhibits an osmolality of, e.g., about 100 mOsm/kg to about 500 mOsm/kg, about 200 mOsm/kg to about 500 mOsm/kg, about 200 mOsm/kg to about 400 mOsm/kg, about 300 mOsm/kg to about 400 mOsm/kg, about 270 mOsm/kg to about 390 mOsm/kg, about 225 mOsm/kg to about 350 mOsm/kg, about 250 mOsm/kg to about 325 mOsm/kg, about 275 mOsm/kg to about 300 mOsm/kg, or about 285 mOsm/kg to about 290 mOsm/kg. Aspects of the present specification provide, in part, a hydrogel composition disclosed herein that exhibits substantial stability. As used herein, the term “stability” or “stable” when referring to a hydrogel composition disclosed herein refers to a composition that is not prone to degrading, decomposing, or breaking down to any substantial or significant degree while stored before administration to an individual. As used herein, the term “substantial heat stability”, “substantially heat stable”, “autoclave stable”, or “steam sterilization stable” refers to a hydrogel composition disclosed herein that is substantially stable when subjected to a heat treatment as disclosed herein. Stability of a hydrogel composition disclosed herein can be determined by subjecting a hydrogel composition to a heat treatment, such as, e.g., steam sterilization at normal pressure or under pressure (e.g., autoclaving). Preferably the heat treatment is carried out at a temperature of at least about 100° C. for between about one minute and about 10 minutes. Substantial stability of a hydrogel composition disclosed herein can be evaluated 1) by determining the change in the extrusion force (ΔF) of a hydrogel composition disclosed herein after sterilization, where the change in extrusion force less 2N is indicative of a substantially stable hydrogel composition as measured by (the extrusion force of a hydrogel composition with the specified additives) minus (the extrusion force of the a hydrogel composition without the added additives); and/or 2) by determining the change in rheological properties of a hydrogel composition disclosed herein after sterilization, where the change in tan δ 1 Hz of less than 0.1 is indicative of a substantially stable hydrogel composition as measured by (tan δ 1 Hz of gel formulation with additives) minus (tan δ 1 Hz of gel formulation without additives). As such, a substantially stable hydrogel composition disclosed herein retains one or more of the following characteristics after sterilization: homogeneousness, extrusion force, cohesiveness, hyaluronan concentration, agent(s) concentration, osmolarity, pH, or other rheological characteristics desired by the hydrogel before the heat treatment. In an embodiment, a hydrogel composition comprising a glycosaminoglycan polymer and the at least one agent disclosed herein is processed using a heat treatment that maintains the desired hydrogel properties disclosed herein.

Long term stability of a hydrogel composition disclosed herein can be determined by subjecting a hydrogel composition to a heat treatment, such as, e.g., storage in an about 45° C. environment for about 60 days. Long term stability of a hydrogel composition disclosed herein can be evaluated 1) by assessing the clarity and color of a hydrogel composition after the 45° C. heat treatment, with a clear and uncolored hydrogel composition being indicative of a substantially stable hydrogel composition; 2) by determining the change in the extrusion force (ΔF) of a hydrogel composition disclosed herein after the 45° C. heat treatment, where the change in extrusion force less 2N is indicative of a substantially stable hydrogel composition as measured by (the extrusion force of a hydrogel composition with the specified additives before the 45° C. heat treatment) minus (the extrusion force of the a hydrogel composition with the specified additives after the 45° C. heat treatment); and/or 3) by determining the change in rheological properties of a hydrogel composition disclosed herein after sterilization, where the change in tan δ 1 Hz of less than 0.1 is indicative of a substantially stable hydrogel composition as measured by (tan δ 1 Hz of gel formulation with the specified additives before the 45° C. heat treatment) minus (tan δ 1 Hz of gel formulation with the specified additives after the 45° C. heat treatment). As such, a long term stability of a hydrogel composition disclosed herein is evaluated by retention of one or more of the following characteristics after the 45° C. heat treatment: clarity (transparency and translucency), homogeneousness, and cohesiveness. In aspects of this embodiment, a hydrogel composition is substantially stable at room temperature for, e.g., about 3 months, about 6 months, about 9 months, about 12 months, about 15 months, about 18 months, about 21 months, about 24 months, about 27 months, about 30 months, about 33 months, or about 36 months.

Aspects of the present specification provide, in part, a hydrogel composition disclosed herein that is a pharmaceutically-acceptable composition. As used herein, the term “pharmaceutically acceptable” means any molecular entity or composition that does not produce an adverse, allergic or other untoward or unwanted reaction when administered to an individual. A pharmaceutically-acceptable hydrogel composition is useful for medical and veterinary applications. A pharmaceutically-acceptable hydrogel composition may be administered to an individual alone, or in combination with other supplementary active ingredients, agents, drugs or hormones. Aspects of the present specification provide, in part, a hydrogel composition as disclosed herein comprising a pharmacologically acceptable excipient. As used herein, the term “pharmacologically acceptable excipient” is synonymous with “pharmacological excipient” or “excipient” and refers to any excipient that has substantially no long term or permanent detrimental effect when administered to mammal and encompasses compounds such as, e.g., stabilizing agent, a bulking agent, a cryo-protectant, a lyo-protectant, an additive, a vehicle, a carrier, a diluent, or an auxiliary. An excipient generally is mixed with an active ingredient, or permitted to dilute or enclose the active ingredient and can be a solid, semi-solid, or liquid agent. It is also envisioned that a pharmaceutical composition as disclosed herein can include one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients that facilitate processing of an active ingredient into pharmaceutically acceptable compositions. Insofar as any pharmacologically acceptable excipient is not incompatible with the active ingredient, its use in pharmaceutically acceptable compositions is contemplated. Non-limiting examples of pharmacologically acceptable excipients can be found in, e.g., Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms and Drug Delivery Systems (Howard C. Ansel et al., eds., Lippincott Williams & Wilkins Publishers, 7th ed. 1999); Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy (Alfonso R.

Aspects of the present specification provide, in part, administering a hydrogel composition disclosed herein. As used herein, the term “administering” means any delivery mechanism that provides a composition disclosed herein to an individual that potentially results in a clinically, therapeutically, or experimentally beneficial result. The actual delivery mechanism used to administer a composition to an individual can be determined by a person of ordinary skill in the art by taking into account factors, including, without limitation, the type of skin condition, the location of the skin condition, the cause of the skin condition, the severity of the skin condition, the degree of relief desired, the duration of relief desired, the particular composition used, the rate of excretion of the particular composition used, the pharmacodynamics of the particular composition used, the nature of the other compounds included in the particular composition used, the particular route of administration, the particular characteristics, history and risk factors of the individual, such as, e.g., age, weight, general health and the like, or any combination thereof. In an aspect of this embodiment, a composition disclosed herein is administered to a skin region of an individual by injection. The route of administration of a hydrogel composition to an individual patient will typically be determined based on the cosmetic and/or clinical effect desired by the individual and/or physician and the body part or region being treated. A composition disclosed herein may be administered by any means known to persons of ordinary skill in the art including, without limitation, syringe with needle, a pistol (for example, a hydropneumatic-compression pistol), catheter, topically, or by direct surgical implantation. The hydrogel composition disclosed herein can be administered into a skin region such as, e.g., a dermal region or a hypodermal region. For example, a hydrogel composition disclosed herein can be injected utilizing needles with a diameter of about 0.26 mm to about 0.4 mm and a length ranging from about 4 mm to about 14 mm. Alternately, the needles can be 21 to 32 G and have a length of about 4 mm to about 70 mm. Preferably, the needle is a single-use needle. The needle can be combined with a syringe, catheter, and/or a pistol. In addition, a composition disclosed herein can be administered once, or over a plurality of times. Ultimately, the timing used will follow quality care standards. For example, a hydrogel composition disclosed herein can be administered once or over several sessions with the sessions spaced apart by a few days, or weeks.

The routes discussed herein do not exclude the use of multiple routes to achieve the desired clinical effect. Aspects of the present specification provide, in part, a dermal region. As used herein, the term “dermal region” refers to the region of skin comprising the epidermal-dermal junction and the dermis including the superficial dermis (papillary region) and the deep dermis (reticular region). The skin is composed of three primary layers: the epidermis, which provides waterproofing and serves as a barrier to infection; the dermis, which serves as a location for the appendages of skin; and the hypodermis (subcutaneous adipose layer). The epidermis contains no blood vessels, and is nourished by diffusion from the dermis. The main type of cells which make up the epidermis are keratinocytes, melanocytes, Langerhans cells and Merkels cells. The dermis is the layer of skin beneath the epidermis that consists of connective tissue and cushions the body from stress and strain. The dermis is tightly connected to the epidermis by a basement membrane. It also harbors many Mechanoreceptor/nerve endings that provide the sense of touch and heat. It contains the hair follicles, sweat glands, sebaceous glands, apocrine glands, lymphatic vessels and blood vessels. The blood vessels in the dermis provide nourishment and waste removal from its own cells as well as from the Stratum basale of the epidermis. The dermis is structurally divided into two areas: a superficial area adjacent to the epidermis, called the papillary region, and a deep thicker area known as the reticular region. The papillary region is composed of loose areolar connective tissue. It is named for its fingerlike projections called papillae that extend toward the epidermis. The papillae provide the dermis with a “bumpy” surface that interdigitates with the epidermis, strengthening the connection between the two layers of skin. The reticular region lies deep in the papillary region and is usually much thicker. It is composed of dense irregular connective tissue, and receives its name from the dense concentration of collagenous, elastic, and reticular fibers that weave throughout it. These protein fibers give the dermis its properties of strength, extensibility, and elasticity. Also located within the reticular region are the roots of the hair, sebaceous glands, sweat glands, receptors, nails, and blood vessels. Tattoo ink is held in the dermis. Stretch marks from pregnancy are also located in the dermis. The hypodermis lies below the dermis. Its purpose is to attach the dermal region of the skin to underlying bone and muscle as well as supplying it with blood vessels and nerves. It consists of loose connective tissue and elastin. The main cell types are fibroblasts, macrophages and adipocytes (the hypodermis contains 50% of body fat). Fat serves as padding and insulation for the body. In an aspect of this embodiment, a hydrogel composition disclosed herein is administered to a skin region of an individual by injection into a dermal region or a hypodermal region. In aspects of this embodiment, a hydrogel composition disclosed herein is administered to a dermal region of an individual by injection into, e.g., an epidermal-dermal junction region, a papillary region, a reticular region, or any combination thereof.

EXAMPLES The following examples illustrate representative embodiments now contemplated, but should not be construed to limit the disclosed hydrogel compositions, and methods of soft tissue augmentation using such hydrogel compositions. Example 1 Method for Determining Gel Cohesivity This example illustrates tests that may be performed in order to evidence or quantify cohesivity of a HA-based gel composition. First, 0.2 g or 0.4 g of a gel composition to be tested is placed in a glass syringe. Next, 0.2 g or more of phosphate buffer is added to the syringe and the mixture is thoroughly mixed for about 1 hour to obtain a homogenous mixture. Then, the homogenized mixture is centrifuged for 5 min at 2000 tr/min to remove the air bubbles and to allow the decantation of any particles. The syringe is then held in a vertical position and one drop of eosin colorant is deposited at the surface of the gel by means of a syringe and an 18G needle. After 10 min, the dye has slowly diffused through the gel. After dilution of the gel, homogenization and decantation, a relatively low cohesivity gel shows a phase separation (an upper diluted less viscous phase without particles and a lower one composed of decanted particles that are visible with the naked eye or under microscope). Under the same conditions, a highly cohesive gel shows substantially no phase separation, and the dye is prevented from diffusing into the cohesive formulation. A relatively less cohesive gel, on the other hand, shows a clear phase separation. Example 2 Effect of Water Soluble Molecules on HA-Based Gel Formulation Extrudability The active ingredient was incorporated into a HA-based gel matrix and autoclaved by steam sterilization at a temperature between about 130° C. to about 135° C. for between about one minute and about 10 minutes. The hydrogel properties, aspect (i.e., color/clarity/homogeneity), and extrusion force were analyzed after autoclaving and at 3 years equivalent at room temperature. All formulations were clear, homogenous, uncolored, and had acceptable extrusion force properties after autoclaving and at the 3-year equivalent mark (Table 3). These results show that the test gels exhibited no degradation, indicating that the gels were stable and incorporation of the ingredients had no impact on hydrogel properties and structure.

In other words the measured ΔF of the extrusion force of the HA gel with the specified ingredients minus the extrusion force of the HA gel without the added ingredients was <2 N Example 3 Effect of Vitamin C Derivative on HA-Based Gel Formulation Extrudability and Stability Ascorbic acid, at a concentration of 1% (w/w) was, incorporated in a HA-based gel matrix, and the pH of the gel adjusted to about 7 and then autoclaved by steam sterilization at a temperature between about 130° C. to about 135° C. for between about one minute and about 10 minutes. Although clear and uncolored before autoclaving, the gel was clear but yellowed after autoclaving indicating that the test gel was degraded. Example 4 Effect of Vitamin C Derivative on HA-Based Gel Formulation Extrudability and Stability Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate (MAP), at a concentration of 0.6% (w/w), 1% (w/w) or 2% (w/w), was incorporated in a HA-based gel matrix, and the pH of the gel adjusted to about 7 and then autoclaved as in Example 3. The gel was clear and uncolored both before and after autoclaving. Both extrusion force and degradation were used to access the rheological properties of a gel. Degradation was determined as a function of time using a controlled stress rheometer according to the following method: frequency sweep from 0.05 Hz to 10 Hz with 0.8% (w/w) controlled strain. Δ Tan δ 1 Hz=(Tan δ 1 Hz test gel)−(Tan δ 1 Hz control gel) where Tan δ 1 Hz is the ratio of viscous modulus to elastic modulus. A Δ Tan δ 1 Hz of less than 0.1 demonstrates no detectable degradation, indicating that a test gel was stable. Rheology analysis showed that although the test gels has acceptable extrusion force properties, the test gels exhibited degradation after autoclaving indicating that the gel was unstable (Table 4).

The gel was clear and uncolored both before and after autoclaving. Rheology analysis showed that the test gels had acceptable extrusion force properties, and that the test gels exhibited no degradation relative to controls indicating that the gels were stable (Table 6). The degradation of the test gels decreased as the concentration of ascorbic acid 2-glucoside increased indicating that higher ascorbic acid 2-glucoside concentrations increased gel stability.

After the test period, the gel was clear and uncolored. Surprisingly, rheology analysis showed that the test gel comprising 0.3% (w/w) lidocaine and either 0.6% (w/w) ascorbic acid 2-glucoside (AA2G™) or 0.6% (w/w) ascorbic acid 2-glucoside (AA2G™) and 1.5% (w/w) TPGS not only exhibited no degradation during the test period. (Table 10), TABLE 10 Formulation Δ Tan δ 1 Hz HA gel + 0.6% (w/w) AA2G ™ + 0.3% (w/w) 0.020 Lidocaine HA gel + 0.6% (w/w) AA2G ™ + 1.5% (w/w) 0.007 TPGS + 0.3% (w/w) Lidocaine Stable if Δ Tan δ 1 Hz < 0.1 The stability of extrusion force, pH, and degradation are shown over time in FIGS. 3, 4, and 5, respectively. HPLC analysis (C18 column; eluent: sodium phosphate buffer (pH 2.2), 2-propanol 10%, 0.7 ml/min; detection at 260 nm) confirmed the ingredients after autoclaving and 3-year shelf-life are shown in FIG. 6. Example 14 Vitamin C Derivative Promotes Collagen Synthesis Human skin fibroblasts were cultured in a 12 wells plate. At confluence, 100 μL of each compound HA-based gel matrix w 0.3% (w/w) lidocaine; HA-based gel matrix with 0.3% (w/w) lidocaine and 0.6% (w/w) ascorbic acid 2-glucoside (AA2G™); and Phosphate Buffer with 0.6% (w/w) ascorbic acid 2-glucoside (AA2G™) was deposited in a culture insert (porosity of 0.4 μm), which was itself laid on the fibroblast monolayers. In parallel, a control without treatment was performed. Cultures were incubated for 72 hours and each experimental condition was conducted done in triplicate. At the end of incubation, cell viability was verified by microscopic observation and MTT reduction assay. Pro-collagen I secretion was measured using ELISA kit. The presence of 0.6% (w/w) ascorbic acid 2-glucoside (AA2G™) in a hyaluronic acid gel containing 0.3% (w/w) lidocaine increased pro-collagen synthesis by a factor 3 (+292%), whereas gel with 0.3% (w/w) lidocaine showed an increase of 40% of the pro-collagen secretion (see FIG. 2). Example 15 Vitamin C Derivative Protects HA-Based Gel Formulation from Oxidative Degradation The effect of ascorbic acid 2-glucoside (AA2G™) on HA-based gel matrix oxidative degradation was studied. Oxidation testing was used as it allows testing of the resistance of a HA-based gel matrix to free radicals. Degradation by free radicals was simulated on a rheometer (Haake Rheostress 600) by addition of 1/7 ratio of H2O2 30% on the surface of a spread gel measured with a controlled stress rheometer according to the following method: frequency of 1 Hz with 0.8% controlled strain, during 3600 s at 35° C. The time value is taken at 5 Pa/s. Further, a comparison of antioxidant properties for a HA-based gel matrix with 0.3% (w/w) lidocaine and 0.06% (w/w) ascorbic acid 2-glucoside (AA2G™) (15 800 s) versus a HA-based gel matrix with 0.3% (w/w) lidocaine (4 942 s) showed that the gel containing ascorbic acid 2-glucoside (AA2G™) and lidocaine is more stable with respect to free radical activity (FIG. 7). Ascorbic acid 2-glucoside (AA2G™) protected against oxidative degradation by a factor of 3. Example 16 Implantation Study A gel containing 0.6% (w/w) ascorbic acid 2-glucoside (AA2G™) was implanted in the deep dermis and subcutaneous tissues in rats. Histological evaluation at 1 week showed some mononuclear cells (lymphocytes and plasmocytes) around the implants in all implantation sites (test and control). They were also associated with macrophages. The gel containing ascorbic acid 2-glucoside (AA2G™) appeared to be less inflammatory. The irritation index in test samples (sodium HA with AA2G™) was 9.9 compared to 12.3 in controls (sodium HA only). Table 11 shows the histological results at 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months. The irritation scores of test gel for each implantation time are lower than control.

In closing, it is to be understood that although aspects of the present specification have been described with reference to the various embodiments, one skilled in the art will readily appreciate that the specific examples disclosed are only illustrative of the principles of the subject matter disclosed herein. Therefore, it should be understood that the disclosed subject matter is in no way limited to a particular methodology, protocol, and/or reagent, etc., described herein. As such, those skilled in the art could make numerous and various modifications or changes to or alternative configurations of the disclosed subject matter can be made in accordance with the teachings herein without departing from the spirit of the present specification. Changes in detail may be made without departing from the spirit of the invention as defined in the appended claims. Lastly, the terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only, and is not intended to limit the scope of the present invention, which is defined solely by the claims. In addition, it is intended that all matter contained in the above description or shown in the accompanying drawings shall be interpreted as illustrative only and not limiting. Accordingly, the present invention is not limited to that precisely as shown and described. Certain embodiments of this invention are described herein, including the best mode known to the inventors for carrying out the invention. Of course, variations on these described embodiments will become apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art upon reading the foregoing description. The inventor expects skilled artisans to employ such variations as appropriate, and the inventors intend for the invention to be practiced otherwise than specifically described herein. Accordingly, this invention includes all modifications and equivalents of the subject matter recited in the claims appended hereto as permitted by applicable law. Moreover, any combination of the above-described elements in all possible variations thereof is encompassed by the invention unless otherwise indicated herein or otherwise clearly contradicted by context. Groupings of alternative elements or embodiments of the invention disclosed herein are not to be construed as limitations. Each group member may be referred to and claimed individually or in any combination with other members of the group or other elements found herein. It is anticipated that one or more members of a group may be included in, or deleted from, a group for reasons of convenience and/or patentability. When any such inclusion or deletion occurs, the specification is deemed to contain the group as modified thus fulfilling the written description of all Markush groups used in the appended claims. Unless otherwise indicated, all numbers expressing quantities of ingredients, properties such as molecular weight, reaction conditions, and so forth used in the specification and claims are to be understood as being modified in all instances by the term “about.” As used herein, the term “about” means that the item, parameter or term so qualified encompasses a range of plus or minus ten percent above and below the value of the stated item, parameter or term. Accordingly, unless indicated to the contrary, the numerical parameters set forth in the specification and attached claims are approximations that may vary depending upon the desired properties sought to be obtained by the present invention. At the very least, and not as an attempt to limit the application of the doctrine of equivalents to the scope of the claims, each numerical parameter should at least be construed in light of the number of reported significant digits and by applying ordinary rounding techniques. Notwithstanding that the numerical ranges and parameters setting forth the broad scope of the invention are approximations, the numerical values set forth in the specific examples are reported as precisely as possible. Any numerical value, however, inherently contains certain errors necessarily resulting from the standard deviation found in their respective testing measurements. The terms “a,” “an,” “the” and similar referents used in the context of describing the invention (especially in the context of the following claims) are to be construed to cover both the singular and the plural, unless otherwise indicated herein or clearly contradicted by context. Recitation of ranges of values herein is merely intended to serve as a shorthand method of referring individually to each separate value falling within the range. Unless otherwise indicated herein, each individual value is incorporated into the specification as if it were individually recited herein. All methods described herein can be performed in any suitable order unless otherwise indicated herein or otherwise clearly contradicted by context. The use of any and all examples, or exemplary language (e.g., “such as”) provided herein is intended merely to better illuminate the invention and does not pose a limitation on the scope of the invention otherwise claimed. No language in the specification should be construed as indicating any non-claimed element essential to the practice of the invention. Specific embodiments disclosed herein may be further limited in the claims using consisting of or consisting essentially of language. When used in the claims, whether as filed or added per amendment, the transition term “consisting of” excludes any element, step, or ingredient not specified in the claims. The transition term “consisting essentially of” limits the scope of a claim to the specified materials or steps and those that do not materially affect the basic and novel characteristic(s). Embodiments of the invention so claimed are inherently or expressly described and enabled herein. All patents, patent publications, and other publications referenced and identified in the present specification are individually and expressly incorporated herein by reference in their entirety for the purpose of describing and disclosing, for example, the compositions and methodologies described in such publications that might be used in connection with the present invention. These publications are provided solely for their disclosure prior to the filing date of the present application. Nothing in this regard should be construed as an admission that the inventors are not entitled to antedate such disclosure by virtue of prior invention or for any other reason. All statements as to the date or representation as to the contents of these documents are based on the information available to the applicants and does not constitute any admission as to the correctness of the dates or contents of these documents. 1.
