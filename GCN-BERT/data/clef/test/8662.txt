Step 6: N-(1-(3-amino-4-(thiophen-3-yl)phenyl)ethyl)cyclopropanecarboxamide
N-(1-(3-nitro-4-(thiophen-3-yl)phenyl)ethyl)cyclopropanecarboxamide (150.0 mg, 0.47 mmol), reduced iron powder (140 mg, 2.27 mmol) and ammonium chloride (128 mg, 2.27 mmol) were added to a mixed solution of methanol (40 mL) and water (40 mL). The reaction mixture was reacted for 0.5 hour at a temperature of 70 Â°C, and then cooled to room temperature. After filtration, the resulting solid was washed with ethyl acetate, and the filtrate was partitioned. The organic phase was dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate, and the solvent was removed by rotary evaporation of the organic phase to afford N-(1-(3-amino-4-(thiophen-3-yl)phenyl)ethyl)cyclopropanecarboxamide (100 mg, yield 73.6%).
