U.S. Patent No. 5,006,528 to Oshiro et al. discloses 7-[(4-phenylpiperazino)butoxy] carbostyrils, which include aripiprazole, as dopaminergic neurotransmitter antagonists. Aripiprazole which has the structure is an atypical antipsychotic agent useful in treating schizophrenia. It has poor aqueous solubility (<^g/mL at room temperature). U.S. Patent No. 6,267,989 to Liversidge, et al. discloses a method for preventing crystal growth and particle aggregation in nanoparticulate compositions wherein a nanoparticulate composition is reduced to an optimal effective average particle size employing aqueous nulling techniques including ball milling. U.S. Patent No. 5,314,506 to Midler, et al. relates to a process for the direct crystallization of a pharmaceutical having high surface area particles of high purity and stability wherein impinging jet streams are employed to achieve high intensity BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION micromixing of particles of the pharmaceutical followed by nucléation and direct production of small crystals. A long-acting aripiprazole sterile injectable formulation has merit as a drug dosage form in that it may increase the compliance of patients and thereby lower the rate of relapse in the treatment of schizophrenia. Examples of known long acting drug products for the treatment of schizophrenia include haloperidol decanoate and fluphenazine decanoate both of which have an ester compound of low water solubility dissolved in sesame oil. Microcapsules containing Risperidone (W095/13814) and Olanzapine (W099/12549) are also known. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a sterile freeze-dried aripiprazole formulation which upon constitution with water for injection releases aripiprazole over a period of at least about one week, and preferably over a period of two, three or four weeks and up to six weeks or more. In an embodiment, the invention relates to a lyophilized formulation for release of aripiprazole over a period of about two to about four weeks, which comprises: (a) aripiprazole monohydrate having a mean particle size of 1 to 10 microns; (b) carboxymethylcellulose or its sodium-salt, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxypropylethyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose, or polyvinylpyrrolidone; (c) mannitol, sucrose, maltose, lactose, xylitol or sorbitol; and (d) sodium phosphate, potassium phosphate or TRIS buffer. The freeze-dried aripiprazole formulation of the invention includes: (a) aripiprazole, and (b) a vehicle for the aripiprazole, which formulation upon reconstitution with water forms an injectable suspension which, upon injection, preferably intramuscularly, releases aripiprazole over a period of at least one week, preferably two, three or four weeks, and up to six weeks or more. In one embodiment, the invention relates to a sterile freeze-dried controlled release aripiprazole formulation which comprises: (a) aripiprazole having a mean particle size of 1 to 10 microns, and (b) a vehicle therefore, which formulation upon reconstitution with water forms a sterile injectable formulation in the form of a sterile homogeneous suspension which upon injection releases aripiprazole over a period of at least two weeks. The freeze-dried aripiprazole formulation of the invention will preferably include: (a) aripiprazole, (b) one or more suspending agents, (c) optionally one or more bulking agents, (d) optionally one or more buffers, and (e) optionally one or more pH adjusting agents. In another embodiment, the invention relates to a sterile freeze-dried controlled release aripiprazole formulation, which comprises: (a) aripiprazole having a mean particle size of 1 to 10 microns, and (b) one or more suspending agents, wherein said sterile freeze-dried controlled release aripiprazole formulation is obtained by freeze-drying an aqueous suspension comprising (a) and (b), and wherein upon reconstitution, which comprises adding water to the freeze-dried formulation,'a sterile injectable formulation is obtained which is a homogeneous suspension and which contains from 0.1 to 600 mg of aripiprazole per mL, and wherein upon injection into a subject, said sterile injectable formulation releases aripiprazole over a period of at least two weeks from the date of administration. A mean particle size of the freeze-dried aripiprazole formulation within the range from about 1 to about 30 microns is essential in formulating an injectable which releases aripiprazole over.a period of at least about one week and up to six weeks or more, for example up to 8 weeks. ■ It has been found that the smaller the mean particle size of the freeze-dried aripiprazole, the shorter the period of extended release. Thus, in accordance with the present invention, when the mean particle size is about 1 micron, the aripiprazole will be released over a period of less than three weeks, preferably about two weeks. When the mean particle size is more than about 1 micron, the aripiprazole will be released over a period of at least two weekp, preferably about three tD four weeks, and up to six weeks or more. Thus, in accordance with the present invention, the aripiprazole release duration can be modified by changing the particle size of the aripiprazole in the freeze-dried formation. The term “mean particle size” refers to volume mean diameter as measured hy . laser-light scattering (LLS) methods. Particle size distribution is measured by LLS methods and mean particle size is calculated from the particle size distribution. In addition, in accordance with the present invention, a cqntrolled release · sterile injectable aripiprazole formulation in the form of a sterile suspension, that is,, the freeze-dried formulation of the invention suspended in water for injection, is provided which, upon injection, preferably intramuscularly, releases aripiprazole over a period of at least one week, which includes: (a) aripiprazole, (b) a vehicle therefor, and (c) water for injection. The controlled release sterile injectable formulation of the invention in the form of a sterile suspension allows for high drug loadings per unit volume of the formulation and therefore permits delivery of relatively high doses of aripiprazole in a small injection volume (0.1 - 600 mg of drug per 1 mL of suspension). In another embodiment, the invention relates to a controlled release sterile aripiprazole injectable formulation in the form of a sterile homogeneous suspension which upon injection releases aripiprazole over a period of at least two weeks, which comprises: (a) aripiprazole having a mean particle size of 1 to 10 microns in an amount of 100 to 400 mg per mL, (b) a vehicle therefore, and (c) water for injection. Further, in accordance with the present invention, a method is provided for preparing the sterile freeze-dried aripiprazole formulation described above which includes the steps of: (a) preparing sterile bulk aripiprazole, preferably having a desired particle size distribution and mean particle size within the range from about 5 to about 100 microns, (b) preparing a sterile vehicle for the sterile bulk aripiprazole, (c) combining the sterile bulk aripiprazole and the sterile vehicle to form a sterile primary suspension, (d) reducing the mean particle size of aripiprazole in the sterile primary 5 suspension to within the range from about 1 to about 30 microns, to form a final sterile suspension, and (e) freeze drying the final sterile suspension to form a sterile freeze-dried suspension of the aripiprazole of desired polymorphic form (anhydrous, monohydrate, or a mixture of both). 10 In carrying out the above method, the reduction of the mean particle size of the sterile primary suspension to the desired mean particle size is preferably carried out employing an aseptic wet milling procedure, which more preferably is aseptic wet ball milling. Aseptic wet milling is preferred in forming a homogeneous and sterile aripiprazole formulation of desired mean particle size distribution. 15 In addition, in accordance with the present invention, a method for freeze drying the final sterile suspension of aripiprazole is provided'which produces a sterile freeze-dried aripiprazole of desired polymorphic form, that is anhydrous, monohydrate, or a mixture of both. 20 As an unexpected observation, it has been discovered that a suspension of aripiprazole suspended in an aqueous solvent system will maintain a substantially 25 constant aripiprazole drug plasma concentration when administered by injection; preferably as an intra-muscular injection. No large “burst phenomenon” is observed and it is considerably surprising that a constant aripiprazole drug plasma concentration can be maintained from one (1) to more than eight (8) weeks employing the aripiprazole suspension of the invention. The daily starting dose for an orally 30 administered aripiprazole formulation is fifteen (15) milligrams. In order to administer a drug dose equivalent to one (1) to more than eight (8) weeks of the oral dosage quantity requires the administration of a very large amount of the drug as a single dose. The aqueous aripiprazole injectable formulation of the invention may be administered to deliver large amounts of the drug without creating patient compliance problems. The aripiprazole injectable formulation of the invention may include anhydrous or monohydrate crystalline forms of aripiprazole or an admixture containing both. If the monohydrate is used, the maintenance of an extended drag plasma concentration is possible. The aripiprazole injectable formulation of the invention can be administered as an aqueous ready-to-use suspension; however, by freeze-drying this suspension a more useful drug product can be supplied.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The controlled release sterile injectable aripiprazole formulation of the invention may include aripiprazole in an amount within the range from about 1 to about 40%, preferably from about 5 to about 20%, and more preferably from about 8 to about 15% by weight based on the weight of the sterile injectable formulation. As indicated, desired mean particle size of the aripiprazole is essential in producing an injectable formulation having the desired controlled release properties of the aripiprazole. Thus, to produce desired controlled release, the aripiprazole should have a mean particle size within the range from about 1 to about 30 microns, preferably from about 1 to about 20 microns, and more preferably from about 1 to about 10 to 15 microns. Where the desired controlled release period is at least about two weeks, up to six weeks or more, preferably about three to about four weeks, the aripiprazole will have a mean particle size within the range from about 1 to about 20, preferably from about 1 to about 10 microns, more preferably from about 2 to about 4 microns, and most preferably about 2.5 microns. The aripiprazole having a mean particle size of about 2.5 microns will have a particle size distribution as follows: Preferred More Preferred 95% < 20 microns 95% < 8 microns 90% < 15 microns 90% < 6 microns 50% < 10 microns 75% <3 microns 10% < 2 microns 50% <1.5 microns 10% < 0.5 microns The aripiprazole formulation of the invention will preferably be formed of: A. aripiprazole, Β. a vehicle therefor, which includes: (a) one or more suspending agents, (b) one or more bulking agents, (c) . one or more buffers, and (d) optionally one or more pH adjusting agents. The suspending agent may be present in an amount within the range from about 0.2 to about 10% by weight, preferably for about 0.5 to about 5% by weight based on the total weight of the sterile injectable formulation. Examples of suspending agents suitable for use include, but are not limited to, one, two or more of the following: sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose, hydroxypropylethyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose, and polyvinylpyrrolidone, with sodium carboxymethyl cellulose and polyvinylpyrrolidone being preferred. Other suspending agents suitable for use in the vehicle for the aripiprazole include various polymers, low molecular weight oligomers, natural products, and surfactants, including nonionic and ionic surfactants, such as cetyl pyridinium chloride, gelatin, casein, lecithin (phosphatides), dextran, glycerol, gum acacia, cholesterol, tragacanth, stearic acid, benzalkonium chloride, calcium stearate, glycerol monostearate, cetostearyl alcohol, cetomacrogol emulsifying wax, sorbitan esters, polyoxyethylene alkyl ethers (e.g., macrogol ethers such as cetomacrogol 1000), polyoxyethylene castor oil derivatives, polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid esters (e.g., the commercially available Tweens® such as e.g., Tween 20® and Tween 80® (ICI Specialty Chemicals)); polyethylene glycols (e.g., Carbowaxs 3350® and 1450®, and Carbopol 934® (Union Carbide)), dodecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide, polyoxyethylene stearates, collodial silicon dioxide, phosphates, sodium dodecylsulfate, carboxymethylcellulose ti calcium, hydroxypropyl celluloses (e.g., HPC, HPC-SL, and HPC-L), methylcellulose, hydroxyethylcellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl-cellulose phthalate, noncrystalline cellulose, magnesium aluminum silicate, triethanolamine, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), 4-(l,l,3,3-tetramethylbutyl)-phenol polymer with ethylene oxide and formaldehyde (also known as tyloxapol, superione, and triton), poloxamers (e.g., Pluronics F68® and F108®, which are block copolymers of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide); poloxamines (è.g., Tetronic 908®, also known as Poloxamine 908®, which is a tetrafunctional block copolymer derived from sequential addition of propylene oxide and ethylene oxide to ethylenediamine (BASF Wyandotte Corporation, Parsippany, N.J.)); a charged phospholipid such as dimyristoyl phophatidyl glycerol, dioctylsulfosuccinate (DOSS); Tetronic 1508® (Τ-1508) (BASF Wyandotte_ Corporation), dialkylesters of sodium sulfosuccinic acid (e.g., Aerosol OT®, which is a dioctyl ester of sodium sulfosuccinic acid (American Cyanamid)); Duponol P®, which is a sodium lauryl sulfate (DuPont); Tritons X-200®, which is an alkyl aryl polyether sulfonate (Rohm and Haas); Crodestas F-l 10®, which is a mixture of sucrose stearate and sucrose distearate (Croda Inc.); p-isononylphenoxypoly(glycidol), also known as Olin-IOG® or Surfactant 10-G® (Olin Chemicals, Stamford, Conn.); Crodestas SL-40® (Croda, Inc.); and SA90HCO, which is Ci8H37CH2(CON(CH3)) - CH2(CHOH)4(CH2OH)2 (Eastman Kodak Co.); decanoyl-N-methylglucamide; n-decyl P-D-glucopyranoside; n-decyl p-D-maltopyranoside; ηdodecyl P-D-glucopyranoside; n-dodecyl P-D-maltoside; heptanoyl-Nmethylglucamide; n-heptyl-P-D-glucopyranoside; n-heptyl P-D-thioglucoside; n-hexyl P-D-glucopyranoside; nonanoyl-N-methylglucamide; n-nonyl P-D-glucopyranoside; octanoyl-N-methylglucamide; n-octyl-p-D-glucopyranoside; octyl β-ϋthioglucopyranoside; and the like. Most of these suspending agents are known pharmaceutical excipients and are described in detail in the Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients, published jointly by the American Pharmaceutical Association and The Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain (The Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain (The Pharmaceutical Press, 1986). The suspending agents are commercially available and/or can be prepared by techniques known in the art. Carboxymethyl cellulose or the sodium salt thereof is particularly preferred where the desired mean particle size is about 1 micron or above. The bulking agent (also referred to as a ciyogenic/lyophilize protecting agent) may be present in an amount within the range from about 1 to about 10% by weight, preferably from about 3 to about 8% by weight, more preferably from about 4 to about 5% by weight based on the total weight of the sterile injectable formulation. Examples of bulking agents suitable for use herein include, but are not limited to, one, two or more of the following: mannitol, sucrose, maltose, xylitol, glucose, starches, sorbital, and the like, with mannitol being preferred for formulations where the mean particle size is about 1 micron or above. It has been found that xylitol and/or sorbitol enhances stability of the aripiprazole formulation by inhibiting crystal growth and agglomeration of drug particles so that desired particle size may be achieved and maintained. The buffer may be employed in an amount to adjust pH of an aqueous suspension of the freeze-dried aripiprazole formulation to from about 6 to about 8, preferably about 7. To achieve such pH, usually the buffer, depending on type, will be employed in an amount within the range from about 0.02 to about 2% by weight, preferably from about 0.03 to about 1% by weight, and more preferably about 0.1% by weight based on the total weight of the sterile injectable formulation. Examples of buffers suitable for use herein include, but are not limited to, one, two or more of the following: sodium phosphate, potassium phosphate, or TRIS buffer, with sodium phosphate being preferred. The freeze-dried formulation of the invention may optionally include a pH adjusting agent which may then be employed in an amount to adjust pH of the aqueous suspension of the freeze-dried aripiprazole within the range from about 6 to about 7.5, preferably about 7 and may be an acid or base depending upon whether the pH of the aqueous suspension of the freeze-dried aripiprazole needs to be raised or lowered to reach the desired neutral pH of about 7. Thus, where the pH needs to be lowered, an acidic pH adjusting agent such as hydrochloric acid or acetic acid, preferably hydrochloric acid, may be employed. When the pH needs to be raised, a basic pH adjusting agent will be employed such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, calcium carbonate, magnesium oxide or magnesium hydroxide, preferably sodium hydroxide. The freeze-dried aripiprazole formulations may be constituted with an amount of water for injection to provide from about 10 to about 400 mg of aripiprazole delivered in a volume of 2.5 mL or less, preferably 2 mL for a two to six week dosage. In carrying out the method for preparing the freeze-dried aripiprazole formulation of the invention, it is required that everything be sterile so that sterile aripiprazole and sterile vehicle are combined aseptically to form a sterile suspension and that the sterile suspension be freeze-dried in a manner to form sterile freeze-dried powder or cake. Thus, an aseptic procedure is employed to produce sterile bulk aripiprazole of desired particle size distribution. The sterile bulk aripiprazole will have a mean particle size within the range from about 5 to about 100 microns, preferably from about 10 to about 90 microns. Preferably, an impinging jet crystallization method is employed to produce sterile aripiprazole of desired small particle size and a narrow size distribution, high surface area, high chemical purity, high stability due to improved crystal structure, while employing continuous processing. The impinging jet crystallization utilizes two jet streams that strike each other head-on. One of the streams carries a solution rich in the aripiprazole and the other carries an anti-solvent, such as water. The two streams strike each other which allows rapid homogeneous mixing and supersaturation due to high turbulence and high intensity of micromixing upon impact. This immediate achievement of supersaturation initiates rapid nucléation. In general, the average crystal size decreases with increasing supersaturation and decreasing temperature of the anti-solvent. Therefore, in order to obtain the smallest particle size, it is advantageous to have the highest possible concentration of the rich solution and the lowest temperature of the anti-solvent. i The vehicle for the sterile bulk aripiprazole including suspending agent, bulking agent, buffer, optional pH adjusting agent and water is prepared and subjected to sterilization. Thereafter, the sterile bulk aripiprazole and sterile vehicle are aseptically combined to form a sterile primary suspension and the particle size of the aripiprazole is reduced to a desired level. This is preferably carried out employing an aseptic wet milling procedure wherein sterile particles of aripiprazole dispersed in the sterile vehicle are subjected to grinding means in the presence of grinding media to reduce the particle size of the aripiprazole to within the range of about. 1 to about 10 microns, depending upon desired controlled release period. The aseptic wet milling procedure is preferably wet ball milling. When the desired mean particle size of the aripiprazole is above about 1 micron, the primary suspension (combined aripiprazole-vehicle) is passed through a wet ball mill a single time (single pass) at from about 5 to about 15 L/hr, preferably from about 8 to about 12 L/hr, and more preferably about 10 L/hr, to reduce mean particle size of the aripiprazole to within the desired range, for example, from about 1 to about 5 microns. In addition to ball mills, such as Dyno mills, other low and high energy mins i may be employed such as a roller mill, and high energy mills may be employed such as Netzsch mills, DC mills and Planetary mills. However, it is essential that the milling procedure and equipment employed be capable of producing sterile aripiprazole formulation of desired mean particle size. Other techniques for particle size reduction which may be employed include aseptic controlled crystallization, high shear homogenization, high pressure homogenization and microfluidization to produce particles having a mean particle size ranging from about 1 to about 100 microns.. The resulting final suspension is aseptically filled into sterile vials and aseptically loaded into a sterilized freeze drier. It is essential that a carefully designed freeze drying cycle be applied in order to form and/or maintain the desired crystalline form of the aripiprazole, which is known to exist in monohydrate form (Aripiprazole Hydrate A) as well as in a number of anhydrous forms, namely Anhydrous Crystals Β, Anhydrous Crystals C, Anhydrous Crystals D, Anhydrous Crystals Ε, Anhydrous - 10- Crystals F, and Anhydrous Crystals G, all of which may be employed in the formulation of the invention. The aripiprazole monohydrate (grains) or hydrate as referred to below employed in the present mvention has the physicochemical properties given in (1)-(5) below. This aripiprazole hydrate is described hereinafter as “Aripiprazole Hydrate A”. (1) It has an endothermic curve characterized by the appearance of a small peak at about 71 °C and a gradual endothermic peak around 60°C to 120°C.

Aripiprazole Hydrate A is manufactured by milling conventional aripiprazole hydrate. Conventional milling methods can be used to mill the aripiprazole hydrate. For example, the aripiprazole hydrate can be milled in a milling machine. A widely used milling machine can be used, such as an atomizer, pin mill, jet mill or ball mill. Of these, the atomizer is preferred. Regarding the specific milling conditions when using an atomizer, a rotational speed of 5000-15000 ipm could be used for the main axis, for example, with a feed rotation of 10-30 rpm and a screen hole size of 1-5 mm. The mean grain size of the Aripiprazole Hydrate A obtained by milling should normally be 50 pm or less, preferably 30 pm or less. Mean grain size can be ascertained by the grain size measurement method described hereinafter. - 11 - Grain Sizes Measurement: 0.1 g of the grains to be measured were suspended in a 20 ml n-hexane solution of 0.5 g soy lecithin, and grain size was measured using a size distribution meter (Microtrack HRA, Microtrack Co.). The aripiprazole anhydrous crystals employed in the present invention have the physicochemical properties given in (6)-(10) below. These aripiprazole anhydrous crystals are referred to hereinafter as “Aripiprazole Anhydrous Crystals B”. (6) They have an ‘H-NMR spectrum, which has (DMSO-de, TMS). *H-NMR spectrum, which has cbaracteristicpeaks at 1.55-1.63 ppm (m, 2Η), 1.68-1.78 ppm (χη, 2Η), 2.35-2.46 ppm (m, 4Η), 2.48-2.56 ppm (m, 4Η + DMSO), 2.78 ppm (t, J = 7.4 Hz, 2Η), 2.97 ppm (brt, J ≈ 4.6 Hz, 4Η), 3.92 ppm (t,J = 6.3 Hz, 2Η), 6.43 ppm (d, J ≈ 2.4 Hz, 1Η), 6.49 ppm (dd, J ≈ 8.4 Hz, J = 2.4 Hz, 1Η), 7.04 ppm (d, J = 8.1 Hz, 1Η), 7.11-7.17 ppm (m, HQ, 7.28- 732 ppm (m, 2Η) and 10.00 ppm (s, 1Η). (7) They have a powder x-ray diffraction spectrum which has characteristic peaks $t 26= 11.0°, 16.6°, 193°, 20.3° and 22.1°. (8) They have clear infrared absorption bands at 2945,2812,1678,1627, 1448,1377,1173,960 and 779 cm'1 on the IR (KBr) spectrum. (9) They exhibit an endothermic peak near about 1413°C in thcnnogravimetric/differential thermal analysis (herding rate 5°C/min). (10) They exhibit an endothermic peak near about 140.7°C in differential scanning calorimetry (heating rate 5°C/min). Aripiprazole Anhydrous Crystals Β employed in the present invention have low hygroscopicity. For example, Aripiprazole Anhydrous Crystals Β employed in the present invention maintain a water content of 0.4% or less after 24 hours inside a dessicator set at a temperature of 60°C and a humidity of 100%. Well-known methods of measuring water content can be used as long as they are methods commonly used for measuring the water content of crystals. For example, a method such as the Karl Kscher method can be used. The Aripiprazole Anhydrous Crystals Β employed in the present invention are prepared for example by heating the aforementioned Aripiprazole Hydrate A at 90-125°C. The heating time is generally about 3-50 hours, depending on heating temperature. The heating time and heating temperature are inversely related, so that for example the heating time will be longer the lower the heating temperature, and shorter the higher the heating temperature. Specifically, if the heating temperature of Aripiprazole Hydrate A is 100°C, the heating time should normally be 18 hours or more or preferably about 24 hours. If the heating temperature of Aripiprazole Hydrate A is 120°C, on the other hand, the heating time can be about 3 hours. The Aripiprazole Anhydrous Crystals Β of the present invention can be prepared with certainty by heating Aripiprazole Hydrate A for about 18 hours at 100°C, and then heating it for about 3 hours at 120°C. Furthermore, the Aripiprazole Anhydrous Crystals Β employed in the present invention are prepared for example by heating conventional aripiprazole anhydrous crystals at 90-125°C. The heating time is generally about 3-50 hours, depending on heating temperature. The heating time and heating temperature are inversely related, as described above. Specifically, if the heating temperature of the aripiprazole anhydrous crystals is 100°C, the heating time can be about 4 hours, and if the heating-temperature is 120°C the heating time can be about 3 hours. The aripiprazole anhydrous crystals which are the raw material for preparing the Aripiprazole Anhydrous Crystals Β employed in the present invention are prepared for example by Method a or b below. Method a: Aripiprazole Anhydrous Crystals are prepared by well-known methods, as by reacting 7-(4-bromobutoxy)-3,4-dihydrocarbostyril with l-(2,3-dichlorophenyl) piperidine ayid recrystallizing the resulting raw aripiprazole crystals with ethanol as described in Example 1 of Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 191256/1990. Method b: Aripiprazole Anhydrous Crystals are prepared by heating conventional aripiprazole hydrate at a temperature of at least 60°C and less than 90°C. The heating - 13 - time is generally about 1-30 hours, depending on heating temperature. The heating time and heating temperature are inversely related, as decribed above. Specifically, if the heating temperature of the aripiprazole hydrate is about 60°C, the heating time can be about 8 hours, while if the heating temperature is 80°C, the heating time can be about 4 hours. Method b is described in the Proceedings of the 4th Japanese-Korean Symposium on Separation Technology [October 6-8,1996). Furthermore, the Aripiprazole Anhydrous Crystals Β employed in the present invention are prepared for example by heating conventional aripiprazole hydrate at 90-125°C. The heating time is generally about 3-50 hours, depending on heating temperature. The heating time and heating temperature are inversely related. Specifically, if the heating temperature of the aripiprazole hydrate is 100°C, the heating time can be about 24 hours, while if the heating temperature is 120°C, the heating time can be about 3 hours. The aripiprazole hydrate which is the raw material for preparing the Aripiprazole Anhydrous Crystals Β employed in the present invention is prepared for example by Method c below. Method c: Aripiprazole hydrate is obtained by dissolving the aripiprazole anhydrous crystals obtained by Method a above in a hydrous solvent, and heating and then cooling the resulting solution. Using this method, aripiprazole hydrate is precipitated as crystals in the hydrous solvent. An organic solvent containing water is usually used as the hydrous solvent. The organic solvent should be one which is miscible with water, such as for example an alcohol such as methanol, ethanol, propanol or isopropanol, a ketone such as acetone, an ether such as tetrahydrofuran, dimethylformamide, or a mixture thereof, with ethanol being particularly desirable.
