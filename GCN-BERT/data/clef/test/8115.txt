CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS The present application is a Continuation-In-Part application based on U.S. non-provisional patent application Ser. No. 13/887,338 filed May 5, 2013, currently co-pending, the entire contents of which are incorporated by reference. Applicant claims the priority benefit of the Ser. No. 13/887,338 application. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION A liquid purification system is provided. Although not limited to water, the purification system is especially suitable for water. The purification system utilizes a vessel having antimicrobial inner wall load bearing surfaces and/or antimicrobial (antibacterial, anti-fungal, anti-mold, etc.) interior non-load bearing surfaces. When the liquid moves within the vessel and contacts the antimicrobial surfaces, the liquid becomes purified, disinfected or sanitized. The inner wall load bearing surfaces and non-load bearing interior surfaces of the vessel may be manufactured from a host polymer that has antimicrobial organo-metallic additives which form a solid-solution with the host polymer and are distributed homogeneously throughout the host polymer. The host polymer matrix may be an organic material, an inorganic material or an organic-inorganic material blend. The antimicrobial agent polymer matrix may be located in localized zones within the vessel. It is well known to provide vessels for storing or transporting liquids. For example, stationary water-based liquids vessel structures such as cisterns, rain barrels and portable vessels such as bottles and multi-gallon jugs are often used to transport and/or store liquids. During use, these vessels have the potential to become contaminated with disease causing agents. As a result, antimicrobial containing vessels have been created, some having purification, disinfecting and/or sanitization pathways, which help the purification, disinfecting and/or sanitization of liquid for portable use (such as drinking bottles, etc.), private homes, businesses, and public facilities. Examples of existing art appear in numerous products. In-home activated carbon based filter systems use carbon to filter particulate matter from the liquid, but do not offer sanitation, relying on the antimicrobial functioning of chlorine additives. Reverse osmosis devices require high pressure to force water flow through membranes. None of these methods are useful in producing sanitized water in water storage tanks. Chlorine and similar additives can offer sanitation functionality, but they require maintaining appropriate chemical levels in the liquid. Present water-based liquid purification systems generally rely on activated carbon filters, chlorine and similar additives, reverse osmosis devices, etc. Although these methods have demonstrated some utility, they typically suffer from several limitations of which the following are the most often cited: 1) limited life expectancy of the vessel; 2) high initial system costs; 3) the vessels generally do not confer significant antimicrobial resistance; 4) narrow range of effectiveness against anti-microbial agents; 5) toxic to viruses and molds with potential toxicity to humans at the levels employed; 6) minimal portability for systems providing high efficacy performance; 7) costly system preventive maintenance; 8) costly system consumables; and 9) potential for compromised system performance. An improved water-based liquid vessel which has increased antimicrobial agent activity and overcomes these limitations would play a valuable role in producing a healthier environment, creating a smaller carbon footprint, and enhancing sustainability. Accordingly, the present water-based liquid vessel is provided. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION A liquid purification system is provided. Although not limited to water, the purification system is especially suitable for water. The purification system utilizes a vessel having antimicrobial inner wall load bearing surfaces and/or antimicrobial (antibacterial, anti-fungal, anti-mold, etc.) interior non-load bearing surfaces. When the liquid moves within the vessel and contacts the antimicrobial surfaces, the liquid becomes purified, disinfected or sanitized. The inner wall load bearing surfaces and non-load bearing interior surfaces of the vessel may be manufactured from a host polymer that has antimicrobial organo-metallic additives which form a solid-solution with the host polymer and are distributed homogeneously throughout the host polymer. The host polymer matrix may be an organic material, an inorganic material or an organic-inorganic material blend. Furthermore, the host material may be, for example, paper, cement, concrete, ceramic or a combination thereof. For example, the paper host may be manufactured similarly to pleated cellulose paper cartridge filters (for example, OmniFilter Pleated Paper Filters™) which contain an organo-metallic additive. Similarly, the cement, concrete and/or ceramic materials may contain the organo-metallic additives. It should be understood that other materials may be used as well. The antimicrobial agent polymer matrix may be located in localized zones within the vessel. As a result, the present device increases the surface area of the antimicrobial agent and polymer matrix beyond that exhibited solely by the vessel walls. The terms vessel, container, basin, tank, cistern, bottle, jug and/or reservoir are used interchangeably throughout this document and are used to describe a structure which is used to contain a liquid or a purification pathway for flowing liquids such as but not limited to a cartridge, tube or pipe. Further the cartridge, tube or pipe may have a region referred to as a zone. Zones define localization of the antimicrobial purification components such as but not limited to particulates, pellets, membranes, rings, fibers, threads, sheets, and ribbons. The purification components in the zone may be positioned between at least one plate that serves to keep the components localized in the vessel. The plate may permit liquid transfer and passage via openings, pores, and holes. The present vessel may contain more than one zone with each zone having similar components or different components. In an embodiment, the present device may further have sensors which monitor, for example, pH of the liquid. The terms sanitization, disinfecting and purification are used interchangeably to describe the function of reducing the level of microbial material in the liquid. In an embodiment, the present system may have liquid purification components, sensing devices, communications links, and energy systems. The vessel and liquid purification components may be fabricated using single-metal or multi-metal blends of organo-metallic polymers dispersed throughout a host polymer matrix to provide an increased antimicrobial surface area for sanitizing the liquid. The vessel and (water-based) liquid purification components may be fabricated so as to provide multiple final product form factors which yield optimal sanitization of the liquid e.g., antimicrobial functionality. The organo-metallic polymers may be hydrocarbon based chemical moieties chemically bonded to metals such as silver (Ag), copper (Cu), and zinc (Zn). The chemical structures of these elements may provide for enhanced miscibility throughout the host polymer matrix with low solubility in the liquid and limited leaching into the liquid. For the purposes of this system, the term “sparingly soluble in water” as stated below refers to a substance having a solubility of 0.1 g per 100 ml of water to 1 g per 100 ml of water. Unless specified otherwise, the term “sparingly soluble” and “sparingly soluble in water” are used interchangeably in the description of the invention below to refer to substances that are sparingly soluble in water. Still another advantage of the present device is to provide a water-based purification system which has a vent hole for allowing a user to control the pressure within the vessel. And another advantage of the present device is to provide a water-based liquid purification system which has an optional cover located on the top of the vessel. Yet another advantage of the present water-based liquid purification system is that the present system may have specialized zones which each help purify the water in different aspects. And yet another advantage of the present device is to provide a water-based liquid purification system which may be used on juices or other liquids. Still another advantage of the present device is to provide a water-based liquid purification system which sanitizes and/or purifies and stores the liquid and maintains the purity level of stored water-based liquid at a desired level with respect to relative mandated governmental thresholds. Yet another advantage of the present device is to provide a water-based purification system which is comprised of electrical, mechanical, and optical sub-systems which work in unison to purify a liquid. And another advantage of the present water-based liquid purification system is that the present system may have liquid purification components, sensing devices, communications links, and energy systems. Yet another advantage of the present water-based liquid purification system is to provide a device which uses energy from the electrical power grid or from harvesting of solar, wind, thermal, or vibrational energy. The energy system may also incorporate an energy storage device such as, for example, a battery, capacitor or battery connected to a capacitor.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS A liquid purification system is provided. Although not limited to water, the purification system is especially suitable for water. The purification system utilizes a vessel having antimicrobial inner load bearing wall surfaces and/or antimicrobial (antibacterial, anti-fungal, anti-mold, etc.) interior non-load bearing surfaces. When the liquid moves within the vessel and contacts the antimicrobial surfaces, the liquid becomes purified or sanitized. The inner wall load bearing surfaces and non-load bearing interior surfaces of the vessel may be manufactured from a host polymer that has antimicrobial organo-metallic additives which form a solid-solution with the host polymer and are distributed homogeneously throughout the host polymer. The host polymer matrix may be an organic material, an inorganic material or an organic-inorganic material blend. The antimicrobial agent polymer matrix may be located in localized zones within the vessel. Referring now to the figures, FIG. 1 generally illustrates an example of a vessel 1 of the present device. In an embodiment, the vessel 1 may have a top 2, a bottom 3, a front 4, a back 5, a first side 6, a second side 7 and an interior 8. In an embodiment, the vessel 1 is a pipe. Located on, for example, the top 2 of the vessel 1 may be a liquid inlet valve 10. The liquid inlet valve 10 may have a control knob 11 which allows a user to selectively open or close the liquid inlet valve 10. When the liquid inlet valve 10 is on the open position, the liquid inlet valve 10 may be in communication with the interior 8 of the vessel such that a liquid 20 (or gas) may pass through an interior channel 12 of the liquid inlet valve 10 to the interior 8 of the vessel 1. In another embodiment, the inlet valve 10 may be on any surface of vessel 1. In an embodiment, the vessel 1 may be made largely from a host polymer material 90 which integrates an organo-metallic element 100. In particular, host polymer material 90 may be made from, for example, thermoplastics, such as, polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polycarbonate (PC), polystyrene (PS), polyamide (PA), polybutylene terephthalate (PBT), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), thermoplastic elastomer (TPE), or wax (e.g., paraffin). Further, the host polymer material 90 may be made from, for example, thermoset plastics, such as epoxy, phenolic, cyanate ester, bismaleimide, polyimide, acrylic, powder coats, silicone, urethane, latex or plastic coatings (such as polyurethanes, etc.) or fiber reinforced plastics, such as fiber glass, etc. In an embodiment, the organo-metallic element 100 may contain, for example, silver (Ag), copper (Cu) and/or zinc (Zn). The vessel 1 may be manufactured using conventional manufacturing equipment. The host polymer material 90 may contain a single metal type of an organo-metallic element 100 or a blend of various organo-metallic elements 100 dispersed throughout the host polymer material 90 wherein some of the organo-metallic elements 100 reside on all the surfaces of the vessel 1. Preferably, the organo-metallic elements 100 may be uniformly distributed throughout the host polymer material 90 and on its surfaces. In an embodiment, the host polymer material 90 containing the organo-metallic elements 100 may be located on less than all the interior 8 surfaces of the vessel 1. For example, the side walls may be standard metal or plastic whereas the bottom 3 surface may be made from the host polymer material 90 containing the organo-metallic element 100. In another embodiment, the host polymer material 90 may be added to the interior surfaces of the vessel 1 as a coating. In an embodiment, the host material 90 may be, for example, paper, cement, concrete and/or ceramic materials. For example, the paper host may be manufactured similarly to pleated cellulose paper cartridge filters (for example, OmniFilter Pleated Paper Filters™) which contain an organo-metallic additive. Similarly, the cement, concrete and/or ceramic materials may contain the organo-metallic additives. As a result, the interior 8 (and exterior) surfaces of the vessel 1 will contain the organo-metallic elements 100 embedded within the host polymer material 90. When the liquid 20 is introduced into the interior 8 of the vessel 1, the liquid 20 will come into contact with the organo-metallic element 100 of the host polymer material 90 of the interior 8 of the vessel 1 wherein the organo-metallic element 100 may act on the liquid 20 to purify and sanitize the liquid 20, i.e., kill micro-organisms present in the liquid. In an embodiment, the vessel 1 may be made predominantly of a standard metal such as aluminum or steel (lacking the organo-metallic elements) and coated thereafter. In this embodiment, the interior 8 surfaces of the vessel 1 may be coated with a laminated film 40 or coating containing the organo-metallic elements 100. For example, powder coating or painting may be used. As a result, any liquid 20 within the interior 8 of the vessel 1 may still come into contact with the organo-metallic elements of the device 1. Preferably, in this embodiment, substantially the entire interior 8 surfaces of the vessel 1 are coated so as to increase the surface area for contact with the liquid 20 and therein increasing the purification and sterilization process. The first side 6 and the second side 7 of the vessel 1 may provide substantial structural integrity for the vessel 1. Preferably, the host polymer material 90 of the vessel 1 is at least 0.01 mm thick whereas in the coating embodiment, coating thickness is generally less than 5 mm. Located on, for example, the first side 6 or second side 7 of the vessel 1 may be, for example, a liquid outlet valve 30. In an embodiment, the liquid outlet valve 30 is located in a lower position with respect to the ground than the liquid inlet valve 10 such that gravity and or pumps may allow the flowing of the liquid 20 from the liquid inlet valve 10, through to the interior 8 of the vessel 1 and then ultimately out of the interior 8 of the vessel 1 through a channel 31 of the liquid outlet valve 30. A control knob 32 located on the liquid outlet valve 30 may allow a user to selectively control the liquid outlet valve 30. In another embodiment, the liquid outlet valve 30 may be located on any surface of vessel 1. For example, if the vessel 1 is a water heater or connected to a water heater the liquid outlet valve 30 may be located on the top 2 of the vessel 1. In an embodiment, a vent hole 35 may be located on, for example, the top 2 of the vessel 1. The vent hole 35 may allow a user to control the pressure within the interior 8 of the vessel 1 by selectively allowing the exchange of gas between the interior 8 of the vessel 1 and the atmosphere. Further, the vent hole 35 may function like a poppet valve to prevent outside air from entering the vessel 1 when atmospheric equilibrium has been reached. In addition, the vent hole 35 may further allow a user to gain easy access to the interior 8 of the vessel 1. Also located on the top 2 of the vessel 1 may be, for example, an optional vessel cover 36 (FIG. 2). The vessel cover 36 may contain a single metal type of an organo-metallic element 100 or a blend of various organo-metallic elements 100 dispersed throughout the host polymer material 90 wherein some of the organo-metallic elements 100 reside on the surfaces of the vessel 1. The vessel cover 36 is shown at the top 2 of the vessel 1, but may be positioned at, for example, the bottom 3 of the vessel 1 or as part of one of the sides. The vessel cover 36 may prevent outside atmospheric pressure and/or gases and particulates (for example dust, pollen, etc.) from entering the interior of the vessel 1 through the vent hole 35, or, when removed from the vessel 1, the vessel cover 36 may allow outside atmospheric gases and particulates (for example dust, pollen, etc.) to enter the interior of the vessel 1. Referring now to FIG. 2A, in an embodiment, the vessel 1 may have non-load bearing liquid purification components 120 located substantially or entirely within the interior 8 of the vessel 1. In an embodiment, the total surface area of the non-load bearing liquid purification components 120 located within the interior 8 of the vessel 1 is greater than 10% of the total surface area of the load bearing internal surface of the vessel 1. These non-load bearing liquid purification components 120 may be placed within the interior 8 of the vessel 1. The non-load bearing liquid purification components 120 may increase the surface area for the liquid 20 to contact the organo-metallic elements 100. The non-load bearing liquid purification components 120 may be fabricated from the host polymer material 90 which integrates the organo-metallic elements 100 comprised of metals, such as but not limited to, silver (Ag), copper (Cu), and zinc (Zn). Further, in an embodiment, the host material 90 may be, for example, paper, cement, concrete and/or ceramic materials. The non-load bearing liquid purification components 120 may be processed using conventional manufacturing equipment having as an example, but not limited to, components of polymer based structural bulks, films, sheets, coatings, and multi-layer composites. The non-load bearing liquid purification components 120 may be solid or porous. In an embodiment, the non-load bearing liquid purification components 120 and/or the liquid 20 is stirred or agitated by a rotating blade 44 connected to a power source wherein the rotating blade 44 increases purification kinetics and increase the effectiveness of the purification process. The non-load bearing liquid purification components 120 may have various shapes and formats such as but not limited to rods, fibers, threads, tree-shaped, weaves, rings, balls or other designs. The non-load bearing liquid purification components 120 made of the organo-metallic elements 100 may be porous so as to increase the surface area for interaction between the liquid 20 and the organo-metallic elements 100 so as to maximize purification and/or sterilization of the liquid 20. In an embodiment the non-load bearing liquid purification components 120 may be stationary or may move within the interior 8 of the vessel 1. More specifically, in the moving embodiment, the non-load bearing liquid purification components 120 may move freely within a predefined zone 725 or may be moved by predetermined mechanical means. Further, various sized non-load bearing liquid purification components 120 may be used within the interior 8 of the same vessel 1. Predefined zone 725 may be oriented horizontally, vertically or some combination of horizontal and vertical. Further, the non-load bearing liquid purification components 120 may be shaped as packing materials (e.g. Raschig rings) used to force the liquid 20 to take complicated paths through the interior 8 of the vessel 1, thereby further increasing the surface area for contact between the liquid 20 and the antimicrobial properties of the organo-metallic elements 100 of the host polymer material 90. These non-load bearing purification components 120 may form zones 725. In an embodiment, the packing materials may be a smooth or corrugated metal, a molded ceramic, or a molded plastic which has been coated with or is comprised of the organo-metallic elements 100 which inherently has the antimicrobial properties. Furthermore, the smooth or corrugated metal, molded ceramic and molded plastic may be porous. Moreover, the components may be stationary, non-moving, or moved via environmental perturbations such as wind, thermal gradients, or moved via a motor which is powered via electricity which is generated and stored via environmental perturbations, off-grid supplied electrical energy (e.g. solar, thermoelectric, piezoelectric, etc.) or grid supplied electrical energy. Moving the components or stirring the liquid increases the liquid purification kinetics. In an embodiment, the non-load bearing liquid purification components 120 may be positioned between, for example, at least one plate 130 which serves to keep the non-load bearing liquid purification components 120 localized within a predetermined zone 725 of the interior 8 of the vessel 1. Furthermore, in an embodiment, several zones 725 may be present within the interior 8 of the vessel 1. More specifically, the plates 130 may be secured to an interior wall or the interior top or bottom of the vessel 1. The non-load bearing liquid purification components 120 may therein be secured between two or more plates 130 or between a single plate 130 and an interior surface of the vessel 1. As a result, the non-load bearing liquid purification components 120 may be prevented from moving freely within the interior 8 of the vessel 1; therein preventing the non-load bearing liquid purification components 120 from accidently leaving the interior 8 of the vessel 1 through, for example, the liquid outlet valve 30. In an embodiment, the non-load bearing liquid purification components 120 may be, for example, shaped as pellets, spheres, flakes, particulates, filters from woven or non-woven fibers, porous membranes or any other suitable shape. Referring now to FIG. 11, as mentioned above, the interior 8 of the vessel 1 may have predetermined zones 725 for securing the non-load bearing liquid purification components 120. In an embodiment, the predetermined zones 725 may be defined by walls 726 having openings 727. In particular, these walls 726 may resemble, for example, non-corrosive chicken wire, screening, perforated sheet, etc. The opening 727 of the walls 726 may be smaller than the non-load bearing liquid purification components 120 so that the non-load bearing liquid purification components 120 cannot escape from or move through the openings 727 of the walls 726 of the predetermined zones 725, while still allowing liquid 20 to flow through it. In an embodiment, the predetermined zones 725 may extend substantially parallel with the top 2 and the bottom 3 of the vessel 1. More specifically, the zones 725 may extend from the first 6 to the second side 7 of the interior 8 of the vessel 1 such that as the liquid 20 moves from the top 2 (where the inlet valve 10 may be located) to the bottom 3 of the vessel 1, the liquid 20 must pass through the predetermined zone 725 where it is exposed to the non-load bearing liquid purification components 120 and thus purified. In an alternative embodiment, the predetermined zone 725 may run vertically (FIG. 2) as long as the liquid inlet valve 10 is on the opposite side of the zone 725 as the liquid outlet valve 30 such that the liquid 20 must pass through the zone 725 prior to exiting the interior 8 of the vessel 1. In an embodiment, the non-load bearing liquid purification components 120 are tightly packed within the zones 725 so as to maximize the surface area in which the liquid 20 is exposed to and thus increasing the purification process. In an embodiment, the vessel 1 may have a sensor 150 located, for example, within the interior 8 of the vessel 1, which monitors at least one attribute of the water-based liquid 20 such as, but not limited to, microbe concentration (bacteria, fungus, mold, etc.) salinity, temperature, pH, etc. The sensor 150 may be powered by environmental perturbations such as wind, thermal gradients, etc., off-grid supplied electrical energy (e.g. solar), or grid supplied electrical energy. In an embodiment, the device 1 may have an electrical circuit 151 electrically connected to the sensor 150 wherein the electrical circuit 151 transmits electrical information to a remote computer 152. Information may also be transmitted to a remote computer 152 by radio, RF, optical or other means. In embodiments, the electrical signals may be encrypted or non-encrypted. A variety of existing wireless communications protocols may be used such as, but not limited to, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, ZigBee, or IEEE 802.11. Further, the communications link may be always-on or have a sleep mode attribute depending on the system power budget design. While the sensor 150 may be in contact with the liquid, the electrical circuit 151 may be located inside vessel 1 or outside vessel 1 and connected to the sensor 150 via wiring. In an embodiment, device 1 may be powered by an energy system 175 which receives energy from the electrical power grid or from harvesting of solar, wind, thermal, or vibrational energy. The energy system 175 may also incorporate an energy storage device 176 such as a battery, capacitor or a battery connected to a capacitor 177. The metals selected to be used as the organo-metallic element 100 of the device 1 are selected based on the inherent antimicrobial physical properties of the metals (e.g. anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, anti-mold, etc.). In particular, the metals used as the organo-metallic elements 100 may be chosen from the categories of transition metals, post-transition metals, metalloids, lanthanides, actinides, alkaline earth metals, and alkali metals. In addition to the use of silver, copper and zinc mentioned above, or possible metals used as the organo-metallic element 100 may include alkali and alkali earth materials and similar elements from the left-side of the Periodic Table of the Chemical Elements, including, but are not limited to lithium (Li), sodium (Na), potassium (K), rubidium (Rb) cesium (Cs), beryllium (Be), magnesium (Mg), calcium (Ca), strontium (Sr), and barium (Ba). An additional class of materials can be formed as organic-non-metallic systems from halogens and similar elements from the right-side of the Periodic Table of the Chemical Elements, including, but are not limited to fluorine (F), chorine (Cl), bromine (Br), iodine (I), sulfur (S), selenium (Se), and phosphorus (P). In an embodiment, the host polymer material 90 is made predominantly from thermoplastics and thermosets. More specifically, the host polymer material 90 may be embedded with the organo-metallic elements 100. The host polymer material 90 systems may be comprised of a stable dispersion (emulsion) of polymer microparticles in an aqueous medium such as, but not limited to natural and synthetic latexes. The host matrix polymer may be a single polymer, a polymer blend, a co-polymer, or a co-polymer blend. Preferably the host polymer material 90 is formulated to achieve specific materials properties e.g. optical (clarity, refractive index, etc), mechanical (glass transition temperature, coefficient of thermal expansion, modulus, toughness, adhesion, etc), electrical (dielectric strength, etc) as required for optimal end product performance. The vessel 1 may be made from, as an example, but not limited to: bulks, films, sheets, coatings, and multi-layer composites containing an organo-metallic element 100 comprised of a metal such as but not limited to copper (Cu), silver (Ag), gold (Au), iridium (Ir), palladium (Pd), platinum (Pt), iron (Fe), nickel (Ni), cobalt (Co), zinc (Zn), niobium (Nb), ruthenium (Ru), rhodium (Rh), tellurium (Te), antimony (Sb), bismuth (Bi), tin (Sn), gallium (Ga), indium (In), titanium (Ti), vanadium (V), chromium, (Cr), manganese (Mn), molybdenum (Mo), tungsten (W), tantalum (Ta), hafnium (Hf), zirconium (Zr), scandium (Sc), and yttrium (Y) in a host matrix polymer comprised of at least one of the following thermoplastics such as but not limited to polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polycarbonate (PC), polystyrene (PS), polyamides (PA), polybutylene terephthalate (PBT), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), thermoplastic elastomer (TPE), fiber reinforced polymer (e.g. fiberglass, etc) and/or wax (e.g. paraffin). Alternatively, the vessel 1 may be made from, as an example, but not limited to: bulks, films, sheets, coatings, and multi-layer composites containing an organo-metallic element 100 comprised of a metal such as but not limited to copper (Cu), silver (Ag), gold (Au), iridium (Ir), palladium (Pd), platinum (Pt), iron (Fe), nickel (Ni), cobalt (Co), zinc (Zn), niobium (Nb), ruthenium (Ru), rhodium (Rh), tellurium (Te), antimony (Sb), bismuth (Bi), tin (Sn), gallium (Ga), indium (In), titanium (Ti), vanadium (V), chromium, (Cr), manganese (Mn), molybdenum (Mo), tungsten (W), tantalum (Ta), hafnium (Hf), zirconium (Zr), scandium (Sc), and yttrium (Y) dispersed into a thermoset such as but not limited to epoxies, phenolics, cyanate esters, bismaleimides, polyimides, acrylics, powder coats, fiber reinforced polymer (e.g. fiberglass, etc), silicones, urethanes and latexes. The non-load bearing liquid purification components 120 may be made from, as an example, but not limited to: bulks, films, sheets, coatings, and multi-layer composites containing organo-metallics comprised of a metal such as but not limited to copper (Cu), silver (Ag), gold (Au), iridium (Ir), palladium (Pd), platinum (Pt), iron (Fe), nickel (Ni), cobalt (Co), zinc (Zn), niobium (Nb), ruthenium (Ru), rhodium (Rh), tellurium (Te), antimony (Sb), bismuth (Bi), tin (Sn), gallium (Ga), indium (In), titanium (Ti), vanadium (V), chromium, (Cr), manganese (Mn), molybdenum (Mo), tungsten (W), tantalum (Ta), hafnium (Hf), zirconium (Zr), scandium (Sc), and yttrium (Y) in a host matrix polymer comprised of at least one of the following thermoplastics such as but not limited to polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polycarbonate (PC), polystyrene (PS), polyamides (PA), polybutylene terephthalate (PBT), and polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyvinyl chloride (PVC) thermoplastic elastomer (TPE), fiber reinforced polymer (e.g., fiberglass, etc.) and wax (e.g. paraffin).

The non-load bearing liquid purification components 120 may be constructed of the same material (the matrix) as the load-bearing liquid purification components of the vessel 1. In particular, the material used to create, for example, the sphere 400 in FIG. 3 may be the same material (the matrix) used to create the top, the bottom and the walls of the vessel 1 of FIG. 1. In an embodiment, a plurality of spheres 400 may be located within the interior 8 of the vessel 1 so as to increase the surface area which contacts and, thus purifies the liquid 20.

The rod 425 may be secured onto the cylindrical pole 435 by, for example, an adhesive, gravity, mechanically and/or friction. When the rod 425 is secured onto the cylindrical pole 435, the rod 425 may be secured in place within the interior 8 of the vessel 1 and thus prevented from moving. In an embodiment, multiple rods 425 may be used in the interior 8 of the same vessel 1. Furthermore, the rod 425 may have a hole along its axis so that it functions as a tube or a pipe, or it may have holes perforating it perpendicular to the axis or at some angle to the axis to encourage water flow through multiple pathways, or the surface may be dimpled like a golf ball or have a roughened surface to increase the surface area in contact with flowing water (or other liquid such as a juice). In an embodiment, the rod 425 has an external diameter 440. In an embodiment, the vessel 1 is cylindrical having an internal diameter 441.

More specifically, the smaller thinner branch portions 452 may be small enough so as to fit through the openings 727 while the main body of the base having branches 450 is still secured within the predetermined zones 725. As a result, more of these tree-shaped non-load bearing purification components 120 may be secured within the predetermined zone 725 of the vessel 1 then would otherwise be able to fit if the entire non-load bearing liquid purification component 120 had to fit completely within the predetermined zones 725.

In the hexagon 480 configuration, the six sides of the hexagon 480 may have the organo-metallic element 100 which acts upon the liquid 20 and therein may allow for increased surface area for interacting with and treating the liquid 20 while at the same time not allowing the full rotation of the non-load bearing liquid purification components 120 as would otherwise occur in a spherical non-load bearing liquid purification component 120. As a result, a user may better control the movement of the non-load bearing liquid purification components 120. Preferably, the ratio between the surface area of the hexagon 480 and the internal surface area of the cylindrical vessel 1 is between 0.1 and 0.9.

In an embodiment, the preferred organo-metallic antimicrobial additive of the present device 1 may be an organo-metallic antimicrobial additive based on stearate chemistry. The metal components may be those listed above for use with the organo-metallic antimicrobial additives. In an embodiment, the preferred organo-metallics antimicrobial additives may be copper stearate, silver stearate and zinc stearate or blends of two or three of these additives. These stearate based organo-metallic antimicrobial additives may be preferable for use in the device 1 as they are water insoluble or sparingly soluble in water and are comprised of a long-chain fatty acid group, and wherein a majority of metallic species dispersed throughout the host matrix are in the one or more antimicrobial organo-metallic antimicrobial additives. As a result, the physical structures of the load bearing walls or the non-load bearing structures will not be compromised by the organo-metallic antimicrobial additives washing away with the fluid held within the container. Instead, the organo-metallic antimicrobial additives remain within the host matrix permanently and the device may be used over and over. To demonstrate the functionality of the present liquid purification system, a test was assembled and performed. To form the liquid sanitizing medium, two types of polypropylene rod-like pellets containing the organo-metallic antimicrobial additives were formed via conventional thermal extrusion processes, wherein the rod-like cylindrical pellets had dimensions of approximately 1 mm in diameter and approximately 2 mm in length. One type of polypropylene pellet contained about 2 percent by volume of copper stearate and the other type of polypropylene pellet contained about 10 percent by volume of copper stearate. Since both samples were formed using thermal extrusion processes, the copper stearate of both was uniformly distributed throughout the rod-like cylindrical pellets bulk, and did not reside on only the surface of the rod-like cylindrical pellet. As a result, the rod-like cylindrical pellets were able to continue to work even if the surface of the rod-like cylindrical pellets eroded (for example, by abrasion) as the newly exposed under-surface of the rod-like cylindrical pellets also contain copper stearate mixed evenly within for providing the antimicrobial functionality Other fabrication techniques which distribute the copper stearate throughout the pellets bulk could be used as well. A simple single-stage filter system was constructed to control the flow of the liquid (in this case water) across the rod-like cylindrical pellet's surfaces. The rod-like cylindrical pellets were entrapped within the interior of a plastic (PVC) cylindrical tube section approximately four inches in length and approximately two inches in diameter. The two inch diameter cylindrical tube was longer than the section entrapping the filter medium (the organo-metallic rod-like pellet), so that the liquid (water) was moved from a first opening of the PVC to a second opening of the PVC wherein the liquid was forced to flow past and interact with the rod-like cylindrical pellet containing the organo-metallic antimicrobial additives. The water flow used gravity (i.e., a gravity-fed system) to convey the water from the first end to the second end. The test water was autoclaved distilled water inoculated with E. coli (ATCC8739). The nutrient plates were Lysogeny Broth (LB) (10 g of tryptone, 5 g of yeast, and 10 g of NaCl with 800 ml of water) in Petri dishes. Colony Forming Units (CFU) were counted after 24 hours and 48 hours incubation. Test water containing E. coli was poured through the PVC cylindrical tube filter (at a flow rate of approximately 2 liters/minute) and collected at the exit point following a single pass (i.e., the water was only filtered one time). The E. coli water was passed through filter units containing polypropylene pellets with copper stearate at loading levels at either 0%, 2% or 10% pellets. After passing through their respective filter elements the test water was incubated on the nutrient plates for 24 hours and 48 hours and the CFUs counted to determine filter element performance. Ten nutrient plates were incubated for each type of filter element, the CFUs were counted for each nutrient plate and the results are reported after 48 hours in Table 1. Demonstrating the efficacy of the filter system, the polypropylene pellets containing 2% or 10% copper stearate killed all the E. coli in the water flowing through the PVC filer element containing the rod-like cylindrical pellets having the organo-metallic antimicrobial additives. TABLE 1 0% Loading 2% Loading 10% Loading E. coli CFU 52 0 0 It is well known that copper is a fungicidal agent. For example, United States Patent Publication No.: 2008/0004177 to Pfeiffer et al. entitled: “Novel Copper-Containing Formulations”, discloses fungicidal agrochemical compositions using copper-containing fungicidal formulations. One of the copper containing agents listed in that publication is copper stearate. However, the Pfieffer publication does not disclose the use of copper as an antimicrobial agent. In fact, in that publication, the method discloses only the use of commercial bactericides, rather than making use of the antimicrobial properties of copper stearate. Furthermore, in the Pfeiffer publication there is no disclose of the use of the copper-containing agent embedded in a host system, for example a polymer, ceramic, concrete, paper, etc. to provide antimicrobial functionality in a water environment for sanitizing water. U.S. Pat. No. 8,409,598 to Hishida entitled: “Copper Ion-Producing Compositions” discloses a water purification material system using copper ions. The copper ions are produced from metallic copper powder coated with a water-soluble acidic material. In the present application, copper metal is not used, and the antimicrobial activity arises strictly from the copper stearate, which is not a material system identified in the Hishida patent. Furthermore, the performance of the copper stearate systems on E. coli in the present application is equivalent or better than that demonstrated by Hishida in Table 9. The present purification system may reduce the concentration of microbes in a liquid by approximately 99% or greater.
