Process C
Compound 24A
Sodium cyanoborohydride (4.72 g, 75.1 mmol) was added portionwise to a solution of 5-hydroxy-1H-indole (4 g, 30 mmol) in acetic acid (120 ml). The reaction solution was stirred at 25 Â°C for 12 hours, and then rotary evaporated to remove the solvent, the residue was dissolved in ethyl acetate (200 ml), and washed with saturated sodium bicarbonate. The aqueous layer was extracted with ethyl acetate (3 x 150 ml). The organic layers were combined and washed with saturated NaCl solution, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered and evaporated to dryness. The residue was purified by column chromatography (petroleum ether/ethyl acetate = 3: 1, Rf = 0.3) to give compound 24A (creamy white solid, 1.3 g, 32%).
