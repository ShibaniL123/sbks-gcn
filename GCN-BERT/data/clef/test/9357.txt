[Step 2] Synthesis of tert-butyl 4-((4-(methoxycarbonyl)benzyl)(phenyl)carbamoyl)piperidine-1-carboxylate
Tert-butyl 4-(phenylcarbamoyl)piperidine-1-carboxylate (1.000 g, 3.285 mmol) synthesized in step 1 was dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (70 mL), and sodium hydride (60.00 %, 0.263 g, 6.571 mmol) was added slowly to the solution while the temperature was maintained at 0°C. The mixture was stirred for 20 minutes, and methyl 4-(bromomethyl)benzoate (0.753 g, 3.285 mmol) was added thereto, followed by additional stirring at 45°C for 12 hours. The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature, and then water (10 mL) was added to the reaction mixture at 0°C, followed by stirring for 5 minutes. After completion of the reaction, water was added to the reaction mixture, followed by extraction with ethyl acetate. The extract was filtered through a plastic filter to remove the solid residue and the aqueous layer, and then concentrated under reduced pressure. The concentrate was purified by column chromatography (SiO2, 120 g cartridge; ethyl acetate/hexane = from 5% to 50%) and concentrated to give the title compound (1.300 g, 87.4 %) as colorless oil.
