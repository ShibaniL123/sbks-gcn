BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates generally to a device for use in connection with rehabilitation therapy and general exercise. More specifically, the present invention relates to an exercise platform that includes a varied and interchangeable user interface mounted to a base platform that facilitates proper exercise support and positioning while simultaneously working a broad range of muscle groups. It is well known in the art that therapeutic exercise is important and is widely accepted as a means for treating and relieving a variety of human disabilities. Additionally, exercise plays a crucial role in the rehabilitation of patients suffering from various injuries. A physical therapist's role in such a rehabilitative context is to provide rehabilitative professional care that individually tailors exercise programs to meet a patient's needs. These tailored rehabilitative exercise programs differ depending on the type and amount of damage to the injured area, stage of tissue healing, age of the person, and prior level of function of the individual prior to injury. Some of the most common early rehabilitation methods consist of isometric exercise, continuous passive motion (CPM) machines and/or active assisted range of motion (ROM) performed by a therapist on a patient. While isometric exercise is a good way to initiate strength into newly repaired tissue, the benefits are limited in that such fixed motion therapies as are provided through CPM are too concentrated requiring that ROM exercises also be implemented in order for the patient to normal or pre-surgical levels of movement. The problem with therapist implemented ROM, however, is that such therapy is labor intensive, costly and infrequent. This then requires a return to a set of limited exercises being given to patients for a home program that consists usually, but not solely, of isometric muscle setting exercises. These exercises generally do not involve sufficient ranges of joint movement and therefore have limited benefit in the rehabilitative setting. Additionally, exercises that are usually instituted later in the rehabilitation process utilize a resistive band and may provide less stability to the joint making them generally less comfortable, therefore, usually yielding less patient compliance. Finally, patients may be given a variety of exercises that involve open and closed chain activity. These can place an unwanted compressive or shear force on the joints should they be performed incorrectly. In other contexts beyond rehabilitative therapy, regular exercise is also known to keep the body in good shape, but not all such exercise is equally effective. In fact, many of the exercise devices that are marketed or provided in health and athletic clubs, are actually less effective than people realize. That is not to say that the majority of the exercise equipment that is provided in health clubs is not beneficial provided that the user gets proper instruction under the guidance of a trainer. The primary issue is that most of the equipment employed in health clubs trains using predominantly linear, single plane movement and as a result is limited to isolating one muscle group while allowing other muscle groups to rest. Examples of this type of exercise can be put into two categories. The first is the leg press, a closed chain activity and the second exercise is the leg extension, which is an open chain exercise. Generally, neither of these exercises is considered ideal for knee or hip rehabilitation. While, this type of training may be appropriate for an athlete or one who has a balanced workout regimen, this type of isolated, open chain, planar movement is not how the body typically moves in reality. Ultimately, in either of the rehabilitative or exercise contexts it must be understood that the body rarely moves in just one plane. Often the body must employ multiple muscle groups and balance them in a cooperative fashion to reach the desired end result. Further, most body movement involves rotation and diagonal patterns of movement. For example, taking a step requires combined movements of plantar flexion, internal hip rotation, foot pronation/supination, knee extension and hip extension. The difficulty of the overall problem can be seen in the fact that if the human body only moved in single planes it would be easy to construct a mechanical hand, foot or leg that mirrors human movement. However, it is very difficult to replicate such realistic human movement because it is not defined through such one or two-dimensional movements. The complex nature of human movement has created a specialized field of Proprioceptive Neurofacilitation (PNF) within physical medicine. PNF believes that the best form of rehabilitation for musculoskeletal injuries is implemented using diagonal patterns through multiple planes of movement. However, this treatment technique requires a purely hands-on, manual approach and is extremely demanding of therapist skill and training. The therapist presently practicing PNF must personally take the patient through the motions and provide appropriate resistance for the patient's need and present physical limitations. Accordingly, there is a need in the therapeutic and/or conditioning exercise equipment art for an apparatus that provides structured, multiaxial, multi-pattern movement that aids in rehabilitation or enhances conditioning. Further, there is a need for an apparatus that provides structured, multiaxial, multi-pattern movement that would allow the patient to control for different muscle patterns and that that can be employed equally by the average healthy person or someone recovering from hip, knee or ankle injury. Further still, there is a need for a device that enables a user to obtain multidimensional exercise that also provides multiple embodiments and would allow the user to progress toward full rehabilitation through the isolation of muscle groups by mirroring the difficulty and complexity of movement. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In this regard, the present invention generally provides a therapeutic and/or exercise apparatus that provides structured, multiaxial, multi-pattern movement that aids in rehabilitation or enhances conditioning. By using the apparatus of the present invention an average healthy person or a patient recovering from hip, knee or ankle injury can equally participate in exercise and rehabilitation activities targeted to different muscle groups and exercise patterns. As a result, the apparatus of the present invention enables a user to obtain multidimensional exercise that allows the user to progress toward full rehabilitation through the isolation of muscle groups by mirroring the difficulty and complexity of realistic human movement. The apparatus of the present invention generally includes a base portion and a handrail or support bar that is attached to and extends upwardly from the base portion. The support bar is affixed to a top surface of the base portion and can be removable or collapsible for ease of storage. The support bar serves to assist the user in maintaining correct support and/or body alignment during exercise activities. The base portion interfaces on a bottom surface with a floor or other stable surface, while the top surface includes one or more regions that provide a variety of surfaces for balance training and other proprioceptive tools. This feature of the present invention provides a much more balanced exercise process while also naturally working the entire set of muscle groups related to the exercise rather than simply isolating a single motion or muscle. Further, the present invention provides for attachment points on the base portion that allow various resistive or constant motion assemblies to be attached. In this regard, resistive bands, pulleys, handles, cables and various combinations thereof can be attached that are employed in various different exercises while the user is positioned on the base portion. Bands are employed for constant resistive exercises while a single resistance band may be used in combination with one or more pulley to create variable resistance exercises. Further the pulleys and cables may be arranged in a looped manner that allows a constant motion type exercise. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a therapeutic and/or conditioning exercise equipment art for an apparatus that provides structured, multiaxial, multi-pattern movement that aids in rehabilitation or enhances conditioning. It is a further object of the present invention to provide an apparatus that provides structured, multiaxial, multi-pattern movement that requires the user to employ a full and free range of motion while performing the required exercises. It is still a further object of the present invention to provide an exercise apparatus invention that results in core strengthening through the use of proprioceptive tools that require that broad ranges of muscles be involved in each exercise rather than simply working targeted muscle groups. These together with other objects of the invention, along with various features of novelty that characterize the invention, are pointed out with particularity in the claims annexed hereto and forming a part of this disclosure. For a better understanding of the invention, its operating advantages and the specific objects attained by its uses, reference should be had to the accompanying drawings and descriptive matter in which there is illustrated a preferred embodiment of the invention. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS In the drawings which illustrate the best mode presently contemplated for carrying out the present invention: FIG. 1 is a perspective view of the balance training apparatus of the present invention; and FIG. 2 is a perspective view of an alternate arrangement of the balance training apparatus of the present invention. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Now referring to the drawings, the apparatus of the present invention is generally depicted at FIGS. 1 and 2. As can be seen, the present invention generally provides a therapeutic and/or exercise apparatus for use in performing structured, multiaxial, multi-pattern movement that aids in rehabilitation or enhances conditioning. By using the apparatus of the present invention an average healthy person or a patient recovering from hip, knee or ankle injury can equally participate in exercise and rehabilitation activities targeted to different muscle groups and exercise patterns. As a result, the apparatus of the present invention enables a user to obtain multidimensional exercise that allows the user to progress toward full rehabilitation through the isolation of muscle groups by mirroring the difficulty and complexity of realistic human movement. Turning to FIGS. 1 and 2, the apparatus 10 of the present invention can be seen to generally include a base portion 12 and a support bar 14 that is attached to and extends upwardly from the base portion 12. The support bar 14 is affixed to a top surface 16 of the base portion 12. More preferably, the support bar 14 is affixed to the base portion 14 in a manner that allows it to be easily detached or repositioned for storage. In this regard, the support 14 bar may be fully removable or hingedly attached to the base portion 12 thereby allowing it to be folded against the base portion 12 for storage purposes. The support bar 14 is rigidly affixed to the base portion 12 of the present invention and serves as a reliable structural support to assist the user in maintaining correct support and/or body alignment so that the user can properly execute the various exercise activities. In addition, it can be seen that the height of the support bar 14 may also be adjustable so that the support bar 14 so that it can accommodate users of differing sizes. In operation, a user may hold onto the support bar 14 or lean their front back or side against the support bar 14 to perform exercises. The base portion 12 interfaces on a bottom surface with a floor or other stable surface. Ideally the lower surface of the base portion 12 has a sufficiently wide contact surface that allows the base portion 12 to remain stable throughout various exercise activities. Additionally, the bottom surface of the base portion 12 may include a nonslip surface to keep the apparatus from sliding across the support surface and may further include small feet to support the four corners of the base portion 12. Further, if feet are provided, they may be of the leveling type to further enhance the stability of the base portion 12 when used on uneven support surfaces. The top surface 16 of the base portion 12 includes various interchangeable balance training features thereon. In the preferred embodiment, as depicted in the figures, the base along one side of the support bar 14 may include a soft surface 16 such as foam, memory foam, rubber or an air bladder. The soft surface 16 requires that the user exert fine balance motions while performing exercise thereon. In addition to the soft surface 16 region, the present invention anticipates that other proprioceptive tools can be employed. For example, along the opposing side of the support bar 14 the base includes stepping blocks 18. The stepping blocks 18 may be of differing heights or of uniform height and may further be displaceable a vertical direction. Still further each of the stepping blocks 18 may have a different resistance to vertical displacement to require a user that is progressing across the stepping blocks 18 during the course of an exercise to direct attention to their posture and balance. As can be appreciated other proprioceptive tools may also be employed as seen in FIG. 2, for example, a balance beam 20 may be employed alone or installed over the stepping blocks. Similarly, a pivoting balance board 22 or a rocker board similar to a see-saw, a ball device or a soft surface may all be employed within the scope of the invention. These additional tools assist in enhancing balance while involving various muscle groups in the lower extremities as well as support related muscles in the back throughout the exercise process. It can therefore be seen that the present invention provides an exercise and rehabilitation tool that requires the user to employ a full and free range of motion while performing the required exercises. This arrangement allows testing and isolation of certain muscle groups for strength testing while the body is maintained in a correct anatomical position. Further, the present invention allows core strengthening in that rather than simply working targeted muscle groups, the proprioceptive tools require that broad ranges of muscles be involved in each exercise. For these reasons, the instant invention is believed to represent a significant advancement in the art, which has substantial commercial merit. While there is shown and described herein certain specific structure embodying the invention, it will be manifest to those skilled in the art that various modifications and rearrangements of the parts may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the underlying inventive concept and that the same is not limited to the particular forms herein shown and described except insofar as indicated by the scope of the appended claims. 1.
