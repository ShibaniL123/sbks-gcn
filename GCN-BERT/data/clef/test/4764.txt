To a 1 L round flask charged with a stirring bar, hydroxylamine hydrochloride (79 g, 1.0 mol), (−)-fenchone (77.7 g, 0.5 mol) and ethanol (0.6 L) were added. Sodium acetate (103 g, 1.25 mol) was added into the reaction mixture and stirred at 60° C. for 24 hours. After cooling, most of the ethanol in the reaction mixture was removed in vacuo. Water was then added, causing the crude oxime to precipitate from the solution as colorless crystals, which were isolated by filtration and washed with distilled water. The crystalline material was collected, dried under vacuum and recrystallized from absolute ethanol to afford (−)-fenchone oxime (58.2 g, 70%); Rf=0.30 (Hexanes:EtOAc=5:1);
