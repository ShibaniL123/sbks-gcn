Synthesis of (R)-4-chloro-N-(2-hydroxy-1-(5-(4-(triftuoromethoxy)phenyl)-1,2,4-oxadiazol-3-yl)ethyl)benzamide (Compound 126)
(126-1) Synthesis of tert-butyl (R)-(2-((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)-1-cyanoethyl)carbamate (Compound 126-1)
The Burgess reagent (1.2 g) was added to a stirred solution of tert-butyl (S)-(1-amino 3-((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)-1-oxypropan-2-yl)carbamate (800 mg) in dry THE (50 mL) at room temperature. After the reaction completed, water (10 mL) was added to stop the reaction. Saturated brine (50 mL) was added to the mixture, and the mixture was extracted three times with ethyl acetate (50 mL). The combined ethyl acetate layer was washed with saturated brine (50 mL) and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The solvent was evaporated off under reduced pressure, and the resulting residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (hexane-ethyl acetate) to obtain the title compound (600 mg, yield 79%).
