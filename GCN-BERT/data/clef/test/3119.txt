DEVICE AND METHOD FOR ABSORBING LIQUIDS TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to an absorbent element for absorbing liquids released from food under preparation. BACKGROUND Many foods release liquids such as oil and water when they are prepared, for example by cooking or heating. Following preparation, some foods can exhibit an unpleasant taste if they have been prepared in combination with excessive oil or other liquids as a result of release of those liquids and so on from the food. The provision of excessive oils for example during food preparation can also be a nutritional concern. Furthermore, the oils and other liquids released from some foods as they are prepared can be difficult and environmentally problematic to dispose of. For example, it is relatively common for fatty deposits to build up in drains and sewers as a result of disposal of oils and grease down domestic and commercial sinks. The removal of such deposits is time consuming and expensive. SUMMARY According to an aspect of the present invention there is provided a food preparation aid comprising an absorbent element adapted to be placed in a cooking vessel with food during preparation whereby to absorb liquids released from the food during said preparation. According to a further aspect, there is provided a device for absorbing liquids released from food during preparation, comprising an absorbent, heat-resistant element to absorb the liquids whilst placed in situ with the food under preparation. Aids and devices formed in accordance with the present invention are liquid absorbing i.e. fats, oil, water and the like. The aid or device may include a permeable outer casing to accommodate the element and protect food from direct contact with the element and/or help to prevent the element from disintegrating. The outer casing and the element can be detachable from one another. That is, the element, which is typically housed within the casing, can be removed therefrom as desired; for example the casing may be formed as a “sock”, “sheath” or the like into which the element can be inserted. The outer casing can be fabricated from a non-toxic food-safe woven material, such as linen or muslin for example. Part of all of aids or devices formed according to the present invention may be formed from a natural material. Alternatively or additionally, part may be formed from a synthetic material. The absorbent element can be fabricated from a non-toxic food-safe material exhibiting capillary action. The element can be made from fibrous material, such as (unbleached) cotton for example, or a synthetic material. The element may be any desired shape or size. For example the element may be substantially cylindrical or spherical in shape. The outer casing can be in the form of a sleeve including a closed end and an open end, wherein the open end can be in an open or closed off configuration. In the closed configuration, the sleeve can be secured closed whereby to maintain the element therein. The sleeve can include a string tie arranged at least one end of thereof, whereby to enable the end to be gathered and secured in closed configuration. The present invention also provides a method of using a device for absorbing liquids released from food during preparation, the device including an absorbent, heat-resistant element for absorbing the liquids whilst placed in situ with the food under preparation, comprising placing the absorbent element adjacent the food being prepared, and preparing the food. A permeable outer casing to accommodate the element and protect the food from direct contact with the element in use can be provided. The method can further comprise moving the absorbent element during preparation of the food to enable substantially the entirety of the outer surface of the device to contact any liquids that are released during the preparation. The present invention also provides a fat absorbing device comprising an absorbent element which can be placed in a cooking vessel with food during cooking so as to absorb fat released from the food during said preparation. The primary function of the device is fat absorption; other liquids may also be absorbed. Different aspects and embodiments of the invention may be used separately or together. Further particular and preferred aspects of the present invention are set out in the accompanying independent and dependent claims. Features of the dependent claims may be combined with the features of the independent claims as appropriate, and in combination other than those explicitly set out in the claims.

Figure 1 is a schematic cross-sectional representation of a device for absorbing liquids released from food during preparation according to an example. An absorbent, heat-resistant element 101 is provided. The element is operable to absorb liquids released from food during their preparation, such as cooking. For example, oils and water released from foods whilst being cooked are substantially absorbed by the element 101, which is placed in situ with the food under preparation. The device 100 includes a permeable outer casing 103 to accommodate the element 101. In use, the outer casing, which can be in the form of a sheath or sleeve for example, protects food from direct contact with the element 101. Oils, water and other liquids can pass through the casing 103 to enable absorption by element 101. In an example, the outer casing 103 and the element 101 of device 100 are detachable from one another. That is, the casing 103 can be separated from element 101. This can enable the element 101 to be replaced and/or disposed of for example, and the casing 103 to be washed and reused. The outer casing 103 is fabricated from a non-toxic food-safe woven material, and in an example exhibits some degree of expandability. For example, an element 101 that has absorbed liquids may have increased in size as a result of the absorption. Accordingly, the outer casing 103 can be flexible to an extent to accommodate changes in the size and/or dimensions of the element 101 so as not to constrict the element 101 to a certain size, which may hamper its ability to absorb a desired amount of liquid. In an example, the absorbent element 101 is fabricated from a non-toxic food-safe material exhibiting capillary action. For example, the element 101 can be made from a fibrous material such as cotton, which is able to absorb a significant volume of liquid per unit weight and which can be provided in a compressed form thereby enabling the element 101 and thus device 100 to be formed into any desirable shape. In an example, the outer casing and the element can be impregnated with or fabricated from materials that exhibit certain desirable characteristics depending on the intended use for the device. For example, the element can be impregnated with or fabricated from/with a material that is oleophilic. The outer casing can be impregnated with or fabricated from/with a material that is hydrophobic. Other alternatives are possible. For example, the element and the outer casing can be impregnated with or fabricated from/with a material that is oleophilic and another that is hydrophobic. The element can be impregnated with or fabricated from/with a material that is oleophilic to a greater degree than the casing or vice versa. In an example, the absorbent element 101 is substantially cylindrical or spherical in shape whereby to enable all sides of the device to be used. That is, in use, the device 100 can be rolled around whilst in situ with food under preparation so that the entirety of the device is able to make contact with some released liquids. This means that absorption by one particular area or side of device 100 can be avoided, since this may affect the amount of liquid that could be absorbed by the device 100, particularly if one side or region becomes saturated, thereby reducing the capability of the device to absorb more liquid. Alternatively, device 100 can be any desired shape, such as a rectangle, cube or pyramid shaped for example. In these cases, the device will typically sit on one face but can be moved so as to permit absorption of liquids via another face of the device 100. Figure 2 is a schematic representation of a device 200 in situ in a cooking apparatus 201 with food 203 under preparation. Liquids, such as oils, fats, grease and water based liquids, generally depicted at 205 are absorbed by device 200 when the device comes into contact with them, such as by migration/movement of liquids in the apparatus 201, or by movement of the device 200 to the liquids, such as by using a cooking utensil for example. In an example, the device can withstand temperatures up to 250°C, which is higher than the temperatures typically experienced in a frying pan whilst food is being fried for example. According to an example, it will be appreciated that the device 100, 200 can be used after food preparation. That is, once food has been prepared, such as having been cooked for example, and the food has been removed from a cooking apparatus or other apparatus, the device can be added to the apparatus in order to absorb the liquids that have been released. Figures 3a and 3b are schematic representations of exemplary devices 300, 301 that are fabricated in the shape of a cube and a pyramid respectively. Figure 4 is a schematic representation of a device 400 in the form of a cylinder. In the example of figure 4, the outer casing 401 can be seen to include a gathered end portion 403. With an absorbent element accommodated in the casing 401, the end 403 is gathered and secured in order to maintain the element therein. For example, an integral string-type pull 405 can be provided in or on the casing 401 at the end portion that can be used to gather the end. When the string is pulled and tied off once the excess material at the end is gathered and secured, and the element is maintained within the casing until the string is undone so as to enable the element to be removed. As noted above, the element can then be disposed of/recycled, and the casing can be reused or recycled if desired. Both ends of the casing can be provided with similar arrangements, so that the casing is in the form of sleeve for example, that can be gathered at either end as depicted with the device 500 of figure 5. In Figures 6 to 10 a food preparation aid generally indicated 600 is shown and comprises an outer sock 603 and an inner absorbent element 601. In this embodiment the sock 603 is formed from muslin and the element is formed from compacted cotton. It should be noted that the element 601 may be unitary, or may be made up of two or more absorbent parts that fit within the sock 603. In Figure 11 an aid 700 formed according to an alternative embodiment is shown, in this case comprising a stretchable outer linen sock 701 and a compacted cotton inner element (not shown). In Figure 12 sausages 810 being cooked in a pan 815 are shown. During the cooking process fat 820 is released. Before and/or during the cooking process, one or more devices 800 are dropped into the pan so that it mops up the fat, as shown in Figures 13 and 14. Similarly, a pan 915 of minced meat 925 is shown in Figure 15 and liquid 930 originating from the meat is clearly visible. Following addition of devices 900 the liquid is absorbed away from the meat 925 as shown in Figure 16. A device may be added to a cooking vessel at any convenient time in a cooking process. For example before food is placed in the vessel, just after food is placed in the vessel, just before or after the cooking process has started, during a cooking process, at or towards the end of a cooking process, or after a cooking process is complete. Once it has been used, an element (or an entire device including the outer casing) can be disposed of such as by recycling. Alternatively, the oil or other materials in the device can be reclaimed. For example, oils and so on can be reclaimed and used as a fuel. Alternatively, the device or element can be used as a fuel in its own right as shown in Figure 17.
