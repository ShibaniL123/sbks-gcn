Step 2. Preparation of 4-Amino-5-cyano-6-((1-(1-methyl-4-oxo-2-phenyl-1,4-dihydroquinolin-3-yl)methyl)amino)pyrimidine
Crude 3-(1-aminoethyl)-1-methyl-2-phenylquinolin-4(1H)-one hydrochloride (1.12g) and 50ml of isopropanol were added to a 100ml three-necked flask and stirred to be dissolved. 4-Amino-5-cyano-6-chloropyrimidine (0.36g, 0.036mol) and potassium carbonate (1.25g, 0.09mol) were then added; the temperature was raised to 80Â°C and reaction was carried out under reflux for 5h with stirring. TLC tracking was performed until the completion of the reaction. The reaction was stopped and suction filtration was performed. The filter cake was washed with a large amount of ethyl acetate; solvent was removed under reduced pressure; and methanol and silica gel were added to the residue for preparing a mixture for chromatography. After column chromatography separation, 0.79g of a white solid was obtained with a yield of 68.5%.
