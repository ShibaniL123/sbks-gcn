PP compounds with high flowability and balanced mechanical properties The present invention is directed to a polypropylene composition (PP) having high flowability and balanced mechanical properties, an article comprising said polypropylene composition (PP) as well as the use of said polypropylene composition (PP) for the preparation of a moulded article. Nowadays, polypropylene is the polymer of choice in many applications for which it can be tailored to a diversity of different purposes. One main field of application of polypropylenes is in the automotive industry where a variety of automobile parts like bumpers, door panels, dashboards or door claddings are made of polypropylenes. In particular, heterophasic propylene copolymers are very attractive materials in this field as they are able to provide the highly desired combination of mechanical stiffness and good impact behavior. Heterophasic propylene copolymers are well known in the art and comprise a matrix being either a polypropylene homopolymer or a random polypropylene copolymer in which an elastomeric copolymer is dispersed. Thus, the polypropylene matrix contains (finely) dispersed inclusions being not part of the matrix and said inclusions contain the elastomer. The term inclusion indicates that the matrix and the inclusion form different phases within the heterophasic propylene copolymer, said inclusions are for instance visible by high resolution microscopy, like electron microscopy or scanning force microscopy. Even though the polypropylenes already on the market achieve well-balanced mechanical properties including high impact strength and stiffness, the polypropylenes usually exhibit low flowability and are thus not suitable for injection moulding processes requiring a short cycle time. Accordingly, there is the objective of developing improved polypropylene compositions which have improved flowability while the balanced set of other important mechanical properties such as stiffness and impact strength is maintained. The foregoing and other objectives are achieved by the subject-matter of the present invention. The specific finding of the present invention is to provide a polypropylene composition (PP) comprising, (a) from 41.0 to 52.0 wt.-%, based on the total weight of the polypropylene composition (PP), of a first heterophasic propylene copolymer (HECO-1) having a melt flow rate MFR2 (230 °C, 2.16 kg) measured according to ISO 1 133 in the range of from 15.0 to 30.0 g/lOmin, (b) from 19.0 to 30.0 wt.-%, based on the total weight of the polypropylene composition (PP), of a second heterophasic propylene copolymer (HECO-2) having a melt flow rate MFR2 (230 °C, 2,16 kg) measured according to ISO 1 133 of from 25.0 to 39.0 g/lO min, (c) from 5.0 to 15.0 wt.-%, based on the total weight of the polypropylene composition (PP), of at least one elastomeric ethylene copolymer (EEC) having a melt flow rate MFR2 (190 °C, 2,16 kg) measured according to ISO 1133 in the range of from 3.0 to 40.0 g/lOmin, and · (d) from 6.0 to 14.0 wt.-%, based on the total weight of the polypropylene composition (PP), of an inorganic filler (F).

In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, the polypropylene composition (PP) has a melt flow rate MF 2 (230 °C, 2.16 kg) measured according to ISO 1 133 in the range of from 15.0 to 30.0 g/l Omin. According to another aspect of the present invention, an article is provided, comprising, preferably consisting of, said polypropylene composition (PP). In a preferred embodiment, the article is a moulded article, preferably an injection moulded article. Furthermore, the present invention refers in another aspect to the use of said polypropylene composition (PP) for the preparation of a moulded article, preferably an injection moulded article. According to another aspect of the present invention, the polypropylene composition (PP) is prepared by blending the heterophasic propylene copolymers (HECO-1 and HECO-2) with the elastomeric ethylene copolymer (EEC), the inorganic filler (F), and optional additives in an extruder, and extruding the obtained blend of the heterophasic propylene copolymers (HECO-1 and HECO-2), elastomeric ethylene copolymer (EEC), the inorganic filler (F), and optional additives in the extruder. The term "blending" refers according to the present invention to the action of providing a blend out of at least two different, pre-existing materials, i.e. the heterophasic propylene copolymers (HECO-1 and HECO-2), elastomeric ethylene copolymer (EEC), the inorganic filler (F), and optional additives. For blending the individual components of the instant composition, i.e. the heterophasic propylene copolymers (HECO-1 and HECO-2), elastomeric ethylene copolymer (EEC), the inorganic filler (F), and optional additives, a conventional compounding or blending apparatus, e.g. a Banbury mixer, a 2-roll rubber mill, Buss-co-kneader or a twin screw extruder may be used. The polymer materials recovered from the extruder are usually in the form of pellets. These pellets are then preferably further processed, e.g. by injection moulding to generate articles and products of the inventive composition. In the following, the invention and all of its components are described in more detail. When in the following reference is made to preferred embodiments or technical details of the inventive polypropylene composition (PP), it is to be understood that these preferred embodiments or technical details also refer to the inventive article comprising the polypropylene composition (PP). The first heterophasic propylene copolymer (HECO-1) As stated above, the polypropylene composition (PP) according to the present invention comprises a first heterophasic propylene copolymer (HECO-1) as essential component. The first heterophasic propylene copolymer (HECO-1) is added to the polypropylene composition (PP) according to the present invention as base resin for ensuring high impact strength. One important aspect of the present invention is that the amount of the first heterophasic propylene copolymer (HECO-1) in the polypropylene composition (PP) is rather high. Accordingly, it is preferred that the first heterophasic propylene copolymer (HECO-1) is present in the polypropylene composition (PP) according to the present invention in an amount of between 41.0 and 52.0 wt.-%, preferably in an amount between 43.0 and 52.0 wt- %, more preferably in an amount between 45.0 and 52.0 wt.-% based on the total weight of the polypropylene composition (PP). It is preferred that the first heterophasic propylene copolymer (HECO-1 ) before mixed with the other components of the inventive polypropylene composition (PP) mentioned herein comprises as polymer components only the matrix polypropylene (PP-1) and dispersed therein the elastomeric propylene copolymer (E-l). In other words the first heterophasic propylene copolymer (HECO-1) may contain further additives but no other polymer in an amount exceeding 5.0 wt-%, more preferably exceeding 3.0 wt.-%, like exceeding 1.0 wt.-%, based on the total amount of the first heterophasic propylene copolymer (HECO-1), more preferably based on the polymers present in the first heterophasic propylene copolymer (HECO-1 ). One additional polymer which may be present in such low amounts is a polyethylene which is a reaction product obtained by the preparation of the first heterophasic propylene copolymer (HECO-1). Accordingly, it is in particular appreciated that a first heterophasic propylene copolymer (HECO-1) as defined in the instant invention contains only a polypropylene (PP-1), an elastomeric propylene copolymer (E-l) and optionally a polyethylene in amounts as mentioned in this paragraph. One important aspect of the instant invention is that the first heterophasic propylene copolymer (HECO-1) has a low melt flow rate, i.e. has a melt flow rate MFR2 (230 °C) in the range of 15.0 to 30.0 g/lOmin, more preferably in the range of 15.0 to 23.0 g/lOmin, and most preferably in the range of 16.0 to 20.0 g/10 min. Preferably, the propylene content in the first heterophasic propylene copolymer (HECO-1) is preferably in the range 80.0 to 90.0 wt-%, more preferably in the range of 81.0 to 88.0 wt-%, yet more preferably in the range of 83.0 to 86.0 wt-% and even more preferably 83.5 to 85.5 wt-%), based on the total weight of the first heterophasic propylene copolymer (HECO-1 ), more preferably based on the amount of the polymer components of the first heterophasic propylene copolymer (HECO-1), yet more preferably based on the amount of the polypropylene (PP-1) and the elastomeric propylene copolymer (E-l) together. The remaining part constitutes the comonomers, like ethylene, as defined for the polypropylene (PP-1) being a propylene copolymer (R-PP-1) and the elastomeric propylene copolymer (E-l), respectively. Accordingly, the comonomer content, preferably ethylene content, is preferably in the range of 10.0 to 20.0 wt.-%, more preferably in the range of 12.0 to 19.0 wt-%, yet more preferably in the range of 14.0 to 17.0 wt-% and even more preferably in the range of 14.5 to 16.5 wt-%, based on the total weight of the first heterophasic propylene copolymer (HECO-1), more preferably based on the amount of the polymer components of the first heterophasic propylene copolymer (HECO-1), yet more preferably based on the amount of the polypropylene (PP-1) and the elastomeric propylene copolymer (E-l) together. As stated above the matrix of the first heterophasic propylene copolymer (HECO-1) is the polypropylene (PP- 1 ) . The polypropylene (PP-1) according to this invention constituting the matrix of the first heterophasic propylene copolymer (HECO-1) shall have a melt flow rate MFR2 (230 °C) in the range of from 60.0 to 120.0 g/lOmin, more preferably in the range of 70.0 to 100.0 g/lOmin, yet more preferably in the range of 70.0 to 90.0 g/10 min, still even more preferably in the range of 80.0 to 90.0 g/lOmin. The polypropylene (PP-1) can be a propylene copolymer (R-PP-1) or a propylene homopolymer (H-PP-1), the latter is preferred. Accordingly, it is appreciated that the polypropylene (PP-1) has a comonomer content equal or below 7.0 wt-%, more preferably equal or below 4.0 wt-%, still more preferably equal or below 1.0 wt-%. The expression propylene homopolymer, e.g. the expressions propylene homopolymer (H- PP-1) and propylene homopolymer (H-PP-2) used in the instant invention, relates to a polypropylene that consists substantially, i.e. of more than 99.5 wt-%, such as at least 99.6 wt-%), still more preferably of at least 99.7 wt-%, like of at least 99.8 wt-%, of propylene units. In case other monomeric units are present in minor amounts, the units are selected from ethylene and/or a C4 to Qo a-olefin, preferably ethylene, as described below. In a preferred embodiment only propylene units in the propylene homopolymer are detectable. In case the polypropylene (PP-1) is a propylene copolymer (R-PP-1) it comprises monomers copolymerizable with propylene, for example comonomers such as ethylene and/or C4 to do a-olefins, in particular ethylene and/or C4 to Cg a-olefins, e.g. 1-butene and/or 1-hexene. Preferably, the propylene copolymer (R-PP-1) comprises, especially consists of, monomers copolymerizable with propylene from the group consisting of ethylene, 1-butene and 1- hexene. More specifically the propylene copolymer (R-PP-1) comprises - apart from propylene - units derivable from ethylene and/or 1 -butene. In a preferred embodiment the propylene copolymer (R-PP-1) comprises units derivable from ethylene and propylene only. The comonomer content in the propylene copolymer (R-PP-1) is preferably in the range of more than 1.0 to 7.0 wt-%, still more preferably in the range of more than 1.0 to 4.0 wt-%. The polypropylene (PP-1) can have a xylene cold soluble content (XCS) in a broad range, i.e. up to 5.0 wt.-%. Accordingly the polypropylene (PP-1) may have a xylene cold soluble content (XCS) in the range of 0.3 to 5.0 wt.-%, preferably in the range of 0.5 to 4.5 wt.-%, like in the range of 1.0 to 4.0 wt.-%. However, in preferred embodiments, the polypropylene (PP-1), in particular in case the polypropylene (PP-1) is a propylene homopolymer (H-PP-1), has a xylene cold soluble (XCS) content in the range of 0.5 to 5.0 wt.-%, more preferably in the range of 0.5 to 4.0 wt.-%, still more preferably of 0.5 to 3.0 wt.-%. One further essential component of the first heterophasic propylene copolymer (HECO-1) is its elastomeric propylene copolymer (E-l). The elastomeric propylene copolymer (E-l) preferably comprises monomers copolymerizable with propylene, for example comonomers such as ethylene and/or C4 to Qo a-olefins, in particular ethylene and/or C4 to C8 α-olefins, e.g. 1-butene and/or 1-hexene. Preferably the elastomeric propylene copolymer (E-l) comprises, especially consists of, monomers copolymerizable with propylene from the group consisting of ethylene, 1 -butene and 1-hexene. More specifically the elastomeric propylene copolymer (E-l) comprises - apart from propylene - units derivable from ethylene and/or 1-butene. Thus in an especially preferred embodiment the elastomeric propylene copolymer phase (E-l) comprises units derivable from ethylene and propylene only. In case the polypropylene (PP-1) is a propylene copolymer (R-PP-1) it is preferred that the comonomer(s) of the propylene copolymer (R-PP-1) and the elastomeric propylene copolymer (E-l) are the same. The properties of the elastomeric propylene copolymer phase (El) are mainly influenced by the xylene cold soluble (XCS) content of the first heterophasic propylene copolymer (HECO-1). Thus, according to the present invention the xylene cold soluble (XCS) fraction of the first heterophasic propylene copolymer (HECO-1) is regarded as the elastomeric propylene copolymer (E-1) of the first heterophasic propylene copolymer (HECO-1): Accordingly, the amount of the elastomeric propylene copolymer (E-1), i.e. of the xylene cold soluble (XCS) fraction, of the first heterophasic propylene copolymer (HECO-1) preferably is in the range of from 16.0 to 35.0 wt-%, more preferably in the range of from 18.0 to 35.0 wt-%, even more preferably in the range of from 20.0 to 35.0 wt-% and most preferably in the range of from 30.0 to 35.0 wt-%. These values are based on the first heterophasic propylene copolymer (HECO-1) and not on the total polypropylene composition (PP). One important requirement of the present invention is that the elastomeric propylene copolymer (E-1) has a balanced weight average molecular weight. Accordingly the intrinsic viscosity must be carefully chosen. Low intrinsic viscosity (IV) values reflect a low weight average molecular weight. Thus it is appreciated that the elastomeric propylene copolymer phase (E-1), i.e. the xylene cold soluble fraction (XCS) of the first heterophasic propylene copolymer (HECO-1), has an intrinsic viscosity (IV) determined according to DIN ISO 1628/1 (in decaline at 135 °C) in the range of from 2.0 to 3.5 dl/g, more preferably in the range of from equal or more than 2.0 to 3.0 dl/g, and still even more preferably in the range of equal or more than from 2.0 to 2.5 dl/g, like in the range of 2.0 to 2.2 dl/g. The comonomer content, preferably the ethylene content, within the elastomeric propylene copolymer phase (E-1) shall be preferably also in a specific range. Accordingly in a preferred embodiment the comonomer content, more preferably ethylene content, of the elastomeric propylene copolymer (E-1), i.e. of the xylene cold soluble fraction (XCS) of the first heterophasic propylene copolymer (HECO-1), is in the range of from 30.0 to 45.0 wt.-%, still more preferably in the range of from 35.0 to 45.0 wt.-%, yet more preferably in the range of from 35.0 to 42.0 wt.-%. Accordingly, it is appreciated that the propylene content of the eiastomeric propylene copolymer (E-l), i.e. of the xylene cold soluble fraction (XCS) of the first heterophasic propylene copolymer (HECO-1), is preferably in the range of from 55.0 to 70.0 wt.-%, still more preferably in the range of 55.0 to 65.0 wt.-%, yet more preferably in the range of from 58.0 to 65.0 wt.-%. As will be explained below, the first heterophasic polypropylene (HECO-1) as well its individual components (matrix and eiastomeric copolymer) can be produced by blending different polymer types, i.e. of different molecular weight and/or comonomer content. However it is preferred that the first heterophasic polypropylene (HECO-1) as well its individual components (matrix and eiastomeric copolymer) are produced in a sequential step process, using reactors in serial cionfiguration and operating at different reaction conditions. As a consequence, each fraction prepared in a specific reactor will have its own molecular weight and/or comonomer content distribution. The first heterophasic propylene copolymer (HECO-1) according to this invention is commercially available. Accordingly a skilled person in the art is in a position to produce a first heterophasic propylene copolymer (HECO-1) as defined herein. The first heterophasic propylene copolymer (HECO-1) according to this invention is preferably produced in a sequential polymerization process, i.e. in a multistage process, known in the art, wherein the polypropylene (PP-1) is produced at least in one slurry reactor, preferably in a slurry reactor and optionally in a subsequent gas phase reactor, and subsequently the eiastomeric propylene copolymer (E-l) is produced at least in one, i.e. one or two, gas phase reactor(s). Accordingly it is preferred that the first heterophasic propylene copolymer (HECO- 1 ) is produced in a sequential polymerization process comprising the steps of (a) polymerizing propylene and optionally at least one of ethylene and/or Q to Q0 a- olefin in a first reactor (Rl) obtaining the first polypropylene fraction of the polypropylene (PP-1), preferably said first polypropylene fraction is a first propylene homopolymer, (b) transferring the first polypropylene fraction into a second reactor (R2), (c) polymerizing in the second reactor (R2) and in the presence of said first polypropylene fraction propylene and optionally at least one of ethylene and/or C4 to Qo a-olefin, and obtaining thereby the second polypropylene fraction, preferably said second polypropylene fraction is a second propylene homopolymer, said first polypropylene fraction and said second polypropylene fraction form the polypropylene (PP-1), i.e. the matrix of the heterophasic propylene copolymer (HECO-1), (d) transferring the polypropylene (PP-1) of step (c) into a third reactor (R3), (e) polymerizing in the third reactor (R3) and in the presence of the polypropylene (PP-1) obtained in step (c) propylene and at least one of ethylene and/or Q to Qo a-olefin, and obtaining thereby a first elastomeric propylene copolymer fraction, the first elastomeric propylene copolymer fraction is dispersed in the polypropylene (PP-1), (f) transferring the polypropylene (PP-1) in which the first elastomeric propylene copolymer fraction is dispersed into a fourth reactor (R4), and (g) polymerizing in the fourth reactor (R4) and in the presence of the mixture obtained in step (e) propylene and at least one of ethylene and/or to Qo a-olefin, and obtaining thereby the second elastomeric propylene copolymer fraction, the polypropylene (PP-1), the first elastomeric propylene copolymer fraction, and the second elastomeric propylene copolymer fraction form the heterophasic propylene copolymer (HECO-1 ). Alternatively the elastomeric propylene copolymer (E-l) can be also produced in one gas phase reactor, i.e. the fourth reactor (R4) is optional. Of course, in the first reactor (Rl) the second polypropylene fraction can be produced and in the second reactor (R2) the first polypropylene fraction can be obtained. The same holds true for the elastomeric propylene copolymer phase. Accordingly in the third reactor (R3) the second elastomeric propylene copolymer fraction can be produced whereas in the fourth reactor (R4) the first elastomeric propylene copolymer fraction is made. Preferably between the second reactor (R2) and the third reactor (R3) and optionally between the third reactor (R3) and fourth reactor (R4) the monomers are flashed out. The term "sequential polymerization process" indicates that the first heterophasic propylene copolymer (HECO-1) is produced in at least two, like three or four reactors connected in series. Accordingly the present process comprises at least a first reactor (Rl) and a second reactor (R2), more preferably a first reactor (Rl), a second reactor (R2), a third reactor (R3) and a fourth reactor (R4). The term "polymerization reactor" shall indicate that the main polymerization takes place. Thus in case the process consists of four polymerization reactors, this definition does not exclude the option that the overall process comprises for instance a pre-polymerization step in a pre-polymerization reactor. The term "consist of is only a closing formulation fn view of the main polymerization reactors. The first reactor (Rl) is preferably a slurry reactor (SR) and can be any continuous or simple stirred batch tank reactor or loop reactor operating in bulk or slurry. Bulk means a polymerization in a reaction medium that comprises of at least 60 % (w/w) monomer. According to the present invention the slurry reactor (SR) is preferably a (bulk) loop reactor (LR). The second reactor (R2), the third reactor (R3) and the fourth reactor (R4) are preferably gas phase reactors (GPR). Such gas phase reactors (GPR) can be any mechanically mixed or fluid bed reactors. Preferably the gas phase reactors (GPR) comprise a mechanically agitated fluid bed reactor with gas velocities of at least 0.2 m/sec. Thus it is appreciated that the gas phase reactor is a fluidized bed type reactor preferably with a mechanical stirrer. Thus in a preferred embodiment, the first reactor (Rl) is a slurry reactor (SR), like a loop reactor (LR), whereas the second reactor (R2), the third reactor (R3) and the fourth reactor (R4) are gas phase reactors (GPR). Accordingly for the instant process, at least four, preferably four polymerization reactors, namely a slurry reactor (SR), like a loop reactor (LR), a first gas phase reactor (GPR-1), a second gas phase reactor (GPR-2) and a third gas phase reactor (GPR-3) connected in series are used. If needed, prior to the slurry reactor (SR), a pre-polymerization reactor is placed. Alternatively, the third gas phase reactor (GPR-3) is optional, i.e. three reactors (LR, GPR-1, GPR-2) are used. A preferred multistage process is a "loop-gas phase"-process, such as developed by Borealis A/S, Denmark (known as BORSTAR® technology) described e.g. in patent literature, such as in EP 0 887 379, WO 92/12182 WO 2004/000899, WO 2004/111095, WO 99/24478, WO 99/24479 or in WO 00/68315. A further suitable slurry-gas phase process is the Spheripol® process of Basell. Preferably, in the instant process for producing the first heterophasic propylene copolymer (HECO-1) as defined above, the conditions for the first reactor (Rl), i.e. the slurry reactor (SR), like a loop reactor (LR), of step (a) may be as follows: the temperature is within the range of 50 °C to 110 °C, preferably between 60 °C and 100 °C, more preferably between 68 and 95 °C, the pressure is within the range of 20 bar to 80 bar, preferably between 40 bar to 70 bar, - hydrogen can be added for controlling the molar mass in a manner known per se. Subsequently, the reaction mixture from step (a) is transferred to the second reactor (R2), i.e. gas phase reactor (GPR-1), i.e. to step (c), whereby the conditions in step (c) are preferably as follows: - the temperature is within the range of 50 °C to 130 °C, preferably between 60 °C and 100 °C, the pressure is within the range of 5 bar to 50 bar, preferably between 15 bar to 35 bar, hydrogen can be added for controlling the molar mass in a manner known per se. The condition in the third reactor (R3) and the fourth reactor (R4), preferably in the second gas phase reactor (GPR-2) and third gas phase reactor (GPR-3), is similar to the second reactor (R2). The residence time can vary in the three reactor zones. In one embodiment of the process for producing the polypropylene, the residence time in bulk reactor, e.g. loop, is in the range 0.1 to 2.5 hours, e.g. 0.15 to 1.5 hours, and the residence time in gas phase reactor will generally be 0.2 to 6.0 hours, like 0.5 to 4.0 hours. If desired, the polymerization may be effected in a known manner under supercritical conditions in the first reactor (Rl), i.e. in the slurry reactor (SR), like in the loop reactor (LR), and/or as a condensed mode in the gas phase reactors (GPR). Preferably the process comprises also a prepolymerization with the catalyst system, as described in detail below, comprising a Ziegler-Natta procatalyst, an external donor and optionally a cocatalyst. In a preferred embodiment, the prepolymerization is conducted as bulk slurry polymerization in liquid propylene, i.e. the liquid phase mainly comprises propylene, with minor amount of other reactants and optionally inert components dissolved therein. The prepolymerization reaction is typically conducted at a temperature of 10 to 60 °C, preferably from 15 to 50 °C, and more preferably from 20 to 45 °C. The pressure in the prepolymerization reactor is not critical but must be sufficiently high to maintain the reaction mixture in liquid phase. Thus, the pressure may be from 20 to 100 bar, for example 30 to 70 bar. The catalyst components are preferably all introduced to the prepolymerization step. However, where the solid catalyst component (i) and the cocatalyst (ii) can be fed separately it is possible that only a part of the cocatalyst is introduced into the prepolymerization stage and the remaining part into subsequent polymerization stages. Also in such cases it is necessary to introduce so much cocatalyst into the prepolymerization stage that a sufficient polymerization reaction is obtained therein. It is possible to add other components also to the prepolymerization stage. Thus, hydrogen may be added into the prepolymerization stage to control the molecular weight of the prepolymer as is known in the art. Further, antistatic additive may be used to prevent the particles from adhering to each other or to the walls of the reactor. The precise control of the prepolymerization conditions and reaction parameters is within the skill of the art. According to the invention the first heterophasic propylene copolymer (HECO-1) is obtained by a multistage polymerization process, as described above, in the presence of a catalyst system comprising as component (i) a Ziegler-Natta procatalysf which contains a trans- esterification product of a lower alcohol and a phthalic ester.

The content of these documents is herein included by reference. First an adduct of MgCl2 and a Ci-C2 alcohol of the formula MgCl2*nROH, wherein R is methyl or ethyl and n is 1 to 6, is formed. Ethanol is preferably used as alcohol. The adduct, which is first melted and then spray crystallized or emulsion solidified, is used as catalyst carrier. In the next step the spray crystallized or emulsion solidified adduct of the formula MgCl2*nROH, wherein R is methyl or ethyl, preferably ethyl and n is 1 to 6, is contacting with TiCl4 to form a titanized carrier, followed by the steps of · adding to said titanised carrier (i) a dialkylphthalate of formula (I) with R1 and R2 being independently at least a C5-alkyl, like at least a Cg-alkyl, or preferably (ii) a dialkylphthalate of formula (I) with R1 and R2 being the same and being at least a C5-alkyl, like at least a Cg-alkyl, or more preferably (iii) a dialkylphthalate of formula (I) selected from the group consisting of propylhexylphthalate (PrHP), dioctylphthalate (DOP), di-iso- decylphthalate (DIDP), and ditridecylphthalate (DTDP), yet more preferably the dialkylphthalate of formula (I) is a dioctylphthalate (DOP), like di-iso-octylphthalate or diethylhexylphthalate, in particular diethylhexylphthalate, to form a first product, • subjecting said first product to suitable transesterification conditions, i.e. to a temperature above 100 °C, preferably between 100 to 150 °C, more preferably between 130 to 150 °C, such that said methanol or ethanol is transesterified with said ester groups of said dialkylphthalate of formula (I) to form preferably at least 80 mol-%, more preferably 90 mol-%, most preferably 95 mol.-%, of a dialkylphthalate of formula (II) with R1 and R2 being methyl or ethyl, preferably ethyl, the dialkylphthalat of formula (II) being the internal donor and • recovering said transesterification product as the procatalyst composition (component (i)).

This crystallized adduct is preferably used as the catalyst carrier and reacted to the procatalyst useful in the present invention as described in WO 92/19658 and WO 92/19653. As the catalyst residue is removed by extracting, an adduct of the titanised carrier and the internal donor is obtained, in which the group deriving from the ester alcohol has changed. In case sufficient titanium remains on the carrier, it will act as an active element of the procatalyst.

The polymerized vinyl compound can act as an a-nucleating agent. Concerning the modification of catalyst, reference is made to the international applications WO 99/24478, WO 99/24479 and particularly WO 00/68315, incorporated herein by reference with respect to the reaction conditions concerning the modification of the catalyst as well as with respect to the polymerization reaction.

Second heterophasic propylene copolymer (HECO-2) As mentioned above, the polypropylene composition (PP) according to the present invention further comprises a second heterophasic propylene copolymer (HECO-2) as an essential component. The second heterophasic propylene copolymer (HECO-2) is added to the polypropylene composition (PP) according to the present invention for improving the stiffness and the flowability of the composition. One important aspect of the present invention is that the amount of the second heterophasic propylene copolymer (HECO-2) in the polypropylene composition (PP) is lower than the amount of the first heterophasic propylene copolymer (HECO-1). Accordingly, it is preferred that the second heterophasic propylene copolymer (HECO-2) is present in the polypropylene composition (PP) according to the present invention in an amount of between 19.0 and 30.0 wt.-%, preferably in an amount between 20.0 and 27.0 wt.-%, more preferably in an amount between 20.0 and 25.0 wt.-% based on the total weight of the polypropylene composition (PP).

Furthermore, the second heterophasic propylene copolymer (HECO-2) typically has a higher melt flow rate MFR2 than the first heterophasic propylene copolymer (HECO-1). Furthermore, the comonomer content of the second heterophasic propylene copolymer (HECO-2) is preferably lower than the comonomer content of the first heterophasic propylene copolymer (HECO-1 ). Thus, it is preferred that (a) melt flow rate MFR2 (230°C) of the first heterophasic propylene copolymer (HECO- 1) is at least 8.0 g/lOmin, more preferably at least 10.0 g/lOmin and most preferably from 15.0 to 23.0 g/lOmin lower than the melt flow rate MFR2 (230°C) of the second heterophasic propylene copolymer (HECO-2); and/or (b) the comonomer content, like ethylene content, of the first heterophasic propylene copolymer (HECO-1) is at least 3.0 wt.-%, more preferably at least 5.0 wt.-%, yet more preferably in the range of 3.0 to 15.0 wt.-%, like 5.0 to 15.0 wt.-%, like 5.0 to 10.0 wt.-%, higher than the comonomer content, like ethylene content, of the second heterophasic propylene copolymer (HECO-2).

One additional polymer which may be present in such low amounts is a polyethylene which is a reaction product obtained by the preparation of the second heterophasic propylene copolymer (HECO-2). Accordingly, it is in particular appreciated that a second heterophasic propylene copolymer (HECO-2) as defined in the instant invention contains only a polypropylene (PP-2), an elastomeric propylene copolymer (E-2) and optionally a polyethylene in amounts as mentioned in this paragraph. Preferably the second heterophasic propylene copolymer (HECO-2) has a melt flow rate MFR-2 (230°C) measured according to ISO 1 133 in the range of from 25.0 to 39.0 g/lOmin, more preferably in the range of 30.0 to 39.0 g/lOmin, and most preferably in the range of from 35.0 to 39.0 g/lOmin.

The remaining part constitutes the comonomers, like ethylene, as defined for the polypropylene (PP-2) being a propylene copolymer (R-PP-2) and the elastomeric propylene copolymer (E-2), respectively. Accordingly, the comonomer content, preferably ethylene content, is preferably in the range of 5.0 to 12.0 wt.-%, more preferably in the range of 5.0 to 10.0 wt.-% and most preferably in the range of 7.5 to 10.0 wt.-%, based on the total weight of the second heterophasic propylene copolymer (HECO-2), more preferably based on the amount of the polymer components of the second heterophasic propylene copolymer (HECO-2), yet more preferably based on the amount of the polypropylene (PP-2) and the elastomeric propylene copolymer (E-2) together. As stated above, the matrix of the second heterophasic propylene copolymer (HECO-2) is the polypropylene (PP-2). The polypropylene (PP-2) according to this invention constituting the matrix of the second heterophasic copolymer (HECO-2) shall have a melt flow rate MFR2 (230 °C) in the range of from 80.0 to 150.0 g/l Omin, more preferably in the range of 90.0 to 120.0 g/lOmin, yet more preferably in the range of 95.0 to 115.0 g/10 min, still even more preferably in the range of 100.0 to 1 15.0 g/l Omin. The polypropylene (PP-2) can be a propylene copolymer (R-PP-2) or a propylene homopolymer (H-PP-2), the latter is preferred. Accordingly, it is appreciated that the polypropylene (PP-2) has a comonomer content equal or below 7.0 wt-%, more preferably equal or below 4.0 wt-%, still more preferably equal or below 1.0 wt-%. In case the polypropylene (PP-2) is a propylene copolymer (R-PP-2) it comprises monomers copolymerizable with propylene, for example comonomers such as ethylene and/or C4 to Qo a-olefins, in particular ethylene and/or C4 to Cg a-olefins, e.g. 1-butene and/or 1-hexene. Preferably the propylene copolymer (R-PP-2) comprises, especially consists of, monomers copolymerizable with propylene from the group consisting of ethylene, 1 -butene and 1 - hexene. More specifically the propylene copolymer (R-PP-2) comprises - apart from propylene - units derivable from ethylene and/or 1-butene. In a preferred embodiment the propylene copolymer (R-PP-2) comprises units derivable from ethylene and propylene only. The comonomer content in the propylene copolymer (R-PP-2) is preferably in the range of more than 1.0 to 7.0 wt-%, still more preferably in the range of more than 1.0 to 4.0 wt-%. The polypropylene (PP-2) can have a xylene cold soluble content (XCS) in a broad range, i.e. up to 5.0 wt.-%. Accordingly the polypropylene (PP-2) may have a xylene cold soluble content (XCS) in the range of 0.3 to 5.0 wt.-%, preferably in the range of 0.5 to 4.5 wt.-%, like in the range of 1.0 to 4.0 wt.-%. However, in preferred embodiments, the polypropylene (PP-2), in particular in case the polypropylene (PP-2) is a propylene homopolymer (H-PP-2), has a xylene cold soluble (XCS) content in the range of 0.3 to 4.0 wt.-%, more preferably in the range of 0.5 to 3.5 wt.-%, still more preferably of 1.0 to 3.0 wt.-%. One further essential component of the second heterophasic propylene copolymer (HECO-2) is its elastomeric propylene copolymer (E-2). The elastomeric propylene copolymer (E-2) preferably comprises monomers copolymerizable with propylene, for example comonomers such as ethylene and/or C4 to Qo a-olefins, in particular ethylene and/or C4 to Cg a-olefins, e.g. 1 -butene and/or 1-hexene. Preferably the elastomeric propylene copolymer (E-2) comprises, especially consists of, monomers copolymerizable with propylene from the group consisting of ethylene, 1 -butene and 1-hexene. More specifically the elastomeric propylene copolymer (E-2) comprises - apart from propylene - units derivable from ethylene and/or 1 -butene. Thus in an especially preferred embodiment the elastomeric propylene copolymer phase (E-2) comprises units derivable from ethylene and propylene only. In case the polypropylene (PP-2) is a propylene copolymer (R-PP-2) it is preferred that the comonomer(s) of the propylene copolymer (R-PP-2) and the elastomeric propylene copolymer (E-2) are the same. The1 properties of the elastomeric propylene copolymer phase (E-2) are mainly influenced by the xylene cold soluble (XCS) content of the second heterophasic propylene copolymer (HECO-2). Thus, according to the present invention the xylene cold soluble (XCS) fraction of the second heterophasic propylene copolymer (HECO-2) is regarded as the elastomeric propylene copolymer (E-2) of the second heterophasic propylene copolymer (HECO-2). Accordingly, the amount of the elastomeric propylene copolymer (E-2), i.e. of the xylene cold soluble (XCS) fraction, of the second heterophasic propylene copolymer (HECO-2) preferably is in the range of from 16.0 to 25.0 wt.-%, more preferably in the range of from 18.0 to 22.0 wt.-% and even more preferably in the range of from 18.0 to 20.0 wt.-%.These values are based on the second heterophasic propylene copolymer (HECO-2) and not on the total polypropylene composition (PP). It is appreciated that the elastomeric propylene copolymer (E-2) has a balanced weight average molecular weight. Accordingly the intrinsic viscosity must be carefully chosen. It is appreciated that the elastomeric propylene copolymer phase (E-2), i.e. the xylene cold soluble fraction (XCS) of the second heterophasic propylene copolymer (HECO-2), has an intrinsic viscosity (IV) determined according to DIN ISO 1628/1 (in decaline at 135 °C) in the range of from 2.0 to 2.8 dl/g, more preferably in the range of from 2.0 to 2.5 dl/g, and most preferably in the range of from 2.2 to 2.4 dl/g. The comonomer content, preferably the ethylene content, within the elastomeric propylene copolymer phase (E-2) shall be preferably also in a specific range. Accordingly in a preferred embodiment the comonomer content, more preferably ethylene content, of the elastomeric propylene copolymer (E-2), i.e. of the xylene cold soluble fraction (XCS) of the second heterophasic propylene copolymer (HECO-2), is in the range of from 30.0 to 42.0 wt.-%, still more preferably in the range of from 33.0 to 40.0 wt.-%, yet more preferably in the range of from 33.0 to 37.0 wt.-%. Accordingly, it is appreciated that the propylene content of the elastomeric propylene copolymer (E-2), i.e. of the xylene cold soluble fraction (XCS) of the second heterophasic propylene copolymer (HECO-2), is preferably in the rangS of from 58.0 to 70.0 wt.-%, still more preferably in the range of 60.0 to 67.0 wt.-%, yet more preferably in the range of from 63.0 to 67.0 wt.-%. The second heterophasic propylene copolymer (HECO-2) according to this invention is commercially available. Accordingly a skilled person in the art is in a position to produce a second heterophasic propylene copolymer (HECO-2) as defined herein. As will be explained below, the second heterophasic polypropylene (HECO-2) as well its individual components (matrix and elastomeric copolymer) can be produced by blending different polymer types, i.e. of different molecular weight and/or comonomer content. However it is preferred that the second heterophasic polypropylene (HECO-2) as well its individual components (matrix and elastomeric copolymer) are produced in a sequential step process, using reactors in serial configuration and operating at different reaction conditions. As a consequence, each fraction prepared in a specific reactor will have its own molecular weight distribution and/or comonomer content distribution. Preferably the second heterophasic propylene copolymer (HECO-2) comprises an a- nucleating agent. Even more preferred the present invention is free of β-nucleating agents. Accordingly, the a-nucleating agent is preferably selected from the group consisting of (i) salts of monocarboxylic acids and polycarboxylic acids, e.g. sodium benzoate or aluminum tert-butylbenzoate, and (ii) dibenzylidenesorbitol (e.g. 1,3 : 2,4 dibenzylidenesorbitol) and C C8-alkyl- substituted dibenzylidenesorbitol derivatives, such as methyldibenzylidenesorbitol, ethyldibenzylidenesorbitol or dimethyldibenzylidenesorbitol (e.g. 1,3 : 2,4 di(methylbenzylidene) sorbitol), or substituted nonitol-derivatives, such as 1,2,3,- trideoxy-4,6:5,7-bis-0-[(4-propylphenyl)methylene]-nonitol, and (iii) salts of diesters of phosphoric acid, e.g. sodium 2,2'-methylenebis (4, 6,-di-tert- butylphenyl) phosphate or aluminium-hydroxy-bis[2,2'-methylene-bis(4,6-di-t- butylphenyl)phosphate], and (iv) vinylcycloalkane polymer and vinylalkane polymer (as discussed in more detail below), and (v) mixtures thereof. Such additives are generally commercially available and are described, for example, in "Plastic Additives Handbook", 5th edition, 2001 of Hans Zweifel, pages 871 to 873. Preferably the second heterophasic propylene copolymer (HECO-2) contains up to 5.0 wt.-% of the a-nucleating agent. In a preferred embodiment, the second heterophasic propylene copolymer (HECO-2) contains not more than 200 ppm, more preferably of 1 to 200 ppm, more preferably of 5 to 100 ppm of a α-nucleating agent, in particular selected from the group consisting of dibenzylidenesorbitol (e.g. 1,3 : 2,4 dibenzylidene sorbitol), dibenzylidenesorbitol derivative, preferably dimethyldibenzylidenesorbitol (e.g. 1 ,3 : 2,4 di(methylbenzylidene) sorbitol), or substituted nonitol-derivatives, such as 1,2,3,-trideoxy- 4,6:5,7-bis-0-[(4-propylphenyl)methylene]-nonitol, vinylcycloalkane polymer, vinylalkane polymer, and mixtures thereof. It is especially preferred the second heterophasic propylene copolymer (HECO-2) contains a vinylcycloalkane, like vinylcyclohexane (V CH), polymer and/or vinylalkane polymer. In one specific embodiment the second heterophasic propylene copolymer (HECO-2) contains a vinylcycloalkane, like vinylcyclohexane (VCH), polymer and/or vinylalkane polymer. Preferably the vinylcycloalkane is vinylcyclohexane (V CH) polymer introduced into the second heterophasic propylene copolymer (HECO-2) by the BNT technology. The second heterophasic propylene copolymer (HECO-2) according to this invention is commercially available. Accordingly a skilled person in the art is in a position to produce a second heterophasic propylene copolymer (HECO-2) as defined herein. The second heterophasic propylene copolymer (HECO-2) is preferably obtained by a specific process. Accordingly the second heterophasic propylene copolymer (HECO-2) is preferably obtained by a sequential polymerization process, in the first reactor (1st R') and optionally in a second reactor (2nd R') the propylene homopolymer (H-PP2) is produced, whereas in the third reactor (3rd R') and optionally in a fourth reactor (4th R') the elastomeric propylene copolymer (E2) of the second heterbphasic propylene copolymer (HECO-2) is obtained. The term "sequential polymerization process" indicates that the second heterophasic propylene copolymer (HECO-2) is produced in at least two reactors, preferably in three or four reactors, connected in series. Accordingly the present process comprises at least a first reactor (1st R'), an optional second reactor (2nd R'), a third reactor (3rd R') and optional a fourth reactor (4th R'). The term "polymerization reactor" shall indicate that the main polymerization takes place. Thus in case the process consists of three or four polymerization reactors, this definition does not exclude the option that the overall process comprises for instance a pre-polymerization step in a pre-polymerization reactor. The term "consist of is only a closing formulation in view of the main polymerization reactors. As stated above in the first (1st R') or in the first two reactors (1st and 2nd R') the matrix (M2), i.e. the propylene homopolymer (H-PP-2) is produced. In case two reactors are used for the preparation of the propylene homopolymer (H-PP-2), in each reactor a propylene homopolymer fraction (H-PP-2a) and (H-PP-2b) is produced which may differ or be the same in the melt flow rate as indicated above. Preferably the first propylene homopolymer fraction (H-PP-2a) is produced in the first reactor (1 R') whereas the second propylene homopolymer fraction (H-PP-2b) is produced in the second reactor (2nd R'). Preferably the weight ratio between the first propylene homopolymer fraction (H-PP-2a) and second propylene homopolymer fraction (H-PP-2b) is 20/80 to 80/20, more preferably 30/70 to 70/30, yet more preferably 40/60 to 65/35. After the first reactor (1st R') or optional second reactor (2nd R') the matrix (M2), i.e. the propylene homopolymer (H-PP-2), of the second heterophasic propylene copolymer (HECO- 2), is obtained. This matrix (M2) is subsequently transferred into the third reactor (3rd R') and optional fourth reactor (4th R') in which the elastomeric propylene copolymer (E-2) is produced and thus the second heterophasic propylene copolymer (HECO-2) of the instant invention is obtained. The first reactor (1st R') is preferably a slurry reactor (SR) and can be any continuous or simple stirred batch tank reactor or loop reactor operating in bulk or slurry. Bulk means a polymerization in a reaction medium that comprises of at least 60 % (w/w) monomer. According to the present invention the slurry reactor (SR) is preferably a (bulk) loop reactor (LR). The second reactor (2nd R'), the third reactor (3rd R') and fourth reactor (4th R') are preferably gas phase reactors (GPR). Such gas phase reactors (GPR) can be any mechanically mixed or fluid bed reactors. Preferably the gas phase reactors (GPR) comprise a mechanically agitated fluid bed reactor with gas velocities of at least 0.2 m/sec. Thus it is appreciated that the gas phase reactor is a fluidized bed type reactor preferably with a mechanical stirrer. Thus in a preferred embodiment the first reactor (1st R') is a slurry reactor (SR), like loop reactor (LR), whereas the second reactor (2nd R'), the third reactor (3rd R') and the optional fourth reactor (4th R') are gas phase reactors (GPR). Accordingly for the instant process at least two, preferably at least two or three polymerization reactors, namely a slurry reactor (SR), like loop reactor (LR), a first gas phase reactor (GPR-1), a second gas phase reactor (GPR-2) and optionally a third gas phase reactor (GPR-3) connected in series are used. If needed, prior to the slurry reactor (SR) a pre-polymerization reactor is placed. A preferred multistage process is a "loop-gas phase"-process, such as developed by Borealis A/S, Denmark (known as BORSTAR® technology) described e.g. in patent literature, such as in EP 0 887 379, WO 92/12182 WO 2004/000899, WO 2004/111095, WO 99/24478, WO 99/24479 or in WO 00/68315. A further suitable slurry-gas phase process is the Spheripol® process of Basell. Preferably, in the instant process for producing the second heterophasic propylene copolymer (HECO-2), as defined above the conditions for the first reactor (1st R'), i.e. the slurry reactor (SR), like a loop reactor (LR), may be as follows: the temperature is within the range of 40 °C to 110 °C, preferably between 60 °C and 100 °C, like 68 to 95 °C, » the pressure is within the range of 20 bar to 80 bar, preferably between 40 bar to 70 bar, hydrogen can be added for controlling the molar mass in a manner known per se. Subsequently, the reaction mixture from the first reactor (1st R') is transferred to the second reactor (2nd R'), i.e. gas phase reactor (GPR-1), whereby the conditions are preferably as follows: the temperature is within the range of 50 °C to 130 °C, preferably between 60 °C and 100 °C, - the pressure is within the range of 5 bar to 50 bar, preferably between 15 bar to 35 bar, hydrogen can be added for controlling the molar mass in a manner known per se. The condition in the third reactor (3rd R') and the fourth reactor (4th R'), preferably in the second gas phase reactor (GPR-2) and third gas phase reactor (GPR-3), are similar to the second reactor (2nd R'). The residence time can vary in the three or four reactor zones. In one embodiment of the process for producing the second heterophasic propylene copolymer (HECO-2), the residence time in the first reactor (1st R'), i.e. the slurry reactor (SR), like a loop reactor (LR), is in the range 0.2 to 4 hours, e.g. 0.3 to 1.5 hours and the residence time in the gas phase reactors will generally be 0.2 to 6.0 hours, like 0.5 to 4.0 hours. If desired, the polymerization may be effected in a known manner under supercritical conditions in the first reactor (1st R'), i.e. in the slurry reactor (SR), like in the loop reactor (LR), and/or as a condensed mode in the gas phase reactors (GPR). Preferably the process comprises also a prepolymerization with the catalyst system, as mentioned below, comprising a Ziegler-Natta procatalyst, an external donor and optionally a cocatalyst. In a preferred embodiment, the prepolymerization is conducted as bulk slurry polymerization in liquid propylene, i.e. the liquid phase mainly comprises propylene, with minor amount of other reactants and optionally inert components dissolved therein. The prepolymerization reaction is typically conducted at a temperature of 0 to 50 °C, preferably from 10 to 45 °C, and more preferably from 15 to 40 °C. The pressure in the prepolymerization reactor is not critical but must be sufficiently high to maintain the reaction mixture in liquid phase. Thus, the pressure may be from 20 to 100 bar, for example 30 to 70 bar. The catalyst components are preferably all introduced to the prepolymerization step. However, where the solid catalyst component (i) and the cocatalyst (ii) can be fed separately, it is possible that only a part of the cocatalyst is introduced into the prepolymerization stage and the remaining part into subsequent polymerization stages. Also in such cases it is necessary to introduce so much cocatalyst into the prepolymerization stage that a sufficient polymerization reaction is obtained therein. It is possible to add other components also to the prepolymerization stage. Thus, hydrogen may be added into the prepolymerization stage to control the molecular weight of the prepolymer as is known in the art. Further, antistatic additive may be used to prevent the particles from adhering to each other or to the walls of the reactor. The precise control of the prepolymerization conditions and reaction parameters is within the skill of the art. According to the invention, the second heterophasic propylene copolymer (HECO-2) is obtained by a sequential polymerization process, as described above, in the presence of a catalyst system comprising a Ziegler-Natta catalyst and optionally an external donor, preferably a catalyst system comprising three components, namely as component (i) a Ziegler-Natta procatalyst, and optionally as component (ii) an organometallic cocatalyst and as component (iii) an external donor represented by formula (Ilia) or (Illb), preferably represented by formula (Ilia), as described above in accordance with the preparation of the first heterophasic propylene copolymer (HECO-1). More preferably the external donor is of formula (Ilia), like dicyclopentyl dimethoxy silane [Si(OCH3)2(cyclo-pentyl)2] or diisopropyl dimethoxy silane [Si(OCH3)2(CH(CH3)2)2] . Elastomeric ethylene copolymer (EEC) A further essential component of the present polypropylene composition (PP) is at least one elastomeric ethylene copolymer (EEC). The at least one elastomeric ethylene copolymer (EEC) is added to the polypropylene composition (PP) according to the present invention for improving impact strength. The expression "at least one" elastomeric ethylene copolymer (EEC) means that one or more kinds of elastomeric ethylene copolymer (EEC) may be added to the polypropylene composition (PP) in combination with the first heterophasic propylene copolymer (HECO- 1 ) and the second heterophasic propylene copolymer (HECO-2). Accordingly, the at least one elastomeric ethylene copolymer (EEC) may be one kind of an elastomeric ethylene copolymer (EEC).

The at least one elastomeric ethylene copolymer (EEC) is known in the art and belongs in a preferred embodiment to the Exact™ of Exxon, Tafmer™ of Mitsui and Engage™ of Dow, series, respectively. One important aspect of the present invention is that the amount of the at least one elastomeric ethylene copolymer (EEC) in the polypropylene composition (PP) is rather low. Accordingly, it is preferred that the at least one elastomeric ethylene copolymer (EEC) is present in the polypropylene composition (PP) according to the present invention in an amount of between 5.0 and 15.0 wt.-%, preferably in an amount between 8.0 and 15.0 wt.-%, more preferably in an amount between 10.0 and 15.0 wt.-%, based on the total weight of the polypropylene composition (PP).

Inorganic filler (F) As another essential component, the polypropylene composition (PP) according to the present invention comprises an inorganic filler (F). The inorganic filler (F) is added to the polypropylene composition (PP) according to the present invention for improving stiffness, especially flexural modulus. The inorganic filler (F) is present in the polypropylene composition (PP) in an amount of from 6.0 to 14.0 wt.-%, based on the total weight of the polypropylene composition (PP). It is preferred that the amount of inorganic filler (F) is in the range of from 8.0 to 12.0 wt.-%, more preferably in the range of from 9.0 to 12.0 wt.-%, and even more preferably in the range of from 10.0 to 12.0 wt.-% based on the total weight of the polypropylene composition (PP).

It is preferred that the inorganic filler (F) is present in a specific weight ratio relative to the combined first and second heterophasic propylene copolymer (FIECO-1) and (HECO-2) in the polypropylene composition (PP). For example, the weight ratio of the combined heterophasic propylene copolymers (HECO-1) and (HECO-2) to the inorganic filler (F) [HECO-1 +HECO-2 / F] is from 13.6 to 4.3.

More preferably, the polypropylene composition (PP) has a melt flow rate MFR2 (230 °C, 2.16 kg) measured according to ISO 1133 in the range of from 17.0 to 28.0 g/lOmin and most preferably in the range of from 18.0 to 25.0 g/lOmin. It is appreciated that the polypropylene composition (PP) according to the present invention may further (optionally) comprise at least one typical additive selected from the group consisting of acid scavengers, antioxidants, colorants, pigments, light stabilizers, UV- stabilizers, slip agents, anti-scratch agents, dispersing agents, carriers and colorants. For improving dispersion of said at least one additive in the polypropylene composition (PP), the at least one additive is preferably added by using a polypropylene powder as a carrier. Preferably, the amount of the at least one additive and carrier (excluding the inorganic filler (F) and alpha-nucleating agents) shall not exceed 10.0 wt.-%, preferably not more than 9.0 wt.-%, and most preferably not more than 7.0 wt.-% based on the total weight of the polypropylene composition (PP), within the instant polypropylene composition (PP). The instant polypropylene composition (PP) contains preferably an a-nucleating agent. Even more preferred the present invention is free of β-nucleating agents. According to the present invention the nucleating agent is understood as a nucleating agent different to the inorganic filler (F). Accordingly, the nucleating agent is preferably selected from the group consisting of (i) salts of monocarboxylic acids and polycarboxylic acids, e.g. sodium benzoate or aluminum tert-butylbenzoate, and (ii) dibenzylidenesorbitol (e.g. 1,3 : 2,4 dibenzylidenesorbitol) and C C8-alkyl- substituted dibenzylidenesorbitol derivatives, such as methyldibenzylidenesorbitol, ethyldibenzylidenesorbitol or dimethyldibenzylidenesorbitol (e.g. 1,3 : 2,4 di(methylbenzylidene) sorbitol), or substituted nonitol-derivatives, such as 1 ,2,3,- trideoxy-4,6:5,7-bis-0-[(4-propylphenyl)methylene]-nonitol, and (iii) salts of diesters of phosphoric acid, e.g. sodium 2,2'-methylenebis (4, 6,-di-tert- butylphenyl) phosphate or aluminium-hydroxy-bis[2,2'-methylene-bis(4,6-di-t- butylphenyl)phosphate], and (iv) vinylcycloalkane polymer and vinylalkane polymer (as discussed above), and (v) mixtures thereof. Such additives are generally commercially available and are described, for example, in "Plastic Additives Handbook", 5th edition, 2001 of Hans Zweifel. Most preferably the a-nucleating agent is part of the first and/or second heterophasic propylene copolymer (HECO-1) and (HECO-2) of the polypropylene composition (PP). Accordingly the a-nucleating agent content of the two essential heterophasic propylene copolymers (HECO-1) and (HECO-2) arid thus of the polypropylene composition (PP) is preferably up to 5.0 wt.-%. In a preferred embodiment, the two essential heterophasic propylene copolymers (HECO-1) and (HECO-2) and thus the polypropylene composition (PP) contain(s) not more than 3,000 ppm, more preferably of 1 to 2,000 ppm of a a- nucleating agent, in particular selected from the group consisting of dibenzylidenesorbitol (e.g. 1,3 : 2,4 dibenzylidene sorbitol), dibenzylidenesorbitol derivative, preferably dimethyldibenzylidenesorbitol (e.g. 1 ,3 : 2,4 di(methylbenzylidene) sorbitol), or substituted nonitol-derivatives, such as l,2,3,-trideoxy-4,6:5,7-bis-0-[(4-propylphenyl)methylene]- nonitol, vinylcycloalkane polymer, vinylalkane polymer, and mixtures thereof. In a preferred embodiment the two essential heterophasic propylene copolymers (HECO-1) and (HECO-2) and thus the polypropylene composition (PP) contains a vinylcycloalkane, like vinylcyclohexane (VCH), polymer and/or vinylalkane polymer, as the a-nucleating agent. Preferably in this embodiment, the two essential heterophasic propylene copolymers (HECO-1) and (HECO-2) contain a vinylcycloalkane, like vinylcyclohexane (VCH), polymer and/or vinylalkane polymer, preferably vinylcyclohexane (VCH). Preferably the vinylcycloalkane is vinylcyclohexane (V CH) polymer which is optionally introduced into at least one of the two essential heterophasic propylene copolymers (HECO-1) and (HECO-2) and thus into the polypropylene composition (PP) by the BNT technology. More preferably in this preferred embodiment, the amount of vinylcycloalkane, like vinylcyclohexane (VCH), polymer and/or vinylalkane polymer, more preferably of vinylcyclohexane (V CH) polymer, in the two essential heterophasic propylene copolymers (HECO-1) and (HECO-2) is not more than 500 ppm, more preferably of 0.5 to 200 ppm, most preferably 1 to 100 ppm,. Accordingly it is thus preferred that the polypropylene composition (PP) contains not more than 500 ppm, more preferably of 0.1 to 200 ppm, most preferably 0.2 to 100 ppm, of vinylcyclohexane (VCH) polymer. With regard to the BNT-technology, reference is made to the international applications WO 99/24478, WO 99/24479 and particularly WO 00/68315. According to this technology a catalyst system, preferably a Ziegler-Natta procatalyst, can be modified by polymerising a vinyl compound in the presence of the catalyst system, comprising in particular the special Ziegler-Natta procatalyst, an external donor and a cocatalyst, which vinyl compound has the formula: CH2=CH-CHR3R4 wherein R3 and R4 together form a 5- or 6-membered saturated, unsaturated or aromatic ring or independently represent an alkyl group comprising 1 to 4 carbon atoms, and the modified catalyst is used for the preparation of the heterophasic polypropylene according to this invention, i.e. of the heterophasic propylene copolymers (HECO-1) and (HECO-2). The polymerized vinyl compound acts as an a-nucleating agent. The weight ratio of vinyl compound to solid catalyst component in the modification step of the catalyst is preferably of up to 5 (5: 1), preferably up to 3 (3: 1) most preferably from 0.5 (1 :2) to 2 (2: 1). The most preferred vinyl compound is vinylcyclohexane (VCH). The polypropylene composition (PP) can be prepared by blending the heterophasic propylene copolymers (HECO-1 and HECO-2) with the elastomeric ethylene copolymer (EEC), the inorganic filler (F) and optional additives in an extruder, and extruding the obtained blend of the heterophasic propylene copolymers (HECO-1 and HECO-2), elastomeric ethylene copolymer (EEC), the inorganic filler (F), and optional additives in the extruder. The term "blending" refers according to the present invention to the action of providing a blend out of at least two different, pre-existing materials, i.e. the heterophasic propylene copolymers (HECO-1 and HECO-2), elastomeric ethylene copolymer (EEC), the inorganic filler (F), and optional additives. For blending the individual components of the instant composition, i.e. the heterophasic propylene copolymers (HECO-1 and FfECO-2), elastomeric ethylene copolymer (EEC), the inorganic filler (F), and optional additives, a conventional compounding or blending apparatus, e.g. a Banbury mixer, a 2-roll rubber mill, Buss-co-kneader or a twin screw extruder may be used. The polymer materials recovered from the extruder are usually in the form of pellets. These pellets are then preferably further processed, e.g. by injection moulding to generate articles and products of the inventive composition. The polypropylene compositions (PP) of the present invention are suitable for a wide range of applications. In particular, it is appreciated that the instant polypropylene compositions (PP) maintain highly desired mechanical properties, such as excellent stiffness and impact strength, while further exhibiting improved flowability. The polypropylene compositions (PP) of the present invention are thus suitable for injection moulding processes requiring a short cycle time. In view of the very good results obtained with regard to the instant polypropylene composition (PP), said polypropylene composition (PP) is particularly suitable for the preparation of moulded articles. Thus, another aspect of the present invention is directed to an article comprising the polypropylene composition (PP) as defined above. For example, the article comprises the polypropylene composition (PP) in an amount of at least 60.0 wt.-%, more preferably at least 80.0 wt.-% and most preferably at least 95.0 wt.-%, based on the total weight of the article. In one embodiment of the present invention, the article consists of the instant polypropylene composition (PP). It is preferred that the article is a moulded article, preferably an injection moulded article. Preferred examples of such injection moulded articles are large parts for applications in the automotive or household industry. For example, the present invention is directed to automotive articles, especially to car interiors and exteriors, like bumpers, body panels, spoilers, dashboards and/or door panels. Accordingly the present invention is especially directed to automotive articles, especially to car interiors and exteriors, like bumpers, body panels, spoilers, dashboards, door panels and the like, in particular bumpers and/or door panels, comprising at least 60.0 wt.-%, more preferably at least 80.0 wt.-%, yet more preferably at least 95.0 wt.-%, like consisting, of the instant polypropylene composition (PP). Accordingly, a further aspect of the invention is directed to the use of the polypropylene composition (PP) as defined above for the preparation of a moulded article. It is preferred that the polypropylene composition (PP) as defined above is used for the preparation of an injection moulded article. The present invention will now be described in further detail by the examples provided below. E X A M P L E S 1. Definitions/Measuring Methods The following definitions of terms and determination methods apply for the above general description of the invention as well as to the below examples unless otherwise defined. Quantification of microstructure by NMR spectroscopy Quantitative nuclear-magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy was used to quantify the isotacticity and regio-regularity of the polypropylene homopolymers. Quantitative 13€{Ή} NMR spectra were recorded in the solution-state using a Bruker Advance III 400 NMR spectrometer operating at 400.15 and 100.62 MHz for H and 13C respectively. All spectra were recorded using a 13C optimised 10 mm extended temperature probehead at 125°C using nitrogen gas for all pneumatics. For polypropylene homopolymers approximately 200 mg of material was dissolved in 1,2- tetrachloroethane-<¾ (TCE-<¾). To ensure a homogenous solution, after initial sample preparation in a heat block, the NMR tube was further heated in a rotatable oven for at least 1 hour. Upon insertion into the magnet the tube was spun at 10 Hz. This setup was chosen primarily for the high resolution needed for tacticity distribution quantification (Busico, V., Cipullo, R., Prog. Polym. Sci. 26 (2001) 443; Busico, V.; Cipullo, R., Monaco, G., Vacatello, M., Segre, A.L., Macromolecules 30 (1997) 6251). Standard single-pulse excitation was employed utilising the NOE and bi-level WALTZ16 decoupling scheme (Zhou, Z., Kuemmerle, R., Qiu, X., Redwine, D., Cong, R., Taha, A., Baugh, D. Winniford, B., J. Mag. Reson. 187 (2007) 225; Busico, V., Carbonniere, P., Cipullo, R., Pellecchia, R., Severn, J., Talarico, G., Macromol. Rapid Commun. 2007, 28, 11289). A total of 8192 (8k) transients were acquired per spectra. Quantitative 13C{!H} MR spectra were processed, integrated and relevant quantitative properties determined from the integrals using proprietary computer programs. For polypropylene homopolymers all chemical shifts are internally referenced to the methyl isotactic pentad (mmmm) at 21.85 ppm. Characteristic signals corresponding to regio defects (Resconi, L., Cavallo, L., Fait, A., Piemontesi, F., Chem. Rev. 2000, 100, 1253;; Wang, W-J., Zhu, S., Macromolecules 33 (2000), 1157; Cheng, H. N., Macromolecules 17 (1984), 1950) or comonomer were observed. The tacticity distribution was quantified through integration of the methyl region between 23.6-19.7 ppm correcting for any sites not related to the stereo sequences of interest (Busico, V., Cipullo, R., Prog. Polym. Sci. 26 (2001) 443; Busico, V., Cipullo, R., Monaco, G., Vacatello, M., Segre, A.L., Macromolecules 30 (1997) 6251). Specifically the influence of regio-defects and comonomer on the quantification of the tacticity distribution was corrected for by subtraction of representative regio-defect and comonomer integrals from the specific integral regions of the stereo sequences. The isotacticity was determined at the pentad level and reported as the percentage of isotactic pentad (mmmm) sequences with respect to all pentad sequences: [mmmm] % = 100 * (mmmm / sum of all pentads) The presence of 2, 1 erythro regio-defects was indicated by the presence of the two methyl sites at 17.7 and 17.2 ppm and confirmed by other characteristic sites. Characteristic signals corresponding to other types of regio-defects were not observed (Resconi, L., Cavallo, L., Fait, A., Piemontesi, F., Chem. Rev. 2000, 100, 1253). The amount of 2,1 erythro regio-defects was quantified using the average integral of the two characteristic methyl sites at 17.7 and 17.2 ppm: The amount of 1 ,2 primary inserted propene was quantified based on the methyl region with correction undertaken for sites included in this region not related to primary insertion and for primary insertion sites excluded from this region: The total amount of propene was quantified as the sum of primary inserted propene and all other present regio-defects: Ptotal = Pl2 + P21e The mole percent of 2, 1 erythro regio-defects was quantified with respect to all propene: [21 e] mol.-% = 100 * (P21e / Ptotal) Characteristic signals corresponding to the incorporation of ethylene were observed (as described in Cheng, H. N., Macromolecules 1984, 17, 1950) and the comonomer fraction calculated as the fraction of ethylene in the polymer with respect to all monomer in the polymer. The comonomer fraction was quantified using the method of W-J. Wang and S. Zhu, Macromolecules 2000, 33 1157 , through integration of multiple signals across the whole spectral region in the "C l'H} spectra. This method was chosen for its robust nature and ability to account for the presence of regio-defects when needed. Integral regions were slightly adjusted to increase applicability across the whole range of encountered comonomer contents.

The hetrophasic propylene copolymers HECO-1 and HECO-2 were used for the inventive examples, which were prepared respectively with one slurry loop reactor and three/two gas phase reactors by the known Borstar® technology, as disclosed in such as EP 0,887,379 Al . The catalyst used in the polymerization processes for HECO-1 and HECO-2 has been produced by the publically known method as follows: First, 0.1 mol of MgCl2 x 3 EtOH was suspended under inert conditions in 250 ml of decane in a reactor at atmospheric pressure. The solution was cooled to the temperature of -15°C and 300 ml of cold TiCl4 was added while maintaining the temperature at said level. Then, the temperature of the slurry was increased slowly to 20 °C. At this temperature, 0.02 mol of dioctylphthalate (DOP) was added to the slurry. After the addition of the phthalate, the temperature was raised to 135 °C during 90 minutes and the slurry was allowed to stand for 60 minutes. Then, another 300 ml of TiCl4 was added and the temperature was kept at 135 °C for 120 minutes. After this, the catalyst was filtered from the liquid and washed six times with 300 ml heptane at 80 °C. Then, the solid catalyst component was filtered and dried. Catalyst and its preparation concept is described in detail e.g. in patent publications EP491566, EP591224 or EP586390. The catalyst was prepolymerized with vinyl cyclohexane in an amount to achieve a concentration of 200 ppm poly(vinyl cyclohexane) (PVCH) in the final polymer (see EP 1 183307 Al). As co-catalyst, triethyl-aluminium (TEAL) was used. As donor for the preparation of HECO-1 and HECO-2, dicyclo pentyl dimethoxy silane (D- donor) was used. The aluminium to donor ratio is indicated in table 1.
