INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE TO ANY PRIORITY APPLICATIONS Any and all applications for which a foreign or domestic priority claim is identified in the Application Data Sheet as filed with the present application are hereby incorporated by reference under 37 CFR 1.57. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention This application is directed toward adjustment mechanisms, which can be incorporated in furniture, such as office furniture, and more particularly to a chair back height adjustment mechanism. 2. Description of the Related Art Many specialized types of seating furniture benefit from adjustability of their parts to conform to the particular size of the individual sitting on the furniture. This may include back height adjustment, seat tilt or forward/back extension adjustment, lumbar adjustment, etc. Chairs of this kind may also include armrests that adjust in height relative to the chair body. In some configurations, components of adjustable office chairs are adjusted with a rotatable knob which controls a frictional clamping relationship. One hand may be used to adjust the height of adjustable member and the other hand may be used to rotate the knob to clamp the adjustable member at a desired height. However, this mechanism requires the user to first rotate the knob to release the clamping force and then rotate the knob again to re-engage the clamping force. This requires a significant amount of hand strength and, thus, may be difficult for some users to perform. Other chair adjustment mechanisms include a lever-based system in which teeth of the adjustment mechanism engage slots or notches. Typically, such mechanisms allow adjustment only in discrete, predetermined intervals. Furthermore, adjustment of a chair back in a reverse direction (such as down) may only be done after pulling the chair back fully in one direction (such as up), to release the mechanism and allow the adjustment mechanism to reset. These types of adjusting mechanisms are common due to being uncomplicated and inexpensive to produce. However, these designs have substantial disadvantages in that they are not infinitely adjustable and/or are not easy to adjust with one hand. Additionally, a set-screw-type connection may require substantial force to insure that the part to be adjusted does not slip from its desired position. This may cause user discomfort and may be difficult for some users to operate. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present application is directed toward adjustment mechanisms, such as adjustment mechanisms for furniture or similar items. Embodiments of the adjustment mechanisms are particularly illustrated in the context of a chair adjustment mechanism. The term “chair,” as used herein, is a broad term and is used in accordance with its ordinary meaning to include office chairs, desk chairs, dining chairs, or any adjustable chair. It is an object of the application to provide adjustment mechanisms that are infinitely adjustable and easy to use.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS Embodiments of an adjustable mechanism are disclosed herein. The embodiments disclosed herein often are described in the context of an adjustable mechanism for use with an office chair. In some aspects, an adjustment mechanism could comprise a rod threaded through at least one or, in some arrangements, two retention elements or arms, which are embodied as J-shaped members in the illustrated configurations. Thus, references to “J-shaped members” herein are used for convenience and may also refer to other retention elements unless otherwise indicated. Separation of the J-shaped members apart from each other, or tilting movement of the J-shaped members relative to the rod, increases the friction of each member on the rod, allowing a seat back height or forward/aft movement of a seat to be infinitely adjustable along the length of the rod. FIG. 1 illustrates an office chair 100 configured with an adjustment assembly configured to adjust the back height of the chair. The office chair 100 may also have an adjustment assembly 202 to adjust the height of an armrest 200. The adjustment assembly discussed below may also be used to adjust a relative position of any two portions of the chair, such as the height of the armrests of the chair, the fore or aft position of the seat, or the height of the seat. Similarly, the disclosed embodiments may be used to allow adjustment of a relative position of any two portions of other types of furniture or similar objects or items, such as height adjustment of a desk (i.e., movement of desk top relative to base or legs to adjust the height of the work surface). FIG. 2 illustrates one embodiment of an adjustment assembly 102 configured to adjust the back height of an office chair. With reference to FIGS. 2 and 3, an adjustment assembly 102 can include an adjustment assembly housing 104 containing an adjustment mechanism 110. The adjustment assembly housing 104 may have any one or more of a front surface 154, a rear surface 156, a top surface 150, a bottom surface 152, and two side surfaces 158, 160 and may be made of any rigid material, such as metal or plastic. In some embodiments, the rear surface 156 of the adjustment assembly housing 104 may be attached to one portion (e.g., a seat back) of an adjustable chair to allow the adjustable seat back to move relative to the chair frame. In other embodiments, the adjustment assembly housing 104 may be attached to any adjustable member of a chair or furnishing on one end and to a rigid frame member of the chair or other furnishing on the other end such that the adjustment mechanism can provide adjustment of the adjustable member relative to the rigid frame member. The adjustment mechanism 110 can comprise an adjusting rod 106, a frame 112, one or more adjusting members 120, 122, a securing member 126 and a spreading member 128. The threaded adjusting rod may have a bolt head that abuts the top surface 150 of the adjustment assembly housing 104. The frame 112 is capable of sliding vertically along the adjusting rod 106. Within the frame 112 may be two sliding members 114 and 116 that align the frame 112 within the adjustment assembly housing 104 to prevent rotation of the frame 112 around the adjusting rod 106. The sliding members 114, 116 may be aligned with ridges, grooves, or rails longitudinally placed on the inner surfaces of the side surfaces 158, 160 of the adjustment assembly housing 104 to guide the frame 112 as it slides within the adjustment assembly housing 104. Other guide arrangements could be used, such as a set of rods aligned on either side of the adjustment assembly housing 104 or another type of anti-rotation device. With continuing reference to FIGS. 2 and 3, the adjusting rod 106 may be inserted through openings in the top and bottom surface of the frame 112 and through two generally J-shaped adjusting members 120, 122. In some embodiments, the adjusting rod 106 may have a circular or oblong cross-section. In other embodiments, the adjusting rod 106 may have a non-circular cross-section, such as a rectangular cross-section. In some embodiments, the adjusting rod 106 may be a structural support portion of the chair, such as a J-bar member. In this embodiment, the adjusting members 120, 122 may be configured with slots instead of holes such that the adjusting members 120, 122 slot onto the J-bar member. A securing member 126 may be secured to the frame 112 using fasteners 142. The J-shaped adjusting members 120, 122 may be substantially rectangular shaped members with one end curved or angled to form a “J” shape. The J-shaped adjusting members 120, 122 may be formed from metal, plastic, or another rigid material. In some embodiments, the adjusting members 120, 122 are located adjacent to each other such that one adjusting member 120 is a mirror image of the second adjusting member 122. In other words, the adjusting members 120, 122 are aligned such that the straight portions of each adjusting member 120, 122 are adjacent and the curved portions of each adjusting member 120, 122 are adjacent. The curved portions of each adjusting member 120, 122 preferably face in substantially opposite directions such that a wedge-shaped opening is formed between the curved portions. One end of the J-shaped adjusting members 120, 122, preferably the straight portions, may be secured within a notch in the securing member 126 or by any other arrangement that permits pivoting of the J-shaped adjusting members 120, 122. A spreading member 128 may be slidably secured to the frame 112 such that it may slide horizontally within the frame 112. The spreading member 128 may include one or more slots 132, 134. The slots 132, 134 can receive the opposite, or angled, ends of the adjusting members 120, 122. The slots 132, 134 of the spreading member 128 may be angled such that a generally triangular wedge 130 is formed between them. In some embodiments, a triangular wedge 130 may be formed without the slots 132, 134; however, slots 132, 134 are a preferred configuration to capture and better control the movement of the J-shaped adjusting members 120, 122. In a neutral, or adjustable, position such as that shown in FIG. 2, the adjusting mechanism 110 and frame 112 can slide with little or no resistance vertically along the adjusting rod 106. In this configuration, the adjusting members 120, 122 are aligned substantially orthogonal to the vertical axis defined by the adjusting rod 106. The wedge 130 of the spreading member 128 can be used to push apart the adjusting members 120, 122, decreasing the angle that each adjusting member 120, 122 makes with a vertical or longitudinal axis defined by the adjusting rod 106. As will be described in further detail below, separation of the adjusting members 120, 122 increases the friction or retention force between the adjusting members 120, 122 and the adjusting rod 106 to allow the adjusting members 120, 122 to exert a clamping force on the adjusting rod 106. Due to the lack of notches or other discrete adjustment intervals, infinite adjustment of the adjustment mechanism 110 along the adjusting rod 106 may be possible with this arrangement. The spreading member 128 can be spring-loaded such that a spring force pushes the spreading member 128 towards the adjusting members 120, 122, spreading them apart and securing the adjustment mechanism 110 in a fixed position on the rod 106. With continued reference to FIGS. 2 and 3, the curved ends of the adjusting members 120, 122 can slide within the slots 132, 134 to facilitate the separation of the adjusting members 120, 122. The slots 132, 134 may be arranged at an angle a from a horizontal line A orthogonal to the vertical or longitudinal axis defined by the adjusting rod 106. As the spreading member 128 moves toward the adjusting rod, the wedge 130 separates the adjusting members 120, 122, forcing one adjusting member to move generally in one direction and the other adjusting member to move generally in the opposite direction. The increased separation of the adjusting members 120, 122 increases the friction between the adjusting rod 106 and the adjusting members 120, 122 at the point where the adjusting rod 106 passes through each adjusting members 120, 122. The increased friction between the adjusting rod 106 and the adjusting members 120, 122 is due to increased resistance on the adjusting rod 106 due to the angle of the adjusting members 120, 122 with respect to the longitudinal axis defined by the adjusting rod 106. As the separation distance between the angled ends of the adjusting members 120, 122 increases, the ability of the adjusting rod 106 to pass smoothly through the holes in the adjusting members 120, 122 will decrease. As the adjusting members 120, 122 depart from an orthogonal orientation with the adjusting rod 106 (that is, the angle between the adjusting members 120, 122 increases) the adjusting members 120, 122 will act as a clamp on the adjusting rod 106, limiting further movement of the adjustment mechanism 110 along the adjusting rod 106. One embodiment of an adjustment mechanism 110 in a gripping configuration for a back seat height adjustment for an office chair is shown in FIGS. 4 and 5. As discussed above, in this configuration the wedge 130 of the spreading member 128 has spread apart the adjusting members 120, 122, increasing the separation distance between them. The increased separation distance between the adjusting members 120, 122 limits the movement of the adjustment mechanism 110 along the adjusting rod 106. The spreading member 128 may be acted on by a force component to force apart the adjusting members 120, 122 and clamp the adjustment mechanism 110 in place at any point along the adjusting rod 106. The force component may be a spring or other force exerting element. In some embodiments, the spreading member 128 may be biased to a locking or gripping position of the adjustment mechanism. Therefore, the height of the seat back of an office chair, as shown in FIG. 4, may be set at any point along the adjusting rod 106 by pushing the spreading member 128 away from the adjusting rod 106 to release the clamping force, raising or lowering the seat back height to the desired level, and then releasing the spreading member 128, allowing it to force apart the adjusting members 120, 122 and apply a clamping force on the adjusting rod 106 at the desired height. Any suitable mechanism can be used to move the spreading member 128 away from the adjusting rod 106 to release the clamping force. In a preferred embodiment, this mechanism is external to the adjustment assembly housing 104 so that adjustment may be easily accessible. The spreading member 128 may be separated from the adjusting rod 106 using either pulling or pushing force. As shown in FIG. 5, the adjustment mechanism may be locked in a gripping position by locking member 146. Locking member 146 may be a pin inserted within an opening 136 in the spreading member 128. When the adjustment mechanism is in a gripping position, the locking member 146 may fit within a groove 148 in the frame 112 to prevent further movement of the spreading member. FIGS. 6-10 illustrate an office chair configured with an adjustable seat back height adjustment assembly 102 according to one embodiment. The adjustment mechanism 110 as shown in these figures is in the released configuration such that the adjusting members 120, 122 are not applying a clamping force on the adjusting rod 106. As illustrated, the adjustment mechanism 110 may be raised or lowered along the adjusting rod 106 within the adjustment assembly housing 104 to adjust the seat back height to any position along the adjusting rod 106. Although a preferred embodiment of the adjustment mechanism 110 includes a pair of adjusting members 120, 122, an alternative configuration can utilize a single one of the adjusting members 120, 122 and the other adjusting member 120, 122 can be omitted. Such an arrangement would permit adjustment as described above in one direction and would permit essentially unrestricted movement in the other direction. Such an arrangement would provide operation similar to other chair adjustment mechanisms presently marketed. In particular, in one configuration, the chair back could be moved upwardly essentially without restriction because the movement of the rod 106 would tend to move the adjusting member 122 toward an orthogonal position. However, the adjustment assembly 102 would inhibit downward movement of the chair back unless purposely released. As shown in FIG. 10, the adjustment assembly housing 104 may be attached to the seat back of an office chair in order to raise and lower the seat back height. In other embodiments, an adjustment mechanism 202 may be used to raise and lower the height of one or more armrests 200, to raise or lower the chair seat, or to move the chair seat forward and aft. In each embodiment, the adjustment mechanism provides for infinite adjustment along the adjusting rod or within the available range of adjustment. Although this invention has been disclosed in the context of certain preferred embodiments and examples, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that the present invention extends beyond the specifically disclosed embodiments to other alternative embodiments and/or uses of the invention and obvious modifications and equivalents thereof. In addition, while several variations of the invention have been shown and described in detail, other modifications, which are within the scope of this invention, will be readily apparent to those of skill in the art based upon this disclosure. It is also contemplated that various combinations or sub-combinations of the specific features and aspects of the embodiments can be made and still fall within the scope of the invention.
