[Example 2]
Synthesis of compound 1-0002
Step 1
The compound 1 (40.0 g, 223 mmol) was dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (80 mL). A 1 mol/L aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide (447 mL, 447 mmol) was added to the solution. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 4 hours. The reaction mixture was washed by ethyl ether. A 2 mol/L hydrochloric acid solution (230 mL, 460 mmol) was added to the aqueous layer. The mixture was stirred. The precipitates were filtered, washed by water, and dried to give the compound 5 (30.8 g, yield 86%).
