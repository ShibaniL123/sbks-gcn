Step B: Methyl 3-bromo-1-(4-methylphenyl)-1H-indazole-5-carboxylate
Methyl 1-(4-methylphenyl)-1H-indazole-5-carboxylate (327.1 mg, 1.228 mmol) was dissolved in acetonitrile (12.300 mL) at 25 °C. Bromine (158 µL, 3.0575 mmol) was added dropwise and the reaction mixture was allowed to stir for 30 min. The reaction was stopped, quenched by addition of saturated aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate (20 mL), and extracted with ethyl acetate (3 x 20 mL). The combined organic phases were washed with saturated aqueous sodium chloride (1 x 20 mL), dried (sodium sulfate), filtered, and the solvent evaporated under reduced pressure. The crude product was purified by flash chromatography (RediSep SiO2, 40 g column) on a CombiFlash Rf purification system eluting with ethyl acetate-hexanes (0-45%). The title compound (407.3 mg, 1.180 mmol, 96 % yield) was recovered as a light yellow/white solid.
