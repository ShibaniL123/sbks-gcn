DETAILED DESCRIPTION Hereinafter, exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. The same reference numerals provided in the drawings indicate the same members. FIG. 1 is an exploded perspective view illustrating a configuration of a tube-type cosmetic container having double discharge means according to an exemplary embodiment. FIG. 2 is an assembled perspective view illustrating a configuration of a tube-type cosmetic container having double discharge means according to an exemplary embodiment. FIG. 3 is an assembled cross-sectional view illustrating a configuration of a tube-type cosmetic container having double discharge means according to an exemplary embodiment. Referring to FIGS. 1 to 3, a tube-type cosmetic container having double discharge means according to an exemplary embodiment may include a container body 100, a nozzle member 200, a rotation body 300, and a lifting member 400. The tube body 100 may contain contents such as cosmetics, wherein a discharging part 110 is formed on the upper part of the container body 100 to make it possible to discharge contained contents. The tube body 100 is preferred to be made of tube material so as to enable contents to be discharged by pressurizing the tube body by a user. The nozzle member 200, comprising a body 210 and a nozzle 220, is combined to the upper part of the tube body 100 and discharges the contents to the outside. The body 210 is combined on the upper part of the tube body 100, encircling the discharging part 110, wherein a combining part 211 is provided on the inner part of the body 210, so as to make the body's 210 combining with discharging part 110 possible. It is preferred that the combining part 211 is fixed to the discharging part 110, and thus prevents the rotation of the nozzle member 200. The nozzle 220 is connected and extended upwards on the center of the body 210 and discharges to the outside the contents held in the tube body 100, wherein the nozzle 220 is connected with the discharging part 110 for contents to be discharged. A pair of guide protrusions 221 are formed on both side surfaces of the nozzle 220 so as to ascend and descend lifting member 400 when a rotation body 300, which will be described later, rotates, wherein a pair of the guide protrusions 221 are inserted into spiral grooves 411 and guide to ascend or descend the lifting member 400 according to the rotation of the lifting member 400. Meanwhile, on the lower part of the nozzle 220 is provided a separation preventing protrusion 222 that prevents the separation of the rotation body 300, wherein it is preferable that the upper end of the separation preventing protrusion 222 forms a gentle slope so that the upper end of the separation preventing protrusion 222 may not interfere with a fixing plate 310 but easily be provided when the rotation body is engaged. The rotation body 300 is provided to the upper part of the nozzle member 200 to be able to be rotated, wherein the fixing plate 310 is equipped from the upper part of the separation preventing protrusion 222 to the downward direction with combined fit. The fixing plate 310 is engaged with combined fit with the separation preventing protrusion 222 and supports the lower end of the separation preventing protrusion 222, thus preventing the rotation body 300 from being separated upwards and thereby the rotation body 300 from being separated from the nozzle member 200. Meanwhile, the rotation body 300 has an oval shape and is made to rotate a lifting member 400 by a user which will be described later. The lifting member 400 is composed to ascend and descend by the rotation of the rotation body 300, either hiding or exposing the nozzle 220, which has an oval shape that corresponds to the shape of the rotation body 300 in order to be rotated together when the rotation body 300 is rotating. On the center of the lifting member is equipped a lift guiding part 410 which is cylinder-shaped and encircles the nozzle 220, wherein a spiral groove 411 is formed along the inner circumferential surface on the lift guiding part 410 so that the guide protrusion 221 may be inserted, and thus the lifting member 400 ascends or descends according to the rotation of one side or another. It is preferable that the spiral groove 411 is formed in two rows of spirals so that a pair of parallel guide protrusions 221 may be inserted. Meanwhile, on the lifting member 400 is formed a discharging member 420 to allow contents to be absorbed and discharged to the outside through the nozzle 220, wherein the discharging member 420 comprises a puff or a brush that can absorb and apply contents. An outlet hole is formed on the center of the upper end of the discharging member 420 to allow the nozzle 220 to enter. When the lifting member 400 ascends by one side rotation of the rotation body 300, the lifting member 400 makes the nozzle 220 not exposed by the discharging member 420, and the contents discharged from the nozzle 220 can be absorbed through the discharging member 420 for being used, whereas when the rotation body 300 descends by the other side rotation, the contents can be used by exposing the nozzle 220 to the outside. Therefore, depending on the area that a user intends to apply make-up, a wide area can be applied with the discharging member 420 while a localized area can be applied with a nozzle 220. Hereinafter, an operational state of a tube-type cosmetic container having double discharge means according to an exemplary embodiment will be described with reference to FIGS. 4 and 5. FIGS. 4 and 5 are views illustrating an operational state of a tube-type cosmetic container having double discharge means according to an exemplary embodiment. Referring to FIGS. 4 and 5, in a tube-type cosmetic container having double discharge means according to an exemplary embodiment, when the lifting member 400 ascends at first, the nozzle 220 is in the position of not being exposed to the outside by the discharging part 420; at this moment, if the tube body 100 is pressurized, the contents discharged through the nozzle 220 is absorbed into the discharging member 420, and applying contents through the discharging member 420 can be possible. Next, while the lifting member 400 is ascending, if the rotation body 300 is rotated into one side direction, the lifting member 400 can be rotated with the rotation body 300, when the guide protrusion 221 moves along the spiral groove 411 formed on the lifting member 400, and thus applying contents through the nozzle 220 can be possible. As shown above, when the lifting member 400 descends, the discharging member 420 coupled with the lifting member 400 descends together, exposing the nozzle 220 to the outside, and thereby applying contents through the nozzle 220 is possible. As described above, when the lifting member 400 descends, the discharging member 420 combined with the lifting member 400 also descends, and then the nozzle 220 is exposed to the outside, thus making usage of the optimal embodiments have been disclosed in the drawings and the specification. Although specific terms have been used herein, these are only intended to assist in understanding the present disclosure and are not intended to limit the meanings of the terms or to restrict the scope of the accompanying claims.
