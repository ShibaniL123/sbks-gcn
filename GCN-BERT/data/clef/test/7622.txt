CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION This application is a continuation application of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/855,924, filed Aug. 13, 2010, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates generally to video gaming machines and more particularly, to an apparatus and method for playing a video slot machine which splits a video slot game into two separate instances of the video slot game upon the occurrence of a triggering condition. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Gaming machines, such as slot machines, are a cornerstone of the gaming industry. Generally, the popularity of such machines with players is dependent on the perceived likelihood of winning money at the particular game and the intrinsic entertainment value of the game relative to other available gaming options. Where the available gaming options include a number of competing games and the expectation of winning each game is believed to be generally the same, players are most likely to be attracted to the most entertaining and exciting games. Thus, gaming operators strive to employ the most entertaining and exciting games available because such games attract frequent play and, hence, increase profitability to the operator. Furthermore, one concept that has been successfully employed to enhance the entertainment value of the game is the addition of a bonus game that may be played in conjunction with the “primary” game. The bonus game may comprise any type of game, either similar to or completely different from the primary game. The bonus game is initiated upon the occurrence of a selected event or outcome of the primary game. Because the excitement and entertainment value of the primary game provides increased player appeal relative to other gaming machines and the bonus game concept increases player appeal and excitement, thereby increasing the chance to win the potential pay-out amount, there is a continuing need to develop new features for primary and bonus games. New features are necessary to appeal to player interest and enhance excitement in order to entice longer play and satisfy demands of operators for interesting games and increased profitability. The present invention is directed to satisfying these needs. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In a first aspect of the present invention, a video gaming machine is provided.

The coordinate readout device 57 works as a second input device and comprises, for example, a so-called touch panel formed as a transparent panel on the display 14 and capable of issuing signals corresponding to the coordinates of a position touched on the display 14 by the player. The coordinate readout device 57 is closely put on the surface of the display 14 and integrated therewith. In the CPU 51, there are provided a payment processor 34 for counting value of money consumed in each game. A random number generator 32 is included for randomly generating numbers during play of the game, as described below. With reference to FIGS. 1 and 3, the game controller 51 sends a signal to a display processor 16 for displaying a plurality of game elements 18 on the display 14. The display includes a cash-out touchpad 41 such that when the cash-out touchpad 41 is touched any accumulated credits are paid to the player in a coin bin 7. A winner paid meter 43 keeps track of credits paid out to a player. A credit meter 45 is displayed for informing the player of the number of winning credits won on a given spin. The touchpad could also be buttons affixed to the machine. The display 14 further includes a help touchpad 47 for accessing information about the game. A credit meter 49 displays to the player a number of credits available to the player for game play or cash-out. A select lines touchpad 60 allows the player to toggle through and select the available sets of paylines. Preferably, the video slot gaming machine 10 is a multi-line game, i.e., the paylines include horizontal paylines and/or diagonal pay-lines, and/or zig-zag paylines. A bet per line touchpad 61 allows the player to toggle to increase the bet per line a credit at a time (up to the maximum bet). Returning to FIG. 2, the payment processor 34 is connected to the game controller 12 for awarding a regular payout in response to the game elements 18 displayed on the display 14 matching a winning combination along one of the paylines selected by the player. With reference to FIG. 3, in one aspect of the present invention, the game controller 12, the display device or display 14 is adapted to display the plurality of game elements 18 in a grid 20 having a plurality of cells defined by rows and columns. During play of the video slot game, the game controller 12 randomly selects the game elements 18 to be displayed in the display device 14. The selected game elements 18 are selected from a set of possible game elements. In the illustrated embodiment, the set of possible game elements includes “9”, “10”, “J”, “Q”, K″, and “A”, and a wild symbol, designated “Wild”. It should be noted that any type of symbols or game elements may be used. The game controller 12 is adapted to determine an outcome of the regular game based on the displayed game elements 18, the pay-table, a wager, and predetermined paylines. It should be noted that the above described gaming machine 12 is for exemplary purposes only. The present invention is not limited to any particular gaming machine. The gaming machine 12 may also include other features. For example, the gaming machine 12 may include a player tracking device (not shown) which is connected to a player tracking system. The gaming machine 12 may also utilize a cashless wagering system (not shown), such as a ticket in ticket out (TITO) system (not shown). With particular reference to FIGS. 3-8, the game controller 12 displays a first instance 112A of the video slot game 110 on the display 14. The video slot game 110 is played using a plurality of cells arranged in a grid 20 having a plurality of rows and columns. The first instance 112A of the video slot game 110 is generally played in a conventional manner. The player makes a wager, typically based on a predetermined denomination and a selected number of paylines. The reels are spun and game symbols or elements are randomly chosen for each cell. If a predetermined pattern of elements are randomly chosen for each cell on a played payline, the player is awarded a payout based on the payline, the wager, and a predetermined paytable. Many variations to the above described general play of a video slot game fall within the scope of the present invention. Such a video slot game 110 is well-known in the art, and is therefore not further discussed. After the first instance 112A of the video slot game 110 is played, and any payout award to the player is paid, the game controller 12 detects any triggering condition within the outcome of the first instance 112A, i.e., the symbols or elements within the cells. In one aspect of the present invention, the triggering condition is the appearance of a predetermined game element or symbol in a predetermined cell or cells. With respect to the particular embodiment illustrated in FIG. 3, the triggering condition is a predetermined symbol, represented by “A”, within every cell of the first column. However, it should be noted that the predetermined game element could be any one of the elements in the set of game elements, including “Wild”. It should also be noted that the predetermined cell(s) do not need to be the first column. The predetermined cells could include one or more of the other cells scattered throughout the grid or one of the other columns. Furthermore, the predetermined cells may be randomly determined. With particular reference to FIG. 4, once a trigger condition has been detected, the video game controller 12 splits the video slot game into two separate instances: a second instance 112B of the video slot game 110 and a third instance 112C of the video slot game 110. With particular reference to FIG. 5, in the instant embodiment, a first representation of the predetermined cells 116 with the predetermined symbol, e.g., “A”, contained therein is displayed. First and second representations of the other cells 118, 120 are also displayed. Thus, the second instance 112B of the video slot game 110 includes the representation of the predetermined cells 116 and the first representation of the other cells 118 and the third instance 112C of the video slot game 110 includes the representation of the predetermined cells 116 and the second representation of the other cells 120. As stated above, the predetermined symbol, e.g., “A”, is held in the predetermined cells during play of the second and third instances 112B, 112C. The second and third instances 112B, 112C of the video slot game are then played, i.e., the game controller 12 randomly selects new game elements for the remaining cells in both instances 112B, 112C (see FIG. 5). The outcome of the second instance 112B of the video slot game 110 is, thus, the combination of the representation of the predetermined cells 116 and the first representation of the other cells 118, and the outcome of the third instance 112C of the video slot game 110 is the combination of the representation of the predetermined cells 116 and the second representation of the other cells 118. A second award may be played to the player as a function of the outcome of the second instance 112B of the video slot game 110 and a second predetermined paytable. A third award may be played to the player as a function of the outcome of the third instance 112C of the video slot game 110 and a third predetermined paytable. In one embodiment, a single wager allows the player to play through all instances, e.g., the first, second and third instances of the video slot game. In another embodiment, a separate wager is required for each instance. In one embodiment, the awards or payouts (if any) are made at the end of each respective instance. In another embodiment, the awards or payouts are grouped together in a single payout after all instances have been played. With particular reference to FIGS. 6-8, a second embodiment of the present invention is illustrated. Operation of this second embodiment is similar to the first embodiment, however, second and third instances 112B, 112C each include all of the cells of the grid 20. It should be noted that the first, second, and third awards may include an award for multiple winning paylines. The awards may also be a function of the wager made by the player. In one aspect of the present invention, the first, second and third paytables are the same. In another aspect of the present invention, the second and third paytables are the same, but different from the first paytable. In still another aspect of the present invention, all three paytables are different. In another aspect of the present invention, a method of providing a video slot game 110 to a player is provided. The video slot game 110 includes a plurality of cells arranged in a grid having a plurality of rows and columns. In a first step, a first instance of the video slot game 110 displayed on a video display device 14. In a second step, the first instance of the video slot game 110 is played and an award is paid to the player as a function of an outcome of the first instance of the video slot game 110 and a predetermined paytable. In a third step, a triggering condition in the outcome of the first instance of the video slot game 110 is detected. In one aspect of the present invention, the triggering condition includes a predetermined symbol located within at least one triggering cell of the video slot game 110 (see above). In response to detecting the triggering condition, second and third instances 112B, 112C of the video slot game are simultaneously displayed on the video display device. The second and third instances 112B, 112C of the video slot game 110 are played. An award is paid to the player as a function of an outcome of the second instance of the video slot game and a second predetermined paytable. An award is paid to the player as a function of an outcome of the third instance of the video slot game and a third predetermined paytable. The predetermined symbol is copied into the at least one triggering cell of the second and third instances of the video slot game and is held throughout the play thereof.
