Step 5. Preparation of 8-Chloro-3-(1-hydroxyethyl)-2-phenylquinolin-4(1H)-one
8-Chloro-4-oxo-2-phenyl-1,4-dihydroquinoline-3-carbaldehyde (8.5g, 0.03mol) and 50ml of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran were added to a 100ml two-necked flask, stirred to be dissolved, cooled to -35°C and protected with argon. A solution of methylmagnesium chloride in tetrahydrofuran (concentration of 3M) (3ml, 0.09mol) was added via syringe. After adding, the temperature was raised to 0°C and the mixture was stirred for 2h. TLC tracking was performed until the completion of the reaction. The reaction was stopped; 5ml ethanol was added to quench the reaction; the solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure; 200ml of water and 100ml of ethyl acetate were added. After stratification, aqueous layer was extracted with ethyl acetate, and the organic layers were combined, washed with saturated salt water, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and concentrated under reduced pressure to give 8.2g of a light yellow solid with a yield of 91.2%.
