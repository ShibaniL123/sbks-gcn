COMPOSITION FOR DYEING KERATIN FIBRES, COMPRISING AN OXIDATION BASE AND A PARTICULAR HETEROARYL COUPLER The invention relates to a composition comprising i) at least one oxidation base, preferably of heterocyclic and/or para-phenylenediamine type, ii) at least one particular heteroaryl coupler, preferably aminothiazole; to a process for dyeing keratin fibres using ingredients i) and ii); to a kit comprising ingredients i) and ii) and to the use of ingredient i) combined with ii) for dyeing keratin fibres. Many people have sought for a long time to modify the colour of their hair and in particular to mask their grey hair. It is known practice to dye keratin fibres, in particular human keratin fibres such as the hair, to obtain "permanent" colourings with dye compositions containing oxidation dye precursors, which are generally known as oxidation bases, such as ortho- or para- phenylenediamines, ortho- or para-aminophenols, or heterocyclic compounds such as pyrazoles, pyrazolinones or pyrazolo-pyridines. These oxidation bases are colourless or weakly coloured compounds, which, when combined with oxidizing products, may give rise to coloured compounds via a process of oxidative condensation. It is also known that the shades obtained with these oxidation bases may be varied by combining them with couplers or colouring modifiers, the latter being chosen especially from aromatic meta-diamines, meta-aminophenols, meta-diphenols and certain heterocyclic compounds such as indole or pyridine compounds. The variety of molecules used as oxidation bases and couplers allows a wide range of colours to be obtained. The oxidation dyeing process thus consists in applying to keratin fibres a dye composition comprising oxidation bases or a mixture of oxidation bases and couplers with hydrogen peroxide as oxidizing agent, in leaving it to diffuse, and then in rinsing the fibres. However, the use of these dye compositions may have a certain number of drawbacks. Specifically, after application to keratin fibres, the dyeing power obtained may not be entirely satisfactory, or may even be weak, and lead to a restricted range of colours. The colourings may also not be sufficiently persistent with respect to external agents such as light, shampoo or perspiration, and may also be too selective, i.e. the difference in colouring is too great along the same keratin fibre that is differently sensitized between its end and its root. Thiazole compounds have been used in the synthesis of (azo)methine dyes that are heat-transferable onto synthetic materials (see, for example, US 5 892 046) or laser frequency-doubling dyes (see, for example, WO 02080160). Certain thiophene derivatives are known to give the hair body (WO 2003/063 809). 2-Aminofuran derivatives have also been used for oxidation dyeing (EP 1 498 109). The latter derivatives do not always give satisfactory colourings on keratin fibres, especially in terms of the colour build-up on the fibre or in terms of selectivity. One of the objects of the present invention is especially to propose compositions for dyeing keratin fibres, in particular human keratin fibres such as the hair, which are especially capable of leading to a wide range of colours with powerful, sparingly selective colourings that are resistant to external agents (such as shampoo, light, perspiration or bad weather). This aim is achieved by the present invention, one subject of which is especially a composition for dyeing keratin fibres, in particular human keratin fibres such as the hair, comprising: i) at least one oxidation base; ii) at least one heteroaryl coupler of formula (I): and also addition salts thereof with an organic or mineral acid or base, optical geometrical isomers thereof, tautomers thereof or solvates thereof such hydrates, in which compound of formula (I): A represents oxygen or sulfur atoms, preferably sulfur; X represents a nitrogen atom or a group C-R4; R1 and R2, which may be identical or different, represent i) a linear or branched (Ci-C4) alkyl group, optionally interrupted with one or more heteroatoms, and optionally hydrogenated or (Ci-C4)alkylated, and/or optionally substituted, ii) optionally substituted aryl; iii) optionally substituted heteroaryl; iv) optionally substituted (hetero)cycloalkyl; or alternatively R1 and R2 form, together with the nitrogen atom that bears them, an optionally substituted heterocycloalkyl, the ring also possibly comprising one or more heteroatoms chosen from oxygen, sulfur and nitrogen, said heterocycle preferentially being 5- or 6-membered such as morpholino, piperazino or piperidino; • R3 and R4, which may be identical or different, represent i) a linear or branched (C1-C4) alkyl group, optionally interrupted with one or more heteroatoms, and optionally hydrogenated or (CrC4)alkylated, and/or optionally substituted with one or more groups; ii) optionally substituted aryl; iii) optionally substituted heteroaryl or iv) optionally substituted (hetero)cycloalkyl. A subject of the invention is also a dyeing process using this composition. Another subject of the invention is the use of the compounds of formula (I) for the oxidation dyeing of keratin fibres, in particular human keratin fibres such as the hair. The composition of the invention leads to particularly powerful, chromatic and sparingly selective colourings. Furthermore, the colour build-up on keratin fibres treated with the composition of the invention is very satisfactory. The composition also makes it possible to obtain dye compositions leading to colourings that are very resistant to the various attacking factors to which the hair may be subjected, such as light, bad weather, washing and perspiration. The oxidation dye compositions in accordance with the invention also make it possible to achieve shades in a very broad range of colours. For the purposes of the present invention, the term "build-up" of the colour of the keratin fibres means the variation in colouring between locks of non-dyed grey hair and locks of dyed hair.

"Metal catalysts" are compounds that comprise one or more metals in their structure. The metals are chosen from transition metals and rare-earth metals, and alloys thereof. In particular, the metals are chosen from transition metals and rare-earth metals. Among the transition metals, mention may be made especially of manganese, iron, cobalt, copper, zinc, platinum, nickel, titanium, silver, zirconium, chromium, molybdenum, tungsten, platinum, gold and vanadium, and among these most particularly manganese. Among the rare-earth metals, mention may particularly be made of cerium. Thus, the metal catalysts are especially catalysts based on transition metals or on rare-earth metals, and more particularly manganese-based, vanadium-based or cerium-based catalysts. The metal catalysts used may be in the form of metal salts, metal oxides or metal complexes, and mixtures thereof. For the purposes of the present invention, the term "metal complexes" means systems in which the metal ion, i.e. the central atom, is bonded to one or more electron donors, called ligands, via chemical bonds. Examples that may be mentioned include porphyrins and phthalocyanines, which are especially cationic. Preferably, the metal catalysts used in the dyeing process are chosen from metal salts. For the purposes of the present invention, the term "metal salts" means salts derived from the action of an acid on a metal. Preferentially, the metal catalysts used in the dyeing process are chosen from transition metal salts, such as manganese salts, and rare-earth metal salts, such as cerium salts, and also mixtures thereof. The metal salts may be mineral or organic salts.

Preferably, the alkaline agent(s) present in the composition of the invention are chosen from aqueous ammonia, alkanolamines, amino acids in neutral or ionic form, in particular basic amino acids, and preferably corresponding to those of formula (III). Even more preferentially, the alkaline agent(s) are chosen from aqueous ammonia and alkanolamines, most particularly monoethanolamine (MEA). Better still, the alkaline agent(s) are chosen from alkanolamines, most particularly monoethanolamine (MEA). vi) The chemical oxidizing agents: According to a particular embodiment of the invention, the dye composition comprises at least one chemical oxidizing agent. The term "chemical oxidizing agent" means an oxidizing agent other than atmospheric oxygen. The composition of the invention preferentially contains one or more chemical oxidizing agents. The oxidizing agents conventionally used for the oxidation dyeing of keratin fibres are, for example, hydrogen peroxide, urea peroxide, alkali metal bromates, persalts such as perborates and persulfates, and peracids. Hydrogen peroxide is particularly preferred. More particularly, the chemical oxidizing agent(s) are chosen from hydrogen peroxide, urea peroxide, alkali metal bromates, peroxygenated salts, for instance persulfates or perborates, peracids and precursors thereof and alkali metal or alkaline- earth metal percarbonates. The chemical oxidizing agent is advantageously hydrogen peroxide. The concentration of chemical oxidizing agents may range more particularly from 0.1 % to 50% by weight, even more preferentially from 0.5% to 20% by weight and better still from 1 % to 15% by weight relative to the weight of the composition. The dyeing process: Another subject of the invention concerns a process for dyeing keratin fibres, in particular human keratin fibres such as the hair, which consists in applying to said fibres the dye composition of the invention comprising ingredients i), ii) and optionally iii) to vi) as defined previously. The process of the present invention is a process in which the dye composition according to the present invention as defined previously is applied to the fibres, in the presence of at least one chemical oxidizing agent vi) as defined previously, for a time that is sufficient to develop the desired colouring. The colour may be revealed at acidic, neutral or alkaline pH, and the chemical oxidizing agent(s) may be added to the dye composition of the invention just at the time of use, or they may be used starting with an oxidizing composition containing them, which is applied simultaneously with or sequentially to the composition of the invention. The oxidizing composition may further comprise various adjuvants which are used conventionally in compositions for dyeing hair, and are as defined above. The oxidizing composition of the process of the invention particularly comprises at least one fatty substance. More particularly, the oxidizing composition has a fatty substance content preferably ranging from 10% to 90% by weight, even more particularly ranging from 20% to 80% by weight and better still from 20% to 50% by weight relative to the oxidizing composition. According to a particular embodiment of the invention, the composition which comprises the ingredients i), ii) and optionally iii) to vi) as described previously is obtained by mixing at least two compositions, preferably two or three compositions. According to a particular variant of the invention, the process uses the composition which is derived from mixing two compositions: a dye composition (A) comprising: - at least i) one oxidation base as defined previously; - at least ii) one heteroaryl coupler of formula (I) or (Γ) as defined previously; - optionally at least one alkaline agent v) as defined previously; and a composition (B) comprising: - at least one chemical oxidizing agent vi) as defined previously; - at least one of the compositions (A) and (B) comprising: o at least iii) one fatty substance as defined previously; and o optionally at least iv) one metal catalyst as defined previously; it being understood that the content of fatty substance of the composition according to the invention resulting from the mixing of compositions (A)+(B) comprises at least 10%, in particular at least 15%, more particularly at least 20% and preferably at least 25% by weight relative to the total weight of the composition. According to one variant, the preceding process uses a composition which is derived from the mixing of three compositions, the three compositions being aqueous or at least one of them being anhydrous. In a particular process of the invention, two aqueous compositions (Β') and (C) and one anhydrous composition (Α') are used, - the anhydrous composition (Α') comprising at least iii) one fatty substance as defined previously, - composition (Β') comprising: o at least i) one oxidation base as defined previously; o at least ii) one heteroaryl coupler of formula (I) or (Γ) as defined previously; and - composition (C) comprising: at least vi) one chemical oxidizing agent as defined previously; it being understood that: - optionally at least v) one alkaline agent as defined previously; which is included in compositions (Α') and/or (Β') and preferably solely in composition (B'); - optionally at least iv) one metal catalyst as defined previously being present in at least one of the three compositions (Α'), (Β') or (C); - these three compositions being such that the content of fatty substance of the composition resulting from the mixing of the three compositions (A')+(B')+(C) comprises at least 10%, in particular at least 15%, more particularly at least 20% and preferably at least 25% by weight relative to the total weight of the composition derived from the mixing of (A')+(B')+(C). In one variant of the invention, the keratin fibres are pretreated with a metal salt iv) as defined previously, preferably Mn or Ce salts, such as Mn or Ce gluconates. The mixture obtained according to the preceding processes is then applied to the keratin fibres. After a leave-in time of approximately 3 to 50 minutes, preferably approximately 5 to 30 minutes, the keratin fibres are rinsed, washed with shampoo, rinsed again and then dried. The ready-to-use composition that is finally applied to the keratin fibres may be in various forms, such as in the form of liquids, creams or gels or in any other form that is suitable for dyeing keratin fibres, and especially human hair. Kit: A subject of the invention is also a multi-compartment dyeing device or "kit" comprising a first compartment containing composition (A) as defined previously in the dyeing process, and at least a second compartment containing composition (B) as defined previously in the process, the compositions of the compartments being intended to be mixed before application, the composition after mixing of (A)+(B) is such that the amount of fatty substance preferably represents at least 10%, in particular at least 15%, more particularly at least 20% and preferably at least 25% by weight relative to the total weight of the composition resulting from the mixing of (A)+(B). According to one variant, the multi-compartment device of the invention is such that a first compartment contains a dye composition comprising ingredients i) and ii) and optionally iii) to v) as defined previously and a second compartment contains at least vi) one chemical oxidizing agent as defined previously. These devices or kits may be equipped with a means for dispensing the desired mixture on the hair, such as the devices described in patent FR-2 586 913 in the name of the Applicant. Using these devices, it is possible to dye the keratin fibres by means of a process that involves mixing a dye composition comprising at least i) one oxidation base and at least ii) one coupler of formula (I) as defined previously and with at least vi) one chemical oxidizing agent, and applying the mixture obtained to the keratin fibres for a time that is sufficient to develop the desired colouring. The compounds of formulae (I) and (Γ) are known to those skilled in the art and are commercial products or may be obtained according to the synthetic methods known in the field of heterocycle synthesis: see, for example, US 5 892 046 and WO 02/080 160, or WO 2003/063 809. The examples which follow serve to illustrate the invention without, however, exhibiting a limiting nature.
