TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a polymeric compound in which a camptothecin compound and an anti-cancer (anti-tumor) effect enhancer are bound to a single molecule. The polymeric compound as disclosed herein can be used for delivering various plural drugs to an affected site. BACKGROUND ART Camptothecin is a vegitable alkaloid contained in plants such as Camptotheca acuminata of Chinese origin and a type I topoisomerase inhibitor. This selectively binds to the type I topoisomerase which forms a complex with DNA to stabilize its structure. As a result, it prevents the recombination of the cleaved DNA, and leads to the stop of the synthesis of DNA, thereby inducing the death of cells. Camptothecin exhibits a high anti-tumor effect, and an anticancer agent of it had been developed in the 1960s. However, it was shown to have a strong toxicity causing bone-marrow suppression and hemorrhagic cystitis, and therefore its clinical test had been discontinued. After that, topotecan and irinotecan had been developed as derivatives of camptothecin which have a better solubility in water, a stronger anti-tumor activity and a lower toxicity than those of camptothecin. Topotecan exhibits its anti-tumor effect without metabolism, and 20-40% of its dose is excreted renally. Therefore, diarrhea which is its side effect is mild. Irinotecan per se has an anti-tumor effect. It is metabolized in vivo by carboxyesterase to form a more active metabolite, 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin (hereinafter, referred to as EHC), said metabolite exhibits a stronger anti-tumor effect. Moreover, the ratio of irinotecan and EHC in the form of lactone, which is biologically active, in plasma is higher than that of topotecan, and irinotecan and EHC has a long half-life. The camptothecin derivatives are used for the treatment of many types of cancers in clinical use. Topotecan has been approved for the treatment of small cell lung cancer and the treatment of ovarian cancer pretreated with cancer chemotherapeutic agent(s). Irinotecan has been approved for the treatment of wide cancers, i.e., small cell lung cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, stomach cancer (inoperable or recurrent), colon Â·rectal cancer (inoperable or recurrent), breast cancer (inoperable or recurrent), squamous cell cancer, and lymphatic malignancy (non-Hodgkin's lymphoma). As one of camptothecin derivatives, Patent Literature 1 discloses a camptothecin derivative conjugated to a polymer. This polymer conjugate is obtained by ester binding a phenolic camptothecin compound to a copolymer of polyethylene glycol and a polymer having a side chain of carboxy group. The polymer conjugate has an in vivo sustained-release property and an excellent therapeutic effect on the basis of the binding of camptothecin compound via phenylester linkage which can be easily chemically cleaved. Further, the polymer conjugate forms a micelle and has an efficacy selective to tumors. It is expected to have a less side effect. Moreover, the polymer conjugate can release camptothecin compound without depending on enzyme(s). This suggests that the therapeutic effect of the polymer conjugate is not likely to be affected by the individual differences among patients. Poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP) is the enzyme catalyzing polyADP-ribosyl action that adding ADP ribose residue to proteins by using oxidative NAD (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) as a substrate to polymerize them. PARP senses the cleavage of single-stranded DNA, and then repairs DNA. A PARP inhibitor competitively inhibits oxidative NAD when PARP recognizes oxidative NAD and repairs DNA, thereby exihibiting a pharmacological effect. That is, the PARP inhibitor inhibits PARP to cleave single-stranded DNA in tumor cells and to further cleave double-stranded DNA that is important for survival of the cells, leading to the death of the tumor cells. In particular, in BRCA (Breast Cancer Susceptibility Gene)-mutant breast cancer, which is representative of hereditary breast cancer, inhibiting PARP which acts in the complement pathway of repair pathway of DNA leads to anti-tumor effect. In normal cells, even if PARP is inhibited, the cleavage of double-stranded DNA is repaired via the mechanism of repairing DNA by BRCA, resulting in no death of the cells. In contrast, in the tumor cells having BRCA mutation, the mechanism of reparing DNA does not act by the inhibition of PARP, and non-repaired single-stranded DNA accumulates in the cells, resulting in the cleavage of double-stranded DNA and the death of the tumor cells. PARP plays an important role of the recognition of damage of DNA and the repairing it. Therefore, it is assumed that its inhibitor becomes an enhancer of the effect of anticancer agent having the effect of damaging DNA. With expectation of possiblity of enhancing the effect by combining the PARP inhibitor with an anticancer agent such as temozolomide, carboplatin or gemcitabine, the treatment of cancers using PARP inhibitor has been currently developed. The treatment of BRCA1- or BRCA2-mutant tumor by the combination of a PARP inhibitor, olaparib, with other anticancer agents (e.g. carboplatin and gemcitabine etc.) shows better results. A rucaparib derivative, AG014699, which is a PARP inhibitor, is combined with temozolomide in the treatment of cancers, resulting in good tolerability and good anti-cancer effect. Furthermore, the results of phase II clinical trial of combination of a PARP inhibitor, veliparib (ABT-888) with temozolomide shows that the combination exhibits the effect on metastatic breast cancer, and has good tolerability, suggesting that the combination may be a promissing treatment method. Patent Literature 1 discloses a polymeric compound to which a single drug having phenolic hydroxyl group is bound. Patent Literature 2 discloses a polymeric compound to which a single drug having an alcoholic hydroxy group is bound. Patent Literature 3 and Non-Patent Literature 1 disclose the administration of the combination of a PARP inhibitor with a low-molecular anticancer agent such as temozolomide, carboplatin or gemcitabine, and a polymeric compound to which doxorubicin and other anticancer agents etc. are bound. However, a polymeric compound in which camptothecin compound and an anti-cancer effect enhancer, for example, a PARP inhibitor are bound to a single molecule is not known.

EHC, and an anti-cancer effect enhancer or an aspartic acid derivative to which an anti-cancer effect enhancer are bound to the above block copolymer having a polyethylene glycol structural moiety and a polyglutamic acid structural moiety. The method of binding includes, but not limited to, the following: EHC may be first bonded, and then the anti-cancer effect enhancer or the aspartic acid derivative to which the anti-cancer effect enhancer is bound may be bonded, or they may be bonded in the reverse order of this, or they may be simultaneously bonded. An example of method for producing an aspartic acid derivative to which an anti-cancer effect enhancer is bound will be described below. Preferably, the block copolymer having a polyethylene glycol structural moiety and a polyglutamic acid structural moiety, EHC, and an anti-cancer effect enhancer or an aspartic acid derivative to which an anti-cancer effect enhancer is bound may be reacted via dehydration condensation in the presence of a carbodiimide dehydration-condensation agent. According to this method, the group N (R6) CONH(R7) can be also introduced into the block copolymer simultaneously. Examples of the carbodiimide dehydration-condensation agent include dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), diisopropylcarbodiimide (DIPCI), 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride (WSC) and the like. In the dehydration condensation reaction, a reaction aid such as N,N-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) or the like may be used. When an aspartic acid derivative to which an anti-cancer effect enhancer is bound is bonded, the group N(R12)CONH(R13) may be optionally introduced to R11. The polymeric compound of the invention can be produced via an optional purification process after the above reaction. The polymeric compound of the invention gradually dissociates and releases antitumor active ingredients, i.e. EHC and an anti-cancer effect enhancer in phosphate buffered physiological saline (PBS) solution. This indicates that the compound has a property of sustained release of the EHC and the anti-cancer effect enhancer in the administration of said compound. Moreover, the ratio of the EHC and the anti-cancer effect enhancer to be bound can be changed appropriately. The dose of them can be also changed appropriately. It is known that the pharmacokinetics and the body distribution of a high molecular compound are significantly different from those of a low molecular compound. In light of this, the polymeric compound of the invention exhibits the different efficacy and the different side effect from those of a low molecular compound drug. Accordingly, a new treatment method using a camptothecin derivative and an anti-cancer effect enhancer can be provided. The polymeric compound of the invention can be used as an anticancer agent. Said use is also included in the invention. Said anticancer agent may be used in a conventionally used formulation such as injections, drops, tablets, capsules and powders. For formulation process, pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or additives which are conventionally used, can be used. Examples of said carriers or additives include binding agents, lubricating agents, disintegrating agents, solvents, vehicles, solubilizing agents, dispersing agents, stabilizing agents, suspending agents, preservatives, soothing agents, colorants, flavors and the like. Said anticancer agent is preferably used as injections or drops. In particular, water, physiological saline, 5% glucose or mannitol solution, water-soluble organic solvent (for example, glycerol, ethanol, dimethylsulfoxide, N-methylpyrolidone, polyethylene glycol, cremophor and the like, and mixtures thereof), and mixtures of water and the water-soluble organic solvents are preferably used. The dosage of the polymeric compound may vary as a matter of course, depending on the sex, age, body constitution, physiological condition, pathological condition and the like of a patient. For example, the polymeric compound is parenterally administered at a dose as an acitive ingredient, EHC, of 0. 01-500 mg/m2, preferably 1-200 mg/m2 body surface area of patient per day for an adult. The polymeric compound of the invention can enhance the therapeutic effect of camptothecin derivative. Said polymeric compound can be applied to a breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer, thyroid cancer, myeloid leukemia, hepatoblastoma, colon cancer, gallbladder cancer or the like. In particular, said polymeric compound can be expected to have a high therapeutic effect in the chemotherapy of various cancers pre-treated by a camptothecin derivative.
