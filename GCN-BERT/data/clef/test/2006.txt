Step 2-2, preparation of 3,6-dibromo-cinnolin-4-ol: To a suspension of 6-bromo-cinnolin-4-ol (3.947 g, 17.54 mmol) and sodium acetate (2.589 g, 31.57 mmol) in AcOH (25 mL) at 100° C. was added a solution of bromine (1.4 mL, 27.16 mmol) in AcOH (18 mL). The mixture was heated at 100° C. for 1 hr. The mixture was cooled to RT and diluted with water (150 mL). The solid was collected by vacuum filtration and washed with water to afford the title compound (5.141 g, 96.5% yield) as a brown solid. MS (M+H)−=304.9.
