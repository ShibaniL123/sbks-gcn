DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS Malignant cells, manifesting chromosomal instability in the form of aneuploidy, frequently show supernumerary centrosomes and multipolar mitotic spindles suggesting that abnormalities in organelles controlling segregation of chromosomes at mitosis play a role in the development of aneuploidy.1-3 Aurora kinase A, also known as STK15 or BTAK, is a member of the serine threonine kinase family that includes Drosophilia aurora and Saccharomyces cervisiae IPL1 kinase.4-6 These kinases have been identified as critical regulators of normal chromosome segregation and centrosome functions including regulation of centrosome separation and maturation in human cells.7 Moreover, overexpression of the aurora kinase A gene, located on chromosome 20q13, has been shown to be associated with aneuploidy and chromosomal instability promoting tumorigenic transformation and progression in mammalian cells and in several human tumors including urotheliel carcinoma.4,8 Interestingly, primary human urothelial cells induced to undergo transformation in vitro manifest amplification of chromosome 20q13.2 suggesting that overexpression of gene(s) on this chromosome may play a significant role in the development of bladder cancer.9 These observations together with the facts that the aurora kinase A encoding gene on chromosome 20q13 has also been identified as a tumor susceptibility locus in mice and humans10 and aurora kinase A induces functional inactivation of p53 tumor suppressor gene5 imply that increased expression of aurora kinase A may be a critical genetic determinant of chromosomal instability and transformation in human urothelial cells. In one embodiment, the present invention relates to a method of detecting bladder cancer in a patient, comprising isolating bladder cells from the patient's urine; hybridizing the bladder cells with a labelled DNA probe, wherein the probe recognizes at least a portion of the aurora kinase A gene, to yield a sample of bladder cells hybridized with the labelled DNA probe; and counting the number of bladder cells in the sample, the number of copies of the aurora kinase A gene in each bladder cell in the sample, and the number of bladder cells in the sample having at least a first threshold number of copies of the aurora kinase A gene. Isolating bladder cells (most commonly, urothelial cells) from the patient's urine can be performed by any technique known in the art. In one embodiment, isolating bladder cells can be performed by collecting voided urine specimens (approximately 100-200 ml) from the patient, centrifuging at a rotational velocity and for a duration sufficient to pellet bladder cells from the urine, discarding the supernatant, and resuspending the pelleted bladder cells in an appropriate solution for storage or use. In one embodiment, the duration and rotational velocity of centrifugation are about 15 minutes at about 1000 rpm. In one embodiment, the pelleted bladder cells are resuspended in 2 ml of DMEM (Dulbecco/Vogt Modified Eagle's Minimal Essential Medium) with 10% of DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide) and stored in −70° C. until the time comes to thaw the resuspended bladder cells prior to their use in later steps of the method. After thawing and prior to hybridization, the bladder cells can be washed one or more times, such as three times, in PBS (phosphate-buffered saline) or another buffer suitable for washing bladder cells, followed by centrifugation to pellet the washed bladder cells. The pelleted washed bladder cells can be fixed in methanol/acetic acid (3:1), pretreated in 2×SSC/0.5% NP-40, pH 7 at 37° C. for 30 minutes, followed by dehydration in ethanol at 90° C. for 5 minutes. As will be apparent to the person of ordinary skill in the art, other processing techniques suitable for preparing bladder cells for hybridization with a labelled DNA probe can be performed as a matter of routine experimentation. Hybridizing the bladder cells with a labelled DNA probe can be performed by any technique known in the art. The labelled DNA probe can comprise any DNA sequence and any detectable moiety, provided the probe recognizes at least a portion of the aurora kinase A gene. In one embodiment, the detectable moiety comprises a fluorophore. In one embodiment, the detectable moiety comprises a radioisotope. A cDNA sequence of aurora kinase A from H. sapiens is shown as SEQ ID NO:1 (GenBank accession no. BC001280) and a genomic sequence of aurora kinase A from H. sapiens is shown as SEQ ID NO:2. Though otherwise identical, the two sequences differ at position 301 and the cDNA contains a 16mer adenosine tail which the genomic sequence lacks. By “the probe recognizes at least a portion of the aurora kinase A gene” is meant that the probe comprises a DNA molecule having a sequence that is essentially fully complementary (i.e., at least about 90% complementary, such as at least about 95% complementary, at least about 96% complementary, at least about 97% complementary, at least about 98% complementary, at least about 99% complementary, at least about 99.5% complementary, or at least about 99.9% complementary) to the sequence of at least one DNA strand of the portion of the aurora kinase A gene, and further, that the DNA molecule of the probe is both long enough and has a sequence such that it will essentially only hybridize to the aurora kinase A gene and will essentially not hybridize to any other gene or non-expressed genomic element of the bladder cell. It is further desirable that the DNA molecule of the probe is not so long as to require a long time to hybridize to the aurora kinase A gene. In one embodiment, the labelled DNA probe comprises AURKA 20q13 (MP Biomedicals/Qbiogene, Illkirch, France). AURKA 20q13 specific DNA probe is optimized to detect copy numbers of the Aurora kinase A gene on chromosome 20 at region 20q13 on metaphase/interphase spreads, blood smears and paraffin embedded tissue sections. Any fluorophore which can be bound to the DNA molecule of the probe can be used. In one embodiment, the fluorophore is selected from the group consisting of rhodamine and fluorescein. In one embodiment, the AURKA 20q13 probe is directly labeled with Rhodamine (red) and the chromosome 20 α-satellite probe is directly labeled with Fluorescein (green). This dual color aurora kinase A FISH probe can be used to detect the copy number of the aurora kinase A gene in exfoliated cells of voided urine sediments. In one embodiment, the hybridization technique can involve incubation of dehydrated bladder cells with 10 μl of AURKA 20q 13 probe at 37° C. for about 16 hr (e.g., overnight). To remove unhybridized probe, the cells can be washed, such as in 0.5×SSC/0.1% SDS for five minutes at 65° C. Cells can be counterstained with DAPI (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) and mounted in an antifade solution prior to counting. In a further embodiment, a second labelled DNA probe that is not specific for the aurora kinase A gene can be hybridized to the bladder cells to allow counting of other DNA regions that may be of interest to the person of ordinary skill in the art. The hybridizing step yields a sample of bladder cells hybridized with the labelled DNA probe. Counting the number of bladder cells in the sample, the number of copies of the aurora kinase A gene in each bladder cell in the sample, and the number of bladder cells in the sample having at least a first threshold number of copies of the aurora kinase A gene can be performed by any appropriate technique known to the person of ordinary skill in the art of flow cytometry, fluorescence microscopy, or radioisotopic detection. The use of flow cytometers or fluorescence-activated cell sorters is well known in the art. When the detectable moiety is a fluorophore, fluorescence signals can be counted and captured with any appropriate microscope, such as a Zeiss Axioplan 2 (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging GmbH, Jena, Germany). Counting yields the number of bladder cells in the sample, the number of copies of the aurora kinase A gene in each bladder cell in the sample, and the number of bladder cells in the sample having at least a first threshold number of copies of the aurora kinase A gene. The first threshold number of copies can be chosen to be equal to the minimum number of copies of the aurora kinase A gene commonly found in bladder cancer cells. In one embodiment, the first threshold number of copies of the aurora kinase A gene is three. In a further embodiment, counting further comprises counting the number of bladder cells having at least a second threshold number of copies of the aurora kinase A gene, wherein the second threshold number of copies is greater than the first threshold number of copies. The second threshold number of copies can be chosen to be equal to the minimum number of copies of the aurora kinase A gene commonly found in cells of aggressive bladder cancer. In one embodiment, the second threshold number of copies of the aurora kinase A gene is five. By counting the number of bladder cells in the sample and the number of bladder cells in the sample having at least a first threshold number of copies of the aurora kinase A gene, the latter number can be divided by the number of bladder cells to calculate a percentage of the bladder cells that have at least a first threshold number of copies of the aurora kinase A gene. In one embodiment, the method further comprises, if greater than or equal to a first threshold percentage of the bladder cells have at least the first threshold number of copies of the aurora kinase A gene, the step of presuming the patient to have bladder cancer. Any value of the percentage of the bladder cells that have at least a first threshold number of copies of the aurora kinase A gene can be used as the first threshold percentage. In one embodiment, the first threshold percentage is 15%. In a further embodiment, the method further comprises, if greater than or equal to a second threshold percentage of the bladder cells have at least the first threshold number of copies of the aurora kinase A gene, wherein the second threshold percentage is greater than the first threshold percentage, the step of presuming the patient to have aggressive bladder cancer. “Aggressive” bladder cancer refers to bladder cancer characterized by one or more of presenting an invasive tumor, a nonpapillary tumor, or a tumor having histologic grade 3. In one embodiment, the first threshold percentage is 15% and the second threshold percentage is 20%. By performing the method, factors useful in presuming whether the patient has bladder cancer and, if so, how aggressive, can be quantified by a physician by a technique that is noninvasive. By quantifying the factors, the physician can decide whether other diagnostic or therapeutic methods, such as cystoscopy, surgical ablation, BCG instillation into the bladder, instillation of other chemotherapeutic molecules into the bladder, radiation treatment, or cystectomy should be performed or considered for performance. By performing the method on a recurring basis for a patient currently being treated for bladder cancer, such as by chemotherapy or radiation, the efficacy of the treatment can be monitored. By performing the method on a recurring basis for a patient previously treated for bladder cancer, the extent of recurrence, if any, can be monitored. We have discovered the method has both high specificity (in the example below, with n=81, the specificity was 1.0, meaning the false positive rate was 0%) and high sensitivity (in the example below, the sensitivity was 0.86, meaning the false negative rate was 14%). To our knowledge, no other workers have reported a method of noninvasive bladder cancer screening, tested on a sample size of at least 80 individuals, having both a specificity above 0.85 and a sensitivity above 0.85, let alone a specificity of 1.0 and a sensitivity of at least 0.86. The following examples are included to demonstrate preferred embodiments of the invention. It should be appreciated by those of skill in the art that the techniques disclosed in the examples which follow represent techniques discovered by the inventor to function well in the practice of the invention, and thus can be considered to constitute preferred modes for its practice. However, those of skill in the art should, in light of the present disclosure, appreciate that many changes can be made in the specific embodiments which are disclosed and still obtain a like or similar result without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Example 1 Summary Background: Chromosomal missegregation resulting in aneuploidy is a common somatic genetic change in neoplasia, and genes regulating segregation of chromosomes may be potential cancer detection markers. Amplification/overexpression of aurora kinase A, a key regulator of mitosis, has been frequently detected in human cancer including bladder cancer and the degree of amplification correlates with the degree of aneuploidy. Methods: We measured the level of aurora kinase A expression in bladder cancer cells and correlated it with the copy number of three selected chromosomes as well as total nuclear DNA content. The effect of aurora kinase A on centrosome multiplication and chromosome copy number was measured in vitro using an adenoviral expression construct. To assess the applicability of this gene as a biomarker for bladder cancer, we also tested the aurora kinase A gene copy number using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) on exfoliated cells from voided urine of bladder cancer patients. Findings: Overexpression of aurora kinase A in human urothelial cells induced amplification of centrosomes, chromosome missegregation, and aneuploidy. Moreover, overexpression of the aurora kinase A gene occurred in early phases of tumor development and could be detected in in situ lesions as well as in voided urine of patients with bladder cancer. A FISH test for aurora kinase A gene copy number performed on a blinded validation test consisting of 51 voided urine samples from patients with bladder cancer and 30 unaffected healthy controls detected bladder cancer with specificity 1.0 and sensitivity 0.86. Interpretation: Our findings indicate that overexpressed aurora kinase A can cause aneuploidy in urothelial cells and is a promising biomarker for detection of bladder cancer. Introduction Human bladder cancer is an ideal system to study the mechanisms of chromosomal instability as it develops from in situ preneoplastic conditions via papillary and non-papillary pathways, which show strong correlation between aggressiveness and the degree of aneuploidy.11 Most low-grade, superficial papillary tumors that originate from urothelial hyperplasia are near diploid. Although they often recur, they are unlikely to invade the bladder wall and metastasize. By contrast, virtually all high-grade, nonpapillary tumors that develop by progression from severe dysplasialcarcinoma in situ show pronounced aneuploidy and have a high propensity to invade the bladder wall and metastasize. In the present study, we evaluated the role of aurora kinase A in the development of bladder cancer from in situ urothelial neoplasia. We investigated the levels of aurora kinase A amplification and overexpression in human bladder tumor samples and bladder cancer cell lines and correlated them with the degree of aneuploidy. The functional implications of aurora kinase A overexpression were validated by in vitro transfection studies. Finally, we identified aurora kinase A as a potential biomarker for non-invasive detection of bladder cancer in urine. Materials and Methods Tumor samples and cell lines. Cell suspensions from paired samples of transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of the bladder and adjacent urothelium were obtained from 21 human cystectomy specimens as previously described.12 Briefly, the mucosal surface adjacent to tumor was scraped and the cells were transferred into a conical tube containing phosphate buffered solution (PBS). The tumor was dissected from a frozen block to minimize contamination with non-tumor cells and similarly transferred to a conical tube containing PBS. Tumor cells were released into a PBS solution by mechanically agitating the tissue fragments. Only those samples that yielded greater than 90% of microscopically recognizable tumor cells or intact urothelium were utilized for this study. Voided urine specimens (approximately 100-200 ml) from 74 patients with cystoscopically evident bladder cancer were collected prior to transurethral resection of tumors and centrifuged for 15 minutes at 1000 RPI. The urine sediments were re-suspended in 2 ml of DMEM with 10% of DMSO and stored in −70° C. The intraurothelial precancerous changes were classified as mild, moderate, and severe dysplasia or carcinoma in situ. The tumors were classified according to the three-tier World Health Organization histological grading system and growth pattern (papillary versus non-papillary). The depth of invasion was recorded according to the TNM (tumor-node-metastasis) staging system. Voided urine specimens from 37 unaffected healthy individuals without evidence of bladder cancer served as controls. The human bladder cancer cell lines UM-UC-1, UM-UC-2, UM-UC3, UM-UC-6, UM-UC-9, UM-UC-10, UM-UC-12, UM-UC-13, UM-UC-15, UM-UC-16, and UM-UC-17, and normal human urothelial cells were established by us and the SV40 immortalized human urothelial cell line, SVHUC, was obtained from Dr. C. A. Reznikoff and cultured as previously described.13 Expression assays for aurora kinase A. Quantitative RT-PCR was used to analyze the expression levels of aurora kinase A in paired samples of adjacent urothelial/bladder tumors and cell lines as previously described.12 Briefly, for RT-PCR, cDNA was synthesized from 2 μg of total RNA using the TaqMan RT reagents following the manufacturer's protocol (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif.). The primers and fluorescent probes for each gene were designed according to the Assays-by-Design Service provided by Applied Biosystems. RT-PCR analysis was performed on a PerkinElmer/Applied Biosystems 7700 Prism apparatus, using housekeeping gene 18S as an internal normalization standard. Urothelium suspensions prepared from ureters from nephrectomy specimens free of urothelial neoplasia were used as standards from which we calculated the relative expressions of aurora kinase A from adjacent urothelium and bladder tumors. NU204 human urothelial cells were grown in vitro as previously described14 and were used as a reference to calculate relative expression levels of aurora kinase A in bladder cancer cell lines grown in vitro. Aurora kinase A gene copy number analysis. A dual color aurora kinase A FISH probe (AURKA 20g13/a-satellite 20 DNA probe) purchased from MP Biomedicals/Qbiogene (Illkirch, France), was used to detect the copy number of the aurora kinase A gene in exfoliated cells of voided urine sediments. The AURKA 20813 probe was directly labeled with Rhodamine (red) and the chromosome 20 α-satellite probe was directly labeled with Fluorescein (green). The hybridization conditions were as per manufacturer's recommendations.15 In brief, the voided urine sediments were defrosted and washed three times in PBS followed by centrifugation. The cystospin preparations were fixed in methanol/acetic acid (3:1) and were pretreated in 2×SSC/0.5% NF-40, pH7 at 37° C. for 30 minutes followed by dehydration in increasing gradients of ethanol. After denaturing at 90° C. for 5 minutes the cells were hybridized overnight with 10 μl of AURKA 20q13 probe at 37° C. After they were washed for 5 minutes in 0.5×SSC/0.1% SDS for five minutes at 65° C. cells were counterstained with DAPI and mounted in an antifade solution. Fluorescence signals were counted and captured with Zeiss Axioplan 2 microscope. DNA ploidy analysis. The ploidy of interphase nuclei was analyzed with centromeric FISH probes for chromosomes 3, 7, and 17 (Vysis Abbott; Park, Ill.) and by measurements of total nuclear DNA by image analysis with the SAMBA 4000 system (Ampersand Medical; Chicago, Ill.) as previously described.6 Normal human urothelial cells from resected nephrectomy specimens were used both to test the performance of FISH probes in normal human diploid tissue and to serve as a negative control. DNA ploidy measurements were performed on cytospin preparations of paired samples of adjacent urothelium/bladder tumors and bladder cancer cell lines stained with the Feulgen reaction. The DNA index was calculated as the ratio of the mean nuclear DNA content of the tumor cells to the mean nuclear DNA content of a diploid standard (human peripheral blood lymphocytes). Tumors with DNA indices ranging from 0.9-1.2 were classified as diploid/near-diploid whereas tumors in which a DNA index of greater than 1.2 was in more than 20% of cells with a distinct peak on the histogram were classified as aneuploid. In vitro transfection assays. In vitro transfection studies were carried out using pcDNA3-wild type aurora kinase A and simian virus 40 (SV40) immortalized human urothelial cells as previously described.4 Briefly, cells transfected with adenoviral GFP vector without aurora kinase A served as controls. Only those experiments that showed greater than or equal to 80% transfection rates were accepted for analysis. The degree of aurora kinase A-GFP ectopic expression was verified by western blot analysis using antiGFP antibodies and by RT-PCR using primers targeting the aurora kinase A-GFP fusion sequence. The cells were subsequently harvested on days 1-4 after transfection and used for: analysis of centrosome copy number, simultaneous flow cytometric measurements of total DNA content and aurora kinase A expression levels, chromosomal copy number with centromeric FISH probes for chromosomes 3, 7, and 17, and soft agar colony formation assay. For centrosome copy number, methanol fixed cells were exposed to anti-y-tubulin mouse antibody (1:2000 dilution, Sigma Chemical Corp., St. Louis, Mo.) for 1 hour as previously described.4 Briefly, the bound primary antibody was detected with Texas Red-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (1:500 dilution, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, Calif.) using DAPI as counterstain. Simultaneous flow cytometric analysis of DNA content (red fluorescence of propidium iodide; PI) and expression levels of aurora kinase A (green fluorescence of GFP) was carried out using a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (EPICS XL-MCL, Beckman Coulter, Inc, Miami, Fla.) The population of cells with abmoiinal DNA content was computed as the number of GFP positive cells with a DNA index <2c and >4c. For soft agar colony formation assays, SV40 immortalized urothelial cells were infected with an adenovirus vector containing wild type aurora kinase A tagged with GFP or a control adenovirus containing GFP only. One day after viral infection, the cells were plated at a concentration of 10,000 cells/plate on soft agar containing UM-UC-3 conditioned medium. The number of colonies per plate was recorded two weeks after plating. Statistical Analysis. For quantitative analysis of FISH both green and red signals were counted in at least 20 cells from each urine sample and the number of green and red signals for each cell was recorded. The cells containing abnormal aurora A signal were divided into two sub-groups, consisting of cells with low (3-4 copies) and high (>4 copies) levels of aurora kinase A gene amplification. For each sample we calculated an aurora kinase A score by dividing the number of cells with elevated levels (3 or more copies) by the total number of cells examined. An aurora kinase A score >0.15 was considered to be elevated and corresponded to >3 cells out of a set of 20 with at least 3 red FISH signals. This score was used to produce ROC curves for a training set of seven controls and 23 bladder cancer urine samples (n=30). The performance of the aurora kinase A FISH test was further validated on a testing set of 30 controls and 51 bladder cancer urine samples (n=81). The area under the curve (AUC) was used to assess the performance of the marker. The AUC is equivalent to a Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney rank sum test comparing the case and control groups,16 and the latter test was used to derive p-values. Chi-squared tests were used on the data from cancer samples to assess the association between aurora kinase A score and pathologic features of the tumors such as histologic grade, growth pattern, and stage. In cases where the contingency table counts were small, p-values were assessed by simulation with marginal counts fixed (p<−0.05 was considered significant). Results We first investigated the expression levels of aurora kinase A in samples of TCC of the bladder and its adjacent in situ preneoplastic urothelium. The levels of aurora kinase A mRNA revealed by quantitative RT-PCR were elevated in both adjacent urothelium and TCC (FIG. 1A). The expression levels of aurora kinase A correlated with tumor grade, stage, and aneuploidy (FIG. 1B-D). Low-grade, superficial TCCs that showed minimal deviation from normal diploid of their total nuclear DNA content and were classified as near diploid showed mild elevation of aurora kinase A expression (approximately 2-fold) as compared to normal urothelium. In contrast, high-grade, invasive TCCs with pronounced aneuploidy showed marked elevation of aurora kinase A expression (approximately 7-fold). To determine whether the degree of chromosomal instability was related to the degree of overexpression of aurora kinase A, we analyzed aurora kinase A expression levels and chromosome copy number in bladder cancer cell lines (FIG. 2A,B). Using expression levels of aurora kinase A, we divided bladder cancer cell lines into three groups (FIG. 2C). The first group consisted of 6 cell lines with no elevation of aurora kinase A expression. The second group consisted of 4 cell lines with mild aurora kinase A elevation (2- to 5-fold). The remaining 3 cell lines showed markedly elevated levels of aurora kinase A. (6- to 14-fold). The analysis of chromosomal copy numbers using centromeric FISH probes for selected chromosomes (3, 7, 17) showed dramatically increased numbers of chromosomes in cell lines with markedly elevated levels of aurora kinase A (FIG. 2D). These correlative studies suggested that gain of function of aurora kinase A through amplification and overexpression gives rise to aneuploid cellular phenotypes during bladder cancer development. We verified this hypothesis by in vitro transfection studies using SV40-immortalized urothelial cells and adenoviral constructs containing wild-type aurora kinase A-GFP inserts. The transfected urothelial cells showed a marked elevation of ectopically expressed aurora kinase A that was associated with amplification of centrosomes and development of aneuploidy as well as transformed cellular phenotype revealed by the presence of increased number of centrosome signals, chromosomal copy number, total DNA content, and acquisition of colony forming ability on soft agar (FIG. 3A-D). To determine whether aurora kinase A can be used as a marker for bladder cancer detection, we analyzed voided urine sediments of patients with bladder cancer for amplification of aurora kinase A using the FISH technique (FIG. 4A). The analysis was performed in a blinded fashion; i.e., the observer scoring the FISH results did not know whether the sample was obtained from a patient with bladder cancer or an unaffected control. The initial testing was performed on training set of voided urine sediments from 23 patients with bladder cancer and seven healthy controls. It revealed at least low-levels of gene amplification (3-4 copies) in all 23 patients with bladder cancer. The voided urine sediments from patients with low-grade TCC contained primarily cells that had 3-4 copies of aurora kinase A while a substantial proportion of cells (>20%) from patients with high-grade TCC had >4 copies of aurora kinase A (FIG. 4B). Two cells with three copies of aurora kinase A signal were detected in one control. No abnormal copy numbers of aurora kinase A were detected in urine sediments of the remaining six controls. The analysis of data from the training set using >15% of cells with at least 3 copies of aurora kinase A as the cut-off for the positivity of the test yielded a specificity of 1.0, a sensitivity of 0.91, and an ROC AUC of 0.997 (p=1×10−4). We validated the performance of the aurora kinase A FISH test for bladder cancer on an additional blinded testing set consisting of voided urine samples from 51 bladder cancer patients and 30 healthy controls. The data were analyzed using the same cut-off point for the positivity of the test i.e. >15% of cells wish at least 3 copies of aurora kinase A. The test was positive in 44 samples of patients with bladder cancer. No abnormal aurora kinase A gene copy numbers were identified in seven patients with bladder cancer. In five out of 30 control samples, 1-3 cells with three copies of the aurora kinase A gene were identified. The analysis of the testing set yielded a specificity of 1.0, a sensitivity of 0.84, and an ROC AUC of 0.925 (p=6.79×10−11). The results of quantitative FISH analysis of cells in voided urine for all 74 patients with bladder cancer and 37 healthy controls are summarized in FIG. 5. The degree of aurora kinase A amplification as measured by the aurora score strongly correlated with the histologic grade of the tumors. Bladder cancers of high histologic grade (grade 3) had significantly higher aurora kinase A scores (0.60±0.29) than low grade (grade 1-2) tumors (0.13±0.15). There was no significant correlation between the score and the tumor growth pattern (papillary vs. nonpapillary), or the stage (superficial vs. invasive) (data not shown). Discussion The current findings in light of those published earlier provide strong evidence in favor of aurora kinase A amplification/overexpression being an early event in bladder carcinogenesis that is associated with the development of centrosome amplification and aneuploid genomic content. These observations awwume important biological significance in view of our earlier reported findings that aurora kinase A facilitates degradation of tumor suppressor protein p53 and that human bladder tumor samples with elevated expression of aurora kinase A reveal extremely low cellular p53 content, mimicking loss of a critical tumor suppressor pathway.17 It is relevant in this context to mention that loss or inactivating mutation of certain tumor suppressor proteins, most notably p53, causes centrosome amplification18 and that concomitant occurrence of p53 mutation and cyclin E over-expression is strongly associated with chromosome instability and centrosome amplification in bladder cancer.19 The recent discovery of an interaction and feedback regulation between aurora kinase A and the focal adhesion scaffolding protein HEF1 indicates that elevated expression of aurora kinase A may coordinately derange the integrin dependent signaling processes controlling cell attachment, migration, and cell survival along with induction of chromosomal instability manifested as aneuploidy.20 These observations not only provide strong evidence for a critical role of aurora kinase A in malignant transformation of urothelial cells, but also suggests that it may be a novel biomarker for bladder cancer. Collectively, our data indicates that aurora kinase A when overexpressed in urothelial cells causes centrosome amplification and missegregation of chromosomes, resulting in aneuploidy and transformed phenotypes. Current FISH studies on voided urine samples of patients with bladder cancer together with the previously published data indicate that overexpression and amplification of aurora kinase A is frequent in bladder cancer and can be detected in exfoliated urothelial cells from voided urine sediment. The dual-color FISH probe for aurora kinase A gene and α-satellite centromeric chromosome 20 DNA detected bladder cancer with high specificity and sensitivity. Moreover, the degree of aurora kinase A amplification correlated with high grade clinically aggressive bladder cancer. This implies that testing for this aurora kinase copy number by FISH technique in urine is a promising noninvasive test for bladder cancer. Further, to the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to move beyond correlative studies suggesting that gain of function of aurora kinase A through amplification and overexpression gives rise to aneuploid cellular phenotypes during bladder cancer development to show that overexpression of aurora kinase A in urothelial cells causes centrosome amplification and missegregation of chromosomes, resulting in aneuploidy and transformed phenotypes.
