ARTICLE WITH HARDCOAT AND METHOD OF MAKING THE SAME Cross Reference To Related Application This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Number 61/991 124, filed May 9, 2014, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. Background [0001 ] Dyed and vacuum-coated plastic films have been applied to windows to reduce heat load due to sunlight. To reduce heat load, solar transmission is blocked in either the visible or the infrared portions of the solar spectrum (i.e., at wavelengths ranging from 400 nm to 2500 nm or greater). [0002] Primarily through absorption, dyed films can control the transmission of visible light and consequently provide glare reduction. However, dyed films generally do not block near-infrared solar energy and consequently are not completely effective as solar control films. Dyed films also often fade with solar exposure. In addition, when films are colored with multiple dyes, the dyes often fade at different rates, causing an unwanted color changes over the life of the film. [0003] Other known window films include those fabricated using vacuum-deposited grey metals (e.g., stainless steel, inconel, monel, chrome, and nichrome alloys). The deposited grey metal films offer about the same degrees of transmission in the visible and infrared portions of the solar spectrum. As a result, the grey metal films are an improvement over dyed films with regard to solar control. The grey metal films are relatively stable when exposed to light, oxygen, or moisture, and in those cases in which the transmission of the coatings increases due to oxidation, color changes are generally not detectable. After application to clear glass, grey metals block light transmission by approximately equal amounts of solar reflection and absorption. [0004] Vacuum-deposited layers such as silver, aluminum, and copper control solar radiation primarily by reflection and are useful only in a limited number of applications due to the high level of visible reflectance. A modest degree of selectivity (i.e., higher visible transmission than infrared transmission) is afforded by certain reflective materials, such as copper and silver, when bound on either side by a dielectric layers such as indium tin oxide. [0005] Low emissivity coatings have been used to reduce the radiative heat transfer in building windows. Typically, a semi-transparent metal appropriately bound on either side by dielectric layers is used to obtain high visible light transmission, high near infrared reflection and low emissivity. Since these layers are prone to degradation by atmospheric elements, they need to be protected by relatively thick polymeric films. [0006] A variety of hardcoat materials are available to protect substrates, including plastic substrates that have a tendency to scratch in normal use. Examples of hardcoat materials include those made of binder (e.g., acrylates) and S1O2 nanoparticles modified by photocurable silane coupling agent. In addition to scratch resistance, flexibility is also a desirable feature of hardcoat materials for some applications, although typically increasing flexibility tends to decrease the scratch resistance of a hardcoat material. Application of polymeric or other infrared absorbing coatings over the low emissivity layers increases the emissivity of the surface negating the utility of these coatings as transparent insulating films in window applications. [0007] There is a continuing need for high visible light transmission (i.e., > 70%) and low emissivity (i.e., less than 0.2) window films that are scratch resistant. There is also typically a desire that the window films are resistant to atmospheric elements.

Comparative Examples 1 to 2 (CE-1 to CE-2) and Example 3 (EX-3) [0053] CE-1 sample was a low emissive film (obtained from Nitto Denko Corp., Osaka, Japan under trade designation "PX7000A"). CE-2 sample was prepared by removing the top layer of the low emissive film ("PX7000A") (CE-1) sample using a 3M Scotch Tape to expose the metallic layer. [0054] EX-3 sample was prepared by applying the CE-2 sample film on a soda lime glass plate of 50 mm x 150 mm x3 mm. Then hardcoat precursor solution HC-1 was coated on the substrate by Meyer Rod # 4. After drying for 5 minutes at 60°C in air, the coated substrate was passed 2 times through a UV irradiator (Model DRS, H-bulb, obtained from Fusion UV System Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) under nitrogen gas. During irradiation, 900 mJ/cm2, 700 mW/cm2 of ultraviolet (UV-A) was totally irradiated on the coated surface. The thickness of the resulting hard-coat layer was 100-120nm. Comparative Example 4 (CE-4) and Examples 5 to 6 (EX-5 to EX-6) [0055] CE-4 low emissivity substrate was obtained by following the general teachings of U.S. Pat. Pub. No. US2010/0316852 Al, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. A roll of 0.075 mm thick, 508 mm wide PET film (MELINEXEM 454 from DuPont Teijin Films, Chester, VA) was loaded into a roll to roll apparatus similar to one described in PCT Pub. No. WO2009085741 , published October 1, 2009, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. The pressure in the chamber was reduced to 3x10"4 torr (0.04 Pa) and the drum 308 was chilled to -18°C. The PET film was exposed to plasma pretreatment using a titanium target magnetron run at 200 W DC in a nitrogen plasma. The plasma treated side of the PET film was then coated with degassed, flash- evaporated acrylate monomer mixture (94% SARTOMER SR833 acrylate and 6% CN147 acidic acrylate oligomer at a web speed of 7.2 ft/min. (2.2 m/min.). The monomer mixture was degassed by exposing it to a pressure of about 1x10" J torr (0.13 Pa), and then flash-evaporated by pumping it through an ultrasonic atomizer into a vaporization chamber maintained at 274°C. The vaporized acrylate mixture was sprayed from the chamber onto the moving PET film where it condensed due to the lo drum temperature. The condensed acrylate monomer mixture was then crosslinked with electron beam radiation in vacuum with the electron beam gun operated at 7.5 kV and 4 niA. The final thickness of the crosslinked acrylate base coat was approximately 1500 nm. A silicon oxynitride layer was coated on this crosslinked acrylate layer from a rotary silicon-aluminum target by reactively sputtering in the presence of oxygen (15%) and nitrogen (85%) operating at 16kW. The thickness of the coating thus obtained was about 23 nm as measured by cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy. Pretreatment, acrylate coating and crosslinking and oxynitride deposition took place sequentially in a single pass. The web direction was reversed and aluminum doped zinc oxide (AZO) layer and Silver-Gold (AgAu) alloy layer were deposited by DC sputtering process to obtain less than 3 nm AZO and about 12 nm AgAu, respectively. The web direction was reversed and a second AZO layer was deposited. The AZO layer was less than 3 nm. [0056] EX-5 was prepared by coating the HC-2 precursor on the substrate prepared in CE-4 in a roll-to- roll die coating process operating at 10 ft/min. (3 m/min.). Solution flow rate used was 1.65 cmVmin. and the coating width was 4 inches (10.2 cm). The dried coating was UV cured using an H-bulb, (obtained from Fusion UV System Inc.) operating at 300 W/inch (1 18 W/cm) power. [0057] EX-6 was prepared as described in CE-4 except that a second acrylate layer (94 % SARTOMER SR833, 6 % CN147, and 1 % IRGACURE 184) was deposited on the substrate prepared as described in CE-4. The second acrylate layer was estimated to be 80 nm thick. The second acrylate layer was then cross-linked using e-beam gun operating at 7kV and 5 mA thus forming a hard coat. [0058] Samples prepared according to CE-1, CE-2 and EX-3 to EX-6 were tested using the test methods described above. Table 3, below, summarizes the test results. Table 3.
