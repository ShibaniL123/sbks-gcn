METHODS AND COMPOSITIONS FOR WOUND HEALING Field of the Invention The present, invention relates to epoxy-tigliane compounds and their use in promoting wound healing. In particular embodiments, the epoxy-tigliane compounds are epoxy-tigliaen-3-one compounds. Methods of inducing or promoting wound healing as well as methods of reducing scarring and improving cosmetic outcomes upon healing of a wound are described. Compounds and compositions for use in wound healing are also described. Background of the Invention Wound healing is an intricate process in which the skin or another organ or tissue, repairs itself after injury. In normal skin, the epidermis (outermost layer) and dermis (inner or deeper layer) exists in a steady-state equilibrium, forming a protective barrier against the external environment. Once the protective barrier is broken, the normal physiologic process of wound healing is immediately set in motion. The classic model of wound healing is divided into three sequential, yet overlapping phases, namely; inflammatory, proliferative and finally remodelling. During the inflammatory phase of wound healing there is active recruitment of neutrophils and then monocytes front surrounding vasculature into the wound. Neutrophils are essential to the initial control and destruction of bacterial and fungal infections in the wound. Monocytes mature into macrophages as they enter the wound where they have numerous roles during the course of wound resolution including the initial phagocytosis and clean-up of matrix and cell debris. The release of enzymes, cytokines and growth factors by both neutrophils and macrophages in the wound can then exert a profound influence on other cells within the wound and surrounding tissue. For example, macrophages secrete collagcnas.es which debride the wound; interleukins and tumor necrosis factor (TNF), which stimulate fibroblasts and promote angiogenesis; and transforming growth factor (TGF), which, stimulates keratinocyt.es. They also secrete plateletderived growth factor and vascular endothelial growth factor which initiate the formation of granulation tissue and thus initiate the transition into the proliferative and remodelling phases. A rapid and robust, but transient, inflammatory phase is often associated with good wound healing outcomes. The second stage of wound healing involves cell proliferation and migration and wound contraction.. This involves actions taken by cells within the wound to achieve closure of the wound gap and replenish lost tissue. Migration and proliferation of keratinoeytes is fundamental to achieve re-epithelialisation of the wound, while reconstitution of the underlying dermis results from migration, proliferation and differentiation of fibroblasts which help draw the wound closed and contribute to the synthesis, bundling and alignment of collagen fibres. In the final remodelling stage, migrating and proliferating keratinoeytes at the wound edge restratify to seal the wound and form a continuous epidermis. During this stage many changes also occur in. the dermis involving remodelling of the extracellular matrix to restore a normal dermal architecture and vasculature. In certain cases, wounds may be slow to heal or not heal at all. Many factors affect the healing of a wound, for example, the general health of the wounded subject, the age of the wounded subject, diseases such as diabetes, or other diseases that may affect circulation, the presence of infection, foreign objects or necrotic tissue, or in some instances, medication may affect the rate of wound healing. Furthermore, in some wounds imperfect regulation of wound resolution can result in fibrosis and excessive sear formation to leaving scar tissue that is functionally and cosmetically inferior to normal tissue. There is much research into improving wound healing and reducing scar tissue. However, there is a need to find agents that are capable of promoting wound healing, for example, increasing the rate of wound healing, particularly in. chronic wounds. There is also a need for agents that allow a wound to heal with reduced scarring than would occur naturally.

Where the compounds are depicted as having stereochemistry, the stereochemistry depicted is relative stereochemistry and is based on knowledge of biosynthesis pathways and chemical analysis. In some embodiments, the plant extract is from a plant of the genus Fontainea or Hylcmdia, especially the species is Fontainea punched, Fontainea australis, Fontainea borealis, Fontainea fitgax, Fontamea oraria, Fontainea picrospemia, Fontainea rostrata, Fontainea subpapuana, Fontainea venom or Hykmdia dockriUn, especially Fontainea picrospemia, Fontainea australis, Fontainea rostrata or Bylandm dockrillii. The parts of the plant may include fruit, seed, bark, stem, leaf, flower, roots, endosperm, exocarp and wood, especially where the extract is obtained from the seed. Extracts of the plants may he obtained by standard methods, for example, the biomass obtained from seeds, leaves, fruit, endosperm, exocarp, stem or bark of the plant is subject to initial solvent extraction, such as with a polar solvent for example, ethanol. The initial extraction is then concentrated and diluted with water and subject to extraction with a second solvent, for example, ethyl acetate. The solvent samples from the second extraction are pooled and subject to separation by preparative HPLC fractionation. The fractions are analysed by analytical HPLC and pooled according to the retention time of compounds found in the samples. The pooled fractions are weighed, bioassayed and analysed by analytical HPLC. Further fractionation using one or more preparative HPLC is performed to isolate specific compounds. Each compound is bioassayed and its structure identified by UV, NMR and mass speetrometric techniques. Other compounds of the invention may be obtained by derh arising compounds isolated from, plants or parts of plants, especially from the genus Fontainea, especially from the species Fontainea pkrospenna, especially the seeds of Fontainea pkmspermei. Derivatives of the natural compounds can be obtained by techniques known in the art. For example, hydroxy groups .may be oxidised to ketones, aldehydes or carboxylic acids by exposure to oxidising agents such as chromic acid, Jones’ reagent, ΚΜηΟ4, peraeids such as mCPBA (metachloroperben/.oie acid) or dioxiranes such as dimethyldioxirane (DMDO) and methyl(lrifiuoromethyI)dioxirane (TFDO). Oxidising agents may be chosen such that other functional groups in the molecule are or me not also oxidised. For example, a primary alcohol may be selectively oxidised to an aldehyde or carboxylic acid in the presence of secondary alcohols using reagents such as RuCbtPPhsrf-benKene. Secondary alcohols may be selectively oxidised to ketones in the presence of a primary alcohol using Crfpyridine or NaBrC%-cerieammonium nitrate. Alcohols may be oxidised in the presence of double and triple bonds and without epimerisation at adjacent stereocentres using Jones’ reagent with, or without Celite (or ammonium chloride). Alternatively, reagents chosen may be less selective resulting in oxidation at more than one functional group. Hydroxy groups may also be derivatised by etherification or acylation, For example, ethers, may be prepared by formation of an alkoxide ion in the presence of base and reacting the alkoxide with an appropriate alkylhalide, alkenylhalide. alkynyl.hal.ide or arylhalide. Similarly acylation may be achieved by formation of an alkoxide ion and reaction with an appropriate carboxylic acid or activated carboxylic acid (such as an anhydride or acylchloride). Acyl groups may be hydrolysed to provide alcohols by acid or base hydrolysis as known in the art and those alcohols can be derivatised further as above. Ketones may be reduced to secondary alcohols by reducing agents such as lithium aluminium hydride and other metal hydrides without reducing double bonds, including tx-un saturated ketones. Double bonds and triple bonds may be reduced to single bonds using catalytic reduction, for example, Fb/Pd. Double bonds may also be oxidised to epoxides using oxidising agents such as peraeids, for example mCPB.A or dioxiranes, such as DMDQ and TFDO. Double bonds may also be subject to addition reactions to introduce substituents such as halo groups, hydroxy or alkoxy groups. A person skilled in the art would be able to determine suitable conditions for obtaining derivatives of isolated compounds, for example, by reference to texts relating to synthetic methodology, examples of which are Smith Μ,Β, and March J., March's Advanced Organic Chemistry, Fifth Edition, John Wiley & Sons Inc., 2001 and Larock R.C., Comprehensive Organic Transformations, VCH Publishers Ltd., 1980. Furthermore, selective manipulations of functional groups may require protection of other functional groups. Suitable protecting groups to prevent unwanted side reactions are provided in Green and Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, John Wiley & Sons Inc., 3T<1 Edition, 1999.

In yet another aspect of the invention, any one of the compounds 5 to 53 or 60 or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof may be in: the form of a pharmaceutical composition together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent and/or excipient, Compositions While the epoxy-tigliane compounds or a pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, may be administered neat, it may be more convenient to administer the epoxy-tigliane compounds in the form of a pharmaceutical composition together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent and/or excipient. Dosage form and rates for pharmaceutical use and compositions are readily determinable by a person of skill in the art. Dosage forms include tablets, dispersions, suspensions, injections, solutions, syrups, troches, capsules, suppositories, aerosols, transdermal patches, impregnated (occlusive) dressing, creams, gels and the like, These dosage forms may also include injecting or implanting devices designed specifically for, or modified to, controlled release of the pharmaceutical composition. Controlled release of the therapeutic agent may be effected by coating the same, for example, with hydrophobic polymers including acrylic resins, waxes, higher aliphatic alcohols, polyactic and polyglyeolie acids and certain cellulose derivates such as hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose. In addition, the controlled release may be affected by using other polymer matrices, liposomes and/or mi erasphenes. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and acceptable carriers for systemic administration may also be incorporated into the compositions of this invention. Suitably, the pharmaceutical composition comprises a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient or an acceptable excipient. By “pharmaceutically acceptable excipient” is meant a solid or liquid filler, diluent or encapsulating substance that may be safely used. Depending upon the particular route of administration, a variety of carriers, well known, in the art may be used. These carriers or excipients may be selected from a group including sugars, starches, cellulose and its derivates, malt, gelatine or other gelling agents, talc, calcium sulphate, vegetable oils, synthetic oils. alcohols and/or polyols, alginic acid, phosphate buffered solutions, emulsifiers, isotonic saline, and pyrogen-free water. Any suitable route of administration may be employed for providing a human or non-human patient with the pharmaceutical composition of the invention. For example, oral, topical, rectal, parenteral, sublingual, buccal, intravenous, intraarticular, intra-muscular, intra-dermal, subcutaneous, mhalational, intraocular, intraperitoneaL intracerebroventricular. transdermal and the like may be employed. Pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention suitable for administration may be presented in discrete units such as syringes, vials, tubes, capsules, sachets or tablets each containing a predetermined amount of one or more pharmaceutically active compounds or extracts of the invention, as a powder or granules or as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous liquid, a cyclodextrin solution, a non-aqueous liquid, an oil-in-water emulsion or a water-in-oil emulsion or as a solution or suspension in a cream or gel or as a suspension of micro- or nano-particles incorporating a compound of the invention, including but not limited to silica or polylactide micro- or nano-particles,. Such compositions may he prepared by any of the method of pharmacy but all methods include the step of bringing into association one or more pharmaceutically active compounds of the invention with the carrier which constitutes one or more necessary ingredients. In general, the compositions are prepared by uniformly and intimately admixing the agents of the invention with liquid earners or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product in to the desired presentation. In powders, the carrier is a finely divided solid which is in a mixture with the finely divided active component. In tablets, the active component is mixed with the carrier having the necessary binding capacity in suitable proportions and compacted in the shape and size desired. Suitable carriers for powders and tablets include magnesium carbonate, magnesium stearate, tale, sugar, lactose, pectin., dextrin, starch, gelatin, tragaeanth, methylcdlulose, sodium carboxymethykellulose, a low melting wax, cocoa butter, and the like. The term "preparation" is intended to include the formulation of the active compound with encapsulating material as earner providing a capsule in which the active component, with or without carriers, is surrounded by a carrier, which is thus in association with it. Similarly, cachets and lozenges are included. Tablets, powders, capsules, pills, cachets, and lozenges can be used as solid forms suitable for oral administration. For preparing suppositories, a low melting wax, such as admixture of fatty acid glycerides or cocoa butter, is first melted and the active component is dispersed homogeneously therein, as by stirring. The molten homogenous mixture is then poured into convenient sized molds, allowed to cool, and thereby to solidify. Formulations suitable for vaginal administration may be presented as pessaries, tampons, creams, gels, pastes, foams or sprays containing in addition to the acti ve ingredient such carriers as are kno wn in the art to be appropriate. Liquid form preparations include solutions, suspensions, and emulsions, for example, water or water-propylene glycol solutions. For example, parenteral injection liquid preparations can be formulated as solutions in aqueous .1.,2-propanediol,, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), aqueous solutions of gamma cyclodextrin or 2-hydioxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin, saline solution or polyethylene glycol solution, with or without buffer. A preferred range of pH is 3.5-4.5. Suitable buffers buffer the preparation at pH 3.5-4.5 and include, but are not limited to, acetate buffer and citrate buffer. The compounds according to the present invention may thus be formulated for parenteral administration (e.g. by injection, for example bolus injection or continuous infusion) and may be presented in unit dose form in ampoules, pre-filled syringes, small volume infusion or in multidose containers with an added preservative. The compositions may take such forms as suspensions, solutions, or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and may contain fomiulatory agents such as suspending, stabilising and/or dispersing agents. Alternatively, the active ingredient may be in powder form, obtained by aseptic isolation of sterile solid or by lyophilisation from solution, for constitution with a suitable vehicle, e.g, sterile, pyrogen-free water, before use. Aqueous solutions suitable for oral use can be prepared by dissolving the active component in water and adding suitable colorants, flavours, stabilizing and thickening agents, as desired. Aqueous suspensions suitable for oral use can be made by dispersing the finely divided active component in water with viscous material, such as natural or synthetic gums, resins, melhylcellulpse, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, or other well known suspending agents. Also included are solid form preparations which are intended to be converted, shortly before use, to liquid form preparations for oral administration. Such liquid forms include solutions, suspensions, and emulsions. These preparations may contain, in addition to the active component, colorants, flavours, stabilizers, buffers, artificial and natural sweeteners, dispersants, thickeners*, solubilizing agents, and the Like. For topical administration to the epidermis or other organ, the compounds according to the invention may he formulated as gels, ointments, emulsions, pastes, creams or lotions, or as a. transdermal patch. Gels may be prepared using suitable thickening agents and adding them to aqueous/alcoholic compositions of compound. Suitable thickening or gelling agents are known in the art, such as the polyvinyl carboxy polymer, Carbomer 940, Ointments and creams may, for example, be formulated with an aqueous or oily base with the addition of suitable thickening and/or gelling agents. Lotions may be formulated with an aqueous or oily base and will in general also contain one or more emulsifying agents, stabilising agents, dispersing agents, suspending agents, thickening agents, or colouring agents. Formulations suitable for topical administration also include solutions or suspensions that may be administered topically in the form of a bath or soak solution or a spray. These formulations may be suitably applied to combat skin irritations* insect bites and foot wounds. Formulations suitable for topical administration in the mouth include lozenges comprising active agent in a flavoured base, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth; pastilles comprising die active ingredient in an inert base such as gelatin and glycerin or sucrose and acacia; and mouthwashes comprising the active ingredient in a suitable liquid carrier. Solutions or suspensions are applied directly to the nasal cavity by conventional means, for example with a dropper, pipette or spray. The formulations may be provided in single or multidose form. In the latter case of a dropper or pipette, this may be achieved by the patient administering an appropriate, predetermined volume of the solution or suspension. In the ease of a spray, this may be achieved for example by means of a metering atomising spray pump. To improve nasal delivery and retention the compounds according to the invention may be encapsulated with cyciodextrins, or formulated with their agents expected to enhance delivery and retention in the nasal mucosa. Administration to the respiratory tract may also be achieved by means of an aerosol formulation in -which the active ingredient is provided in a pressurised pack with a suitable propellant such as a chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) for example, diehlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, or dichlorotetrafluoroeihane, carbon dioxide, or other suitable gas. The aerosol may conveniently also contain a surfactant such as lecithin. The dose of chug may be controlled by provision of a metered valve. Alternatively the active ingredients may be provided in the form of a. dry powder, for example a powder mix of the compound in a suitable powder base such as lactose, starch, starch derivatives such as hydroxy-propylmethyl cellulose and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). Conveniently the powder carrier will form a gel in the nasal cavity. The powder composition may be presented in unit dose form for example in capsules or cartridges of, e.g„ gelatin, or blister packs from which the powder may be administered by means of an inhaler. In formulations intended for administration to the respiratory tract, including intranasal formulations, the compound will generally have a small particle size for example of the order of 1 to 10 microns or less. Such a particle size may be obtained by means known in the art, for example by mieronization. The invention will now be described with reference to the following' Examples which illustrate some preferred aspects of the present invention. However, it. is to be understood that die particularity of the following description of the invention is not to supersede the generality of the preceding description of the invention.

EXAMPLES Example 1: Plant extracts All plant extracts were prepared by chopping the plant material and extracting with ethanol in an approximate ratio of 1 part plant material to between 2 to 5 parts of ethanol (w/w). The extract was allowed to stand overnight at 4°C and then the supernatant as decanted and stored at 4"C until use. The presence of epoxy-tigliane compounds in the plant extracts was confirmed by LC.MSMS using a. Shimadau HPLC coupled to an ΑΒ13200 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. A halo amide CIS column was employed to separate the compounds in the mixtures, using acetonitri.1 e/water mixtures as the solvent system. Most of the samples were run with the KinClSGen method, using a CIS 'Kinetix 4,6 aim χ100 mm 2,6 micron CIS column: Acetonitrile: 55% 60% 75% 100% 100% 55% Minutes: 0 2.5 15 15,1 17.5 17,6 Some of the samples were run with the Amide Long method using a Halo amide column RP 4,6 mm χ 150 mm, 2,7 micron, from Advanced Materials Technology: Acetonitrile: 45% 53% 95%= 95% 45% 45% Minutes: 0 13 20: 24 24.1 27 Example 2: Isolation and elucidation of epoxy-tigliane compounds Compounds were- purified from the seeds of Fontainm piemsperma by extraction, and chromatography on silica gel followed by preparative HPLC (CIS Column, methanol/water solvent combinations) using the general methods described below. Approxi mately 1-2 kg of plant material (leaves, fruit, seed, stems, roots flowers, bark or wood) is finely chopped, extracted with 2 partis of ethanol (w/v) three times, the extracts combined, evaporated and the residue partitioned, between water and an immiscible organic solvent (typically petroleum, spirit bp 40-60 (PE) or ethyl acetate ΕℓΟΑ℮). The residue from evaporation of the organic solvent is chromatographed on silica gel in solvent mixtures of increasing polarity, commencing with PE or heptane and progressing to EtOAe and then methanol. The fractions from silica gel are then further purified by preparative HPLC on CIS columns typically using methanol-water gradients. The latter fractions are analysed for bioactivity, pooled according to the retention time of compounds found by analytical HPLC, and subjected to further preparative HPLC to obtain pure compounds. Each compound is bioassayed and its structure confirmed by UV, NMR and mass speetrometric techniques. Compound 1: tigliaen-3-one CH f CH H<.G -V\„ £Ε ‘/1 Μ2- '°x 0jS^IS-CHg /1?

Examples of in vitro effects on cell types involved in wound healing Example 4: Scratch closure and fibroblast migration in vitro The ability of early passage neonatal foreskin fibroblasts (NFF) cultured in RPMI 1640- 10% foetal calf serum to migrate across a scratch wound made in a confluent monolayer following treatment with purified compounds or plant extracts was determined using one or more of the following three methods. Method I Cells were seeded in 16-mrn diameter wells {24- well plates), allowed to become confluent and 2 scratches made in each well using a sterile plastic pipette tip, The medium was removed, the wells washed with phosphate-buffered saline pH 7.2 (PBS) to remove dislodged cells, fresh medium added followed by serial 10-fold dilutions of pure compound or plant extract (2pL). Incubation was continued for 16 to 30 hr. The experiment was terminated when the scratch edges of untreated cultures had closed approximately 25% of the initial gap. The monolayers were washed with PBS, fixed with ethanol and stained with 0.05% crystal violet. Photomicrographs of each well (EVOS microscope) were printed and each scratch measured at 3 places to determine the mean width. Accelerated wound closure was considered to be significant if the remaining gap was <40% of the gap of the untreated controls. Method 2 Cells were seeded in 6 ram wells (96-well plates) or 16 mm (24-well plates), with 2 to 6 replicate weils/dilution, and treated as in Method 1, Immediately after treatment the scratch edges were outlined on the underside of the well with a fine point felt pen. After fixing and staining, migration was assessed under the microscope with the aid of a graticule, scoring migration as 0, 25, 50, 75 or 100% (total closure) of the initial width. Accelerated wound closure was considered to be significant if mean quarfile of replicates was less than that of untreated controls (p<0,05, tlest). In addition, “wound” areas were created by seeding cells in the presence of 3 nun stainless steel pins (96-well plate), or by inserting flat-edged Teflon rings. These devices were removed after overnight incubation of the NFF cells . Method 3 Cells were seeded and treated in 96-well plates as in Method 2 (5 replicate wells per dilution), except that the scratches were made in one action with a tool having 96, 1mm thick teflon coated pins (Essen Bioscience Woundmaker). The plate was then placed in a 37°C, 5% CQi humidified atmosphere in an IncuCyte FLR instrument programmed to photograph each well under phase contrast at 3 hr intervals for 42 hours. The software determined the initial scratch boundaries and their rate of closure, Accelerated wound closure was considered to be significant if the initial rate of closure was >10% of the untreated controls. The results are shown in Tables 7 to 9, Table 7; Rates of Scratch Closure in human neonatal fibroblasts following treatment with pure compounds Compound Method 1 Method 2 Method 3 Test Cone % closure Test Cone % closure Test Cone % closure (ng/mL) compared (ng/mL) compared (ng/mL) compared to control to control to control 1 30 166 200 180 30 150 1 100 146 100 160 2 30 130 30 147 η 100 129 3 200 270 5 30 209 5 200 300 8 200 190 11 200 270 18 200 220 27 1000 158 2000 130 28 200 140 21 200 200 22 200 400 23 200 130 Grey shading with bold indicates scratch closure rate is significantly higher than control treatment All pure compounds were demonstrated to have significantly enhanced rates of scratch closure compared to vehicle-only control treatments.

Additionally, observations of test plates under the microscope (Method 1) suggested that the fibroblasts displayed a gross difference in staining pattern following treatment with Compound 1. Closer investigation revealed this was due to the cells apparently growing in a multilayered fashion, potentially indicating a. loss of contact inhibition, an increase in proliferation, or remodelling capability. Examples of scratch closure in the control and Compound 1 treatment: at 24 hours post scratch are illustrated in Figures 1 and 2 respectively. Example 5: Matrigel invasion assay for migratory ability of human neonatal fibroblasts Matrigel. invasion chambers provide cells with the conditions that allow assessment of their invasive property in vitro. The Matrigel invasion chambers consists of a cell culture companion plate with cell culture inserts containing an 8 -micron pore size PET membrane with a thin layer of Matrigel Basement Membrane Matrix. The Matrigel matrix serves as a reconstituted basement membrane in vitro. The layer occludes the pores of the membrane, blocking non-invasive cells from migrating through the membrane. In contrast, invasive cells are able to detach themsel ves from and invade through the Matrigel matrix and the 8 micron membrane pores. The membrane may be processed for light and electron microscopy and can be easily removed after staining. The chambers were used according to the manufacturer's instructions, as described below in two studies, to assess the effects of Compounds 1, 2, 5 and 42 on migration of human neonatal fibroblasts. The first study assessed effects of three concentrations (0, 10 and 30 ng/rnL) of Compound 1 on neonatal fibroblasts in wells containing media with 10% foetal calf serum. The second study used two concentrations (0 and 3()ng/mL) for each of Compounds 1, 2, 5 and 42 to examine effects on migration of neonatal fibroblasts starved for 2 days prior to treatment and then transferred to media with 1% foetal calf serum. Rehydration The package containing the chambers was removed from -20°C storage and allowed to come to room temperature. Warm (37°C) bicarbonate based culture medium was added to the interior of the inserts (500 pL) and bottom of wells (750 pL). The chambers containing the Matrigel were allowed to rehydrate for 2 hours in humidified tissue culture incubator, 37°C, 5% CO? atmosphere. After rehydration, the medium was carefully removed by aspiration without disturbing the layer of Matrigel™ Matrix on the membrane. Invasion Studies Cells were harvested, and resuspended at 20,000 cells per mL. A total of 250 pL of the cell suspension was placed into the interior of the insert. (5,000 cells). An extra 250 pL media containing the respective Compounds was then added to the interior of the insert to give the desired final concentrations for each of the two studies. A total of 750 pL of media containing appropriate concentrations of each compound in each treatment were placed in the well under the appropriate insert. The Matrigel chambers were then incubated for 24 hours in a humidified tissue culture incubator, at 37°C, 5% C02 atmosphere. Measurement of cell invasion Non-invading cells were removed from the upper surface of the membrane by “scrubbing”. A cotton lipped swab was dipped into the insert after removal of the media, and firm pressure applied while the tip was moved over the membrane surface. The scrubbing was repeated with a second swab moistened with PBS. Cells that had invaded to the external surface of the insert were then fixed by placing in 500 pL of 100% methanol tor at least 5 mins. Inserts were then transferred to a companion plate containing 500 pL of 0·.1℅ crystal violet in methanol, and stained for at least 15 mins. Inserts were destained by passage through 3 companion plates containing 500 pL water, before being air dried. 'The following day, the membrane was removed from the insert housing by inverting the insert and inserting the tip of a sharp scalpel blade through the membrane at the edge adjacent to the housing wall. The insert housing was rotated against the stationary blade and the membrane was released. The membrane was picked out of the housing with forceps, and placed face down on 1.0 pL of Kaiser's glycerol solution and covered with a coverslip. Slides were allowed to dry overnight, before counting of the invading cells. Results In the first study, fibroblasts treated with either 10 or 30 ng/tnL Compound 1 showed increased migratory ability in the Matxigel invasion chamber system compared to cells treated with vehicle alone (Figure 3). The second study confirmed the results of the first study with Compound 1 and demonstrated similar levels of enhanced in migratory ability for Compounds 2, 5 and 42 (Table 10).

Example 6; Scratch repopulation and closure with immortalised human kemtimcyies (HaCaT) in vitro The ability of immortalised human keratinocyte cells (HaCaT) to migrate across a scratch wound made in a confluent monolayer following treatment with either Compound 1 or Compound 37 was determined by the following method. TrypsinisedHaCaT cells were seeded at a.cell density of 7.4x104 cells/mL in 24-well ΒΒ Falcon flat-bottomed, tissue culture plates (VWR. International, UK) in 1. mL Dulbeeeo's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM), supplemented with L-glutamine (2 mM), antibiotics (100 U/rnL penicillin G sodium, 100 pg/niL streptomycin sulphate and 0.25 pg/mL amphotericin Β); and 10% foetal calf serum (all Invitrogen Ltd., IJK) to give a cell density of 7.4χ1()4 cells seeded in each well. The cells were then maintained at 37°C in a 5% €02/95% air atmosphere overnight. The following morning, the 10% foetal calf serum-containing DMEM was replaced with serum-tree .DMEM and the HaCaT cells were subsequently serum-starved in DMEM for 48hr. After 48hr, the serum-free DMEM was removed and a single scratch 'wound' made with a sterile pipette across each cell layer. Following washing twice in ImL PBS, Compound 1- or Compound 37-containing medium (ImL) was added to each well. This medium consisted of DMEM, supplemented with L-glutamine (2mM), antibiotics' (as above) and \% foetal calf serum, in addition to Compound .1 or Compound 3.7 at final concentrations of 0, 0.001., Q.0L0.1, TO, .1.0 or lO0pg/mL. There were three .replicate wells per concentration for each compound. The HaCaT cultures were maintained at 37°C in a 5% GCV95% air atmosphere and the repopulation of the denuded ‘wound' areas monitored by Time-Lapse Confocal Microscopy (Leiea TCS SP5 Confocal Microscope, Leiea Microsystems UK Ltd,, UK) at 100.x, magnification, with digital images captured at fixed positions every 20 min over a 48h period. The digital image sequences were exported and prepared as .avi movie files, using LAS AF Soft ware (Leiea Microsystems).The rates of HaCaT wound closure in vitro were quantified using Imaged Software (Imaged 1,37ν.; http;//rsb.info,nih,gov/iV).The data was analysed by One Way Analysis of Variance with post-test Tukey analysis. Each experiment was performed on 3 separate occasions. At 48 hrs after application. Compound 1 significantly increased the rate of scratch closure (pcO.Ol) compared to the control treatment at concentrations of 0.001, 0.01 and 0.1 ng/ml (Table 11), At 48 hours Compound 37 also increased the rate of scratch closure (p<Q,01) compared to the control treatment at concentrations of 0.001, 0.01, 0.1 and 1.0 pg/ml (Table 11), Table 11: Extent of scratch repopulation and closure by immortalised human keratinocyte (HaCaT) cells at 48 hours after treatment over a range of concentrations of Compound 1 and Compound 37. Data are for % of scratch wound area remaining open after treatment (± standard errors).

The first of these experiments addressed migration aspects and repeated the scratch repopulation study but with the addition of Ipg/mL of Mitomycin C to the medium at the same time that the compounds were applied. Mitomycin C is known to inhibit cellular proliferation, including that of HaCaT cells; and was determined to not be cytotoxic in the culture system at the lpg/mL concentration. The results of this migration study found enhanced (p<0,05) scratch repopulation and closure at concentrations between 0.001 and 1.0 .ug/tnL for both Compound 1 and Compound 37. The proliferation experiment assessed the effects of the two compounds on HaCaT proliferation (as measured by ΜΤΤ) in. the culture system at 4 time periods (24, 48, 120 and 168hr). Both Compounds 1 and 37 had a significant effect (p<0.01) in increasing proliferation of HaCaT cell across a range concentrations between 0.001 and IGpg/mL in comparison to the control treatment with no compound added. These results demonstrate that both proliferation and enhanced cell migration are involved in the scratch repopulation and closure process with Compounds 1 and 37. Example 7: Differentiation of monocytes into macrophages by the compounds Macrophages play numerous roles in wound healing, including clearing cellular debris and necrotic tissue in the early, inflammatory stage followed by the support of cell proliferation and tissue restoration during the later stages of healing. The Ml phenotype is considered to he associated with the early inflammatory stage and the M2 phenotype with the healing stage. To dete.rmi.he potential effects of of Compound 1 and fifteen other epoxy-tigliane compounds in the army on monocyte differentiation, human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated by Ficoll-Paque sedimentation of heparinised blood from a 72-year old male human donor, and plated at 100,000 cells/well in RPMI-1640 10% FCS. Duplicate wells were treated with 10-fold dilutions of the compounds and incubated at 37°C for 4 days. The wells were scored visually for cell attachment and morphology, then washed twice with PBS, stained with sulfurhodamine and the incorporate stain quantitated in an ELISA reader. The plates were then washed with water and stained with 1% crystal violet in methanol for photography and scoring of adherent ceil morphology. The results from a dose-response experiment with human PBMCs (Table 12) showed that all sixteen epoxy-tigliane compounds tested differentiated peripheral blood monocytes into macrophages at ng concentrations, as judged by adherence and morphology which was a mixture of dendritic cells typical of the M2 phenotype, and rounded cells typical of the M'l phenot ype.

While myofibroblasts contribute to tissue repair and closure of wounds, their over-expression is associated with impaired healing and excessive scarring. The effects of Compounds 1 and. 37 on dermal fibroblast differentiation to myofibroblasts was examined by the extent of a-SMA expression by TGF-Pt-stimulated dermal fibroblasts. Methods Following trypsiriization, fibroblasts were seeded in S-welkPermanoxchamher slides (VWR International) in DMEM medium, containing antibiotics, 2 raM L-glutamine and. 30% foetal calf serum (250 pL, all purchased from Invitrogen); at a cell density of 2,5x104cells/we11 and maintained at 37°C in 5% CO^/95% air for 48k At 48hr, fibroblasts were growth-arrested in serum-free DMEM for 48hr and then replaced with serum-free DMEM (250 pL), containing Compounds 1. or 37 at concentrations of 0. 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1.0 and 10.0 ug/mL (3 wells/conccntration/ compound) and TGF-fi: (lOng/ml, Peproteeh). Fibroblasts were maintained at 37eC in 5% C02/95% air .for 72br. At 72hr, chamber slide wells were washed with PBS (xl, 250 pL) and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (100 pL/well) for lOrain. The chamber slide wells were then washed again with PBS (xl, 250 pi), treated with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS (100 pL, Sigma) for 5min and rewashed with PBS (xl, 250 pL). Wells were blocked with 1% BSA in PBS (250 pL, Sigma) for Ih and washed (χ3) in 0.1% BSA/PBS. Wells were incubated with monoclonal mouse anti-human a-SMA, clone 1Α4 (1:100, 150η1, Sigma) at 4°C overnight, washed (χ·6) in 0.1% BSA/PBS and incubated with Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:1000, 250 p.L, Invitrogen), at room temperature for lh, under darkness. Chamber slides were washed (χ6) in 0,1% BSA/PBS and counterstahied with Hoescht 33258 solution for 30 min under darkness (1:2000, 250 pL, Sigma). Chamber were subsequently removed for slides and treated with Fluorsave (Santa Crux) for lOmin tinder darkness. Slides were viewed by fluorescence microscopy (Leica Microsystem), with digital images being capturedat χ2(Κ) magnification. Digital images were processed using H€ Image J Software. Results In the control treatment with TGF-pi hut no Compounds added, the adult dermal fibroblasts differentiated into myofibroblasts, typically charcaterized by increased a-SMA expression, α-SMA stress fibre assembly and the overall development of an enlarged, polygonal cellular morphology. In contrast, exposure of adult dermal fibroblasts treated with ΤϋΡ-βΐ to Compound 1 and Compound 37 affected differentiation into myofibroblasts in a concentration-dependent manner. In the case of Compound 1 at a concentration of 0,1 pg/mL, the fibroblast cultures lacked the a-SMA stress fibre formation and the typical polygonal cellular morphology, representative of myofibroblast differentiation (Figure 5), With Compound 37 there was a disruptive effect on .a-SMA stress fibre formation and polygonal morphology development at a 10 pg/mL concentration (Figure 6). Furthermore, there appear to be other subtle alterations in myofibroblast morphology across the range of concentrations between 1 and 10 pg/mL of Compound 1 and between 0.1 to 1.0 pg/m'L for Compound 37 (Figures 5 and 6). Specific effects of the compounds on fibroblast/ myofibroblast differentiation may be relevant to the minimal sear formation observed in wounds treated in vivo with Compound 1 (Examples .16 and 17), Example 9: Induction of reactive oxygen burst by neutrophils in response to Compound 1 Neutrophils are dedicated phagocytic cells of the innate immune system and their influx, and activation is essential for the clearance of bacteria, fungi and cellular debris during early stages of wound healing. The broad antimicrobial activity of neutrophils is based on several strategies including bursts of reactive oxygen species (ROS). A study was undertaken to assess the potential effects of Compound 1 in inducing reactive oxygen burst by neutrophils. Neutrophils were isolated from fresh blood of a healthy human donor by lysis of a red blood cell pellet that had been obtained by FicolTPaque sedimentation. The neutrophils (~ 4 χ. 106cells/ml) were incubated with 10 pg/tnl dlhydroethidium (DHE) (Sigma-Aldrich) in complete culture medium at. 37°C for I S min alongside an aliquot of unstained cells to be tested as unstained control. This incubation was followed by treatment with Compound 1 at a range of concentrations (0, 1 ng/ml, 10 ng/nil, 100 ng/ml, 1 pg/ml, 10 pg/ml, 100 pg/rol) for 15 min. The generation of reactive oxygen species following incubation was determined using a FACS Canto flow cytometer to measure fluorescence due to oxidation of DHE to the ethidium ion. 'This study found no production of ROS in the control treatment without Compound 1 present. In contrast. Compound 1 induced the significant production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in a dose-dependent manner, with ROS production increasing with concentrations of Compound 1, Examples of effects of compounds on proteins, genes and cytokines relevant to improved wound healing outcomes Example 10: Molecular analysis of human neonatal fibroblasts treated with Compounds 1 and 42 The Western Blot method was used to identify effects of Compounds 1 and 42 on proteins relevant to would repair and healing in human neonatal fibroblast cells (NFFs). Two studies were conducted. In the first study, NFFs were treated with either 10 or 30 ng Compound I/niL for 6 or 24 hours, before 'harvesting, and protein extraction.. In the second study NFFs were heated individually with 30 ng/mL concentrations of Compounds 1 and 42 respectively for 6 hours. The resulting lysates from both studies were subjected to western blot analysis, and probing with specific antibodies to key signalling molecules involved in wound repair and healing. Preparation of protein samples for Western blotting. The medium from adherent human neonatal fibroblasts grown in 75 cm2 plates was removed and the cells were washed twice in ice cold PBS. The attached cells were harvested in 10 mL of ice cold PBS using a cell scraper (Costar®, Coming) pelleted hy centrifugation for 5 min (1,500 rpm, RTemp), resuspended in 1 mL of ice-cold PBS, and transferred to a 1.5 mLmierofuge tube. The cells were collected by centrifugation (13,200 rpm. RTemp, 2 s), the PBS removed arid the pellets stored at -20°C until required. The frozen pellets were thawed on ice, and resuspended in a volume of cell lysis buffer 3-4 times the volume of the pellet by pipetting up and down. The cell suspension was sonicated 60 s at 4°C and centrifuged for .20 min (13,200 rpm, 4°C) and the in.terpha.se. containing the protein transferred to a fresh 1.5 ml microfuge tube. The protein was stored at -20° C. Determination of protein concentration Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA Protein Assay kit (Pierce), This method is based on the reduction of Cu2+ to Cu1+ by protein in an alkaline solution. The Cu1+ formed is subsequently chelated with hieinchronic acid (BCA) forming a purple reaction product. Protein samples were diluted 1/10 and 1 /20 (ν/ν) in MiiliQ water and 10 ,uL was plated out in duplicate in a flat-bottomed 96-well plate (Costar®. Coming). Stock solutions of bovine serum albumin (BSA) were prepared at 1.00, 200, 400, 600, 1,000, and 1,200 pg/mL and 10 μℓΛν℮13 plated out in duplicate and assayed alongside the samples. The BCA working reagent was prepared by mixing 50 parts of reagent A with 1 part of reagent Β and aliquoting 100 pL to each well. The plate was incubated at 37°C for 30-45 min to allow the reaction to occur. The raw absorbances were read at A59Q run on a mieroplate reader (VERSAmax, Molecular Devices) and a standard curve produced using SOFT max PRO software (Molecular Devices). Concentrations of unknown samples were estimated from the curve. SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Protein samples were prepared by mixing with an appropriate volume of 2 x SDS loading buffer and denatured by heating for 10 min at ?0°C. The SDS-PAGE gel was performed using the Mini-Protean II dual slab gel apparatus (Bio-Rad Laboratories) as described by Laemmli (6); The resolving gel consisted of 0.275 Μ Tris-HCl (pH 8,8), 0.1 % (w/v) SDS, 0.05% (w/v) freshly made-up ammonium persulphate, .1% (ν/ν) TEMED and between 7,5-12% (w/v) acrylamide/bisacrylamide (29:1). The solution was made up to 5 mL in MiiliQ H2Q, and allowed to set for at least 30 min (RTenip) while oveflayed with water-saturated butanol. Before pouring the stacking gel, the water-saturated butanol was tipped off. The stacking gel consisted of 0.125 Μ Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 0.05% (w/v) freshly made-up ammonium persulphate, 0.1% (ν/ν) TEMED and 4% (w/v) acrylamide/bisacrylamide (29:1). The solution was made to 2,5 mL per gel in MiiliQ Η2Ο, poured on top of the resolving gel and allowed set with a 10-well comb (Bio-Rad Laboratories) for at least 30 min. Electrophoresis was performed for approximately 1 h or unti l the dye from had ran off the bottom of the gel (200 V, RTenip) in lx SDS running buffer, Western transfer Following SDS-PAGE electrophoresis the gel plates were carefully separated, the stacking gel cut off and transferred to the Mini Trans-Blot Cell (Bio-Rad Laboratories). A “transfer sandwich” was assembled as follows: a porous sponge, two sheets of blotting (Whatmann) paper, nitrocellulose membrane, the gel, two more pieces of blotting of blotting paper and another porous sponge and inserted into the transfer apparatus. The sponges, membrane and blotting paper were pre-wet in cold electroblot buffer and care was taken to prevent any air bubbles to form as this would result in inconsistent transfer of proteins. The proteins were transferred at 100 V for 1 h (constant voltage) in ice-cold transfer buffer at: 4°C with the nitrocellulose: membrane (Ηybond™-C, Amersham Biosciences) closer to the anionic side, and an ice pack and magnetic stirrer added. Probing protein membranes Once transferred, the membrane was incubated in 5% (w/v) Blotto in 0.1% (ν/ν) Tween 20/TBS at RTemp for at least 30 min with gentle orbital shaking to block non-specific binding sites. The primary antibody was diluted in 5% (w/v) BSA as recommended by the manufacturer (see Table 13 below) to a final volume of 2 mL, A plastic envelope containing the membrane and antibody was made and heat-sealed, removing as many air-bubbles possible. The envelopes were rotated on a custom made rotor overnight (approximately 16 h) at 4°C. The membrane was removed from the bag, placed in a plastic tray with 0.1% .(ν/γ) Tween 20/TBS and washed four times at room temperature with vigorous orbital shaking for 15 min per wash. The appropriate secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was probed to the membrane by diluting it 1/1,000 in 5% (w/v) Blotto in 0.1% (ν/ν) Tween 20/TBS and placing it in a fresh plastic envelope which was rotated at room temperature for 2 hr. Immune-detection of proteins In order to remove any unbound or non-specifically bound antibody, the membrane was washed in 0.1% (ν/ν) Tween 20/TBS/ at room temperature four times lor 15 min each. The Western Lighting™ Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was used to generate detectable signal from secondary antibodies labelled with HRP. The reagent relies on the oxidative degradation of luminal catalysed by HRP, resulting in the emission of light which is detectable 420 nm and can he captured on film. Equal volumes from bottle 1 and bottle 2 were mixed just prior to detection, A total volume of 2 mL per membrane was applied and incubated at room temperature for 1 min. Care was taken to ensure that the whole membrane was equally exposed. The membrane was removed, dried quickly on some blotting paper, inserted between two pieces of polypropylene sheet, protectors into a film cassette (Hypercassette™, Amersham Bioscienees) and exposed to piece of film (SuperRX, Fujifilm). An initial exposure of 2 min was used to judge optimal detection time. The film was developed in a Kodak Image Station (Kodak).

Activation of the ΜΕΚ / ERK branch of the MAP Kinase pathway in known to influence the migratory phenotype of many cellular types, including fibroblasts. No difference in levels of ΜΜΡ9 was detected. Similar patterns of phosphorylation of phospho-ERK were found on Western Blots in the second study with 30 tig/tnL concentrations of Compounds 1 and 42 on the NFFs. Example 11: Effect of Compound 1 on expression of genes involved in wound healing The effects of Compound 1 on expression of genes associated with wound healing were examined in two situations (a) human PBMCs and (b) mouse stroma of human tumour xenografts. Materials and Methods Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated by Ftcoll-Paque sedimentation of heparin!sed blood from a 68-year old male human donor, and cultured in RPfvll-1640 10% PCS. Following treatment with Compound 1 at 30 ng/m'L, the monolayer was Washed once with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and the cells harvested with sterile scrapers and stored as pel lets at -80° C. Mouse stroma in human tumour xenografts were obtained from mice in. which the Sk-Mel-28 human melanoma cell line was injected subcutaneously into 2 sites on the flanks of each BALJB/c Foxithm mouse (2 χ 106cells/site) and allowed to grow to approximately 7 mm diameter. Each tumour was then injected with 50 pL of 20% propylene glycol containing 30 pg Compound 1 or with 50 pL of 20% propylene glycol. At different times after injection a mouse was euthanased. and the tumours harvested, the skin covering removed, and the intact tumours stored at -80 C RNA was extracted from 30 mg of frozen tumour or 1 χ 107 cells using the QiagenRNeasyPlus Mini Kit, according to manufacturer’s instructions, then quantitated with a .NanoDrop instrument and integrity confirmed on denaturing agarose gels hearing a 1 kb DNA marker and stained with ethidium bromide. RNA amplification ami Iabetting. Approximately 500 ng of total unlabelled RNA was adjusted to a final volume of 11 pL with nuclease-free water, The- RN A was incubated with 9 pL of the reverse transcriptase master mix (1 pL of Τ7 Oligo (dT) Primer, 2 pL of 10Χ first strand buffer; 4 pL of dNTP mix, 1 pL of RNase inhibitor and 1 pL of ArrayScript) at 42 'C for 2 hr. This was followed by the second strand cDNA synthesis step which involved a further incubation at 16 C for 2 hr with. 80 pi. of the second strand master mix (63 pL nuclease-free water, 10 pL 10Χ second strand buffer. 4 pL dNTP mix, 2 p.L DNA polymerase and 1 pL RNase If). The cDNA was purified by filtering through a cDNA Filter Cartridge with 250 pL of cDNA binding buffer and washing with 500 pL of the wash buffer provided in the kit. Purified cDNA was eluted with 20 pL of 55 C nuclease-free water. Each cDNA sample was incubated with 7.5 pL of the IVT master mix (2.5 pL of Τ7 10Χ reaction buffer, 2.5 pL of Τ7 enzyme mix and 2.5 pL biotin-NTP mix) at 37 *C for 16 hr. The reaction was stopped with the addition of 75 pL of nuclease-free water to each eRNA sample. The biotinylated, amplified RNA was purified by filtering the cRNA. samples through cRNA Filter Cartridges with 350 pL of cRNA. binding buffer and 250 pL of 100 % ethanol mixed together prior to loading onto the filters. The cRNA filter cartridges with attached RNA were then washed with 650 pL of wash buffer before eluting purified cRNA with 200 μΕ of 55 *C nuclease-free water. tllumma Expression BeadChip Hybridization,The cRNA samples were heated at 65eC for 5 min and collected by pulse centrifugation. After heating at 65 degrees for 5 min, approximately 750 ng of the cRNA sample was aliquoted into separate tubes to which were added ~ 5 pL of'RNasefree water and 10 pL of Hyh Mix. Approximately 15 pL of the prepared cRNA mix was loaded onto the Illumina Expression BeadChips, Subseqent steps of hybridisation and washing were carried out according to the Whole-Genome Gene Expression Direct Hybridization Assay Guide supplied by Illumina. The Human HT-12 ν4 Expression BeadChips cover more than 47.000 transcripts and known splice variants across the human transcriptome. The MouseRef-8 ν2.0 Expression BeadChips cover approximately 25,600 well-annotated RefSeq (Reference Sequence) transcripts, comprising Over 19,000 unique genes. Data analysis. BeadChips were read by the iScan System, and transferred via GenomeStudio into GeneSpring GX vl.2,5 (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The expression values were normalized using quantile normalization with default settings. The entities were filtered based on the detection score calculated by GenomeStudio where ρ < 0.05 was' considered significant. Wound healing-relevant gene expression changes induced in human PBMCs by Compound I. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are rich in. lymphocytes and macrophage precursors (.monocytes) involved in the production of cytokines and tissue remodelling enzymes relevant to the wound healing process. Table 14 lists gene expression changes induced by 30 ng/mL Compound 1 that were >2 times higher or >2 times lower than control, untreated PBMCs, and .had a known link with wound healing. Wound healing is a complex, multistage sequence in which processes such as inflammation subsequently need to be down-regulated. It. should therefore be noted that the genes shown in Table 14 illustrate the range of relevant molecules regulated by Compound 1 in a mixed lymphoid population in vitro, without specifying the order of tissue-specific expression in vivo.. The genes included pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-la, IL-1 β and IL.-6) involved in protection from infection, cytokines to moderate the inflammatory response (IL-10 and IL-24), growth factors (GMCSF, CSF1 and HBEGF), and a range of ehemokines and matrix metallopeptidases for tissue remodelling (the latter facilitated by down-regulation of TIMP2), Down regulation of THBS1, which suppresses granulation tissue formation, is also a positive factor in wound healing. Up-regulation of KLF10 should facilitate angiogenesis and is indicative of induction of TGF-p. Transglutaminases (TGM) stabilise proteins by cross linking them and have other beneficial effects in wound healing. Table 14.

Changes in gene expression relevant to wound healing were therefore assayed in the mouse-deri ved stroma of human tumour xenografts at early times after injection while the tumour was still intact. Expression data using mouse gene-specific microarrays were performed for 2-3 individual human S.K-Me.1-28 xenografts treated by intratumoural injection with 30 pg of Compound 1, along with 3 vehicle-only sites, the data combined. Only those mouse genes for which expression in the Compound 1 treated site was >2 times higher or >2 times lower than in the vehicle-injected site were examined for relevance to wound healing. Table 15 lists genes selected by the above criteria and with known links to wound healing, A number of genes with known favourable outcomes for wound healing were up-regulated by at least 2-fold by Compound 1. These were genes involved in muscle contraction (ACTA1), growth (EGR1), modulation of inflammation (CXCLT), keratins for renewal of keralinoeytes (krt5, .1.0,14,15, 17, 7L krtdap), keratinoeytc migration (Coll7a 1), epidermal differentiation and cell communication (lor, Tgm2, Itga.7). One wound healing related gene,2 (Thbs2), was down-regulated. Down-regulation of this gene is associated withvascular density and increase in fibronectin in early stages of wound healing. Table 15.

The effects of Compounds 1,2, 5 and 42 on regulation of four cytokines (IL-lp, IL-6, IL-8 and TNFfit) known to be critical in early stages of the wound healing process were investigated in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). PBMCs were isolated by Ficoll-Paque sedimentation of heparinised blood acquired from both a 72-year old male (Donor 1) and 34-year old (Donor 2) male human donor. All cells were cultured in 10% FCS, RPMI as detailed previously. PBMCs were seeded at a density of 1.5χ10^ cells per well in 10% FCS, RPMI Stimulation of these cells with the four compounds was performed at four concentrations (0 ng/mL, 3 ng/mL. 30 ng/mL, 300 ng/mL) in duplicate for 24h in a humidified incubator at 37°C, 5% COj. Media samples were taken from each of the required wells and frozen at -8Q°C until use. Cytometric Bead Array (CBA.) assays were used to measure the results. CBA assays provide, a method for capturing a soluble analyte or set of analytes using antibody coated beads of known sizes and fluorescence- Detection is then performed using another fluorescently labelled secondary antibody to form a sandwich complex. Each media sample was assayed for the presence of soluble 1L-1 β, 1L-6, IL-8, LL-10. IL-12p70 and TNFa using a BD (Becton Dickinson) CBA Human Inflammatory Cytokine Detection Kit according to manufacturers' instructions. Mean fluorescence intensity values from each sample were compared against a standard curve to determine cytokine concentrations (pg/mLJ. The results of the CB A assay for each compound arc shown in Table 16. All four compounds significantly increased levels of the four cytokines (TNFa, 1Β-1β, IL-6, IL-8) that were detected in supernatants assayed from the treated PBMCs, with trends consistent between PBMCs from the two donors. Highest cytokine levels generally occurred at the two highest concentrations (30 and 300 ng/mL) of the compounds. Table 16. Production of cytokines from PBMCs after incubation for 24 hr at concentrations of 0, 3. 30 and 300 ng compound/ml for Compounds 1, 2, 5 and 42. Cytokine levels are expressed in pg/ml ± standard deviation and are presented for each of two donors.

Pro-inflammatory cells, primarily neutrophils and macrophages, migrate to the site and protect it from infection and release cytokines and chemokines involved in the initiation and regulation of subsequent tissue repair. Male nude mice were injected subcutaneously on each flank with 50 pL of solutions of 100 ,ug/mL of Compounds 1, 2, 5 and 42 respectively in 20% propylene glycol Each site reddened within 4 hr and by 24 hr the affected area covered approximately 1 cm diameter of skin. Induration formed over the next; 6 days and by 14 days the site had completely healed with minimal scarring. The acute inflammatory response initiated by the compounds in mouse skin, followed by rapid resolution, is consistent with the observed direct effects of the compounds on pro-inflammatory cells (Examples 7 and 9) and on gene expression and cytokine profiles in PBMCs (Examples 11 and 12). Such a robust but transient pro-inflammatory response has often been associated with good in vivo wound healing outcomes. Example 14: Gel formulation of Compound 1 Either 30 mg or 50 mg of Compound 1 (>97%; purity by HPLC} was dissolved in 5 ml. of 99.5% isopropyl alcohol (Biotech Pharmaceuticals) and allowed to stand overnight. A solution of 0.6% Carbomer 940 (Snowdrift Farms) was prepared as the gelling agent in 5mL of sterile water. The Compound 1 concentrate and the 0,6% Carbomer 940 solution were then added together in a 20 mL syringe and thoroughly mixed. 20 pL of 100% triethanolamine (Sigma-Aldrich) was then added and mixed rapidly. The resulting Compound 1 gel was then dispensed into individual 1 mL insulin syringes to produce doses of 3 mg Compound 1/mL and 5mg Compound 1/mL, Example 15: Injectable formulation of Compound 1 20mg of Compound 1 (>97% purity by HPLC) was dissolved in 8 mL of 1,2 propanediol (Sigma-Aldrich) in a 20 mL capacity glass scintillation vial and allowed to stand overnight at. room temperature, 12 mL of either 30 mM acetate buffer at pH 4,2 or saline (sodium chloride for injection BP 0,9% - AstraZeneca) was then added to the solution and thoroughly mixed. The solution was then filler sterilised and dispensed into 1 mL dose of 1 mg/mL concentration of Compound 1. Example 16: Veterinary clinical treatment of non-healing wounds and wounds that do not respond to current standards of care Compound 1 has been used to treat to heal difficult wounds in 10 pet (Le. privately owned and cared for) animals with the aim of improving second intention wound healing. Seven dogs (Cams lupus familiam) and one tree kangaroo (Dmdrolagus lumholtzu) with chronic, non-healing wounds that were unresponsive to current, veterinary standards-of-care for these indications were treated with Compound 1 by independent veterinarians, A second tree kangaroo and a spectacled flying fox (Pteropus cOnspidllatus) with wounds unsuited for initial treatment with current standards-of-care were also treated with Compound 1. All eases were managed as open wounds without the use of dressings or other bandaging during the course of treatment with Compound 1 and the subsequent period of wound resolution. Unless stated in individual case studies, no concomitant medications were used over the course of treatments with Compound 1. Case and treatment notes for each of these patients are summarised below'. Note that the return presentation of these animals to the treating veterinarians was often irregular and wound healing outcomes may have occurred well before the return assessment visits. Treatment with. Compound 1 resulted in effective wound resolution with minimal scarring in the eight completed cases. Wound resolution was well progressed in the two on-going case studies that were most recently treated (Case studies 8 and 10). Case Studies 1 to 8: Non-healing wounds Case Study 1: Non-healing deep necrosing facial wound, 3 year old Bernese mountain dog Case notes: · Large, oval shaped facial wound 7cm long χ 4cm wide χ up to 2cm deep on the left hand side of the patient’s nuzzle. • Wound was crusted with patches of necrotic postulant discharge, * Histppathology: deep necrosing injury possibly associated with a spider bite and characterised by the presence of coceoid bacteria and suppurative inflammation. * Wound had not responded to standard wound treatment protocols involving antibiotics (cephalexin, amoxyclav, gentamicin) and anti-inflammatories (macrolone) over a period of 3 months. * Wound was gradually increasing in size, causing eye closure and significantly affecting patient’s vision and general demeanour. The patient’s mandihullar lymph nodes had become enlarged. * Remaining standard-of-care option was for aggressive facial surgery7 and reconstruction. * Initial treatment involved 5 applications (totalling 5.3mL) of Compound 1 gel (3 mg/mL) over an initial 14 day period (Compound 1 applied on days 1,2, 6. 10 and 54). * After partial resolution of the wound at 28 days, the patient was treated with a single 1 mL dose of Compound 1 (0.5 mg/mL) injected just under the surface at multiple locations throughout the wound area. * At 35 days following injection with Compound 1 the wound had infilled with healthy differentiating granulation tissue and there was no evidence of infection. * Concomitant medications over the course of the treatment with Compound 1 were temgesic and iignocaine at time of the first treatment with gel formulation, temgesic and tramadol at the time of and on the day immediately after the injection treatment (he. days 28 and 29) and then a supportive cover of low dose oral corticosteroid (macrolone) daily from day 42. * At 76 days following the final treatment the wound had healed and was infilled with normal tissue minimal scarring and also hair regrowth covering greater than 95% of the original wound area. Case Study 2; Burst, infected abdominal cyst, 13 year old Boxer Case notes: * Frail patient with severe osteoarthritis, considered a high anaesthetic risk for any surgical intervention. * Patient had persistent infected cyst on the back proximal to the tail that had not responded to regular draining and injection of the cyst with antibiotics (gentamycin, enrofloxaein, noroeiliin) over a 5 month period. * Patient presented with the burst cyst and elevated temperature. The cyst was cleaned to remove dead skin and then Hushed with saline and ehlorhextdene. The patient was treated with antibiotics (clindamycin and norociilin) and anti-inflammatories (metacam). * After 5 days the wound associated with the burst cyst showed no signs of resolving and was surrounded by significant local inflammation. The exposed area of the wound (approximately 5cm long χ 3 cm wide by up to 2,5cm deep) was then flushed with saline and 0.5 mL of Compound 1 gel (3 mg/mL) was applied evenly over the wound area, * By 5 days post treatment: with the Compound 1 gel the wound had significantly contracted to less than 30% of the area of the original wound (approximate dimensions 3cm long χ 1.5cm wide χ lem deep) and was comprised of healthy granulation tissue, * At 30 days the wound had resolved with normal tissue and greater than 70% hair regrowth over the original wound area. * Concomitant medications for this patient over the course of the treatment with Compound 1 wet® an injectable non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (metacam) at time treatment. Case Study 3: Non-healing infected puncture wounds, 11 year old Chow Chow Case notes: • The patient presented with two large bite wounds (each approximately 4cm long χ 1.5cm wide χ 2cm deep) on the rump from a dog fight. • Wounds were washed and the patient treated with antibiotics (amoxyclav tablets and. inject able η oracilli η) • After 8 days the wounds were persistent, not closing up and infected. • The wounds were cleaned and 0.4 mL of Compound 1 gel (3 mg/mL) applied evenly to each wound. • By 15 days post treatment with Compound 1 the wounds had significantly contracted to less than 40% of their original size, formed eschars and there was no evidence of infection. • At 46 days following treatment with Compound 1 the wounds had completely resolved with normal tissue, no scarring and complete hair regrowth over the wound area. • No concomitant medications were with this patient over the treatment with Compound 1. Case Study 4: Nan-healing infected wounds on the face and metatarsals of a canine (II year old Boxer) Case notes; • The patient presented with two areas of non-healing infected and inflamed wounds, one on the left hand side of the face and one on the left hind metatarsals that had not responded to a prolonged 8 week course of antibiotics (cephalexin, doxyeyciine) and corticosteroids (macrolone). • A single treatment of a 5 mg/mL gel formulation of Compound 1 was applied to wound on the face (0.4 mL) and to the wound on the leg (0.6 mL), • The facial wound responded rapidly to treatment with Compound 1 with a small eschar present at 7 days and complete wound closure, including significant hair regrowth evident by 14 days after treatment. The wound area was fully healed by 63 days after treatment. • The wound on leg also responded quickly with eschar present in localised areas. By 14 days the eschar had Largely shed and healthy underlying granulation tissue was observed. The wound area had completely closed and had greater than 95% hair cover at 63 days after treatment. • Concomitant medications fur this patient over the course of the treatment with Compound 1 were an on-going daily course of low dose corticosteroids (macrolone) for treatment of canine atopic dermatitis syndrome. Case Study 5: Non-healing infected wound on the ear of a canine (4 year old Bull Arab) Case notes: • Patient presented with a non-healing laceration due to a hunting accident that had been present oil the left ear for more than 6 weeks. • Three treatments, each of 0.1 mL of 5 mg/mL gel formulation of Compound 1, were applied to the affected area at 8 day intervals. No concomitant medications Were used during the course of treatment of the patient with Compound 1.. • By 41 days after the first treatment with Compound 1 the wound had fully closed. A further assessment at 152 days after the initial treatment showed complete wound resolution, minimal scarring with greater than 80% hair coverage over the original wound Case Study 6: Non-healing infected wound on ear of a canine (11 year old Boxer) Case notes: • The patient: presented with non-healing (infected and inflamed) sore on upper part of left ear and was treated for 10 weeks with standard-of-eare protocols involving regular application of (!) a topical dermatological formulation (Neotopic) combining antibacterial (neomycin sulphate), anti-inflammatory (hydrocortisone) and anti-pruritic (tignocaine) agents, and (b) a commercial suspension (Auraeol) with anti-inflammatory (prednisolone), antifungal (miconazole nitrate) and antibacterial (polymixin Β sulphate) components. Prior to these treatments the patient was on an on-going course of low dose oral corticosteroids (macmlone) lor treatment of chronic canine atopic dermatitis syndrome. • After 10 weeks of the standard-of-care protocol there was no sign of wound resolution. • A single treatment of 3 mL of a 5 nig/mL gel formulation of Compound 1 was applied to the affected area and within 15 minutes of application of Compound 1 there was discernable reddening of the treated area, • Front 4 days after treatment with Compound 1 the patient recommenced low' dose daily corticosteroids (macrolone) for treatment of the severe atopic dermatitis. This treatment continued through the full course of wound healing and resolution, • At 17 days after treatment with Compound 1 there was no sign of infection or inflammation and a well granulated wound bed had developed at the treated site. • At 83 days after treatment there was complete wound closure and hair regrowth had occurred over more than 90% of the original wound area. • By 139 days after treatment it was not possible to discern the site of the original wound, there was no evidence of scarring and or differences in skin pigmentation or apparent thickness in and surrounding the treated area. Case Study 7; Non-healing infected wounds on the ears and lace of a canine (8 year old Jack Russell terrier) Case notes: • The patient presented with two non-healing wounds at the tip and base of the right ear and a non-healing wound on the snout that owner had observed present for more than 4 weeks. Possible origin was infected spider or other insect bites. • Two treatments, each of ϋ.1 mL of 5 mg/mL gel formulation of Compound 1, were applied to both affected areas on the ears at a 5 day interval, A single treatment of O.lmL of 5mg/mL gel formulation of Compound 1 was applied to the facial lesion, • By 13 days after the first treatment with Compound 1 both wounds on the ear had contracted significantly and had formed eschars. By 29 days the wound had fully closed and with complete cover of hair growth • At 16 days after treatment, the wound on the snout had fully resolved. • Concomitant medication for this patient was a 5 day course of the oral antibiotics amoxicillin, and clavulanie acid (amoxyclav) at the time of the initial treatment. Case Study 8: Infected bone wound on the leg of a tree kangaroo (Marsupialia, Dendrohigus lumholtzi) Case notes: • The patient presented as a wild tree kangaroo injured in a dog attack that resulted in la.erpsa.cral luxation and osteomyelitis. The patient was treated for 1 month with injectable antibiotics ceftazidime (Fortum), and trimethoprim sulphamethoxazole (TMS). While inflammation had been reduced bacterial swab revealed Gram negative bacteria and Serratiamarcesens. were still present The affected limb was not weight hearing. • Treatment with ceftazidime for a further 2 weeks resulted in no improvement in condition and veterinarian advised poor prognosis for clearing of infection from the bone and likely significant mechanical disruption to bone structure which would comprise future gait. A. new bacterial swab taken from discharging sinuses on the hock and pad at that time revealed mixed anaerobe species and Gram positive Acumnnyces species so a single slow IV infusion of sodium iodide (Sod'ide) was deli vered. • Because of the lack of response to other treatments and the overall poor prognosis with these standards of care, rescue treatment involving 4 applications of 5 mg/mL gel formulation of Compound 1 was commenced 2 weeks later. • For the first application 0.1 mL of the Compound 1 gel was applied to each of three lesions on the right hock (one over the ankle joint, one underneath the foot pad and a small lesion at the base of the heal) and a slow IV infusion of sodium iodide commenced, Within 10 minutes of the application of Compound 1 gel there was a purulent discharge from the treated area, • On presentation 8 days after the first treatment a purulent discharge was oozing from 2 of the 3 wounds on the leg. The other wound (smallest lesion on the heal) had contracted and commenced healing. A further treatment of 0.15 niL of 5 mg/niL gel formulation of Compound 1 was used to treat each of the two open wounds (one over the ankle joint, the •other on the base of the foot pad). A slow IV infusion of sodium iodide was also given, • A further 15 days later (23 days after initial treatment) several niLs of thick purulent pus was squeezed from the wound on the pad of the foot before forcing 0.15 niL of 5 mg/niL gel formulation of Compound 1 into the drained wound sinus. • One week later there was significant improvement in the infection. A small piece of bone was removed from the hole in the foot pad. There was no pus evident but there was a serous discharge. A further 0.2 niL of the Compound 1 gel was applied to each of lesions, one oyer the ankle, the other underneath the foot, A slow IV infusion of sodium iodide was also delivered. Limb is now weight bearing, but the heal and foot pad is still very firm with inflammation and the animal’s gait is very uneven and strongly favouring the undamaged hind leg. • A further 15 days later the wound over the ankle joint had fully closed and hair was growing back. The wound on the heal of the foot pad had contracted to less than 50% of its size at the previous visit and the surrounding skin and tissue is soft, pliable and normal. The limb was now fully weight bearing and there is no unevenness in the animal5s gait. • Other than the injectable sodium iodide, no other concomitant medications were administered to the patient o ver the course of treatment with Compound 1. Case Studies of difficult wounds not suited to current standards of care Case Study 9: Infectious vasculitis in the ear of a tree kangaroo (Marsupialia, Dendmlagm lumholtzi) Case notes: • The patient presented as a young injured animal found in the wild. • Patient was very weak, dehydrated and anaemic. Urine sample revealed blood and bacterial infection, likely septicaemia. Patient was placed on fluid therapy and medicated with anti-nausea drug maropifant citrate (eerenia) and two injectable antibiotic formulations Tribacteral {trimethoprim, sulfadiazine) and ceftazidime (fortum). • After 9 days on a fluid drip the patient’s condition had improved but there was trauma to the right ear and likely infectious vasculitis and gangrene. Surgery was not possible because of significant anaesthetic risk due to the patient’s highly compromised condition. Instead, treatment with a gel formulation of Compound 1 was initiated. • Three treatments of 0.1 inL of 5 ing/rnL strength Compound 1 gel were applied to the affected area at 7 day intervals. The only concurrent medication during this time was the cephalosporin antibiotics ceftazidime (fortum). • At 7 days after the first treatment of Compound 1 gel, a tightly adhering eschar covered the wound surface. This eschar lifted at 10 days to reveal a well-developed, pink granulation bed. • By the time of the third and final treatment application at 14 days after initial treatment the wound area had reduced by approximately 50% and at 25 days healthy tissue was present over the entire area of the wound. • At 67 days the lesion had totally resolved and there was Full hair coverage over the ear. Case Study 10: Severe lacerated wound on the head of a spectaeled flying fox (Mammalia, Ptempus compMUatus) Case notes: • The patient presented as a 4 month old flying fox with a deep penetrating wound on the head of a 4-month old flying fox caused by entanglement in barbed wire. • In the opinion of the treating veterinarian who had extensive experience in wildlife injuries (including flying foxes) normal standard of care treatments were likely to he highly problematic in causing the right eye to lose shape and not be able to close, either due to excessive scar tissue formation associated with surgery or the extent of granulation required if wound healing dressings were applied. • Compound 1 was applied to the wound in 3 applications of 0.1 mL of 5 mg/mL gel formulation over a 28 day period (Days 1, 10 and 28). No other ^concomitant medications or interventions were used during the course of treatment. • At .14 days after the initial treatment there was significant tissue infill and remodeling and by 28 days the eye was capable of fully closing. By 38 days an eschar covered the entire wound area and this began to slough at 49 days to reveal, a good granulation bed. * By 55 days after the initial treatment there was good tissue Infill over the entire area of the original wound and the right eye was returning to its original position. A very healthy granulation bed was present. Example 17; Resolution and cosmetic outcome of wounds generated following necrosis and sloughing of spontaneous tumours in companion animals treated with Compound 1 Veterinary clinical data on speed of resolution of wounds that formed .following necrosis and sloughing of spontaneous tumours that had been treated by intratumoural injection of Compound 1 (30% 1,2 propanediol formulation at either 0.5 or 1.0 mg/niL concentration) in twenty-four companion animals are summarised in Table 17. Note that all wounds were managed as open wounds and no bandaging, dressings, lotions or concomitant medications were used in any of these eases.
