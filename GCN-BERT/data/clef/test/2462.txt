Improvements in or relating to organic compounds This invention relates to perfume ingredients and perfume preparations containing same. In particular, the invention relates to said perfume ingredients or perfume preparations that exhibit muguet (lily of the valley) odour characteristics. Still more particularly, the invention relates to said perfume preparations that contain no, or substantially no, Lilial ™. The invention further relates to methods of making said perfume ingredients and perfume preparations, as well as the use of said perfume ingredients and perfume preparations in fine fragrances and consumer products, such as personal care and household care products. The invention also relates to said fine fragrances and consumer products containing said perfume ingredients or perfume preparations. Compounds having muguet odour characteristics are very sought after perfume ingredients. These compounds are important ingredients in floral bases and can act as harmonizers across many different types of fragrance creations. Compounds of this type are used widely in consumer products, such as personal care and consumer care products, as well as in fine perfumery, to generate pleasant odours or to mask unpleasant odours. An excellent perfume ingredient widely valued for its muguet odour note is Lilial ™. Lilial ™ is an example of an aryl-substituted alkanal, more particularly an aryl-substituted propanal. Specifically, its chemical name is 3-(4-tert-butylphenyl)-2-methylpropanal (CAS 80-54-6). This compound has found wide use in fine perfumery as well as in personal and household care products. However, its use has come under regulatory scrutiny in view of recent findings that it exhibits toxic effects on the reproductive organs of male rats and dogs. No effects were found in studies with mice, guinea-pigs and primates, nevertheless, under the Global Harmonized System (GHS) classification system this compound is classified as a CMR2 material. For CMR category 2 materials, it is necessary to establish that quantities proposed for use are harmless to consumers. In view of the regulatory situation of Lilial ™ there is a need to replace it with other perfume ingredients. W02010105 873 addresses the problem of replacing Lilial ™. The proposed solution resides in the use of mixtures of known ingredients commonly found in the perfumery palette in order to recreate odour characteristics substantially similar to those of Lilial ™. Likewise, W02009027957 proposes a solution residing in the formulation of combinations of known perfume ingredients from the perfumery palette. W02013045301 also propose a solution to Lilial ™ replacement, which resides in the selection of mixtures of ingredients including the compound Lilyflore ™ and a certain indanyl propanal compound, in combination with other secondary perfuming ingredients. The applicant has now found compounds that can be employed as perfume ingredients in perfume compositions and consumer products. More particularly, the applicant has found compounds that possess desirable muguet odour characteristics. Still more particularly, the applicant has found compounds that possess odour characteristics, which may be perceived and recognised by perfumers as being very reminiscent of the odour of Lilial ™ and so can serve as a simple replacement for Lilial ™. Furthermore, the compounds may have similar or even improved perfume performance compared with Lilial ™. Finally, the applicant has found compounds that do not attract the regulatory concerns associated with Lilial ™. In particular, the applicant has found that aryl-substituted alkanal perfume ingredients that are close structural analogues to Lilial ™ but which, critically, contain a substituent on the aryl ring, which is positioned ortho to the group bearing the aldehyde functionality, have similar odour characteristics as Lilial ™, but surprisingly carry with them none of the CMR-related issues associated with Lilial ™ as indicated by in vitro data. Accordingly, the invention provides in a first aspect an aryl-substituted alkanal compound having a molecular weight of less than 300 g/mol and which bears a substituent on the aryl ring ortho to a substituent bearing the aldehyde functionality, wherein said compound is not 5-(tert-butyl)-2-methyl-2,3-dihydro-lH-indene-2-carbaldehyde, 5-(tert-butyl)-2,3-dihydro-lH-indene-2-carbaldehyde, 5-isopropyl-2,3-dihydro-lH-indene-2-carbaldehyde, 5-isopropyl-2-methyl-2,3-dihydro-lH-indene-2-carbaldehyde, 5-ethyl-2,3-dihydro-lH-indene-2-carbaldehyde, 5-ethyl-2-methyl-2,3-dihydro-lH-indene-2-carbaldehyde, 5-methyl-2,3-dihydro-lH-indene-2-carbaldehyde, 2,5-dimethyl-2,3-dihydro-lH-indene-2-carbaldehyde,3-(5-(tert-butyl)-2-methylphenyl)propanal, 3-(5-(tert-butyl)-2-methylphenyl)-2-methylpropanal, 3-(5-isopropyl-2-methylphenyl)propanal, 3-(5-isopropyl-2-methylphenyl)-2-methylpropanal, 3-(5-ethyl-2-methylphenyl)propanal, 3-(5-ethyl-2-methylphenyl)-2-methylpropanal, 3-(4-(tert-butyl)-2-methylphenyl)propanal, 3-(4-(tert-butyl)-2-methylphenyl)-2-methylpropanal, 3-(4-isopropyl-2-methylphenyl)propanal, 3-(4-isopropyl-2-methylphenyl)-2-methylpropanal, 3-(4-ethyl-2-methylphenyl)propanal, 3-(4-ethyl-2-methylphenyl)-2-methylpropanal or any of the compounds of formula 3 set forth hereinbelow in which each of Ri through R5 is Η or methyl.

The compounds of the present invention possess substantially similar odour characteristics and performance characteristics as Lilial ™. As such, and in contradistinction to the prior art proposals related to Lilial ™ replacement based on mixtures of known ingredients, the present invention can achieve Lilial ™ replacement based on a single compound. This has the obvious advantage of representing a cost-effective solution to the replacement problem, but it is also makes the perfumers' creative process simpler. Furthermore, compounds of the present invention can generate particularly substantive and long-lasting muguet odour characteristics. The compounds of the present invention are particularly impactful perfume ingredients. The impact that a perfume ingredient exerts is related to its Odour Value. Odour Value is the ratio of vapour pressure to detection threshold concentration. The compounds have extremely high Odour Values. For example, the compound O has an Odour Value of 559O71. Related perfume ingredients are not impactful by comparison. For example Lilial ™ has an odour value of only 32'978 whereas cyclamen aldehyde has an Odour Value of only 21/986. The remarkably high Odour Value of the compounds of the present invention is significant in that there is a need for sustainability and the provision of impactful perfume ingredients enables perfumers to create desirable fragrance accords with lower concentrations of materials. The regulatory issues surrounding Lilial ™ are born from the fact that it is enzymatically degraded in rats and dogs to tert-butyl benzoic acid (t-BBA), which is known to inhibit glucose synthesis and fatty acid synthesis in vitro (McCune et al, Arch Biochem Biophys (1982) 214 (1): 124-133). tert-Butyl benzoic acid is known to cause testicular effects in male rats (Hunter et al. Food Cosmet. Toxicol. 1965, 3: 289-298; Cagen et al. J. Am. Coll. Toxicol. 1989, 8 (5): 1027-1038). In contrast, the compounds of the present invention are not susceptible to enzyme-mediated degradation to corresponding benzoic acid derivatives in vitro. This was indeed a very surprising result considering their close structural similarity to Lilial ™. The applicant's surprising discovery that aryl-substituted alkanal perfume ingredients substituted on the ring at a position ortho to the group bearing the aldehyde functionality are not converted to their corresponding benzoic acid derivatives, provides an insight not heretofore appreciated in the art, which enables perfumers to employ a class of compounds that although being structurally similar to Lilial ™ (and therefore possessing remarkably similar olfactive properties as these compounds), nevertheless do not raise regulatory issues. In order to study in vitro metabolism in rat hepatocytes, Lilial ™ and compounds of the present invention may be incubated in the presence of rat hepatocytes in suspension. Reduction in the concentration of Lilial ™ and the compounds of the present invention and formation of any of the corresponding benzoic acid derivatives may be analysed by GC-MS. In another aspect of the present invention there is provided a compound as herein above defined, which after incubation with hepatocytes isolated from rats, is substantially free of its corresponding benzoic acid degradation product. By "substantially free" is meant that if it is present it is below levels of detection, e.g. less than 1 %, more particularly less than 1 % to 0 %. As such, compounds of the present invention provide perfumers with an eminently suitable surrogate for the 5 valuable yet problematic Lilial ™. Accordingly, the invention provides in another of its aspects the use of a compound defined hereinabove as a perfume ingredient. The invention provides in another of its aspects the use of a compound defined hereinabove in a perfume composition as a replacement for aryl-substituted ΐο alkanal odourants, more particularly aryl-substituted propanal odourants, which are unsubstituted on the aryl ring at a position ortho to the substituent bearing the aldehyde functionality, in particular Lilial ™. In another aspect of the invention there is provide a method of imparting a muguet odour characteristic to a perfume composition, said method comprising the is step of incorporating a compound defined hereinabove into said perfume composition. In yet another aspect of the invention there is provided a perfume composition comprising a compound defined hereinabove. In yet another aspect of the invention there is provided a perfume composition 20 possessing muguet odour characteristics comprising a compound defined hereinabove. In yet another aspect of the present invention there is provided a perfume composition comprising a compound defined hereinabove that is free of any aryl-substituted alkanal odourants, more particularly aryl-substituted propanal odourants, which are unsubstituted on the aryl ring at a position ortho to the substituent bearing the aldehyde functionality, in particular Lilial ™. A perfume composition according to the present invention can be made up entirely by one or more of the compounds of the present invention. However, a perfume composition may also contain, in addition to one or more of the compounds of present invention, one or more additional perfume ingredients. Compounds of the present invention may be present in a perfume composition in any amount depending on the particular olfactive effect that a perfumer wishes to achieve. In a particular embodiment of the present invention, a perfume composition of the present invention may contain compounds defined hereinabove in an amount of 0.1 to 100 % by weight of said composition. If one or more additional perfume ingredients are employed, they may be selected from perfume ingredients known in the art. In particular, said perfume ingredients that may be employed in a perfume composition according to the invention include 6-methoxy-2,6-dimethylheptan-l-al (methoxymelonal), 5,9-dimethyl-4,8-decadienal (geraldehyde), beta-methyl-3-(lmethylethyl)benzenepropanal (Florhydral), octahydro-8,8-dimethylnaphthalene-2-carbaldehyde (Cyclomyral), alpha-methyl-1,3-benzodioxole-5-propionaldehyde (helional), 5-methyl-2-(l-methylbutyl)-5-propyl-l,3-dioxan (Troenan), 3-(ο-ethylphenyl)-2,2-dimethylpropionaldehyde (Floralozone), farnesol, 3,7,11-trimethyldodeca-l,6,10-trien-3-ol, optionally as an isomeric mixture (nerolidol), 2-methyl-4-phenylbutan-2-ol (dimethylphenylethylcarbinol), cis-4-(isopropyl)cyclohexanemethanol (Mayol), l-(l-hydroxyethyl)-4-(lmethylethyl)cyclohexane (optionally as a mixture of the diastereoisomers) (mugetanol), (4-methyl-3-pentenyl)cyclohexenecarbaldehyde (Citrusal), cyclohexyl salicylate, hexyl salicylate, benzyl salicylate, amyl salicylate, 3-(ρ-(2-methylpropyl)phenyl)-2-methylpropionaldehyde (Silvial), 3-p-cumenyl-2-methylpropionaldehyde (cyclamenaldehyde), mixtures of: cis-tetrahydro-2-isobutyl-4-methylpyran-4-ol; trans-tetrahydro-2-isobutyl-4-methylpyran-4-ol; (Floral), triethyl citrate and dipropylene glycol.

A perfume composition need not be limited to the perfume ingredients listed above. Other perfume ingredients commonly used in perfumery may be employed, for example any of those ingredients described in "Perfume and Flavour Chemicals", S. Arctander, Allured Publishing Corporation, 1994, IL, USA, which is incorporated herein by reference, including essential oils, plant extracts, absolutes, resinoids, odourants obtained from natural products and the like. The perfume ingredients contained in said perfume composition are described above, but of course, the perfume composition may not be limited to the stated ingredients. In particular, perfume mixtures may comprise adjuvants that are commonly employed in perfume formulations. The term "adjuvants" refers to an ingredient that might be employed in a perfume composition for reasons other than, or not specifically, related to the composition's olfactive performance. For example, an adjuvant may be an ingredient that acts as an aid to processing a perfume ingredient or ingredients, or a composition containing said ingredient(s), or it may improve handling or storage of a perfume ingredient or composition containing same. It might also be an ingredient that provides additional benefits such as imparting colour or texture. It might also be an ingredient that imparts light resistance or chemical stability to one or more ingredients contained in a perfume ingredient or composition containing same. A detailed description of the nature and type of adjuvants commonly used in perfume mixture or compositions containing same cannot be exhaustive, but it has to be mentioned that said ingredients are well known to a person skilled in the art. Examples of adjuvants include solvents and co-solvents; surfactants and emulsifiers; viscosity and rheology modifiers; thickening and gelling agents; preservative materials; pigments, dyestuffs and colouring matters; extenders, fillers and reinforcing agents; stabilisers against the detrimental effects of heat and light, bulking agents, acidulants, buffering agents and antioxidants. Furthermore, any one or more of the perfume ingredients or adjuvants employed in the present invention might be formulated in a delivery vehicle if desired to provide a desired effect. Delivery vehicles may include encapsulates. Alternatively, a delivery vehicle may be in the form of a solid support, e.g. a polymeric support material onto which one or more perfume ingredients or adjuvants may be chemically or physically bound. Still further, one or more perfume ingredients or adjuvants may be dissolved or dispersed in a matrix material, which serves to control the rate at which said ingredient or ingredients emanates therefrom. In yet an alternative embodiment, one or more ingredients or adjuvants may be supported on a porous substrate, such as a cyclodextrin or a zeolite or other inorganic material. In a still further embodiment, one or more perfume ingredients may be provided in the form of a pro-perfume, which will react in a suitable environment to release the perfume ingredient in a controlled manner. Having regard to the foregoing, it will be appreciated that a perfume composition may be at least partly in solid form, in gel form, in foam form and/or liquid form. If it is present in solid form, it then it may take the form of granules, powders or tablets. The present invention provides in another of its aspects a fine fragrance or consumer product, such as a personal care or household care composition that is perfumed by an aryl-substituted alkanal compound having a molecular weight of less than 300 g/mol and which bears a substituent on the aryl ring ortho to a substituent bearing the aldehyde functionality.

A comparison of compounds of the present invention and Lilial ™. Cryopreserved hepatocytes from male rats (Sprague Dawley; Lifetechnologies) were defrozen, washed in Cyropreserved Hepatocytes Recovery Medium (CHRM; Lifetechnologies) and suspended in Williams Ε Medium (WEM; Lifetechnologies). Lilial™, or the compounds of the present invention (final concentration: 100 μΜ) were added to the cells (1 χ 106 viable cells/ml) and suspensions were incubated up to 4 hours at 37°C on a shaker in duplicate. Metabolism of testosterone was monitored as positive control. Decrease of the test compounds and formation of the corresponding benzoic acid derivative was determined by GC-MS analysis of methyl esters formed after derivatisation with trimethylsilyl diazomethane (Sigma-Aldrich) in methanol. The test compounds react with diazomethane yielding a methyl ketone which was used for the quantification of Lilial ™ and the compound of formula (I). Metabolism was stopped with ice cold 1 Μ HCI, samples were extracted with tert-butyl methyl ether (ΜΤΒΕ) and analysed by GC-MS. Incubations containing testosterone as control were also stopped with ice cold 1 Μ HCI, centrifuged to separate the cells, filtrated and the decrease of testosterone analysed by LC-MS. To quantify decrease of the test substances and formation of benzoic acid metabolites, calibration curves of reference materials (Lilial ™ and the compounds of the present invention, tert-butyl benzoic acid (Fluka) was prepared in hepatocyte incubation medium and analysed like the hepatocyte samples. A rapid decrease of testosterone as positive control was observed indicating that the hepatocytes were metabolically active. The compounds of the present invention and Lilial ™ were metabolised rapidly in rat hepatocytes and no residual compound except for 2% with one compound was measured after 4 h. Whereas tert-butyl benzoic acid was detected as metabolite of Lilial ™ (3.4-3.9 μΜ) no benzoic acid derivatives were formed from compounds of the present invention (Table 1). Limit of detection was <1 μΜ. Table 1 (below), shows the concentrations of Lilial ™ and compounds of the present invention as well as corresponding benzoic acid metabolites in rat hepatocytes within 4 hours incubation. Initial test concentration at 0 hours incubation was 100 μΜ. It is clear from the data presented in Table 1 that the ortho substituent at the benzene ring of the compounds of the present invention prevents the formation of the corresponding benzoic acid derivative in vitro. Since benzoic acid derivatives such as tert-butyl benzoic acid from Lilial ™ cause reproductive toxicity in male rats, these toxic effects in male rats are prevented by the ortho-substituent of the compounds of the present invention. 1.
