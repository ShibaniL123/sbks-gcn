CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims the priority of Taiwan Patent Application No. 100136951, filed on Oct. 12, 2011. This invention is partly disclosed in a published article by Ke-Hsuan Wang, Mei-Jywan Syu, Chien-Hsiang Chang, and Yuh-Lang Lee, “Headgroup Effects of Template Monolayers on the Adsorption Behavior and Conformation of Glucose Oxidase Adsorbed at Air/Liquid Interfaces” published in Langmuir 2011, vol. 27, p. 7595-7602. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a method for changing conformation of globular proteins, and more particularly to a method for changing conformation of a protein monolayer of globular proteins by controlling a concentration of the globular proteins and an adsorption time of the globular proteins from an aqueous solution to an air/liquid interface. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Nowadays, the study of biomolecules has become a popular research topic, and people pay more and more attention to the development and manufacture of biomolecular devices. Among various biomolecules, proteins are the main components of living organisms and also the basic substance that life activities rely on. Therefore, it is important to study three dimensional structures of protein molecules and their functions, in order to develop bioengineering. Protein molecules consist of polypeptides of amino acids which are linked together by covalent and non-covalent bonds to form three-dimensional structures with the lowest energy, stable molecular structures and specific physiological functions. When the environment changed, protein molecules generally adjust their three dimensional structures to maintain energy balances and theirs physiological functions. In an irreversible case, protein molecules, which are subjected to physical or chemical treatment, will loss the regulation of three dimensional structures and theirs physiological functions, wherein this phenomenon is called “protein denaturation”. Therefore, if fundamental physiologic functions of protein molecules can be kept and a plurality of three dimensional structures of protein molecules can be obtained, it will be helpful to execute various experiments or applications for physiologic functions of protein molecules. For examples, detection biochips are always constructed by immobilizing specific three dimensional structures (such as α-helix or β-sheet) of proteins onto a detection area thereon, in order to provide effective detecting functions. Therefore, it is necessary to obtain proteins with desired three dimensional structures for a large scale of production application. The conventional techniques of changing protein conformation generally change protein conformation by physical/chemical treatments, such as acidic solution, basic solution, urea solution, organic solvent, heavy metal, heat, pressure, ultraviolet light, ultrasound and/or X-ray etc. However, in the processes of these physical/chemical treatments, if the conditions of these treatments are not suitably controlled, protein molecules will be irreversibly denatured, and thus loss the regulations of three dimensional structures and theirs physiological functions. Moreover, for manufacture cost, it needs considerable cost of machines or solvents for using physical/chemical reagents which are also harmful to the environment or humans. As a result, it is necessary to provide a method for changing conformation of globular proteins to solve the problems existing in the conventional technologies, as described above. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION A primary object of the present invention is to provide a method for changing conformation of globular proteins, which controls the concentration of the globular proteins and the adsorption time of the globular proteins from the aqueous solution to the air/liquid interface, so that the main conformation of the globular proteins in a protein monolayer can be changed into β-sheet or α-helix. Meanwhile, the protein monolayer having the conformation of β-sheet or α-helix can be vertically deposited and transferred onto a substrate for various applications according to needs. Thus, the present invention can change three-dimensional structures of biological molecules and remain original functions thereof without additionally using any physical/chemical treatment to change the conformation of the globular proteins.

Referring now to FIG. 1, a method for changing conformation of a globular proteins according to a first embodiment of the present invention is illustrated. As shown, the method comprises steps of: preparing a globular protein (label 10 in FIGS. 1 and 3); mixing the globular protein with water to form a mixture solution (label 20 in FIGS. 1 and 3); allowing the mixture solution to stand for a first adsorption time, so that the globular protein in the mixture solution is adsorbed onto an air/liquid interface (label 21 in FIGS. 1 and 3 of the mixture solution to form a protein monolayer (label 30 in FIGS. 1 and 3), wherein the protein monolayer has a fast surface pressure and the conformation of the protein monolayer is mainly β-sheet; and allowing the mixture solution to stand for a second adsorption time, so that the protein monolayer has a second surface pressure and the conformation of the protein monolayer is converted into α-helix, wherein the second surface pressure is higher than the first surface pressure. The content and principle of all steps of the present invention are described in details with FIG. 1 to FIG. 6 hereinafter. First, the method for changing conformation of globular protein according to the first embodiment of the present invention is to provide a globular protein (label 10 in FIGS. 1 and 3). In the present invention, the globular protein is selected from glucose oxidase (GOx), bovine serum albumin (BSA), haemoglobin, immunoglobulin, myoglobin, cytoglobin, flavohaemoglobins, protoglobin, cyanoglobin, ferritin, phospholipase C, concanavalin A, chymotrypsin, insulin, pancreatic trypsin inhibitor, lysozyme, fibrinogen, RNase A, alcohol dehydrogenase, hexokinase and phosphorylase. For examples, in the first embodiment of the present invention, the globular protein is glucose oxidase (GOx). Next, referring to FIG. 1, the method for changing conformation of globular protein according to the first embodiment of the present invention is to mix the globular protein with water forming a mixture solution (label 20 in FIGS. 1 and 3). In this step, the concentration of the globular protein in the mixture solution is depended on the type of globular protein. For examples, in the first embodiment of the present invention, if the globular protein is glucose oxidase (GOx), the concentration of the globular protein in the mixture solution is between 4.98 mg/L and 19.92 mg/L. For example, the concentration is preferably 9.96 mg/L, but not limited thereto. Then, referring to FIGS. 1 and 2, the method for changing conformation of globular protein according to the first embodiment of the present invention is to allow the mixture solution to stand for a first adsorption time, so that the globular protein in the mixture solution is adsorbed onto the air/liquid interface of the mixture solution to form the protein monolayer 30, wherein the protein monolayer has a first surface pressure and the conformation of the protein monolayer is mainly β-sheet. In the embodiment of the present invention, the mixture solution is filled into a container, and a surface pressure measuring device (label 40 in FIGS. 1 and 3) is used to detect a surface pressure of the air/liquid interface, wherein a liquid surface layer of the mixture solution is defined as the air/liquid interface which is an interface of the mixture solution in contact with to the atmosphere. Furthermore, the container can be a tank of Langmuir Film Balance, but is not limited thereto. For example, it also can be a simple water tank. After allowing the mixture solution to stand for the first adsorption time, the globular protein of the mixture solution gradually adsorbs to the air/liquid interface of the mixture solution to form the protein monolayer. Simultaneously the present invention uses the surface pressure measuring device to detect the variation of surface pressure of the protein monolayer according to the adsorption time, wherein the surface pressure measuring device is connected to a computer system (not shown) for continually recording the statistic values of the variation of the surface pressure with time, so as to draw a surface pressure/time diagram as shown in FIG. 2. Referring to FIG. 2, if the globular protein is glucose oxidase (GOx), as described above, the first adsorption time is any time point within 0.5 hour to 4 hours after starting to allow the mixture solution to stand for the first adsorption time, such as the time point of 0.5 hour after starting, as shown in FIG. 2. Within the period of the first adsorption time (i.e. 0.5 hours to 4 hours after starting), the surface pressure of the protein monolayer achieves to a stage of nearly balance, wherein the surface pressure maintains to approach a first surface pressure which is between about 6 mN/m and about 8 mN/m, such as 7.5 mN/m. At this time, the globular protein of the mixture solution is adsorbed to the air/liquid interface of the mixture solution, so as to form the protein monolayer which is mainly β-sheet. Referring to FIG. 3, in order to detect a measured α-helix/β-sheet ratio of the protein monolayer during the period of the first adsorption time, the method of the present invention comprises a step of vertically depositing and transferring the protein monolayer of the air/liquid interface onto a first substrate (label 50 in FIGS. 3 and 4). In the embodiment of the present invention, the first substrate is a substrate for detecting/analyzing, such as a quartz (glass) plate. The present invention executes the vertical depositions 100 times to transfer 100 layers of the protein monolayer onto the first substrate (the transfer rates are at 1 and 150 mm/min in the downward/upward directions, respectively). And then, the secondary structure of the protein monolayer is examined by circular dichroism (CD). Results are listed in Table 1, as follows: TABLE 1 conformation comparison of glucose oxidase (GOx) at different absorption time. Absorption time (hr) α-helix β-sheet α/β 0.5 4.23 46.99 0.090 8 54.84 6.03 9.095 Referring to Table 1, the measured α-helix/β-sheet ratio of the protein monolayer is equal to (or smaller than) 0.09 at the first adsorption time and the conformation of the protein monolayer is mainly β-sheet. Moreover, the protein monolayer is deposited and transferred onto the first substrate, wherein the numbers of deposited layers is according to needs of application. Beside of a substrate for detecting/analyzing, the first substrate also can be a biochip substrate or a sensor substrate; the material of the first substrate is not limited to quartz substrate, and also can be a platinum substrate, a rigid transparent plastic substrate or a flexible transparent plastic substrate, but not limited thereto. Finally, refer to FIGS. 1, 2, 3, and Table 1, the method for changing conformation of a globular proteins according to the first embodiment of the present invention is to allow the mixture solution to stand for a second adsorption time, so that the globular protein in the mixture solution are adsorbed onto the air/liquid interface of the mixture solution to forming the protein monolayer, wherein the protein monolayer has a second surface pressure and the conformation of the protein monolayer is mainly α-helix, wherein the second surface pressure is higher than the first surface pressure. In the embodiment of the present invention, the second adsorption time is any time point from 8 to more hours after starting to allows the mixture solution to stand for the first adsorption time, such as the time point of 8 hours after starting, as shown in FIG. 2. Within the period from the first adsorption time to the second adsorption time (i.e. from 4.5 hours to 7.5 hours after starting), the surface pressure of the protein monolayer is changed and increased by time. Next, within the period of the second adsorption time (8 hours or more after starting), the surface pressure of the protein monolayer achieves to another stage of nearly balance, and the surface pressure maintains around a second surface pressure which is between about 14 mN/m and about 16 mN/m, such as around 15.5 mN/m. At the second adsorption time, the conformation of the protein monolayer is mainly α-helix, and the measured α-helix/β-sheet ratio of the protein monolayer is equal to (or larger than) 9.095, i.e. the conformation is mainly α-helix. In the present and forward steps, the globular protein is large complex molecules constructed by different types of amino acids, so the globular protein shows asymmetric distributions of hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties, wherein the globular protein can adsorbe to the air/liquid interface to form the protein monolayer spontaneously according to the hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties thereof. And, the molecular conformation of the globular protein can be converted to provide different molecular conformations according to hydrophilic and hydrophobic phases of the air/liquid interface, and these different molecular conformations of the globular protein can be applied to various applications. For examples, in the present step, similar to the forward step, the protein monolayer can be vertically deposited and transferred onto a second substrate (label 50′ in FIG. 4), wherein the numbers of deposited layers are according to needs of application. The second substrate is similarly selected from a biochip substrate, a sensor substrate and a substrate for detecting/analyzing; and the material of the second substrate can be selected from a quartz substrate, a platinum substrate, a rigid transparent plastic substrate and a flexible transparent plastic substrate, but not limited thereto. Moreover, refer to FIGS. 4 and 5, the first embodiment of the present invention provides the first substrate vertically deposited with the protein monolayer at the first adsorption time (the first adsorption time of 0.5 hours, the measured α-helix/β-sheet ratio is equal to or smaller than 0.09); or the second substrate vertically deposited with the protein monolayer at the second adsorption time (the second adsorption time is 8 hours, the measured α-helix/β-sheet ratio is equal to or larger than 9.095), wherein the first substrate and the second substrate can be used as a working electrode. Simultaneously, a platinum plate is used as a counter electrode (label 61 in FIG. 4) and an Ag/AgCl plate is used as a reference electrode (label 62 in FIG. 4). Then, these three electrodes are immersed into a glucose solution (label 70 in FIG. 4. The globular protein (i.e. GOx) of the protein monolayer on the first substrate (or the second substrate) catalyzes and converts the glucose solution (0.5 mM) into gluconic acid and H2O2, wherein this reaction is detected by chronoamperometry, and a constant potential (0.6V to Ag/AgCl electrode) is applied to the glucose solution to detect current variation of H2O2 generation, then the current/time diagram is shown in FIG. 5. As shown in the current variation of FIG. 5, regardless of the conformations (β-sheet or α-helix), the globular protein on the surface of the first substrate (adsorption time is 0.5 hours) or the second substrate (adsorption time is 8 hours), the conformations can maintain original physiological functions of enzyme proteins.
