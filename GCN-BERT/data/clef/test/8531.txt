AIRFLOW INDICATOR ASSEMBLY AND METHOD FOR VACUUM CLEANER FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE [0001] The present disclosure relates generally to vacuum cleaners and, more specifically, to an airflow indicator for a vacuum cleaner. BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE [0002] Vacuum appliances, such as wet/dry vacuums are well known for use in collecting debris or other material. Conventional wet/dry vacuums typically include a tank mounted on wheels or casters, and a lid having a housing with a motor and impeller assembly attached thereto. The motor and impeller assembly create suction within the tank, which draws debris and/or liquid into the tank via an air inlet to which a flexible hose may be attached. A bag and/or filter within the tank typically prevents incoming debris from escaping, while allowing filtered air to pass to the impeller and escape through an exhaust outlet disposed on a portion of the tank or the lid, for example. [0003] As debris or material collects on the bag or filter, however, the performance of the vacuum decreases. More specifically, small particles of dust or debris block the pores in the bag or filter and less air is able to pass through the bag or filter and, therefore, less air is pulled through the inlet and able to escape through the exhaust outlet. Thus, as the bag or filter becomes dirtier, the performance of the vacuum decreases. [0004] Various indicators have been used in the past to measure the airflow characteristics or pressure within the vacuum cleaner as a way to gauge the airflow through the bag or filter and thus the need to change or clean it. Many of those indicators are expensive to manufacture and/or are subject to malfunction. As a result, there is a need for a low-cost, reliable device to determine whether there is a need to change or clean the bag or filter. SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE [0005] In one example, a vacuum cleaner comprising an airflow outlet and an airflow indicator assembly removably disposed at the outlet is disclosed. The airflow indicator assembly includes a pair of fins attached to a spine, and a needle disposed between the pair of fins. During operation of the vacuum cleaner, exhaust air is directed through the outlet towards the needle, pushing the needle thereby indicating whether service is needed. [0006] In another example, an airflow indicator assembly adapted to be disposed at an airflow outlet of a vacuum cleaner is disclosed. The airflow indicator assembly includes a spine, a pair of fins attached to the spine, and a needle disposed between the pair of fins. During operation of the vacuum cleaner, exhaust air is directed through the airflow outlet and towards the needle, pushing the needle thereby indicating whether service is needed. [0007] In yet another example, a cap assembly for an airflow outlet of a vacuum cleaner is disclosed. The cap assembly includes a cap having a front end with at least one aperture and an airflow indicator assembly attached to the front end of the cap. The airflow indicator assembly includes a pair of fins attached to a spine, and a needle disposed between the pair of fins. During operation of the vacuum cleaner, exhaust air is directed through the airflow outlet towards the needle, pushing the needle indicating whether service is needed. [0008] In yet another example, a method of manufacturing an airflow indicator assembly is disclosed. The method includes disposing a needle between a pair of fins attached to a spine and folding each fin of the pair of fins towards each other about at least one hinge disposed between the spine and at least one fin. The method further includes attaching the fins to each other via at least one attachment mechanism.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DISCLOSURE [0017] Referring now to Figs. 1-3, a vacuum cleaner 20 constructed in accordance with the teachings of the present disclosure is generally depicted. The vacuum cleaner 20 includes a tank 22 having a side wall 24 with an upper portion 25, a base 26 and a closed bottom 27. The tank 22 further includes an inlet 28 (Fig. 2) that is adapted to receive a hose (not shown). The tank 22 is enclosed by a removable lid assembly 30 that may include an outlet 32. The outlet 32 is adapted to receive a hose (not shown) like the inlet 28, enabling the hose to be used in both vacuuming and blowing capacities. More specifically, air drawn into the tank 22 through the inlet 28 may be directed through the outlet 32, e.g., the exhaust outlet 32. The lid assembly 30 houses a motor/impeller unit 33 (Fig. 3), which can be energized upon actuation of a switch 35. In addition, a plurality of casters 34 or other wheels may be attached to the tank 22 to facilitate movement of the vacuum cleaner about a worksite, for example. [0018] In the present example, the tank 22 is generally cylindrical, the lid assembly 30 is correspondingly shaped, and both are manufactured from molded plastic. One of ordinary skill in the art will also appreciate that the tank 22 and lid assembly 30 may be alternatively shaped and manufactured from other materials and processes and still fall within the scope of the present disclosure. [0019] As further illustrated in Figs. 1 and 2, an airflow indicator assembly 36 according to the present disclosure is disposed at the outlet 32, as described in greater detail below. Generally, the airflow indicator assembly 36 provides an indication to a user of the vacuum cleaner 20 of whether air flow through the tank 22 is compromised based on the level of air flow through the outlet 32. In other words, if the air flow through the outlet 32 is reduced, service to the vacuum cleaner 20 is likely needed. Such service may include replacing a dirty or overused filter or vacuum bag or clearing a blockage in a hose, wand or accessory attached to the inlet 28, for example. [0020] Referring now to Fig. 3, a cross-sectional view of the vacuum cleaner 20 taken along the line Α-Α of Fig. 2 is depicted. The motor/impeller unit 33 includes a motor 38 from which a rotatable shaft 40 extends. A vacuum impeller 42 is mounted to the shaft 40 for rotation within a vacuum chamber for generation of a low pressure area within the tank 22 for vacuuming purposes. A filter 35 may be attached to a lid cage 37 housing a float 39. The impeller 42 draws air through the filter 35, which removes particulate and other material from the air before it passes to the impeller 42. A vacuum bag (not shown) may be attached to an inlet fitting 41, so that material entering the inlet 28 is contained within the bag. The vacuum cleaner 20 can be used to vacuum wet materials, in which case a bag is generally not used with the tank 22, and wet material gathered by the vacuum cleaner 20 is deposited directly within the tank 22. When vacuuming dry material the vacuum cleaner 20 may be used with a bag, a filter or with both. Bags and filters are generally made of porous material such as a paper or various types of cloth and may become clogged with dirt and dust as they are used, thereby reducing airflow through the vacuum cleaner 20 and reducing its performance. [0021] As illustrated in Figs. 3 and 4, the airflow indicator assembly 36 is disposed at the outlet 32. The airflow indicator assembly 36 is attached to a cap 44, which in this instance is a cylindrical body having a front end 46 with at least one aperture 48 and a rear end 47. The rear end 47 may include internal threads (not shown) that engage corresponding threads disposed on an internal surface of the outlet 32 (not shown) to removably secure the cap 44 and airflow indicator assembly 36 to the vacuum 20. The rear end 47 of the cap 44 may be alternatively press fit or snapped into the outlet 32 to secure the cap 44 and the airflow indicator assembly 36 attached thereto to the vacuum cleaner 20, and different shapes may be used for the cap 44 depending on the shape of the outlet 32. A pair of fins 50 is attached to a spine 49 (Fig. 6), which is connected to the front end 46 of the cap 44, as explained in more detail below. A strap 52 extending from the spine 49 is removably attached to a portion of the lid assembly 30 or the upper portion 25 of the sidewall 24 of the tank 22, as also explained in more detail below. The strap 52 secures the cap 44 and airflow indicator assembly 36 to the vacuum cleaner 20 when the cap is removed from the outlet 32, for instance, when a user wants to attach a hose to the outlet for use of the vacuum 20 as a blower. [0022] While the airflow indicator assembly 36 is attached to the cap 44, in one example, the cap 44 and the airflow indicator assembly 36 attached thereto may form a cap assembly 69 (Fig. 5) that is adapted to be attached to the airflow outlet 32 of the vacuum cleaner 20. More specifically, threads of the cap 44 may engage internal threads on the airflow outlet 32 to attach the cap assembly 31 to the airflow outlet 32. In addition, the strap 52 may secure the cap assembly 31, which includes the cap 44 and the airflow indicator assembly 36 attached thereto in this example, to the vacuum cleaner 20 when the cap 44 is removed from the outlet 32, as explained in more detail below. In one example, the cap 44 comprises a cylindrical body. However, as one of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate, different shapes may be used for the cap depending on the shape of the outlet 32, for example. More specifically, while depicted as cylindrical in shape, the cap 44 may alternatively be partially cylindrical or take the form of another shape, such as a semi-circle, a tapered square or a tapered rectangle and still fall within the scope of the present disclosure. [0023] Referring now to Figs. 5 and 6, assembled and exploded views, respectively, of the airflow indicator assembly 36 of the present disclosure are depicted. As further illustrated therein, the airflow indicator assembly 36 may be attached, either removably or permanently to the cap 44 by a boss 55 (Fig. 6) with the front end 46 of the cap 44 having at least one aperture 48. The spine 49 is attached to the front end 46. More specifically, the boss 55 may be inserted into a center C of the front end 46 of the cap 44. The spine 49 has several apertures 57a-e, which permit air flowing through the apertures 48 of the cap 44 to flow through the spine 49 and thereafter contact a needle 56 to move the needle 56. The apertures 57a-e of the spine 49 are sized in conjunction with the width of the needle 56 so that the needle 56 will fall in the right area when there is good or poor air flow, as explained more below. For example, the width of the apertures 57a-57e is essentially the same as the width of the needle 56. At least one fin 51 of the pair of fins 50 has an outside surface 63 (Fig. 5) with a service needed area 54 (Fig. 5). The needle 56 is pivotably disposed between the pair of fins 50, such that, during operation of the vacuum cleaner 20, air is directed through the at least one aperture 48 of the cap 44, through the apertures 57a-e and into the pair of fins 50, pushing the needle 56 one of beyond or into the service needed area 54. [0024] More specifically, during operation of the vacuum cleaner 20, when exhaust air or air flowing through the cap 44 is low, there is not sufficient airflow to push the needle 56 up against the force of gravity so that it is out of the service needed area 54, as depicted in Fig. 5, for example. In a similar manner, when the air flowing through the cap 44 is high, the needle 56 is pushed beyond the service needed area 54 and into a second area 65 disposed adjacent to the service needed area 54, thereby indicating service is not needed. [0025] As illustrated in Fig. 5, the service needed area 54 may include a red area R, such that when the needle 56 points to or drops down to this area, service is needed. Alternatively, a crossed-out filter graphic (Fig. 8) or any other similar symbol may be used in the service needed area 54 to illustrate a reduced level of air is flowing through the vacuum cleaner 20. The outside surface 63 of each fin 51 may also include the second area 65 that is adjacent to the service needed area 54 and includes a green area G, such that when the needle 56 is pushed or points to this area, service is not needed. In a similar manner, instead of the green area G, a filter graphic that is not crossed-out (Fig. 8) or any other similar symbol may alternatively be used in the second area 65 adjacent to the service needed area 54 to illustrate the air is properly flowing therethrough and service is not needed. Still further, in other examples, the outside surface 63 may further include a third area disposed between the service needed area 54 and second area 55. The third area may include a yellow color Υ indicating service may soon be needed. [0026] As illustrated in Fig. 6, for example, each fin 51 of the pair of fins 50 includes a top portion 60, and the airflow indicator assembly 36 further includes a pivot axle 62 disposed between the pair of fins 50 at the top portion 60 of each fin 51 when the fins 51 are folded together. In one example, the pivot axle 62 is disposed on the fin 51 disposed right of center of the spine 49 before the fins 51 are folded together, as depicted in Fig. 6. In addition, the needle 56 includes a first end 64, a second end 66 disposed opposite the first end 64, and an aperture 68 for receiving the pivot axle 62. The needle 56 pivots upward about the pivot axle 62 with an increase in air flow through the outlet 32. An absence or a reduced level of air flow through the outlet 32, along with gravity, causes the needle 56 to drop down to a vertical position (Fig. 5) and into or point to the service needed area 54 (Fig. 5). In other words, the needle 56 pivots downward about the pivot axle 62 with a decrease in air flow through the outlet 32. [0027] Still referring to Fig. 6, an exploded view of the airflow indicator assembly 36 is depicted, which illustrates how the airflow indicator assembly 36 is molded, for example. More specifically, the fins 51 are connected to the spine 49 by at least one hinge 59. For example, and as depicted in Fig. 6, there is one hinge 59 disposed between the spine 49 and the fin 51 that is left of the spine 49. In addition, there is another hinge 59 disposed between the spine 49 and the fin 51 that is right of the spine 49. [0028] In addition, the fins 51 also include at least one attachment mechanism to attach the fins 51 to each other when the fins 51 are folded toward each other about the hinge 59. More specifically, and as depicted in Fig. 6, the at least one attachment mechanism includes a post 53a having a snap 53b. The post 53a is disposed on an inside surface of one fin 51. The at least one attachment mechanism further includes an aperture 55 that is disposed on an inside surface of the other fin 51. The aperture 55 is aligned with the post 53a when the fins 51 are folded together. As such, when the fins 51 are folded together about the hinge 59, the post 53a and snap 53b fit into the aperture 55, and the fins 51 are snapped together to sandwich the needle 56. [0029] In another example, the at least one attachment mechanism may include a plurality of attachment mechanisms, such as two, three or more, which further snap and secure the fins 51 together when folded about the hinges 59. For example, and as also depicted in Fig. 6, one attachment mechanism may be disposed on a top portion, a central portion, and a bottom portion of the inside surface of each fin 51. Said another way, one fin 51 may include a post 53a at top, central and bottom portions of the inside surface of the fin 51 that are aligned with an aperture 55 disposed at each of the top, central and bottom portions of the inside surface of the other fin 51. Upon folding the fins 51 together about the hinge 59, each post 53a and snap 53b snaps into the corresponding aperture 55 to sandwich the needle 56. In another example, the posts 53a with the snaps 53b and apertures 55 may be melted together to make the attachment of the fins 51 to each other permanent. [0030] In view of the foregoing, one of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the air indicator assembly 36 includes essentially only two molded parts. As a result, the air indicator assembly 36 is very inexpensive to make. [0031] As further illustrated in Figs. 6 and 7, the airflow indicator assembly 36 may further include a spacer 67 disposed on a bottom portion of one of the two fins 51. In one example, the spacer 67 is disposed on the bottom portion of the fin 51 that is right of center of the spine 49. When the fins 51 are folded towards each other, the spacer 67 prevents the inside surfaces of the fins 51 from contacting each other (Fig. 7) and potentially interfering with the operation of the needle 56. While the spacer 67 is disposed on the fin 51 that is right of the spine 49 in Fig. 6, a person having ordinary skill in the art will understand that the spacer 67 may alternatively be disposed on the bottom portion of the other fin 51 that is left of the spine 49 and still fall within the scope of the present disclosure. [0032] As further illustrated in both Figs. 5 and 6, the front end 46 of the cap 44 of the airflow indicator assembly 36 may include not just one aperture 48, but a plurality of apertures 48. The plurality of apertures 48 allow air to flow through the cap 44 and into the pair of fins 50 disposed within a center C of front end 46 of the cap 44, such that a more accurate measurement of the actual air flow through the outlet 32 is obtained. In other words, air exiting the outlet 32 flows through the apertures 48 of the cap 44, then into the apertures 57a-e of the spine 49 and through a space between the fins 51, such that the fins 51 direct the air flow into the needle 56. [0033] In addition, each fin 51 of the pair of fins 50 includes a semi-circular body 76 having a window 78 disposed within the center of the semi-circular body 76. This structure allows the needle 56 to be clearly visible through each window 78 during operation of the vacuum cleaner 20. While each fin 51 includes a semi-circular body 76, one of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the shape of the body 76 of each fin 51 may alternatively include an oval, a circle, a partial oval, a partial circle, a portion of a square, or a portion of a rectangle or any combination thereof and still fall within the scope of the present disclosure. [0034] As depicted in Fig. 8, the strap 52 extends from the spine 49 of the airflow indicator assembly 36 at a first end 81 of the strap 52. At a second end 83, the strap 52 includes a projection 85 that fits into a recess 87 (Fig. 3) on the vacuum cleaner 20, acting as a leash for the cap 44 and airflow indicator assembly 36. Said another way, the strap 52 is flexible and, thus, the projection 85 disposed on the second end 83 of the strap 52 may be moved upwardly and inserted into the recess 87 of the vacuum after the cap 44 is secured to the vacuum cleaner 20 at the outlet 32. The strap 52 secures the airflow indicator assembly 36 and the cap 44 to the vacuum 20 when the cap 44 is removed from the outlet 32, preventing both the cap 44 and the airflow indicator assembly 36 from detaching from the vacuum 20.
