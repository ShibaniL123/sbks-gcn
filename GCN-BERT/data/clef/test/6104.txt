Synthesis of 1-[5-(dimethylphosphinoylmethoxy)-3-fluoropyridin-2-yl]-8-(1,3-dimethyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)-7-methoxy-3-methyl-1,3-dihydroimidazo[4,5-c]quinolin-2-one
8-(1,3-Dimethylpyrazol-4-yl)-1-(3-fluoro-5-hydroxy-2-pyridyl)-7-methoxy-3-methylimidazo-[4,5-c]quinolin-2-one (80 mg, 0.18 mmol, 98%), chloro(dimethylphosphoryl)methane (76.3 mg, 0.54 mmol, 90%), potassium carbonate (50 mg, 0.36 mmol) and N,N-dimethyl-formamide (5 ml) were initially introduced in an 8 ml reaction vessel which had been flushed with argon and kept under argon inert-gas atmosphere. The reaction mixture was heated at 180Â° C. for 2 hours (microwave). The solids obtained were filtered off. The crude product was purified by means of preparative HPLC, giving 11.7 mg (12%) of 1-[5-(dimethylphosphinoylmethoxy)-3-fluoropyridin-2-yl]-8-(1,3-dimethyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)-7-methoxy-3-methyl-1,3-dihydroimidazo[4,5-c]quinolin-2-one as solid.
