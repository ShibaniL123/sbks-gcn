(Example 38)
Step 1
To Compound 89 (1 g, 1.821 mmol) in dichloromethane (10 mL) solution was added trifluoroacetic acid (10 mL), the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1 hour. Then, saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution was added thereto, and the mixture was extracted with chloroform. The organic layer was washed with water, and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. After concentration under reduced pressure, the residue was purified by silica gel chromatography (hexane - ethyl acetate) to obtain Compound 150 (831 mg, 93% yield) as yellow foam.
