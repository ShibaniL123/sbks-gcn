Step 5 Synthesis of Compound 126
Compound 125 (1.4 g, 2.44 mmol) was dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (7.0 mL). 1 mol/L tetrabutylammonium fluoride in tetrahydrofuran solution (7.32 mL, 7.32 mmol) was added dropwise thereto at room temperature, the mixture was stirred at 60Â°C for 1 hour. Water (50 mL) was added thereto, and the mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate (50 mL). The organic layer was washed with water (50 mL) and saturated brine (50 mL), and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. After concentration, the residue was purified by silica gel chromatography (hexane - ethyl acetate) to obtain Compound 126 (959 mg, 95% yield).
