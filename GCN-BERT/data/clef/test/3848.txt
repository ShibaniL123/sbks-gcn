To a 500 mL round-bottomed flask equipped with condenser and argon inlet were added aluminum chloride (3.15 g, 23.62 mmol), carbon disulfide (25 mL), and chloroacetyl chloride (0.92 g, 8.10 mmol) under ice-bath. The mixture was stirred for 15 mins. To the stirring mixture was added 3,4-dihydro-2(H)-quinolinone (1.00 g, 6.75 mmol) in portions over 5 mins. The mixture was stirred for 10 minutes prior to reflux for 2.5 hours. The reaction mixture was cooled and the solvent was decanted off. Then ice and cold water (25 mL) was slowly added while stirred thoroughly. The beige precipitate filtered, washed with water (3×50 mL) followed by tetrahydrofuran (2×100 mL) and hexanes (1×200 mL). The solid was dried under vacuum to give 6-(2-chloroacetyl)-3,4-dihydroquinazolin-2(1H)-one (1.42 g, 94%) as a beige solid.
