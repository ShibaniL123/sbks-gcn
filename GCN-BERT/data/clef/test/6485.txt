Preparation of a diastereoisomeric mixture of N-(4-((6S,8R)-7-(3-((tert-butyldiphenylsilyl)oxy)-2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-8-methyl-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-3H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]isoquinolin-6-yl)-3,5-difluorophenyl)-1-(3-fluoropropyl)azetidin-3-amine
1-Fluoro-3-iodopropane (0.026 mL, 0.16 mmol) was added to a stirred solution of N-(4-((6S,8R)-7-(3-((tert-butyldiphenylsilyl)oxy)-2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-8-methyl-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-3H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]isoquinolin-6-yl)-3,5-difluorophenyl)azetidin-3-amine (115 mg, 0.16 mmol) and diisopropylethylamine (0.058 mL, 0.33 mmol) in NMP (0.75 mL). The reaction was stirred for 16 hours at room temperature before being diluted with EtOAc and washed with saturated aqueous NaHCO3. The layers were separated and the aqueous layer was extracted with EtOAc. The combined organic layers were washed with saturated aqueous NaCl (2Ã—5 mL), dried over MgSO4, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was purified by flash silica chromatography, elution gradient 1 to 20% MeOH in DCM to afford N-(4-((6S,8R)-7-(3-((tert-butyldiphenylsilyl)oxy)-2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-8-methyl-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-3H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]isoquinolin-6-yl)-3,5-difluorophenyl)-1-(3-fluoropropyl)azetidin-3-amine (82 mg, 66%) as a pale yellow film. m/z: ES+ [M+H]+ 758.
