Triethylammonium N-(O-(5-(3,4,6-O-triacetyl-2-acetylamino-2-deoxy-Î²-D-galactopyranosyl)oxy)pentenoyl)-4-(((4,4'-dimethoxytrityl)oxy)methyl)piperidin-4-yl)methyl hemisuccinate 35i
Compound 27i (0.990 g, 1.0 mmol), succinic anhydride (1.00 g, 10 mmol), and pyridine (5.0 mL) were stirred at room temperature for 4 days. The reaction mixture was quenched with water and triethylamine (2 mL) for 4 h, evaporated to an oil, diluted with DCM (50 mL), and washed with 10% aqueous citric acid. The organic phase was basified with triethylamine (4.0 mL), dried over Na2SO4, and evaporated. The product was isolated on a silica gel column (1% Et3N, 0-4% MeOH in DCM) to yield 35i (1.045 g, 87.7%).
