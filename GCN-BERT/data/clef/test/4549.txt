Example 16A
3-Ethyl-5-methyl-2,4-dioxo-1-(3,3,3-trifluoropropyl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrothieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine-6-carboxylic acid
80 ml of trifluoroacetic acid were added to a solution of 6.89 g (16.9 mmol) of the compound from Ex. 11A in 240 ml of dichloromethane, and the mixture was stirred at RT for 2 h. The reaction mixture was then concentrated to dryness on a rotary evaporator. The remaining residue was stirred in diethyl ether and filtered off with suction, and the solid was dried under high vacuum. 5.13 g (86% of theory) of the title compound were obtained.
