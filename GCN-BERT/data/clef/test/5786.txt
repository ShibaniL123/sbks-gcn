More specifically, the display controller 74 controls video reels in a game screen displayed on the first display 54 and/or the second display 56 by using computer graphics and the image data. [0040] The RNG 68 generates and outputs random numbers to the CPU 60 preferably at the start of each round of game. The CPU 60 uses the random numbers to determine an outcome of a game. For example, if the game is a video slot game, the CPU 60 uses the RNG 68 to randomly select an arrangement of symbols to be displayed on video reels. Moreover, the CPU 60 generally uses random numbers generated by the RNG 68 to play the games, and to determine whether or not to provide an award to a player. In addition, the CPU 60 generates game outcomes including combinations of random numbers, and compares the generated combinations with winning combinations stored in the winning combination table to determine if the generated outcome is a winning outcome that is associated with a type of award. [0041] Figure 8 is an exemplary graphical display of a game that is displayed by the gaming machine 12 shown in Figure 2. In the illustrated embodiment, the gaming controller 16 is configured to display the game on the display device 13. In one embodiment, the game includes a main game 80, such as a video slot game. However, it should be noted that the main game 80 may be any type of game upon which a player could make a wager including, but not limited to a keno game, a blackjack game, a video poker game, or any type of game that enables the gaming machine 12 to function as described herein. In the illustrated embodiment, the main game 80 is displayed on the first display 54. Alternatively, the main game 80 may be displayed on the first display 54 and/or the second display 56. [0042] In general, during play of the main game 80, the gaming controller 16 randomly generates an outcome 84 of the main game 80 and displays the generated game outcome 84 in a display area 86. The gaming controller 16 randomly selects a plurality of game symbols 88 from a predefined set of possible game symbols and displays the selected game symbols 88 associated with the generated game outcome 84 in the game display area 86. [0043] In the illustrated embodiment, the plurality of game symbols 88 are displayed in a grid 90 having a plurality of cells 92 arranged along a plurality of rows 94 and a plurality of columns 96. Each cell 92 displays one or more game symbols 88 associated with the game outcome 84. In the illustrated embodiment, the gaming controller 16 displays the game symbols 88 within a plurality of reels 98. Each reel 98 is associated with a corresponding column 96. The main game 80, in one embodiment, includes 5 reels 98 with 3 cells 92 displayed in the display area 86 per reel 98 (a “3x5” arrangement). Alternatively, other reel arrangements may be used such as, for example, 4, 5, 5, 5, and 4 cells per reel, respectively (a “4-5-5-5-4” arrangement), 3-4-3-4-3, or 4-5-4-5-4 arrangements or arrangements with the same number of cells per column, such as 3x3, 3x4, 4x5, or 5x5 configurations. The main game 80 also includes a plurality of paylines 100 that extend across one or more cells 92 to indicate, to the player, a combination of game symbols 88. In one embodiment, the gaming machine 12 displays the main game 80 via a plurality of mechanical reels (not shown) that include a plurality of symbols displayed on a circumferential surface of each reel. [0044] Each slot game is generally played in a conventional manner. The player makes a wager, which may be based on a predetermined denomination and a selected number of paylines, the gaming controller 16 randomly generates an outcome for the game, spins the reels, and selectively stops the reels to display a game symbol 88 in each of the display cells 92. If a predetermined pattern of symbols 88 is randomly chosen for each cell 92 associated with a played pay line 100, the player may be awarded a payout based on the pay line, the wager, and a predetermined paytable. Moreover, the player may be awarded a payout if the combination of symbols associated with a selected payline is a winning combination. In addition, a player may receive a bonus feature and/or a bonus game based on the combination of symbols associated with the selected payline and/or the appearance of one or more predefined symbols in the game outcome 84. Many variations to the above described general play of a slot game fall within the scope of the present invention. Such slot games are well-known in the art, and are therefore not further discussed. [0045] In the illustrated embodiment, the gaming machine 12 receives a signal, from the user input device 14, that is indicative of a player’s selection to initiate a gaming session including a wager amount, and a selection of one or more pay lines 100 associated with a predefined set of cells 92 within the displayed grid 90. In the illustrated embodiment, the gaming machine 12 is a multi-line game, i.e., the paylines include horizontal paylines and/or diagonal pay-lines, and/or zig-zag paylines. Moreover, the user input device 14 may allow the player to toggle to increase the bet per pay line a credit at a time (up to the maximum bet). The gaming controller 16 randomly generates an outcome of the main game 80, and displays the generated outcome on the display device 13. In one embodiment, the gaming controller 16 is configured to rotate, and/or spin each reel 98 to initiate a game play, and stop each reel 98 to display a plurality of symbols 88 associated with the randomly generated outcome. In addition, the gaming controller 16 is adapted to determine if the generated outcome is a winning outcome based on the displayed game symbols 88, a pay-table, a wager, and one or more selected paylines 100. More specifically, the gaming machine 12 determines if a combination of symbols 88 arranged along the selected payline 100 is a winning combination. The gaming controller 16 may provide an award in response to the outcome of the main game 80. In general, the term “award” may be a payout, in terms of credits or money. Thus, gaming controller 16 may award a regular payout in response to the outcome of the main game 80. However, it should be noted that the term award may also refer to other types of awards, including, prizes, e.g., meals, show tickets, etc..., as well as in-game awards, such as free games or awarding the player one or more wild symbols or stacked wild symbols in each of the games. [0046] The illustrated embodiment can also include a bonus feature or secondary game in addition to the main game on the gaming machine. The bonus feature or secondary game is an add-on to the main game utilizing any in-game machine asset (discussed in more detail below). A bonus feature or secondary game is considered an add-on to the main game that occurs during game play. The bonus feature or secondary game can used any in-game machine asset that is used to display an award related to the main game. Such awards include free spins, credits, a credit multiplier, or additional pseudo game-play unrelated to the main game. The bonus feature or secondary game can be in any of the wagering or non-wagering formats as described above (slots, video poker, etc.). A bonus feature or secondary game may also be similar to the main game through the use of additional random numbers in order to continue randomized, wagerbased game play. A bonus feature or secondary game may include any additional game play and grant awards based on any particularized triggers built into the main game of the game machine. It should be noted that the game may only include the main game 80. Alternatively, the game may include the main game 80 and one or more bonus features and/or one or more secondary games. It should be noted that the present invention is not limited to any specific bonus feature or secondary game (or type thereof). Exemplary bonus features or secondary games are disclosed in United States Patent 7,824,260, United States Patent 8,052,515, United States Patent 8,096,869, United States Patent 8,303,397, and United States Patent Application Publication 2011/0223985, all of which are hereby incorporated by reference. Player Tracking System and Method [0047] In one embodiment, the system controller 10 and method may be embodied or implemented via an entertaining and monitoring system 108 which is shown in block diagram form in Figure 4.

[0048] As shown, the system 2 includes a plurality of gaming machines 12. Gaming Machines 12 may include, but are not limited to gaming machines, electronic gaming machines (such as video slot, video poker machines, or video arcade games), electric gaming machines, virtual gaming machines, e.g., for online gaming, an interface to a table management system (not shown) for table games, kiosks 12Κ, point of sale or redemption terminals 12J, or other suitable devices at which a patron may interact or access a user or player account. However, it should be noted that the present invention is not limited to any number or type of gaming machines 12. In one embodiment, the gaming machines 12 are organized into banks (not shown), each bank containing a plurality of gaming machines 12. [0049] Other types of gaming machines which may be included (see above) are indicated with reference number 121. [0050] The gaming machines 12 are connected via a network 14 to one or more host computers or servers 201, which are generally located at a remote or central location. The computer 201 includes a computer program application 204 which maintains one or more player tracking accounts databases 205. [0051] The computer program application 201 and databases 205 may be used to record, track, and report accounting information regarding the gaming machines 12 and players 224 of the gaming machines 12. Additionally, the computer program application 204 and database(s) 205 may be used to maintain information related to player or player tracking accounts (see below). [0052] In general, the machines 12 may be used by a user or player, i.e., to access their player account. For example, a gaming machine 12 is playable by a player 224. The player 224 may select one of the gaming machines 12 to play and insert a coin, credit, coupon, and/or player tracking card (not shown) into the chosen gaming machine 12. Generally, the gaming machines 12 have an associated number of credits or coins required in order to play. In the case of video slot or poker games, the game is played and an award in the form of credits may be awarded based on a pay table of the gaming machine 12. [0053] Input to the gaming machine 12 may be accomplished via mechanical switches, buttons 24, or via a display interface 13 (discussed above). [0054] The player 224 is identified via the player tracking card and/or a player identification number entered into player tracking device 46 at each gaming machine 12 (see above). Player tracking accounts may be used, generally, to provide bonuses or player tracking awards, to a player, in addition to the award designated by, in the case of a video slot or poker machine, the gaming machine 12 paytable. These bonuses may be awarded to the player 224 based a set of criteria, including, but not limited to, a) the player’s play on the gaming machine 12, b) the player’s overall play, c) play during a predetermined period of time, and d) the player’s birthday or anniversary, or ℮) any other definable criteria. Additionally, bonuses may be awarded on a random basis, i.e., to a randomly chosen player or randomly chosen main game 80. Bonuses may also be awarded in a discretionary manner or based on other criteria, such as, purchases made at a gift shop or other affiliated location. [0055] In one embodiment, the player tracking device 46 includes a processor 47, a player identification card reader 48 and/or a numeric keypad 52, and a display 50. In one embodiment, the display 50 is a touchscreen panel and the numeric keypad 52 is implemented thereon. [0056] The player 224 may be identified by entry of a player tracking card into the player identification card reader 48 and/or entry of a player identification number (PIN) on the numeric key pad 52. The play tracking device 46 may also be used to communicate information between the computer 201 and the corresponding gaming machine 12. The player tracking device 46 may also be used to track bonus points, i.e., incentive points or credits, downloaded from the computer 201. [0057] In one aspect of the present invention, each player tracking device 46 is associated with one of the electronic gaming machines 12. The player tracking devices 46 identify patrons interacting with the system 2, for tracking wagers made by the players on the electronic gaming machines 12 and record wager data associated with each wager made by the player and a respective electronic gaming machine 12. In one embodiment, the wager data includes a device type associated with respective gaming machine, an electronic gaming machine identifier, the theoretical hold percentage associated with the respective gaming machine, and an amount of the respective wager. The wager data may also include a player ID and a date/time stamp. [0058] The computer or server 201 is in communication with the player tracking devices 46 and the non-gaming terminals 121, 12J, 12Κ for receiving the wager data associated with the patrons and the respective gaming machine 12 from the player tracking device 46 and storing the wager data in the database 205 and, for receiving transaction data associated with a transaction associated with the patrons' use of the non-gaming terminals 121, 12J, 12Κ and storing the transaction data in the database. The computer 201 may also establishes a player rating associated with each player as a function of the wager data and the transaction data. [0059] In one aspect of the present invention, the bonuses are awarded as bonus points. In one embodiment, the bonus points are incentive points. In another embodiment, the bonus points are credits. [0060] The incentive points may be converted to credits using a predetermined ratio. The predetermined ratio may be 1 or any other desired ratio. The predetermined ratio may also be varied based on determined criteria, e.g., the gaming machine 12 being played, the player, or the time of day. Incentive points may be designated as cashable or non-cashable. As described below, the incentive points in a player account may be downloaded to one of the gaming machines 12 for play. [0061] Incentive points stored in the player account may be designated as cashable or non-cashable. In one embodiment, the player account may include only cashable incentive points. In another embodiment, the player account may include only non-cashable incentive points. In a third embodiment, the player account may include both cashable and non-cashable incentive points. In still another embodiment, the player account may include incentive points, cashable and/or non-cashable, and credits, cashable and/or non-cashable. Cashable credits, or incentive points converted into credits, may be downloaded to a gaming machine 12. When the player has finished playing the gaming machine 12, any remaining credits may be cashed out, i.e., retrieved as coins or placed on a printed ticket or player tracking card for redemption or play on another gaming machine 12. [0062] Non-cashable credits must be played. When the player stops playing gaming machine 12C, any remaining non-cashable credits which were downloaded to the gaming machine 12C are either lost or uploaded back to the player account (see below). [0063] The database 205 tracks the player account for each player in the player tracking system. In the illustrated example, the following is tracked for each player: account number, incentive points, name, cashable credits and non-cashable credits. Thus in this example, bonus points in the form of incentive points, cashable credits and non-cashable credits may be awarded. [0064] In one aspect of the present invention, bonus points are awarded via electronic vouchers, i.e., records in the database 205. A voucher is created each time bonus points are awarded. Each voucher has a voucher number and an amount (in the case a dollar or credit amount). Each voucher is assigned to a player account and includes the player account number to which it is assigned. Each voucher may include additional parameters or fields based on the needs of the system 2. For example, an expiration date could be included which gives a date at which the respective voucher expires. The voucher may also designate the bonus points as cashable or non-cashable. [0065] In one aspect of the present invention the computer 201 may create a first voucher and assign a first number of bonus points to the first voucher. The computer 201 may also create a second voucher and assign a second number of bonus points to the second voucher. The first and second vouchers may be assigned to a player account. Each voucher has a parameter. The parameter of the first voucher has a first value and the parameter of the second voucher has a second value. [0066] In one embodiment, the bonus points are incentive points which may be converted to credits and downloaded to the gaming machine 12. In another embodiment, the bonus points are credits which may be downloaded to the gaming machine 12. [0067] In one embodiment, the gaming machine 12 may display to the player 224 a list of the vouchers which have been assigned to their player account. The player 224 may then indicate at least one voucher to download. The list may displayed whenever appropriate, for example, when the player 224 is identified to the system 2, when the player requests the list (through a menu system), when a new voucher has been created, or any other suitable time. In one embodiment, the list may be displayed on the display 13. In another embodiment, the list may be displayed on the player tracking device display 50. [0068] The first and second values of the parameters of the first and second vouchers may be equal or different. For example, in one embodiment the parameter relates to an expiration date of the respective voucher. The expiration date may be a function of the date of the voucher was created. Thus, the expiration dates of the first and second vouchers may be different if the vouchers were created on different days or may be the same if created on the same day. [0069] In another embodiment, the parameter is one of cashable and non-cashable. The computer 18 may designed a voucher as cashable or non-cashable. Typically, this is defined by predefined criteria based on how the voucher was created. If the bonus points for a specific voucher are incentive points, the incentive points may be converted to credits prior to downloading to the gamine machine 12. As described above, this is done using a predetermined ration which may be 1 or some other ratio. [0070] In one embodiment, the gaming machine 12 may provide an indication to the player 224 when the first voucher or second voucher has been assigned to the player account. For example, the indication may be an audio signal and/or a visual signal. [0071] In one embodiment, the parameter may be an expiration date of the respective voucher. Each voucher may also include a second parameter designating the respective bonus points as being cashable or non-cashable. [0072] In one embodiment, the computer 201 may convert the first number of bonus points to a first number of credits and download the first number of credits to the player tracking device 46. [0073] In another embodiment, the gaming machine 12 has a credit meter for tracking available credits for play of the gaming machine by the player 224. The computer 201 may convert the first number of bonus points to a first number of credits and download the first number of credits to the credit controller 62. [0074] In one embodiment, the parameter may be one lump-sum and pay for play. The computer 201 may convert the first number of bonus points to credits and download the credits to the credit meter if the first voucher is designated as lump-sum. [0075] In one embodiment of the present invention, the gaming machine 12 is capable of accepting a variable wager. The variable wager has a maximum wager value or MAX BET. In one embodiment, the maximum wager value is equal to the lesser of a value defined by the configuration of the gaming machine 12, a value defined by the incentive setup, or the remaining balance of bonus points. The computer 201 converts the first number of bonus points associated with the first voucher to a first number of credits and downloads the first number of bonus points to the player tracking device 46 as credits. The gaming machine 12 allows the player 224 to place a wager and play the gaming machine 12. The gaming machine 12 decrements the wager from the credit meter, decrements the maximum wager from the player tracking device 46, and credits the maximum wager to the credit meter in response to the player 224 playing the gaming machine 12. [0076] In another embodiment of the present invention, the player account is credited with a first number of bonus points. The bonus points are downloaded to the player tracking device 38 as credits. The player 224 places a wager and the gaming machine 12 is played. If the total of the player’s wagers (over one or more games) is greater or equal to a predetermined value, i.e., a predetermined match play amount, then the match play amount is decremented from the player tracking device 46 and the match play amount is credited to the credit meter. Otherwise, the player 224 may place another wager. [0077] In one aspect of the present invention, the player tracking device 46 provides an interface for interaction between the player 224 or other user (not shown), such as a slot employee or slot technician, and the host computer 18, i.e., player tracking system. As discussed above in one embodiment, the display 50 is a touchscreen display which allows information to be displayed to the player 224 or user, as well as provide interactive buttons or menus for receiving input. Furthermore, the keypad 52 may be implemented on the display 50 and displayed on the display 50 as appropriate or required. [0078] Furthermore, as discussed above, the player tracking device 38 may display a list of vouchers assigned to the player 24. The player 24 may be allowed to select a voucher, or a number of available bonus points or credits, to download. Once the player selects a voucher or a number of credits or points to download, the credits may be downloaded to the credit meter on the gaming machine 12 and are then available for use. Community Award System and Method [0079] In general, the present embodiment of the invention discloses a system 2 in order to grant a community award to a player. The system comprises a plurality of gaming machines 12 and a system controller 10. Each gaming machine is configured receive a wager from a player and initiate a game for play by a player. The system controller is coupled to each of the gaming machines and includes a database with a community awards list and a plurality of total award amounts associated with a corresponding number of players. The system controller is then configured to detect a triggering condition as a function of the received wagers; responsively determine a number of players playing the plurality of gaming machines; further determine a total award as a function of the determined number of players and the community award list; and provide a community award being equal to at least one player as a function of the determined total award. [0080] In one embodiment, the system controller 10 may be implemented independently, utilizing the network 14 to maintain communication with the plurality of gaming machines 12. In another embodiment, the system controller may be incorporated within the player tracking system 108 (as discussed above). This would grant full integration between the system controller handling the community award and the player tracking system 108. The incorporation of the system controller 10 and the player tracking system 108 can occur through the computer server 201 or through any additional component that may be in communication through the network 14. In another embodiment, the system controller 10 may also be included within the game controller 16 incorporated within each gaming machine 12. This would allow for the implementation of the community award via ad-hoc communication between gaming machines 12 that are not connected to a network 14. Dynamic Total Award [0081] In one embodiment, the community award list can comprise any type of award type amount that can change as a function of the number of players playing the gaming machines that are attached to the system controller. These total award amounts correspond to the number of players actively playing on the gaming machines and therefore affect the rankings that are determined by the system controller. For example, a community award list that demonstrates a changing top award amount as a function of the number of players may be provided in the following chart. S players 7 piayess 6 players 5 players 4 players 3 players 2 players 1 piiayer Top award $500 $2SQ $100 $50 540 $30 $20 $10 2nd award $250 $200 $50 $40 $33 $20 $10 8/A 3rd awa rd $100 $50 $40 $30 $20 $10 8/A 8/A 41th award $50 $40 $30 $20 $10 8/A 8/a 8/A 5ith award $40 $30 $20 $10 Ν/Α 8/A 8/ A 8/A Sith award $30 $20 $10 8/A Ν/Α 8/A 8/A 8/A 7£h award $20 510 8/A 8/a S8/A 8/A Η/Α 8/A 8th award $10 8/A NS/A 8/a Ν/Α 8/A 8/A 8/A [0082] The horizontal top row represents the number of players that have actively triggered the system controller through gaming machines. The vertical row represents the possible total award amounts based on ranking. Based on this example chart one can see the how the system controller can access variable total award amounts a function of the amount of players in the system. [0083] In another embodiment of the present invention, the system controller 10 may be configured to provide a community award to the determined players 224 as function of the determined total award with each community award being equal to a portion of the determined total award. This would allow for granting an equal community award to all players currently interacting with the system 2 as function of the total award previously measured by the number of active players. [0084] In another embodiment of the present invention, the system controller 10 may be configured to determine the ranking for each player and provide the community award based on that ranking. This allows for different methods of granting the community award among the plurality of players currently interacting with the system. Said ranking can be determined by the gaming machines 12, the system controller 10, or any other device in communication with the network 14. [0085] In another embodiment of the present invention, the system controller 10 may be configured to determine the player’s ranking based on an associated player rating. This rating can be determined by the gaming machines 12, the system controller 10, or any other device in communication with the network 14. [0086] In another embodiment of the present invention, the system controller 10 may be connected to a player tracking system and configured to determine the player rating as a function of a plurality of predefined criteria from the player tracking system 108. Such criteria may include prior player history, non-gaming activity, pre-coded player metrics, or any other predefined criteria defined within the system 2. [0087] In another embodiment of the present invention, the system controller 10 may be configured to award a single award amount as a function of the number of players interacting with the system. This single award may be awarded to the top-ranked player (based on the ranking embodiment above), or to another player based on other gaming mechanics built into the system. [0088] In another embodiment of the present invention, the system controller 10 may be configured to award a set of player awards, with each set amount corresponding to the number of player initiating the gaming machines 12. This embodiment will allow for granting multiple awards, instead of single total award, as a function of the number of players in the system. [0089] In another embodiment of the present invention, the player awards can be of varying size. [0090] In another embodiment of the present invention, the system controller 10 may be configured to determine the player awards based on the player rankings (discussed above). This will grant larger player awards to higher ranked players as a function of various predefined criteria (also discussed above). [0091] Figure 6 is a flow diagram of a method 600 performed by the system in order to grant a community award to a player through the system detailed in Figure 1. Initially, at step 601, the system controller 10 determines the number of players playing the group of gaming machines. This occurs through the system controller 10 receiving a trigger from the plurality of gaming machines 12. The trigger can be through the player 224 interacting with any of the input mechanisms built into the gaming machines 12, such as the display 13, the buttons 24, or the counter/acceptor 28/26. Then, at step 602, the system controller determines the total award amounts available. As shown in the example table above, the system controller can access the available total award amounts available for the given number of players currently in the system. Next, the system controller determines or receives a rating associated with each player at step 603. The rating may be generated by the system controller 10 or produced by the controller through a separate player tracking system 108. [0092] In another embodiment, the system controller can use pre-coded criteria or playergenerated transactions in order generate the ratings for each player. Pre-coded criteria or playergenerated transactions can be directly by the system controller or inputted by the player tracking system. Such pre-coded metrics can include a player’s particular gambling status, birthdate, etc. Player-generated transactions can involve a player’s gambling history as collected by the gaming machines 12 or additional non-wagering machines connected to the system. [0093] Next, the system controller determines the ranking of each player based on the associated player ranking at step 604. This is based on the corresponding total award amount or probabilities found within the community award lists in the system controller. Here, the system controller can have a variety of different total award amounts depending on how the community awards list is set up. The community award list could have only one award for the top ranked player or a have multiple awards for each particular ranking that is presently active. [0094] Based on the particular set of the community award list, the system controller will then send a signal indicating the appropriate award amounts to each active gaming machine in relation to the ranking at step 605. Finally, at step 606, the gaming machine received the award amount signal and distributes the appropriate award to the player. Dynamic Probability [0095] In another aspect of the present invention, a system providing a community award to player is disclosed. The system comprises a plurality of gaming machines and a system controller. Each gaming machine is configured receive a wager from a respective player and responsively initiate a game. The system controller is coupled to each of the gaming machines and includes a database with a community awards list including a plurality of total award probabilities, each total award probability associated with a corresponding number of players. The system controller is then configured to detect a triggering condition; responsively determine a number of players playing the plurality of gaming machines; determine a total award probability as a function of the determined number of players and the community award list; and provide a community award to at least one of the plurality of players as a function of the determined total award probability. [0096] In another embodiment of the present invention, the system controller 10 may be configured to provide a community award to the determined players 224 as function of the determined total award probability with each community award being equal to a portion of the determined community. This would allow for granting an equal community awards to all players currently interacting with the system 2 as function of the total award probability previously measured by the number of active players. The total award probability can be triggered by one player in order to grant the award to all players or can be required by players in order to receive their prospective community award. [0097] In another embodiment of the present invention, the system controller 10 may be configured to determine the ranking for each player and provide the community award based on that ranking. This allows for different methods of granting the community award among the plurality of players currently interacting with the system. Said ranking can be determined by the gaming machines 12, the system controller 10, or any other device in communication with the network 14. [0098] In another embodiment of the present invention, the system controller 10 may be configured to determine the player’s ranking based on an associated player rating. This rating can be determined by the gaming machines 12, the system controller 10, or any other device in communication with the network 14. [0099] In another embodiment of the present invention, the system controller 10 may be connected to a player tracking system and configured to determine the player rating as a function of a plurality of predefined criteria from the player tracking system 108. Such criteria may include prior player history, non-gaming activity, pre-coded player metrics, or any other predefined criteria defined within the system 2. [00100] In another embodiment of the present invention, the system controller 10 may be configured to award a single community award amount as a function of the number of players interacting with the system. This single community award may be awarded to the top-ranked player (based on the ranking embodiment above), or to another player based on other gaming mechanics built into the system. [00101] Figure 7 is a flow diagram of a method 700 performed by the system in order to grant a community award to a player through the system detailed in Figure 1. This particular embodiment utilizes changing probabilities that are a function of the number of players attached to the system in order to grant the community award amount. [00102] Initially, at step 701, the system controller 10 determines the number of players playing the group of gaming machines. This occurs through the system controller 10 receiving a trigger from the plurality of gaming machines 12. The trigger can be through the player 224 interacting with any of the input mechanisms built into the gaming machines 12, such as the display 13, the buttons 24, or the counter/acceptor 28/26. Then, at step 702, the system controller determines the total award probabilities available. Unlike the Dynamic Paytable embodiment above, the probabilities linked to the community award list only increase the chances of a particular set of player winning the particular community established by the game machine 12. This community award can be predetermined or result from a system award granted through the system controller 10. Also, the community award may consist of a single award for a particular player currently playing one of the gaming machines 12 or a larger community award granted to all players attached to gaming machines 12. [00103] Next, the system controller determines or receives a rating associated with each player at step 603. The rating may be generated by the system controller 10 or produced by the controller through a separate player tracking system 108. [00104] In another embodiment, the system controller can use pre-coded criteria or playergenerated transactions in order generate the ratings for each player. Pre-coded criteria or playergenerated transactions can be directly by the system controller or inputted by the player tracking system. Such pre-coded metrics can include a player’s particular gambling status, birthdate, etc. Player-generated transactions can involve a player’s gambling history as collected by the gaming machines 12 or additional non-wagering machines connected to the system. [00105] Next, the system controller determines the ranking of each player based on the associated player ranking at step 704. A community award based on a dynamic probability will require a ranking in order to grant the award to the top-ranked player once the community award is triggered within the system. Otherwise, the system will note to send a corresponding community award amount to every machine that currently attached to the system once the appropriate community award probability is triggered. [00106] Based on the particular set of the community award list, the system controller will then send a signal indicating the appropriate award amounts to each active gaming machine in relation to the ranking at step 705. Finally, at step 706, the gaming machine received the award amount signal and distributes the appropriate award to the player.
