The present invention relates to flame-retardant, impact-modified polycarbonate (PC) compositions comprising cyclic phosphazenes, which compositions have high stiffness (modulus of elasticity) and high notched impact strength, and also to processes for their production, and to the use of cyclic phosphazenes as flame retardants in polycarbonate compositions. EP 1 095 099 A1 describes polycarbonate/ABS moulding compositions provided with phosphazenes and phosphorus compounds, which compositions have excellent flame retardancy and very good mechanical properties such as joint line strength or notched impact strength. EP 1 196 498 A1 describes moulding compositions provided with phosphazenes and based on polycarbonate and graft polymers selected from the group of the silicone, EP(D)M and acrylate rubbers as graft base, which compositions have excellent flame retardancy and very good mechanical properties such as stress cracking resistance or notched impact strength. EP 1 095 100 A1 describes polycarbonate/ABS moulding compositions comprising phosphazenes and inorganic nanoparticles, which compositions have excellent flame retardancy and very good mechanical properties. EP 1 095 097 A1 describes polycarbonate/ABS moulding compositions provided with phosphazenes, which compositions have excellent flame retardancy and very good processing properties, wherein the graft polymer is produced by means of mass, solution or mass-suspension polymerisation processes. JP 2000 351893 discloses impact-modified polycarbonate moulding compositions comprising phosphazenes, which compositions are distinguished by good hydrolytic stability, good flame retardancy and stability of the electrical properties. In the above-mentioned documents, linear and cyclic phosphazenes are disclosed. In the case of the cyclic phosphazenes, the contents of trimers, tetramers and higher oligomers are not specified, however. JP 1995 0038462 describes polycarbonate compositions comprising graft polymers, phosphazenes as flame retardants and optionally vinyl copolymers. Specific structures, compositions and amounts of the flame retardant are not mentioned, however. JP19990176718 describes thermoplastic compositions consisting of aromatic polycarbonate, copolymer of aromatic vinyl monomers and vinyl cyanides, graft polymer of alkyl(meth)acrylates and rubber, and phosphazene as flame retardant, which compositions have good flowability. Accordingly, the object of the present invention is to provide a flame-retardant moulding composition which is distinguished by a property combination of high stiffness, high notched impact strength, while having consistently good mechanical properties. It is a further object of the invention to provide flame-retardant moulding compositions which, while having good flame retardancy, have only a low phosphazene content, because flame retardants represent a considerable cost factor in the production of these compositions, so that they become less expensive. The moulding compositions are preferably flame retardant and fulfil the requirements of UL94 with V-0 even at thin wall thicknesses (i.e. wall thickness of 1.5 mm). It has been found, surprisingly, that the object of the present invention is achieved by compositions comprising A) from 45.5 to 95.00 parts by weight, preferably from 65 to 90 parts by weight, more preferably from 70 to 85 parts by weight, particularly preferably from 76 to 88 parts by weight, of aromatic polycarbonate and/or aromatic polyester carbonate,B) from 1.0 to 15.0 parts by weight, preferably from 3.0 to 12.5 parts by weight, particularly preferably from 4.0 to 10.0 parts by weight, of rubber-modified graft polymer,C) from 1.0 to 9.5 parts by weight, preferably from 1.5 to 9.0 parts by weight, more preferably from 2.0 to 8.0 parts by weight, particularly preferably from 4.5 to 8.0 parts by weight, of at least one cyclic phosphazene of structure (X) wherein k represents 1 or an integer from 1 to 10, preferably a number from 1 to 8, particularly preferably from 1 to 5, having a trimer content (k=1) of from 60 to 98 mol %, more preferably from 65 to 95 mol %, particularly preferably from 65 to 90 mol % and most particularly preferably from 65 to 85 mol %, in particular from 70 to 85 mol %, based on component C, and wherein R is in each case identical or different and represents an amine radical; C1- to C8-alkyl, preferably methyl, ethyl, propyl or butyl, each optionally halogenated, preferably halogenated with fluorine; C1- to C8-alkoxy, preferably methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy or butoxy; C5- to C6-cycloalkyl each optionally substituted by alkyl, preferably C1-C4-alkyl, and/or by halogen, preferably chlorine and/or bromine; C6- to C20-aryloxy, preferably phenoxy, naphthyloxy, each optionally substituted by alkyl, preferably C1-C4-alkyl, and/or by halogen, preferably chlorine, bromine, and/or by hydroxy; C7- to C12-aralkyl, preferably phenyl-C1-C4-alkyl, each optionally substituted by alkyl, preferably C1-C4-alkyl, and/or by halogen, preferably chlorine and/or bromine; or a halogen radical, preferably chlorine; or an OH radical, D) from 0 to 15.0 parts by weight, preferably from 2.0 to 12.5 parts by weight, more preferably from 3.0 to 9.0 parts by weight, particularly preferably from 3.0 to 6.0 parts by weight, of rubber-free vinyl (co)polymer or polyalkylene terephthalates, E) from 1.0 to 25.0 parts by weight, preferably from 2.0 to 15.0 parts by weight, particularly preferably from 4.0 to 10.0 parts by weight, of talc having a mean particle size d50 of from 0.1 to 4.0 μm, F) from 0 to 5.0 parts by weight, preferably from 0.05 to 3.00 parts by weight, more preferably from 0.2 to 2.0 parts by weight, particularly preferably from 0.4 to 1.0 part by weight, of additives, G) from 0.05 to 5.0 parts by weight, preferably from 0.1 to 2.0 parts by weight, particularly preferably from 0.1 to 1.0 part by weight, of antidripping agents, wherein all parts by weight are preferably so normalised in the present application that the sum of the parts by weight of all the components A+B+C+D+E+F+G in the composition is 100. In a preferred embodiment, the composition consists only of components A to G. In a preferred embodiment, the inorganic filler consists solely of talc. In a preferred embodiment, the composition is free of inorganic flame retardants and flame-retardant synergists, in particular aluminium hydroxide, aluminium oxide hydroxide and arsenic and antimony oxides.

In particular, the moulding compositions according to the invention can also be used, for example, in the production of the following moulded articles or mouldings: Parts for the interior finishing of railway vehicles, ships, aircraft, buses and other motor vehicles, casings for electrical devices containing small transformers, casings for devices for processing and transmitting information, casings and coverings for medical devices, casings for security devices, mouldings for sanitary and bathroom fittings, cover grids for ventilator openings, and casings for garden equipment.

Particularly preferred diphenols are 4,4′-dihydroxydiphenyl, bisphenol A, 2,4-bis(4-hydroxy-phenyl)-2-methylbutane, 1,1-bis-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-cyclohexane, 1,1-bis-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-3,3,5-trimethylcyclohexane, 4,4′-dihydroxydiphenyl sulfide, 4,4′-dihydroxydiphenylsulfone and di- and tetra-brominated or chlorinated derivatives thereof, such as, for example, 2,2-bis(3-chloro-4-hydroxyphenyl)-propane, 2,2-bis-(3,5-dichloro-4-hydroxyphenyl)-propane or 2,2-bis-(3,5-dibromo-4-hydroxyphenyl)-propane. 2,2-Bis-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-propane (bisphenol A) is particularly preferred. The diphenols can be used on their own or in the form of arbitrary mixtures. The diphenols are known in the literature or are obtainable according to processes known in the literature. Chain terminators suitable for the preparation of thermoplastic aromatic polycarbonates are, for example, phenol, p-chlorophenol, p-tert-butylphenol or 2,4,6-tribromophenol, but also long-chained alkylphenols, such as 4-[2-(2,4,4-trimethylpentyl)]-phenol, 4-(1,3-tetramethylbutyl)-phenol according to DE-A 2 842 005 or monoalkylphenol or dialkylphenols having a total of from 8 to 20 carbon atoms in the alkyl substituents, such as 3,5-di-tert-butylphenol, p-isooctylphenol, p-tert-octylphenol, p-dodecylphenol and 2-(3,5-dimethylheptyl)-phenol and 4-(3,5-dimethylheptyl)-phenol. The amount of chain terminators to be used is generally from 0.5 mol % to 10 mol %, based on the molar sum of the diphenols used in a particular case. The thermoplastic aromatic polycarbonates have mean molecular weights (weight-average Mw, measured by GPC (gel permeation chromatography) with polycarbonate standard) of from 15,000 to 80,000 g/mol, preferably from 19,000 to 32,000 g/mol, particularly preferably from 22,000 to 30,000 g/mol. The thermoplastic aromatic polycarbonates can be branched in a known manner, preferably by the incorporation of from 0.05 to 2.0 mol %, based on the sum of the diphenols used, of compounds having a functionality of three or more than three, for example those having three or more phenolic groups. Preference is given to the use of linear polycarbonates, more preferably based on bisphenol A. Both homopolycarbonates and copolycarbonates are suitable. For the preparation of copolycarbonates of component A according to the invention it is also possible to use from 1 to 25 wt. %, preferably from 2.5 to 25 wt. %, based on the total amount of diphenols to be used, of polydiorganosiloxanes having hydroxyaryloxy end groups. These are known (U.S. Pat. No. 3,419,634) and can be prepared according to processes known in the literature. Also suitable are copolycarbonates containing polydiorganosiloxanes; the preparation of copolycarbonates containing polydiorganosiloxanes is described, for example, in DE-A 3 334 782. Aromatic dicarboxylic acid dihalides for the preparation of aromatic polyester carbonates are preferably the diacid dichlorides of isophthalic acid, terephthalic acid, diphenyl ether 4,4′-dicarboxylic acid and naphthalene-2,6-dicarboxylic acid. Mixtures of the diacid dichlorides of isophthalic acid and terephthalic acid in a ratio of from 1:20 to 20:1 are particularly preferred. In the preparation of polyester carbonates, a carbonic acid halide, preferably phosgene, is additionally used concomitantly as bifunctional acid derivative. Suitable chain terminators for the preparation of the aromatic polyester carbonates, in addition to the monophenols already mentioned, are also the chlorocarbonic acid esters thereof and the acid chlorides of aromatic monocarboxylic acids, which can optionally be substituted by C1- to C22-alkyl groups or by halogen atoms, as well as aliphatic C2- to C22-monocarboxylic acid chlorides. The amount of chain terminators is in each case from 0.1 to 10 mol %, based in the case of phenolic chain terminators on mol of diphenol and in the case of monocarboxylic acid chloride chain terminators on mol of dicarboxylic acid dichloride. One or more aromatic hydroxycarboxylic acids can additionally be used in the preparation of aromatic polyester carbonates. The aromatic polyester carbonates can be both linear and branched in known manner (see in this connection DE-A 2 940 024 and DE-A 3 007 934), linear polyester carbonates being preferred. There can be used as branching agents, for example, carboxylic acid chlorides having a functionality of three or more, such as trimesic acid trichloride, cyanuric acid trichloride, 3,3′-,4,4′-benzophenone-tetracarboxylic acid tetrachloride, 1,4,5,8-naphthalenetetracarboxylic acid tetrachloride or pyromellitic acid tetrachloride, in amounts of from 0.01 to 1.0 mol % (based on dicarboxylic acid dichlorides used), or phenols having a functionality of three or more, such as phloroglucinol, 4,6-dimethyl-2,4,6-tri-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-hept-2-ene, 4,6-dimethyl-2,4,6-tri-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-heptane, 1,3,5-tri-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-benzene, 1,1,1-tri-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-ethane, tri-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-phenylmethane, 2,2-bis[4,4-bis(4-hydroxy-phenyl)-cyclohexyl]-propane, 2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl-isopropyl)-phenol, tetra-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-methane, 2,6-bis(2-hydroxy-5-methyl-benzyl)-4-methyl-phenol, 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-(2,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-propane, tetra-(4-[4-hydroxyphenyl-isopropyl]-phenoxy)-methane, 1,4-bis[4,4′-dihydroxytriphenyl)-methyl]-benzene, in amounts of from 0.01 to 1.0 mol %, based on diphenols used. Phenolic branching agents can be placed in a vessel with the diphenols; acid chloride branching agents can be introduced together with the acid dichlorides. The content of carbonate structural units in the thermoplastic aromatic polyester carbonates can vary as desired. The content of carbonate groups is preferably up to 100 mol %, in particular up to 80 mol %, particularly preferably up to 50 mol %, based on the sum of ester groups and carbonate groups. Both the esters and the carbonates contained in the aromatic polyester carbonates can be present in the polycondensation product in the form of blocks or distributed randomly. The thermoplastic aromatic polycarbonates and polyester carbonates can be used on their own or in an arbitrary mixture.

B. Bucknall, “Toughened Plastics”, Appl. Science Publishers, London 1977. Particularly preferred polymers B are, for example, ABS polymers (emulsion, mass and suspension ABS), as are described, for example, in DE-OS 2 035 390 (=U.S. Pat. No. 3,644,574) or in DE-OS 2 248 242 (=GB-PS 1 409 275) or in Ullmanns, Enzyklopidie der Technischen Chemie, Vol. 19 (1980), p. 280 ff. The graft copolymers B are produced by radical polymerisation, for example by emulsion, suspension, solution or mass polymerisation, preferably by emulsion or mass polymerisation. Preferred polymers B are partially crosslinked and have gel contents (measured in toluene) of over 20 wt. %, preferably over 40 wt. %, in particular over 60 wt. %. The gel content is determined at 25° C. in a suitable solvent (M. Hoffmann, H. Krömer, R. Kuhn, Polymeranalytik I und II, Georg Thieme-Verlag, Stuttgart 1977). Preferred graft polymers B include graft polymers of: B.1) from 5 to 95 parts by weight, preferably from 30 to 80 parts by weight, of a mixture ofB.1.1) from 50 to 95 parts by weight of styrene, α-methylstyrene, styrene substituted on the ring by methyl, C1-C8-alkyl methacrylate, in particular methyl methacrylate, C1-C8-alkyl acrylate, in particular methyl acrylate, or mixtures of these compounds, andB.1.2) from 5 to 50 parts by weight of acrylonitrile, methacrylonitrile, C1-C8-alkyl methacrylates, in particular methyl methacrylate, C1-C8-alkyl acrylate, in particular methyl acrylate, maleic anhydride, C1-C4-alkyl- or -phenyl-N-substituted maleimides or mixtures of these compounds onB.2) from 5 to 95 parts by weight, preferably from 20 to 70 parts by weight, of a rubber-containing graft base. The graft base preferably has a glass transition temperature below −10° C. Unless indicated otherwise in the present invention, glass transition temperatures are determined by means of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) according to standard DIN EN 61006 at a heating rate of 10 K/min with definition of the Tg as the mid-point temperature (tangent method) and nitrogen as protecting gas. Particular preference is given to a graft base based on a polybutadiene rubber. Preferred graft polymers B are, for example, polybutadienes, butadiene/styrene copolymers and acrylate rubbers grafted with styrene and/or acrylonitrile and/or (meth)acrylic acid alkyl esters; that is to say, copolymers of the type described in DE-OS 1 694 173 (=U.S. Pat. No. 3,564,077); polybutadienes, butadiene/styrene or butadiene/acrylonitrile copolymers, polyisobutenes or polyisoprenes grafted with acrylic or methacrylic acid alkyl esters, vinyl acetate, acrylonitrile, styrene and/or alkylstyrenes, as are described, for example, in DE-OS 2 348 377 (=U.S. Pat. No. 3,919,353). Particularly preferred graft polymers B are graft polymers obtainable by graft reaction of I. from 10 to 70 wt. %, preferably from 15 to 50 wt. %, in particular from 20 to 40 wt. %, based on graft product, of at least one (meth)acrylic acid ester or from 10 to 70 wt. %, preferably from 15 to 50 wt. %, in particular from 20 to 40 wt. %, of a mixture of from 10 to 50 wt. %, preferably from 20 to 35 wt. %, based on the mixture, of acrylonitrile or (meth)acrylic acid ester and from 50 to 90 wt. %, preferably from 65 to 80 wt. %, based on the mixture, of styrene onII. from 30 to 90 wt. %, preferably from 40 to 85 wt. %, in particular from 50 to 80 wt. %, based on graft product, of a butadiene polymer having at least 50 wt. %, based on II, butadiene radicals as graft base. According to the invention, most particular preference is given to the use of ABS (acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene) as the graft polymer. The gel content of this graft base II is preferably at least 70 wt. % (measured in toluene), the degree of grafting G is from 0.15 to 0.55 and the mean particle diameter d50 of the graft polymer B is from 0.05 to 2 μm, preferably from 0.1 to 0.6 μm. (Meth)acrylic acid esters I are esters of acrylic acid or methacrylic acid and monohydric alcohols having from 1 to 18 carbon atoms. Methacrylic acid methyl esters, ethyl esters and propyl esters are particularly preferred. As well as comprising butadiene radicals, the graft base II can comprise up to 50 wt. %, based on II, of radicals of other ethylenically unsaturated monomers, such as styrene, acrylonitrile, esters of acrylic or methacrylic acid having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms in the alcohol component (such as methyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate, methyl methacrylate, ethyl methacrylate), vinyl esters and/or vinyl ethers. The preferred graft base II consists of pure polybutadiene. Because, as is known, the graft monomers are not necessarily grafted completely onto the graft base during the graft reaction, graft polymers B are also understood according to the invention as being those products that are obtained by polymerisation of the graft monomers in the presence of the graft base. The degree of grafting G denotes the weight ratio of grafted graft monomers to the graft base and is dimensionless. The mean particle size d50 is the diameter above and below which in each case 50 wt. % of the particles lie. It can be determined by means of ultracentrifuge measurements (W. Scholtan, H. Lange, Kolloid, Z. und Z. Polymere 250 (1972), 782-796). Further preferred graft polymers B are, for example, also graft polymers of (a) from 20 to 90 wt. %, based on B, of acrylate rubber as graft base and(b) from 10 to 80 wt. %, based on B, of at least one polymerisable, ethylenically unsaturated monomer, the homo- or co-polymers of which, formed in the absence of a), would have a glass transition temperature above 25° C., as graft monomers. The graft base of acrylate rubber preferably has a glass transition temperature of less than −20° C., preferably less than −30° C. The acrylate rubbers (a) of the polymers B are preferably polymers of acrylic acid alkyl esters, optionally with up to 40 wt. %, based on (a), of other polymerisable, ethylenically unsaturated monomers. The preferred polymerisable acrylic acid esters include C1-C8-alkyl esters, for example methyl, ethyl, n-butyl, n-octyl and 2-ethylhexyl ester, and mixtures of these monomers. For crosslinking, monomers with more than one polymerisable double bond can be copolymerised. Preferred examples of crosslinking monomers are esters of unsaturated monocarboxylic acids having from 3 to 8 carbon atoms and unsaturated monohydric alcohols having from 3 to 12 carbon atoms, or saturated polyols having from 2 to 4 OH groups and from 2 to 20 carbon atoms, such as, for example, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate, allyl methacrylate; polyunsaturated heterocyclic compounds, such as, for example, trivinyl and triallyl cyanurate; polyfunctional vinyl compounds, such as di- and tri-vinylbenzenes; but also triallyl phosphate and diallyl phthalate. Preferred crosslinking monomers are allyl methacrylate, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate, diallyl phthalate and heterocyclic compounds which contain at least 3 ethylenically unsaturated groups. Particularly preferred crosslinking monomers are the cyclic monomers triallyl cyanurate, triallyl isocyanurate, trivinyl cyanurate, triacryloylhexahydro-s-triazine, triallylbenzenes. The amount of crosslinking monomers is preferably from 0.02 to 5 wt. %, in particular from 0.05 to 2 wt. %, based on graft base (a). In the case of cyclic crosslinking monomers having at least 3 ethylenically unsaturated groups, it is advantageous to limit the amount to less than 1 wt. % of the graft base (a). Preferred “other” polymerisable, ethylenically unsaturated monomers which can optionally be used in addition to the acrylic acid esters for preparing the graft base (a) are, for example, acrylonitrile, styrene, α-methylstyrene, acrylamides, vinyl C1-C6-alkyl ethers, methyl methacrylate, butadiene.

The oligomer compositions of the phosphazenes in the blend samples can also be detected and quantified, after compounding, by means of 31P NMR (chemical shift; 8 trimer: 6.5 to 10.0 ppm; 6 tetramer: −10 to −13.5 ppm; 6 higher oligomers: −16.5 to −25.0 ppm). COMPONENT D Component D comprises one or more thermoplastic vinyl (co)polymers or polyalkylene terephthalates. Suitable as vinyl (co)polymers D are polymers of at least one monomer from the group of the vinyl aromatic compounds, vinyl cyanides (unsaturated nitriles), (meth)acrylic acid (C1-C8)-alkyl esters, unsaturated carboxylic acids and derivatives (such as anhydrides and imides) of unsaturated carboxylic acids. Particularly suitable are (co)polymers of D.1 from 50 to 99 parts by weight, preferably from 60 to 80 parts by weight, of vinyl aromatic compounds and/or vinyl aromatic compounds substituted on the ring (such as styrene, α-methylstyrene, p-methylstyrene, p-chlorostyrene) and/or (meth)acrylic acid (C1-C8)-alkyl esters (such as methyl methacrylate, ethyl methacrylate), andD.2 from 1 to 50 parts by weight, preferably from 20 to 40 parts by weight, of vinyl cyanides (unsaturated nitriles), such as acrylonitrile and methacrylonitrile, and/or (meth)acrylic acid (C1-C8)-alkyl esters, such as methyl methacrylate, n-butyl acrylate, tert-butyl acrylate, and/or unsaturated carboxylic acids, such as maleic acid, and/or derivatives, such as anhydrides and imides, of unsaturated carboxylic acids (for example maleic anhydride and N-phenylmaleimide). The vinyl (co)polymers D are resin-like, thermoplastic and rubber-free. Particular preference is given to the copolymer of D. 1 styrene and D.2 acrylonitrile. The (co)polymers according to D are known and can be prepared by radical polymerisation, in particular by emulsion, suspension, solution or mass polymerisation. The (co)polymers preferably have mean molecular weights Mw (weight-average, determined by light scattering or sedimentation) of from 15,000 to 200,000 g/mol, particularly preferably from 100,000 to 150,000 g/mol. In a particularly preferred embodiment, D is a copolymer of 77 wt. % styrene and 23 wt. % acrylonitrile with a weight-average molecular weight Mw of 130,000 g/mol. Suitable as component D the compositions comprise according to the invention one or a mixture of two or more different polyalkylene terephthalates. Polyalkylene terephthalates within the scope of the invention are polyalkylene terephthalates which are derived from terephthalic acid (or reactive derivatives, e.g. dimethyl esters or anhydrides, thereof) and alkanediols, cycloaliphatic or araliphatic diols and mixtures thereof, for example based on propylene glycol, butanediol, pentanediol, hexanediol, 1,2-cyclohexanediol, 1,4-cyclohexanediol, 1,3-cyclohexanediol and cyclohexyldimethanol, wherein the diol component according to the invention contains more than 2 carbon atoms. Accordingly, there are used as component D preferably polybutylene terephthalate and/or polytrimethylene terephthalate, most preferably polybutylene terephthalate. The polyalkylene terephthalates according to the invention can comprise as the monomer of the diacid also up to 5 wt. % isophthalic acid. Preferred polyalkylene terephthalates can be prepared by known methods from terephthalic acid (or reactive derivatives thereof) and aliphatic or cycloaliphatic diols having from 3 to 21 carbon atoms (Kunststoff-Handbuch, Vol. VIII, p. 695 ff, Karl-Hanser-Verlag, Munich 1973). Preferred polyalkylene terephthalates comprise at least 80 mol %, preferably at least 90 mol %, based on the diol component, 1,3-propanediol and/or 1,4-butanediol radicals. As well as comprising terephthalic acid radicals, the preferred polyalkylene terephthalates can comprise up to 20 mol % of radicals of other aromatic dicarboxylic acids having from 8 to 14 carbon atoms or of aliphatic dicarboxylic acids having from 4 to 12 carbon atoms, such as radicals of phthalic acid, isophthalic acid, naphthalene-2,6-dicarboxylic acid, 4,4′-diphenyldicarboxylic acid, succinic acid, adipic acid, sebacic acid, azelaic acid, cyclohexanediacetic acid, cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid. As well as comprising 1,3-propanediol or 1,4-butanediol radicals, the preferred polyalkylene terephthalates can comprise up to 20 mol % of other aliphatic diols having from 3 to 12 carbon atoms or cycloaliphatic diols having from 6 to 21 carbon atoms, for example radicals of 1,3-propanediol, 2-ethyl-1,3-propanediol, neopentyl glycol, 1,5-pentanediol, 1,6-hexanediol, cyclohexane-1,4-dimethanol, 3-methyl-2,4-pentanediol, 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol, 2,2,4-trimethyl-1,3-pentanediol and 2-ethyl-1,6-hexanediol, 2,2-diethyl-1,3-propanediol, 2,5-hexanediol, 1,4-di-(β-hydroxyethoxy)-benzene, 2,2-bis-(4-hydroxycyclohexyl)-propane, 2,4-dihydroxy-1,1,3,3-tetra-methyl-cyclobutane, 2,2-bis-(3-β-hydroxyethoxyphenyl)-propane and 2,2-bis-(4-hydroxypropoxy-phenyl)-propane (DE-A 24 07 674, 24 07 776, 27 15 932). The polyalkylene terephthalates can be branched by incorporation of relatively small amounts of tri- or tetra-hydric alcohols or tri- or tetra-basic carboxylic acids, as are described, for example, in DE-A 19 00 270 and U.S. Pat. No. 3,692,744. Examples of preferred branching agents are trimesic acid, trimellitic acid, trimethylol-ethane and -propane and pentaerythritol. It is advisable to use not more than 1 mol % of the branching agent, based on the acid component. Particular preference is given to polyalkylene terephthalates that have been prepared solely from terephthalic acid or reactive derivatives thereof (e.g. dialkyl esters thereof, such as dimethyl terephthalate) and 1,3-propanediol and/or 1,4-butanediol (polypropylene and polybutylene terephthalate) and mixtures of such polyalkylene terephthalates. Preferred polyalkylene terephthalates are also copolyesters prepared from at least two of the above-mentioned acid components and/or from at least two of the above-mentioned alcohol components, particularly preferred copolyesters are poly-(1,3-propylene glycol/1,4-butanediol) terephthalates. The polyalkylene terephthalates generally have an intrinsic viscosity of approximately from 0.4 to 1.5 dl/g, preferably from 0.5 to 1.3 dl/g, in each case measured in phenol/o-dichlorobenzene (1:1 parts by weight) at 25° C. In an alternative embodiment, the polyesters prepared according to the invention can also be used in admixture with other polyesters and/or further polymers, preference being given here to the use of mixtures of polyalkylene terephthalates with other polyesters. COMPONENT E Talc is understood as being a naturally occurring or a synthetically prepared talc. Pure talc has the chemical composition 3 MgO.4 SiO2.H2O and accordingly has an MgO content of 31.9 wt. %, an SiO2 content of 63.4 wt. % and a content of chemically bonded water of 4.8 wt. %. It is a silicate having a layered structure. Naturally occurring talc materials generally do not have the ideal composition mentioned above, since they are rendered impure by the partial replacement of the magnesium by other elements, by the partial replacement of silicon by, for example, aluminium, and/or by intergrowths with other minerals such as, for example, dolomite, magnesite and chlorite. The particular types of talc within the scope of the invention are distinguished by a particularly high purity, characterised by an MgO content of from 28 to 35 wt. %, preferably from 30 to 33 wt. %, particularly preferably from 30.5 to 32 wt. %, and an SiO2 content of from 55 to 65 wt. %, in particular from 58 to 64 wt. %, particularly preferably from 60 to 62.5 wt. %. Preferred types of talc are further distinguished by an Al2O3 content of less than 5 wt. %, particularly preferably less than 1 wt. %, in particular less than 0.7 wt. %. A commercially available type of talc which corresponds to this definition is, for example, Luzenac®3CA from Luzenac Naintsch Mineralwerke GmbH (Graz, Austria). Types of talc which are not within the scope of the invention are, for example, Luzenac SE-Standard, Luzenac SE-Super, Luzenac SE-Micro and Luzenac ST 10, 15, 20, 30 and 60, all of which are marketed by Luzenac Naintsch Mineralwerke GmbH. The use of the talc according to the invention in the form of finely ground types having a mean particle size d50 of from 0.1 to 4.0 μm, preferably from 0.2 to 3.0 μm, particularly preferably from 0.5 to 2.5 μm, most particularly preferably from 0.7 to 1.8 μm, is particularly advantageous. The mean particle size d50 is the diameter above and below which in each case 50 wt. % of the particles lie. It is also possible to use mixtures of talc types that differ in their mean particle sizes d50. The talc can be surface-treated, for example silanised, in order to ensure better compatibility with the polymer. In view of the processing and production of the moulding compositions, the use of compacted talc is also advantageous. Further Additives F The composition can comprise further conventional polymer additives, such as flame-retardant synergists other than antidripping agents, lubricants and demoulding agents (for example pentaerythritol tetrastearate), nucleating agents, stabilisers (for example UV/light stabilisers, heat stabilisers, antioxidants, transesterification inhibitors, hydrolytic stabilisers), antistatics (for example conductive blacks, carbon fibres, carbon nanotubes as well as organic antistatics such as polyalkylene ethers, alkyl sulfonates or polyamide-containing polymers) as well as colourants, pigments, fillers and reinforcing materials, in particular glass fibres, mineral reinforcing materials and carbon fibres. There are preferably used as stabilisers sterically hindered phenols and phosphites or mixtures thereof, such as, for example, Irganox® B900 (Ciba Speciality Chemicals). Pentaerythritol tetrastearate is preferably used as the demoulding agent. Carbon black is further preferably used as a black pigment (e.g. Blackpearls). As well as comprising optional further additives, particularly preferred moulding compositions comprise as component F a demoulding agent, particularly preferably pentaerythritol tetrastearate, in an amount of from 0.1 to 1.5 parts by weight, preferably from 0.2 to 1.0 part by weight, particularly preferably from 0.3 to 0.8 part by weight. As well as comprising optional further additives, particularly preferred moulding compositions comprise as component F at least one stabiliser, for example selected from the group of the sterically hindered phenols, phosphites and mixtures thereof and particularly preferably Irganox® B900, in an amount of from 0.01 to 0.5 part by weight, preferably from 0.03 to 0.4 part by weight, particularly preferably from 0.06 to 0.3 part by weight. The combination of PTFE (component G), pentaerythritol tetrastearate and Irganox B900 with a phosphorus-based flame retardant as component C) is also particularly preferred. COMPONENT G There are used as antidripping agents in particular polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) or PTFE-containing compositions such as, for example, masterbatches of PTFE with styrene- or methyl-methacrylate-containing polymers or copolymers, in the form of powders or in the form of a coagulated mixture, for example with component B. The fluorinated polyolefins used as antidripping agents have a high molecular weight and have glass transition temperatures of over −30° C., generally over 100° C., fluorine contents of preferably from 65 to 76 wt. %, in particular from 70 to 76 wt. %, mean particle diameters d50 of from 0.05 to 1000 μm, preferably from 0.08 to 20 μm. In general, the fluorinated polyolefins have a density of from 1.2 to 2.3 g/cm3. Preferred fluorinated polyolefins are polytetrafluoroethylene, polyvinylidene fluoride, tetrafluoroethylene/hexafluoropropylene and ethylene/tetrafluoroethylene copolymers. The fluorinated polyolefins are known (see “Vinyl and Related Polymers” by Schildknecht, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, 1962, pages 484-494; “Fluorpolymers” by Wall, Wiley-Interscience, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, Volume 13, 1970, pages 623-654; “Modern Plastics Encyclopedia”, 1970-1971, Volume 47, No. 10 A, October 1970, McGraw-Hill, Inc., New York, pages 134 and 774; “Modern Plastics Encyclopedia”, 1975-1976, October 1975, Volume 52, No. 10 A, McGraw-Hill, Inc., New York, pages 27, 28 and 472 and U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,671,487, 3,723,373 and 3,838,092). They can be prepared by known processes, for example by polymerisation of tetrafluoroethylene in an aqueous medium with a free-radical-forming catalyst, for example sodium, potassium or ammonium peroxodisulfate, at pressures of from 7 to 71 kg/cm2 and at temperatures of from 0 to 200° C., preferably at temperatures of from 20 to 100° C. (For further details see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 2,393,967.) Depending on the form in which they are used, the density of these materials can be from 1.2 to 2.3 g/cm3, and the mean particle size can be from 0.05 to 1000 μm. The fluorinated polyolefins that are preferred according to the invention have mean particle diameters of from 0.05 to 20 μm, preferably from 0.08 to 10 μm, and density of from 1.2 to 1.9 g/cm3. Suitable fluorinated polyolefins G which can be used in powder form are tetrafluoroethylene polymers having mean particle diameters of from 100 to 1000 μm and densities of from 2.0 g/cm3 to 2.3 g/cm3. Suitable tetrafluoroethylene polymer powders are commercial products and are supplied, for example, by DuPont under the trade name Teflon®. As well as comprising optional further additives, particularly preferred flame-retardant compositions comprise as component G a fluorinated polyolefin in an amount of from 0.05 to 5.0 parts by weight, preferably from 0.1 to 2.0 parts by weight, particularly preferably from 0.3 to 1.0 part by weight.

COMPONENT G Polytetrafluoroethylene powder, CFP 6000 N, Du Pont COMPONENT H Bisphenol-A-based oligophosphate having a phosphorus content of 8.9%. Preparation and Testing of the Moulding Compositions The substances listed in Table 1 are compounded at a speed of 225 rpm and with a throughput of 20 kg/h, at a machine temperature of 260° C., on a twin-screw extruder (ZSK-25) (Werner und Pfleiderer) and granulated. The finished granules are processed on an injection-moulding machine to the corresponding test specimens (melt temperature 260° C., tool temperature 80° C., flow front speed 240 mm/s). In order to characterise the properties of the materials, the following methods were used: The IZOD notched impact strength was measured in accordance with ISO 180/1A on test bars of dimensions 80 mm×10 mm×4 mm overmoulded on one side. The behaviour in fire is measured in accordance with UL 94V on bars measuring 127×12.7×1.5 mm. The tensile modulus of elasticity was determined in accordance with ISO 527 on shouldered test bars measuring 170 mm×10 mm×4 mm. The heat distortion resistance was measured in accordance with ISO 306 (Vicat softening temperature, method B with 50 N load and a heating rate of 120 K/h) on test bars of dimensions 80 mm×10 mm×4 mm overmoulded on one side. The melt flowability was evaluated on the basis of the melt volume-flow rate (MVR) measured in accordance with ISO 1133 at a temperature of 240° C. and with a die load of 5 kg. It is clear from Table 1 that the compositions of Examples 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 with variable amounts of impact modifier and talc in the mixture achieve the object according to the invention, that is to say have a combination of unexpectedly high notched impact strength, temperature stability, modulus of elasticity with a UL94V-0 classification at 1.5 mm.
