BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Polyolefms such as high density polyethylene (HDPE) homopolymer and linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE) copolymer can be produced using various combinations of catalyst systems and polymerization processes. In some end-use applications, it can be beneficial for the catalyst system employed to facilitate efficient incorporation of a comonomer during polymerization to produce lower density copolymers. In other end-use applications, it can be beneficial to produce high melt flow homopolymers having lower densities. Accordingly, it is to these ends that the present invention is directed. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIO This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the detailed description. This summary is not intended to identify required or essential features of the claimed subject matter. Nor is this summary intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter. The present invention generally relates to new catalyst compositions, methods for preparing catalyst compositions, methods for using the catalyst compositions to polymerize olefins, the polymer resins produced using such catalyst compositions, and articles produced using these polymer resins. In particular, the present invention relates to boron-bridged metallocene compounds containing an alkenyl substituent, and to catalyst compositions employing such metallocene compounds. Catalyst compositions of the present invention that contain these boron-bridged metallocene compounds can be used to produce, for example, etliyiene-based homopolymers and copolymers. In accordance with an aspect of the present invention, disclosed and described herein are boron-bridged metallocene compounds having the formula: ,Α R R' In formula (I), M can be Ti, Zr, or Hf; each X independently can be a monoanionic ligand; and each R independently can be H, a Cj to C36 hydrocarbyl group, or a Ci to C3& hydrocarbylsilyl group. CpA can be a cyclopentadienyl group with an alkenyl substituent, and Cprf can be an indenyl group; or CpA can be an indenyl group with an alkenyl substituent, and CpB can be a cyclopentadienyl group. Catalyst compositions containing the boron-bridged metaliocene compounds of formula (Ϊ) also are provided by the present invention. In one aspect, a catalyst composition is disclosed which comprises a boron-bridged metaliocene compound of formula (1) and an activator. Optionally, this catalyst composition can further comprise a co-catalyst, such as an organoaluminum compound. In some aspects, the activator can comprise an activator-support, while in other aspects, the activator can comprise an aiuminoxane compound, an organoboron or organoborate compound, an ionizing ionic compound, or combinations thereof. The present invention also contemplates and encompasses olefin polymerization processes. Such processes can comprise contacting a catalyst composition with an olefin monomer and optionally an olefin comonomer in a polymerization reactor system under polymerization conditions to produce an olefin polymer. Generally, the catalyst composition employed can comprise any of the boron-bridged metaliocene compounds disclosed herein and any of the activators disclosed herein. Further, organoaluminum compounds or other co-catalysts also can be utilized in the catalyst compositions and/or polymerization processes. Polymers produced from the polymerization of olefins, resulting in homopolymers, copolymers, terpolymers, etc., can be used to produce various articles of manufacture. A representative and non-limiting example of an olefin polymer - in this case, an ethylene bomopolymer - consistent with aspects of this invention can be characterized as having the following properties: a melt index greater than or equal to about 50 g/10 min, and a density of less than or equal to about 0.970 g/cnr . Another representative and non-limiting ethylene homopolymer described herein can have a melt index in a range from about 100 to about 1000 g/10 min (or from about 150 to about 750 g/10 min), and a density in a range from about 0.960 to about 0.968 g/cm3 (or from about 0,960 to about 0.965 g cm3). These homopolymers, in further aspects, can be characterized by low levels of long chain branches (LCB) and/or by a unimodal molecular weight distribution. Both the foregoing summary and the following detailed description provide examples and are explanatory only. Accordingly, the foregoing summary and the following detailed description should not be considered to be restrictive.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURE The figure presents a plot of the molecular weight distributions of the polymers of Examples 4-7. DEFINITIONS To define more clearly the terms used herein, the following definitions are provided. Unless otherwise indicated, the following definitions are applicable to this disclosure. If a term is used in this disclosure but is not specifically defined herein, the definition from the IUPAC Compendium of Chemical Terminology, 2nd Ed (1997), can be applied, as long as that definition does not conflict with any other disclosure or definition applied herein, or render indefinite or non-enabled any claim to which that definition is applied. To the extent that any definition or usage provided by any document incorporated herein by reference conflicts with the definition or usage provided herein, the definition or usage provided herein controls. While compositions and methods are described herein in terms of "comprising" various components or steps, the compositions and methods can also "consist essentially of or "consist of the various components or steps, unless stated otherwise. For example, a catalyst composition consistent with aspects of the present invention can comprise; alternatively, can consist essentially of; or alternatively, can consist of; (i) a boron bridged metallocene compound, (ii) an activator, and (iii) optionally, a co- catalyst. The terms "a," "an," "the," etc., are intended to include plural alternatives, e.g., at least one, unless otherwise specified. For instance, the disclosure of "an activator- support" or "a metallocene compound" is meant to encompass one, or mixtures or combinations of more than one, activator-support or metallocene compound, respectively, unless otherwise specified. Generally, groups of elements are indicated using the numbering scheme indicated in the version of the periodic table of elements published in Chemical and Engineering News, 63(5), 27, 1985. In some instances, a group of elements can be indicated using a common name assigned to the group; for example, alkali metals for Group 1 elements, alkaline earth metals for Group 2 elements, transition metals for Group 3-12, elements, and halogens or halides for Group 17 elements. For any particular compound disclosed herein, the general structure or name presented is also intended to encompass all structural isomers, conformational isomers, and stereoisomers that can arise from a particular set of substituents, unless indicated otherwise. Thus, a general reference to a compound includes all structural isomers unless explicitly indicated otherwise; e.g., a general reference to pentane includes n- pentane, 2-methyl-butane, and 2,2-dimethylpropane, while a general reference to a butyl group includes an n-butyl group, a sec -butyl group, an iso-butyl group, and a tert- butyi group. Additionally, the reference to a general structure or name encompasses all enantiomers, diastereomers, and other optical isomers whether in enantiomeric or racemic forms, as well as mixtures of stereoisomers, as the context permits or requires. For any particular formula or name that is presented, any general formula or name presented also encompasses ail conformational isomers, regioisomers, and stereoisomers that can arise from a particular set of substituents. The term "substituted" when used to describe a group, for example, when referring to a substituted analog of a particular group, is intended to describe any non- hydrogen moiety that formally replaces a hydrogen in that group, and is intended to be non-limiting. A group or groups can also be referred to herein as "unsubstituted" or by equivalent terms such as "non-substituted," which refers to the original group in which a non-hydrogen moiety does not replace a hydrogen within that group. Unless otherwise specified, "substituted" is intended to be non-limiting and include inorganic substituents or organic substituents as understood by one of ordinary skill in the art. The term "hydrocarbon" whenever used in this specification and claims refers to a compound containing only carbon and hydrogen. Other identifiers can be utilized to indicate the presence of particular groups in the hydrocarbon (e.g., halogenated hydrocarbon indicates the presence of one or more halogen atoms replacing an equivalent number of hydrogen atoms in the hydrocarbon). The term "hydrocarbyi group" is used herein in accordance with the definition specified by IUPAC: a univalent group formed by removing a hydrogen atom from a hydrocarbon (that is, a group containing only carbon and hydrogen). Non -limiting examples of hydrocarbyi groups include alkyl, alkenyl, aryl, and aralkyl groups, amongst other groups. The term "polymer" is used herein generically to include olefin homopolymers, copolymers, terpolymers, and so forth. A copolymer is derived from an olefin monomer and one olefin comonomer, while a terpolymer is derived from an olefin monomer and two olefin comonomers. Accordingly, "polymer" encompasses copolymers, terpolymers, etc., derived from any olefin monomer and comonomer(s) disclosed herein. Similarly, an ethylene polymer would include ethylene homopolymers, ethylene copolymers, ethylene terpolymers, and the like. As an example, an olefin copolymer, such as an ethylene copolymer, can be derived from ethylene and a comonomer, such as 1-butene, 1-hexene, or 1-octene. If the monomer and comonomer were ethylene and 1-hexene, respectively, the resulting polymer can be categorized an as ethylene/ 1-hexene copolymer. In like manner, the scope of the term "polymerization" includes hom.opolym.eri.zat.ion, copolymerization, terpolymerization, etc. Therefore, a copolymerization process can involve contacting one olefin monomer (e.g., ethylene) and one olefin comonomer (e.g., 1-hexene) to produce a copolymer. The term "co-catalyst" is used generally herein to refer to compounds such as aluminoxane compounds, organoboron or organoborate compounds, ionizing ionic compounds, organoaluminum compounds, organozinc compounds, organomagnesium compounds, organolithium compounds, and the like, that can constitute one component of a. catalyst composition, when used, for example, in addition to an activator-support. The term "co-catalyst" is used regardless of the actual function of the compound or any chemical mec anism by which the compound may operate. The terms "chemically-treated solid oxide," "treated solid oxide compound," and the like, are used herein to indicate a solid, inorganic oxide of relatively high porosity, which can exhibit Lewis acidic or Bronsted acidic behavior, and which has been treated with an electro -withdrawing component, typically an anion, and which is calcined. The electron-withdrawing component is typically an electron-withdrawing anion source compound. Thus, the chemically-treated solid oxide can comprise a calcined contact product of at least one solid oxide with at least one electron- withdrawing anion source compound. Typically, the chemically-treated solid oxide comprises at least one acidic solid oxide compound. The "activator-support" of the present invention can be a chemically-treated solid oxide. The terms "support" and "activator-support" are not used to imply these components are inert, and such components should not be construed as an inert component of the catalyst composition. The term "activator," as used herein, refers generally to a substance that is capable of converting a metallocene component into a catalyst that can polymerize olefins, or converting a contact product of a metallocene component and a component that provides an activatabie ligand (e.g., an alkyl, a hydride) to the metallocene, when the metallocene compound does not already comprise such a ligand, into a catalyst that can polymerize olefins. This term is used regardless of the actual activating mechanism. Illustrative activators include activator-supports, aiuminoxanes, organoboron or organoborate compounds, ionizing ionic compounds, and the like. Aiuminoxanes, organoboron or organoborate compounds, and ionizing ionic compounds generally are referred to as activators if used in a catalyst composition in which an activator-support is not present. If the catalyst composition contains an activator-support, then the aluminoxane, organoboron or organoborate, and ionizing ionic materials are typically referred to as co-catalysts. The term "metallocene" as used herein describes compounds comprising at least one η3 to i]5-cyc3oalkadienyl-type moiety, wherein η3 to r]5-cycloalkadienyl moieties include cyclopentadienyl iigands, indenyl iigands, fluorenyl iigands, and the like, including partially saturated or substituted derivatives or analogs of any of these. Possible substituents on these Iigands may include H, therefore this invention comprises iigands such as tetrahydroindenyl, tetrahydrofluorenyl, oetahydrofiuorenyl, partially saturated indenyl, partially saturated tluorenyl, substituted partially saturated indenyl, substituted partially saturated fiuorenyl, and the like. In some contexts, the metallocene is referred to simply as the "catalyst," in much the same way the term "co- catalyst" is used herein to refer to, for example, an organoaluminum compound. The terms "catalyst composition," "catalyst mixture," "catalyst system," and the like, do not depend upon the actual product or composition resulting from the contact or reaction of the initial components of the disclosed or claimed catalyst composition/mixture/system, the nature of the active catalytic site, or the fate of the co- catalyst, the metallocene compound(s), or the activator (e.g., activator-support), after combining these components. Therefore, the terms "catalyst composition," "catalyst mixture," "catalyst system," and the like, encompass the initial starting components of the composition, as well as whatever product(s) may result from contacting these initial starting components, and this is inclusive of both heterogeneous and homogenous catalyst systems or compositions. The terms "catalyst composition," "catalyst mixture," "catalyst system," and the like, can be used interchangeably throughout this disclosure. The term "contact product" is used herein to describe compositions wherein the components are contacted together in any order, in any manner, and for any length of time. For example, the components can be contacted by blending or mixing. Further, contacting of any component can occur in the presence or absence of any other component of the compositions described herein. Combining additional materials or components can be done by any suitable method. Further, the term "contact product" includes mixtures, blends, solutions, slurries, reaction products, and the like, or combinations thereof. Although "contact product" can include reaction products, it is not required for the respective components to react with one another. Similarly, the term "contacting" is used herein to refer to materials which can be blended, mixed, slurried, dissolved, reacted, treated, or otherwise contacted in some other manner. Although any methods, devices, and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice or testing of the invention, the typical methods, devices and materials are herein described. All publications and patents mentioned herein are incorporated herein by reference for the purpose of describing and disclosing, for example, the constructs and methodologies that are described in the publications, which might be used in connection with the presently described invention. The publications discussed throughout the text are provided solely for their disclosure prior to the filing date of the present application. Nothing herein is to be construed as an admission that the inventors are not entitled to antedate such disclosure by virtue of prior invention. Applicants disclose several types of ranges in the present invention. When Applicants disclose or claim a range of any type, Applicants' intent is to disclose or claim individually each possible number that such a range could reasonably encompass, including end points of the range as well as any sub-ranges and combinations of subranges encompassed therein. For example, when the Applicants disclose or claim a chemical moiety having a certain number of carbon atoms, Applicants' intent is to disclose or claim individually every possible number that such a range could encompass, consistent with the disclosure herein. For example, the disclosure that a moiety is a Q to Cs g hydrocarbyl group, or in alternative language, a hydrocarbyl group having from 1 to 18 carbon atoms, as used herein, refers to a moiety that can have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 1 1, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, or 18 carbon atoms, as well as any range between these two numbers (for example, a Ci to Cg hydrocarbyl group), and also including any combination of ranges between these two numbers (for example, a (¼ to C4 and a Cj ? to C½ hydrocarbyl group). Similarly, another representative example follows for the melt index (in g<'10 min) of a homopolymer produced in an aspect of this invention. By a disclosure that the MI can be in a range from about 100 to about 1000, Applicants intend to recite that the MI can be any melt index in the range and, for example, can be equal to about 100, about 200, about 300, about 400, about 500, about 600, about 700, about 800, about 900, or about 1000 g/10 min. Additionally, the MI can be within any range from about 100 to about 1000 (for example, from about 150 to about 750), and this also includes any combination of ranges between about 100 and about 1000 (for example, the MI can be in a range from about 100 to about 250, or from about 400 to about 700), Likewise, all other ranges disclosed herein should be interpreted in a manner similar to these examples. Applicants reserve the right to proviso out or exclude any individual members of any such group, including any sub-ranges or combinations of sub-ranges within the group, that can be claimed according to a range or in any similar manner, if for any reason Applicants choose to claim less than the full measure of the disclosure, for example, to account for a reference that Applicants may be unaware of at the time of the filing of the application. Further, Applicants reserve the right to proviso out or exclude any individual substituents, analogs, compounds, ligands, structures, or groups thereof, or any members of a claimed group, if for any reason Applicants choose to claim less than the full measure of the disclosure, for example, to account for a reference that Applicants may be unaware of at the time of the filing of the application.

OLEFIN MONOMERS Unsaturated reactants that can be employed with catalyst compositions and polymerization processes of this invention typically can include olefin compounds having from 2 to 30 carbon atoms per molecule and having at least one olefmic double bond. This invention encompasses homopolymerization processes using a single olefin such as ethylene or propylene, as well as copoiyrnerization, terpolymerization, etc., reactions using an olefin monomer with at least one different olefmic compound. For example, the resultant ethylene copolymers, terpolymers, etc., generally can contain a. major amount of ethylene (>50 mole percent) and a minor amount of comonomer (<50 mole percent), though this is not a requirement. Comonomers that can be copolymenzed with ethylene often can have from 3 to 20 carbon atoms, or from 3 to 10 carbon atoms, in their molecular chain. Acyclic, cyclic, polycyclic, terminal (a), internal, linear, branched, substituted, unsubstituted, functionalized, and non-functionalized olefins can be employed in this invention. For example, typical unsaturated compounds that can be polymerized with the catalyst compositions of this invention can include, but are not limited to, ethylene, propylene, 1 -butene, 2-butene, 3-rnethyl-l-butene, isobutylene, 1-pentene, 2-pentene, 3 -methyl- 1 -pentene, 4-methyl- 1 -pentene, l-hexene, 2-hexene, 3-hexene, 3 -ethyl- 1- hexene, l -heptene, 2-heptene, 3-heptene, the four normal octenes (e.g., 1-octene), the four normal nonenes, the five normal decenes, and the like, or mixtures of two or more of these compounds. Cyclic and bicyclic olefins, including but not limited to, cyclopentene, cyclohexene, norboniylene, norbomadiene, and the like, also can be polymerized as described herein. Styrene can also be employed as a monomer in the present invention. In an aspect, the olefin monomer can comprise a C2-C2o olefin; alternatively, a C2-C20 alpha-olefin; alternatively, a C2-Cio olefin; alternatively, a C2- C10 alpha-olefm; alternatively, the olefin monomer can comprise ethylene; or alternatively, the olefin monomer can comprise propylene. When a copolymer (or alternatively, a terpolymer) is desired, the olefin monomer and the olefin comonomer independently can comprise, for example, a C2- C?o alpha-olefin. In some aspects, the olefin monomer can comprise ethylene or propylene, which is copolymerized with at least one comonomer (e.g., a C2-C20 alpha- olefm, a C3-C20 alpha-olefm, etc.). According to one aspect of this invention, the olefin monomer used in the polymerization process can comprise ethylene. In this aspect, examples of suitable olefin comonomers can include, but are not limited to, propylene, 1 -butene, 2-butene, 3-methyl-l-butene, isobutylene, 1-pentene, 2-pentene, 3-methyl-l - pentene, 4-methyi-l-pentene, l-hexene, 2-hexene, 3 -ethyl- l -hexene, l-heptene, 2- heptene, 3-heptene, 1-octene, 1 -decene, styrene, and the like, or combinations thereof. According to another aspect of the present invention, the olefin monomer can comprise ethylene, and the comonomer can comprise a C3-C10 alpha-olefin; alternatively, the comonomer can comprise 1-butene, 1-pentene, l-hexene, 1-octene, 1-decene, styrene, or any combination thereof; alternatively, the comonomer can comprise 1-butene, 1 - hexene, 1-octene, or any combination thereof; alternatively, the comonomer can comprise 1-butene; alternatively, the comonomer can comprise l-hexene; or alternatively, the comonomer can comprise 1-octene, Generally, the amount of comonomer introduced into a polymerization reactor system to produce a copolymer can be from about 0.01 to about 50 weight percent of the comonomer based on the total weight of the monomer and comonomer. According to another aspect of the present invention, the amount of comonomer introduced into a polymerization reactor system can be from about 0.01 to about 40 weight percent comonomer based on the total weight of the monomer and comonomer. In still another aspect, the amount of comonomer introduced into a polymerization reactor system can be from about 0.1 to about 35 weight percent comonomer based on the total weight of the monomer and comonomer. Yet, in another aspect, the amount of comonomer introduced into a polymerization reactor system can be from about 0.5 to about 20 weight percent comonomer based on the total weight of the monomer and comonomer. While not intending to be bound by this theory, where branched, substituted, or functionalized olefins are used as reactants, it is believed that a steric hindrance can impede and/or slow the polymerization process. Thus, branched and/or cyclic portion(s) of the olefin removed somewhat from the carbon-carbon double bond would not be expected to hinder the reaction in the way that the same olefin substituents situated more proximate to the carbon-carbon double bond might. According to one aspect of the present invention, at least one monomer/reactant can be ethylene (or propylene), so the polymerization reaction can be a homopolymerization involving only ethylene (or propylene), or a copolymerization with a different acyciic, cyclic, terminal, internal, linear, branched, substituted, or unsubstituted olefin. In addition, the catalyst compositions of this invention can be used in the polymerization of diolefm compounds including, but not limited to, 1 ,3- butadiene, isoprene, 1,4-pentadiene, and 1 ,5-hexadiene. CATALYST COMPOSITIONS In some aspects, the present invention employs catalyst compositions containing a boron-bridged, cyclopentadienyf-indenyl metallocene compound and an activator (one or more than one). These catalyst compositions can be utilized to produce polyolefins - homopolymers, copolymers, and the like - for a variety of end-use applications. Boron-bridged metallocene compounds are discussed hereinabove. In aspects of the present invention, it is contemplated that the catalyst composition can contain more than one boron -bridged metallocene compound. Further, additional catalytic compounds - other than those specified as a boron-bridged metallocene compound - cars be employed in the catalyst compositions and/or the polymerization processes, provided that the additional catalytic compound does not detract from the advantages disclosed herein. Additionally, more than one activator also may be utilized. Generally, catalyst compositions of the present invention comprise a boron- bridged metallocene compound having formula (I) and an activator. In aspects of the invention, the activator can comprise an activator-support (e.g., an activator-support comprising a solid oxide treated with an electron-withdrawing anion). Activator- supports useful in the present invention are disclosed herein. Optionally, such catalyst compositions can further comprise one or more than one co-catalyst compound or compounds (suitable co-catalysts, such as organoalumirmm compounds, also are discussed herein). Thus, a catalyst composition of this invention can comprise a boron- bridged metallocene compound, an activator-support, and an organoaluminum compound. For instance, the activator-support can comprise (or consist essentially of, or consist of) fluorided alumina, chlorided alumina, bromided alumina, sulfated alumina, fluorided silica-alumina, chlorided silica-alumina, bromided silica-alumina, sulfated silica-alumina, fluorided silica-zirconia, chlorided silica-zirconia, bromided silica-zirconia, sulfated silica-zirconia, fluorided silica-titania, fluorided silica-coated alumina, sulfated silica-coated alumina, phosphated silica-coated alumina, and the like, or combinations thereof; or alternatively, a fluorided solid oxide and/or a sulfated solid oxide.

In these aspects, the catalyst composition has catalyst activity, discussed below, in the absence of these additional materials. For example, a. catalyst composition of the present invention can consist essentially a boron-bridged metalloceiie compound, an activator-support, and an organoaluminum compound, wherein no other materials are present in the catalyst composition which would increase/decrease the activity of the catalyst composition by more than about 10% from the catalyst activity of the catalyst composition in the absence of said materials. However, in other aspects of this invention, these activators/co-eatalysts can be employed. For example, a catalyst composition comprising a boron-bridged metaliocene compound and an activator-support can further comprise an optional co- catalyst. Suitable co-catalysts in this aspect can include, but are not limited to, aluminoxane compounds, organoboron or organoborate compounds, ionizing ionic compounds, organoaluminum compounds, organozinc compounds, organomagnesium compounds, organolithium compounds, and the like, or any combination thereof; or alternatively, organoaluminum compounds, organozinc compounds, organomagnesium compounds, organolithium compounds, or any combination thereof. More than one co- catalyst can be present in the catalyst composition. In a different aspect, a catalyst composition is provided which does not require an activator-support. Such a catalyst composition can comprise a boron-bridged metaliocene compound and an activator, wherein the activator can comprise an aluminoxane compound, an organoboron or organoborate compound, an ionizing ionic compound, or combinations thereof; alternatively, an aluminoxane compound; alternatively, an organoboron or organoborate compound; or alternatively, an ionizing ionic compound. In a particular aspect contemplated herein, the catalyst composition is a catalyst composition comprising an activator (one or more than one) and only one boron- bridged metaliocene compound having formula (I). In these and other aspects, the catalyst composition can comprise an activator (e.g., an activator-support comprising a solid oxide treated with an electron-withdrawing anion), only one boron-bridged metallocene compound, and a co-catalyst (one or more than one), such as an organoaluminum compound. This invention further encompasses methods of making these catalyst compositions, such as, for example, contacting the respective catalyst components in any order or sequence. In one aspect, the catalyst composition can be produced by a process comprising contacting the metallocene compound and the activator, while in another aspect, the catalyst composition can be produced by a process comprising contacting, in any order, the metallocene compound, the activator, and the co-catalyst. Generally, the weight ratio of organoaluminum compound to activator-support can be in a range from about 10: 1 to about 1 : 1000. If more than one organoaluminum compound and/or more than one activator-support are employed, this ratio is based on the total weight of each respective component. In another aspect, the weight ratio of the organoaluminum compound to the activator-support can be in a range from about 3: 1 to about 1 : 100, or from about 1 : 1 to about 1 :50.

If more than one metallocene compound and/or more than activator-support is/are employed, this ratio is based on the total weights of the respective components. In another aspect, this weight ratio can be in a range from about 1 :5 to about 1 : 100,000, or from about 1 : 10 to about 1 : 10,000. Yet, in another aspect, the weight ratio of the metallocene compound to the activator-support can be in a range from about 1 :20 to about 1 : 1000. Catalyst compositions of the present invention generally have a catalyst activity greater than about 100,000 grams of ethylene polymer (homopoiymer or copolymer, as the context requires) per gram of the boron-bridged metallocene compound per hour (abbreviated g/g/h). In another aspect, the catalyst activity can be greater than about 200,000, greater than about 250,000, or greater than about 300,000 g/g/h.

Additionally, in some aspects, the activator can comprise an activator-support, such as sulfated alumina, fluorided silica-alumina, or fluorided silica-coated alumina, although not limited thereto.

Monomer, diluent, catalyst, and comonomer can be continuously fed to a loop reactor where polymerization occurs. Generally, continuous processes can comprise the continuous introduction of monomer/comonomer, a catalyst, and a diluent into a polymerization reactor and the continuous removal from this reactor of a suspension comprising polymer particles and the diluent. Reactor effluent can be flashed to remove the solid polymer from the liquids that comprise the diluent, monomer and/or comonomer. Various technologies can be used for this separation step including, but not limited to, flashing that can include any combination of heat addition and pressure reduction, separation by cyclonic action in either a cyclone or hydrocycione, or separation by centrifugation. A typical slurry polymerization process (also known as the particle form process) is disclosed, for example, in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,248, 179, 4,501 ,885, 5,565, 175, 5,575,979, 6,239,235, 6,262, 191, and 6,833,415, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Suitable diluents used in slurry polymerization include, but are not limited to, the monomer being polymerized and hydrocarbons that are liquids under polymerization conditions. Examples of suitable diluents include, but are not limited to, hydrocarbons such as propane, cyelohexane, isobutane, n -butane, n-pentane, isopentane, neopentane, and n-hexane. Some loop polymerization reactions can occur under bulk conditions where no diluent is used. An example is polymerization of propylene monomer as disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,455,314, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. According to yet another aspect of this invention, the polymerization reactor system can comprise at least one gas phase reactor. Such systems can employ a continuous recycle stream containing one or more monomers continuously cycled through a fiuidized bed in the presence of the catalyst under polymerization conditions. A recycle stream can be withdrawn from the fluidized bed and recycled back into the reactor. Simultaneously, polymer product can be withdrawn from the reactor and ne or fresh monomer can be added to replace the polymerized monomer. Such gas phase reactors can comprise a process for multi-step gas-phase polymerization of olefins, in which olefins are polymerized in the gaseous phase in at least two independent gas- phase polymerization zones while feeding a catalyst-containing polymer formed in a first polymerization zone to a second polymerization zone. One type of gas phase reactor is disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,352,749, 4,588,790, and 5,436,304, each of which is incorporated by reference in its entirety herein. According to still another aspect of the invention, a high pressure polymerization reactor can comprise a tubular reactor or an autoclave reactor. Tubular reactors can have several zones where fresh monomer, initiators, or catalysts are added. Monomer can be entrained in an inert gaseous stream and introduced at one zone of the reactor. Initiators, catalysts, and/or catalyst components can be entrained in a gaseous stream and introduced at another zone of the reactor. The gas streams can be intermixed for polymerization. Heat and pressure can be employed appropriately to obtain optimal polymerization reaction conditions. According to yet another aspect of the invention, the polymerization reactor system can comprise a solution polymerization reactor wherein the monomer (and comonomer, if used) are contacted with the catalyst composition by suitable stirring or other means, A carrier comprising an inert organic diluent or excess monomer can be employed. If desired, the monomer/comonomer can be brought in the vapor phase into contact with the catalytic reaction product, in the presence or absence of liquid material. The polymerization zone is maintained at temperatures and pressures that will result in the formation of a solution of the polymer in a reaction medium. Agitation can be employed to obtain better temperature control and to maintain uniform polymerization mixtures throughout the polymerization zone. Adequate means are utilized for dissipating the exothermic heat of polymerization. Polymerization reactor systems suitable for the present invention can further comprise any combination of at least one raw material feed system, at least one feed system for catalyst or catalyst components, and/or at least one polymer recovery system. Suitable reactor systems for the present invention can further comprise systems for feedstock purification, catalyst storage and preparation, extrusion, reactor cooling, polymer recover)', fractionation, recycle, storage, loadout, laboratory analysis, and process control. Polymerization conditions that are controlled for efficiency and to provide desired polymer properties can include temperature, pressure, and the concentrations of various reactants. Polymerization temperature can affect catalyst productivity, polymer molecular weight, and molecular weight distribution. A suitable polymerization temperature can be any temperature below the de-polymerization temperature according to the Gibbs Free energy equation. Typically, this includes from about 60 CC to about 280 °C, for example, or from about 60 °C to about 120 °C, depending upon the type of polymerization reactor(s). In some reactor systems, the polymerization temperature generally can fail within a range from about 70 °C to about 100 °C, or from about 75 °C to about 95 °C. Various polymerization conditions can be held substantially constant, for example, for the production of a particular grade of olefin polymer. Suitable pressures will also vary according to the reactor and polymerization type. The pressure for liquid phase polymerizations in a loop reactor is typically less than 1000 psig (6.9 MP a). Pressure for gas phase polymerization is usually at about 200 to 500 psig (1.4 MPa to 3.4 MPa). High pressure polymerization in tubular or autoclave reactors is generally run at about 20,000 to 75,000 psig (138 to 517 MPa). Polymerization reactors can also be operated in a supercritical region occurring at generally higher temperatures and pressures. Operation above the critical point of a pressure/temperature diagram (supercritical phase) may offer advantages. Aspects of this invention are directed to olefin polymerization processes comprising contacting a catalyst composition with an olefin monomer and, optionally, an olefin comonomer under polymerization conditions to produce an olefin polymer. The olefin polymer (e.g., ethylene homopolymer, ethylene copolymer, etc.) produced by the process can have any of the polymer properties disclosed herein, for example, a density from about 0.89 to about 0.97 g/cmJ, and/or less than about 0,005 LCB per 1000 total carbon atoms, and/or a ratio of Mw/Mn from about 2 to about 8, and/or a ratio of Mz/Mw from about 1.5 to about 5, and/or a conventional or substantially fiat comonomer distribution, and/or a unimodal molecular weight distribution. The disclosed catalyst systems and polymerization processes are capable of producing unique ethylene homopolyrners, which can have a melt index greater than or equal to about 50 g/10 min, and a density of less than or equal to about 0.970 g/cm', such as, for example, a melt index in a range from about 100 to about 1000 g/10 min (or from about 150 to about 750 g/10 min), and a density in a range from about 0.960 to about 0.968 g/ernJ (or from about 0.960 to about 0.965 g/cmJ). Unexpectedly, the catalyst systems and polymerization processes of this invention, employing a boron bridged metallocene compound having formula (I), can have very good comonomer incorporation, as illustrated by a relatively large drop in density based on the increase in the comonomenmonomer molar ratio. For instance, an ethylene copolymer (e.g., an ethylene/ 1 -hexene copolymer) can have a decrease in density - based on an increase in comonomenmonomer molar ratio (e.g., 1- hexene:ethylene molar ratio) from 0.034 to 0.068 - of at least about 0.002 g cmJ (and often up to about 0.009-0.010 g cm3); alternatively, a decrease of at least about 0.003 g/cm3; alternatively, a decrease of at least about 0.004 g/cm'; or alternatively, a decrease of at least about 0.005 g cmJ. Aspects of this invention also are directed to olefin polymerization processes conducted in the absence of added hydrogen. An olefin polymerization process of this invention can comprise contacting a catalyst composition with an olefin monomer and optionally an olefin comonomer in a polymerization reactor system under polymerization conditions to produce an olefin polymer, wherein the catalyst composition can comprise a boron-bridged metallocene, an activator, and an optional co-catalyst, and wherein the polymerization process is conducted in the absence of added hydrogen (no hydrogen is added to the polymerization reactor system). As one of ordinary skill in the art would recognize, hydrogen can be generated in-situ by metallocene catalyst compositions in various olefin polymerization processes, and the amount generated can vary depending upon the specific catalyst composition and metallocene compound employed, the type of polymerization process used, the polymerization reaction conditions utilized, and so forth. In other aspects, it may be desirable to conduct the polymerization process in the presence of a certain amount of added hydrogen. Accordingly, an olefin polymerization process of this invention can comprise contacting a catalyst composition with an olefin monomer and optionally an olefin comonomer in a polymerization reactor system under polymerization conditions to produce an olefin polymer, wherein the catalyst composition comprises a boron-bridged metallocene, an activator, and an optional co-catalyst, and wherein the polymerization process is conducted in the presence of added hydrogen (hydrogen is added to the polymerization reactor system). For example, the ratio of hydrogen to the olefin monomer in the polymerization process can be controlled, often by the feed ratio of hydrogen to the olefin monomer entering the reactor. The added hydrogen to olefin monomer ratio in the process can be controlled at a weight ratio which falls within a range from about 25 ppm to about 1500 ppm, from about 50 to about 1000 ppm, or from about 100 ppm to about 750 ppm. In a particular aspect and unexpectedly, the Mw/Mn ratio of the olefin polymer produced by the process can increase as the amount of hydrogen added to the polymerization reactor system increases. For instance, the Mw/Mn ratio of the polymer produced by the process in the absence of added hydrogen (zero added hydrogen, molar ratio of H2:olefin monomer equal to zero) can be less than the Mw/Mn of a polymer produced by the process in the presence of hydrogen at a. molar ratio of H2:olefin monomer of 0.1 : 1, under the same polymerization conditions. In another aspect, the Mw Mn ratio of the polymer produced by the process in the presence of hydrogen at a molar ratio of H2: olefin monomer equal to 0.1 : 1 can be less than the Mw/Mn of a polymer produced by the process in the presence of hydrogen at a molar ratio of H?:olefin monomer of 0.25: 1, under the same polymerization conditions. The same polymerization conditions means that all components used to prepare the catalyst systems are held constant (e.g., same amount type of metallocene compound, same amount/type of co-catalyst, same amount/type of activator, such as fiuorided silica- coated alumina, etc.) and all polymerization conditions are held constant (e.g., same polymerization temperature, same pressure, etc.). Hence, the only difference is the amount of hydrogen present during the polymerization. in some aspects of this invention, the feed or reactant ratio of hydrogen to olefin monomer can be maintained substantially constant during the polymerization run for a particular polymer grade. That is, the hydrogen; olefin monomer ratio can be selected at a particular ratio within a range from about 5 ppm up to about 1000 ppm or so, and maintained at the ratio to within about +/- 25% during the polymerization rim. For instance, if the target ratio is 100 ppm, then maintaining the hydrogen:o3efm monomer ratio substantially constant would entail maintaining the feed ratio between about 75 ppm and about 125 ppm. Further, the addition of comonomer (or comonomers) can be, and generally is, substantially constant throughout the polymerization run for a particular polymer grade. However, in other aspects, it is contemplated that monomer, comonomer (or comonomers), and/or hydrogen can be periodically pulsed to the reactor, for instance, in a manner similar to that employed in U.S. Patent No. 5,739,220 and U.S. Patent Publication No. 2004/0059070, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. The concentration of the reactants entering the polymerization reactor system can be controlled to produce resins with certain physical and mechanical properties. The proposed end-use product that will be formed by the polymer resin and the method of forming that product ultimately can determine the desired polymer properties and attributes. Mechanical properties include tensile, flexural, impact, creep, stress relaxation, and hardness tests. Physical properties include density, molecular weight, molecular weight distribution, melting temperature, glass transition temperature, temperature melt of crystallization, density, stereoregularity, crack growth, long chain branching, and rheological measurements. This invention is also directed to, and encompasses, the polymers (e.g., ethylene/a-olefin copolymers, ethylene homopolymers, etc.) produced by any of the polymerization processes disclosed herein. Articles of manufacture can be formed from, and/or can comprise, the polymers produced in accordance with this invention. POLYMERS AND ARTICLES Olefin polymers encompassed herein can include any polymer produced from any olefin monomer and comonomer(s) described herein. For example, the olefin polymer can comprise an ethylene homopoiymer, a propylene homopolymer, an ethylene copolymer (e.g., ethylene/a-olefin, ethylene/1 -butene, ethylene/1 -hexene, ethylene/'l-octene, etc.), a propylene copolymer, an ethylene terpolymer, a propylene terpolymer, and the like, including combinations thereof. In one aspect, the olefin polymer can be an ethylene/ 1 -butene copolymer, an ethylene/ 1 -hexene copolymer, or an ethylene/1 -octene copolymer, while in another aspect, the olefin polymer can be an ethylene/1 -bexene copolymer. If the resultant polymer produced in accordance with the present invention is, for example, an ethylene polymer, its properties can be characterized by various analytical techniques known and used in the polyolefm industry.

Accordingly, another illustrative and non-limiting example of an ethylene homopolymer of the present invention can have a melt index in a range from about 100 to about 1000 g/10 min (or from about 150 to about 750 g/10 min, or from about 250 to about 750 g/10 min), and a density in a range from about 0.960 to about 0,970 g cmJ (or from about 0.960 to about 0.968 g/cm3, or from about 0.960 to about 0.965 g/cmJ). These illustrative and non-limiting examples of ethylene homopolymers consistent with the present invention also can have any of the homopolymer properties listed below and in any combination. The ethylene homopolymer, in some aspects, can have a unimodal molecular weight distribution. Additionally or alternatively, the ethylene homopolymer can have very low levels of long chain branching, with typically less than about 0.01 long chain branches (LCB) per 1000 total carbon atoms, such as, for instance, less than about 0.008 LCB, less than about 0.006 LCB, or less than about 0.005 LCB, per 1000 total carbon atoms. The ethylene homopoiymer, in some aspects, can have a narrow molecular weight distribution. For instance, the ethylene homopoiymer can have a ratio of Mw/Mn of less than or equal to about 4, such as in a range from about 2 to about 3,8, from about 2.1 to about 3.7, or from about 2 to about 3.5. The Mw/Mn can be in a range from about 2.1 to about 2.9, from about 2.2 to about 3, or from about 2.2 to about 2.8, in further aspects of this invention.

The ethylene homopoiymer, in some aspects, can have a weight-average molecular weight (Mw) in a range from about 18,000 to about 50,000, from about 20,000 to about 45,000, or from about 20,000 to about 40,000 g/mol. The Mw of the ethylene homopoiymer can be in a range from about 22,000 to about 35,000, from about 20,000 to about 30,000, or from about 24,000 to about 34,000 g/mol, in further aspects of this invention. Additionally or alternatively, the ethylene homopoiymer can have a number-average molecular weight (Mn) in a range from about 5,000 to about 20,000, from about 5,000 to about 17,000, or from about 5,000 to about 15,000 g/mol. The Mn of the ethylene homopoiymer can be in a range from about 7,000 to about 17,000, from about 7,000 to about 13,000, or from about 8,000 to about 12,000 g/mol, in further aspects of this invention. Additionally or alternatively, the ethylene homopoiymer can have a z-average molecular weight (Mz) in a range from about 30,000 to about 90,000, from about 38,000 to about 82,000, or from about 42,000 to about 75,000 g/mol. The Mz of the ethylene homopoiymer can be in a range from about 40,000 to about 72,000, from about 44,000 to about 70,000, or from about 46,000 to about 66,000 g/mol, in further aspects of this invention. In addition to the above-described ethylene homopoiymers, other olefin polymers (e.g., ethylene copolymers) can be produced using the catalyst systems and polymerization processes described herein. The densities of ethylene-based polymers produced using the catalyst systems and polymerization processes described herein often are greater than or equal to about 0.89 g/cm'. In one aspect of this invention, the density of the ethylene polymer can be in a range from about 0.89 to about 0.97 g/cm'. Yet, in another aspect, the density can be in a range from about 0.90 to about 0.96 g/cm3, such as, for example, from about 0.91 to about 0.96 g/cm3, from about 0.92 to about 0.95 g/cm'', or from about 0.91 to about 0.94 g/cm3. Olefin polymers (e.g., ethylene copolymers) produced using the catalyst systems and polymerization processes described herein generally can have a ratio of Mw Mn in a. range from about 2 to about 12.

Additionally or alternatively, the ratio of Mz/Mw of the polymer can be in a range from about 1.5 to about 5, from about 1.5 to about 4, from about 1.5 to about 3, from about 1.7 to about 4.5, from about 1.8 to about 4, or from about 1.8 to about 2,8. Generally, olefin polymers produced using the catalyst systems and polymerization processes described herein can have low levels of long chain branching, with typically less than about 0.01 long chain branches (LCB) per 1000 total carbon atoms, and more often, less than about 0.008 LCB per 1000 total carbon atoms. In some aspects, the number of LCB per 1000 total carbon atoms can be less than about 0.005, less than about 0.003 LCB per 1000 total carbon atoms, or less than about 0.002 LCB per 1000 total carbon atoms. Ethylene copolymers, for example, produced using the catalyst systems and polymerization processes described herein can, in some aspects, have a conventional comonomer distribution, generally, the lower molecular weight components of the polymer have higher comonomer incorporation than the higher molecular weight components. Typically, there is decreasing comonomer incorporation with increasing molecular weight.

EXAMPLES The invention is further illustrated by the following examples, which are not to be construed in any way as imposing limitations to the scope of this invention. Various other aspects, embodiments, modifications, and equivalents thereof which, after reading the description herein, may suggest themselves to one of ordinary skill in the art without departing from the spirit of the present invention or the scope of the appended claims. Melt index (MI, g/10 min) was determined in accordance with ASTM D1238 at 190 °C with a 2, 160 gram weight. Polymer density was determined in grams per cubic centimeter (g/cm3) on a compression molded sample, cooled at about 15 °C per hour, and conditioned for about 40 hours at room temperature in accordance with ASTM D1505 and ASTM D4703. Molecular weights and molecular weight distributions were obtained using a PL-GPC 220 (Polymer Labs, an Agilent Company) system equipped with a IR4 detector (Polymer Char, Spain) and three Styragel HMW-6E GPC columns (Waters, MA) running at 145 °C, The flow rate of the mobile phase 1 ,2,4-trichlorobenzene (TCB) containing 0.5 g L 2,6-di-t-butyl-4-methylphenol (BHT) was set at 1 mL/min, and polymer solution concentrations were in the range of 1.0-1.5 mg/mL, depending on the molecular weight. Sample preparation was conducted at 150 °C for nominally 4 hr with occasional and gentle agitation, before the solutions were transferred to sample vials for injection. An injection volume of about 200 μΕ w¾s used. The integral calibration method was used to deduce molecular weights and molecular weight distributions using a Chevron Phillips Chemical Company's HDPE polyethylene resin, MARLEX*! BHB5003, as the broad standard. The integral table of the broad standard was pre-determined in a separate experiment with SEC-MALS. Mn is the number- average molecular weight, Mw is the weight-average molecular weight, and Mz is the z-average molecular weight. The long chain branches (LCB) per 1000 total carbon atoms can be calculated using the method of Janzen and Colby (J. Mot. Struct., 485/486, 569-584 (1999)), from values of zero shear viscosity, η0 (determined from the Carreau-Yasuda model), and measured values of Mw obtained using a Dawn EOS multiangle light scattering detector (Wyatt). See also U.S. Patent No. 8,114,946; J. Phys. Chem. 1980, 84, 649; and Y. Yu, D. C. Rohlfing, G. R Hawley, and P. J. DesLauriers, Polymer Preprint, 44, 50, (2003), These references are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. Short chain branch (SCB) content and short chain branching distribution (SCBD) across the molecular weight distribution can be determined via an IR5- detected GPC system (TR5-GPC), wherein the GPC system is a PL220 GPC/SEC system (Polymer Labs, an Agilent company) equipped with three Styragel HMW-6E columns (Waters, MA) for polymer separation. A thermoelectric-cooled IRS MCT detector (1R5) (Polymer Char, Spain) is connected to the GPC columns via a hot- transfer line. Chromatographic data are obtained from two output ports of the IRS detector. First, the analog signal goes from the analog output port to a digitizer before connecting to Computer "A" for molecular weight determinations via the Cirrus software (Polymer Labs, now an Agilent Company) and the integral calibration method using a broad MWD HOPE Marlex™ BHB5003 resin (Chevron Phillips Chemical) as the broad molecular weight standard. The digital signals, on the other hand, go via a USB cable directly to Computer "B" where they are collected by a LabView data collection software provided by Polymer Char. Chromatographic conditions are set as follows: column oven temperature of 145 °C; flowrate of 1 mL/min; injection volume of 0.4 mL; and polymer concentration of about 2 mg/mL, depending on sample molecular weight. The temperatures for both the hot-transfer line and IRS detector sample cell are set at 150 °C, while the temperature of the electronics of the IR5 detector is set at 60 °C. Short chain branching content is determined via an in-house method using the intensity ratio of CFL ί 1· · ; ; · to Cl¾ (icic) coupled with a calibration curve. The calibration curve is a plot of SCB content (XSCB) as a function of the intensity ratio of IcmUcm. To obtain a calibration curve, a group of polyethylene resins (no less than 5) of SCB level ranging from zero to ca. 32 SCB/1,000 total carbons (SCB Standards) is used. All these SCB Standards have known SCB levels and flat SCBD profiles pre-determined separately by NMR and the solvent-gradient fractionation coupled with NMR (SGF-NMR) methods. Using SCB calibration curves thus established, profiles of short chain branching distribution across the molecular weight distribution are obtained for resins fractionated by the IR5-GPC system under exactly the same chromatographic conditions as for these SCB standards, A relationship between the intensity ratio and the elution volume is converted into SCB distribution as a function of MWD using a predetermined SCB calibration curve (i.e., intensity ratio of Jcm^c vs. SCB content) and MW calibration curve (i.e., molecular weight vs. elution time) to convert the intensity ratio of Icmflcm and the elution time into SCB content and the molecular weight, respectively. Fluorided silica-coated alumina activator-supports were prepared as follows. Bohemite was obtained from W.R. Grace & Company under the designation "Alumina A" and having a surface area of about 300 m7g, a pore volume of about 1.3 mL/g, and an average particle size of about 100 microns. The alumina was first calcined in dry air at about 600 °C for approximately 6 hours, cooled to ambient temperature, and then contacted with tetraethylorthosilicatc m isopropanol to equal 25 wt % Si02. After drying, the silica-coated alumina was calcined at 600 °C for 3 hours. Fluorided silica- coated alumina (7 wt. % F) was prepared by impregnating the calcined silica-coated alumina with an ammonium bifluori.de solution in methanol, drying, and then calcining for 3 hours at 600 °C in dry air. Afterward, the fluorided silica-coated alumina was collected and stored under dry nitrogen, and was used without exposure to the atmosphere. Sulfated alumina activator-supports were prepared as follows. As above, bohemite was obtained from W.R. Grace & Company under the designation "Alumina A." This material was impregnated to incipient wetness with an aqueous solution of ammonium sulfate to equal about 15% sulfate. This mixture was then placed in a flat pan and allowed to dry under vacuum at approximately 1 10 °C for about 16 hours. To calcine the resultant powdered mixture, the material was fluidized in a stream of dry air at about 550 °C for about 6 hours. Afterward, the sulfated alumina was collected and stored under dry nitrogen, and was used without exposure to the atmosphere. EXAMPLE 1 Metallocene MTE A, shown below, was synthesized by first reacting lithiated indene with 5-bromo-l-pentene.
