Step 4: 1-(2-(4-fluoro-2-methoxy-5-nitrophenylamino)pyrimidin-4-yl)-3-methyl-1H -benzo[d]imidazol-2(3H)-one p-toluenesulfonate
1-(2-Chloropyrimidin-4-yl)-3-methyl-1H-benzo[d]imidazol-2(3H)-one (459 mg, 1.76 mmol), 4-fluoro-2-methoxy-5-nitroaniline (360 mg, 1.93 mmol) and p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate (551 mg, 2.89 mmol) were dispersed in 2-pentanol (10 mL) and the reaction mixture was stirred overnight at 105Â°C. After being cooled, the mixture was suction-filtered, and the filter cake was washed three times with a small amount of 2-pentanol and dried to give the title compound (440 mg, 43%).
