Preparation of 4-((6S,8R)-7-((1-fluorocyclopropyl)methyl)-8-methyl-3-(tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-yl)-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-3H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]isoquinolin-6-yl)-3-methoxyphenol
Aqueous hydrogen peroxide (33%; 75 μL, 0.74 mmol) was added dropwise to a stirred solution of (6S,8R)-7-((1-fluorocyclopropyl)methyl)-6-(2-methoxy-4-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)phenyl)-8-methyl-3-(tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-yl)-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-3H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]isoquinoline (186 mg, 0.32 mmol) and aqueous sodium hydroxide (1 M; 350 μL, 0.32 mmol) in THF (2.5 mL) at 5° C. under air. The resulting mixture was stirred at 5° C. for 5 minutes. The reaction was then diluted with water (50 mL) and DCM (100 mL). The layers were separated, and the aqueous layer was extracted with DCM (2×50 mL). The combined organic layers were dried over sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was purified by flash silica chromatography, elution gradient 20 to 50% ethyl acetate in hexanes, to afford 4-((6S,8R)-7-((1-fluorocyclopropyl)methyl)-8-methyl-3-(tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-yl)-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-3H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]isoquinolin-6-yl)-3-methoxyphenol (94 mg, 62.5%) as a yellow solid. m/z: ES+ [M+H]+ 466.
