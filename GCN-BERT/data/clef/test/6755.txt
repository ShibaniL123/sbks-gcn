2.4: 3-[1-(2-hydroxyacetyl)-piperidin-4-yl]-3,4-dihydro-1H-quinazolin-2-one
212 mg (1.6 mmol) of 1-hydroxybenzotriazole and 307 mg (1.6 mmol) of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride are added to a solution of 100 mg (1.3 mmol) of hydroxyacetic acid in 10 ml of dimethylformamide. The reaction mixture is stirred for 5 minutes at room temperature and 304 mg (1.6 mmol) of 3-piperidin-4-yl-3,4-dihydro-1H-quinazolin-2-one (prepared as described in example 1.5) is added. After stirring for two hours at room temperature, the reaction mixture is hydrolysed with a saturated aqueous solution of sodium hydrogen carbonate and diluted with ethyl acetate. The product is extracted twice with ethyl acetate and once with n-butanol. The organic phases are combined, washed once with water and once with a saturated aqueous solution of sodium chloride. They are dried over magnesium sulphate, filtered and concentrated under vacuum. The crude residue is chromatographed on silica gel eluted with a dichloromethane/methanol 97/3 mixture. 140 mg (35%) of 3-[1-(2-hydroxyacetyl)-piperidin-4-yl]-3,4-dihydro-1H-quinazolin-2-one is obtained in the form of a white solid.
