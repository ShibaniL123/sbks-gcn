TITLE Self-Cleaning Espresso Group Head SPECIFICATION DESCRIPTION [0001] The present invention relates generally to using ultrasound to thoroughly brewing espresso from coffee grounds and self-cleaning of the espresso coffee brewing equipment. [0002] There are a number of challenges in extracting espresso so as to thoroughly extract the maximum crema, the maximum flavor, keep the espresso brewing equipment clean, reducing staff costs and avoid coffee wastage. [0003] Making great espresso is a highly skilled procedure that, over and above extracting the correct volume of espresso liquid, also requires the correct balance of water pressure, water temperature, grind size and tamping pressure. Even experts find the espresso making process difficult and it takes years of practice to extract espresso expertly. [004] As coffee oils flow over the surfaces of an espresso machine, they leave a coating of oils. The oils are exposed to oxygen, they go rancid and consequently impart a bitter flavor to the espresso. The machine becomes unclean and unhygienic. [0005] Espresso machine group head cleaning requires a lot of time and should be done daily by a trained professional. [0006] Failing to thoroughly extract flavor from the grounds results in the operator having to use more coffee than would otherwise be required for good flavor - hence wastage. [0007] Failure to get the grind, water pressure and tamping pressure correct results in a loss of crema. [0008] Pre-infusion normally requires several seconds to thoroughly saturate the grounds prior to coffee extraction - time that can be save in a busy espresso making operation. ULTRASOUND OPERATION [0018] The ultrasonic transducer is screwed directly into the brew cavity inside the espresso brewing group head - this required considerable innovation in brew group head design. [0019] The ultrasound operates automatically throughout the entire espresso brewing cycle including pre-infusion and espresso extraction. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0020] The present invention relates to the needs of espresso machine owners requirement for equipment that does its function better. [0021] The present invention relates to the needs of espresso machine owners requirement for lower wastage. [0022] The present invention relates to the needs of espresso machine owners requirement for equipment that stays clean and hygienic longer and is easier to clean. [0023] This innovation vastly improves and makes more consistent espresso which means that the espresso machine owner can employ less specialized espresso makers at a lower cost and still get a great quality result. TITLE Self-Cleaning Espresso Group Head [0009] This invention finds an innovative way to attach an ultrasonic transducer directly to the espresso machine brewing group heads.[0010] This innovative method of espresso making addresses and solves the thorough crema extraction problem and gives greater crema consistency.[0011] This innovative method of espresso making addresses and solves the thorough flavor extraction problem giving greater espresso consistency.[0012] Better and more consistent espresso making means that the output quality is better with lower cost, less specialized espresso making staff.[0013] Cavitation caused by ultrasound in the brewing group head prevents the coffee oils from adhering to the surfaces. This results in a cleaner espresso machine and better tasting espresso.[0014] Because the group head is self-cleaning, cleaning time is dramatically reduced and required less often. The machine stays cleaner and more hygienic for longer.[0015] Thorough flavor extraction reduces wastage of ground coffee.[0016] This innovation dramatically reduces the pre-infusion time required prior to extraction.[0017] Applying ultrasound to the brewing group head of an espresso machine is a unique process completely different to anything else on the market.
