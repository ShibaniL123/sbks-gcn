QUINOLINE COMPOUNDS INTRODUCTION [0001 ] The present invention relates to certain quinoline compounds. More specifically, the present invention relates to certain quinoline compounds that inhibit the formation of amyloid deposits (e.g. amyloid plaques or fibrils). Consequently, these compounds are suitably for treating diseases and disorders associated with the formation of amyloid deposits, such as, for example, type-2 diabetes and/or Alzheimer's disease. The present invention also relates to processes for the preparation of these compounds, to pharmaceutical compositions comprising them, and to their use in the treatment of relevant disorders, such as, for example, type-2 diabetes and/or Alzheimer's disease. BACKGROUND [0002] Amyloids are insoluble fibrous protein aggregates (also known as "amyloid fibrils" or "amyloid plaques") which form in vivo, typically at hydrophobic-hydrophilic interfaces (HHIs), when naturally-occurring proteins and polypeptides misfold and inadvertently interact with one another and/or with other cell components to form aggregates. Amyloid plaques/fibrils, and consequencial amyloidosis, are believed to be responsible, at least in part, for numerous human diseases, including but not limited to Alzheimer's disease and type-2 diabetes. [0003] Amyloid-beta (Αβ) peptides are the principle component of amyloid plaques found in the brains of Alzheimer's patients, and are thought to result from an amyloid precursor protein (APP) which when cut by particular enzymes yield Αβ peptides which misfold and aggregate to yield first oligomers and fibrils and ultimately amyloid plaques, amongst which sequence of conformers are those that are toxic to nerve cells. [0004] Amylin (or Islet Amyloid Polypeptide - IAPP) is the principle component of amyloid deposits commonly found in pancreatic islets of type-2 diabetes patients. Such deposits of IAPP are thought to be typically initiated by unprocessed prolAPP seeds. It is thought that amylin, much like the related Αβ peptides associated with Alzheimer's disease, can induce apoptotic or excitotoxic cell-death in insulin-producing beta cells. It is thought that this effect may be relevant to the development of type 2 diabetes (Lorenzo A, Razzaboni B, Weir GC, Yankner BA (April 1994). "Pancreatic islet cell toxicity of amylin associated with type-2 diabetes mellitus". Nature 368 (6473): 756-60). [0005] Most proteins contain hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains and their adsorption to hydrophobic-hydrophilic interfaces (HHIs) is due to this amphiphilic character, conferring upon them surfactant properties. Protein adsorption, a complex process dependent on both protein and interface characteristics, is governed by bulk diffusion and results in interface adsorption. Once the interface becomes crowded, the adsorbed molecules will begin to align themselves at the interface (Wu et al 1993; Graham et al 1979; Ariola et al 2006). This conformation change may lead to intermolecular attractions between molecules, which in turn may result in the formation of interfacial multi-layers (Schmidt et al 1990). Protein adsorption also has significant implications in the activity of proteins toward membranes; amphiphilicity of proteins or peptides allow them to bind to membrane interfaces. [0006] Amyloid peptides are amphiphilic and surface active (Lopes et al 2007; Cottingham M et al 2004; Soreghan et al 1994). This amphiphilicity has been exploited by amyloid precursor species to bind to membranes and to use this interaction to facilitate assembly into amyloid fibrils (Knight and Miranker 2004; Knight et al 2006; Lopes et al 2007; Terzi et al 1997). The eventual appearance of macroscopic amyloid deposits is a hallmark of protein misfolding diseases such as type II diabetes mellitus and Alzheimer's disease. During fibrillisation, amyloid peptides undergo a conformational change to form extended β-strands, facilitated by interaction with an HHI, whether membrane or AWI (air-water interface). This is due to a concentration effect of amphiphilic amyloids at the interface, which in turn alters the thermodynamic equilibrium and promotes peptide chains alignment (Lopes et al 2007; Terzi et al 1997; Soreghan et al 1994; Jean et al 2010). Recent attention has focused on determining the effects that lipids have on amyloid fibrillogenesis; in the presence of an AWI, anionic lipids were shown to enhance amyloid nucleation whereas zwitterionic lipids had no effect (Knight and Miranker 2004; Knight et al 2006; Chi et al 2008). However, this enhancing effect of anionic lipids on amyloidogenesis was demonstrated to be at its greatest in a context more closely mirroring in vivo conditions (the absence of an AWI; see Jean et al 2010). Thus, to understand fully fibrillisation enhancement by phospholipid bilayers, the biophysical consequences of amyloid surfactant activity and the potential importance of a competing AWI need to be taken into account. [0007] Many proteins that adsorb at interfaces are able to form multi-layered proteinaceous networks, which can be stabilised by interfacial gel formation. The interfacial gel layer itself can be stabilised by numerous non-covalent interactions to form a meshwork of aggregates (e.g. fibres), typical of assembled amyloid polypeptides. To date gel formation has only been demonstrated for non-pathological amyloidogenic polypeptides (e.g. Escherichia coli curli, class II hydrophobins, b-lactoglobulin, spider silk) and for fragments of pathological amyloidogenic polypeptides (Wu et al 201 2, Cox et al 2007, Bolisetty et al 201 2, Yang et al 2012, Rijkers et al 2002, Krysmann et al 2008, Lepere et al 2007, Lakshmanan et al 201 3, Manno M et al 2010). We have recently shown by direct rheological measurement that hydrated gel formation by pathological amyloid precursors including Αβ and islet amyloid precursor polypeptide (IAPP) does indeed occur at HHIs. [0008] The pathologically relevant mechanisms of amyloid cytotoxicity are uncertain, although recent attention has focused on the concentration of amyloid peptides at membrane HHIs, which can cause disruption by a variety of mechanisms such as pore formation and membrane thinning (Kayed et al 2004; Quist et al 2005; Demuro et al 2005; Butterfield and Lashuel 2010). However, it seems probable that gel formation by amyloid species on the surface of cellular membranes could have important additional consequences for membrane integrity and cellular functions. [0009] It is an object of the present invention to provide compounds that are capable of inhibiting the formation of amyloid deposits by acting at an early stage such that the production of the cytotoxic species, whether oligomer or fibril, is inhibited. Such compounds are potentially useful agents for the treatment of diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and/or type-2 diabetes.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Definitions [0063] Unless otherwise stated, the following terms used in the specification and claims have the following meanings set out below. [0064] Herein, the term "amyloid deposit(s)" refers to amyloid oligomers, fibrils or plaques. [0065] It is to be appreciated that references to "treating" or "treatment" include prophylaxis as well as the alleviation of established symptoms of a condition. "Treating" or "treatment" of a state, disorder or condition therefore includes: (1 ) preventing or delaying the appearance of clinical symptoms of the state, disorder or condition developing in a human that may be afflicted with or predisposed to the state, disorder or condition but does not yet experience or display clinical or subclinical symptoms of the state, disorder or condition, (2) inhibiting the state, disorder or condition, i.e., arresting, reducing or delaying the development of the disease or a relapse thereof (in case of maintenance treatment) or at least one clinical or subclinical symptom thereof, or (3) relieving or attenuating the disease, i.e., causing regression of the state, disorder or condition or at least one of its clinical or subclinical symptoms. [0066] A "therapeutically effective amount" means the amount of a compound that, when administered to a mammal for treating a disease, is sufficient to effect such treatment for the disease. The "therapeutically effective amount" will vary depending on the compound, the disease and its severity and the age, weight, etc., of the mammal to be treated. [0067] In this specification the term "alkyl" includes both straight and branched chain alkyl groups. References to individual alkyl groups such as "propyl" are specific for the straight chain version only and references to individual branched chain alkyl groups such as "isopropyl" are specific for the branched chain version only. For example, "(1 -6C)alkyl" includes (1 -4C)alkyl, (1 -3C)alkyl, propyl, isopropyl and f-butyl. A similar convention applies to other radicals, for example "phenyl(1 -6C)alkyl" includes phenyl(1 -4C)alkyl, benzyl, 1 -phenylethyl and 2-phenylethyl. [0068] The term "(m-nC)" or "(m-nC) group" used alone or as a prefix, refers to any group having m to n carbon atoms. [0069] The term "halo" or "halogeno" refers to fluoro, chloro, bromo and iodo. [0070] The term "(m-nC)haloalkyl" or "(m-nC)haloalkoxy" respectively refers to halo- substituted "(m-nC)alkyl" or "(m-nC)alkoxy" moieties, wherein said "(m-nC)alkyl" or "(m- nC)alkoxy" moieties are substituted by one or more halo groups (e.g. mono, di, and tri- halo derivativs). For instance, (1 -4C)haloalkyl may encompass trifluoromethyl, whereas (1 -4C)haloalkoxy may encompass trifluoromethoxy. In some embodiments, the terms "(m-nC)haloalkyl" or "(m-nC)haloalkoxy" refer to mono-, di-, or tri-halo substituted derivatives of "(m-nC)alkyl" or "(m-nC)alkoxy" moieties. [0071 ] The term "heterocyclyl", "heterocyclic" or "heterocycle" means a non-aromatic saturated or partially saturated monocyclic, fused, bridged, or spiro bicyclic heterocyclic ring system(s). The term heterocyclyl includes both monovalent species and divalent species. Monocyclic heterocyclic rings contain from about 3 to 12 (suitably from 3 to 7) ring atoms, with from 1 to 5 (suitably 1 , 2 or 3) heteroatoms selected from nitrogen, oxygen or sulfur in the ring. Bicyclic heterocycles contain from 7 to 17 member atoms, suitably 7 to 12 member atoms, in the ring. Bicyclic heterocycles contain from about 7 to about 17 ring atoms, suitably from 7 to 12 ring atoms. Bicyclic heterocyclic(s) rings may be fused, spiro, or bridged ring systems. Examples of heterocyclic groups include cyclic ethers such as oxiranyl, oxetanyl, tetrahydrofuranyl, dioxanyl, and substituted cyclic ethers. Heterocycles containing nitrogen include, for example, azetidinyl, pyrrolidinyl, piperidinyl, piperazinyl, tetrahydrotriazinyl, tetrahydropyrazolyl, and the like. Typical sulfur containing heterocycles include tetrahydrothienyl, dihydro-1 ,3-dithiol, tetrahydro-2 - -thiopyran, and hexahydrothiepine. Other heterocycles include dihydro-oxathiolyl, tetrahydro-oxazolyl, tetrahydro-oxadiazolyl, tetrahydrodioxazolyl, tetrahydro-oxathiazolyl, hexahydrotriazinyl, tetrahydro-oxazinyl, morpholinyl, thiomorpholinyl, tetrahydropyrimidinyl, dioxolinyl, octahydrobenzofuranyl, octahydrobenzimidazolyl, and octahydrobenzothiazolyl. For heterocycles containing sulfur, the oxidized sulfur heterocycles containing SO or S02 groups are also included. Examples include the sulfoxide and sulfone forms of tetrahydrothienyl and thiomorpholinyl such as tetrahydrothiene 1 ,1 -dioxide and thiomorpholinyl 1 ,1 -dioxide. A suitable value for a heterocyclyl group which bears 1 or 2 oxo (=0) or thioxo (=S) substituents is, for example, 2-oxopyrrolidinyl, 2-thioxopyrrolidinyl, 2-oxoimidazolidinyl, 2-thioxoimidazolidinyl, 2-oxopiperidinyl, 2,5-dioxopyrrolidinyl, 2,5-dioxoimidazolidinyl or 2,6-dioxopiperidinyl. Particular heterocyclyl groups are saturated monocyclic 3 to 7 membered heterocyclyls containing 1 , 2 or 3 heteroatoms selected from nitrogen, oxygen or sulfur, for example azetidinyl, tetrahydrofuranyl, tetrahydropyranyl, pyrrolidinyl, morpholinyl, tetrahydrothienyl, tetrahydrothienyl 1 ,1 - dioxide, thiomorpholinyl, thiomorpholinyl 1 ,1 -dioxide, piperidinyl, homopiperidinyl, piperazinyl or homopiperazinyl. As the skilled person would appreciate, any heterocycle may be linked to another group via any suitable atom, such as via a carbon or nitrogen atom. However, reference herein to piperidino or morpholino refers to a piperidin-1 -yl or morpholin-4-yl ring that is linked via the ring nitrogen. [0072] The term "heteroaryl" or "heteroaromatic" means an aromatic mono-, bi-, or polycyclic ring incorporating one or more (for example 1 -4, particularly 1 , 2 or 3) heteroatoms selected from nitrogen, oxygen or sulfur. The term heteroaryl includes both monovalent species and divalent species. Examples of heteroaryl groups are monocyclic and bicyclic groups containing from five to twelve ring members, and more usually from five to ten ring members. The heteroaryl group can be, for example, a 5- or 6-membered monocyclic ring or a 9- or 10-membered bicyclic ring, for example a bicyclic structure formed from fused five and six membered rings or two fused six membered rings. Each ring may contain up to about four heteroatoms typically selected from nitrogen, sulfur and oxygen. Typically the heteroaryl ring will contain up to 3 heteroatoms, more usually up to 2, for example a single heteroatom. In one embodiment, the heteroaryl ring contains at least one ring nitrogen atom. The nitrogen atoms in the heteroaryl rings can be basic, as in the case of an imidazole or pyridine, or essentially non-basic as in the case of an indole or pyrrole nitrogen. In general the number of basic nitrogen atoms present in the heteroaryl group, including any amino group substituents of the ring, will be less than five. [0073] Examples of five membered heteroaryl groups include but are not limited to pyrrolyl, furanyl, thienyl, imidazolyl, furazanyl, oxazolyl, oxadiazolyl, oxatriazolyl, isoxazolyl, thiazolyl, isothiazolyl, pyrazolyl, triazolyl and tetrazolyl groups. [0074] Examples of six membered heteroaryl groups include but are not limited to pyridyl, pyrazinyl, pyridazinyl, pyrimidinyl and triazinyl. [0075] The term "optionally substituted" refers to either groups, structures, or molecules that are substituted and those that are not substituted. The term "wherein a/any CH, CH2 or CH3 group within a R1 group is optionally substituted" suitably means that (any) one of the hydrogen radicals of the R1 group is substituted by a relevant stipulated group. [0076] Where optional substituents are chosen from "one or more" groups it is to be understood that this definition includes all substituents being chosen from one of the specified groups or the substituents being chosen from two or more of the specified groups. [0077] The phrase "compound of the invention" means those compounds which are disclosed herein, both generically and specifically.

[0097] In a particular embodiment, the compound of the invention is: (£)-5,7-dimethyl-2-(2-(pyridin-3- yl)vinyl)quinolin-8-ol (Compound #249) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, hydrate or solvate thereof. [0098] The various functional groups and substituents making up the compounds of the formula I are typically chosen such that the molecular weight of the compound of the formula I does not exceed 1000. More usually, the molecular weight of the compound will be less than 750, for example less than 700, or less than 650, or less than 600, or less than 550. More preferably, the molecular weight is less than 525 and, for example, is 500 or less. [0099] A suitable pharmaceutically acceptable salt of a compound of the invention is, for example, an acid-addition salt of a compound of the invention which is sufficiently basic, for example, an acid-addition salt with, for example, an inorganic or organic acid, for example hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, phosphoric, trifluoroacetic, formic, citric methane sulfonate or maleic acid. In addition, a suitable pharmaceutically acceptable salt of a compound of the invention which is sufficiently acidic is an alkali metal salt, for example a sodium or potassium salt, an alkaline earth metal salt, for example a calcium or magnesium salt, an ammonium salt or a salt with an organic base which affords a pharmaceutically acceptable cation, for example a salt with methylamine, dimethylamine, trimethylamine, piperidine, morpholine or tris-(2-hydroxyethyl)amine. [00100] Compounds that have the same molecular formula but differ in the nature or sequence of bonding of their atoms or the arrangement of their atoms in space are termed "isomers". Isomers that differ in the arrangement of their atoms in space are termed "stereoisomers". Stereoisomers that are not mirror images of one another are termed "diastereomers" and those that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other are termed "enantiomers". When a compound has an asymmetric center, for example, it is bonded to four different groups, a pair of enantiomers is possible. An enantiomer can be characterized by the absolute configuration of its asymmetric center and is described by the R- and S-sequencing rules of Cahn and Prelog, or by the manner in which the molecule rotates the plane of polarized light and designated as dextrorotatory or levorotatory (i.e., as (+) or (-)-isomers respectively). A chiral compound can exist as either individual enantiomer or as a mixture thereof. A mixture containing equal proportions of the enantiomers is called a "racemic mixture". [00101] The compounds of this invention may possess one or more asymmetric centers; such compounds can therefore be produced as individual (R)- or (S)-stereoisomers or as mixtures thereof. Unless indicated otherwise, the description or naming of a particular compound in the specification and claims is intended to include both individual enantiomers and mixtures, racemic or otherwise, thereof. The methods for the determination of stereochemistry and the separation of stereoisomers are well-known in the art (see discussion in Chapter 4 of "Advanced Organic Chemistry", 4th edition J. March, John Wiley and Sons, New York, 2001 ), for example by synthesis from optically active starting materials or by resolution of a racemic form. Some of the compounds of the invention may have geometric isomeric centres (E- and Z- isomers). It is to be understood that the present invention encompasses all optical, diastereoisomers and geometric isomers and mixtures thereof that possess the relevant activity. [00102]The present invention also encompasses compounds of the invention as defined herein which comprise one or more isotopic substitutions. For example, H may be in any isotopic form, including 1H, 2H(D), and 3H (T); C may be in any isotopic form, including 12C, 13C, and 14C; and O may be in any isotopic form, including 160 and180; and the like. [00103] It is also to be understood that certain compounds of the formula I may exist in solvated as well as unsolvated forms such as, for example, hydrated forms. It is to be understood that the invention encompasses all such solvated forms that possess activity in the inhibition of amyloid deposit formation. [00104] It is also to be understood that certain compounds of the formula I may exhibit polymorphism, and that the invention encompasses all such forms that possess activity in the inhibition of amyloid deposit formation. [00105] Compounds of the formula I may exist in a number of different tautomeric forms and references to compounds of the formula I include all such forms. For the avoidance of doubt, where a compound can exist in one of several tautomeric forms, and only one is specifically described or shown, all others are nevertheless embraced by formula I. Examples of tautomeric forms include keto-, enol-, and enolate-forms, as in, for example, the following tautomeric pairs: keto/enol (illustrated below), imine/enamine, amide/imino alcohol, amidine/amidine, nitroso/oxime, thioketone/enethiol, and nitro/aci- nitro. keto enol enolate [00106] Compounds of the formula I containing an amine function may also form N- oxides. A reference herein to a compound of the formula I that contains an amine function also includes the N-oxide. Where a compound contains several amine functions, one or more than one nitrogen atom may be oxidised to form an N-oxide. Particular examples of N-oxides are the N-oxides of a tertiary amine or a nitrogen atom of a nitrogen-containing heterocycle. N-Oxides can be formed by treatment of the corresponding amine with an oxidizing agent such as hydrogen peroxide or a per-acid (e.g. a peroxycarboxylic acid), see for example Advanced Organic Chemistry, by Jerry March, 4th Edition, Wiley Interscience, pages. More particularly, N-oxides can be made by the procedure of L. W. Deady (Syn. Comm. 1977, 7, 509-514) in which the amine compound is reacted with m- chloroperoxybenzoic acid (mCPBA), for example, in an inert solvent such as dichloromethane. [00107] The compounds of formula I may be administered in the form of a pro-drug which is broken down in the human or animal body to release a compound of the invention. A pro-drug may be used to alter the physical properties and/or the pharmacokinetic properties of a compound of the invention. A pro-drug can be formed when the compound of the invention contains a suitable group or substituent to which a property-modifying group can be attached. Examples of pro-drugs include in vivo cleavable ester derivatives that may be formed at a carboxy group or a hydroxy group in a compound of the formula I and in-vivo cleavable amide derivatives that may be formed at a carboxy group or an amino group in a compound of the formula I. [00108] Accordingly, the present invention includes those compounds of the formula I as defined hereinbefore when made available by organic synthesis and when made available within the human or animal body by way of cleavage of a pro-drug thereof. Accordingly, the present invention includes those compounds of the formula I that are produced by organic synthetic means and also such compounds that are produced in the human or animal body by way of metabolism of a precursor compound, that is a compound of the formula I may be a synthetically-produced compound or a metabolically-produced compound. [00109] A suitable pharmaceutically acceptable pro-drug of a compound of the formula I is one that is based on reasonable medical judgement as being suitable for administration to the human or animal body without undesirable pharmacological activities and without undue toxicity. [00110] Various forms of pro-drug have been described, for example in the following documents :- a) Methods in Enzvmoloqy, Vol. 42, p. 309-396, edited by K. Widder, et al. (Academic Press, 1985); b) Design of Pro-drugs, edited by H. Bundgaard, (Elsevier, 1985); c) A Textbook of Drug Design and Development, edited by Krogsgaard-Larsen and H.

Stella, "Pro-Drugs as Novel Delivery Systems", A.C.S. Symposium Series, Volume 14; and h) E. Roche (editor), "Bioreversible Carriers in Drug Design", Pergamon Press, 1987. [00111] A suitable pharmaceutically acceptable pro-drug of a compound of the formula I that possesses a carboxy group is, for example, an in vivo cleavable ester thereof. An in vivo cleavable ester of a compound of the formula I containing a carboxy group is, for example, a pharmaceutically acceptable ester which is cleaved in the human or animal body to produce the parent acid. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable esters for carboxy include Ci-6alkyl esters such as methyl, ethyl and ferf-butyl, Ci-6alkoxymethyl esters such as methoxymethyl esters, Ci-6alkanoyloxymethyl esters such as pivaloyloxymethyl esters, 3-phthalidyl esters, C3-8cycloalkylcarbonyloxy- Ci-6alkyl esters such as cyclopentylcarbonyloxymethyl and 1 -cyclohexylcarbonyloxyethyl esters, 2-OXO-1 ,3-dioxolenylmethyl esters such as 5-methyl-2-oxo-1 ,3-dioxolen-4-ylmethyl esters and Ci-6alkoxycarbonyloxy- Ci-6alkyl esters such as methoxycarbonyloxymethyl and 1 - methoxycarbonyloxyethyl esters. [00112] A suitable pharmaceutically acceptable pro-drug of a compound of the formula I that possesses a hydroxy group is, for example, an in vivo cleavable ester or ether thereof. An in vivo cleavable ester or ether of a compound of the formula I containing a hydroxy group is, for example, a pharmaceutically acceptable ester or ether which is cleaved in the human or animal body to produce the parent hydroxy compound. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable ester forming groups for a hydroxy group include inorganic esters such as phosphate esters (including phosphoramidic cyclic esters). Further suitable pharmaceutically acceptable ester forming groups for a hydroxy group include Ci- i0alkanoyl groups such as acetyl, benzoyl, phenylacetyl and substituted benzoyl and phenylacetyl groups, Ci-i0alkoxycarbonyl groups such as ethoxycarbonyl, N,N -(Ci- 6)2carbamoyl, 2-dialkylaminoacetyl and 2-carboxyacetyl groups. Examples of ring substituents on the phenylacetyl and benzoyl groups include aminomethyl, N- alkylaminomethyl, A/,A/-dialkylaminomethyl, morpholinomethyl, piperazin-1 -ylmethyl and 4-(Ci-4alkyl)piperazin-1 -ylmethyl. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable ether forming groups for a hydroxy group include oc-acyloxyalkyl groups such as acetoxymethyl and pivaloyloxymethyl groups. [00113] A suitable pharmaceutically acceptable pro-drug of a compound of the formula I that possesses a carboxy group is, for example, an in vivo cleavable amide thereof, for example an amide formed with an amine such as ammonia, a Ci-4alkylamine such as methylamine, a (Ci-4alkyl)2amine such as dimethylamine, A/-ethyl-A/-methylamine or diethylamine, a Ci-4alkoxy- C2- alkylamine such as 2-methoxyethylamine, a phenyl-Ci- alkylamine such as benzylamine and amino acids such as glycine or an ester thereof. [00114] A suitable pharmaceutically acceptable pro-drug of a compound of the formula I that possesses an amino group is, for example, an in vivo cleavable amide derivative thereof. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable amides from an amino group include, for example an amide formed with Ci-i0alkanoyl groups such as an acetyl, benzoyl, phenylacetyl and substituted benzoyl and phenylacetyl groups. Examples of ring substituents on the phenylacetyl and benzoyl groups include aminomethyl, N- alkylaminomethyl, A/,A/-dialkylaminomethyl, morpholinomethyl, piperazin-1 -ylmethyl and 4-(Ci- alkyl)piperazin-1 -ylmethyl. [00115] The in vivo effects of a compound of the formula I may be exerted in part by one or more metabolites that are formed within the human or animal body after administration of a compound of the formula I. As stated hereinbefore, the in vivo effects of a compound of the formula I may also be exerted by way of metabolism of a precursor compound (a pro-drug). [00116] Though the present invention may relate to any compound or particular group of compounds defined herein by way of optional, preferred or suitable features or otherwise in terms of particular embodiments, the present invention may also relate to any compound or particular group of compounds that specifically excludes said optional, preferred or suitable features or particular embodiments. [00117] Suitably, the present invention excludes any individual compounds not possessing the biological activity defined herein. [00118] Suitably, (substantially) all compounds of the invention are suitable for treating type-2 diabetes. Compounds of the invention which are capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier, or those which may be otherwise formulated or derivatised (e.g. as a prodrug or appropriate salt) to do so, are suitably suitable for treating Alzheimer's disease. Synthesis [00119] The compounds of the present invention can be prepared by any suitable technique known in the art. Particular processes for the preparation of these compounds are described further in the accompanying examples. [00120] In the description of the synthetic methods described herein and in any referenced synthetic methods that are used to prepare the starting materials, it is to be understood that all proposed reaction conditions, including choice of solvent, reaction atmosphere, reaction temperature, duration of the experiment and workup procedures, can be selected by a person skilled in the art. [00121] It is understood by one skilled in the art of organic synthesis that the functionality present on various portions of the molecule must be compatible with the reagents and reaction conditions utilised. [00122] It will be appreciated that during the synthesis of the compounds of the invention in the processes defined herein, or during the synthesis of certain starting materials, it may be desirable to protect certain substituent groups to prevent their undesired reaction. The skilled chemist will appreciate when such protection is required, and how such protecting groups may be put in place, and later removed. [00123] For examples of protecting groups see one of the many general texts on the subject, for example, 'Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis' by Theodora Green (publisher: John Wiley & Sons). Protecting groups may be removed by any convenient method described in the literature or known to the skilled chemist as appropriate for the removal of the protecting group in question, such methods being chosen so as to effect removal of the protecting group with the minimum disturbance of groups elsewhere in the molecule. [00124] Thus, if reactants include, for example, groups such as amino, carboxy or hydroxy it may be desirable to protect the group in some of the reactions mentioned herein. [00125] By way of example, a suitable protecting group for an amino or alkylamino group is, for example, an acyl group, for example an alkanoyl group such as acetyl, an alkoxycarbonyl group, for example a methoxycarbonyl, ethoxycarbonyl or f-butoxycarbonyl group, an arylmethoxycarbonyl group, for example benzyloxycarbonyl, or an aroyl group, for example benzoyl. The deprotection conditions for the above protecting groups necessarily vary with the choice of protecting group. Thus, for example, an acyl group such as an alkanoyl or alkoxycarbonyl group or an aroyl group may be removed by, for example, hydrolysis with a suitable base such as an alkali metal hydroxide, for example lithium or sodium hydroxide. Alternatively an acyl group such as a ferf-butoxycarbonyl group may be removed, for example, by treatment with a suitable acid as hydrochloric, sulfuric or phosphoric acid or trifluoroacetic acid and an arylmethoxycarbonyl group such as a benzyloxycarbonyl group may be removed, for example, by hydrogenation over a catalyst such as palladium-on-carbon, or by treatment with a Lewis acid for example boron tris(trifluoroacetate). A suitable alternative protecting group for a primary amino group is, for example, a phthaloyl group which may be removed by treatment with an alkylamine, for example dimethylaminopropylamine, or with hydrazine. [00126] A suitable protecting group for a hydroxy group is, for example, an acyl group, for example an alkanoyl group such as acetyl, an aroyl group, for example benzoyl, or an arylmethyl group, for example benzyl. The deprotection conditions for the above protecting groups will necessarily vary with the choice of protecting group. Thus, for example, an acyl group such as an alkanoyl or an aroyl group may be removed, for example, by hydrolysis with a suitable base such as an alkali metal hydroxide, for example lithium, sodium hydroxide or ammonia. Alternatively an arylmethyl group such as a benzyl group may be removed, for example, by hydrogenation over a catalyst such as palladium-on-carbon. [00127] A suitable protecting group for a carboxy group is, for example, an esterifying group, for example a methyl or an ethyl group which may be removed, for example, by hydrolysis with a base such as sodium hydroxide, or for example a f-butyl group which may be removed, for example, by treatment with an acid, for example an organic acid such as trifluoroacetic acid, or for example a benzyl group which may be removed, for example, by hydrogenation over a catalyst such as palladium-on-carbon. [00128] Resins may also be used as a protecting group. [00129] The methodology employed to synthesise a compound of formula I will vary depending on the nature of Ri , R2, R3, R4, n, and Q, and any substituent groups associated therewith. Suitable processes for their preparation are described further in the accompanying Examples. [00130] Once a compound of formula I (or a protected precursor therefor) has been synthesised by any one of the processes defined herein, the processes may then further comprise the additional steps of: (i) removing any protecting groups present; (ii) converting the compound formula I into another compound of formula I; (iii) forming a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, hydrate or solvate thereof; and/or (iv) forming a prodrug thereof. [00131] An example of (ii) above is when a compound of formula I is synthesised and then one or more of the groups of Ri , R2, R3, R4, and Q,may be further reacted to change the nature of the group and provide an alternative compound of formula I. [00132] The resultant compounds of formula I can be isolated and purified using techniques well known in the art. [00133] The present invention provides a process for preparing a compound of formula I (as defined herein), the process comprising the steps of: reacting a compound of formul Formula A with a compound of formula B: 0 Q' Formula B to form a compound of formula Γ: Formula Γ wherein either: a) all of Ri', R2', R3', R4\ n, and Q' have any one of the meanings defined herein in relation to the respectively labelled Ri , R2, R3, R4, n and Q groups of Formula I such that the compound of Formula Γ is a compound of Formula I; or b) one or more of Ri', R2', R3', R4', and Q' are precursors to the corresponding Ri , R2, R3, R4 and Q groups in formula I as defined herein, in which case said compound of Formula Γ is thereafter transformed into the compound of Formula I by further reaction to convert any such precursor groups into a group Ri , R2, R3, R4, and Q of Formula I as defined herein; and optionally thereafter (and if necessary): (i) transforming the compound of Formula I into another compound of Formula I by, for example, converting one or more of Ri , R2, R3, R4 (if n is non-zero), and Q into another group Ri , R2, R3, R4 (if n is non-zero), and Q according to formula I defined herein; (ii) removing any protecting groups present (e.g. from the alcohol/phenol group); (iii) forming a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, hydrate or solvate thereof; and/or (iv) forming a prodrug thereof. [00134] Suitably the molar ratio of the compound of formula A to the compound of formula B is between 5:1 and 1 :5, most suitably between 1 :2 and 1 :4. Most suitably, an excess of the compound of formula B is used relative to the compound of formula A. [00135] Suitably, the process involves contacting the compounds of formula A and B with an electrophilic activator (e.g. acetic anhydride, acetyl chloride, etc.). Where acetic anhydride is the electrophilic activator compound, this may also serve as a solvent. [00136] Suitably, the process takes place at elevated temperature, suitably with the reaction mixture at a temperature at or above 60 °C, suitably at or above 100°C, suitably at or above 120°C. [00137] Suitably, the process involves contacting both of the compounds of formula A and B with a base or nucleophilic activator (e.g. pyridine). Such a step may also proceed in the presence of a protic solvent, such as water. Where pyridine is the base or nucleophilic activator, this may also serve as a solvent or co-solvent. Suitably, such a step takes place at elevated temperature, suitably with the reaction mixture at a temperature at or above 60 °C, suitably at or above 100°C, suitably at or above 120°C. [00138] Where one or more of Ri', R2', R3', R4' and Q' of Formula Γ are precursors to the corresponding Ri , R2, R3, R4 and Q groups in formula I, said one or more groups may be converted into a corresponding Ri , R2, R3, R4, and Q group of Formula I by subjecting the compound of formula Γ to appropriate deprotection conditions and/or by effecting a substitution of one or more of the Ri', R2', R3', R4', n, and Q' group(s) with a corresponding Ri , R2, R3, R4 and Q group of Formula I. [00139] The final compound of formula I may be obtained after purification by, for example, chromatography (e.g. flash silica chromatography) and/or recrystallisation. [00140] The compounds of Formula A and B are intermediates from which a variety of compounds of formula I can be made. [00141] In a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a compound of formula I obtainable by a process as defined herein. [00142] In a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a compound of formula I obtained by a process as defined herein. [00143] In a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a compound of formula I directly obtained by a process as defined herein. [00144] In a further aspect of the present invention there is provided a novel intermediate compound of formula A or B as defined herein. Biological Activity [00145] The biological assays described in Examples A and B herein may be used to measure the pharmacological effects of the compounds of the present invention. The pharmacological properties of compounds of the invention were studied by way of a dose response and IC50 against IAPP, a screen against Amyloid-beta (Αβ) peptides, and an in vivo screen with C. elegans. [00146] Although the pharmacological properties of the compounds of formula I vary with structural change, as expected, the compounds of the invention were found to be active in the assays described in Example A and/or Example B, with the exception of (£)- 2-(2-(6-chloropyridin-3-yl)vinyl)-5,7-dimethylquinolin-8-ol. Pharmaceutical Compositions [00147] According to a further aspect of the invention there is provided a pharmaceutical composition which comprises a compound of the invention as defined hereinbefore, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, hydrate or solvate thereof, in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent or carrier. [00148] The compositions of the invention may be in a form suitable for oral use (for example as tablets, lozenges, hard or soft capsules, aqueous or oily suspensions, emulsions, dispersible powders or granules, syrups or elixirs), for topical use (for example as creams, ointments, gels, or aqueous or oily solutions or suspensions), for administration by inhalation (for example as a finely divided powder or a liquid aerosol), for administration by insufflation (for example as a finely divided powder) or for parenteral administration (for example as a sterile aqueous or oily solution for intravenous, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal or intramuscular dosing or as a suppository for rectal dosing). [00149] The compositions of the invention may be obtained by conventional procedures using conventional pharmaceutical excipients, well known in the art. Thus, compositions intended for oral use may contain, for example, one or more colouring, sweetening, flavouring and/or preservative agents. [00150] An effective amount of a compound of the present invention for use in therapy is an amount sufficient to treat or prevent a condition referred to herein, slow its progression and/or reduce the symptoms associated with the condition. [00151] The amount of active ingredient that is combined with one or more excipients to produce a single dosage form will necessarily vary depending upon the individual treated and the particular route of administration. For example, a formulation intended for oral administration to humans will generally contain, for example, from 0.5 mg to 0.5 g of active agent (more suitably from 0.5 to 100 mg, for example from 1 to 30 mg) compounded with an appropriate and convenient amount of excipients which may vary from about 5 to about 98 percent by weight of the total composition. [00152] The size of the dose for therapeutic or prophylactic purposes of a compound of the formula I will naturally vary according to the nature and severity of the conditions, the age and sex of the animal or patient and the route of administration, according to well known principles of medicine. [00153] In using a compound of the invention for therapeutic or prophylactic purposes it will generally be administered so that a daily dose in the range, for example, 0.1 mg/kg to 75 mg/kg body weight is received, given if required in divided doses. In general lower doses will be administered when a parenteral route is employed. Thus, for example, for intravenous or intraperitoneal administration, a dose in the range, for example, 0.1 mg/kg to 30 mg/kg body weight will generally be used. Similarly, for administration by inhalation, a dose in the range, for example, 0.05 mg/kg to 25 mg/kg body weight will be used. Oral administration may also be suitable, particularly in tablet form. Typically, unit dosage forms will contain about 0.5 mg to 0.5 g of a compound of this invention.

EXAMPLES Materials and Equipment [00182] All reactions involving organometallic or other moisture-sensitive reagents were carried out under a nitrogen or argon atmosphere using standard vacuum line techniques and flame-dried glassware that was cooled under nitrogen before use. Solvents were dried according to the procedure outlined by Grubbs (Pangborn, A. B. G., M. A; Grubbs, R. H; Rosen, R. K; Timmers, F. J 1996, 15, 1518). Solvents were degassed by sparging with nitrogen gas for 30 minutes prior to use. Water was purified by an Elix® UV- 10 system. All other reagents were used as supplied (analytical or HPLC grade) without further purification. Organic layers were dried over MgS04. Petroleum ether (pet. ether) refers to the fraction of petrol boiling in the range of 40 - 60 °C; brine denotes a sat. aq. solution of NaCI. Thin layer chromatography was performed on aluminium plates coated with 60 F254 silica. Plates were visualised using UV light (254nm), iodine, or 1 % aq. KMn04. Flash column chromatography was performed on Macherery-Nagel Kieselgel 60M silica on a glass column. Melting points were recorded on a Gallenkamp Hot Stage apparatus and are reported uncorrected. IR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Tensor 27 FT-IR spectrometer with a diamond ATR module; selected characteristic peaks are reported in cm 1. NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker Advance spectrometers in d6-DMSO or CDCI3 unless otherwise stated. Chemical shifts (δ) are reported in ppm relative to residual deuterated solvent and coupling constants (J) are reported in Hz and rounded to the nearest 0.1 Hz. The multiplicity of each signal is designated using the following abbreviations; s, d, dd, t, dt, q, quin, m, comp, denoting singlet, doublet, doublet of doublets, triplet, doublet of triplets, quartet, quintet, multiplet and composite multiplet of non-magnetically equivalent protons respectively.

Example 32- Compound 326 (E)-5,7-dimethyl-2-(2-(2-methylpyridin- 3-yl)vinyl)quinolin-8-ol (Compound #326) Pharmacological Testing and Biological Assays Example A - In vitro assembly assay (IAPP and Αβ assays) [00212] The assay is based upon the altered fluorescent properties of the dye thioflavin T when it is intercalated into stacked beta-strand structures, which includes amyloid fibrils. The assay is carried out in multi-well plates in which the air-water interface (AW I) can be independently occluded at any time in the assay by the insertion in any well of a hydrophilic poly-methyl-methacrylate cylinder (Perspex). The cylinder consists of a rod of 6.6 mm in diameter and 6 mm in height with a hemispherical tip. This provides a close fit for the circular cross-section of the well, minimising residual air-water interface, and the hemispherical contour on the inserted end serves to ensure that no air bubbles are trapped on insertion. [00213] The assay has a final volume of 100 μΙ and contains a buffered isotonic solution (Phosphate Buffered Saline pH 7.4), 32 μΜ Thioflavin T (ThT), an amyloidogenic precursor peptide (Islet amyloid precursor polypeptide, IAPP at 4 μΜ, or Abeta1 -40 at 12 μΜ, final concentration). and added compounds at indicated concentrations (dissolved in dimethyl sulphoxide, DMSO) or DMSO alone. Purified synthetic peptides corresponding to IAPP (Bachem, Weil am Rhein, Germany) and A i-4o(EZBiolab, Carmel, IN, USA) were dissolved in DMSO, sonicated, and centrifuged for 1 hour at 15,000 g and 4°C before use (to remove any pre-aggregated species). [00214] The ThT fluorescence signal was measured at 1 minute intervals (excitation 450 nm, emission 480 nm) in a 96-well plate (black wall, clear bottom; Greiner Bio-One, Stonehouse, Gloucestershire, UK) without shaking at 37°C on a Polarstar plate reader (BMG Labtech, Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, UK). [00215] Any compound or physical device {e.g., Perspex cylinder) used was introduced at the same time in test (containing IAPP) and control wells (buffer and ThT without IAPP). Control values (with or without compounds or physical device) were subtracted from test values. At least 3 independent assays, with every assay done in duplicate wells, were performed and analyzed with the 2-sample t test. [00216] The basic assay and its validation and reproducibility, together with the demonstration of liposome-mediated acceleration of assembly, are described in Jean et al (2010) FASEB J 24 309-317. A more detailed description of the IAPP and Αβ thioflavin/cylinder assay is given in Jean et al (2012) Biophysical Journal 102 1 154-1 1 . [00217] The kinetics parameters were calculated from the ThT data as follows; the elongation rate was calculated from the slope at the inflection point of the sigmoidal curve; the plateau height was calculated by averaging the highest curve values (minimum of five values) attained at the end of the experiment; and the lag phase was calculated from the intercept on the time axis of the line formed tangent to the inflection point. At least three independent assays were performed, with every assay performed in duplicate wells. Statistical analysis was performed with the two-sample t-test. Details of the method of calculation of lag phase, elongation rate and plateau height are described in Trigg et al (2013) Biochemical Journal 456 67- 80. Results of Pharmacological Tests and Biological Assays [00218] The pharmacological properties of compounds of the invention were studied by way of a dose response and IC50 against IAPP, and a screen against Amyloid- beta (Αβ) peptides. The results are shown in Table 1 below. Table 1 -Results of in vitro and in vivo assays [00219] Suitably, a compound is considered active where it displays a ratio of IC 50+Awi / IC 50-Awi of greater than or equal to 1 , suitably greater than or equal to 5, most suitably greater than or equal to 8, especially for the lag phase, though preferably also for the elongation rate. [00220] Compounds 214, 236, 241 , 249 and 251 also showed activity in an in vivo C. elegans model.
