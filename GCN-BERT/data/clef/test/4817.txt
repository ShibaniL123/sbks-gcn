BACKGROUND ART In nature, biogenic crystals are often formed via amorphous precursors rather than classical nucleation and growth. Crystals grown in the laboratory by classical methods of nucleation and growth have facets dictated by the atomic structure and minimization of the surface free energy of the different orientation, wherein the facets are the low energy crystallographic planes (Vlachos et al., 1993). On the other hand, a remarkable outcome of crystal growth via an amorphous precursor is the ability of the organism to obtain unfaceted sculptured single crystals with rounded shapes including such crystals that are highly porous. Another outstanding advantage of growing crystals via this non-classical route is the fact that those crystals can be molded into any desired shape (Weiner et al., 2005, Weiner and Addadi, 2011, Fratzl et al., 2010, Sommerdijk and Cölfen, 2010). Attempts have been made to mimic the growth of biogenic crystals with intricate shapes and morphologies (Cölfen, 2008). Thus, e g., single crystals of calcite were grown through the amorphous calcium carbonate precursor phase on micropatterned templates induced by a self-assembled monolayer on the template surface (Aizenberg et al., 2003), and single crystals of, e.g., calcium carbonate, lead(II)sulfate, and strontium sulfate were grown, using a sponge-like polymer membrane as a template, while being constrained into intricate shapes using that template (Wucher et al., 2007; Yue et al., 2006; Meldrum et al., 2007, Park and Meldrum, 2002). These processes were carried out using ceramic materials found in biogenic material such as CaCO3, but no such attempts were made with widely used functional technological materials such as metals. Fashioning single crystals having curved intricate shapes from functional materials such as noble metals would have high research and technological potential, e.g., in photonics (micro-lenses and micro-mirrors) (Audran et al., 2010; Lee et al., 2012). Such crystals having highly porous morphology may be used in drug delivery or high adsorption sensors. With such functional materials as the starting point, however, obtaining the curved morphologies achieved in biogenic crystals requires additional fabrication steps such as sculpturing, drilling, and polishing the single crystals, or using standard nano- and micro-fabrication techniques (Audran et al., 2010; Corso et al., 2009; Lee et al., 2008). Polishing and microfabrication have been carried out on curved crystals obtained with gold, but the curvature was on a scale of millimeters and not microns (Corso et al., 2009). On the other hand, to the best of our knowledge, these procedures nave not been applied on micron-sized single crystals. SUMMARY OF INVENTION In one aspect, the present invention relates to a process for the preparation of micron-sized single curved crystals of a metal spread over a supporting substrate, said process comprising: (i) providing said substrate,(ii) depositing vapors of a first metal and of a second metal on a surface of said substrate, thus forming a substrate deposited with either a thin film comprising said first and second metals, or two thin films each comprising a different metal of said first and second metals;(iii) annealing said substrate deposited with said film(s) for a sufficient time period to form a eutectic melt that spontaneously dewets into micron-sized droplets spread over said substrate, said eutectic melt comprising two eutectic components at a selected composition ratio and characterized by a phase diagram, said eutectic components being said first and second metals; and (iv) cooling said eutectic melt to room temperature, or removing one of said eutectic components from said eutectic melt, to consequently grow a single curved crystal of one of said metals, according to said phase diagram, in each one of said droplets, said crystal being growing in the confined space of said droplet replicating the shape of said droplet, wherein said substrate being inert relative to said thin film(s) formed in step (ii); and the eutectic melt in step (iii) dewets within a temperature range allowing dewetting to occur prior to diffusion intermixing with said substrate and/or oxidizing.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Inspired by biogenic curved single crystals, as found herein in accordance with the present invention, micron-sized single crystals of a metal such as gold or germanium, exhibiting curved surfaces, can be grown from the confined volume of a droplet of a eutectic composition melt which forms via the dewetting of nanometric thin films, replicating the shape of the droplet, with no need of any fabrication steps. As particularly shown in Study 1 hereinafter, thin films of two materials which create eutectic microstructure one with each other (as exemplified herein, gold and germanium, or silver and germanium) are evaporated on a non-reactive surface. Heating the sample to the eutectic temperature leads to melting of the films and reveals a eutectic melt on the surface. By choosing an appropriate substrate with low surface energy, dewetting occurs and droplets of the melt are created. Then, fast cooling preserves the shape of the droplets and the eutectic microstructure. To achieve this phenomenon a number of factors must coexist. The substrate must be inert relative to the thin films, dewetting of the thin film melt must be achieved so as to create droplets on the surface, crystallization from a melt must be possible in the relevant environment, and the materials must not react (e.g., via oxidation) with the environment. As further found, the curvature of the micron-sized curved single crystals obtained can be controlled by controlling the environment in which the process is carried out, including parameters such as the contact angle and the curvature of the drops by changing the surface tension of the liquid drop during crystal growth. Study 1 further presents an energetic model that explains this phenomenon and predicts why and under which conditions crystals will be forced to grow with the curvature of the micro-droplet even though the energetic state of a curved single crystal is very high. Study 2 shows the preparation of nanoporous single crystals having micron size and intricate morphologies, based on the process shown in Study 1, wherein said process further comprises etching one of the components, following the cooling step, leading to a porous single crystal structure of the second component. In one aspect, the present invention thus relates to a process for the preparation of micron-sized single curved crystals of a metal spread over a supporting substrate, said process comprising: (i) providing said substrate;(ii) depositing vapors of a first metal and of a second metal on a surface of said substrate, thus forming a substrate deposited with either a thin film comprising said first and second metals, or two thin films each comprising a different metal of said first and second metals,(iii) annealing said substrate deposited with said film(s) for a sufficient time period to form a eutectic melt that spontaneously devests into micron-sized droplets spread over said substrate, said eutectic melt comprising two eutectic components at a selected composition ratio and characterized by a phase diagram, said eutectic components being said first and second metals; and(iv) cooling said eutectic melt to room temperature, or removing one of said eutectic components from said eutectic melt, to consequently grow a single carved crystal of one of said metals, according to said phase diagram, in each one of said droplets, said crystal being growing in the confined space of said droplet replicating the shape of said droplet, wherein said substrate being inert relative to said thin film(s) formed in step (ii), and the eutectic melt in step (iii) dewets within a temperature range allowing dewetting to occur prior to diffusion intermixing with said substrate and/or oxidizing. The term “single crystal” as used herein, also known as “monocrystalline solid”, refers to a material in which the crystal lattice of the entire sample is continuous and unbroken to the edges of the sample, with no grain boundaries. Such a monocrystal, having no defects associated with grain boundaries, has unique properties, particularly mechanical, optical and electrical, may also be anisotropic, depending on the type of crystallographic structure; and thus are industrially used in various applications, e.g., in optics and electronics. The single crystals prepared by the process of the present invention grow from the confined volume of a droplet of a eutectic composition melt which is formed via the dewetting of nanometric thin films. As shown herein, the curvature of these crystals can be controlled by controlling the environment in which the process is carried out, e.g., the contact angle and the curvature of the drops by changing the surface tension of the liquid drop during crystal growth. The term “single curved crystals” as used herein thus refers to a single crystal as defined above having the curvature resulting from the growth of said crystal in a confined space of a droplet. A phase diagram is a type of chart used to show conditions at which thermodynamically distinct phases can occur at equilibrium. The term “eutectic system” as used herein refers to a homogeneous solid mix of atomic species (e.g., Au—Ge or Ag—Ge as exemplified herein), to form a joint super-lattice, by striking a unique atomic percentage ratio between the components—as each pure component has its own distinct bulk lattice arrangement. It is only in this atomic/molecular ratio that the eutectic system melts as a whole, at a specific temperature (referred to as the eutectic temperature) the super-lattice releasing at once all its components into a liquid mixture. The term “eutectic melt” refers to a liquid that contains both elements, i.e., both eutectic components, from the described eutectic system. Further details about eutectic systems can be found in Callister, W. D.; and Rethwisch, D. G., Materials science and engineering: an introduction, 2007, 7, Wiley New York, the entire content of which being herewith incorporated by reference as if fully disclosed herein. According to the present invention, and as shown in the experimental section hereinafter, depending on certain parameters such as the ratio between the first and second metals, i.e., eutectic components, in the eutectic melt formed in step (iii) of said process, the single curved crystals obtained in step (v) may each be fully or partially wrapped with a solid phase having a eutectic microstructure. In such cases, the process of the present invention may further comprise removal of the other one of said metals from the solid phase to thereby obtain single curved crystals of said one of said metals having a center and a nanoporous structure wrapping said center. In particular such cases, the process of the invention practically comprises wet etching of the other one of said metals. Micron-sized single curved crystals obtained in such cases are, in fact, partially nanoporous. In other cases shown herein, the eutectic melt formed in step (iii) of said process comprises the eutectic concentration of the eutectic components, i.e., first and second metals, and step (iv) comprises cooling of said eutectic melt to room temperature to consequently form a eutectic phase microstructure comprising said single curved crystal. In such cases, the process of the present invention may further comprise removal of the other one of said metals from said solid phase having a eutectic microstructure. In particular such cases, the process of the invention practically comprises wet etching of the other one of said metals. Micron-sized single curved crystals obtained in such cases are thus fully nanoporous, i.e., have a center and a nanoporous structure wrapping said center. The single crystals exemplified herein, e.g., the Au or Ge single crystals, were grown within micro droplets of a eutectic melt of said two metals prepared by, first, depositing vapors of Au and Ge on the surface of the supporting substrate, forming two adjacent thin films each comprising a different one of these metals. Nevertheless, it should be understood that according to the present invention, vapors of the metals required so as to form, upon annealing, the eutectic melt may be deposited on the surface of the substrate at any sequential order as well as concurrently (forming a single thin film comprising the two metals), depending, inter alia, on the deposition technique or equipment utilized. Step (ii) of the process of the present invention comprises annealing of the substrate with the thin film(s) deposited thereon, for a sufficient period of time, to form—upon reaching the eutectic temperature—a eutectic melt comprising said first and second metals as the two eutectic components, at a predetermined composition ratio. The eutectic melt formed spontaneously dewets into micro droplets spread over said substrate, in which the single crystals are then grown. The annealing may be carried out under any atmospheric conditions, providing that the thin film(s) material is not strongly oxidized before the film(s) dewets. In particular cases, the annealing is conducted under nitrogen, forming gas (i.e., a mixture of hydrogen and nitrogen, usually generated upon dissociation of ammonia), or argon atmosphere, or under vacuum. The supporting substrate used in the process of the present invention may be made of any suitable material, provided that said substrate is inert relative to the thin film(s) formed on its surface, i.e., has no chemical interaction with said film(s); and that the eutectic melt formed in step (iii) dewets within a temperature range allowing dewetting to occur prior to diffusion intermixing with said substrate. In certain embodiments, the supporting substrate used according to the process of the present invention is either made of or coated with silicon dioxide (silica), titanium dioxide (titania), magnesium oxide (magnesia), or aluminum oxide (alumina). In other embodiments, the supporting substrate used is a spinel, i.e., a mineral of the general formula A2+B3+2O2−4, which crystallizes in the cubic (isometric) crystal system, wherein the oxide anions arranged in a cubic close-packed lattice, and the cations A and B occupying some or all of the octahedral and tetrahedral sites in the lattice, and are being selected from divalent, trivalent or quadrivalent cations of magnesium, zinc, iron, manganese, aluminum, chromium, titanium or silicon (A and B may also be the same metal with different oxidation states, i.e., under different charges, e.g., Fe2+Fc3+2O2−4 (magnetic; Fe3O4). Examples of spinels include, without being limited to, aluminum spinels such as MgAl2O4, BeAl2O4, ZnAl2O4, FeAl2O4 and MnAl2O4, iron spinels such as CuFe2O4, MnFe2O4, MgFe2O4, Fe3O4, NiFe2O4 and TiFe2O4, and chromium spinels such as FeCr2O4, MgCr2O4, ZnCr2O4. In certain embodiments, the first and second metals used in the process of the present invention are selected from Au, Ag, Ge, Cu, or Pt, i.e., the eutectic melt from which the single crystals are grown comprises a composition of any two of said metals, i.e., Au—Ag, Au—Ge, Au—Cu, Au—Pt, Ag—Ge, Ag—Cu, Ag—Pt, Ge—Cu, Ge—Pt, or Cu—Pt, and the single curved crystals obtained in step (iv) are substantially made of one of the metals of the combination used, according to the phase diagram of the eutectic melt and the condition of the process as described in the experimental section. In particular embodiments exemplified herein, the eutectic components utilized are Au and Ge, or Ag and Ge, and the single curved crystals obtained are substantially made of one of the metals of the combination used, according to the phase diagram of the eutectic melt and the condition of the process. As shown herein, the shape of the single curved crystals obtained by the process of the present invention is determined by the shape of the confining micron-sized droplet formed during the annealing step; and moreover, the shape of those micron-sized droplets can be controlled, practically controlling the shape of the single curved crystals obtained by the process, by changing the contact angle and the droplet curvature, which is affected by the surface tension. The parameter with the greatest influence on the shape of the droplets was found to be the oxygen partial pressure in the annealing environment, wherein alteration in oxygen partial pressure changed the contact angle and the surface tension of the droplet. In certain embodiments, the shape of the micron-sized droplets formed in step (iii) of said process is controlled, e.g., by changing the contact angle and the droplet curvature, more particularly by altering the oxygen partial pressure in the annealing environment. The product obtained by the process of the invention as defined above is a supporting substrate on which the single curved crystals grown are spread. Such products may be used for various applications, e.g., in micro-lenses, micro-mirrors, micro-reflectors, micro-antennas, electrodes, and batteries, and may be predesigned so as to get a particular required pattern of the single crystals over the substrate. Yet, in certain embodiments, the process as defined above, is any one of its embodiments, further comprises the step of segregating, i.e., harvesting, the single curved crystals obtained from said supporting substrate. This step may be carried out utilizing any available technology suitable for this purpose. In another aspect, the present invention provides a supporting substrate having micron-sized single curved crystals of a metal spread thereover, obtained by the process of the invention In a further aspect, the present invention provides a micron-sized single curved crystal of a metal. In certain embodiments, the micron-sized single curved crystals of the present invention are obtained by the process defined above, provided that said process comprises the step of segregating, i.e., harvesting, the single curved crystals from the supporting substrate. Particular such micron-sized single curved crystals are those wherein the curvature of the crystal results from growth of said crystal in a confined space of a micron-sized droplet. As shown herein, specific such single curved crystals may be fully or partially nanoporous. The micron-sized single curved crystals of the invention may be used in various technological applications, e.g., optics and electronics, as well as drug delivery. In still other aspects, the present invention provides a micro-lense, micro-mirror, micro-reflector, micro-antenna, electrode, or battery comprising micron-sized single curved crystals of a metal as defined above, e.g., micron-sized single curved crystals of a metal obtained by the process of the invention, including such crystals that are either partially or fully nanoporous The invention will now be illustrated by the following non-limiting Examples. EXAMPLES Study 1 Preparation of Micron-Sized Single Curved Crystals of Metals Materials and Methods Sample Preparation. SiO2 (100 nm) was grown on (001) Si wafers by thermal oxidation at 1100° C. Gold and germanium (99.999% pure, Sigma-Aldrich) were evaporated onto the SiO2 substrate in an e-beam-equipped AircoTemescal FC-1800 evaporating system under a high vacuum of 10−7 Torr, at room temperature, yielding a normal deposition rate of 8 Ås−1. Thermal annealing of Au—Ge samples was performed at 550° C. in a nitrogen environment (99.999%) for 10 min to 3 h in a laboratory tube oven with gas flow, and in an Anton Paar DHS 1100 Domed Hot Stage connected to a rotation pump. Sample Characterization. For surface imaging by SEM, an FEI ESEM Quanta 200 (combining EDS and EBSD) and a Zeiss Ultra plus HRSEM, were used. Cross-section micrographs were obtained using a Strata 400 STEM dual-beam FIB field emission scanning electron microscope. TEM diffraction was obtained utilizing a Titan 80-300 KeV FEG-S/TEM. The single crystal was characterized with the micro-diffraction technique at the ID13 Microfocus Beamline of the ESRF, Grenoble, France. One branch of this beamline is specialized on scanning nano-beam diffraction experiments. Synchrotron light focused by means of Si-based compound refractive lenses in crossed geometry, so-called nano-focusing lenses, at a wavelength of 0.832 Å was utilized for the experiment. The beam size was 170×150 nm2 (full width of half maximum of the beam intensity) delivering a flux of 1010 photons/sec in the focal spot. The sample position was controlled via piezo stages with 20 nm resolution. Two-dimensional maps of diffraction patterns have been recorded using a FRELON CCD detector with 2048×2048 pixels of 50 μm in size In the present study we were able to produce curved micron-sized gold single crystals by utilizing confined droplets within which a single growing crystal could be confined. The idea was that if we could control the size and shape of the droplet, we would be able to control the size and shape of the single crystal growing inside it. The mechanism we employed for the formation of such droplets was the dewetting phenomenon of nanometric thin films. To introduce dewetting into liquid droplets, a thin film needs to be brought to its melting point. A eutectic system such as Au—Ge seemed an ideal choice for this purpose owing to relatively low temperature at which the liquid state can be achieved (TE=361° C.) (Okamoto and Massalski, 1984). If a eutectic film of Au—Ge is deposited on a non-wetting surface such as SiO2, on reaching the eutectic temperature it dewets and produces liquid droplets Metal nano- and micro-nanoparticles are widely used in a variety of applications, such as magnetic memory arrays (Cheng et al., 2001, Klemmer et al., 2003), plasmonic waveguides (Maier et al., 2003), plasmonic sensors (Mitsui et al., 2004), biological sensors (Fritzsche and Taton, 2003) and catalysis of other structures such as nanowires and nanofiber growth (Guan et al., 2008, Kodambaka et al., 2007). One of the applications for Au nanoparticles is catalytic growth of nanostructures such as carbon nanotubes (Yun et al., 2008) and germanium nanowires (Adhikari et al., 2006) Growing of metal nano- and micro-particles can be achieved by different methods, e.g., by self-assembly chemical processes (Tao et al., 2008), lithography (Lee et al., 2008), or dewetting of thin films through solid (Kwon et al., 2013) or liquid state dewetting (Kojima and Kato, 2008). The dewetting process can be reached by different techniques, such as thermal annealing (Carey et al., 2003), electron beam (Kojima and Kato, 2008) or lasers (Corso et al., 2009). In the present study we produced Au—Ge thin films by evaporating thin layers of Au and Ge on oxidized Si wafers. The thicknesses of the films were altered (Au 100-200 nm, Ge 50-100 nm) according to the composition ratio needed. For example, to achieve a eutectic melt composition (28 at % Ge), the Au and Ge thin films were 150 nm and 78 nm thick, respectively. Samples were annealed at 550° C. for durations varying from 10 min to 3 h, and were then cooled to a room temperature at the rate of 200° C. min−1 The annealing environment was N2 (99.999%), with or without pump purging prior to annealing (pump purging reached 10−3 torr before annealing) During the annealing process, dewetting led to the formation of droplets of Au—Ge under which Au single crystals were formed (FIG. 1) EDS examination of the single crystals proved that they were gold and that the surrounding eutectic phase contained a combination of gold, germanium and oxygen (oxidized Ge) (FIG. 2). The single crystals inside the droplets were further examined by EBSD (FIG. 3). The EBSD mapping of these gold crystals over an area of 5×5 μm2 revealed identical EBSP over the entire scanned area, affirming that these were indeed single crystals. As the EBSD signal comes from nearly 100 nm below the surface, we wanted to further confirm that these crystals are single throughout their entire volume. To this end we prepared cross-sections of these droplets utilizing a FIB. This enabled us to observe that each crystal was faceted inside the droplet but possessed a curved surface confined by the droplet's surface. Moreover, the three-dimensional curvature of these single crystals was identical to that of the droplets (FIG. 4A). Using FIB we sliced about a hundred droplets, all of which revealed similar internal crystal morphologies and curved surfaces In our opinion, the only way to create a curved surface from a single crystal of gold is by the formation of atomic steps on the surface, while a higher degree of curvature will lead to a higher density of atomic steps (Corso et al., 2009). The morphology of the faceted area of the gold single crystals inside a droplet is a truncated octahedron, which is the most preferable equilibrium shape of gold (FIG. 4C) (Barnard et al., 2005) The exposed facets within the droplet (not on the droplet's surface) reveal the {111} and {110} planes of the truncated octahedron. The facets that can be seen in the FIB cross sections depend on the relative orientation of the cutting during the FIB cross section preparation. In relation to the orientation of the single crystals of gold relatively to the substrate, we can conclude that in most cases the orientation is that of the {111} or close to it. As part of our quest to confirm the single crystal nature of the curved gold crystals, we performed TEM on thin cross-sections of droplets prepared using the FIB (FIG. 4B). By performing selective area diffraction in the TEM from an area with a diameter of 500 nm, we were able to observe a single crystal diffraction pattern that could be fully indexed within the gold structure Identical electron diffraction patterns were obtained from all parts of the single crystal. In order to obtain additional proof that these crystals were single, we also used sub-micron scanning synchrotron diffractometry (ID13, ESRF, Grenoble, France) on a FIB-sectioned crystal of gold (FIG. 5A) At each point of the scanned area (1793 scanning points) the same thermal diffuse scattering pattern of a bulk single crystal was observed (Xu, 2010). We also verified this by averaging all the 1793 diffraction images from the different locations of the crystal, and found that this integrated image remained identical to any one of the individual diffraction images (FIGS. 5C-5D). For quantitative comparison of both diffractions presented in FIGS. 5C-5D, the scattering intensity was plotted for two different azimuthal angles as a function or radial distance (FIG. 6). Therefore, it could be seen that the bright diffraction spots in both FIGS. 5C-5D generated peaks in the same azimuthal angle and same radial distance (d-spacing). Furthermore, a single crystal Kossel line pattern emerging from Bragg-type diffraction of gold X-ray fluorescence radiation generated by the primary beam was clearly visible in the averaged pattern (Kossel et al., 1935). An indication of this Kossel pattern, however noisy, can even be seen on the individual patterns (on high quality displays) The lines appear very pronounced when zooming in to a high pass filtered version of the averaged image (FIG. 5E). These two latter experiments provided conclusive proof that the curved gold crystals were indeed perfect single crystals. In addition to the demonstration that curved single gold crystals can be grown, we wanted to show that the shape of the single crystals can be controlled. This is an extremely important feature for any potential application of such curved crystals Having shown that the shape of the single crystals is determined by the shape of the confining droplet, we now aimed to control the droplet shape. This can be done by changing the contact angle and the droplet curvature, which is affected by the surface tension. The parameter with the greatest influence on the shape of the droplets was found to be the oxygen partial pressure in the annealing environment. The size of the drop did not influence the droplet shape, as the droplet was much smaller than capillary size (2.6 mm for liquid gold) In samples that were vacuum-pumped (10−3 torr) prior to the flow of inert N2 (99.999%) the contact angle was in the range of 90°-110°, whereas in samples prepared under an ambient flow of N2 with no pre-pumping, the contact angle was in the range of 20°-45° (FIG. 7). According to the Young-Laplace equation, the change in the contact angle is affected by the surface tension of the droplet, the surface energy of the substrate, and the interfacial energy between them Our results showed that the alteration in oxygen partial pressure changed the contact angle and the surface tension of the droplet In producing such crystals of various materials, however, several guidance rules or conditions need to be met. These are discussed below. The concept of growing curved single crystals by crystallization from a melt within a micro-droplet, as described above, is a simple one; however, in translating this concept technically into a generalized phenomenon, a number of guiding principles must apply. First, there must be no interaction (such as diffusion) between the thin film and the supporting substrate, as this would not only lead to a change in the composition of the film but would also enhance wetting (thus obviously preventing dewetting). In the specific system presented here (Au—Ge on Si), a eutectic reaction occurs at the relatively low temperature of 363° C. (Okamoto and Massalski, 1984) and would instantly lead to rapid diffusion of gold into silicon, thereby instantly shifting the eutectic Au—Ge composition from its original one. Because we have previously found the native Si oxide to be insufficient as a barrier to diffusion, a thick (˜100 nm) oxide layer was thermally grown and served as an effective diffusion barrier (Borukhin and Pokroy, 2011) Evaporation of gold on the SiO2 was followed by a germanium evaporation. This sequence prevented direct contact between Ge and SiO2, which would have led to wetting rather than dewetting (Sangiorgi et al., 1988; Eustathopoules and Drevet, 1998). The second rule is that the composition of the thin films should be chosen such that the ensuing liquid phase causes the crystallization process to be rapid and large single crystals to be formed from the melt (fast diffusion) In our system we utilize the eutectic phase diagram, which shows that in this way the crystallization can be achieved by crossing the solidus line either vertically, by slow cooling, or horizontally, by slow removal of one of the eutectic components. In the Au—Ge system we can start either from a hypoeutectic composition crossing the solidus line vertically, or from a eutectic composition crossing the solidus line horizontally by annealing in an environment that contains oxygen. It turns out that by this latter route germanium oxidizes finally to GeO, which easily sublimes and leads to GeO evaporation (Oh and Campbell, 2004). The result of this process is the precipitation of gold. The third governing rule is that the material of the thin films should not strongly oxidize before the film dewets, and should melt within a temperature range that will allow dewetting to occur prior to diffusion intermixing with the substrate. In the system used herein, the eutectic temperature of the Au—Ge is relatively low. Because the Ge thin film is the upper one, its surface harbors a native Ge oxide, however, this oxide desorbs from the surface during the annealing, leaving only Ge on the surface (Oh and Campbell, 2004), and therefore does not interfere with the dewetting process. The method described herein for growing curved crystals will work only when all three of the above guidelines are followed. Having shown not only that curved single crystals can be obtained but also that their curvature can be controlled, we wanted to further show that this is not indeed an isolated phenomenon but a general one. We successfully demonstrated this by growing Ge single crystals in the Au—Ge system using a hypereutectic concentration (obtained by changing the initial thickness of the evaporated thin films (120 nm Au, 107 nm Ge) to obtain a hypereutectic concentration of the melt (40 at % Ge, FIG. 8A). Yet another system we tested was the Ag—Ge thin films, evaporated on the oxidized Si substrates (Ag 40 nm, Ge 212 nm, 20 at % Ag), followed by annealing at 850° C. for 10 min and then cooling to room temperature at the rate of 200° C. min−1 in a forming gas environment (7.5% H2+N2, 99.99%) Ge single crystals were observed inside the droplets, confined by the shape of the droplets (FIG. 8B). To understand the energetic considerations that allow for growth of the curved single crystals, we have developed an energetic model. Surface energy can be estimated by a number of broken or altered interatomic bonds. The energy required to generate two surfaces of area 2A is the following: [in-line-formulae]E=Ans(zb−zs)Ess (1),[/in-line-formulae] where Ess is the bond energy between the pair of nearest atoms, zb and zs are the numbers of nearest neighbors for bulk and surface atoms, and ns is the surface density of atoms. The number (zb−zs) is the number of broken bonds The surface tension (γsv) of the solid/vacuum surface is given by: γ sv = E 2  A = 1 2  n s  ( z b - z s )  E ss ( 2 ) The surface tension of the solid/liquid surface can be evaluated in a similar way as γ sl = E 2   A = 1 2  n s  ( z b - z s )  ( E ss - E sl ) , ( 3 ) where Esl is the bonding energy of a surface atom with neighboring atoms in liquid. Here we assume that the number of nearest neighbors in the liquid and in the solid is the same. This will be true if the liquid is the melt of a solid or a liquid solution based on the same element. From (2) and (3) we obtain: E sl = E ss  ( 1 - γ sl γ sv ) ( 4 ) Let us compare the change in the Gibbs free energy for two cases: 1) an additional atom adheres to a surface of solid gold under the liquid and remains under the liquid; 2) an additional atom adheres to a surface of solid gold under the liquid but is brought out of the liquid. In the first case, the additional atom may increase the number of (s−l) bonds to a value nsl. If the atom adheres to the ledge or step, this number will be smaller than in the case of ideal surface. The adherence will cause the following change in the Gibbs free energy: [in-line-formulae]Δg1=Δμls+ΔE1 (5),[/in-line-formulae] where Δμls is the difference of chemical potentials of a gold atom in a bulk solid and liquid, ΔE1=nsl(Ess−Esl) is the change in surface energy related to the adhered atom. In the second case, the Gibbs free energy change will be the following: [in-line-formulae]Δg2=Δμls+ΔE2 (6),[/in-line-formulae] where ΔE2=nssEss−n′sl(Ess−Esl) is the corresponding change in the surface energy, nss is the number of new broken (s-s) bonds generated by the additional atom and n′sl is the number of “closed” (s-l) bonds. The difference between these two energies is given by: [in-line-formulae]Δg2−Δg1=ΔE2−ΔE1=(nss−nsl−nsl)Ess+(nsl+nsl)Esl (7)[/in-line-formulae] In the FCC gold lattice zb=12 At the ideal (111) surface the atom has zs=9 nearest neighbors. If an additional Au atom adheres to this surface, it may have 3 nearest bonds in the case of the ideal surface, 6 bonds if it adheres to the ledge, and 9 bonds if it adheres to the step. In the limit case, when the energy change ΔE1 is maximal and the ΔE2 is minimal: nsl=6, nss=3, n′sl=3, the energy difference (7) is minimal. Combined with relation (4) it is given by: Δ   g 2 - Δ   g 1 = 9   E sl - 6   E ss = 3  E sl  ( γ sv - 3   γ sl γ sv - γ sl ) ( 8 ) As can be seen, this difference is positive for γ sl < 1 3  γ sv . Applying the values of gold surface energies, γ sv = 1.283  J m 2 , γ sl = 0.187  J m 2 (Armstrong et al., 2012, Jian et al., 2002), it may be concluded that adherence of the gold atoms from the liquid to the solid/liquid interface is more favorable than adherence to the facets entering from the liquid to a vapor. Study 2 Preparation of Metal Nanoporous Single Crystal Micron Particles Nanoporous gold has a high interest for applications such as catalysis (Ding et al., 2004; Zielasek et al., 2006), sensors (Hieda et al., 2004), actuators (Kramer et al., 2004) and electrochemical electrodes (Land et al., 2011) due to its very high surface area. Nanoporous gold has a very high strength, as strong as bulk Au (Biener et al., 2006). One of the most common ways to receive nanoporous gold is by using dealloying of Au—Ag alloy by selective removal of the Ag by using a corrosive environment, such as HNO3 solution (Forty, 1979; Hodge et al., 2005). The nanoporous gold prepared by dealloying has a nano-crystalline structure (Hodge et al., 2005). In previous research works it was shown that grain boundaries in thin film of gold enhance the electrical resistivity of the gold due to grain-boundary scattering of the electrons (De Vries, 1987; Zhang et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2011). Therefore, relatively to porous polycrystalline gold, the conductivity of porous single crystal will be significantly higher Materials and Methods Sample Preparation: SiO2 (100 nm) was grown on (001) Si wafers by thermal oxidation at 1100° C. The oxide layer was used as a diffusion barrier for the preventing of Si migration from the wafer Gold and Germanium films (99.999% pure, Sigma Aldrich) were evaporated onto the SiO2 substrate in an e-beam-equipped Airco Temescal FC-1800 evaporating system under a high vacuum of 10−7 Torr, at room temperature, yielding normal deposition rate of 8 Ås−1. The thicknesses of the gold and germanium films were 150 nm and 78 nm, respectively. Thermal annealing was performed at 650° C. for 5 min in a MILA-5000, ULVAC-RICO RTA, in an ambient flow of Ar—H2 (99.999%, 150 sccm) with heating rate of 10° C.s−1. Cooling rate was approximately 1° C.s−1 Wet etching of the samples was performed by immersing the samples in a solution of NH4OH:H2O2 (1:25% vol) for 7 min, followed by rinsing in DI water and then in ethanol. Cross section samples were obtained using a Strata 400 STEM dual-beam focused ion beam (FIB) field emission scanning electron microscope. Ar ion milling was then used for final thinning and cleaning of the surface utilizing the Gentle Mill 3HI, TechnoOrg Linda. Ion milling was done at 17° milling angle with anode voltage of 0.35 kV. Sample Characterization. Surface imaging was performed using Zeiss Ultra plus HRSEM, combined with EDS. Cross section micrographs were obtained using a Strata 400 STEM dual-beam FIB field emission scanning electron microscope. HRTEM diffraction was obtained utilizing Titan 80-300 KeV FEG-S/TEM. The single crystal was characterized by nano-focus beam X-ray analysis at the ID13, ESRF, Grenoble, France The sample was rotated from −45° to 45°, with 1° intervals. After each interval the sample was scanned with a 200×150 nm focused beam, of wavelength 0.83189 Å. Results Evaporated two layer thin film thickness was chosen to suit the eutectic ratio, which is 28 at % Ge in the Au—Ge system (Okamoto and Massalski, 1984). This way annealing above the eutectic temperature led to melting of the thin films and to formation of eutectic melt. By choosing the SiO2 substrate we enabled the formation of droplets of this melt through the dewetting process. Cooling below the eutectic temperature revealed solidification of the eutectic liquid into a eutectic-like solid structure. Wet etching of the samples in order to remove the germanium revealed droplets of gold as seen in FIG. 10A EDS examination of the microstructure confirmed that the Ge was fully removed during the etching (Ge concentration in the eutectic-like structure before the etching was ˜14 at %, while after the etching it was near zero; relatively high amount of C and O contamination was found on the surface; and 5-7 at % of Si was found in each spectrum, probably due to S1 contamination from the wafer during the FIB milling, see Table 1). FIB was utilized to obtain a cross section of the droplets and provided a closer look on the microstructure of the gold inside the droplet (FIGS. 10B-C). TABLE 1 EDS examination of the eutectic microstructure before and after Ge etching at % C O Si Ge Au Before Ge etching 20.37 15.87 5.33 13.68 44.75 After Ge etching 21.37 14.88 5.95 0.37 57.43 By altering the cooling rate of the samples, different micro- and nano-structures could be achieved (FIG. 11). The approximate size of the structural units in the solid droplet after the cooling With the rate 35° C.s−1 was about 60 nm and 40 nm for gold and germanium, respectively (FIG. 11A). For slow cooling (35° C.min−1) the approximate sizes of the gold and the germanium units were about 300 and 70 nm, respectively (FIG. 11B) HRTEM microscopy was performed on a thin cross section of a droplet, prepared utilizing the FIB. STEM micrograph of the sample cross section is presented in FIG. 12A. By performing selective area diffraction from an area with a diameter of approximately 4 μm, in the center of the droplet (which is the main part of the droplet) (FIG. 12B), we were able to observe a single crystal diffraction pattern that could be fully indexed within the gold structure (FIG. 12C). This indicates that the gold in the eutectic-like structure was solidified into a single crystal By changing the initial thin film thickness of the Au and Ge during the evaporation, hypoeutectic concentration of the melt can be achieved (Koifman Khristosov et al., 2014). In this way a droplet with gold single crystal and a eutectic structure wrapping the gold was created. After etching the Ge, a cross section of the droplet was examined utilizing HRTEM (FIG. 13A). By performing selective area diffraction from an area with a diameter of 0.5 μm in different parts of the droplets, we were able to observe a single crystal diffraction pattern that could be fully indexed within the gold structure. Identical electron diffraction patterns were obtained from different locations of the droplet cross section. The diffraction patterns were taken from the gold single crystal in the center (marked as 1), and from both gold porous regions on the left and the right side of the single crystal (marked as 2 and 3) (FIG. 13B). From those results we can conclude that all three areas have the same orientation, and this indicates that the gold in the eutectic-like structure was solidified into a single crystal as a continuation of the micron-sized single crystal in the center of the droplet. To obtain additional proof that the porous gold was a single crystal we further used sub-micron scanning synchrotron diffractometry (ID13, ESRF, Grenoble, France) on a FIB-sectioned crystal of gold. The same droplet cross section that was investigated utilizing HRTEM (FIG. 12) was scanned and revealed diffraction pattern from all parts of the droplet (FIG. 14). FIG. 14A shows a map of a single reflection ({200} planes. 0° rotation). The same reflection occurs throughout the drop at nearly the same coordinates, with only some variations in intensity FIG. 14B shows an average of all the diffractions from the drop area, and a single diffraction from the middle of the drop is shown on FIG. 14C From these images it is evident, that the major reflections do not shift in their position throughout the drop. FIGS. 14D-E represent the azimuthally regrouped central diffraction with markings for gold crystallographic planes, and rocking curve for the same reflection. The mean intensity over the drop as well as the 10, 30 70 and 90% are shown. Results for {220} planes are shown in FIG. 15. These two latter experiments provided conclusive proof that the curved gold crystals were indeed single crystals. The surface area of the porous Au was further estimated by analyzing HRSEM micrographs of the cross section. High resolution micrographs of the eutectic microstructure were taken and analyzed using ANALYSIS software. For surface area calculations we assumed that the microstructure of the eutectic phase is a rod-like Therefore, calculating the surface area of the gold can be done by measuring the length of the surface on a cross section, and then multiplying by the length of the rod. This calculation revealed a surface area ˜1.5 m2gr−1 of gold Discussion HRTEM and synchrotron investigations revealed that the porous gold structure, both in eutectic and hypoeutectic droplets, is a single crystal. This result revealed continuous growth of a single gold crystal during formation of the eutectic-like two phase structure during the solidification. In the case of the hypoeutectic concentration of the melt, droplet consisted of a gold single crystal in the center and a two-phase eutectic structure which wraps the crystal. Electron diffraction patterns (FIG. 13) indicate that the large gold single crystal grown during the cooling above the eutectic temperature could induce the crystallization of the gold inside the eutectic structure as its own continuation. In the case of a fully eutectic structure, the volume ratio VAu/VGe=1.92 makes possible continuous growth of gold crystal throughout the whole droplet, accompanied by repeated nucleation and growth of rod-like germanium crystal channels surrounded by gold matrix. Let us consider crystallization process in a eutectic system Au—Ge. Normal crystallization of non-equilibrium eutectic liquid starts usually with heterohenious nucleation of one solid phase, most likely Au in our case, at the liquid/substrate interface After that, the adjacent liquid is substantially enriched by Ge providing heterogeneous and epitaxial (if possible) nucleation of Ge crystal at the surface of this Au crystal. Formation is governed by the free energy gain due to undercooling below eutectic temperature, ΔT=(Teut−T), when atoms are transferring from liquid to the crystal: [in-line-formulae]ΔGtr=(Teut−T)ΔStr (1),[/in-line-formulae] where ΔStr is the entropy change in transformation L(eutectic)→Au(s)+Ge(s), and the extra energy is needed to create the solid-liquid and Au(s)/Ge(s) interfaces. The epitaxial growth of Ge on Au is possible with the following crystallographic orientation relationships (Sayed and Buriak, 2010); Au(111)[11 2]//Ge(111)[11 2] and Au( 111)[11 2]//Ge(111)[11 2] which may provide relatively low interface energy. Growth of the eutectic structure is controlled by volume diffusion in the liquid in front of the freezing solid/liquid interface. The growth rate can be evaluated according to the simple model suggested by Turnbull (1955) V = kD  Δ   X λ = kD  Δ   X 0 λ  ( 1 - λ * λ ) , ( 2 ) where D is the diffusion coefficient in liquid, ΔX is the composition difference in the liquid above the freezing interface across the lamella spacing λ, and is the function of undercooling ΔT, ΔX0 is the composition difference for λ→∞, k−1 is a geometry dependent coefficient, λ′ is the critical lamella spacing defined by Zener (1946) λ * = 2   γ αβ   v mol Δ   G tr = 2   γ αβ   v mol Δ   T   Δ   S tr , ( 3 ) where γαβ is solid/solid (Au/Ge) interface energy and vmol is the liquid molar volume Using the transformation entropy value for Au—Ge system (Wang et al., 2009) ΔSlr=23.9 Jmol−1·K−1, and assuming γαβ=(0.2+0.4) Jm−2 and ΔT=(10+20)K, one can estimate from eq. (3) the value of critical width of lamellae: λ′=(8+32) nm, which are comparable with the half of the observed lamella spacing (70+100) nm. The relatively small supercoolings are attributed to the heterogeneous character of nucleation. These supercoolings correspond to a composition difference in the couple zone of Au/Ge phase diagram (Wang et al., 2009) ΔX0=0.01÷0.02 The self-diffusion coefficient in the liquid gold was found from viscosity experiments at high temperatures (Ofte, 1967) in the range of 2.02·109 to 3.35·10−9 m2s−1 between 1063° C. and 1364° C. with activation energy Ea=0.316 eV One can evaluate the diffusion coefficient in the undercooled eutectic liquid by extrapolation of these values to low temperatures as D=D0 exp(−Ea/kBT) with D0=3.1·10−8 m2s−1 that gives ˜8.5·10−11 m2s−1 for the eutectic temperature. Now we may estimate the growth rate and the time of full crystallization of the eutectic structure. The growth rate is evaluated as V=(10+30) μms−1 and the total crystallization time in the droplets of (2+5) μm size is τc=Rd/V=(0.07+0.5) s, where Rd is the droplet size. A more sophisticated theory of steady-state eutectic growth has been developed by Jackson and Hunt (1966) and then modified by several authors (Trivedi et al., 1987; Kurz and Trivedi, 1991, Karma, 1994). The estimations based on this theory are presented in “The steady-state eutectic growth velocity” section hereinafter. According to Jackson and Hunt's theory evaluations, the values of freezing rates, V=(30+60) μms−1, are slightly higher (and the total crystallization times are lower) than those obtained from the Turnbull's model (Turnbull, 1955). The rate of heterogeneous nucleation of gold crystals, presumably at the substrate/liquid interface, can be deduced on the basis of the classical kinetic theory (Kelton, 1991; Debenedetti, 1996): [in-line-formulae]Jss=J0exp(−W*/kT) (4),[/in-line-formulae] where W* is the height of the heterogeneous nucleation barrier, J0 is pre-exponential factor. As shown in the “Heterogeneous nucleation rate in the Au—Ge eutectics” section hereinafter, for the reasonable material parameters, the pre-exponential factor can be evaluated as J0≈(4÷6)·1020 s−1μm−3 and to the moment when the first stable nucleus appears, the heterogeneous nucleation rate in the droplet reaches the values J ss  ( t 1 ) = J 0  Δ   V d   - y 1 2 ≈ 2  y 1 3  α B ′ nuclei per second that gives for the cooling rate α=1° s−1 (used in the most of present experiments) about (0.8÷1.0) nuclei per second. The average time between two first nucleation events, Δ   t 12 ≈ B ′ α  ln   2 2  y 1 3 , being compared with the time of full crystallization of the droplet, τc, allows to formulate a criterion for appearance of a monocrystal porous structure described in the previous sections: χ = Δ   t 12 τ c = VB R d  α  ln   2 2   y 1 3 ≥ 1. ( 5 ) For typical values of parameters (Table 3): B′=700° C., y1=6.5, and χ = 0.88   V R d  α  ( °   C . / s ) For droplets with radii Rd≦10 μm and cooling rates ≦1° C.s−1, with V=(30÷50) μms−1, formation of Au—Ge eutectics with the monocrystal gold matrix seems to be highly probable On the other hand, for faster cooling, for example, with the rate α=35° C.s−1, formation of such structure is unlikely. In other words, for the cooling rates ˜1° C.s−1, the second nucleus appears after the first one, in average, after (0.7÷0.9) s, and this period is long enough that provides the full crystallization of the (2÷10) μm droplets before the second nucleation event. At the same time, for droplets with radii R≧20 μm and/or high cooling rates α≧10° C.s−1, several nuclei can appear during crystallization. The times of full crystallization process in the investigated micron size droplets were apparently substantially smaller than the average period between two subsequent events of nucleation of gold crystals front the eutectic melt, which can explain why the gold matrix of the eutectic structure was formed as a single crystal. Despite of the complicative shape of the eutectic structure, it can be understood as a structure formed by separate Ge crystals wrapped with the Au matrix. Low energy coherent interfaces between Au and Ge crystals correspond to {111} planes of both crystals. The Ge crystals nucleate on the {111} faces of Au octahedrons with special orientations relative to Au <11 2> directions The angles between these directions at different faces of truncated octahedron and the substrate (which is parallel to one of the {111} planes of the octahedron) are 48.2°, 70.5° and 80.4° (or, correspondingly, 99.6°, 109.5° and 131.8°). The different slopes of Ge channels to the substrate (in addition to the channels parallel to the substrate) (FIGS. 12-13) can be interpreted as projections of several favorite growth directions corresponding to the angles between different <112> directions of the gold monocrystal. Additional channels, with intermediate slopes, form during eutectic growth to maintain lamella spacing when the liquid/eutectics transformation surface increases. The single crystal Au matrix can be imagined as partly overlapped truncated octahedrons, whereas Ge crystals bridge the gaps between them and grow as separate channels from the bottom to the top of the droplet. Schematic crystallization front of such a structure is shown in FIG. 16. The regions of Ge have the shapes similar to those observed in our experiments (FIGS. 10-12). The Steady-State Eutectic Growth Velocity According to the Jackson and Hunt's theory (Jackson and Hunt, 1966; Trivedi et al., 1987; Kurz and Trivedi, 1991; Karma, 1994), the steady-state growth of lamellar or rod eutectic structure is described by the following relationship between velocity V, structure spacing λ and diffusion coefficient in liquid phase D: λ 2  V = Df  ( 1 - f )  a L C 0  P  ( f , p ) , where   a L = 2  [ Γ α  Sin   θ α fm α + Γ β  Sin   θ β ( 1 - f )  m β ] ,  C 0 = ρ α  ( C α - C α 0 ) - ρ β  ( C β 0 - C α ) ρ α  f + ( 1 - f )  ρ β , ( A1 ) C10 is the concentration in the solid phase l at the eutectic temperature, Γl=γ′sll/ΔS′f is the Gibbs-Thomson coefficients, γ′sll is the solid/liquid interface energies, ΔS′f is the entropy of fusion of the phase i, m, is the slope of liquidus (defined as positive) in the α−β phase diagram corresponding to the i phase (i=α or β), qa and qb are the contact angles at the three-phase junction (Trivedi et al., 1987), which can be found from the surface tension balance: { γ s / l α  Sin   θ α + γ s / l β  Sin   θ β = γ αβ γ s / l α  Cos   θ α = γ s / l β  Cos   θ β , ( A2 ) where γαβ is the surface energy of the isotropic α/β interface. The function P(f,p) is defined as (Trivedi et al., 1987): P  ( f , p ) = ∑ n = 1 ∞   1 ( π   n ) 3  [ sin  ( π   nf ) ] 2  p n 1 + 1 + p a 2 , ( A3 ) where pn=2πn/p, p=Vλ/2D is the Peclet number. For low velocities, p<<1, the case as usually assumed in the JH treatment, the function (A3) can be well approximated by the analytical expression (Kurz and Trivedi, 1991). [in-line-formulae]P≈0.3251[1−0.205 exp(−24fαfβ)](fαfβ)101.[/in-line-formulae] The physical constants (Turnbull, 1950, Dinsdale, 1991) and calculated parameters for the Au—Ge system are presented in the Table 2. As can be seen, for the eutectic structure spacing, λ=(70÷100) nm, the steady-state growth velocities are V=(30÷60) μms−1. TABLE 2 Physical constants and calculated parameters for the Au—Ge system Units Au/Ge Ge Au Te (K) 631 Tf (K) 1211.4 1337.33 Ce (X = XGe) (at. %) 28 D(Te) (μm2/s) 85 νmol (10−3m3/mol) 1.1 γαβ (J/m2) 0.174 γs11t (J/m2) 0.145 0.1 fi — 0.31 0.69 ρi (g/cm3) 5.3 19.3 ΔSfi (J/K · mol) 30.4975 9.3859 mi (K/at. %) 17 22 Ci0 (at. %) 100 0.097 θi (°) 54.8 33.4 αL (10−4 μm) 2.5 C0 (at. fraction) 0.616 P — 0.025 λ2V (μm3/s) 0.295 Heterogeneous Nucleation Rate in the Au—Ge Eutectics The steady state nucleation rate is deduced on the basis of the classical kinetic theory (Kelton, 1991, Debenedetti, 1996) by eq. (4), where J 0 = bD d Z  ( i ′ ) 2 / 3  N i  Z , ( B1 ) b=24 is a geometrical factor, N1=N0/vmol is the number density of molecules in the liquid, N0 is the Avogadro number, vmol is the molar volume in liquid, d=1/(N11/3√{square root over (3)}) is the inter-molecular distance in liquid, i* is the number of molecules in the critical fluctuation, and Z˜0.01 is the Zeldovich factor. Neglecting the temperature dependence of the Au diffusion coefficient in the liquid and assuming D=8·10−11 m2s−1 (as evaluated above) and using i*=ΔV*N1=30÷50, where ΔV* is the critical nucleus volume, vmol=1.1·10−5 m3mol−1, one can evaluate J0=(4.4÷6.2)·1038 nl−1s−1. The height of the heterogeneous nucleation barrier, W*, can be deduced from the CNT (Kelton, 1991; Debenedetti, 1996) or from the DIT (Gránásy, 1993) for different nucleus shapes. In the CNT the sharp interfaces with the constant interface energies are assumed. If the nucleus is considered as a solid droplet on the liquid/substrate surface with the contact angle θ, the heterogeneous nucleation barrier is the following (Kelton, 1991; Debenedetti, 1996): W het CNT = κ   S  ( θ )  ( γ Au / liq ) 3 Δ   g 0 , ( B2 ) where Δg0 is the volumetric free energy change due to the liquid to solid transformation. γAu/liq is the solid/liquid interface energy. S  ( θ ) = ( 2 - 3   cos   θ + cos 3  θ ) / 4 , κ = 16  π 3 . This barrier can be substantially lower than one for the homogeneous nucleation for θ<90°. The DIT relies on the assumptions that bulk properties exist at least at the center of critical fluctuations and that the distance between the surfaces of zero excess enthalpy and zero excess entropy is independent of cluster size (Gránásy, 1993). The height of the homogeneous nucleation barrier for a droplet nucleus in the DIT approach is written as [in-line-formulae]WhomDIT=κδ3Δg0φ(η) (B3).[/in-line-formulae] where δ is the characteristic interface thickness, φ=2(l+q)η−3−(3+2q)η−2+η−1, q=√{square root over (1−η)}, η=Δg0/Δh0. Δh0 is the volumetric enthalpy difference between the solid and liquid. For the heterogeneous nucleation the additional factor S(θ) should be added in (B3). The interface energy defined in the DIT as γeff=−δΔg0(φ/4)1/3 is temperature dependent through Δg0 and η. For equilibrium conditions, T = T r  :   W het DIT = κ   S  ( θ )  ( γ ∞ ) 3 ( Δ   g 0 ) 2 , where γ∞=−δΔh0. Baring in mind that the interface energies (Turnbull, 1950) have been determined for certain experimentally found undercooling temperatures, Tu, the parameter δ can be found as δ=γexpΔg0(Tu)[φ(Tu)/4]1/3. For gold Tu=1107K (Turnbull, 1950) that gives δAu≈0.13 nm and γ∞=0.145 Jm−2; for germanium Tu=1004K, δGe≈0.06 nm and γ∞=0.199 Jm−2. For eutectic temperature it gives γAu(631K)=0.1 Jm−2, γGe(631K)=0.145 Jm−2, the values used in the present calculations (Table 2) The values of Δg0 and η=Δg0/Δh0 for crystallization of gold from eutectic Au—Ge melt should be used in the expressions (B2) or (B3). The free energy change for the reaction L(Xeut)→L′(XL)+Au: Δ   G = X L - X eut X L  Δ   g f Au - T  [ S L conf  ( X eut ) - S L conf  ( X L ) ] + Δ   g E  ( X eut , X L ) , B4 ) where ΔgfAu is the free energy of fusion of Au, SLconf(Xeut) and SLconf(XL) are the configuration entropies in the liquid at eutectic and liquidus concentrations, ΔgE(Xeut, XL) is the excess free energy change in the liquid due to the transformation. The first term in (B4) is responsible for nucleation of a gold crystal, while the two others—for supersaturation of melt with Ge that then provides nucleation of a Ge crystal. Using the first term as the driving force for the initial liquid to solid Au transformation, one can write: Δ   g 0 = X L - X eut X L  Δ   g f Au  Δ   T m Au  X eut + Δ   T  Δ   g j Au ≡ ϕ  ( Δ   T )  Δ   g f Au , ( B5 ) The time tl required for heterogeneous nucleation of a first nucleus inside a droplet can be found by integration of the nucleation rate (4) with time: Δ   V d  ∫ 0 t 1  J 0  exp  ( - W * kT )    t = 1 , ( B6 ) where ΔVd is the droplet's volume appropriate for heterogeneous nucleation. For a droplet with a bottom radius r, the volume appropriated for heterogeneous nucleation ΔVd˜πr2h (h is the near-substrate layer thickness); if, for example, r=2 μm, h=1 nm: ΔVd≈0.013 μ3. Since the nucleation occurs in a narrow temperature interval (Gránásy, 1993), one can neglect by the change of diffusion coefficient during the ending and assume T=const in the exponent's denominator, while the undercooling ΔT has to be considered as the time dependent parameter: ΔT=Teut−T=αl, where α is the cooling rate. With these simplifications, integration results in the following expression: A _ - 1 = [ 1 y 1   - y 1 2 - π  erfc  ( y 1 ) ] ≡ ψ  ( y 1 )   where   y 1 = B α   t 1 , A _ = Δ   V d  J 0  B ′ / α ,  B ′ = [ κ   S  ( θ )  γ Au / liq 3 ] 1 / 2  m Au  X eut Δ   S l Au  ( T l - T eut )  kT ≅ Const , ( B7 ) Approximate expression for the function ψ(y1)≈e−yf/2y13 can be used for y1≧6. Numerical solution of eq. (B7) is illustrated in FIG. 17. As can be seen, the change of the product Ā for two orders of value results in variation of y1 for only ˜5.4%. Using the values of parameters for Au (Table 2), one can evaluate the value of B ′ ≈ 1580 · S 1 2  ( θ )  ( °   C . ) and the undercooling value as ΔT=αt1=B′/y1 Maximum experimental values of undercooling for nucleation in metal drops (up to 50 μm diameter) are ˜0.18 Tf (Turnbull, 1950) Using Teut=631K for Au—Ge system as a melting temperature one can evaluate ΔTm=114° C. The values y1=(6.2÷6.5) (see below) correspond to B′=(707÷740)° C. and S(θ)≈0.2(θ≈65°). For such values of B′ the first nucleus appears allot t1≈3.5 s for the cooling rate α=35° C.s−1 and t1≈3.5 min for α=35° C.min−1 The average period between the first and the second nucleation events can be evaluated from equation: ψ(y2)=2ψ(y1) The exact numerical solution gives y2=6.130 for y1=6.185 (Ā=2·1019) and y2=6.483 for y1=6.535 (Ā=2·1021) (FIG. 17) The approximate solution y1−y2≈In2/(2y1) gives approximately the same values with the error ˜0.02%. Then the period between two first nucleation events: t 2 - t 1 ≡ Δ   t 12 = B ′ α  ( y 1 - y 2 ) y 1  y 2 = B ′ α  ln   2 2   y 1 3 = ( 1.2 ÷ 1.5 ) · 10 - 3  ( B ′ α ) . ( B8 ) For determined values of B′ the period Δt12 is evaluated as Δt12=(2.4÷3.2)10−2 s for α=35° C.s−1 and Δt12=(1.4÷1.9)s for α=35° C.min−1. Several reasonable sets of calculated parameters are given in Table 3. TABLE 3 Different sets of the calculated parameters for the Au—Ge system J0 ΔVd B′ α A Rd V Δt12 τ = Rd/V 1020 μm−3s−1 μm3 ° C.
