Field of the Invention The present invention relates to polyglyceryl thickeners and compositions comprising polyglyceryl thickeners that are useful in a variety of applications including cleansing of the human body. Background of the Invention Any discussion of the prior art throughout the specification should in no way be considered as an admission that such prior art is widely known or forms part of common general knowledge in the field. Synthetic detergents, such as cationic, anionic, amphoteric, and non-ionic surfactants, are used widely in a variety of detergent and cleansing compositions to impart cleansing properties thereto. In addition, in certain compositions (e.g. personal care compositions such as shampoos, washes, etc.), it may be desirable to combine surfactants and ingredients such as thickeners to achieve relatively a desirable balance of properties such as mildness, foam volume, foam stability, and rheological behavior. A commonly used class of thickeners are amphiphilic molecules that have large hydrophilic head groups and are highly ethoxylated, often comprising greater than 100 moles of ethylene oxide (ΕΟ). Unfortunately, ethoxylation requires tremendous volumes of ΕΟ, a gaseous petrochemical derivative synthesized via air-oxidation of ethylene gas. In addition to being a difficult-to-handle chemical with significant health and safety risks, ΕΟ is considered by many to be unsustainable in the long term due to finite reserves of crude oil and natural gas in the world. Furthermore, a byproduct of ethoxylation processes is the cyclic ether 1,4-dioxane, a suspected carcinogen at high exposure levels. Ethoxylated materials typically contain trace levels (10-100 ppm) of 1,4-dioxane, and special separation processes (e.g. vacuum stripping) must be employed to reduce the level of 1,4-dioxane to undetectable levels. When present in cleansing compositions at trace levels, 1,4-dioxane is not considered to be a credible health or safety risk. Nevertheless, negative publicity associated with 1,4-dioxane has provided motivation to seek products that do not have ethoxylated materials. The inventors have recognized that it would be desirable to replace synthetic ethoxylated thickeners with more natural and renewable materials. However, natural thickeners such as vegetable gums typically have a stringy, pseudoplastic, and/or elastic rheology that is less aesthetically desirable. Accordingly, the inventors have recognized that it is highly desirable to formulate compositions that have more naturally-derived and/or renewable thickeners to alleviate the aforementioned drawbacks. The inventors have further recognized that thickeners that do not require ethoxylation are highly desirable, particularly thickeners that are capable of thickening a range of personal care product formulations in manner that is aesthetically acceptable to consumers. It is an object of the present invention to overcome or ameliorate at least one of the disadvantages of the prior art, or to provide a useful alternative. Unless the context clearly requires otherwise, throughout the description and the claims, the words “comprise”, “comprising”, and the like are to be construed in an inclusive sense as opposed to an exclusive or exhaustive sense; that is to say, in the sense of “including, but not limited to”. Although the invention will be described with reference to specific examples it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the invention may be embodied in many other forms.

As noted above, applicants have discovered unexpectedly that certain compounds or compositions can be used to thicken cosmetic and personal care bases. In particular, applicants have noted the unexpected properties associated with the use of certain embodiments of polyglyceryl compositions that have both an average degree of glyceryl polymerization greater than three and at least about 0.35 average hydrophobic moieties per primary linking group. The resulting compositions may be suitable for use as cleansing and/or rinse-off compositions. In certain embodiments, polyglyceryl compounds and compositions of the present invention may be described with reference to the following structure (Formula I): where, according to this embodiment: Ζ is a node structure; each G is an independently selected (poly)glyceryl group; each L is an independently selected primary linking group (linking a (poly)glyceryl group to the node structure); χ is the number of (poly)glyceryl groups per polyglyceryl molecule, which is from 1 to 12; each (Hphob) is an independently selected hydrophobic moiety; each L' is an independently selected primary linking group (linking a hydrophobic moiety to the node structure); h is the number of hydrophobic moieties that are linked to the node structure via a linking group L', which is from 0 to 11; each L" is an independently selected secondary linking group (linking a hydrophobic moiety to a glyceryl group); y is the number of hydrophobic moieties that are linked to a (poly)glyceryl group via a secondary linking group L", which is from 0 to 5; each (Nu) is an independently selected nucleophilic group; a is the number of nucleophilic groups, which is from 0 to 11; the sum of χ + h + a is from 4 to 12; and the sum of h + y is from 1 to 12. Accordingly, polyglyceryl materials of the present invention comprise compounds having a node structure (Ζ) to which (poly)glyceryl units are linked via a primary linking group (L). Suitable node structures include linear, branched, or cyclic, saturated or unsaturated polynucleophile remnants comprising from four to twelve carbon atoms, and optionally, one or more heteroatoms such as oxygen, nitrogen, or sulfur. As used herein the term “polynucleophile” means a compound having a plurality of nucleophilic functional groups or groups capable of being rendered nucleophilic, for example, hydroxyl (-ΟΗ), thio (-SH), amino (-NR2, where R is Η or CH3), carboxy (-COO') groups, and the like. Examples of polynucleophiles include: polyols such as monosaccharides, e.g. glucose, fructose, galactose, mannose, glucosamine; C1-C4 glucosides, disaccharides (e.g. sucrose), sugar alcohols (e.g. sorbitol, xylitol, mannitol), anhydro sugar alcohols (e.g. sorbitan), pentaerythritol, oligoglycerols (e.g. diglycerol, triglycerol), N,N,N',N'-tetrakis(2-hydroxyethyl)ethylenediamine, Ν,Ν,Ν ',N '-tetrakis(2-hydroxypropyl)ethylenediamine, and the like. The term “polynucleophile remnant” as used herein refers to the structure of a polynucleophile compound with all of the terminal nucleophilic groups (e.g. hydroxyl groups) removed. For example, a polynucleophilic remnant derived from methyl glucoside would be the structure of methyl glucoside with the four hydroxyl groups removed therefrom as shown below: which results in a node structure which is a 5-carbon cyclic ether having a methylene at the 5-position and a methyl ether at the 1-position. Other examples include polynucleophilic remnants derived from sorbitan (wherein removal of the four hydroxyl groups results in a node structure that is a 4-carbon cyclic ether with an ethyl group at the 2-position): and triglycerol (wherein removal of the five hydroxyl groups results in a 1,3,dipropoxypropane node structure): and the like. According to certain preferred embodiments, the node structure has from about 6 to about 9 carbons, in certain more preferred embodiments from about 6 to about 7 carbons. According to certain preferred embodiments, the node structure is a polynucleophile remnant derived from a polynucleophile selected from the group consisting of polyols such as monosaccharides, e.g. glucose, fructose, galactose, mannose, glucosamine; C1-C4 glucosides, disaccharides (e.g. sucrose), sugar alcohols (e.g. sorbitol, xylitol, mannitol), anhydro sugar alcohols (e.g. sorbitan), pentaerythritol, oligoglycerols (e.g. diglycerol, triglycerol), N,N,N',N'-tetrakis(2-hydroxyethyl)ethylenediamine, and N,N,N',N'-tetrakis(2-hydroxypropyl)ethylenediamine. In certain more preferred embodiments, the node structure is a polynucleophile remnant derived from methyl glucoside, sorbitan, diglycerol, or triglycerol, or in other more preferred embodiments, from methyl glucoside, diglycerol, or triglycerol. The polyglyceryl materials of the present invention comprise one or more (poly)glyceryl groups (G). As used herein a “(poly)glyceryl group” means a group linked to the node through a primary linking group (L) comprising one glyceryl unit, a plurality of glyceryl units linked together in sequence, and/or one or more glyceryl units linked with co-repeat units as part of a glyceryl copolymer group. The term “glyceryl unit” means a linear, branched, and/or cyclic ether-comprising moiety that is a structural derivative of glycerol (C3H8O3), such as units corresponding to dehydrated glycerol (C3H6O2). Those skilled in the art will recognize, the glyceryl units may be present as single units in a particular glyceryl group or may repeat such that a plurality of such units are present in a given (poly)glyceryl group. Examples of certain glyceryl units are represented as linear-1,4 (Li^) units: linear-1,3 (L13) glyceryl units, dendritic (D) glyceryl repeat units, which lead to branched and cyclic units, terminal-1,2 (Τΐ,2) units and terminal-1,3 (Τ13) units In one embodiment, the polyglyceryl thickener comprises glyceryl groups that are glyceryl copolymer groups. By “glyceryl copolymer group” it is meant that in addition to glyceryl units described above, the glyceryl group includes one or more repeat units such as oxypropylene units: where R = C1-C4 linear or branched alkyl, such as -CH2CH2-, -CH(CH3)CH2-, and CH2CH2CH2-, that originate from reacting optional co-monomers (such as ethylene carbonate, 1,2-propylene carbonate, and 1,3-propylene carbonate) in the formation of the polyglyceryl thickeners. Furthermore, one or more of the glyceryl groups may include C2 - C4 acyl glyceryl units such as acetyl glyceryl units: and and C| - C4 alkyl glyceryl units, such as methyl glyceryl ether units: and According to certain preferred embodiments, the polyglyceryl compositions of the present invention have an average degree of glyceryl polymerization (DPg) greater than 3. Those skilled in the art will recognize that “average degree of glyceryl polymerization” means the number of glyceryl units per mole of polyglyceryl thickener on a number average basis. In certain preferred embodiments, the average degree of glyceryl polymerization is from about 4 to about 100 glyceryl repeat units, preferably from about 4 to about 50 glyceryl repeat units, more preferably from about 4 to about 25 glyceryl repeat units, even more preferably from about 4 to about 15 glyceryl repeat units. In certain other preferred embodiments, the average degree of glyceryl polymerization is greater than 3 to about 11. The DPg of a polyglyceryl composition is calculated in accord with the present invention using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques in accord with the Average Degree of Glyceryl Polymerization Measurement Procedure described herein below. As discussed above, each of the one or more of the (poly)glyceryl groups are linked to the node structure by a primary linking group (L). By “linked to the node structure by a primary linking group,” it is meant that the (poly)glyceryl group is directly linked to the node structure with only a primary linking (functional) group therebetween. The primary linking group may be, for example, the functional moieties that when linked to at least two carbon atoms form ethers, esters, carbamates (urethanes), amines, amides, ketones, carbonates, thioethers, thioesters, dithioesters, xanthates. That is, as will be understood by one of skill in the art, each primary linking group may be selected from: -0-, -C(0)0-, -N(H)C(0)0-, -N(R)2-, -N(R)C(0) -, C(O) -, -0℮(0)0-, -S-, -C(S)0-, -C(S)S-, -OC(S)S-, where each R is independently Η or methyl. According to certain preferred embodiments, the primary linking group is -0-, amine, or carbamate. In certain embodiments, the primary linking group is derived from the nucleophilic groups of the polynucleophile that was used in the process of making the polyglyceryl thickener. For example, if a polynucleophile bearing hydroxyl groups is reacted with glycerol carbonate then the resulting node structure will be substituted with (P°ly)glyceryl groups covalently linked to the node by primary linking groups that are ether bonds (i.e. the linking group is -0-). As one skilled in the art would readily understand, in embodiments in which the number of glyceryl units is larger than the number of (poly)glyceryl groups, certain glyceryl units present in the polyglyceryl thickener, rather than bonded to the node structure, are, for example, bonded to neighboring glyceryl units. The polyglyceryl materials further include one or more terminal hydrophobic moieties (Hphob). By “hydrophobic moieties,” is it meant nonpolar moieties that contains at least one of the following: (a) a carbon-carbon chain of at least six carbons in which none of the six carbons is a carbonyl carbon or has a hydrophilic moiety bonded directly to it; (b) three or more alkyl siloxy groups (-[Si(R)2-0]-); and/or (c) three or more oxypropylene groups in sequence. A hydrophobic moiety may be, or include, linear, cyclic, aromatic, saturated or unsaturated groups. Preferred hydrophobic moieties include 9 or more carbon atoms, more preferably from 11 to 30 carbon atoms, even more preferably from 15 to 26 carbon atoms, and most preferably from 17 to 24 carbon atoms. Other examples of hydrophobic moieties include groups such as poly(oxypropylene), poly(oxybutylene), poly(dimethylsiloxane), and fluorinated hydrocarbon groups containing a carbon chain of at least six carbons in which none of the six carbons has a hydrophilic moiety bonded directly to it, and the like. Some specific examples of hydrophobic moieties include linear or branched, saturated or unsaturated alkyl moieties, e.g. linear or branched, saturated or unsaturated C10-C30 alkyl, such as decyl, undecyl, dodecyl (lauryl), tridecyl, tetradecyl (myristyl), pentadecyl, hexadecyl (cetyl, palmityl), heptadecyl, heptadecenyl, hepta-8-decenyl, hepta-8,11-decenyl, octadecyl (stearyl), nonadecyl, eicosanyl, henicosen-12-yl, henicosanyl, docosanyl (behenyl), and the like. Certain preferred hydrophobic moieties include heptadecyl, heptadecenyl, hepta-8-decenyl, hepta-8,11-decenyl and the like. Each terminal hydrophobic moiety of a polyglyceryl material of the present invention may be bound either to the node structure by a primary linking functional group (L') or to a (poly)glyceryl group by a secondary linking group (L"). Any suitable and preferred moiety as described above for primary linking group (L) may also be suitable and/or preferred as a primary linking group (L1) or secondary linking group (L"). In certain embodiments, the primary linking group is derived from the nucleophilic groups of the polynucleophile that were consumed in the process of bonding the hydrophobic moiety to the polynucleophile. For example, if a polynucleophile bearing hydroxyl groups (i.e. a polyol) is reacted with fatty acids under condensation reaction conditions, then the resulting node structure will be substituted with hydrophobic moieties covalently linked to the node structure by primary linking groups that are ester functional groups (-C(O) -). Alternatively, the primary linking functional group may be derived from a difunctional reagent used to covalently bind the hydrophobic moiety to the polynucleophilic node. For example, if a polynucleophile bearing hydroxyl groups (i.e. a polyol) is reacted with a diisocyanate, followed by reaction with a fatty alcohol, then the resulting node structure will be substituted with hydrophobic moieties covalently linked to the node structure by primary linking groups that are carbamate (urethane) functional groups. Preferably, polyglyceryl materials of the present invention are sufficiently substituted with hydrophobic moieties such that the polyglyceryl compositions have an average number of hydrophobic moieties per primary linking group of about 0.35 or greater. By average hydrophobic moieties per primary linking group, it is meant the quotient of the average number of hydrophobic moieties divided by (the sum of average number of primary linking groups (L) and (L1)) present in the polyglyceryl composition. In certain embodiments, the polyglyceryl composition has from about 0.35 average hydrophobic moieties per primary linking group, to about 0.55 average hydrophobic moieties per primary linking group. Those of skill in the art will recognize that certain polynucleophiles and/or starting materials of the formula Node- (L' - Hphob)h may be commercially available as a mixture of mono-, di-, and/or tri-hydrophobicallysubstituted species. Thus the average number of hydrophobic moieties per linking group may be represented by a non-integer average value. For the purposes of clarity, the following example calculation is provided: for example, for a nominal sorbitan dioleate ester comprising 75 mol% disubstituted sorbitan and 25 mol% monosubstituted sorbitan, the average degree hydrophobic substitution (i.e. average degree of esterification) would be equal to 2(0.75) + 1(0.25) = 1.75 hydrophobic moieties per molecule. Since the sorbitan node bears four possible primary linking groups, the average number of hydrophobic moieties per primary linking group is equal to 1.75/4 = 0.44. In certain embodiments, on average, the polyglyceryl material is sufficiently substituted with hydrophobic moieties such that the polyglyceryl material has about 1.5 or more hydrophobic moieties per molecule, preferably from about 1.5 to about 2.2 hydrophobic moieties per molecule. For example, in the example calculation above the polyglyceryl sorbitan dioleate would have 1.75 hydrophobic moieties per molecule. While a variety of structures have been described for polyglyceryl thickeners of the present invention have been described, examples of particularly suitable polyglyceryl thickeners include those comprising compounds of the formulae: wherein R1-R4 are each independently either -L’-Hphob or -L-(G), provided that the thickener has on average about 1.5 or more -L’-Hphob per molecule. Such compounds are preferably derived from methyl glucose. wherein R1-R4 are each independently either -L’-Hphob or -L-(G), provided that the thickener has on average about 1.5 or more -L’-Hphob per molecule. Such compounds are preferably derived from sorbitan. wherein R1-R5 are each independently either -L’-Hphob or -L-(G), provided that the thickener has on average about 1.5 or more -L’-Hphob per molecule.

Methods of making polyglycervl thickeners Various synthetic routes are suitable for making polyglyceryl thickeners of the present invention. In one embodiment, the polyglyceryl thickener is prepared via the base-catalyzed ring-opening addition polymerization of the monomers and optional comonomers. The (co)polymerization may be performed, for example, by first providing a polymerization initiator, e.g., a polynucleophile that has been partially substituted with hydrophobic moieties. The polymerization initiator may be represented by the following structure: where: Ζ = node structure; Each Nu is a nucleophilic group (preferably a hydroxyl group); Hphob = hydrophobic moiety; Each L' is a primary linking group; h = hydrophobic moieties per nucleophilic group (hydrophobic substitution) b is the number of nucleophilic groups free for bonding with (poly)glyceryl groups. Examples of suitable polymerization initiators include: (i) glucoside diesters shown below, wherein R’ is a C1-C4 alkyl: such as methyl glucose dioleate, in which R= C17 (-RCO = oleoyl) and R’ = CH3. (ii) sorbitan diesters: such as sorbitan dioleate, in which R= C17 (-RCO = oleoyl) ; such as diglycerol dioleate, in which R= C17 (-RCO = oleoyl); and such as triglycerol dioleate, in which R= C17 (-RCO = oleoyl). In certain embodiments, the polymerization initiator is a compound of the above formula wherein Ζ is not a polynucleophile remnant derived from sorbitan. In certain preferred embodiments, the polymerization initiator may be selected from the group consisting of glucoside diesters, diglyceryl diesters, triglyceryl diesters, and combinations of two or more thereof. To prepare polyglyceryl thickeners of the present invention, various synthetic routes may be employed, including but not limited to condensation polymerization of glyceryl monomers such as glycerol; ring-opening polymerization of such glyceryl monomers as glycerol carbonate or glycidol. Glyceryl monomers suitable for ring-opening polymerization include primary monomers, (to yield glycerol repeat units) such as glyceryl carbonate (GC), glycidol, as well as substituted monomers such as glycerol carbonate C1-C4 monoester (preferred is acetyl glycerol carbonate (AcGC))and glycidol C1-C4 monoester. Furthermore, optional comonomers such as ethylene carbonate, 1,2-propylene carbonate, and 1,3-propylene carbonate may be used to yield a copolyether. Furthermore, glyceryl copolymers may also be derived via the ring-opening polymerization of glycerol carbonate with other cyclic carbonate monomers, such as acetylated glycerol carbonate (AcGC) to produce acetyl glyceryl units. Typically, the molar ratio of initiator to monomer used in the synthesis is generally at least 1:3, more usually from 1:4 to 1:100, typically 1:4 to 1:75, though more usually from 1:4 to 1:50, desirably 1:4 to 1:40 and particularly from 1:5 to 1:30. Although the synthetic reaction appears robust enough to make products with average DPg greater than about 30, reaction rates may fall off somewhat at higher DPg values, which may be compensated for by top up (or continuous) addition of glycerol carbonate and/or catalyst. To accelerate the reaction, in certain embodiments it is desirable to use a catalyst, particularly a base catalyst. Accordingly, in one embodiment, the method of making the polyglyceryl thickener includes reacting the initiator with glyceryl monomers and optional comonomers in the presence of a base catalyst. Suitable catalysts include alkali metal, particularly sodium or potassium, bases, e.g. hydroxides, particularly NaOFl or ΚΟΗ, carbonates, particularly K2CO3 or Na2C03, bicarbonates, particularly KPlCCh or NaHC03, and alkoxides, particularly sodium or potassium lower, particularly Ci to C4, alkoxides, e.g. sodium or potassium methoxide, and tertiary amines, particularly tertiary amines including at least one tertiary nitrogen atom in a ring system, such as l,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU), 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO), 4-(dimethylamino)pyridine (DMAP), 7-methyl-l,5,7-triazabicyclo[4.4.0]dec-5-ene (MTBD), quinuclidine, pyrrocoline, and similar materials. Base catalyst, particularly alkali metal hydroxide may be partially neutralized (or buffered) with acid, particularly fatty acids or a polybasic acid, such as phosphorus oxyacid, e.g. phosphoric acid, or reducing phosphorus oxyacids, such as phosphorous acid. The amount of catalyst may be from 0.5 to 25, more usually 2 to 20, and particularly 5 to 15, mol %, based on the initiator starting material. Calcium methoxide, Ca(OCH3)2, and potassium methoxide, KOCH3, if used, are desirably used in an amount of from 3 to 18, especially from 5 to 15 mol % based on the initiator starting material, are particularly useful catalysts. To make the compounds of the invention where the (poly)glyceryl group is a glyceryl copolymer, the synthesis may include ring-opening copolymerization with other cyclic monomers, preferably cyclic carbonates, e.g. those derived from ethylene glycol, propylene glycol and/or 1,3-propanediol, in addition to glycerol carbonate. The proportion of such other comonomer used will be chosen to provide the corresponding level of copolymeric inclusion in the chains and accordingly will typically be less than 75, more usually less than 50 and generally less than 25 mol % of the total carbonate used in the synthesis. The invention further includes a method of making a mixed poly(alkyleneoxy)/polyglycerol ether in which the initiator is reacted with glycerol carbonate and at least one other cyclic carbonate, particularly in the presence of a base catalyst. The relative proportions of glyceryl and other units in the glyceryl copolymer can readily be determined by controlling how the monomers are supplied to the reaction. Thus, random (statistical) copolymers can be made by supplying a mixture of monomers to the reaction; block copolymers by substantially completing reaction with one monomer before another is added; taper block copolymers by adding the another monomer later than but before complete reaction of a first carbonate reagent. Sequential block, block random, and similar types of copolymeric chains can be made by combinations or ready variations on the above reaction sequences. In one preferred embodiment, acetylated glyceryl carbonate is polymerized first off of the initiator, followed by subsequent polymerization of glyceryl carbonate. In addition to the compounds of the invention, typical synthesis reactions may generate by-products such as polyglycerol and/or polyglyceryl copolymers in side reactions initiated by species other than the intended initiator, e.g. polymerization of glycerol carbonate initiated by the free OH group of glycerol carbonate. Generally, the more monomer present in the reaction system the more likely such side polymerizations are to occur and consequently, aliquot or gradual addition of monomers over the course of the reaction reduces the amount of side product made. The polyglyceryl thickener may be separated from the side polymerization products via any of a variety of conventional separation processes including, for example, decanting, fractionation, centrifugation, and/or solvent extraction. The synthesis reactions will be generally be carried out in a batch mode, typically by mixing the reagents in a suitable vessel and allowing them to react, usually under stirring for a suitable time. Fresh reagent, particularly glycerol carbonate, and/or catalyst may be added occasionally, at multiple intervals or continuously during the reaction (semi-batch operation). It is also possible to use continuous or semicontinuous reaction modes if desired. Where the initiator and monomer(s) are immiscible, at the start of the reaction, the reactants form a two-phase liquid system. As the polyether (e.g., glyceryl and optional other units) chain of the etherified initiator grows, the polyethers become increasingly miscible with the monomer(s). Thus, the products and to an extent the intermediates will tend to act to compatibilize the starting materials, but when the transition to a single phase system occurs will depend on the reagents used. Reaction between components (generally) in different phases will be slower than when they are in one phase. The degree of compatibility of the intermediates may influence the relative speed of reaction as against chain length and thus influence the distribution of chain lengths in the final product. In some cases, a single phase liquid system will not form, giving rise to two different reaction products (one from each phase) that may be separated and utilized accordingly. In these cases, the reaction parameters may be adjusted accordingly to favor the formation of the desired product and minimize formation of the accompanying by product. For example, in a two-phase reaction product resulting from the reaction of methyl glucose dioleate with glycerol carbonate, one phase may comprise polyglyceryl methyl glucose dioleate with a high DPg, whereas the second phase may comprise a polyglyceryl methyl glucose dioleate with a low DPg. The two phases may be separated and collected via any of a variety of conventional separation processes including, for example, decanting, fractionation, centrifugation, and/or solvent extraction. Typically, the reactions to make the compounds of the invention can be carried out without the need for a solvent or diluent, particularly as this will avoid any problem in isolating the desired product. However, if desired, the physical immiscibility of the starting materials may be avoided by the use of suitable inert reaction medium, solvent or diluent; however, the reaction is preferably conducted in the bulk. Suitable solvents are liquids which remain thermally stable and are inert to the reagents and products. Any solvent used will either have a relatively low vapor pressure at the reaction temperature or the reaction will be conducted under suitable containment or reflux arrangements. Suitable examples of solvents/diluents include dimethyl isosorbide, dimethylformamide, dimethylsulfoxide, and ethylene glycol and diethylene glycol diethers, e.g. dimethyl, diethyl, or dibutyl ethers. Solvent and/or diluent may be included with the resulting polyglyceryl thickener, either by leaving reaction solvent/diluent in the product or by subsequent addition, to reduce product viscosity for transport, storage and/or subsequent use. Suitable solvents/diluents for this purpose include those mentioned above as well as glycerol carbonate (when its reactivity does not interfere with downstream product use), glycerol or, and particularly, monopropylene glycol because this may give the additional benefit of improving the molecular packing of the polyglycerol ether products at the phase interface in end use formulations. Typically such solvents/diluents will be used in amounts to give formulations having from 50 to 90, more usually 60 to 80 and particularly about 70, % by weight of the product. The reaction temperature may be superambient, such as at least 100 °C and more usually at least 150 °C and can range up to 220 °C, with the range 170 to 200 °C being generally suitable. Typically, the reagents used to make the compounds of the invention remain liquids of low vapor pressure at reaction temperatures, so the reaction can be conveniently carried out at ambient pressure though moderately superambient pressure may be used if desired. It is unlikely that it will be desirable to use subambient pressure, but by choosing suitable involatile reagents it may be possible to carry the reaction out at moderately subambient pressure. It is preferential to apply subambient pressure (i.e. vacuum) to the initiator during initial heating to degas and dry the initiator, as entrained oxygen will lead to discoloration of the product, and entrained water will lead to spontaneous initiation of the monomers, resulting in (co)polymers without the Node(Hphob)h functionality. It is also preferential to apply subambient pressure to the monomers prior to the reaction for degassing purposes. To help avoid excessive color generation, particularly when reacting initiators bearing unsaturated hydrophobic moieties, the synthesis reactions will usually be carried out in a largely oxygen free atmosphere, e.g. in a nitrogen atmosphere (e.g., using a nitrogen blanket or sparge. For larger scale production, nitrogen blanketing may be less necessary and perhaps omitted. It may be desirable to include reducing agent in the reaction to aid in control of product color. Reducing agents commonly used for this purpose, particularly in the manufacture of food or personal care products, can be used in this invention and examples include phosphorous acid (Η3ΡΟ3), hypophosphorous acid (Η3ΡΟ2) and borohydride (usually as sodium borohydride). Where the reducing agent is itself an acid, e.g. phosphorous or hypophosphorous acid, it will usually be present as a salt, typically an alkali metal salt. The salt may be made in situ by reaction with base, e.g. part of the basic catalyst (where used) and in this case care may be needed to ensure that sufficient base is present to neutralize the reducing acid and to act as catalyst. When used, the amount of reducing agent will typically be from 0.1 to 15 mol %, more usually 1 to 10 mol %, and particularly 2 to 7.5 mole %, based on the initiator. Another way of reducing product color is to include particulate carbon, particularly so-called "activated carbon", or a bleaching earth, e.g. diatomaceous earth, in the reaction to absorb colored side products. When used, the amount of carbon will typically be from 0.5 to 2.5 weight % of the total reagents. Of course, this carbon or bleaching earth will generally be removed e.g. by filtration, before the products are included in end use formulations. Activated carbon and a reducing agent may be used together in the reaction if desired. Further color improvement can be achieved by treatment of the reaction product with particulate carbon, particularly activated carbon, or bleaching earth, typically at from 0.5 to 2.5 weight % of the product, or by bleaching the product of the reaction, e.g. with a peroxide based bleach, generally after removal of any activated carbon or bleaching earth. According to certain embodiments of the invention, polyglyceryl thickener is used in a personal care composition. The personal care composition may comprise, consists of, or consist essentially of a base and the polyglyceryl thickener. The base comprises water, surfactant, and optionally, any of various ingredients typically used in personal care products. Any amounts of polyglyceryl thickeners suitable to increase viscosity of compositions of the present invention may be used according to the present methods. For example, polyglyceryl thickener may be included in an amount in the personal care composition sufficient to increase the Zero Shear Viscosity of the base by about 100 cP or more (when tested according to the Zero Shear Viscosity Test, described below). In certain preferred embodiments, the compositions of the present invention comprise an amount of polyglyceryl thickener sufficient to increase the Zero Shear Viscosity of the base by about 200 cP or more, more preferably by about 300 cP or more, more preferably by about 500 cP or more, more preferably by about 1000 cP or more. The increases in viscosity specified above are as when compared with a composition which has water substituted for the polyglyceryl thickener. According to certain embodiments, the polyglyceryl thickener is used in a concentration from greater than about 0.1% to about 15% by weight in the composition. Preferably, the polyglyceryl thickener is in a concentration from about 0. lto about 10%, more preferably from about 0.1% to about 5%, even more preferably from about 0.2% to about 4%, even more preferably from about 0.5% to about 4%, and most preferably from about 1% to about 4% in the composition. Compositions useful in the present invention may also include any of a variety of surfactants.

EXAMPLES - The following Test Methods and Procedures were used: Average Degree of Glyceryl Polymerization Measurement Procedure The average degree of glyceryl polymerization DPg for a subject polyglyceryl thickener was obtained using NMR techniques as follows: 'll NMR spectra were obtained in deuterated dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO-D6) or a mixture of DMSO-D6 and deuterated chloroform (CDCI3) at concentrations between 30-40 mg/mL using a Jeol spectrometer operating at 500 MHz (Jeol Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) for: (a) the hydrophobically-substituted polynucleophile (polymerization initiator) from which the polyglyceryl thickener is derived, i.e. (Nu)b-Node - (L1 - Hphob)h as described above; (b) polyglycerin-10 (Natrulon H-10 available from Lonza Group); and (c) the subject polyglyceryl thickener for which DPg is to be determined. Based on the reference spectra (a) and (b), the peaks associated with the five characteristic carbon-bonded (i.e. methylene/methine) protons of glyceryl units and the peaks associated with a selected number of characteristic protons of the Node- ( L' - Hphob)h moiety are assigned. The area under the curve for peaks associated with the five glyceryl unit protons in spectrum (c) is calculated (minus any contribution from overlapping protons of Node- (L' Hphob)h) and divided by five to normalize for the corresponding number of protons per mole of glyceryl unit. The area under the curve for peaks associated with the selected characteristic protons of the Node- ( L' - Hphob)h in spectrum (c) is calculated and divided by the total number of characteristic protons to normalize for the number of such protons per mole of Node- (L' - Hphob)h. The DPg of the polyglyceryl thickener is then calculated as: [normalized area of polyglyceryl units]/[normalized area of Node(L' - Hphob)h]. The DPgs thus calculated are generally accurate to within ±5-10% For the purpose of clarity the following example calculation is provided for a polyglyceryl thickener comprising polyglyceryl methyl glucose dioleate (El A). ‘H NMR spectra were obtained as above for methyl glucose dioleate, polyglycerin-10 (Natrulon H-10 available from Lonza Group), and the polyglyceryl methyl glucose dioleate polyglyceryl thickener (El A). Based on the reference spectra for methyl glucose dioleate and polyglycerin-10, the proton peaks between 3-4 ppm in the spectra for the polyglyceryl thickener were assigned to five protons of the polyglyceryl repeat units and five overlapping protons from the methyl glucose dioleate, and the proton peaks between 1-1.3 ppm were assigned to 40 characteristic protons on the methyl glucose dioleate hydrophobic groups (See, for example, Figs. 3 and 4). The areas under the curve for the peaks were calculated and the DPg calculated using the following equation: Area3_4ppm 5 xAre3i-i.3ppm 40 DP0 = Areai.^ppm 40 Hydrophilicity Index Test: The following Hydrophilicity Index Test was performed on various polyglyceryl thickeners using an Antaris FT-NIR Analyzer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, ΜΑ) equipped with transmission, fiber-optic and integrating sphere diffuse reflection modules. Real-time, on-line fiber optic measurements were conducted using small diameter (1/8”) transmission probe (Axiom Analytical, Inc, Tustin, CA) immersed in the glassware reactor. Off-line measurements were conducted using integrated sphere module and the data analyzed using TQ Analyst software program provided by Thermo Fisher Scientific. The spectra from both, on-line and off-line measurements, were obtained using 64 scans with 4 cm'1 resolution. The Hydrophilicity Index (HI) test of the polyglyceryl thickener was conducted on series of NIR spectra obtained from off-line, room temperature measurements using the integrated sphere module. HI is a measure the relative proportions of hydrophilic (glyceryl units) vs. hydrophobic (hydrocarbon) character of the polyglyceryl thickeners produced. Using TQ Analyst software, the area under the -OH absorption band of glyceryl units (from 6,100cm''to 7500cm'1) was integrated and compared with the area integrated under the hydrophobic, hydrocarbon spectral area (5320cm'1 to 6050cm'1). The calculated ratio between hydrophilic and hydrophobic area is HI , and can be used to compare the hydrophilicity between the different samples. HI ratio is independent of the sample size/thickness and test temperature. Lower values of hydrophilicity index indicate less polyglycerol units have been incorporated. Similarly, a higher hydrophilicity index will indicate that more polyglycerol has been incorporated into the polyglyceryl thickener. In certain preferred embodiments HI is about 0.3 or greater. More preferred is HI of about 0.4 or greater. In certain embodiments, preferred HI is from about 0.4 to about 0.9, and more preferred is HI from about 0.5 to about 0.8. Zero Shear Viscosity Test: The following Zero Shear Viscosity Test was performed on various personal care compositions to determine the viscosity according to the present invention. Viscosities of test formulations were conducted at 25°C using a controlled-stress rheometer (AR-2000, ΤΑ Instruments Ltd., New Castle, DE, USA). Steady-state shear stress sweeps were performed at 25.0 ±0.1 °C using a double-wall Couette geometry. Data acquisition and analysis were performed with the Rheology Advantage software ν4.1.10 (ΤΑ Instruments Ltd., New Castle, DE, USA). Zero-shear apparent viscosities for samples that demonstrated Newtonian behavior are reported as the average of viscosity values obtained over a range of shear stresses (0.005 - 100 Pa). For pseudoplastic (shear-thinning) fluids, zero-shear apparent viscosities (ηο) were calculated via the fitting of shear stress sweep data to an Ellis viscosity model. Formulation Foam Test: The following Formulation Foam Test is performed on various cleansing compositions to determine the foam volume upon agitation according to the present invention. First, a solution of the test composition is prepared in simulated tap water. To represent the hardness of tap water, 0.36 g of calcium chloride is dissolved in 995 g of DI water. Five (5.0) grams of test composition is then added to this solution and mixed until homogeneous. To determine the Formulation Foam Volume, the test composition (1000 mL) was added to the sample tank of a SITA R-2000 foam tester (commercially available from Future Digital Scientific, Co.; Bethpage, Ν.Υ.). The test parameters were set to repeat three runs (series count = 3) of 250 ml sample size (fill volume = 250 ml) with thirteen stir cycles (stir count = 13) for a 15 second stir time per cycle (stir time = 15 seconds) with the rotor spinning at 1200 RPM (revolution = 1200) at a temperature setting of 30° C ± 2° C. Foam volume data was collected at the end of each stir cycle and the average and standard deviation of the three runs was determined. The Maximum Foam Volume is reported as the value after the thirteenth stir cycle. Example 1: Preparation of polvglvceryl thickeners (Ε1 -El 7) Polyglyceryl thickener composition El was prepared as follows: to an appropriately-sized vessel fitted with Ν2 sparge, reflux condenser, graduated addition funnel, and NIR reaction probe, 0.058 moles of methyl glucose dioleate (MGD), 0.050 moles of glyceryl carbonate and 0.0058 moles of Ca(OCFl3)2 were added. The mixture was heated to about 80°C and placed under vacuum to degas the mixture. The vacuum was broken and the mixture then heated slowly to 190 °C under Ν2 sparge with appropriate agitation. After equilibrating at 190 °C for 30 min, GC (degassed, 1.15 moles) was slowly added to the reactor over 2.5 hr. After completion of the addition, the reaction mixture was stirred at 190 °C until all of the glycerol carbonate was consumed. All degassing steps (moisture level measurements), reaction progress and GC consumption were monitored in situ via real-time NIR analysis. After the reaction was complete the material was cooled and discharged to an appropriate container. Additional polyglyceryl thickeners, Ε2-Ε17 were synthesized by varying the type or proportions of starting materials: polymerization initiator, glyceryl monomer, and/or base catalyst. The variation in starting materials used, reaction conditions, and products are summarized in the Table 1 below. For Ε9-Ε11, and El 3 AGC, synthesized in accord with the procedure below,and GC were added sequentially to the reaction mixture, whereas for El4, AGC and GC were added simultaneously. Additionally, the time of addition, total reaction time and temperature of the various reactions, as well as the resulting phases are shown in Table 2 below. The following abbreviations are used therein: MGD = methyl glucose dioleate, SO = sorbitan oleate, SSO = sorbitan sesquioleate, GC= glyceryl carbonate, AGC/GC = combination of acetylated glyceryl carbonate and glyceryl carbonate, SDO = sorbitan dioleate. Preparation of acetyl glyceryl carbonate (AGC): the following is a general labscale procedure for the preparation of AGC: to a clean, dry 250 mL two-neck flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer, near IR probe, and a condenser, was added glycerol carbonate (82.6 g, 0.70 mol), acetic anhydride (70.0 g, 0.68 mol), and two drops of pyridine. In the first stage of the reaction, the contents were heated under reflux for six hours at 100 °C. Conversion of glyceryl carbonate to AcGC was monitored via FT-N1R by following disappearance of the characteristic -OH (hydroxyl) absorption band for glyceryl carbonate at 7000 cm'1. In the second stage of the reaction, the acetic acid byproduct was removed via distillation at 45 °C under reduced pressure (ultimate vacuum = 3.5 Torr).

It was observed that the top phase was less viscous and lighter in color than the bottom phase. Example 2: Properties of Polvelvcervl Thickeners Examples El-El 7 were characterized for Average Degree of Glyceryl Polymerization and Hydrophilicity Index in accord with the respective Procedure and Test above. For those reaction products that included two phases, the phases were separated from one another by decanting off the top layer. The top phase/layer was identified as “A” and the bottom phase was identified as “B.” For example, the top phase of Inventive Example, El is identified as Inventive Example El A, whereas the bottom phase of Inventive Example El is identified as Example Ε1Β. Average Degree of Glyceryl Polymerization and Hydrophilicity Index for the resulting compositions are reported in Table 3 below.

As expected, and apparent from the data, DPg correlates well with hydrophilicity index. Also notable is the effect of degree of hydrophobic substitution. Inventive Examples El-El 4 used methyl glucose dioleate, which nominally has an average degree of substitution of hydrophobic moieties of 2.0, and therefore the nominal average number of hydrophobic groups per primary linking group in these particular polyglyceryl thickeners is 2.0/4 = 0.5. Inventive Example El 5 uses sorbitan oleate, which nominally has an average degree of substitution of hydrophobic moieties of 1.0, and therefore the nominal average number of hydrophobic groups per primary linking group in this particular polyglyceryl thickener is 1.0/4 = 0.25. Inventive Example El 6 uses sorbitan sesquioleate, which nominally has an average degree of substitution of hydrophobic moieties of 1.5 and therefore the nominal average number of hydrophobic groups per primary linking group in this particular polyglyceryl thickener is 1.5/4 = 0.375). Inventive Examples Ε15(Α,Β) and Ε16(Α,Β), which had less hydrophobic substitution, tended to produce relatively high DPg polyglyceryls, whereas the other Inventive Examples were more readily capable of producing a broader range of DPg. Example 3: Preparation of Comparative Examples (C1-C8) and Examples (Ε18 to Ε42) Liquid cleanser formulations were prepared as follows: to a beaker fitted with a mechanical stirrer and hotplate, water, ammonium lauryl sulfate, and ammonium laureth sulfate were added. This was mixed at low-medium speed and heat was slowly applied to the batch to increase the temperature to 75 °C. When the batch reached 75 °C, cocamide ΜΕΑ and a particular commercially-available thickener/test material was added. Heating was stopped after the ingredients were completely dissolved and the batch was allowed to cool to approx. 25 °C, while mixing was continued at medium speed. When the batch reached 25 °C, sodium chloride and DMDM hydantoin were added and mix until completely dissolved. pH was adjusted to 6.4 ± 0.2 using citric acid or sodium hydroxide solution. Water was added in q.s. to 100%. The composition of the various comparative compositions (and weight percentages of ingredients) are shown in the Table 4 below.

The only comparative example which showed some apparent initial ability to thicken was Comparative Example C5, which used Polyglyceryl-3 Methyl Glucose Distearate (believed to be a polyglyceryl emulsifier with a DPg of 3, a methyl glucose residue node structure). However, Comparative Example C5 was not stable and phase separated when standing at room temperature overnight. By comparison the tested Examples of the present invention have show stability while standing at room temperature for at least several months, to a year, or more. Furthermore, to show the effect of DPg, Figure 1 shows Zero Shear Viscosity plotted vs. DPg for Inventive Examples El 8 to Ε42. It is clear from the Figure that those polyglyceryl thickeners with a DP greater than 3 and less than about 11 built viscosity effectively, whereas those with a higher DPgtend not to. Also notable is the effect of average degree of substitution with hydrophobic moieties. Examples Ε37-Ε40, which as discussed above in Example 2, used a polyglyceryl compound with an average degree of substitution of hydrophobic moieties of 1.0 or 1.5 (an average number of hydrophobic groups per primary linking group of either 0.25 or 0.375 respectively) did not build viscosity. Example 5: Dose-Response Rheology of Compositions Comprising Polyglvceryl Thickeners The following personal care compositions, Examples Ε43-56 were prepared. These compositions were tested for Zero Shear Viscosity to evaluate the effect of polyglyceryl thickener concentration on viscosity. Examples El A, Ε13Α, El 4, Ε15Α, Ε16Α, and Ε17Α as well as Example Ε1Β were tested in a formulation base that was identical to the base of Example 2.

As can be seen from the figure, when thickener concentration is increased over the range from 1 to 5 wt% compositions comprising (MGD w/GC) Sample 1A showed an increase of 487-5659 cP (over the viscosity of the base), compositions comprising (MGD w/GC and AGC) Sample 13Α (DPg of 6.8) showed an increase of 57-5716 cP, and compositions comprising (SDO w/GC) Sample 17Α (DPg of 6.3) showed an increase of 860-1333 cP. Compositions comprising the polyglyceryl thickener of Example El 4, which has a DPg of 9.9 (Examples Ε36, 49 and 50) shows some “upward sloping” behavior of viscosity versus thickener concentration. However, compositions comprising the polyglyceryl compound of Example Ε16Α, which has a DPg of 27.0 and an average of 1.5 oleate hydrophobes, compositions with the polyglyceryl compound of Example Ε15Α, which has a DPg of 24.6 and a single oleate hydrophobe, and compositions with the polyglyceryl compound of Example El Β which has a DPg of 29.9 and two oleate hydrophobes, showed reduced viscosity versus the control which continued to decrease as the concentration of polyglyceryl compound was increased. 1.
