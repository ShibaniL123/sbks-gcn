FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a split shaft with adjustment setting comprising a first part and a second part of threadable cylindrical sections, and may optionally further comprise a sleeve for interconnecting the first and second parts by means of threading. The present invention also relates to the shaft-hub assembly comprising essentially said split shaft and a cylindrical hub with two coupable parts. Furthermore, the present invention refers to the use of said split shaft and shaft-hub assembly in cutting disks of planters and subsoilers, as well as wheels of planters. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Machines and implements play an important role in agriculture. Thirty years after its introduction in the national territory, the no-tillage system was consolidated as a conservation technology widely accepted among farmers, with systems adapted to different regions and different technological levels, from large to small farmers using animal traction. The seeder-fertilizer or no-tillage planters are machines that perform the implementation of annual crops by sowing on land wherein no periodical preparation of the soil was performed and with the presence of vegetal coverage. There is a minimum reguired mobilization of soil, only on sowing rows. Thus, it is possible to sowing after the harvest of the previous crop. Usually the units of seeders are combined to fertilizing units, hence the name seeder-fertilizer. The no-tillage, defined as the process of sowing in soil not revolved, in which the seed is placed in grooves or pits, with enough width and depth for the proper coverage and contact of the seeds with the earth, is today understood as a system with the following grounds, that interact: Elimination/reduction of tillage operations. As a result, it avoids the surface sealing, due to the impact of raindrops; conseguently, reduces the surface seepage and increases infiltration, drastically reducing erosion. There is more maintenance of the aggregate stability, improving the soil structure by preventing subsurface compaction. It reduces losses of water by evaporation, increasing the availability of water for plants, the biological activity of the soil and the maintenance of organic matter of the soil. Use of herbicides for weed control. The use of desiccant herbicides means replacing the mechanical energy of soil preparation for the chemical energy (herbicide). It is essential the use of integrated weed control methods, such as the use of coverage crops, crop rotation and specific herbicides. Formation and maintenance of mulch. It provides protection against the impact of rain drops, reducing surface runoff, sediment transport and hence erosion. It also acts on the soil protection against the effect of sunlight, reducing evaporation, the soil temperature and the thermal amplitude of the soil, and against the action of winds. With its decomposition, it incorporates organic matter to the soil, reguired for a larger and richer microbial activity, which allows greater nutrient recycling. In addition, it aids in weed control, by suppressing or allelopathic effect. A precision seeder consists of chassis or tool holder bar, engaging and coupling to the tractor system, transportation system, containers for seed and fertilizer, and driving and transmission system, systems for dosage and distribution of seeds and fertilizer, sowing units, line markers and stirrups. The sowing units are formed by vegetation cutting unit, groove openers for fertilizer, groove openers for seed, depth control system of grooves for seeds, groove grounding system and compacting system of soil over seeds. The disks cut straw and open a groove on which other components work. The most commonly used are straight, with diameters between 18″ and 20″. The larger is the diameter, the greater will be the force necessary for them to penetrate the soil, because of their larger contact area. However, they have the advantage of passing on vegetation and have lower bushing problems. The cutting blades are designed and should be regulated only for cutting straw, not exceeding a depth of more than 6 cm. Preferably, they should be provided with lateral movements, besides vertical adjustments. The deeper, the greater the unwanted mobilization of the soil. Moreover, the excess pressure causes the disk to only push the straw to the bottom of the groove, does not cutting the plant material adeguately and causing the “basketing” of the seeds. The use of cutting disks in “zig zag” also helps preventing bushings; the greater the mismatch of the lines, the greater is the flow of straw between the grooves. Document U.S. 2012/0141199 A1 document, filed on Dec. 2, 2010, by Shanghai Genius Advanced Material CO LTD, and entitled “Shaft Connection Assembly”, describes a set for threaded connection of shafts in order to transfer torque between two shafts, including a hub and a rim. The hub includes a flange part and a sleeve part, the sleeve part having a plurality of sleeve segments formed by longitudinal cuts along the length of the sleeve part so that when the rim is linearly forced, axially outwardly of the flange part, the sleeve segments exert a clamping force on each of the two axes disposed within a passage formed by the hub. The clamping force prevents the relative movement of the first shaft relative to the second when the shafts are rotated around a common axis. This document presents a union scheme by means of a thread that could be adjustable, but there is no information about the existence of rollers inside, not even one can check its applicability for cutting disks of planters and subsoilers.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Although the present invention may be susceptible to various embodiments, there are shown in the drawings and in the following detailed discussion, preferred embodiments with the understanding that the present disclosure is to be considered as an exemplification of the principles of the invention and is not intended to limit the present invention to what is illustrated and described herein. The main approach of this invention relates to a split shaft with adjustment setting comprising a first part and a second part made of steel, wherein said first part comprises a cylindrical section whose inner surface comprises a plurality of grooves, and said second part comprises a cylindrical section whose outer surface comprises a plurality of grooves, so as to provide the threading of said first part to said second part of the shaft, and wherein the diameter of the cylindrical section of the first part is larger than the diameter of the cylindrical section of the second part of the shaft. In a second preferred embodiment of the present invention, a split shaft with adjustment setting comprising a first part, a second part and a central sleeve (3) of cylindrical section, wherein the first part and the second part comprises grooves on its outer surface and the central sleeve (3) comprises grooves on its inner surface, wherein the diameter of the cylindrical section of said first part and second part of the shaft are equal, and the diameter of the inner cylindrical section of said sleeve 3 is greater than the diameter of cylindrical section of said first part and second part of the shaft so as to provide the threading of said first and second parts of the shaft at each end of the sleeve 3. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a shaft-hub assembly comprising: 1) said split shaft 1 with adjustment setting comprising a first part and a second part made of steel;2) a cylindrical hub 8 comprising two coupable parts, wherein said hub comprises a central portion of cylindrical section which extends axially to form an inner seat, wherein one of the parts are inserted and assembled to other internal parts that form the shaft-hub connection, and subsequently the other part of the hub is used for fastening the cutting disk. The hub further comprises a perforated section 10 which allows lubricant insertion across its whole inner surface, facilitating the rolling and minimizing wear. Hub parts are made of cast iron. The two parts of the cylindrical hub 8 are coupled by inserting from approximately six screws 9 around the perforations existing in both sides;3) at least two tapered rollers 2;4) at least two retainers 5 for retaining the lubricant grease, made of rubber;5) at least two dust covers 4, made of felt and attached to a washer, which are used to block out dust in the lubricated inner part of the hub; and6) at least two rings or latches 6, fitted at the ends on both sides of the hub, to prevent escape of any internal parts. Compared to the prior art, the main differences of the shaft-hub assembly of the present invention reside in the split shafts, which have adjustment setting, in the type of rollers that are used and in the use of dust cover. By setting adjustment of the split shaft of the present invention, the durability and strength of the product will be much higher, allowing the user to notice the gap that will eventually occur, and make the necessary adjustments, avoiding the rupture of the hub and of the internal components, which would not be possible to make with the currently existing products on the market. The tapered rollers, also more resistant, are used to monitor and complement the durability of the product, since ball rollers do not meet the requirements for monitoring the progress brought by the invention. As the dust covers, these are extremely useful for inhibiting dust and other impurities in the lubricated part of the product, avoiding the wear caused by dryness originating from the dirt (dust), which also adds to its durability. The assembly of the entire assembly begins by inserting the covers of the rollers in the inner part of the both sides of the hub, fastening them by pressure to the point limited by a shoulder; then, the roller should be placed in one of the sides of the shaft, fitting it under pressure to the existing limit; later, this side of the shaft, already with the fastened roller, must be threaded in the central sleeve 3 until it touches the taper roller; then it must be placed the other roller of the second part of the shaft, likewise, by pressure, to the existing limit; in sequence, the part of the shaft must be inserted (with the roller and the sleeve 3) on one of the sides of the hub, by placing then the other part of the shaft (with the roller) by the other side of the hub, being threaded in the sleeve 3, which will make the setting and adjustment; continuing the mounting, the retainer, the dust covers and rings/latches should be placed on both sides of the hub, necessarily in this sequence. Then, the hub is ready, with the use of its other part, for fastening of the cutting disk of planters and subsoilers, with the use of screws 7. At the end, after the complete mounting of the hub in the cutting disk, all the assembly shall be fastened on the stand of the planter or subsoiler, using a long screw that crosses the whole assembly and is fastened by a nut. The setting is made by the split shaft, wherein in case of looseness in the rollers, causing an instability in the cutting disk, and conseguently, in the whole assembly, the user can simply proceed with the adjustment/setting, returning the product stability, preventing its wear and increasing its durability. The possibility of setting and adjustment as well as the durability of the product, are the great advantages and the major difference of this product over those existing in the market, since the user will avoid constant ruptures due to the setting and strength of the equipment, reducing costs and optimizing time use of their implements, which need not to stand still for sequential exchanges. The application of the shaft-hub assembly can be made in cutting disks of any planters and/or subsoilers currently in the market. Additionally, the split shaft of the present invention can be used separately in wheels of planters.
