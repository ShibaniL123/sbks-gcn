Step 3. tert-Butyl 3,5-difluoro-4-(3-iodo-1-((2-(trimethylsilyl)ethoxy)methyl)-1H-pyrazolo[4,3-d]pyrimidin-5-yl)benzyl(methyl)carbamate
To a solution of tert-butyl 5-(4-(((tert-butoxycarbonyl)(methyl)amino)methyl)-2,6-difluorophenyl)-1H-pyrazolo[4,3-d]pyrimidine-1-carboxylate (1.60 g, 3.36 mmol) in dioxane (16.8 ml) and water (16.8 ml) was added potassium carbonate (2.3 g, 16.8 mmol) and the reaction was stirred at 80° C. for 2 hours. It was then cooled to r.t., diluted with DCM, washed with water, sodium bicarbonate aq. solution and brine. The organic layer was dried over MgSO4, filtered and then concentrated to dryness. The residue was dissolved in acetonitrile (33.6 ml). To the resulting solution was added N-iodosuccinimide (643 mg, 2.86 mmol) and the reaction was stirred at 50° C. for 1 hour. After this time it was cooled to r.t. then DIPEA (588 μl, 3.36 mmol) was added followed by addition of SEM-Cl (507 μl, 2.86 mmol) dropwise. The resulting solution was stirred for 30 mins at r.t. then concentrated to dryness. The residue was purified by silica gel chromatography using 0-70% ethyl acetate in hexanes to afford Intermediate 1 as dark brownish solid (260 mg, 12.2%).
