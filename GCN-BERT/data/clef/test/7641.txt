FIELD OF THE INVENTION The invention relates to a biocatalytic method for oxidizing organic compounds using an alkL gene product, and also microorganisms used in this method. PRIOR ART The OCT plasmid of Pseudomonas putida, for example, contains an alkL gene. This plasmid encodes, moreover, gene products which are responsible for alkane degradation. These alkane degradation genes are arranged on the Pseudomonas OCT plasmid in two alk operons; the first encodes the gene products AlkB, AlkF, AlkG, AlkH, AlkJ, AlkK and AlkL, the second encoding AlkS and AlkT, wherein AlkS has a regulatory function on the expression of the first alk operon. For a more detailed overview and the function of further genes of this alk operon, see Chen et al., J. Bacteriol. 1995 December, 177(23):6894-901. In addition, EP277674 discloses a microbiological method for the terminal hydroxylation of apolar aliphatic compounds having 6 to 12 carbon atoms, such as the production of 1-octanol, by means of micro-organisms of the genus Pseudomonas putida, which are resistant to apolar phases, wherein, inter alia, a plasmid pGEc47 having the alkL gene is used, which carries the two alk operons from Pseudomonas putida as well. The control of the alkL gene is under the control of the native operon promoter and is therefore transcribed and translated together with alkB, alkF, alkG, alkH, alkJ and alkK. WO2002022845 describes a method for producing N-benzyl-4-hydroxypiperidine by hydroxylating N-benzyl-4-piperidine by E. coli cells that carry the above-mentioned plasmid pGEc47. EP0502524 describes a microbiological method for the terminal hydroxylation of ethyl groups on aromatic 5- or 6-membered ring heterocycles using the production of various gene products of the alk operons, for instance, via the plasmid pGEc41, for example, which encodes the gene products of alkB, alkG, alkH, alkT and alkS, but not alkL. The same application additionally describes a plasmid pGMK921 that, like pGEc41, contains the genes for alkB, alkG, alkH, alkT and alkS—but not alkL, the expression of which, however, is possible not only by alkane induction by the native promoter, but also by IPTG induction by the tac promoter (cf. U.S. Pat. No. 5,306,625 too). Schneider et al., in Appl Environ Microbiol. 1998 October; 64(10):3784-90, describe a bioconversion of saturated fatty acids to the ω-1-, ω-2- and ω-3-hydroxy fatty acids thereof in E. coli using a cytochrome-P-450BM-3 monooxygenase and the abovementioned plasmid pGEc47. Favre-Bulle et al., in Nature Bio/Technology 9, 367-371 (April 1991), describe a method for producing 1-octanoic acid by biotransformation of octane with an E. coli bacterium carrying pGEc47 used as biocatalyst. Both alk operons are expressed completely in the method described. The same approach is followed by Rothen et al., in Biotechnol Bioeng. 1998 May 20; 58(4):356-65. It is a disadvantage of the described prior art that gene products that make no significant contribution to the desired oxidation process are produced superfluously by the cell used as biocatalyst and therefore decrease the performance thereof. Furthermore, the unnecessarily co-synthesized alk gene products may contain unwanted enzyme activities that are detrimental to the desired product formation, for instance in that intermediate product escapes as unwanted byproducts. In the desired ω-hydroxylation of an organic radical, the alkJ gene product leads to formation of the corresponding aldehyde. In the case of, for example, the simultaneous presence of the alkH gene product, the resultant aldehyde is further oxidized to the carboxylic acid. Thus, in EP0502524, for generating the desired hydroxylated method product, only the gene products of alkB, alkG and alkT are required, whereby, e.g., the genes alkF, alkJ, alkH and alkS are superfluous. It is disadvantageous here, furthermore, that the synthesis of further alk gene products makes high demands of the metabolic capacity of the host. AlkJ, e.g., is an FAD-containing enzyme (Chen et al., J. Bacteriol, (1995), 6894-6901). However, the FAD pool of the host is already burdened by the unavoidable production of alkT, which likewise contains FAD. Since the FAD synthesis capacity is limited in E. coli, e.g., and is likewise required for existential cell metabolism, the cell is avoidably burdened in the case of unnecessary alkJ production. Furthermore, the gene products of alkB, alkJ and alkH are cytoplasmic-membrane-located or cytoplasmic-membrane-associated. The respiration chain is also located in this region. An excess production of membrane proteins leads from changes in the cell membrane to detachment of membrane vesicles which migrate into the cytosol (Nieboer et al., Molecular Microbiology (1993) 8(6), 1039-1051). This finally leads to premature lysis of the cells (Wubbolts et al., Biotechnology and Bioengineering (1996), Vol. 52, 301-308), all the more so in the high cell density fermentation indispensible for industrial processes. Similarly, in Schneider et al., the gene products of alkB, alkF, alkG, alkH, alkJ, alkK, alkS and alkT are superfluously co-synthesized, since the enzyme actually used for the desired reaction is the cytochrome-P-450BM-3 monooxygenase. With regard to industrial processes, the use of plasmid-encoded metabolic pathways is difficult. With increasing size of fermenter volume, the use of antibiotics for maintaining a selection pressure, which improves the plasmid stability, firstly becomes very expensive, and secondly, effluent-critical. Large fermentations therefore virtually proceed always without any addition of antibiotics. In order, nevertheless, to ensure the genetic stability of the artificial oxidative metabolic pathway, integration of the genes used into the genome of the host organism is desirable. Such an approach succeeds better the smaller is the gene construct that is to be integrated. Since the minimal gene set alkBGTL considered here already has a considerable size, any further nucleotide sequence that is not absolutely necessary must be avoided. In addition to reducing the scope of the necessary molecular biology work and increasing the probability of success thereof, a construct as small as possible also contributes to the genomic stability of the host organism. It was an object of the invention to provide a method which is able to overcome at least one of said disadvantages of the prior art. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Surprisingly it has been found that the method described hereinafter and the genetically modified cells make a contribution to achieving the object in question. The present invention therefore relates to a method for producing an oxidized organic substance, using an alkL gene product as described in Claim 1 and also the recombinant cells used in this method. The invention further relates to the use of an alkL gene product for increasing the oxidation rate. Advantages are the optimal utilization of the resources present in the method, for example with respect to cellular metabolism, in particular under high cell density fermentation conditions. The present invention describes a method for oxidizing an organic substance using at least one oxidizing enzyme and at least one alkL gene product, characterized in that the alkL gene product is provided independently of at least one other gene product encoded by the alk operon containing the alkL gene. The alk genes described in association with this invention encode protein sequences which are termed analogously AlkX. If a plurality of genes alkX, alkY and alkZ are described simultaneously, the nomenclature alkXYZ or, analogously with the proteins, AlkXYZ is used. The expression “oxidation of an organic substance” in association with the present invention is taken to mean, for example, a hydroxylation or epoxidation, the reaction of an alcohol to form an aldehyde or ketone, the reaction of an aldehyde to form a carboxylic acid or the hydration of a double bond. Likewise, multistage oxidation processes are also summarized thereunder, as can be achieved, in particular, by using a plurality of oxidizing enzymes, such as, for example, the hydroxylation of an alkyl radical at a plurality of sites, e.g. at the ω position and ω-1 position, catalysed by various monooxygenases. The expression “using at least one oxidizing enzyme and at least one alkL gene product” is taken to mean, in association with the present invention, the targeted provision of the enzymes and gene products, more precisely in a form how each individual enzyme or gene product considered separately does not occur in free nature. This can proceed, for example, by heterologous production or overproduction of the proteins used in a cell or by providing at least partly purified proteins; however, an altered environment compared to the enzyme occurring in free nature is also included here, for instance in the form that the natural cell containing the enzyme was modified, in such a manner that it produces, for example, certain other proteins in modified form, such as, for example, weakened or strengthened, or provided with point mutations. The expression “alkL gene product”, in association with the present invention, is taken to mean proteins that meet at least one of the two conditions hereinafter: 1.) The protein is identified as a member of the super-family of the OmpW proteins (protein family 3922 in the Conserved Domain Database (CDD) of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)), wherein this assignment is made by an alignment of the amino acid sequence of the protein with the database entries present in the CDD of the NCBI that had been deposited by 22.03.2010, using the standard search parameter, an e value less than 0.01 and using the algorithm “blastp 2.2.23+”, 2.) in a search for the conserved protein domains contained in the amino acid sequence of interest in the NCBI CDD (Version 2.20) by means of RPS-BLAST, the presence of the conserved domain “OmpW, Outer membrane protein W” (COG3047) with an e value less than 1×10−5 is observed (a domain hit). The expression “provided independently of at least one other gene product encoded by the alk operon containing the alk gene”, in association with the present invention, is taken to mean provision of the alkL gene product which is independent of at least one further alk gene product that in a naturally occurring form is coupled to the formation of the alkL gene product. For example, in one operon comprising the genes alkBFGHJKL, the alk gene products of respectively alkBFGHJ and K are coupled to the formation of the alkL gene product, since they are provided via the same promoter. All percentages (%) given are percent by mass, unless stated otherwise.

By means of the method according to the invention, depending on the oxidizing enzyme used and the organic substance used, various oxidation products may be produced, in particular alcohols, aldehydes, ketones and carboxylic acids. These oxidation products may be obtained, for example, by means of the method according to the invention by reacting an organic substance listed hereinafter to form the following: alkane/alkene/alkyne to form alcohol (for example in the presence of a monooxygenase)alcohol to form aldehyde (for example in the presence of an alcohol dehydrogenase or alcohol oxidase)alcohol to form ketone (for example in the presence of an alcohol dehydrogenase or alcohol oxidase)aldehyde to form carboxylic acid (for example in the presence of an aldehyde dehydrogenase)epoxide to form cyanohydrin (for example in the presence of a halohydrin dehalogenase) Within this context, preference is given to producing alcohols and aldehydes, preferably alcohols, in particular ω-alcohols, very particularly ω-hydroxy-carboxylic acids using the method according to the invention, in particular in the form of a hydroxylation reaction. In the method according to the invention, organic substances, in particular carboxylic acids and esters of carboxylic acids, may be oxidized advantageously at the ω-position. In the method according to the invention, all oxidizing enzymes known to those skilled in the art may be used, since the function of the alkL gene product provided is independent thereof. Such enzymes are well known to those skilled in the art under the name oxidoreductase and may be found in enzyme class EC 1.X.X.X of the systematic nomenclature of the Enzyme Commission of the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. Preferably, in the method according to the invention, the oxidizing enzyme used is an alkane monooxygenase, a xylene monooxygenase, an aldehyde dehydrogenase, an alcohol oxidase or an alcohol dehydrogenase, preferably an alkane monooxygenase. A suitable gene for a xylene monooxygenase is, for example, the xylM or the xylA gene, wherein a plasmid containing these two genes has the GENBANK Accession No. M37480. A particularly preferred alkane monooxygenase within this context is characterized in that it is a cytochrome-P450 monooxygenase, in particular a cytochrome-P450 monooxygenase from yeasts, in particular Pichia, Yarrowia and Candida, for example from Candida tropicalis or Candida maltose, or from plants, for example from Cicer arietinum L., or from mammals, for example from Rattus norvegicus, in particular CYP4A1. The gene sequences of suitable cytochrome-P450 monooxygenases from Candida tropicalis are disclosed, for example, in WO-A-00/20566, while the gene sequences of suitable cytochrome-P450 monooxygenases from chickpea may be found, for example, in Barz et al. in “Cloning and characterization of eight cytochrome P450 cDNAs from chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) cell suspension cultures”, Plant Science, Vol. 155, pages 101-108 (2000). A further preferred alkane monooxygenase is encoded by the alkB gene of the alk operon from Pseudomonas putida GPo1. The isolation of the alkB gene sequence is described, for example, by van Beilen et al. in “Functional Analysis of Alkane Hydroxylases from Gram-Negative and Gram-Positive Bacteria”, Journal of Bacteriology, Vol. 184 (6), pages 1733-1742 (2002). Further homologues of the alkB gene can also be found from van Beilen et al. in “Oil & Gas Science and Technology”, Vol. 58 (4), pages 427-440 (2003).

K31 and Marinobacter aquaeolei VT8 are particularly preferred. In this context, it is advantageous if, in addition to AlkB, alkG and alkT gene products are provided; these can either be the gene products isolatable from the organism contributing the alkB gene product, or else the alkG and alkT from Pseudomonas putida GPo1. A preferred alcohol dehydrogenase is, for example, the enzyme (EC 1.1.99.8) encoded by the alkJ gene, in particular the enzyme encoded by the alkJ gene from Pseudomonas putida GPo1 (van Beilen et al., Molecular Microbiology, (1992) 6(21), 3121-3136). The gene sequences of the alkJ genes from Pseudomonas putida GPo1, Alcanivorax borkumensis, Bordetella parapertussis, Bordetella bronchiseptica or from Roseobacter denitrificans can be found, for example, in the KEGG gene database (Kyoto Encylopedia of Genes and Genomes). In addition, preferred alcohol dehydrogenases are those which are encoded by alkJ genes from organisms selected from the group of the Gram-negative bacteria, in particular from the group of the Pseudomonads, there from the genus Pseudomonas, particularly Pseudomonas mendocina, the genus Oceanicaulis, preferably Oceanicaulis alexandrii HTCC2633, the genus Caulobacter, preferably Caulobacter sp.

Preferred alkL gene products used in the method according to the invention are characterized in that the production of the alkL gene product is induced in the native host by dicyclopropyl ketone; in this context it is, in addition, preferred that the alkL gene is expressed as part of a group of genes, for example in a regulon, such as, for instance, an operon. The alkL gene products used in the method according to the invention are preferably encoded by alkL genes from organisms selected from the group of the Gram-negative bacteria, in particular the group containing, preferably consisting of, Pseudomonads, particularly Pseudomonas putida, in particular Pseudomonas putida GPo1 and P1, Azotobacter, Desulfitobacterium, Burkholderia, preferably Burkholderia cepacia, Xanthomonas, Rhodobacter, Ralstonia, Delftia and Rickettsia, the genus Oceanicaulis, preferably Oceanicaulis alexandrii HTCC2633, the genus Caulobacter, preferably Caulobacter sp. K31, the genus Marinobacter, preferably Marinobacter aquaeolei, particularly preferably Marinobacter aquaeolei VT8 and the genus Rhodopseudomonas. It is advantageous if the alkL gene product originates from a different organism from the oxidizing enzyme used according to the invention. In this context, very particularly preferred alkL gene products are encoded by the alkL genes from Pseudomonas putida GPo1 and P1, which are given by Seq ID No. 1 and Seq ID No. 3, and also proteins having the polypeptide sequence Seq ID No. 2 or Seq ID No. 4 or having a polypeptide sequence in which up to 60%, preferably up to 25%, particularly preferably up to 15%, in particular up to 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1% of the amino acid residues are modified in comparison with Seq ID No. 2 or Seq ID No. 4 by deletion, insertion, substitution or a combination thereof and which products still have at least 50%, preferably 65%, particularly preferably 80%, in particular more than 90%, of the activity of the protein having the respective reference sequence Seq ID No. 2 or Seq ID No. 4, wherein 100% activity of the reference protein is taken to mean the increase of the activity of the cells used as biocatalyst, that is to say the amount of substance reacted per unit time, based on the cell weight used (units per gram of cell dry weight [U/gCDW]), compared with the activity of the biocatalyst without the presence of the reference protein, more precisely in a system as described in the exemplary embodiments, in which the oxidizing enzymes used for converting lauric acid, methyl ester to 12-hydroxylauric acid, methyl ester in an E. coli cell are the gene products of alkBGT from P. putida GPo1. A method of choice for determining the oxidation rate may be found in the exemplary embodiments. The definition of the unit here is the definition customary in enzyme kinetics. One unit of biocatalyst reacts 1 μmol of substrate in 1 minute to form the product. 1 U=1 μmol/min Modifications of amino acid residues of a given poly-peptide sequence that do not lead to any substantial changes of the properties and function of the given polypeptide are known to those skilled in the art. For instance, some amino acids, for example, can frequently be exchanged for one another without problem; examples of such suitable amino acid substitutions are: Ala for Ser; Arg for Lys; Asn for Gln or His; Asp for Glu; Cys for Ser; Gln for Asn; Glu for Asp; Gly for Pro; His for Asn or Gln; Ile for Leu or Val; Leu for Met or Val; Lys for Arg or Gln or Glu; Met for Leu or Ile; Phe for Met or Leu or Tyr; Ser for Thr; Thr for Ser; Trp for Tyr; Tyr for Trp or Phe; Val for Ile or Leu. It is likewise known that modifications particularly at the N- or C-terminus of a polypeptide in the form of, for example, amino acid insertions or deletions frequently have no substantial effect on the function of the polypeptide. A preferred method according to the invention is characterized in that the further gene product is selected from at least one of the group consisting of AlkB, AlkF, AlkG, AlkH, AlkJ, and AlkK, in particular consisting of AlkF, AlkG, AlkH, AlkJ and AlkK, wherein further gene products are selected in particular from the group containing, preferably consisting of, the gene combinations: alkBF, alkBG, alkFG, alkBJ, alkFJ, alkGJ, alkBH, alkFH, alkGH, alkJH, alkBK, alkFK, alkGK, alkJK, alkHK, alkBFG, alkBFJ, alkBFH, alkBFK, alkBGJ, alkFGJ, alkBGH, alkFGH, alkBGK, alkFGK, alkBJH, alkFJH, alkGJH, alkBJK, alkFJK, alkGJK, alkFHK, alkBHK, alkFHK, alkGHK, alkBGJH, alkBGJK, alkBGHK, alkBFGJ, alkBFGH, alkFGJH, alkBFGK, alkFGJK, alkGJHK, alkBFJH, alkBFJK, alkFJHK, alkBFHK, alkBFGJH, alkBFGJK and alkBFGJHK, in particular alkFHJK and alkBFGHJK. It is advantageous for the method according to the invention if the oxidizing enzyme and the alkL gene product are provided by a microorganism. In this case, the two enzymes can each be provided separately, each in one microorganism, or together in one microorganism, wherein the latter is preferred. Therefore, a preferred method according to the invention is characterized in that it is carried out in at least one microorganism or in a medium surrounding the at least one microorganism, which microorganism provides the oxidizing enzyme and the alkL gene product. In this context it is preferred that the oxidizing enzyme and the alkL gene product are provided recombinantly in the at least one micro-organism. The remarks now following on recombinant production relate not only to the oxidizing enzyme but also to the alkL gene product. In principle, a recombinant production may be achieved by increasing the number of copies of the gene sequence or the gene sequences which encode the protein, using a modified promoter, modifying the codon usage of the gene, increasing in various ways the half-life of the mRNA or of the enzyme, modifying the regulation of expression of the gene or using a gene or allele which encodes a corresponding protein, and optionally combining these measures. Cells having such a gene provision are generated, for example, by transformation, transduction, conjugation or a combination of these methods using a vector which contains the desired gene, an allele of this gene or parts thereof, and a promoter which makes possible the expression of the gene. Heterologous expression is made possible, in particular, by integrating the gene or the alleles into the chromosome of the cell or a vector replicating extrachromosomally. A survey of the possibilities of recombinant production in cells for the example of isocitrate lyase is given in EP0839211 which is hereby incorporated by reference and the disclosure thereof with respect to the possibilities of recombinant production in cells forms a part of the disclosure of the present invention. The provision and/or production and/or expression of the abovementioned, and all hereinafter mentioned, proteins and/or genes is detectable using 1- and 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis and subsequent optical identification of the protein concentration using corresponding evaluation software in the gel. If the expression performance found is based solely on increasing the expression of the corresponding gene, the recombinant expression can be quantified in a simple manner by comparison of the 1- or 2-dimensional protein separations between wild type and genetically modified cell. A customary method for preparing the protein gels in the case of coryneform bacteria and for identifying the proteins is the procedure described by Hermann et al. (Electrophoresis, 22: 1712.23 (2001)). The protein concentration can likewise be analysed by Western-Blot hybridization with an antibody specific for the protein to be detected (Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: a laboratory manual, 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. USA, 1989) and subsequent optical evaluation using corresponding software for concentration determination (Lohaus and Meyer (1989) Biospektrum, 5: 32-39; Lottspeich (1999), Angewandte Chemie 111: 2630-2647). If the recombinant expression is effected by increasing the synthesis of a protein, then, for example, the number of copies of the corresponding genes is increased or the promoter and regulation region or the ribosome binding site upstream of the structural gene is mutated. By inducible promoters, it is, in addition, possible to increase the expression at any desired time point. In addition, however, it is also possible to assign to the protein gene, as regulatory sequences, what are termed enhancers, which likewise effect increased gene expression via improved interaction between RNA polymerase and DNA. The expression is likewise enhanced by measures for increasing the lifetime of the mRNA. For increasing the recombinant expression of the respective genes, episomal plasmids, for example, are used. Plasmids or vectors which come into consideration are, in principle, all embodiments available to those skilled in the art for this purpose. Such plasmids and vectors may be found, e.g., in the company pamphlets from Novagen, Promega, New England Biolabs, Clontech or Gibco BRL. Further preferred plasmids and vectors may be found in: Glover, D. M. (1985), DNA cloning: a practical approach, Vol. I-III, IRL Press Ltd., Oxford; Rodriguez, R. L. and Denhardt, D. T. (eds) (1988), Vectors: a survey of molecular cloning vectors and their uses, 179-204, Butterworth, Stoneham; Goeddel, D. V. (1990), Systems for heterologous gene expression, Methods Enzymol. 185, 3-7; Sambrook, J.; Fritsch, E. F. and Maniatis, T. (1989), Molecular cloning: a laboratory manual, 2nd ed., Cold Spring Harbour Laboratory Press, New York. The plasmid vector which contains the gene that is to be amplified is then transferred to the desired strain by conjugation or transformation. The conjugation method is described, for example, in Schafer et al., Applied and Environmental Microbiology 60: 756-759 (1994). Methods for transformation are described, for example, in Thierbach et al., Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology 29: 356-362 (1988), Dunican and Shivnan, Bio/Technology 7: 1067-1070 (1989) and Tauch et al., FEMS Microbiology Letters 123: 343-347 (1994). After homologous recombination by means of a cross-over event, the resultant strain contains at least two copies of the gene in question. It is therefore preferred in the method according to the invention that recombinant microorganisms are used; owing to the good genetic accessibility, the micro-organism is preferably selected from the group of the bacteria, in particular the Gram-negative, particularly from the group containing, preferably consisting of, E. coli, Pseudomonas sp., Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas acidovorans, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acidovorax sp., Acidovorax temperans, Acinetobacter sp., Burkholderia sp., cyanobacteria, Klebsiella sp., Salmonella sp., Rhizobium sp. and Rhizobium meliloti, wherein E. coli is particularly preferred. The cells used in the method according to the invention are likewise a component of the present invention. Therefore, microorganisms which have been genetically modified in such a manner that they synthesize at least one enzyme oxidizing an organic substance and at least one alkL gene product in an amplified manner, wherein the alkL gene product is synthesized independently of at least one other gene product encoded by the alk operon containing the alkL gene, are subject matter of the present invention. Preferred oxidizing enzymes in this context are the same oxidizing enzymes which are preferably used in the method according to the invention; the same applies to preferred alkL gene products, preferred gene products encoded by the alk operon containing the alkL gene, preferred organic substances, and also preferred micro-organisms. A further subject matter of the present invention is the use of an alkL gene product, preferably in a micro-organism, for increasing the oxidation rate of at least one enzyme oxidizing an organic substance, characterized in that the use of the alkL gene product proceeds independently of at least one other gene product encoded by the alk operon containing the alkL gene. In this context, the oxidation is preferably the oxidation of an organic substance to an aldehyde or an alcohol, in particular to an alcohol. Therefore, in this context, preferably the hydroxylation rate is increased, in particular in the ω-position in carboxylic acids, preferably in relation to the conversion of carboxylic acids and esters thereof to the corresponding ω-hydroxylated compounds, in particular dodecanoic acid, methyl ester to hydroxy-dodecanoic acid, methyl ester. Preferred oxidizing enzymes in this context are the same oxidizing enzymes that are preferably used in the method according to the invention; the same applies to preferred alkL gene products, preferably gene products encoded by the alk operon containing the alkL gene, preferred organic substances and preferred microorganisms. In the examples discussed hereinafter, the present invention is described by way of example, without the invention, the scope of application of which results from the entire description and the claims, being restricted to the embodiments cited in the examples. The following figures are a component of the examples: FIG. 1: E. coli plasmid “pBT10_alkL” EXAMPLES Comparative Example 1 Expression Vector for the AlkBGT Alkane Hydroxylase System from Pseudomonas putida GPo1 without alkL Starting from the pCOM systems (Smits et al., 2001 Plasmid 64: 16-24), the construct pBT10 (Seq ID No. 5) was produced which contains the three components alkane hydroxylase (AlkB), rubredoxin (AlkG) and rubredoxin reductase (AlkT) from Pseudomonas putida. For expressing the three genes, the alkBFG gene sequence was placed under the control of the alkB promoter and the alkT gene under that of the alkS promoter. For simplification of the cloning of alkB and alkG, the gene alkF situated therebetween was amplified and cloned together with alkB and alkG. AlkF is of no importance for the reaction that is to be catalysed. A more detailed description of the production of the vector pBT10 may be found in WO2009077461. Example 1 Expression Vector for the AlkBGT Alkane Hydroxylase System from Pseudomonas putida GPo1 with alkL In a further approach, the alkL gene was cloned into the alkBFG operon in a targeted manner in order to be able to synthesize it together with the minimum set of enzymes required for the oxidation. For this purpose, the alkL gene from pGEc47 (Eggink et al., 1987, J Biol Chem 262, 17712-17718) was amplified by PCR. The primers P1 and P2 used for this purpose, for cloning into the SalI restriction cutting site of the plasmid pBT10, likewise contain SalI restriction cutting sites outside the target sequence. Furthermore, a stop codon was incorporated into the forward primer P1 downstream of the SalI restriction cutting site in order to terminate possible translation of the alkH residues. (Seq ID No. 6) P1 ACGCGTCGACCTGTAACGACAACAAAACGAGGGTAG (Seq ID No. 7) P2 ACGCGTCGACCTGCGACAGTGACAGACCTG For the amplification, the Finnzyme Phusion polymerase (New England Biolabs) was used. According to the manufacturer's protocol, 34 μl of H2O, 10 μl of 5× Phusion HF buffer, 1 μl of dNTPs (10 mM each), 1.25 μl of P1, 1.25 μl of P2 (for an end-primer concentration of 0.5 μM), 2 μl of pGEc47 plasmid solution (150 ng/μl) and 0.5 μl of Phusion polymerase were mixed and used for the PCR in thin-walled PCR Eppendorf tubes. The following PCR program was programmed in accordance with a proposal of the polymerase manufacturer: [98° C./30 sec], ([98° C./10 sec][72° C./60 sec]) 30×, [72° C./10 min] The resultant PCR product having a length of 754 bp was purified using the “peqGOLD cycle pure Kit” (PEQLAB Biotechnology GmbH, Erlangen) according to the manufacturer's protocol and phosphorylated by T4 polynucleotide kinase. For this purpose, 15 μl of the PCR product solution obtained from the purification were mixed with 2 μl of ATP solution (100 mM), 2 μl of kinase buffer and 1 μl of T4 polynucleotide kinase and incubated for 20 minutes at 37° C. The enzyme was then inactivated by heating it to 75° C. for 10 minutes. The PCR product thus prepared was then ligated in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol into the pSMART vector from lucigen. 2 μl of the ligation batch were transformed by heat shock (42° C. for 45 sec) into chemically competent DH5α E. coli cells. After overnight incubation on kanamycin plates, selected colonies were grown overnight at 37° C. in liquid culture (5 ml of LB medium containing 30 μg/ml of kanamycin) and the plasmids were isolated using the peqGOLD Miniprep Kit (PEQLAB Biotechnologie GmbH (Erlangen)). By restriction cleavage using SalI and subsequent gel electrophoresis, correctly ligated plasmids were identified. Such a plasmid was prepared in a relatively large amount and cleaved with SalI. The resultant 693 bp fragment was isolated by purification from the agarose gel (peqGOLD Gel Extraction Kit). The plasmid pBT10 was likewise prepared in a relatively large amount, cleaved with SalI and the ends were dephosphorylated using alkaline phosphatase (calf intestine [alkaline] phosphatase, CIP) (NEB). These procedures were carried out simultaneously in one reaction tube. For this purpose 13.3 μl of plasmid DNA were mixed with 4 μl of buffer, 19.2 μl of water, 2 μl of alkaline phosphatase and 1.5 μl of SalI (NEB) and incubated for 2 h at 37° C. The cleaved and dephosphorylated vector was likewise purified as described above via an agarose gel. For setting the correct ratio of vector and insert in the ligation, the concentrations of the corresponding DNA solutions were established by agarose gel electro-phoresis. For the ligation, 10 μl of cleaved vector-DNA solution were mixed with 5 μl of insert-DNA solution in such a manner that the DNA mass ratio was 1:5, admixed with 2 μl of ligase buffer, 1 μl of water and also 1 μl of ligase, then incubated for 2 h at 22° C. and thereafter overnight at 4° C. 5 μl of this batch were transformed into DH5α E. coli cells by electroporation. Kanamycin-resistant colonies were grown overnight in 5 ml of LB medium containing antibiotic, and the plasmids were prepared as described above. Restriction cleavage of the plasmid DNA from 5 clones by EcoRV, in three cases, showed in each case bands at 8248 Bp, 2234 Bp and 1266 Bp. This pattern confirms the correct cloning of alkL. The resultant plasmid was called pBT10_alkL (see FIG. 1) and has Seq ID No. 8. Example 2 Conversion of Lauric Acid, Methyl Ester to ω-Hydroxylauric Acid, Methyl Ester For the biotransformation, the plasmids pBT10 or pBT10_alkL were transformed into the chemically competent strain E. coli. W3110 by heat shock at 42° C. for 2 min (Hanahan D., DNA cloning: A practical approach. IRL Press, Oxford, 109-135). For the synthesis of hydroxylauric acid, methyl ester, E. coli W3110-pBT10 and W3110-pBT10_alkL were cultured over-night at 30° C. and 180 rpm in 100 ml of M9 medium (Na2HPO46 g/l, KH2PO43 g/l, NaCl 0.5 g/l, NH4Cl 1 g/l, 2 mM MgSO4, 0.1 mM CaCl2, 0.5% glucose) containing 30 mg/l of kanamycin and harvested by centrifugation. Some of the biomass was resuspended under sterile conditions in 250 ml of M9 medium containing 0.5% glucose and 30 mg/l of kanamycin to give an OD450=0.2 and further cultured in the shaking flask at 30° C. and 180 rpm. Expression of the alk genes was induced after a growth time of 4 h by adding 0.025% (v/v) of dicyclo-propyl ketone and the culture was shaken for 4 further hours under the same conditions. The cells were then centrifuged off, the cell pellet was resuspended in KPi buffer (50 mM, pH 7.4) and placed in a bioreactor heated to and maintained at 30° C. A biomass concentration of about 1.8 g of CDW/1 was set. With vigorous shaking (1500 min−1) and an air inflow of 2 vvm (volumes per unit volume and minute), the substrate lauric acid, methyl ester was added to the cell suspension in the ratio 1:2 (100 ml of cell suspension, 50 ml of lauric acid, methyl ester). The temperature was kept constant at 30° C. Formation of the hydroxylauric acid, methyl ester was detected by GC analysis of the reaction batch. For this purpose, after 0 min as a negative control, and after 150 min, a sample was taken by a syringe by the riser of the reactor and centrifuged in a 2 ml Eppendorf tube in an Eppendorf bench centrifuge for 5 minutes at 13 200 rpm for phase separation. The organic phase was analysed by means of gas chromatography (Thermo Trace GC Ultra). The column used was a Varian Inc. FactorFour™ VF-5 m, length: 30 m, film thickness: 0.25 μm, internal diameter: 0.25 mm. Analytical Conditions: Oven temperature 80-280° C. Ramp 15° C./min Split ratio 15 Injection volume 1 μl Carrier flow rate 1.5 ml/min PTV injector 80-280° C. at 15° C./s Detector Base Temperature: 320° C. The formation rates measured for 12-hydroxylauric acid, methyl ester can now be converted to the activity of the biocatalyst and related to the cell mass used. In the linear range of the reaction kinetics, the activity is given by: activity [U]=converted amount of substance [μmol]/time [min] This unit “U” which is customary for describing enzymes is a measure of the performance of such a biocatalyst at the start of the reaction. Strain Initial activity [U/gCDW] W3110 pBT10 1.82 W3110 pBT10_alkL 48.6 The initial activity was increased by the factor 26.7 by the additionally expressed alkL. 1.
