Example 3-3 : Preparation of 1-(2-bromo-5-hydroxypyridin-4-yl)ethanone (XVIII)
Toluene-4-sulfonic acid 4-acetyl-6-bromo-pyridin-3-yl ester (XVII) (1.3 g, 3.51 mmol) was dissolved in a mixture of tetrahydrofuran (THF) (4 mL), methanol (MeOH) (4 mL) and water (H2O) (2 mL). To the resulting solution was added dropwise lithium hydroxide (LiOH) (294.68 mg, 7.02 mmol) and the solution was stirred at room temperature for 12 hrs. The solution was evaporated under reduced pressure to concentrate, diluted with ethylacetate (EA). The organic solvent was dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate (MgSO4), filtered, and evaporated and concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was isolated and purified by silica gel column chromatography (n-Hex/EA = 3/1) to give the title compound (620 mg, 82 %).
