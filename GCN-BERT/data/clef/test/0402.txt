Second Step: Synthesis of Intermediate 2
Intermediate 1 (120.0 g, 0.39 mol) and triphenylphosphine (407 g, 1.553 mol) were put in a 3 L flask, 1.5 L of dichlorobenzene was added thereto for a nitrogen substitution, and the obtained mixture was stirred for 12 hours at 160Â° C. When a reaction was complete, silica gel was added thereto to volatilize a filtrate therein. The resultant was treated through column chromatography to obtain Intermediate 2 (48.41 g, a yield of 45%).
