Intellectual Property Office Application No. GB1419367.6 RTM Date :24 July 2015 The following terms are registered trade marks and should be read as such wherever they occur in this document: TaqMan (page 2) Intellectual Property Office is an operating name of the Patent Office www.gov.uk/ipo Nucleic Acid Probe The present invention relates to a probe for the detection of a nucleic acid, a method using said probe and a kit of parts. Preferably the probe of the invention is useful in a method for the detection of nucleic acids derived from Chlamydia trachomatis and/or Neisseria gonorrhoeae and may be used in the diagnosis of Chlamydia and/or Gonorrhoea infections. Nucleic acid amplification is one of the most valuable tools in the life sciences field, including application-oriented fields such as clinical medicine, in which diagnosis of infectious diseases, genetic disorders and genetic traits is particularly benefited. In addition to the widely used PCR-based detection (Saiki R.K., Scharf.S., Faloona.F., Mullis,Κ.Β., Horn.G.T., Erlich,Η.A. and Arnheim.N. (1985) Science, 230, 1350-1354), several amplification methods have been invented. Examples include nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA), self-sustained sequence replication (3SR) and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP). PCR uses heat denaturation of double-stranded DNA products to promote the next round of DNA synthesis. 3SR and NASBA eliminate heat denaturation by using a set of transcription and reverse transcription reactions to amplify the target sequence. These methods can amplify target nucleic acids to a similar magnitude, all with a detection limit of less than 10 copies and within an hour or so. They require either a precision instrument for amplification or an elaborate method for detection of the amplified products due to poor specificity of target sequence selection. Despite the simplicity and the obtainable magnitude of amplification, the requirement for a high precision thermal cycler in PCR prevents this powerful method from being widely used, such as in private clinics as a routine diagnostic tool. In contrast, LAMP is a method that can amplify a few copies of DNA to over 100 in less than an hour under isothermal conditions and with greater specificity. As with other molecular-probe based technologies identified above, loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assays can be used to detect the presence of specific microorganisms in a sample. However, the detection methods are based on direct visual detection, turbidity or via a non-specific DNA intercalating dye. Direct visual measurement is end point measurement and is unable to provide real time analysis. Turbidity and non-specific intercalating dyes do provide real time analysis of amplification which occurs however this is non-specific i.e. all amplification is detected whether this is true positive amplification or false amplification due to mis-priming, cross specificity. In accordance with a first aspect of the present invention there is provided a probe for isothermal nucleic acid amplification comprising an oligonucleotide probe sequence complementary to a region of a target nucleic acid sequence, wherein said oligonucleotide probe sequence has only one fluorophore ligand and which ligand is bound to an internal cytosine base and wherein said oligonucleotide probe sequence does not have a 3’ end terminator. In a preferred embodiment to oligonucleotide probe sequence is a DNA sequence and the target nucleic acid sequence is a DNA sequence. Preferably, fluorescence increases to indicate the presence of the target nucleic acid in a sample. The cytosine base is preferably substantially centrally disposed along the oligonucleotide’s length. There are particular benefits associated with labeling the probe internally at a cytosine base. The specificity of the DNA product amplified in an isothermal reaction may be confirmed using a melt curve analysis. However due to a large number of product variants generated in this reaction and a low resolution of melt curve analysis, using intercalating dyes like V13, it is very difficult to distinguish between specific and unspecific DNA products generated under isothermal conditions. Commonly used probes such as TaqMan® probe are not compatible with LAMP technology due to the strand displacement activity of BST polymerase. The probe of the invention is elongated and becomes incorporated into a DNA product during isothermal amplification, which allows for performing a melt curve analysis on the generated product. In the probe of the invention, the fluororphore is conjugated to an internal cytosine complementary to guanine in the antisense strand. Guanine affects the excitation state of many fluorophores resulting in a formation of unique melt curve signatures and allows distinguishing between specific and unspecific products generated under isothermal conditions. The oligonucleotide does not contain a ddNTP at its 3’ end which enables incorporation of the labelled oligonucleotide into the amplicon. Thus, the 3’ end of the probe is not “blocked”. The fluorophore may comprise any one or more selected from the following: FAM, JOE, ΤΕΤ, HEX, TAMRA, ROX, ALEXA and ΑΤΤΟ. The probe may comprise the following sequence: 5’ Χη C* Xm 3’ (SEQ ID NO. 1) Where η is >1, m is >3, X is nucleotide base; and * is a fluorophore. Preferably, the nucleotide base is selected from A, Τ, C and G. Preferably, η is more than 1 to 20 or less, more preferably more than 1 to 10 or less. Preferably, m is more than 3 to 20 or less, more preferably more than 3 to 10 or less. It is contemplated that all combinations of lengths of probe covered by the possible number of nucleotides that η or m make take by the preceding ranges are disclosed. Preferably, the probe may comprise a sequence selected from any one of the following sequences: SEQ ID NO. 3: TAAGATAAC[C-FAM]CCGCACGTG (CT PB1-FAM internal) SEQ ID NO. 5: GCGAACATA [C-ALEXA546] CAGCTATGATCAA (GC porA7-joe loopF) or SEQ ID NO. 6: ATGTTCA [C-JOE] CATGGCGGAG (GC glnA7-ALEXA546 loopB ). The fluorescence is preferably increased when the oligonucleotide is incorporated into the target nucleic acid sequence which results in a change in the configuration of the ampliconprobe complex leading to an alteration of the fluorophore excitation state. The cytosine bound to the fluorophore ligand is not disposed at or proximate to the 5’ or 3’ end. More preferably it is not disposed in the first 3 bases from either the 5’ or 3’ end. Preferably the cytosine bound to the fluorophore is disposed at the middle base of the probe. In accordance with a further aspect of the present invention, there is provided an isothermal nucleic acid amplification probe as described hereinabove. In accordance with a further aspect of the present invention, there is provided a loop-mediated isothermal amplification probe as described above. Methods and compositions for determining at least one target nucleic acid in a mixture of nucleic acids generally employ a probe, a hybridizing reagent, and one or more phosphate bond-forming enzymes associated with any required nucleotide triphosphates to form a nucleic acid chain. These methods usually involve amplification, such as including the use of a promoter in conjunction with a RNA polymerase, a restriction site where only one strand is cleaved and is then displaced by extension with a DNA polymerase, or a circular hybridizing reagent, where concatenated repeats are produced. Detection of the amplified nucleic acid may take many forms but preferably via a fluorophore. In accordance with a further aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of detecting a target nucleic acid in a sample comprising: a. amplifying a target nucleic acid in the sample to provide an amplified nucleic acid; b. probing the amplified nucleic acid with a probe as described hereinabove; and c. detecting the presence of a single or multiple target nucleic acids. The target nucleic acid may be that from a micro-organism, fungi, yeast, virus, human, animal, plant etc. The target nucleic acid for LAMP is known to enable LAMP primers and appropriately specific probes to be synthesised. Thus, the presence or absence of said micro-organism, fungi, yeast, virus, human, animal or plant in a sample can be determined. Preferably the target nucleic acid is from Chlamydia trachomatis or Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Preferably, fluorescence increases to indicate the presence of the target nucleic acid in a sample. The process is isothermal, and allows for amplification in a single stage or sequential stages in a single vessel, where all of the reagents are compatible. In a further aspect, the present invention provides a method of diagnosing Chlamydia and/or Gonorrhea in a patient, comprising providing a sample derived from the patient; adding one or more probes of the present invention to the sample; and detecting the presence of a nucleic acid derived from Chlamydia trachomatis and/or Neisseria gonorrhoeae wherein an increase in the fluorescence of the probe indicates the presence of a Chlamydia trachomatis and/or Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection. The sample may be treated by routine methods to enable the probe to bind with any target nucleotide present in the sample. Such treatment may include centrifuging and lysing the sample to release any target nucleic from the infecting microorganism. In one embodiment, a single type of probe specific for a nucleic acid from either Chlamydia trachomatis or Neisseria gonorrhoeae is used in the method such that either only Chlamydia trachomatis or only Neisseria gonorrhoeae is detected in the sample. In a preferred embodiment, at least two different probes are added to the sample wherein a first probe is labelled with a first fluorescent label and is specific for probing Chlamydia trachomatis nucleic acid and a second probe is labelled with a different fluorescent label to the first probe and is specific for probing Neisseria gonorrhoeae nucleic acid. In this embodiment, it is possible to simultaneously detect a Chlamydia and a Gonorrhea infection in a single sample derived from a patient. In one aspect of the method of the invention, the sample from the patient may be a blood sample, urine sample, serum sample or saliva sample. In accordance with a further aspect of the present invention there is provided a kit comprising a probe as described hereinabove, LAMP reaction buffer containing a polymerase enzyme, dNTPS and LAMP primers for the target. In one embodiment a positive and negative control may be included in the kit. The reagents may be presented as wet reagents or in lyophilised form. The buffer used in the method or kit of the invention comprises dNTPs at a concentration of from 1-10mM, one or more salts at a concentration of from 2-20mM, Tris ρΗ8.8 at a concentration of from 10- 100mM, Trehalose at a concentration of from 10-100mM, BST polymerase at an amount of from 1U-12U and 0.01 %-1% 1,2 propanediol.

V6.21 ρ without V13 dye present) in the following Examples. The concentrations of the buffer components are after buffer reconstitution: V6.21 4-10mM dNTP’s, 10mM salt, 30mM Tris ρΗ8.8, 30mM Trehalose, 1-8U Bst polymerase, Dye and 0.05% propanediol. V6.21p 4-10mM dNTP’s, 10mM salt, 30mM Tris ρΗ8.8, 30mM Trehalose, 1-8U Bst polymerase, and 0.05% propanediol. PCR CT/GC detection in clinical samples by real-time PCR was performed using APTIMA CT/GC multiplex (Gen-Probe) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Agarose Gel Electrophoresis DNA electrophoresis was conducted in 1% agarose gel 1χΤΑΕ buffer at 100V. LAMP DNA products were vitalized with GelRed (Invitrogen) with transilluminator. V6.21 and Ν/6.21ρ buffer were developed by the Applicant. LAMP primers were obtained from Eurofins. Fluorophore-labelled oligonucleotides were purchased from Integrated DNA technologies. Tris buffer, agarose gel and PCR grade water were purchased from Sigma. CT and GC DNA standards were obtained from ATCC. Figures Figure 1 is a schematic of DNA probe of the invention. The probe consists of an oligonucleotide with an internal cytosine conjugated with a defined fluorophore. The probe may be complementary to the internal region of the amplicon flanked by Fip and Bip primers or it may be a modified LoopF or LoopB primer internally labeled with a fluorophore. Example 1 Figures 2Α to 2F shows amplification plots generated with the CT ΡΒ1 (Figure 2Α and Figure 2D), GC glnA7 (Figure 2Β and Figure 2Ε) and GC porA7 (Figure 2C and Figure 2F) primers in V6.21 buffer containing V13 (Figures 2Α, 2Β and 2C) or Ν/6.21ρ buffer without V13 dye (Figures 2D, 2Ε and 2F). The target sequences shown in SEQ ID NOs. 8 to 10 with CT ΡΒ1 internal probe conjugated with FAM, GC glnA7 loop probe conjugated with Joe and GC porA7 loop probe conjugated with Alexa546 respectively. All reactions were performed for 60mins at a constant temperature of 63C with ABI7500 machine. Example 2 Figures 3Α and 3Β are melt curve analyses of LAMP products generated with CT ΡΒ1 primers in the presence of CT ΡΒ1 internal probe conjugated with FAM. 100pg per reaction of ATTC CT DNA standard was used as a positive control. A - normalized reporter plot, Β derivative reporter plot. Melt curve plots were generated based on the readouts in FAM channel with ABI7500 machine. Example 3 Figures 4Α and Β are melt curve analyses of LAMP product generated with GC glnA7 primers in the presence of GC glnA7 loop probe conjugated with JOE. 100pg per reaction of ATTC GC DNA standard was used as a positive control. Figure 4Α shows a normalized reporter plot and Figure 4Β shows a derivative reporter plot. Melt curve plots were generated based on the readouts in JOE channel with ABI7500 machine. Example 4 Figures 5Α and 5Β are melt curve analyses of LAMP product generated with GC porA7 primers in the presence of GC porA7 loop probe conjugated with ALEXA546. 100pg per reaction of ATTC GC DNA standard was used as a positive control. Figure 5Α shows a normalized reporter plot, Figure 4Β shows a derivative reporter plot. Melt curve plots were generated based on the readouts in Cy3 channel with ABI7500 machine. Example 5 Figures 6Α to 6D show the results of a test to confirm the DNA product specificity with a probe of the invention in loop mediated isothermal amplification. The late amplification time of the false positives (more than 30mins after the lowest target DNA concentration detectable in the LAMP reaction (100fg GC DNA) indicates that the unspecific amplification may be a result of primer dimer formation. The standard melt curve analysis does not allow to distinguish between the specific and unspecific product in this LAMP reaction, but the unspecific product may be recognized with the probe of the invention. GC DNA was amplified with GC porA7 primers and visualized with V13 dye or GC porA7-ALEXA546 probe as appropriate. Example 6 Figure 7 shows the amplification plots generated with CT ΡΒ1 primers in V6.21 buffer containing V13 or Ν/6.21ρ buffer without V13 dye but in the presence of CT ΡΒ1 terminal probe (complementary to loop region) with an internal C conjugated with FAM and 3’ terminator (3’ddC). Despite a successful amplification of the target DNA confirmed by excitation of the V13 dye in the control reaction, CT ΡΒ1 probe with 3’ terminator did not generate a positive signal. Example 7 Figures 8Α and 8Β shows the amplification plots generated in Ν/6.21ρ buffer containing ROX in the presence of CT ΡΒ1 primers and CT ΡΒ1 terminal probe with an internal cytosine conjugated with FAM (Figure 8Α), and universal primers and 3’UP probe with 3’ terminal cytosine conjugated with FAM (Figure 8Β). The first line represents signals generated by ROX, and the second line corresponds to the signal generated in the FAM channel. Binding of the probe with an internally labeled C to the target DNA results in FAM excitation. Binding of the probe with a 3’ end C labeled to the target does not alter the FAM excitation state. Example 8 Figures 9Α to 9C show the amplification plots generated with CT ΡΒ1 primers in Ν/6.21ρ buffer without V13 in the presence of CT ΡΒ1 internal probe with an internal C conjugated with FAM and a reference dye (ROX). Figure 9Α show raw data, readouts from the FAM channel in the first line and from the ROX channel in a second line. Figure 9Β shows amplification plots (generated in FAM channel) normalized to ROX. Figure 9C shows derivative reporter melt curve plots. Example 9 Figures 10Α to 10C show the validation of CT PB1-FAM probe specificity. Figure 10Α shows amplification plots generated with CT PB1-FAM probe in the presence of CT DNA and CT primers. As a control, two sets of reactions were performed where unspecific genes, GC glnA7 and GC porA7 were amplified with the corresponding LAMP primers in the presence of CT PB1-FAM probe. In V6.21p buffer the amplification plots in the presence of CT ΡΒ1 probe in the FAM channel were generated only when CT DNA was present in the reaction and no signal was generated when unspecific genes (GC glnA7 and GC porA7) were amplified. No signal was also generated when an unspecific probe was used in a reaction where CT DNA was amplified with CT primers. Figure 10C shows data obtained in an analogous experiment but conducted in V6.21 buffer containing an intercalating dye V31. Figure 10C shows DNA products generated in the experiment described in Figure 10Α. Example 10 Figures 11Α and 11Β shows the validation of CT PB1-FAM probe against APTIMA CT assay. Fifty clinical samples confirmed to be positive (η=29) (Figure 11Α) or negative (η=21) (Figure 11Β) for CT were tested in Ν/6.21ρ buffer with CT PB1-FAM probe. Out of 50 samples 24 tested negative (Figure 11 A) and 26 tested positive (figure 11Β) for CT with CT PB1-FAM probe. There was 86% agreement between the Aptima and CT PB-FAM tests. Example 11 Figures 12Α and 12Β show the amplification plots generated in CT/GC multiplex with CT PB1-FAM + GC porA7-Alexa546 probes. CT and GC DNA was amplified in separate reactions or in conjugation in Ν/6.21ρ buffer in the presence of CT PB1-FAM and GC porA7-Alexa546 probes. The readouts were taken in Cy3 (Figure 12Α) and FAM (Figure 12Β) channels. The experiment revealed that two DNA targets may be amplified and detected in a simultaneous reaction with FAM and Alexa546 labeled probes and that there was no cross reactivity between CT ΡΒ1 and GC porA7 primers and probes. Example 12 Tablel shows a comparison between V13 LAMP for CT and GC, CT/GC Aptima and CT/GC multiplex (CT PB1-FAM + GC porA7-Alexa546). DNA extracted from 136 clinical samples was tested with CT/GC Aptima multiplex, CT ΡΒ1 and GC porA7 primers in V6.21 buffer containing V13 or in a multiplex reaction in ν6.21ρ buffer in the presence of CT ΡΒ1 and GC porA7 primers and CT PB1-FAM and GC porA7-Alexa546 probes. In a control experiment the samples were also tested in a simplex reaction with GC glnA7-joe probe. The table shows the agreement scores between the tests. 1.
