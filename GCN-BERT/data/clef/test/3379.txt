Synthesis of 5-ethynyl-1,3-benzenedimethanol (4)
Under an Ar atmosphere, the compound 3 (6.64 g, 22.9 mmol) was dissolved in THF (100 mL), lithium aluminum hydride (2.60 g, 68.5 mmol, 3.0 eq) was added at room temperature, and the temperature of the mixture was raised to 60Â° C. and stirred for 12 hours. The reaction was quenched with a NaHCO3 solution. Then, extraction with EtOAc was performed, and the organic layer was washed with brine, dried over sodium sulfate, and then subjected to silica gel chromatography (neutral SiO2, hexane/EtOAc=2:1) to isolate a compound 4 (2.26 g, 69%, 13.9 mmol).
