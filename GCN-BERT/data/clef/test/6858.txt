Preparation of a diastereoisomeric mixture of 3-((2R)-2-((3-((tert-butyldiphenylsilyl)oxy)-2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)amino)propyl)-2-methylaniline
3-((Tert-butyldiphenylsilyl)oxy)-2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl trifluoromethanesulfonate (3.04 g, 6.35 mmol) was added to a solution of (R)-3-(2-aminopropyl)-2-methylaniline (1.04 g, 6.35 mmol) and diisopropylethylamine (1.65 mL, 9.53 mmol) in 1,4-dioxane (24 mL). The reaction was heated at 85° C. for 18 hours. After cooling, the reaction was diluted with DCM (250 mL) and washed with water. The aqueous layer was extracted with DCM (2×100 mL), and the combined organics were dried over Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was purified by flash silica chromatography, elution gradient 0 to 25% MeOH in DCM. Product fractions were concentrated under reduced pressure to afford 3-((2R)-2-((3-((tert-butyldiphenylsilyl)oxy)-2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)amino)propyl)-2-methylaniline (2.10 g, 95%) as a gum.
