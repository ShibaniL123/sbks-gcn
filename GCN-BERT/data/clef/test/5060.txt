In another embodiment of the present invention, the pharmaceutical compositions comprise about 7.5 mg of hydrocodone, about 325 mg of acetaminophen, and about 12.5 mg of promethazine. In another embodiment of the present invention, the pharmaceutical compositions comprise about 7.5 mg of oxycodone, about 325 mg of acetaminophen, and about 12.5 mg of promethazine. In another embodiment of the present invention, the pharmaceutical compositions comprise an effective amount of hydrocodone or oxycodone HCl, an effective amount of acetaminophen, and an effective amount of promethazine in a single, oral pill or tablet form having dosage levels that can be safely doubled for combating severe pain. In a further embodiment of the present invention, all or less than all of the total amount of the promethazine is formulated for immediate release into the subject's blood stream. In a further embodiment of the present invention, all or less than all of the total amount of the hydrocodone or oxycodone is formulated for controlled-release into the subject's body. In various embodiments of the present invention, the agents are formulated as oral dosage forms, inhalations, nasal sprays, patches, absorbing gels, liquids, liquid tannates, suppositories, injections, I.V. drips, other delivery methods, or a combination thereof to treat subjects. In another embodiment of the present invention, the agents are formulated as single oral dosage forms such as tablets, capsules, cachets, soft gelatin capsules, hard gelatin capsules, extended release capsules, tannate tablets, oral disintegrating tablets, multi-layer tablets, beads, liquids, oral suspensions, chewable lozenges, oral solutions, oral syrups, sterile packaged powder including pharmaceutically-acceptable excipients, other oral dosage forms, or a combination thereof. In another embodiment of the present invention, the pharmaceutical compositions comprise an agent in immediate release, quick release, controlled release, sustained release, extended release, other release formulations or patterns, or a combination thereof. In one aspect, a composition of the invention comprises three active agents each of which is selected from a decongestant, an antitussive, an expectorant, a mucus thinning drugs, an analgesic and an antihistamine. For example, in one embodiment an agent is an antitussive such as, e.g., codeine, dihydrocodeine, hydrocodone, dextromethorphan and a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof; another agent is a decongestant such as, e.g., phenylephrine, pseudoephedrine and a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and another agent is an expectorant. One will recognize that an active agent may fit into more than one category (e.g., hydrocodone is an antitussive and opioid analgesic). In another embodiment, a composition of the invention comprises an effective amount of an opioid analgesic (e.g., hydrocodone or oxycodone), a non-opioid analgesic (e.g., acetaminophen or ibuprofen), and an antihistamine (e.g., promethazine). In a further embodiment, the composition comprises an effective amount of hydrocodone, acetaminophen and promethazine. In yet a further embodiment, the composition comprises an effective amount of oxycodone, acetaminophen and promethazine. In any of the embodiments disclosed herein, a composition of the invention can be administered using one or more different dosage forms which are further described herein. In other aspects of the invention, a composition of the invention is administered in various dosage forms. For example, a composition comprising multiple active agents can be administered in solid, gel, patch or liquid form. Such dosage forms are further described herein. Examples of such dosage forms are known, such as tablet forms disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,048,526, 3,108,046, 4,786,505, 4,919,939, 4,950,484; gel forms disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,904,479, 6,482,435, 6,572,871, 5,013,726; patches for delivery of pharmaceutical compositions such as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,741,510, 4,624,665, 4,626,539, 4,834,978, 6,469,227, 5,919,479, 6,261,595, 6,303,142, 6,341,387, 6,465,006, 6,613,350, 6,780,426, 7,094,228, 6,756,053; capsule forms disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,800,083, 4,532,126, 4,935,243, 6,258,380; liquid forms disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,625,494, 4,478,822, 5,610,184; or I.V. forms disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,871,353, 4,925,444, 5,484,406; each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In other aspects of the invention, a composition of the invention is administered at various dosages and/or has various release rates (e.g., controlled release or immediate release). Immediate release refers to the release of an active agent substantially immediately upon administration. In one embodiment, immediate release results in dissolution of an agent within 1-20 minutes after entering the stomach. Dissolution can of all or less than all of the active. For example, dissolution of 100% of an agent (antihistamine or antiemetic) can occur in the prescribed time. Alternatively, dissolution of less than all of the agent can occur in about 1 minute to about 20 minutes (e.g., dissolution of about 70%, about 75%, about 80%, about 85%, about about 90%, about 91%, about 92%, about 93%, about 94%, about 95%, about 96%, about 97%, about 98%, about about 99%, about 99.5% or 99.9% of an agent). In another embodiment, immediate release occurs when there is dissolution of an agent within 1-20 minutes after administration. In another embodiment, immediate release results in substantially complete dissolution within about 1 hour following administration. In various embodiments, immediate release occurs when there is dissolution of an agent within 1-20 minutes after administration. Dissolution can be in a subject's stomach and/or intestine. In another embodiment, immediate release results in complete or less than complete dissolution within about 1 hour following administration to a subject. In another embodiment, immediate release results in complete or less than complete dissolution within about 1 hour following rectal administration Immediate release components can also be referred to as instant release. When used in association with the dissolution profiles discussed herein, the term “immediate release” refers to wherein all or less than all of the total amount of a dosage form is dissolved. In some embodiments, immediate release is through inhalation, such that dissolution occurs in a subject's lungs, as further described herein. Dissolution of less than all of an active includes but is not limited to dissolution of about 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 97%, 98%, 99%, 99.1%, 99.2%, 99.35, 99.4%, 99.5%, 99.6%, 99.7%, 99.8% or 99.99% of the active. Controlled-release, or sustained-release, refers to the release of an agent such as a drug or drug component from a composition or dosage form in which the agent is released according to a desired profile over an extended period of time. In one embodiment, controlled-release results in dissolution of an agent within 20-180 minutes after entering the stomach. In another embodiment, controlled-release occurs when there is dissolution of an agent within 20-180 minutes after being swallowed. In another embodiment, controlled-release occurs when there is dissolution of an agent within 20-180 minutes after entering the intestine. In another embodiment, controlled-release results in substantially complete dissolution after at least 1 hour following administration. In another embodiment, controlled-release results in substantially complete dissolution after at least 1 hour following oral administration. In another embodiment, controlled-release results in substantially complete dissolution after at least 1 hour following rectal administration. For example, controlled release compositions allow delivery of an agent to a subject over an extended period of time according to a predetermined profile. Such release rates can provide therapeutically effective levels of agent for an extended period of time and thereby provide a longer period of pharmacologic or diagnostic response as compared with conventional rapid release dosage forms. Such longer periods of response provide for many inherent benefits that are not achieved with immediate release dosages. In using analgesics for treatments of chronic pain, controlled release formulations can be preferred over conventional short-acting formulations. When used in association with the dissolution profiles discussed herein, the term “controlled-release” refers to wherein all or less than all of the total amount of a dosage form, made according to the present invention, delivers an active agent over a period of time greater than 1 hour. When present in a controlled-release oral dosage form, the compositions of the present invention can be dosed at a substantially lower daily dosage level than conventional immediate release products. At comparable daily dosage levels, the controlled release oral solid dosage forms can provide greater in pain relief than conventional immediate release products. Combination Formulations Various aspects of the invention are directed to compositions comprising an effective amount of an analgesic and an active agent that is useful for reducing an adverse effect associated with such one or more opioid analgesics, and/or one or more non-opioid analgesic. Such additional active agents include anitemetics and antihistamines. In some embodiments, the analgesics are opioid or non-opioid analgesics (e.g., hydrocodone or oxycodone and acetaminophen). In a further embodiment, the active agent which reduces adverse effects of such analgesics is promethazine. In one embodiment, a pharmaceutical composition of the invention, by reducing adverse effects associated with an opioid and/or non-opioid analgesic allows for higher dosages for said analgesics in the pharmaceutical composition. For example, in a subject who could not otherwise tolerate a certain dosage of an opioid analgesic, a pharmaceutical composition of the invention comprising an opioid analgesic, a non-opioid analgesic and promethazine, will reduce the adverse effects (e.g. nausea, vomiting) associated with the analgesic, thus allowing for increased dosages to be administered. Furthermore, administration would be through a single composition. In various embodiments, the analgesic agent of the multidrug composition comprises, an to opioid analgesic such as hydrocodone, oxycodone, morphine, diamorphine, codeine, pethidine, alfentanil, buprenorphine, butorphanol, codeine, dezocine, fentanyl, hydromorphone, levomethadyl acetate, levorphanol, meperidine, methadone, morphine sulfate, nalbuphine, oxycodone, oxymorphone, pentazocine, propoxyphene, remifentanil, sufentanil, or tramadol; and an opioid an antagonists such as nalmefene, naloxone, or naltrexone. The composition can further comprise antitussives such as codeine or dextromethorphan. In some embodiments, a composition of the invention comprises an opioid and non-opioid analgesic such as: codeine/acetaminophen, codeine/aspirin, hydrocodone/acetaminophen, hydrocodone/ibuprofen, oxycodone/acetaminophen, oxycodone/aspirin, or propoxyphene/aspirin or acetaminophen. Therefore, in some embodiments, a composition comprises an analgesic and an active agent useful for reducing or eliminating adverse effects, such as an antihistamine (e.g., promethazine) and/or an antiemetic, as described herein. In other embodiments the composition comprises an opioid, a non-opioid analgesic, and an antihistamine (e.g., promethazine). For example, in one embodiment, a composition comprises an opioid and/or non-opioid analgesic and promethazine. In further embodiments, the composition further comprises an anti-emetic.

For example, in one embodiment, a composition comprises hydrocodone, acetaminophen and promethazine. In another embodiment, a composition comprises oxycodone, acetaminophen and promethazine. Administration One aspect of the present invention provides a method for preventing an adverse effect such as nausea, vomiting, other gastric upsets, skin rashes, allergic reactions such as swelling, difficulty breathing, closing of throat, abdominal pain, unusual bleeding or bruising and skin rashes in a subject receiving or in need of opioid analgesic therapy by the administration of acetaminophen or other non-opiod analgesic and promethazine or other antihistamine with the chosen opioid analgesics. Accordingly, the invention provides methods for treating pain, comprising administering to a subject in need thereof an effective amount of an opioid analgesic agent, a non-opioid analgesic agent and an agent that reduces side affects of the opioid analgesic agent. In one embodiment, the non-opioid analgesic agent is acetaminophen. In another embodiment, the agent that reduces a adverse effect is promethazine. The administration can continue for only a relatively short time in the case of an acute condition requiring opioid therapy or for long periods in the case of conditions requiring chronic use of opioid analgesics. The dosing of analgesics can be dependent upon the condition being treated, the subject's individual perception of pain and the use of the opioid on a set time schedule as a prophylactic to prevent the onset of pain or on an as needed basis in response to perceived pain. The choice of selecting a dosage of a composition that contains suitable amount of promethazine can be dependent upon the extent and severity of the adverse effects including nausea, vomiting, other gastric upsets, skin rashes, allergic reactions such as swelling, difficulty breathing, closing of throat, abdominal pain, unusual bleeding or bruising and skin rashes in a subject, upon the sensitivity to side-effect-reducing compounds such as promethazine in a subject, upon the likelihood of subject losing medication by vomiting, and/or on an as needed basis in response to perceived adverse effects. The dosage can be assessed by a prescribing professional evaluating the subject, the condition treated, the analgesic to be used, diet and the expected duration of therapy. In one embodiment, the present invention provides for a method for treating a subject suffering from or susceptible to pain, comprising administering to said subject a pharmaceutical composition comprising an effective amount of a first component which is a non-opioid analgesic, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, an effective amount of a second component which is a non-opioid analgesic, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and and an effective amount of a third component which is an antihistamine. In another embodiment, a method for treating a subject is provided comprising administering a pharmaceutical composition comprising: an effective amount of a first agent which is a non-opioid analgesic, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof; an effective amount of a second agent which is an opioid analgesic, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof; and an effective amount of a third component which is an antihistamine. In one embodiment the at least one adverse effect is selected from the group consisting of nausea, vomiting, other gastric upsets, skin rashes, allergic reactions such as swelling, difficulty breathing, closing of throat, abdominal pain, unusual bleeding or bruising and skin rashes. In one embodiment the non-opioid analgesic is acetaminophen or analogue thereof. In one embodiment, the antihistamine is promethazine. In one embodiment, the opioid analgesic is hydrocodone. In another embodiment the opioid analgesic is oxycodone. In another embodiment, the present invention provides for a method for preventing a to adverse effect such as nausea, vomiting, and a skin rash in a subject receiving or in need of opioid therapy by the administration of acetaminophen or analogue thereof and promethazine with the opioid analgesic. In one embodiment, the opioid analgesic is hydrocodone. In another embodiment the opioid analgesic is oxycodone. In one embodiment, administration of a composition comprising a non-opioid analgesic and an antihistamine enhances the reduction or elimination of adverse effects associated with an opioid analgesic. For example, addition of promethazine and acetaminophen/ibuprofen reduces or eliminates an adverse effect associated with an opioid analgesic in a synergistic manner. It is believed that administration of a composition of the invention would result in treatment of the subject which includes elimination or reduction of an adverse effect associated with analgesics (e.g., opioids) and enhance the beneficial uses of such analgesics. Such an adverse effect can otherwise render administration of certain analgesics intolerable, due to for example vomiting, nausea, and skin rashes. Therefore, various embodiments of the methods of the invention are directed to target populations of subjects that are susceptible to such an adverse effect(s), thus allowing such subjects to benefit from the pain-alleviating effects of analgesic-based pain relief, administration of which would otherwise be intolerable. For example, by reducing the risk of vomiting, the risk of subject losing the analgesics (and losing the pain-relieving beneficial effects of analgesics) by vomiting is minimized Furthermore, administration can be adjusted to provide the dose of side-effect-reducing compound to match the subject's analgesic ingestion without separate intervention by the health care professionals. Adding one or more additional active agents, such as promethazine, to the present compositions is believed to result in a composition having reduced potential for abuse and diversion. Dosage In various aspects a composition of the invention comprises multiple active agents at the same or different dosages. In some embodiments, the analgesic components may vary in dosages as further described herein, and the antihistamine or antiemetic dosage can be adjusted according to the particular analgesics used.

Furthermore, the acetaminophen is in a range of between about 200 mg to about 600 mg, including but not limited to 200 mg, 225 mg, 250 mg, 275 mg, 300 mg, 325 mg, 350 mg, 375 mg, 400 mg, 425 mg, 450 mg, 475 mg, 500 mg, 525 mg, 550 mg, 575 mg, 600 mg, and a preferred range of about 325 mg. The pharmaceutical composition further comprises between about 0.5 mg to about 60 mg of an antihistamine (e.g., promethazine), including but not limited to 0.5 mg, 1.0 mg, 1.5 mg, 2.0 mg, 2.5 mg, 3.0 mg, 3.5 mg, 4.0 mg, 4.5 mg, 5.0 mg, 5.5 mg, 6.0 mg, 6.5 mg, 7.0 mg, 7.5 mg, 8.0 mg, 8.5 mg, 9,0 mg, 9.5 mg, 10 mg, 10.5 mg, 11.0 mg, 11.5 mg, 12.0 mg, 12.5 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg, 30 mg, 40 mg, 50 mg, or 60 mg. In one embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition provides promethazine at 12.5 mg. In one embodiment, a composition of the invention comprises oxycodone, acetaminophen and promethazine, wherein the composition comprises the agents in a ratio of about (1 to 2):(40 to 45):(1 to 2), respectively. For example, in one embodiment, the ratio of amounts for each active agent is (1):(43.33):(1.67) for oxycodone, acetaminophen and promethazine, respectively. In one embodiment, a pharmaceutical composition of the invention comprises an antihistamine (e.g., promethazine) at a lower dosage than that which the antihistamine is administered alone. For example, the antihistamine is provided in the composition at a dosage to prevent sedation, which may be observed with relatively higher dosages of promethazine. Thus in some embodiments, promethazine is provided at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5.5., 6, 6.5, 7, 7.5, 8, 8.5, 9, 9.5, 10, 10.5, 11, 11.5, 12, 12.5, 13, 13.5, 14, 14.5, 15, 15.5, 16, 16.5, 17, 17.5, 18, 18.5, 19, 19.5, 20, 20.5, 21, 21.5, 22, 22.5, 23, 23.5, 24, 24.5, 25, 25.5, 26, 26.5, 27, 27.5, 28, 28.5, 29, 29.5, 30, 30.5, 31, 31.5, 32, 33, 33.5, 34, 34.5, 35, 36, 36.5, 37, 37.5, 38, 38.5, 39, 39.5, 40, 40.5, 41, 41.5, 42, 42.5, 43, 43.5, 44, 44.5, 45, 45.5, 46, 46.5, 47, 47.5, 48, 48.5, 49, 49.5 or 50. Therefore, an antihistamine or antiemetic (e.g., promethazine) can be provided at a dosage that is effective in reducing adverse affects associated with the opioid analgesic and/or non-opioid analgesic, but is at a relative low enough dosage (e.g., given the subject's weight) to prevent sedation associated with the antihistamine/antiemetic. Examples of adverse effects include acute liver toxicity, allergic reactions such as swelling, difficulty breathing, closing of throat, abdominal pain, nausea, unusual bleeding or bruising. In one embodiment, a pharmaceutical composition of the invention comprises 6-8 mg of hydrocodone (such as about 6.0 mg, 6.1 mg, 6.2 mg, 6.3 mg, 6.4 mg, 6.5 mg, 6.6 mg, 6.7 mg, 6.8 mg, 6.9 mg, 7.0 mg, 7.1 mg, 7.2 mg, 7.3 mg, 7.4 mg, 7.5 mg, 7.6 mg, 7.7 mg, 7.8 mg, 7.9 mg, or 8.0 mg,), 310-330 mg of acetaminophen (such as about 310 mg, 315 mg, 320 mg, or 325 mg), and 5-13 mg of promethazine (such as about 10 mg, 10.5 mg, 11.0 mg, 11.5 mg, 12.0 mg, 12.5 mg, 13.0, mg, 13.5 mg, 14.0 mg, 14.5 mg, or 15 mg). The hydrocodone and the acetaminophen can be formulated using conventional technologies to provide for an extended time release over a desired dosage interval. All or some of the promethazine is formulated for immediate release to help abate common adverse effects associated with the hydrocodone and/or acetaminophen including nausea, vomiting, other gastric upsets, skin rashes, allergic reactions such as swelling, difficulty breathing, closing of throat, abdominal pain, unusual bleeding or bruising. In one embodiment, a composition of the invention comprises from 1% to 20% by weight of an antihistamine (such as 1%, 1.5%, 2%, 2.5%, 3%, 3.5%, 4%, 4.5%, 5%, 5.5%, 6%, 6.5%, 7%, 7.5%, 8%, 8.5%, 9%, 9.5%, 10%, 10.5%, 11%, 11.5%, 12%, 12.5%, 13%, 13.5%, 14%, 14.5%, 15%, 15.5%, 16%, 16.5%, 17%, 17.5%, 18%, 18.5%, 19%, 19.5%, or 20%); from 10% to 80% by weight a non-opioid analgesic (such as 10%, 10.5%, 11%, 11.5%, 12%, 12.5%, 13%, 13.5%, 14%, 14.5%, 15%, 15.5%, 16%, 16.5%, 17%, 17.5%, 18%, 18.5%, 19%, 19.5%, 20%, 20.5%, 21%, 21.5%, 22%, 22.5%, 23%, 23.5%, 24%, 24.5%, 25%, 25.5%, 26%, 26.5%, 27%, 27.5%, 28%, 28.5%, 29%, 29.5%, 30%, 30.5%, 31%, 31.5%, 32%, 32.5%, 33%, 33.5%, 34%, 34.5%, 35%, 35.5%, 36%, 36.5%, 37%, 37.5%, 38%, 38.5%, 39%, 39.5%, 40%, 40.5%, 41%, 41.5%, 42%, 42.5%, 43%, 43.5%, 44%, 44.5%, 45%, 45.5%, 46%, 46.5%, 47%, 47.5%, 48%, 48.5%, 49%, 49.5%, 50%, 50.5%, 51%, 51.5%, 52%, 52.5%, 53%, 53.5%, 54%, 54.5%, 55%, 55.5%, 56%, 56.5%, 57%, 57.5%, 58%, 58.5%, 59%, 59.5%, 60%, 60.5%, 61%, 61.5%, 62%, 62.5%, 63%, 63.5%, 64%, 64.5%, 65%, 65.5%, 66%, 66.5%, 67%, 67.5%, 68%, 68.5%, 69%, 69.5%, 70%, 70.5%, 71%, 71.5%, 72%, 72.5%, 73%, 73.5%, 74%, 74.5%, 75%, 75.5%, 76%, 76.5%, 77%, 77.5%, 78%, 78.5%, 79%, 79.5%, 80%); and from 1% to 20% by weight of an opioid analgesic (such as 1%, 1.5%, 2%, 2.5%, 3%, 3.5%, 4%, 4.5%, 5%, 5.5%, 6%, 6.5%, 7%, 7.5%, 8%, 8.5%, 9%, 9.5%, 10%, 10.5%, 11%, 11.5%, 12%, 12.5%, 13%, 13.5%, 14%, 14.5%, 15%, 15.5%, 16%, 16.5%, 17%, 17.5%, 18%, 18.5%, 19%, 19.5%, or 20%). In one embodiment, a composition of the invention comprises 6-8 mg of oxycodone HCl (such as about 7.5 mg), 310-330 mg of acetaminophen (such as about 325 mg), and 6-8 mg of promethazine (such as about 12.5 mg). The oxycodone HCl and the acetaminophen can be formulated using conventional technologies to provide for an extended time release over a desired dosage interval. All or some of the promethazine is formulated for immediate release. Therefore, in one embodiment, administration of a composition of the invention comprising such a promethazine active agent can result in reduced, abated or eliminated adverse effects associated with the oxycodone HCl and/or acetaminophen. Reduced, abated or eliminated adverse effects include but are not limited to including nausea, vomiting, other gastric upsets, skin rashes, allergic reactions such as swelling, difficulty breathing, closing of throat, abdominal pain, unusual bleeding or bruising or any combination thereof. The dosages and concentrations of active agents in the compositions may be varied as desired, as further described herein. Depending on the subject and/or condition being treated and on the administration route, the active agent in a composition can generally be administered in dosages of 0.01 mg to 500 mg V/kg body weight per day, e.g. about 20 mg/day for an average person. The dosage can be adjusted based on the mode of administration. A typical dosage may be one administration daily, or multiple administrations daily. Of course for prolonged or controlled-release dosage forms (e.g., patches) the unit dose is designed for administration over a defined period of time. In some embodiments, dosage for one or a combination of agents can be from 0.01 to 5 mg, 1 to 10 mg, 5 to 20 mg, 10 to 50 mg, 20 to 100 mg, 50 to 150 mg, 100 to 250 mg, 150 to 300 mg, 250 to 500 mg, 300 to 600 mg or 500 to 1000 mg V/kg body weight. Dose levels can vary as a function of the specific compound, the severity of the symptoms and the susceptibility of the subject to adverse effects. Routes of Administration In various embodiments of the present invention, the active agents are formulated to be administered through oral dosage forms (e.g., tablets, capsules, gels), inhalations, nasal sprays, patches, absorbing gels, liquids, liquid tannates, suppositories, injections, I.V. drips, other delivery methods, or a combination thereof to treat subjects. Administration may be performed in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to orally, subcutaneously, intravenously, intranasally, intraotically, transdermally, topically (e.g., gels, salves, lotions, creams, etc.), intraperitoneally, intramuscularly, intrapulmonary (e.g., AERx® inhalable technology commercially available from Aradigm, or Inhance, pulmonary delivery system commercially available from Inhale Therapeutics), vaginally, parenterally, rectally, or intraocularly. To prepare the present compositions, the active agents can be mixed with a suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Upon mixing of the compounds, the resulting composition can be a solid, a half-solid, a solution, suspension, or an emulsion. Such compositions can be prepared according to methods known to those skilled in the art. The forms of the resulting compositions can depend upon a variety of factors, including the intended mode of administration and the solubility of the compounds in the selected carrier or vehicle. The effective concentration of analgesics is sufficient for lessening or alleviating pain. In one embodiment of the invention, the components of the present compositions are at least one opioid analgesic agent (e.g., hydrocodone/oxycodone), one non-opioid analgesic agent (e.g., acetaminophen), and one antihistamine agent (e.g., promethazine). In other embodiments, administration comprises administration of an antihistamine (e.g., promethazine) separately, prior to, or during administration of the analgesic formulations described herein (e.g., which comprises hydrocodone and acetaminophen). The agents of the compositions and methods of the present invention can be administered by the nasal inhalation route using conventional nebulizers or by oxygen aerosolization to provide convenient pain relief with reduced adverse effects. The agents can be suspended or dissolved in a pharmacologically acceptable inhalation carrier. Examples of such carriers are distilled water, water/ethanol mixtures, and physiological saline solution. Conventional additives including sodium chloride, glucose, citric acid and the like may be employed in these dosage forms to stabilize or to provide isotonic media. In one embodiment of the invention, the compositions suitable for nasal inhalation by oxygen aerosolization administration comprise hydrocodone or oxycodone, acetaminophen, and promethazine. In other embodiments, an antihistamine (e.g., promethazine) can be administered separately, prior to, or during administration of the compositions described herein (e.g., those comprising hydrocodone and acetaminophen). The agents of the present invention can also be administered as a self-propelled dosage unit in aerosol form suitable for inhalation therapy. Suitable means for employing the aerosol inhalation therapy technique are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 6,913,768 to Couch et al., incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The agent can be suspended in an inert propellant such as a mixture of dichlorodifluoromethane and dichlorotetrafluoroethane, together with a co-solvent such as ethanol, together with other medications such as albuterol, together with flavoring materials and stabilizers. In one embodiment of the invention, the agents useful for a self-propelled dosage unit in aerosol form administration are hydrocodone or oxycodone, acetaminophen, and promethazine. The agents of the compositions and methods of the present invention can also be administered as nasal spray/drop compositions, which can conveniently and safely be applied to subjects to effectively treat pain with reduced adverse effects. The compositions may further comprise a water soluble polymer such as polyvinylpyrrolidone, together with other medications such as sumatriptan, together with bioadhesive material. In one embodiment of the invention, the components of a composition for nasal spray or drop administration are hydrocodone or oxycodone agent, acetaminophen, and promethazine. The compositions of the present invention can also be administered topically to the skin of a subject. The agents can be mixed with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or a base which is suitable for topical application to skin to form a dermatological composition. Suitable examples of carrier or base include, but not limited to, water, glycols, alcohols, lotions, creams, gels, emulsions, and sprays. A dermatological composition comprising an analgesic agent can be integrated into a topical dressing, medicated tape, dermal patch absorbing gel and cleansing tissues. In one embodiment of the invention, the dermatological composition comprises hydrocodone or oxycodone, acetaminophen, and promethazine. The compositions of the present invention can also be in liquid or liquid tannate form. The liquid formulations can comprise, for example, an agent in water-in-solution and/or suspension form; and a vehicle comprising polyethoxylated castor oil, alcohol and/or a polyoxyethylated sorbitan mono-oleate with or without flavoring. Each dosage form comprises an effective amount of an active agent and can optionally comprise pharmaceutically inert agents, such as conventional excipients, vehicles, fillers, binders, disentegrants, solvents, solubilizing agents, sweeteners, coloring agents and any other inactive agents that can be included in pharmaceutical dosage forms for oral administration. Examples of such vehicles and additives can be found in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 17th edition (1985). Therefore, in one embodiment a liquid composition of the invention comprises an opioid analgesic (e.g., hydrocodone or oxycodone), a non-opioid analgesic (e.g., acetaminophen) and an antihistamine (e.g., promethazine). The compositions of the present invention can also be administered in a suppository form, comprising an outer layer containing the composition in a suppository base. The suppository base may, for example, be any conventional suppository base material such as glycogelatin, polyethylene glycol, fractionated palm kernel oil, or one or more natural, synthetic or semisynthetic hard fats such as cocoa butter. Therefore, in one embodiment of the invention, the base material is mixed with an opioid analgesic (e.g., hydrocodone/oxycodone), a non-opioid analgesic (e.g., acetaminophen) and an antihistamine (e.g., promethazine). The compositions of the present invention can also be administered in injection-ready stable liquids for injection or I.V. drip. For example, saline or other injection-ready liquid can be mixed with an opioid analgesic (e.g., hydrocodone or oxycodone), a non-opioid analgesic (e.g., acetaminophen) and an antihistamine (e.g., promethazine). Dosage Forms In various embodiments of the invention, a composition is in one or more dosage form. For example, a composition can be administered in a solid or liquid form. Examples of solid dosage forms include but are not limited to discrete units in capsules or tablets, as a powder or granule, or present in a tablet conventionally formed by compression molding. Such compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the three or more agents and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The molded tablets can be optionally coated or scored, having indicia inscribed thereon and can be so formulated as to cause immediate, substantially immediate, slow, or controlled release of the hydrocodone and/or the acetaminophen. Furthermore, dosage forms of the invention can comprise acceptable carriers or salts known in the art, such as those described in the Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients, American Pharmaceutical Association (1986), incorporated by reference herein. In one embodiment, the components are mixed with a pharmaceutical excipient to form a solid preformulation composition comprising a homogeneous mixture of compounds of the present invention. When referring to these compositions as “homogeneous”, it is meant that the agents are dispersed evenly throughout the composition so that the composition can be subdivided into unit dosage forms such as tablets or capsules. This solid preformulation composition can then subdivided into unit dosage forms of the type described above comprising from, for example, about 1.0 mg to about 15 mg of an opioid, such as hydrocodone or oxycodone of the present invention. The compositions can be formulated, in the case of capsules or tablets, to be swallowed whole, for example with water. The inclusion of the side-effect-reducing agent such as an antihistamine or antiemetic to abate common symptoms of nausea and vomiting are believed beneficial in that promethazine or the like will eliminate or minimize the amount of discomfort. Adverse effects reduced or eliminated include but are not limited to nausea, vomiting, other gastric upsets, skin rashes, allergic reactions such as swelling, difficulty breathing, closing of throat, abdominal pain, unusual bleeding or bruising Frequently, subjects taking opioids have adverse effects including vomiting that can occur shortly after taking a first or subsequent dose. As a consequence, a portion of the opioid dose is subsequently lost, making it difficult to accurately gauge replacement dosages for the subject, and for subjects outside of a hospital or clinic environment, there might not be any alternative form of pain medication readily available. As a consequence, subjects experiencing gastric discomfort such as vomiting will lack the beneficial effects of the opioid analgesic and experience the additional discomfort and enhanced pain associated with vomiting. This problem is solved by also administering promethazine, which reduces side-effects. The dosage forms of the present invention can be manufactured using processes that are well known to those of skill in the art. For example, for the manufacture of bi-layered tablets, the agents can be dispersed uniformly in one or more excipients, for example, using high shear granulation, low shear granulation, fluid bed granulation, or by blending for direct compression. Excipients include diluents, binders, disintegrants, dispersants, lubricants, glidants, stabilizers, surfactants and colorants. Diluents, also termed “fillers”, can be used to increase the bulk of a tablet so that a practical size is provided for to compression. Non-limiting examples of diluents include lactose, cellulose, microcrystalline cellulose, mannitol, dry starch, hydrolyzed starches, powdered sugar, talc, sodium chloride, silicon dioxide, titanium oxide, dicalcium phosphate dihydrate, calcium sulfate, calcium carbonate, alumina and kaolin. Binders can impart cohesive qualities to a tablet formulation and can be used to help a tablet remain intact after compression. Non-limiting examples of suitable binders include starch (including corn starch and pregelatinized starch), gelatin, sugars (e.g., glucose, dextrose, sucrose, lactose and sorbitol), celluloses, polyethylene glycol, waxes, natural and synthetic gums, e.g., acacia, tragacanth, sodium alginate, and synthetic polymers such as polymethacrylates and polyvinylpyrrolidone. Lubricants can also facilitate tablet manufacture; non-limiting examples thereof include magnesium stearate, calcium stearate, stearic acid, glyceryl behenate, and polyethylene glycol. Disintegrants can facilitate tablet disintegration after administration, and non-limiting examples thereof include starches, alginic acid, crosslinked polymers such as, e.g., crosslinked polyvinylpyrrolidone, croscarmellose sodium, potassium or sodium starch glycolate, clays, celluloses, starches, gums and the like. Non-limiting examples of suitable glidants include silicon dioxide, talc and the like. Stabilizers can inhibit or retard drug decomposition reactions, including oxidative reactions. Surfactants can also included and can be anionic, cationic, amphoteric or nonionic. If desired, the tablets can also comprise nontoxic auxiliary substances such as pH buffering agents, preservatives, e.g., antioxidants, wetting or emulsifying agents, solubilizing agents, coating agents, flavoring agents, and the like. Extended or controlled-release formulations can comprise one or more combination of excipients that slow the release of the agents by coating or temporarily bonding or decreasing their solubility of the active agents. Examples of these excipients include cellulose ethers such as hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (e.g., Methocel K4M), polyvinylacetate-based excipients such as, e.g., Kollidon SR, and polymers and copolymers based on methacrylates and methacrylic acid such as, e.g., Eudragit NE 30D. In one embodiment of the invention, the analgesic agents (e.g., hydrocodone or oxycodone, and acetaminophen) are formulated for extended or controlled-release while the promethazine is formulated for immediate release. In another embodiment, all agents are formulated for extended or controlled-release. Pharmaceutical carriers or vehicles suitable for administration of the compounds provided herein include all such carriers known to those skilled in the art to be suitable for the particular mode of administration. In addition, the analgesics and promethazine can also be administered with other components that do not impair the desired action, or with components that supplement the desired action, or have another action. As noted above, a composition can comprise additional (e.g., a fourth, fifth, sixth, etc.) addition active compounds. In one embodiment of the present invention, the composition comprises three or more active agents wherein at least one active agent is in immediate release form. In this embodiment the immediate-release form is included in an amount that is effective to shorten the time to its maximum concentration in the blood. By way of example, certain immediate-release pharmaceutical preparations are taught in United States Patent Publication US 2005/0147710A1 entitled, “Powder Compaction and Enrobing” which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference. In a further embodiment of the present invention, the component in immediate-release form is a component that reduces abates or eliminates and/or suppresses a adverse effect associated with one or more opioid analgesics. For example, the immediate-release active can be an antihistamine or antiemetic, which reduces, abates or eliminates an adverse effect associated with opioid and/or non-opioid analgesics described herein. Thus, in one embodiment, of the invention, the analgesic formulation comprises an opioid and non-opioid analgesic (e.g., hydrocodone or oxycodone and acetaminophen, respectively) and an antihistamine (e.g., promethazine). In a further embodiment of the present invention, all or less than all of the total amount of the antiemetic or antihistamine agent is formulated in immediate-release form, as described herein. A variety of known methods and materials may be used to bring about the immediate release. For instance, placement of the agent along an exterior of a tablet (e.g., coating the exterior or formulating the outer layer with the agent) and/or combined with forming a tablet by compressing the powder using low compaction can produce immediate-release of the agent from the composition. In a specific embodiment, an effective amount of the promethazine in immediate-release form may be coated onto a substrate. For example, where the extended release of one or more analgesics from a formulation is due to a controlled-release coating, an immediate-release layer comprising promethazine can overcoat the controlled-release coating. On the other hand, the immediate-release layer of promethazine can be coated onto the surface of a substrate wherein hydrocodone and/or oxycodone is incorporated in a controlled release matrix. Where a plurality of controlled-release substrates comprising an effective unit dose of an analgesic (e.g., multiparticulate systems including pellets, spheres, beads and the like) are incorporated into a hard gelatin capsule, the side-effect-reducing compound can be incorporated into the gelatin capsule via inclusion of an amount of immediate-release promethazine as a powder or granulate within the capsule. Alternatively, the gelatin capsule itself can be coated with an immediate-release layer of promethazine. One skilled in the art recognizes still other alternative means of incorporating the immediate release side-effect-reducing compound into the unit dose. By including an effective amount of immediate-release side-effect-reducing compound such as promethazine in the unit dose, the experience of adverse effects including nausea, vomiting, other gastric upsets, skin rashes, allergic reactions such as swelling, difficulty breathing, closing of throat, abdominal pain, unusual bleeding or bruising and skin rashes in subjects can be significantly reduced. In one embodiment of the present invention, the composition comprises three or more active agents wherein at least one active agent is in controlled-release form. The controlled-release form can be in an amount that is effective to protect the agent from rapid elimination from the body. Certain preparations relating to the controlled release of a pharmaceutical are taught in United States Patent Publication US 2005/0147710A1 entitled, “Powder Compaction and Enrobing” which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference. In a further embodiment of the present invention, the agent in controlled-release form is an opioid analgesics such as, for example, hydrocodone, or oxycodone. In one embodiment of the invention, compositions comprise one or more carriers that protect the agents against rapid elimination from the body, such as time-release formulations or coatings. Such carriers include controlled-release formulations, including, for example, microencapsulated delivery systems. The active agents can be included in the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier in amounts sufficient to treat a subject's pain, with reduced adverse effects. In certain embodiments the compositions are in oral-dosage form and comprise a matrix that includes, for example, a controlled-release material and an analgesic such as hydrocodone or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. In certain embodiments, the matrix is compressible into a tablet and can be optionally overcoated with a coating that can control the release of the analgesics including hydrocodone or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof from the composition. In this embodiment blood levels of analgesics are maintained within a therapeutic range over an extended period of time. In certain alternate embodiments, the matrix is encapsulated. Tablets or capsules containing a composition of the present invention can be coated or otherwise compounded to provide a dosage form affording the advantage of prolonged action. For example, the tablet or capsule can contain an inner dosage and an outer dosage component, the latter being in the form of an envelope over the former. The two components can be separated by an enteric layer that serves to resist disintegration in the stomach and permit the inner component to pass intact into the duodenum or to be delayed in release. For controlled extended release, the capsule can also have micro drilled holes. A coating comprising a side-effect-reducing compound such as promethazine, in immediate release form, can be added to the outside of a controlled-release tablet core to produce a final dosage form. Such a coating can be prepared by admixing a compound like promethazine with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) 29/32 or hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) and water/isopropyl alcohol and triethyl acetate. Such an immediate-release coating can be spray coated onto the tablet cores. The immediate-release coating can also be applied using a press-coating process with a blend consisting of 80% by weight promethazine and 20% by weight of lactose and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose type 2910. Press-coating techniques are known in the art and are described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,372,254 to Ting et al., incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The immediate-release or controlled-release dosage forms of the present invention can also take the form of a bi-layered tablet, which comprises a first layer and a second layer. The first layer comprises a first drug selected from analgesics, antitussives, antihistamines, antiemetics. The second layer comprises a second drug selected from analgesics, antitussives, antihistamines, antiemetics. The second drug is the same as or different from the first drug. The bi-layered tablet can provide a plasma concentration within the therapeutic range of the second drug over a period which is coextensive with at least about 70% of the period (e.g., 12 hours) within which the bi-layered tablet provides a plasma concentration within the therapeutic range of the first drug. In a further aspect of the bi-layered tablet, the first layer is an immediate release layer and/or the second layer is a controlled-release layer. In one aspect of the bi-layered tablet of the present invention, both layers can comprise an opioid analgesic such as hydrocodone or oxycodone; a non-opioid analgesic such as acetaminophen; and a compound, such as promethazine, to reduce or suppress adverse effects.
