ANIMAL EAR TAG FIELD OF INVENTION This invention relates to animal ear tags. More particularly it relates to a component for an animal ear tag, to an animal ear tag and to an animal information arrangement. BACKGROUND OF INVENTION Animal ear tags are well known and typically comprise two components, namely, a first component which comprises a base from which a male member protrudes and a second component including a boss within which a portion of the male member is receivable. The male member typically includes a stem which protrudes from the base and a head on the free end of the stem. The head has a maximum diameter which is greater than that of the stem and tapers into a point. The tag is typically secured to the animal by positioning the two components on opposite sides of an animal's ear and forcing them towards one another such that the head of the male member penetrates the ear of the animal and the hole in the boss thereby connecting the components together. The second component typically includes a tab which protrudes from the boss. The tab is typically planar and provides a surface on which information about the animal can be written. A problem with this arrangement is that there is limited space on the tab on which to write information. This is particularly the case with tags which are intended for use with relatively small animals such as sheep. One attempt to address this has been to incorporate an RF ID tag into the ear tag. Although this allows a great deal more information to be contained on the tag, the information is not readily visible and requires specialized and relatively expensive equipment in order to input and/or read information from the tag. It is an object of this invention to provide means which the Inventor believes will at least alleviate this problem. According to one aspect of the invention there is provided a component for an animal ear tag which component includes: a body; a connecting formation attached to the body with which a complementary connecting formation of a complementary component is engageable in order to secure an ear tag comprising the two components to the ear of an animal; and at least one indicating element mounting formation whereby a visual indicating element is disconnectably connectable to the body. The component for the animal ear tag may include a boss having a hole therein through which a tapered head of a complementary component is receivable, the body including a tab on which the mounting formation is provided. The component for the animal ear tag may include a plurality of indicating element mounting formations whereby a plurality of visual indicating elements are disconnectably connectable to the body. The or each indicating element mounting formation may include a hole extending through the tab. According to another aspect of the invention, there is provided an animal ear tag which includes a first component defining a female connecting formation; a second component defining a complementary male connecting formation which can be inserted through a hole in an animal's ear into engagement with the first component in order to secure the ear tag to the animal; and at least one indicating element mounting formation configured such that a visual indicating element is disconnectably connectable to one of the first component or the second component. The ear tag may include a tab which forms part of one of the first or second components in which the indicating element mounting formation is provided. The tab typically forms part of the first component. The indicating element mounting formation may be in the form of a hole extending through the tab. According to yet another aspect of the invention there is provided an animal information arrangement which includes an animal ear tag which is mountable on an ear of an animal; and at least one visual indicating element which is mountable on the ear tag. The ear tag and the visual indicating element may include complementary mounting formations whereby the visual indicating element is mountable on the ear tag. The complementary mounting formations may be configured such that the visual indicating element is dismountably mountable on the ear tag. The arrangement may include a plurality of visual indicating elements. The appearance of at least one of the visual indicating elements may be different from the appearance of the other visual indicating elements. Preferably each visual indicating element may have an appearance which differs from the appearance of each of the other visual indicating elements. The visual indicating elements may each be of a different colour to the other visual indicating elements. Each visual indicating element may be of a different shape to the other visual indicating element The ear tag may be an ear tag of the type described above and the or each mounting formation on the tag may be in the form of a hole. The or each visual indicating element may include a stem which is receivable in the hole and a pair of retaining members provided respectively at opposite ends of the stem in order to retain the visual indicating element in position on the ear tag. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF AN EXAMPLE EMBODIMENT The invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying diagrammatic drawings. In the drawings, Figure 1 shows a three-dimensional view of an animal information arrangement in accordance with the invention; Figure 2 shows a sectional view through part of the animal information arrangement of Figure 1 taken at II II in Figure 1 ; Figure 3 shows longitudinal sectional view of part of the animal information arrangement; and Figure 4 shows a three-dimensional view of part of another animal information arrangement in accordance with the invention. In Figures 1 to 3 of the drawings, reference numeral 10 refers generally to an animal information arrangement in accordance with the invention. The animal information arrangement 10 includes an animal ear tag, generally indicated by a reference numeral 12, and at least one visual indicating element, generally indicated by reference numeral 14. In the embodiment shown, in Figures 1 and 3 of the drawings, three visual indicating elements 14 are provided. The ear tag 12 includes a first component, generally indicated by reference numeral 16 and a second component generally indicated by reference numeral 18. The second component 18 includes a circular base 20 from which a centrally disposed elongate stem 22 protrudes. A head 24 is provided on the free end of the stem 22 and tapers into a point 26. The first component 16 includes a connecting formation in the form of a boss, generally indicated by reference numeral 28, having a hole 30 therein. The head 24 has a maximum lateral dimension or diameter which is greater than the greatest lateral dimension or diameter of the hole 30 such that the head 24 can be inserted through the hole 30 and is retained in position as described in more detail here below. The ear tag 12 includes a generally planar tab 32 to which the first component 16 is connected, a plurality of mounting formations in the form of holes 34 are provided at spaced-apart positions in the tab 32. In the embodiment shown, six holes are provided, however, it will be appreciated that more or fewer holes may be provided depending upon the intended application. Each visual indicating element 14 includes an elongate stem 36 having retaining members in the form of domed heads 38, 40, provided at opposed ends thereof. The stem 36 has a diameter which corresponds with that of the hole 34. The head 38 has a diameter which is slightly larger than the stem and hence the hole 34 and the head 40 has a diameter which is larger than that of the head 38. This enables the head 38 to be inserted through one of the holes 30 and for the visual indicating element 14 then to be held captive on the tab 32, with the heads 38, 40 positioned on opposite sides thereof. The animal information arrangement 10 will typically include a number of the visual indicating elements which number corresponds with the number of holes 34. Typically, each visual indicating element will have an appearance which is different to each of the other visual indicating elements, e.g. by being a different colour. In order to make use of the animal information arrangement, the animal ear tag 12 is mounted to an animal's ear 42 (Figure 3) in a conventional fashion. This is usually achieved by positioning the first component 16 and second component 18 on opposite sides of the animal's ear 42 and, by making use of a suitable tool, urging the first component 16 and second component 18 towards one another such that the head 24 penetrates the animal's ear 42 and enters the hole 30, thereby connecting the first component 16 and second component 18 together. The animal ear tag 12 can then be used in a conventional fashion with information being written on the tab 32. However, in order to include additional information, one or more of the visual indicating elements 14 can be mounted on the tab by forcing the head 38 through one of the holes 34. In this regard, each visual indicating element have a particular significance. For example, a blue visual indicating element may indicate that the animal has been vaccinated against a particular disease. By making use of the visual indicating elements, the animal's history and status can be clearly indicated in a manner which is readily visible from a distance. Reference is now made to Figure 4 of the drawings in which reference numeral 50 refers generally to part of another animal information arrangement and unless otherwise indicated, the same reference numerals used above are used to designate similar parts. The part of the animal information arrangement 50 corresponds to the first component 16 of the animal information arrangement 10, the only difference being that the tab 32 is substantially smaller than the tab 52 of the animal information arrangement 10 enabling the animal information arrangement 50 to be used with relatively smaller animals such as sheep. Further, as can best be seen in Figure 4 of the drawings, instead of making use of a visual indicating element 14 having a domed head 40 which is distinguishable from other visual indicating elements 14 by means of the colour of the head 40, use could be made of visual indicating elements which are of a different shape. Accordingly, in Figure 4, use is made of a visual indicating element 60 having a conical head 40 and a visual indicating element 62 having a pyramid-shaped head 40. Naturally, these visual indicating elements could also be of the same or different colours. The inventor believes that an animal information arrangement 10, 50 in accordance with the invention will considerably improve the versatility of and the information which can be contained on an animal ear tag of a conventional structure in a manner which is readily visible and does not require specialised equipment to read. 1 .
