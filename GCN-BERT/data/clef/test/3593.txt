Topical compositions The present invention relates to a topical composition comprising glycerin, microcrystalline cellulose and/ or microcrystalline wax and silica beads having a particle size Dv0 of greater 0.3 μηι, a Dv100 of less than 35 μηι, a Dv50 selected in the range of 9 to 15 μηι and an oil absorption capacity selected in the range of 1 .2-2.5 cc/g. Furthermore the invention relates to the use of such beads in combination with microcrystalline cellulose and/ or microcrystalline wax to ameliorate the short and long-term sensory properties of a topical composition comprising glycerin. Glycerin is a humectant that is commonly added to cosmetic compositions such as sun care products. However, incorporated into topical compositions, glycerin can impart a very sticky feeling in particular when used in higher amounts. This drawback is even more pronounced in sun-care products (sunscreens) which due to the presence of oil soluble UV-filters already tend to be sticky. Thus, there is an ongoing need for substances which reduce the stickiness of glycerin in topical compositions such as in particular in sun care products comprising oil soluble UV- filter(s) and thus contribute to an overall improved skin feel. Surprisingly it has been found that the addition of specific silica beads in combination with microcrystalline cellulose and/ or microcrystalline wax to a topical composition comprising glycerin significantly reduced the stickiness of such compositions. Furthermore, the topical compositions exhibited a significantly enhanced absorbency and a superior dry touch. Thus, the present invention relates to a topical composition comprising glycerin, microcrystalline cellulose and/ or microcrystalline wax and silica beads having a particle size Dv0 of greater 0.3 μηι, a Dv100 of less than 35 μηι, a Dv50 selected in the range of 9 to 15 μηι and an oil absorption capacity selected in the range of 1 .2-2.5 cc/g. Another subject matter of the invention is directed to a method reducing the stickiness of a topical composition comprising glycerin, said method comprising the step of adding to the topical composition silica beads having a particle size Dv0 of greater than 0.3 μηι, a Dv100 of less than 35 μηι, a Dv50 selected in the range of 9 to 15 μηι and an oil absorption capacity selected in the range of 1 .2-2.5 cc/g in combination with microcrystalline cellulose and/ or microcrystalline wax and appreciating the effect. In a further embodiment the invention relates to the use of silica beads having a particle size Dv0 of greater than 0.3 μηι, a Dv100 of less than 35 μηι, a Dv50 selected in the range of 9 to 15 μηι and an oil absorption capacity selected in the range of 1 .2-2.5 cc/g in combination with microcrystalline cellulose and/ or microcrystalline wax to reduce the stickiness of a topical composition comprising glycerin. In an additional embodiment the invention relates to the use of silica beads having a particle size Dv0 of greater than 0.3 μηι, a Dv100 of less than 35 μηι, a Dv50 selected in the range of 9 to 15 and an oil absorption capacity selected in the range of 1 .2-2.5 cc/g in combination with microcrystalline cellulose and/ or microcrystalline wax to enhance dry touch feel of a topical composition comprising glycerin. Another subject matter of the invention is directed to a method reducing the stickiness and/ or to enhance the absorbency of a topical composition comprising glycerin and silica beads having a particle size Dv0 of greater than 0.3 μηι, a Dv100 of less than 35 μηι, a Dv50 selected in the range of 9 to 15 μηι and an oil absorption capacity selected in the range of 1 .2-2.5 cc/g said method comprising the step of adding to the topical composition microcrystalline cellulose and/ or microcrystalline wax and appreciating the effect. In another embodiment the invention relates to the use of microcrystalline cellulose and/ or microcrystalline wax to reduce the stickiness and/ or to enhance the absorbency of a topical composition comprising glycerin and silica beads having a particle size Dv0 of greater than 0.3 μηι, a Dv100 of less than 35 μηι, and a Dv50 selected in the range of 9 to 15 μηι and an oil absorption capacity selected in the range of 1 .2-2.5 cc/g. In all embodiments of the present invention, the amount of the silica beads is preferably selected in the range of 0.5 to 10 wt.-%, more preferably in the range of 1 to 5 wt.-%, and most preferably in the range of 2 to 4 wt.-% based on the total weight of the composition.

It is furthermore preferred that either microcrystalline cellulose alone (i.e. in the absence of microcrystalline wax ) or microcrystalline cellulose in combination with microcrystalline wax is used in the topical compositions according to the present invention. Most preferably in all embodiments of the present invention microcrystalline cellulose is used in the absence of microcrystalline wax in the topical compositions as this results in the best performance in view of reduced stickiness and improved absorbency. In all embodiments of the present invention, the amount of glycerin is preferably selected in the range of 1 to 20 wt.-%, more preferably in the range of 3 to 15 wt.-%, and most preferably in the range of 5 to 10 wt.-% based on the total weight of the composition. The porous silica beads used according to the present invention may be prepared from sodium silicate by emulsion polymerization according to standard procedures such as e.g. via the sol-gel method.

Most preferably the silica beads are either uncoated or coated with dimethicone. In a preferred embodiment the silica beads used according to the present invention are uncoated. The particle size of the beads according to the invention (in volume %) is determined by a Coulter LS13320 or Malvern Mastersizer 2000 according to standard methods in the art. In number % the average particle size Dn50 ranges from 9 to 15 μηι. In all embodiments of the present invention the oil absorption capacity of the silica beads is preferably selected in the range of 1 .2 to 2.0 cc/g and most preferably in the range of 1 .3 to 1 .8 cc/g. The oil absorption capacity refers to the weight of a specific oil absorbed by a material, determined by a specified method. It includes the oil absorption capacity of the dry particles existing between the inherent voids within and on the surface of the particles. The oil absorption capacity as referred to in the present invention is determined at 23°C by weighting 2g of the respective silica beads into a 20 ml beaker glass. Then liquid paraffin (Paraffinum Perliquidum PH. EUR. CAS 8042-47-5) is added. After addition of 4 to 5 drops of paraffin to the powder, mixing is performed using a spatula, and addition of paraffin is continued until conglomerates of oil and powder have formed. From this point, the paraffin is added one drop at a time and the mixture is then triturated with the spatula. The addition of oil is stopped when the loose and dry powder completely disappears and a highly viscous white to transparent homogeneous gel is obtained. The oil absorption capacity (cc/g) is then calculated by the volume of paraffin used (in cc) per g of silica beads. Particularly suitable porous silica beads according to the present invention are e.g. obtainable as VALVANCE™ Touch 210 at DSM Nutritional Products Ltd Kaiseraugst.

During this rub-out phase the rotations are counted until the product starts to absorb into skin. The amount of rotations gives a clear number how long a cosmetic product needs to absorb. The absorbency is scaled on a scale from 0 to 100 in comparison to trained standards. The smaller the value the faster absorbs the product. After the rub-out phase the stickiness is assessed relative to a set of standards. The stickiness is scaled on a scale from 0 to 100 in comparison to trained standards. Data are median values. The stickiness values are assessed after 20 min. As can be retrieved from table 4, the addition of microcrystalline wax, respectively microcrystalline cellulose leads to a significantly reduction in the stickiness after 20 min compared to the base and to the reference comprising the silica beads. Furthermore, the absorbency is also significantly improved by the addition of microcrystalline wax, respectively microcrystalline cellulose. In addition, all samples according to the invention exhibit an improved dry touch compared to the base as well as to the reference.
