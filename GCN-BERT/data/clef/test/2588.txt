Example 7 5-Methoxypyrazine-2-carboxylic acid A 185 ml stirred autoclave was charged under argon with PdCl2(dppp) (508 mg, 0.844 mmol), 2-bromo-5-methoxypyrazine (8.40 g, 42.2 mmol), tert-butanol (35 ml), deionized water (45 ml) and triethylamine (10.7 g, 0.106 mol, 2.5 molar equivalents). The reaction vessel was closed, purged three times with carbon monoxide (15 bar) and finally charged with carbon monoxide to 10 bar. The mixture was stirred vigorously at 60°C under constant pressure for 48 h; after this time no more carbon monoxide absorption was observed. The reaction mixture was concentrated on a rotary evaporator under simultaneous addition of water in order to remove the volatile organic components. The resulting aqueous phase was extracted twice with dichloromethane. After filtration, the pH of the solution was reduced under stirring to ca. 1 by dropwise addition of hydrochloric acid. The resulting suspension was stored at 4°C over night and then filtered. The filter cake was rinsed with water and dried in vacuo to constant weight to afford 5-methoxypyrazine-2-carboxylic acid (5.9 g) as a white solid, MS: m/z = 155.2 [M+H], Example 8 5-Cyano-pyridine-2-carboxylic acid [3-((S)-2-amino-4-methyl-5,6-dihydro-4//-[l,3]oxazin-4- yl)-4-fluoro-phenyl]-amide Condensation of 5-cyano-pyridine-2-carboxylic acid (example 1) with [(S)-4-(5-amino-2-fluoro-phenyl)-4-methyl-5,6-dihydro-47/-[ 1,3 ]oxazin-2-yl ]-carbamic acid /er/-hutyl ester (see 2).
