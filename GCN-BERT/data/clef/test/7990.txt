Synthesis of (S)-3-chloro-N-(2-hydroxy-1-[3-{4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenyl}-1,2,4-oxadiazol-5-yl]ethyl)benzenesulfonamide (Compound 91)
(91-1) Synthesis of N-{2-[(tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy]-1-{3-[4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenyl]-1,2,4-oxadiazol-5-yl}ethyl}-3-chlorobenzene-1-sulfonamide (Compound 91-1)
Triethylamine (250 Âµl, 1.8 mmol) and 3-chlorobenzene-1-sulfonyl chloride (245 mg, 1.17 mmol) were added to a solution of 5-{1-amino-2-[(tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy]ethyl}-3-[4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenyl]-1,2,4-oxadiazole (314 mg, 0.78 mmol) in dichloromethane (8 mL), and the mixture was stirred overnight at room temperature. After addition of saturated aqueous ammonium chloride solution to stop the reaction, water was added and the whole was extracted with dichloromethane. The combined extract was dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The solvent was evaporated off under reduced pressure, and the obtained residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (hexane-ethyl acetate) to obtain the title compound 114 mg (yield 25%).
