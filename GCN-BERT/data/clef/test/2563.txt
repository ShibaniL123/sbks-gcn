DUAL SPECIFIC BINDING PROTEINS DIRECTED AGAINST 11_ -1 β and/or S L -1 7 [001] This application claims priority to U.S, Provisional Application Serial No. 61/799,700. filed March 15, 2013, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. [002] Multivalent and multispecific binding proteins that bind 1L-1 β and/or IL-17, methods of making, and their uses in the diagnosis, prevention, and/or treatment of acute and chronic inflammatory diseases, cancer, and other diseases are provided. [003] Engineered proteins, such as multispecific binding proteins capable of binding two or more antigens, are known in the art. Such multispecific binding proteins can be generated using ceil fusion, chemical conjugation, or recombinant DNA techniques. There are a variety of multispecific binding protein structures known in the art and many structures and methods have distinct disadvantages. [004] Bispecific antibodies have been produced using quadroma technology. However, the presence of mis-paired by-products and significantly reduced production yields with this technology means that sophisticated purification procedures are required. Bispecific antibodies can also be produced by chemical conjugation of two different mAbs. However, this approach does not yield homogeneous preparations. [005] Other approaches used previously include coupling of two parental antibodies with a hetero-bifunctional crosslinker, production of tandem single-chain Fv moieeules, diabodies, bispecific diabodies, single-chain diabodies, and di-diabodies. However, each of these approaches has disadvantages. In addition, a multivalent antibody construct comprising two Fab repeats in the heavy chain of an IgG and capable of binding four antigen molecules has been described (see PCI Publication No. WO 0177342 and Miller et al. (2003) J. Immunol, 170(9): 4854-61). [006] US Patent No. 7,612,181 (incorporated herein by reference in its entirety) provides a novel family of binding proteins capable of binding two or more antigens with high affinity, which are called dual variable domain binding proteins (DVD-lg binding protein) or dual variable domain immunoglobulins (DVD-lg!M). DVD!g molecules are binding proteins that may be used to bind two distinct epitopes on the same molecule or two different molecules simultaneously. DVD-lg molecules are unique binding proteins comprised of two variable domains fused to N-terminal constant regions. The variable domains may be directly fused to one another or connected via synthetic peptide linkers of assorted iength and amino acid composition. DVD-lg binding proteins may be engineered with intact and functional Fc domains, allowing them to mediate appropriate effector functions. The DVD-lg format, due to its flexibility of choice of variable domain pair, orientation of two antigen-binding domains, and the length of the linker that joins them, may provide novel therapeutic modalities. [007] While a variety of structures are provided in the art, some with advantages and disadvantages, specific constructs are required for preparing multivalent binding proteins with specific properties and which bind to specific targets. Additionally, new variable domain sequences can further improve the properties of binding proteins. For example, there remains a need for constructs exhibiting better targeting and/or desired efficiency of binding to !L-1beta and/or IL-17, e.g., to prevent, diagnose, and/or treat autoimmune, inflammatory, or neurological disorders. There is thus a need in the art for improved multivalent binding proteins capable of binding flip and/or IL-17, and/or improved multivalent binding proteins capable of neutralizing IL-1 β and/or IL-17. [008] Accordingly, disclosed herein are dual variable domain immunoglobulins using the binding protein framework disclosed in US Patent No. 7,612.181 (incorporated herein by reference in its entirety) and containing particular first and second polypeptide chains, each comprising first and second variable domains comprising sequences (e.g., sequences selected from those listed in Table 1) that form functional binding sites for binding targets such as IL-1 beta and/or IL-17. In some embodiments, the first and second polypeptide chains of the binding protein each independently comprise VD1-(X1)n-VD2-C-X2, wherein: VD1 is a first variable domain; VD2 is a second variable domain; C is a constant domain; Χ1 is a linker; Χ2 is an Fc region that is either present or absent; η is 0 or 1, and wherein the VD1 domains on the first and second polypeptide chains form a first functional target binding site for IL-1 β or IL-17 and the VD2 domains on the first and second polypeptide chains form a second functional target binding site for IL-1 β or IL-17. In some embodiments, an Fc domain is present on one polypeptide chain and absent on the other, or absent on both polypeptide chains. In some embodiments, the sequences of the first and second variable domains on each polypeptide chain (i.e., VD1 and VD2) are selected from the sequences in Table 1 to form functional binding sites, in some embodiments, the sequences of the first and second variable domains each contain the three CDRs (i.e., CDRs 1-3) from the selected sequences listed in Table 1 and are arranged in the same order as shown in Table 1, thereby forming functional binding sites (i.e., the binding domains are capable of binding to their target antigen, ΐℓ-1β or IL-17). In some embodiments, the paired variable domain sequences on the first and second polypeptide chains (i.e,, the VD1 sequence on the first chain paired with the VD1 sequence on the second chain and the VD2 sequence on the first chain paired with the VD2 sequence on the second chain) form functional binding sites for binding targets IL-1 beta and/or IL-17. In some embodiments, the binding proteins are capable of binding to IL-1beta and/or IL-17 with improved binding affinity and/or neutralization potency. Brief Description of the Drawings [009] Figure 1 is a schematic representation of Dual Variable Domain (DVD) binding protein constructs. Detailed Description [010] The IL-1 superfamily is comprised of mediators of inflammatory processes having a wide range of biological and physiological effects, including fever, prostaglandin synthesis (in, e.g., fibroblasts, muscle cells and endothelial ceils), Τiymphocyte activation, and interleukin~2 production. The original members of the IL-1 superfamiiy are IL-1 α, ΐℓ-1β, and the IL-1 Receptor Antagonist (IL-1 Ra, IL-1 RA, IL-1 ra, IL-1 Ra). IL-1 a and IL-P are pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in immune defense against infection. Both IL-1 α and IL-1 β are produced by macrophages, monocytes, and dendritic cells. These cytokines increase the expression of adhesion factors on endothelial cells to enable transmigration of leukocytes to sites of infection and re-set the hypothalamus thermoregulatory center, leading to an increased body temperature which expresses itself as fever. IL-1 is therefore often referred to as an endogenous pyrogen. IL-1 is also important in the regulation of hematopoiesis. IL-1 β production in peripheral tissue has also been associated with hyperalgesia (increased sensitivity to pain) associated with fever (Morgan et al. (2004) Brain Res. 1022(1-2):9δ-1ϋ0). IL-1 upregulates expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) associated with pain. IL-1 α and IL-1 β also possess similar biological properties, including induction of fever, slow wave sleep, and neutrophilia, Τ- and B-lymphocyte activation, fibroblast proliferation, cytotoxicity for certain cells, induction of collagenases, synthesis of hepatic acute phase proteins, and increased production of colony stimulating factors and collagen, [011] Interleukin-17 (IL-17, also referred to as IL-17A) is a 20-30 kD homodimeric glycoprotein secreted by activated Τ ceils at the site of inflammation. IL-17 acts as a proinflammatory cytokine by inducing the production of multiple adhesion molecules, inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in various tissues to recruit monocytes and neutrophils to the site of inflammation, IL-17 also plays an important role in the maturation of hematopoietic progenitor cells. Inappropriate or excessive production of IL-17 is associated with the pathology of various diseases or disorders including rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, lupus, allograft rejection, other inflammatory or autoimmune diseases and cancer. [012] Disclosed herein are improved binding proteins against IL-1 β and/or IL-17. [013] In some embodiments, a binding protein is disclosed comprising first and second polypeptide chains, each independently comprising VD1-(X1)n-VD2-C-Χ2, wherein: VD1 is a first variable domain; VD2 is a second variable domain; C is a constant domain; Χ1 is a linker; Χ2 is an Fc region that is either present or absent; η is independently 0 or 1 on the first and second chains, and wherein the VD1 domains on the first and second polypeptide chains form a first functional target binding site and the VD2 domains on the first and second polypeptide chains form a second functional target binding site. In some embodiments, the binding protein is capable of binding IL-1 β and/or IL-17. In some embodiments, the binding protein comprises VD1 sequences on the first and second polypeptide chains (i.e., a VD1 sequence on the first chain paired with a VD1 sequence on the second chain) that together form a binding domain capable of binding a target selected from IL-1 β and IL-17. In some embodiments, the binding protein is capable of binding IL-1 β at both the VD1 and VD2 positions. In some embodiments, the binding protein is capable of binding IL-17 at both the VD1 and VD2 positions. In some embodiments, the binding protein is capable of binding ΐυ-1β at the VD1 position and IL-17 at the VD2 position. In some embodiments, the binding protein is capable of binding IL-17 at the VD1 position and IL-1 β at the VD2 position. [014] The binding proteins disclosed herein comprise VD1 and VD2 binding domains that are capable of binding to first and second target antigens. As used herein, a VD1 domain or a VD2 domain, or a VD1 position or VD2 position, may refer to either the variable domain sequence on one polypeptide chain (e.g., a VD1 heavy chain sequence) or to the variable domain sequences on both the first and second polypeptide chain (e.g., a VD1 heavy chain sequence and a VD1 light chain sequence) that together form the functional binding site. [015] In some embodiments, the VD1 sequences that form the VD1 binding site are selected from the paired sequences in Table 1 (for example, the paired sequences of SEQ ID NO: 32 and 33 in Table 1 that together form a binding site for ΐℓ-1β). in some embodiments, the VD2 sequences that form the VD2 binding site are selected from the paired sequences in Table 1 (for example, the paired sequences of SEQ ID NO: 32 and 33 in Table 1 that together form a binding site for ΐℓ-1β). In some embodiments, the VD1 and/or VD2 sequences comprise CDRs 1-3 of the sequences selected from Table 1 but have different variable domain framework sequences (e.g., variable domains that are CDR grafted, affinity matured, humanized, humanized and backmutated, or other functional variants of the sequences disclosed in Table 1).

For SEQ ID NO: 38, the CDR1 sequence can be found at amino add positions 31-35, the CDR2 sequence can be found at amino acid positions 50-65, and the CDRS sequence can be found at amino acid positions 98-111. For SEQ ID NO: 39, the CDR1 sequence can be found at amino acid positions 24-34, the CDR2 sequence can be found at amino acid positions 50-56, and the CDR3 sequence can be found at amino acid positions 89-97. For SEQ ID NO: 40, the CDR1 sequence can be found at amino acid positions 31-35, the CDR2 sequence can be found at amino acid positions 50-65, and the CDR3 sequence can be found at amino acid positions 98-111. For SEQ ID NO: 41, the CDR1 sequence can be found at amino acid positions 24-34, the CDR2 sequence can be found at amino acid positions 50-56, and the CDR3 sequence can be found at amino acid positions 89-97.

[017] When the binding protein comprises the CDRs from a sequence selected from Table 1, the CDRs are arranged in the order specified by the sequence in Table 1 and separated by suitable framework sequences to form a functional binding site. The paired sequences selected from Table 1 that form a functional binding site for a target (i.e., a binding site for ΐℓ-1β or IL-17), or the CDRs from those sequences, may be placed in either the VD1 or VD2 positions on the first and second polypeptide chains to form a binding site at either the VD1 or VD2 domain. For instance, matching heavy and light chain variable domain sequences from Table 1 that form a binding site for ΐℓ-1β (e.g., SEQ ID NO: 34 and 35) can be placed in the VD1 positions on the first and second polypeptide chains to form a VD1 binding site for ΐℓ-1β. In another example, the matching heavy and light chain sequences from Table 1 that form a binding site for IL-1 β (e.g., SEQ ID NO: 34 and 35} can be placed in the VD2 positions on the first and second polypeptide chains to form a VD2 binding site for !L~1 β. The same or different sequences may occupy both the VD1 and VD2 positions. For example, SEQ ID NO: 34 and 35 may be used to form a binding domain at the VD1 position and at the VD2 position, or SEQ ID NO: 34 and 35 may form the binding domain at one of the VD1 and VD2 positions, while a different sequence pair can be selected to form the binding domain at the other position. Similarly, any of the other sequence pairs in Table 1 may be selected for use in either or both of the VD1 and VD2 positions on the first and second polypeptide chains. [018] In some embodiments, the variable domain sequences on the first and second polypeptide chains that form a functional target binding site for iL-1 β in a binding protein (i.e., at the VD1 and/or VD2 positions) can comprise the paired variable domain sequences selected from those in Table 1 or CDRs 1-3 from those sequences. For instance, the variable domains that form a functional target binding site for ΐℓ-1β can comprise SEQ ID NO: 32 and SEQ ID NO: 33, SEQ ID NO: 34 and SEQ ID NO: 35, SEQ ID NO; 36 and SEQ ID NO: 37, SEQ ID NO: 38 and SEQ ID NO: 39, or SEQ ID NO: 40 and SEQ ID NO: 41, or CDRs 1-3 from those paired variable domain sequences. For example, the variable domains that form a functional target binding site for IL-1 β can comprise CDRs 1-3 from SEQ ID NO: 32 (i.e., amino acids 31-35, 50-68, and 99-108 from that sequence) on one polypeptide chain paired with CDRs 1-3 from SEQ ID NO: 33 (i.e., amino acids 24-34, 50-56, and 89-97 from that sequence) on the other chain. [019] In some embodiments, the variable domain sequences on the first and second polypeptide chains that form a functional target binding site for IL-17 in a binding protein (i.e., at the VD1 or VD2 positions) can comprise paired heavy and light chain variable domain sequences selected from those in Table 1, or CDRs 1-3 from those selected sequences. For instance, the variable domains that form a functional target binding site for IL-17 can comprise SEQ ID NO: 42 and SEQ ID NO: 43, SEQ ID NO: 44 and SEQ ID NO: 45, or SEQ ID NO: 46 and SEQ ID NO: 47, or CDRs 1-3 from those selected variable domain sequences. For example, the variable domains that form a functional target binding site for IL-17 can comprise CDRs 1-3 from SEQ ID NO: 42 (i.e., amino acids 31-35, 50-66, and 99-110 from that sequence) on one polypeptide chain paired with CDRs 1-3 from SEQ ID NO: 43 (i.e., amino acids 24-34, 50-56, and 89-97 from that sequence) on the other chain. [020] In certain embodiments, a binding protein is disclosed, wherein the variable domains that form a functional target binding site for IL-1beta (i.e., at the VD1 or VD2 position) comprise CDRs 1-3 from SEQ ID NO: 34 and CDRs 1-3 from SEQ ID NO: 35 (i.e,, CDRs 1-3 from SEQ ID NO: 34 present on one polypeptide chain at the VD1 or VD2 position and paired with CDRs 1-3 from SEQ ID NO: 35 on the other chain at the same position, with the CDRs on each chain arranged in the specified order and separated by suitable framework sequences to form a functional binding site), in an embodiment, the variable domains that form a functional target binding site for IL-17 comprise CDRs 1-3 from SEQ ID NO: 44 and CDRs 1-3 from SEQ ID NO: 45 (i.e., CDRs 1-3 from SEQ ID NO: 44 present on one polypeptide chain at the VD1 or VD2 position and paired with CDRs 1-3 from SEQ ID NO: 45 on the other chain at the same position, with the CDRs on each chain arranged in the specified order and separated by suitable framework sequences to form a functional binding site).

[035] In some embodiments, a binding protein as described above comprises an Χ1 linker on each of the first and second polypeptide chain and an Χ2 Fc region on one of the two chains. The Χ1 linkers are independently present or absent on each chain (i.e., η is independently chosen from 0 or 1 on each chain). The Χ1 linkers on the first and second polypeptide chains, if present, can have the same or different sequences. In one embodiment, the Χ1 on the first and second polypeptide chains are short (“S”) (e.g., 6 amino add or shorter) linkers, In another embodiment, the Χ1 on the first and second polypeptide chains are long (“L”) (e.g., greater than 6 amino acid) linkers.

In some embodiments, Χ1 on the first and/or second polypeptide chain of a binding protein is not a complete CH1 or CL domain, but may comprise portions of those domains. In some embodiments, Χ1 on the first chain is not CH1, and Χ1 on the second chain is not CL, or Χ1 on the first chain is not CL and Χ1 on the second chain is not CH1.

[036] In some embodiments, Χ2 (the Fc region) is present on the first polypeptide chain and absent on the second polypeptide chain, while in other embodiments Χ2 is present on the second chain and absent on the first chain, or Χ2 is absent on both the first and second chains. In some embodiments. Χ2 is a variant sequence Fc region. In certain embodiments, the Fc region is an Fc region from an lgG1, !gG2, SgG3, lgG4, IgA, IgM, IgE, or IgD.

In some embodiments, the binding protein comprises an Χ1 linker on the heavy and/or light polypeptide chain that is independently selected from any one of SEG ID NO: 1-31. [038] In some embodiments, any of the binding proteins described above can comprise two first polypeptide chains and two second polypeptide chains and four functional binding sites.

An example of a four chain structure having two arms, each arm comprising a first and second polypeptide chain and two functional binding sites, is shown in Figure 1. In some embodiments, the binding domains at the VD1 and VD2 positions on the first and second arms are identical.

Binding Protein Properties [058] The development and production of a binding protein for use as a human therapeutic agent, e.g., as an anti-inflammatory agent or neurological agent, may require more than the identification of a binding protein capable of binding to a desired target or targets. The binding proteins disclosed herein exhibit favorable properties in one or more of the following categories (a) the binding kinetics (on-rate, off-rate and affinity) for both the inner and outer antigen-binding domains, (b) potencies in various biochemical and cellular bioassays, (c) in vivo efficacies in relevant tumor models, (d) pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics properties, (℮) manufacturability, including protein expression level in selected ceil lines, scalability, post-translational modification, physicochemical properties such as monomer percentage, solubility, and stability (intrinsic, freeze/thaw, storage stability, etc.), (f) formulation properties, (g) potential immunogenicity risk, (h) toxicological properties, and (i) binding mode and valency. Binding mode and valency may affect binding properties and cellular potencies of a molecule. [059] The binding proteins disclosed herein exhibit favorable properties in some or each of the categories listed above, including surprisingly high binding affinity at both the VD1 and VD2 positions. In certain embodiments, a binding protein exhibiting particularly favorable properties in some or each of the categories listed above contains first and second polypeptide chains that comprise SEQ ID NO: 104 and SEQ ID NO: 105 or first and second polypeptide chains that comprise SEQ ID NO: 98 and SEQ ID NO: 99. In certain embodiments, the binding protein comprises DVD3415 or DVD3418. These binding proteins have been found to exhibit a surprisingly high binding affinity at both the VD1 and VD2 positions. See, e.g., Table 10. It has also been found, unexpectedly, that DVD3415 and DVD3418 may, in some embodiments, exhibit a superior combination of one or more properties, such as one or more of: effective binding kinetics, improved neutralization ability, enhanced in vivo efficacy, superior formulatability, a desirable glycosylation pattern, a favorable pharmacokinetic profile, and efficient expression in host cells, as compared to other binding proteins comprising different variable domains and/or linker sequences. [080] For instance, it has unexpectedly been found that many of the binding proteins disclosed herein bind their targets with an affinity roughly comparable (i.e., within the same order of magnitude) to that of both their individual parent antibodies. See, for example, the comparison of parental antibodies and binding proteins in Tables 3-8. This is surprising as loss in binding affinity may have been anticipated a priori from the use of a dual variable domain binding structure. In particular, it has been found that binding proteins comprising SEQ ID NO: 104 and SEQ ID NO: 105 or SEQ ID NO: 98 and SEQ ID NO: 99 (e.g., DVD3415 and DVD3418) exhibit superior binding affinity to both their targets, as compared to other binding proteins comprising different variable domains targeting ΐℓ-1β and IL-17, and/or different linker sequences. For instance, binding proteins comprising SEQ ID NO: 104 and SEQ ID NO: 105 or SEQ ID NO: 98 and SEQ ID NO: 99 (e.g., DVD3415 and DVD3418) bound with surprisingly high affinity to both IL-1 β and IL-17 (e.g., an affinity comparable to that of their parent antibodies), whereas other binding proteins using different variable domain sequences bound with less affinity than their parent antibodies. See, e.g., Table 6. Moreover, it has surprisingly been found that binding proteins such as DVD3415 and DVD3418 exhibit physicochemical properties that, in combination, are superior to those of other binding proteins. For instance, binding proteins DVD3415 and DVD3418, which are engineered to lack a deamidation site in their IL-17 binding domain, surprisingly exhibit a combination of properties that are superior to those of other binding proteins disclosed herein, or as compared to other DVD-lg binding proteins targeting IL-1 β and IL-17, such as DVD1274, DVD1275, DVD1601, DVD1602, DVD1631, DVD1661, and DVD1662. See, e.g., Table 13. These beneficial properties include superior host ceil expression, retained target potency for both IL-1 β and IL-17, improved solubility, improved stability and formuiatabiiity, reduced cross-reactivity to other antigens or to IL-1 β and IL-17 from non-primate species, improved in vivo efficacy, and reduced immunogenicity (including reduced immunogenicity as compared to dual administration of anti-IL-1 β and anti-IL-17 antibodies, and as compared to alternate binding proteins such as a binding protein targeting IL-17 and TNF), Both binding proteins are surprisingly stable at a high concentration (e.g,, greater than 25 mg/ml liquid formulation). Both binding proteins are also selective for primate IL-1 β and IL-17 over antigens from other species, and exhibit neutralizing properties against primate IL-1 β and IL-17. See, e.g., Table 14. [081] In some embodiments, binding proteins comprising SEQ ID NO: 104 and SEQ ID NO: 105 or SEQ ID NO: 98 and SEQ ID NO: 99 (e.g., DVD3415 and DVD3418) are capable of being concentrated, e.g., to greater than 25 mg/ml, and/or can be concentrated to a similar level as their parental antibodies. In some embodiments, binding proteins comprising SEQ ID NO: 104 and SEQ ID NO: 105 or SEQ ID NO: 98 and SEQ ID NO: 99 (e.g., DVD3415 and DVD3418) exhibit a prolonged half-life, at least a moderate plasma clearance, and/or significant homology to germline sequences (which may contribute to reduced immunogenicity), as compared to those of other binding proteins disclosed herein, or as compared to other DVD-lg binding proteins targeting IL-1 β and IL-17, such as DVD1274, DVD1275, DVD1601, DVD1602, DVD1631, DVD1661. See, e.g., Tables 11 and 13. For instance, DVD3415 and/or DVD3418 may exhibit a serum half-life of approximately 20-40 days (e.g., 20, 25, 30, 35, or 40 days, or any time period in between). In some embodiments, DVD3415 and/or DVD3418 exhibit a lower clearance rate than is observed for other DVD-lg binding proteins targeting IL-1 β and IL-17, e.g., a rate of less than 0,1 ml/hour/kg body mass, or less than 0.09, 0.08, 0.07, 0.08, 0.05 ml/hour/kg body mass (or any rate in between). [062] In some embodiments, binding proteins comprising SEQ ID NO: 104 and SEQ ID NO: 105 or SEQ ID NO: 98 and SEQ ID NO: 99 (e.g., DVD3415 and DVD3418), exhibit surprisingly favorable physicochemical characteristics, including solubility, viscosity, stability on freeze thaw, and/or lack of other significant changes during thermal stress, as compared to other binding proteins disclosed herein and/or as compared to other binding proteins targeting ΐℓ-1β and il-17. As such, DVD3415 and/or DVD3418 may be suitable for formulation in a stable high concentration liquid formulation, e.g,, a concentration greater than 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, or 50 mg/mi in a liquid formulation (or any concentration in between). See, e.g., Table 12, In some embodiments, DVD3415 nad/or DVD3418 exhibit reduced immunogenicity in vivo, as compared to dual administration of anti- ΐℓ-1β and anti-IL-17 antibodies, and/or as compared to alternate binding proteins such as a binding protein targeting IL-17 and TNF. [063] In various embodiments, binding proteins comprising SEQ ID NO: 104 and SEQ ID NO: 105 or SEQ ID NO: 98 and SEQ ID NO: 99 (e.g., DVD3415 and DVD3418) exhibit improved properties, e.g., improved safety, increased stability, greater potency, a reduced inflammatory or immune response, or other beneficial in vivo human therapeutic properties, as compared to other treatments for inflammatory, autoimmune, or neurological conditions. Treatments suitable for comparison can include, e.g,, administration of a small molecule anti-inflammatory or neurological agent, or administration of an antibody against IL-1beta alone or in combination with an antibody against IL-17, or administration of a DVD-lg binding protein comprising other variable domain sequences and forming binding sites for IL-1beta and IL-17. In some embodiments, DVD3415 and/or 3418 exhibits improved properties over a current standard of care treatment for an autoimmune, inflammatory, or neurological condition. For instance, the binding protein can exhibit improved binding kinetics, superior in vivo therapeutic efficacy, enhanced formulatability (including reduced aggregation and improved storage stability), improved pharmacokinetics, a reduced inflammatory or immune response, and/or enhanced host cel! expression levels. Preparation of Binding Proteins [064] In another aspect, the disclosure provides a method of making a binding protein that binds ΐℓ-1β and/or IL-17 is provided, in an embodiment, the method of making a binding protein that binds IL-1 β and/or IL-17 comprises the steps of a) obtaining a first parent antibody, or antigen binding portion thereof, that binds IL-1β and/or IL-17; b) obtaining a second parent antibody, or antigen binding portion thereof, that binds IL-1 β and/or IL-17; c) determining the sequences of the variable domains of the parent antibodies or antigen binding portions thereof; d) preparing construct(s) encoding any of the binding proteins described herein using those variable domain sequences; and ℮) expressing the polypeptide chains, such that a binding protein that binds IL-1 β and/or il-17 is generated.

The “parent antibody”, which provides at least one antigen binding specificity of the multivalent and or multispecific binding protein, may be one that is internalized (and/or catabolized) by a cell expressing an antigen to which the antibody binds; and/or may be an agonist, cell death-inducing, and/or apoptosis-inducing antibody, and the multivalent and or multispecific binding protein as described herein may display improvement(s) in one or more of these properties.

In some embodiments, any one of the binding proteins disclosed herein can be used to treat a disorder listed above. In certain embodiments, the binding protein used to treat any of the disorders discussed herein is one or more of DVD2424-3425. In certain embodiments, the binding protein is DVD2424, DVD2425, DVD2426, DVD2427, DVD2428, DVD2429, DVD2430, DVD3415, or DVD3418. In certain embodiments, the binding protein is DVD3415 or DVD3418. In some embodiments, effective treatment of a disorder using a binding protein (e.g., DVD3418) can be detected by measuring a reduction in expression of one or more of the serum or tissue markers iL-8, PGE-2, G-CSF, CXCL-1, CXCL-5, ΜΜΡ-3, orMMP-13. [086] In an embodiment, a binding protein disclosed herein is used to treat an inflammatory, autoimmune, and/or neurological disorder. In an embodiment, a binding protein disclosed herein is used to treat arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, axial spondyioarthristis (axSpA), ANCA vasculitis, Crohn's disease, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, psoriasis, ulcerative colitis, intestinal behcet disease, polymyaigia rheumatica, or dry eye. In an embodiment, the binding protein is used to treat arthritis. In an embodiment, the binding protein is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis. In an embodiment, the binding protein is used to treat psoriatic arthritis. In an embodiment, the binding protein is used to treat ankylosing spondylitis. In some embodiments, the binding protein is one or more of DVD2424-3425. In certain embodiments, the binding protein is DVD2424, DVD2425, DVD2426, DVD2427, DVD2428, DVD2429, DVD2430, DVD3415, or DVD3418. In an embodiment, the binding protein is DVD3415 or DVD3418. [087] In some embodiments, a binding protein (e.g., DVD3415 or DVD3418) may be used to treat rheumatoid arthritis that is resistant to anti-TNF therapy. For instance, a binding protein targeting ΐℓ-1β and IL-17 (e.g., DVD3415 or DVD3418) may persist in circulation longer than an anti-TNF antibody, thereby providing for a ionger-duration treatment effect and enabling the potential for reduced administration frequency, which in turn may reduce the risk of the administered agent inducing an immune response. While inhibition of TNF may demonstrate superior treatment benefits in animal models of arthritis than inhibition of either ΐℓ-1β or IL-17 alone, it has surprisingly been discovered that the dual inhibition of both IL-1 β and IL-17 may provide for certain improved treatment outcomes, as compared to anti-TNF monotherapy. [088] In some embodiments, a binding protein may produce a greater reduction in inflammation associated with rheumatoid arthritis than can be achieved by administering an anti-TNF antibody, or a greater reduction than is achieved by the sum of inhibition after dual administration of separate antibodies to IL-1 β and IL-17, Inflammation may be evaluated, e.g., by measuring the level of IL-6, CXCL-1, PGE-2. CXCL-5, G-CSF, or ΜΜΡ3 expression. In some embodiments, a binding protein may be used to reduce inflammation, cartilage loss, and/or bone destruction by an amount greater than can be achieved using a TNF antibody or using IL-1 β and IL-17 antibodies administered as a combination of monotherapies. For instance, a binding protein disclosed herein may demonstrate increased reduction in inflammation in a mouse coiiagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model, as compared to either an !L-1 β or -IL-17 antibody when administered alone. In some embodiments, binding protein may also surprisingly provide bone-protective effects in a TNF-independent manner. Therefore, targeting a combination of inflammatory mediators using a binding protein (e.g., DVD3415 or DVD3418) may more fully control a patient’s symptoms than could be achieved by individual monotherapies. [089] in certain embodiments, a binding protein (e.g., DVD3415 or DVD3418) can be administered to treat rheumatoid arthritis in a patient population that is resistant to treatment with anti-TNF antibodies. In certain embodiments, a binding protein (e.g., DVD3415 or DVD3418) may be administered to treat rheumatoid arthritis at a late phase of the disease that may not be responsive to anti-TNF therapy (a segment of patients with arthritis do not respond to treatment with anti-TNF agents or anti-cytokine monotherapies). In some embodiments, a binding protein (e.g., DVD3415 or DVD3418) may be used to reduce elevated levels of ΐℓ-1β and IL-17 associated with polymyalgia rheumatica without altering IFN-gamma production in ΤΗ1 cells. In some embodiments, a binding protein (e.g., DVD3418) may be used to reduce expression of ΐℓ-1β and IL-17 found in the tears of dry eye patients and associated with dry-eye related inflammation. [090] In an embodiment, the binding proteins, or antigen-binding portions thereof, are used to treat cancer or in the prevention or inhibition of metastases from the tumors described herein either when used alone or in combination with radiotherapy and/or chemotherapeutic agents.

The method comprises assaying the test sample for the antigen, or fragment thereof, by an immunoassay. The immunoassay (i) employs at least one binding protein and at least one detectable label and (is) comprises comparing a signal generated by the detectable label as a direct or indirect indication of the presence, amount or concentration of the antigen, or fragment thereof, in the test sampie to a signai generated as a direct or indirect indication of the presence, amount or concentration of the antigen, or fragment thereof, in a control or a calibrator.

Unless otherwise required by context, singular terms shall Include pluralities and plural terms shall Include the singular. The use of “or” means “and/or” unless stated otherwise. The use of the term “including”, as well as other forms, such as “includes” and “included”, is not limiting. Any range disclosed herein is intended to encompass the endpoints of that range unless stated otherwise. [0103] Generally, nomenclatures used in connection with cell and tissue culture, molecular biology, immunology, microbiology, genetics and protein and nucleic acid chemistry and hybridization described herein are those known and commonly used in the art. The methods and techniques provided herein are generally performed according to conventional methods well known in the art and as described in various general and more specific references that are cited and discussed throughout the present specification unless otherwise indicated. Enzymatic reactions and purification techniques are performed according to manufacturer’s specifications, as commonly accomplished in the art or as described herein.

Standard techniques are used for chemical syntheses, chemical analyses, pharmaceutical preparation, formulation, and delivery, and treatment of patients. [0104] That the disclosure may be more readily understood, select terms are defined below. [0105] The term “antibody” refers to an immunoglobulin (Ig) molecule, which is generally comprised of four polypeptide chains, two heavy (Η) chains and two Sight (L) chains, or a functional fragment, mutant, variant, or derivative thereof, that retains the epitope binding features of an Ig molecule. Such fragment, mutant, variant, or derivative antibody formats are known in the art. In an embodiment of a full-length antibody, each heavy chain is comprised of a heavy chain variable region (VH) and a heavy chain constant region (CH). The CH is comprised of three domains, CH1, CH2 and CH3. Each light chain is comprised of a iight chain variable region (VL) and a light chain constant region (CL). The CL is comprised of a single CL domain. The VH and VL can be further subdivided into regions of hypervariability, termed complementarity determining regions (CDRs), interspersed with regions that are more conserved, termed framework regions (FRs). Generally, each VH and VL is composed of three CDRs and four FRs, arranged from amino-terminus to carboxy-terminus in the following order: FR1, CDR1, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDRS, and FR4. Immunogiobulin molecules can be of any type (e.g., IgG, IgE, IgM, IgD, IgA and SgY), class (e.g., IgGi, lgG2, !gG3, !gG4, lgA1 and lgA2), or subclass. [0106] The term “bispecific antibody" refers to an antibody that binds one antigen (or epitope) on one of its two binding arms (one pair of HC/LC), and binds a different antigen (or epitope) on its second binding arm (a different pair of HC/LC). A bispecific antibody has two distinct antigen binding arms (in both specificity and CDR sequences), and is monovalent for each antigen to which it binds. Bispecific antibodies include those generated by quadroma technology (Milstein and Cuello (1983) Nature 305(5934): 537-40), by chemical conjugation of two different monoclonal antibodies (Staerz et al. (1985) Nature 314(6012): 628-31), or by knob-into-hole or similar approaches which introduces mutations in the Fc region (Hoiiiger et ai. (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90(14): 6444-6448). [0107] An “affinity matured” antibody or binding protein refers to an antibody or binding protein with one or more alterations in one or more CDR or framework (FR) regions thereof, which result an improvement in the affinity for an antigen, compared to a parent antibody or binding protein which does not possess those aiteration(s). Exemplary affinity matured antibodies or binding protein will have nanomolar or even picomolar affinities for the target antigen. Affinity matured antibodies or binding protein may be produced by procedures known in the art, e.g., Marks et ai. (1992) BioTechnology 10:779-783 describes affinity maturation by VH and VL domain shuffling. Random mutagenesis of CDR and/or framework residues is described by Barbas et aL (1994) Proc. Mat. Acad. Sci. USA 91:3809-3813; Schieret a!. (1995) Gene 169:147-155; Yeiton et al. (1995) J. Immunol. 155:1994-2004; Jackson et al. (1995) J. Immunol. 154(7):3310-9; Hawkins et al. (1992) J. Mol. Biol. 226:889-896 and mutation at selective mutagenesis positions, contact or hypermutation positions with an activity enhancing amino acid residue as described in US Patent No. 6,914,128. [0108] The term “CDR-grafted” antibody or binding protein refers to an antibody or binding protein that comprises heavy and light chain variable region sequences in which the sequences of one or more of the CDR regions of VH and/or VL are replaced with CDR sequences of another antibody or binding protein. For example, the two antibodies or binding protein can be from different species, such as antibodies or binding protein having murine heavy and light chain variable regions in which one or more of the murine CDRs has been replaced with human CDR sequences. [0109] The term “humanized” antibody or binding protein refers to an antibody or binding protein from a non-human species that has been altered to be more “human-like”, i.e., more similar to human germline sequences. One type of humanized antibody or binding protein is a CDR-grafted antibody or binding protein, in which non-human CDR sequences are introduced into human VH and VL sequences to replace the corresponding human CDR sequences. A humanized antibody or binding protein also encompasses a variant, derivative, analog or fragment of an antibody or or binding protein that comprises framework region (FR) sequences having substantially (e.g,, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 98% or at least 99% identity to) the amino acid sequence of a human antibody and at least one CDR having substantially the amino acid sequence of a non-human antibody. A humanized antibody or binding protein may comprise substantially all of at least one variable domain (Fab, Fab’, F(ab’) 2, FabC, Fv) in which the sequence of all or substantially all of the CDR regions correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin (i.e., donor antibody) and the sequence of all or substantially all of the FR regions are those of a human immunoglobulin. The humanized antibody or binding protein also may inciude the CH1, hinge, CH2, CH3, and CH4 regions of the heavy chain, in an embodiment, a humanized antibody or binding protein may also comprise at least a portion of a human immunoglobulin Fc region. In some embodiments, a humanized antibody or binding protein only contains a humanized light chain. In some embodiments, a humanized antibody or binding protein only contains a humanized heavy chain. In some embodiments, a humanized antibody or binding protein oniy contains a humanized variable domain of a light chain and/or humanized variable domain of a heavy chain. In some embodiments, a humanized antibody or binding protein contains a humanized light chain as well as at least a variable domain of a heavy chain. In some embodiments, a humanized antibody or binding protein contains a humanized heavy chain as well as at least a variable domain of a light chain. [0110] The terms “dual variable domain binding protein” and “dual variable domain immunoglobulin" refer to a binding protein that has two variable domains in each of its two binding arms (e.g., a pair of HC/LC), each of which is able to bind to an antigen, as described in, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 7,612,181 (incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). In an embodiment, each variable domain binds different antigens or epitopes. In another embodiment, each variable domain binds the same antigen or epitope. In another embodiment, a dual variable domain binding protein has two identical antigen binding arms, with identical specificity and identical CDR sequences, and is bivalent for each antigen to which it binds. In an embodiment, the DVD-lg binding proteins may be monospecific, i.e., capable of binding one antigen or multispecific, i.e., capable of binding two or more antigens. For example, a dual variable domain binding protein may have two, three or four different antigen binding arms, with different specificity and/or different CDR sequences on each arm, and the binding protein may be monovalent, bivalent, or multivalent for each antigen to which it binds, DVD-lg binding proteins comprising two heavy chain DVD polypeptides and two light chain DVD polypeptides are referred to as DVD-lg™ proteins. In an embodiment, each half of a four chain DVD-lg binding protein comprises a heavy chain DVD polypeptide, and a light chain DVD polypeptide, and two antigen binding sites. In an embodiment, each binding site comprises a heavy chain variable domain and a light chain variable domain with a total of 6 CDRs involved in antigen binding per antigen binding site. [0111] The term “antiidiotypic antibody” refers to an antibody raised against the amino acid sequence of the antigen combining site of another antibody. Antiidiotypic antibodies may be administered to enhance an immune response against an antigen, [0112] The term “biological activity” refers to any one or more biological properties of a molecule (whether present naturally as found in vivo, or provided or enabled by recombinant means). Biological properties include, but are not limited to, binding a receptor, inducing cell proliferation, inhibiting cell growth, inducing other cytokines, inducing apoptosis, and enzymatic activity. [0113] The term “neutralizing” refers to counteracting the biological activity of an antigen when a binding protein specifically binds to the antigen. In an embodiment, a neutralizing binding protein binds to an antigen (e.g., a cytokine) and reduces the antigen’s biological activity by at least about 20%, about 40℅, about 60%, about 80%, about 85%, about 90%, about 95%, or about 100% (or any percentage in between). [0114] The term “specificity” refers to the ability of a binding protein to selectively bind an antigen. [0115] The term “affinity” refers to the strength of the interaction between a binding protein and an antigen, and is determined by the sequence of the CDRs of the binding protein as well as by the nature of the antigen, such as its size, shape, and/or charge. Binding proteins may be selected for affinities that provide desired therapeutic end-points while minimizing negative side-effects. Affinity may be measured using methods known to one skilled in the art (see, e.g., US 20090311253). [0116] The term "potency" refers to the ability of a binding protein to achieve a desired effect, and is a measurement of its therapeutic efficacy. Potency may be assessed using methods known to one skiiied in the art (see, e.g., US 20090311253). [0117] The term “cross-reactivity” refers to the ability of a binding protein to bind a target other than that against which it was raised. Generally, a binding protein will bind its target tissue(s)/antigen(s) with an appropriately high affinity, but will display an appropriately low affinity for non-target normal tissues. Individual binding proteins are generally selected to meet two criteria. (1) tissue staining appropriate for the known expression of the antibody target, and (2) a similar staining pattern between human and toxicity study species (e.g,, rat, mouse or cynomolgus monkey) tissues from the same organ. These and other methods of assessing cross-reactivity are known to one skilled in the art (see, e.g., US 20090311253). [0118] The term “biological function” refers the specific in vitro or in vivo actions of a binding protein. Binding proteins may target several classes of antigens and achieve desired therapeutic outcomes through multiple mechanisms of action. Binding proteins may target soluble proteins, cel! surface antigens, as well as extracellular protein deposits. Binding proteins may agonize, antagonize, or neutralize the activity of their targets. Binding proteins may assist in the clearance of the targets to which they bind, or may result in cytotoxicity when bound to cells. Portions of two or more antibodies may be incorporated into a multivalent format to achieve distinct functions in a single binding protein molecule. The in vitro assays and in vivo models used to assess biological function are known to one skilled in the art (see, e.g., US 20090311253), [0119] The term “stable" binding protein refers to one in which the binding protein essentially retains its physical stability, chemical stability and/or biological activity upon storage. A multivalent binding protein that is stable in vitro at various temperatures for an extended period of time is desirable. Methods of stabilizing binding proteins and assessing their stability at various temperatures are known to one skilled in the art (see, e.g., US 20090311253). [0120] The term “solubility” refers to the ability of a protein to remain dispersed within an aqueous solution. The solubility of a protein in an aqueous formulation depends upon the proper distribution of hydrophobic and hydrophilic amino acid residues, and therefore, solubility can correlate with the production of correctly folded proteins. A person skilled in the art will be able to detect an increase or decrease in solubility of a binding protein using routine HPLC techniques and methods known to one skilled in the art (see, e.g., US 20090311253). [0121] Binding proteins may be produced using a variety of host cells or may be produced in vitro, and the relative yield per effort determines the “production efficiency.” Factors influencing production efficiency include, but are not limited to, host ceil type (prokaryotic or eukaryotic), choice of expression vector, choice of nucleotide sequence, and methods employed. The materials and methods used in binding protein production, as well as the measurement of production efficiency, are known to one skilled in the art (US 20090311253). [0122] The term “immunogenicity” means the ability of a substance to induce an immune response. Administration of a therapeutic binding protein may result in a certain incidence of an immune response. Potential elements that might induce immunogenicity in a multivalent format may be analyzed during selection of the parental antibodies, and steps to reduce such risk can be taken to optimize the parental antibodies prior to incorporating their sequences into a multivalent binding protein format. Methods of reducing the immunogenicity of antibodies and binding proteins are known to one skilled in the art (US 20090311253). [0123] The terms “label" and “detectable label” refer to a moiety attached to a member of a specific binding pair, such as an antibody/binding protein or its analyte to render a reaction (e.g., binding) between the members of the specific binding pair, detectable. The labeled member of the specific binding pair is referred to as “delectably labeled.” Thus, the term “labeled binding protein” refers to a protein with a label incorporated that provides for the identification of the binding protein. In an embodiment, the label is a detectable marker that can produce a signal that is detectable by visual or instrumental means, e.g., incorporation of a radiolabeled amino acid or attachment to a polypeptide of biotinyl moieties that can be detected by marked avidin (e.g., streptavidin containing a fluorescent marker or enzymatic activity that can be detected by optical or coiorimetric methods). Examples of labels for polypeptides include, but are not limited to, the following: radioisotopes or radionuclides (e.g., 3H 14C 35S, 90Y, "ic, 111ln, 126i, 131i, 177Lu, 166Ho, or 153Sm); chromogens, fluorescent labels (e.g., FiTC, rhodamine, lanthanide phosphors), enzymatic labels (e.g., horseradish peroxidase, luciferase, alkaline phosphatase); chemiluminescent markers; biotinyl groups; predetermined polypeptide epitopes recognized by a secondary reporter (e.g., leucine zipper pair sequences, binding sites for secondary antibodies, metal binding domains, epitope tags); and magnetic agents, such as gadolinium chelates. Representative examples of labels commonly employed for immunoassays include moieties that produce light, e.g., acridinium compounds, and moieties that produce fluorescence, e.g., fluorescein. In this regard, the moiety itself may not be detectably labeled but may become detectable upon reaction with yet another moiety. [0124] The term “conjugate” refers to a binding protein that is chemically linked to a second chemical moiety, such as a therapeutic or cytotoxic agent. The term “agent” includes a chemical compound, a mixture of chemical compounds, a biological macromolecule, or an extract made from biological materials. In an embodiment, the therapeutic or cytotoxic agents include, but are not limited to, pertussis toxin, taxol, cytochalasin Β, gramicidin D, ethidium bromide, emetine, mitomycin, etoposide, tenoposide, vincristine, vinblastine, coichicin, doxorubicin, daunorubicin, dihydroxy anthracin dione, mitoxantrone, mithramycin, actinomycin D, 1-dehydrotestosterone, glucocorticoids, procaine, tetracaine, lidocaine, propranolol, and puromycin and analogs or homologs thereof. When employed in the context of an immunoassay, the conjugate antibody may be a detectably labeled antibody used as the detection antibody. [0125] The terms “crystal” and “crystallized” refer to a binding protein (e.g., an antibody), or antigen binding portion thereof, that exists in the form of a crystal. Crystals are one form of the solid state of matter, which is distinct from other forms such as the amorphous solid state or the liquid crystalline state. Crystals are composed of regular, repeating, three-dimensional arrays of atoms, ions, molecules (e.g., proteins such as antibodies), or molecular assemblies (e.g., antigen/antibody complexes). These three-dimensional arrays are arranged according to specific mathematical relationships that are well-understood in the field. The fundamental unit, or building block, that is repeated in a crystal is called the asymmetric unit. Repetition of the asymmetric unit in an arrangement that conforms to a given, well-defined crystallographic symmetry provides the "unit cell” of the crystal. Repetition of the unit cell by regular translations in all three dimensions provides the crystal. See Giege, R. and Ducruix, A. Barrett, Crystallization of Nucleic Acids and Proteins, a Practical Approach, 2nd ea., ρρ. 20 1-18, Oxford University Press, New York, New York, (1999). [0128] The term "vector” refers to a nucleic acid moiecule capable of transporting another nucleic add to which it has been linked. One type of vector is a “plasmid”, which refers to a circular double stranded DNA loop into which additional DNA segments may be ligated. Another type of vector is a viral vector, wherein additional DNA segments may be ligated into the viral genome. Other vectors include RNA vectors. Certain vectors are capable of autonomous replication in a host cell into which they are introduced (e.g., bacterial vectors having a bacterial origin of replication and episomal mammalian vectors). Other vectors (e.g., non-episomal mammalian vectors) can be integrated into the genome of a host ceil upon introduction into the host cell, and thereby are replicated along with the host genome. Certain vectors are capable of directing the expression of genes to which they are operatively linked. Such vectors are referred to herein as “recombinant expression vectors” (or simply, “expression vectors”). In general, expression vectors of utility in recombinant DNA techniques are often in the form of plasmids. In the present specification, “plasmid” and “vector” may be used interchangeably as the plasmid is the most commonly used form of vector. However, other forms of expression vectors are also included, such as viral vectors (e.g., replication defective retroviruses, adenoviruses and adeno-associated viruses), which serve equivalent functions. A group of pHybE vectors (e.g., US Patent 8,187,838) may be used for parental antibody and DVD-binding protein cloning. V1, derived from ρϋΡ183; pHybE-hCg1,z,non-a V2, mayb ℮ used for cloning of antibody and DVD heavy chains with a wildtype constant region. V2, derived from ρϋΡ191; pHybE-hCk V3, may be used for cloning of antibody and DVD light chains with a kappa constant region. V3, derived from ρϋΡ192; pHybE-hCI V2, may be used for cloning of antibody and DVD light chains with a iambda constant region. V4, built with a lambda signal peptide and a kappa constant region, may be used for cloning of DVD light chains with a lambdakappa hybrid V domain. V5, built with a kappa signal peptide and a lambda constant region, may be used for cloning of DVD light chains with a kappa-lambda hybrid V domain. V7, derived from ρϋΡ183; pHybE-hCg1,z,non-a V2, may be used for cloning of antibody and DVD heavy chains with a (234,235 ΑΑ) mutant constant region. [0127] The terms “recombinant host ceil” or “host cell" refer to a ceil into which exogenous DNA has been introduced. Such terms refer not only to the particular subject cell, but to the progeny of such a cell. Because certain modifications may occur in succeeding generations due to either mutation or environmental influences, such progeny may not, in fact, be identical to the parent cell, but are still included within the scope of the term “host ceil” as used herein. In an embodiment, host cells include prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. In an embodiment, eukaryotic ceils include protist, fungal, plant and animal cells. In another embodiment, host ceils include but are not limited to the prokaryotic ceil line E.Coli; mammalian cell lines CHO, ΗΕΚ 293, COS, NSO, SP2 and PER.C6; the insect ceil line Sf9; and the fungal cell Saccharomyces cerevisiae. [0128] The term “transfection” encompasses a variety of techniques commonly used for the introduction of exogenous nucleic acid (e.g., DNA) into a host ceil, e.g., electroporation, calcium-phosphate precipitation, DEAE-dextran transfection and the like. [0129] The term “cytokine” refers to a protein released by one cell population that acts on another cell population as an intercellular mediator. The term “cytokine” includes proteins from natural sources or from recombinant cell culture and biologically active equivalents of the native sequence cytokines. [0130] The term “biological sample” refers to a quantity of a substance from a living thing or formerly living thing. Such substances include, but are not limited to, blood, (e.g., whole blood), plasma, serum, urine, amniotic fluid, synovial fluid, endothelial cells, leukocytes, monocytes, other cells, organs, tissues, bone marrow, lymph nodes and spleen. [0131] The term “component” refers to an element of a composition. In relation to a diagnostic kit, for example, a component may be a capture antibody, a detection or conjugate antibody, a control, a calibrator, a series of calibrators, a sensitivity panel, a container, a buffer, a diluent, a salt, an enzyme, a co-factor for an enzyme, a detection reagent, a pretreatment reagent/solution, a substrate (e.g., as a solution), a stop solution, and the like that can be included in a kit for assay of a test sample. Thus, a “component” can include a polypeptide or other analyte as above, that is immobilized on a solid support, such as by binding to an anti-analyte (e.g., antipolypeptide) antibody. Some components can be in solution or lyophiiized for reconstitution for use in an assay. [0132] "Control” refers to a composition known to not analyte (“negative control”) or to contain analyte (“positive control”). A positive control can comprise a known concentration of analyte. “Control,” “positive control,” and “calibrator" may be used interchangeably herein to refer to a composition comprising a known concentration of analyte. A “positive control” can be used to establish assay performance characteristics and is a useful indicator of the integrity of reagents (e.g., analytes). [0133] “Predetermined cutoff and "predetermined level” refer generally to an assay cutoff value that is used to assess diagnostic/prognostic/therapeutic efficacy results by comparing the assay results against the predetermined cutoff/level, where the predetermined cutoff/level already has been linked or associated with various clinical parameters (e.g., severity of disease, progression/nonprogression/improvement, etc.). While the present disclosure may provide exemplary predetermined levels, it is well-known that cutoff values may vary depending on the nature of the immunoassay (e.g., antibodies employed, etc.). It further is well within the ordinary skill of one in the art to adapt the disclosure herein for other immunoassays to obtain immunoassay-specific cutoff values for those other immunoassays based on this disclosure. Whereas the precise value of the predetermined cutoff/levei may vary between assays, correlations as described herein (if any) may be generally applicable. [0134] “Pretreatment reagent,” e.g., lysis, precipitation and/or solubilization reagent, as used in a diagnostic assay as described herein refers to one that lyses any cells and/or solubilizes any analyte that is/are present in a test sample. Pretreatment is not necessary for all samples, as described further herein. Among other things, solubilizing the analyte (e.g., polypeptide of interest) may entail release of the analyte from any endogenous binding proteins present in the sample. A pretreatment reagent may be homogeneous (not requiring a separation step) or heterogeneous (requiring a separation step). With use of a heterogeneous pretreatment reagent there is removal of any precipitated analyte binding proteins from the test sample prior to proceeding to the next step of the assay. [0135] “Quality control reagents” in the context of immunoassays and kits described herein, include, but are not limited to, calibrators, controls, and sensitivity panels. A "calibrator” or "standard” typically is used (e.g,, one or more, such as a plurality) in order to establish calibration (standard) curves for interpolation of the concentration of an analyte, such as an antibody or an analyte. Alternatively, a single calibrator, which is near a predetermined positive/negative cutoff, can be used. Multiple calibrators (i.e., more than one calibrator or a varying amount of calibrator(s)) can be used in conjunction so as to comprise a “sensitivity panel." [0138] The term “specific binding partner” refers to a member of a specific binding pair. A specific binding pair comprises two different molecules that specifically bind to each other through chemical or physical means. Therefore, in addition to antigen and antibody specific binding, other specific binding pairs can include biotin and avldin (or streptavidin), carbohydrates and lectins, complementary nucleotide sequences, effector and receptor molecules, cofactors and enzymes, enzyme inhibitors and enzymes, and the like. Furthermore, specific binding pairs can include members that are analogs of the original specific binding members, for example, an analyte-analog. Immunoreactive specific binding members include antigens, antigen fragments, and antibodies, including monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies as well as complexes, fragments, and variants (including fragments of variants) thereof, whether isolated or recombinantly produced. [0137] The term “Fc region” refers to the C-termina! region of an immunoglobulin heavy chain, which may be generated by papain digestion of an intact antibody or binding protein. The Fc region may be a native sequence Fc region or a variant Fc region. The Fc region of an immunoglobulin generally comprises two constant domains, a CH2 domain and a CH3 domain, and optionally comprises a CH4 domain. Replacements of amino acid residues in the Fc portion to alter effector function are known in the art (e.g., US Patent Nos. 5,648,260 and 5,624,821). The Fc region mediates several important effector functions, e.g., cytokine induction, antibody dependent ceil mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), phagocytosis, complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), and half-life/ clearance rate of antibody or binding protein and antigen-antibody or antigen-binding protein complexes. In some cases these effector functions are desirable for a therapeutic immunoglobulin but in other cases might be unnecessary or even deleterious, depending on the therapeutic objectives. [0138] The term “antigen-binding portion" of a binding protein refers to one or more fragments of a binding protein that retain the ability to specifically bind to an antigen. The antigen-binding portion of a binding protein can be performed by fragments of a full-length binding protein, including bispecific, dual specific, or multi-specific formats; specifically binding to two or more different antigens. Examples of binding fragments encompassed within the term “antigen-binding portion” of an binding protein include (i) an Fab fragment, a monovalent fragment consisting of the VL, VH, CL and CH1 domains; (ii) an F(ab’)2 fragment, a bivalent fragment comprising two Fab fragments linked by a disulfide bridge at the hinge region; (iii) an Fd fragment consisting of the VH and CH1 domains; (iv) an Fv fragment consisting of the VL and VH domains of a single arm of an antibody or binding protein, (ν) a dAb fragment, which comprises a single variable domain; and (vi) an isolated complementarity determining region (CDR). Furthermore, although the two domains of the Fv fragment, VL and VH, encoded by separate genes, they can be joined, using recombinant methods, by a synthetic linker that enables them to be made as a single protein chain in which the VL and VH regions pair to form monovalent molecules (known as single chain Fv (scFv), Such single chain antibodies or binding proteins are also intended to be encompassed within the term “antigen-binding portion” of an antibody or binding protein. Other forms of single chain antibodies, such as diabodies are also encompassed. In addition, single chain antibodies or binding protein also include “linear” antibodies or binding protein comprising a pair of tandem Fv segments (VH-GH1-VH-GH1) which, together with complementary light chain polypeptides, form a pair of antigen binding regions, [0139] The term “multivalent binding protein” refers to a binding protein comprising two or more antigen binding sites, in an embodiment, the multivalent binding protein is engineered to have three or more antigen binding sites, and may not be a naturally occurring antibody. The term “multispecific binding protein” refers to a binding protein capable of binding two or more related or unrelated targets. In an embodiment, the dual variable domain (DVD) binding proteins provided herein comprise two or more antigen binding sites and are tetravalent or multivalent binding proteins. [0140] The term “linker” refers to an amino acid residue or a polypeptide comprising two or more amino acid residues joined by peptide bonds that are used to link two polypeptides (e.g., two VH or two VL domains). Such linker polypeptides are well known in the art (see, e.g., Holliger et al. (1993) Proc, Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:6444-6448; Poljak et al. (1994) Structure 2:1121-1123), [0141] The terms “Kabat numbering”, “Kabat definitions” and “Kabat labeling” are used interchangeably herein. These terms, which are recognized in the art, refer to a system of numbering amino acid residues which are more variable (i.e., hypervariabie) than other amino acid residues in the heavy and light chain variable regions of an antibody or binding protein, or an antigen binding portion thereof (Kabat et al. (1971) Ann. NY Acad. Sci. 190:382-391 and, Kabat et al. (1991) Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, Fifth Edition, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, NiH Publication No. 91-3242). For the heavy chain variable region, the hypervariabie region ranges from amino acid positions 31 to 35 for CDR1, amino acid positions 50 to 65 for CDR2, and amino acid positions 95 to 102 for CDR3. For the light chain variable region, the hypervariabie region ranges from amino acid positions 24 to 34 for CDR1, amino acid positions 50 to 56 for CDR2, and amino acid positions 89 to 97 for CDR3. [0142] The term “CDR” refers to a complementarity determining region within an immunoglobulin variable region sequence. There are three CDRs in each of the variable regions of the heavy chain and the light chain, which are designated CDR1, CDR2 and CDRS, for each of the heavy and light chain variable regions. The term “CDR set” refers to a group of three CDRs that occur in a single variable region capable of binding the antigen. The exact boundaries of these CDRs have been defined differently according to different systems. The system described by Kabat (Kabat et al. (1987) and (1991)) not only provides an unambiguous residue numbering system applicable to any variable region of an antibody or binding protein, but also provides precise residue boundaries defining the three CDRs in each heavy or light chain sequence. These CDRs may be referred to as Kabat CDRs. Chothia and coworkers (Chothia and Lesk (1987) J. Mol. Biol. 198:901-917; Chothia et al. (1989) Nature 342:877-883) found that certain sub- portions within Kabat CDRs adopt nearly identical peptide backbone conformations, despite having great diversity at the level of amino acid sequence. These sub-portions were designated as L1, L2 and L3 or Η1, Η2 and Η3 where the “L” and the “H” designates the iight chain and the heavy chain regions, respectively. These regions may be referred to as Chothia CDRs, which have boundaries that overlap with Kabat CDRs. Other boundaries defining CDRs overlapping with the Kabat CDRs have been described by Padlan (1995) FASEB J. 9:133-139 and MacCaiium (1996) J. Mol. Biol. 262(5):732-45). Still other CDR boundary definitions may not strictly follow one of the herein systems, but will nonetheless overlap with the Kabat CDRs, although they may be shortened or lengthened in light of prediction or experimental findings that particular residues or groups of residues or even entire CDRs do not significantly impact antigen binding. The methods used herein may utilize CDRs defined according to any of these systems, although certain embodiments use Kabat or Chothia defined CDRs. [0143] The term “epitope” refers to a region of an antigen that is bound by a binding protein, e.g., a polypeptide and/or other determinant capable of specific binding to an immunoglobulin orT~ceil receptor. In certain embodiments, epitope determinants include chemically active surface groupings of molecules such as amino acids, sugar side chains, phosphoryl, or sulfonyl, and, in certain embodiments, may have specific three dimensional structural characteristics, and/or specific charge characteristics. In an embodiment, an epitope comprises the amino acid residues of a region of an antigen (or fragment thereof) that are recognized by and/or bound by the complementary site on the specific binding partner. An antigenic fragment can contain more than one epitope. In certain embodiments, a binding protein specifically binds an antigen when it recognizes its target antigen in a complex mixture of proteins and/or macromolecules. Binding proteins “bind to the same epitope” if the antibodies or binding proteins cross-compete (one prevents the binding or modulating effect of the other). In addition, structural definitions of epitopes (overlapping, similar, identical) are informative; and functional definitions encompass structural (binding) and functional (modulation, competition) parameters. Different regions of proteins may perform different functions. For example specific regions of a cytokine interact with its cytokine receptor to bring about receptor activation whereas other regions of the protein may be required for stabilizing the cytokine. To abrogate the negative effects of cytokine signaling, the cytokine may be targeted with a binding protein that binds specifically to the receptor interacting region(s), thereby preventing the binding of its receptor. Alternatively, a binding protein may target the regions responsible for cytokine stabilization, thereby designating the protein for degradation. The methods of visualizing and modeling epitope recognition are known to one skilled in the art (US 20090311253). [0144] The term “pharmaeokinetic(s)” refers to the process by which a drug is absorbed, distributed, metabolized, and excreted by an organism. To generate a multivalent binding protein molecule with a desired pharmacokinetic profile, parent monoclonal antibodies with similarly desired pharmacokinetic profiles are selected. The ΡΚ profiles of the selected parental monoclonal antibodies can be easily determined in rodents using methods known to one skilled in the art (see, e.g., US 20090311253). [0145] The term “bioavailability” refers to the amount of active drug that reaches its target following administration, Bioavaiiability is function of several of the previously described properties, including stability, solubility, immunogenicity and pharmacokinetics, and can be assessed using methods known to one skiiled in the art (see, e.g., US 20090311253). [0146] The term “surface plasmon resonance” refers to an optical phenomenon that allows for the analysis of real-time biospecific interactions by detection of alterations in protein concentrations within a biosensor matrix, for example using the BIAcore® system (BIAcore International ΑΒ, a GE Healthcare company, Uppsala, Sweden and Piscataway, NJ). For further descriptions, see Jonsson et al. (1993) Ann. Biol. Clin. 51:19-26. The term “Kon” refers to the on rate constant for association of a binding protein (e.g., an antibody or DVD-lg) to the antigen to form the, e.g., DVD-lg/antigen complex. The term “Kon” also refers to “association rate constant”, or “ka”, as is used interchangeably herein. This value indicating the binding rate of a binding protein to its target antigen or the rate of complex formation between a binding protein, e.g., an antibody, and antigen also is shown by the equation below: Antibody (“Ab”) + Antigen {“Ag”)-»Ab-Ag [0147] The term “K0ff!i refers to the off rate constant for dissociation, or “dissociation rate constant", of a binding protein {e.g., an antibody or DVD-lg) from the, e.g., DVD-lg/antigen complex as is known in the art. This value indicates the dissociation rate of a binding protein, e.g., an antibody, from its target antigen or separation of Ab-Ag compiex over time into free antibody and antigen as shown by the equation below: Ab + Ag«-~Ab-Ag [0148] The terms “Kd” and “equilibrium dissociation constant” refer to the vaiue obtained in a titration measurement at equilibrium, or by dividing the dissociation rate constant (K0ff) by the association rate constant (Kon). The association rate constant, the dissociation rate constant and the equilibrium dissociation constant, are used to represent the binding affinity of a binding protein (e.g., an antibody or DVD-lg) to an antigen. Methods for determining association and dissociation rate constants are well known in the art. Using fluorescence-based techniques offers high sensitivity and the abiiity to examine samples in physiological buffers at equilibrium. Other experimental approaches and instruments such as a BIAcore® (biomolecular interaction analysis) assay, can be used (e.g., instrument available from BIAcore International ΑΒ, a GE Healthcare company, Uppsala, Sweden). Additionally, a KinExA© (Kinetic Exclusion Assay) assay, available from Sapidyne Instruments (Boise, Idaho), can also be used. [0149] The term “variant" refers to a polypeptide that differs from a given polypeptide in amino acid sequence by the addition (e.g., insertion), deletion, or conservative substitution of amino acids, but that retains the biological activity of the given polypeptide (e.g., a variant IL-17 antibody can compete with anti~!L~17 antibody for binding to IL-17). A conservative substitution of an amino acid, i.e., replacing an amino acid with a different amino acid of similar properties (e.g., hydrophilicity and degree and distribution of charged regions) is recognized in the art as typically involving a minor change. These minor changes can be identified, in part, by considering the hydropathic index of amino acids, as understood in the art (see, e.g., Kyte et al. (1982) J. Mol. Biol. 157: 105-132). The hydropathic index of an amino acid is based on a consideration of its hydrophoblcity and charge. It is known in the art that amino acids of similar hydropathic indexes in a protein can be substituted and the protein still retains protein function. In one aspect, amino acids having hydropathic indexes of ± 2 are substituted. The hydrophilicity of amino acids also can be used to reveal substitutions that would result in proteins retaining biological function. A consideration of the hydrophilicity of amino acids in the context of a peptide permits calculation of the greatest local average hydrophilicity of that peptide, a useful measure that has been reported to correlate well with antigenicity and immunogenicity (see, e.g., US Patent No. 4,554,101). Substitution of amino acids having similar hydrophilicity values can result in peptides retaining biological activity, for example Immunogenicity, as is understood in the art. In one aspect, substitutions are performed with amino adds having hydrophilidty values within ± 2 of each other. Both the bydrophobicity index and the hydrophilicity value of amino acids are influenced by the particular side chain of that amino acid. Consistent with that observation, amino acid substitutions that are compatible with biological function are understood to depend on the relative similarity of the amino acids, and particularly the side chains of those amino acids, as revealed by the hydrophobicity, hydrophilicity, charge, size, and other properties. The term “variant” also includes polypeptide or fragment thereof that has been differentially processed, such as by proteolysis, phosphorylation, or other post-translational modification, yet retains its biological activity or antigen reactivity, e.g., the ability to bind to IL-17. The term “variant" encompasses fragments of a variant unless otherwise defined, A variant may be about 99%, 98%, 97%, 96%, 95%, 94%, 93%, 92%, 91%, 90%, 89%, 88%, 87%, 86℅,85℅, 84%, 83%, 82%, 81%, 80%, 79%, 78%, 77%, 76%, or 75% identical to the wildtype sequence. Generation of binding proteins [0150] Binding proteins capable of binding ΐℓ-1β and/or IL-17 and methods of making the same are provided. The binding protein can be generated using various techniques. Expression vectors, host ceil and methods of generating the binding protein are provided and others are known in the art. A. Construction of binding protein molecules [0151] The binding protein may be designed such that two different iight chain variable domains (VL) from the two different parent monoclonal antibodies are linked in tandem directly or via a linker by recombinant DNA techniques, followed by the Sight chain constant domain CL. Similarly, the heavy chain comprises two different heavy chain variable domains (VH) linked in tandem, directly or via a linker, followed by the constant domain CH1 and Fc region (Figure 1). [0152] The variable domains can be obtained using recombinant DNA techniques from parent antibodies generated by any one of the methods described herein. S [0153] The linker sequence may be a single amino add or a polypeptide sequence. In an embodiment, the choice of linker sequences is based on crystal structure analysis of several Fab molecules. There is a natural flexible linkage between the variable domain and the CH1/CL constant domain in Fab or antibody molecular structure. This natural linkage comprises approximately 10-12 amino acid residues, contributed by 4-6 residues from the G~terminus of a V domain and 4-6 residues from the N-terminus of a CL/CH1 domain. DVD-lg binding proteins were generated using N-terminal 5-6 amino acid residues, or 11-12 amino acid residues, of CL or CH1 as a linker in the light chain and heavy chains, respectively. The N-terminai residues of CL or CH1 domains, particularly the first 5-6 amino acid residues, can adopt a loop conformation without strong secondary structures, and therefore can act as flexible linkers between the two variable domains. The N-terminal residues of CL or CH1 domains are natural extension of the variable domains, as they are part of the Ig sequences, and therefore their use minimizes to a large extent any immunogenicity potentially arising from the linkers and junctions. [0154] In a further embodiment, the binding protein includes at least one Χ1 linker selected from AKTTPKLEEGEFSEAR (SEQ ID NO: 1); AKTTPKLEEGEFSEARV (SEQ ID NO: 2); AKTTPKLGG (SEQ ID NO: 3); SAKTTPKLGG (SEQ ID NO: 4); SAKTTP (SEQ ID NO: 5); RADAAP (SEQ ID NO: 6); RADAAPTVS (SEQ ID NO: 7); RADAAAAGGPGS (SEQ ID NO: 8); RADAAAA(G4S)4 (SEQ ID NO: 9); SAKTTPKLEEGEFSEARV (SEQ ID NO: 10); ADAAP (SEQ ID NO: 11); ADAAPTVSIFPP (SEQ ID NO: 12); TVAAP (SEQ ID NO: 13); TVAAPSVFIFPP (SEQ ID NO: 14); QPKAAP (SEQ ID NO; 15); QPKAAPSVTLFPP (SEQ ID NO: 16); ΑΚΤΤΡΡ (SEQ ID NO: 17); AKTTPPSVTPLAP (SEQ ID NO; 18); ΑΚΤΤΑΡ (SEQ ID NO: 19); AKTTAPSVYPLAP (SEQ ID NO; 20); ASTKGP (SEQ ID NO: 21); ASTKGPSVFPLAP (SEQ ID NO; 22), GGGGSGGGGSGGGGS (SEQ ID NO: 23); GENKVEYAPALMALS (SEQ ID NO: 24); GPAKELTPLKEAKVS (SEQ ID NO: 25); or GHEAAAVMQVQYPAS (SEQ ID NO: 26); TVAAPSVFIFPPTVAAPSVFIFPP (SEQ ID NO: 27); ASTKGPSVFPLAPASTKGPSVFPLAP (SEQ ID NO: 28); GGGGSGGGGS (SEQ ID NO: 29); GGSGGGGSG (SEQ ID NO: 30); and G/S based sequences (e.g., G4S and G4S repeats; SEQ ID NO: 31). In an embodiment, Χ1 on one polypeptide chain of a binding protein comprises SEQ ID NO: 29 and Χ1 on the other polypeptide chain comprises SEQ ID NO: 30. In an embodiment, Χ2 is an Fc region. In another embodiment, Χ2 is a variant Fc region. [0155] Other linker sequences may include any sequence of any length of a CL/CH1 domain but not all residues of a CL/CH1 domain; for example the first 5-12 amino acid residues of a CL/CH1 domain; the light chain linkers can be from Ck or Ολ; and the heavy chain linkers can be derived from CH1 of any isotype, including Ογ1, Cy2, Ογ3, Cy4, Ca1, Ca2, Οδ, Οε, and Cp. Linker sequences may also be derived from other proteins such as Ig-like proteins (e.g., TCR, FcR, KIR); G/S based sequences (e.g., G4S repeats; SEQ ID NO: 31); hinge region-derived sequences; and other natural sequences from other proteins. [0156] In an embodiment, a constant domain is linked to the two linked variable domains using recombinant DNA techniques. In an embodiment, a sequence comprising linked heavy chain variable domains is linked to a heavy chain constant domain and a sequence comprising linked light chain variable domains is linked to a light chain constant domain. In an embodiment, the constant domains are human heavy chain constant domains and human light chain constant domains respectively. In an embodiment, the DVD heavy chain is further linked to an Fc region. The Fc region may be a native sequence Fc region or a variant Fc region. In another embodiment, the Fc region is a human Fc region, in another embodiment, the Fc region includes Fc region from lgG1, igG2, lgG3, lgG4, IgA, SgM, IgE, or IgD. [0157] In an embodiment, an antibody or functional antigen binding fragment thereof is disclosed, comprising an antibody having a functional binding site capable of binding !L-1beta or IL-17 and having a variable region comprising paired VH and VL sequences selected from the pairs listed in Table 1, or comprising the CDR regions of those VH and VL regions. For instance, the antibody or functional antigen binding fragment thereof may be capable of binding !L~1beta and have a variable region comprising SEQ ID NOs: 32 and 33. Likewise, an antibody or functional antigen binding fragment thereof can be capable of binding IL-17 and have a variable region comprising, e.g., SEQ ID NOs: 44 and 45 or SEQ ID NOs: 46 and 47. Similar antibodies are disclosed comprising the remaining pairs in Table 1. In an embodiment, a functional antigen binding fragment of an antibody described above is disclosed, wherein the antigen binding fragment retains variable sequences sufficient to form a binding site capable of binding the target antigen. For example, the antigen binding fragment may comprise the CDR regions taken from the paired VH and VL sequences in Table 1, or the full VH and VL sequences with or without an Fc domain. A functional antigen binding fragment may include, among other examples, a humanized, fully human, camelized, single-chain, chimeric, synthetic, recombinant, hybrid, mutated, back-mutated, or CDR-grafted antibody, or a Fab, F(ab')2, Fv, scFv, Fd, dAb fragment, a VHH (also referred to as a nanobody), or any other antibody fragment that retains antigen-binding function, including bi-specific or multi-specific antibodies. [0158] In an embodiment, a binding protein (e.g,, a duai variable domain binding protein) is disclosed comprising variable domains selected from those in Table 1. In some embodiments, the binding protein comprises first and second polypeptide chains, each of which comprises VD1~(X1)n-VD2-C-X2, and wherein the first and second chains of the binding protein together form two functional binding sites, wherein those binding sites are capable of binding IL-1beta and/or IL-17. In some embodiments, the VD1 and VD2 sequences are independently chosen (ΐ.℮., the choice of VH and VL sequences for the VD1 position does not impact the choice of sequences for the VD2 position, and vice versa). In an embodiment, each functional binding site comprises paired VH and VL sequences selected from the pairs listed in Table 1 (e.g., the paired VH and VL sequences of SEQ ID NO: 32 and 33, forming a binding site for IL-1 beta), or comprising the CDR regions of those VH and VL sequences. In some embodiments, the first chain comprises a first VH sequence at position VD1 and a second VH sequence at position VD2, both of which are selected from Tabie 1, or the VD1 and VD2 domains contain the CDR sequences from those selected VH sequences, while the second chain comprises a first VL sequence at position VD1 and a second VL sequence at position VD2, both of which are selected from Table 1, or the VD1 and VD2 domains contain the CDR sequences from those selected VL sequences, in other embodiments, the VH-VL arrangement of the first or second binding site is flipped across the two poiypeptide chains, such that each chain comprises a VH sequence joined to a VL sequence, while the two chains together still form two functional binding sites. For instance, the first polypeptide chain may comprise a VH sequence at the VD1 position and a VL sequence at the VD2 position, while the second chain would comprise the paired VL sequence at the VD1 position (forming a first functional binding site) and the paired VH sequence at the VD2 position (forming a second binding site). [0159] In an embodiment, two first chain polypeptides and two second chain polypeptides are combined to form a DVD-lg binding protein having two arms and four binding sites. An example of a DVD-lg binding protein structure having two arms and four binding sites is shown in Figure 1. In an embodiment, a DVD-lg binding protein comprises at the VD1 and VD2 positions on each arm at least one, or at least two, at least three, or at least four, of the VH and VL sequence pairs listed In Table 1, In any orientation. In some embodiments, sequence pairs forming the binding sites are independently chosen (e.g., the choice of VH and VL sequences for the VD1 position on one arm does not impact the choice of sequences for the VD1 position on the other arm, nor does it affect the choice of sequences for the VD2 positions on either arm). The VH and VL sequences provided in Table 1 below comprise complementarity determining regions (CDRs) and framework sequences. In some embodiments, one or more of the framework sequences are replaced, without loss of function, by other framework sequences, e.g., from binding proteins that are known in the art to bind to the same antigen. [0180] In another embodiment, two heavy chain DVD-lg polypeptides and two light chain DVD-lg polypeptides are combined to form a DVD-lg binding protein. Tables 1A-1G list amino add sequences of VH and VL regions of exemplary antibodies useful for treating disease. In an embodiment, a DVD-lg comprising at least two of the VH and/or VL regions listed in Table 1, in any orientation, is provided. In some embodiments, VD1 and VD2 are independently chosen. Therefore, in some embodiments, VD1 and VD2 comprise the same SEG ID NO and, in other embodiments, VD1 and VD2 comprise different SEQ ID NOS. The VH and VL domain sequences provided beiow comprise complementarity determining regions (GDRs) and framework sequences that are either known in the art or readily discernible using methods known in the art. In some embodiments, one or more of these CDRs and/or framework sequences are replaced, without loss of function, by other CDRs and/or framework sequences from binding proteins that are known in the art to bind to the same antigen.

For instance, CDRs 1-3 are underlined for SEQ ID NO: 32 at amino acid positions 31-35, 50-66, and 99-108. Detailed descriptions of specific DVD-ig binding proteins capable of binding specific targets, and methods of making the same, are provided throughout this disclosure, and in the Examples section below. Β. Production of binding proteins [0162] The binding proteins provided herein may be produced by any of a number of techniques known in the art. For example, expression from host cells, wherein expression vector(s) encoding the DVD-ig heavy and DVD-Ig light chains is (are) transfected into a host cel! by standard techniques. Although it is possible to express the DVD-lg binding proteins provided herein in either prokaryotic or eukaryotic host ceils, DVD-lg binding proteins are preferably expressed in eukaryotic cells, for example, mammalian host cells, because such eukaryotic cells (and in particular mammalian cells) are more likely than prokaryotic cells to assemble and secrete a properly folded and immunologlcally active DVD-lg binding protein. [0163] In an exemplary system for recombinant expression of DVD-lg proteins, a recombinant expression vector encoding both the DVD-ig heavy chain and the DVD-ig light chain is introduced into dhfr- CHO cells by calcium phosphatemediated transfection. Within the recombinant expression vector, the DVD-ig heavy and light chain sequences are each operativeiy linked to CMV enhancer/AdMLP promoter regulatory elements to drive high levels of transcription of the genes. The recombinant expression vector also carries a DHFR gene, which allows for selection of CHO cells that have been transfected with the vector using methotrexate selection/amplification. The selected transformant host cells are cultured to allow for expression of the DVD-lg heavy and light chains and intact DVD-lg protein is recovered from the culture medium. Standard molecular biology techniques are used to prepare the recombinant expression vector, transfect the host cells, select for transformants, culture the host ceils and recover the DVD-lg protein from the culture medium. A method of synthesizing a DVD-lg protein provided herein by culturing a host cell provided herein in a suitable culture medium until a DVD-lg protein is synthesized is also provided. The method can further comprise isolating the DVD-lg protein from the culture medium. [0164] An important feature of a DVD-lg binding protein is that it can be produced and purified in a similar way to a conventional antibody. The production of DVD-lg binding protein results in a homogeneous, single major product with desired dual-specific activity, without the need for sequence modification of the constant region or chemical modifications. Other previously described methods to generate “bi-specific", “multi-specific”, and “multi-specific multivalent” full length binding proteins can lead to the intracellular or secreted production of a mixture of assembled inactive, mono-specific, multi-specific, multivalent, full length binding proteins, and multivalent full length binding proteins with a combination of different binding sites. [0165] Surprisingly, the design of the “dual-specific multivalent full length binding proteins” provided herein leads to a dual variable domain light chain and a dual variable domain heavy chain that assemble primarily to the desired “dual-specific multivalent full length binding proteins”. [0166] in some embodiments, at least 50%, at least 75% and at least 90% of the assembled, and expressed dual variable domain immunoglobulin molecules are the desired dual-specific tetravalent protein, and therefore possess enhanced commercial utility. Thus, in various embodiments a method to express a dual variable domain light chain and a dual variable domain heavy chain in a single cell leading to a single primary product of a “dual-specific tetravalent full length binding protein” is provided. [0167] Methods of expressing a dual variable domain light chain and a dual variable domain heavy chain in a single cell leading to a “primary product” of a “dual-specific tetravalent full length binding protein”, where the “primary product” is more than 50%, such as more than 75% and more than 90%, of all assembled protein, comprising a dual variable domain light chain and a dual variable domain heavy chain are provided. [0168] Given their ability to bind to two or more antigens, the binding proteins provided herein can be used to detect the antigens (e.g., in a biological sample, such as serum or plasma), using a conventional immunoassay, such as an enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), a radioimmunoassay (RIA), or tissue immunohistochemistry. The binding protein is directly or indirectly labeled with a detectable substance to facilitate detection of the bound or unbound antibody, Suitable detectable substances include various enzymes, prosthetic groups, fluorescent materials, luminescent materials and radioactive materials. Examples of suitable enzymes include horseradish peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase, βgalactosidase, or acetylcholinesterase; examples of suitable prosthetic group complexes include streptavidin/biotin and avidin/biotin; examples of suitable fluorescent materials include umbelliferone, fluorescein, fluorescein isothiocyanate, rhodamine, dichlorotriazinylamine fluorescein, dansyl chloride or phycoerythrin. An example of a luminescent material is luminoi and examples of suitable radioactive materials include 3H 14C 3SS, 90Y, 99Tc, r11!n, 12SI, 131l, 177Lu, 16SHq, and 153Sm. [0169] In an embodiment, the binding proteins provided herein are capable of neutralizing the activity of their antigen targets both in vitro and in vivo. Accordingly, such binding proteins can be used to inhibit antigen activity, e.g., in a cell culture containing the antigens, in human subjects or in other mammalian subjects having the antigens with which a binding protein provided herein cross-reacts. in another embodiment, a method for reducing antigen activity in a subject suffering from a disease or disorder in which the antigen activity is detrimental is provided. A binding protein provided herein can be administered to a human subject for therapeutic purposes. [0170] The term “a disorder in which antigen activity is detrimental” is intended to include diseases and other disorders in which the presence of the antigen in a subject suffering from the disorder has been shown to be or is suspected of being either responsible for the pathophysiology of the disorder or a factor that contributes to a worsening of the disorder. Accordingly, a disorder in which antigen activity is detrimental is a disorder in which reduction of antigen activity is expected to alleviate the symptoms and/or progression of the disorder. Such disorders may be evidenced, for example, by an increase in the concentration of the antigen in a biological fluid of a subject suffering from the disorder (e.g., an increase in the concentration of antigen in serum, plasma, synovial fluid, etc., of the subject). Non-limiting examples of disorders that can be treated with the binding proteins provided herein include those disorders discussed below and in the section pertaining to pharmaceutical compositions comprising the binding proteins. [0171] DVD-lg binding proteins are useful as therapeutic agents to simultaneously block two different targets to enhance efficacy/safety and/or increase patient coverage. [0172] Additionally, DVD~ig binding proteins provided herein can be employed for tissue-specific delivery (target a tissue marker and a disease mediator for enhanced local ΡΚ thus higher efficacy and/or lower toxicity), including intracellular delivery (targeting an internalizing receptor and an intracellular molecule), delivering to inside brain (targeting transferrin receptor and a CNS disease mediator for crossing the blood-brain barrier). DVD-lg binding protein can also serve as a carrier protein to deliver an antigen to a specific location via binding to a non-neutralizing epitope of that antigen and also to increase the half-life of the antigen. Furthermore, DVD-lg binding protein can be designed to either be physically linked to medical devices implanted into patients or target these medical devices (see Burke et al. (2006)Advanced Drug Deliv. Rev. 58(3): 437-446; Hildebrand et al, (2006) Surface and Coatings Techno!. 200(22-23): 6318-6324; Drug/ device combinations for local drug therapies and infection prophylaxis, Wu (2006) Biomaterials 27(11):2450-2467; Mediation of the cytokine network in the implantation of orthopedic devices, Marques (2005) Biodegradable Systems in Tissue Engineer. Regen. Med. 377-397). Briefly, directing appropriate types of cell to the site of medical implant may promote healing and restoring normal tissue function. Alternatively, inhibition of mediators (including but not limited to cytokines), released upon device implantation by a DVD coupled to or target to a device is also provided. C. Use of binding proteins in various diseases [0173] Binding protein molecules provided herein are useful as therapeutic molecules to treat various diseases, e.g., wherein the targets that are recognized by the binding proteins are detrimental. Such binding proteins may bind one or more targets involved In a specific disease. Inhibition of ΐℓ-1β and/or IL-17 has also been shown to enhance anti-viral vaccines in animal models and may be beneficial in the treatment of HIV and other infectious diseases, for example, the human rhinovirus, other enteroviruses, coronavlrus, herpes viruses, influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus or adenovirus. [0174] Without limiting the disclosure, further information on certain disease conditions is provided. 1. Human autoimmune and inflammatory response [0175] IL-1 β and/or IL-17 have been implicated in general autoimmune and inflammatory responses, including, for example, asthma, allergies, allergic lung disease, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (CORD), fibrosis, cystic fibrosis (CF), fibrotic lung disease, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, liver fibrosis, lupus, hepatitis B-related liver diseases and fibrosis, sepsis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), glomerulonephritis, inflammatory skin diseases, psoriasis, diabetes, insulin dependent diabetes meliitus, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), ulcerative colitis (UC), Crohn’s disease (CD), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), osteoarthritis (ΟΑ), multiple sclerosis (MS), graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), transplant rejection, ischemic heart disease (IHD), celiac disease, contact hypersensitivity, alcoholic liver disease, Behcet’s disease, atherosclerotic vascular disease, occular surface inflammatory diseases, or Lyme disease. Accordingly, in some embodiments the binding proteins disclosed herein can be used to treat these conditions. [0176] The binding proteins provided herein can also be used to treat neurological disorders. In an embodiment, the binding proteins provided herein or antigen-binding portions thereof, are used to treat neurodegenerative diseases, and conditions involving neuronal regeneration and spinal cord injury. 2. Asthma [0177] Allergic asthma is characterized by the presence of eosinophiiia, goblet cell metaplasia, epithelial cell alterations, airway hyperreactivity (AHR), and Th2 and Th1 cytokine expression, as well as elevated serum IgE levels, Corticosteroids are the most important anti-inflammatory treatment for asthma today, however their mechanism of action is non-specific and safety concerns exist, especially in the juvenile patient population. The development of more specific and targeted therapies is therefore warranted. [0178] IL-1 β has been implicated as having a pivotal role in causing pathological responses associated with asthma. The development of anti-IL-ip mAb therapy to reduce the effects of IL-1 β in the lung is an exciting new approach that offers considerable promise as a novel treatment for asthma. However other mediators of differential immunological pathways are also involved in asthma pathogenesis, and blocking these mediators, in addition to IL-1 β, may offer additional therapeutic benefit. Such target pairs include, but are not limited to, IL-1 β and a pro-inflammatory cytokine, such as IL-17. There is growing evidence that IL-17 is involved in the pathogenesis of asthma. IL-17 induces the neutrophils into the airways and also enhances T-heiper 2 (Th2) cell-mediated eosinophilic airway inflammation in asthma. Recent studies have demonstrated that inhibitors and other diverse regulators of IL-17 reduce antigen-induced airway inflammation, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and Th2 cytokine levels in animal models of asthma (for a review see Park and Lee (2010) Respiratory Res., 11:78). Accordingly, in some embodiments the binding proteins disclosed herein can be used to treat asthma. [0179] Animal models such as an OVA-induced asthma mouse model, where both inflammation and AHR can be assessed, are known in the art and may be used to determine the ability of various binding protein molecules to treat asthma. Animal models for studying asthma are disclosed in Coffman, et al. (2005) J. Exp. Med. 201 (12): 1875-1879; Lloyd et al. (2001) Adv. Immunol. 77: 283-295; Boyce et al. (2005) J. Exp. Med, 201(12):1889-1873; and Snibson et al. (2005) J, Brit, Soc. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 35(2):146-52. In addition to routine safety assessments of these target pairs specific tests for the degree of immunosuppression may be warranted and helpful In selecting the best target pairs (see Luster et al. (1994) Toxicol. 92(1-3):229-43; Descotes et al. (1992) Dev. Biol, Standard. 77:99-102; Hart et al. (2001) J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 108(2):250-257). 3. Rheumatoid arthritis [0180] Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a systemic disease, is characterized by a chronic inflammatory reaction in the synovium of joints and is associated with degeneration of cartilage and erosion of juxta-articular bone. Many pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors are expressed in diseased joints. Recent studies indicate that the involvement of Τ cells in RA is mediated to a significant extent by IL-17. Animal studies have shown that markedly increased IL-17 expression was detected in mice that develop articular lesions resembling human RA. Beneficial effects of IL-17 blockade were also observed various animal models of the disease (for a review see Witowski et al. (2004) Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 61: 567-579). Whether a binding protein molecule will be useful for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis can be assessed using pre-clinical animal RA models such as the collagen-induced arthritis mouse model. Other useful models are also well known in the art (see Brand (2005) Comp. Med. 55(2): 114-22). Based on the cross-reactivity of the parental antibodies for human and mouse orthologues (e.g., reactivity for human and mouse TNF, human and mouse IL-15, etc.) validation studies in the mouse CIA model may be conducted with “matched surrogate antibody” derived binding protein molecules; briefly, a binding protein based on two (or more) mouse target specific antibodies may be matched to the extent possible to the characteristics of the parental human or humanized antibodies used for human binding protein construction (e.g., similar affinity, similar neutralization potency, similar half-life, etc.). Accordingly, in some embodiments the binding proteins disclosed herein can be used to treat rheumatoid arthritis. [0181] The initiation, maintenance, and progression of ΟΑ is mediated by a complex cascade of mechanical and biochemical pathways in which IL-1 plays a pivotal role . IL-1 α and IL-1 β are produced not only by monocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils, but by cells in joint tissues, such as chondrocytes, synovial fibroblasts, and osteoclasts (see, e.g., Dinarelio et al. (2009) Ann. Rev. Immunol. 27: 519-550). In vitro, IL-1 can stimulate chondrocytes and synoviocytes to produce proteinases involved in cartilage destruction leading to ΟΑ (see, e.g., Dayer et al. (1977) Science 195: 181-183; Dayer et al. (1984} Biochem. Pharmacol. 33: 2893-2899; McGuire-Goldring et al. (1984) Arthritis Rheum. 27: 654-662), as well as inhibit synthesis of proteoglycan and collagen type II, the main components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) of normal hyaline cartilage (see, e.g., Goldring et al. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262: 16724-16729; Goldring et al. (1988) J. Clin. Investig. 82: 2026-2037). Preclinicai and clinical studies have provided further evidence of IL-1 in the pathogenesis of ΟΑ. For example, intra-articular (ia) injection of IL-1 into animal knees resulted in leukocyte infiltration and cartilage loss (Petfiphar et al. (1986) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 83: 8749-8753}. In contrast, ia injection of IL-1 antagonist resulted in significant reduction in the progression of experimental ΟΑ (see, e.g., Pelletier et al. (1997) Arthritis Rheum. 40: 1012-1019; Caron et al. (1998) Arthritis Rheum. 39: 1535-1544); Fernandes et al. (1999) Am. J. Pathol, 154: 11590-11690); Zhang et al, (2006) Biochem. Biophys, Res. Commun, 341: 202-208). In addition, IL-1 knockout (ΚΟ) mice were found to be resistant to surgically induced cartilage damage when compared to their wild-type counterparts (Glasson et al. (2009) Osteoarthritis Cartilage, 18: 572-580). [0182] Both IL-1a and IL-1 β are expressed in synovial membranes, cartilage, and synovial fluid of human ΟΑ patients (see, e.g., Farahat et al. (1993) Ann. Rheum. Dis. 52: 870-875). The IL-1 antagonist, Anakinra, which is an IL-1 receptor antagonist, and AMG-108, which is an IL-1 receptor monoclonal antibody, have demonstrated some efficacy in ΟΑ trials with respect to symptoms and chondroprotection ("Results from a Randomized Controlled Trial of AMG 108 (a fully human monoclonal antibody to IL-1 R type I) in Patients With Osteoarthritis of the Knee" Cohen et al., ACR2007). Accordingly, in some embodiments the binding proteins disclosed herein can be used to treat osteoarthritis. 5. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) [0183] The immunopathogenic hallmark of SLE is the polyclonal Β ceil activation, which leads to byperglobulinemia, autoantibody production and immune complex formation. Significant increased levels of IL-17 have been detected in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (Morimoto et al. (2001) Autoimmunity, 34(1): 19-25; Wong et al. (2008) Clin Immunol. 127(3):385-93). IL-17 represents an important cytokine in the pathogenesis of SLE. Increased IL-17 production has been shown in patients with SLE as well as in animals with lupus-like diseases. Animal models have demonstrated that blockade of IL-17 decreases lupus manifestations (for a review see Nalbandian et al. (2009) 157(2): 209-215). Based on the cross-reactivity of the parental antibodies for human and mouse othologues (e.g., reactivity for human and mouse CD20, human and mouse interferon alpha, etc.) validation studies in a mouse lupus model may be conducted with “matched surrogate antibody” derived binding protein molecules. Briefly, a binding protein based two (or more) mouse target specific antibodies may be matched to the extent possible to the characteristics of the parental human or humanized antibodies used for human binding protein construction (e.g., similar affinity, similar neutralization potency, similar half-life, etc.}. Accordingly, in some embodiments the binding proteins disclosed herein can be used to treat SLE. 6. iVfuitsple sclerosis [0184] Multiple sclerosis (MS) Is a complex human autoimmune-type disease with a predominantly unknown etiology. Immunologic destruction of myelin basic protein (ΜΒΡ) throughout the nervous system is the major pathology of multiple sclerosis. Of major consideration are immunological mechanisms that contribute to the development of autoimmunity. In particular, antigen expression, cytokine and leukocyte interactions, and regulatory T-ceils, which help balance/modulate other Τceils such as Tb1 and Th2 cells, are important areas for therapeutic target identification. In MS, increased expression of IL-17 has been detected both in brain lesions and in mononuclear cells isolated from blood and cerebrospinal fluid. IL-17-producing ceils are extremely enriched in active MS lesions, suggesting that neutralization of this cytokine has the potential of being beneficial (for a review see Witowski et al. (2004) Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 61: 567-579). Accordingly, in some embodiments the binding proteins disclosed herein can be used to treat MS. [0185] Several animal models for assessing the usefulness of the binding proteins to treat MS are known in the art (see Steinman et al. (2005) Trends Immunol. 26(11 ):565-71 ; Lublin et al. (1985) Springer Semin, lmmunopathoi.8{3): 197-208; Genain et ai. (1997) J. Mol. Med. 75(3):187-97; Tuohy et al. (1999) J. Exp. Med. 189(7): 1033-42; Owens et ai. (1995) Neurol. Clin. 13(1):51-73; and Hart et al. (2005) J. Immunol. 175(7):4761 -8.) Based on the cross-reactivity of the parental antibodies for human and animal species othologues validation studies in the mouse ΕΑΕ model may be conducted with “matched surrogate antibody” derived binding protein molecules. Briefly, a binding protein based on two (or more) mouse target specific antibodies may be matched to the extent possible to the characteristics of the parental human or humanized antibodies used for human binding protein construction (e.g., similar affinity, similar neutralization potency, similar half-life, etc.). The same concept applies to animal models in other non-rodent species, where a “matched surrogate antibody" derived binding protein would be selected for the anticipated pharmacology and possibly safety studies. In addition to routine safety assessments of these target pairs specific tests for the degree of immunosuppression may be warranted and helpful in selecting the best target pairs (see Luster et al. (1994) Toxicol. 92(1-3): 229-43; Descotes et al, (1992) Devel. Bio!. Standard. 77: 99-102; Jones (2000) IDrugs 3(4):442-6). 7. Sepsis [0188] Overwhelming inflammatory and immune responses are essential features of septic shock and play a central part in the pathogenesis of tissue damage, multiple organ failure, and death induced by sepsis. Cytokines have been shown to be mediators of septic shock. These cytokines have a direct toxic effect on tissues; they also activate phospholipase Α2. These and other effects lead to increased concentrations of platelet-activating factor, promotion of nitric oxide synthase activity, promotion of tissue infiltration by neutrophiis, and promotion of neutrophil activity. IL-17 levels and ciinicai prognosis of sepsis have been shown to be negatively correlated. Neutralization of IL-17A can significantly improve the survival rate of patients with sepsis (see Flier! et al. (2008) FASEB J. 22: 2198-2205). [0187] One embodiment pertains to binding proteins capable of binding one or more targets involved in sepsis, such as, for example ΐℓ-1β and 11-17. The efficacy of such binding proteins for treating sepsis can be assessed in preciinical animal models known in the art (see Buras et al. (2005) Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 4(10):854-65 and Calandra et al. (2000} Nat. Med. 6(2): 164-70). Accordingly, in some embodiments the binding proteins disclosed herein can be used to treat sepsis. S. Neurological disorders a. Neurodegenerative diseases [0188] Neurodegenerative diseases are either chronic in which case they are usually age-dependent or acute (e.g., stroke, traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, etc.). They are characterized by progressive loss of neuronal functions (e.g., neuronal ceil death, axon loss, neuritic dystrophy, demyelination), loss of mobility and loss of memory. These chronic neurodegenerative diseases represent a complex Interaction between multiple ceil types and mediators. Treatment strategies for such diseases are limited and mostly constitute either blocking inflammatory processes with non-specific anti-inflammatory agents (e.g., corticosteroids, COX inhibitors) or agents to prevent neuron loss and/or synaptic functions. These treatments fas! to stop disease progression. Specific therapies targeting more than one disease mediator may provide even better therapeutic efficacy for chronic neurodegenerative diseases than observed with targeting a single disease mechanism (see Deane et al. (2003) Nature Med. 9:907-13; and Masliah et al. (2005) Neuron. 48:857). [0189] The binding protein molecules provided herein can bind one or more targets involved in chronic neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimers. The efficacy of binding protein molecules can be validated in pre-ciinical animal models such as the transgenic mice that over-express amyloid precursor protein or RAGE and develop Alzheimer’s disease-like symptoms, in addition, binding protein molecules can be constructed and tested for efficacy in the animal models and the best therapeutic binding protein can be selected for testing in human patients. Binding protein molecules can also be employed for treatment of other neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s disease. b. Meuronal regeneration and spinal cord injury [0190] Despite an increase in knowledge of the pathologic mechanisms, spinal cord injury (SCI) is still a devastating condition and represents a medical indication characterized by a high medical need. Most spinal cord injuries are contusion or compression Injuries and the primary injury is usually followed by secondary injury mechanisms (inflammatory mediators e.g., cytokines and chemokines) that worsen the initial injury and result in significant enlargement of the lesion area, sometimes more than 10-fold. IL-17 is a mediator of secondary degeneration, which contributes to neuroinflammation and hinders functional recovery. Studies using IL-17 ΚΟ mice have demonstrated that IL-17 contributes to neuroinflammatory responses and pain hypersensitivity following neuropathic injury (Kim and Moalem-Tayior (2010) J Pain. 12(3):370-83). IL-17 deficiency improves locomotor recovery and tissue sparing after spinal cord contusion injury in mice (Hill at al, (2011) Neurosci Lett. 487(3):383-7). Accordingly, in some embodiments the binding proteins disclosed herein can be used for neuronal regeneration and spinal cord repair. [0191] The efficacy of binding protein molecules can be validated in pre-ciinical animal models of spinal cord injury. In addition, these binding protein molecules can be constructed and tested for efficacy in the animal models and the best therapeutic binding protein can be selected for testing in human patients. In general, antibodies do not cross the blood brain barrier (ΒΒΒ) in an efficient and relevant manner. However, in certain neurologic diseases, e.g., stroke, traumatic brain injury, muitipie sclerosis, etc., the ΒΒΒ may be compromised and allows for increased penetration of binding proteins and antibodies into the brain. In other neurological conditions, where ΒΒΒ leakage is not occurring, one may employ the targeting of endogenous transport systems, including carrier-mediated transporters such as glucose and amino acid carriers and receptor-mediated transcytosismediating celi structures/receptors at the vascular endothelium of the ΒΒΒ, thus enabling trans-BBB transport of the binding protein. Structures at the ΒΒΒ enabling such transport include but are not limited to the insulin receptor, transferrin receptor, LRP and RAGE, in addition, strategies enable the use of binding proteins also as shuttles to transport potential drugs into the CNS including low molecular weight drugs, nanoparticles and nucleic acids (Coioma et al. (2000) Pbarm Res. 17(3):266-74; Boado et al. (2007) Bioconjug. Chem. 18(2):447-55). [0192] Monoclonal antibody therapy has emerged as an important therapeutic modality for cancer (von Mehren et al. (2003) Annu. Rev. Med. 54:343-69). The use of dual-specific antibody that targets two separate tumor mediators wiil likely give additional benefit compared to a mono-specific therapy. IL-17 has been suggested to support tumor growth, probably by stimulating angiogenesis. IL-1 β also plays an important role in the regulation of anti-tumor immunity and tumor growth. [0193] In an embodiment, diseases that can be treated or diagnosed with the compositions and methods provided herein include, but are not limited to, primary and metastatic cancers, including carcinomas of breast, colon, rectum, lung, oropharynx, hypopharynx, esophagus, stomach, pancreas, liver, gallbladder and bile ducts, small intestine, urinary tract (including kidney, bladder and urothelium), female genital tract (including cervix, uterus, and ovaries as well as choriocarcinoma and gestational trophoblastic disease), male genital tract (including prostate, seminal vesicles, testes and germ cell tumors), endocrine glands (including the thyroid, adrenal, and pituitary glands), and skin, as well as hemangiomas, melanomas, sarcomas (including those arising from bone and soft tissues as well as Kaposi’s sarcoma), tumors of the brain, nerves, eyes, and meninges (including astrocytomas, gliomas, glioblastomas, retinoblastomas, neuromas, neuroblastomas, Schwannomas, and meningiomas), solid tumors arising from hematopoietic malignancies such as leukemias, and lymphomas (both Hodgkin’s and non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas). [0194] in an embodiment, the antibodies and binding proteins provided herein or antigen-binding portions thereof, are used to treat cancer or in the prevention of metastases from the tumors described herein either when used alone or in combination with radiotherapy and/or other chemotherapeutic agents. 10.

In this embodiment, the nucleic acids produce their encoded antibody or prophylactic or therapeutic agent provided herein that mediates a prophylactic or therapeutic effect, [0196] Any of the methods for gene therapy available in the art can be used in the methods provided herein. For genera! reviews of the methods of gene therapy, see Goldspiel et a!. (1993) Clin. Pharmacy 12:488-505; Wu and Wu (1991) Biotherapy 3:87-95; Toistoshev (1993) Ann. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 32:573-596; Mulligan (1993) Science 260:926- 932; Morgan and Anderson (1993) Ann. Rev. Biochem. 62:191-217; and May (1993) TIBTECH 11(5): 155-215.

The term “dosage unit form” refers to physically discrete units suited as unitary dosages for the mammalian subjects to be treated; each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active compound calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. The specification for the dosage unit forms provided herein are dictated by and directly dependent on (a) the unique characteristics of the active compound and the particular therapeutic or prophylactic effect to be achieved, and (b) the limitations inherent in the art of compounding such an active compound for the treatment of sensitivity in individuals. An exemplary, non-limiting range for a therapeutically or prophylacticaliy effective amount of a binding protein provided herein is 0.1-20 mg/kg, for example, 1-10 mg/kg. It is to be noted that dosage values may vary with the type and severity of the condition to be aileviated. It is to be further understood that for any particular subject, specific dosage regimens may be adjusted over time according to the individual need and the professional judgment of the person administering or supervising the administration of the compositions, and that dosage ranges set forth herein are exemplary only and are not Intended to limit the scope or practice of the claimed composition.

A 20 pg/ml working stock of antibody (4χ concentrated) was prepared in complete MEM medium. An eight point serial dilution was performed (5 pg/ml~G,G003 pg/ml) in complete MEM in Marsh dilution plates. Seventy-five ul/well of each antibody dilution was added in quadruplicate to a 96 well v-bottom (Costar# 3894) plate and 75 μΐ of a 200 pg/ml solution of ΐℓ-1β. Control wells received 75 μΐ 200 pg/ml of ΐℓ-1β (4χ concentrated) plus 75 μ1 MEM media and media control wells received 150 μΐ of media. Following a 1 hour incubation, 100 μ1 of the Ab/Ag mixture was added to the MRC5 cells. All well volumes were equal to 200 μΐ. Ail plate reagents were then 1χ concentrated. After a 16-20 hour incubation, the well contents (150 μΐ) were transferred into a 98-weli round bottom plate (Costar# 3799) and placed in a ~-2Q°C freezer. The supernatants were tested for hll-8 levels by using a human IL-8 ELISA kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, ΜΝ) or hlL-8 chemiluminescence kit (MDS), Neutralization potency was determined by calculating percent inhibition relative to the ΐℓ-1β alone control value.

Example 2,2: IL~17 Bioassay and Neutralization Assay [0227] The human HS27 cel! line (ATCC #CRL~1634) secretes !L-6 in response to IL-17. The IL-17-induced IL-6 secretion is inhibited by neutralizing anti-IL-17 antibodies (See, e.g., J. Immunol. 155:5483-5486 (1995) or Cytokine 9:794-800 (1997)). [0228] HS27 ceils were maintained in assay medium (DMEM high glucose medium (Gibco #11965) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco#26140), 4 mM Lglutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, penicillin G (100 U/5Q0 ml) and streptomycin (100 pg/5Q0 ml)). Cells were grown in Τ150 flasks until they were about 80-90% confluent the day of the assay. Human IL-17 (R&D Systems, #317-IL/CF) was reconstituted in sterile PBS without Ca2+ and Mg2*, stored frozen, freshly thawed for use and diluted to 40 ng/ml (4Χ) in assay medium. Serial dilutions of antibodies were made in a separate plate (4Χ concentrations), mixed with an equal volume of 40ng/ml (4Χ) of human IL-17 and incubated at 37°C for 1 hour. HS27 cells (typically about 20,000 cells in 50 μΐ assay medium) were added to each well of a 96-well flat-bottom tissue culture plate (Costar #3599), followed by the addition of 50 pi of the pre-incubated antibody or DVD-lg protein plus IL-17 mix. The final concentration of SL-17 was 10ng/mi. Cells were incubated for about 24 hours at 37°C. The media supernatants were then collected. The level of !L-17 neutralization was measured by determination of IL-6 amounts in supernatant using a commercial Meso Scale Discovery kit according to manufacturer's instructions. IC50 values were obtained using logarithm of antibody or DVD-lg protein vs. IL-6 amount variable slope fit. See Table 4.

Example 2.3: Affinity Determination Using BiACORE Technology Table S: Reagents Used in Biacore Analyses | Antigen Vendor Designation Vendor Catalog # R&D I IL-17 Recombinant Human IL-17 systems 317-IL | IL~1b Recombinant Human !L-1b R&D systems 201-LB BIACORE Methods: [0229] The BIACORE assay (GE, Healthcare Piscataway, NJ) determined the affinity of antibodies or DVD-lg proteins with kinetic measurements of on~rate and off-rate constants. Binding of antibodies or DVD-!g proteins to a target antigen (for example, a purified recombinant target antigen) was determined by surface plasmon resonance-based measurements with a Biacore Τ200 using running HBS-EP + buffer from GE Healthcare at 25°C. All chemicals were obtained from GE Healthcare unless otherwise described. For example, approximately 5000 RU of goat anti-mouse IgG, (Fey), fragment specific polyclonal antibody (Pierce Biotechnology Inc, Rockford, II) diluted In 10 mM sodium acetate (pH 4.5) was directly immobilized across a GM5 research grade biosensor chip using a standard amine coupling kit according to manufacturer's instructions. Unreacted moieties on the biosensor surface were blocked with ethanolamine. Modified carboxymethyi dextran surface in flowcell 1 was used as a reference surface. Rate constants were derived by making kinetic binding measurements at different antigen concentrations ranging from 0.8-100 ηΜ. Binding was recorded as a function of time and kinetic rate constants were calculated. In this assay, association rate was evaluated for 5 minutes and dissociation was monitored for 10 minutes. For kinetic screening analysis, rate equations derived from the 1:1 binding model were fitted simultaneously to association and dissociation phases of all injections (using global fit analysis with Rmax fit locally to account for capture variations) with the use of Biaevaluation software. Purified antibodies or DVD-lg proteins were diluted in HEPES-buffered saline for capture across goat anti-mouse IgG specific reaction surfaces. Antibodies or DVD-ig proteins to be captured as a ligand were injected over reaction matrices at a flow rate of 5 pl/minute. The association and dissociation rate constants, kon (M''s‘') and koff (s“1) were determined under a continuous flow rate of 50fii/minute. Rate constants were derived by making kinetic binding measurements at different antigen concentrations ranging from 0.8-100 ηΜ. Binding was recorded as a function of time and kinetic rate constants were calculated. In this assay, association rate was evaluated for 5 minutes and dissociation was monitored for 10 minutes. See Table 8. Table 6: BIACORE Analysis of Parental Antibodies and DVD-lg Proteins Ail DVD-lg proteins characterized by Biacore technology exhibited binding. All variable domains bound with similar high affinity as the parent antibodies. Example 3: Characterization Of Antibodies and DVD-lg Proteins [0230] The ability of purified DVD-lg protein to inhibit a functional activity was determined, e.g., using the cytokine bioassay as described in Examples 2.1 and 2.2. The binding affinities of the DVD-!g protein to recombinant human antigen were determined using surface piasmon resonance (Biacore©) measurement as described in Example 2.3. The ICSD values from the bioassays and the affinity of the antibodies and DVD-lg proteins were ranked. The DVD-ig protein that most fuily maintain the activity of the parent mAbs were selected as candidates for future development. The top two to three DVD-lg proteins exhibiting the most favorable properties were further characterized. Example 3.1: Pharmacokinetic Analysis Of Humanized Antibodies or DVD-lg Protein [0231] Pharmacokinetic studies are carried out in Sprague-Dawiey rats and cynomolgus monkeys. Male and female rats and cynomolgus monkeys are dosed intravenously or subcutaneously with a single dose of 4mg/kg mAb or DVD-lg protein and samples are analyzed using antigen capture ELISA, and pharmacokinetic parameters are determined by noncompartmentai analysis. Briefly, ELISA plates are coated with goat anti-biotin antibody (5 mg/ml, 4°C, overnight), blocked with Superblock (Pierce), and incubated with biotinylated human antigen at 50 ng/ml in 10% Superbiock TIBS at room temperature for 2 hours. Serum samples are serially diluted (0.5% serum, 10% Superblock in TTBS) and incubated on the plate for 30 minutes at room temperature. Detection is carried out with HRP-iabeled goat anti human antibody and concentrations are determined with the help of standard curves using the four parameter logistic fit. Values for the pharmacokinetic parameters are determined by non-compartmental model using WinNoniin software (Pharsight Corporation, Mountain View, CA). Humanized mAbs with good pharmacokinetics profile (Τ1/2 is 8-13 days or better, with low clearance and excellent bioavailability 50-100%) are selected. Example 3.2: Physicochemical And In Vitro Stability Analysis Of Humanized Monoclonal Antibodies and DVD-ig Proteins Size Exclusion Chromatography [0232] Antibodies or DVD-lg proteins were diluted to 2.5 mg/mL with water and 20 mL was analyzed on a Shimadzu HPLC system using a TSK ge! G3000 SWXL column (Tosoh Bioscience, cat# k5539-05k). Samples were eluted from the column with 211 mM sodium sulfate, 92 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.0. at a flow rate of 0.3 mL/minutes. The HPLC system operating conditions were as follows: [0233] Mobile phase: 211 mM Na2S04l 92 mM Na2HP04*7H2G, pH 7.0 [0234] Gradient: Isocratic [0235] Flow rate: 0.3 mL/minute [0238] Detector wavelength: 280 nm [0237] Autosampler cooler temp: 4°C [0238] Column oven temperature: Ambient [0239] Run time: 50 minutes [0240] Table 7 contains purity data of parent antibodies and DVD-!g proteins expressed as percent monomer (unaggregated protein of the expected molecular weight) as determined by the above protocol.

This DVD-lg protein profile was similar to that observed for parent antibodies. [0241] Antibodies and DVD-lg proteins are analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) under both reducing and non-reducing conditions. Adafimumab lot AFP04C is used as a control. For reducing conditions, the samples are mixed 1:1 with 2Χ tris glycine SDS-PAGE sample buffer (Invitrogen, cat# LC2676, lot# 1323208) with 100 mM DTT, and heated at 6QX for 30 minutes. For non-reducing conditions, the samples are mixed 1:1 with sample buffer and heated at 100°C for 5 minutes. The reduced samples (10 mg per lane) are loaded on a 12% pre-cast tris-giycine gel (Invitrogen, cat# EC6005box, lot# 8111021), and the non-reduced samples (10 mg per lane) are loaded on an 8%~18% pre-cast tris-giycine gel (Invitrogen, cat# EC6045box, lot# 6111021). SeeBlue Plus 2 (Invitrogen, cat#LC5925, lot# 1351542) is used as a molecular weight marker. The gels are run in a XCell Surelock mini cell gel box (Invitrogen, cat# Ε10001) and the proteins are separated by first applying a voltage of 75 to stack the samples in the gel, followed by a constant voltage of 125 until the dye front reached the bottom of the gel. The running buffer used is 1Χ tris glycine SDS buffer, prepared from a 10Χ tris glycine SDS buffer (ABC, MPS-79-080106)). The gels are stained overnight with colloidal blue stain (Invitrogen cat# 48-7015, 46-7016) and destained with Milli-G water until the background is clear. The stained gels are then scanned using an Epson Expression scanner (model 1880, S/N DASX003641). Sedimentation Velocity Analysis [0242] Antibodies or DVD-lg proteins are loaded into the sample chamber of each of three standard two-sector carbon epon centerpieces. These centerpieces have a 1.2 cm optical path length and are built with sapphire windows. PBS is used for a reference buffer and each chamber contained 140 μℓ. All samples are examined simultaneously using a 4~ho!e (AN-8QTI) rotor in a Beckman Proteomelab XL-I analytical uitracentrifuge (serial # PL108C01). [0243] Run conditions are programmed and centrifuge control is performed using Proteomelab (ν5.δ). The samples and rotor are allowed to thermally equilibrate for one hour prior to analysis (20.0 ± 0.1 °C). Confirmation of proper cell loading is performed at 3000 rpm and a single scan is recorded for each cell. The sedimentation velocity conditions are the following: [0244] Sample Cell Volume: 420 ml [0245] Reference Cel! Volume: 420 mL [0248] Temperature: 20°C [0247] Rotor Speed: 35,000 rpm [0248] Time: 8:00 hours [0249] UV Wavelength: 280 nm [0250] Radial Step Size: 0.003 cm [0251] Data Collection: One data point per step without signal averaging. [0252] Total Number of Scans: 100 LC-MS molecular weight measurement of intact antibodies [0253] Molecular weight of intact antibodies and DVD-lg proteins are analyzed by LC-MS. Each antibody or DVD-lg protein is diluted to approximately 1 mg/mL with water. An 1100 HPLC (Agilent) system with a protein microtrap (Michrom Bioresources, Inc, cat# 004/25109/03) is used to desalt and Introduce 5 mg of the sample into an API Qstar pulsar i mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems). A short gradient is used to elute the samples. The gradient is run with mobile phase A (0.08% FA, 0.02% TFA in HPLC water) and mobile phase Β (0.08% FA and 0.02% TFA in acetonitrile) at a flow rate of 50 mL/minute. The mass spectrometer is operated at 4.5 kvoSts spray voltage with a scan range from 2000 to 3500 mass to charge ratio. LC-WtS Molecular Weight Measurement of Antibody and DVD-ig Protein Light and Heavy Chains [0254] Molecular weight measurement of antibody and D\/D-!g protein light chain (LC), heavy chain (HC) and degiycosylated HC are analyzed by LC-MS. Antibodies and DVD~lg proteins are diluted to 1 mg/mL with water and the sample is reduced to LC and HC with a final concentration of 10 mM DTT for 30 minutes at 37°C. To deglycosylate the antibodies and DVD-lg proteins, 100 mg of the antibody or DVD-ig protein is incubated with 2 ml of PNGase F, 5 mL of 10% N-octylg!ucoside in a total volume of 100 mL overnight at 37 °C. After degiycosylation the sample is reduced with a final concentration of 10 mM DTT for 30 minutes at 37Χ. An Agilent 1100 HPLC system with a C4 column (Vydac, cat# 214ΤΡ5115, S/N 080206537204069) is used to desalt and introduce the sample (5 mg) into an API Qstar pulsar i mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems). A short gradient is used to elute the sample. The gradient is run with mobile phase A {0.08% FA, 0.02% TFA in HPLC water) and mobile phase Β (0.08% FA and 0.02% TFA in acetonitrile) at a flow rate of 50 mL/minute. The mass spectrometer is operated at 4.5 kvoits spray voltage with a scan range from 800 to 3500 mass to charge ratio. Peptide Mapping [0255] The antibody or DVD-lg protein is denatured for 15 minutes at room temperature with a final concentration of 6 Μ guanidine hydrochloride in 75 mM ammonium bicarbonate. The denatured samples are reduced with a final concentration of 10 mM DTT at 37°C for 60 minutes, followed by alkylation with 50 mM iodoacetic acid (lAA) in the dark at 37°C for 30 minutes. Following alkylation, the sample is dialyzed overnight against four liters of 10 mM ammonium bicarbonate at 4°C. The dialyzed sample is diluted to 1 mg/mL with 10 mM ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.8 and 100 mg of antibody or DVD-lg protein is either digested with trypsin (Promega, cat# V5111) or Lys-C (Roche, cat# 11 047 825 001) at a 1:20 (w/w) trypsin/Lys-C:antibody or DVD-lg protein ratio at 37°C for 4 hours. Digests are quenched with 1 mL of 1 Ν HCI. For peptide mapping with mass spectrometer detection, 40 mL of the digests are separated by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (RPHPLC) on a C18 column (Vydac, cat# 218ΤΡ51, S/N ΝΕ9608 10.3.5) with an Agilent 1100 HPLC system. The peptide separation is run with a gradient using mobile phase A (0.02% TFA and 0.08% FA in HPLC grade water) and mobile phase Β (0.02% TFA and 0.08% FA in acetonitrile) at a flow rate of 50 mL/minutes. The API QSTAR Pulsar i mass spectromer is operated in positive mode at 4.5 kvolts spray voltage and a scan range from 800 to 2500 mass to charge ratio. Disuifide Bond trapping [0256] To denature the antibody, 100 ml of the antibody or DVD-lg protein is mixed with 300 ml of 8 IV! guanidine HCI in 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate. The pH is checked to ensure that it is between 7 and 8 and the samples are denatured for 15 minutes at room temperature in a final concentration of 6 Μ guanidine HCI. A portion of the denatured sample (100 ml) is diiuted to 800 ml with Milli-G water to give a final guanidine-HCI concentration of 1 Μ. The sampie (220 mg) is digested with either trypsin (Promega, cat # V5111, lot# 22265901) or Lys-C (Roche, cat# 11047825001, lot# 12808000) at a 1:50 trypsin or 1:50 Lys-C: antibody or DVD-lg protein (w/w) ratios (4.4 mg enzyme: 220 mg sampie) at 37°C for approximately 16 hours. An additional 5 mg of trypsin or Lys-C is added to the samples and digestion is aliowed to proceed for an additional 2 hours at 37°C. Digestions are stopped by adding 1 ml of TFA to each sample. Digested samples are separated by RPHPLC using a C18 column (Vydac, cat# 218ΤΡ51 S/IN NE02G630-4-1A) on an Agilent HPLC system. The separation is run with the same gradient used for peptide mapping using mobile phase A (0.02% TFA and 0.08% FA in HPLC grade water) and mobile phase Β (0.02% TFA and 0.08% FA in acetonitrile) at a flow rate of 50 mL/minute. The HPLC operating conditions are the same as those used for peptide mapping. The API QSTAR Pulsar i mass spectromer is operated in positive mode at 4.5 kvolts spray voltage and a scan range from 800 to 2500 mass-to-charge ratio. Disulfide bonds are assigned by matching the observed MWs of peptides with the predicted MWs of tryptic or Lys-C peptides linked by disulfide bonds. Free Suifhydry! Determination [0257] The method used to quantify free cysteines in an antibody or DVD-lg protein is based on the reaction of Eliman’s reagent, 5,50- dithio-bis (2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB), with suifhydryi groups (SH) which gives rise to a characteristic chromophoric product, 5-thio-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (ΤΝΒ). The reaction is illustrated in the formula: [0258] DTNB + RSH ® RS-TNB + ΤΝΒ- + Η+ [0259] The absorbance of the ΤΝΒ- is measured at 412 nm using a Cary 50 spectrophotometer. An absorbance curve is plotted using dilutions of 2 mercaptoethanol (b-ME) as the free SH standard and the concentrations of the free sulfhydryi groups in the protein are determined from absorbance at 412 nm of the sample. [0260] The b-ME standard stock is prepared by a serial dilution of 14.2 Μ b-ΜΕ with HPLC grade water to a final concentration of 0,142 mM, Then standards in triplicate for each concentration are prepared. Antibody or DVD-Ig protein is concentrated to 10 mg/mL using an amicon ultra 10,000 MWCO centrifugal filter (Millipore, cat# UFC801096, lot# L3KN5251) and the buffer is changed to the formulation buffer used for adalimumab (5.57 mM sodium phosphate monobasic, 8.69 mM sodium phosphate dibasic, 106.69 mM NaCi, 1.07 mM sodium citrate, 6.45 mM citric acid, 66.68 mM mannitol, pH 5.2, 0.1% (w/v) Tween). The samples are mixed on a shaker at room temperature for 20 minutes. Then 180 ml of 100 mM Tris buffer, pH 8.1 is added to each sample and standard followed by the addition of 300 ml of 2 mM DTNB in 10 mM phosphate buffer, pH 8.1. After thorough mixing, the samples and standards are measured for absorption at 412 nm on a Cary 50 spectrophotometer. The standard curve is obtained by plotting the amount of free SH and OD412 nm of the b-ME standards. Free SH content of samples are calculated based on this curve after subtraction of the blank. Weak Cation Exchange Chromatography [0261] Antibody or DVD-Ig protein is diluted to 1 mg/mL with 10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6.0. Charge heterogeneity is analyzed using a Shimadzu HPLC system with a WCX-10 ProPac analytical column (Dionex, cat# 054993, S/N 02722). The samples are loaded on the column in 80% mobile phase A (10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6.0) and 20% mobile phase Β (10 mM sodium phosphate, 500 mM NaCI, pH 6.0) and eluted at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/minute. Oligosaccharide Profiling [0262] Oligosaccharides released after PNGase F treatment of antibody or DVD-Ig protein are derivatized with 2-aminobenzamide (2-ΑΒ) labeling reagent. The fluorescent-labeled oligosaccharides are separated by normal phase high performance liquid chromatography (NPHPLC) and the different forms of oligosaccharides are characterized based on retention time comparison with known standards. [0263] The antibody or DVD-lg protein is first digested with PNGaseF to cleave N-linked oligosaccharides from the Fc portion of the heavy chain. The antibody or DVD-lg protein (200 mg) is placed in a 500 ml Eppendorf tube along with 2 ml PNGase F and 3 ml of 10% N-octylglucoside, Phosphate buffered saline is added to bring the final volume to 60 ml. The sample is incubated overnight at 37°C in an Eppendorf fhermomixer set at 700 RPM. Adaiimumab lot AFP04C is also digested with PNGase F as a control. [0264] After PNGase F treatment, the samples are incubated at 95°C for 5 minutes in an Eppendorf thermomixer set at 750 RPM to precipitate out the proteins, then the samples are placed in an Eppendorf centrifuge for 2 minutes at 10,000 RPM to spin down the precipitated proteins. The supernatent containing the oligosaccharides are transferred to a 500 ml Eppendorf tube and dried in a speedvac at 65°C. [0265] The oligosaccharides are iabeled with 2ΑΒ using a 2ΑΒ labeling kit purchased from Prozyme (cat# GKK-404, lot# 132026). The labeling reagent is prepared according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Acetic acid (150 ml, provided in kit) is added to the DMSO vial (provided in kit) and mixed by pipeting the solution up and down several times. The acetic acid/DMSO mixture (100 ml) is transferred to a vial of 2-AB dye (just prior to use) and mixed until the dye is fully dissolved. The dye solution is then added to a vial of reductant (provided in kit) and mixed well (labeling reagent). The labeling reagent (5 ml) is added to each dried oligosaccharide sample vial, and mixed thoroughly. The reaction vials are placed in an Eppendorf thermomixer set at 65°C and 700-800 RPM for 2 hours of reaction. [0266] After the labeling reaction, the excess fluorescent dye is removed using GlycoClean S Cartridges from Prozyme (cat# GKl-4726). Prior to adding the samples, the cartridges are washed with 1 ml of ml!ii~Q water followed with 5 ishes of 1 ml 30% acetic acid solution. Just prior to adding the samples, 1 ml of acetonitrile (Burdick and Jackson, cat# ΑΗ015-4) is added to the cartridges. [0267] After all of the acetonitrile passes through the cartridge, the sample is spotted onto the center of the freshly washed disc and allowed to adsorb onto the disc for 10 minutes. The disc is washed with 1 mL of acetonitrile followed by five ishes of 1 ml of 96% acetonitrile. The cartridges are placed over a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube and the 2-AB labeled oligosaccharides are eluted with 3 ishes (400 ml each ish) of miili G water. [0268] The oligosaccharides are separated using a Glycosep Ν HPLC (cat# GKi-4728) column connected to a Shimadzu HPLC system. The Shimadzu HPLC system consisted of a system controller, degasser, binary pumps, autosampler with a sample cooler, and a fluorescent detector. Stability at Elevated Temperatures [0269] The buffer of antibody or DVD-lg protein is either 5.57 rniVS sodium phosphate monobasic, 8.69 mM sodium phosphate dibasic, 106.69 mM SMaCI, 1.07 mM sodium citrate, 6.45 mM citric acid, 66.68 mM mannitol, 0.1% (w/v) Tween, pH 5.2; or 10 mM histidine, 10 mM methionine, 4% mannitol, pH 5.9 using Amicon ultra centrifugal filters. The final concentration of the antibodies or DVD~lg proteins is adjusted to 2 mg/mL with the appropriate buffers. The antibody or DVD-lg protein solutions are then filter sterized and 0.25 mL aliquots are prepared under sterile conditions. The aliquots are left at either -80°C, 5°C, 25°C, or 40°C for 1, 2 or 3 weeks. At the end of the incubation period, the samples are analyzed by size exciusion chromatography and SDS-PAGE. [0270] The stability sampies are analyzed by SDS-PAGE under both reducing and non-reducing conditions. The procedure used is the same as described herein. The gels are stained overnight with colloidal blue stain (Invitrogen cat# 46-7015, 46-7016) and destained with Milli-Q water until the background is clear. The stained gels are then scanned using an Epson Expression scanner (model 1680, S/N DASX003641). To obtain more sensitivity, the same gels are silver stained using silver staining kit (Owl Scientific) and the recommended procedures given by the manufacturer is used. Dynamic Scanning Ffuorimetry [0271] The DVD-Igs proteins were dialysed in 1GmM citrate 10mM phosphate buffer, pH 6.0 to get a final concentration of 1 mg/m!. Triplicates were run for each DVD-lg protein. For each sample, 27 μΐ of the DVD-lg protein was added in a well of a 96 well plate and mixed with 3 μΐ of 4Χ diluted SYPRO Orange dye (Invitrogen). The dye is supplied in DMSO at a concentration of 5Q00X and was diluted to the working concentration of 4Χ in water. The plate was centrifuged for 30 seconds to ensure that both the dye and the protein settle to the bottom of the wells and complete mixing was ensured by gentle aspiration by a pipette tip. The plate was then sealed with an adhesive film. [0272] A real time PCR (Applied Biosciences, 7500 Series) was used for measuring the change in fluorescence intensities with temperature. The plate was heated from 25° C to 95° C at a temperature ramp rate of approximately 0,5°C/minute and emission fluorescence was collected using TAMRA filter. The data was exported to Microsoft Excel and plotted as temperature vs fluorescence for each DVD-lg protein. Onset of melting was noted as the temperature where the thermogram rises above the baseline fluorescence. SYPRO Orange is a hydrophobic dye and preferentially binds to the exposed hydrophobic residues in an unfolded protein molecule. Hence the onset of unfolding temperature, as measured by an increase in fluorescence, is an indication of the thermal stability of the DVD-!g protein. The unfolding temperature for the DVD-lg proteins can be found in Table 8.

This DVD-lg protein profile is similar to that observed for parent antibodies. Solubility Determination [0274] DVD-lg protein candidates were dialyzed in 15η∩Μ His, pH 8.0. This was followed by concentrating them upto 50 μΐ in centricons with a 30Κ cutoff. Solubility was visually confirmed by absence of precipitation after storage at 4°C and quantitatively determined by UV absorbance measurement at 2SGnm, See Table 9 (“ppt” Indicates precipitation).

This DVD-lg protein profile Is similar to that observed for parent antibodies. Example 4: Screening Funnel [0278] in an effort to generate 1ℓ-1β/1ℓ-17 DVD-lg binding proteins with druglike properties, a large panel of DVD-lg binding proteins was generated, including DVD-lg binding proteins containing one of five different anti-SL-1 β variable domains (Ε26,13, Ε28.35, 1Β12.1, 1Β12.3, 1Β12.6), one of three different anti-il-17 variable domains (1GF7M11, Β6-5, Β6-17), one of three different linker combinations (SS, LS, SL), and one of two orientations (i.e., IL-17 as the inner or outer variabie domain binding site) were made and screened by size exclusion chromatography (SEC), affinity, potency and preformulation analysis. None of the DVD-lg binding proteins achieved the desired threshold for all the preformulation criteria. [0277] Based on the information from the initial screening of DVD-lg binding proteins, a small pane! of additional DVD-lg binding proteins was prepared. DVD-lg binding proteins contained anti-IL-1 β variable domains Ε28.13 or Ε26.35 and anti-IL-17 variable domains B8-5G or B8-17G, an Χ1 linker on both the heavy and light chains comprising Gly~Ser repeats (referred to as a “GS” linker), and only one orientation (inner variable domains forming a binding site for: il-17 and outer variable domains forming a binding site for: ΐℓ-1β). The anti-IL-17 variable domains (B8-5G, B6-17G) were engineered from prior il~17 variable domains Β6-5 and Β6-17, with an Ν to G mutation at HC-CDR3 to eliminate a deamidation site. The DVD-lg binding proteins were screened in an IL-1 β potency assay for IL-8 release in a human foreskin fibroblast MRC-5 cel! line, and in an IL-17 potency assay for IL-8 release in human fetal lung fibroblast HS27 cells. As shown in Table 10, DVD3415 and DVD3418 exhibited high potency in neutralizing both ΐℓ-1β and IL-17 activity, with IC50 at low ρΜ range. The data provided in Table 10 reflects mean +/- standard deviation from 2 experiments for IL-1 β and from 3-4 experiments for IL-17. Of the tested DVD-lg binding proteins, DVD3415 and DVD3418 exhibited IL-17 potency values that were closest to the parental antibodies.

DVD3415 and DVD3418 were stable at high concentration in a liquid formulation of 15mM histidine, pH 5.5. CnteFia ■kffcoLy (DSC) (if1' fC) f-ie^ia'Ttes Sfjbf&y tosAW post: WTffi 1 HSjftf!!. tell.

Both share the same anti-IL-17 variable region (B6-17G) and a similar anti-IL-1 β variable region (Ε26.13 in DVD3415 and Ε26.35 in DVD3418). Ε26.35 only differs from Ε26,13 in the heavy chain (HC) by 4 amino acid residues (one in CDR3 and 3 in FR3). Surprisingly, DVD3418, containing Ε28.35 as its anti-IL-1 β domain, exhibited higher potency and possessed more germline sequences as compared to DVD3415, containing Ε28,13 as its anti-IL-1 β domain. Thus, DVD3418 was selected for further evaluation. [0280] Accordingly, additional formulation testing was performed for DVD3418. When formulated in 15 mM histidine, pH 5.5, a dose of 100 mg/mi DVD3418 exhibitied favorable physicochemical characteristics, including solubility, viscosity, and stability on freeze thaw. Onset of melting (Le., unfolding) of the DVD-lg was measured using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Freeze/tbaw stability was measured by evaluating the percentage increase in high molecular weight (HMW) products after four rounds of freeze thaw. Accelerated stability was evaluated by measuring monomer loss after incubation for 21-28 days at 25°C and 4Q°C. The physicochemical properties of DVD3418 are summarized in Table 12 below, and compared against threshold criteria for each property (cP = centipoise, Ton = melting temperature).

These other DVD-lg binding proteins ai! have different tinker sequences, and linker sequences can affect the physicochemical properties of a binding protein, since the overall sequence, including the variable domains and the linker, may determine the physicochemical properties of a DVD-lg molecule.

DVD3418 neutralized cyno monkey 1ℓ-1β at comparable potency to human ΐℓ-1β, rabbit BL-1 p at ~100-fold less potency, mouse IL-1 β at ~100G-fo!d less potency, and failed to neutralize rat ΐℓ-1β at the highest test concentration 500 ηΜ (see Table 14). DVD3418 also neutralized cyno monkey IL-17 with an IC50 within a 2-foid range of human iL-17, rabbit IL-17 with ~50-fo!d less potency, and rat and mouse IL-17 with at least 200-fold less potency, as compared to human IL-17 (see Table 14).

Example 5: In vivo testing [0284] DVD3418 was tested for half-life and immunogencity in rat and cynomoigus monkey. The pharmacokinetic parameters after intravenous administration of a 5mg/kg dose to Sprage Dawley rats are shown in Table 15 below (ΐ·ΐ/2= half ife, Cmax = maximum serum concentration, Vss = volume of distribution at steady state, AUC = area under curve, CLp = plasma clearance, MRT = mean residence time). DVD3418 displayed a long half-life (approximately 10 days), a moderate CL (approximately 0,37 ml/h/kg), and a small Vss (approximately 113 ml/kg). One animal was omitted when determining these averages due to probable ADA.

DVD3418 exhibited a long half-life, a low clearance rate, and a small Vss; no apparent ADA (anti-drug antibodies) were observed. Based on this, the DVD-lg binding protein may be suitable for less frequent dosing without requiring further half-life extending mutations.
