FRICTION REDUCER COMPOSITIONS COMPRISING AN ACRYLAMIDE POLYMER AND A SILICON POLYETHER CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS [0001] The present application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/824,663 filed May 17, 2013, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention [0002] The present invention relates to polyacrylamides, and more particularly ionic polyacrylamides aided by silicon polyether copolymers for use as, for example, friction or drag reducers used in water based hydraulic fracturing fluid, water purification and drilling mud additives. Background of the Art [0003] Polyacrylamides (PAM) are widely used as soil stabilizers, water purifier and friction reducers in agriculture, water and oil & gas industries, respectively. In the oil & gas industry, PAMs are used as additives in fracturing (fracking) and drilling applications. In fracturing, a large volume of water is injected, under high pressure into the formation in order to fracture the rock formation (shale, sandstone, limestone, etc.) and this way deliberating crude oil and/or natural gas from the pores. In hydraulic fracturing applications, high molecular weight anionic and cationic polyacrylamides are used as friction reducers where the hydrated polymer suppresses the turbulence present in high velocity gradient water. Since hydraulic fracturing is performed at very high injection rate, reduction of pumping pressure as a results of friction reduction will result in less power consumption by the pumps and thus the use of effective fri ction reducers in the fracturing fluid can decrease the cost of the operation by a large margin. [0004] The polyacrylamide molecules are sensitive to high shear, temperature and the ionic strength of the water used to solubilize them. At very high shear rate high molecular weight polyacrylamides are susceptible to breakdown into smaller chains. At high temperature and in alkaline conditions polyacrylamides hydrolyze to form acrylate fractions in the polymer chains, which produce negative charges on the polymer chains. The degree of hydrolysis increases with the temperature. Hydrolyzed polyacrylamides can remain stable in aqueous solutions in the absence of multivalent cations, such as Ca2Y Mg2v, Fe’“, etc. However, as the concentration of these ions increases in water, the hydrolyzed polymers become more susceptible to form a complex with these ions and precipitate out from the water solution. The precipitated polyacrylamides do not hydrate effectively and the friction reduction diminishes. The, precipitated polyacrylamide clusters or particles can also damage the rock formations leading to reduced production of crude oil and/or natural gas. [0005] In many of the fracturing jobs where fresh water is not accessible, formation water, frac fluid flow back water or recycled frac flow back water is frequently used. This water contains high concentration of monovalent and multivalent cations and anions. Therefore, a higher amount of friction reducer is needed to achieve the desired hydration of the polymer and friction reduction in such water. Increasing demand for fracturing water leads to consumption of more fresh water resources. Therefore, friction reducers, which can perform in all kinds of water, are desired. [0006] The present invention discloses new friction reducer compositions for water based liquids comprising an ionic polyacrylamide and a silicon polyether, which are capable of delivering foster inversion of polyacrylamide emulsion and better hydration of the polymer chains needed to achieve maximum friction reduction in the brines consisting of high amount of monovalent cations, monovalent anions and multivalent cations. The silicon polyether copolymers disclosed in this invention are designed to be compatible with polyacrylamide emulsions.

[0003.3] The present invention provides herein a friction reducer composition for water based liquids comprising a) an ionic polyacrylamide and b) a silicon polyether. [00034] Component “a” of the aqueous friction reducer composition of the present invention is ionic polyacrylamide in an emulsion or in solid form. Anionic polyacrylamide is a copolymer of acrylamide and sodium acrylate monomers, which is also known as hydrolyzed polyacrylamide (HPAM) as shown in Schemes 1 and 2 below. These schemes illustrate polymer synthetic routes and structures. Synthetic procedures are well established in the literature. This category of polymers carries an overall negative charge due to the presence of acrylate or sulfonate fraction. About 5*95% of the co-monomers carry negative charge on the polymer backbone depending upon the monomers ratio used for polymerization. Cationic polyacrylamides (CPAM) are synthesized from acrylamide and a monomer containing quaternary ammonium group as shown in Scheme 3, which is shown to illustrate a polymer synthetic route and structure. The synthetic route is well established in literature. The ammonium groups contribute a positive charge in this category of polymers. [00035] Inverse emulsions of polyacrylamides (water-in-oil or w/o emulsions) are those in which the continuous phase is oil and the polyacrylamide is present in the aqueous emulsion drops (dispersed phase). Inverse emulsions of polyacrylamides are frequently used as friction reducers. When the inverse emulsion is diluted with water or brine then it inverts and the aqueous drop phase will deliver the polymers in the water or brine. An advantage of the water-in-oil emulsion form is that the polyacrylamide is partially hydrated in the aqueous drop phase and thus it will easier hydrated further, without making the emulsion highly viscous. Nevertheless even this hydration process takes time with the large polymers used here. X Ν:·:(;Η. q- Ν Hydrolyzed Poly acrylamide (ΗΡΑΜ) Scheme 1.

These abbreviations are also used in this document. [00038] Typical monovalent cations are NH4\ Li+, Na y K”, Rhr, and Cs* , typical divalent cations are Be24, Mg2\ Ca2t, Sr2*, Ba2+, Fe^+, CUC Zn2+; and typical trivalent cations are FeJ r, AS3', etc. Typical monovalent anions are F', CF, Br, NO3', HCQU HSCV; and divalent anions are SO4U, CO32', etc. [00039] The term "brine* refers to a solution of water and electrolytes such as sodium chloride, potassium chloride, calcium chloride. These may be further denoted as 7.5% NaCl, 7% KC1 and 2.5% CaCF or a combination of these which are normally weight% or otherwise reported. [00040] The term ‘high brine' is used when the concentration of the electrolytes present exceeds a certain value and has greater effect on the performance of the polymer. High brines may be, for example, seawater, or recycled water / flow hack (produced) water from stimulation of the wells, etc, [0004] ] The term 'API brine5 refers to the definition of brine used by the American Petroleum Institute (API), in this invention 10% API’ brine was prepared by dissolving 7.5wt% NaCl sand 2.5wt% CaCl.?. in DI (deionized) water. [00042] 'Friction reducers5 for water based liquids are the chemical additives added to the aqueous liquids to reduce the friction coefficient during turbulent flow, for example during hydraulic fracturing of subterranean formations. These additives lower the friction or drag by suppressing the turbulence present in high velocity gradient water and as a result water can flow faster. Polymers, other than polyacrylamides, with friction reducing action can be high molecular weight linear homo or copolymers of styrene/N-vinylpyridiue, ethene/cc-olefins, isobutene, (meth)acryhc esters, divinylbenzene/1 -hexene/1 -octene/1 -decene, acrylamide/acrylate, styrene/methylstyrenesulfonate/N-vinylpyridine, etc. [00043] The dose of friction reducer is typically 0.25 gallon per 1000 gallon to 5-gallon per 1000 gallon of water. [00044] In hydraulic fracturing, anionic polyacrylamides are used typically as efficient friction reducers, unless clay swell inhibitor such as KC1 and polyDADMAC (Polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride) are used, when cationic polyacrylamides are typically used. Friction reducers are normally added in-line and therefore they need to dissolve in a short time, typically in less than 2 minutes. For this reason, emulsions are preferred to powders. The water based liquid in hydraulic fracturing can be anything from fresh water to heavy brine containing high concentrations of salts, including multivalent cations such as Fe3! Mg"+, Cax+, Ba2 f and Sr+, etc. [00045] ‘Fracturing fluid5 used in hydraulic fracturing or fracking is defined as the mixture of large amount of fresh or salt water (85-95%), sand, ceramic or resin coated proppant (5-15%) and <0.5% chemical additives such as friction reducers, viscosifiers, fluid loss additives, breakers, emulsifiers, surfactants, non-emulsifiers, pH control additives, cross-linkers, gel stabilizers, biocides etc. The total amount of fracturing fluid used per well may be 1- 4 million US gallons, [00046] In an embodiment of the present invention component **b” of the friction reducer composition in this invention is selected from the group consisting of a) silicone polyether(s) defined by the formula: Me?

Applications for the embodiments of the invention: (1) Friction reduction. [00047] Friction reducing emulsions normally comprise a class of high molecular weight linear polymers. These can be neutral, anionic or cationic in nature. The charge on these polymers comes from the co-monomer used in the preparation. Such emulsions may contain surfactants. The present invention describes the use of silicon polyether copolymers as hydration aids for polyacrylamide polymer used as friction reducer in water based liquids. The silicon polyether copolymers are suitable and compatible with polyacrylamide emulsions used in hydraulic fracturing applications. The availability of fresh water in some oil and gas fields is declining as the hydraulic fracturing operations are increasing to extract more and more crude oil and natural gas from rock formations. Thus the use of produced or flow-back water or recycled water remains a viable option. Recycling of produced water is an expensive process and costs more to oil and gas industry. Produced or flow-back water as such contains large amount of salts, which may consist of a variety of mono and multivalent cations / anions and many of the anionic friction reducers fail to produce strong friction reduction in such water. Silicon polyether copolymers can accelerate the hydration of polyacrylamide polymer chains. These cun be mixed with polyacrylamide emulsions prior or added at the time of injection for hydraulic fracturing. The solubility of silicon polyether copolymers in various brines makes them suitable additives for oil and gas field applications. (2) Drilling mud additive [00048] Polyacrylamides are used as drilling mud additives as well as for enhanced oil recovery. Drilling muds are pumped into well bores during drilling operations for crude oil and natural gas production. These are used as fluid loss additives. Superior hydration of polyacrylamides in the presence of silicon polyether can improve fluid loss additive property of the polyacrylamide polymer.

TESTING EXAMPLES EXAMPLE 1 [00049] Run 1, To a 250 mL plastic beaker was added 150 mL of 10% brine containing 7.5% NaCl and 2.5% CaCL (API brine) in deionized water. An overhead mixer with four propeller blades was used to create a vortex. The position of the propeller was fixed in the center at 2" from the bottom of the beaker, The speed of the mixer was set to 800 RPM. The brine in the beaker was allowed to mix at set RPM to create a vortex. To this vortex 5,0g HPAM-1 (3.33 wt%) was injected. The vortex closure was observed from top view and as the time for the vortex to close was recorded. [00050] Figure 1 shows a vortex formation in brine when 800 rpm mixing is applied, [00051 ] Runs 2-11. Run-1 was repeated except in these runs 0.5% of silicon polyether (Si!-1, Sil-10, and Sil 13-20) was solubilized in 10% brine prior to the addition of 3.33wt% HPAM-1.

[00053] A rheometer, model Physica MCR 30! (Anton Par, Ashland, VA, USA) was used to investigate the rheological properties of the polyacrylamide polymers and the new compositions using the coaxial cylinder measuring system (Bob Radius 13.331mm, Cup Radius 14.460mm, Measuring Gap 1.129 mm). All the experiments were carried, out at 25°C- and at 2500s'1 shear rate, [00054] First, HP AMU was blended with 1 -9% of silicon polyether copolymers and all the formulations were aged for 24 hours at room temperature before measurement. Then 1,66wt% of HPAM-1 or Formulations 1-12, as described in Table 2, were injected to a measured amount of APS brine and the viscosity of the solutions was monitored for 300s. ‘Hydration viscosity'5 in the table refers to the viscosity value obtained after hydration of the polyacrylamide polymer in brine during rheology experiment. [00055] “%Improvement in Hydration Viscosity’'' of polyacrylamide is calculated by referencing the hydration viscosity of HPAM-1 obtained at 300s. All the experiments were conducted in identical experimental conditions. [00056] ‘Viscosity’ refers to the bulk viscosity of the polyacrylamide emulsion or blended mixture of polyacrylamide emulsion ami silicon polyether. This was measured with a Brookfield RV Viscometer D.V-H1 Ultra (Brookfield, Middleboro, ΜΑ, USA) at room temperature using #7 spindle at 100 rpm. [00057] ‘Tolerance of brine’ refers to the capacity of polyacrylamide polymer to get hydrated in the brine. This was qualitati vely determined based on the physical appearance of the resultant fluid from rheology experiment. “Good” rating means no precipitation or flocculation, “Fair” rating means that only moderate precipitation or flocculation, white “Bad” rating means that strong precipitation or flocculation was observed. [00058] 'Hydration viscosity’ refers to the viscosity value obtained after hydration of the polyacrylamide polymer in brine during rheology experiment. The viscosity data is reported in centipoise (cP) unit or otherwise noted.

[00067] 0.5 wt.% of HPAM-6 was added to a measured amount of the 10% brine containing 0.4wt% silicon polyether, Sil-10. The contents were then mixed for 20 minutes at 800 rpm, The viscosity of the resulting fluid was recorded as 17 cP by using the method described in Example 2. When a similar amount of HPAM-6 was used and no silicon polyether was added, a low viscosity (13 cP) was observed in an identical experimental condition. This example showed 30% improvement in the hydration viscosity of polyacrylamide polymer in 20 minutes in the presence of silicon poiyether. EXAMPLE 12. [00068] Referring to Table 12 below, HPAM-1 was used to measure the effect of the concentration of silicon poiyether copolymer on the hydration of polyacrylamide polymer. The data showed that a very small amount <0.005% silicon poiyether with 1.66wt% polymer emulsion HPAM-1) of Sii-10 can trigger the inversion of emulsion and accelerate the hydration of polymer. 0,05wt% - 0.1 wt% silicon poiyether copolymer can improve up to 100% hydration of polyacrylamide in 120s of mixing (Figure 2). Figure 2 shows viscosity vs. time plots obtained from rheology experiments.

[00069] 1,66wt% of polyacrylamide emulsion CP AM-1 was injected to a measured amount of brine containing 0.05% silicon poiyether, Sil-10. Similar tests as described in Example 2 were performed and the hydration viscosity was recorded as 27cP at 300s (Figure-3, top left (A) and Figure 4). When a similar amount of CPAM-1 was injected into the brine and no silicon poiyether was added, polyacrylamide precipitated and only minimal hydration and low viscosity (6 cP) was observed, as shown in Figure-3, bottom scheme (Β). As a continuation of this experiment, 0.05% Sii-10 was added to the precipitated mixture. The precipitated polyacrylamide became solubilized .in the brine (see in Figure-3, right scheme, (€)) and a similar magnitude of viscosity (27℮Ρ) was observed. Viscosities vs. time plots for the experiments conducted in this example are shown in Figure 4. EXAMPLE 14. [00070] Friction reduction by various poly acrylamide polymers and the new compositions were measured using a flow loop. [00071 ] Run 1 ; The polymer solution was prepared by injecting 0.1 wt% (1 gpt) of polymer emulsion to a measured amount of 10% brine and then mixing it for 5 minutes at 500 RPM with an. overhead mixer with four propeller blades. This fluid was then injected into a fluid reservoir and 30 psi pressure was applied. Five hundred rat, of polymer solution was allowed to flow via a 318 cm long tube (diameter - 0.39 cm) at 30 psi pressure and the flow time was recorded, Similar experiments were performed at 20 psi, 10 psi and 5 psi pressures. The viscosity of the fluid was measured using a rheometer, model Physica MCR 301 (Anton Par, Ashland, VA, USA) at 100s‘s shear rate. [00072] The data obtained from the above experiments were used to calculate the Reynolds number (Re) and the Fanning’s Friction Factor using the equations: d5l)Pn2 Fanning’s Friction Factor -- / ≈ and 3 2lpQA 4 Qp Reynolds Number = Re = iqnd. [00073] The values of/'and Re were calculated for every dosage of Friction Reducer and a comparison was made with the base brine under the same conditions. All percent friction reductions were calculated as:- %fr - ΐοοα- -) * ■' for Re- 15000; where subscripts ρ :::: polymer solution and s :::: solvent brine. [00074] Run 2-16: These experiments were conducted following the same procedure as Run-1 (Table-13), Table 13 Friction Reduction data (%) of various polyacrylamide polymer emulsions with silicon polyether copolymer *gpt = gallon/thousand gallon [00075] In the present invention;, silicon polyether copolymers are used as an additive with polyacrylamide products to improve the hydration of the polymeric chains, It is disclosed that the inversion of polyacrylamide emulsions and the hydration of the polymeric chains can be accelerated by the presence of small amount of silicon polyether. This feature is evident by the vortex closure and rheology tests (Tables 1-12; Examples 1-13). The faster inversion of emulsion and better hydration -of polymeric chains resulted in a higher friction reduction (Table-13: Example 14) and a 20-133% improvement in the friction reduction is observed. [00076] The results obtained from these experiments demonstrate that silicon polvether copolymers accelerated the friction reducing performance of anionic polyacrylamide pol ymers in brines containing high concentration of monovalent and divalent cations. [00077] In the hydraulic .fracturing application ionic polyacrylamides need to solubilize and hydrate in very short period of time, typically 1-2 minutes. In the present invention, superior hydration of polyacrylamide chains is demonstrated by higher magnitude of "hydration viscosity' values (Tables 1-12; Examples 1-13). Mechanistically, the hydration of polyacrylamide chains and subsequent viscosity development is crucial to achieve higher friction reduction. Hydrated polyacrylamide chains act as better friction reducer as compare to non-hydrated polymer chains.
