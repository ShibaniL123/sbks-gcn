PqsR Modulators Field of the invention The present invention relates to compounds according to general formula (I); to pharmaceutical compositions comprising one or more of the compound(s); and to the use of the compound(s) as anti-infectives. Background of the invention In view of the rapid decline in the effectiveness of antibiotics due to the emergence of resistance, there is a need for a constant supply of new compounds for effective treatment of infections. The development of antimicrobial resistance is mainly attributed to the overuse of antibiotics interfering with essential metabolic processes in bacteria. Moreover, bacteria living in biofilms, sessile cell communities embedded in a matrix of extracellular polymeric substances showing reduced metabolic activity and growth rate, exhibit up to 1000 fold higher resistance against antibiotics than free-living bacteria. Thus, novel therapeutic approaches that aim at reducing bacterial pathogenicity by interfering with bacterial virulence and biofilm formation instead of their metabolic activity are considered as highly favourable and are urgently needed. The opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa causes severe and fatal infections including such of the urinary tract, of the gastrointestinal tract, of chronic and burnt wounds, of the eyes, of the ears, and of the lungs. Its pathogenicity is strongly related to the expression of virulence factors causing progressive tissue damage and biofilm formation hindering a successful drug therapy. The regulation of pathogenicity is based on a cell-density dependent intercellular communication system known as quorum sensing (QS). P. aeruginosa uses as signal molecules N-acyl-Z-homoserine lactones (AHLs) for the las and r l QS systems and 2-alkyl-4-(lH)-quinolones (AQs) for the pqs QS system. The latter is restricted to Pseudomonas and Burkholderia species allowing for selective therapy with pqs QS inhibitors. While Pseudomonas and Burkholderia both produce 2-heptyl-4- hydroxyquinoline (HHQ), Pseudomonas uniquely uses the Pseudomonas quinolone signal (PQS) as signal molecule. PQS and its biosynthetic precursor HHQ serve as the natural ligands and agonists of the key DNA-binding receptor PqsR. This transcriptional regulator fine-tunes a large set of genes, notably such involved in the biosynthesis of HHQ and in the production of virulence factors such as pyocyanin and lectins. Regarding biofilms, the production of extracellular DNA (eDNA) and lectins, both main biofilm matrix components, is controlled by the pqs QS system. A pqsR mutant of P. aeruginosa is pqs QS-deficient, does not produce any pyocyanin or lectin A, shows reduced eDNA production, and displays reduced pathogenicity in mice. To date, a number of compounds have been discovered that target QS in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The majority of these compounds has been reported to interfere with the AHL- based QS systems in Pseudomonas either via direct interaction with the receptors LasR [1, 2] or RhlR [3], at the posttranscriptional level [4-6], or at superior regulatory systems [7]. However, except an extract from Allium sativum (garlic), that exhibited no significant improvement of lung function in a clinical trial, these QS inhibitors have been only used in preclinical studies. Whereas AHL-mediated QS is widespread among Gram-negative bacteria, interference with pqs QS allows for selective therapy avoiding adverse effects on beneficial bacterial consortia present in the host. A few pqs QS inhibitors have been described acting as blockers of the signal molecule biosynthesis [8-16] or as antagonists of the receptor PqsR [17- 21]. A QS inhibitor based on anthranilate structure, methyl anthranilate, was shown to inhibit PQS formation and the production of the virulence factor elastase at millimolar concentrations [12]. QS inhibitors targeting the enzyme PqsA were able to reduce the production of signal molecules HHQ and PQS (IC50: -100 μΜ for 6FABA) [14, 16, 22] and enhanced the survival rate of Pseudomonas-m' fected mice in a thermal injury mice model [14]. However, high concentrations were necessary to obtain an in cellulo or in vivo effect. Inhibitors of the enzyme PqsD were able to reduce the biovolume of a P. aeruginosa biofilm [15], however, did not exhibit any anti- virulence properties (no effect on virulence factor pyocyanin, no effect on the survival of Pseudomonas-inf ected Galleria mellonella larvae; unpublished data). Zender [18] and Klein [17] reported PqsR antagonists affecting the production of virulence factor pyocyanin, however with moderate potency (IC50 values in the double-digit micromolar range). Furthermore, these compounds did not inhibit biofilm formation (unpublished data). Quinazoline-based PqsR antagonists developed in the group of Paul Williams [21] were reported to exhibit anti-virulence activity. However, the most promising compound was only moderately active in reducing pyocyanin production (IC50 ~ 50 μΜ in a less PQS- and pyocyanin-producing P. aeruginosa strain). A reduction in biomass of a P. aeruginosa biofilm by this compound was observed, however at an unknown concentration. The most potent antagonist of PqsR to date - 2-heptyl-6-nitro-4-oxo-l,4-dihydroquinoline-3-carboxamide - was developed in the group of Anke Steinbach and Rolf W. Hartmann [20]. 2-heptyl-6-nitro-4-oxo- l,4-dihydroquinoline-3-carboxamide is highly affine to PqsR (IC50 = 35 nM in E.coli reporter gene assay, IC50 = 400 nM in P. aeruginosa reporter gene assay), strongly reduces signal molecule production (HHQ production by 54% and PQS by 37% at 15 μΜ), and shows excellent anti-virulence potency in cellulo (inhibition of virulence factor pyocyanin production: IC50 = 2 μΜ) and in in vivo animal infection models (strong protection of Caenorhabditis elegans nematodes and full protection of Galleria mellonella larvae from lethal P. aeruginosa infection at a concentration of 22 nM corresponding to 7.3 ng g"1 body weight). Most notably, the compound exhibited no sign of toxicity in the two animal models. However, this compound has the disadvantage of not being able to inhibit biofilm formation. Therefore, the problem underlying the present invention is to provide novel anti-pathogenic compounds exhibiting both anti-virulence and anti-biofilm activity, especially compounds having PqsR modulating, e.g. antagonistic activity to thereby permit an effective treatment of bacterial infections.

For compounds having asymmetric centers, it should be understood that (unless otherwise specified) all of the optical isomers and mixtures thereof are encompassed. Compounds with two or more asymmetric elements can also be present as mixtures of diastereomers. In addition, compounds with carbon-carbon double bonds may occur in Z- and E- forms, with all isomeric forms of the compounds being included in the present invention unless otherwise specified. Where a compound exists in various tautomeric forms, a recited compound is not limited to any one specific tautomer, but rather is intended to encompass all tautomeric forms. Recited compounds are further intended to encompass compounds in which one or more atoms are replaced with an isotope {i.e., an atom having the same atomic number but a different mass number). By way of general example, and without limitation, isotopes of hydrogen include tritium and deuterium and isotopes of carbon include nC, 13C, and 14C. Compounds according to the formulas provided herein, which have one or more stereogenic centers, have an enantiomeric excess of at least 50%. For example, such compounds may have an enantiomeric excess of at least 60%, 70%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, or 98%. Some embodiments of the compounds have an enantiomeric excess of at least 99%. It will be apparent that single enantiomers (optically active forms) can be obtained by asymmetric synthesis, synthesis from optically pure precursors or by resolution of the racemates. Resolution of the racemates can be accomplished, for example, by conventional methods such as crystallization in the presence of a resolving agent, or chromatography, using, for example a chiral HPLC column. Certain compounds are described herein using a general formula that includes variables, e.g. A, A1, A2, and A3, L, R, R1, R2, R3, R4, R5 to R8, X1, X2, X3,Y, Z, etc. Unless otherwise specified, each variable within such a formula is defined independently of any other variable, and any variable that occurs more than one time in a formula is defined independently at each occurrence. Thus, for example, if a group, e.g. A, is shown to be substituted with 0-3 R3, the group may be unsubstituted or substituted with 1 , 2 or 3 R groups, and R at each occurrence is selected independently from the definition of R3. Also, combinations of substituents and/or variables are permissible only if such combinations result in stable compounds, i.e., compounds that can be isolated, characterized and tested for biological activity. As used herein a wording defining the limits of a range of length such as, e. g., "from 1 to 5" means any integer from 1 to 5, i. e. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. In other words, any range defined by two integers explicitly mentioned is meant to comprise and disclose any integer defining said limits and any integer comprised in said range. For example, the term "CiV (or "Ci-C6") refers to 1 to 6, i.e. 1 , 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6, carbon atoms. A "pharmacologically acceptable salt" of a compound disclosed herein is an acid or base salt that is generally considered in the art to be suitable for use in contact with the tissues of human beings or animals without excessive toxicity or carcinogenicity, and preferably without irritation, allergic response, or other problem or complication. Such pharmaceutical salts include mineral and organic acid salts of basic residues such as amines, as well as alkali or organic salts of acidic residues such as carboxylic acids. Suitable pharmaceutical salts include, but are not limited to, salts of acids such as hydrochloric, phosphoric, hydrobromic, malic, glycolic, fumaric, sulfuric, sulfamic, sulfanilic, formic, toluenesulfonic, methanesulfonic, benzene sulfonic, ethane disulfonic, 2- hydroxyethylsulfonic, nitric, benzoic, 2-acetoxybenzoic, citric, tartaric, lactic, stearic, salicylic, glutamic, ascorbic, pamoic, succinic, fumaric, maleic, propionic, hydroxymaleic, hydroiodic, phenylacetic, alkanoic such as acetic, HOOC-(CH2)n-COOH where n is any integer from 0 to - 4 (i.e., 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4) and the like. Similarly, pharmaceutically acceptable cations include, but are not limited to sodium, potassium, calcium, aluminum, lithium and ammonium. Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize further pharmacologically acceptable salts for the compounds provided herein. In general, a pharmacologically acceptable acid or base salt can be synthesized from a parent compound that contains a basic or acidic moiety by any conventional chemical method. Briefly, such salts can be prepared by reacting the free acid or base forms of these compounds with a stoichiometric amount of the appropriate base or acid in water or in an organic solvent, or in a mixture of the two. Generally, the use of nonaqueous media, such as ether, ethyl acetate, ethanol, isopropanol or acetonitrile, is preferred. It will be apparent that each compound of formula (I) may, but need not, be present as a hydrate, solvate or non-covalent complex. In addition, the various crystal forms and polymorphs are within the scope of the present invention, as are prodrugs of the compounds of formula (I) provided herein. A "prodrug" is a compound that may not fully satisfy the structural requirements of the compounds provided herein, but is modified in vivo, following administration to a subject or patient, to produce a compound of formula I provided herein. For example, a prodrug may be an acylated derivative of a compound as provided herein. Prodrugs include compounds wherein hydroxy, carboxy, amine or sulfhydryl groups are bonded to any group that, when administered to a mammalian subject, cleaves to form a free hydroxy, carboxy, amino, or sulfhydryl group, respectively. Examples of prodrugs include, but are not limited to, acetate, formate, phosphate and benzoate derivatives of alcohol and amine functional groups within the compounds provided herein. Prodrugs of the compounds provided herein may be prepared by modifying functional groups present in the compounds in such a way that the modifications are cleaved in vivo to generate the parent compounds. A "substituent," as used herein, refers to a molecular moiety that is covalently bonded to an atom within a molecule of interest. For example, a "ring substituent" may be a moiety such as a halogen, alkyl group, haloalkyl group, hydroxy, cyano, amino, nitro, mercapto, or other substituent described herein that is covalently bonded to an atom (preferably a carbon or nitrogen atom) that is a ring member. The term "substituted," as used herein, means that any one or more hydrogens on the designated atom is replaced with a selection from the indicated substituents, provided that the designated atom's normal valence is not exceeded, and that the substitution results in a stable compound, i.e. a compound that can be isolated, characterized and tested for biological activity. When a substituent is oxo {i.e., =0), then 2 hydrogens on the atom are replaced. An oxo group that is a substituent of an aromatic carbon atom results in a conversion of -CH- to -C(=0)- and a loss of aromaticity. For example a pyridyl group substituted by oxo is a pyridone. As used herein, "comprising", "including", "containing", "characterized by", and grammatical equivalents thereof are inclusive or open-ended terms that do not exclude additional, unrecited elements or method steps. "Comprising", etc. is to be interpreted as including the more restrictive term "consisting of. As used herein, "consisting of excludes any element, step, or ingredient not specified in the claim. When trade names are used herein, it is intended to independently include the trade name product formulation, the generic drug, and the active pharmaceutical ingredient(s) of the trade name product. In general, unless defined otherwise, technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs, and are consistent with general textbooks and dictionaries.

Chemicals, bacterial strains and media used in biological experiments Yeast extract was purchased from Fluka (Neu-Ulm, Germany), peptone from casein from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany), and Bacto™ Tryptone from BD Biosciences (Heidelberg, Germany),. Salts and organic solvents of analytical grade were obtained from VWR (Darmstadt, Germany). P. aeruginosa strain PA 14 (PA 14) was stored in glycerol stocks at - 80 °C. The following media were used: Luria Bertani broth (LB) and PPGAS medium [23]. Reporter gene assay in E. coli The ability of the compounds to either stimulate or antagonize the PqsR-dependent transcription was analysed as previously described [19] using a β-galactosidase reporter gene assay in E. coli expressing PqsR. Briefly, a culture of E. coli DH5a cells containing the plasmid pEAL08-2, which encodes PqsR under the control of the tac promoter and the β- galactosidase reporter gene lacZ controlled by the pqsA promoter, were co-incubated with test compound. Antagonistic effects of compounds were assayed in the presence of 50 nM PQS. After incubation, β-galactosidase activity was measured spectralphotometrically at OD42onm using POLARstar Omega (BMG Labtech, Ortenberg, Germany) and expressed as percent stimulation of controls. For the determination of IC50 values, compounds were tested at least at eight different concentrations. Results of tests using the above reporter gene assay are presented in Table 1 below. Table 1.

Determination of extracellular PQS levels Quantification of PQS produced by P. aeruginosa PA14 was performed according to the method of Maurer et al. [15]. For each sample, cultivation and sample work-up were performed in triplicates. Inhibition values of PQS formation were normalized to OD600. Pyocyanin assay For analysis of pyocyanin formation, cultivation procedure was the same as for HHQ determination with the exception of using PPGAS medium. Pyocyanin produced by PA14 was quantified using the method of Essar et al. [24] with some modifications, as described in detail by Klein et al. [17] . Briefly, 900 μί, of each culture were extracted with 900 μΐ. of chloroform and 800 iL of the organic phase re-extracted with 250 μΐ, of 0.2 M HC1. OD520 was measured in the aqueous phase using FLUOstar Omega (BMG Labtech, Ortenberg, Germany). For each sample, cultivation and sample work-up were performed in triplicates. Inhibition values of pyocyanin formation were normalized to OD6o0- Biofilm growth assay Static biofilms at the bottom of 96 well microtiter plates were grown with small modifications as previously described [25, 26]. In brief, overnight P. aeruginosa LB cultures of PA 14 were adjusted to an OD600 of 0.002 with fresh medium and transferred into a half-area 96 well μα&εα? plate (Greiner Bio-One, 100 μL/well). The plate was covered with an air- permeable foil and incubated at 37°C in a chamber with humid atmosphere. After 24 h, a staining solution including Syto9 and propidium iodide (LIVE/DEAD BacLight Bacterial Viability kit, Molecular Probes/Invitrogen) and the test compound solved in DMSO was added to the biofilms (final concentration 100 μΜ, 1 % DMSO (v/v)) and biofilms were further incubated for 24 h at 37°C. After in total 48 h, biofilm stacks were acquired in the center of each well (step size: 3 μπι) using an automated confocal microscope (TCS SP8, Leica Microsystems) equipped with an x40/1.10 water objective. The acquired image stacks were processed and analyzed with a customized analysis solution for the Developer XD2 (Definiens) based on a previously described algorithm [27]. 3D-projections of the biofilms are visualized with the software IMARIS (version 7.6.5, Bitplane). Test of anti-virulence properties The anti-virulence properties of compounds according to the invention were tested by determining the reduction of PQS and pyocyanin levels in P. aeruginosa. The corresponding test assays were performed as described above. The results are shown in Table 2 below. Table 2.

As can be taken from Table 2, compound 8 was able to strongly reduce the production of the virulence factor pyocyanin in P. aeruginosa PA14 (IC50:~ 12 μΜ). This implicates that the compound is a strong anti-virulence agent in vivo, as reduction of pyocyanin formation correlates with an enhanced survival of P. aeruginosa-m' fected Caenorhabditis elegans worms as well as Galleria mellonella larvae, two well established in vivo models for P. aeruginosa pathogenicity [20]. Test of biofilm formation inhibitory activity As it was shown that a pqs QS-deficient mutant of P. aeruginosa having a transposon insertion within the pqsA gene forms less biofilm than the wild type, we tested the influence of compound 8 for its potential to interfere with biofilm formation by P. aeruginosa PA14 and the clinical isolate MHH9639. The latter was shown to produce similar amounts of PQS as strain PA 14 (unpublished data) proving that the isolate possesses an intact pqs QS system. Indeed, we found that addition of compound 8 to 24 h old biofilms markedly reduced the biovolume of the biofilms of both P. aeruginosa strains. The results are shown in Fig. 1. Thus, compound 8, as an example for the whole ensemble of compounds belonging to the present invention, has proven promising for anti-biofilm therapy. Overall, compound 8, as an example for the compounds of invention, has proven to be a promising anti-pathogenic compound exhibiting both anti-virulence and anti-biofilm activity allowing for an effective treatment of bacterial infections.
