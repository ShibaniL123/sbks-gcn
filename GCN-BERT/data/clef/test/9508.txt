Step 2. 4-(((3-Bromo-4-methylphenyl)sulfonyl)methyl)tetrahydro-2H-pyran
To a solution of sodium 3-bromo-4-methylbenzenesulfinate (50 mg, 0.19 mmol) in DMF (1 mL) was added 4-(bromomethyl)tetrahydro-2H-pyran (26 μL). The reaction mixture was stirred at 50° C. overnight. An additional portion of 4-(bromomethyl)tetrahydro-2H-pyran (26 L) was added, and the reaction mixture was stirred at 50° C. for 1 d. The reaction mixture was diluted with water, and the aqueous mixture was extracted with EtOAc (3×). The combined organic layers were washed with brine, dried over Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated. Purification via silica gel chromatography (20-80% EtOAc/hexanes) afforded the title compound as a white solid (32 mg, 49%).
