Step 3 Synthesis of compound 1e
To a solution of the compound 1c (10.0 g, 25.5 mmol) in acetone (100 mL), the compound 1d (6.02 g, 25.5 mmol) and hexamethylphosphoric triamide (15.5 mL, 89 mmol) were added. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1 hour. Water was added to the mixture, followed by extraction with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed by water and brine and then dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure. The obtained residue was purified by column chromatography (hexane-ethyl acetate) to afford the compound 1e (2.1 g, yield 13.1%).
