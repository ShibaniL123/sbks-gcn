Field of the Invention The present technology is oriented towards the pharmaceutical sector, mainly for the production of TRPV1 receptor antagonist pharmaceuticals, in order to treat diseases where the said receptor is over-activated, for example chronic pain. State of the Art A target for the development of drugs for treating chronic inflammatory pain is the transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 receptor or TRPV1, as it is related to the modulation of nociceptive signals due to its expression mainly in C and Aδ sensory fibers (1, 2). Under pathological conditions, the said receptors are over-activated in these sensory fibers and have a direct role in maintaining neurogenic inflammation (3, 4, 5, 6). In addition, they represent a possible treatment for neuropathic pain due to the overexpression of these receptors in undamaged fibers adjacent to the damaged fibers. TRPV1 receptors are calcium permeable non-selective cation channels known as polymodal nociceptors, as they can be activated by various physical and chemical ligands, both endogenous and exogenous. Direct activators of TRPV1 receptors that have been discovered to date are endovanilloids (anandamide, arachidonic acid or lipoxygenase products), basic or acid pH, harmful temperatures (>42 °C) and voltage (8, 9), in addition to exogenous chemical ligands such as capsaicin. However, TRPV1 receptors can be indirectly activated or sensitized by changes in the phosphorylation-dephosphorylation state produced by kinases, which are activated through secondary pathways as a result of the activation of receptors, e.g. bradykinin, serotonin, histamine, somatostatin, prostaglandin, interleukin or tyrosinase receptors, so that the activation of these receptors finally leads to the activation of the TRPV1 receptors (3). The receptors related to the indirect activation of TRPV1 receptors are activated by pro-inflammatory molecules liberated at the site of tissue inflammation in pathologies associated with inflammatory mechanisms, such as cancer, osteoporosis, arthritis, diabetes, irritable bowel syndrome, cystitis and others (10, 11). Some of these pro-inflammatory molecules can also directly activate TRPV1 receptors, e.g. anandamide, arachidonic acid, N-arachidonoyl-dopamine, N-acyl-dopamine, 12-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid, 15-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid and leukotriene B4, which have been shown to effectively activate TRPV1 receptors (12). TRPV1 receptors are therefore directly involved in the perception and transduction of pain. The creation of TRPV1 knockout mice has made it possible to confirm the principal role played by the activation of the receptor in nociceptive processes and its potential for treating chronic pain diseases. These mice lacking the TRPV1 receptor present an impaired physiological response to vanilloid compounds and, in addition, neuron cultures from the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) of knockout mice do not respond to typical activators of the receptor, such as capsaicin, damaging heat and protons; furthermore, these mice are characterized for not developing thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia, two recurring symptoms in chronic pain patients (13, 14, 15). In addition to the inhibition of TRPV1 receptors for treating pain, the activation of TRPV1 receptors can also be modulated to treat pathologies such as urinary incontinence, overactive bladder syndrome, asthma, chronic cough, renal hypertension, ischemic neuronal protection, pancreatitis or obesity, as the expression of TRPV1 receptors is also present in non-sensory cells, such as keratinocytes, pancreatic β cells and dendritic cells, among other cellular phenotypes (11), thus expanding pharmacological possibilities with regard to these receptors. The first ligand discovered for TRPV1 receptors was capsaicin, a pungent compound found in chili peppers that acts as a TRPV1 agonist and whose therapeutic potential lies in its ability to sensitize DRG sensory neurons and cause a desensitizing effect of these neurons after exposure to capsaicin. The response of DRG neurons is characterized by an acute desensitization or tachyphylaxis, depending on the time of the amount of repetitive doses of capsaicin, respectively, and both desensitization mechanisms are dependent on extracellular calcium (16). The effect produced by capsaicin thus alters the transduction of nociceptive signals and is the basis for capsaicin's analgesic properties in topical applications in patients with chronic pain (17, 18). A group of natural compounds known as vainilloids are characterized for presenting agonist activity on TRPV1 receptors, e.g. resiniferatoxin, polygodial, isovaleral, scutigeral, neogrifolin, gingerol, eugenol and piperine derivatives. These compounds are structural analogs of capsaicin and their synthesis is relevant for the development of drugs due to the fact that capsaicin acts specifically on TRPV1 receptors and causes specific desensitization in DRG C and Aδ fibers (19, 20). The agonist activity of vanilloid compounds can be modified through halogenation in carbon atoms 5 and 6 of the vanillyl group, changing the effect to an antagonistic one, where the chlorine and bromide atoms in these positions reduce agonistic activity, and the iodine atom completely reverts the activity, so that 5/6-iodononivamide and 5-iodoresiniferatoxin are characterized for acting as complete TRPV1 antagonists with a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 10; 126.2 and 0.4 nM, respectively; of which resiniferatoxin, a daphnane diterpene isolated from Euphorbia resinifera, is additionally an agonist that is 10 times more potent than capsaicin and its potency is unaffected by its iodation, although its pharmacological development is limited by its low availability and high toxicity. The antagonistic effect exerted by the iodine atom can also be observed in other iodinated vanilloid analogs (21, 22, 23). The development of compounds with antagonistic activity on TRPV1 receptors, both capsaicin analogs and other structural classes of antagonists with a specific activity, is an emerging area of pharmaceutical research aimed at treating chronic pain and other diseases in which the activity of these receptors is increased. This is mainly due to the fact that treatments based on agonists have disadvantages such as neurotoxicity associated with the increase in intracellular calcium, and although capsaicin is effective in chronic pain patients its topical application in humans induces initial pain, erythema and hyperalgesia and it must be applied repeatedly to achieve an analgesic effect due to the low concentrations of capsaicin in formulations in order to reduce the side effects, which together with making it unsuitable for prolonged use leads to a high number of patients abandoning topical treatments based on capsaicin. In addition, the pungency and systemic side effects in vanilloid analogs prevent the development of agonist compounds with oral bioavailability, in addition to the existing relationship between the higher agonist potency and the presence of the hydroxyl group (3, 18). The main competitive antagonist compounds developed until now are characterized for acting at the orthosteric site of the TRPV1 receptor located between the third and fourth transmembrane segment, where the threonine 550 and tyrosine 510 residues are crucial in the sensitivity of the receptor to both agonist and antagonist compounds (25-28). This binding site reveals two important requirements for the recognition of the receptor, these being lipophilicity for reaching the binding site and the establishment of hydrogen bonds for interacting with the residues identified, and these characteristics are consistent with the chemical modifications carried out on compounds with activity at the TRPV1 receptor that identify three pharmacophoric regions that are important for the activity, these being a donor-acceptor region of hydrogen bonds, a region with a high polarity and a hydrophobic region, which three regions are separated by spacing groups that regulate the conformation of the ligands and thus their agonist or antagonist behavior towards the receptor. The agonist compounds thus acquire a folded conformation between the donor-acceptor region of hydrogen bonds and the hydrophobic region, in which the capsaicin amide group acquires, for example, a trans-orientation and the aliphatic chain acquires an extended conformation (29). At the same time, the antagonist compounds adopt a coplanar conformation between the hydrophobic region and the donor-acceptor region of hydrogen bonds (30). Based on these structural and conformational criteria, the most potent antagonists, such as cinnamide, pyrimidine and quinazoline derivatives, among many others (31-37), are characterized for maintaining these characteristics and also by presenting a high conformational restriction imposed between the polar and the hydrophobic region, which favors the coplanar rearrangement between the hydrophobic region and the donor-acceptor region of hydrogen bonds, improving antagonistic potency. Thus, the compound N-(4-tertiarybutylphenyl)-4-(3-cholorphyridin-2-yl)tetrahydropyrazine-1 (2H)-carbox-amide known as BCTC is characterized for being a conformationally-restricted urea derivative with potent TRPV1 antagonistic qualities and a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 2-6nM depending on the type of species (rat, mouse or human) of the TRPV1 receptor, and although its efficacy has been observed in chronic pain animal models, it has a low degree of metabolic stability, a short half-life, poor aqueous solubility and only moderate oral bioavailability (31, 32, 33). Similarly, the cinnamide derivative (E)-3-(4-t-butylphenyl)-N-(2,3-dihydrobenzo[b][1,4]dioxin-6-yl)acrylamide presents antagonistic activity with IC50 79nm, and replacing the double bond in this compound with a 4-Aminopyridine group made it possible to obtain a derivative with increased antagonistic activity with an IC50 of 2nM (34). Additionally, the synthesis of oxazole derivatives was developed based on urea derivatives such as ABT-102, where the isosteric replacement of the urea group resulted in compounds with strong antagonistic activity and led to the obtainment of compounds with improved pharmacokinetic properties and good CNS penetration (41). Thus, isosteric groups, such as imidazole, thiazolpyrimidine, pyridopyrimidines, pyridopyrazines or thiazole carboxamides have made it possible to obtain a wide range of conformationally-restricted competitive antagonists with strong activity towards TRPV1 receptors (31-44). In addition to competitive antagonists, non-competitive antagonists have been characterized by TRPV1, such as ruthenium red with an antagonistic activity of IC50 = 0.17µM and lanthanum which presents activity at a concentration equal to or greater than 100µM, which act by blocking the ionic channel, binding to a site composed of negatively-charged residues; arginine-rich hexapeptides have also been developed, although these compounds together with ruthenium red and lanthanum lack selectivity for the receptor, resulting in side effects and toxicity and preventing their pharmacological development (45, 46).

DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION This invention describes compounds derived from 1,3,4-thiadiazole alkylamides and from chalcones with the capacity of inhibiting the activation of the TRPV1 receptor caused by capsaicin and temperature. The first aspect of the invention is related to the vanilloid derivatives of 1, 3, 4-thiadiazole alkylamides described in Figure 1. Where R is a saturated alkyl chain defined by saturated linear chains with 6 to 8 carbon atoms and X is defined as a hydrogen or iodine atom. The synthesis method used to synthesize these derivatives begins with the protection by acylation with acetic anhydride of the 4-hydroxyl group of the starting material corresponding to 4-Hydroxy-3-methoxybenzaldehyde or vanillin. The iodinated derivatives in C5 of the vanillyl group are obtained through an iodination reaction with potassium iodide and commercial sodium hypochlorite, as shown in Figure 4; subsequently the hydroxyl group of this product corresponding to 4-Hydroxy-3-iodo-5-methoxybenzaldehyde or 5-lodovanillin was protected with acetic anhydride. The 1, 3, 4-thiadiazole heterocycle was obtained using the oxidative cyclisation of thiosemicarbazone method, shown in Figure 5, where the aldehyde of the respective protected compounds vanillin and 5-lodovanillin were condensed with thiosemicarbazone to obtain the thiosemicarbazone derivatives, from which through oxidative cyclization with ferric chloride in an aqueous medium the derivates of 1, 3, 4-thiadiazole-2-amino with the unprotected hydroxyl group were obtained in the same reaction stage. Subsequently, these products of 1, 3, 4-thiadiazole-2-amino were acylated according to the route shown in Figure 6 with derivatives of acyl chlorides corresponding to acid chlorides with linear hydrocarbonated chains of 6-9 carbon atoms, and the results of this acylation reaction were products acylated both in the hydroxyl and amino groups, and the final synthesis phase therefore consisted of the basic hydrolysis of the ester formed to obtain the respective compounds described in Figure 1 with the free hydroxyl group, thus making it possible to obtain the following compounds: [a] N-[5-(4-hydroxy-5-methoxy-3-iodophenyl)-1,3,4-thiadiazole-2-yl]- nonamide,[b] N-[5-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-1, 3, 4- thiadiazole-2-yl]- nonamide,[c] N-[5-(4-hydroxy-5-methoxy-3-iodophenyl)-1,3,4-thiadiazole-2-yl]-octanamide,[d] N-[5-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyfenil)-1, 3, 4- thiadiazole-2-yl]-octanamide,[e]N-[5-(4-hydroxy-5-methoxy-3-iodophenyl)-1,3,4-thiadiazole-2-yl]heptanamide,[f] N-[5-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyfenil)-1, 3, 4- thiadiazole-2-yl]-heptanamide,[g]N-[5-(4-hydroxy-5-methoxy-3-iodophenyl)-1,3,4-thiadiazole-2-yl]-hexanamide, y[h] N-[5-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyfenil)-1, 3, 4-thiadiazole-2-yl]-hexanamide. The second aspect of this invention is related to chalcone derivatives or alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl derivatives, as described in Figures 2 and 3. Where the different R's correspond to the different substituent groups: R1 corresponds to a hydrogen, a methoxyl group or a hydroxyl group;R2 is a hydrogen or a methoxyl group;R3 is a hydrogen or a chlorine group;R4 is a hydrogen or a bromine group; andR5 is a hydrogen, a methoxyl group or a hydroxyl group; The synthesis method for the compounds described in Figures 2 and 3 consisted in applying Claisen-Schmidt condensation between different benzaldehydes and acetophenones. The condensation reactions were carried out under basic and acidic catalytic conditions at ambient temperature and under reflux conditions, respectively, as shown in Figure 7. The combination of these different substituents led to the following compounds: [i](2E)-1-(4-bromodiphenyl)-3-phenylprop-2-en-1-one,[j](2E)-1-(4-bromodiphenyl)-3-(4-methoxyphenyl)prop-2-en-1-one,[k](2E)-1-(4-bromodiphenyl)-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)prop-2-en-1-one,[I](2E)-1-(4-bromodiphenyl)-3-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)prop-2-en-1-one,[m](1E, 4E)-1,5-diphenylpenta-1,4-dien-3-one,[n](1E, 4E)-1,5-(4-hydroxydiphenyl)penta-1,4-dien-3-one,[o](1E, 4E)-1,5-(4-metoxydiphenyl)penta-1,4-dien-3-one,[p](2E)-2-chlorine-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-1-phenylprop-2-en-1-one,[q](2E)-2-chlorine-3-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-1-phenylprop-2-en-1-one. These compounds present themselves as an alternative for treatment of diseases involving a overactivation of the TRPV-1 receptors. In vitro tests done using rat HEK-293T cell cultures with overexpressed TRPV-1, based on fluorometric measurements of inflow of induced calcium, after the activation of the TPRV-1 receptor by capsaicin, indicated that the compounds [a-h] and [i-q] inhibit the inflow of calcium, observed by a reduction in cellular fluorescence, exhibiting strong antagonistic activity for the activation mode of the TRPV-1 receptor by capsaicin (Figures 14-17). These compounds, [a-h] y [i-q], also show antagonistic activity on the temperature activation mode of the TRPV-1 receptor (Figures 19-21), this activity being represented by the average of relative fluorescence obtained at 54°C in two independent assays, the temperature at which the receptor TRPV-1 presents its maximum activation. From the respective dose-response curves for the compounds with antagonistic activity presented in Figures 22 and 23, the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) was determined as presented in Tables 7 and 8, these values indicating antagonistic activity in the nanomolar order, with IC50 ranging from 0.4-1.2 nM, demonstrating that these compounds are potent antagonists of the TRPV-1 receptor, with an activity superior to that shown by many competitive antagonists and by antagonists derived from vanilloid compounds, which are associated with a different mode of binding on the orthosteric site of the TRPV-1 receptor and the establishment of hydrophobic interactions on an undescribed binding site that contributes to the increase in antagonistic activity, based on the structure-activity analysis and conformational aspects of the synthesized compounds related to the planarity and conformational restriction imposed by the 1, 3, 4-thiadiazole heterocycle and the alpha, beta unsaturated carbonyl system, present in compounds [a-h] and [i-q], respectively. The compounds described here, are characterized mainly for exhibiting antagonistic activity on TRPV-1 receptors with an increased conformational restriction, which contributes to the increase of ligand-receptor binding energy and affects the greater antagonistic activity, and also for acquiring a different conformation within the pharmacophore regions, to that associated previously with antagonistic activity. Thus, in the derivatives of 1, 3, 4-thiadiazole alkylamides, the conformational restriction is regulated through the isosteric replacement of the amide group present in capsaicin analogues, by the 1, 3, 4-thiadiazole heterocycle, which allows the synthesized compounds to acquire a coplanar conformation between the donor-acceptor region of the hydrogen bonds of the vanillyl group and the polar region of the 1, 3, 4-thiadiazole group, while the incorporation of an amide group as a spacer allows for a double conformation between the donor-acceptor region of the hydrogen bonds (vanillyl group) and the hydrophobic region made up of aliphatic linear chains. This permits the obtention of iodinated and non-iodinated vanilloid analogs with a potent antagonistic activity, the effect of the latter being the opposite to the effect shown by vanilloid compounds with a non-iodinated vanillyl group, which usually have agonistic activity with the exception of capsazepine, a non-iodinated vanilloid derivative and the first identified competitive antagonist of capsaicin; however, it is of low potency (IC50: 56.2 nM), metabolically unstable and has a low selectivity for the TRPV-1 receptor (23.45) unlike the derivatives of 1, 3, 4-thiadiazole alkylamides, which have a high conformational restriction favoring their selectivity for TRPV-1 receptors. In this way the conformational restriction imposed by the 1, 3, 4-thiadiazole heterocycle and the amide group, allow for the stabilization of the conformational state of the TRPV-1 receptor responsible for its inactivation, which explains the antagonism exhibited by both non iodinated and iodinated derivatives in the vanilloid group that are associated with a different mode of union than that used by antagonistic vanilloid compounds on the orthosteric binding site of the receptor. With derivatives of chalcones or alpha, beta unsaturated carbonyls, the conformational restriction is regulated through a double unsaturated bond and the elimination of spacer groups commonly found in compounds with activity on receptors TRPV-1, such as amino, oxo or methylene groups, which have been shown to influence agonistic and antagonistic activity; thus it has been revealed that with capsaicin analogues with agonistic activity, the substitution of the methylene group between the vanillyl group (donor-acceptor region of hydrogen bonds) and amide (polar region) by an ethylene or carbonyl group notably reduces the agonistic activity of the compounds (47), while the absence of this spacer region in capsaicin and thiourea analogs eliminates both agonistic and antagonistic activity respectively (47,48,49). Hence the structural changes obtained through the synthesis of chalcone derivatives allow for the obtention of potent antagonists of the TRPV-1 receptor with nanomolar activity, which in addition to being associated with a greater conformational restriction is related to the anti-coplanar conformation between the donor-acceptor region of the hydrogen bonds and the hydrophobic region formed by the aryl groups. The aforementioned changes also permit the obtention of molecules with a low molecular weight which facilitate the pharmacological development of orally administered TRPV-1 receptor antagonists to increase bioavailability.

The compound activity was based on the capsaicin and temperature activation mechanism of the TRPV-1 receptor, which raised the levels of intracellular calcium as a consequence of the opening of the ionic channel of the receptor. The influx of calcium was measured with a fluorescent probe, Fluo 4-AM, as in the presence of an antagonist the calcium influx is blocked by the inactivation of the TRPV-1 receptor and cellular fluorescence decreases. Cell Culture The HEK-293T cells were cultured in a DMEM medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 50U/ml penicillin, 50mg/ml streptomycin and 2mM L-glutamine. The cultures were kept at 37°, in a 5% CO2 environment, with 80% relative humidity. DNA Transfection The HEK-293T cells were transfected with rat TPRV-1 pcDNA3, 97 µL of Opti-MEM and 3µL of Lipofectamine 2000 were added to a reaction tube and to a second tube 1µg of DNA and one volume of Opti-MEM were added to complete 100µL. Both tubes were incubated for 10 minutes, after which they were mixed and incubated for another 15 minutes. Solutions Used with the Assayed Compounds The compounds destined to be used in the screening assays on TRPV-1 receptors were prepared in a mother solution of 10,000X in DMSO, ethanol or isopropanol and afterwards diluted for the assay in a Ringer medium until reaching a concentration of 1µM. Solutions of capsaicin, BCTC, Lanthanum, and Ruthenium Red were used as controls at final concentrations of 0.031 µM, 1 µM, 100 µM and 10 µM, respectively. Treatment with FLUO-4AM After 48 hours of transfection the cells were treated with 200 µL of trypsin, left to incubate for 5 minutes at room temperature, then gently pipetted and transposed to a 15ml tube. After being centrifuged at a speed of 6,000rpm for 10 minutes, the cells were re-suspended in 1 ml of Ringer medium, adding 1 µl of Fluo-4AM 1000X, and incubated at 37ºC for half an hour. After being centrifuged and washed with pH 7.34 PBS 1X to remove the excess probe the cell pellet was re-suspended in 1.5ml of Ringer medium. Activation of TRPV-1 Receptor by Capsaicin Assay Once the rat TRPV-1 receptor had been transfected, Fluo-4 AM charged HEK 293T cells were plated out in 48-well plates at a cellular density of 50,000 cells per well, with a transfection percentage of 40-50%. Subsequently, 2 µL/well of each assayed compound and 2 µL/well of a capsaicin solution 0.031µM in 0.1 % ethanol were added. The cells were left to incubate for a period of 2-5 minutes at room temperature, after which fluorescence measurements were taken. These measurements were effected before adding the capsaicin and after adding the capsaicin. The fluorescence measurements were taken in real time on a PCR system every ten seconds in 13 cycles at 25°C. The normalized data were expressed as changes in fluorescence in response to capsaicin in time, shown in Figures 14 to 17. The average values ± standard deviations obtained from the execution of two independent experiments were graphed. Activation of TRPV-1 Receptor by Temperature Assay Once the rat TRPV-1 receptor had been transfected, Fluo-4 AM charged HEK 293T cells were plated out in 48-well plates at a cellular density of 50,000 cells per well, with a transfection percentage of 40-50%. Subsequently 2 µL/well of each assayed compound were added and the cells left to incubate at room temperature for 5-10 minutes before the execution of the experiment by temperature. The fluorescence measurements were then read on a real time PCR system that allows an increment of 1°C every 35 seconds from 36°C to 55°C for compounds and from 22-56 °C for transfected cells in absence of compounds. Reading of the fluorescence measurement was done using a FAM filter (483-533nM). The fluorescence data were obtained for each temperature and each compound, and have been corrected subtracting the cellular background and the base line corresponding to the fluorescence at the start of the ramp (22 or 36°C) for each sample. The values were then normalized, the data being expressed as relative fluorescence, which is the ratio between the fluorescence variation and the base line. The results were graphed in Figures 18 to 21 as the average ± standard deviation at a temperature of 54º C obtained in two independent experiments. Dose Response Curve An assay was carried out on temperature activation of the TRPV-1 receptor by incubating the transfected and Fluo-4AM charged HEK-293T cells in the presence of different concentrations of each compound assayed: 1 µM; 0.1 µM; 0.01 µM; 0.003 µM; 0.001 µM; 0.0003 µM, 0.0001 µM y 0.00001 µM. The relative fluorescence data obtained at 50°C was then used to calculate the fluorescence ratio, which is presented as normalized in relation to the relative fluorescence at initial concentration. In this way, the fluorescence ratios obtained through two independent experiments were averaged and expressed with the respective standard deviation. The dose response curves are presented in Figures 22 and 23, in which the fluorescence ratio versus the logarithmic molar concentration were adjusted to a 4 parameter sigmoidal inhibition curve, determining the respective values corresponding to the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) for each of the evaluated compounds. These values are shown for both groups of compounds, in Tables 7 and 8.Table 7: Values of IC50 of 1, 3, 4-thiadiazol alkylamide derivatives and control antagonist BCTC.CompoundIC50(nM)a0,046 ± 0,004b0,145 ± 0,051d1,092 ± 0,497e1,263 ± 0,009h0,298 ± 0,026BCTC2,120 ± 0,354Table 8: Values of IC50 of compounds derived from chalcones or unsaturated alpha, beta carbonyl derivatives and control agonist BCTC.CompoundIC50(nM)j3,892 ± 0,225I1,016 ± 0,206m7,551 ± 1,898n0,184 ± 0,023q0,257 ± 0,016BCTC2,120 ± 0,354 Compounds derived from 1, 3, 4-thiadiazol alkylamides CHARACTERIZED because they inhibit TRPV-1 receptor activation.
