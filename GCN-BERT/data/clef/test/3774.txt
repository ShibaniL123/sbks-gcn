(Example 52)
Step 1
To Compound 196 (1.00 g, 5.75 mmol) in acetonitrile (20 mL) suspension were added 4-bromobutanoyl chloride (0.798 mL, 6.90 mmol) and potassium carbonate (1.99 g, 14.4 mmol), and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 21 hours. After the insoluble material was removed by filtration, and the filtrate solution was concentrated under reduced pressure. The concentrated residue was dissolved in chloroform (50 mL), and washed with water (30 mL). The aqueous layer was re-extracted with chloroform (50mL), the organic layer was dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. After concentration, the residue was purified by silica gel chromatography (chloroform - methanol), and obtained solid was washed with hexane to obtain Compound 197 (990 mg, 71% yield) as a white solid.
