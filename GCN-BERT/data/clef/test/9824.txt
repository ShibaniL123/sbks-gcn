(Synthesis of compound 2)
The compound 1 (398.4 mg, 1.22 mmol) was charged into an eggplant flask, and 5 mL of dichloromethane was then added. This was stirred at room temperature for 5 minutes, and then 7 mL of TFA was added, and stirred at room temperature for 2 hours. After evaporating the solvent under reduced pressure, vacuum drying was performed to obtain a compound 2 (318.8 mg, 96%) .
