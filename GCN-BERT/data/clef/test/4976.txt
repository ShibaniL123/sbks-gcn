Preparation of compound 19-e.
Compound 19-f (5.5 g, 22.9 mmol) was dissolved in phosphorus oxychloride (30 mL), N,N-dimethylaniline (5 mL) was added and the reaction mixture was heated at 110Â°C for 18 hours. The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature, the reaction mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure to remove phosphorus oxychloride. The residue was concentrated and dried. The residue was dissolved with dichloromethane (500 mL) and washed with water (500 mL). The separated organic phase was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (petroleum ether: dichloromethane = 3: 1) to deliver a pale yellow solid 19-e (2.5 g, yield: 40%).
