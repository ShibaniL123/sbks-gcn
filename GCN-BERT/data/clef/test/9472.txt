Embodiment 1 An embodiment of the present invention provides a random selection method, applied in a distributed system of online games. The random selection method of this embodiment may be applied to a server side. FIG. 1 is a flowchart of the random selection method of the embodiment of the present invention. As shown in FIG. 1, the random selection method includes: step 101: generating, by a server, a plurality of objects for an online game, and ordering randomly the plurality of objects; step 102: transmitting, by the server, display information to a plurality of clients, so as to make the ordered plurality of objects displayed on a display screen of each client in a manner of content being unknown, so that each user can randomly select the ordered plurality of objects; and step 103: designating, by the server, a user-selected object for the user according to feedback from the client. In this embodiment, the online game may be chess and card online games, such as Blackjack, Texas HoldEm Poker, and mah-jong, etc. And the object (which may also be referred to as an option) may be a virtual card, poker, or mah-jong, etc. in an online game. However, it is not limited thereto, and particular options may be determined as actually required. In this embodiment, the online game may run in a distributed system, which may include geographically-distributed server and client. For example, it may be a server and several clients, each user playing an online game with other users via a client. However, it is not limited thereto, and there may be a plurality of servers, for example. For the convenience of explanation, following description is given taking that there are one server and a plurality of clients as an example. FIG. 2 is a schematic diagram of the construction of the distributed system of the embodiment of the present invention. As shown in FIG. 2, the distributed system 200 may include, for example, a server 201, a notebook computer 202, a working station 203, and a terminal 204, etc. The notebook computer 202, working station 203 and terminal 204 may be clients of the present invention used by users, and those clients are connected to the server 201 via a network, for example, they can be connected via a modem 205. In this embodiment, a client has a display screen which may display related information of an online game, for example, a virtual player and various properties may be displayed by images. The client may further have an input device, such as a keypad, a mouse or a touch screen, and the user may interact with other users via the input device. In this embodiment, the server may generate a plurality of objects for an online game, such as cards; however, it is not limited thereto. For the convenience of explanation, following description is given taking cards as an example. For example, the server may generate 54 cards, and then randomly order the 54 cards by using random algorithms. For example, 1973rand.num may be used, which passes the international authentication and ensures the randomness of card dealing. In such a random algorithm, the random ordering of all the cards in each round is generated on the basis of the random ordering of all the cards in the last round. Hence, a repeated random series will not be generated. However, it is not limited thereto, and other random algorithms may be used. In this embodiment, the server may transmit information of the ordered plurality of objects to a client participating in the online game, such that the plurality of objects are displayed on the display screen of the client in a manner of content being unknown; that is, the plurality of objects are arranged on the display screen, but all the users do not know the contents of the objects. For example, the backs of the plurality of objects may be displayed on the display screen, or the fronts may be displayed with the contents being blocked. The following description is given taking that the backs of the objects are displayed as an example; however, it is not limited thereto, and particular implementation may be determined as actually required. FIG. 3 is a schematic diagram showing that a certain client displays a plurality of objects. As shown in FIG. 3, 22 cards are arranged on the display screen of the client and their backs are displayed, which are displayed to a user in a “facing down” manner. In this embodiment, a user may randomly select the plurality of objects displayed by a client, and each user may select according to the order in turn. For example, a user may be assigned as the dealer, and the dealer may select the first card after the game starts, then the next user may select the second card, and so on. All players may select cards clockwise around a virtual table in the game. In this embodiment, the users may use input devices to select. For example, they may select by clicking with mice, or may select by clicking with touch screens. And the client may transmit information of the selected objects to the server, and the server designates an object selected by a user to the user. FIG. 4 is a schematic diagram showing the display of the client after selection by a user. As shown in FIG. 4, after random selection by the user, the card is turned over and the content of the card is displayed. However, the content of the selected card is still unknown to other users and is in an unselectable state. FIG. 5 is a schematic diagram showing display of other client after selection by a user, and FIG. 6 is a schematic diagram showing display of other client after selection by two users. As shown in FIGS. 5 and 6, after random selection by the user, the card turns grey and is unselectable, and other users can only randomly select from the rest of the objects. It should be noted that FIGS. 3-6 schematically show displays of the clients in a tiled clicking manner. However, the present invention is not limited thereto, and particular contents and manners of display may be determined as actually required. For example, a client may display in a superimposed tiling manner. FIG. 7 is another schematic diagram showing that a client displays a plurality of objects, and FIG. 8 is still another schematic diagram showing that a client displays a plurality of objects. As shown in FIGS. 7 and 8, a plurality of cards may be superimposed and tiled for randomly selecting by users. It can be seen from the above embodiment that the server randomly order a plurality of objects, a user randomly selects an object from the ordered plurality of objects, and the selected object is designated to the user according to the information fed back by the user, such that the user may participate in the process of random selection, and random ordering by the system and the random selection by the user are combined, thereby the fairness of the random dealing is ensured. Embodiment 2 On the basis of embodiment 1, another embodiment of the present invention provides a random selection method, applicable to a distributed system of online games. The random selection method of this embodiment may be applied to a server side. FIG. 9 is another flowchart of the random selection method of the embodiment of the present invention. As shown in FIG. 9, the random selection method comprises: step 901: generating, by a server, a plurality of objects for an online game, and ordering randomly the plurality of objects; step 902: transmitting, by the server, display information to a plurality of clients, so as to make the backs of the ordered plurality of objects displayed on a display screen of each client, so that each user can randomly select the ordered plurality of objects; step 903: receiving, by the server, information on a selected object transmitted by a user via a client, and designating the selected object to the user; step 904: updating information displayed on other clients, so that other users cannot select the object that has been selected; and step 905: judging whether the plurality of objects are all selected, terminating the process of random selection if the plurality of objects are all selected, and executing step 903 to continue the random selection if there remain objects that are not selected. In this embodiment, each user may randomly select multiple times in an order of players, such as all players select cards clockwise around a virtual table in the game. For example, in a card game, 54 cards may be generated and 4 users participate in the game; thus, each user may randomly select 12 times and get 12 cards, while the rest 6 cards are left for the banker. In this way, interaction between a server and a client is incorporated into the present invention. At the beginning of a game, the server randomly order all the cards for the first time, however, the cards selected by the users are not decided by the first-time random ordering; and the users also participate in the process of card dealing, having half of the initiative. The selection of the cards listed on the operating interface of the client by the users is also random, thereby constituting a secondary random process of card selection. This not only enhances greatly the fairness of a game, but also greatly enhances excitement of the game, and the game experiences of the players are also enriched. In implementation, a linked list may be used to carry out the present invention; however, it is not limited thereto, and an array may used in implementation, for example. The present invention will be described below taking a linked list as an example, in which 22 cards are to be selected. FIG. 10 is a schematic diagram showing that randomly-ordered cards are stored in a linked list. As shown in FIG. 10, each item in the linked list may include two parts: a value of a card and an index of a card. In the process of card selection, a server may generate a linked list poker, then randomly order the 22 cards by using a random algorithm (for example, the 1973rand.num algorithm), and the randomly-ordered cards are stored in the linked list poker shown in FIG. 10. Thereafter, the server may transmit the backs of the 22 cards (which may be a card box when being displayed on the operating interface) to the clients of all the users participating in the game, each card being actually representative of an index value. At a certain client, the user may randomly select one card from the 22 cards, and the client transmits the index value of the selected card to the server. The server inquires a corresponding value of the card in the linked list after receiving the index value transmitted by the client, and transmits the value of the card to the client. The client displays the value of the selected card. After an object is selected, it may be deleted from the linked list, and hence, it cannot be selected by a user. FIG. 11 is a schematic diagram showing that the linked list shown in FIG. 10 is selected once. As shown in FIG. 11, the index value and card value of the 22nd card are deleted. In this embodiment, a user may randomly select once or more times according to the rules for gaming. In implementation, the first card of each of the players may be taken as a “Hole card” (for example, refer to the description of the Zynga Poker), which may be seen by the user himself, and others may only see the back of the card. However, it is not limited thereto, and it may also be that the user cannot see the cards of other users. Particular implementation may be determined according to ways of playing of online games. Following description is given in detail in conjunction with FIGS. 12-22 taken a particular game as an example. For example, each user may select 3 cards on his own, and after selection of cards of all users, the card box and the cards of all the users may be shown. As shown in FIGS. 12-22, there may be 5 users A-E participating in the game. FIGS. 12-22 are schematic diagram showing partial views of the client corresponding to user C. FIG. 12 shows a scene before the game starts, FIG. 13 shows a scene of the first user A in selecting his/her first card, FIG. 14 shows a scene of the user C in selecting his/her first card, FIG. 15 shows a scene of the next user D in selecting his/her first card, FIG. 16 shows a scene of the user C in selecting his/her second card, FIG. 17 shows a scene of the next user D in selecting his/her second card, FIG. 18 shows a scene of the first user A in selecting his/her third card, FIG. 19 shows a scene of the user C in selecting his/her third card, in which the user B has folded, FIG. 20 shows a scene of the next user D in selecting his/her third card, FIG. 21 shows a scene in which the selection of the cards of all the users has done and the user B has folded, and FIG. 22 shows a scene in which faces of all the cards are displayed at a stage of comparison. It can be seen from the above embodiment that the server randomly order a plurality of objects, a user randomly selects an object from the ordered plurality of objects, and the user-selected object is designated to the user according to the information fed back by the user, such that the user may participate in the process of random selection, and random ordering by the system and the random selection by the user are combined, thereby the fairness of the random dealing is ensured. Embodiment 3 This embodiment of the present invention provides a random selection method, applied in a distributed system of online games. The random selection method of this embodiment may be applied to a client side, and those identical parts could refer to embodiment 1 or 2. FIG. 23 is another flowchart of the random selection method of the embodiment of the present invention. As shown in FIG. 23, the random selection method includes: step 2301: receiving, by a client, information from a server, and displaying a plurality of randomly-ordered objects on a display screen; step 2302: receiving, by the client, input information of a user, so as to randomly select from the plurality of objects; and step 2303: transmitting, by the client to the server, information of the selected object. In this embodiment, a client may display a plurality of objects in a tiling or superimposed tiling manner. And a user may randomly select in a clicking selection manner, and a client receives information inputted by the user, so as to realize random selection of the plurality of objects. FIG. 24 is still another flowchart of the random selection method of the embodiment of the present invention. As shown in FIG. 24, the random selection method comprises: step 2401: receiving, by a client, information from a server, and displaying a plurality of randomly-ordered objects on a display screen; step 2402: receiving, by the client, input information of a user, so as to randomly select from the plurality of objects; step 2403: transmitting, by the client to the server, information of the selected objects; step 2404: displaying, by the client, the object designated by the server for the user; step 2405: receiving, by the client, update information from the server, and updating the displayed information so that the object that has been selected cannot be selected again; and step 2406: judging whether the plurality of objects are all selected, terminating the process of random selection if the plurality of objects are all selected, and executing step 2402 to continue the random selection if there remain objects that are not selected. It can be seen from the above embodiment that the server randomly order a plurality of objects, a user randomly selects an object from the ordered plurality of objects, and the user-selected object is designated to the user according to the information fed back by the user, such that the user may participate in the process of random selection, and random ordering by the system and the random selection by the user are combined, thereby the fairness of the random dealing is ensured.
