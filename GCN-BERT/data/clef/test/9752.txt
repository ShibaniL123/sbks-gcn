Example 7. Preparation of N-(3-(4-(4-(cyclopropylmethyl)piperazine-1-carbonyl)phenyl)prop-2-ynyl)-N-phenylpentaneamide (LMT-828)
The N-phenyl-N-(3-(4-(piperazine-1-carbonyl)phenyl)prop-2-ynyl)pentaneamide (50 mg, 0.124 mmol) obtained in Example 2 and potassium carbonate (51 mg, 0.372 mmol) were dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF; 2 ml), and stirred at room temperature for 5 minutes. Cyclopropylmethyl bromide (15 µl, 0.145 mmol) was added to the mixture, heated at 80 °C, refluxed and stirred for 4 hours. An organic solvent layer was collected, dehydrated with anhydrous magnesium sulfate (MgSO4), filtered, and then concentrated under reduced pressure. The concentrate was purified by silica gel column chromatography (CH2Cl2:MeOH=50:1), thereby obtaining a final product, N-(3-(4-(4-(cyclopropylmethyl)piperazine-1-carbonyl)phenyl)prop-2-ynyl)-N-phenylpentanamide (16 mg, 28% yield).
