A foodstuff piping device Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a device for piping foodstuffs. More particularly, the present invention relates to a device for piping semi-solid foodstuffs, either hot or cold, for culinary purposes. Background Pastry bags or piping bags are cone- or triangular-shaped, hand-held bags made from cloth, paper, or plastic that are used to pipe, or deliver as a stream, semi-solid foods in relatively precise amounts to specific or precise locations, by squeezing the bag to press the contents through a narrow opening at one end of the bag. These types of bag are commonly used for many purposes including cake decoration. Differently-shaped nozzles are usually fitted to the narrow opening to produce different shapes, such as a round profile or cross-section, stars, leaf, and petal shapes. Fluted tips can be used to shape savoury foods such as the filling for devilled eggs, whipped butter, and mashed potatoes. The bags can be disposable or re-usable. Reusable bags are usually washed by hand and hung open to dry. This can be messy and difficult for a user. Using disposable bags can be wasteful and inconvenient if large numbers are required, or if a user runs out at a critical point in the cooking process. Piping bags can also be difficult for a user to use and manipulate, especially novice users. They also require filling before use, which can be time-consuming and difficult for an inexperienced user. Furthermore, they cannot be used to pipe hot foodstuffs. Prior Art Accordingly a number of patent applications have been filed in an attempt to resolve the problem or similar, including the following: W0200790588 describes and shows a disposable piping bag that comprises a container of polymer film. The piping bag is formed essentially from a pair of thinwalled polymer films, and the outwardly oriented surface of the piping bag has a rough surface structure. WO200848915 describes and shows a topping tool assembly comprising a bag support, a mounting bracket fixed to the bag support, and an anchor bracket. The topping tool assembly is installed in a kitchen or other food preparation area by attaching the anchor bracket to a suitable supporting surface, and it receives and supports a pastry bag in a generally vertical orientation such that a top of the pastry bag is exposed through the bag receiving end of the bag support and a bottom decorative tip of the pastry bag protrudes from the bottom dispensing end of the bag support. When a pastry bag is supported in this manner, a user may manually apply pressure at the top of the pastry bag and locate a pastry, cake, or other item just beneath the dispensing end while the dispensing tip of the pastry bag remains at a constant position and orientation. CN201256852U describes and shows a push-style feeder. One end of a barrelshaped container is in threaded connection with a cover body which is connected with an output pipe. The other end of the container is provided with a plunger piston. To use the feeder, semi-solid food is put inside the container, and an outlet pipe opening is extended into the mouth of a baby or a patient. The plunger piston is pushed so that the spoon meal enters the mouth from the output opening. In contrast the present invention provides a piping device of simple construction that can be easily and simply used and which does not require practice and dexterity to use. Summary of the Invention According to a first aspect, the present invention provides a foodstuff piping device comprising: a body configured to hold a food cartridge arranged in use to contain a quantity of semi-solid foodstuff, in which the cartridge provides a first and a second opposed apertures arranged to extend through the wall of the cartridge; a plunger arranged in use to be connected to the body and arranged in use so that at least part of the plunger is linearly moveable relative to the body so as to exert pressure on the foodstuff in the cartridge; and a plunger activating means configured to activate operation of the plunger. The plunger may be arranged in use to extend through the first aperture of the cartridge. The plunger may be linearly moveable through the first aperture and relative to the body. This allows a user to pipe semi-solid foodstuffs without needing to fill and use a heavy and awkward piping bag. The plunger activating means may be user operable. The plunger activating means may comprise a lever that extends from the body. A lever is a simple mechanism that can easily be operated by a user when they are holding the bag in position. The body may further comprise a handle configured to be grasped by a user to manipulate the piping device. This allows a user to more easily hold and more accurately position the piping device. The lever and handle may be positioned and configured so that a user can grasp the handle and pull the lever in the same or similar manner to a trigger. This allows a user to more accurately position the piping device and more easily operate the lever. The body may further comprise a frame and a base. The frame may extend from a base and may be configured to receive a food cartridge, the plunger, and plunger activating means, such as for example a handle and lever extending from the base. This configuration is convenient and easy to use. The base may further comprise a one-way movement mechanism associated with the plunger and plunger activating means, such as for example the lever. The one-way movement mechanism may be configured to allow the plunger to move towards the frame but not away from the frame. This allows a user to press the lever multiple times to move the plunger through the food cartridge. The one-way movement mechanism may be configured so that a user can unlock the mechanism by fully displacing the plunger activating means, for example depressing the lever, in order to enable the plunger to be moveable in either direction, for example manually moveable. This allows a user to release the plunger from the cartridge so that the cartridge can be replaced. The frame and base may be releasably connectable. This allows the body to be disassembled for cleaning or similar. The plunger may further comprise a shaft comprising a proximal end and a distal end, and a pushing plate connected at the distal end of the shaft. The plane of the pushing plate preferably extends substantially perpendicularly to the axis of the shaft. The food cartridge may further comprise a container of regular cross-section and a base cap slidable within the container. The edges of the cap are preferably arranged to be slideable relative to and to remain substantially in contact with the inner surface of the container. The plunger and cartridge are preferably configured in use such that the plunger will contact and exert pressure on the base cap in use. The container is preferably elongate. The first aperture is preferably provided at a first end of the container, and the second aperture is preferably provided at a second opposed end of the container. The base cap is preferably shaped and dimensioned to be received within the first aperture. The base cap is preferably shaped and dimensioned to substantially seal the first aperture. The container may have at least one internal groove that runs substantially the length of the container, for example substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis of the container. The base cap may comprise at least one protrusion or extension shaped and dimensioned to be received within the at least one internal groove. This helps to retain the base cap in the container in the correct alignment. The at least one groove may have a kink located adjacent to or at the first end of the container. This allows a user to lock the base cap or to prevent the base cap of inadvertent movement. The foodstuff piping device may further comprise a nozzle. The nozzle may be located at or adjacent the second end of the body. The second aperture provided by the second end of the body may be aligned in use with the nozzle. The second aperture may be provided by the nozzle. . This allows a user to more accurately direct their piping. The nozzle may be releasably connectable to the container. The container may comprise a nozzle aperture through which foodstuff can pass to the nozzle in use. This allows the nozzle to be disconnected for replacement or ease of cleaning or similar. The foodstuff piping device may further comprise a plurality of nozzles. Each nozzle provides an exit aperture. The exit aperture may be provided by the second aperture of the body. Each exit aperture may have a different shape. This allows a user to choose a suitable nozzle to create the particular piped pattern they desire. The shape of the nozzle aperture may be selected from one or more of the following: circular, oval, star-shaped. These allow a user to create the particular piped pattern they desire. The body may further comprise a removable lid. The lid may comprise an aperture which is arranged in use to be aligned with the first aperture of the body. The first aperture of the body may be provided by the lid. This allows the body to be refilled and cleaned easily. According to a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a cartridge for a foodstuff piping device, comprising: a body configured to hold a quantity of semi-solid foodstuff, in which the body provides first and second opposed apertures; and a base cap arranged in use to be slidable within the body such that the the edges of the cap are arranged to remain substantially in contact with the inner surface of the container. A cartridge of this construction can be pre-filled and quickly and easily fitted to a suitable foodstuff piping device. The body preferably has a regular cross-section. The container is preferably elongate. A first aperture is preferably provided by a first end and a second aperture is preferably provided at a second opposed end of the body. The base cap is preferably arranged in use to be received in and to substantially seal the first aperture.

Detailed Description of Figures A foodstuff piping device 1 according to an embodiment of the present invention will now be described with reference to the figures. The foodstuff piping device 1 has two main parts: a body 2, and a food cartridge 3. These parts and the manner in which they interact are described below. Food Cartridge The cartridge 3 has an elongate cylindrical main body 10, each end of the main body 10 open to form a first aperture 4 and second aperture 5. The first aperture 4 is closed by a base cap 11 which is slidable within the body 10 with the edges of the cap 11 in contact with the inner surface of the container 10. A removable lid 12 is connected to the other end of the body 10 to close the other end, although the lid 12 has an aperture that acts as a continuation of the second aperture 5. The body 10 has an internal groove 13 formed in the inner surface that runs substantially the length of the container 10. The base cap 11 has a corresponding extension on one side that locates into the groove 13. This helps to keep the base cap in the correct position and alignment. The groove 13 has a kink towards the first aperture end of the body 10. This allows a user to lock the base cap 11 and helps to prevent inadvertent movement of the base cap 11. A clear window strip (not shown) runs substantially the axial length of the body 10 to allow a user to see how much of the contents remains. The lid has an extension portion that extends outwards, the aperture formed through the extension portion. A nozzle 14 is mutually configured with the extension portion to connect to the lid 12. The nozzle is conical, the wider end connecting to the lid 12, and has a nozzle aperture at the outer end. This allows a user to more accurately direct their piping. The nozzle aperture can be circular, oval, star-shaped, bias cut at an angle, or shaped as required. In use, semi-solid foodstuffs are forced through the nozzle by a user, and can be shaped and piped as required. As the nozzle 14 can be detached from the lid 12, different nozzles can be connected/attached as required, with different exit aperture/nozzle aperture shapes to form different patterns. This allows a user to choose a suitable nozzle to create the particular piped pattern they desire. In use, the cartridge 3 holds a quantity of semi-solid foodstuff, such as cake icing, pastry, mash, or similar. Pressure or force is applied to the base cap 11 to move it from it's starting position at or towards the end of the body 10 down towards the second aperture and the nozzle 14. This causes the foodstuff to be forced as a stream through the nozzle aperture so that a user can pipe the foodstuff as required, for example, forming patterns and shapes with the stream. Body The body 2 has two main sub-parts: a base 9 and frame 7. The frame 7 and base 9 are releasably connected to one another. The frame 7 is configured to securely hold the food cartridge 3 so that the end with the first aperture 4 is adjacent to the base 9, and so that the nozzle 14 extends from the other end. The base 9 has a handle 16 that extends from one side of the base 9 and which is grasped by a user to manipulate the foodstuff piping device 1 in use. A lever 8 is positioned in front of the handle 16 so that a user can grasp the handle and wrap their fingers around the lever 8 in a similar manner to a trigger and pull the lever 8 towards the handle 16. A plunger 6 passes through the base 9, the plunger formed from an elongate shaft 15 having a base plate 18 that can be used as a plunger handle, and a pushing plate connected at the other or outer end of the shaft. The shaft 15 is aligned with and coaxial with a food cartridge 3 in position on the frame 7. The shaft 15 of the plunger 6 can be moved linearly through the base 9 by a user operating the lever 8. The base 9 has an internal one-way movement mechanism associated with the shaft of the plunger 6 and lever 8 so that when the lever 8 is operated, the shaft 15 moves one way through the base 9 towards the frame 7 but is stopped from moving the other way, and will remain in position even when the lever is released and moves away from the handle 16. This allows a user to press the lever 8 multiple times to move the plunger 6 through the base 6. The one-way movement mechanism is configured so that a user can unlock the mechanism by fully depressing the lever 8 which then allows the user to pull on the plunger to manually set the position. This also allows a user to fully release the plunger so that the cartridge can be replaced. In use, a user operates the lever 8 to move the plunger 6 through the base 9. The base plate 18 contacts the base cap 11 and as a user continues to operate the lever the base plate 18 exerts pressure on the base cap causing this to slide along the inside of the cylinder body 10. This causes the base cap to exert pressure on the semi-solid foodstuff in the cylinder and it exits through the nozzle 14 as a stream, allowing a user to use this to 'pipe' as required e.g. to ice a cake, create mash shapes or pureed vegetable shapes, etc. The foodstuff piping device of the present invention allows a user to pipe with hot foods as well as cold, and allows a user to pre-prepare and pre-load cartridges as required. The foodstuff piping device is easier for a user to control than a flexible, floppy and bulbous piping bag, and is easier to clean for repeated uses. A number of cartridges can be prepared as required and quickly and easily interchanged as required, speeding up food preparation. Alternatively these could be bought pre-filled, and if for hot food heated appropriately e.g. in a microwave.
