METHODS AND COMPOSITIONS FOR WEED CONTROL CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/779,532, filed March 13, 2013, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The invention relates generally to the field of weed management. More specifically, the invention relates to control of Lolium weed species and compositions containing polynucleotide molecules. The invention further provides methods and compositions useful for Lolium control. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Weeds are plants that compete with cultivated plants in an agronomic environment and cost farmers billions of dollars annually in crop losses and the expense of efforts to keep weeds under control. Weeds also serve as hosts for crop diseases and insect pests. Weeds are plants that are unwanted in any particular environment. The losses caused by weeds in agricultural production environments include decreases in crop yield, reduced crop quality, increased irrigation costs, increased harvesting costs, reduced land value, injury to livestock, and crop damage from insects and diseases harbored by the weeds. The principal means by which weeds cause these effects are: 1) competing with crop plants for water, nutrients, sunlight and other essentials for growth and development, 2) production of toxic or irritant chemicals that cause human or animal health problem, 3) production of immense quantities of seed or vegetative reproductive parts or both that contaminate agricultural products and perpetuate the species in agricultural lands, and 4) production on agricultural and nonagricultural lands of vast amounts of vegetation that must be disposed of. Herbicide tolerant weeds are a problem with nearly all herbicides in use, there is a need to effectively manage these weeds. There are over 365 weed biotypes currently identified as being herbicide resistant to one or more herbicides by the Herbicide Resistance Action Committee (HRAC), the North American Herbicide Resistance Action Committee (NAHRAC), and the Weed Science Society of America (WSSA).

Embodiments of this invention include compositions including oligonucleotides having a length of 19-25 nucleotides (19-mers, 20-mers, 21-mers, 22-mers, 23-mers, 24-mers, or 25-mers), or medium-length polynucleotides having a length of 26 or more nucleotides (polynucleotides of 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 46, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, about 65, about 70, about 75, about 80, about 85, about 90, about 95, about 100, about 110, about 120, about 130, about 140, about 150, about 160, about 170, about 180, about 190, about 200, about 210, about 220, about 230, about 240, about 250, about 260, about 270, about 280, about 290, or about 300 nucleotides), or long polynucleotides having a length greater than about 300 nucleotides (for example, polynucleotides of between about 300 to about 400 nucleotides, between about 400 to about 500 nucleotides, between about 500 to about 600 nucleotides, between about 600 to about 700 nucleotides, between about 700 to about 800 nucleotides, between about 800 to about 900 nucleotides, between about 900 to about 1000 nucleotides, between about 300 to about 500 nucleotides, between about 300 to about 600 nucleotides, between about 300 to about 700 nucleotides, between about 300 to about 800 nucleotides, between about 300 to about 900 nucleotides, or about 1000 nucleotides in length, or even greater than about 1000 nucleotides in length, for example up to the entire length of a herbicide target gene including coding or non-coding or both coding and non-coding portions of the target gene). A herbicide target gene comprises any polynucleotide molecule of the gene in a plant cell or fragment thereof for which the modulation of the expression of the herbicide target gene product is provided by the methods and compositions of the present invention. Where a polynucleotide is double-stranded, its length can be similarly described in terms of base pairs. Oligonucleotides and polynucleotides of the present invention can be made that are essentially identical or essentially complementary to adjacent genetic elements of a gene, for example, spanning the junction region of an intron and exon, the junction region of a promoter and a transcribed region, the junction region of a 5’ leader and a coding sequence, the junction of a 3’ untranslated region and a coding sequence. Polynucleotide compositions used in the various embodiments of this invention include compositions including oligonucleotides or polynucleotides or a mixture of both, including RNA or DNA or RNA/DNA hybrids or chemically modified oligonucleotides or polynucleotides or a mixture thereof. In some embodiments, the polynucleotide may be a combination of ribonucleotides and deoxyribonucleotides, for example, synthetic polynucleotides consisting mainly of ribonucleotides but with one or more terminal deoxyribonucleotides or synthetic polynucleotides consisting mainly of deoxyribonucleotides but with one or more terminal dideoxyribonucleotides. In some embodiments, the polynucleotide includes non-canonical nucleotides such as inosine, thiouridine, or pseudouridine. In some embodiments, the polynucleotide includes chemically modified nucleotides. Examples of chemically modified oligonucleotides or polynucleotides are well known in the art; see, for example, US Patent Publication 20110171287, US Patent Publication 20110171176, and US Patent Publication 20110152353, US Patent Publication, 20110152346, US Patent Publication 20110160082, herein incorporated by reference. For example, including but not limited to the naturally occurring phosphodiester backbone of an oligonucleotide or polynucleotide can be partially or completely modified with phosphorothioate, phosphorodithioate, or methylphosphonate intemucleotide linkage modifications, modified nucleoside bases or modified sugars can be used in oligonucleotide or polynucleotide synthesis, and oligonucleotides or polynucleotides can be labeled with a fluorescent moiety (for example, fluorescein or rhodamine) or other label (for example, biotin). The polynucleotides can be single- or double-stranded RNA or single- or double-stranded DNA or double-stranded DNA/RNA hybrids or modified analogues thereof, and can be of oligonucleotide lengths or longer. In more specific embodiments of the invention the polynucleotides that provide single-stranded RNA in the plant cell are selected from the group consisting of (a) a single-stranded RNA molecule (ssRNA), (b) a single-stranded RNA molecule that self-hybridizes to form a double-stranded RNA molecule, (c) a double-stranded RNA molecule (dsRNA), (d) a single-stranded DNA molecule (ssDNA), (℮) a single-stranded DNA molecule that self-hybridizes to form a double-stranded DNA molecule, and (f) a single-stranded DNA molecule including a modified Pol III gene that is transcribed to an RNA molecule, (g) a double-stranded DNA molecule (dsDNA), (h) a double-stranded DNA molecule including a modified Pol III gene that is transcribed to an RNA molecule, (i) a double-stranded, hybridized RNA/DNA molecule, or combinations thereof. In some embodiments these polynucleotides include chemically modified nucleotides or non-canonical nucleotides. In embodiments of the method the polynucleotides include double-stranded DNA formed by intramolecular hybridization, double-stranded DNA formed by intermolecular hybridization, double-stranded RNA formed by intramolecular hybridization, or double-stranded RNA formed by intermolecular hybridization. In one embodiment the polynucleotides include single-stranded DNA or single-stranded RNA that self-hybridizes to form a hairpin structure having an at least partially double-stranded structure including at least one segment that will hybridize to RNA transcribed from the gene targeted for suppression. Not intending to be bound by any mechanism, it is believed that such polynucleotides are or will produce single-stranded RNA with at least one segment that will hybridize to RNA transcribed from the gene targeted for suppression. In certain other embodiments the polynucleotides further includes a promoter, generally a promoter functional in a plant, for example, a pol II promoter, a pol III promoter, a pol IV promoter, or a pol V promoter. The term "gene" refers to chromosomal DNA, plasmid DNA, cDNA, intron and exon DNA, artificial DNA polynucleotide, or other DNA that encodes a peptide, polypeptide, protein, or RNA transcript molecule, and the genetic elements flanking the coding sequence that are involved in the regulation of expression, such as, promoter regions, 5’ leader regions, 3’ untranslated regions. Any of the components of the herbicide target gene are potential targets for the oligonucleotides and polynucleotides of the present invention. The polynucleotide molecules of the present invention are designed to modulate expression by inducing regulation or suppression of an endogenous herbicide target gene in a ryegrass plant and are designed to have a nucleotide sequence essentially identical or essentially complementary to the nucleotide sequence of the gene or to the sequence of RNA transcribed from the target gene, which can be coding sequence or non-coding sequence. These effective polynucleotide molecules that modulate expression are referred to as “a trigger, or triggers”. By “essentially identical” or “essentially complementary” is meant that the trigger polynucleotides (or at least one strand of a double-stranded polynucleotide or portion thereof, or a portion of a single strand polynucleotide) are designed to hybridize to the endogenous gene noncoding sequence (including promoters and regulatory elements of the gene) or to RNA transcribed (known as messenger RNA or an RNA transcript) from the endogenous gene to effect regulation or suppression of expression of the endogenous gene. Trigger molecules are identified by “tiling” the gene targets with partially overlapping probes or non-overlapping probes of antisense or sense polynucleotides that are essentially identical or essentially complementary to the nucleotide sequence of an endogenous gene. Multiple target sequences can be aligned and sequence regions with homology in common, according to the methods of the present invention, are identified as potential trigger molecules for the multiple targets. Multiple trigger molecules of various lengths, for example 19-25 nucleotides, 26-50 nucleotides, 51-100 nucleotides, 101-200 nucleotides, 201-300 nucleotides or more can be pooled into a few treatments in order to investigate polynucleotide molecules that cover a portion of a gene sequence (for example, a portion of a coding versus a portion of a noncoding region, or a 5 ’ versus a 3 ’ portion of a gene) or an entire gene sequence including coding and noncoding regions of a target gene. Polynucleotide molecules of the pooled trigger molecules can be divided into smaller pools or single molecules inorder to identify trigger molecules that provide the desired effect. The herbicide target gene RNA and DNA polynucleotide molecules are sequenced by any number of available methods and equipment. Some of the sequencing technologies are available commercially, such as the sequencing-by-hybridization platform from Affymetrix Inc. (Sunnyvale, Calif.) and the sequencing-by-synthesis platforms from 454 Life Sciences (Bradford, Conn.), Illumina/Solexa (Hayward, Calif.) and Helicos Biosciences (Cambridge, Mass.), and the sequencing-by-ligation platform from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, Calif.), as described below. In addition to the single molecule sequencing performed using sequencing-by-synthesis of Helicos Biosciences, other single molecule sequencing technologies are encompassed by the method of the invention and include the SMRT.TM. technology of Pacific Biosciences, the Ion Torrent.TM. technology, and nanopore sequencing being developed for example, by Oxford Nanopore Technologies. Embodiments of single-stranded polynucleotides functional in this invention have sequence complementarity that need not be 100 percent, but is at least sufficient to permit hybridization to RNA transcribed from the herbicide target gene or DNA of the herbicide target gene to form a duplex to permit a gene silencing mechanism. Thus, in embodiments, a polynucleotide fragment is designed to be essentially identical to, or essentially complementary to, a sequence of 19 or more contiguous nucleotides in either DNA gene sequence or messenger RNA transcribed from the target gene. By “essentially identical” is meant having 100 percent sequence identity or at least about 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, or 99 percent sequence identity when compared to the sequence of 19 or more contiguous nucleotides in either the target gene or RNA transcribed from the target gene; by “essentially complementary” is meant having 100 percent sequence complementarity or at least about 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, or 99 percent sequence complementarity when compared to the sequence of 19 or more contiguous nucleotides in either the target gene or RNA transcribed from the target gene. In some embodiments of this invention polynucleotide molecules are designed to have 100 percent sequence identity with or complementarity to one allele or one family member of a given target gene (coding or non-coding sequence of a gene for of the present invention); in other embodiments the polynucleotide molecules are designed to have 100 percent sequence identity with or complementarity to multiple alleles or family members of a given target gene. In certain embodiments, the polynucleotides used in the compositions that are essentially identical or essentially complementary to the target gene or transcript will comprise the predominant nucleic acid in the composition. Thus in certain embodiments, the polynucleotides that are essentially identical or essentially complementary to the target gene or transcript will comprise at least about 50%, 75%, 95%, 98% or 100% of the nucleic acids provided in the composition by either mass or molar concentration. However, in certain embodiments, the polynucleotides that are essentially identical or essentially complementary to the target gene or transcript can comprise at least about 1% to about 50%, about 10% to about 50%, about 20% to about 50%, or about 30% to about 50% of the nucleic acids provided in the composition by either mass or molar concentration. Also provided are compositions where the polynucleotides that are essentially identical or essentially complementary to the target gene or transcript can comprise at least about 1% to 100%, about 10% to 100%, about 20% to about 100%, about 30% to about 50%, or about 50% to a 100% of the nucleic acids provided in the composition by either mass or molar concentration. "Identity" refers to the degree of similarity between two polynucleic acid or protein sequences. An alignment of the two sequences is performed by a suitable computer program. A widely used and accepted computer program for performing sequence alignments is CLUSTALW vl.6 (Thompson, et al. Nucl. Acids Res., 22: 4673-4680, 1994). The number of matching bases or amino acids is divided by the total number of bases or amino acids, and multiplied by 100 to obtain a percent identity. For example, if two 580 base pair sequences had 145 matched bases, they would be 25 percent identical. If the two compared sequences are of different lengths, the number of matches is divided by the shorter of the two lengths. For example, if there are 100 matched amino acids between a 200 and a 400 amino acid protein, they are 50 percent identical with respect to the shorter sequence. If the shorter sequence is less than 150 bases or 50 amino acids in length, the number of matches are divided by 150 (for nucleic acid bases) or 50 (for amino acids), and multiplied by 100 to obtain a percent identity. Trigger molecules for specific herbicide target gene family members can be identified from coding and/or non-coding sequences of gene families of a plant or multiple plants, by aligning and selecting 200-300 polynucleotide fragments from the least homologous regions amongst the aligned sequences and evaluated using topically applied polynucleotides (as sense or anti-sense ssDNA or ssRNA, dsRNA, or dsDNA) to determine their relative effectiveness in inducing the herbicidal phenotype. The effective segments are further subdivided into 50-60 polynucleotide fragments, prioritized by least homology, and reevaluated using topically applied polynucleotides. The effective 50-60 polynucleotide fragments are subdivided into 19-30 polynucleotide fragments, prioritized by least homology, and again evaluated for induction of the yield/quality phenotype. Once relative effectiveness is determined, the fragments are utilized singly, or again evaluated in combination with one or more other fragments to determine the trigger composition or mixture of trigger polynucleotides for providing the yield/quality phenotype. Trigger molecules for broad activity against Lolium weed species can be identified from coding and/or non-coding sequences of gene families of a plant or multiple plants, by aligning and selecting 200-300 polynucleotide fragments from the most homologous regions amongst the aligned sequences and evaluated using topically applied polynucleotides (as sense or anti-sense ssDNA or ssRNA, dsRNA, or dsDNA) to determine their relative effectiveness in inducing the yield/quality phenotype. The effective segments are subdivided into 50-60 polynucleotide fragments, prioritized by most homology, and reevaluated using topically applied polynucleotides. The effective 50-60 polynucleotide fragments are subdivided into 19-30 polynucleotide fragments, prioritized by most homology, and again evaluated for induction of the yield/quality phenotype. Once relative effectiveness is determined, the fragments may be utilized singly, or in combination with one or more other fragments to determine the trigger composition or mixture of trigger polynucleotides for providing the yield/quality phenotype. Methods of making polynucleotides are well known in the art. Chemical synthesis, in vivo synthesis and in vitro synthesis methods and compositions are known in the art and include various viral elements, microbial cells, modified polymerases, and modified nucleotides. Commercial preparation of oligonucleotides often provides two deoxyribonucleotides on the 3 ’ end of the sense strand. Long polynucleotide molecules can be synthesized from commercially available kits, for example, kits from Applied Biosystems/Ambion (Austin, ΤΧ) have DNA ligated on the 5 ’ end in a microbial expression cassette that includes a bacterial Τ7 polymerase promoter that makes RNA strands that can be assembled into a dsRNA and kits provided by various manufacturers that include Τ7 RiboMax Express (Promega, Madison, WI), AmpliScribe T7-Flash (Epicentre, Madison, WI), and TranscriptAid Τ7 High Yield (Fermentas, Glen Bumie, MD). dsRNA molecules can be produced from microbial expression cassettes in bacterial cells (Ongvarrasopone et al. ScienceAsia 33:35-39; Yin, Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol 84:323-333, 2009; Liu et al., BMC Biotechnology 10:85, 2010) that have regulated or deficient RNase III enzyme activity or the use of various viral vectors to produce sufficient quantities of dsRNA. In some embodiments design parameters such as Reynolds score (Reynolds et al. Nature Biotechnology 22, 326 330 (2004) and Tuschl rules (Pei and Tuschl, Nature Methods 3(9): 670-676, 2006) are known in the art and are used in selecting polynucleotide sequences effective in gene silencing. In some embodiments random design or empirical selection of polynucleotide sequences is used in selecting polynucleotide sequences effective in gene silencing. In some embodiments the sequence of a polynucleotide is screened against the genomic DNA of the intended plant to minimize unintentional silencing of other genes. The polynucleotide compositions of this invention are useful in compositions, such as solutions of polynucleotide molecules, at low concentrations, alone or in combination with other components either in the same solution or in separately applied solutions that provide a permeability-enhancing agent. While there is no upper limit on the concentrations and dosages of polynucleotide molecules that can useful in the methods of this invention, lower effective concentrations and dosages will generally be sought for efficiency. The concentrations can be adjusted in consideration of the volume of spray or treatment applied to plant leaves or other plant part surfaces, such as flower petals, stems, tubers, fruit, anthers, pollen, or seed. In one embodiment, a useful treatment for herbaceous plants using 25-mer oligonucleotide molecules is about 1 nanomole (ηΜ) of oligonucleotide molecules per plant, for example, from about 0.05 to 1 ηΜ per plant. Other embodiments for herbaceous plants include useful ranges of about 0.05 to about 100 ηΜ , or about 0.1 to about 20 ηΜ, or about 1 ηΜ to about 10 ηΜ of polynucleotides per plant. To illustrate embodiments of the invention, the factor IX, when applied to oligonucleotide molecules is arbitrarily used to denote a treatment of 0.8 ηΜ of polynucleotide molecule per plant; 10Χ, 8 ηΜ of polynucleotide molecule per plant; and 100Χ, 80 ηΜ of polynucleotide molecule per plant. The polynucleotide compositions of this invention are useful in compositions, such as liquids that comprise polynucleotide molecules, alone or in combination with other components either in the same liquid or in separately applied liquids that provide a transfer agent. As used herein, a transfer agent is an agent that, when combined with a polynucleotide in a composition that is topically applied to a target plant surface, enables the polynucleotide to enter a plant cell. In certain embodiments, a transfer agent is an agent that conditions the surface of plant tissue, ℮. g., leaves, stems, roots, flowers, or fruits, to permeation by the polynucleotide molecules into plant cells. The transfer of polynucleotides into plant cells can be facilitated by the prior or contemporaneous application of a polynucleotide-transferring agent to the plant tissue. In some embodiments the transferring agent is applied subsequent to the application of the polynucleotide composition. The polynucleotide transfer agent enables a pathway for polynucleotides through cuticle wax barriers, stomata and/or cell wall or membrane barriers into plant cells. Suitable transfer agents to facilitate transfer of the polynucleotide into a plant cell include agents that increase permeability of the exterior of the plant or that increase permeability of plant cells to oligonucleotides or polynucleotides. Such agents to facilitate transfer of the composition into a plant cell include a chemical agent, or a physical agent, or combinations thereof. Chemical agents for conditioning or transfer include (a) surfactants, (b) an organic solvent or an aqueous solution or aqueous mixtures of organic solvents, (c) oxidizing agents, (d) acids, (℮) bases, (f) oils, (g) enzymes, or combinations thereof. Embodiments of the method can optionally include an incubation step, a neutralization step (e.g., to neutralize an acid, base, or oxidizing agent, or to inactivate an enzyme), a rinsing step, or combinations thereof. Embodiments of agents or treatments for conditioning of a plant to permeation by polynucleotides include emulsions, reverse emulsions, liposomes, and other micellar-like compositions. Embodiments of agents or treatments for conditioning of a plant to permeation by polynucleotides include counter-ions or other molecules that are known to associate with nucleic acid molecules, ℮. g., inorganic ammonium ions, alkyl ammonium ions, lithium ions, polyamines such as spermine, spermidine, or putrescine, and other cations. Organic solvents useful in conditioning a plant to permeation by polynucleotides include DMSO, DMF, pyridine, /Y-pyrrolidinc, hexamethylphosphoramide, acetonitrile, dioxane, polypropylene glycol, other solvents miscible with water or that will dissolve phosphonucleotides in ηοηaqueous systems (such as is used in synthetic reactions). Naturally derived or synthetic oils with or without surfactants or emulsifiers can be used, ℮. g., plant-sourced oils, crop oils, such as those listed in the 9th Compendium of Herbicide Adjuvants, can be used, ℮. g., paraffinic oils, polyol fatty acid esters, or oils with short-chain molecules modified with amides or polyamines such as polyethyleneimine or /Y-pyrrolidinc. Transfer agents include, but are not limited to, organosilicone preparations. In certain embodiments, an organosilicone preparation that is commercially available as Silwet® L-77 surfactant having CAS Number 27306-78-1 and ΕΡΑ Number: CAL.REG.NO. 5905-50073-AA, and currently available from Momentive Performance Materials, Albany, New York can be used to prepare a polynucleotide composition.

Organosilicone preparations used in the methods and compositions provided herein can comprise one or more effective organosilicone compounds.

An aspect of the invention provides a method for modulating expression of an herbicide target gene in a Lolium plant including (a) conditioning of a plant to permeation by polynucleotides and (b) treatment of the plant with the polynucleotide molecules, wherein the polynucleotide molecules include at least one segment of 19 or more contiguous nucleotides cloned from or otherwise identified from the target gene in either anti-sense or sense orientation, whereby the polynucleotide molecules permeate the interior of the plant and induce modulation of the target gene. The conditioning and polynucleotide application can be performed separately or in a single step. When the conditioning and polynucleotide application are performed in separate steps, the conditioning can precede or can follow the polynucleotide application within minutes, hours, or days. In some embodiments more than one conditioning step or more than one polynucleotide molecule application can be performed on the same plant. In embodiments of the method, the segment can be cloned or identified from (a) coding (protein-encoding), (b) non-coding (promoter and other gene related molecules), or (c) both coding and non-coding parts of the target gene. Non-coding parts include DNA, such as promoter regions or the RNA transcribed by the DNA that provide RNA regulatory molecules, including but not limited to: introns, 5’ or 3’ untranslated regions, and microRNAs (miRNA), trans-acting siRNAs, natural anti-sense siRNAs, and other small RNAs with regulatory function or RNAs having structural or enzymatic function including but not limited to: ribozymes, ribosomal RNAs, t-RNAs, aptamers, and riboswitches.

Polynucleotides of the invention related to trigger molecules of the Loliurn rigidum herbicide target genes. The gene sequences and fragments of SEQ ID NO: 1-66 were selected into short polynucleotide lengths of 30 contiguous nucleotides as shown in Table 2, SEQ ID NO: 67-155. These polynucleotides are tested to select an efficacious trigger to any of the herbicide target gene sequence regions. The trigger polynucleotides are constructed as sense or anti-sense ssDNA or ssRNA, dsRNA, or dsDNA, or dsDNA/RNA hybrids and combined with an organosilicone based transfer agent and nonpolynucleotide herbicide to provide a new herbicidal composition. The polynucleotides are combined into sets of two to three polynucleotides per set, using 4-8 ηΜ of each polynucleotide. Each polynucleotide set is prepared with the organosilicone transfer agent and applied to a Lolium plant or to a field of crop plants containing ryegrass plants in combination with a nonpolynucleotide herbicide that targets one or more of the enzymes of the herbicide target genes, or followed by the nonpolynucleotide herbicide treatment one to three days later. The effect is measured as stunting the growth and/or killing of the plant and is measured 8-14 days after treatment with the herbicidal composition. The most efficacious trigger sets are identified and the individual polynucleotides are tested in the same methods as the sets are and the most efficacious single polynucleotide is identified. By this method it is possible to identify one oligonucleotide or several oligonucleotides that effect plant sensitivity to nonpolynucleotide herbicide. It is contemplated that additional 19-30 polynucleotides can be selected from the sequences of SEQ ID NO: 1-66 that are specific for a herbicide target gene in Lolium rigidum or include activity against a related weed species, for example, Lolium canariense Steud.

Lolium plants are grown in the greenhouse (30 / 20 C day/night Τ; 14 hour photoperiod) in 4 inch square pots containing Sun Gro® Redi-Earth and 3.5 kg/cubic meter Osmocote® 14-14-14 fertilizer. When the plants at 5 to 10 cm in height are pre-treated with a mixture of single-strand antisense or double-strand polynucleotides (ssDNA ro dsRNA targeting one or more of the herbicide target gene sequences from SEQ ID NO: 1-66) at 16 ηΜ, formulated in 10 millimolar sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) containing 2% ammonium sulfate and 0.5% Silwet L-77. Plants are treated manually by pipetting 10 pL of polynucleotide solution on fully expanded mature leaves, for a total of 40 microliters of solution per plant. Twenty-four and forty-eight hours later, the plants are treated with and effective dose of the nonpolynucleotide herbicide corresponding to the herbicide target gene in which the polynucleotides have homology. Four replications of each treatment is conducted. Plant height is determined just before treatment and at intervals upto twelve days after herbicide treatments to determine effect of the polynucleotide and herbicide treatments. Example 4. A method to control Lolium in a field. A method to control Lolium in a field comprises the use of trigger polynucleotides that can modulate the expression of one or more herbicide target genes in Lolium. In Table 2, an analysis of herbicide target gene sequences provided a collection of 30-mer polynucleotides that can be used in compositions to affect the growth or develop or sensitivity to a nonpolynucleotide herbicide to control multiple weed species in a field.

The composition can be provided as a tank mix, a sequential treatment of components (generally the polynucleotide followed by the nonpolynucleotide herbicide), a simultaneous treatment or mixing of one or more of the components of the composition from separate containers or as a premix of all of the components of the herbicidal composition. Members of the nonpolynucleotide herbicide families include but are not limited to amide herbicides, aromatic acid herbicides, arsenical herbicides, benzothiazole herbicides, benzoylcyclohexanedione herbicides, benzofuranyl alkylsulfonate herbicides, carbamate herbicides, cyclohexene oxime herbicides, cyclopropylisoxazole herbicides, dicarboximide herbicides, dinitroaniline herbicides, dinitrophenol herbicides, diphenyl ether herbicides, dithiocarbamate herbicides, halogenated aliphatic herbicides, imidazolinone herbicides, inorganic herbicides, nitrile herbicides, organophosphorus herbicides, oxadiazolone herbicides, oxazole herbicides, phenoxy herbicides, phenylenediamine herbicides, pyrazole herbicides, pyridazine herbicides, pyridazinone herbicides, pyridine herbicides, pyrimidinediamine herbicides, pyrimidinyloxybenzylamine herbicides, quaternary ammonium herbicides, thiocarbamate herbicides, thiocarbonate herbicides, thiourea herbicides, triazine herbicides, triazinone herbicides, triazole herbicides, triazolone herbicides, triazolopyrimidine herbicides, uracil herbicides, and urea herbicides.Treatment of the plants in the field can occur as often as needed to provide weed control and the components of the composition can be adjusted to target specific weed species or weed families. 1.
