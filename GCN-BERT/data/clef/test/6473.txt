FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a method of inhibiting copper deposition on hair and facilitating the removal of copper deposited on hair. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Many water sources that are used by consumers for personal care contain elevated levels of calcium and magnesium salts, as well as undesirable levels of redox metals (e.g., copper and/or iron) salts. As such, using chelants to sequester trace redox metals often proves to be ineffective because most chelants also competitively bind calcium and/or magnesium. It has been found that even trace quantities of these copper can deposit on the hair surface and in between the cuticle layers of hair. This deposition of copper on hair is especially problematic because transition metal ions, such as copper and iron, can facilitate reduction-oxidation (redox) reactions during hair coloring treatments and during UV exposure. These reactions generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), which in turn can cause damage to the hair. In addition, they can interfere with the oxidative color formation chemistry and lead to reduced color uptake for hair colorant users. Accordingly, there is a need for an improved hair care regimen that can inhibit copper deposition on hair, as well as facilitate the removal of copper already deposited thereon. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION A method of inhibiting copper deposition on hair and facilitating the removal of copper deposited on hair comprising (a) applying to the hair a shampoo composition comprising (i) from about 0.025% to about 0.25% histidine, by weight of the shampoo composition; (ii) from about 2% to about 50% of one or more detersive surfactants, by weight of the shampoo composition; and (iii) from about 20% to about 95% of a first aqueous carrier, by weight of the shampoo composition; (b) rinsing the shampoo composition from the hair; (c) applying to the hair a conditioner composition comprising (i) from about 0.025% to about 0.25% histidine, by weight of the conditioner composition; (ii) a gel matrix comprising (i) from about 0.1% to about 20% of one or more high melting point fatty compounds, by weight of the conditioner composition; (ii) from about 0.1% to about 10% of a cationic surfactant system, by weight of the conditioner composition; and (iii) at least 20% of a second aqueous carrier, by weight of the conditioner composition; (d) rinsing the conditioner composition from the hair; and (e) applying to the hair a leave-on treatment comprising (i) from about 0.025% to about 0.25% of a compound selected from the group consisting of ethylenediamine-N,N′-disuccinic acid (EDDS), derivatives of ethylenediamine-N,N′-disuccinic acid (EDDS), salts of ethylenediamine-N,N′-disuccinic acid (EDDS), and mixtures thereof, by weight of the leave-on treatment; (ii) one or more rheology modifiers; and (iii) at least 20% of a third aqueous carrier, by weight of the leave-on treatment.

EDDS & Histidine Histidine and ethylenediamine-N,N′-disuccinic acid (EDDS) are both chelants. It has been found that histidine and EDDS compounds have the high Formation Constant KML for copper and the low Formation Constant for calcium that is desired for efficient inhibition of deposition of copper (see Table 1 below) and can be formulated up to a level of 0.25% in shampoos. Histidine and/or EDDS may be present in a shampoo composition, conditioner composition, and/or leave-on treatment at a level of from about 0.025% to about 0.25%, alternatively from about 0.05% to about 0.2%, and alternatively from about 0.1% to about 0.15%, by weight of the shampoo composition, conditioner composition, or leave-on treatment. The Formation Constant of a metal chelant interaction is defined as: K ML = [ ML ] [ M ]  [ L ] where: [ML]=concentration of metal ligand complex at equilibrium [M]=concentration of free metal ion [L]=concentration of free ligand in a fully deprotonated form KML=formation constant for the metal chelant complex. All concentrations are expressed in mol/dm3. Formation Constants are conveniently expressed as logarithms.

The synthesis of EDDS from maleic anhydride and ethylene diamine may yield a mixture of three optical isomers, [R,R], [S,S], and [S,R] (25% S,S, 50% R,S and 25% R,R), due to the two asymmetric carbon atoms. The biodegradation of EDDS may be optical isomer-specific, with the [S,S] isomer degrading most rapidly and extensively. The shampoo composition and conditioner composition described herein comprises histidine. Histidine compounds means compounds according to the general formula (I) below wherein each X is independently selected from substituted or unsubstituted, saturated or unsaturated carbon, preferably unsubstituted and saturated carbon. n is 0-10, preferably 0-2, more preferably 0 R1 is selected from hydrogen, alkyl, aryl, arylalkyl or alkaryl, preferably hydrogen or alkyl, more preferably hydrogen Y is a heteroatom, preferably nitrogen Q is selected from nil, hydrogen, aryl or alkyl, preferably hydrogen R3 is selected from hydrogen, alkyl, aryl, arylalkyl or alkaryl, preferably hydrogen or alkyl, more preferably hydrogen R4 is independently selected from hydrogen and alkyl, preferably hydrogen Suitable histidine compounds for use herein include histidine and ester derivatives of histidine.

C. Publishing Co., and U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,929,678, 2,658,072; 2,438,091; 2,528,378, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. The shampoo composition may also comprise a shampoo gel matrix, an aqueous carrier, and other additional ingredients described herein. B. Aqueous Carrier The shampoo composition comprises a first aqueous carrier. Accordingly, the formulations of the shampoo composition can be in the form of pourable liquids (under ambient conditions).

The lower alkyl alcohols useful herein are monohydric alcohols having 1 to 6 carbons, in one aspect, ethanol and isopropanol. Exemplary polyhydric alcohols useful herein include propylene glycol, hexylene glycol, glycerin, and propane diol. Conditioner Composition The method of inhibiting copper deposition on hair and facilitating the removal of copper deposited on hair described herein comprises applying to the hair a conditioner composition after rinsing the shampoo composition from the hair. The conditioner composition described herein delivers consumer desired conditioning in addition to inhibiting the deposition of copper (i.e. from the water used to rinse) on the hair. The conditioner composition described herein comprises (i) from about 0.025% to about 0.25%, alternatively from about 0.05% to about 0.2%, alternatively from about 0.1% to about 0.15% histidine, by weight of the conditioner composition, and (ii) a conditioner gel matrix.

The conditioner composition also comprises a conditioner gel matrix comprising (1) one or more high melting point fatty compounds, (2) a cationic surfactant system, and (3) a second aqueous carrier. A. Cationic Surfactant System The conditioner gel matrix of the conditioner composition includes a cationic surfactant system. The cationic surfactant system can be one cationic surfactant or a mixture of two or more cationic surfactants. The cationic surfactant system can be selected from: mono-long alkyl quaternized ammonium salt; a combination of mono-long alkyl quaternized ammonium salt and di-long alkyl quaternized ammonium salt; mono-long alkyl amidoamine salt; a combination of mono-long alkyl amidoamine salt and di-long alkyl quaternized ammonium salt, a combination of mono-long alkyl amindoamine salt and mono-long alkyl quaternized ammonium salt. The cationic surfactant system can be included in the composition at a level by weight of from about 0.1% to about 10%, from about 0.5% to about 8%, from about 0.8% to about 5%, and from about 1.0% to about 4%. Mono-Long Alkyl Quaternized Ammonium Salt The monoalkyl quaternized ammonium salt cationic surfactants useful herein are those having one long alkyl chain which has about 22 carbon atoms and in one embodiment a C22 alkyl group. The remaining groups attached to nitrogen are independently selected from an alkyl group of from 1 to about 4 carbon atoms or an alkoxy, polyoxyalkylene, alkylamido, hydroxyalkyl, aryl or alkylaryl group having up to about 4 carbon atoms. Mono-long alkyl quaternized ammonium salts useful herein are those having the formula (I): wherein one of R75, R76, R77 and R78 is selected from an alkyl group of 22 carbon atoms or an aromatic, alkoxy, polyoxyalkylene, alkylamido, hydroxyalkyl, aryl or alkylaryl group having up to about 30 carbon atoms; the remainder of R75, R76, R77 and R78 are independently selected from an alkyl group of from 1 to about 4 carbon atoms or an alkoxy, polyoxyalkylene, alkylamido, hydroxyalkyl, aryl or alkylaryl group having up to about 4 carbon atoms; and X− is a salt-forming anion such as those selected from halogen, (e.g. chloride, bromide), acetate, citrate, lactate, glycolate, phosphate, nitrate, sulfonate, sulfate, alkylsulfate, and alkyl sulfonate radicals. The alkyl groups can contain, in addition to carbon and hydrogen atoms, ether and/or ester linkages, and other groups such as amino groups. The longer chain alkyl groups, e.g., those of about 22 carbons, or higher, can be saturated or unsaturated. One of R75, R76, R77 and R78 can be selected from an alkyl group of about 22 carbon atoms, the remainder of R75, R76, R77 and R78 are independently selected from CH3, C2H5, C2H4OH, and mixtures thereof; and X is selected from the group consisting of Cl, Br, CH3OSO3, C2H5OSO3, and mixtures thereof. Nonlimiting examples of such mono-long alkyl quaternized ammonium salt cationic surfactants include: behenyl trimethyl ammonium salt. Mono-Long Alkyl Amidoamine Salt Mono-long alkyl amines are also suitable as cationic surfactants. Primary, secondary, and tertiary fatty amines are useful. Particularly useful are tertiary amido amines having an alkyl group of about 22 carbons. Exemplary tertiary amido amines include: behenamidopropyldimethylamine, behenamidopropyldiethylamine, behenamidoethyldiethylamine, behenamidoethyldimethylamin. Useful amines in the present invention are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,275,055, Nachtigal, et al. These amines can also be used in combination with acids such as l-glutamic acid, lactic acid, hydrochloric acid, malic acid, succinic acid, acetic acid, fumaric acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, l-glutamic hydrochloride, maleic acid, and mixtures thereof; in one embodiment l-glutamic acid, lactic acid, and/or citric acid. The amines herein can be partially neutralized with any of the acids at a molar ratio of the amine to the acid of from about 1:0.3 to about 1:2, and/or from about 1:0.4 to about 1:1. Di-Long Alkyl Quaternized Ammonium Salt Di-long alkyl quaternized ammonium salt can be combined with a mono-long alkyl quaternized ammonium salt or mono-long alkyl amidoamine salt. It is believed that such combination can provide easy-to rinse feel, compared to single use of a monoalkyl quaternized ammonium salt or mono-long alkyl amidoamine salt. In such combination with a mono-long alkyl quaternized ammonium salt or mono-long alkyl amidoamine salt, the di-long alkyl quaternized ammonium salts are used at a level such that the wt % of the dialkyl quaternized ammonium salt in the cationic surfactant system is in the range of from about 10% to about 50%, and/or from about 30% to about 45%. The di-long alkyl quaternized ammonium salt cationic surfactants useful herein are those having two long alkyl chains having about 22 carbon atoms. The remaining groups attached to nitrogen are independently selected from an alkyl group of from 1 to about 4 carbon atoms or an alkoxy, polyoxyalkylene, alkylamido, hydroxyalkyl, aryl or alkylaryl group having up to about 4 carbon atoms. Di-long alkyl quaternized ammonium salts useful herein are those having the formula (II): wherein two of R75, R76, R77 and R78 is selected from an alkyl group of from 22 carbon atoms or an aromatic, alkoxy, polyoxyalkylene, alkylamido, hydroxyalkyl, aryl or alkylaryl group having up to about 30 carbon atoms; the remainder of R75, R76, R77 and R78 are independently selected from an alkyl group of from 1 to about 4 carbon atoms or an alkoxy, polyoxyalkylene, alkylamido, hydroxyalkyl, aryl or alkylaryl group having up to about 4 carbon atoms; and X− is a salt-forming anion such as those selected from halogen, (e.g. chloride, bromide), acetate, citrate, lactate, glycolate, phosphate, nitrate, sulfonate, sulfate, alkylsulfate, and alkyl sulfonate radicals. The alkyl groups can contain, in addition to carbon and hydrogen atoms, ether and/or ester linkages, and other groups such as amino groups. The longer chain alkyl groups, e.g., those of about 22 carbons, or higher, can be saturated or unsaturated. One of R75, R76, R77 and R78 can be selected from an alkyl group of from 22 carbon atoms, the remainder of R75, R76, R77 and R78 are independently selected from CH3, C2H5, C2H4OH, and mixtures thereof; and X is selected from the group consisting of Cl, Br, CH3OSO3, C2H5OSO3, and mixtures thereof. Such dialkyl quaternized ammonium salt cationic surfactants include, for example, dialkyl (C22) dimethyl ammonium chloride, ditallow alkyl dimethyl ammonium chloride, dihydrogenated tallow alkyl dimethyl ammonium chloride. Such dialkyl quaternized ammonium salt cationic surfactants also include, for example, asymmetric dialkyl quaternized ammonium salt cationic surfactants. B. High Melting Point Fatty Compound The conditioner gel matrix of the conditioner composition includes one or more high melting point fatty compounds. The high melting point fatty compounds useful herein may have a melting point of 25° C. or higher, and is selected from the group consisting of fatty alcohols, fatty acids, fatty alcohol derivatives, fatty acid derivatives, and mixtures thereof. It is understood by the artisan that the compounds disclosed in this section of the specification can in some instances fall into more than one classification, e.g., some fatty alcohol derivatives can also be classified as fatty acid derivatives. However, a given classification is not intended to be a limitation on that particular compound, but is done so for convenience of classification and nomenclature. Further, it is understood by the artisan that, depending on the number and position of double bonds, and length and position of the branches, certain compounds having certain carbon atoms may have a melting point of less than 25° C. Such compounds of low melting point are not intended to be included in this section. Nonlimiting examples of the high melting point compounds are found in International Cosmetic Ingredient Dictionary, Fifth Edition, 1993, and CTFA Cosmetic Ingredient Handbook, Second Edition, 1992. Among a variety of high melting point fatty compounds, fatty alcohols are suitable for use in the conditioner composition. The fatty alcohols useful herein are those having from about 14 to about 30 carbon atoms, from about 16 to about 22 carbon atoms. These fatty alcohols are saturated and can be straight or branched chain alcohols. Suitable fatty alcohols include, for example, cetyl alcohol, stearyl alcohol, behenyl alcohol, and mixtures thereof. High melting point fatty compounds of a single compound of high purity can be used. Single compounds of pure fatty alcohols selected from the group of pure cetyl alcohol, stearyl alcohol, and behenyl alcohol can also be used. By “pure” herein, what is meant is that the compound has a purity of at least about 90%, and/or at least about 95%. These single compounds of high purity provide good rinsability from the hair when the consumer rinses off the composition. The high melting point fatty compound can be included in the conditioner composition at a level of from about 0.1% to about 20%, alternatively from about 1% to about 15%, and alternatively from about 1.5% to about 8% by weight of the composition, in view of providing improved conditioning benefits such as slippery feel during the application to wet hair, softness and moisturized feel on dry hair. C. Aqueous Carrier The conditioner gel matrix of the conditioner composition includes a second aqueous carrier. Accordingly, the formulations of the conditioner composition can be in the form of pourable liquids (under ambient conditions). Such compositions will therefore typically comprise a second aqueous carrier, which is present at a level of from about 20 wt % to about 95 wt %, or from about 60 wt % to about 85 wt %. The second aqueous carrier may comprise water, or a miscible mixture of water and organic solvent, and in one aspect may comprise water with minimal or no significant concentrations of organic solvent, except as otherwise incidentally incorporated into the composition as minor ingredients of other components. The second aqueous carriers useful in the conditioner composition include water and water solutions of lower alkyl alcohols and polyhydric alcohols. The lower alkyl alcohols useful herein are monohydric alcohols having 1 to 6 carbons, in one aspect, ethanol and isopropanol. The polyhydric alcohols useful herein include propylene glycol, hexylene glycol, glycerin, and propane diol. Leave-on Treatment The method of inhibiting copper deposition on hair and facilitating the removal of copper deposited on hair described herein may also comprise applying a leave-on treatment to the hair after rinsing the conditioner from the hair. The leave-on treatment described herein may deliver consumer desired conditioning in addition to inhibiting the deposition of copper (i.e. from the water used to rinse) on the hair. The leave-on treatment described herein may comprise from about 0.025% to about 0.25%, alternatively from about 0.05% to about 0.2%, alternatively from about 0.1% to about 0.15% of a compound selected from the group consisting of ethylenediamine-N,N′-disuccinic acid (EDDS), derivatives of ethylenediamine-N,N′-disuccinic acid (EDDS), salts of ethylenediamine-N,N′-disuccinic acid (EDDS), and mixtures thereof, by weight of the leave-on treatment. The leave-on treatment also comprises (1) one or more rheology modifiers and (2) a third aqueous carrier. A. Rheology Modifier In one embodiment the leave-on treatment may include one or more rheology modifiers to adjust the rheological characteristics of the composition for better feel, in-use properties and the suspending stability of the composition. For example, the rheological properties are adjusted so that the composition remains uniform during its storage and transportation and it does not drip undesirably onto other areas of the body, clothing or home furnishings during its use. Any suitable rheology modifier can be used. In an embodiment, the leave-on treatment may comprise from about 0.01% to about 3% of a rheology modifier, alternatively from about 0.1% to about 1% of a rheology modifier, The one or more rheology modifier may be selected from the group consisting of polyacrylamide thickeners, cationically modified polysaccharidea, associative thickeners, and mixtures thereof. Associative thickeners include a variety of material classes such as, for example: hydrophobically modified cellulose derivatives; hydrophobically modified alkoxylated urethane polymers, such as PEG-150/decyl alcohol/SMDI copolymer, PEG-150/stearyl alcohol/SMDI copolymer, polyurethane-39; hydrophobically modified, alkali swellable emulsions, such as hydrophobically modified polypolyacrylates, hydrophobically modified polyacrylic acids, and hydrophobically modified polyacrylamides; hydrophobic ally modified polyethers. These materials may have a hydrophobe that can be selected from cetyl, stearyl, oleayl, and combinations thereof, and a hydrophilic portion of repeating ethylene oxide groups with repeat units from 10-300, alternatively from 30-200, and alternatively from 40-150.

Such compositions will therefore typically comprise a third aqueous carrier, which is present at a level of at least 20 wt %, from about 20 wt % to about 95 wt %, or from about 60 wt % to about 85 wt %. The third aqueous carrier may comprise water, or a miscible mixture of water and organic solvent, and in one aspect may comprise water with minimal or no significant concentrations of organic solvent, except as otherwise incidentally incorporated into the composition as minor ingredients of other components. The third aqueous carriers useful in the leave-on treatment include water and water solutions of lower alkyl alcohols and polyhydric alcohols. The lower alkyl alcohols useful herein are monohydric alcohols having 1 to 6 carbons, in one aspect, ethanol and isopropanol. The polyhydric alcohols useful herein include propylene glycol, hexylene glycol, glycerin, and propane diol. pH The shampoo composition, conditioner composition, and/or leave-on treatment may have a pH in the range from about 2 to about 10, at 25° C.

Thus, the shampoo composition, conditioner composition, and/or leave-on treatment can also be effective toward washing out the existing copper and redox metals deposits, which can reduce cuticle distortion and thereby reduce cuticle chipping and damage. In an embodiment, the shampoo composition and/or conditioning composition may comprise citric acid, wherein the citric acid acts as a buffer. Additional Components The shampoo composition, conditioner composition, and/or leave-on treatment (hair care compositions) described herein may optionally comprise one or more additional components known for use in hair care or personal care products, provided that the additional components are physically and chemically compatible with the essential components described herein, or do not otherwise unduly impair product stability, aesthetics or performance. Such additional components are most typically those described in reference books such as the CTFA Cosmetic Ingredient Handbook, Second Edition, The Cosmetic, Toiletries, and Fragrance Association, Inc. 1988, 1992. Individual concentrations of such additional components may range from about 0.001 wt % to about 10 wt % by weight of the hair care compositions.

The refractive index of the polysiloxane fluid will generally be less than about 1.70, typically less than about 1.60. In this context, polysiloxane “fluid” includes oils as well as gums. The high refractive index polysiloxane fluid includes those represented by general Formula (I) above, as well as cyclic polysiloxanes such as those represented by Formula (V) below: wherein R is as defined above, and n is a number from about 3 to about 7, or from about 3 to about 5.

Silicone Resins Silicone resins may be included in the silicone conditioning agent of the hair care compositions described herein. These resins are highly cross-linked polymeric siloxane systems. The cross-linking is introduced through the incorporation of trifunctional and tetrafunctional silanes with monofunctional or difunctional, or both, silanes during manufacture of the silicone resin. Silicone materials and silicone resins in particular, can conveniently be identified according to a shorthand nomenclature system known to those of ordinary skill in the art as “MDTQ” nomenclature. Under this system, the silicone is described according to presence of various siloxane monomer units which make up the silicone. Briefly, the symbol M denotes the monofunctional unit (CH3)3SiO0.5; D denotes the difunctional unit (CH3)2SiO; T denotes the trifunctional unit (CH3)SiO1.5; and Q denotes the quadra- or tetra-functional unit SiO2. Primes of the unit symbols (e.g. M′, D′, T′, and Q′) denote substituents other than methyl, and must be specifically defined for each occurrence. Suitable silicone resins for use in the hair care compositions described herein include, but are not limited to MQ, MT, MTQ, MDT and MDTQ resins. Methyl is a suitable silicone substituent. Other suitable silicone resins include MQ resins, wherein the M:Q ratio is from about 0.5:1.0 to about 1.5:1.0 and the average molecular weight of the silicone resin is from about 1000 to about 10,000. The weight ratio of the non-volatile silicone fluid, having refractive index below 1.46, to the silicone resin component, when used, can be from about 4:1 to about 400:1, from about 9:1 to about 200:1, from about 19:1 to about 100:1, particularly when the silicone fluid component is a polydimethylsiloxane fluid or a mixture of polydimethylsiloxane fluid and polydimethylsiloxane gum as described herein. Insofar as the silicone resin forms a part of the same phase in the compositions hereof as the silicone fluid, i.e. the conditioning active, the sum of the fluid and resin should be included in determining the level of silicone conditioning agent in the hair care compositions. b.

The following classes of ZLMs represent relatively common examples of the general category and are not intended to be limiting as to the broader scope of materials which fit this definition. Many ZLMs occur naturally as copper. In an embodiment, the ZLM is selected from the group consisting of: hydrozincite (zinc carbonate hydroxide), aurichalcite (zinc copper carbonate hydroxide), rosasite (copper zinc carbonate hydroxide), and mixtures thereof. Related copper that are zinc-containing may also be included in the composition. Natural ZLMs can also occur wherein anionic layer species such as clay-type copper (e.g., phyllosilicates) contain ion-exchanged zinc gallery ions. All of these natural materials can also be obtained synthetically or formed in situ in a composition or during a production process. Another common class of ZLMs, which are often, but not always, synthetic, is layered double hydroxides. In an embodiment, the ZLM is a layered double hydroxide conforming to the formula [M2+1−xM3+x(OH)2]x+Am−x/m.nH2O wherein some or all of the divalent ions (M2+) are zinc ions (Crepaldi, E L, Pava, P C, Tronto, J, Valim, J B J. Colloid Interfac. Sci. 2002, 248, 429-42). Yet another class of ZLMs can be prepared called hydroxy double salts (Morioka, H., Tagaya, H., Karasu, M, Kadokawa, J, Chiba, K Inorg. Chem. 1999, 38, 4211-6). In an embodiment, the ZLM is a hydroxy double salt conforming to the formula [M2+1−xM2+1+x(OH)3(1−y)]+An−(1=3y)/n.nH2O where the two metal ions (M2+) may be the same or different. If they are the same and represented by zinc, the formula simplifies to [Zn1+x(OH)2]2x+2xA−.nH2O. This latter formula represents (where x=0.4) materials such as zinc hydroxychloride and zinc hydroxynitrate. In an embodiment, the ZLM is zinc hydroxychloride and/or zinc hydroxynitrate. These are related to hydrozincite as well wherein a divalent anion replaces the monovalent anion. These materials can also be formed in situ in a composition or in or during a production process. In embodiments having a zinc-containing layered material and a pyrithione or polyvalent metal salt of pyrithione, the ratio of zinc-containing layered material to pyrithione or a polyvalent metal salt of pyrithione may be from about 5:100 to about 10:1, or from about 2:10 to about 5:1, or from about 1:2 to about 3:1. The on-scalp deposition of the anti-dandruff active may be at least about 1 microgram/cm2. The on-scalp deposition of the anti-dandruff active is important in view of ensuring that the anti-dandruff active reaches the scalp where it is able to perform its function. In an embodiment, the deposition of the anti-dandruff active on the scalp is at least about 1.5 microgram/cm2, or at least about 2.5 microgram/cm2, or at least about 3 microgram/cm2, or at least about 4 microgram/cm2, or at least about 6 microgram/cm2, or at least about 7 microgram/cm2, or at least about 8 microgram/cm2, or at least about 8 microgram/cm2, or at least about 10 microgram/cm2. The on-scalp deposition of the anti-dandruff active is measured by having the hair of individuals washed with a composition comprising an anti-dandruff active, for example a composition pursuant to the present invention, by trained a cosmetician according to a conventional washing protocol. The hair is then parted on an area of the scalp to allow an open-ended glass cylinder to be held on the surface while an aliquot of an extraction solution is added and agitated prior to recovery and analytical determination of anti-dandruff active content by conventional methodology, such as HPLC. The hair care compositions of the present invention may be presented in typical hair care formulations. They may be in the form of solutions, dispersion, emulsions, powders, talcs, encapsulated, spheres, spongers, solid dosage forms, foams, and other delivery mechanisms. The compositions of the embodiments of the present invention may be hair tonics, leave-on hair products such as treatment, and styling products, rinse-off hair products such as shampoos, and treatment products; and any other form that may be applied to hair. According to one embodiment, the hair care compositions may be provided in the form of a porous, dissolvable solid structure, such as those disclosed in U.S. Patent Application Publication Nos. 2009/0232873; and 2010/0179083, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. Accordingly, the hair care compositions comprise a chelant, a buffer system comprising an organic acid, from about 23% to about 75% surfactant; from about 10% to about 50% water soluble polymer; and optionally, from about 1% to about 15% plasticizer; such that the hair care composition is in the form of a flexible porous dissolvable solid structure, wherein said structure has a Percent open cell content of from about 80% to about 100%. According to another embodiment, the hair care compositions may be in the form of a porous dissolvable solid structure comprising a chelant; a buffer system comprising an organic acid from about 23% to about 75% surfactant; wherein said surfactant has an average ethoxylate/alkyl ratio of from about 0.001 to about 0.45; from about 10% to about 50% water soluble polymer; and from about 1% to about 15% plasticizer; and wherein said article has a density of from about 0.03 g/cm3 to about 0.20 g/cm3. According to another embodiment, the hair care compositions may be in the form of a viscous liquid comprising a chelant; a buffer system comprising an organic acid from 5-20% surfactant and a polycarboxylate rheology modifier; wherein the polycarboxylate is specifically chosen to be effective at the high electrolyte levels resulting from the incorporation of the key buffer system and chelant required for this invention. Non-limiting examples include acrylates/C10-C30 alkyl acrylate crosspolymers such as Carbopol EDT2020, 1342,1382, etc. from Lubrizol. Rheology benefits of these actives in our embodiments include stability, ease of dispensing, smoothness of spreading, etc. The hair care compositions are generally prepared by conventional methods such as are known in the art of making the compositions. Such methods typically involve mixing of the ingredients in one or more steps to a relatively uniform state, with or without heating, cooling, application of vacuum, and the like. The compositions are prepared such as to optimize stability (physical stability, chemical stability, photostability) and/or delivery of the active materials. The hair care composition may be in a single phase or a single product, or the hair care composition may be in a separate phases or separate products. If two products are used, the products may be used together, at the same time or sequentially. Sequential use may occur in a short period of time, such as immediately after the use of one product, or it may occur over a period of hours or days.

The formation of a shampoo gel matrix involves heating a dispersion of the fatty alcohol in water with the surfactant to a temperature above the melting point of the fatty alcohol. During the mixing process, the fatty alcohol melts, allowing the surfactant to partition into the fatty alcohol droplets. The surfactant brings water along with it into the fatty alcohol. This changes the isotropic fatty alcohol drops into liquid crystalline phase drops. When the mixture is cooled below the chain melt temperature, the liquid crystal phase is converted into a solid crystalline gel matrix.

The hair switches were washed for 20 repeat wash cycles in tap water containing 7 grains per gallon water hardness (Ca/Mg) and 0.06 μg/g copper ions. Each wash cycle consisted of two applications of 0.1 g/g a shampoo (from Table 5) to the hair switches. Each application consisted of adding shampoo to the hair, milking for 30 secs followed by rinsing for 30 secs. Shampoo was then reapplied 0.1 g/g, milked for 30 secs, rinsed for 30 secs and then dried in a heat box (60° C.) until dry. Samples of 100 mg of hair were digested overnight with 2 ml of high purity concentrated nitric acid. The digestive mixture also contained 150 μL of 100 μg/g Yttrium internal standard (Inorganic Ventures, Christianburg, Va., USA). Following digestion, samples were heated to 70-80° C. for one hour, cooled to room temperature and diluted to 15 mL with deionized water. Copper content of the hair switches was determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic spectroscopy (ICP-OES)). For each leg, 3 different samples were analyzed. Now referring to Table 4, it was surprisingly found that histidine delivered surprisingly better performance in a shampoo and conditioner regimen comprising histidine when used to remove copper from the hair and to inhibit copper deposition onto the hair. The performance difference was statistically different. These results are particularly surprising because histidine has a lower Formation Constant than EDDS (see Table 1).
