(E)-methyl 3-(4-((1S,3R/1R,3S)-6-ethynyl-2-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-3-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro isoquinolin-1-yl)-3,5-difluorophenyl)acrylate
(E)-methyl 3-(3,5-difluoro-4-((1S,3R/1R,3S)-2-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-3-methyl-6-((trimethylsilyl)ethynyl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-1-yl)phenyl)acrylate 49a (590 mg, 1.15 mmol) was dissolved in 5 mL of 1 M tetrabutylammonium fluoride. The reaction was stirred for 5 hours at room temperature. Water was added, and the mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate three times. The organic phases were combined, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography with elution system B to obtain a title compound (E)-methyl 3-(4-((1S,3R/1R,3S)-6-ethynyl-2-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-3-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro isoquinolin-1-yl)-3,5-difluorophenyl)acrylate 49b (60 mg, yield 11.8%) as a white solid.
