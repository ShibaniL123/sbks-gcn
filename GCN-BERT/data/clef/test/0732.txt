SCARIFYING TOOL FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates generally to tools. In particular, the present invention relates to a scarifying tool, and in particular to a tool to scarify, rake, or loosen material such as sand or soil. BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION Rakes are known to have a number of tines, with the tines optionally bent at the end to catch and gather loose material such as weeds or stones. Once raked together, the leaves or other debris can be collected for removal. On surfaces where it may be desired to maintain a flat an unobstructed clear surface (such as a sand bunker of a golf course or similar) a conventional rake presents problems. For example, in a sand bunker it is desirable to rake through the sand to flatten it and to remove debris. However, use of a prior art rake tends to result in an uneven surface with the head portion of the rake plunging into the sand leaving indentations. Where it is desired to remove weeds or other plant material from a garden bed, for example, a rake is not very effective. While useful in removing loose plant material, plants that are anchored in the soil are not easily removed with a rake. It is an aspect of the present invention to provide a tool which is an improvement on prior art tools for levelling or clearing a substrate surface. Alternatively, it is an aspect of the invention to provide a useful alternative to a prior art tools. The discussion of documents, acts, materials, devices, articles and the like is comprised in this specification solely for the purpose of providing a context for the present invention. It is not suggested or represented that any or all of these matters formed part of the prior art base or were common general knowledge in the field relevant to the present invention as it existed before the priority date of each provisional claim of this application. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In a first aspect, but not necessarily the broadest aspect, the present invention provides a tool for disrupting a substrate surface, the tool comprising: a head, attachable to a handle, and one or more shaped projections, associated with the head, each shaped projection defining a space, and comprising an edge, wherein at least one of the shaped projection(s) is/are configured to, in use, disrupt the substrate surface and allow disrupted substrate material to pass through the space(s) defined by the shaped projection(s).

However, although various embodiments of the present invention will be described herein, it is understood that these embodiments are presented by way of example only, and not limitation. As such, this description of various alternative embodiments should not be construed to limit the scope or breadth of the present invention. Furthermore, statements of advantages or other aspects apply to specific exemplary embodiments, and not necessarily to all embodiments covered by the claims. Throughout the description and the claims of this specification the word "comprise" and variations of the word, such as "comprising" and "comprises" is not intended to exclude other additives, components, integers or steps. Reference throughout this specification to "one embodiment" or "an embodiment" means that a particular feature, structure or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is comprised in at least one embodiment of the present invention. Thus, appearances of the phrases "in one embodiment" or "in an embodiment" in various places throughout this specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment, but may. In a first aspect, the present invention provides a tool for disrupting a substrate surface, the tool comprising: a head, attachable to a handle, and one or more shaped projections, associated with the head, each shaped projection defining a space, and comprising an edge, wherein at least one of the shaped projection(s) is/are configured to, in use, disrupt the substrate surface and allow disrupted substrate material to pass through the space(s) defined by the shaped projection(s). The tool can be used to scarify of otherwise disrupt the surface and upper regions of a soil substrate, a sand substrate or other material to quickly and easily break up the material on and below the surface, smooth and flatten the surface and also to remove debris or weeds. Specially configured projections may be configured so that the degree of angle of use allows for different functionality of the scarifying tool creating a useful and versatile tool. The following describes a non-limiting example of the invention being used with reference to scarifying and or raking surfaces such as a sand bunker on a golf course. The invention is not limited to scarifying or raking of sand or to use at a golf course and can be applied to any surface or material where it may be desired to rake, scarify, clear, scrape or smooth the surface. The invention may be used to scarify a surface or rake a surface, either shallowly or deeply, depending on the application and configuration of the tool. Throughout the specification, use of the term "surface" is not intended to be limited strictly to the upper surface of material but rather the upper surface and material directly below that it may be desired to prepare for use. The invention is applicable to any kind of ground or surface material. In one embodiment, the tool is able to break up or loosen the material of the surface so as to scarify, rake, smooth, till or otherwise prepare the surface for use. The use may be any suitable use, for example, as a sand bunker, cultivation, in a domestic garden or at an industrial or construction site. The tool may be used to prepare a surface for construction thereupon. Any form of breaking up of the material of the surface may be made by the tool. Any form of loosening of the material of the surface may be made by the tool. The preparation may be superficial, below the surface, or deeply below the surface as is suitable to the particular application of the tool. For example, the tool may be used in stages to clear weeds and matted roots from an area, before being used to smooth the top surface ready for use. The tool may be a handheld tool. The tool may be used with a mechanical bar or similar so as to be operated mechanically. The tool may be operated by another part of the user, not the hand such as the foot. In one embodiment, the tool is supplied constructed for the user. However, it may be that the tool is supplied in kit form for assembly before use by the user. The surface may be any suitable surface. In one embodiment, the surface comprises the upper most surface and material below the surface. In one embodiment, the surface is the ground comprising the uppermost surface and material below the surface. The surface may comprise material to a depth chosen from the group: 10; 50; 100; 500; or 1000 millimetres, as examples of the different uses to which the tool may be applied. The surface may be a sand bunker. In one embodiment, the surface is a sand bunker and the tool is adapted to scarify or rake the surface smooth in preparation for golf. The surface may be a garden bed. The surface may be a sports surface. The surface may be chosen from the group: sand; soil; gravel; grass and a combination thereof. In one embodiment, the surface is made of material. The material may be any suitable material. The material may be sand. The material may be soil. The material may be a combination of materials. The material may be land that it is desired to clear of weeds. In one embodiment, the material is chose from the group: sand; soil; gravel; weeds; ore; construction materials; and a combination thereof. The head may take any suitable form or configuration. In one embodiment, the head is longer than it is wide. In one embodiment, in one form of the invention, the head is wide so that a wide span of surface may be treated with the tool in a single pass. The head may be half, 1 or 2 metres across in a large form of the invention. In a small form of the invention the head may be only 300 millimetres in length. The length of the head can be varied to suit the particular application to be made of the tool. In one embodiment, the head comprises a support bar. In one embodiment, the support bar is made of strong material. The strong material may be steel, comprising stainless steel or high tensile aluminium. In one embodiment, the support bar is rectangular in cross-section. The support bar may be similar in dimensions and shape to a plank. The particular dimensions and shape of the support bar can be adapted to suit the particular application to be made of the tool. In one embodiment, a neck is comprised to attach the head to a handle, where a handle is used. The neck may provide structural support to the attachment point between the head and the handle. The neck may be formed of a strong material. The strong material may be steel or stainless steel for example. The neck may be of a conventional form whereby the handle is inserted into a recess configured to tightly receive the end of the handle therein. The neck may be omitted, in another form of the invention. The handle, if used, may be attached directly to the head. The head is, in one embodiment, firmly attached to the head. The head and handle may be removably, permanently or semi-permanently attached one to the other. For example, the head and handle may be welded together. In another form of the invention the head and handle may only be fitted on to the other at the time of use. Any form of suitably resilient attachment of the head to the handle may be used. In one embodiment, the handle is a long handle to provide sufficient reach to the user. In an alternative form of the invention a short handle may be used. The handle may be in the form of a pole or post. The handle may take any suitable form. The handle may be omitted. In one embodiment, there are a plurality of shaped projections. In one embodiment, there are numerous shaped projections for use to scarify the material of the surface. In one embodiment, there are at least 8 shaped projections, arranged along the length of the head. There may be 10 shaped projections. There may be 3 shaped projections. Any suitable number of shaped projections may be used. For example, where a long head is used there may be numerous shaped projections comprised along its length whereby a single pass of the head will break up or loosen material over a wide area of the surface. In one embodiment, the shaped projections are arranged along the length of the support bar. The shaped projections may be the same or different to one another. The shaped projections may be the same size as one another or different shapes. In one embodiment, the shaped projections comprise one or more curved surface. In one embodiment, a curved surface is comprised and it is the curved surface that contacts the surface to break up or loosen the underlying material. In one embodiment, the configuration of the shaped projections facilitates movement through the material of the surface. In one embodiment, the curved surface facilitates movement of the tool through the surface to break up the material. The curved surface is a surprisingly effective means of scarifying the surface. In one embodiment, the shaped projections comprises an upper curved surface and a lower curved surface. There may be any number of curved surfaces. Alternatively, the curved surfaces may be positioned at any position around the perimeter of the shaped projection. The curved surfaces are most beneficial to the working of the invention, although other shapes could be used. In one embodiment, it is the curved surfaces that can be presented to the surface to work the underlying surface. In one embodiment, there are two curved surfaces and either curved surface can be presented to work the surface. In this form of the invention the curved surfaces may be presented to the surface depending on the orientation of use of the tool. The curved surfaces may be the same, similar or different to one another. In one embodiment, the shaped projections comprise flattened sides. In one embodiment, the flattened sides act to minimise resistance when using the tool through material. Other forms of shaped projections can be used. The shaped projection may take any suitable shape. In one embodiment, the shaped projections are substantially in the shape of a loop. The loop may comprise gaps. The loop may comprise irregular shaped parts. In one embodiment, the loop has substantially flattened sides. In one embodiment, the loop is a tubular strip of steel or stainless steel. In one embodiment, the loops are a thin strip of metal bent into a suitable shape. In one embodiment, the shaped projections are attached to the head. In one embodiment, the shaped projections are attached to a support bar of the head. The shaped projections may be attached by any suitable manner to the head or support bar. In one embodiment, in one form of the invention the shaped projections are welded to the support bar. In another form of the invention the shaped projections are adjustably attached to the head or support bar. In one form of the invention the shaped projections are adjustably bolted to the support bar. Other forms of adjustable or other attachment may be used for attaching the shaped projections to the support bar. In one form of the invention, the shaped projections may be arranged on the head with spaces between one another. In this form of the invention the spaces allow more material to pass around the shaped projections. The shaped projections may be arranged with a regular spacing attached to the support bar. This form of the invention may be useful for sand. In another form of the invention, the shaped projections may be arranged close to one another with substantially no space between them. In one embodiment, in this form of the invention the shaped projections are tightly packed together. Use of tightly packed shaped projections is useful to address weeds or other material that needs strong action to break up the material. The removal of the spaces between the shaped projections may force most of the material of the surface to pass over an edge or through the defined space. In another form of the invention one or more of the shaped projections may be attached either to the front or back of the head. In one embodiment, in this form of the invention shaped projections are attached to both the front and back. In one embodiment, the shaped projections are attached to the front and back of the support bar. Most in one embodiment, the arrangement of shaped projections creates overlaps as the head of the tool moves over the surface. The overlapping may be viewed from the front or back of the tool. Alternatively, the overlapping shaped projections may be moulded integrally. The overlapping shaped projections may overlap one another being attached to either the front or back of the head or support bar, rather than both. Where the shaped projections are configured to overlap there may be a plurality of defined spaces. The plurality of defined spaces may be small to assist to break up or loosen material as it passes through. The defined spaces may be any size, shape or number as is suitable to the use to be made of the tool. In another form of the invention, the individual shaped projections may be adjustable relative to one another when attached to the head. In one embodiment, each shaped projection can be adjusted in height relative to the support bar before firm attachment. In one form of the invention the shaped projections may be adjusted up and down to suit the particular application to be made of the tool. In one embodiment, bolts are used to secure the shaped projections to the support bar. Plates, such as a metal plate may be comprised to assist to maintain the shaped projections in place. The adjustable fixing of the shaped projections to the head provides further versatility to the invention to adjust to meet the needs of the user for preparing a surface. In one embodiment, in one form of the invention there are only a few shaped projections for use with a shorter handle. For example, there may be three shaped projections arranged closely together on the head. In this form of the invention the tool is to be used by hand. In this form of the invention use of the short handle allows ready use of the tool for close work or very tough material. Domestic gardeners may use this form of the invention as a garden tiller. In one embodiment, each shaped projection defines a space through which material of the surface can pass. Most in one embodiment, each shaped projection defines at least two spaces, an upper space and lower space. In one embodiment, where an upper curved surface is comprised the upper curved surface substantially surrounds the upper space with the support bar. Similarly, where a lower curved surface is comprised the lower curved surface and support bar may define the lower space. More in one embodiment, the lower space is defined by the lower curved surface, sides and the support bar. The defined spaces may take any suitable shape or configuration. In one embodiment, the shaped projections provide two tools. In one embodiment, the two tools are an upper tool whereby the upper surface of the shaped projection is presented to the surface and a lower tool whereby the lower surface of the shaped projection is presented to the surface. In one embodiment, the configuration of the two tools is different so that two different functionalities can be achieved. The two different functionalities may be a strong cutting action and a shallower action. Or the two different functionalities may be to break up or loosen material shallowing and then more deeply. The two tools may be adapted for different useful functions for preparing or treating a surface. In one embodiment, one defined space is larger than the other. In one embodiment, the upper defined space is small enabling tough weeds and the like to be worked on presentation of the upper curved surface to the surface. In one embodiment, the lower defined space is larger so that when the lower curved surface is presented to the surface the tool passes deeper into the surface. The characteristics of the two tools created are in one embodiment distinctly different from one another in use. A plurality of defined spaces may be created by the arrangement of shaped projections. The attachment to the head of the shaped projections may create further defined spaces. Where there is an overlap of shaped projections numerous small spaces may be created, useful for breaking up or loosening material. In one embodiment, at least one edge is comprised that is suitable to cut material. For example, the edge may be used to cut weeds or roots, or to break up or loosen solid materials. In one embodiment, the edge is a cutting edge. In one embodiment, the edge substantially surrounds the shaped projection. In one embodiment, all the edges of the shaped projection are suitable edges to break up material. In one embodiment, all the edges of the shaped projection are cutting edges. In one embodiment, the shaped projection is a loop of flat metal and the edges on either side are suitable to cut through material. The edge may be inherently suited to cut or breakup material. The edge may be a sharpened cutting edge. In one embodiment, the shaped projections can be readily removed and inverted or reversed so as to present a fresh edge to the surface for use to break up material. One or more specific cutting edge may be comprised at any part of the head of the tool. In one form of the invention, the head may be attached to a mechanical bar attached to a machine to enable mechanical scarifying of the surface. In this form of the invention the handle may be omitted. A machine may be comprised to physically move the head over and through the surface. The machine may comprise controls. The controls may be manual controls. The controls may be automatic or remote controls. Software may be comprised to assist to control the use of the tool with the mechanical means. In one embodiment, in use the tool can be used in a first manner or a second manner and the first and second manner of use of the tool have different functional characteristics. In one embodiment, altering the angle of the handle in use alters how deep the shaped projections project into the surface. The angle of the handle in use may be substantially 25 degrees as is comfortable for regular use. The angle of the handle may be substantially 15 degrees to go deeper into the surface. The angle of the handle may be substantially 30 degrees to the horizontal to skim the surface. The angle of use can be readily varied to change how the tool treats the surface. Any suitable angle or range of angles of use may be used to vary how the head of the tool presents to the surface and acts thereon. The present invention provides, in a second aspect, a scarifying tool for use on a surface, the scarifying tool comprising: a head, attachable to a handle; a projection associated with the head and comprising at least two tool faces, wherein, in use, each of the tool faces can be used separately to break up or loosen the material of the surface, and each tool faces has different functionality. In one embodiment, with respect to the second aspect the projection can be used face up to present one tool face to the surface and face down to present the second tool face to the surface. In one embodiment, the projection defines a space. In one embodiment, at least two spaces are defined, one associated with each tool face. In one embodiment, the projection comprises at least one edge. In one embodiment, the projection comprises two edges. In one embodiment, the edges are configured to cut through weeds or debris. In one embodiment, the projection are adjustable left to right and or up and down. In one embodiment, the projections can be rotated or inverted to present a different edge to the surface. In one embodiment, the projections are substantially a loop. Accordingly the invention also provides a method of use of a scarifying tool, the tool comprising a head, attachable to a handle and one or more projections defining a space and having an edge. The method may comprise a) applying the shaped projections of the tool to a surface; and b) adjusting the angle of use to adjust the depth the shaped projections project into the surface. In one embodiment, the method comprises the further step of inverting the shaped projection to apply to the surface as a second tool with different functionality to the first tool. Alternatively, step b) can be omitted and replaced with inverting the shaped projection to apply to the surface as a second tool with different functionality to the first tool. In one embodiment, the scarifying tool of the first or second method is the scarifying tool of the invention in any of its aspects or various forms. The invention will now be described in connection with non-limiting preferred embodiments with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which: Referring to Figs 1 to 5 a first preferred embodiment of the invention will be described, where scarifying tool 1 , has handle 10 and head 12. Handle 10, as illustrated, is a long wooden handle of the form similar to that of a conventional broom or rake. Handle 10 can be provided as part of scarifying tool 1 , or scarifying tool 1 can be used with conventional handles as used for other tools. The length of handle 10 allows a person to use scarifying tool 1 on a surface without needing to bend unduly, and to provide a long reach. Handle 10 is made of wood as a strong, unbending material but other strong materials such as metal, or composite materials could be used instead. Head 12 has neck 14 attached to support bar 16, which as illustrated is welded one to the other. Neck 14 of head 12 could instead be made integrally with support bar 16, during manufacture. Neck 14 is configured to receive an end of handle 10 therein, at one end, and be attached to support bar 16 at the other. Neck 14 is made of steel; other strong materials could be used instead, for example strong aluminium or other metals. In an alternative arrangement neck 14 could be made integrally with handle 10 and support bar 16, or neck 14 could be omitted and handle 10 and support bar 16 could be attached directly. Neck 14 enables ready replacement of handle 10, or for handle 10 to be used with scarifying tool 1 , and also with other scarifying tools such as a broom. Support bar 16 as illustrated has neck 14 attached at the midpoint along its length. Support bar 16 is approximately 550 millimetres in length but could be longer for use over larger areas or shorter for accessing smaller areas. Support bar 16 is a steel bar, as shown but could be made of wood or other strong materials comprising plastics or composite materials. Support bar 16, is rectangular in cross-section in both directions as is a useful configuration, but other configurations would be similarly suitable. Loops 18, of the first embodiment, are arranged, spaced apart along the length of support bar 16. The spaces and loops 18 are important for the function of the first preferred embodiment of the invention. Variation to the arrangements of loops 18 and the spaces therebetween changes the strength and number of cutting edges so to modify the function of scarifying tool 1 . Loops 18 are made of steel as a strong and corrosion resistant material. Other materials such as high tensile aluminium would also be suitable and non-metals could be suitable. Each loop 18 as illustrated is a steel tubular loop, 1 14 millimetres long and 42 millimetres wide, with a wall thickness of 2 millimetres. The inventor has found the described configuration of loops 18 to be suitable, but clearly variations in each of these dimensions can be made within the scope of the invention. Four loops 18 are shown as is a favoured arrangement for one half of scarifying tool 1 . Clearly only half of support bar 16 is shown and the other half is a mirror image with a further 4 loops 18 fixed to support bar 16 in a similar fashion, making 8 loops 18 in total. The number of loops 18 can be varied to suit the particular application. As shown, each loop 18 is spaced 20 millimetres apart so that there are clear spaces between each loop 18, in the first preferred embodiment of the invention. The spaces in the invention are useful to allow material to pass between loops 18. When scarifying or raking a surface, a general loosening of the soil or sand material needs to occur with much of the material passing through and around loops 18. Referring to Fig. 2 in particular, loops 18 as shown have flat sides 20 and 22 with curved upper surface 24 and curved lower surface 26. The particular shaping of loops 18 has been carefully considered to act to cut or break up material either by use of the upper or lower surface but being smooth curves movement through the material is facilitated. Similarly, flat sides 20 and 22 do not prevent movement of loops 18 through the material in use. Loops 18 define a space through which material can pass in use, to loosen and break up the material. The particular shape of loop 18 as illustrated has been shown to be beneficial but could be varied somewhat, and scarifying tool 1 will still work in a similar fashion. It is envisaged that in another form of the invention loops 18 may comprise one or more gaps, perhaps to save materials during manufacture. In this form of the invention the outline of the loop comprising any gaps define a space through which material can pass in use. Loops 18 are most beneficial, as are the curved surfaces which do not catch in the ground, but again a square shaped piece could be used instead, with a different space and cutting edge arrangement as described further below. Loops 18 are welded to support bar 16 and may be attached to either a front or back surface of support bar 16. Loops 18 are welded so that there is more of the loop below the attachment point to support bar 16 than above. A suitable proportion may be with a fifth of loop 18 above the attachment point and the remainder below. Loops 18 are welded at flat surfaces 20 and 22 to support bar 16, as illustrated but again loops 18 could be made integrally with support bar 16, or attached differently. Loop 18 is beneficial in design to comprise a first edge 28 and a second edge 30, either of which can provide a cutting edge during use. Scarifying tool 1 can be used to push or pull through a surface so that either edge 30 or 28 can contact the surface as a cutting edge. Edges 28 and 30 can be sharpened to facilitate cutting through and removal of weeds from the surface. Alternatively, the fine edge itself of edge 28 and 30 can itself be used to cut, rip or break up material or weeds to clear a surface, and to loosen the surrounding material. In contrast to a conventional rake, soil or sand readily passes through the defined space within loop 18. As material passes through the defined space, the surface is smoothed, without getting caught on weeds, or other material, although these materials can also be used to collect these materials as well. In this way loops 18 have edges 28 and 30 that can be used as a cutting tool, specifically to remove a weed that can be seen on the surface, as well as scarifying tool 1 is passed through or over the entire surface to smooth the surface. Loops 18 are divided by support bar 16 into defined upper space 32 and lower space 34, both serving beneficial purposes when using scarifying tool 1 . Lower space 34 is greater in size as more of loop 18 projects below the surface in use so as to break up soil or sand. More of cutting edges 28 or 30 are presented to the material by loop 18 surrounding lower space 34 to again allow for a greater cutting surface for larger or deeper cutting. Therefore, lower surface 26 of loop 18 provides a strong scarifying tool surface also to assist to break up material as it passes through the surface. In this way loops 18 provide two tools, depending on whether upper surface 24 or lower surface 26 is presented to the surface. For breaking up the surface more deeply lower curved surface 26 is presented to the surface and can break up and smooth material and material pass through the larger defined space 34. For a shallower action or to work more closely on tough material scarifying tool 1 can be turned upside down so the lower curved surface 24 is now presented to the surface and repeated action used to cut and break up material. There may be more control to use of the upper curved surface 24 which can be useful for dealing with stubborn weeds or for breaking up clods of soil or moving troublesome rock which may still pass through upper space 32, which is now in the lower position. If there are materials that are too large to pass through lower space 34 these can be broken up by further use of scarifying tool 1 , either way up to break up or move the material. In use, it may be desired to weed and smooth a sand bunker of a golf course, as one useful example of a beneficial use of the invention. In this case the surface is a sand surface and head 16 can be passed several times through the surface to break up the sand with either the upper curved surface 24 or lower curved surface 26 being presented. The depth, and toughness of the material to be scraped, cleared and smoothed will determine the orientation of loops 18. Perhaps loops 18 may be used shallowly to break up tough weeds or roots first by presenting upper curved surface 24 to the surface and once the material has been scarified and broken up lower curved surfaces 26 of loops 18 can be presented that can now more readily pass through, deeper into the soil or sand. In this way it is quick and easy to vary the manner of use and strength of scarifying tool 1 , to suit the particular application. Referring in particular to Figs 3, 4 and 5 it can be seen that the angle of use, enables varying depths of bite into the sand of scarifying tool 1 . As shown in Fig. 3, when handle 10 is at 25 degrees to the horizontal, a comfortable angle of use, head 16 is flat on the surface so it passes through readily and to the depth of defined space 34 or 32 depending on the orientation of use. Fig. 4 illustrates the handle angle at 15 degrees to the horizontal, as is useful in particular to break up weeds or more solid material, as loops 18 bite deeply through the surface into the underlying material. Fig. 5 shows use with handle 10 at an angle of 30 degrees to the horizontal which is a shallow angle to keep head 16 above the surface so only the lower defined space passes through the surface. It may be particularly useful to smooth the sand of the surface after weeds and other debris have been moved. Angling handle 10, to a greater or lesser extent varies how deep loops 18 bite into the surface. For example, where there the surface of the sand has become hardened handle through the hardened surface to break it up, clear it of debris and smooth it for use. It may be that a first pass through the surface will be made at 15 degrees to break up the roots of established weeds and to loosen the sand generally. A further pass may be made say at 25 degrees to further loosen the sand followed by a final pass at 30 degrees whereby only part of loops 18 pass shallowly through the surface, to smooth the sand ready for use. Scarifying tool 1 can readily be varied in the angle of application through each pass as the user encounters more compact or loose sand so that the sand can be effectively and efficiently loosened, broken up and smoothed ready for use. Where scarifying tool 1 is being used in soil, soil can become compacted or may contain matted roots such as from palms. When the user encounters a difficult area the angle of use can be changed directly without the need to change tool, or the head of the tool, but instead the angle presents a different arrangement of the defined spaces and cutting edges to the material. No special training or tools are required to use this highly useful tool and yet with practise it can be quickly prove effective to clear and smooth the material as may be required. With the two orientations of loops 18 and the variation to the angle of head 12 scarifying tool 1 is a useful and versatile tool that can be easily and quickly used in a number of ways. Defined spaces 32 and 34 together enable material to pass through while being broken up by the edge of loop 18. The different spaces provide two different tools to be usable as may be suitable for breaking up, raking or smoothing different materials. Surprisingly effective, scarifying tool 1 provides a significant improvement over known tools, in an easy to use and readily manufacturable tool. Referring to Figs 6 and 7 a second preferred embodiment of the invention will be described, with reference numerals similar to the first, where scarifying tool 101 , has a handle (not shown) and head 1 12. Again, the handle is removable and of a conventional form. Scarifying tool 101 is similar to scarifying tool 1 , but is configured for increased strength and better weed control. Scarifying tool 101 is a stronger tool that can be worked well even through significant patches of weeds or roots, that otherwise would require strong cutting tools to be used to clear the material. Head 1 12 has a neck (not shown) welded to support bar 1 16. Only half of support bar 1 16 is illustrated but, in use, is attached at the midpoint along its length to the neck, similar to the first preferred embodiment. Support bar 1 16 is a steel bar, as shown but alternative strong materials could be used instead. Support bar 1 16, is rectangular in cross-section in both directions, as described for the first preferred embodiment, but other configurations would be similarly suitable. Loops 1 18, of the second embodiment, are similar to the first, but arranged, very close together along the length of support bar 1 16 so that each loop 1 18 almost touches. Five loops 1 18 are comprised for one half of scarifying tool 101 , with 10 loops 1 18 be used in total; the number of loops 1 18 can be varied as desired. Loops 1 18 are welded close together with little space between them, different to the first preferred embodiment. Alternatively, loops 1 18 could be manufactured integrally as a series of attached loops. Use of the tightly packed loops 1 18 gives a different functionality to scarifying tool 101 , with more cutting edges to break up material as described further below. Loops 1 18 are, apart from the arrangement, very similar to those of scarifying tool 1 and provide two tools as described above with respect to the first preferred embodiment depending on the orientation of the use. Loops 1 18 are made of steel as a strong and corrosion resistant material and again other strong materials could be used instead. Loops 1 18 as shown have flat sides 120 and 122 with curved upper surface 124 and curved lower surface 126. The particular shape of loops 1 18, as for loops 18 described above has been shown to be beneficial but can be varied. Loops 1 18 are welded to support bar 1 16 in the tightly packed arrangement as shown. In another form of the invention a combination of spaced and closely packed loops may be used, as is suitable to the particular application to be made of the tool. Loops 1 18 and may be attached to the surface of support bar 1 16 through welding or made integrally during manufacture. Loops 1 18 are welded so that there is more of the loop below the attachment point to support bar 1 16 than above so that more of the material below the surface can be raked or tilled when the lower part of loop 1 18 is presented to the surface. The particular proportion of loop 1 18 above or below the support bar 1 16 in use can be varied but it is preferred to have a greater percentage of loop 1 18 below support bar 1 16 than above giving two tools with different functional properties during use. First edge 128 and a second edge 130, of loops 1 18 are similar to those described above with respect to the first preferred embodiment. Either edge 128 or 130 can provide a cutting edge. An important advantage of the invention in any of its various forms is that reversal or upending of the loops enables each of the four cutting surfaces to be used in turn, lengthening the life of the loops and of the scarifying tool itself. Scarifying tool 101 is used in the same manner as scarifying tool 1 , to scarify, rake, or smooth a surface, to remove debris, break up weeds and to prepare the surface for a purpose. For example, the surface may be a sand bunker being prepared for golf, or may be soil being prepared or tilled for planting or other use. Loops 1 18 are divided by support bar 16 into defined upper space 132 and lower space 134, both serving beneficial purposes when using scarifying tool 101 . Lower space 134 is greater in size as more of loop 1 18 projects below the surface in use so as to break up soil or sand. Lower surface 126 of loop 1 18 provides a strong scarifying tool surface also to assist to break up material as it passes through the surface. The angle of use to the horizontal can be controlled by a person by use of the handle to vary how deep loops 1 18 cut into the surface, in the same manner as described for the first preferred embodiment. Overall, the second preferred embodiment functions as for the first embodiment with the same advantages and with the added advantages of greater strength and more cutting edges being presented to the surface. Referring to Figs 8 and 9 a third preferred embodiment of the invention will be described, with reference numerals similar to the first, where scarifying tool 201 , has a handle (not shown) and head (not labelled) as for the previously described embodiments. Again, the handle is removable and of a conventional form. The angle of use can be controlled by a person by use of the handle, so as to enable the loops to dig into the surface deeply or pass through more shallowly. Scarifying tool 201 is similar to scarifying tool 1 and 101 , but is configured for even further increased strength and strong weed control due to the two rows of loops spaced apart but overlapping in use, as described further below. The manner of use of scarifying tool 201 is the same as for the two previously described embodiments. The head has a neck (not shown) welded to support bar 216, a stainless steel bar, rectangular in cross-section. Other configurations of the head, neck and support bar 216 could be used. Support bar 216 as illustrated is 40 millimetres in width and again is strong to assist for use against significant weeds, solid material or roots for example that may need to be cut before an area can be cleared and the surface prepared and smoothed for use. Loops 218, of the third preferred embodiment, are similar to the first embodiments being rings or tubes of flat stainless steel shaped into a loop. Loops 218 are fixed to support bar 216 spaced along its length. Different in the third preferred embodiment, loops 218 are arranged on both sides of support bar 216 so as to appear overlapping when viewed from the front (refer Fig. 8); the spacing can be seen in Fig. 9. Eight loops 218 are shown as may be suitable for half of support bar 216, four on each side with a further eight loops 218 forming a mirror image on the other side of the handle on support bar 216. Loops 218 are welded together overlapping so as to provide numerous small defined spaces and more cutting edges to be presented through the surface. Use of scarifying tool 201 may be particularly useful for dense roots or weeds to cut through the roots below the surface for example before loosening and smoothing the surface material as there are more loops 218 and associated functionality than the previously described embodiments. In other ways scarifying tool 201 functions in the same manner and can have either the top or bottom surface of loops 218 presented to the surface. Scarifying tool 201 can also be readily used with a forward and back movement and cutting edges are presented both at the front and back of support bar 216. Loops 218 are similar to those described above for the previous embodiments having flat sides 220 and 222 with curved upper surface 224 and curved lower surface 226. The curved surfaces 224 and 226 are adapted to move through the surface smoothly while effectively breaking up the material. Scarifying tool 201 is particular strong and sharp due the increased number of cutting edges 228 and 230, and from both directions. There simply are more cutting edges 228 and 230 available to be used over, through and in the surface so that a person can readily break up the soil, sand or other material. First edge 228 and a second edge 230, of loops 218 are similar to those described above with respect to the first preferred embodiment. Either edge can provide a cutting edge, and reversal or upending of the loops enables each of the four cutting surfaces to be used in turn, lengthening the life of the loops and of scarifying tool 201 itself. Scarifying tool 201 is used in the same manner as scarifying tool 1 and 101 , to rake, or smooth a surface, to remove debris, break up weeds and to prepare the surface for a purpose. Again loops 218 are divided by support bar 216 into defined upper space 232 and lower space 234, and again front to back by overlapping loops 218. The smaller defined spaces assist to break up material having first been cut with the cutting edges 228 and 230 to assist to loosen and smooth the soil, particularly useful where there are mattered roots or dense soil that needs to be worked heavily. Loops 218 can be reversed or upended so as to present another cutting edge foremost, prolonging the useful like of scarifying tool 201 . Modifying the angle and which part of scarifying tool 201 is presented to the surface provides and extremely versatile tool for use to prepare the surface for use. Referring to Figs 10, 1 1 and 12 a fourth preferred embodiment of the invention will be described, with reference numerals similar to the previously described. Scarifying tool 301 is similar to the previously described however is adapted for used with a mechanical tool bar to enable mechanical, automated scarifying, raking or tilling of the surface. Scarifying tool 310 could optionally be used with a manual handle instead, if desired. Support bar 316 is a stainless steel bar, as shown but alternative strong materials could be used instead. Support bar 316, is sturdy metal bar, rectangular in cross-section; alternative configurations could be used instead Stainless steel loops 318, of the fourth embodiment, are similar to the others but arranged in a stepped arrangement gradually sloping up towards support bar 316. Three loops 318 are illustrated installed on support bar 316, as would be six in all. Alternatively, loops 318 could be arranged in a straight line as for the previously described embodiments. Bolts 319 of a known form are used and allow loops 316 to be adjusted up and down to a suitable height for use before the nut is tightened to hold loop 316 in place. The particular height of loops 318 may be adjusted to protect the edges of an area or to avoid obstacles, for example. Variation to the particular arrangement of loops 318 could be made to suit a particular application of the invention. As with the previously described embodiments loops 318 can be inverted or reversed to present a fresh cutting edge, prolonging the life of scarifying tool 301 . Again loops 318 as shown have flat sides 320 and 322 with curved upper surface 324 and curved lower surface 326, and edges 328 and 330. Spaces 332 and 334 similar to the above-described embodiments divide above and below support bar 316 and material will pass therethrough. The curved surfaces assist to move loops 318 through the material of the surface smoothly. Attachment of scarifying tool 301 to a mechanical tool bar enables on operation an area to be prepared mechanically. In this form of the invention software may be comprised to electronically control the angle, depth and part of loop 318 presented to the surface. An advantage to use of a mechanical tool bar is that a wide support bar 316 could be used to scarify or rake a wide area with each pass, perhaps wider than could be achieved by hand. For industrial or large installations where it is useful to use the invention then it would be invaluable to be able make a pass over a wide area to reduce the total number of passes required to prepare an area. As the loops can be easily taken off and inverted or reversed a new, fresh cutting edge can be presented to the material. The edge may be simply a thin edge that naturally cuts through the material or may be sharpened. In either case over time and use it is likely that the cutting edge of the loops will become dulled or less sharp and effective. The user can then loosen the bolts holding the loop in place and rearrange the loop to present a fresh edge. Referring to Fig. 13 a fifth preferred embodiment of the invention will be described, with reference numerals similar to the previously described. Scarifying tool 401 is similar to the previously described however comprises a short handle 410 to enable close work by hand to loosen soil, sand or other material. Short handle 410 can also be replaced with a long handle to enable use as previously described for the manual forms of the invention. Support bar 416 is a steel bar, as shown but alternative strong materials could be used instead. Support bar 416, is sturdy metal bar, rectangular in cross-section; alternative configurations could be used instead. Support bar 416 is much shorter than the previously described and has only three steel loops 418 welded to the front. Loops 418 are welded next to one another as described for the second embodiment having the same flat and curved surfaces and edges defining an upper and lower space (none of which are labelled-refer to the second embodiment). Scarifying tool 401 is used in the same manner as previously described, in either orientation to work on tough material or to dig more deeply into the material. It is envisaged the versatility of the tool will appeal to domestic gardeners, in particular, and can be used as a garden tiller. For each of the five embodiments it is clear that a tool with clear utility is disclosed that can be used in a variety of different ways to break up and loosen material. With no specialised training the scarifying tool can scarify, rake clear or smooth a surface. The nature of the use of the tool can be changed by changing which part of the loops are presented to work hard at tough roots or to bite in deeper, and by varying the angle of the handle or motorised bar the depth that that loops either skim the surface or dig into the surface can again be changed to suit the needs of the user. Adjustment to the height, angle and arrangement of the loops further provides versatility to the tool. Ready replacement of the loops or reversing or inverting to present a fresh cutting edge will prolong the useful life of the tool. Overall the inventor has developed a useful tool that is simple to use yet effective and provides a range of functionality in a single tool.
