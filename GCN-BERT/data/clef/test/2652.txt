Synthesis of compound 41-b
Under N2 atmosphere, Zn powder (65mg, 1mmol) was added to a solution of compound 41-c (257mg, 1mmol) and ethyl bromoacetate (217mg, 1.3mmol) in anhydrous THF (10mL). The mixture was heated to 50°C and further stirred for 16hrs, cooled to room temperature, followed by adding saturated NH4Cl aq. solution (5mL) and water (20mL) in turn. The mixture was extracted with EA (30mL×3). The organic phases were combined, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by silica column chromatography (PE:EA=4:1) to give compound 41-b (281mg, yield 82%).
