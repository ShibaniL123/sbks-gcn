32.2 5-Bromo-2-iodo-4-trifluoromethyl-pyridine
32.1 5-Bromo-4-trifluoromethyl-pyridin-2-ylamine
Analogously to example 19.1, obtained by starting from 4-trifluoromethyl-pyridin-2-ylamine (purchased from Manchester) and 1-bromo-pyrrolidine-2,5-dione. The mixture is poured into water, extracted with ethyl acetate and washed with a half saturated aqueous solution of sodium bicarbonate. The organic phase is dried and concentrated under reduced pressure.
