DETAILED DESCRIPTION [0043] The following description is provided to enable those skilled in the art to make and use the described aspects contemplated for carrying out the invention. Various modifications, equivalents, variations, and alternatives, however, will remain readily apparent to those skilled in the art. Any and all such modifications, variations, equivalents, and alternatives are intended to fall within the spirit and scope of the present invention. [0044] For purposes of the description hereinafter, the terms "upper", "lower", "right", "left", "vertical", "horizontal", "top", "bottom", "lateral", "longitudinal", and derivatives thereof shall relate to the invention as it is oriented in the drawing figures. However, it is to be understood that the invention may assume various alternative variations, except where expressly specified to the contrary. It is also to be understood that the specific devices illustrated in the attached drawings, and described in the following specification, are simply exemplary aspects of the invention. Hence, specific dimensions and other physical characteristics related to the aspects disclosed herein are not to be considered as limiting. [0045] Referring to Figs. 1A-5F, a vial stabilizer and vial adapter assembly 10 according to one aspect of the present invention includes a vial stabilizer base 12 and a vial adapter 14 as described in more detail below. [0046] Referring to Figs. 1A-2E, the vial adapter 14 includes a ring member 16, locking arms 18, locking tabs 20, retaining tabs 22, and a passageway 24 defined by the ring member 16. The ring member 16 is annular, although other suitable shapes for the ring member 16 may be utilized. The locking arms 18 and locking tabs 20 of vial adapter 14 are configured to securely connect to a cap 42 of medical vial 40. The medical vial 40 may contain a medicament in fluid form or powdered form that needs to be reconstituted. As shown in Fig. 2A, the locking arms 18 extend from the ring member 16 with the locking tabs 20 extending about perpendicularly from the locking arms 18. Although three locking arms 18 are provided, any other suitable number of arms may be utilized. The locking tabs 20 define an angled surface 21 that is configured to engage the cap 42 of the vial 40 and deflect the locking arms 18 radially outward to allow the vial adapter 14 to receive the vial 40 as discussed in more detail below. The retaining tabs 22 extend radially inward from the ring member 16 and are configured to abut the cap 42 of the vial 40 as discussed in more detail below. [0047] Referring to Figs. 1 A-1D and 3A-3E, the vial stabilizer base 12 includes a foundation member 26 and gripping fingers 28 projecting from foundation member 26, which define a socket 30 with a vial seat 32 and a vial adapter seat 34. The foundation member 26 is disc-like in shape, although other suitable shapes and arrangements may be utilized for the foundation member 26. The gripping fingers 28 extend about perpendicularly from the foundation member 26. Although eight gripping fingers 28 are provided, any other suitable number of gripping fingers 28 may be provided. The gripping fingers 28 further include a vial gripping ridge 36 and a vial adapter gripping ridge 38 disposed within socket 30 and adapted to grip a vial 40 and vial adapter 14, respectively. The vial gripping ridge 36 and the vial adapter gripping ridge 38 are formed as arcuate projections extending from each of the gripping fingers 28, although other suitable arrangements for the vial gripping ridge 36 and the vial adapter gripping ridge 38 may be utilized. As discussed in more detail below, the vial seat 32 is configured to receive the vial 40 and the vial adapter seat 34 is configured to receive the vial adapter 14. [0048] Referring to Figs. 1A-1D, the vial stabilizer and vial adapter assembly 10 is configured to be provided to a user with the vial adapter 14 at least partially positioned within the socket 30 of the vial stabilizer base 12 with the vial adapter 14 abutting the vial adapter seat 34. The vial adapter 14 is releasably secured to the vial stabilizer base 12 via the vial adapter gripping ridge 38 of the vial stabilizer base 12. The vial adapter gripping ridge 38 engages the ring member 16 to provide a frictional and/or compressive force that releasably holds the vial adapter 14 within the vial stabilizer base 12. [0049] Referring to Figs. 4A-11, the vial adapter 14 can be used with the vial stabilizer base 12 to aid in securing the vial adapter 14 to the vial 40 and/or to stabilize and prevent tipping of the vial 40 during transfer of the contents of the vial 40. With the vial adapter 14 releasably secured to the vial stabilizer base 12 at the vial adapter seat 34, as shown in Fig. 6, the vial 40 is positioned with the cap 42 facing downward and axially aligned with the cap 42. Next, as shown in Fig. 7, the cap 42 is pushed into the locking tabs 20 with the cap 42 engaging the angled surface 21, with locking arms 18 flexing outward as the cap 42 cams over locking tabs 20, until the cap 42 passes a locking surface 44 of locking tabs 20 and contacts a retaining surface 46 defined by the retaining tabs 22. The locking arms 18 spring inward and return to their original position and secure the vial adapter 14 to the vial 40. Once secured to the vial 40, the vial adapter 14 cannot be readily removed from the vial 40 without breaking or damaging the vial 40 or vial adapter 14, although other arrangements may be utilized where the vial adapter 14 may be releasably secured to the vial 40. As shown in Fig. 8, the vial 40 with the vial adapter 14 attached is then pulled up and out of vial stabilizer base 12. The vial 40 with vial adapter 14 attached is then rotated so that the cap 42 faces upward as shown in Fig. 9. As shown in Figs. 10 and 11, the vial 40 is then pushed down into the socket 30 of the vial stabilizer base 12 so that a vial wall 48 of the vial 40 contacts the vial seat 32 and the vial gripping ridge 36. In particular, the vial gripping ridge 36 engages the vial wall 48 to provide a frictional and/or compressive force that releasably holds the vial 40 within the vial stabilizer base 12. [0050] Referring to Figs. 4A-5F, the vial 40 is stabilized via the vial stabilizer base 12 with the vial adapter 14 attached to the vial 40, and the vial 40 is ready for attachment to a closed system transfer device 50. The vial adapter 14 is configured to allow the closed system transfer device 50 to be secured to vials of various sizes. In particular, the closed system transfer device 50 typically is only configured to be secured to a single vial size and would be too large to accept the size of the vial 40. The vial adapter 14, however, allows the closed system transfer device 50 to be secured to a smaller sized vial, such as the vial 40. For example, the vial adapter 14 may be configured to enable attachment of a 13mm vial to a closed system transfer device configured to receive a 20mm vial, although various size vial adapters are envisioned to accommodate a variety of vial sizes and a variety of closed system transfer device sizes. [0051] Referring more particularly to Figs. 5A-5F, the closed system transfer device 50 includes a pressure equalization system 52, a piercing spike 54, a fluid passageway 56, a syringe septum 58, and snap fit arms 60. However, other suitable devices could be used with the vial stabilizer and vial adapter assembly 10. The closed system transfer device 50 is attached to the vial 40 with the vial adapter 14 by pushing the snap fit arms 60 over the vial adapter 14 until snap fit tabs 62 of the snap fit arms 60 securely engage a locking ridge 64 disposed about the ring member 16 of the vial adapter 14. During the attachment of the closed system transfer device 50 to the vial 40, the piercing spike 54 passes through passageway 24 of vial adapter 14 and pierces a vial septum 66 disposed in the vial cap 42 enabling fluid communication between the interior of the vial 40 and the fluid passageway 56, which allows fluid to be transferred via syringe (not shown) or syringe adapter (not shown) at a septum 58 of the closed system transfer device 50.
