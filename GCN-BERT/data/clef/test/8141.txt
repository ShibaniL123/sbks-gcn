CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION The present application claims priority from United Kingdom Patent Application No. GB1408586.4 filed on May 5, 2014, contents of which are incorporated herein in its entirety. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention is concerned with a hair fastening means, and a method of making same. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION There is a variety of hair fastening means including hair clips, barrettes, and headbands for hair management. While all these devices are effective in different ways in hair management, many users still prefer to use traditional stationery-type rubber bands to manage and tie their hair. This is because these rubber bands are compact in size and are not prominent in appearance and can tidy hair simply, tightly and reliably, and yet their cost is low. One disadvantage of using such rubber bands for hair management is however that once a lock of hair is tied up, removing the rubber bands can often be very difficult because they tend to tangle with the hair. Often when removing the rubber bands from the hair, considerable force would be required, thus causing hair be pulled with excessive force and damage or even breakage of hair. In view of the disadvantages of traditional stationery-type rubber bands for hair management, improved rubber bands for hair fastening have been proposed. The improved rubber bands are different in that they are made of a relatively thin sheet material forming the band. Further, the material that makes up the bands and the hair have a lower frictional relationship. As such, they can be removed from tied hair relatively easily. From the perspective of reducing hair damage, these improved bands are advantageous. However, the drawback is that they are less effective in holding and tying hair in place. The present invention seeks to provide an improved hair fastening band, or least to provide an alternative to the public. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION According to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a hair fastener comprising an elongate body made of an elastic material stretchable under tension and a locking means including a first member and a second member arranged at opposite ends of the body, the first and second members made of a material stiffer than the elastic material, wherein the first member and said second member are releasably engageable with each other by way of a mechanical interference fit in that engagement of the first and second members is achieved independent of degree of tension of the elastic body, and disengagement of the first and second members is achieved by way of one hand operation of a user. The fastener may be adapted to assume a first configuration in which the first member and second members are engaged before tying the hair, or a second configuration in which the first and second members are disengaged whereby removal of the fastener from the hair in the second configuration minimizes movement of said fastener along the length of the hair and thus eliminating or at least reducing frictional contact with the hair. The first member and the second member may be connected to the respective opposite ends of the elongate body by overmoulding the elastic material over the first member and the second member thus integrally forming the opposite ends. With this construction, majority part of the hair fastener can be made of a high friction material to provide improved gripping or holding security of hair and yet hair is not damaged during removal of the fastener from user's hair. In a first embodiment, the first member may generally be in the form of a disc body with a through-opening in substantially a center thereof, and the second member may be provided with a base body and a post extending from the base body, and the post may have an enlarged flange at a distal end thereof such that the flange and the post of the second member together forming a hook means, and wherein the fastener may be adapted to assume the first configuration in which the first and second members are secured with each other with the hook means locking against the first member at the opening thereof. Preferably, length of the post and thickness of the first member may be comparable such that the enlarged flange of the post can pass through the opening for locking against inner rim of the opening of the first member. The length of the post may be slightly longer than the thickness of the first member such that locking of the second member against the first member at the post produces a mechanical interference fit. The first member may generally be in the form of a ring. The first and second members may share comparable circumferential profile such that in the first configuration when the first member and the second member are locked against each other the first member and the second member circumferentially align with each other. The surrounding structure of the first member defining the opening may be provided with a recess, the recess is adapted to receive the post when the first member engages with the second member in the first configuration. In the first configuration, the post received in the recess may be adapted to be moved away from the recess by fingers of one hand of a user such that the flange be dislodged from the surrounding structure and the post be retreated away from the opening, whereby the first and second member may be disengagable from each other thus assuming the second configuration. The first member and said second member may be configured to resemble a buttonhole-button structure. In a second embodiment, the first member may include surrounding structure defining at least an opening and the second member may include a base portion from which a post with an enlarged flange extends. The surrounding structure of the first member may be slightly flexible such that when outwardly flexed, size of the opening may be enlarged or at least shape of the opening is changed. When the first and second members are engaged with each other, at least part of the surrounding structure may surround the post for interference therewith. The opening of the first member may resemble two adjoining circles. One of the circles may resemble close to a full circle. The close-to-a-full-circle of the part the opening may be arranged at a proximal end of the fastener. When the first and second members are engaged with each other, part of the surrounding structure defining one of the two adjoining circles of the opening and the post may form the mechanical interference fit. The hair fastener may be adapted to release the post from the first member with fingers of one hand of a user by moving opposite portions of the surrounding structure apart. In an embodiment, the elastic material may be selected from the group consisting of TPE, TPU, PU, silicone, and natural rubber. The stiff material may be selected from the group consisting of ABS, PP, PE, nylon, PC, AS, POM, GPPS, HIPS and Acrylic. According to a second aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of tying hair by using a hair fastener as described above, comprising a step of connecting the first and second members by the locking means, and placing the hair fastener around hair to be tied.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention is concerned with a hair fastener. FIGS. 1-8 illustrate a first embodiment of a hair fastener, generally designated 2, according to the present invention. FIG. 1 shows that the hair fastener 2 is in an open configuration in which opposite ends 4, 6 of the fastener 2 are not connected together. The fastener 2 generally has an elongate body 8. The elongate body 8 is made of an elastic material. The fastener 2 is provided with a locking means made of a stiff material. The locking means includes a first member 10 arranged at one end of the body 8 and a second member 12 arranged at the opposite end of the body 8. The first member 10 generally takes the form of a disc body with a through-opening 14 in substantially the center thereof, and the second member 12 is provided with a base body 16 and a post 18 extending from the base 16. The post 18 has an enlarged flange 20 at a distal end thereof such that the flange 20 and the post 18 of the second member 20 forming a hook means. In the open configuration, the opposite ends 10, 12 of the fastener 2 are not connected with each other. In this configuration, the elongate body 8 is not under tension. FIGS. 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 are top plan view, end view, opposite end view, side view and opposite side view, respectively, showing the fastener 2. FIG. 7 is a perspective view of the fastener 2. As shown in this figure, the fastener 2 is disposed in a slightly different configuration in which the elongate body is somewhat flexed. This is due to the elastic nature of the material making the elongate. The preferred material of the elongate body is selected from a group including TPE, TPU, PU, silicone, and natural rubber. FIG. 8 is a different perspective view of the fastener 2. As shown in this figure, the fastener 2 is disposed in a different configuration in which the opposite ends, or the first and second members 10, 12 of the locking means, are connected together. In this configuration, the fastener 2 adopts a looped or closed profile. It is envisaged that the fastener 2 in this looped configuration can be used to tie around a lock of hair. It is however to be noted that in the absence hair tied around by the fastener 2 in this looped configuration, the first and second members 10, 12 do not lock against each other as tightly as they otherwise would. However, still they are locked against each other due to a sufficient mechanical interference fit. FIGS. 9-11 further illustrate the construction of the locking means and its working. In this embodiment, the stiff material of the locking means is selected from a group including ABS, PP, PE, Nylon, PC, AS, POM, GPPS, HIPS and acrylic. It is the use of a combination of these specific materials for the elongate body and the locking means which contributes to the effectiveness of the hair fastener. FIG. 9 shows that the disc-like first member 10 of the locking means is generally in the form of a ring with a relatively thin and circumferential body having the through-opening 14 which is nearly circular in shape. However, surrounding structure of the body defining the nearly circular shaped opening 14 has a cut-out region 22 at its distal end of the first member body 10, the cut-out region 22 forming a recess. Please also see FIG. 10. FIG. 9 also shows that the second member 12 is in the form of a disc forming the base 16. In this embodiment, the thickness of the second member 12 and the thickness of the first member 10 are substantially the same. The post 18 extended from the base 16 of the second member 12 is provided with the flange 20 which extends away from the distal end of the second member 12 and towards the elongate body 8. Thus, the post 18 has a narrower middle region, ended with an enlarged region of the flange 20. Although the post 18 is ended with an enlarged flange 20, the width of the enlarged region is still smaller than the diameter of opening 14 such that it can pass through the opening 14. FIG. 10 illustrates that the first member 10 and the second member 12 are being secured with each other. This is achieved by firstly positioning and inserting the post 18 of the second member 12 through the opening 14 of the first member 10. The post 18 of the second member 12 is just long enough such that as explained above the flange 20 can pass through the opening 14. Since the length of the post 18 and the thickness of the first member 10 are comparable, the enlarged flange 20 of the post 18 can at least just pass through the opening 14 for locking against inner rim 24 of the opening 14 of the first member 10. Specifically, the length of the post 18 is just long enough such that locking of the second member 12 against the first member 10 at the post 18 produces a vertical interference fit. FIG. 11 illustrates that in use, when hair is tied around by the fastener 2 in the looped configuration, a tension, as indicated by the arrows, is created and as such the post 18 with the enlarged flange 20 forming the hook means further engages against the recessed region of the first member 10, thus forming a tight lock. Hair is thus securely tied thereby. Due to the presence of the flange 20 which forms a hook with the post 18, the second member 12 would not disengage from the first member 10 by itself. It is envisaged that when the first member 10 and the second member 12 are engaged with each other, lower surface of the flange 20 of the second member 12 abuts with outwardly facing surface of the first member 10. FIGS. 12-14 are schematic diagrams similar to FIGS. 9-11 although FIGS. 12-14 show the full view of the fastener 2. As shown in FIGS. 12-14, the first and second members 10, 12 share comparable circumferential profile such that in the looped or closed configuration when the first member 10 and the second member 12 are stacked on top of each other they circumferentially align with each other with their circumferential surrounding fully flushed, thus minimizing any undesirable tangling with hair of user in use. It is also to be noted that the recessed region 24 of the surrounding structure of the first member 10 is adapted to tightly receive the post. This also facilitates engagement of the post 18 with the first member 12. FIG. 15 shows the fastener 2 in a different configuration in which the fastener 2 is closed and double coiled. When used for tying narrower lock of hair, the fastener 2 may be in this double-coiled configuration. FIGS. 18a-b illustrate the fastener 2 when worn by a user in this double-coiled configuration. FIGS. 19a-b are similar to FIGS. 18a-b although the fastener 2 is closed and triple coiled, and worn by a user. When removing the fastener 2 from tied hair, a user merely needs to push the protruded flange 20 laterally away from the recessed region 24 of the first member 10 of the locking means, such that the flange 20 exits via the opening of the first member 10. Once this small movement is achieved, the fastener loses its tension and the opposite ends 4, 6 of the fastener 2 disengage from each other, and can be removed easily. It is to be noted that during disengagement, there is no pulling of the fastener 2 along the length of hair of the user, and as such there is no issue of damage or breakage of hair. FIGS. 20 a-20b illustrate a second embodiment of a hair fastener 52 according to the present invention. FIG. 20a illustrates the hair fastener 52 in an open configuration while the FIGS. 20b illustrate the hair fastener 52 in a closed configuration. While the second embodiment is similar to the first embodiment 2, there are a number of differences. The fastener 52 likewise has a first member 54 and a second member 56. The first member 54 is provided with a thorough opening 64 defined by surrounding structure 63 of the first member 54. The opening 64 is in the form of two adjoining circles 64a, 64b. The second member 56 has a base portion 66 from which a post 68 with an enlarged flange 70 extends. The surrounding structure 63 of first member 54 is somewhat flexible such that it can outwardly flex, thus slightly enlarging the size of the opening 64 or at least change the shape of the opening 64. Once the opening 64 is enlarged it can allow the post 68 to enter for the surrounding structure 63 (or at least a part thereof) to fit around the post 68 for locking purpose. The surrounding structure 63 is configured such that only the part of the surrounding structure 63 defining the part of the opening of one of the two adjoining circles engages with the post when the first and second members are locked against each other. In an alternative embodiment, the post 68 and/or the flange 70 are configured to be engageable with the first member 54 regardless if whether the surrounding structure 63 is flexible. For example, the post 68 and/or the flange 70 are slightly resilient for the flange 70 to pass the opening 64a for locking purpose. The fasteners 2, 52 can be made in a number of ways. One preferred mode of manufacturing is to first provide the first member and the second member made of the rigid material. Then the elongate body of the fastener is formed by molding using one of the elastic materials over the first and second members. Before molding, the first and second members are however to be positioned such that the opening of the first member faces a direction and the post with the enlarged flange extends to the same direction. Once molded, the fastener forms an integral structure with dual material. Advantageously, the ends of the elongate members are formed without using any glue or clamping means.

Conversely, various features of the invention which are, for brevity, described in the content of a single embodiment, may be provided separately or in any appropriate sub-combinations.
