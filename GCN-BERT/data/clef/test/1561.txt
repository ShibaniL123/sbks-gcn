FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to containers, such as bottles, and to attachments for containers. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Beverages are often packaged for sale in bottles. Glass bottles are often used, especially for alcoholic beverages. Glass bottles have a number of advantages over plastic bottles, including the fact that they are less permeable to gases, usually carbon dioxide in carbonated beverages, thus providing a better storage medium for beverages. Ergonomically they may be preferable to consumers of beverages, especially consumers of beer and the like in social settings such as public houses, bars, night clubs, etc. They provide a pleasing oral tactile feeling to the consumer, much more than a plastic bottle does. The main drawback of glass bottles in such social settings is the possibility of their use as a weapon. A glass bottle can make a formidable weapon, both as a club-like implement and if smashed can lead to a hazardous shard forming that can be used to cut or maim. The possibility may be increased with consumers of alcoholic beverages who may do so to excess, leading to possible violent confrontations. Even if not used as weaponry, the mere accidental dropping of a bottle can lead to hazardous broken glass being strewn over a floor, potentially causing injury to persons in the vicinity. Use of plastic bottles overcomes these disadvantages, but does not provide the same tactile pleasure for the drinker. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION According to a first aspect of the present invention there is provided a container comprising a body of a material other than glass, and a glass rim. In at least one embodiment of the invention providing a container with a glass rim improves the experience of the customer when drinking from the container and provides a container which is less threatening and dangerous than a glass bottle. The body may comprise a storage part including a reservoir for a liquid, and a neck part. The body neck part may include the rim, the rim defining an aperture through which the liquid is accessed The body neck part aperture may be surrounded by the rim. The neck part may include a material other than glass portion and a glass portion, the glass portion defining the rim. The glass portion may be attached to the material other than glass portion. In alternative embodiments, the body may comprise a storage vessel, the vessel being attached to a glass neck part, the glass neck part defining the rim. The body may be made from a nonrigid material. In preferred embodiments, the body is a plastic bottle. The body may be made from a flexible material. The body may define a gripping section. The gripping section may be provided to permit the container to be gripped in a preferred location. The gripping section may be substantially insulated from the body storage part. Such an arrangement permits the fluid contained in the body storage part to be insulated from the heat of the user's hand improving the drinking experience of a cold liquid. The body may define stiffening means to give the body a tactile rigidity. Such an arrangement permits the user to experience a stiffer, more glass like experience when holding the container. The stiffening means may be localised on the body. The stiffening means may be positioned on a container gripping section. The stiffening means may define the container gripping section. By restricting the stiffening means to the gripping section, the container remains substantially flexible, giving the impression of being more rigid than it actually is. The stiffening means may be insulated. The stiffening means may be frangible. Frangible stiffening means may be adapted to break if the container is used as a weapon The stiffening means may be defined by an internal body surface. The stiffening means may extend into the storage part reservoir. The stiffening means may be temperature controllable. Particularly the stiffening means may be adapted to be chilled. In some embodiments the container further comprises an interface between a material other than glass section and a glass section. The material other than glass section may be releasably attached to the glass section. The material other than glass section may be fixedly attached to the glass section. The material other than glass section and the glass section may be attached by means of cooperating formations such as interfitting screw threads, by means of an interference fit, or by means of an adhesive, for example. The container may comprise data collection means. Data collection means may be provided to gather information concerning the, for example, geographical location of the container. The container may comprise display means. The display means may be adapted to display advertising or information about the container contents such as temperature or time since opening. Alternatively or additionally, the display means may be adapted to display information concerning the owner of the drink. The display means may be passive.

According to a second aspect of the present invention there is provided a glass neck for attachment to a container of a material other than glass, the glass neck comprising a wall defining a passageway having a first end and a second end, container-attachment means being provided at the first end and the second end defining a glass rim. The glass neck may be of a generally cylindrical or frusto-conical form. The container-attachment means may comprise an internal screw thread for cooperation with a corresponding screw thread formed externally on the neck of a bottle or may comprise a groove or detent for cooperation with a corresponding formation on the neck of a bottle. In certain forms of the glass neck, the second end is formed to comprise a closure-attachment means which may comprise, for example, an external screw thread for engaging an internally screw-threaded cap, or an external lip or flange for receiving a crown cork. The glass neck may include closure means. Closure means may be provided to allow contents of a container to which the glass neck is attached to pass through the glass neck but inhibit the introduction of external liquids and solids into the container through the glass neck. Such an arrangement prevents tampering with the contents of the container to which the glass neck is attached. The closure means may be automatic. The closure means may be manual. The glass neck may comprise a first portion and a second portion. The closure means may be actuable by attaching the first portion to the second portion. Alternatively, the closure means may be actuable by removing the first portion from the second portion. According to a third aspect the present invention there is provided a sleeve for attaching to a container of material other than glass, the sleeve comprising a body portion and the neck portion, the body portion being adapted to receive the container, the container being attached to the sleeve such that fluid communication exists between container and the neck portion, wherein the neck portion defines a glass rim. In some embodiments, providing a sleeve which can receive a container containing a liquid allows for the container to be made from a variety of potentially non-rigid materials. The sleeve may be adapted to receive, for example, a flexible container. The flexible container may be a waxed cardboard or flexible bag container.
