METHOD FOR TREATING A SWALLOWING DISORDER FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to a method for treating a swallowing disorder in a patient suffering from aspiration and to a bolus for use in the treatment of a swallowing disorder in such a patient. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Dysphagia is the medical term for the symptom of difficulty in swallowing. Current evidence suggests that 22% of adults over the age of 50 years, and most adults by age 80 years, experience swallowing difficulty. Oral nutrition is the desirable goal for every dysphagic patient, but in some cases may not be possible or appropriate. If adequate nutrition cannot be achieved, or if aspiration of material into the lungs cannot be prevented, non-oral feeding may need to be implemented. This alternative, however, is both costly and unsatisfying to many individuals. Therefore, strategies designed to improve swallowing safety and effectiveness in at-risk patients are commonly sought by clinicians working with dysphagic individuals. One well-known and frequently implemented technique involves the manipulation of bolus consistency. This is particularly considered when patients demonstrate difficulty with thin liquid bolus materials, e.g. water. Nutritional feeds are thickened to a safe and effective consistency based on results of clinical and instrumental assessments. In 2002, the American Dietetic Association established guidelines for thickened dietary supplements. Proposed in the Dysphagia Diet were viscosity ranges for thin (1-50 cP), nectar (51-350 cP)-like and honey-like (351-1750 cP) liquids. Many of the currently available thickening products are based on starch, which does not dissolve well in some liquid products, tastes "starchy" and can form lumps over time. If patients find these products aversive, they are unlikely to consume them, thus precluding their potential value in optimizing swallow safety. In addition, if the stability of the consistency is in question, clinicians have difficulty recommending the product. Recently, gel thickeners have become available that are not associated with a bad taste, don't change the color of the liquid they're added to, and don't form lumps. In addition, they are purported to reach target viscosity rapidly, making them better suited to heated products, such as coffee or tea. The better texture and taste are due to the use of xanthan gum rather than starch. One such product is Resource® ThickenUp Clear. The gum-thickening agent was developed to improve solubility, viscosity and taste, as compared to currently available products. However, although potential benefits of commercial gum-based products in altering bolus rheology are recognized, there have been few systematic efforts to alter bolus rheology in consideration of the type of aspiration relative to the swallowing reflex. The inventors have found that treating dysphagic patients with standard boluses having increased viscosity such as nectar-like liquids may not only be ineffective with regard to improving swallowing function. For some patient groups, such standard bolus therapy is even likely to cause adverse effects and to increase aspiration prevalence. For example, thickened liquid boluses having a high shear viscosity were found to be beneficial in patients aspirating before and during swallowing. However, the same bolus was found to be detrimental for patients who tend to aspirate after the swallowing reflex. Considering the prevalence of dysphagia, possible complications related thereto, and the costs associated with same, there is still a need for providing an improved method for treating swallowing disorders, which method can minimize the risk of standard bolus therapy and promotes safer swallowing of food boluses in patients suffering from aspiration. Such a method would improve the lives of a large and growing number of persons with swallowing impairments. Specific interventions (e.g., to promote oral health, help restore normal swallow, or reinforce a swallow-safe bolus) can enable persons to eat orally (vs. being tube fed and/or requiring PEG placement) and experience the psycho-social aspects of food associated with general well being while guarding against the potentially negative consequences that result from lack of adequate swallowing ability. Improvements in the intake of nutrition by dysphagic patients may also enable such patients to swallow a wider variety of food and beverage products safely and comfortably, which may lead to an overall healthier condition of the patient and prevent further health-related decline. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION These needs are met by the present invention, which provides a novel and easy to implement method for treating a swallowing disorder in a patient suffering from aspiration, as well as a specific novel bolus for use in the treatment of a swallowing disorder in such patients.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides a method for treating a swallowing disorder in a patient suffering from aspiration, comprising the steps of: (1) Classifying the patient into a patient group selected from: (a) Aspiration before the swallowing reflex, (b) Aspiration during the swallowing reflex, (c) Aspiration after the swallowing reflex, (d) Aspiration before and during the swallowing reflex, (℮) Aspiration before and after the swallowing reflex, or (f) Aspiration during and after the swallowing reflex; (2) Selecting a bolus having a cohesiveness specifically suited for the selected patient group according to step (1); (3) Administering the bolus to the patient. Accordingly, the present invention further provides a bolus for use in the treatment of a swallowing disorder in a patient suffering from aspiration, wherein the patient suffers from one of the following: (a) Aspiration before the swallowing reflex, (b) Aspiration during the swallowing reflex, (c) Aspiration after the swallowing reflex, (d) Aspiration before and during the swallowing reflex, (℮) Aspiration before and after the swallowing reflex, or (f) Aspiration during and after the swallowing reflex. As used herein, term "bolus" refers to a physical portion of a food or beverage that can be swallowed by a human subject. Said bolus may be in solid, semi-solid or liquid form and may comprise one or more nutrients, foods or nutritional supplements. Preferably, the bolus is a liquid. It is further preferred that the bolus has a volume the patient can consume in one swallowing event. The preferred volume of the liquid bolus is from 1 to 50 ml, preferably from 5-20 ml, more preferably from 8-12 ml. In the context of the present invention, the terms "treating", "treatment" and "to treat" include both prophylactic or preventive treatment (that prevent and/or slow the development of a targeted pathologic condition or disorder) and curative, therapeutic or disease-modifying treatment, including therapeutic measures that cure, slow down, lessen symptoms of, and/or halt progression of a diagnosed pathologic condition or disorder; and treatment of patients at risk of contracting a disease or suspected to have contracted a disease, as well as patients who are ill or have been diagnosed as suffering from a disease or medical condition. The term does not necessarily imply that a subject is treated until total recovery. The terms "treatment" and "treat" also refer to the maintenance and/or promotion of health in an individual not suffering from a disease but who may be susceptible to the development of an unhealthy condition. The terms "treatment," "treating" and "to treat" are also intended to include the enhancement of one or more primary prophylactic or therapeutic measures. The terms "treatment," "treating" and "to treat" further intended to include the dietary management of a disease or condition or the dietary management for prophylaxis or prevention a disease or condition. As used herein, the term "patient" is understood to include a mammal such as an animal and, more preferably, a human that is receiving or intended to receive treatment, as it is herein defined. While the terms "individual" and "patient" are often used herein to refer to a human, the invention is not so limited. Accordingly, the terms "individual" and "patient" refer to any animal, mammal or human having or at risk for a medical condition that can benefit from the treatment. In this context, "mammal" includes, but is not limited to, rodents, aquatic mammals, domestic animals such as dogs and cats, farm animals such as sheep, pigs, cows and horses, and humans. Wherein the term "mammal" is used, it is contemplated that it also applies to other animals that are capable of the effect exhibited or intended to be exhibited by the mammal. In the context of the present invention, the term "swallowing disorder" refers to any kind of physiologic dysfunction and/or disorder that is associated with difficulties and/or an impairment of swallowing, and to the symptoms thereof, which in medical terms is referred to as dysphagia, including esophageal and oral pharyngeal dysphagia, and aspiration. Esophageal dysphagia affects a large number of individuals of all ages, but is generally treatable with medications and is considered a less serious form of dysphagia. Esophageal dysphagia is often a consequence of mucosal, mediastinal, or neuromuscular diseases. Mucosal (intrinsic) diseases narrow the lumen through inflammation, fibrosis, or neoplasia associated with various conditions (e.g., peptic stricture secondary to gastroesophageal reflux disease, esophageal rings and webs [e.g., sideropenic dysphagia or Plummer-Vinson syndrome], esophageal tumors, chemical injury [e.g., caustic ingestion, pill esophagitis, sclerotherapy for varices], radiation injury, infectious esophagitis, and eosinophilic esophagitis). Mediastinal (extrinsic) diseases obstruct the esophagus by direct invasion or through lymph node enlargement associated with various conditions (tumors [e.g., lung cancer, lymphoma], infections [e.g., tuberculosis, histoplasmosis], and cardiovascular [dilated auricula and vascular compression]). Neuromuscular diseases may affect the esophageal smooth muscle and its innervation, disrupting peristalsis or lower esophageal sphincter relaxation, or both, commonly associated with various conditions (achalasia [both idiopathic and associated with Chagas disease], scleroderma, other motility disorders, and a consequence of surgery [i.e., after fundoplication and antireflux interventions]). It is also common for individuals with intraluminal foreign bodies to experience acute esophageal dysphagia. Oral pharyngeal dysphagia, on the other hand, is a very serious condition and is generally not treatable with medication. Oral pharyngeal dysphagia also affects individuals of all ages, but is more prevalent in older individuals. Worldwide, oral pharyngeal dysphagia affects approximately 22 million people over the age of 50. Oral pharyngeal dysphagia is often a consequence of an acute event, such as a stroke, brain injury, or surgery for oral or throat cancer. In addition, radiotherapy and chemotherapy may weaken the muscles and degrade the nerves associated with the physiology and nervous innervation of the swallow reflex. It is also common for individuals with progressive neuromuscular diseases, such as Parkinson's Disease, to experience increasing difficulty in swallowing initiation. Representative causes of oropharyngeal dysphagia include those associated neurological illnesses (brainstem tumors, head trauma, stroke, cerebral palsy, Guillain-Barre syndrome, Huntington's disease, multiple sclerosis, polio, post-polio syndrome, Tardive dyskinesia, metabolic encephalopathies, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, dementia), infectious illnesses (diphtheria, botulism, Lyme disease, syphilis, mucositis [herpetic, cytomegalovirus, Candida, etc.]), autoimmune illnesses (lupus, scleroderma, Sjogren's syndrome), metabolic illnesses (amyloidosis, Cushing's syndrome, thyrotoxicosis, Wilson's disease), myopathic illnesses (connective tissue disease, dermatomyositis, myasthenia gravis, myotonic dystrophy, oculopharyngeal dystrophy, polymyositis, sarcoidosis, paraneoplastic syndromes, inflammatory myopathy), iatrogenic illnesses (medication side effects [e.g., chemotherapy, neuroleptics, etc.], post surgical muscular or neurogenic, radiation therapy, corrosive [pill injury, intentional]), and structural illnesses (cricopharyngeal bar, Zenker's diverticulum, cervical webs, oropharyngeal tumors, osteophytes and skeletal abnormalities, congenital [cleft palate, diverticulae, pouches, etc.]). Severity of dysphagia may vary from: (i) minimal (perceived) difficulty in safely swallowing foods and liquids, (ii) an inability to swallow without significant risk for aspiration or choking, and (iii) a complete inability to swallow. Commonly, the inability to properly swallow foods and liquids may be due to food boluses being broken up into smaller fragments, which may enter the airway or leave unwanted residues in the oropharyngeal and/or esophageal tract during the swallowing process, which symptom is clinically referred to as "aspiration". If enough material enters the lungs through aspiration, it is possible that the patient may drown on the food/liquid that has built up in the lungs. Even small volumes of aspirated food may lead to bronchopneumonia infection, and chronic aspiration may lead to bronchiectasis and may cause some cases of asthma. It has been surprisingly found that certain patient populations are more likely to aspirate at one time or another relative to the swallowing reflex. For example, if a patient has reduced sensation, aspiration is particularly likely to occur before the swallowing reflex. Patients with very poor pharyngeal constriction may be more likely to aspirate after the swallowing reflex, on material remaining post-swallow in an uncleared pharynx. If complete airway closure is not possible, aspiration during the swallowing reflex, i.e. during the time of maximum (but incomplete) airway closure may be likely. Aspiration "before", "during" and "after" the swallowing reflex do not mutually exclude each other, i.e. subjects may exhibit more than one type of aspiration such as aspiration before and during the swallowing reflex, aspiration before and after the swallowing reflex, or aspiration during and after the swallowing reflex. According to these findings, the method of the invention comprises in a first step classifying the patient into a specific patient group selected from (a) Aspiration before the swallowing reflex, (b) Aspiration during the swallowing reflex, (c) Aspiration after the swallowing reflex, (d) Aspiration before and during the swallowing reflex, (℮) Aspiration before and after the swallowing reflex, or (f) Aspiration during and after the swallowing reflex. An implication of this classification is that a particular bolus type may be better suited to a particular patient group, depending on when aspiration occurs, or is most likely to occur. Classifying the patients into one of these groups may be accomplished by any method known in the art. In the studies underlying the present invention, a standard videofluoroscopy technique was used (as described e.g. in Kendall and Leonard, "Dysphagia", 2000) to determine whether aspiration in a patient occurs before, during or after, before and during, before and after, or during and after the swallowing reflex. Bolus Therefore, the method of the invention comprises selecting and administering to a patient a bolus which is specifically suited for the type of aspiration occurring in the patient, wherein the bolus is not only modified with regard to its shear viscosity, but with regard to at least one further rheological property such as its cohesiveness. Preferably, said bolus is selected from cohesive thin liquids and cohesive thickened liquids. Cohesive thin liquids It was surprisingly found that in patients who aspirate (a) before the swallowing reflex, (c) after the swallowing reflex, (d) before and during the swallowing reflex, (℮) aspiration before and after the swallowing reflex, or (f) during and after the swallowing reflex, aspiration prevalence could be significantly reduced by administering a bolus having the rheological properties of a cohesive thin liquid. In one preferred embodiment, that cohesive thin liquid bolus has (i) a shear viscosity of less than about 50 mPas, preferably from 5 to 45 mPas, more preferably from 10 to 40 mPas, and most preferably from 20 to 30 mPas, when measured at a shear rate of 50s-l, and (ii) a relaxation time, determined by a Capillary Breakup Extensional Rheometry (CaBER) experiment, of more than 10 ms (milliseconds) at a temperature of 20° C. Shear viscosity is a commonly measured rheological property, which is often referred to as simply viscosity, and which may be determined by any method known in the art. In the present invention, shear viscosity was determined using concentric cylinders in a standard research-grade rheometer (Anton Paar MCR). Said parameter describes the reaction of a material to applied shear stress. In other words, shear viscosity is the ratio between "stress" (force per unit area) exerted on the surface of a fluid, in the lateral or horizontal direction, to the change in velocity of the fluid as you move down in the fluid (a "velocity gradient"). Cohesiveness is a parameter that relates to the ability of a portion of liquid to hold together when being stretched (extended, elongated) in a flow, e.g. passing through a constriction, dewetting of a drop on a surface or thinning of a liquid filament. In the context of the present disclosure, the relaxation time of a bolus as a measure of its cohesiveness was determined by a Capillary Breakup Extensional Rheometry (CaBER) experiment. The herein used Capillary Breakup Extensional Rheometer is an example for a rheometer applying extensional stress. During the CaBER experiment as performed herein for measuring the relaxation time of the bolus, a drop of said bolus is placed between two vertically aligned and parallel circular metal surfaces, both having a diameter of 6mm. The metal surfaces are then rapidly separated linearly over a time interval of 50 ms (milliseconds). The filament formed by this stretching action subsequently thins under the action of interfacial tension and the thinning process is followed quantitatively using a laser sheet measuring the filament diameter at its mid-point. The relaxation time in a CaBER experiment is determined by plotting the normalised natural logarithm of the filament diameter during the thinning process versus time and determining the slope of the linear portion (din (D/D0)/dt) of this curve, where D is the filament diameter, DO the filament diameter at time zero and t the time of filament thinning. The relaxation time in this context is then defined as minus one third (-1/3) times the inverse of this slope, i.e. -l/(3dln(D/D0)/dt).] Administering a bolus of the cohesive thin liquid type was found to be particularly beneficial in patients who were classified into one of the groups of (a) Aspiration before the swallowing reflex, (c) Aspiration after the swallowing reflex, or (℮) Aspiration before and after the swallowing reflex. Cohesive thickened liquids It was further found that in patients who aspirate (c) after the swallowing reflex, (d) before and during the swallowing reflex, or (f) during and after the swallowing reflex, aspiration prevalence could be significantly reduced by administering a bolus having the rheological properties of a cohesive thickened liquid. It is preferred that said cohesive thickened liquid bolus has (i) a shear viscosity of more than about 50mPas, preferably from 55 to 350 mPas, more preferably from 60 to 200 mPas, and most preferably from 70 to 100 mPas, when measured at a shear rate of 50 s-1, and (ii) a relaxation time, determined by a Capillary Breakup Extensional Rheometry (CaBER) experiment, of more than 10 ms (milliseconds) at a temperature of 20° C, wherein said shear viscosity and relaxation time are determined as set out above for cohesive thin liquids. Administering a bolus of the cohesive thickened liquid type was found to be particularly beneficial in patients who were classified into one of the groups of (d) Aspiration before and during the swallowing reflex, or (f) Aspiration during and after the swallowing reflex.

The term "protein" also includes "artificial proteins" which refers to linear or non-linear polypeptides, consisting of alternating repeats of a peptide. The following examples are provided to further illustrate the present invention. They are not intended to be limiting the scope of the present invention. EXAMPLES Example 1 Study outline for determining the aspiration type The ability of the claimed method to specifically address different specific types of dysphagic conditions can be validated clinically through an interventional crossover study. In such a study, three different liquid bolus types selected from conventional thickened liquids, cohesive thin liquids and cohesive thin liquids are administered to patients diagnosed for oropharyngeal dysphagia. A standard videofluoroscopy method is used for determining the aspiration type. Aspiration of a liquid bolus before, during or after an active swallowing reflex can be differentiated by using this technique and thus allows to unambiguously validate the ability of a given bolus to ameliorate specific types of aspirations as well as combinations thereof. Thickened liquids Cohesive thin liquids Cohesive thickened liquids Aspiration before swallowing reflex Currently best solution improves control and accidental transfer into pharynx Better solution than thickened liquids : more natural in appearance and still preventing accidental Added value compared to cohesive thin liquids in some cases Results transfer because of high force need to propel, open siphon effect Aspiration during swallowing reflex The only solution to allow more adaptation time for the airway protection reflex Not beneficial No added value compared to ordinary thickened liquids, but equally good Aspiration after swallowing reflex Not helpful, can be detrimental (residues) Beneficial due to better cohesiveness in dewetting of drops. Better than ordinary thickened liquids, but worse than cohesive thin ones. Before AND during Good solution. Better solution than thickened liquids, depends on seriousness of « during » (coordination) problem The best solution Before AND after Not helpful if the « after» (residue) problem is severe The best solution. No added benefit compared to cohesive thin liquids During AND after Not helpful if the « after» (residue) problem is severe Better solution than thickened liquids, depends on seriousness of « during » (coordination) problem The best solution. All three Needs careful diagnosis and individually tailored recommendations Discussion Aspiration before the swallowing is expected in roughly half of all patients exhibiting aspiration. In these patients, cohesive thin liquids were shown to have the best effect in ameliorating aspiration prevalence. Aspiration during the swallowing reflex is expected in roughly one third of all patients exhibiting aspiration. In these patients, conventional thickened liquids and cohesive thickened liquids were shown to have equally good effects in ameliorating aspiration prevalence. Aspiration after the swallowing reflex is expected in roughly half of all patients exhibiting aspiration. In these patients, cohesive thin liquids were shown to have the best effect in ameliorating aspiration prevalence, followed by cohesive thickened liquids. Conventional thickened liquids proved to be detrimental in these patients. A combination of aspiration before and during the swallowing reflex is expected in less than one tenth of all patients exhibiting aspiration. In these patients, cohesive thickened liquids proved to be the best solution, followed by cohesive thin liquids, which were shown to have an improved effect in ameliorating aspiration prevalence when compared to conventional thickened liquids. A combination of aspiration before and after the swallowing reflex is expected in less than one tenth of all patients exhibiting aspiration. In these patients, cohesive thin liquids were shown to have the best effect in ameliorating aspiration prevalence. Conventional thickened liquids proved to be rather detrimental in these patients. A combination of aspiration during and after the swallowing reflex is expected in less than one tenth of all patients exhibiting aspiration. In these patients, cohesive thickened liquids were shown to be the best solution, followed by cohesive thin liquids. Conventional thickened liquids proved to be rather detrimental in these patients. 1.
