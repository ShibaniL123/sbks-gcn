81.5: (5-bromomethyl-3-isopropyl-2,4-dioxo-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrimidin-1-yl)-methyl acetate
0.2 ml (2.5 mmol) of a solution of phosphorus tribromide in 4 ml of dichloromethane is added to a solution of 0.6 g (2.3 mmol) of (5-hydroxymethyl-3-isopropyl-2,4-dioxo-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrimidin-1-yl)-methyl acetate in 12 ml of dichloromethane, cooled to 0° C. The mixture is stirred at 0° C. for 30 minutes. After returning to room temperature, the mixture is hydrolysed with water and then with a saturated aqueous solution of sodium hydrogen carbonate. The product is extracted with dichloromethane. The organic phase is washed once with water and then dried over magnesium sulphate, filtered and concentrated under vacuum. The crude residue is purified by silica gel chromatography eluted with a dichloromethane/methanol 99/1 mixture. 0.41 g (29%) of (5-bromomethyl-3-isopropyl-2,4-dioxo-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrimidin-1-yl)-methyl acetate is obtained in the form of a white solid.
