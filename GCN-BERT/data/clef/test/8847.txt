MULTIPURPOSE FIRST AID APPARATUS FIELD OF THE INVENTION [0001] The present invention relates to a multipurpose first aid apparatus, and in particular to a multipurpose first aid apparatus for use to carry first aid apparatus and be itself used as first aid apparatus in the case of an emergency. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0002] In the specification the invention is described with reference to the example of use by a horse rider and horse, as this is one of many useful applications of the invention. However, the invention can be used for a great many different situations, including with other animals and for other activities. It is not intended that the invention be in anyway limited to use by a horse rider and horse. [OGQSj Many people live, work or visit “outback” Australia or other similar harsh environments. For example, mine works may be visiting a remote potential site for testing or investigation, or farmers may be working the land. Recreationally people enjoy walking, camping, fishing, biking, and other outdoor pursuits in the outback, and also closer to urban conurbations. People may walk with a dog or other pet, or go horse riding, on the land. Each and ail of these activities can be dangerous, at times, and in particular if you are out of phone range or some distance from immediate medical or veterinary assistance. In such circumstances a temporary fix is required to splint or support an injury so that the person or animal can be stabilised to be moved to obtain medical care at a hospital, for example. [0004] In a remote outback or bush environment breaking a leg or arm can be a very serious thing and medical assistance must be sought and obtained as soon as possible. Similarly, if a horse is injured on a ride, if is desirable to be able to stabilise any injury and improve the comfort of the horse to facilitate getting to help. [0005] A person may injure themselves away from home but can only contact the emergency services or cal! for medical or veterinary assistance by returning home. With less serious injuries such as cuts and scratches, it is also preferable to be able to treat these as soon as possible to make the injured person as comfortable as possible and to protect the injured area for the journey home. [0006] A first aid kit containing useful items may be carried by a person, when away from home, containing useful items for medical treatment in case of injury or accident. These known kits are generally of a standard hard box form and cannot be readily carried by a person, or rider of a horse or quad bike, for example. Further, carrying of a hard box could contribute to an accident on impact, and so is undesirable for outdoor use. A soft form first aid kit for use by horse riders may be attached to the horse’s strapping but will strike or rub on the horse as riding, making it most uncomfortable. First aid supplies can be put into saddle bags but these are not convenient to carry al! the very many items as are required for first aid in an emergency. Saddle bags can cause sweating and friction as they sit directly on the horse’s skin and bounce or chafe with the riding movement. The only alternative is for the rider to wear a backpack or bum bag to carry first aid supplies which is extremely uncomfortable during the movement of riding. Further, the rider carrying a bag causes problems with balance, as well as distracting the rider if making adjustments [0007] Large items of medical or veterinary apparatus such as spiints and supports are not convenient to carry when working or riding outdoors but would be incredibly useful in the event of an accident. For example, in the situation where a person has sprained or broken a wrist having a temporary support or splint would dramatically improve the comfort and assist them to get to help or to wait until help arrived. In remote areas there is no mobile phone coverage and unless the person has a satellite phone or radio, help cannot be called until the person gets back to base. In these situations any medical assistance that can be applied in the Held will reduce the pain of the person and improve their ability to get to help and not be stranded. Ρ008] Similarly, if out riding a horse, the animal may injure its leg on a ride, leading to blood loss; suitable bandages, antiseptic and electrolyte replacement should be carried and applied to assist the horse to get to where veterinary assistance can be organised. Where the injury is more serious, such as a break or fracture, treatment will need to wait until the rider can get the horse to assistance. [0009] It would be most desirable to be able to have a multipurpose first aid apparatus that can be conveniently and comfortably carried by a person in the case of an accident. Further it would be most desirable to have a multipurpose first aid apparatus that can be used to support an injured limb. Further it would be useful to have a multipurpose first aid apparatus that can be used for both a person and an animal in the case of injury. [0010] For clarity, any prior art referred to herein, does not constitute an admission that the prior art forms part of the common general knowledge, in Australia or elsewhere. [0011] It is an object of the present invention to provide a multipurpose first aid apparatus that at least ameliorates one or more of the aforementioned problems of the prior art.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION INCLUDING A BEST MODE Ρ049] Referring to Figures 1 to 9, a preferred embodiment of the invention will be described, used for a horse rider and horse as a useful example of the invention. Other forms of the invention may be used for a person only, or for a person and any other animal, such as a dog. The person may also use the invention when riding a motor bike, quad bike or bicycle, for example. Although described here for a horse and horse rider the same apparatus and method of use can be used in the other situations, although the contents of the apparatus may be varied to suit the particular application, as mentioned elsewhere. [0050] As illustrated the multipurpose first aid apparatus 1, includes body 10 with straps 12 and 14, and anchors 18 and 18. Apparatus 1 is adapted to be made of strong durable materials suitable for use outdoors and to be tolerant to heat, sunlight and rain. Body 10 as illustrated is made of a strong canvas material known as “12oz” weight, similar to that used for swags and resistant to ingress of water. Other strong and weatherproof materials may be used instead such as plastics or vinyl. Body 10 is made of a strong material but is soft, and so will not easily be damaged or contribute to or cause injury through impact. [0051] Body 10 is illustrated as 670 millimetres by 500 millimetres and 30 millimetres thick when in the unrolled and unfolded state. When folded body 10 has dimensions of 335 millimetres by 500 millimetres by 30 millimetres thick. When roiled body 10 reduces to 120 millimetres wide by 335 millimetres and 110 millimetres thick. The dimensions used are convenient to carry apparatus 1 during use and to apply body 10 to a limb, as described in more detail below. Ρ052] Referring to Figures 1 and 2 in particular saddle 20 is shown as would be used on a horse (not shown for ease of illustration). Saddle 20 incudes loops 22 and 24 as is usual and it to these loops that anchors 16 and 18 respectively attach. Other forms of saddle include leather straps or saddle doth as attachment points for apparatus 1 to the saddle instead of loops 22 and 24. Anchors 16 and 18 are illustrated as metal clips that can be pressed to open to enable passing over loop 22 or 24 and then released to close dipping the anchor to the loop in a strong manner. The anchor will not release from the loop until a person again presses to open the clip and moves the anchor out of the loop. Any suitable secure clip or fastening can be used instead of anchors 16 and 18. Anchors 16 and 18 are particular useful as they can be very easily released for access to apparatus 1 and similarly quickly reattached to the back of saddle 20. Where apparatus 1 is used attached to a person, this may be through use of a belt loop incorporated in body 10 through which the person can thread their belt to securely attach apparatus 1 to themselves. Clearly many different forms of attachment can be used depending on to what apparatus 1 is to be attached. Where apparatus 1 is to be attached to a vehicle such as a motor bike a dip or strap may be used. In other forms of the invention apparatus 1 may be placed or secured behind the seat of a vehicle. [0053] The positioning of apparatus 1 for use with a horse has been carefully considered and devised to be a convenient location for use by the rider during a ride but most importantly does not inconvenience the horse. Apparatus 1, when attached through use of anchors 16 and 18 and loops 22 and 24, is in a raised position just behind the rider. The position means that apparatus 1 does not contact the back of the horse or bump on the horses back, causing discomfort. Since apparatus 1 is also not being carried by the rider there is no additional discomfort to the rider either, which is advantageous. Similarly, when carried by a rider of motor bike, quad bike or similar apparatus 1 can be similarly mounted behind the rider to enable easy access during a ride without inconveniencing the rider during use. [0054] To remove apparatus 1 anchors 16 and 18 are undipped and apparatus 1 is then free to be removed completely for use. [0055] Referring to Figure 3 in particular apparatus 1 has been removed and dips 26 and 28 of straps 12 and 14 respectively undipped. Clips 26 and 28 as shown are plastic clips of a known kind having receiving parts 26a and 28a and projecting parts 26b and 28b. Therefore, strap 12 has receiving part 26a at one end and is attached to body 10 dose to that end; the other end has projecting part 26b. Similarly, strap 14 has receiving part 28a at one end and is attached to body 10 dose to that end; the other end has projecting part 28b. In use straps 12 and 14 hang loose from body 10 except where attached so that body 10 can be roiled up and once rolled up straps 12 and 14 can be wrapped around the rolled body 10 and then held in the roiled position by use of clips 26 and 28. The manner of roiling and securing the straps is similar to that used for a swag. To unroll body 10 the process is reversed so that clips 26 and 28 are undipped releasing straps 12 and 14 so they can be unwound. Once unwound body 10 can be unzipped using zip 30 to be a similar length to straps 12 and 14. Zip 30 is a strong zip as used with canvas material and runs around the edge of body 10 on three sides. Ρ056] Outer pocket 32 is made of strong “12oz” canvas, including a padded interior and strong, reliable zip (not shown). Alternatively, piastic or vinyl could be used for pocket 32 and the padding omitted if desired. Pocket 32 is adapted to be positioned at the top of apparatus 1 when roiled up and attached to saddle 20. The positioning is important to enable use to keep a mobile phone or similar communication device when riding while keeping it convenient for use. The rider can simply reach behind him or her and access the mobile from the pocket at any time during a ride. Use of the canvas and strong zip is beneficial to prevent the mobile phone from getting splashed by water, or mud and most importantly to prevent Ingress of dust. The padding also protects the mobile phone while travelling along. A persona! locating beacon is also included in outer pocket 32 for ready access and activation in the case of an emergency. The contents of outer pocket 32 can be varied as is suitable to a particular application. [0057] Referring to Figure 4 in particular apparatus 1 has been detached, unrolled and unzipped and then unfolded to reveal inner pockets 34 and 36. Three or more inner pockets may be included instead. Inner pockets 34 and 36 are removed for use as a support for a limb by means of zips (not shown). Inner pockets 34 and 36 have the dual purpose of being used to contain items and for use in an emergency, as described further below. Any items may be carried within pockets 34 and 36. As illustrated it is intended for pocket 34 to be used as an equine survival pouch to contain useful items increase of illness or injury to the horse. These items may include a hoof pick, pliers, bandages, swabs, syringe, electrolyte powder and any other items that it may be desired to be carried. For other uses the items included can be varied to suit the needs of the person, animal or a vehicle for which the apparatus is to be used. [0058] Pocket 36 is used as a human survival pouch for items useful for treatment of the rider in the case of a medical emergency. Items may include hand sanitiser, lip balm, insect repellent, piasters, paper tape, bandage conforming elastic gauze, non-adherent dressing, crepe bandage, triangular bandage, safety pins, eyewash saline ampoules, dressing combined pad, wound dressings, burn aid gel, press seal bags, antiseptic swabs, pencil and notebook, alcohol swabs, disposable resuscitation mask, torch, splinter probe, sunscreen, eye pad, antiseptic cream, pain killers, bandages including a compression bandage. Either pocket 34 or 36 may also include items for use for treatment of either the horse or rider, including first aid instruction sheets, forceps, saline ampoules, bandages, a survival book or other useful literature, scissors, tweezers, antiseptic, gloves, sodium chloride pods, thermal blanket, gauze or cotton wool. Any items that may be deemed useful in a particular environment can be carried in either pocket 34 or 36, or for use for a person or animal. Other arrangements of pockets could be used. However, the segregation of items into those for use for the horse and items for use by the rider is a convenient way to assist to find items quickly. Where apparatus 1 is used just for a person a!! the items will be useful for the person, and the different pockets can be used to segregate items as is useful for ease of retrieval of the items. Where the apparatus is used on a bike or quad bike for example, or other vehicle items useful for emergency situations for use of the bike, quad bike or other vehicle may be included in one pocket of the apparatus. Where the apparatus is used with for a person and a dog one of the pockets may contain items useful for treatment of the dog in the case of accident or injury. [0059] Pockets 34 and 36 are illustrated as clear plastic pockets so that the contents can be seen clearly and any item required easily found and removed for use. It may be important to make finding items as easy as possible as in an emergency situation shock or panic may cloud the mind of the person making it difficult to do things such as to locate a compression bandage to stop bleeding. Each pocket 34 and 36 can be closed by zip lock closures 38 and 40 to prevent items from falling out. Zip lock closures 38 and 40 seal pockets 34 and 36 enabling them to be waterproof. The waterproofing stops water or dust from getting inside pockets 38 and 40 damaging the contents. A waterproof liner or insert can be carried in one of the pockets, taken out and put in the pocket for use as a water carrier. [0060] Extra strap 42 is also carried in either pocket 34 or 36 for use when body 10 is being used to support an injury. Extra strap 42 includes clip 44, having receiving part 44a and projecting part 44b, the same as for straps 12 and 14. [0061] Referring to Figures 5 and 6 in particular, apparatus 1 is being used to splint or support the rider’s leg 46 that has been injured. The injury may be a cut and the support is then used to help minimise the bleeding. The injury may be a sprain or fracture to a bond or joint. As illustrated the rider has sprained their knee while dismounting and so has used apparatus 1 to support the joint to make it possible to get back on the horse to ride home. To use apparatus 1 as a support or splint, anchors 16 and 18 have been undipped, as have dips 26 and 28 so that straps 12 and 14 are free and body 10 can be unrolled to a rectangle of material. Zip 30 is unzipped to retrieve extra strap 42 and to remove pockets 34 and 36. if water is going to be used water is now filled into pocket 34 or 36. Optionally, a large removable plastic pocket may be included, and in this case this pocket may be filled with water. Zip 30 is zipped up and body 10 used to wrap around the injured area, in the example the knee of leg 46. Body 10 wraps tightly around the knee of leg 46 followed by strap 12 and strap 14. Each strap is wound around tightly and then clipped together using clips 26 and 28. In this way a strong support is provided to stabilise the injured knee joint. To further hold body 10 around the knee, extra strap 42 is used between strap 12 and strap 14 and clipped tightly together by clip 44. [0062] Although illustrated for use on the rider, apparatus 1 can be used in exactly the same way to provide support to an injured leg of the horse or in other forms of the invention for a dog or other animal. The manner of use and support given is the same. The rider can support the injured leg of the horse quickly and easily so they can both seek professional assistance. [0063] Reflective strip 48 can be seen in Figure 5 running along the top outer surface of body 10. In use, when rolled up and attached to saddle 20 reflective strip 48 runs along the back of apparatus 1. Reflective strip 48 assists traffic to see the horse and rider on roads at night; in the case of an emergency situation lights will reflect off the strip and help to locate an injured horse and rider. [0064] Referring to Figures 7 and 8 in particular apparatus 1 is shown used for an alternative injury of the rider to arm 50. Again body 10 is removed as described above and wrapped around the injured area of the rider’s body. Again straps 12 and 14 are wrapped tightly and clipped to maintain body 10 tightly around the injured area. Extra strap 42 can be used in this case to create a sling for arm 50 by being attached to strap 12 round the neck of the person and across their back to attach to strap 14. The created sling supports the injured arm enabling the rider to ride or walk more comfortably until medical attention can be obtained. In another form of the invention extra strap 42 can be omitted and the two straps 12 and 14 themselves can be lengthened and connected together about the neck of the person to support an arm. In this form of the invention body 10 can be folded or rolled to form a tube or U-shaped support into which the arm of the person can be put and supported by the straps about the neck of the person. [0065] Body 10 with use of straps 12, 14 and 42 can be used in other areas of the body of the rider or horse as required. Numerous different configurations of body 10 with straps 12 and 14 and if desired extra strap 42. In an emergency situation the easy to use straps and body 10 make apparatus quick and simple to use, without any specialist training, skills or knowledge. Survival books include the arrangement of splints and supports such as a sling but these are generally complex, tied from bandages or pieces of material. Use of apparatus 1 provides a strong support which can easy be assembled by any one without the need for more than very simple pictorial instructions. [0066] Referring to Figure 9 it may be desired to fill body 1 with water from tap 52. Any available water source such as a creek, dam or stream could be used instead. Ice or even warm water could also be used if available and depending on the nature of the injury to be treated. For example, to reduce swelling and bruising it may be desirable to keep an injury cool. The water may be used not only for application of water to an injury but to carry water to drink or for other use in an emergency situation. [0067] Overall apparatus 1 has numerous uses, on a day to day basis to carry useful items such as a mobile phone and first aid supplies but also in an emergency situation to be used to support an injured limb until professional help can be sought. The useful nature of apparatus 1 and the convenience and comfortable nature of its use is likely to mean rapid adoption in the equine community once seen, as it solves this long felt want for such a product. Where a person is in a remote situation, use of apparatus 1 is convenient by not interfering with travelling, allows ready access to mobile phone or other items and can support an injured limb of a person or animal in the case of an accident before seeking medical or veterinary assistance, [0068] For any of the many and varied uses of the invention, the method of use is the same, no adaptation is needed, except for the inclusion of different items, [0069] It will be apparent to a person skilled in the art that changes may be made to the embodiment disclosed herein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention in its various aspects.
