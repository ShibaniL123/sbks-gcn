The preparation of 1-[(6-fluoro-benzonitrile-2-yl)methyl]-3-methyl-7-(2-butyne-1-yl)-8-[(R)-3-t-butyloxycarbonyla mino-piperidine-1-yl]-xanthine
Adding 1-[(6-fluoro-benzonitrile-2-yl)methyl]-3-methyl-7-(2-butyne-1-yl)-8-bromoxanthine (3.5 g, 7.4 mmol), potassium carbonate (1.9 g, 14 mmol) and 3-(R)-t-butyloxycarbonyl-aminopiperidine (1.6 g, 8 mmol) into a 50ml round-bottom flask, adding 25 mL of N,N-dimethylformamides, heating to 80Â°C and stirring for 5 hours; after the reaction was completed, cooling to room temperature, pouring the reaction liquid into ice water to precipitate solid, filtrating by air pump and vacuum drying to obtain 2.9 g yellowish solid, with a yield of 72%. ES-API(m/z):[M+H]+ 550.3.
