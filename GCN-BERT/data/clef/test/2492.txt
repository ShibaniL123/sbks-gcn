MULTIVALENT LIGANDS TARGETING VEGFR CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims the benefit of priority to U.S. Provisional Application 61/993,682 filed May 15, 2014, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in their entireties. FIELD The disclosed subject matter relates generally to compounds for angiogenesis targeted therapy and imaging, in particular deleterious angiogenesis associated with diseases such as cancer. BACKGROUND Normal angiogenesis plays an important role in a variety of processes including embryonic development, wound healing and several components of female reproductive function. Deleterious angiogenesis has been associated with disease states including diabetic retinopathy, psoriasis, cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, atheroma, Kaposi's sarcoma and haemangioma (Fan et ah, 1995, Trends Pharmacol. Set 16:57-66; Folknan, 1995, Nature Medicine 1 :27-31). Vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs) are regulators of angiogenesis. VEGF binds to tyrosine kinase receptors on the cell surface, known as VEGFR1 (Flt-1), VEGFR2 (Flk-1, KDR), and VEGFR3 (Flt-4). This results in stimulation of the receptor- associated tyrosine kinase activity, which leads to phosphorylation of tyrosine residues on both the receptor and other intracellular molecules. These changes in tyrosine phosphorylation initiate a signaling cascade leading to a variety of cellular responses including inducing endothelial cell proliferation, promoting cell migration, and inhibiting apoptosis. U.S. Patent No. RE42,353 discloses certain quinazoline compounds that inhibit the effects of VEGF. The quinazoline compounds are useful for treating diseases associated with angiogenesis and/or increased vascular permeability such as cancer, diabetes, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, Kaposi's sarcoma, haemangioma, acute and chronic nephropathies, atheroma, arterial restenosis, autoimmune diseases, acute inflammation, and ocular diseases with retinal vessel proliferation. However, a wide variability in response to treatment with these drugs has been observed in cancer patients. Michalski et al. developed radio-labeled VEGF/VEGFR antibodies for imaging VEGFR expression in various disease models (European J Nuclear Med Mol Imaging, 201 1, 38:358-377). However, these probes exhibit low to moderate tumor-to-background ratio in VEGFR expressing cells, despite their high receptor affinity. The imaging potential of these probes are also limited by the slow clearance of antibodies from the blood, high uptake in non- targeted tissues such as kidney, and poor extravasations and diffusion into the extracellular space. What are needed are compounds and methods to non-invasively determine VEGFR expression levels in cells in vivo. Further, compounds that bind selectively to VEGFR expressing cells are also needed. Still further, what are needed are compounds that exhibit fast clearance from the blood and/or exhibit low uptake in non-targeted tissues such as the kidney. The compositions and methods disclosed herein address these and other needs. SUMMARY In accordance with the purposes of the disclosed subject matter, as embodied and broadly described herein, disclosed are compounds, and methods of making and using the compounds.

Thus, the nitroxide molecule being paramagnetic, simply enhances the energy or excitation level subjected to the magnetic field during the magnetic resonance. Therapeutic Moiety The disclosed compounds can also contain a therapeutic moiety. The detectable moiety can be linked to a therapeutic moiety. Therapeutic moiety refers to a group that when administered to a subject, will cure, or at least relieve to some extent, one or more symptoms of, a disease or disorder.

In addition, therapeutic moiety includes those agents capable of direct toxicity and/or capable of inducing toxicity towards healthy and/or unhealthy cells in the body. Also, the therapeutic moiety can be capable of inducing and/or priming the immune system against potential pathogens. A number of mechanisms are possible including without limitation, (i) a radioisotope linked to a protein as is the case with a radiolabeled protein, (ii) an antibody linked to an enzyme that metabolizes a substance, such as a prodrug, thus rendering it active in vivo, (iii) an antibody linked to a small molecule therapeutic agent, (iv) a radioisotope, (v) a carbohydrate, (vi) a lipid, (vii) a thermal ablation agent, (viii) a photosensitizing agent, and (ix) a vaccine agent. The therapeutic compound or moiety can be one that kills or inhibits cancer cells directly (e.g., cisplatin) or it can be one that can kill or inhibit a cancer cell indirectly (e.g., gold nanoparticles that kill or destroy cancer cells when heated using a light source). In one aspect, the compounds can include therapeutic moieties including without limitation small molecules or drugs. In some embodiments, the drug is doxorubicin. In some embodiments, doxorubicin can be substituted with a doxorubicin analog such as fluorescein. The spectroscopic signature of fluorescein (UV absorbance (229nm), visible absorbance (495 nm) and strong fluorescence (520 nm)) makes it an inexpensive and easy molecule to monitor. In some embodiments, the therapeutic moiety can comprise a targeting moiety, such as a peptide. In a specific example, the therapeutic moiety is a VEGFR ligand, such as vandetanib.

Examples of these classes are known in the art. In one embodiment, the compounds are formulated for pulmonary delivery, such as intranasal administration or oral inhalation. The respiratory tract is the structure involved in the exchange of gases between the atmosphere and the blood stream. The lungs are branching structures ultimately ending with the alveoli where the exchange of gases occurs. The alveolar surface area is the largest in the respiratory system and is where drug absorbtion occurs. The alveoli are covered by a thin epithelium without cilia or a mucus blanket and secrete surfactant phospholipids. Carriers for pulmonary formulations can be divided into those for dry powder formulations and for administration as solutions. Aerosols for the delivery of therapeutic agents to the respiratory tract are known in the art. For administration via the upper respiratory tract, the formulation can be formulated into a solution, e.g., water or isotonic saline, buffered or unbuffered, or as a suspension, for intranasal administration as drops or as a spray. Preferably, such solutions or suspensions are isotonic relative to nasal secretions and of about the same pH, ranging e.g., from about pH 4.0 to about pH 7.4 or, from pH 6.0 to pH 7.0. Buffers should be physiologically compatible and include, simply by way of example, phosphate buffers. For example, a representative nasal decongestant is described as being buffered to a pH of about 6.2. One skilled in the art can readily determine a suitable saline content and pH for an innocuous aqueous solution for nasal and/or upper respiratory administration. The compounds described herein can be co-administered with one or more additional active agents, such as diagnostic agents, therapeutic agents, and/or prophylactic agents. Methods of Making The synthetic route for preparing compounds as disclosed herein is illustrated in Scheme 1. For example, the linker (e.g. compound 2) can be prepared by combining amino alcohol (e.g. compound 1) with carbonyldiimidazole in the presence of an alkyl amine (e.g. triethylamine). After the linker (2) is synthesized and the solvent removed, the VEGFR binding moiety (e.g. ZD-G1) can be linked to the linker by combining the VEGFR binding moiety (ZD-G1) to the linker (2). The detection moiety can then be linked to the linker. Alternatively, additional VEGFR binding moieties can be added to produce the trimer (ZD-G3). For example, the detection moiety can be linked to the linker via an amine group. This can be carried out by combining the amine (e.g. ethyl diamine) with the VEGFR-linker complex (compound 3) then conjugating a chelator (e.g. DOTA-NHS-ester) to the resulting complex to form for e.g. compound 4. A radiolabel (e.g. 64Cu) can then be chelated to compound 4 by combining compound 4 with a solution of the radiolabel (e.g. ^CuCk in HC1 and ammonium acetate). The synthesized compound can be purified by methods known to those of ordinary skill in the art, for. e.g., semipreparative radio-HPLC. Scheme 1: Other methods for coupling the VEGF binding moiety and detectible moiety to a linker are disclosed herein. The particular method will depend on the specific detectible moiety, VEGF binding moiety, and linker. Generally, the VEGF binding moiety can be treated with a linker that can form a bond with the VEGF binding moiety. That product can then be coupled with the detectable moiety. Alternatively, the linker and the detectible moiety can be coupled beforehand and then coupled with the VEGF binding moiety. Alternatively, the linker, VEGF binding moiety, and the detectible moiety can be coupled simultaneously. Methods of Use VEGF ligands (for e.g. VEGF A-D, and placenta growth factor (PLGF)), stimulate cellular responses by binding to tyrosine kinase receptors on the cell surface, known as VEGFRl (Flt-1), VEGFR2 (Flk-1, KDR), and VEGFR3 (Flt-4). The VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 receptors are over expressed in a variety of tumors and are associated with advanced tumor growth and induction of tumor angiogenesis. For example, when VEGF ligands bind to VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2, a tytosine kinase signaling cascade begins in endothelial cells that stimulate the production of factors that stimulate vessel permeability, proliferation/survival, migration, and finally differentiation into mature blood vessels. This is a fundamental step in the transition of tumors from a benign state to a malignant one. In some embodiments, the compounds disclosed herein bind to VEGF receptors in VEGFR expressing cells. In some embodiments, the compounds bind to VEGFR2 in VEGFR2- expressing cells.

The disclosed compounds can be used for PET imaging of tumor VEGFR2 expression. Compounds with two or more VEGFR binding moieties have significantly increased VEGFR2 binding affinity compared with those compounds having only one VEGFR binding moiety. In the noninvasive small-animal PET imaging studies, 64Cu-DOTA-ZD-G2 showed rapid and good tumor uptake, low organs accumulations and quick liver washout, and good tumor-to- background contrast in U87MG xenograft. Overall, bivalency strategy has an efficient effect on the receptor-binding interaction and in vivo kinetics of 64Cu-DOTA-ZD-G2. The results indicate that the 64Cu-DOTA-ZD-G2 radio conjugate can be used to image tumor angiogenesis, select patient for antiangiogenic treatment, and monitor VEGFR2 -targeted cancer therapy.

XH NMR (500 MHz, DMSO): 8.715 (s, 2H, Ph-NH), 7.963 (s, 2H), 7.796(d, 2H, J=2), 7.786(d, 2H, J=2), 7.796 (d, 2H, J=2), 7.547 (m, 4H), 7.502 (s, 1H, CONH), 7.265 (s, 2H), 4.272 (m, 6H, -OCH2-), 4.058 (m, 10H), 3.975(s, 6H, -OCH3), 3.345(m, 6H), 2.876 (m, 8H), 1.96 (s, 2h, -NH2), 2.095 (m, 2H), 1.824 (m, 4h), 1.242 (m, 4h). The MS spectrum of ZD-G2: m/z 1210.5 (100, [M+H]+, calcd 1209.92); 606.0([M+2H]2+). DOTA Conjugation and Radiolabeling DOTA-NHS-Ester (3 mg, 6 μιηοΐ) was added to 0.5 ml of a 10 μιηοΙ/mL ZD-G2 DMSO solution (6 μιηοΐ), and then 50 μϊ^ triethylamine was added. The reaction mixture was stirred in the dark at ambient temperature overnight and then quenched by adding 200 μϊ^ of TFA. The crude product was purified by a semipreparative reversed-phase HPLC employing a Phenomenex Luna C-18 column (250 mm x 10 mm). Fractions containing ZD-G2-DOTA were collected, lyophilized, redissolved in DMSO at a concentration of 10 μιηοΙ/mL, and stored in the dark at -20 °C until use. ZD-Gl-DOTA was prepared using similar procedures described above. ZD-Gl-DOTA and ZD-G2-DOTA were produced in 85% and 72% yields respectively. The purified ZD-G 1 -DOTA and ZD-G2-DOTA was characterized by ITMS-CESI mass spectroscopy (MS). MS (ZD-Gl-DOTA, electrospray): m/z 847.3([M+H]+, calculated 846.27); 424.3 ( [M+2H]2+). MS (ZD-G2-DOTA, electrospray): m/z 1596.32([M+H]+, calculated 1596.3); 789.6 ([M+2H]2+). ZD-G2-DOTA and ZD-Gl-DOTA was radiolabeled using procedures known in the art. Briefly, 185 MBq (5 mCi) 64CuCl2 in 0.1 M HC1 was diluted by adding 300 μί, 0.1 M ammonium acetate (pH 5.6). ZD-Gl-DOTA or ZD-G2-DOTA (10 μιηοΙ/mL, 100 nmol) in 700 μϊ^ of 0.1 M ammonium acetate was mixed with 1~5 mCi of 64Cu(OAc)2. The mixture was vortexed and incubated at 50 °C for 1 h. 64Cu labeled compound was purified by semipreparative radio-HPLC, and the collected fraction containing 64Cu-DOTA-ZD-G2 or 64Cu-DOTA-ZD-Gl was evaporated and reconstituted in PBS, which was filtered into a sterile dose vial for use in animal experiments by passing through a 0.22-μιη Millipore filter. The radiochemical yield and chemical purity were determined by HPLC. 64Cu-DOTA-ZD-Gl and 64Cu-DOTA-ZD-G2 (Figure 1) were obtained in 80%-90% decay-corrected yield with radiochemical purity of more than 98%. The stability of ^Cu-DOTA-ZD-Gl and 64Cu-DOTA-ZD-G2 (370 KBq/100 L) was also evaluated by incubating with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37 °C for up to 24 h. Aliquots at 2 h, 6 h and 24 h were analyzed by HPLC and radio-TLC. The specific activity of 64Cu-DOTA-ZD-Gl and 64Cu-DOTA-ZD-G2 was estimated to 1.7-2.3 MBq/nmol. The radio-HP LC analysis indicated that no change in the spectrum was found after 24 h incubation, indicating that both radiotracers were stable in DMEM (10% FBS) for up to 24 h at 37 °C. Cell Lines and Animal Model U87MG human glioblastoma cells, MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells, and Hela cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA) and cultured in DMEM medium (Invitrogen, CA) with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial (HUVEC) cells were purchased from PromCell (PromoCell GmbH, Sickingenstrafie 63/65, D-69126 Heidelberg, Germany) and cultured in Endothelial Cell Growth Medium (Ready-to-use, Promcell). Cells were used for in vitro and in vivo experiments when they reached -75% confluence. All animal experiments were performed in compliance with the Guidelines for the Care and Use of Research Animals established by the Methodist Hospital Research Institute Animal Use Committee. Five-week-old female nude mice were purchased from Harlan (Indianapolis, ΓΝ). The U87MG xenograft model was generated by subcutaneous injection of 5 x 106 cells (suspended in 100 of PBS) into the left flank of mice. Three to four weeks after inoculation (tumor volume, 200-500 mm3), the mice were used for PET imaging and biodistribution study. Western Blot Western blot was performed to determine the VEGFR2 expression using anti-VEGF- R2/Flk-1 antibody and anti-Vinculin antibody was used as the loading control. U87MG, MDA- MB-231, Hela, and HUVEC Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS (pH 7.4) and then lysed in the lysis buffer (Cell Signaling Technology) containing 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% NP-40, 5% glycerol supplemented with complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Scientific) on ice for 30 min. The lysates were centrifuged for 15 min at 4 °C and then the protein concentration was quantified using Pierce BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific). The cell lysates (50 μg) were heated at 100 °C for 10 min in sample loading buffer (Thermo Scientific) and separated by SDS-PAGE (Thermo Scientific, Pierce). Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF, Bio-Rad). The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk for 1 hr, probed with primary antibodies at 4 °C overnight and incubated with secondary antibody (GE Healthcare). Immunoreactive bands were visualized with a chemiluminescence detection system (Thermo Scientific, Pierce). Cell uptake and blocking assay The 64Cu-DOTA-ZD-G2 cell uptake assay was performed using U87MG, MDA-MB- 231, Hela and HUVEC cells that express different numbers of VEGF receptors as demonstrated in western blot result (Figure 2A). The day before the experiment, cells were seeded in 24 wells plate at concentration of 2 x 105 cells per mL. 37 KBq (1 μθ) 64Cu-DOTA-ZD-G2 was added to each well and incubated at 4 °C for lh. The cells were washed with ice-cooled PBS for three times, trypsinized and the cell-associated radioactivity was measured using a γ counter (Perkin- Elmer Packard, CT). The cell uptake and blocking assay of ^Cu-DOTA-ZD-Gl and 64Cu- DOTA-ZD-G2 was performed using U87 cells following the procedure described above. Briefly, KBq radiotracer 64Cu-DOTA-ZD-Gl or 64Cu-DOTA-ZD-G2 in 200 DMEM medium (non- FBS) were added to each well without or with 50-fold excess amount of nonradioactive ZD-G1 or ZD-G2 respectively. After incubating at 4 °C for lh, the cells were washed with ice-cooled PBS and trypsinized. The cell-associated radioactivity was measured using γ-counter (Perkin- Elmer Packard, CT). As shown in Figure 2A, HUVEC cells have high VEGFR2 expression, U87 cells have moderate VEGFR2 expression and MDA-MB-231 and Hela cells have low VEGFR2 expression. The radiotracer uptake level (Figure 2B) shows uptake in HUVEC > U87 > Hela and MDA- MB-23 lcells, which is consistent with the western blot result. A comparison of ^Cu-DOTA-ZD- Gl and 64Cu-DOTA-ZD-G2 uptake using U87 cells is shown in Figure 2C. The uptake of 64Cu- DOTA-ZD-G2 is 8 times more than 64Cu-DOTA-ZD-Gl . Uptake of both 64Cu-DOTA-ZD-G2 and 64Cu-DOTA-ZD-Glcan be effective blocked by co-incubation with non-radioactive ZD-G2 and ZDG1, respectively. Cell VEGFR2 receptor-binding assay VEGFR binding affinity and specificity of the 64Cu-DOTA-ZD-Gl or 64Cu-DOTA- ZDG2 were evaluated by saturation and displacement assays using U87 cells. Cells were seeded in 12 well plates at concentration of 5 x lO5 cells per well the day before the experiment. For the receptor saturation analysis, the cells were incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with increasing concentration of 64Cu-DOTA-ZD-Gl or 64Cu-DOTA-ZD-G2 respectively. The cells were then washed with cold PBS and trypsinized. The cell-associated radioactivity was measured using γ- counter (Perkin-Elmer, CT) and the Kd values were calculated by fitting the data by nonlinear regression using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, CA). For the displacement/competition assay, cells were incubated with 64Cu-DOTA-ZD-Gl or 64Cu-DOTA-ZD-G2 and increasing concentration of non-radioactive ZD-Gl or ZD-G2 respectively. The experiment procedures are similar with those used for the saturation study described above. All experiments were carried out with triplicate samples. The binding assay of the 64Cu-DOTA-ZD-Gl and 64Cu-DOTA-ZD-G2 to U87 cells yielded a mean equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) value of 44.7 nM and 0.45 nM respectively. This is an indication that 64Cu-DOTA-ZD-G2 had 100-fold higher VEGFR2 avidity than 64Cu-DOTA-ZD-Gl. The representative saturation curves of specifically bound 64Cu-DOTA-ZD-Gl and 64Cu-DOTA-ZD-G2 are shown in Figures 3A and 3B. Competition for binding between 64Cu-DOTA-ZD-G2 and non-radioactive ZD-G2 demonstrate that 64Cu- DOTA-ZD-G2 can be displaced by increasing amounts of unlabeled molecules (Figure 3C). This provides evidence for receptor-mediated binding to VEGFR2-expressing cells. The similar competition result was also shown for the ^Cu-DOTA-ZD-Gl . This experiment also demonstrated the 50% inhibitory concentration (ICso) values for ZD-Gl and ZD-G2 were 17.63±1.2 nM and 0.023±0.002 nM respectively. MicroPET imaging MicroPET/CT scans and image analysis were performed using a Siemens Inveon platform. Approximately 3.7 mBq ^Cu-DOTA-ZD-Gl or 64Cu-DOTA-ZD-G2 (100 μϋϊ) was injected intravenously either without or with non-radioactive ZD-Gl or ZD-G2 (50 nmol, 60 μg/mouse) through a tail vein. Static PET scans were acquired at 2, 6 h, and 24 h post injection and standard CT scans were acquired in between the PET sessions. The images obtained were reconstructed using a two dimensional ordered-subsets expectation maximum (OSEM) algorithm and fused with the CT images with the Inveon Research Workplace (IRW). For each PET scan, regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn over the tumor and major organs on decay -corrected whole-body coronal images. The radioactivity concentration (accumulation) within tumor or organs was obtained from mean pixel values within the ROI volume and was converted to counts per milliliter per minute. Assuming a tissue density of 1 g/mL, the counts per milliliter per minute was converted to counts per gram per minute and then divided by the injected dose (ID) to obtain an imaging ROI derived percentage of the injected radioactive dose per gram of tissue (%ID/g). Multiple time point static microPET scans of ^Cu-DOTA-ZD-Gl and 64Cu-DOTA- ZDG2 were performed respectively using U87MG tumor bearing mice (n=3 per group). Representative decay-corrected coronal images at 2 h, 6 h and 24 h post injection are shown in Figure 4. From the PET images, both radiotracers showed tumor accumulation as early as 2h post injection. 64Cu-DOTA-ZD-G2 showed much higher tumor uptake than ^Cu-DOTA-ZD-Gl at all time points examined. From the ROI analysis as shown in Figure 6A, tumor tissues uptake reached 2.67 ± 0.08 %ID/g at 2 h, 3.70 ± 0.36 %ID/g at 6 h, and 3.84 ± 0.05 %ID/g at 24 h post injection of 64Cu-DOTA-ZD-G2 and 0.29 ± 0.09 %ID/g at 2 h, 0.65 ± 0.03 %ID/g at 6 h, and 0.50 ± 0.10 %ID/g at 24 h post injection of 64Cu-DOTAZD-Gl, resulting in more than 5 times higher tumor uptake. 64Cu-DOTA-ZD-G2 had high tumor to muscle uptake ratios as shown in Figure 6B. 64Cu-DOTA-ZD-G2 exhibited high liver uptake at early time points with very low distribution in kidney and other tissues (Figures 6C and D). At 24h post injection, liver uptake is decreased to 4.11 ± 1.37 %ID/g which is close to tumor uptake at 3.84 ± 0.05 %ID/g. To test the in vivo VEGFR specificity, blocking experiments were performed by co-injection of 50 nmol (60 μg/mouse) non-radioactive ZD-G2 with 64Cu-DOTA-ZD-G2. The tumor uptake was effectively reduced as shown in the PET images (Figure 5) and the reduced tumor uptake values were 0.57 ± 0.02 %ID/g at 2 h, 0.65 ± 0.08 %ID/g at 6 h, and 0.98 ± 0.23 %ID/g at 24 h post injection, respectively (Figure 6A). MicroPET result suggests that the bivalent radiotracer has increased binding to VEGFR and great improvement of in vivo tumor uptake. Biodistribution study After the microPET/CT scans at 24 h after injection, the mice were immediately sacrificed to evaluate the distribution of the radiotracers in vivo. Blood, tumor, heart, lungs, liver, spleen, kidneys and muscle were collected and wet weighed. The radioactivity in each tissue was measured using a gamma counter (PerkinElmer, MA). Data are expressed as percent injected dose per gram of tissue (%ID/g). Blocking experiment was performed by coinjection of radiotracer with non-radioactive ZD-G1 or ZD-G2 (50nmol, 60 μg/mouse). Because of the size effect and higher hydrophobic, uptake of 64Cu-DOTA-ZD-G2 was slightly higher than that of 64Cu-DOTA-ZD-Gl in most organs (Figure 7). The tumor uptake of 64Cu-DOTA-ZD-G2 (3.59% ± 0.34 %ID/g, n=3) is 4 times higher than that of ^Cu-DOTA-ZD- Gl (1.17± 0.12 %ID/g, n=3). The blocking study was performed as 64Cu-DOTA-ZD-G2 co- injected with 50 nmol of nonradioactive ZD-G2 and tumor uptake is decreased to 0.91 ± 0.01 %ID/g, which is 3 times lower compared with non-blocking mice, (p < 0.0001) The excess amount of ZD-G2 successfully reduced the uptake of 64Cu-DOTA-ZD-G2 in the U87MG tumor, while the radioactivity in the kidney and all other dissected tissues was very close between with or without block compound except for liver. The uptake of 64Cu-DOTA-ZD-Gl in liver was 0.36 %ID/g, n=3), whereas uptake was almost higher for 64Cu-DOTA-ZD-G2 (3.02 ± 0.10 %ID/g, n=3). This blocking effect confirms the VEGFR-binding specificity of the developed radiotracer 64Cu-DOTA-ZD-G2. The result obtained from biodistribution studies were consistent with the quantitative analysis of microPET imaging, which suggested that ROI analysis of noninvasive microPET scans was a true reflection of the biodistribution of 64Cu-DOTA-ZD-G2 in vivo. Results Summary 64Cu labeled bivalent ZD-G2 conjugates and 64Cu-DOTA-ZD-G2 as a PET imaging probe for tumor VEGFR2 imaging based on clinical approved antiangiogenic drug ZD6474 (ZD- Gl) were developed. The 64Cu-DOTA-ZD-G2 showed high VEGFR binding affinity and specificity as determined by in vitro cell assay and uptake/blocking assay, cell-saturation and competing assay. The binding affinity and specificity of this developed tracer was also confirmed in vivo by quantitative small-animal PET experiments and biodistribution studies. Bivalent VEGFR2 targeting imaging probe from ZD6474 using triethanolamine backbone linker was developed. The linker length and rigidity can affect the multivalent ligand receptor interaction. In addition, the linkers used should have good physicochemical properties such as high stability and low toxicity. Triethanolamine is a suitable as a linker. Both of C-0 and C-N bonds are flexible, which can spin freely to change the angle between two parent compounds, which gives them more possibility to interact with the targeting receptor "pocket". At same time, N and O atoms in the linker structure can increase the water solubility of the bivalent complex. Additionally, triethanolamine has three arms in which two side chains have been used to build up bivalent structure, and the third arm can be used to conjugate with radiolabels for PET. Overall, the bivalent design with suitable length between linked two monomers, adjustable angle and proper hydrophilic greatly enhance the binding of bivalent compound comparing to its parent monomer. Several in vitro assays to examine the interaction between 64Cu-DOTA-ZD-G2 and VEGFR2 were used. First, the cell uptake in four cell lines that express different level of VEGFR2 was tested. The cell uptake of 64Cu-DOTA-ZD-G2 was proportional to the VEGF receptor quantity in different cell lines (Figure 2A and B). 64Cu-DOTA-ZD-G2 had high uptake in U87 cells than ^Cu-DOTA-ZD-Gl and the decreased uptake of radiotracers in blocking study further proved the receptor-ligand specific interaction (Figure 2C). Binding studies to U87 cells revealed a Kd of 0.45 nM for 64Cu-DOTA-ZD-G2 and 44.7 nM for "Cu-DOTA-ZD-Gl, demonstrating a 100 time higher binding affinity for the developed bivalent compounds. Cell competition assay also proved the specific receptor-ligand binding of the radiotracers. Considering the half-life of 64Cu(12.7 h), the PET imaging of 64Cu-DOTA-ZD-G2 and 64Cu-DOTA-ZD-Gl were acquired in 2 h, 6 h, and 24 h post injection (Figure 4). Quantification of small animal PET images showed that 64Cu-DOTA-ZD-G2 had 5 times higher tumor uptake than that of ^Cu-DOTA-ZD-Gl (Figure 6A). 64Cu-DOTAZD-G2 had clearly high tumor uptake at all time points and long tumor retention. The higher tumor uptake of 64Cu-DOTA-ZD-G2 can be attributed to higher VEGFR binding affinity, longer circulation time and slower tumor washout, compared with 64Cu-DOTAZD- Gl. In addition, quantification of tumor-to-muscle ratio also showed the analogous result (Figure 6B). 64Cu-DOTA-ZD-G2 have low kidney uptake at all time points, which is an advantage than reported radiolabeled VEGFR antibodies that usually have high kidney accumulation. The liver uptake of 64Cu-DOTA-ZD-G2 was high at 2h post injection (15.3 % ID/g) but was clear up quickly (4.1 %ID/g at 24h p.i.), which is favorable in PET imaging. The tumor uptake of 64Cu-DOTA-ZD-G2 could be effectively blocked by co- injection with non-radioactive ZD-G2, proving the in vivo ligand-tumor specific binding. Example 2 ZD6474 (Vandetanib) Dimer Synthesis, FAM-Conjugated Monomer-ZD6474, and Dimer- ZD6474 Conjugate Synthesis Dimeric ligand ZD6474 was synthesized in three steps (Figure 8). To the solution of compound 1, 2-(((9H-fluoren-9-yl)methoxy) carbonylamino)octanedioic acid (1 10 mg, 0.26 mmol) in EtOAc (20 mL), DCC (1 10 mg, 0.53 mmol), and N-hydroxysuccinimide (62 mg, 0.53 mmol) were added at 0 °C. The mixture was stirred at 0 °C for 8 h (detected by TLC). The reaction mixture was filtrated to remove white solid and the solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure to get the crude intermediate 2. Compound 2 was dissolved in DCM (20 mL) for next step reaction without further purification. ZD6474, compound 3 (270 mg, 0.53 mmol), and DIPEA (0.2 mL) was added to the previous DCM solution of compound 2. The reaction mixture was stirred at ambient temperature for 24 h and the solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure. Ten mL 10% piperidine DCM solution was added and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 2 h. The purification of the crude product was carried out on a semipreparative reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system (Agilent 1200 series). Purification was performed on a Phenomenex Luna CI 8 (2) column 100R (250 * 10.00 mm). The flow was 4 mL/minute, with the mobile phase starting from 70% solvent A (0.05% TFA in water) and 30% solvent B (acetonenitile) to 50% solvent A and 50% solvent B at 20 min. Compound 4 was collected, lyophilized, and stored in the dark at -20 °C until use. 1H NMR (600 MHz, DMSO): 11.0 (s, active H), 8.74 (m, 2H), 8.14 (d, 2H), 8.02 (m, 2H), 7.77 (m, 2H), 7.56 (m, 4H), 7.38 (t, 2H), 4.04 (m, 10H), 3.60 (m, 1H), 3.21 (4H), 3.15 (m, 2H), 2.75 (m, 2H), 2.35 (m, 2H), 1.84 (m, 4H), 1.65 (m, 2H), 1.43 (m, 2H), 1.18 (m, 10H). MS (electrospray): m/z 1076.6 (100, [M+H]+, calcd 1075.8). To a mixture of compound 3 (25 mg, 50 μιηοΐ), 6-carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (FAM, 28 mg, 60 μιηοΐ) in 3 mL DCM, 100 μϊ^ triethyl amine was slowly added. After stirring overnight in the dark at ambient temperature, the reaction was quenched by adding 200 μϊ^ of TFA. The purification of the crude product 5 was carried out on a HPLC system (Agilent 1200 series). Purification was performed on a Phenomenex Luna CI 8(2) column 100R (250 * 10 mm). The flow was 4 mL/minute, with the mobile phase starting from 70% solvent A (0.05 M ammonia acetate in water) and 30% solvent B (acetonenitile) to 40% solvent A and 60% solvent B at 20 min. Compound 5 was collected, lyophilized, and stored in the dark at -20 °C until use. MS (electrospray): m/z 819.2 (100, [M+H]+, calcd 818.1). Compound 6 was prepared in the similar procedure described above and purified by HPLC. Compound 6 MS (electrospray): m/z 1434.1 (100, [M+H]+, calcd 1433.3). The absorption and fluorescence emission characteristics of compound 5 and 6 were identical to those of free FAM, as apparent from spectra measured in H20. In Vitro Cellular Uptake VEGFR-2 expression was established in three cell lines, MDA-MB-231 (human breast cancer cell line), U-87-MG (human glioblastoma brain cancer cell line), and HUVEC (human umbilical vascular endothelial cells). The cell lysate was separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were probed with rabbit polyclonal antiphospho-VEGFR2 antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA) followed by a goat antirabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody; immunoreactive proteins were detected and visualized by chemiluminescence (ECL kit; Pierce, Rockford, IL). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and the phosphorylated proteins were probed with VEGFR-2 and antiphospho-VEGFR2. β-actin was used as a loading control. Each of the FAM-conjugated compounds was incubated with MDA-MB-231 cells seeded 24 h earlier in a 96 well plate with 1% serum medium. Serial dilutions of the compounds were incubated for 3 h. The treated medium was then exchanged for fresh serum free medium. The remaining compound was then quantified from images taken using a Xenogen IVIS-200 (PerkinElmer, Inc. San Jose, CA) fluorescent imaging system. The same was done with HUVEC. Blocking Assay Specific binding of ZD6474-monomer and dimer were tested with blocking studies. Unlabeled ZD6474- monomer and ZD6474-dimer were mixed with the corresponding FAM- conjugated compounds simultaneously for 3 h. Plates were then imaged using the Xenogen IVIS-200 system. Similarly treated cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and imaged under fluorescent microscopy after staining the nuclei with DAPI. Assay of in Vitro Cell Viability MDA-MB-231 and U-87-MG cell lines were cultured in DMEM medium (Gibco, Grand Island, NY) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. HCT 1 16 (human, colorectal carcinoma cell line) was grown in McCoy's 5a medium modified with 10% FBS. HUVECs (Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial cells) were grown in EGM medium (Lonza), supplemented with 20% FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 μg/mL streptomycin at 37 °C under a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% O2 with same condition as above. For the cell viability assay, the cells were then seeded into 96-well flat-bottomed tissue-culture plates at 1 x 104 cells/well and incubated for 24 or 72 h in humidified atmosphere of 5% (v/v) CO2 at 37 °C in the presence of each compound. For HUVECs, the flat-bottomed 96-well plate (Corning, NY, USA) was coated 1 h at 37 °C with gelatin (0.3% in PBS, pH 7.4) and then washed with PBS. The cells were then treated with ZD6474 monomer and its dimer compounds in the range from 5 nM to 100 μΜ concentration mixed with 1% FBS added culture medium (HUVECs was 2% FBS added). Following 24 and 72 h of incubation under 5% CO2 at 37 °C, the cells were washed with PBS and cell viability was assessed by MTT colorimetric assay. The absorbance of individual wells was measured by using an automated microplate reader (570 nm; VERSAmax, Molecular Devices Corp., Sunnyvale, CA). The data are expressed as the percentage of viable cells compared to the survival of a control group and were presented as mean ± s.e. (n = 6). In Vitro Tubular Formation and in Vivo Angiogenesis Assessment Using the Matrigel Plug Assay Growth factor reduced Matrigel (100 μί, BD Bioscience, San Jose, CA, USA) was added to each well of a 96-well plate and allowed to polymerize for 30 min at 37 °C. HUVECs were suspended in the medium at the density of 4 x 105 cells per milliliter, and 0.1 mL of the cell suspension was added to each well coated with Matrigel in the presence of ZD6474 monomer or ZD6474 dimer. Cells were incubated at 37 °C for 6 h, and then photographed. The branch points were counted and averaged. The matrigel plug assays were performed injecting 637 μΐ^ of growth factor reduced liquid Matrigel-PBS mixture was into subcutaneously into the flanks of nu/nu nude mice at 4 °C. Once inside the animals, the liquid Matrigel-PBS mixture solidifies. For comparison, Matrigel alone as well as Matrigel containing VEGF 165 (Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ) at a final concentration of 500 ng/niL to stimulate angiogenesis, and Matrigel with VEGF165 along with either ZD6474 monomer, ZD6474 dimer at a final concentration of 100 μΜ were used. All of the injection groups consisted of three mice. After 10 days, the mice were sacrificed and the Matrigel plugs were removed, fixed in 4% formalin and photographed. In Vivo Animal Model and ex Vivo Tumor Accumulation and Biodistribution Imaging Study The subcutaneous dorsa of five nu/nu female mice (6 weeks old; 20 g) were inoculated bilaterally with 1 x 107 U87-MG human glioblastoma cells overexpressing the VEGF receptor. Once the tumor diameter was approximately 7-8 mm at 21 days post implant, the mice were divided into three groups for the following injections: (a) free FAM (n = 1), (b) FAM-labeled ZD6474-monomer (50 μΜ; n = 2), and (c) FAM-labeled ZD6474-dimer (50 μΜ, n = 2). The animals were manually restrained during intravenous tail injection. All tail vein injections were carried out with a 31 gauge needle placed in a lateral tail vein to inject 100 μϊ^ of solution. Twenty-four hours post injection, fluorescence images were acquired using a one second exposure time. The tumors and major organs were dissected and imaged again. Control (free FAM) and targeted (FAM labeled monomer and dimer) ex vivo tumor and organ tissue were imaged in parallel under fixed settings. In vivo fluorescence imaging was performed using the Xenogen IVIS 200 imaging system. To better observe the signal without losses and background due to intervening tissue, fluorescence images were collected ex vivo. Raw counts for each organ were measured using the Xenogen software by drawing oval regions of interest (ROI) around the organ of interest. The results were given as received photon flux per unit time in each of these ROIs, normalized by the incident light intensity. An estimate of the percentage of injected dose accumulated in the tumors was established by comparing measured counts/volume of tissue with the measured counts/volume of a known concentration of the same compound in water at the same exposure. A dilution low enough to avoid quenching was used and the results were linearly extrapolated to produce a conservative estimate of the compound concentration in the tissue. From there, the total amount of compound can be estimated and compared to the injected dose. Statistics The statistical significance of differences between interesting pairs of observations were determined using a twotailed Student's t test. A two parameter linear model was applied to the tubular networks data considering interaction of compound and dose. Statistical significance was considered to be present at P values <0.05. Results Cellular Uptake of FAM-Labeled ZD6474 Monomer and Dimer on MDA-MB-231 and HUVECS Based on in vitro assays, there appears to be minimal difference in uptake between monomer and dimer in the two cell lines, MDA-MB-231 and HUVECs (maximum P = 0.09 for 100 nM dose; Figures 9A-9B). There was overall higher uptake of dimer-FAM by HUVECs rather than MDA-MB-231 cells (P < 10-1 1 at 100 nM dose, Figures 9C-9D), although from 1 μΜ to 10 Mm concentration, the signal was almost the same for both cell lines (Figure 9C). Figure 9E shows comparative expression of VEGFR-2 in the three cell lines used in the studies, U-87 glioblastoma, MDA-MB-231, and HUVECs. U-87 shows higher expression compared to the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line, with even more expression in the HUVEC cell line. In Vitro Blocking of VEGF Receptor on HUVECs Using 6-FAM Labeled ZD6474-Dimer Results of the receptor blocking studies are shown in Figure 10. A decrease in signal intensity due to receptor saturation by addition of excess (100x dose) of unlabeled compound, both monomer and dimer, is shown in Figure 10B and quantified in Figures 10A and IOC. Figure 10A shows almost 90% loss of dimer-FAM signal when mixed with unlabeled dimer (P < 10-6 for 10 μΜ dose). This is nearly identical to the signal from nonspecific binding of FAM. Figure IOC directly compares the blocking of monomer and dimer, with the dimer showing much stronger blocking and specificity. The mean signal from blocked monomer-FAM is over 10x greater than the same from dimer FAM (P < 10-7 for 10 μΜ dose). The intracellular distribution of the FAM-labeled dimer is shown in Figure 11, with and without blocking via cold dimer. In Vitro Cytotoxicity of Monomer and Dimer The cytotoxicity of ZD6474-monomer and ZD6474-dimer on cultured MDA-MB-231 (human breast cancer), HCT-116 (human colon cancer), U-87-MG (human brain glioblastoma), and HUVECS (human endothelial cells) are shown in Figure 12. Both drugs showed low toxicity to the cancer cells for a wide range of concentrations in the experimental range from 5 nM to 50 μΜ. Even at 100 μΜ, around 50% of cells treated with the monomer or dimer remained viable for the cancer cell lines (Figures 12A-12C). In HUVECs, however, both monomer and dimer began to affect cell viability starting at the 500 nM concentration. From this dose and upward, endothelial cells are dying (Figure 12D). Inhibitory Effect of ZD6474 Derivatives on Angiogenesis in Vitro and in Vivo Cell alignments and tubular structure formations were observed in control wells of HUVECs. Cells treated with ZD6474 derivatives showed inhibitory effects (Figure 13A). ZD6474-monomer exhibited greater inhibitory effect against cell alignment and tubular structure formation than ZD6474-dimer (P = 0.005). Both monomer and dimer demonstrated a strong dose-dependent inhibition of tube formation (P < 10-4), with the dose effect somewhat stronger in the monomer (P = 0.05). The number of tube branches was reduced from 100% in the control group to 52.0 ± 4.8% (ZD6474-monomer, 10 μΜ) and 75 ± 5.2% (ZD6474-dimer, 10 μΜ), respectively (Figure 13B). As the incubation period continued to 6 h, HUVECs treated with both ZD6474 derivatives gradually lost intercellular contact. Figure 13C showed the in vivo effect on of the compounds on angiogenesis determined by the matrigel plug assay. The plugs treated with VEGF165 alone were dark red in color, indicating the formation of new blood vessels and existing red blood cells in circulation. Negative controls showed no such color. Plugs mixed with ZD6474-monomer were paler in color than the positive controls but not entirely clear, implying significant inhibition of blood vessel development within the matrigel. On the other hand, plugs treated with ZD6474-dimer and VEGF165 were almost the same as the PBS treated negative control group. These results show that ZD6474-dimer was more effective in preventing microvessel formation of VEGF 165- induced angiogenesis than ZD6474-monomer in vivo. Ex Vivo Imaging of VEGF Overexpression in Xenograft U-87 Tumor After the i.v. injection of 6-FAM-labeled ZD6474 derivatives in mice carrying subcutaneous xenografts of U-87 glioblastoma, the fluorescence intensity immediately increased in the whole body, due to the rapid circulation of 6-FAMlabeled ZD6474 derivatives. However, the MR fluorescence signal in the whole body decreased as the time elapsed. The 6-FAMlabeled ZD6474-dimer displayed stronger fluorescence signals than ZD6474-monomer in the tumor regions compared to whole body. Ex vivo images at the 24 h time point following i.v. injection showed about 20x greater fluorescent intensity coming from the ZD6474-dimer group tumors than from tumors in other groups and from organs (Figure 14A-A4B). Tumor uptake of FAM dye, monomer-FAM, and dimer-FAM (Figure 14C), when compared with images of known dye concentrations, demonstrated that at least 6% of the total injected dose of the dimer- FAM ended up in the tumors compared to less than 0.25% of both FAM and monomer-FAM (Figure 14D). Despite the low sample numbers, the difference is highly significant, with P < 0.001 using a two-sided t test. VEGFR Cell receptor-binding assay VEGFR binding affinity and specificity of the ZD-G1, ZD-G2 and ZD-G3 were evaluated by competition assays using U-87 MG cells. Cells were seeded in 12-well plates at a density about 5 x 105 cells per well the day before the experiment. For the displacement/competition assay, non-radioactive ZD-G1, ZD-G2 and ZD-G3 were dissolved in FBS-free DMEM medium, and serially diluted in gradient concentration. The HPLC purified radio-tracer was re-dissolved in FBS-free DMEM medium and diluted to 1 uCi/lOOuL. The U-87 MG cells were incubated with 1 uCi 64Cu-DOTA-ZD-G2 per well and co-incubation with serial concentration of non-radioactive ZD-G1, ZD-G2 and ZD-G3 respectively. After incubation at 4° C for 1 hour, the supernatant with free radio tracer was removed carefully and the cells were then washed with cold PBS for three times and trypsinized. The cells were collected and cell pellet associated radioactivity was measured and the binding affinity values (ICso) were calculated by nonlinear regression using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, CA). All experiments were carried out in triplicate. The binding assay of the ZD-G1, ZD-G2 and ZD-G3 to U-87 MG cells yielded a ICso value of 17.6, 0.026 and 0.084 nM, respectively. The results are shown in Figure 15. In vivo antitumor efficacy of multivalent IAs (Fig. 16) All animal procedures were approved by the Methodist Hospital Research Institute Animal Care and Use Committee. The therapeutic test for antitumor efficacy of ZD compounds was evaluated using tumor-bearing mice which were prepared by subcutaneous injection in the thighs of nu/nu female mice (6 weeks old; 20-25 g). The mouse glioblastoma cancer cell line U87 was obtained from Caliper and tested negative for rodent pathogens. The mice were inoculated with suspensions of 1 x 106 U87 cells in 100 μΐ complete medium (10 % FBS added). About 10 days after subcutaneous inoculation (the tumor diameter was approximately 3-5 mm, the tumor volume was approximately 50 to 100 mm3), tumor-bearing mice (n=6 per group) were injected intravenously (i.v.) with each ZD compounds (monomer ZD-G1, dimer ZD-G2, trimer ZD-G3) at 20 mg/kg per injection three times per week resulting in equivalent pharmacophore. The tumor size was calculated as a x b2 / 2, where 'a' is the largest and 'b' the smallest diameter.
