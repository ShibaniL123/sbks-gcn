TECHNICAL FIELD Embodiments of the present invention relate to medical imaging devices, and in particular, to X-ray equipment. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION In order to be adaptive to different filming positions, a cross arm 101 of a medical X-ray equipment is designed to rotate about a center shaft, i.e., to rotate on a plane that is vertical to the floor where the X-ray equipment is located. The most frequently used filming positions are chest position and decubitus position. When the chest position is to be taken, the cross arm 101 is at a horizontal position, and a tube 103 needs to be moved along a guide 102 on the cross arm to the farthest end, i.e., the distance from the tube 103 to a detector 104 (SID) is adjusted to maximum; when the decubitus position is to be taken, the cross arm is at a vertical position, the tube 103 needs to be moved along the guide 102 on the cross arm to the nearest end, i.e., the distance from the tube 103 to the detector 104 (SID) is adjusted to minimum, as shown in FIGS. 1A and 1B. As for an existing manually-operated cross arm, a doctor needs to complete the above operation via the following two steps: first move a tube, adjust SID, and then rotate a cross arm. If the cross arm is rotated from a horizontal position to a vertical position first of all, SID cannot be adjusted for the reason that the position of the tube is too high. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Embodiments of the present invention provide a novel cross arm of X-ray equipment and a corresponding X-ray equipment, so as to complete adjustment of SID while rotating the cross arm, thereby solving the problem that filming different positions in the prior art needs step-by-step operation.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Embodiments of the present invention are further described below with reference to the drawings and the embodiments. FIG. 2 is a schematic diagram of an overall structure of the cross arm of X-ray equipment as provided by an embodiment of the present invention. FIG. 2A shows the structure of the cross arm that is seen from the front, i.e., the direction of watching when an X-ray equipment operator conducts operation and control. FIG. 2B shows the structure of the cross arm that is seen from the rear, i.e., the direction opposite to the direction of watching when the X-ray equipment operator conducts operation and control, comprising a guide 102 provided on the cross arm, a tube 103 capable of moving along the guide 102 and a linkage device 201, In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, when the operator rotates the cross arm, i.e., rotates the cross arm on a plane that is vertical to the floor where the X-ray equipment is placed, the linkage device 201 can transmit the power of rotating to the tube 103, so as to enable the tube 103 to move along the guide 102. When the cross arm is rotating, the tube can move with the cross arm, thereby reducing operation steps and improving maneuverability and convenience of equipment. Moreover, adjustment of SID can be completed automatically without being towed by a motor, thereby reducing equipment's costs and improving market competitiveness. FIG. 3 shows the specific structure of the linkage device 201 in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, wherein FIG. 3A is a front view, i.e., a schematic diagram that is seen from the direction of watching when the X-ray operator conducts operation and control, FIG. 3B is a side view, and FIG. 3C is a rear view. In at least one embodiment, the linkage device 201 is wrapped the housing of the cross arm, so FIG. 3 omits the housing of the cross arm and the guide 102 thereon in order to clearly show the structure of the linkage device 201. As seen from FIG. 3, the linkage device 201 may comprises a rotary gear 301 for rotation of the cross arm, wherein the rotary gear is capable of rotating about a shaft that is fixed on a vertical post 100 of X-ray equipment relative to the cross arm. The linkage device 201 further comprises a brake 302, a braking gear 303 fixedly provided on a shaft core of the brake 302 and a driving sprocket 304 The linkage device 301 further comprises a clutch 306, a clutch sprocket 307 provided on a shaft core of the clutch and a tube towing wheel 308 fixedly provided on the shaft core of the clutch. In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, the linkage shaft 201 may further comprise a shaft 310 fixed on the cross arm, a SID brake 312 provided on the shaft and a sprocket 311 capable of rotating about the shaft 310, In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, the rotary gear 301 is engaged with the braking gear 303, the driving sprocket 304 and the clutch sprocket 307 are engaged with a driving chain 305 respectively, and the tube towing wheel 308 and the sprocket 311 are engaged with a tube towing chain 309 respectively. In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, when the clutch 306 is energized, a sucker in the clutch combines the clutch sprocket 307 and the clutch shaft core tightly via an armature. In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, when the clutch 306 is de-energized, the clutch sprocket 307 freely rotates about the clutch shaft core. When the clutch is de-energized, the sucker does not work. In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, when a user needs to rotate the cross arm and adjust SID, the user only needs to energize the brake 302 and the clutch 306, and then manually rotate the cross arm so as to make it rotate about the rotating shaft of the cross arm, thereby impelling the rotary gear 301 provided on the rotating shaft to rotate. In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, when the rotary gear 301 is engaged with the braking gear 303 and the brake 302 is in an energizing state, the braking gear 303 will also rotate, following the rotary gear 301, and impel the driving sprocket 304 to rotate together. In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, when the driving sprocket 304 is engaged with the driving chain 305, impelled by the driving sprocket 304, the driving chain 305 starts transmitting the power generated by rotation to the clutch sprocket 307 which is also engaged with it. In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, the clutch 306 can combine the clutch sprocket 307 and the clutch shaft core tightly when being energized; impelled by the driving chain 305, the clutch sprocket 307 will impel the clutch shaft core to rotate. In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, the tube towing wheel 308 is always fixed relative to the clutch shaft core; the tube towing wheel 308 will also be impelled by the clutch shaft core to rotate, thereby further impelling the tube towing chain 309 to move. In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, when the sprocket 311 is engaged with the tube towing chain 309, the sprocket 311 will also be impelled to rotate about the shaft 310. As shown in FIG. 3C, the tube towing chain 309 impels the tube 103 to move horizontally along the guide on the cross arm while moving horizontally along the cross arm. When the user rotates the cross arm to an appropriate position, the system will automatically de-energize the brake 302 and put the SID brake 312 in a braking state. In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, when the braking gear 303 cannot rotate, the rotary gear 301 cannot rotate either, the cross arm will be immovable, and the tube naturally has no power to move and can remain fixed. In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, if the user only wishes to rotate the cross arm while keeping SID unchanged, i.e., the tube is immovable, the system will only energize the brake 302 while de-energizing the clutch 306, and put the SID brake 312 in a braking state, so as to prevent the sprocket 311 from rotating. In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, when the brake 302 is energized, the cross arm can rotate normally, but when the clutch 306 is de-energized, the clutch sprocket 307 will freely rotate about the clutch shaft core, the power generated by rotation will be unable to be transmitted via the clutch shaft core to the tube towing wheel 308, and moreover, the sprocket 311 cannot rotate, and the tube will remain immovable. In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, during the actual application of the medical X-ray equipment, SID is generally adjusted from 1800 mm to 1000 mm, or adjusted from 1000 mm to 1800 mm, and the moving distance of the tube is fixed. Moreover, the cross arm may also comprise two modes of rotating from horizontal to vertical or from vertical to horizontal. Hence, as long as such mechanical parameters as diameters of the rotary gear 301, braking gear 303, driving sprocket 304, clutch sprocket 307 and tube towing wheel 308 are properly calculated when the linkage device is designed, it can be guaranteed that when the cross arm moves to the horizontal or vertical position, the tube exactly moves a required distance. According to an embodiment of the present invention, it the tube is to be enabled to move any distance, an encoder is needed to take participation, which encoder is used to measure an angle for which the tube towing wheel 308 has rotated, and to transmit the angle value to a control console. Since the rotating angle of the tube towing wheel 308 corresponds one by one to the moving distance of the tube, only according to the angle, the control console can judge whether the tube has moved to the position as preset by the user to which SID corresponds; if the preset position is reached, the control console will de-energize the clutch 306 and put the SID brake 312 in a breaking state, and the tube will remain immovable. According to an embodiment of the present invention, on the cross arm, each frequently used position point of the tube to which SID corresponds, is provided with a photoelectric sensor; when the tube moves to the position point as preset by the user via the control console to which SID corresponds, the photoelectric sensor at this position point will sends a signal to the control console, the control console will de-energize the clutch 306 and put the SID brake 312 in a braking state after receiving the signal, and the tube will remain immovable.
