INGENOL DERIVATIVES ON REACTIVATION OF LATENT HIV VIRUS The present invention generally relates to certain ingenol derivatives and their use as reactivators of latent HIV virus in viral reservoirs. In another aspect, the present invention relates to associations and compositions comprising said ingenol derivatives and anti-retroviral agents substantially active against actively replicating virus. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION It is known that the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the etiological agent responsible for AIDS - acquired immune deficiency syndrome, a fatal disease that is characterized by the destruction of the immune system, disabling the organism to react appropriately to life threatening opportunistic infections. Highly active anti-retroviral therapy (known as HAART) has been used to suppress HIV replication. It consists of the treatment commonly known as anti-AIDS "cocktail", with at least three active anti-retroviral compounds, containing reverse transcriptase inhibitors, integrase, protease and entry. However, in infected patients, the virus from reservoirs of CD4+ Τ lymphocyte cells latently infected (i.e. containing residual latent proviral DNA, integrated into the genome of host cells) quickly resumes the viral replication after cessation of the HAART treatment. Thus, HIV remains a chronic viral infection when such persistent latent infection is not fought. According to the current rationale in the art, the activation of latent viruses contained in such reservoirs, in the presence of anti-retroviral drugs, intends to make them detectable by the body immune system and accessible to active medication against the virus to cause destruction of cells expressing viral proteins, by reaction of the host immune system and/or such that the cells are brought to apoptosis, inhibiting the replication of viruses that come out from the reservoirs by action of the anti-retroviral drugs, thus exhausting the reservoir of KIV persistent infection and enabling the total eradication of the infection. In other words, the selective induction of latent infection allows anti-retroviral drugs and the antiviral immune response to access and eradicate residual HIV infection - i.e. not just temporarily stabilizing the immune system without later use of anti-retrovirals, but definitely suppressing the HIV infection in the human body. Description of the invention It is understood in the text below that mention to " antiretroviral agents active against viruses under active replication" relates to agents that do not substantially act, or act only in a limited way, on HIV viral reservoirs in the human body. The present invention relates, in a first aspect, to the use of one or more ingenol derivatives of formula I below: used in the preparation of product adjuvant in the treatment of HIV infection or AIDS treatment, wherein Ζ is Ζ1 Formula I O ii Ζ1= Η3℮-(℮Η2),-(℮η=℮η),-℮-ο- or Ζ2 0 II Ζ2= A-B-C-O- such that, when Ζ = Zl, ingenol derivatives of the invention are as depicted in the formula II below: χ and y are integers, χ varies between 2 and 10 and y varies between 2 and 7. Particularly for formula II, χ varies between 3 and 5 and y varies between 3 and 4. Particular embodiments of formula II can be cited, wherein χ = 3 and y = 4: (3-(2,4, 6-dodecatrienoyl)-ingenol) and wherein χ = 4 and y = 4 : In relation to formula I, when Z = Z2, ingenol derivatives of the invention are as depicted in the formula III below: wherein q is an integer ranging between 1 and 10, preferably between 2 and 6, and w is an integer ranging between 1 and 10, preferably between 8 and 10, provided that: when A is phenyl, Β is -CH=CH-; when A is CH3-, Β is [-CH2-]q; when A is CH2=CH-, Β is [-CH2-], Particular examples of ingenol derivatives of formula III suitable for the invention, in a non-exclusive manner, are structures A, B, C and D below: Particularly, formula I of ingenol derivatives of the invention presents the following conformation: According to the thrust of this invention, "adjuvant" is an agent or active principle whose action is concomitant or adjuvant to the action of another agent or active principle, in the treatment of a particular disease or condition.

Figures 3 to 6 are composite graphs which show the induction of HIV latency in Jlat 6.3 clone and the corresponding cytotoxicity, for both the KyoII derivative (where Ζ = Zl) and the A, Β and C derivatives (where Ζ = Ζ2) . Figures 7 and 8 are PCR (polymerase chain reaction)graphs for blood cells from patients treated exclusively with efavirenz (figure 7), and with a mixture of efavirenz and the ingenol Β derivative of the invention (figure 8). Figures 9 to 12 are flow cytometry readings, indicating down modulation of CD4 HIV-1 receptor on the surface of human and monkey lymphocytes, for the KyoII derivative (where Ζ = Zl) and for the A, Β and C ingenol derivatives (where Ζ = Ζ2). Examples Exemplary embodiments of the invention are given below, in a non-limited sense to such examples, since limitations of the invention are set forth only in the attached claims. Zl derivatives of ingenol of the invention Examples 1 and 2 relate to a 1:1 mixture of two ingenol derivatives of formula (I), when Ζ = Zl, which are 3-(2,4,6-dodecatrienoyl)-ingenol (χ = 3 and y = 4) and 3-(2, 4, 6, 8-tetradecatetranoyl)-ingenol (χ = 4 and y = 4), a mixture herein called KyoII, in dimethyl sulfoxide solution at a concentration of 2 0 mM. Such a solution is used to make dilutions in culture media to achieve the active concentration. Example 1 The test below was performed with cell line called J-lat, derived from Jurkat lineages, which works as an in vitro model of latent HIV-1. Similarly to resting CD4+ Τ cells infected with HIV-1 virus, J-Lat cells carry a complete genome of HIV-1 integrated into the cell genome regions that can be activated; however, the transcription of these regions is temporarily inhibited. Additionally, the latent provirus integrated in J-Lat cell lines encodes a GFP (green fluorescent protein) gene, thus providing a fluorescent reporter of HIV-1 transcriptional activity. These cells were treated with TNF-a (20 ng/ml) for viral re-activation as a positive control and the effect was compared with the mixture of ingenol Ζ1 derivatives. The expression of HIV viral genes was monitored by the GFP reporter gene during 48-72 hours after treatment with TNF-a through flow cytometry. Jlat clone cells 6.3 and 8.4 (provided by Dr. Β. Matija Peteriin, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA) were maintained in RPMI culture medium (Rosewell Park Memorial Institute - sold by Invitrogen, USA) containing 10% FES (fetal bovine serum) . The Jlat clone cells 6.3 and 3.4, in a concentration of 10° cells/mL, were induced with different concentrations of the derived KyoII for 24 hours and TNF-a was used as a positive control at 20 ng/mL concentration. After the induction step, the ceils were washed with RPMI medium and then re-suspended in RPMI medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and cultivated for more than 24 hours to obtain the induction of latent virus. After induction, 30,000 cells were read in a BD-Excalibur flow cytometer (Beckton Dickinson Company and Co., USA) for reading ceils expressing the GFP marker protein. A ceil sample was not induced and remained 48 hours in culture to serve as a simulated control (referred to as "mock"), thus marking the spontaneous induction of the provirus (background). The histogram of figures 1Α and IB shows that the KyoII sample, after a 24-hour induction, was able to activate the latent virus present in Jlat clones 6.3 and 8.4 in a dose-dependent manner, and even at very low doses (0.4 pm) it was able to induce up to 8℅ of Jlat clone cells 5.3 and 8.4 in culture, and at 40 pm concentration it induced almost 30% of the cells, thus overcoming the TNF-a potency. Figure 1c shows histograms presenting raw data obtained from the Ceiiquest software (Becton Dickinson and Company, USA) showing the latency induction in a Jlat 6.3 clone, following the same protocol cited above with 4 pm KyoII. In this case, 20 ng of TNF-a were used as positive control and the results are also shown as % of induced cells. Example 2 - Toxicity It is verified in this test that the derivatives in the KyoII mixture of example 1, at concentrations that induce latency in J-lat cells, are not cytotoxic to human PBMC cells. Thus, human PBMC cells at a concentration of 10° ceils/mL were cultured in RPMI medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, exposed to different concentrations of KyoII and left in culture for 72 hours. After exposure, the cells were stained with propidium iodide. Thus, the cells were centrifuged at 1000G for 3 minutes and washed with the same volume with 1 χ PBS (without Ca2" and Mg"", Cat No. 9240, Irvine Scientific Company, USA) containing 2% fetal bovine serum. PBS, or "Phosphate Buffered Saline" is saline buffered with phosphate. This wash was repeated 3 times and the cells were suspended in 1 X PBS containing 500 pg of propidium iodide and allowed to incubate for 5 min at 4 °C until being read by flow cytometry. After incubation, 30,000 cells were read in a BD-Excalibur flow cytometer. With this protocol it was possible to see the amount of cells with degraded DNA or in advanced stages of apoptosis (Figure 2) . It was possible to observe that, for concentrations up to 10 μΜ, the ingenol derivative is not cytotoxic to PBMCs cells and there was 100% of death at 100 μΜ. Example 3 - Cytotoxicity verification vs. reactivation This example aimed at correlating the cytotoxicity effects and HIV reactivation both for the KyoII mixture of ingenol derivatives, wherein Ζ = Ζ1 of examples 1 and 2 above, and for 3 ingenol derivatives of formula I, wherein Ζ = Ζ2, indicated above as A, Β and C. In these cases, a concentration of 10° cells/mL JLat 6.3 was induced with different concentrations of KyoII, A, Β, and C for 24 hours. After the induction step, the cells were washed with RPMI medium and re-suspended in RFMI medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and cultivated for another 24 hours for the induction of latent virus . After induction, 30,000 cells were read in a BD-Excalibur flow cytometer for reading cells expressing the GFP marker protein. A cell sample was not induced and remained 48 hours in culture to serve as a simulated control (referred to as "mock") , thus marking une spontaneous induction of the provirus (background). The suaining technique with propidium iodide was used for measuring the cytotoxicity of compounds. Thus, the cells were centrifuged at 1000G for 3 minutes and washed with the same volume with 1 χ PBS (without Ca2~ and Mg2*, Cat No. 9240, Irvine Scientific Company, USA) containing 2℅ fetal bovine serum. This washing was repeated 3 times and the cells were suspended in 1 χ PBS containing 500 pg propidium iodide and incubated for 5 min at 4 °C until being read by flow cytometry. After incubation, 30,000 cells were read in a BD-Excalibur flow cytometer (Beckton Dickinson and Co., USA) . With this protocol it was possible to precisely the amount of cells with degraded DNA or in advanced stages of apoptosis by measuring with precision cell viability (Figure 2). The results were plotted in a composed graph, which compared the induction ability of compounds versus their cytotoxic activity. Example 4 -- test with HIV+ human cells originated from patients under anti-retroviral treatment. It was tested, in this experiment, the ability of ingenol derivative, of formula I, wherein Ζ = Ζ2, mentioned as Β, of activating latent cells from patients who were already under anti-retroviral treatment for more than 1 year with undetectable viral load. A patient (identified as MLV) was selected, which had already been under treatment with zidovudine + lamivudine (ΑΖΤ + 3TC) and efavirenz for over 14 months, with undetectable viral load and CD4 > 500 cells/mm3. 20 mL of blood was collected from the patient in a EDTA (ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid)tube and PBMC cells were isolated, which were placed in RPMI culture medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 50 IU/mL of IL2 (interleukin 2) , and grown in 2 bottles with 5 mL of identical cells (106/mL) with different selective compositions. 10 μΜ efavirenz (antiviral) was added to the control bottle to block viral replication that would eventually arise from cultured cells. In another test bottle both efavirenz (10 μΜ) and the Β derivative of the invention (1 μΜ) were included. Both bottles were cultured at 31 °C for 72 h hours and then the intracellular RNA from the PBMCs was extracted with a RNEasy kit (QiaGen Company, USA) and the amount of HIV-1 genomic RNA was dosed by semi-nested real time PCR reaction using primers that hybridize with the gag region of the HIV-1 genome taking the non-spliced viral RNA GAG1 Sense I, II ('5' TCAGCCCAGAAGTAATACCCATGT 3'; genome position 1280-1303; ΤΜ = 58.3 °C) and SK431 antisense I (5' TGCTATGTCAGTTCCCCTTGGTTCTCT 3'; genome position 1474-1500; ΤΜ = 61.5 °C) as 10 rounds of PCR and followed by a semi-nested real time reaction with primers GAG1 Sense I, II (5' TCAGCCCAGAAGTAATACCCATGT3' ; genome position 1280-1303; ΤΜ = 58.3 °C) and antisense AG2 II (5' CACTGTGTTTAGCATGGTGTTT 3'; genome position 1341-1362 55.1 ΤΜ = 57 °C) and identified with GAG 3 probe (FAM-ATTATCAGAAGGAGCCACCCCACAAGA-TAMRA; genome position 1311-1337; ΤΜ = 61 3C) . The semi-nested PCR real-time reaction for detecting HIV-1 vRNA was carried out as follows: the extracted ceil RNA was diluted 10 times in water and treated with Dnase I (Invitrogen Corporation, USA) for 15 minutes to remove any trace of proviral DNA. Then, DNase I was inactivated under incubation at 70 °C for 10 min in the presence of 1 mM EDTA and 50 mM DTT (dithiothreitol) . Reverse transcription of RNA was conducted with random hexamer primers and Superscript III (brand enzyme for cDNA synthesis, from Invitrogen, USA) at 4 2 °C for 60 min. cDNA was then subjected to PCR reactions. The pair of primers used in the lar PCR round was GAG1 and SK4 31 that amplifies the gag inner region of HIV-1. This first round was run on a conventional PCR machine in a 25 μΤ volume with 5 pL of cDNA, 20 mM tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (pH 8.3), 50 mM KC1, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.4 mM DNTPs (deoxynucleotide triphosphates) and 1U Ampli-Taq (DNA polymerase, from Applied Biosystems, USA), and 50 ng of each primer. The PCR conditions were: 94 °C for 3 min, followed by 15 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 1 min. The product of this first PCR underwent a 2nd semi-nested real-time PCR, in a A3I Prism 7000 machine real-time PCR (from Applied Biosystems, USA) using a TaqMan reaction mixture in a total volume of 25 μ1, with 2 μ1 of the 1st round diluted 50 times with 0.2 pm of primers GAG1 and GAG2 , and 0.2 pm FAM GAG3 probe. The real-time PCR conditions were: 50 °C for 2 min and 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 50 cycles of 95 °C for 15 seconds and 60 °C for 1 min. The sizes of amplicons were 221 bp for the l3' round and 83 bp for (real-time) PCR. It can be observed in figure 7 that the PBMC cultures from MLV patient containing 10 μΜ efavirenz did not produce intracellular vRNA and, therefore, did not. generate detectable product in real time semi-nested PCR, On the other hand, in PBMC culture in which 10 pm efavirenz and 1 μΜ Β derivative Β of the invention were added - Figure 8 - the emergence of intracellular HIV-1 vRNA, a sign of HIV latent virus in these blood cells, is verified. Example 5 Downregulation of CD4 receptor on the surface of human CD4+ Τ lymphocytes and macrophages and pig-tail monkeys (Macaca nemestrina) . It is verified in this test that ingenol derivatives of formula 1, when Ζ = Ζ2, at concentrations that activate HIV from latency in Flat cells in example 3, downregulate the expression of CD4 cell receptor on the surface of HIV- human and SIV-pig-tail monkey CD4+ Τ lymphocytes and macrophages. For this experiment PBMC cells from human and monkeys were isolated from peripheral blood with isolation through Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient (mixture of high density hydrophilic neutral polysaccharides that readily dissolves in aqueous solution. "Ficoll" is a trademark of GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences, USA). Thus, PBMC cells from human and monkeys, at concentration of 10° cells/mL, were cultured in RPMI medium with 10% fetal bovine serum for 2 4 hours and adhered cells (monocytes differentiating into macrophages) were separated from the cell supernatant which contained total lymphocytes. Those two distinct populations of cells were exposed to different concentrations of A, Β and C derivatives of the invention, and left in culture for 72 hours. After exposure, the cells were stained with specific lymphocyte monoclonais (anti-CD3) and monocytes/macrophages (anti-CD14) simultaneously with an anti-CD4. Thus, the cells were centrifuged at 1000G for 3 minutes and washed with the same PBS volume (without Ca2" and Mg^ +, Cat. Nc. 9240, Irvine Scientific, USA) containing 2℅ fetal bovine serum. This wash was repeated 3 times and the cells were suspended in 1 χ PBS containing a 1/1000 dilution of relevant antibodies and left to incubate for 30 min at 4 °C until being read in flow cytometry. After incubation, 30,000 cells were read in a BD-Excalibur flow cytometer (from Beckton Dickinson and cc . , USA) and the populations were separated and the CD4 receptor density was estimated at different concentrations of the Β derivative, assuming cell density without Β derivative as 100℅. Molecules already known to downregulate CD4 were also placed in these experiments, for comparison purposes with A, Β and C derivatives, such as prostratin, bryostatin and ΡΜΑ (phorbol ester). It is noted that ingenol Ζ2 derivatives of the invention were able to downregulate the expression of CD4 HIV-1 receptor on the surface of human (Figure 11) and Macaca nemestrina lymphocytes (Figure 9). Similarly, these compounds also down regulated CD4 on human (Figure 12) and Macaca nemestrina (Figure 10) monocytes/macrophages. It was remarkable the greater power of Ζ2 ingenol derivatives in the downregulation of CD4 of monkey cells when compared with comparative molecules (prostratin, bryostatin and ΡΜΑ, see Figures 9 and 10). The A, Β and C ingenol derivatives were able to downregulate the main HIV receptor (CD4) on the surface of the infection targeted cells. Thus, it has been proven that the ingenol derivatives of the invention, besides of activating HIV from latency, hinder the ongoing of the virus infection by blocking its entry into new cells, The person skilled in the art can readily evaluate, by means of the teachings contained in rhe text and in the presented examples, advantages of the invention, as well as propose modifications and equivalent alternatives to the embodiments, without departing to the scope of the invention, as defined in the attached claims. 1, use of one or more ingenol derivatives of formula IFormula Iin the preparation of a product useful in the treatment of HIV virus infection or AIDS treatment, wherein Ζ is Ζ1 or Ζ2O21= H3C-(CH2),-(CH=CH)rC-0-0Ζ2= A-B-C-O-such that when Ζ = Ζ1χ and y are integers, χ varies between 2 and 10 and y varies between 2 and 7 ;and when Ζ = Ζ2,A is phenyl, CH3- or CH2=CH-,and (Β) is -CH=CH-, [-CH2-jq or [-CH2-]W,wherein q is an integer varying between 1 and 10, preferably between 2 and 6, and w is an integer varying between 1 and 10, preferably between 8 and 10,provided that:when A is phenyl, Β is -CH=CH-;when A is CH3-, Β is [-CH2-]~;when A is CH2=CH-, Β is [-CH2-]w 2.
