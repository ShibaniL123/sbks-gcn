This application claims priority to European application No. 12196997.6 filed on Dec. 13, 2012, the whole content of this application being incorporated herein by reference for all purposes. TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to non-aqueous fluoropolymer compositions useful for the preparation of polymeric materials. BACKGROUND ART Fluoropolymer compositions containing fluoropolymers which comprise ionisable groups are known from the prior art. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,498,457 (HITACHI) relates to a magnetic recording medium having a lubricant layer comprising ionically interbonded fluoropolyethers with acidic and basic terminal groups; preferably, each fluoropolyether has at least two acidic terminal groups or basic terminal groups in one molecule. According to a specific embodiment, the fluoropolyether containing acidic terminal groups complies with formula: [in-line-formulae]HO2C(CF2O)n(CF2CF2O)mCF2CO2H,[/in-line-formulae] wherein m and n are integers, while the perfluoropolyether containing basic terminal groups complies with formula: [in-line-formulae]H2NHCH2CHN(O)C(CF2O)n(CF2CF2O)mCF2C(O)NHCH2CH2NH2,[/in-line-formulae] where m and n are integers. U.S. Pat. No. 5,498,457 does not disclose or suggests polymer mixtures based on fluoropolyethers containing recurring fluoropolyether blocks and recurring cationic or anionic blocks wherein at least one of the cationic or anionic blocks is between two fluoropolyether blocks. WO 2010/000715 (SOLVAY SOLEXIS SPA) and WO 2008/138927 (SOLVAY SOLEXIS SPA) disclose compositions comprising at least a (per)fluoropolyether derivative which contains at least one fluorinated block and at least one urethane block of formula: [in-line-formulae]—OC(O)—NH—E—NH—C(O)O—[/in-line-formulae] wherein E is a divalent hydrocarbon group, optionally comprising one or more aromatic rings. The fluorinated block may contain at least one functional block comprising at least one ionisable group, like a sulfonic acid group, a carboxy group or an amino group. These documents do not disclose or suggest compositions comprising (per)fluoropolyether derivatives with opposite charges, i.e. at least one (per)fluoropolyether derivative comprising fluorinated blocks containing at least one ionisable anionic group and at least one (per)fluoropolyether derivative comprising fluorinated blocks containing at least one ionisable cationic group in a defined ratio of ionic equivalents. Furthermore, these documents do not teach or suggest using the compositions for preparing materials endowed with elastic and/or self-healing properties. WO 2007/102993 (3M INNOVATIVE PROPERTIES CO) relates to surface active block copolymers, their use in the manufacture of a foam composition and articles comprising the polymerised foam composition. The fluorinated block polymers comprise a (per)fluorinated block and may also contain functional blocks typically having one or more polar groups, such as carboxy, sulphonic or amino groups. Also this document does not specifically disclose or suggest compositions comprising block copolymers containing functional blocks having opposite charges in a defined ratio of ionic equivalents. WO 2010/028226 (ARROWSTAR LLC) discloses compositions for imparting water and oil repellency to fibers, the compositions comprising a fluorinated polyurethane having a plurality of ionisable groups. This document discloses in particular a mixture of a cationic fluorinated polyurethane, namely Fluorolink® 5032 polyurethane, and an anionic fluorinated polyurethane, namely Fluorolink® P56 polyurethane; the compositions further comprise an acrylic polymer and are in the liquid form. Example 2, in particular, discloses an aqueous composition containing 8.8% by weight Fluorolink® 5032 polyurethane and 30.0% by weight Fluorolink® P56 polyurethane. From the Applicant's calculations, it appears that the two polymers are not present in a stoichiometric equivalent ratio of ionic groups with opposite charges. Indeed, the equivalent weight of Fluorolink® 5032 polyurethane is 0.25 eq/kg and the equivalent weight of Fluorolink® P56 polyurethane is 0.49 eq/kg; accordingly, in the compositions of example 2, the equivalent ratio between Fluorolink® 5032 polyurethane and Fluorolink® P56 polyurethane is calculated to be 0.2, while the equivalent ratio between Fluorolink® P56 polyurethane and Fluorolink® 5032 polyurethane is calculated to be 6.7. This document does not teach or suggest replacing water in the preparation of the above compositions and it does not teach or suggest submitting the compositions to cross-linking in order to obtain self-healable and resistant compositions. WO 2011/131547 (SOLVAY SOLEXIS SPA) relates to an aqueous composition comprising at least one fluorinated polymer (F), at least one functional hydrogenated polymer (H) and at least one cross-linking agent and to the use of the composition as coating, varnish or paint, wherein the ratio of the polymer (F) to polymer (H) is higher than 0.75. Non aqueous compositions are neither mentioned nor suggested. U.S. Pat. No. 5,798,409, corresponding to EP 0784641 B (MINNESOTA MINING AND MANUFACTURING COMPANY) discloses both aqueous and non-aqueous two-part polyurethane compositions and optionally self-healable and scratch-resistant coatings prepared therefrom. In particular, the non-aqueous composition comprises a part A and part B, wherein part A may comprise a urethane prepolymer which may contain carboxylic acid functional groups and which has a defined average hydroxyl functionality and a defined hydroxyl equivalent-weight, while Part B contains a cross-linker from the group consisting of polyisocyanates, blocked polyisocyanates, and mixtures thereof and an organic solvent. The NCO:OH ratio of Part B to Part A ranges from about 0.95:1 to about 1.07:1. These compositions are said to provide a PUR having excellent scratch resistance and self-healability (reference is made in particular to par. [0020]). However, this document neither discloses nor suggests to prepare compositions containing two fluorinated ionizable PUR polymers having opposite charges and it does not teach or suggest to submit such compositions to cross-linking. WO 2013/017470 (SOLVAY SPECIALTY POLYMERS IT) discloses self-healing polymer compositions comprising: a) at least one fluorinated ionisable polymer (A), which comprises recurring fluorinated blocks and recurring functional blocks, each of said recurring functional blocks comprising at least one ionisable anionic group, and in which polymer (A) at least one of the said recurring functional blocks is comprised between two fluorinated blocks; b) at least one fluorinated ionisable polymer (B), which comprises recurring fluorinated blocks and recurring functional blocks, each of said recurring functional blocks comprising at least one ionisable cationic group, and in which polymer (B) at least one of the said recurring functional blocks is comprised between two fluorinated blocks; wherein the ratio between the ionic equivalents of polymer (A) and the ionic equivalents of polymer (B) ranges from 1.1 to 0.9. Polymers A and B can be ester, polyester, polyurethane or acrylate polymers. The above compositions can be used for manufacturing articles like sealing agents, gaskets and membranes or for manufacturing coatings for substrates like leather, paper or cotton. Certain compositions wherein the (per)fluoropolyether chains in polymers (A) and (B) have similar molecular weight are rubber-like materials endowed with self-healing properties at room temperature, i.e. they possess an intrinsic ability to repair mechanical damages without melting and cooling. Two alternative methods are disclosed in this application for the manufacture of the above compositions. The first one is a so-called dispersion precipitation method which comprises the following steps: a) preparing a dispersion of at least one polymer (A) and a dispersion of at least one polymer (B) in water or in a mixture of water and an organic solvent; b) mixing together the dispersion of polymer (A) and the dispersion of polymer (B) until complete precipitation of a solid polymer composition; c) filtering off the precipitated solid polymer composition; d) washing and drying the precipitated polymer composition. The second one comprises hot mixing at least one polymer (A) and at least one polymer (B). In fact, in the dispersion precipitation method, polymers (A) and (B) are used in the salified form; however, compositions obtained according to this method are contaminated by salts (usually triethylammonium chloride); this salt contamination has a negative impact on the swelling properties of the compositions in water. Furthermore, this method does not allow preparing stable dispersions which can be stored for a certain time period and used subsequently. SUMMARY OF INVENTION The applicant has now found out that it is possible to provide stable polymer dispersions containing block fluoropolymers having opposite charges by avoiding the use of water and by using at least one fluorinated solvent and at least one alcohol as solvent mixture. The dispersions are able to provide solid compositions endowed with high chemical and physical resistance and also with self-healing (or self-repairing) properties. Thanks to the use of the above solvent mixture, the dispersions are stable also when added with a cross-linking agent. Thus, in a first aspect, the present invention relates to a non-aqueous fluoropolymer composition [composition (C)] comprising: a) at least one fluorinated ionisable polymer [polymer (A)], which comprises recurring fluorinated blocks and recurring functional blocks, each of said recurring functional blocks comprising at least one ionisable anionic group, and wherein at least one of the said recurring functional blocks is comprised between two fluorinated blocks; b) at least one fluorinated ionisable polymer [polymer (B)], which comprises recurring fluorinated blocks and recurring functional blocks, each of said recurring functional blocks comprising at least one ionisable cationic group, and wherein at least one of the said recurring functional blocks is comprised between two fluorinated blocks; c) at least one fluorinated solvent and d) at least one alcohol. In a second aspect, the invention relates to a process for preparing a non-aqueous fluoropolymer composition, said process comprising: a) providing at least one fluorinated ionisable polymer [polymer (A)], which comprises recurring fluorinated blocks and recurring functional blocks, each of said recurring functional blocks comprising at least one ionisable anionic group, and wherein at least one of the said recurring functional blocks is comprised between two fluorinated blocks; b) providing at least one fluorinated ionisable polymer [polymer (B)], which comprises recurring fluorinated blocks and recurring functional blocks, each of said recurring functional blocks comprising at least one ionisable cationic group, and wherein at least one of the said recurring functional blocks is comprised between two fluorinated blocks; c) mixing polymer (A) and polymer (B) in at least one fluorinated solvent and at least one alcohol. In a third aspect, the invention relates to sealing agents, gaskets, membranes, films and coatings obtained from composition [C]. In a fourth aspect, the invention relates to the use of composition [C] for the preparation of sealing agents, gaskets, membranes, films and coatings DEFINITIONS For the purposes of the present description, the following definitions apply. Fluorinated Blocks The expression “recurring fluorinated blocks” means that a fluorinated block is repeated in the polymer structure; likewise, the expression “recurring functional blocks” means that the functional blocks are repeated in the polymer structure; according to one aspect of the invention, fluorinated blocks alternate with functional blocks. The expression “fluorinated block” preferably denotes a (per)fluoropolyether block comprising a (per)fluoropolyoxylakylene chain [herein after also referred to as (ROF) chain] which comprises, preferably consists of, recurring units having at least one catenary ether bond and at least one fluorocarbon moiety; typically, the (ROF) chain comprises one or more randomly distributed repeating units R°, which are selected from the following groups: [in-line-formulae]—CFXO—, wherein X is F or CF3; (i)[/in-line-formulae] [in-line-formulae]—CF2CFXO—, wherein X is F or CF3; (ii)[/in-line-formulae] [in-line-formulae]—CF2CF2CF2O—; (iii)[/in-line-formulae] [in-line-formulae]—CF2CF2CF2CF2O—. (iv)[/in-line-formulae] Preferably, the repeating units are selected from —CF2O— and —CF2CF2O— units in a molar ratio ranging preferably from 0.1 to 10, more preferably from 0.5 to 5. Functional Blocks A functional block is a moiety which comprises one ionisable group and, optionally one or more reactive groups. A “functional block comprising at least one ionisable anionic group” according to the present invention comprises, preferably consists of, a hydrocarbon chain [hereinafter referred to as chain (RH)], optionally comprising one or more aromatic, heteroaromatic, cycloaliphatic or heterocycloaliphatic groups, said chain (RH) comprising at least one functional group which, under appropriate pH conditions, forms an anionic group bearing one ore more negative charges. A “functional block comprising at least one ionisable cationic group” comprises, preferably consists of, a hydrocarbon chain [hereinafter referred to as chain (RH)], optionally comprising one or more aromatic, heteroaromatic, cycloaliphatic or heterocycloaliphatic groups, said chain (RH) comprising at least one functional group which, under appropriate pH conditions, forms a cationic group bearing one ore more positive charges. In the present description, these functional blocks can be also referred to as “ionisable anionic blocks” and “ionisable cationic blocks” or “anionic blocks” and “cationic blocks” respectively, or can be referred to together as “ionisable blocks”. Ionisable Groups An “ionisable anionic group” is a functional group which, under appropriate pH conditions, forms an anionic group bearing one or more negative charges and an “ionisable cationic group” is a functional group which, under appropriate pH conditions, forms a cationic group bearing one or more positive charges. Fluorinated Solvent A fluorinated solvent is a hydrocarbon or aromatic solvent containing one or more fluorine atoms and, optionally, one or more oxygen atoms. Preferably, the fluorinated solvent is selected from hydrofluoroethers (HFEs), hydrofluoropolyethers (HFPE), hexafluoroxylene and mixtures of two or more of these solvents. Examples of suitable HFEs are those known as Novec® fluids, available from 3M, while examples of HFPEs are known as H-Galden® HFPEs. Alcohol The term alcohol includes aliphatic straight or branched alcohols containing from 2 to 6 carbon atoms. Preferably, the alcohol is selected from ethanol, n-propanol and isopropanol; more preferably, the alcohol is isopropanol. DETAILED DESCRIPTION Compositions The compositions of the invention contain a polymer (A) and a polymer (B) as defined above in such an amount as the equivalent ratio between the ionic equivalents of polymer (A) and the ionic equivalents of polymer (B) is either 1:1 or higher or lower than 1:1; in the following, compositions wherein the ratio is higher or lower than 1:1 will also referred to as “unbalanced compositions [C]”. In compositions [C], the ionic groups in polymer (A) and the ionic groups in polymer (B) give rise to an ionically interconnected polymer network. Unbalanced compositions [C] offer the advantage that free ionisable groups are still present on either polymer (A) or on polymer (B); these groups can be submitted to cross-liking reactions, in order to form a tighter polymer network. Among unbalanced compositions [C], those in which the (A):(B) ionic equivalent ratio or (B):(A) ionic equivalent ratio is at least of 1:1.25 are preferred. Unbalanced compositions [C] in which the equivalent ratio between the ionic equivalents of anionic polymer (A) and the ionic equivalents of cationic polymer (B) is higher than 1:1, preferably higher than 1.25:1 are particularly preferred. In the compositions of the invention, the overall amount of polymer (A) and polymer (B) with respect to the overall amount of solvents and the weight ratio between the fluorinated solvent and the alcohol will be selected according to the polymers and solvents in such a way as to obtain compositions having a suitable fluidity for casting or moulding processes carried out for obtaining polymeric materials. For example, as far as the solvents are concerned, if Novec® 7500 HFE and isopropanol are used, their weight ratio typically ranges from 1:1 to 10:1. Preparation of the Compositions of the Invention Compositions [C] can be conveniently prepared by a process which comprises: a) providing at least one fluorinated ionisable polymer [polymer (A)], which comprises recurring fluorinated blocks and recurring functional blocks, each of said recurring functional blocks comprising at least one ionisable anionic group, and wherein at least one of the said recurring functional blocks is comprised between two fluorinated blocks; b) providing at least one fluorinated ionisable polymer [polymer (B)], which comprises recurring fluorinated blocks and recurring functional blocks, each of said recurring functional blocks comprising at least one ionisable cationic group, and wherein at least one of the said recurring functional blocks is comprised between two fluorinated blocks; c) mixing polymer (A) and polymer (B) in at least one fluorinated solvent and at least one alcohol. The amounts of polymers (A) and (B) will be selected in such as way as to obtain the desired ionic equivalent ratio. The expression “mixing polymer (A) and polymer (B) in at least one fluorinated solvent and at least one alcohol” means that polymers (A) and (B) and the solvents are mixed with, or added to each other in any order. Preferably, polymer (A) and polymer (B) are added to the solvent mixture at a temperature ranging from room temperature to a temperature at least 10° C. lower that the boiling temperature of the lowest-boiling solvent in the mixture. Usually, when isopropanol is used as solvent, the temperature does not exceed 60° C. Mixing can be carried out according to conventional techniques, typically with magnetic or mechanical stirring. Mixing is continued until a dispersion of polymer (A) and (B) in the solvent is obtained. In unbalanced compositions [C], i.e. those in which the equivalent ratio between the ionic equivalents of polymer (A) and the ionic equivalents of polymer (B) is higher or lower than 1:1, a cross-linking agent (cross-linker) can be added in an equivalent amount ranging from 10 to 100% with respect to the equivalents of ionisable groups that are present in excess in the composition. Indeed, as anticipated above, it has been observed that when a cross-linking agent is added to such compositions, the chemical resistance of the polymeric material obtained from the compositions increases. A cross-linking agent can be selected, for example, from epoxysilanes and epoxyacrylates, epoxysilanes being preferred. Usually, when a silane compound is added as cross-linker, cross-linking is accomplished by submitting the compositions to hydrolysis and heating. Instead, when an acrylate cross-linker is added, cross-linking is usually accomplished photochemically. Exemplary epoxysilanes comply with formula (Epo-sil-I) here below: wherein R and Ra, independently from each other, are selected from hydrogen, straight or branched C1-C4 alkyl, m and n are integers selected from 1 to 10 and Rb is C1-C4 alkyl. An example of preferred compound of formula (I) is that in which R and Ra are both hydrogen, m is 1, n is 3 and Rb is methyl. This compound is available from Evonik Degussa GmbH with the tradename Dynasylan® GLYMO. When epoxysilanes are used as cross-linkers, a tetraalkyl orthosilicate, typically tetraethyl orthosilicate Si(OC2H5)4 (TEOS), can be used in order increase the cross-linking density. Indeed, in the presence of water, ORb groups hydrolyse to silanol groups which react with TEOS, giving rise to cross-linked structures comprising recurring —Si—O—Si— units. When a cross-linking agent is added to compositions wherein the ratio between the ionic equivalents of anionic polymer (A) and the cationic equivalents of polymer (B) is higher than 1:1, preferably higher than 1:1.25, a catalyst is also added in an amount ranging from 1 to 10% mol with respect to the cross-linker. Organic bases like imidazoles have proven very effective catalysts in these reactions; a preferred example of imidazole catalyst is 2-ethyl-4-methylimidazole. Other suitable catalysts are metal salts and metal oxides and alkali salts of weak acids. Exemplary epoxyacrylates comply with formula (Epo-Acryl-I) here below: wherein R, Ra and m are as defined above. A preferred example of Epo-Acryl-I is glycidylmethacrylate, complying with formula: A suitable photoinitiator is added to the reaction mixture in an amount typically ranging from 1 to 10% with respect to the weigth of the neat curable composition. Examples of photoinitiators are benzophenone, 2-hydroxy-4′-(2-hydroxyethoxy)-2-methylpropiophenone, 1-hydroxycyclohexyl phenyl ketone. A preferred example of photoinitiator is 2-hydroxy-2-methyl-1-phenyl-propan-1-one, available, for instance from Ciba under the trade name Darocur® 1173. An additional acrylate compound can be used in order increase the cross-linking density in a suitable amount with respect to the Epo-Acryl-I. Examples of such additional acrylates are alpha,omega-diacrylates like tripropylene glycol diacrylate and 1,6-hexanediol diacrylate or polyol acrylates like trimethylolpropane triacrylate.

Compositions [C] can be conveniently used for the preparation of polymeric materials. Typically, polymeric materials prepared from compositions [C] are amorphous materials endowed with elastic properties (softness and deformability) and are typically in the form of sealing agents, gaskets, membranes, films and coatings. These polymeric materials are typically prepared by film-casting or moulding and drying a composition [C] according to methods known in the art. These polymeric materials are endowed with high chemical stability and with improved mechanical properties. In particular, it has been observed that certain polymeric materials prepared from compositions [C] are endowed with self-healing (or self-repairing) properties.

Suitable organic solvents are ketones or acetates having a boiling point higher than 60° C., like methyl-ethyl-ketone and butyl acetate, partially fluorinated solvents like H-Galden® hydrofluoropolyether or hexafluoroxylene (HFX). The resulting mixture is usually heated up to a temperature ranging from 60 to 70° C. until the reaction (herein after referred to as polymerization reaction) is complete. Thereafter, a functionalized diol of formula HO—RH—OH, optionally salified with a suitable salifying agent, dissolved in the same solvent as used in the polymerization reaction is added and the resulting mixture is heated again at a temperature ranging from 60 to 70° C. until the reaction (herein after referred to as extension reaction) is complete.

Contact Angle qM (°) at time zero Solvent: H2O MilliQ—q (°) average value on 10 drops Deposition of the samples (2 ml): automatic mode—speed 0.5 ml/s Hardness Shore A 3″—DIN53504 S2 cross velocity 200 mm/min. Cross-Cut Test The Elcometer Cross Hatch Cutter is a simple but effective instrument for assessing the adhesion or resistance to separation of coatings from substrates. It can be used in accordance with the following International Standards: AS 1580.408.4, AS 3894.9, ASTM D3359-B, EN 13523-6 (superseding ECCA T6), ISO 2409 (superseding BS 3900-E6 & NF T30-038), ISO 16276-2 and JIS K 5600-5-6. The coated supports under examination were notched using and Elcometer 1542 Cross Hatch Cutter to form a grid, then an adhesive tape selected in accordance with the afore-mentioned ASTM method was applied and removed. Thereafter, the number of squares remained on the support was counted and expressed as percentage (reported as 100/100 in Tables 1 and 3). Scratch-Test Circular scratches were made with a tip on the sample under examination. The tip material was driven on the sample surface with a known and constant load, which was progressively increased (double range: from 0.1-1 N to 1-10N). Table 2 reports the load which corresponds to the formation of a scratch on the surface (visual inspection). After 24 hours and 2 weeks at room temperature and without any treatment of the sample, the sample was inspected in order to establish whether self-repairing had occurred. If the sample was still damaged, the load corresponding to the remaining damage was recorded. Due to the fact that in some cases no scratch was observed on the samples at a load as high as 10N, four overlapping circular scratches were made at a load of 10 N, then self-repairing was evaluated as explained above. Solvent Rub Test—MEK (Referred to as DR Mek in the Tables) Solvent resistance was evaluated by means of the Solvent Rub Test according to ASTM D4752 and NCCA 11-18. This test method is used to determine the degree of cure of a baked film by the film resistance to a specified solvent. The test is usually performed using methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) as the solvent. The MEK resistance or degree of cure applies to paint topcoats and primers. ASTM D4752 envisages rubbing the surface of a baked film with a cheesecloth soaked with MEK until failure or break of the film occurs. The type of cheesecloth, the stroke distance, the stroke rate, and the approximate applied pressure of each rub are specified. Rubs were counted as double rubs (one rub forward and one rub backward constitutes a double rub). The test was stopped when damage of the coating is observed or at a limit value of 200 double rubs (DR). The data are reported in Tables 1 and 3 below. Spot Tests Drops of solvents, acids or basis were deposited onto the samples (coatings); after evaporation the samples were visually inspected to verify whether marks or sings of damage had formed. The data are reported in Tables 5 and 6.
