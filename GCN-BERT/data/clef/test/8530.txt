CA 02799942 2012-11-19 PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITION CONTAINING SOLIFENACIN TECHNICAL FIELD [0001] The present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition containing solifenacin or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. More particularly, the present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition containing a complex between solifenacin or a pharmaceutically acceptable sait thereof and an ion exchange resin, and an acrylic based polymer. BACKGROUND ART [0002] Solifenacin is represented by the following structural formula and its chemical name is (R)-quinuclidin-3-yl (S)-Iphenyl-l,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline-2-carboxylate. [Chemical I] O [0003] It has been reported that solifenacin or a salt thereof has an excellent selective antagonistic activity against muscarinic M3 receptor and is useful as a preventive or a therapeutic agent for urologic diseases such as urinary incontinence and pollakiuria in nervous pollakiuria, neurogenic bladder, nocturnal enuresis, unstable bladder, bladder spasms, chronic cystitis, and the like; respiratory diseases such as chronic obstructive lung diseases, chronic bronchitis, asthma, and rhinitis; and gastrointestinal diseases such as irritable bowel syndrome, spastic colitis, and diverticulitis (see patent literature I). [0004] In particular, this compound has higher selectivity for the M3 receptor existing in the smooth muscle, gland CA 02799942 2012-11-19 tissues, or the like as compared with the M2 receptor existing in the heart or the like, so that it has high utility as an M3 receptor antagonist having less side effects on the heart or the like, particularly as a preventive agent or a therapeutic agent for urinary incontinence, pollakiuria, chronic obstructive lung diseases, chronic bronchitis, asthma, rhinitis, and the like. Solifenacin is currently sold in the form of a succinate salt as a therapeutic agent for urinary urgency, pollakiuria, and urge urinary incontinence due to overactive bladder under the name of Vesicare (registered trademark) in Japan [VESIcare (registered trademark) in the U.S. and Vesicare (registered trademark) in the Europe]. [0005] Currently available preparations are an oral solid preparation (tablet) and an orally disintegrating tablet, and from the standpoint of the compliance of patients, development of various dosage forms such as a liquid has been demanded. However, solifenacin and a salt thereof have very high solubility in various solvents and have very strong bitterness and astringency. In particular, in order to develop an oral liquid formulation, it was necessary to mask the bitterness and astringency. For example, as a technique for masking the bitterness and astringency of the drug in an oral liquid formulation, forming complexes between the drug and an ion exchange resin has been known (see, for example, non patent literature 1 and patent literature 2). However, further improvement was needed for providing the oral liquid formulation of solifenacin. Incidentally, as one of the techniques for producing a pharmaceutical composition which contains amorphous solifenacin and has improved stability, a solid pharmaceutical composition having an ion exchange resin blended therein has been disclosed (patent literature 3). CA 02799942 2012-11-19 CITATION LIST PATENT LITERATURE [0006] [patent literature i] US Patent No. 6,017,927 (corresponding to WO 96/20194) [patent literature 2] US Patent No. 5,811,436 [patent literature 3] WO 2008/128028 NON PATENT LITERATURE [0007] [non patent literature i] Dr. L. Hughes, "New Use of Ion Exchange Resins in Pharmaceutical Formulation" (Rohm & Haas Research laboratories) SUMMARY OF INVENTION TECHNICAL PROBLEM [0008] The invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition containing a complex between solifenacin or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and an ion exchange resin, and provides a pharmaceutical composition which has good uniformity and dispersibility during and after production, which also has good drug content uniformity even without shaking or with gentle shaking when it is taken out from a container at the time of taking it, and which does not cause bitterness and astringency at the time of taking it and has an improved compliance. SOLUTION TO PROBLEM [0009] The present inventors made intensive studies in order to develop a pharmaceutical composition of suspension (suspension liquid) which has reduced bitterness and astringency derived from solifenacin and has good drug content uniformity even without shaking or with gentle shaking when it is formed into a pharmaceutical composition of suspension. As a result, they found that a preparation which has good drug content uniformity during and after production and does not release the drug in the oral cavity and shows good release of the drug in the stomach can be CA 02799942 2012-11-19 obtained by adding a specific polymer to a suspension of complex between solifenacin and an ion exchange resin and adjusting the pH, and thus, the invention has been completed.

ADVANTAGEOUS EFFECTS OF INVENTION [0011] In the invention, by adding an acrylic based polymer to a suspension of complex between solifenacin or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and an ion exchange resin, particles of the complex can be uniformly dispersed in a suspension. Since the dispersion stability is improved, the composition can be easily packaged in bottles without causing a variation in the concentration at the time of production, and therefore, the invention has an effect that the productivity is improved and the production equipments are simplified. Further, at the time of administration, a suspension can be made uniform without shaking or with gentle shaking, and therefore, the invention has an effect that the accuracy and ease of dosage are improved. Further, since the acrylic based polymer does not form a gel under an acidic condition, the drug release from the ion exchange resin is not inhibited in the stomach, and therefore, the invention has an effect that delay or inhibition of drug absorption in the body is not caused. DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS [0012] Hereinafter, the pharmaceutical composition of the invention will be explained. The term "to be uniformly dispersed" as used herein is defined as, for example, to be packaged in a bottle without causing a variation in the concentration at the time of production; as another embodiment, to show a good drug content uniformity after shaking a bottle filled with a suspension (suspension liquid); or as still another embodiment, not to cause a visually observed precipitation even after a bottle filled with a suspension (suspension liquid) is left for 1 hour. [0013] The wording "dispersion stability is improved" as used CA 02799942 2012-11-19 herein is defined as the fact that the concentration of the drug taken out from an upper portion of a suspension (suspension liquid) in the bottle left for 1 week is, for example, 50% or more; as another embodiment, 70% or more; or as still another embodiment, 90% or more; when the drug concentration in the suspension (suspension liquid) filled in the bottle is regarded as 100%. [0014] The wording "a drug is rapidly released" as used herein is defined as, for example, the fact that a drug release from an ion exchange resin is not inhibited in the stomach, and therefore, delay or inhibition of drug absorption in the body is not caused; or as another embodiment, the fact that 85% or more of the drug is released in 15 minutes in a dissolution test described in the United States ?harmacopeia using 0.i N hydrochloric acid as a fluid for dissolution test. [oo15] Solifenacin or a pharmaceutically acceptable sait thereof to be used in the invention can be easily obtained by performing production by or in accordance with the production process described in W0 96/20194. [0016] Solifenacin can form pharmaceutically acceptable salts with any of a broad range of inorganic and organic acids. Such salts also constitute a part of the present invention. Examples of such salts include acid addition salts with a mineral acid such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, hydroiodic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, or phosphoric acid; and those with an organic acid such as formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, oxalic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, lactic acid, malic acid, citric acid, tartaric acid, carbonic acid, picric acid, methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, or glutamic acid. As another embodiment, a succinate salt can be exemplified. These salts can be produced by a common procedure. [0017] The dosage of the pharmaceutical composition of the CA 02799942 2012-11-19 invention is suitably determined according to the individual case in consideration of administration route, disease symptoms, age, gender, and the like of a subject in need of administration. When solifenacin succinate is administered, the dosage of the active ingredient is generally from about 0.01 mg/kg to I00 mg/kg per day per adult in the case of oral administration, and this dosage is administered once a day or in two to four divided doses a day. Further, in the case where intravenous administration is performed depending on the symptoms, solifenacin succinate is administered at a dosage ranging from 0.01 mg/kg to i0 mg/kg per administration per adult once or several times per day. [0018] The blending amount of solifenacin is not particularly limited as long as it is a therapeutically or preventively effective amount. Such a blending amount is, for example, 85% by weight or less of the total amount of the preparation, as another embodiment, it is 80% by weight or less, as still another embodiment, it is 50% by weight or less, and as still further another embodiment, it is 10% by weight or less. Further, the concentration of solifenacin in a suspension (suspension liquid) is, for example, about 0.i mg/mL or more and about I0 mg/mL or less, as another embodiment, it is about 0.2 mg/mL or more and about 5 mg/mL or less, as still another embodiment, it is about 0.2 mg/mL or more and about 4 mg/mL or less, and as still another embodiment, it is about 0.5 mg/mL or more and about 2 mg/mL or less. Alternatively, it is about 0.3 mg/mL or more and about 2 mg/mL or less. [0019] The ion exchange resin is not particularly limited as long as it can form a complex with solifenacin, thereby reducing the bitterness and astringency derived from solifenacin and forming a pharmaceutically acceptable pharmaceutical composition. Specifically, for example, a pharmaceutically acceptable cationic exchange resin or anionic exchange resin can be exemplified. As another embodiment, a cationic exchange resin can be exemplified. Examples of the cationic exchange resin include a crossCA 02799942 2012-11-19 linked polymer of methacrylic acid and divinylbenzene (a weakly acidic salt is formed from a carboxylic acid functional group of the methacrylic acid and potassium) (product name: Amberlite (registered trademark) IRP88, Dow Chemical Company, polacrilin potassium NF), a cross-linked polymer of styrenesulfonic acid and divinylbenzene (a strongly acidic salt is formed from a sulfonic acid group of the styrenesulfonic acid and sodium) (product name: Amberlite (registered trademark) IRP69, Dow Chemical Company, sodium polystyrene sulfonate USP), and a crosslinked polymer of methacrylic acid and divinylbenzene (product name: Amberlite (registered trademark) IRP64, Dow Chemical Company, Polacrilex Resin). As still another embodiment, Amberlite (registered trademark) IRP88 can be exemplified. As the ion exchange resin or cationic exchange resin, one kind can be used alone or two or more kinds can be used appropriately in combination in suitable amounts. [0020] The blending amount of the ion exchange resin is not particularly limited as long as the amount permits the formation of a complex with solifenacin, thereby reducing the bitterness and astringency derived from solifenacin and forming a pharmaceutically acceptable pharmaceutical composition. Specifically, the blending amount of the ion exchange resin is, for example, about 0.I mg/mL or more and about 50 mg/mL or less, as another embodiment, it is about 0.2 mg/mL or more and about 25 mg/mL or less, and as still another embodiment, it is about 0.5 mg/mL or more and about 4 mg/mL or less. Further, the blending amount ratio by weight of solifenacin to the ion exchange resin is from about 1:0.2 to about i:I0, as another embodiment, it is from about 1:0.5 to about 1:5, as still another embodiment, it is from about i:i to about 1:3, and as still another embodiment, it is from about i:i to about 1:2. [0021] The acrylic based polymer is not particularly limited as long as it is a pharmaceutically acceptable acrylic based polymer and the viscosity thereof is increased by neutralization with an alkaline agent. Specific examples CA 02799942 2012-11-19 thereof include Carbopol 71G, 971P, 974P, 980, 981, 5984, ETD 2020, Ultrez I0, 934, 934P, 940, 941, 1342, and the like, and Pemulen TR-I, TR-2 and the like (available from Lubrizol); AQUPEC HV-501, HVS01E, HV-501ER, HV-504, HV-504E, HV-505, HV-505E, HV-505ED, and the like (available from Sumitomo Seika Chemicals Co., Ltd.); and Hibiswako 103, 104, 105, and the like (available from Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.). As another embodiment, Carbopol 974P, 934, 934P, 971P, 941, 940, 910, and the like can be exemplified. As still another embodiment, Carbopol 974P (USP/NF Monograph for Carbomer Homopolymer Type B) and 971P (USP/NF Monograph for Carbomer Homopolymer Type A) can be exemplified. As the acrylic based polymer, one kind can be used alone or two or more kinds can be used appropriately in combination in suitable amounts. [0022] The blending amount of the acrylic based polymer is not particularly limited as long as the amount permits the reduction in precipitation of the drug-ion exchange resin complex in the suspension. Specifically, the blending amount of the acrylic based polymer is, as one embodiment for example, about 0.5 mg/mL or more and about i0 mg/mL or less, as another embodiment, it is about 1 mg/mL or more and about 5 mg/mL or less, as still another embodiment, it is about 1.5 mg/mL or more and about 3 mg/mL or less, and as still another embodiment, it is about 2 mg/mL or more and about 3 mg/mL or less, although it is suitably determined according to the amount of the drug or ion exchange resin, the type of polymer, the amount of the alkaline agent, the pH, or the like. [0023] The viscosity of the acrylic based polymer can be adjusted by appropriately adding an alkaline agent and/or a pH adjuster to acrylic based polymer in suitable amounts, and the viscosity of the pharmaceutical composition (suspension, suspension liquid) of the invention. [0024] Examples of the alkaline agent which neutralizes the acrylic based polymer to cause gelation include inorganic CA 02799942 2012-11-19 bases such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, and ammonium hydroxide; and organic bases such as triethanolamine, L-arginine, tromethamine, aminomethyl propanol, and tetrahydroxypropyl ethylenediamine. As the alkaline agent, one kind can be used alone or two or more kinds can be used appropriately in combination in suitable amounts. [OO251 Examples of the pH adjuster include various acids such as citric acid, acetic acid, hydrochloric acid, succinic acid, tartaric acid, malic acid, phosphoric acid, boric acid, fumaric acid, ascorbic acid, glutamic acid, as well as the alkaline agent. A suitable pH is not particularly limited as long as it is in a range that allows the acrylic based polymer to swell so as to increase the viscosity. Specifically, the pH is, for example, about 5 or higher and about 9 or lower, as another embodiment, it is about 5 or higher and about 8 or less, as still another embodiment, it is about 6 or higher and about 7 or lower, and as still another embodiment, it is about 6.0 or higher and about 6.9 or lower. Incidentally, as shown in Test Example 1 described later, when the pH is about 5 or higher and about 9 or lower, the pH is in a range that allows solifenacin and the ion exchange resin to sufficiently form a complex, and therefore, the bitterness and astringency derived from solifenacin in the suspension can be masked. [0026] A suitable viscosity of the suspension (suspension liquid) is not particularly limited as long as it is in a range that a complex of the drug with an ion exchange resin is uniformly dispersed in the suspension and dispersion stability is improved. The range is, for example, i00 cPs or more and 8000 c?s or less as another embodiment, 130 cPs or more and 5000 cPs or less as still another embodiment, and 150 cPs or more and 3000 cPs or less as still another embodiment, when the viscosity is determined at 25°C using a rotational viscometer (Brookfield digital viscometer, ModeI:LVDV-II+) at I00 rpm. i0 CA 02799942 2012-11-19 [0027] The pharmaceutical composition of the invention is formulated into a preparation by suitably using any of a variety of pharmaceutical excipients as needed. Such a pharmaceutical excipient is not particularly limited as long as it is a pharmaceutically acceptable and pharmacologically acceptable excipient, and for example, a preservative, a corrigent, a flavor, a dispersant, a humectant, a buffer, an antifoaming agent, a solvent, or the like is used. [0028] As the preservative, methyl parahydroxy benzoate, ethyl parahydroxy benzoate, propyl parahydroxybenzoate, butyl parahydroxy benzoate, benzoic acid, benzyl alcohol, sorbic acid, acetic acid, or a salt thereof can be blended. [0029] As the corrigent, a sugar or a sugar alcohol such as sucrose, fructose, lactose, sorbitol, mannitol, xylitol, erythritol, or trehalose; or a sweetening agent such as aspartame, acesulfame potassium, sucralose, neotame, or saccharin can be blended. [0030] As the flavor, for example, lemon, lemon lime, orange, menthol, strawberry, banana, raspberry, bubble gum flavor, or the like can be blended. As the humectant, a polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid ester such as polysorbate 80 or Arlacel 83; a polyoxyethylene hydrogenated castor oil such as HCO-50; or a surfactant such as a sugar ester can be blended. [0031] As the dispersant or thickener, locust bean gum, guar gum, pullulan, xanthane gum, carrageenan, tragacanth gum, dextrin, pectin, gelatin, or the like can be blended. Other than these additives, a nonionic substance can be blended as needed. [0032] As the buffer, citric acid, phosphoric acid, boric acid, succinic acid, fumaric acid, tartaric acid, ascorbic acid, or a salt thereof, glutamic acid, glutamine, glycine, aspartic acid, alanine, arginine, or a salt thereof, il CA 02799942 2012-11-19 magnesium oxide, zinc oxide, magnesium hydroxide, or a salt thereof, or the like can be blended. [0033] As the antifoaming agent, simethicone, dimethicone, or the like can be blended. As the solvent, glycerin, propylene glycol, or the like can be blended. As the pharmaceutical excipient, one kind can be used alone or two or more kinds can be used appropriately in combination in suitable amounts. [0034] Hereinafter the production method of the invention will be explained. The production method of the invention includes the steps comprising, for example, (i) a step of dissolving solifenacin, (2) a step of forming a complex between solifenacin and an ion exchange resin, and (3) a step of preparing a suspension (suspension liquid). [0035] (i) Dissolution step: The drug is dissolved in a water-soluble solvent capable of dissolving the drug, whereby a drug solution is obtained. As the water-soluble solvent, water or an aqueous solution of an organic solvent capable of being arbitrarily dissolved in water such as a monohydric alcohol (such as methyl alcohol, ethyl alcohol, or isopropanol) or a ketone (such as acetone or methyl ethyl ketone), glycerin, propylene glycol, or the like can be exemplified. [0036] (2) Complex formation step: A reaction between the drug and an ion exchange resin as performed by adding an ion exchange resin to the drug solution obtained by dissolving the drug in the watersoluble solvent, followed by stirring. In this case, the ion exchange resin is preferably used in an amount about 1 to 5 times as much as that of the drug. The temperature during the reaction is not particularly limited, however, the reaction is preferably performed at room temperature. The reaction time is from about 0.5 to 6 hours. By the reaction, a drug-ion exchange resin complex in which the CA 02799942 2012-11-19 drug is adsorbed in an amount of about 80% or more of the theoretical ion adsorption amount can be quantitatively obtained, and above all, the complex is preferably used as a complex in which the drug is adsorbed in an amount of about 85% or more and about 100% or less of the theoretical ion adsorption amount. [0037] (3) Dispersion or suspension step: An acrylic based polymer is added to water or a solution obtained by adding, to water, an organic solvent capable of being arbitrarily dissolved in water and dispersed therein while stirring. At this time, another pharmaceutically acceptable additive may be added to water or the solution in advance. Further, it is also possible to mix the acrylic based polymer with another pharmaceutically acceptable additive in advance. The temperature at the time of dispersing the acrylic based polymer is not particularly limited, however, the acrylic based polymer is preferably dispersed at room temperature or if necessary, at a temperature lower than room temperature. Specifically, for example, the temperature is from 0°C to 40°C, and as another embodiment, it is from 5°C to 30°C. The dispersion time is, for example, from 0.5 hour to 24 hours, and as another embodiment, it is from i hour to 12 hours. While stirring the liquid in which the acrylic based polymer is dispersed, an alkaline agent is added thereto to increase the pH thereof, whereby the viscosity of the liquid is increased. The addition amount of the alkaline agent at this time is not particularly limited as long as the pH of the resulting liquid is in a range that allows the viscosity to increase. However, the addition amount of the alkaline agent is determined by considering the increase in the pH value after adding the drug-ion exchange resin complex. The drug-ion exchange resin complex is dispersed in the water-soluble solvent to which the acrylic based polymer and the pharmaceutically acceptable additive have been added. [0038] As the pharmaceutical composition of the invention, the suspension obtained in the dispersion or suspension step CA 02799942 2012-11-19 described in the above (3) may be used as such, or the suspension is packaged in a capsule by a method known per se, and can also be used as a capsule preparation. Alternatively, from the complex obtained in the above (2), the solvent is evaporated by a method known per se, thereby preparing a dry composition (powder). Then, the resulting dry substance is formulated into a preparation such as a granule, a powder, a dry syrup, a pill, a tablet, or a capsule by a method known per se, and the preparation in such a dosage form can also be formulated as a ready-tosuspend preparation which is used by being resuspended in a solvent (preferably containing the acrylic based polymer) when it is taken. Alternatively, from the suspension obtained in the above (3), the solvent is evaporated by a method known per se, thereby preparing a dry composition (powder). Then, the resulting dry substance is formulated into a preparation such as a granule, a powder, a dry syrup, a pill, a tablet, or a capsule by a method known per se, and the resulting preparation is used, or the preparation in such a dosage form can also be formulated as a ready-tosuspend preparation which is used by being resuspended in a solvent when it is taken.
