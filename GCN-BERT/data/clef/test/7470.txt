Improved Wound Dressing The present invention relates to a wound dressing, in particular, to an improved wound dressing for reducing post-operative swelling of a body part of a human or animal patient, or for controlling blood loss from wounds. Post-operative swelling results from the accumulation of bodily fluid around an operation wound. Post-operative swelling cannot be eliminated altogether because following an operation the wound needs a blood supply to enable healing which inevitably results in some leakage and, hence, swelling. Since swelling can hinder recovery and in some cases lead to further complications, it is always an issue that is sought to be minimised. The control of blood loss, especially following a serious accident, is of great importance as excessive loss of blood can hamper recovery leading to medical complications or even fatality. The use of bandages is known in the art in order to minimise post-operative swelling or to control blood loss. The use of bandages is appealing since they are generally versatile in that they can be readily adapted for use on different body members and on wounds of different sizes. However when used as an aid for minimising post-operative swelling, bandages can be bulky and cumbersome. This is especially the case in relation to head injuries where most of the bandage employed does not come into contact with the wound but rather is around the head merely holding a small part of the bandage against the wound. Moreover, wounds need to be checked periodically, to ensure that there is not excessive leakage of fluid from the wound. Generally, bandages are disposed of when a wound is checked and this is wasteful. There are a number of devices known in the art directed at minimising post-operative swelling in patients undergoing surgery on the head. W02005/097022 discloses a post-operative head dressing comprising a rigid cap adapted to fit over the head of a patient, and a liner. The liner is a network of tubes of resilient material connected to a single opening through which gas may be introduced to pressurise the liner network. The liner expands against the cap to squeeze the head. GB 2435833 discloses a post-operative head dressing comprising a cap adapted to fit over the head of a patient. The cap is a patchwork of compartments of airtight flexible material which are evacuated during use, whereby atmospheric pressure compresses the flexible material. The compartments are filled with beads, preferably polystyrene beads, so that, on air evacuation, the cap not only becomes rigid, but also gently pressed against the scalp to inhibit post-operative swelling and/or bleeding from head wounds. According to a first aspect of the invention there is provided a wound dressing comprising: a sealed enclosure having at least one compartment; a plurality of spaced apart pillar-like structures positioned within the at least one compartment; at least one connecting member connecting one of said plurality of spaced apart pillar-like structures to a neighbouring pillar-like structure; a pressure applicator positioned within the at least one compartment, the pressure applicator being configured to apply a pressure force to an object in use of the wound dressing; a vacuum indicator; and means for evacuating air from the at least one compartment, wherein the evacuation of air from the at least one compartment causes a reduction in the distance between at least two of the pillar-like structures and causes the pressure applicator to apply a pressure force to an object in contact with the wound dressing. The reduction in the distance between at least two of the pillar-like structures has the effect of reducing the overall length of the wound dressing resulting in the exertion of pressure by the pressure application in a concentrated manner to the wound in use thus restricting the amount of swelling that may occur. The present invention thus provides an improved wound dressing that stems swelling and bleeding of a wound. Connecting the pillar-like structures to a neighbouring structure removes the need for re-adjusting the positions of the structures relative to each other after use, as is generally required in the prior art dressings mentioned above that incorporate bead structures. The pillar-like structures may be formed from any suitable material. Ideally the pillar-like structures are formed from either a rubber based material, a silicon based material or an elastomeric polymer. Preferably the pillar-like structures are spaced apart from each other in a predetermined arrangement. By arranging the pillar-like structures in a predetermined arrangement, the way in which pressure can be exerted onto a body member when air is evacuated from the compartment can be controlled. For example, arrangement of the pillar-like structures in long thin parallel strips will result in greater reduction along one axis than another. Conveniently the pillar-like structures are evenly spaced within the compartment. By having the pillar-like structures evenly spaced from each other, an equal reduction in the distance between adjoining pillar-like structures will take place, hence resulting in the application of uniform pressure across a body part once air has been evacuated from the compartment. Preferably the pillar-like structures are rectangular columns, however, the pillar-like structures may be formed of columns having any suitable cross-sectional geometry. For example, the pillar-like structures could be triangular, cylindrical, hexagonal etc in cross-section. The connecting members may be integrally formed with the pillar-like structures. Alternatively the connecting members may be bonded with the pillar-like structures. In exemplary embodiments, the connecting members are substantially V-shaped. It would be understood that the connecting members may be of a different shape for example straight or curved etc. Preferably the sealed enclosure comprises a first and second film layer. The first and second film layers may be formed of any suitable material. Ideally the first and second film layers are formed from a vacuum formable material such as PVC. Optionally, the first film layer and/or the second film layer is light permeable. In exemplary embodiments, the first film layer and/or the second film layer is translucent. In exemplary embodiments, the first film layer and/or the second film layer is transparent. Preferably the first and second film layers are bonded together around their edges to define the sealed enclosure. The pillar-like structures are thus retained between the first and second film layers The first and second film layers may be bonded together by any suitable means, for example the film layers may be heat sealed, ultrasonically welded or glued together. Preferably the plurality of pillar-like structures are moveably retained between the first and second film layers. Preferably the plurality of pillar-like structures are retained in position between the first and second film layers by connection to the first and/or second film layer. The pillar-like structures may be retained in position between the first and second film layers by any suitable means, for example by a heat seal, an ultrasonic weld or glue. Preferably the plurality of pillar-like structures are integrally formed with at least one of the film layers. Preferably a portion of the first film layer is adapted to be drawn into the space between the at least two pillar-like structures when air is evacuated from the compartment. As the first film layer is drawn into the space the dimensions of the wound dressing are reduced, causing a reduction in the distance between the at least two pillar-like structures. Preferably the pressure applicator comprises a rigid or semi-rigid material. Preferably the means for evacuating air from the at least one compartment comprises a vacuum release valve. The means for evacuating air from the at least one compartment may further comprise a non-return valve in order to prevent the regression of air into the at least one compartment during the evacuation of air from the compartment. Preferably, the vacuum indicator comprises: an indicator element; and a deformable membrane, wherein when the deformable membrane is in a first state the indicator element is obscured, and when the deformable membrane is in a second state the extent to which the indicator element is obscured is reduced, the deformable membrane being configured to transition from the first state to the second state on exposure to a decrease in surrounding pressure. In this way, the vacuum indicator provides a means by which a user can easily check that the integrity of the pressure differential caused by a vacuum state has not failed or been compromised, thus reducing or mitigating the risk of unwanted or adverse effects caused by said failure as a user is able to take action to rectify the issue. Optionally, the deformable membrane is configured to transition from the first state to the second state on exposure to a decrease in surrounding pressure towards a pressure that is significantly lower than atmospheric pressure. In exemplary embodiments of the invention, the indicator element comprises an optical indicator. The optical indicator facilitates the indication to a user of when a required vacuum state has been reached during the air evacuation process. It also facilitates the indication to a user of a change in the maintenance of a vacuum state. Optionally, the optical indicator comprises a different hue to the deformable membrane. The use of a different hue facilitates the identification of the optical indicator. In exemplary embodiments of the invention, the optical indicator may comprise a plain coloured surface or a vividly coloured surface. In exemplary embodiments of the invention, the indicator element comprises a protuberance. Optionally, the protuberance projects in a direction substantially perpendicular to the deformable membrane. Optionally, the deformable membrane comprises a foraminous material. The foraminous material may be any suitable foraminous material, for example, the deformable membrane may comprise a foam material. In exemplary embodiments of the invention, wherein the indicator element comprises a protuberance, the deformable membrane comprises a guide-hole therethrough, said guide-hole adapted to house the protuberance. Optionally, the vacuum indicator may further comprise a housing adapted to receive said deformable membrane. Preferably, the wound dressing further comprises a flap attached to each end of the sealed enclosure. In accordance with a second aspect, there is provided a wound dressing assembly comprising: a wound dressing according to the first aspect of the invention; and a band adapted to be secured to a body part of a human or animal patient, wherein the wound dressing is connectable to the band. Preferably, the wound dressing is realisably connectable to the band. In embodiment wherein the wound dressing comprises a flap attached to each end of the sealed enclosure, the wound dressing may be realisably connected to the band via the flaps. Preferably the wound dressing is realisably connectable to the band by means of a hook and loop type fastener mechanism. In exemplary embodiments, the wound dressing assembly further comprises means for evacuating air into the at least one compartment. The means for evacuating air into the at least one compartment may be in the form of a hand pump or an inlet valve connectable to a compressor. There now follows a description of preferred embodiments of the invention, by way of non-limiting example, with reference being made to the accompanying drawings, in which: Figure 1 is a view of a first embodiment of a wound dressing according to the invention; Figure 2 is a view from a below of the sealed enclosure forming part of the wound dressing of figure 1; Figure 3 is a view from a above of the sealed enclosure forming part of the wound dressing of figure 1; Figure 4 is a view from the side of the sealed enclosure forming part of the wound dressing of figure 1; and Figure 5 is a schematic view showing the application of a wound dressing according to the invention applied to a head of a patient; and Figure 6 is a schematic view showing the application of a wound dressing according to the invention applied to an arm of a patient. Referring to Figures 1 to 4, an embodiment of a wound dressing 10 according to a first aspect of the invention is shown. The wound dressing 10 comprises a sealed enclosure 12 having at least one compartment 14; a plurality of spaced apart pillar-like structures 16 positioned within the at least one compartment 14; a pressure applicator 17 positioned within the at least one compartment 14, and means for evacuating air from the at least one compartment 15. The sealed enclosure 12 comprises a first film layer 22 and a second film layer 24 which are sealed together around their edges to define the sealed enclosure 12. The first and second film layers 22, 24 may additionally be bonded together at various points in order to define one or more further compartments within the sealed enclosure 12. The first and second film layers 22, 24 are made of PVC material and are heat sealed to one another to define the sealed enclosure 12 and/or compartments. The first and second film layers 22, 24 are light permeable and may be transparent or translucent, preferably transparent in nature. The pillar-like structures 16 (hereinafter referred to as 'pillars’) are substantially rectangular in shape and are connected to a neighbouring structure by means of a connecting member 26. In the embodiment shown, the connecting members 26 are substantially V-shaped. It would be understood that the connecting members 26 may be of an alternative suitable shape. In a preferred embodiment, the pillars 16 are made from a silicon based material and the connecting members 26 are made of a resilient material such as a flexible plastic material. The pillars 16 may be moveably retained between the first and second film layers 22, 24 or may be retained in position between the film layers 22, 24 by connection to the first and/or second film layer. The pressure applicator 17 is configured to apply a pressure force to an object in use of the wound dressing, and comprises a rigid or semi-rigid material. In preferred embodiments, the pressure applicator 17 is formed of the same material as the pillars 16. In the embodiment shown, the pressure applicator 17 is substantially oval in shape and is centrally positioned within the sealed enclosure 12. The vacuum indicator 32 is positioned within the sealed enclosure 12 and is positioned proximate the pressure applicator 17. The vacuum indicator 32 comprises an indicator element (not shown) and a deformable membrane (not shown). The vacuum indicator further comprises a housing 34 adapted to receive the deformable membrane. The housing 34 is beneficial in that it facilitates the positioning of the membrane relative to the indicator element. The deformable membrane is configured to transition from a first state to a second state on exposure to a decrease in the surrounding pressure. In preferred embodiments, the deformable membrane is configured to transition from the first state to the second state on an exposure to a decrease in surrounding pressure towards a pressure that is significantly lower than atmospheric pressure. The deformable membrane is arranged such that when in the first state, the indicator element is obscured and when in the second state, the extent to which the indicator element is obscured is reduced. The deformable membrane comprises a foraminous material in the form of a foam material. It would be understood that the deformable membrane may comprise any suitable foraminous material. The indicator element comprises an optical indicator. In preferred embodiments, the indicator element comprises a protuberance (not shown). The protuberance projects in a direction substantially perpendicular to the deformable membrane. The deformable membrane comprises a guide-hole therethrough which is adapted to house the protuberance. The protuberance comprises a surface comprising a different hue to the deformable membrane. The surface maybe a plain coloured surface or a vividly coloured surface. For example if the deformable membrane is grey in colour, the surface 30 may be white in colour i.e. a plain coloured surface or be luminous green in colour i.e. a vividly coloured surface. The means for evacuating air from the at least one compartment is in the form of a vacuum release valve 15 having a non-return valve in order to prevent regression of air into the at least one compartment during evacuation of air from the compartment 14. When air is evacuated from the compartment 14, a portion of the first film layer 22 and/or a portion of the second film layer 24 are pulled into a space 20 between two adjoining pillars 16. As the film layers 22, 24 are pulled into the space 20 by the vacuum left by the evacuation of air therefrom, the overall surface area of the wound dressing 10 is reduced causing a reduction in the spacing between the adjoining pillars 16. As the adjoining pillars 16 are drawn towards one another, the connecting members 26 are caused to flex inwardly into the space 20. In addition, the evacuation of air from the compartment 14 will cause the pressure applicator 17 to apply a pressure force to an object in contact with the wound dressing. The pressure force will increase as air is evacuated from the compartment 14. The film layers 22, 24 provide a controlled and self-limiting decrease in length of the wound dressing 10 in one or two axis as air is expelled. When air is reintroduced into the compartment 14, the pillars 16 are returned to their original spacing due to the resiliency of the connecting members 26 causing the connecting members 26 to return to their original position and hence push the pillars 16 away from each other. The pillars 16 are spaced apart from a neighbouring pillar in a predetermined arrangement depending on requirements. The wound dressing further comprises a flap 36 attached to each end of the sealed enclosure 12. The flaps 36 may be attached to the ends of the sealed enclosure 12 by any suitable means. Referring to figure 5, a wound dressing assembly in accordance with a second aspect of the invention is shown. The wound dressing assembly comprises a wound dressing 10 in accordance with the first aspect of the invention; and a band 40 adapted to be secured to a body part of a human or animal patient. In the embodiment shown, the band 40 is secured to the head of a patient. The wound dressing 10 is realisably connectable to the band 40 via the flaps 36 by means of a hook and loop type fastener mechanism (not shown). It would be understood that the wound dressing 10 may be connectable to the band 40 by other suitable means. The wound dressing assembly may further comprise means for introducing air into the at least one compartment (not shown) which may be in the form of a hand pump or an inlet valve connectable to a compressor. Referring to Figure 6, a wound dressing assembly according to the invention is shown applied to an arm of a patient in order to reduce post-operative swelling of the arm of a patient. In this case, a plurality of bands 40 are used to secure the wound dressing to the arm.
