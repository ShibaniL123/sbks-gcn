(2) tetraisopropyl-1-fluoro-3-hydroxypropylidene-1,1-bisphosphonate
To a suspension of NaH (96 mg, 60%, 2.4 mmol) in THF (15 mL) prepared under an argon atmosphere was added at 0° C. tetraisopropylmonofluoromethylenediphosphonate (724 mg, 2.0 mmol) dissolved in 5 mL of THF. After stirring for 30 min, 2-(2-iodoethoxy)tetrahydro-2H-pyran (615 mg, 2.4 mmol) and 15-crown-5-ether (88 mg, 0.4 mmol) dissolved in 2 mL of THF was added. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 24 hr, and the reaction was discontinued with saturated ammonium chloride solution. A compound was extracted from the aqueous phase with ethyl acetate (2×50 mL), and the obtained organic phases were mixed, dehydrated over magnesium sulfate. After filtration, the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. A crude product of tetraisopropyl-1-fluoro-3-((tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-yl)oxy)propylidene-1,1-bisphosphonate was treated with 2 mL of 1N hydrogen chloride methanol solution, and the mixture was stirred for 10 min. The reaction mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure and purified by silica gel column (eluate: acetone/n-hexane=1/1) to give tetraisopropyl-1-fluoro-3-hydroxypropylidene-1,1-bisphosphonate as a colorless oil (198 mg, yield 24%).
