Preparation of N-(4-((6S,8R)-7-(2,2-difluoropropyl)-8-methyl-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-3H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]isoquinolin-6-yl)-3-methoxyphenyl)azetidin-3-amine
Methanol (1 mL) and then HCl in dioxane (4 M; 1 mL, 4 mmol) were added sequentially to a flask charged with tert-butyl 3-((4-((6S,8R)-7-(2,2-difluoropropyl)-8-methyl-3-(tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-yl)-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-3H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]isoquinolin-6-yl)-3-methoxyphenyl)amino)azetidine-1-carboxylate (140 mg, 0.22 mmol). After 2 hours, the reaction was concentrated under reduced pressure and the resulting residue was purified using an SCX-2 cartridge that had been pre-treated with methanol. The compound was eluted first with methanol and then ammonia in methanol (3N). Product fractions were concentrated under reduced pressure to afford N-(4-((6S,8R)-7-(2,2-difluoropropyl)-8-methyl-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-3H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]isoquinolin-6-yl)-3-methoxyphenyl)azetidin-3-amine (91 mg, 92%) as a gum. The product was used in the next step without further purification.
