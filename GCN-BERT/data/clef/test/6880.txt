Step 1. tert-Butyl 3-(3-fluoro-4-(methoxycarbonyl)phenyl)-5-(2-fluoro-6-methoxyphenyl)-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-c]pyridine-1-carboxylate
tert-Butyl 5-(2-fluoro-6-methoxyphenyl)-3-iodo-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-c]pyridine-1-carboxylate (1.00 g, 2.131 mmol, Intermediate 5), (3-fluoro-4-(methoxycarbonyl)phenyl)boronic acid (0.506 g, 2.56 mmol), chloro(2-dicyclohexylphosphino-2',4',6'-triisopropyl-1,1'-biphenyl)[2-(2'-amino-1,1'-biphenyl)]palladium(II) (Pd XPhos G2) (280 mg, 0.36 mmol) and potassium phosphate (626 mg, 2.9 mmol) were placed in a flask and the flask was evacuated and backfilled with nitrogen three times. Then dioxane (20 mL) and degassed water (2 mL) were added and reaction was stirred at 90° C. for 2 h. After cooling to r.t., the reaction mixture was diluted with ethyl acetate, and the resulting mixture was washed with brine. The separated organic phase was dried over sodium sulfate. The solvents were evaporated in vacuo and the obtained crude product was purified by Biotage Isolera™ (835 mg, 79%).
