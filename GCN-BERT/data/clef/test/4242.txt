DESCRIPTION Natural skin-care product Technical field of the invention The present invention relates to the technical field of natural, fresh skin-penetrating skin-care products made of natural, raw ingredients. Background art Skin is the largest organ in the human body. To perform its function and to regenerate, it requires nutrition and rehydration from both inside and out. Disclosure of invention Skin-care products are generally composed of highly processed components and they often comprise only few isolated nutrients. This invention intends to solve the problem of lack of quality and quantity of nutrients in skin-care products by presenting a natural, fresh skin-care product, which is made of raw, wholesome ingredients including, among other things, plants, algae and fungi.

Micronutrients comprise diverse macrominerals, organic acids, trace minerals and vitamins. It is estimated that in nature there are about twenty-five thousand phytochemicals. Phytochemicals protect the cells from the toxic free radicals, which cause the oxidative stress.
