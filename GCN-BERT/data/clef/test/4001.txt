Step D: 3-(2-Chlorophenyl)-1-(4-methylphenyl)-1H-indazole-5-carboxylic acid
Methyl 3-(2-chlorophenyl)-1-(4-methylphenyl)-1H-indazole-5-carboxylate (115.4 mg, 0.306 mmol) was dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (1837 µl) and methanol (1225 µl) at 25 °C. 1 M sodium hydroxide (1225 µl, 1.225 mmol) was added and the reaction mixture heated to 50 °C for 25 min. The reaction was stopped, cooled to room temperature, quenched by addition of 1M hydrochloric acid (1.225 mL), and concentrated under reduced pressure. The title comopound (171.78 mg, 0.257 mmol, 84 % yield, with 4 equivalents of sodium chloride) was recovered as a white solid.
