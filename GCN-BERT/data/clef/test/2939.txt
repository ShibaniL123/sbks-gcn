Technical Field The present invention relates to a process for preparing an organic semiconductor containing a compound formed from a leaving substituent-containing compound which is synthesized in a simple manner, which has high solubility, and which has substituents able to be efficiently eliminated upon application of external energy; to a process for preparing a film containing the organic semiconductor; and to a process for preparing an organic electronic device containing the film. The leaving substituent-containing compound and the organic semiconductor of the present invention are useful, since organic electronic devices such as photoelectric conversion elements, thin-film transistor elements and light-emitting elements can be produced through a wet process using a solution. A method for producing a π-electron conjugated compound at high yield in a simple manner, the π-electron conjugated compound having a benzene ring and being produced by eliminating specific substituents from a π-electron conjugated compound precursor which is easily synthesized and has a cyclohexene ring with high solubility is described. The present invention also relates to a method for producing a film-like product containing the compound. The methods for producing the benzene ring-containing π-electron conjugated compound and the film-like product containing the π-electron conjugated compound are useful in the production of organic electronics such as organic electronic devices (organic electroluminescence (EL) elements, organic semiconductors and organic solar cells) as well as the production of films of organic pigments and dyes. Background Art In recent years, organic thin-film transistors using organic semiconductor materials have been intensively studied and developed. Hitherto, organic semiconductive materials of low molecular weight have been reported, such as acene materials (e.g., pentacene) (see, for example, PTL 1 and NPL 1). It has been reported that the organic thin-film transistors including an organic semiconductive layer formed of the aforementioned pentacene has relatively high charge mobility. However, these acene materials have extremely low solubility to common solvents. Therefore, these materials need to be vacuum-deposited to form a thin film as an organic semiconductive layer of an organic thin-film transistor. For this reason, these materials do not meet the demand in the art, which is to provide an organic semiconductive material that can be formed into a thin film by a simple wet process such as coating or printing. As one of the acene-based materials such as pentacene, 2,7-diphenyl[1]benzothieno[3,2-b][1]benzothiophene having the following Structural Formula (1) (see PTL 2 and NPL 2), which is a derivative of benzothieno[3,2-b]benzothiophene, is deposited on a substrate having been treated with octadecyltrichlorosilane, so that the deposited product exhibits a mobility comparable to that of pentacene (approximately 2.0 cm2/V·s) and has prolonged stability in the atmosphere. However, this compound also needs to be vacuum-deposited similar to pentacene. Thus, this material also does not meet the demand in the art, which is to provide an organic semiconductive material that can be formed into a thin film by a simple process such as coating or printing. The organic semiconductor materials can be easily formed into a thin film by a simple process such as a wet process, for example, printing, spin coating, ink jetting, or the like. The thin-film transistors using organic semiconductor materials also have an advantage over those using inorganic semiconductor materials in that the temperature of the production process can be lowered. Thus, a film can be formed on a plastic substrate having a generally low heat resistance, so that electronic devices such as displays can be reduced in weight and cost. Further, the electronic devices are expected to be widely used by taking advantage of flexibility of the plastic substrate. Moreover, 2,7-dialkyl[1]benzothieno[3,2-b][1]benzothiophene represented by the following General Formula (2), having liquid crystallinity and high solubility, can be applied by spin coating or casting (see PTL 2 and NPL 3). This compound is also a derivative which exhibits a mobility comparable to that of pentacene (approximately 2.0 cm2/V·s) when thermally treated at a temperature equal to or lower than the temperature at which the compound shows a liquid crystal phase (about 100°C). However, the temperature at which this compound shows a liquid crystal phase is relatively low; i.e., about 100°C, and the film formed therefrom may be changed through thermal treatment after film formation. Thus, this compound poses a problem in process adaptability in production of organic semiconductor devices. In recent years, a method of producing a field-effect transistor is reported, wherein a low-molecular-weight compound having high solvent solubility is used as a semiconductor precursor, which is dissolved in a solvent and the like, and applied so as to form a film by a coating process, and then the film is transformed to an organic semiconductor film. Intensive studies have been made on methods of converting the precursor to pentacene, a porphyrin-based compound, and a phthalocyanine-based compound through retro-Diels-Alder reaction (see, for example, PTLs 3 to 5 and NPLs 4 to 7). As described in NPL 4, the charge mobility of organic semiconductor materials depends on the orderly molecular arrangement (e.g., crystallization) in organic material films. When a vapor-deposition method is employed, the molecular arrangement of the materials in the films can be surely obtained. Meanwhile, the organic materials with molecular arrangement generally have a low solubility to an organic solvent. That is, in the organic material films, the semiconductive property and film formability (through coating) are generally in a trade-off relation. Thus, in only one possible method for attaining both satisfactorily, after a coating film has been formed from a coating liquid containing a semiconductor precursor having a solubility-imparting group, the precursor in the coating film is converted to an organic semiconductor material. When the disclosures of these literatures are deductively considered having such meanings, it can be said that these literatures have contributed in some degree to the improvement of the technology. However, in the above-described example, a tetrachlorobenzene molecule or other molecules are eliminated from the pentacene precursor. Here, tetrachlorobenzene has a high boiling point and is hard to be removed from the reaction system. Additionally, there is concern for its toxicity. Also, both porphyrin and phthalocyanine require complicate syntheses, and thus are used in narrow applications. Therefore, there is a need to develop a substituent-containing compound that can be synthesized in a simple manner. Also, it has been proposed that, by applying an external stimulus to a precursor having a high solvent-solubility and sulfonate-based substituents so that the substituents are eliminated and substituted with hydrogen atoms, the precursor is converted to phthalocyanine (see, for example, PTL 6). However, in this method, the sulfonate-based substituents have a high polarity and thus do not have sufficient solubility to an organic solvent having no polarity. In addition, sulfonic acid (eliminated component) has a high boiling point and difficult to remove from the reaction system. Furthermore, the temperature for conversion of the precursor is relatively high; i.e., at least 250°C to 300°C or higher, which is disadvantageous. Also, it has been proposed that, by applying a thermal stimulus to a nitroester so that their substituents are eliminated, the nitroester is converted to a naphthalene derivative (see, for example, NPLS 8). However, nitroesters such as nitroglycerine and nitrocellulose are unstable and explosive, and thus, such compounds are difficult to store for a long period of time. Also, it has been proposed that an alkyl group-containing carboxylate is introduced to the end β-position of an oligothiophene for imparting solubilization, and then heat is applied to eliminate the carboxylate, thereby obtaining an olefin-substituted oligthiophene or an olefin-substituted [1]benzothieno[3,2-b][1]benzothiphene (see, for example, PTLs 7 and 8 and NPL 7). In this method, the elimination occurs by heating to about 150°C to about 250°C, and the converted compound has at its ends olefin groups (e.g., a vinyl group and a propenyl group) which involve cis-trans isomerization due to heat or light. Thus, the resultant material is problematically degraded in purity and/or crystallinity. In addition, such highly reactive olefin end groups allow the compound to decrease in stability to oxygen or water. Furthermore, one olefin group is thermally polymerized with another olefin group at higher temperatures. In the above-described conventional compounds, there have been problems regarding solubility of the precursors, safety of the eliminated components, the conversion temperatures, and stability of the converted compounds. Also, it is difficult to obtain desired intermediate compounds in the synthesis processes of the conventional compounds. π-Electron conjugated compounds, having a moiety in which double bonds and single bonds are alternatingly located, have a highly extended π-electron conjugation system, and thus, are excellent in hole transportability and electron transportability. Thus, such π-electron conjugated compounds have been used as electroluminescence materials and organic semiconductor materials (see, for example, PTLs 1 and 2 and NPLs 1 and 2) as well as organic dyes and pigments. The π-electron conjugated compounds widely used involve the following problem, for example. Specifically, most of the π-electron conjugated compounds are rigid and highly planar, and thus the intermolecular interaction is very strong. As a result, these compounds have poor solubility to water or organic solvents. For example, the organic pigments made of such conjugated compounds are unstable in dispersion due to aggregation of the pigments. Also, taking an example electroluminescence materials and organic semiconductor materials made of such conjugated compounds, a wet process (using a solution) is difficult to employ since the conjugated compounds are sparingly soluble. As a result, vapor phase-film formation (e.g., vacuum vapor deposition) is required to elevate the production cost and complicate the production process which is disadvantageous. Considering the coating on a larger area and the attainment of higher efficiency, the π-electron conjugated compounds are required to be applicable to wet processes using a coating liquid previously prepared by dissolving materials in a solvent (e.g., spin coating, blade coating, gravure printing, inkjet coating and dip coating). Meanwhile, the fact that intermolecular contact, rearrangement, aggregation and crystallization are easily attained since intermolecular interaction is very strong contributes to conductivity of the compounds. In general, the film-formability and the conductivity of the obtained film are often in a trade-off relation. This is one cause making difficult to employ the π-electron conjugated compounds. In order to overcome the above-described problems, it has been proposed that an external stimulus is applied to an organic compound precursor (including π-electron conjugated compound precursors) having reactive substituents (which impart the solubility to the precursor) to thereby eliminate the substituents to obtain a compound of interest (see, for example, PTLs 9 and 10 and NPL 9). In this method, for example, a pigment precursor having a structure in which an amino group or an alcoholic or phenolic hydroxyl group is modified with a t-butoxycarbonyl group (a t-Boc group) is heated or treated otherwise to thereby eliminate the t-Boc group. However, some limitation is imposed on the compound employable in this method, since the substituent must be bonded to the nitrogen atom or oxygen atom. In addition, further improvement has been required in terms of stability of the precursor. Meanwhile, in recent years, intensive studies have been made on a method of applying an external stimulus to a precursor having solvent-soluble bulky substituents so that the solvent-soluble bulky substituents are eliminated, and converting the precursor to a pentacene, a porphyrin-based compound, and a phthalocyanine-based compound (see, for example, PTLs 3 and 4, NPLs 4, 5, 6 and 7). However, in the above-described example, a tetrachlorobenzene molecule or other molecules are eliminated from the pentacene precursor. Here, tetrachlorobenzene has a high boiling point and is hard to be removed from the reaction system. Additionally, there is concern for its toxicity. Also, both porphyrin and phthalocyanine require complicate syntheses, and thus are used in narrow applications. Therefore, there is a need to develop a substituent-containing compound that can be synthesized in a simple manner. Also, it has been proposed that, by applying external stimulus to a precursor having a high solvent-solubility and sulfonate-based substituents so that the substituents are eliminated and substituted with hydrogen atoms, whereby the precursor is converted to phthalocyanine (see, for example, PTL 6). However, in this method, the sulfonate-based substituents have a high polarity and thus do not have sufficient solubility to an organic solvent having no polarity. In addition, the temperature for conversion of the precursor is relatively high; i.e., at least 250°C to 300°C or higher, which is disadvantageous. Also, it has been proposed that an alkyl group-containing carboxylate is introduced to the end of an oligothiophene for imparting solubilization, and then heat is applied to eliminate the carboxylate, thereby obtaining an olefin-substituted oligthiophene (see, for example, PTL 7 and NPL 8). In this method, the elimination occurs by heating to about 150°C to about 250°C, and the converted compound has at its ends olefin groups (e.g., a vinyl group and a propenyl group) which involve cis-trans isomerization due to heat or light. Thus, the resultant material is problematically degraded in purity and/or crystallinity. In addition, such highly reactive olefin end groups allow the compound to decrease in stability to oxygen or water. Furthermore, one olefin group is thermally polymerized with another olefin group at higher temperatures.

Examples of the monovalent organic group represented by each of R1 to R5 and Q1 to Q6 further include a heteroaryl group (preferably, 5- or 6-membered substituted or unsubstituted, aromatic or non-aromatic heterocyclic groups (e.g., a 2-furyl group, a 2-thienyl group, a 3-thienyl group, a 2-thienothienyl group, a 2-benzothienyl group and a 2-pyrimidyl group)). Examples of the monovalent organic group represented by each of R1 to R5 and Q1 to Q6 further include an alkoxyl group and a thioalkoxyl group (preferably, substituted or unsubstituted alkoxyl groups and thioalkoxyl groups such as groups obtained by introducing an oxygen atom or a sulfur atom into the above-exemplified alkyl, alkenyl and alkynyl groups. Examples of the monovalent organic group represented by each of R1 to R5 and Q1 to Q6 further include an aryloxy group and a thioaryloxy group (preferably, substituted or unsubstituted aryloxy groups and thioaryloxy groups such as groups obtained by introducing an oxygen atom or a sulfur atom the above-exemplified aryl group. Examples of the monovalent organic group represented by each of R1 to R5 and Q1 to Q6 further include a heteroaryloxy group and a heterothioaryloxy group (preferably, substituted or unsubstituted heteroaryloxy groups and heterothioaryloxy groups such as groups obtained by introducing an oxygen atom or a sulfur atom into the above-exemplified heteroaryl groups), a cyano group, a hydroxyl group, a nitro group, a carboxylic group, a thiol group, an amino group (preferably, an amino group, substituted or unsubstituted alkylamino groups, substituted or unsubstituted anilino groups such as an amino group, a methylamino group, a dimethylamino group, an anilino group, an N-methyl-anilino group and a diphenylamino group; an acylamino group (preferably, a formylamino group, a substituted or unsubstituted alkylcarbonylamino group and a substituted or unsubstituted arylcarbonylamino group (e.g., a formylamino group, an acetylamino group, a pivaloylamino group, a lauroylamino group, a benzoylamino group and a 3,4,5-tri-n-octyloxyphenylcarbonylamino group)) and an aminocarbonylamino group (preferably, a substituted or unsubstituted aminocarbonylamino group (e.g., a carbamoylamino group, an N,N-dimethylaminocarbonylamino group, an N,N-diethylaminocarbonylamino and a morpholinocarbonylamino group))). As described above, the monovalent organic group represented by Q1 or Q2 may be the same group as represented by R1 to R5, but Q1 or Q2 preferably represents an aryl group or heteroaryl group which may have a substituent, more preferably the groups Q1 and Q2 are bonded to form a ring. Examples of the ring formed by the groups Q1 and Q2 include the followings. The groups Q3 to Q6 may be the same groups as the groups Q1 and Q2. However, as shown in the following General Formulas (IV) and (V), preferably, one or more of Q3 to Q6 are the above-exemplified aryl group or heteroaryl group; or one or more pairs of (Q3) Q4), (Q4, Q5) and (Q5, Q6) form a ring which is the above-exemplified aryl or heteroaryl group. In General Formulas (IV) and (V), Ar represents an aryl group or a heteroaryl group which may have a substituent. Preferred examples thereof include a benzene ring, a thiophene ring, a pyridine ring, a pyrazine ring, a pyrimidine ring, a triazine ring, a pyrrol ring, a pyrazole ring, an imidazole ring, a triazole ring, an oxazole ring, a thiazole ring, a furan ring, a selenophene ring and a silole ring. More preferably, Ar is at least one π-electron conjugated compound selected from the group consisting of (i) aromatic hydrocarbon rings, aromatic heterocyclic rings, compounds in which one or more aromatic hydrocarbon rings are ring-fused with one or more aromatic heterocyclic rings, compounds in which two or more aromatic hydrocarbon rings are ring-fused together, and compounds in which two or more aromatic heterocyclic rings are ring-fused together; and (ii) compounds in which one or more aromatic hydrocarbon rings are linked via covalent bond with one or more aromatic heterocyclic rings, compounds in which two or more aromatic hydrocarbon rings are linked together via a covalent bond, and compounds in which two or more aromatic heterocyclic rings are linked together via a covalent bond. Further, π electrons contained in the aromatic hydrocarbon rings or aromatic heterocyclic rings are preferably delocalized throughout the ring-fused or linked structure by the interaction as a result of ring-fused linkage or covalently bonding. Here, the "covalent bond" may be, for example, a carbon-carbon single bond, a carbon-carbon double bond, a carbon-carbon triple bond, an oxyether bond, a thioether bond, an amide bond and an ester bond, with a carbon-carbon single bond, a carbon-carbon double bond and a carbon-carbon triple bond being preferred. The number of the aromatic hydrocarbon rings or aromatic heterocyclic rings which are ring-fused or linked together via a covalent bond is preferably two or more. Specific examples thereof include naphthalene, anthracene, tetracene, chrycene and pyrene (the following General Formula Ar3), pentacene and thienothiophene, (the following General Formula Ar1), thienodithiophene triphenylene, hexabenzocoronene and benzothiophene (the following General Formula Ar2), benzodithiophene and [1]benzothieno[3,2-b][1]benzothiophene (BTBT) (the following General Formula Ar4), dinaphto[2,3-b:2',3'-f] [3,2-b]thienothiophene (DNTT) and benzodithienothiophene (TTPTT) (the following General Formula Ar5), fused polycyclic compounds such as naphthodithienothiophene (TTNTT) (the following General Formulas Ar6 and Ar7), and oligomers of aromatic hydrocarbon rings and aromatic heterocyclic rings such as biphenyl, terphenyl, quaterphenyl, bithiophene, terthiophene and quaterthiophene; phthalocyanines; and porphyrins. Also, in the above General Formulas, n is an integer of 1 or more and is the number of the solvent-soluble substituents linked to the group Ar. In General Formula (IV), n is the number of the solvent-soluble substituents linked via a covalent bond with the group Ar. Also, in General Formula (V), n is the number of the solvent-soluble substituents ring-fused with the group Ar. Needless to say, n depends on the number of atoms able to be substituted or ring-fused in the group Ar. For example, an unsubstituted benzene ring has up to 6 positions at which it can be linked via a covalent bond with the solvent-soluble substituent(s), and has up to 6 sites at which it can ring-fused with the solvent-soluble substituent(s). However, the lower limit of n is preferably 2 considering the size of the compound (group) Ar itself, solubility, molecular symmetry and easy synthesis. When n is too large, the solvent-soluble substituents cause stearic hindrance between themselves, which is not preferred. In addition, a change in volume before or after elimination reaction may be large. Therefore, the upper limit of n is preferably 4 considering molecular symmetry, easy synthesis and appropriate solubility. The acyloxy groups (X1, X2) or (Y1, Y2) preferably have a structure represented by the following General Formula (VI). When n is 1, General Formula (VI) is the following General Formula (VI-1). And, the acyloxy groups (X1, X2) or (Y1, Y2) do not form a ring and are present independently. When n is 2, General Formula (VI) is the following General Formula (VI-2). And, the acyloxy groups (X1, X2) or (Y1, Y2) form a ring. The group represented by R5 is described above. In particular, R5 preferably represents a hydrogen atom (excluding the case where n is 2 in General Formula (V)), a substituted or unsubstituted alkyl group, a substituted or unsubstituted alkenyl group, a substituted or unsubstituted alkynyl group, a substituted or unsubstituted alkoxyl group, a substituted or unsubstituted thioalkyl group, a substituted or unsubstituted aryl group, a substituted or unsubstituted heteroaryl group, a cyano group, with a hydrogen atom (excluding the case where n is 2 in General Formula (V)), a substituted or unsubstituted alkyl group, a substituted or unsubstituted alkoxyl group and a substituted or unsubstituted thioalkyl group being more preferred, with a substituted or unsubstituted alkyl group and a substituted or unsubstituted alkoxyl group being most preferred. In addition to halogen atoms, eliminated components X1-Y1 and X2-Y2 may be, for example, carboxylic acids obtained by substituting the oxygen-containing bond of the above-exemplified acyloxy groups with a hydrogen atom and carbonate half esters thereof (e.g., formic acid, acetic acid, pyruvic acid, propionic acid, butylic acid, valeric acid, isovaleric acid, pivalic acid, caproic acid, lauric acid, stearic acid, monochloroacetic acid, monofluoroacetic acid, difluoroacetic acid, 2,2-difluoropropionic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, 3,3,3-trifluoropropionic acid, pentafluoropropionic acid, cyclopropanoic acid, cyclobutanoic acid, cyclohexanoic acid, benzoic acid, p-methoxybenzoic acid, pentafluorobenzoic acid, methyl hydrogencarbonate, ethyl hydrogencarbonate, isopropyl hydrogencarbonate and hexyl hydrogencarbonate). These carbonate half esters are generally unstable, and thus, may be decomposed into corresponding alcohols (e.g., mehtanol, ehtanol, 2-propanol and hexanol) and carbon dioxide. The group (substituent) represented by R5 in General Formula (V) is not particularly limited. From the viewpoints of solvent solubility and film formability, it is advantageous that the substituent selected reduces intermolecular interaction to a certain extent and enhances affinity to a solvent. Meanwhile, when the volume before or after elimination of the substituents is considerably changed, there is a concern on problematic unevenness in coating of a thin film through elimination reaction. Therefore, the substituent used is preferably smaller in size to the greatest extent possible while maintaining appropriately solubility. Further, R5 preferably represents an electron-attracting substituent (e.g., a halogen-containing alkyl group and a cyano group-containing group) with which the carbonyl oxygen is negatively charged to a larger extent, since elimination reaction can be efficiently performed (although the reason for this is still unclear). As described above, the leaving substituent-containing compound contains leaving solvent-soluble substituents which impart solvent solubility to the leaving substituent-containing compound. In the present invention, the term "solvent solubility" means that a compound shows a solubility of 0.05% by mass or more, preferably 0.1% by mass or more, more preferably 0.5% by mass or more, most preferably 1.0% by mass, when a solvent to which the compound is added is heated under reflux and then cooled down to room temperature. Also, the solvent solubility of the π-electron conjugated compound represented by A-(C)n varies with a combination of substituents A and B. Here, the term "solvent insolubilization" means that the solvent solubility of a compound is reduced by one digit figure or more. Specifically, when a solvent to which the compound is added is heated under reflux and then cooled down to room temperature, it is preferable to reduce the solvent solubility from 0.05% by mass or more to 0.005% by mass or less; more preferably from 0.1% by mass or more to 0.01% by mass or less; particularly preferably from 0.5% by mass or more to less than 0.05% by mass; most preferably from 1.0% by mass or more to less than 0.1% by mass. And, the term "solvent insolubility" means that a compound shows a solubility of less than 0.01% by mass, preferably 0.005% by mass or less, more preferably 0.001% by mass or less, when a solvent to which the compound is added is heated under reflux and then cooled down to room temperature. The type of the solvent used for measuring the "solvent solubility" and "solvent insolubility" is not particularly limited. An actually used solvent may be used at an actually set temperature for the measurement of the solvent solubility. In addition, THF, toluene, chloroform, methanol, other solvents may be used at 25°C for the measurement of the solvent solubility. Note that a solvent usable in the present invention should not be construed as being limited to these solvents. The solubility greatly changes before or after conversion through elimination reaction. As a result, even when another film is immediately formed on the underlying film made of the compound exhibiting such solubility, the underlying film does not tend to be abraded by the solvent used for the formation of the another film. Thus, the compound used for the present invention is useful in production processes for organic electronic devices such as organic thin-film transistors, organic EL elements and organic solar cells. The following compounds will be given as specific examples of the leaving substituent-containing compound. The leaving substituent-containing compound should not be construed as being limited thereto. Also, it is easily supposed that there are several stereoisomers of the leaving substituent-containing compound depending on the steric configuration of the acyloxy groups, and that the following compounds are mixtures of such stereoisomers.

Next will be given specific examples of the specific compound produced from the above-exemplified leaving substituent-containing compounds. The specific compound of the present invention should not be construed as being limited thereto.

From a compound having a cyclohexene ring structure represented by General Formula (I), eliminating components represented by General Formulas (IIa) and (IIb) are eliminated, so that the compound having a cyclohexene ring structure is converted into a specific compound represented by General Formula (Ia). There are several isomers represented by General Formula (I) depending on the steric configuration of the substituents. However, these isomers are all converted into the specific compound represented by General Formula (Ia), and have the same eliminated components as in the compound represented by General Formula (I). It is preferred that X1 and Y1 or X2 and Y2 be located on the same side with respect to the cyclohexene ring plane, that is, form a so-called cis configuration, from the standpoints of efficiency of elimination reaction, conversion temperature, and reaction yield. (X1, X2) and (Y1, Y2) which are groups eliminated from the compound represented by General Formula (I) are defined as leaving substituents, and X1-Y1 and X2-Y2 are defined as eliminated components. The eliminated components may be solid, liquid, or gas. In view of removal of the eliminated components to the outside of a system, the eliminated components are preferably liquid or gas, particularly preferably gas at normal temperature, or solid or liquid formed into gas at a temperature for performing elimination reaction. A boiling point of the liquid eliminated component in an atmospheric pressure (1,013 hPa) is preferably 500°C or lower. From the viewpoint of easiness of removal of the eliminated component to the outside of the system, and the temperature of decomposition and sublimation of a π-electron conjugated compound to be generated, the boiling point is more preferably 400°C or lower, particularly preferably 300°C or lower. Hereinafter, one embodiment, in which (X1, X2) represent the same acyloxy groups; (Y1, Y2) and R1 to R4 represent hydrogen atoms; R6 represents a substituted or unsubstituted alkyl group or a substituted or unsubstituted alkoxy group, will be described. However, the leaving substituent-containing compound of the present invention will not be limited thereto. In the above reaction, from a cyclohexene ring structure represented by General Formula (VII), two carboxylic acids each having an alkyl chain represented by General Formula (IX) are eliminated, as the eliminated components, to thereby be converted into a structure having a benzene ring represented by General Formula (VIII). In the case where R6 is a substituted or unsubstituted alkoxy group, carbonate half ester (IX) is unstable, and may be decomposed to alcohol (IX-1) and carbon dioxide (IX-2) as shown above. An outline of a mechanism of the eliminating component eliminated from the compound represented by General Formula (VII) will be described below. As shown in General Formula (VII), a six-membered cyclic transition state is established, and 1,5-transposition of a hydrogen atom on β-carbon to an oxygen atom on carbonyl occurs, thereby causing concerted elimination reaction. A carboxylic acid is eliminated from the cyclohexene ring structure, and the cyclohexene ring structure is converted into a benzene ring structure represented by General Formula (VIII). In the case where several stereoisomers are present, the above described reaction proceeds even though the reaction rates varied depending on the stereoisomers. However, it is preferred that an acyloxy group and a hydrogen atom are located on the same side with respect to the cyclohexene ring plane, namely, form cis configuration from the standpoints of efficiency of elimination reaction, conversion temperature, and reaction yield. Since removal and transition of the hydrogen atom on the β-carbon are the first step of the reaction, the higher the degree of the negative polarization of an oxygen atom is, the easier the reaction occurs. Thus, the force of removing a hydrogen atom becomes larger, possibly thereby reducing necessary energy for causing elimination reaction. The degree of the negative polarization of an oxygen atom is changed, for example, according to the type of the alkyl chain in the side chain, or by replacing the oxygen atom with a chalcogen atom such as selenium, tellurium, and polonium which belong to the same group 16 as the oxygen atom does. Examples of the energies applied for performing elimination reaction include heat, light and electromagnetic wave. Heat or light is preferred in terms of reactivity, yield or post treatment. Particularly preferred is heat. Alternatively, heat and light can be used in combination. When heat and light are used in combination, these may be used at the same time, or sequentially. Alternatively, in the presence of acid or base, the aforementioned energies may be applied. Generally, elimination reaction depends on the structure of a functional group. However, most cases of elimination reaction need heating from the standpoints of reaction speed and reaction ratio. Examples of heating methods for performing elimination reaction include, but not limited thereto, a method for heating on a support, a method for heating in an oven, a method for irradiation with microwave, a method for heating by converting light to heat using a laser beam, and a method using a photothermal conversion layer. Heating temperature for performing elimination reaction may be a room temperature (approximately 25°C) to 500°C. In consideration of thermal stability of the materials and a boiling point of the eliminated components as to the lower limit of the temperature, and in consideration of energy efficiency, percentage of the presence of unconverted molecule, and the decomposition of π-electron conjugated compound after conversion as to the upper limit of the temperature, the temperature is preferably 40°C to 500°C. Moreover, in consideration of thermal stability of synthesis of the precursor, the decomposition and sublimation temperatures of π-electron conjugated compound after conversion, the temperature is more preferably 80°C to 400°C, and particularly preferably 80°C to 300°C. Here, the sublimation temperature is defined as a temperature at which the mass reduction of 5%, preferably 3% or less, and more preferably 1.0% from initial mass in TG-DTA is observed. As to the heating time, the higher the temperature is, the shorter the reaction time becomes. The lower the temperature is, the longer the time required for elimination reaction becomes. Heating time depends on the reactivity and amount of the leaving substituent-containing compound, and is generally 0.5 min to 120 min, preferably 1 min to 60 min, and particularly preferably 1 min to 30 min. In the case where light is used as the external stimulus, for example, infrared lamp or irradiation of light of wavelength absorbed by a compound (for example, exposure to light of wavelength 405 nm or less) may be used. On this occasion, a semiconductor laser may be used. Examples of semiconductor laser beam include a near-infrared region laser beam (generally, a laser beam of wavelength around 780 nm), a visible laser beam (generally, a laser beam of wavelength in the range of 630 nm to 680 nm), and a laser beam of wavelength of 390 nm to 440 nm. Particularly preferable laser beam is a laser beam having a wavelength region of 390 nm to 440 nm, and a semiconductor laser beam having a laser emission wavelength of 440 nm or less is preferably used. Among these semiconductor laser beam, examples of preferable light sources include a bluish-violet semiconductor laser beam having an emission wavelength region of 390 nm to 440 nm (more preferably from 390 nm to 415 nm), and a bluish-violet SHG laser beam having a center emission wavelength of 425 nm that has been converted to a half wavelength of the infrared semiconductor laser beam having a center emission wavelength of 850 nm by using an optical waveguide element. The above described acid or base serves as a catalyst of elimination reaction, and conversion can be performed at lower temperature. A method of using the acid or base is not particularly limited. Examples of the method include a method in which the acid or base may be directly added to the leaving substituent-containing compound, a method in which the acid or base is dissolved in any solvent to form a solution, and the solution is added to the leaving substituent-containing compound, a method in which the vaporized acid or base is heated to add the leaving substituent-containing compound, and a method in which a photoacid generator and a photobase generator are used, and followed by light irradiation, to thereby obtain an acid and base in the reaction system. Examples of the acids include, but not limited thereto, hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, sulfuric acid, acetic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, trifluoromethanesulfonic acid, 3,3,3-trifluoropropionic acid, formic acid, phosphoric acid and 2-butyl octanoic acid. Particularly preferred are volatile acids having high acidity, such as hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, trifluoroacetic acid, and trifluoromethanesulfonic acid. Examples of the photoacid generators include ionic photoacid generators such as sulfonium salt, and an iodonium salt; and nonionic photoacid generators such as imide sulfonate, oxime sulfonate, disulfonyl diazomethane, and nitrobenzyl sulfonate. Examples of the bases include, but not limited thereto, hydroxides such as sodium hydrate, potassium hydrate, carbonates such as sodium hydrogen carbonate, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, amines such as triethylamine and pyridine, and amidines such as diazabicycloundecene, diazabicyclononene. Examples of photobase generators include carbamates, acyloximes, and ammonium salts. Elimination reaction is preferably performed in a volatile acid or base atmosphere from the standpoint of easiness of removal of the acid or base to the outside of the system after reaction. Elimination reaction can be performed in an ambient atmosphere regardless of the absence or presence of the catalyst. Elimination reaction is preferably performed in an inert gas atmosphere or reduced pressure in order to reduce any influence of side reaction such as oxidation or influence of moisture, and to promote removal of an eliminated component to outside the system. In addition to the aforementioned carboxylate, examples of the leaving substituents include, but not limited thereto, a halogen atom, esters such as carbonate, xanthate ester, sulfonate, phosphate, amine oxide, sulfoxide, and selenoxide having β-hydrogen. In addition to the method of obtaining carboxylate by reacting the alcohol described below with carboxylic acid chloride or carboxylic acid anhydride, or through exchange reaction between a halogen atom and silver carboxylate or carboxylic acid-quaternary ammonium salt, examples of methods for forming the leaving substituents include, but not limited thereto, a method in which phosgene is reacted with alcohol so as to obtain carbonate, a method in which alcohol is reacted with carbonate half esters such as alkyl chloroformate, etc. so as to obtain carbonate, a method in which carbon disulfide is added in alcohol, and alkyl iodide is reacted therewith to obtain xanthate ester, a method in which tertiary amine is reacted with hydrogen peroxide or carboxylic acid so as to obtain amine oxide, and a method in which ortho selenocyano nitrobenzene is reacted with alcohol so as to obtain selenoxide. (Method for producing Leaving Substituent-Containing Compound) The leaving substituent-containing compound is characterized by having a cyclohexene skeleton and an acyloxy group (this structural portion is called as a soluble substituent). Since the soluble substituent is sterically bulky but not stiff, the crystallinity is poor. Thus, a molecule having such structure excels in solubility, and has properties of easily obtaining a film having low crystallinity (amorphous), when a solution containing this structure is applied. Next, a method for forming a halogen atom and an acyloxy group in the cyclohexene skeleton of the soluble substituent will be specifically described. The leaving substituent-containing compound can be derived from a compound having the cyclohexene skeleton represented by General Formula (X), which can be produced by the conventional method and used as a raw material. From the viewpoint of elimination reaction mode of the present invention, it is preferred that at least one hydrogen atom be located at positions 1 and 4 and/or positions 2 and 3. in General Formula (X), R1 to R4 are the same as described above. Next, as shown in General Formula (XI), by using a brominating agent, positions 1 and 4 and/or positions 2 and 3 are selectively halogenated. From the viewpoint of reactivity in the post step, an atom to be halogenated is preferably an iodine atom, a bromine atom, and a chlorine atom, and particularly preferably a bromine atom. Examples of the brominating agent include N-bromosuccinimide, N-iodosuccinimide, and N-chlorosuccinimide. The brominating agent is preferably used in combination with a radical initiator, such as azobisisobutyronitrile, benzoyl peroxide, or the like. A solvent is not necessarily used, but various organic solvents can be used. Particularly, benzene, carbon tetrachloride are preferably used. The reaction temperature may be appropriately selected from room temperature to a reflux temperature of a solvent. The thus obtained halogenated product may be used as the leaving substituent-containing compound. Next, as shown in General Formula (XII), to a dihalogenated product obtained by the above reaction, two equivalents of silver carboxylate or carboxylic acid quaternary ammonium salt is made to act on, so as to obtain a compound of interest in which positions 1 and 4 and/or positions 2 and 3 are acyloxylated. Alternatively, one equivalent of silver carboxylate or one equivalent of carboxylic acid quaternary ammonium salt is alternately made to act on a dihalogenated product so as to obtain an unsymmetrical compound. However, since there is a possibility that the reaction speed in elimination reaction may largely vary, the carboxylic acids used are preferably the same. A plurality of stereoisomers can be generated depending on the reaction conditions or the structure of carboxylic acid used. Specifically, a racemic mixture and a meso form may be obtained at any ratio, depending on a steric configuration of an acyloxy group bonded with a cyclohexene ring. Elimination reaction may be outstandingly retarded, depending on a steric configuration of an acyloxy group and a hydrogen atom at positions 1 and 4 and/or positions 2 and 3. Thus, preferred configuration is a configuration for accelerating the reaction as fast as possible. That is, the positional relation between the substituents at positions 1 and 4 and/or positions 2 and 3 are preferably in a cis form, in which the substituents are located on the same side of the cyclohexene plane. On the other hand, even though the substituents are in a trans form, the reaction proceeds, but reaction speed is very slow. Thus, applicability of the trans form is low. The isomers can be separated by chromatography by recrystallization or using an optimally active fixed bed. Examples of the silver carboxylate salt include silver acetate, silver trifluoroacetate, a 3,3,3-trifluoropropionic acid silver salt. Examples of carboxylic acid quaternary ammonium salt include salt formed by tetramethylammonium hydroxide pentahydrate and the aforementioned carboxylic acid (for example, acetic acid, lactic acid, valeric acid, propionic acid, pivalic acid, caproic acid, stearic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, 3,3,3-trifluoropropionic acid). As a solvent, various organic solvents, such as dimethylformamide, dimethyl sulfoxide, tetrahydrofuran, acetone, toluene, and the like can be used. From the viewpoint of reaction speed and prevention of secondary reaction, anhydrous solvents are preferably used. The reaction temperature may be room temperature to a reflux temperature of a solvent. In order to prevent secondary reaction, such as elimination reaction, the reaction temperature is preferably 50°C or lower, more preferably 25°C (room temperature) or lower. in General Formula (XII), Acy denotes an acyl group; R1 to R4 are the same as described above. When the carbonate structure is synthesized, it is easy to use alkyl chloroformate in terms of material relation. As shown in General Formula (XV), the acyloxy compound is preferably converted into diol which has been hydrolyzed with bases or the like. An acyl group used in the present invention is preferably acetate or propionate, which are easily hydrolyzed. In General Formula (XV), as the solvent, alcohol, acetone, dimethylformamide or the like are preferably used. As the base, strong base, such as lithium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, potassium carbonate, sodium hydride, sodium methoxide, or the like are preferably used. The reaction temperature is preferably 0°C to approximately room temperature in order to prevent secondary reaction. Thereafter, as shown in General Formula (XVI), a hydroxyl group is acylated. In General Formula (XVI), the solvent is not particularly limited as long as it does not react with alkyl chloroformate and sufficiently dissolves a reactant. Examples thereof include tetrahydrofuran, pyridine, dichloromethane, chloroform, and toluene. Sufficiently dehydrated thereof are preferably used. Moreover, a base is preferably added to the solvent in order to remove hydrogen chloride generated upon reaction. Examples of the base include pyridine, triethylamine, diisopropylamine, diisopropylethylamine, and N,N-dimethylaminopyridine. These may be used as a solvent, or used in combination thereof. As one example, the combination of pyridine or triethylamine with N,N-dimethylaminopyridine is preferable. Examples of alkyl chloroformate include methyl chloroformate, ethyl chloroformate, propyl chloroformate, isopropyl chloroformate, and isobutyl chloroformate. The reaction temperature is preferably 0°C to approximately room temperature from the standpoints of reactivity and selectivity. Thus, the carbonate structure can be formed. The thus obtained soluble substituent is ring-fused by various conventional methods, so as to synthesize a leaving substituent-containing compound. When the leaving substituent-containing compound is used as an organic semiconductor precursor compound, for example, heteroacenes are ring-fused in the following scheme according to a method described in J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2007, 129, pp. 2224-2225. 1,4 Diacyloxy-6-iodo-1,2,3,4 tetrahydronaphthalene can be synthesized according to Synthesis Example. As a first step, a Grignard exchange reaction is performed between an iodine atom and a Grignard reagent. Because of cryogenic reaction temperature and high reactivity of iodine, the Grignard exchange reaction selectively occurs so as to obtain a Grignard reagent. To the Grignard reagent, a formylation agent, such as dimethylformamide or morpholine, is added so as to perform formylation. The second step is ortho-lithiation of a formyl group. Since amine and lithium added at the same time form a complex with the formyl group, the ortho position (position 7 of tetrahydronaphthalene) is selectively lithiated without impairing other functional groups. To the lithiated formyl group, dimethyl sulfide is added, so as to form a SMe group. Thereafter, in the third step, the formyl groups are subjected to McMurry Coupling reaction. The reaction is performed in the presence of zinc and titanium tetrachloride. Therefore, the formyl groups are coupled to form an olefin structure. In the final step, ring-closing reaction with iodine is performed. Iodine is attached to a double bond portion, reacted with the SMe group, and eliminated in the form of MeI, to thereby form two thiophene rings. Thus, a desired ring-fused compound can be obtained. Pentacene is ring-fused in accordance with the method described in J. Am. Chem Soc., 129, 2007, pp. 15752. In the case of phthalocyanines, ring formation reaction can be performed in accordance with "Phthalocyanine -chemical and function-", Hirofusa Shirai, Nagao Kobayashi, 1997, (IPC) pp. 1 to 62, and "Phthalocyanine as a functional dye" Ryo Hirohashi, Keiichi Sakamoto, Eiko Okumura, 2004 (IPC) pp. 29 to 77. Porphyrins are ring-fused in accordance with the method described in JP-A No. 2009-105336. The leaving substituent-containing compound is bonded via a covalent bond to other skeletons of the solvent-soluble substituents (B in General Formula (XIV)) by known methods for coupling reaction. Examples of the known coupling reactions include Suzuki coupling reaction, Stille coupling reaction, Kumada coupling reaction, Negishi coupling reaction, Hiyama coupling reaction, Sonogashira reaction, Heck reaction and Wittig reaction. Of these, Suzuki coupling reaction and Stille coupling reaction are particularly preferred in terms of easy derivatization of an intermediate, reactivity and yield. For formation of carbon-carbon double bond, Heck reaction, and Wittig reaction are preferable in addition to the above-described reactions. For formation of carbon-carbon triple bond, Sonogashira reaction is preferable in addition to the above-described reactions. Hereinafter, an embodiment in which a carbon-carbon bond is formed by Suzuki coupling reaction and Stille coupling reaction will be described. The reaction is performed using a combination of a halogenated product with a trifluoro triflate product, or a combination of a boronic acid derivative with an organotin derivative. However, in the case where the compounds represented by General Formula (XV) and (XVI) are both a halogenated product and a triflate product, or a boronic acid derivative and an organotin derivative, coupling reaction does not occur. Such cases are excluded. In the mixture described above, base is further added only in the case of Suzuki coupling reaction, and the mixture is reacted in the presence of a palladium catalyst. Ar-(A)1 General Formula (XIII) in General Formula (XIII), Ar denotes an aryl group or a heteroaryl group, as described above; A denotes a halogen atom (a chlorine atom, a bromine atom, or an iodine atom), a triflate (trifluoromethanesulfonyl) group, boronic acid or ester thereof, or an organotin functional group; 1 denotes an integer of 1 or more. B-(C)k General Formula (XIV) in General Formula (XIV), B denotes a solvent soluble substituent as described above; C denotes a halogen atom (a chlorine atom, a bromine atom, or an iodine atom), a triflate (trifluoromethanesulfonyl) group, boronic acid or ester thereof, or an organotin functional group; k denotes an integer of 1 or more. In the synthesis method by Suzuki coupling reaction, Stille coupling reaction, among halogenated products or triflate products in General Formulas (XIII) and (XIV), iodine products, bromine products, and triflate products are preferable, from the standpoint of reactivity. As the organotin functional group in General Formulas (XIII) and (XIV), a derivative having an alkyl tin group such as a SnMe3 group or a SnBu3 group can be used. The derivatives can be easily obtained in such a manner that hydrogen or a halogen atom in a desired position is replaced with lithium or a Grignard reagent using an organic metal reagent such as n-butyllithium, followed by quenching using trimethyltin chloride or tributyltin chloride. As the boronic acid derivative, in addition to a boronic acid, a boronic ester derivative may be used. The boronic ester derivative is synthesized from a halogenated derivative using bis(pinacolato)diboron which has thermal stability and is easily handled in air, or synthesized by protecting boronic acid with diol such as pinacol. As described above, either the substituent A or the substituent B may be halogen and a triflate product, or a boronic acid derivative and an organotin derivative. From the standpoints of easiness of derivatization and reduction of secondary reaction, it is preferred that the substituent A be a boronic acid derivative and an organotin derivative. For the Stille coupling, reaction base is not necessary, while for the Suzuki coupling reaction base is necessary, and a relatively weak base, such as Na2CO3, or NaHCO3 contributes to a good result. In the case where steric hindrance effects on the reaction, a strong base such as Ba(OH)2, K3PO4 or NaOH is effective. Additionally, caustic potash and metal alkoxides, such as potassium t-butoxide, sodium t-butoxide, lithium t-butoxide, potassium 2-methy-2-butoxide, sodium 2-methy-2-butoxide, sodium methoxide, sodium ethoxide, potassium ethoxide and potassium methoxide may be also used as the bases. Moreover, organic bases such as triethylamine may be also used.

Example of the ligands include triphenylphosphine, trimethylphosphine, triethylphosphine, tris(n-butyl)phosphine, tris(tera-butyl)phosphine, bis(tert-butyl)methylphosphine, tris(i-propyl)phosphine,tricyclohexylphosphine, tris(o-tolyl)phosphine, tris(2-furyl)phosphine, 2-dicyclohexylphosphinobiphenyl, 2-dicyclohexylphosphino-2'-methylbiplienyl, 2-dicyclohexylphosphino-2',4',6'-triisopropyl-1,1'-biphenyl, 2-dicyclohexylphosphino-2',6'-dimethoxy-1,1'-biphenyl, 2-dicyclohexylphosphino-2'-(N,N'-dimethylamino)biphenyl, 2-diphenylphosphino-2'-(N,N'-dimethylamino)biphenyl, 2-(di-tert-,butyl)phosphine-2'-(N,N'-dimethylamino)biphenyl, 2-(di-tert-butyl)phosphinobiphenyl, 2-(di-tert-butyl)phosphino-2'-methylbiphenyl, diphenylphosphino ethane, diphenylphosphino propane, diphenylphosphino butane, diphenylphosphino ethylene, diphenylphosphino ferrocene, ethylenediamine, N,N',N",N"'-tetramethylethylenediamine, 2,2'-bipyridyl, 1,3-diphenyldihydro imidazolylidene, 1,3-dimethyl dihydroimidazolylidene, diethyl dihydroimidazolylidene, 1,3-bis(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)dihydroimidazolylidene and 1,3-bis(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)dihydroimidazolylidene. A palladium catalyst in which any of these ligands coordinates can be used as a cross coupling catalyst. A reaction solvent preferably has no functional group reactive with a raw material and can appropriately dissolve the raw material. Examples thereof include: water; alcohols and ethers such as methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, butanol, 2-methoxyethanol, 1,2-dimethoxyethane, bis(2-methoxyethyl)ether; cyclic ethers such as dioxane, tetrahydrofuran benzene; toluene; xylene; chlorobenzene; dichlorobenzene dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO); N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF); N,N-dimethylacetamide; N-methylpyrrolidone; and 1,3-dimethyl-2-imidazolidinone. These solvents may be used alone or in combination. Moreover, it is preferred that these solvents be preliminarily dried and deaerated. The temperature of the above-described reaction may be appropriately set depending on the reactivity of a raw material used or a reaction solvent. It is generally 0°C to 200°C. However, the upper limit of the temperature is preferably a boiling point or lower of the solvent in any case. Additionally, the temperature is preferably set at a temperature at which elimination reaction occurs or lower in terms of yield. The lower limit of the temperature may be a melting point of the solvent. However, when the temperature is excessively low, the reaction speed is outstandingly lowered, and it is not preferable. Specifically, it is preferably 0°C to 150°C, more preferably 0°C to 100°C, and particularly preferably room temperature to 80°C. The reaction time of the above reaction may be approximately set depending on the reactivity of a raw material used. It is preferably 1 hour to 72 hours, and more preferably 1 hour to 24 hours. The thus obtained leaving substituent-containing compound represented by Ar-(B)m (m is an integer of 1 or more) is used by removing impurities such as the catalyst used for reaction, unreacted raw materials, or by-products generated upon reaction such as boronic acid salts, organotin derivatives or the like. For the purification, conventionally known methods may be used, for example, reprecipitation, column chromatography, adsorption, extraction (including Soxhlet extraction), ultrafiltration, dialysis, use of scavenger for removing a catalyst, or the like. Like the compound of the present invention, materials having excellent solubility reduce limitation of these purification method. As a result, such materials favorably effect on device properties. In order to deposit a thin film from the leaving substituent-containing compound obtained by the above-described production method, conventionally known film deposition methods may be used, for example, spin coating, casting, dipping, inkjetting, doctor blade casting, screen printing, vacuum deposition, or sputtering. Any of these methods enables to deposit a good thin film having excellent strength, toughness, durability and the like without cracks. Moreover, an external stimulus is applied to the film of the leaving substituent-containing compound of the present invention deposited by the film deposition method, so as to eliminate a soluble substituent, thereby depositing an organic semiconductor film. The leaving substituent-containing compound may be used as various materials for functional elements such as photoelectric conversion elements, thin-film transistor elements, light-emitting elements and the like, (Application of Leaving Substituent-Containing Compound to Device) An organic semiconductor compound produced from the leaving substituent-containing compound can be used in an electronic device. Examples of the electronic devices include devices having two or more electrodes in which current and voltage between the electrodes are controlled by electricity, light, magnetism, chemical materials or the like; and apparatuses for generating light, electrical field, or magnetic field by application of voltage or current. Moreover, examples thereof include elements for controlling current or voltage by application of voltage or current, elements for controlling voltage or current by application of magnetic field, and elements for controlling voltage or current by action of a chemical material. For control, rectification, switching, amplification, oscillation or the like are used. As a device currently realized using an inorganic semiconductor such as silicon or the like, resistors, rectifiers (diode), switching elements (transistor, thyristor), amplifying elements (transistor), memory elements, chemical sensors or the like, combinations of these elements, integrated devices, or the like are exemplified. Additionally, solar batteries in which electromotive force generated by light, photodiodes for generating photocurrent, photoelements such as phototransistors or the like are used. As an electronic device, to which the leaving substituent-containing compound and the organic semiconductor compound of the present invention produced by using the leaving substituent-containing compound are applied, an organic thin-film transistor, namely organic field effect transistor (OFET) is exemplified. Hereinafter, field effect transistor (FET) will be specifically described. Structure of Transistor FIGS. 4A to 4D show schematic structures of organic thin-film transistors of the present invention. An organic semiconductor layer 1 of the organic thin-film transistor contains the organic semiconductor compound. The organic thin-film transistor of the present invention includes a first electrode (source electrode 2), a second electrode (drain electrode 3) and a third electrode (gate electrode 4), which are provided on a support (substrate) (not shown) with being separated each other. A gate insulating film 5 may be provided between the gate electrode 4 and the organic semiconductor layer 1. The organic thin-film transistor is configured to control the current flowing through the organic semiconductor layer 1 between the source electrode 2 and the drain electrode 3 by applying voltage to the gate electrode 4. It is important for a switching element to largely modulate the amount of the current flowing between the source electrode 2 and the drain electrode 3 by the conditions of applying voltage from the gate electrode 4. This means that large current flows depending on the drive state of the transistor, and no current flows in non drive state of the transistor. The organic thin-film transistor of the present invention may be formed on the substrate. As the substrate, a typical substrate formed of, for example, glass, silicon, plastic or the like may be used. A conductive substrate can be used to serve as the gate electrode. The gate electrode and the conductive substrate may be layered. However, a plastic sheet is preferably used as the substrate in case where a device, to which the organic thin-film transistor is, applied, is expected to have properties such as flexibility, lightweight, lower production cost and shock resistance. Examples of the plastic sheets include films of polyethylene terephthalate, polyethylene naphthalate, polyether sulfone, polyetherimide, polyether ether ketone, polyphenylene sulfide, polyarylate, polyimide, polycarbonate, cellulose triacetate, and cellulose acetate propionate. Film Deposition Method: Organic Semiconductor Layer Additionally, the leaving substituent-containing compound is used as an organic semiconductor precursor, and the organic semiconductor precursor is dissolved in a solvent such as dichloromethane, tetrahydrofuran, chloroform, toluene, chlorobenzene, dichlorobenzene and/or xylene, and applied on a substrate so as to deposit a thin film. The application of an energy to the thin film formed of the organic semiconductor precursor, to thereby converted into an organic semiconductor film. The leaving substituent-containing compound has a cyclohexane structure and an acyloxy group, which is sterically bulky, and poor crystallinity. A molecule having such structure excels in solubility and has properties of easily obtaining a film having low crystallinity (amorphous), when a solution containing the molecule is applied. Examples of methods for depositing the thin films include spray coating, spin coating, blade coating, dipping, casting, roll coating, bar coating, dye coating, inkjetting and dispensing; printing methods such as screen printing, offset printing, relief printing, flexographic printing; soft lithography such as a micro contact printing. Moreover, these methods may be used in combination. From the above-described deposition methods and solvents, a deposition method and solvent may be appropriately selected according to materials. The organic semiconductor material which has been thermally converted can deposit a film through vapor phase, such as vacuum deposition. In the organic thin-film transistor of the present invention, the thickness of the organic semiconductor layer is not particularly limited, and the thickness of the organic semiconductor layer is so selected as to deposit a uniform thin film, namely, a thin film having no gaps and holes that adversely affect the carrier transportation characteristics of the organic semiconductor layer. The thickness of the organic semiconductor layer is generally 1 µm or less, and particularly preferably 5 nm to 100 nm. In the organic thin-film transistor of the present invention, the organic semiconductor layer deposited from the above mentioned compounds is formed in contact with the source electrode, the drain electrode, and the insulating film. Film Deposition Method: Post Treatment of Organic Semiconductor Film The properties of the organic semiconductor film converted from the precursor-containing thin film can be improved by post treatment. For example, deformation of the film caused during film deposition can be reduced by heat treatment. This heat treatment enhances the crystallinity, and the properties are improved and stabilized. Moreover, the organic semiconductor film is placed in an organic solvent (such as toluene and chloroform), so that the deformation of the film can be reduced in the same manner as in heat treatment, and the crystallinity can be further enhanced. Moreover, by exposing the organic semiconductor film to oxidizing or reducing air and/or liquid, such as oxygen, hydrogen, etc. properties can be changed by oxidization or reduction. The oxidization or reduction is used for the purpose of increasing or decreasing the density of carrier in the film.

Of the conductive materials described above, materials having a low electric resistance at the surface in contact with the semiconductor layer are preferred for the source electrode and drain electrode. Examples of methods for forming an electrode include a method in which a conductive thin film, which has been deposited using the material mentioned above by deposition or spluttering, is formed into an electrode by a known method such as a photolithographic method or liftoff technology; and a method in which an electrode is formed by etching a resist on a metal foil of, for example, aluminum and copper, by thermal transfer, inkjet or the like. In addition, an electrode may be formed by directly patterning by inkjet printing using a solution or dispersion liquid of a conductive polymer or a dispersion liquid of conductive particles, or may be formed from a coated layer by lithography or laser ablation. It is also possible to use a method in which an ink, conductive paste, etc. containing conductive polymers or conductive particles are patterned by a printing method such as relief printing, intaglio printing, planographic printing or screen printing. The organic thin-film transistor of the present invention can have an extraction electrode from each electrode if necessary. Insulating Film The insulating film used in the organic thin-film transistor of the present invention is formed of various materials for insulating film. Examples thereof include the inorganic insulating materials such as silicon oxide, silicon nitride, aluminum oxide, aluminum nitride, titanium oxide, tantalum oxide, tin oxide, vanadium oxide, barium-strontium-titanium oxide, barium-titanium-zirconium oxide, lead-zirconium-titanium oxide, lead lanthanum titanate, strontium titanate, barium titanate, barium magnesium fluoride, bismuth-niobium-tantalum oxide and yttrium trioxide. Additionally, examples thereof include polymer compounds such as polyimides, polyvinyl alcohols, polyvinyl phenols, polyesters, polyethylene, polyphenylenesulfides, unsubstituted or halogen atom substituted polyparaxylylene, polyacrylonitrile and cyanoethylpullulan. These insulating materials may be used in combination. The insulating material is not particularly limited, and it is preferred to select an insulating material having a high dielectric constant and a low conductivity. Examples of the methods of depositing the insulating film using the insulating materials include dry deposition processes such as a chemical vacuum deposition (CVD), a plasma CVD, a plasma polymerization and vapor deposition; and wet coating processes such as spray coating, spin coating, dip coating, inkjetting, casting, blade coating and bar coating. Modification of Interface between Organic Semiconductor and Insulating Film (HMDS, etc.) In the organic thin-film transistor of the present invention, the organic thin film may be provided between the insulating film, electrode and the organic semiconductor layer to improve adhesiveness thereof, decrease gate voltage and reduce leak current. The organic thin film is not particularly limited as long as the organic thin film does not have a chemical effects on an organic semiconductor layer. For example, an organic molecular film and a polymer thin film can be used. In the case of the organic molecular film, coupling agents such as octyltrichlorosilane, octadecyl trichlorosilane, hexamethylene disilazane and phenyltrichlorosilane, benzenethiol, trifluorobenzenethiol, perfluorobenzenethiol, perfluorodecanethiol, etc. may be used. In addition, as the polymer thin film, the aforementioned polymer insulating materials can be used, and these may function as a sort of the insulating film. This organic thin film may be subject to an anisotropic treatment by rubbing or the like. Protective Layer The organic thin-film transistor of the present invention can be stably driven in the atmosphere. If necessary, a protective layer can be provided in terms of protection from mechanical destruction and moisture and/or gas, and protection for integration of a device for convenience. Applied Device The organic thin-film transistors of the present invention can be utilized as an element for driving various known image display elements such as liquid crystal, electroluminescence, electrochromic, and electrophoretic migration. When such elements are integrated, it is possible to produce a display referred to as "electronic paper". The display device includes liquid crystal display elements in the case of a liquid display device, organic or inorganic electroluminescence display elements in the case of an EL display device, and electrophoresis display elements in the case of an electrophoresis display device, and a plurality of such display elements are aligned in the form of matrix in X direction and Y direction to construct the display device using the aforementioned display element as one display picture element (i.e. one pixel). The display element is equipped with the organic thin film transistor of the present invention as a switching element for applying voltage or supplying a current to the display element. The display device includes the same number of the switching elements to the number of the display element, i.e. the number of the display picture elements (i.e., the pixels). The display element contains, other than the switching elements, members such as a substrate, an electrode (e.g., a transparent electrode), a polarizer, and a color filter. These members are suitably selected from those known in the art depending on the intended purpose without any restriction. When the display device forms a certain image, only certain switching elements selected from all the switching elements provided in the matrix form turn on or off for applying voltage or a current to the corresponding display elements. When voltage or a current is not applied to the display elements, all the switching elements remain the state of OFF or ON. The display device can display the image at high speed and high contrast by having such configuration. Note that, the display device displays an image by the conventional display operation known in the art. For example, in the case of the liquid display element, the molecule alignments of the liquid crystals are controlled by applying voltage to the liquid crystals, to thereby display an image or the like. In the case of the organic or inorganic electroluminescence display element, a current is supplied to a light-emitting diode formed of an organic material or inorganic material to emit the organic or inorganic film, to thereby display an image or the like. In the case of the electrophoresis display element, voltage is applied to white coloring particles and black coloring particles each charged with the opposite polarity to each other to make the coloring particles electrically migrate in a certain direction. As a result, an image or the like is displayed. The display device can be produced by a simple process, such as a process of coating or printing the switching element, can use as a substrate, and a plastic substrate or paper that does not have sufficient resistance to a high temperature processing. Moreover, the display device having a large area can be produced at low energy and cost, as the switching elements can be formed at low energy and cost. Moreover, it is also possible to use an IC in which the organic thin-film transistors of the present invention are integrated as a device such as an IC tag.

Thus, the elimination reaction will be described in detail. In the production method of the present invention, a film containing the compound (precursor) having a cyclohexene ring structure represented by General Formula (I-2) is formed by, for example, coating on a substrate (support) such as a plastic substrate, a metal substrate, a silicon wafer and a glass substrate. Next, eliminated components represented by General Formulas (IIa-2) and (IIb-2) are eliminated from the compound (precursor) having the cyclohexene ring structure contained in the precursor-containing film, so that the compound (precursor) is converted to the compound having a structure represented by General Formula (II-2). There are several stereoisomers of the compound represented by General Formula (I-2) depending on the steric configuration of the substituents. However, each of the stereoisomers is converted to the compound represented by General Formula (II-2), and eliminated components are the same in each case. More preferably, substituents X1 and Y1 or substituents X2 and Y2 are located on the same side of the cyclohexene ring plane (cis-configuration) from the viewpoints of improving the efficiency of the elimination reaction, decreasing the conversion temperature, and increasing the reaction yield. The substituents (X1, X2) and (Y1, Y2) eliminated from the precursor represented by General Formula (I-2) are the same as described above in "Method for producing specific compound through elimination reaction of leaving substituent-containing compound." (Method for producing π-electron conjugated compound precursor) The method for forming a halogen group and acyloxy group in the cyclohexene skeleton of the solvent-soluble substituent is the same as described above in "Method for producing Leaving Substituent-Containing Compound." Also, the method for linking together via a covalent bond the π-electron conjugated substituent A and the solvent-soluble substituent B, which are used in the method for producing the precursor A-(B)m in the present invention, is the same as the method for bonding the solvent-soluble substituent to the other skeleton in the above-described leaving substituent-containing compound. (Electronic devices) The specific compound of the present invention can be used for the electronic devices described above in "(Application of Leaving Substituent-Containing Compound to Device." That is, the solvent used for preparing a coating liquid containing the precursor A-(B)m is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose. The solvent preferably has a boiling point of 500°C or lower since such solvent can be easily removed. However, highly volatile solvents are not necessarily preferred, and the solvent used preferably has a boiling point of 50°C or higher. Although thorough examination has not yet been conducted, for obtaining a sufficient conductivity, it is thought to be important that the precursors variously change in position for intermolecular contact as well as that the leaving groups in the precursor are simply eliminated. In other words, after the leaving groups (substituents) have been eliminated from the precursor present in the coating film, it is possibly required in the solvent that the resultant compounds be at least partially change in direction or position from a random state for intermolecular contact, rearrangement, aggregation, crystallization, etc. The solvent used may be, for example, those having affinity to a polar carboester group serving as an leaving group contained in the precursor A-(B)m. Specific examples thereof include polar (water-miscible) solvents such as alcohols (e.g., methanol, ethanol and isopropanol), glycols (e.g., ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol and propylene glycol), ethers (e.g., tetrahydrofuran (THF) and dioxane), ketones (e.g., methyl ethyl ketone and methyl isobutyl ketone), phenols (e.g., phenol and cresol), nitrogen-containing organic solvents (e.g., dimethyl formamide (DMF), pyridine, dimethylamine and triethylamine) and CELLOSOLVE (registered trademark) (e.g., methyl cellosolve and ethyl cellosolve). The solvent may also be those having relatively high affinity to the other structure than the leaving groups. Specific examples thereof include hydrocarbons (e.g., toluene, xylene and benzene), halogenated hydrocarbon solvents (e.g., carbon tetrachloride, methylene chlorine, 1,2-dichloroethane, 1,1,2-trichloroethane, trichloroethylene, chloroform, monochlorobenzene and dichloroethylidene), esters (e.g., methyl acetate and ethyl acetate) and nitrogen-containing organic solvents (e.g., nitromethane and nitroethane). These solvents may be used alone or in combination. In use, polar (water-miscible) solvents such as tetrahydrofuran (THF) are particularly preferably combined with water-immiscible solvents such as halogenated hydrocarbons (e.g., toluene, xylene, benzene, methylene chloride, 1,2-dichloroethane, chloroform and carbon tetrachloride) and esters (e.g., ethyl acetate). The amount of the organic solvent used is not particularly limited and may be appropriately determined depending on the intended purpose. The amount of the organic solvent is preferably 200 parts by mass to 200,000 parts by mass with respect to 1 part by mass of the precursor A-(B)m. Also, the coating liquid may further contain a resin component and a volatile or self-decomposable acid or base for promoting decomposition of the carboester group in such a small amount that the effects of the present invention cannot be impaired. Further, strongly-acid solvents such as trichloroacetic acid (which decomposes into chloroform and carbon dioxide with heating) and trifluoroacetic acid (volatile) are preferably used since the carboester group (weak Lewis acid) is readily removed in the presence of them. Also, by applying energy to the film containing the precursor of an organic semiconductor, the film can be converted to an organic semiconductor film. Examples Hereinafter, the present invention will be further described with the following Examples, which should not be construed as limiting the scope of the present invention. The identification of the compounds used in Examples was performed using a NMR spectrometer (JNM-ECX, manufactured by JEOL Ltd., 500 MHz), a mass spectrometer (GCMS-QP2010 Plus, manufactured by SHIMADZU CORPORATION), an elemental analyzer (CHN) (CHN coder MT-2, manufactured by Yanagimoto Mfg. Co., Ltd.), and an elemental analyzer (sulfur) (DX320 manufactured by Dionex Corporation, ion chromatography - anion analysis system). The purity of each compound was obtained by measuring the compound using a mass spectrometer (GCMS-QP2010 Plus, manufactured by SHIMADZU CORPORATION), or LCMS (LCT Premire and Alliance, manufactured by Waters), and calculating the purity thereof from ratios of peak areas.

The results of Examples 10 to 15 indicated that a sparingly soluble π-electron conjugated compound could be obtained at a high yield of 97% or more with a high purity of 99% or more only by heating and washing at approximately 200°C to approximately 250°C. It was found that the conversion temperature was approximately the sublimation temperature or lower of each compound. The sublimation temperature is defined as a temperature at which the mass of a compound reduces by 1%. For example, in FIG. 2, after termination of reduction of mass upon conversion, substantially horizontal line is observed at 300°C to 340°C in the graph. And, the mass is reduced by 1% or more at a temperature of 340°C or higher, and thus, it was considered that the compound was sublimated. It was indicated that the method was an effective method not only for the production of an organic solvent soluble low molecular weight compounds such as naphthalene, but also for production of a π-electron conjugated compound normally sparingly soluble in an organic solvent. These can be used in many molecules, such as pigments, organic semiconductor molecules, etc. Example 11 Evaluation of Solubility Each of Compound 11 to Compound 19 synthesized in Synthesis Example 3 was added to toluene, THF, anisole, and chloroform (each 2.0 mg), until the compound was not dissolved therein, and stirred for 10 minutes under reflux of the solvent, and cooled down to room temperature. The mixture was further stirred for 1 hour and left to stand for 16 hours, and the supernatant was filtered using a 0.2 µm-PTFE filter, to thereby obtain a saturated solution. The saturated solution was dried under reduced pressure, and the solubility of the precursor in each solvent was calculated. The results are shown in Table 1. Table 1SolventTolueneTHFAnisoleChloroformCompound 11AABACompound 12AAAACompound 13AABACompound 14BAAACompound 15AABACompound 16BABACompound 17DDDDCompound 18DDDDCompound 19DDDD In Table 1, A denotes that the solubility is 0.5% by mass or more; B denotes that the solubility is 0.1% by mass or more to less than 0.5% by mass; C denotes that the solubility is 0.005% by mass or more to less than 0.1% by mass; and D denotes that the solubility is less than 0.005% by mass. In any case using Compounds 11 to 16, the compound from which the precursor compound had undergone elimination (i.e., Compounds 17 to 19) under reflux of the solvent could not be confirmed. From Table 1, it was confirmed that the compounds had a solubility of approximately 0.1% by mass or more to the various solvents having different polarities. It was apparent that the compound had high selectivity of solvent in a coating process. Table 1 indicated that Compound 17, 18 and 19 which were converted materials had a solubility of 0.005% by mass or less to those solvents, and that the compound converted by elimination reaction became insoluble to the solvents. It was found that in the state of solution, the compound had thermal stability and storage stability, so that the compound is not decomposed even in reflux of anisole (154°C). The reason is not certain, but it is considered that when the distance between molecules is very close like a solid state, elimination easily occurs, but when there is a certain distance between molecules like in a solution state, elimination does not easily occur. Example 12 Observation of Elimination Behavior of Compound 11 Compound 11 (5 mg) synthesized in Synthesis Example 3 was heated on a silicon wafer which was placed on a hot plate set at given temperatures of 150°C, 160°C, 170°C, 180°C, 220°C, 230°C, 240°C, and 260°C for 30 minutes so as to prepare a sample. IR spectra (KBr method, SPECTRUM GX, manufactured by PerkinElmer, Inc.) of the sample, Compound 11 before heating and Compound 17 which had been converted were measured. The results are shown in FIG. 1. Under the heating condition at 240°C, -O- (1,156 cm-1) absorption and C=O (1,726 cm-1) absorption were disappeared, and new absorptions (810 cm-1, 738 cm-1, 478 cm-1, aromatic series) were confirmed. This was identified with the spectrum of Compound 17. Compound 11 was heated at a range of 25°C to 500°C at a temperature increase rate of 5°C/min and the pyrolysis behavior thereof was observed by TG-DTA (EXSTAR6000, manufactured by Seiko Instruments Inc.) using Al2O3 as a reference in a nitrogen airflow (200 mL/min). The results are shown in FIG. 2. In TG-DTA, 56.7% of mass reduction was observed from 160°C to 290°C, The mass reduced coincided substantially with that of 4 molecules of caproic acid (theoretical value: 54.2%). It was confirmed that a melting point was 357.7°C. This was identified with the melting point of Compound 17. These results showed that Compound 11 was converted to Compound 17 by heating. Moreover, these results showed that a threshold of elimination reaction was about 240°C. Example 13 Observation of Elimination Behavior of Compound 12 A sample was prepared, IR spectrum was measured, and a conversion temperature was estimated in the same manner as in Example 12, except that Compound 11 of Example 12 was replaced with Compound 12, and that the heating conditions were 170°C, 180°C, 200°C, 220°C, 240°C, 250°C, 260°C, 280°C, and 300°C. Under the heating condition at 280°C, -O- (1,156 cm-1) absorption and C=O (1,726 cm-1) absorption were disappeared, and new absorptions (810 cm-1, 738 cm-1, 478 cm-1, aromatic series) were confirmed. TG-DTA of Compound 12 was measured in the same manner as in Compound 11. In TG-DTA, 58.2% of mass reduction was observed from 250°C to 285°C. The mass reduced was somewhat larger than 4 molecules of pivalic acid (theoretical value: 51.0%). It was confirmed that a melting point was 357.2°C. This was identified with the melting point of Compound 17. These results showed that Compound 12 was converted to Compound 17 by heating. Moreover, these results showed that a threshold of elimination reaction was about 280°C. Example 14 Observation of Elimination Behavior of Compound 15 A sample was prepared, IR spectrum was measured, and a conversion temperature was estimated in the same manner as in Example 12, except that Compound 11 of Example 12 was replaced with Compound 15, and that the heating conditions were 180°C, 200°C, 220°C, 230°C, 240°C, 250°C, 260°C, and 280°C. Under the heating condition at 250°C, -O- (1,156 cm-1) absorption and C=O (1,726 cm-1) absorption were disappeared, and new absorptions (810 cm-1, 738 cm-1, 478 cm-1, aromatic series) were confirmed. This was identified with the spectrum of Compound 19. TG-DTA of Compound 15 was measured in the same manner as in Compound 11. In TG-DTA, 50.7% of mass reduction was observed from 200°C to 300°C. The mass reduced coincided substantially with four molecules of caproic acid (theoretical value: 48.5%). It was confirmed that a melting point was 358.2°C. This was identified with the melting point of Compound 19. These results showed that Compound 15 was converted to Compound 19 by heating. Moreover, these results showed that a threshold of elimination reaction was about 250°C. Example 15 Observation of Elimination Behavior of Compound 13 A sample was prepared, IR spectrum was measured, and a conversion temperature was estimated in the same manner as in Example 12, except that Compound 11 of Example 12 was replaced with Compound 13, and that the heating conditions were 180°C, 190°C, 200°C, 220°C, 230°C, and 240°C. Under the heating condition at 200°C, -O- (1,156 cm-1) absorption and C=O (1,726 cm-1) absorption were disappeared, and new absorptions (810 cm-1, 738 cm-1, 478 cm-1, aromatic series) were confirmed. This was identified with the spectrum of Compound 17. TG-DTA of Compound 13 was measured in the same manner as in Compound 11. In TG-DTA, 57.0% of mass reduction was observed from 180°C to 220°C. The mass reduced coincided substantially with 3,3,3-trifluoropropionic acid (theoretical value: 56.6%). It was confirmed that a melting point was 358.0°C. This was identified with the melting point of Compound 17. These results showed that Compound 13 was converted to Compound 17 by heating. Moreover, these results showed that a threshold of elimination reaction was about 200°C. From these Examples, the elimination behavior and the threshold temperature of elimination reaction could be estimated. It was confirmed that the π-conjugated core to be combined caused less effect, but that the temperature at which elimination reaction occurred changed depending on an alkyl chain introduced to an ester site. The higher the acidity (pKa) of an alkyl chain, namely carboxylic acid as an eliminated component was, the lower the elimination temperature was. The pivalic acid had an acidity of 5.0 pKa, the caproic acid had an acidity of 4.6 pKa, and the 3,3,3-trifluoropropionic acid had an acidity of 3.0 pKa. It was confirmed that a desired π-electron conjugated compound could be obtained by heating the compound of the present invention at approximately 250°C. It was considered that in Examples 12 to 14, the mass reduction of the found value was larger than that of the theoretical value, because Compounds 17 and 19 were relatively highly sublimated under the conditions of high temperature and nitrogen air flow, and the solvent was contained in the crystals of the precursor. Example 16 Production Example of Thin Film Each of Compounds 11, 14 and 15 (each 5 mg) synthesized in Synthesis Example 3 was dissolved in THF, so that the concentration of each compound became 0.1% by mass, and the mixture was filtered using a 0.2 µm-filter, to prepare a solution. Onto a N-type silicon substrate having a 300 nm-thick thermally-oxidized film, which had been soaked in concentrated sulfuric acid for 24 hours, 100 µL of the prepared solution was added dropwise, and then the substrate was covered with a petri dish and left to stand until the solvent was dried, to thereby form a thin film. The thin film was observed with a polarization microscope and a scanning probe microscope (NANOPICS, manufactured by Seiko Instruments Inc., contact mode,), and it was confirmed that a smooth and continuous amorphous film was obtained. Next, the thin film was subjected to annealing for 30 minutes at 250°C in an argon atmosphere. Then, the thin film was observed in the same manner as described above. After anneal treatment, a plurality of colored domains were observed with the polarization microscope, and it was confirmed that a smooth and crystalline film was obtained. The polarization microscope pictures of these films are shown in FIGS. 3A and 3B. These films were obtained because each of Compounds 11, 14 and 15 as precursors, in which an ester group which was a soluble group was eliminated, so that Compound 11, 14 and 15 were respectively converted into Compound 17, 18 and 19 having stronger intermolecular interaction, and became crystalline in the film. The thin film was insoluble in chloroform, THF, toluene, etc. at 25°C. Comparative Example 1 The preparation of a solution and production of a thin film of Comparative Example 1 were performed in the same manner as in Example 16, except that Compounds 11, 14 and 15 were replaced with Compound 17, 18 and 19, and that THF were replaced with dichlorobenzene heated at 150°C. In all films, crystals were precipitated in such a degree that it could be recognized by visual observation, and it was confirmed that noncontinuous film was formed. Under the polarization microscope, a plurality of noncontinuous colored domains were observed. Under the scanning probe microscope, a surface roughness of 100 µm or more was confirmed. These results indicated that the production method of the present invention was effective on thin film deposition using sparingly soluble compounds, which were slightly dissolved in some solvents each having a high boiling point. Example 17 Production and Evaluation of Organic Thin Film Transistor through Wet Process using Solution Thin film containing Compound 11 was produced in the same manner as in Example 16. The thin film was subjected to annealing for 30 minutes at 250°C in an argon atmosphere, so as to convert to a thin film formed of Organic Semiconductor Compound 1, and having a thickness of 50 nm. On the thin film, gold was vacuum deposited via a shadow mask under the condition of back pressure of up to 10-4 Pa, deposition rate of 1 Å/s to 2Å/s and film thickness of 50 nm, thereby forming source and drain electrodes having a channel length of 50 µm and channel width of 2 mm. Thus, a field-effect transistor (FET) element having a structure shown in FIG. 4D was produced. The organic semiconductor film and silicon oxide film in a region other than the gold electrodes were removed by scraping, and a conductive paste (manufactured by Fujikura Kasei Co., Ltd.) was applied in the region and the solvent was dried. Through the region, voltage was applied to the silicon substrate serving as the gate electrode. The electric property of the FET element was evaluated by a semiconductor parameter analyzer B1500A (manufactured by Agilent Technologies) under the measurement conditions of fixed source drain voltage: -100V, and gate voltage sweep: from -20V to +100V). The FET element exhibited a property as a p-type transistor element. The current and voltage (I-V) characteristics of the organic thin film transistor (FET element) is shown in FIG. 5. In FIG. 5, a white circle represents an absolute value of drain current on the left vertical axis, and a black circle represents a square root of the absolute value of drain current on the right vertical axis. The applied gate electrode is on the horizontal axis. From the saturation region of the current and voltage (I-V) characteristics of the organic thin film transistor, a field-effect mobility was obtained. The field-effect mobility of the organic thin-film transistor was calculated by the following equation. Ids=μCinW⁢Vg-Vth⁢2/2⁢L In the equation, Cin is a capacitance per unit area of a gate insulating film, W is a channel width, L is a channel length, Vg is a gate voltage, Ids is a source-drain current, µ is a field effect mobility and Vth is a gate threshold voltage at which a channel begins to be formed. Moreover, a ratio of an on-current at a gate voltage of 100 V to an off-current at a gate voltage of 0 V was obtained as a current on/off ratio. The results are shown in Table 2. As a result, a saturation mobility was 2.8 × 10-2 cm2/Vs, and a current on/off ratio was 3.0 × 107. Example 18 A FET element was produced, and then evaluation of properties was performed in the same manner as in Example 17, except that Compound 11 of Example 17 was replaced with Compound 14, and then a thin film was converted into a thin film formed of Organic Semiconductor Compound 2. The results are shown in Table 2. As a result, a saturation mobility was 4.3 × 10-2 cm2/Vs, and a current on/off ratio was 2.0 × 107. Example 19 A FET element was produced, and then evaluation of properties was performed in the same manner as in Example 17, except that Compound 11 of Example 17 was replaced with Compound 15, and then a thin film was converted into a thin film formed of Organic Semiconductor Compound 3. The results are shown in Table 2. As a result, a saturation mobility was 5.5 × 10-2 cm2/Vs, and a current on/off ratio was 4.1 × 107. Comparative Example 2 A thin film formed of Organic Semiconductor Compound 1 was produced on the same substrate as that in Example 17 using the dichlorobenzene solution described in Comparative Example 1, and then an FET element was produced, and evaluation of properties was performed. The results are shown in Table 2. Comparative Example 3 A thin film formed of Organic Semiconductor Compound 3 was produced on the same substrate as that in Example 17 using the dichlorobenzene solution described in Comparative Example 1, and then an FET element was produced, and evaluation of properties was performed. The results are shown in Table 2. Comparative Example 4 A thin film formed of Organic Semiconductor Compound 3 was produced on the same substrate as that in Example 17 using the dichlorobenzene solution described in Comparative Example 1, and then an FET element was produced, and evaluation of properties was performed. The results are shown in Table 2.

It was apparent that the organic thin film transistor of the present invention exhibited excellent hole mobility, current on/off ratio, and had excellent characteristics as an organic thin film transistor. Therefore, the leaving substituent-containing compound of the present invention, and the organic semiconductor compound obtained by using the leaving substituent-containing compound are useful for production of an organic electronic device, such as an organic thin film transistor. Industrial Applicability The leaving substituent-containing compound of the present invention is excellent in solubility in various organic solvents, and can synthesize a specific compound, and an organic semiconductor compound with high yield without generating olefin end-groups by elimination reaction occurred by application of energy, thereby having excellent processability. Since an organic semiconductor compound is a sparingly soluble, it is difficult to form a film. However, the leaving substituent-containing compound is used for film formation as an organic semiconductor compound precursor, followed by converting to an organic semiconductor compound with, for example, heat, thereby easily obtaining a continuous organic semiconductor film. Moreover, the organic semiconductor film can be patterned by removing unconverted portions by washing, thus, the film formed by using the leaving substituent-containing compound of the present invention may be applied to organic electronic devices, particularly, applied to electronic devices such as semiconductors, and optical electronic devices such as EL light-emitting elements, photoelectric conversion device such as thin film solar battery, dye-sensitized solar battery, electronic paper, various sensors, and radio frequency identifications (RFIDs). According to the production method of the present invention, a π-electron conjugated compound containing a benzene ring can be synthesized without generating olefin end-groups with high yield by elimination reaction occurred by application of energy, thereby having excellent processability. By using the production method of the present invention, a continuous film of a sparingly soluble compound can be usually obtained through a wet process using a solution, although a continuous film can be obtained only by vacuum-deposition using a sparingly soluble compound. This process may be applied to organic electronic devices, particularly, applied to electronic devices such as semiconductors, and optical electronic devices such as EL light-emitting elements, photoelectric conversion device such as thin film solar battery, dye-sensitized solar battery, electronic paper, various sensors, and radio frequency identifications (RFIDs).
