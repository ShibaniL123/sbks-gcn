CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS Not applicable. FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE Nickel-base superalloys for single crystal castings exhibiting a balanced combination of outstanding properties are disclosed. BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE There is a continuing demand for advanced gas turbines that achieve lower fuel burn rates and commensurate reduced carbon dioxide exhaust emissions. Therefore, there remains a pressing need for superalloys that can be cast into complex cooled turbine blades and vanes that are capable of operating at higher gas and metal temperatures. These castings desirably exhibit a combination of high strength, excellent high temperature, creep-rupture properties, and good phase stability. Single crystal nickel-base superalloys typically contain high levels of refractory elements such as molybdenum, tungsten, rhenium and tantalum in order to improve high temperature creep-rupture properties. However, high levels of these elements can result in topologically close-packed (TCP) phase formation during high temperature stressed exposure, which can be associated with the development of sites for premature crack initiation, resulting in a degradation of long term creep-rupture properties. As such, the selection of appropriate levels of refractory elements and chromium content involves a delicate balancing of strength properties against long term phase stability. The TCP phases are rhenium and tungsten rich with some chromium. Excessive formation of TCP phases de-alloy the material, thus lowering the creep-rupture strength. The highest strength nickel-base superalloys for single crystal castings for use in flight engines contain about 5% to about 7% rhenium by weight. These include CMSX-10K® and CMSX-10N® alloys, developed and available from Cannon-Muskegon Corporation and described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,366,645 and 5,540,790, and René N-6 alloy, developed by the General Electric Company. However, these specialty, high-strength nickel-base superalloys have exhibited certain undesirable features for particular applications. These alloys tend to develop a type of phase instability due to the high rhenium-content, which is known as a secondary reaction zone (SRZ) instability, that is observed in the base alloy adjacent to the coatings, which results in coating compatibility and thin-wall mechanical property issues. Additionally, CMSX-10K® and CMSX-10N® alloys have a very low chromium content (1.5% and 2.2% by weight respectively) to accommodate the high rhenium content, which consequently reduces low temperature internal oxidation resistance and hot corrosion resistance. These alloys also have high γ' solvus temperatures, requiring a very high temperature solution heat treatment, which can cause surface melting issues. These alloys also tend to have a relatively high density, which is a significant weight and inertia disadvantage for flight engines, especially for rotating turbine blades. These very high strength specialty alloys are also expensive due to the high price of rhenium, which has approximately quadrupled in the last 20 years. SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE The disclosed alloys were designed and developed to provide a single crystal casting with creep and fatigue properties similar to the very high strength nickel-base superalloys containing about 5% to about 7% rhenium by weight, but which contain substantially less rhenium, thereby eliminating SRZ phase instability issues, improving low temperature internal oxidation resistance and hot corrosion resistance, reducing the γ' solvus temperature, reducing density, reducing cost, and providing a combination of these advantages, and while also providing significantly improved high temperature creep-rupture properties as compared to a CMSX-4® alloy containing 3% rhenium by weight. The disclosed alloys exhibiting improved properties contain 5.60% to 5.80% by weight of aluminum; 9.4% to 9.8% by weight of cobalt; 3.2% to 3.9% by weight of chromium; 7.8% to 8.5% by weight of tantalum; 5.3% to 5.7% by weight of tungsten; 0.50% to 0.70% by weight of molybdenum; 4.3% to 4.9% by weight of rhenium; 0.75% to 0.90% by weight of titanium; 0.08% to 0.15% by weight of hafnium; less than 1.1 % by weight of tramp elements other than aluminum, cobalt, chromium, tantalum, tungsten, molybdenum, rhenium, titanium and nickel; and the balance nickel.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION The high strength nickel-base superalloys for single crystal casting of this disclosure will be designated "CMSX-4® PLUS" alloys. The alloy chemistry is developed from that of CMSX®-8 alloy (CM Tech Papers TMS Seven Spring Superalloy Symposium, Sept. 2012; and ASME Turbo Expo, Dusseldorf, June 2014). The CMSX®-8 alloy exhibits excellent single crystal castability and high temperature oxidation resistance. This 1.5% by weight rhenium containing alloy has creep-rupture properties close to but somewhat less than CMSX-4® alloy. Rhenium content was selected about 4% with the objective of providing a desirable balance between appreciably enhancing high temperature creep-rupture properties over CMSX-4®, and undesirably promoting SRZ phase occurrence under coatings and excessive TCP phase formation in turbine components during high temperature, stressed exposure. A Cr content of about 3% to about 4% was selected to promote low temperature oxidation and hot corrosion (sulfidation) resistance. The Mo content was critically left low at 0.60% to avoid oxidation issues. This necessitated using Ti in the alloy in range of 0.75 - 0.90% to ensure appropriate γ/γ' mis-match and interfacial chemistry and hence ensure approximately 0.5 µm cubic, aligned γ' for solutioned/homogenized and high temperature primary age heat treated microstructures. This maximizes creep-rupture properties. Ti also reduces alloy density. The Ti content additionally improves transformation potential as part of the raw material mix. Ta content was maintained as per CMSX®-8 alloy in the 8% regime to maximize single crystal castability/airfoil component casting yield, by minimizing propensity for "freckle-chain" grain defects and avoiding the necessity for unduly high W content (maintained in the 5.0 - 5.5% regime). High W encourages "freckle" formation and reduces oxidation resistance. Ta is also an active γ' former (simplified γ' composition Ni3 (Al, Ti, Ta)), besides being a powerful, large atom, solid solution strengthener. Hf was maintained at about 0.10% to ensure acceptable solution heat treat "windows" for these highly alloyed CMSX-4® Plus chemistry compositions. Hf improves coating performance under oxidizing conditions, but reduces incipient melting point greater than its reduction in γ' solvus temperature. This effect increases with higher Hf levels. The 470 lb 100% virgin (100V) VIM heats were made at Cannon-Muskegon Corporation using state of the art melting practices and very high purity materials for this alloy development program, which were all made with the following tight controls on deleterious trace elements: WtPPMAg< .4U< .5Bi< .1Th< 1Ga< 10Cd< .2Pb< .5Ge< 1Se< .5Pt< .005%Te< .2Au< .5T1< .2In< .2Sn< 2Na< 10Sb< 1K< 5As< 1Ca< 10Zn< 1Ba< 5Hg< 2Mg< 200 ppm CMSX-4® PLUS (MOD A) A 470 lb VIM heat (100V) [5V0603] was made in the CM V-5 furnace in February 2013.

Multi-step solutioning/homogenization and high temperature primary aging steps were researched to develop the microstructures shown in Figures 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16. The peak solution-homogenization temperature selected was 2435°F (1335°C) - (6 hrs) with primary age of 2085°F (1140°C) - (6 hrs). All single crystal specimen machining (low stress grinding) and creep-stress-rupture testing were undertaken by Joliet Metallurgical Labs, Joliet, Illinois. The creep-rupture properties attained with Mod A although improved compared to CMSX-4® up to 1922°C (1050°C), were well short of the target properties (Table 1 and Tables 4, 5 and 6). CMSX-4® PLUS (MOD B) To target higher creep-rupture properties, a 470 lb heat (100V) [5V0636] was made in the CM V-5 furnace in July 2013.

The full heat treatment conditions were "fine-tuned" from the previous Mod A work, with a peak solution/homogenization temperature of 2435°P (1335°C) - (6 hrs) and 2085°F (1140°C) (6 hrs) primary age. The density of the Mod B composition was determined by NPL in the UK to be 8.89 kg/dm3 compared to 9.05 for CMSX-10K® (6.3% Re) and 8.95 for PWA 1484 (3% Re). CMSX-4 ® PLUS (MOD C) To fully explore the potential of the chemistry development/performance concepts of this new alloy system, a further 470 Ib heat [100V] [5V0660] was made in the Cannon-Muskegon Corporation V-5 furnace in October 2013.

The metal temperature stress-rupture capability advantage of Mod C over standard CMSX-4® is 40°F (22°C) at 1800°F (982°C) and 50°F (28°C) for 1.0% creep capability (density corrected). At the 15.0 ksi/2050°F (103 MPa/1121°C) very high temperature test condition, the Mod C is equivalent to CMSX-4® which has very exceptional stress-rupture life at this test condition, but with improved rupture ductility (17 - 28% Elong (4D) and 38 - 39% RA) compared to CMSX-4®. Remarkably the density corrected creep-rupture properties of Mod C at 36.0 ksi/1800°F (248 MPa/982°C) are close to that of CMSX-10K® (6.3% Re) and superior at 15.0 ksi/2050°F (103 MPa/1121°). (Table 7). The heat treatment used a peak solution/homogenization step of 2435°F (1335°C) - (6 hrs) and two (2) differing primary ages (a) 2100°F (1149°C) - (6 hrs) and (b) 2125°F (1163°C) - (6 hrs) - all test bars for Mod A, B and C were given a final 1600°F - (20 hrs) age. It is apparent from Table 3 that the 2125°F (1163°C) primary age (note the higher Re content of Mod C at 4.8%) gives higher stress-rupture properties at 15.0 ksi/2050°F (103 MPa/1121°C) test conditions compared to the 2100°F (1149°C) primary age. The properties for both primary age conditions at 36.0 ksi/1800°F (248 MPa/982°C) are the same. The single crystal test bar molds were poured at + 30°F (17°C) over CMSX-4® conditions for the Mod B and C alloys, based on DSC liquidus data. The Mod A and Mod B single crystal test bars were pre-homogenized/partially solutioned with the following initial steps - 2395°F (1313°C)/2 hrs + 2405°F (1318°C)/2 hrs + 2415°F (1324°C)/2 hrs + 2425°F (1329°C)/2 hrs ---- prior to the selected 2435°F (1335°)/6 hrs AC, final peak step. The Mod B single crystal bars ex SMP SX foundry were given an additional 2440°F (1338°C)/2 hrs AC peak step to take into account the larger dendrite arm spacing of this mold of test bars. The Mod C single crystal bars were pre-solutioned as above, but with 6 hrs at the 2425°F (1329°C) step, prior to the final peak at 2435°F (1335°C)/6 hrs AC.

These data show excellent tensile properties at high temperatures, for strength and ductility. Figures 3 and 4 are Larson-Miller stress-rupture diagrams comparing the newly disclosed alloys (CMSX-4® PLUS [MOD B] alloy and CMSX-4® PLUS [MOD C] alloy) with well known commercially available nickel-base superalloys for single crystal casting (CMSX-4® alloy and RENÉ N-5 alloy). The illustrated results indicate that a substantial improvement in stress-rupture life for the disclosed alloys as compared with known alloys that are currently used and recognized as preferred materials for casting turbine components for high-temperature, high stress applications. The optical photographs (Figures 5 and 6) of a CMSX-4® PLUS (MOD A) single crystal test bar show no γ/ γ' eutectic phase and no incipient melting after being fully heat treated (i.e., solutioned and double aged). The scanning electron micrographs (Figures 7 and 8) of the CMSX-4® PLUS (MOD A) single crystal test bar that was fully heat treated (solutioned and double aged) shows aligned cubic γ' particles having a mean size of about 0.55 micrometers, indicating an appropriate γ/ γ' mis-match. The optical photographs (Figures 9 and 10) of a CMSX-4® PLUS (MOD B) single crystal test bar that was solutioned and primary aged shows very small amount of remnant γ/ γ' eutectic phase and no incipient melting. The scanning electron micrographs (Figures 11 and 12) of the CMSX-4® PLUS (MOD B) single crystal test bar that was solutioned and primary aged shows dark, aligned cubic γ' particles having a mean size of about 0.45, indicating an appropriate γ/ γ' mis-match. The optical photographs (Figures 13 and 14) of a CMSX-4® PLUS (MOD C) single crystal test bar that was fully heat treated (solutioned and primary aged for 6 hours at 2125°F (1163°C)) show a small amount of remnant γ/ γ' eutectic phase (the white spots), indicating no incipient melting. The scanning electron micrographs (Figures 15 and 16) of the CMSX-4® PLUS (MOD C) single crystal test bar that was fully heat treated shows dark, aligned cubic γ' particles having a mean particle size of about 0.45 micrometers, indicating an appropriate γ/ γ' mis-match. The optical photographs (Figures 17 and 18) of a CMSX-4® PLUS (MOD C) single crystal test bar that was fully heat treated (solutioned and primary aged for 6 hours at 2125°F (1163°C)), and stress-rupture tested at 15 ksi (103 MPa) and 2050°F (1121°C) for 669.7 hours life, shows minimal TCP linear dark etching phase, indicating good alloy phase stability. As shown in Figure 19, the CMSX-4® Plus MOD C alloy in accordance with this disclosure achieves a remarkable improvement in 1.0% creep as compared with a commercially available CMSX-4® alloy. As shown in Figure 20, the time to 1.0% creep is hundreds of hours greater for an alloy in accordance with this disclosure (CMSX-4® plus MOD C) than for a commercially available alloy (CMSX-4® alloy), and thousands of hours greater than for another commercially available alloy (CM 247 LC® alloy). As shown in Figure 21, a CMSX-4® Plus MOD C alloy exhibits substantially increased stress at rupture than commercially available alloys (CMSX-4® alloy and "René N-5" alloy). As shown in Figure 22, there is a relatively sharp increase in time to 2.0% creep for nickel base superalloys formulated for single crystal castings containing about 8% tantalum and from about 4.3% to 4.9% rhenium by weight, as compared with commercially available alloys containing about 8% tantalum and about 1.5% to about 3% rhenium by weight. As shown in Figure 23, there is a relatively gradual increase in time to 2.0% creep with increasingly higher weight percentages of rhenium (up to about 6%) for single crystal nickel base superalloys containing about 12% tantalum. As shown in Figure 24, there is a relatively sharp increase in time to rupture for nickel base superalloys formulated for single crystal casting containing about 8% tantalum and from about 4.3% to 4.9% rhenium by weight as compared with commercially available alloys containing about 8% tantalum and less than 2% rhenium by weight. As shown in Figure 25, the time to rupture is hundreds to thousands of hours greater for an alloy in accordance with this disclosure (CMSX-4® plus MOD C) to commercially available nickel base superalloys formulated for single crystal casting.
