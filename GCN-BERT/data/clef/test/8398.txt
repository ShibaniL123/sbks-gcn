Example 16: Synthesis of compound 11142, 1-isopropyl-N-phenyl-N-(4-(5-(trifluoromethyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl)benzyl)azetidine-3-carboxamide
N-phenyl-N-(4-(5-(trifluoromethyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl)benzyl)azetidine-3-carboxamide hydrochloride (0.100 g, 0.228 mmol), synthesized in Example 10, and acetone (0.025 mL, 0.342 mmol) were dissolved in dichloromethane (10 mL) at room temperature, and sodium triacetoxyborohydride (0.072 g, 0.342 mmol) was added to the solution, followed by stirring at the same temperature. Water was added to the reaction mixture, followed by extraction with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed with saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution, dried with magnesium sulfate anhydrous, filtered, and then concentrated under reduced pressure. The concentrate was purified by column chromatography (SiO2, 4 g cartridge; ethyl acetate/hexane = from 0% to 80%) and concentrated to give the title compound (0.056 g, 55.3%) as a white solid.
