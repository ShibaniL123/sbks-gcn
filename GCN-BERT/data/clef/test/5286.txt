Step 9: Preparation of tert-butyl (S)-1-(3-(benzyloxy)-6-fluoroquinoline-2-yl)ethyl)carbamate
1.90 g (6.41 mmol) of (S)-1-(3-(benzyloxy)-6-fluoroquinoline-2-yl)ethane)-1-amine prepared in step 8 was dissolved in anhydrous CH2Cl2 (15 mL), to which Boc2O (1.3 equivalent) was added at room temperature, followed by stirring for 2 hours. The reaction mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure. The obtained compound was separated by column chromatography (SiO2, eluent: hexane/ethyl acetate, 10/1-hexane/ethylacetate, 3/1) to give 2.52 g of the target compound tert-butyl (S)-1-(3-(benzyloxy)-6-fluoroquinoline-2-yl)ethyl)carbamate as a white solid (6.36 mmol, yield: 99%).
