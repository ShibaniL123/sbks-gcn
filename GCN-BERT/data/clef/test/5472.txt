LATIN NAME OF THE GENUS AND SPECIES Petunia sensu wijsman VARIETY DONOMINATION ‘DRAY305’ BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The new Petunia cultivar is a product of a planned breeding program conducted by the inventor, Gavriel Danziger, in Moshav Mishmar Hashiva, Israel. The objective of the breeding program was to produce new Petunia varieties for ornamental commercial applications. The cross resulting in this new variety was made during February of 2011. The seed parent is the unpatented, proprietary variety referred to as Petunia sensu wijsman. ‘cv. 10-4265’. The pollen parent is the unpatented, proprietary variety referred to as Petunia sensu wijsman ‘cv. 10-4253. The new variety was discovered in November of 2011 by the inventor in a group of seedlings resulting from the 2011 crossing, in a research greenhouse in Moshav Mishmar Hashiva, Israel. Asexual reproduction of the new cultivar was performed by vegetative cuttings. This was first performed at a research greenhouse in Moshav Mishmar Hashiva, Israel in December of 2011 and has shown that the unique features of this cultivar are stable and reproduced true to type in more than 25 successive generations. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The cultivar ‘DRAY305’ has not been observed under all possible environmental conditions. The phenotype may vary somewhat with variations in environment such as temperature, day length, and light intensity, without, however, any variance in genotype. The following traits have been repeatedly observed and are determined to be the unique characteristics of ‘DRAY305’ These characteristics in combination distinguish ‘DRAY305’ as a new and distinct Petunia cultivar: 1. Mounded, ball-shaped plant. 2. Very well branched with medium vigor. 3. Flowers color is red. 4. Flower size is extra large. 5. Abundant flowering. Plants of the new cultivar ‘DRAY305’ are similar to plants of the seed parent, Petunia sensu wijsman ‘cv. 10-4265’ in most horticultural characteristics, however, plants of the new cultivar ‘DRAY305’ differs in the following: 1. Mounded, ball shaped growth habit compared to the semi upright growth habit of the seed parent. 2. Larger plant size 3. Different flower color, red compared to dark red color of the seed parent. 4. Larger flower size. 5. More abundant flowering. Plants of the new cultivar ‘DRAY305’ are similar to plants of the pollen parent; Petunia sensu wijsman ‘cv. 10-4253’ in most horticultural characteristics, however, plants of the new cultivar ‘DRAY305’ differ in the following; 1. Mounded, ball shaped growth habit compared to the semi upright growth habit of the pollen parent. 2. More abundant branching. 3. Different flower color, red compared to light pink flower color of pollen parent. 4. Larger flower size. 5. More abundant flowering. COMMERCIAL COMPARISON Plants of the new cultivar ‘DRAY305’ are comparable to the commercial variety Petunia ‘DANRAY5’ U.S. Plant Pat. No. 20,973. The two Petunia varieties are similar in most horticultural characteristics; however, the new variety ‘DRAY305’ differs in the following: 1. Flower color is lighter. 2. Shorter, lighter colored leaves. 3. Less vigor. 4. Shorter branches. Plants of the new cultivar ‘DRAY305’ can also be compared to the commercial variety Petunia ‘DANRAY3’, unpatented. These varieties are similar in most horticultural characteristics; however ‘DRAY305’ differs in the following: 1. Larger flower size. 2. Red flowers. The comparator has light purple flowers with dark purple veins. 3. Shorter branches 4. Less vigor. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE PHOTOGRAPHS The accompanying photograph in FIG. 1 illustrates in full color a typical plant of ‘DRAY305’ grown in a greenhouse, in a 13 cm pot. Age of the plant photographed is approximately 3 months from a rooted cutting. FIG. 2 illustrates a close up of the flowers. The photographs were taken using conventional techniques and although colors may appear different from actual colors due to light reflectance it is as accurate as possible by conventional photographic techniques. DETAILED BOTANICAL DESCRIPTION In the following description, color references are made to the Royal Horticultural Society Mini Colour Chart 2007 except where general terms of ordinary dictionary significance are used.
