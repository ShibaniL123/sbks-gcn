LINEAR GAMMA MSH WITH C- AND / OR N-TERMINAL EXTENSIONS OF LYSINE AND / OR GLUTAMIC ACID RESIDUES Field of invention The present invention relates to peptide analogues of the natural existing or native melanocortin γ-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (γ-MSH), or variants thereof, which are modified by N- and/or C-terminal addition of one or two linear amino acid probes, and their use in the treatment of inflammatory and/or ischemic conditions. Background of invention The native peptide gamma-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (γ-MSH) is a native agonist for at least a subset of the melanocortin receptors (MCr's). The MCr's belong to the class of G-protein coupled receptors. All receptor subtypes are coupled to a G- stimulatory protein, which means that receptor stimulation involves increased production of cAMP. The selectivity for the MCr's to bind different MSH peptides varies; the binding affinity of γ-MSH against the MC1r and MC5r is weak, the binding to the MC4r somewhat better, and yet higher affinity to the MC3r (J. Med. Chem. 2005, 48, 1839-1848). Consequently γ-MSH shows some selectivity against the MC3r. The type 1 (MC1 r) and/or type 3 (MC3r) melanocortin receptors are expressed in immune competent cells including monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, t-cells and dendritic cells. Stimulation of the MCr1 and/or MC3r is associated with modulation of an inflammatory response including attenuation of cytokine production and activation of pro-resolving effects. Both hypoxia (ischemia) and reperfusion injuries are important factors in human pathophysiology. Examples of tissue hypoxia that predispose to injury during reperfusion include circulatory shock, myocardial ischemia, stroke, temporary renal ischemia, major surgery and organ-transplantation. Because diseases due to ischemia are exceedingly common causes of morbidity and mortality and because organ transplantation is increasingly frequent, treatment strategies with the potential of limiting reperfusion injuries is of great need in order to improve public health. The underlying pathophysiology of ischemia/reperfusion injuries is complex and involves not only a classical inflammatory reperfusion response with neutrophil- infiltration, but also cytokine gene expression including tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF- a), interleukin (IL)-1 β, IL-6, IL-8, interferon-γ, and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1 ) within the reperfusion tissue/organ. Furthermore, it has been suggested that locally produced TNF-a contributes to post-ischemic organ dysfunction as in the post- infarctional heart by direct depression of contractility and induction of apoptosis. Because of the complex nature of ischemia and/or reperfusion injuries simple anti- inflammatory treatment concepts have been shown ineffective. Most experimental studies therefore point to the fact that concomitant interaction with more than one of the activated pathways is needed in order to protect against reperfusion injuries. Melanocortins have been shown to have both anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative and anti-apoptotic abilities, and to stimulate pro-resolving effects such as the macrophages ability to phagocytise apoptotic neutrophils. Treatment with the native hormones or known analogues thereof has shown some beneficial effects in animal models of ischemia/reperfusion and inflammatory induced organ failure. Known analogues of γ-MSH include one or two amino acids in the D-conformation (D- stereoisomer) (see e.g. Grieco et al., J Med Chem 2000;43:4998-5002). Summary of invention The present invention provides peptide analogues of γ-MSH comprising the amino acid sequence of γ-MSH, preferably human γ1- or Y2-MSH, or specified variants thereof, and one or two linear amino acid probes covelantly bound to the N- and/or C-terminus of said γ-MSH. These are collectively referred to herein as γ-MSH analogues. In some embodiments, the γ-MSH analogues provided herein have one or more improved properties compared to the native γ-MSH peptide.

Detailed description of the invention Proopiomelanocortin (POMC) is a precursor polypeptide which is cleaved enzymatically into a range of peptides, including the melanocortins. The melanocortins include adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and the different forms of melanocyte- stimulating hormone (MSH): a-MSH, β-MSH and γ-MSH. They exert their effects by binding to and activating the melanocortin receptors MC1 r to C5r, each with differing specificities for the melanocortins. Three forms of γ-melanocyte-stimulating hormone or γ-melanotropin (γ-MSH) exist namely γΙ -MSH, Y2-MSH and Y3-MSH, which differ in the structure of their C-termini. γΙ -MSH and Y2-MSH vary by one amino acid in the C-terminus. γ1 -MSH Tyr-Val-Met-Gly-His-Phe-Arg-Trp-Asp-Arg-Phe-Gly YVMGHFRWDRFG P01 189[77-88], Pro-opiomelanocortin, Homo sapiens aa modifications: Phenylalanine amide (pos 88) Y2-MSH Tyr-Val-Met-Gly-His-Phe-Arg-Trp-Asp-Arg-Phe YVMGHFRWDRF P01 189[77-87], Pro-opiomelanocortin, Homo sapiens aa modifications: Phenylalanine amide (pos 87) Analogues of v-MSH It is an aspect of the present invention to provide γ-MSH peptide analogues.

These are naturally all L-stereoisomers. Aside from the 22 natural or standard amino acids, there are many other non-naturally occurring amino acids (non-proteinogenic or non-standard amino acids). They are either not found in proteins, or are not produced directly and in isolation by standard cellular machinery. Non-standard amino acids are usually formed through modifications to standard amino acids, such as post-translational modifications. Examples of preferred unnatural amino acid residues according to the invention are Nle (Norleucine), Orn (ornithine, deguanylated Arginine), Nal (beta-2-naphthyl-alanine), D-Nal (beta-2-naphthyl-D- alanine), D-Arg, D-Trp, D-Phe and D-Val. Any amino acids according to the present invention may be in the L- or D-configuration. If nothing is specified, reference to the L-isomeric form is preferably meant. The term peptide also embraces post-translational modifications introduced by chemical or enzyme-catalyzed reactions, as are known in the art. Such post- translational modifications can be introduced prior to partitioning, if desired. Also, functional equivalents may comprise chemical modifications such as ubiquitination, labeling (e.g., with radionuclides, various enzymes, etc.), pegylation (derivatization with polyethylene glycol), or by insertion (or substitution by chemical synthesis) of amino acids (amino acids) such as ornithine, which do not normally occur in human proteins. Sterically similar compounds may be formulated to mimic the key portions of the peptide structure and that such compounds may also be used in the same manner as the peptides of the invention. This may be achieved by techniques of modelling and chemical designing known to those of skill in the art. For example, esterification and other alkylations may be employed to modify the amino terminus of e.g a di-arginine peptide backbone, to mimic a tetra peptide structure. It will be understood that all such sterically similar constructs fall within the scope of the present invention. Peptides with N-terminal alkylations and C-terminal esterifications are also encompassed within the present invention. Functional equivalents also comprise glycosylated and covalent or aggregative conjugates formed with the same molecules, including dimers or unrelated chemical moieties. Such functional equivalents are prepared by linkage of functionalities to groups which are found in fragment including at any one or both of the N- and C-termini, by means known in the art.

Activity The term "agonist" in the present context refers to a substance or a peptide as defined herein, capable of binding to and/or activating a receptor, or in some embodiments, capable of binding to and/or activating a receptor to at least some extent, or in some embodiments, capable of activating a receptor to at least some extent. A MClr receptor agonist (MCl r agonist) is thus capable of binding to and/or activating the MC1 r receptor to at least some extent. The terms 'MC1 r agonist' and 'MC1 r receptor agonist' are used interchangeably herein. An agonist may be an agonist of several different types of receptors, and thus capable of binding and/or activating several different types of receptors. Said agonist can also be a selective agonist which only binds and activates one type of receptor. The term "antagonist" in the present context refers to a substance capable of inhibiting the effect of a receptor agonist. Full agonists bind (have affinity for) and activate a receptor, displaying full efficacy at that receptor. "Partial agonists" in the present context are peptides able to bind and activate a given receptor, but having only partial efficacy at the receptor relative to a full agonist. Partial agonists can act as antagonists when competing with a full agonist for receptor occupancy and producing a net decrease in the receptor activation compared to the effects or activation observed with the full agonist alone. "Selective agonists" in the present context are compounds which are selective and therefore predominantly bind and activate one type of receptor. Thus a selective MC1 r receptor agonist is selective for the MC1 r receptor. Peptides according to the present invention are in one embodiment capable of binding and activating to some extent one or several melanocortin (MC) receptors and can have different binding affinities and/or different receptor activation efficacy for different MC receptors, wherein affinity refers to the number and size of intermolecular forces between a peptide ligand and its receptor, and residence time of the ligand at its receptor binding site; and receptor activation efficacy refers to the ability of the peptide ligand to produce a biological response upon binding to the target receptor and the quantitative magnitude of this response. In some embodiments, such differences in affinity and receptor activation efficacy are determined by receptor binding/activation studies which are conventional in the art, for instance by generating EC50 and Emax values for stimulation of ligand binding in cells expressing one or several types of MC receptors as mentioned herein, or on tissues expressing the different types of MC receptors. High affinity means that a lower concentration of a compound is needed to obtain a binding of 50% of the receptors compared to peptides which have lower affinity; high receptor activation efficacy means that a lower concentration of the peptide is needed to obtain a 50% receptor activation response (low EC50 value), compared to peptides which have lower affinity and/or receptor activity efficacy (higher EC50 value). The receptor activation potency of peptide agonists of the present invention can also be measured in p(A5o) values which is a conventional method for determining the receptor activation efficacy of an agonist. In one embodiment of the present invention, the peptides are selective or combined agonists of one or more of the MC receptors selected from MC1 r, MC2r, MC3r, MC4r and MC5r. In one embodiment of the present invention, the peptides are selective agonists of one of the MC receptors selected from MC1 r, MC2r, MC3r, MC4r and MC5r. In one embodiment of the present invention, the peptides are combined agonists of two of the MC receptors selected from MC1 r, MC2r, MC3r, MC4r and MC5r. In one embodiment of the present invention, the peptides are combined agonists of two or more of the MC receptors have differing affinities and/or receptor activation efficacies for two or more of the receptors selected from MC1 r, MC2r, MC3r, MC4r and MC5r. In one particular embodiment, the peptides according to the present invention are capable of binding to and activating at least the melanocortin receptor MC1 r. In a further embodiment said peptide is a full agonist of the melanocortin receptor MC1r. In a further embodiment, said peptide is further capable of binding to and activating melanocortin receptor MC3r. It follows that the peptide of the present invention in one embodiment is capable of binding to and activating the melanocortin receptors MC1 r and/or MC3r. In another embodiment, the peptide of the present invention is capable of binding to and activating the melanocortin receptors MC1r and MC3r. Methods of preparation The peptides according to the present invention may be prepared by any suitable methods known in the art. Thus, in some embodiments the γ-MSH (native or variants as defined herein), and the X motif, are prepared by standard peptide-preparation techniques, such as solution synthesis or solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) such as Merrifield-type solid phase synthesis. The peptides of the invention are in one embodiment prepared by solid phase synthesis by first constructing the pharmacologically active peptide sequence (γ-MSH; native or variants as defined herein), using well-known standard protection, coupling and de-protection procedures, thereafter sequentially coupling the linear amino acid sequence of the motif X onto the active peptide in a manner similar to the construction of the active peptide, and finally cleaving off the entire peptide from the carrier. This strategy yields a peptide, wherein the motif X is covalently bound to the pharmacologically active peptide at the N- or C-terminal nitrogen atom of the peptide. In one embodiment, the alpha nitrogen on a suitable amino acid in the amino acid sequence is capped with acetyl, using standard acylation techniques, prior to or after coupling of the linear amino acid sequence on the active peptide. Reactive moieties at the N- and C-termini, which facilitates amino acid coupling during synthesis, as well as reactive side chain functional groups, can interact with free termini or other side chain groups during synthesis and peptide elongation and negatively influence yield and purity. Chemical groups are thus developed that bind to specific amino acid functional groups and block, or protect, the functional group from nonspecific reactions. Purified, individual amino acids are reacted with these protecting groups prior to synthesis and then selectively removed during specific steps of peptide synthesis. Examples of N-terminal protecting groups are t-Boc and Fmoc, commonly used in solid-phase peptide synthesis. C-terminal protecting groups are mostly used in liquid-phase synthesis. Because N-terminal deprotection occurs continuously during peptide synthesis, protecting schemes have been established in which the different types of side chain protecting groups (benzyl;Bzl or tert-butyl;tBu) are matched to either Boc or Fmoc, respectively, for optimized deprotection. In a particular embodiment of the invention, when preparing the linear amino acid probe, the protection group for Lys is Mtt, which protected amino acid is commercially available (Fmoc-Lys(Mtt)-OH; N - a - Fmoc - N - ε - 4 - methyltrityl - L - lysine, CAS# 167393-62-6). Lys(Mtt) allows for capping Lys with acetyl as it is not cleaved under the conditions that cleave Fmoc, and may be removed without cleavage of other side chain protection groups. The method of preparation is in some embodiments optimized by routine methods in the art that may increase the yield and/or quality of the thus prepared synthetic peptide. For instance, use of pseudoproline (oxazolidine) dipeptides in the Fmoc SPPS of serine- and threonine-containing peptides may lead to improvements in quality and yield of crude products and may help avoid unnecessary repeat synthesis of failed sequences. These dipeptides are easy to use: simply substitute a serine or threonine residue together with the preceding amino acid residue in the peptide sequence with the appropriate pseudoproline dipeptide. The native sequence is regenerated on cleavage and deprotection. In one embodiment the sequence of the pharmacologically active peptide sequence (v- MSH; native or variants as defined herein) and the one or two X-motifs (or parts thereof) are each prepared separately by for example solution synthesis, solid phase synthesis, recombinant techniques, or enzymatic synthesis, followed by coupling of the (at least) two sequences, in some embodiments three sequences, by well-known segment condensation procedures, either in solution or using solid phase techniques, or a combination thereof. In one embodiment, the γ-MSH as defined herein is prepared by recombinant DNA methods and the X motif is prepared by solid or solution phase synthesis. The conjugation of the γ-MSH and the X motif is in one embodiment carried out by using chemical ligation. This technique allows for the assembling of totally unprotected peptide segments in a highly specific manner. In another embodiment, the conjugation is performed by protease-catalysed peptide bond formation, which offers a highly specific technique to combine totally unprotected peptide segments via a peptide bond. In one embodiment, the C-terminal amino acid of the X-motif or the C-terminal amino acid of the γ-MSH is attached to the solid support material by means of a common linker such as 2,4-dimethoxy-4'-hydroxy-benzophenone, 4-(4-hydroxy-methyl-3- methoxyphenoxy)-butyric acid, 4-hydroxy-methylbenzoic acid, 4-hydroxymethyl- phenoxyacetic acid, 3-(4-hydroxymethylphenoxy)propionic acid, or p - {(R,S) - a - [1 - (9H - Fluoren - 9 - yl) - methoxyformamido] - 2,4 - dimethoxybenzyl} - phenoxyacetic acid (Rink amide linker). Examples of suitable solid support materials (SSM) are e.g., functionalised resins such as polystyrene, polyacrylamide, polydimethylacrylamide, polyethyleneglycol, cellulose, polyethylene, polyethyleneglycol grafted on polystyrene, latex, dynabeads, etc. The produced peptides of the invention are in some embodiment cleaved from the solid support material by means of an acid such as trifluoracetic acid, trifluoromethanesulfonic acid, hydrogen bromide, hydrogen chloride, hydrogen fluoride, etc. optionally in combination with one phenol, thioanisole, etc., or the peptide conjugate of the invention are in other embodiments cleaved from the solid support by means of a base such as ammonia, hydrazine, an aikoxide, such as sodium ethoxide, an hydroxide, such as sodium hydroxide, etc. In other embodiments, the peptides of the invention may be prepared or produced by recombinant techniques. Thus, in one aspect of the present invention the peptide is produced by host cells comprising a first nucleic acid sequence encoding the peptide operably associated with a second nucleic acid capable of directing expression in said host cells. In some embodiments the second nucleic acid sequence comprises or even consists of a promoter that will direct the expression of protein of interest in said cells. A skilled person will be readily capable of identifying useful second nucleic acid sequences (e.g. vectors and plasmids) for use in a given host cell. The process of producing a recombinant peptide in general comprises the steps of: providing a host cell, preparing a gene expression construct comprising a first nucleic acid encoding the peptide operably linked to a second nucleic acid capable of directing expression of said protein of interest in the host cell, transforming the host cell with the construct and cultivating the host cell, thereby obtaining expression of the peptide. In one embodiment of the invention, the recombinantly produced peptide is excreted by the host cells. The host cell include any suitable host cell known in the art, including prokaryotic cells, yeast cells, insect cells and mammalian cells. In one embodiment, the recombinant peptide thus produced is isolated by any conventional method and may be linked via conventional peptide bond forming chemistry to any suitably protected linear amino peptide moiety. The skilled person will be able to identify suitable protein isolation steps for purifying the peptide.

In one embodiment, such steps of administration or release according to the present invention are simultaneous, sequential or separate. Ischemia is defined as a reduced/arrested blood flow to one or more organs resulting in a reduced oxygen delivery and/or utilization by the tissues. Ischemia induces multiple tissue reactions including neutrophil accumulation, other inflammatory responses and cell death. Ischemia is involved in multiple diseases, is associated with major surgery, and also occurs secondary to other severe diseases. An individual in need as referred to herein, is in one embodiment an individual that benefits from the administration of a peptide or pharmaceutical composition according to the present invention. Such an individual in one embodiment suffers from an ischemic and/or inflammatory condition in the tissue of one or more organs, or is at risk of suffering therefrom.

The patient to be treated is preferably a mammal, in particular a human being. Treatment of animals, such as mice, rats, dogs, cats, cows, horses, sheep and pigs, is, however, also within the scope of the present invention.

The peptides referred to are the γ-MSH-analogues according to the present invention and described in detail herein above. The invention is in one embodiment directed to a peptide according to the present invention for use in the treatment of an ischemic and/or inflammatory condition in the tissue of one or more organs of a mammal. In one embodiment said treatment is prophylactic, ameliorative and/or curative. In one embodiment, said mammal is a human (homo sapiens). The invention in certain embodiments is directed to a method for treatment of an ischemic and/or inflammatory condition in the tissue of one or more organs, said method comprising the step of administering a therapeutically effective amount of a peptide according to the present invention to an individual in need thereof. In a specific embodiment, the invention is directed to use of a peptide according to the present invention for manufacturing of a medicament for the treatment of an ischemic and/or inflammatory condition in the tissue of one or more organs of a mammal. When referring to the tissue of one or more organs, said organ is in one embodiment selected from the group consisting of kidney, liver, brain, heart, muscles, bone marrow, skin, skeleton, lungs, the respiratory tract, spleen, exocrine glands, bladder, endocrine glands, reproduction organs including the phallopian tubes, eye, ear, vascular system, the gastroinstestinal tract including small intestines, colon, rectum, canalis analis and the prostate gland. In one embodiment, the ischemic and/or inflammatory condition in the tissue of one or more organs is an acute, subacute or chronic ischemic and/or inflammatory condition. In one embodiment, the ischemic and/or inflammatory condition in the tissue of one or more organs is an ischemic condition. In another embodiment, the ischemic and/or inflammatory condition in the tissue of one or more organs is an inflammatory condition. In a further embodiment, the ischemic condition in the tissue of one or more organs is secondary ischemia. Secondary ischemia is ischemia which is caused by an underlying condition such that the ischemia typically is secondary to another condition, such as stroke, injury, septic shock, systemic hypotension, cardiac arrest due to heart attack, cardiac arrhythmia, atheromatous disease with thrombosis, embolism from the heart or from blood vessel from any organ, vasospasm, aortic aneurysm or aneurisms in other organs, coronary stenosis, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, pericarditis, myocarditis, myxodemia, or endocarditis. An aortic aneurysm is in one embodiment thoracal or abdominal or dissecting aortic aneurysm. Systemic hypotension is in one embodiment hypotension due to heart disease, hypotension due to systemic disease including infection or allergic reactions, or hypotension due to one or more toxic compound or poison(s) or drug(s). In one embodiment said ischemic and/or inflammatory condition in the tissue of one or more organs is due to (or caused by) a condition selected from stroke, injury, septic shock, systemic hypotension, cardiac arrest due to heart attack, cardiac arrhythmia, atheromatous disease with thrombosis, embolism from the heart or from blood vessel from any organ, vasospasm, aortic aneurysm or aneurisms in other organs, coronary stenosis, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, pericarditis, myocarditis, myxodemia, or endocarditis. In one embodiment, said ischemic condition is myocardial ischemia. In one embodiment said ischemic and/or inflammatory condition in the tissue of one or more organs is due to cardiac arrhythmia. In one embodiment, said cardiac arrhythmia is the primary disease or secondary to another condition of the individual, including acute infections particularly those affecting the lungs, pulmonary embolism, hypotension, shock, anoxaemia and anaemia. Cardiac arrhythmias include ventricular or supra ventricular tachyarrhythmias, atrioventricular block, sinus node disease, Wolff-Parkinson- White syndrome, Lenegres disease, Lev's disease any syndrome involving an abnormal myocardial connection between atrium and ventricle. In one embodiment, secondary ischemia can also be observed in connection with a range of other diseases and conditions, including but not limited to diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidaemia, thromboangiitis obliterans, Takayasu 's syndrome, arteritis temporalis, mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome (Kawasaki disease), cardiovascular syphilis, connective tissue disorders such as Raynaud 's disease, phlegmasia coerulae dolens, blood vessel trauma including iatrogene trauma such as cannulation, conditions with increased fasting levels of LDL-Cholesterol, triglycerid, and/or HDL- Cholesterol, retroperitoneal fibrosis, rheumatic diseases, systemic lupus erythematosus, polyarteritis nodosa, scleroderma, polymyositis, dermatomyositis, rheumatoid arthritis, neuromyopathic disorders such as progressive muscular dystrophy of Duchenne, Friedreich 's ataxia, and myotonic dystrophy, anaphylaxis, serum sickness, hemolytic anaemia, allergy, and allergic agranulocytosis. In one embodiment the peptides of the present invention are also be useful in the treatment or prevention of said conditions. Many infections may have an influence on the tissue and disturb the normal function resulting in decreased performance, which in one embodiment is treated by administration of an effective dose of a peptide of the invention. In one embodiment, infections include infections by protozoa, virus, bacteria and fungus and include conditions such as AIDS, bacterial septicemia, systemic fungal infections, Rickettsial diseases, toxic shock syndrome, infectious mononucleosis, chlamydia thrachomatis, chlamydia psittaci, cytomegalovirus infection, Campylobacter, salmonella, influenza, poliomyelitis, toxoplasmosis, Lassa Fever, Yellow Fever, billharziose, colibacteria, enterococcus, preteus, klebsiella, pseudomonas, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, Candida albicans, tuberculosis, mumps, infectious mononucleosis, hepatitis and Coxackie virus. In one embodiment the condition to be treated is caused by a cancer or a by premalignant disorder having an impact on the organ, e.g. on the respiratory system including lung, bronchiole, upper airways, and/or on the heart and/or on the kidney and/or on the gastrointestinal system, including acute leukemia, chronic myelocytic leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, Hodgkin's disease, lymphosarcoma, myeloma, metastasizing carcinoma of any origin. In one embodiment the peptides of the invention are used in the treatment or prevention of said conditions. In one embodiment, the ischemic and/or inflammatory condition in the tissue of one or more organs is caused by a physical trauma including electromagnetic radiation. In one embodiment, the inflammatory condition to be treated with a γ-MSH analogue of the invention is a glomerular disease of the kidney, including in one eombodiment: diffuse mesangial sclerosis (DMS), congenital nephrotic syndrome of the Finnish type (CNSF), Alport's syndrome and variants (Alport p), MCD, FSGS, collapsing glomerulonephropathy (Collapsing GN), immune and inflammatory glomerulonephropathies (Imm/lnf GN), hypertensive nephropathy (HTN), diabetic glomerulonephropathy (Diab GN), and age-associated glomerulonephropathy (Aging GN) or the induction of diuresis or a remission of proteinuria in the nephrotic syndrome. Together these conditions account for the development of 90% of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). Glomerulopathies affect the podocytes, which together with the glomerulus basement membranes form filtration slits responsible for allowing water, electrolytes and other small molecules to filter away from blood passing through the nephron and into the urine ducts while retaining proteins (e.g. serum albumin) and cells (e.g., red blood cells and platelets) in the blood. Podocyte injury and death leads to proteinuria (protein in the urine), which represents a health issue in itself, as well as the likelihood of progressing kidney damage. In treatment of glomuerulopathies, it is known that a deficiency of the melanocortin peptide, ACTH, is associated with nephrotic syndrome caused by FSGS, which inferrs that the melanocortin hormone system might be essential for kidney homeostasis and melanocortin deficiency may predispose to kidney disease. ACTH while primarily binding to the MC2R is also an agoinist at the other melanocortin receptors. Table I presents MCR 1 , 2 and 3 expression in kidney parenchymal cells as well as beneficial effects associated with receptor stimulation by melanocortins (adapted from Gong, R. Advances in Chronic Kidney Diease, 21(2) 133-151 (2014)) as well as blood cells which epress these receptors. There are several pathways that G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) MC1 -receptor agonists may trigger through several cAMP-PKA pathways, including MAPK/ERK- mediated anti-apoptosis/pro-survival signaling; suppression of NFi B-mediated production of inflammatory mediators such as THFa, IL-1 β and IL-12; and CREB- mediated stimulation of IL-10 and HO-1 production, both anti-inflammatory and immune tolerance mediators. Another cAMP-PKA mediated pathway that has particular implications for maintenance and remodeling of the foot processes of podocytes are the Rho family proteins (Rho, cdc42 and Rac) that play a role in cytoskeleton remodeling. Collectively, kidney parenchymal tissues and cells, including podocytes, mesangium, glomerular endothelia, tubular epithelia, and tubulointerstitium, are targets for melanocortin-mediated actions. Accordingly, a γ-MSH analogue according to the present inventionmay be used to treat diseases or injuries of kidney tissues / cells expressing the MC1 R and MC3 R, including podocytopathies such as MCD (minimal change diease) and FSGS (focal segmental glomerular sclerosis), mesangial diseases such, as immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) and mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis (MsPGN), glomerular endotheliosis caused by transplant glomerulopathy, preeclampsia, or thrombotic microangiopathy due to hemolytic-uremic syndrome or thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and tubular injuries such as acute tubular necrosis. Table 1. In addition to direct protective effects on kidney cells in glomerular diseases gamma MSH analogs of the present invention can also provide systemic immunomodulation. The analogues of the present invention are able to dampen macrophage mediators in inflammatory settings, by influencing monocytes ability to recruit and prime neutrophils by reducing chemotaxis and inhibiting generation of reactive oxygen species. In another embodiment the gamma MSH anlogues of the invention have significant antiinflammatory properties mediated through NFkB as demonstrated by α-MSH inhibition of the production or action of proinflammatory factors (nitric oxide, IL-1 , IL-6, TNF-a, INFy, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1), and upregulation of immunosuppressive IL-10, and downregulation of endothelial adhesion molecules. Many cells involved in the anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory actions of melanocortins express MC1 R. Melanocortins and their synthetic analogues induce remission of glomerular diseases mainly by targeting the glomerular cells (podocytes, mesangial cells, and glomerular endothelial cells and immune-competence cells via the expressed melanocortin receptors, thereby exerting a direct cellular protective effect on glomerular cells and a systemic immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effect. Suppression of extravastion of leukocytes by down regulation of expression of endothelial adhesion molecules at sites of tissue inflammation as well as immune modulation of antigen presenting cells and production of regulatory T cells which can down regulate production of autoantibodies, both features indicate a beneficial effect in glomerular diseases that are secondary to systemic autoimmune disorders, such as lupus nephritis. In addition the immunomodulation of autoimmune responses and transplant rejection of non-autologous tissues make the alpha and gamma MSH anlogues of the invention useful in treatment of multiple sclerosis, organ transplant rejection and GVHD (graft vs host disease). In another embodiment, the gamma MSH anlogues of the invention are useful in treating neuroinflammatory pain, such as, for example, neuropathic pain or diabetic neuropathy. [Abbreviations: adrenocorticotropic hormone; APC, antigen-presenting cells; BC, Bowman's capsule; C, glomerular capillary lumen; E, glomerular endothelial cells; M, mesangium; MCR, melanocortin receptor; MSH, melanocyte-stimulating hormone] Surgery and transplantation Major surgical interventions including cardiothoracic surgery, abdominal surgery, surgery on the aorta and other major blood vessels, as well as organ transplantation such as lung or heart or combined lung and heart transplantation, liver transplantation or renal transplantation induce a systemic inflammatory response (SIR; or systemic inflammatory response syndrome SIRS) and is associated with post-surgical organ dysfunction including development of renal failure. Renal failure is a consequence of the SIR and the reduced blood flow generated during the surgical intervention. The result is post-surgical acute kidney injury (AKI) which for a large fraction deteriorates into chronic renal failure. Currently no efficient treatment modality exists to prevent the development of renal failure. Post-surgical renal failure may be defined as a more than 25% reduction in Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) present 3 month after the surgical intervention. Major cardiac surgery such as repair of one or more cardiac valves, cardiac artery bypass grafting (CABG), surgery on the aortic root, or aortic branch including the common carotic arteries, or combined cardiac surgery such as valve(s) replacement and CABG and/or aortic root surgery is associated with development of renal impairment that, when present, is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. In one embodiment, treatment with a YMSH analogue according to the present invention reduces the degree of renal impairment. In one embodiment this is achieved by reducing the fall in GFR post-surgery; by reducing the degree of post-surgical increases in serum creatinine or cystatin C or the more immediate increases in urinary excretion of AKI markers NGAL, IL18 or KIM-1 ; and/or or by reducing the degree of post-surgical SIR (for example by reduced circulating levels of IL-6 and other proiflammatory markers). Lung transplantation (LTX) is the ultimate treatment modality for end-stage lung disease. The major challenges associated with LTX are scarcity of donors, acute and chronic rejection of the transplanted lungs and side-effects of immune suppressive treatment including development of chronic renal failure (CRF). While there has been a good development in the treatment of acute rejection by newer immunosuppressive drugs leading to fewer episodes of acute rejection within the first year, fewer organ losses, fewer side effects, fewer infections, and less invasive monitoring methods, the control of chronic organ rejection has not greatly improved and the half-life time in terms of how many years 50% of the patients survive has only marginally improved during the last 2 decades to around 7 years. Side effects of the immunosuppressive treatment are dominated by 2 major challenges: Nephrotoxicity and post-transplant lymphoproliferative diseases (PTLD), where the latter can be considered as a consequence of the degree of immune-suppression needed to avoid chronic organ rejection - "too much" keeps the rejection on distance, but gives infections and PTLD, while giving "too little" puts the patients at an increased risk of rejecting the graft. Neprotoxicity and development of CRF is, despite extensive research during the last 30 years, still a significant problem. Five years after LTX none of the patients retain normal kidney function and 20% of the long term survivors will end with a kidney transplant as well. Calcineurin inhibitor treatment (Tacrolimus, Cyclosporin A) is the corner-stone in the immune suppressive treatment strategy for successful solid organ transplantation. The limiting factor in using calcineurin inhibitors is the acute and chronic irreversible nephrotoxicity. Recent data indicate that kidney function (measured as reduction in GFR) is reduced with 40% within the first 14 days after LTX and that this reduction is irreversible. Heart transplantation (HTX) is the ultimate treatment modality for end-stage heart failure. As for LTX the major challenges associated with HTX are scarcity of donors, acute and chronic rejection of the transplanted hearts and side-effects of immune suppressive treatment including development of CRF. Like for LTX the number of patients with retained kidney function over time is limited or absent and like LTX a major reduction in kidney function is present already two to four weeks post transplantation. This dramatic effect on kidney function seen after LTX and HTX is probably not caused by calcineurin inhibitor treatment alone, but is the final result of the surgical and anesthesiological trauma in combination with the organ ischemia and side effects of antibiotic, antiviral, antifungal and immunsuppressive drugs. Consequently, in one embodiment pharmacological intervention by employment of the aMSH and YMSH analogues according to the present invention will reduce the degree of renal impairment associated with organ transplantation, such as LTX and HTX. Surgery, as is outlined herein above in detail, including organ transplantation, may thus be the cause of secondary ischemia. The invention is thus in one embodiment directed to a peptide according to the present invention for use in the treatment of an ischemic and/or inflammatory condition in the tissue of one or more organs of a mammal, wherein said ischemic and/or inflammatory condition is associated with surgery. In one embodiment said surgery is major surgery or major surgical intervention. In one embodiment, said surgery is selected from the group consisting of cardiothoracic surgery, abdominal surgery, surgery on the aorta and/or other major blood vessels, repair of one or more cardiac valves, cardiac artery bypass grafting (CABG), surgery on the aortic root or the aortic branch including the common carotic arteries, and combined cardiac surgery such as valve(s) replacement and CABG and/or aortic root surgery. In one embodiment, said surgery encompasses surgical insertion transplants, devices, grafts, prostheses or other biomedical compounds or devices inserted by surgical operations. In one embodiment, said major surgery comprises organ transplantation. It follows that the invention in one embodiment is directed to a peptide according to the present invention for use in the treatment of an ischemic and/or inflammatory condition in the tissue of one or more organs of a mammal, wherein said ischemic and/or inflammatory condition is associated with organ transplantation. In one embodiment, said organ transplantation is solid organ transplantation. In one embodiment said solid organ transplantation is heart transplantation, lung transplantation, combined heart and lung transplantation, liver transplantation or kidney (renal) transplantation. The invention in another embodiment is directed to a peptide according to the present invention for use in the treatment of post-surgical systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), post-surgical organ dysfunction and/or post-surgical renal failure such as acute kidney injury (AKI), neprotoxicity and/or chronic renal failure (CRF). The invention is in one embodiment directed to a peptide according to the present invention for reducing the degree of renal impairment associated with major surgery, in one embodiment, organ transplantation. Reperfusion injury is tissue damage caused when blood supply returns to the tissue after a period of ischemia or lack of oxygen. The absence of oxygen and nutrients from blood during the ischemic period creates a condition in which the restoration of circulation results in inflammation and oxidative damage through the induction of oxidative stress rather than restoration of normal function. Reperfusion injuries may occur in connection with surgery, such as major surgical interventions including organ transplantations. It is a primary concern when performing liver transplantations, and also during cardiac surgery. In a particular embodiment, said ischemic and/or inflammatory condition in the tissue of one or more organs is associated with reperfusion injury. Thus, in one embodiment the present invention is directed to a peptide according to the present invention for use in the treatment of an ischemic and/or inflammatory condition in the tissue of one or more organs of a mammal, wherein said ischemic and/or inflammatory condition is associated with reperfusion injury. In some embodiments, the peptides or compositions of the present invention are to be administered before and/or during surgery and/or organ transplantation. Toxins and drugs In one embodiment the ischemic and/or inflammatory condition in the tissue of one or more organs as described herein is caused by toxin- or drug-induced cell, tissue or organ failure. The invention is thus in one embodiment directed to a peptide according to the present invention for use in the treatment of an ischemic and/or inflammatory condition in the tissue of one or more organs of a mammal, wherein said ischemic and/or inflammatory condition is caused (or induced) by toxin- or drug-induced cell, tissue or organ failure. Said drug includes but are not restricted to cancer chemotherapeutics including cisplatin, carboplatin, dacarbezine, procarbazine, altretamine, semustine, lomustine, carmustine, busulfan, thiotepa, melphalan, cyclophosphamide, chlorambucil, mechlorethamine, azadtidine, cladrrbine, cytorabine, fludarabine, fluorouracil, mercaptopurine, metrotrexate, thioguanine, allopurinol, bleomycin, dactinomycin, daunorubicin, docetaxel, doxorubicin (adriamycin), etoposide, idarubicin, irinotecan, mitomycin, paclitaxel, plicamycin, topotecan, vinblastine, vincristine, vinorelbine, amasacrine, asparaginase, hydroxyurea, mititane, mitoxantrone; Antibiotics as aminoglycosides including streptomycin, neomycin, kanamycin, amikacin, gentamicin, tobramycin, sisomicin and nitilmicin; immunodepressive compounds as cyclosporine; tricyclic antidepressants, lithium salts, prenylamine and phenothizine derivatives. Inflammatory conditions Inflammation is a localized defensive response of the body against pathogens and injury. Immune cells and soluble factors take part in this process to neutralize the injurious agent and initiate tissue repair to restore homeostasis. Loss of regulation of these mechanisms can prevent the final resolution of the inflammatory process, leading to chronic inflammation. Chronic inflammation is extremely relevant in today's modern medicine, as it contributes to the pathogenesis of the most important diseases of the industrialized societies including atherosclerosis, acute and chronic heart failure, cancer, diabetes, and obesity-associated diseases. Recent insight into endogenous anti-inflammatory pathways have identified a number of natural anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving molecules and pathways suitable for pharmacological intervention that would make it possible to develop drugs that mimic the natural course of resolving inflammation. Among these natural anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving pathways is the melanocortin system. The anti-inflammatory effects of melanocortins are at least partly exerted through inhibition of inflammatory mediators and by inhibition of inflammatory cell migration. Melanocortins exert these effects in a variety of cells including monocytes, macrophages, subtypes of T-cells, endothelial cells and epithelial cells. Most cell types responsive to the anti-inflammatory effect of melanocortins express the MCr1 , i.e. monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, mast cells, fibroblasts, dendritic cells, astrocytes, and microglia. Both human and murine macrophages express the MCr3 and an increasing number of reports have identified MC3r mediated anti-inflammatory effects in vitro and in vivo in models of both acute and more sustained/chronic inflammation. Consequently, in one embodiment anti-inflammatory intervention targeting the melanocortin system would benefit from targeting both the MC1 r and MC3r. Joint diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and gout are characterized by episodes with acute exacerbations, in RA the exacerbations (often described as flairs) typically develop on top of chronic symptoms and develop despite intense pharmacological treatment. A similar pattern can be seen in gout, with the major difference that most gout patients are without symptom between the exacerbations. In both conditions significant neutrophil infiltration into the synovial membrane and joint fluid are the primary pathological hallmark of the exacerbations. The most important pro-inflammatory effectors involved include IL-Ι β, TNF-a, IL-6, IL-8, and COX-2. Resolution of the acute exacerbations to avoid development or deterioration of chronic inflammation involves activation of macrophages to phagocytize the apoptotic neutrophils. Melanocortin type 1 and 3 receptors are expressed in synovial tissue of both animals and humans and it appears that the MC3r is up-regulated in RA patients with active disease. Consequently in one embodiment treatment is provided with a yMSH analogue according to the present invention to joint diseases, not at least in order to reduce the severity of exacerbations in existing disease as flairs in rheumatoid arthritis would have major clinical impact. However, not only joint diseases are associated with exacerbations of symptoms. Neurodegenerative diseases such as multiple sclerosis have flair-like exacerbations where treatment with a yMSH analogue according to the present invention in one embodiment could reduce the symptoms and eventually as for Joint diseases reduce the overall deterioration of the patients functional level. The invention is thus in one embodiment directed to a yMSH analogue according to the present invention for use in the treatment of an inflammatory condition in the tissue of one or more organs of a mammal, wherein said ischemic and/or inflammatory condition is an inflammatory disease. ACTH has been tested in an in vitro cell model of fibrosis by measuring its ability to inhibit TGFpl -induced differentiation of normal human lung fibroblasts (NHLF) into fibrogenic myofibroblasts producing extracellular matrix (ECM collagen). ACTH demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in ECM collagen at higher doses as detailed in pending US provisional application 61/785631.

The tablets may be uncoated or they may be coated by known techniques to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For example, a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate may be employed. They may also be coated by the techniques described in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,356,108; 4,166,452; and 4,265,874, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference, to form osmotic therapeutic tablets for controlled release.

Oily suspensions may be formulated by suspending the active ingredient in a vegetable oil, for example arachis oil, olive oil, sesame oil or coconut oil, or in a mineral oil such as a liquid paraffin. The oily suspensions may contain a thickening agent, for example beeswax, hard paraffin or cetyl alcohol. Sweetening agents such as those set forth above, and flavouring agents may be added to provide a palatable oral preparation. These compositions may be preserved by the addition of an anti-oxidant such as ascorbic acid. Dispersible powders and granules suitable for preparation of an aqueous suspension by the addition of water provide the active compound in admixture with a dispersing or wetting agent, suspending agent and one or more preservatives. Suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents are exemplified by those already mentioned above. Additional excipients, for example, sweetening, flavouring, and colouring agents may also be present. The pharmaceutical compositions comprising peptides for use according to the present invention may also be in the form of oil-in-water emulsions.

Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution, and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conveniently employed as solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose, any bland fixed oil may be employed using synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid find use in the preparation of injectables. The compositions may also be in the form of suppositories for rectal administration of the compounds of the invention. These compositions can be prepared by mixing the compound with a suitable non-irritating excipient which is solid at ordinary temperatures but liquid at the rectal temperature and will thus melt in the rectum to release the drug. Such materials include, for example, cocoa butter and polyethylene glycols. Peptides of the present invention may also be administered in the form of liposome delivery systems, such as small unilamellar vesicles, large unilamellar vesicles, and multilamellar vesicles.

Examples The potency and efficacy of the presently claimed invention can be determined using different pharmacological procedures. The present invention is further illustrated with reference to the following examples, which are not intended to be limiting in any way to the scope of the invention as claimed. In the following methods for testing the peptides of the invention are described in general. The aim of the methods is to test the peptides of the invention for receptor binding affinity and the efficacy against MC1 r, MC2r, MC3r, MC4r and/or MC5r (for instance human or murine). The immune modulating effects of melanocortins are mediated through MC1 r and/or MC3r stimulation on immune competent cells in tissues, organs and plasma. MC1 r and/or MC3r are expressed in immune competent cells including monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils t-cells and dendritic cells. Stimulation of the MCr1 and/or MC3r is associated with attenuation of cytokine production and activation of pro- resolving effects. The binding affinity and the receptor efficacy (alternative expression is potency) of a given melanocortin together, in some embodiments, makes up the overall efficacy of a given compound. The degree of a given compounds' binding affinity against the MCr's is defined as the ability to displacement of a radio-labelled full agonist with high binding affinity to the receptor, in the given case displacement of 125l- NDP-aMSH from the MCr1. The binding affinity is expressed with an inhibition constant IC50 defined as the concentration of a given compound inducing 50% displacement of the radio-labelled compounds (the lower IC50 the higher binding affinity). The receptor efficacy is defined as the ability to stimulate cAMP production compared to a full agonist as aMSH or NDP-aMSH. Both with regard to maximal efficacy (Emax) and with regard the efficacy constant EC50, defined as the concentration of agonist given ½ max response (the lower EC50 the higher efficacy). Experimental set-up Test 1) Binding affinity against the human MC1r, MC3r, MC4r and/or MC5r Binding affinity against the human MC1 r, MC3r, MC4r and/or MC5r is tested using a radioligand binding assay with membrane fraction of CRO cells stably expressing the human MC1r, MC3r, MC4r and/or MC5r. Competition binding is performed in the wells of a 96 well plate (Master Block, Greiner, 786201) containing binding buffer, humane MC1 r membrane extracts, [125l](Lys11)(Nle4-D-Phe7)-a-MSH and test compound at increasing concentrations. The samples are incubated in a final volume of 0.1 ml for 60 min at 25°C and then filtered over filters. Filters are washed six times with 0.5 ml of ice-cold washing buffer and 50 μΙ of Microscint 20 (Packard) is added in each well. The plates are incubated 15 min on an orbital shaker and then counted with a TopCount gamma counter for 1 min/well. Data is presented as mean values. The inhibition constant is determined by best fit analyses after logarithmic transformation using the graph pad software (version 6.0). Differences are considered significant at probability levels (p) of 0.05. Test 2) Receptor efficacy against the human MC1r, MC3r, MC4r and/or MC5r CHO-K1 cells expressing either the MC1 r, the MC3r, the MC4r or the MC5r grown in media without antibiotic are detached by gentle flushing with PBS-EDTA (5 mM EDTA), recovered by centrifugation and resuspended in assay buffer (KRH: 5 mM KCI, 1.25 mM MgS04, 124 mM NaCI, 25 mM HEPES, 13.3 mM Glucose, 1.25 mM KH2P04, 1.45 mM CaCI2, 0.5 g/l BSA). 12 μΙ of cells are mixed with 12 μΙ of the test compound at increasing concentrations in 96 wells plates and then incubated 30 min at room temperature. cAMP production is determined after addition of a lysis buffer and 1 hour incubation, by use of competitive immunoassay using cryptate-labeled anti-cAMP and d2-labeled cAMP (HTRF kit from CisBio) with Delta F percentage values calculated according to the manufacturer specification. Dose response curves are performed in parallel with test compounds, and reference compounds. The HTRF technology is a titration assay based on a competition between labeled cAMP (exogenous) and cAMP produced by the cell after activation of the MCr. The dynamic range of the assay is 3-4 fold meaning that the linear range (which enables conversion from raw data to nM of cAMP) is within that range. The window between top and bottom of the curve is higher (around 100) which means that converting into nM of cAMP, the assay window of cAMP goes from 1nM (basal) to around 30 nM (Emax). All experiments are conducted in the presence of the non-selective phosphodiesterase inhibitor IBMX (1 mM in final concentration). Data is presented as mean values. The inhibition constant is determined by best fit analyses after logarithmic transformation using the graph pad software (version 6.0). Differences are considered significant at probability levels (p) of 0.05. Example 1 The following γ-MSH analogues are synthesized: (Lys6)-Tyr-Val-Met-Gly-His-Phe-Arg-(D-Trp)-Asp-Arg-Phe-Gly-NH2 Tyr-Val-Met-Gly-His-Phe-Arg-(D-Trp)-Asp-Arg-Phe-Gly-(Lys6) (Lys6)-Tyr-Val-Met-Gly-His-Phe-Arg-(D-Trp)-Asp-Arg-Phe-Gly-(Lys6) (Glu4)-Tyr-Val-Met-Gly-His-Phe-Arg-Trp-Asp-Arg-Phe-Gly-NH2 (Glu6)-Tyr-Val-Met-Gly-His-Phe-Arg-(D-Trp)-Asp-Arg-Phe-Gly-NH2 (Lys6)-Tyr-Val-Met-Gly-His-Phe-Arg-(D-Trp)-Asp-Arg-Phe-Gly-(Glu6) (Lys-Glu-Lys-Glu-Lys-Glu)-Tyr-Val-Met-Gly-His-Phe-Arg-(D-Trp)-Asp-Arg-Phe-Gly-( Lys-Glu-Lys-Glu-Lys-Glu) The γ-MSH analogues are tested as outlined above; test 1 ) binding affinity against the human MC1 r, MC2r, MC3r, MC4r and/or MC5r, test 2) receptor efficacy against the human MC1 r, MC2r, MC3r, MC4r and/or MC5r, and/or test 3) receptor efficacy against the human MC1 r. Example 2 Synthesis of γ-MSH analogues. Peptides are manufactured using Fmoc (9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl) chemistry. Peptides are made using a polystyrene resin, functionalized with an appropriate linker, and the peptides are then manufactured using an Intavis Peptide Synthesizer. A 4-fold excess of amino acid is added relative to the resin and either HATU (0-(7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl)-N,N,N',N'-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate) or HCTU (2-(6-Chloro-1 H-benzotriazole-1-yl)-1 , 1 ,3,3-tetramethylaminium hexafluorophosphate) is used at a 3.95-fold excess to create the active ester. Along with an 8-fold excess of DIPEA (Ν,Ν-Diisopropylethylamine) as the base, these reagents catalyze the addition of the next amino acid. Once the amino acid is coupled (each cycle includes a double coupling cycle to insure efficient coupling) the resin is exposed to 20% acetic anhydride to terminate ("cap-off') any peptide chains that have not added the next amino acid. The amino acids are dissolved in NMP (N-Methyl-2- pyrrolidone) or DMF (Dimethylformamide) for washing. Piperidine is used to remove the Fmoc group at the end of each coupling cycle which allows the next amino acid to be added. For the γ-MSH analogue the addition of one or more pseudoproline (oxazolidine) dipeptides during the synthesis of serine- and/or threonine-containing peptides results in improvements in peptide quality and an increase in the yield of full length crude peptide. The peptide is made up to the MEHF, a pseudoproline dipeptide (Fmoc-YS) was added, the next amino acid "Ser" was coupled 3 times to insure it went to completion, and the peptide finished manually by adding the Lys(Mtt), acetylating, and then finishing as above. The peptides are dried using MeOH (3X), DCM (3X), cleaved using 92% TFA, 2% water, 2% triisopropylsilane, 2% thioanisole and 2% ethanedithiol for 3-4h at room temperature. Peptides are precipitated in cold diethyl ether, centrifuged (2,000 RPM) and the pellets washed 2X with cold ether. After drying the peptides are solubilized in water containing 0.1 % TFA (buffer A) and subjected to RP-HPLC using C18 columns (buffer B = 95% acetonitrile/0.1 % TFA). The purity is determined by analytical HPLC and theoretical mono isotopic molecular masses are confirmed by MS. The sequence integrity is verified by CID tandem MS/MS sequencing. Example 3 Synthesis of γ-MSH analogues. Peptides are manufactured using Fmoc (9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl) chemistry adding individual amino acids sequentially in the desired sequence of the peptide chain. Peptides are made using a polystyrene resin, functionalized with an appropriate linker, and the peptides are then manufactured using an Intavis Peptide Synthesizer. A 4-fold excess of amino acid is added relative to the resin and either HATU (0-(7- azabenzotriazol-1-yl)-N,N,N',N'-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate) or HCTU (2- (6-Chloro-1 H-benzotriazole-1-yl)-1 ,1 ,3,3-tetramethylaminium hexafluorophosphate) is used at a 3.95-fold excess to create the active ester. Along with an 8-fold excess of DIPEA (Ν,Ν-Diisopropylethylamine) as the base, these reagents catalyze the addition of the next amino acid in the sequence. Once the amino acid is coupled (each cycle includes a doublecoupling cycle to insure efficient coupling) the resin is exposed to 20% acetic anhydride to terminate ("cap-off') any peptide chains that have not added the next amino acid. Piperidine is used to remove the Fmoc group at the end of each coupling cycle which allows the next amino acid to be added. Washing in between the coupling, capping and deprotecting steps is done by suspending the resin in NMP (N-Methyl-2- pyrrolidone) or DMF (Dimethylformamide). The peptides are acetylated at the N-terminal after removal of the Fmoc group, followed by exposure to 20% acetic anhydride. The resin-linked peptides are subsequently dried using MeOH (3X), DCM (3X), cleaved from the resin and deprotected on the sidechains using 92% TFA, 2% water, 2% triisopropylsilane, 2% thioanisole and 2% ethanedithiol for 3-4h at room temperature. Peptides are precipitated in cold diethyl ether, centrifuged (2,000 RPM) and the pellets washed 2X with cold ether. After drying the peptides are solubilized in water containing 0.1% TFA (buffer A) and subjected to RP-HPLC using C18 columns (buffer B = 95% acetonitrile/0.1% TFA). The purity is determined by analytical HPLC and theoretical mono isotopic molecular masses are confirmed by MS. The sequence integrity is verified by CID tandem MS/MS sequencing. 1.
