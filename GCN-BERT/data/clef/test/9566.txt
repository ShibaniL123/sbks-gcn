[Technical Field] The present invention relates to a needle-like structure in which a plurality of microscopic needle portions are arrayed, and a method for manufacturing the structure. [Background Art] Recently, a method for directly administering a medicament into the skin captures attention. In the method, the skin is punctured using a needle-like structure having a plurality of microscopic needle portions of a micron order (microneedles) in order to have the medicament efficiently taken into the body. According to this method, a medicament can be easily administered in a subcutaneous manner without using a special machine for medication (see Patent Literature 1). Each of the needle portions of the needle-like structure is required to have a slenderness and a point angle for puncturing the skin, and a length for allowing subcutaneous penetration of a medicinal solution, and thus is desired to have a diameter ranging from several micrometers to several hundred micrometers. It is said that each needle portion should desirably have a length of allowing the needle portion to pass through a cornified layer that is the outermost layer of the skin. The thickness of the cornified layer is slightly different depending on the site of the human body, but is about 20 µm in average. Beneath the cornified layer, there is an epidermis having a thickness of about 200 µm to 350 µm. Further, beneath the epidermis, there is a dermic layer throughout which capillary vessels are laid. Therefore, in order to have a medicament penetrated through the cornified layer, each needle portion is required to have a length of at least 20 µm or more. For the purpose of blood withdrawal, each needle portion is required to have a length of at least 350 µm or more. In general, approaches to manufacture such a needle-like structure are made by processing silicon. Silicon is a material widely used for manufacturing MEMS devices or semiconductors. Silicon is inexpensive and has excellent microscopic processability. In a proposed method of manufacturing a needle-like structure using silicon, a silicon dioxide film is formed on both surfaces of a silicon wafer, followed by patterning, crystal anisotropic etching applied from its front surface, and isotropic etching applied from its rear surface. Using this method, a needle portion having, for example, a length of not less than 500 µm and a width of not more than 200 µm can be manufactured. By arranging such needle portions in an array, blood can be more reliably withdrawn (see Patent Literature 2). Similarly, in another proposed method of manufacture, wet etching is applied to a silicon substrate to make use of the difference in etching rate between crystal orientations of a single crystal material of silicon (see Patent Literature 3). In still another method of manufacturing a needle-like structure, a material other than silicon is used. For example, needle portions are formed on one surface of a machine-processed steel plate by means of wire cutting. In this method, the angle is changed between upward cutting and downward cutting to control the dimension and shape of each needle portion to be formed (see Patent Literature 4). The material used for configuring a needle-like structure is required to be harmless to the human body in case a broken needle portion has remained in the human body. As such materials, biocompatible materials, including medical silicone resins, maltoses, polylactic acids, and dextrans, are expected to be used (see Patent Literature 5). In order to mass-manufacture a needle-like structure having such a microscopic structure at low cost, transfer molding is effective, as represented by injection molding, imprinting, casting, or the like. In performing molding using any of these methods, an original plate is required to be used, in which a concavo-convex that is an inversion of a desired form is provided. The manufacturing process is very important in order to form needle portions with tips that are required to be sharpened, at a high aspect ratio (a ratio of a height or a depth of a structure relative to a width thereof). The method using wet etching based on conventional art makes use of the difference in etching rate between crystal orientations. Therefore, a highly refined single crystal material is required to be used to manufacture the needle-like structure. The taper angle and the point angle of each needle portion are specified by the physical properties of the single crystal material. For this reason, it is difficult to design and manufacture needle portions, each having an appropriate shape and dimension, taking account of the configuration of the skin. In the method using wire cutting, upward cutting that has reached the peak of a needle portion cannot be immediately followed by downward cutting. Accordingly, as a matter of fact, cutting proceeds in horizontal direction by 1 to 20 µm. Therefore, each of the manufactured needle portions is formed into a pyramidal-trapezoid shape having a flat face at the tip, raising a problem of impairing puncture properties of the needle portions. In the needle-like structure in which needle portions are arrayed, a material is filled in a replicated plate of needle-like body in performing the transfer molding. However, as the density or the area of the array increases, filling properties of the material are problematically impaired. [Citation List] [Patent Literature] Patent Literature 1: USP6,183,434 Patent Literature 2: JP-A-2002-369816 Patent Literature 3: JP-A-2004-058265 Patent Literature 4: JP-A-2006-513811 Patent Literature 5: JP-A-2005-021677 [Summary of the Invention] [Technical Problem] In this way, the needle-like structure in which a plurality of microscopic needle portions are arrayed creates difficulty in appropriately designing the dimension and the shape of each of the tips of the needle portions, raising the problem of impairing puncture properties. Further, in filling a material in a replicated plate, there is a problem that filling properties of the material are deteriorated with the increase of the density or the area of the arrays of the replicated plate. The present invention has been made in order to solve the problems mentioned above and has as its object to provide a needle-like structure which enables appropriate designing of the dimension and the shape of the tip of each of needle portions and can improve the puncture properties of the needle portions. Further, the present invention has another object of providing a method for manufacturing a needle-like structure, which method is able to improve filling properties of a molding material in fabricating a needle-like structure by transfer molding. [Solution to Problem] The invention recited in claim 1 is a needle-like structure characterized in that the structure includes a plurality of rows of projections formed being unidirectionally extended on a substrate; and a plurality of needle portions formed being spaced part on each of the projections.

The invention recited in claim 7 is the method for manufacturing a needle-like structure according to claim 6, characterized in that, in performing grinding for forming the first and second linear grooves, the method uses a dicing blade having an inclined surface between a side surface and a tip surface. [Advantageous Effects of the Invention] According to the present invention, the needle portions are not simply formed on a flat portion but are formed on projections. With this configuration, the dimension and the shape of each of the needle portions are appropriately designed, and puncture properties are improved. Further, with this configuration, filling properties of a molding material can be improved in fabricating the needle-like structure by means of transfer molding. In particular, when a molding material is filled in a direction coinciding with the direction of the recess sub-patterns, the filling properties of the material are remarkably improved by the rows of recess sub-patterns.

[Description of Embodiments] With reference to the drawings, hereinafter are described some embodiments of the present invention. (First Embodiment) <Method for manufacturing a needle-like original plate> Fig. 1 is a perspective view illustrating a schematic configuration of a needle-like structure (needle-like original plate) related to a first embodiment of the present invention. In the figure, a reference sign 11 indicates a base substrate. On the substrate 11, a plurality of rows of projections 13 as sub-patterns are formed so as to be parallel to each other. Each projection 13 is formed thereon with a plurality of four-sided pyramidal needle portions 15. Each projection 13 as a sub-pattern has a trapezoidal cross section perpendicular to the direction of the rows of sub-patterns. Each needle portion 15 has a triangular cross section both along and perpendicular to the direction of the rows. One side surface of each projection 13 is flush with one side surface of each of the needle portions 15. For manufacturing the needle-like original plate of Fig. 1, a substrate is processed by grinding. The [grinding] herein refers to a processing that uses a grinding stone rotating at high speed to scrape an object to be processed with extremely hard and fine abrasive grain that configures the grinding stone. For example, a dicing blade may be used as the grinding stone. In the grinding of the present embodiment, a dicing blade mounted to an end of a spindle rotating at high speed may be used to form linear grooves in a substrate to be processed. A dicing blade is formed in an outer peripheral portion of a disk-shaped base. It is desirable that the material of the dicing blade has a high hardness. Generally, diamond abrasive grain is used as such a material in many cases. In the present embodiment as well, a diamond wheel may be used, which has a disk-shaped base, with a dicing blade that contains diamond abrasive grain being formed throughout an outer peripheral surface thereof. Diamond wheels are widely used in cutting substrates in the semiconductor industries, and easily available at low cost. Usually, a dicing blade has a cross-sectional shape in which a side surface meets a tip surface at an angle of 90° to form a peak. In contrast, the dicing blade used in a method for manufacturing a needle-like original plate of the present embodiment has a side surface, a tip surface, and an inclined surface which is formed in between the side and tip surfaces. The angle of inclination of the inclined surface determines a side-wall angle of each needle portion to be finally formed. Thus, the inclined surface of the dicing blade can control the side-wall angle of each needle portion to be formed. Figs. 2 and 3 each illustrate a process of manufacturing the needle-like structure illustrated in Fig. 1. Fig. 2 is a cross-sectional view and Fig. 3 is a perspective view. First, as shown in Fig. 2 by (a), the base substrate 11 in a plate-like shape is prepared. The material of the substrate 11 is not limited in particular but may desirably be selected, taking account of processability or easy availability. Specifically, such materials include: ceramics, such as alumina, aluminum nitride, and machinable ceramics; crystalline materials, such as silicon, silicon carbide, and quartz; organic materials, such as acryl, and polyacetal; metallic materials, such as nickel, and aluminum; and glass. Then, as shown in Fig. 2 by (b) and Fig. 3 by (a), a surface of the substrate 11 is diced by the dicing blade in rotation to form a first linear groove 12 along a first direction by a predetermined length. In this case, grinding conditions, such as the number of rotations and the grinding speed of the dicing blade, are not particularly limited, but may desirably be optimized to conditions that ensure excellent processability, taking account of the materials of the dicing blade and the substrate. The first linear groove 12 has a side surface whose inclination coincides with that of the inclined surface formed at an end of the dicing blade. Then, as shown in Fig. 3 by (b), an adjacent first linear groove 12 is formed so as to be parallel to the first linear groove 12. In other words, using the dicing blade, another first linear groove 12 is machined adjacent to the first linear groove 12. In this case, the dicing blade may be moved relative to the initial first linear groove 12, with the inclined surface being partially overlapped therewith. This can prevent the tip from being flattened, but can ensure a sharp tip, contributing to effectively manufacturing the needle-like structure having excellent puncture properties. In machining a plurality of first linear grooves 12, it is desirable that the grooves are diced parallel to the first linear groove 21. Adjacently located first linear grooves 12 are formed in this way. In forming adjacently located first linear grooves 12, the inclined surface of the dicing blade in forming one first linear groove 12 is overlapped with the inclined surface of the dicing blade in forming the other first linear groove 12 to form the peak of a tip between the grooves. Thus, as shown in Fig. 3 by (b), a row of the projection 13 is formed, with its tip being in a sharp shape. The height of the row of projection 13 is determined by the depth of dicing, the angle of the inclined surface at the end of the dicing blade, and the distance between adjacent first linear grooves 12. As shown in Fig. 3 by (c), the dicing blade is translated on both sides of the projection 13 to broaden the width of the first linear groove 12. Further, in a similar manner as mentioned above and as shown in Fig. 3 by (d), another projection 13 is formed. Rows of projections 13 are formed in this way by a desired number, resultantly obtaining a substrate with a surface on which a plurality of rows of projections 13 each having a substantially triangular cross section are formed. In this case, the number of rows of the needle portions in a needle-like structure to be manufactured is determined by the number of rows of projections 13 formed as described above. Then, as shown in Fig. 2 by (c) and Fig. 1 previously referred to, a plurality of second linear grooves 14 are provided along a second direction that intersects the first linear grooves 12. In this case, the substrate 11 provided with the first linear grooves 12 is turned, for example, by 90 degrees, so that the second linear grooves 14 can be formed using a method similar to the one used in forming the first linear grooves 12. In this case, the plurality of first linear grooves 12 intersect the plurality of second linear grooves 14 at an angle equal to the angle of the turn of the substrate. In providing the second linear grooves 14, an adjustment is required to be made in the depth of dicing, the angle of the inclined surface at the end of the dicing blade, and the overlapped distance of the plurality of second linear grooves 14, so that the needle portions to be formed have a height smaller than that of the rows of projections resulting from the formation of the plurality of first linear grooves 12. Further, in a shape resulting from machining the second linear grooves 14 in each row of projection 13, the needle portions 15 are integrated with the row of projection 13. On account of the characteristics of the machining, the needle portions 15 and the rows of projection 13 are formed, with a part of their side faces being flush with each other. The projection 13 may sometimes remain around the obtained needle portions 15 after forming the second linear grooves 14. When the remained projection 13 are required to be removed, dicing may be performed for the removal of the projections 13. In order to more sharpen the tip of each of the obtained needle portions 15, isotropic etching may be applied. The term "isotropic etching" herein is defined as including not only the etching that exhibits complete isotropy, but also the etching that slightly exhibits anisotropy but has a strong tendency of isotropy. By applying the isotropic etching, the tip of each of the needle portions 15 can be sharpened without being restricted by the crystal orientations of the substrate. The method of the isotropic etching can include, but not particularly limited to, a method performed by means of a dry etching device that uses electric discharge which is based on, for example, RIE, magnetron RIE, ECR, ICP, NLD, microwaves, helicon waves, or the like. Further, for example, dry etching may be performed using a gas, such as XeF2, or the like. After performing dry etching, the needle portions 15 are each in a shape isotropically shrunk by a constant length. By performing isotropic etching in this way, the shape of each of the needle portions 15 is adjusted into one that enables easier puncture. As described above, according to the present embodiment, a plurality of first linear grooves 12 are formed along the first distance to form a plurality of projections 13 each having a triangular cross section perpendicular to the first direction. Further, the second linear grooves 14 are formed along the second direction so as to have a smaller depth than the first linear grooves 12. Thus, a plurality of needle portions 15 are formed on each of the projections 13, each needle portion 15 having a triangular cross section perpendicular to the second direction. In this way, a needle-like structure with arrayed needle portions 15 can be fabricated. The fabricated needle-like structure is different from the one in which the needle portions 15 are simply formed on a flat portion, but is the one in which the needle portions are formed on the projections 13. Accordingly, puncture properties with respect to the skin can be improved. This owes to the fact that the grooves are formed on both sides of each of the needle portions and that the height of the essential projections is made larger. Further, the needle portions 15, which are formed by grinding, not by wet etching, can each be machined so as to have an appropriate shape and dimension. In addition, the first linear grooves 12 are not required to have a strictly controlled depth, but only the second linear grooves 14 are required to have a strictly controlled depth. This leads to an advantage of facilitating machining compared to the case where the needle portions 15 are formed on a flat portion. (Second Embodiment) <Method for manufacturing a replicated plate of needle-like body> Subsequently, a filler layer is formed on the needle-like original plate manufactured through the method described above and then the filler layer is separated from the needle-like original plate to thereby form a replicated plate of needle-like body. Fig. 4 shows cross sectional views illustrating a process of manufacturing the replicated plate of needle-like body. First, as shown in Fig. 4 by (a), the original plate 10 of needle-like body as fabricated in the first embodiment is prepared. Then, as shown in Fig. 4 by (b), a filler layer 26 is formed on the original plate 10 of needle-like body. The material of the filler layer 26 is not particularly limited, but can be selected taking account of shape-following properties sufficient for exerting the function as a replicated plate, and transferability, durability and releasability in transfer molding described later. For example, the filler layer may be made of nickel, thermosetting silicone resins, and the like. When nickel is selected, the filler layer 26 may be formed by means of plating, PVD, CVD, or the like. Then, as shown in Fig. 4 by (c), the original plate 10 of needle-like body is released from the filler layer 26, thereby fabricating a replicated plate. The replicated plate is in a pattern that is an inversion of the original plate 10 of needle-like body. The replicated plate includes a substrate 21 whose surface portion is provided with rows of recesses 23 corresponding to the rows of projections 13, and grooves 25 corresponding to the needle-portions 15, the grooves 25 being provided in each of the recesses 23. The filler layer 26 can be released from the original plate 10 of needle-like body by means of a method that uses a physical release force, or by means of selective etching, or the like. Thus, according to the present embodiment, an integrally molded replicated plate having high mechanical strength can be fabricated. Using a single replicated plate, a large number of needle-like structures can be manufactured, which contributes to reducing the manufacturing cost and enhancing productivity. (Third Embodiment) <Transfer molding of a needle-like structure> Subsequently, a needle-like body forming material is formed on the replicated plate of needle-like body fabricated through the method described above, and the needle-like body forming material is released from the replicated plate to thereby form a needle-like structure. Fig. 5 shows cross-sectional views illustrating a process of manufacturing a needle-like structure. First, as shown in Fig. 5 by (a), a replicated plate 20 of needle-like body as fabricated in the second embodiment is prepared. Then, as shown in Fig. 5 by (b), a needle-like body forming material 36 is filled onto the replicated plate 20. The needle-like body forming material 36 includes, but not particularly limited to, biocompatible materials, such as medical silicone resins, maltoses, polylactic acids, dextrans, and sugars. Using such materials, a needle-like structure that is applicable to an organism can be formed. Use of the biocompatible materials can exert an effect of being harmless in the event that any one of the needle portions is broken and remained inside the organism. The method of filling the needle-like body forming material 36 is not particularly limited, but roll molding may be particularly desirable. Besides, imprinting, hot embossing, injection molding, extrusion molding, or casting may be favorably used. When roll molding is used, it is important to fill the material so as to be parallel to the rows of recesses. Therefore, as shown in Fig. 6, the direction of moving a roller 40 is permitted to coincide with a direction in which the recesses 23 are arrayed. Thus, as shown in Fig. 7, when the roller 40 is pressed against the resin 36, the recesses 23 serve as escape routes for the resin. Accordingly, the resin 36 can be favorably filled in the grooves 25. In other words, since the recesses 23 as sub-patterns play a roll of channels for the material, filling properties of the material with respect to the grooves 25 are improved. Then, the needle-like body forming material 36 is released from the replicated plate 20 to obtain a transfer-molded needle-like structure 30. The obtained needle-like structure 30 has a configuration in which rows of projections 33 are provided on a substrate 31, with a plurality of needle portions 35 being provided on each of the projections 33. In other words, the configuration substantially similar to the one illustrated in Fig. 1 is obtained. In order to improve the releasability of the replicated plate 20, a release layer for enhancing release effect may be formed on a surface of the replicated plate 20, prior to filling the needle-like body forming material 36. The release layer may be made, for example, of a well-known fluorinated resin. Further, the method for forming the release layer that can be used favorably includes a thin-film forming method, such as PVD, CVD, spin coating, dip coating, or the like. In this way, according to the present embodiment, filling properties of a molding material can be improved in fabricating a needle-like structure by means of transfer molding. In particular, when a molding material is filled along a direction coinciding with the direction of the rows of recesses 23, the presence of the recesses 23 remarkably improve the filling properties of the material. Accordingly, when the density or the area of the array is increased, sufficient filling properties can be retained. Based on the first to third embodiments described above, a large number of needle-like structures can be manufactured with good dimensional accuracy. It should be noted that the method for manufacturing a needle-like structure of the present embodiments should not be construed as being limited to the one described in the above embodiments, but may include any other known methods that can be known by analogy from the individual processes. For example, a method as shown in Fig. 8 may be used as the method of transferring the needle-like structure from the replicated plate. Specifically, in the method, the replicated plate 20 is mounted to one roller 41, and the resin 36 is supplied onto other roller 42, followed by rotating the rollers 41 and 42 in a state of being located close to each other, thereby filling the resin 36. In the present invention, the rows of recesses can be formed throughout the periphery of a roller, and the needle-like structure can be fabricated by means of a roll-to-roll method. The needle-like structure of the present invention is more specifically described. Fig. 9 shows schematic diagrams of the needle-like structure of the present invention. Fig. 9 shows by (a) a perspective view, by (b) a cross-sectional view as seen from the direction of X, and by (c) a cross-sectional view as seen from the direction of Y. In the needle-like structure of the present invention, it is preferable that the needle portions 15 each have a height h1 which is not less than 100 µm but not more than 2,000 µm. The height of the needle portion is appropriately designed according to the purpose that is an extent of puncture into the skin. Further, it is preferable that the projections 13 each have a height h2 which is not less than 0.2×H but not more than 0.8H, where H is a sum of the height h1 of the needle portion 15 and the height h2 of the projection 13. If the height h2 of the projection is less than 0.2×H, the effect of the needle-like structure of the present invention is not necessarily well exerted. On the other hand, if the height h2 of the projection is more than 0.8xH, the strength of the needle-like structure may be lowered. Further, each of the needle portions 15 has a point angle θ1 in a cross section as viewed from the direction of X, and a point angle θ2 in a cross section as viewed from the direction of Y. Preferably, the point angles θ1 and θ2 are both not less than 10° but not more than 70°, more preferably, the point angles θ1 and θ2 are both not less than 20° but not more than 60°. The point angles of each of the needle portions are appropriately designed, taking account of the extent of puncture into the skin. In addition, it is preferable that the substrate 11 of the needle-like structure of the present invention has a size of not less than 1 cm2, or more preferably, not less than 5 cm2. According to the needle-like structure and the method for manufacturing the needle-like structure of the present invention, a substrate having a larger size exerts higher effect. Fig. 10 shows schematic diagrams illustrating a needle-like structure (Modification 1) of the present invention. Fig. 10 shows by (a) a perspective view, by (b), a cross-sectional view as viewed from the direction of X, and by (c), a cross-sectional view as viewed from the direction of Y. The needle-like structure (Modification 1) of the present invention shown in Fig. 10 has needle portions that are different not only in the four-sided pyramidal shape but also in the width of the bottom. In this case, a width L1 of the bottom of the needle portion 14 as cross-sectionally viewed from the direction of X is larger than a width L2 of the bottom of the needle portion 15 as cross-sectionally viewed from the direction of Y (L1> L2). By making larger the width L1 of the needle portion 15 as cross-sectionally viewed from the direction of X than the width L2 of the needle portion 15 as cross-sectionally viewed from the direction of Y, the molding material can be filled much better. Fig. 11 shows schematic diagrams illustrating a needle-like structure (Modification 2) of the present invention. Fig. 11 shows by (a) a perspective view, by (b), a cross-sectional view as viewed from the direction of X, and by (c), a cross-sectional view as viewed from the direction of Y. In the needle-like structure (Modification 2) of the present invention shown in Fig. 11, an angle φ1 between a side surface of the needle portion 15 and a top surface of the projection 13 as cross-sectionally viewed from the direction of Y, is made larger than an angle φ2 between a side surface of the projection 13 and the base substrate 11 as cross-sectionally viewed from the direction of Y (φ1>φ2). Although the needle-like structure shown in Fig. 11 has more number of fabrication steps than the needle-like structure shown in Fig. 9, a molding material can be filled much better. When the point angle of each needle portion is made smaller for the purpose of improving puncture properties in relation to the skin, the filling properties of the molding material are further impaired. In this regard, the needle-like structure shown in Fig. 11 can eliminate the problem of impairing the filling properties of a molding material. Fig. 12 shows schematic diagrams illustrating a needle-like structure (Modification 3) of the present invention. Fig. 12 shows by (a) a perspective view, by (b), a cross-sectional view as viewed from the direction of X, and by (c), a cross-sectional view as viewed from the direction of Y. In the needle-like structure (Modification 3) of the present invention shown in Fig. 12, an angle φ1 between a side surface of the needle portion 15 and a top surface of the projection 13 as cross-sectionally viewed from the direction of Y, is made smaller than an angle φ2 between a side surface of the projection 13 and the base substrate 11 as cross-sectionally viewed from the direction of Y (φ1<φ2). Fig. 13 shows schematic diagrams illustrating a needle-like structure (Modification 4) of the present invention. Fig. 13 shows by (a) a perspective view, by (b), a cross-sectional view as viewed from the direction of X, and by (c), a cross-sectional view as viewed from the direction of Y. In the needle-like structure (Modification 4) of the present invention shown in Fig. 13, the projection 13 as cross-sectionally viewed from the direction of Y is in a rectangular shape. Fig. 14 shows schematic diagrams illustrating a needle-like structure (Modification 5) of the present invention. Fig. 14 shows by (a) a perspective view, by (b), a cross-sectional view as viewed from the direction of X, and by (c), a cross-sectional view as viewed from the direction of Y. In the needle-like structure (Modification 5) of the present invention shown in Fig. 14, a width L2 of the bottom of the needle portion 15 as cross-sectionally viewed from the direction of Y, is made smaller than a width L3 of the bottom of the needle portion as cross-sectionally viewed from the direction of Y. In the needle-like structure of the present invention, it is preferable that the width L2 of the bottom of the needle portion 15 as cross-sectionally viewed from the direction of Y ranges from not less than L3×0.6 to not more than L3. Being out of this range, the effect of the present invention cannot be necessarily sufficiently exerted. In Fig. 9, one side surface of the projection is ensured to be flush with one side surface of each of the needle portions. However, the needle-like structure of the present invention does not have to necessarily have such side surfaces that are flush with each other. In an embodiment, grinding has been only unidirectionally performed in machining the needle portions to reduce grinding. However, if grinding is performed bidirectionally, the inclination of the side surface of each of the needle portions can be made steeper than the inclination of the side surface of the projection. This is effective when the tip of each needle portion is to be more sharpened. In the needle-like structure of the present invention, the first direction in which the first linear grooves are formed does not have to be necessarily perpendicular to the second direction in which the second linear grooves are formed. These directions may only have to intersect with each other. [Examples] Hereinafter are described more specific examples of the needle-like structure and the method for manufacturing the same, according to the present embodiments. <Example 1> First, referring to Fig. 3 again, the process of manufacturing the needle-like original plate is described. The dicing blade used in Example 1 was the one that had been machined so as to possess an inclined surface. The dicing blade had a thickness of 1 mm, and a width of 200 µm in the tip surface, and an angle of 160° between a side surface and the inclined surface. The angle of inclination of the inclined surface determines a side-wall angle of the needle-like structure to be finally formed. The inclined surface at the tip of the dicing blade in the present example was selected to be 160° in order that each four-sided pyramidal needle portion to be finally formed had a point angle of 40°. The base substrate 11 used was an alumina substrate. Then, in the dicing using the dicing blade, a step of forming a first linear groove 12 on a surface of the alumina substrate 11 was performed. First, the alumina substrate 11 in a square shape of 100 mm on a side with a thickness of 3 mm was prepared. Then, a surface of the alumina substrate 11 was diced, rotating the dicing blade, to a depth of 300 µm, and a groove having a length of 100 mm was formed. Through the dicing described above, the first linear groove 12 was formed as shown in Fig. 3 by (a). The first linear groove 12 had a width of about 418 µm across the opening on top and a depth of 600 µm. The inclination of a side surface of the first linear groove 12 was in conformity with the inclination of the inclined surface formed at the end of the dicing blade, and thus, in the present example, the angle between the surface of the alumina substrate 11 and the side surface of the first linear groove 12 was 110°. Then, a groove was machined adjacent to the first linear groove 12 using the dicing blade under the same conditions as those in machining the first linear groove 12. In this case, the groove was machined by the dicing blade such that the groove overlapped the first linear groove 12 by a width of 100 µm. The groove was ground parallel to the first linear groove 12. Thus, as shown in Fig. 3 by (b), a first linear groove 12 having a depth of 600 µm and a length of 100 µm was formed adjacent to the first linear groove 12. Thus, a projection 13, with its tip being in a sharp shape, was formed between the adjacently located linear grooves 12. In the same manner as in forming the first linear groove 12, first linear grooves 12 were sequentially formed, thereby obtaining a substrate in which a plurality of rows of projections 13 of a desired number were formed. In the present example, a total of 251 first linear grooves 12 were fabricated. As a result, 250 rows of projections 13 were formed. The rows of projections 13 each had a height of 324 µm, a width of 236 µm in the base, and a point angle of 40°. Then, the alumina substrate 11 was turned by 90°, and second linear grooves 24 were diced by a number 250 in a manner similar to the one in forming the first linear grooves 12, but with the machining depth being reduced by 162 µm compared to the step of forming the first linear grooves 12. As a result, an original plate 10 of needle-like body was obtained, in which a total of 62,500 needle portions 15 were formed at a pitch of 400 µm on the rows of projections 13, being uniformly arranged on the alumina substrate 11 of 100 mm on a side. In the present example, the needle portions 15 obtained in this instance were each in a four-sided pyramidal shape with a point angle of 40°, a height of 162 µm, and a width of 118 µm on a side of the bottom. Referring to Fig. 4 again, hereinafter is described a process of manufacturing a replicated plate. First, in order to replicate the fabricated original plate 10 of needle-like body, a replicated plate 20 was made using the original plate 10 of needle-like, followed by transfer molding. First, a nickel film as a filler layer 26 was formed on a surface of the original plate 10 of needle-like body by means of plating. Then, the nickel film 26 was released from the original plate 10 of needle-like body to thereby fabricate the replicated plate 20. The replicated plate 20 was confirmed to have rows of recesses 23 which corresponded to inverted rows of projections 13. Subsequently, referring to Fig. 5 again, a process of manufacturing the needle-like structure is described. First, an epoxy resin as a needle-like body forming material 36 was filled in the replicated plate 20 by means of roll molding. In filling the material, pressure molding was performed in a direction coinciding with the direction of the rows of recesses 23 by means of a laminator device, thereby obtaining a needle-like structure 30 made of the epoxy resin. The obtained needle-like structure made of the epoxy resin is the one in which a number of needle portions 35 are arranged on rows of projections 33. In this case, the projections 33 each had a height h2 of 159 µm. Needle portions 35 each had point angles θ1 and θ2 of 40°, a height h1 of 159 µm, and a width of 115 µm on a side of the bottom. In the obtained needle-like structure, one side surface of each projection 33 was flush with one side surface of each of the needle portions 35. In the obtained needle-like structure, each of the needle portions was confirmed to be molded to the tip thereof. As a comparative example, a needle-like original plate of the same design (four-sided pyramid having a point angle of 40°, a needle height of 162 µm and a width of 118 µm on a side of the bottom) with no rows of projections 13 was formed, followed by preparing a replicated plate from the original plate. Roll molding was performed under the same conditions as described above, but the filling properties of the epoxy resin were bad, and thus each of the needle portions was not completely formed to the tip thereof. As a result, it was confirmed that the recesses as the sub-patterns arranged in the replicated plate contributed to the improvement of roll molding properties. <Example 2> The replicated plate made of nickel fabricated in Example 1 was used. As shown in Fig. 5, the replicated plate was heated, followed by roll molding to fill a polypropylene resin as the needle-like body forming material 36 into the replicated plate 20. In filling the resin, press molding was performed in a direction coinciding with the direction of the rows of recesses 23 by means of a laminator device. As a result, a needle-like structure 30 made of the polypropylene resin was obtained. The obtained needle-like structure 30 made of the polypropylene resin was the one in which a number of needle portions 35 were arranged on the rows of projections 33. In this case, the projections 33 each had a height h2 of 159 µm. The needle portions 35 each had point angles θ1 and θ2 of 40°, a height h1 of 159 µm, and a width of 115 µm on a side of the bottom. In the obtained needle-like structure, one side surface of each projection 33 was flush with one side surface of each of the needle portions 35. In the obtained needle-like structure, each of the needle portions was confirmed to be molded to the tip thereof. The needle-like structure of the present invention is applicable to not only medical treatment, but also various fields that require microscopic needle portions. For example, the needle-like structure of the present invention can be variously applied, such as to MEMS devices, optical members, drug development, cosmetic products, and beauty usages.
