Shoulder Replacement Apparatus Background This invention relates to apparatus to facilitate the placement of shoulder prostheses, and in particular the placement of the glenoid part of shoulder any prostheses. The replacement of damaged joints by prostheses is a well-established medical treatment to restore the function of a joint. In order to function correctly, and to provide the maximum lifetime for the prosthesis, it must be implanted in an optimum position. Placement in a ηοηoptimal position may result in restricted movement of the joint, an increased rate of wear, and an increased rate of loosening of prostheses. Accurate placement of a prosthesis is therefore a critical part of the joint replacement process. Partial, total Shoulder or reverse shoulder arthroplasty are effective treatments for damaged shoulder joints and in particular for shoulder arthritis. In a Total Shoulder Arthroplasty both the humeral and glenoid sides of the shoulder joint are replaced by prosthetic components. In a Partial Shoulder Arthroplasty only the humeral side is replaced. A reverse total shoulder arthroplasty, utilised in cases of associated rotator cuff deficiency, both sides of the joint are replaced, but a socket replaces the humeral head and a metaglenoid replaces the glenoid of the scapula. There is general consensus that the success of total or partial shoulder arthroplasties is dependent on restoring the natural anatomy of the shoulder joint. Significant developments have been made with regard to the humeral side of shoulder prostheses, but recent observations have indicated that loosening rates for glenoid prostheses are very high and that glenoid loosening is the main complication after a total shoulder arthroplasty. Implanting the glenoid component of a shoulder prosthesis in the optimum position is a difficult process due to, inter alia, limited bone stock of the native glenoid, poor understanding of the optimum position, and a lack of visible landmarks to assist in placement during surgery. In a typical shoulder arthroplasty to replace the glenoid either supero-lateral or delto-pectoral approaches are made in the patient's outer, upper, arm. The humeral head is cut and the humerus is moved aside to provide a view of the glenoid surface. Only this surface, which is often deformed due to wear, is available as a guide to positioning the prosthetic glenoid and based on this limited information it is difficult for surgeons to accurately locate the optimum position. Hence, the usefulness of the limited information is further degraded by erosion of the existing glenoid surface due to, for example, arthritis. In such circumstances the surgeon will place the glenoid prosthesis based on the visible surface as if it was in its original anatomical position. The surgeon is forced to estimate the original location based on pre-operative CTscans, but without operative guidance assistance, this can lead to significant errors in position. In reverse arthroplasty procedures the positioning of the metaglenoid is known to affect the rate of scapula notches in the resulting joint. Comparable considerations apply to reverse shoulder arthroplasty procedures as to conventional shoulder arthroplasty procedures. The embodiments described below are not limited to implementations which solve any or all of the disadvantages discussed above. Summary This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter. There is provided a surgical device for guiding a key wire during a shoulder arthroplasty procedure, comprising a guide for guiding a key wire during the process of drilling into a scapula, and clamp means configured to engage with the scapula neck such that a key wire located in the guide is located in a predetermined geometrical relationship with the scapula neck.

The expanded diameter portion may be located proximal to one end of the key wire and the measurement indicator extends along the key wire towards the end of the key wire distal from the expanded diameter portion. The measurement indicator may comprise markings on the surface of the key wire. There is also provided a kit comprising a surgical device and a key wire as described hereinbefore. There is also provided a key wire for use in a shoulder arthroplasty procedures comprising a tip portion at a first end of the key wire comprising a pointed end, a body portion have a drill bit portion adjoining the tip portion and a measurement indicator, the measurement indicator extends along the key wire towards the end of the key distal from the tip portion, wherein the body portion has a larger diameter than the base of the tip portion. The preferred features may be combined as appropriate, as would be apparent to a skilled person, and may be combined with any of the aspects of the invention.

Detailed Description Embodiments of the present invention are described below by way of example only. These examples represent the best ways of putting the invention into practice that are currently known to the Applicant although they are not the only ways in which this could be achieved. The description sets forth the functions of the example and the sequence of steps for constructing and operating the example. However, the same or equivalent functions and sequences may be accomplished by different examples. As noted previously, optimum performance of shoulder prostheses is obtained by replicating the natural anatomy of the shoulder joint. To achieve correct placement of the glenoid prosthesis a reliable indication of that placement is required. However, as discussed previously, such an indication is difficult to obtain due to the limited surgical opening utilised to place the glenoid prosthesis, and potential erosion of the natural glenoid surface. Figure 1 shows a diagram of the scapula bone 10 which includes the glenoid surface 11. The glenoid surface is located adjacent the scapula neck which leads to the main body of the scapula. A well-positioned prosthesis will replicate the anatomical position of the glenoid surface shown in this diagram. The dimensions of scapulas vary between people and therefore the precise dimensions and location of the glenoid surface may vary between patient and thus the correct location for a prosthesis must be determined on a case-by-case basis. An analysis of scapula bone dimensions has been performed using 20 CT scans performed for reasons unrelated to shoulder problems. Figures 2, 3 and 4 show anterior, posterior and top views of a scapula obtained using a CT scan. Measurement points have been overlaid on to the image to define various planes for measurement and analysis. A glenoid plane is defined using points on the inferior 2/3 of the glenoid outer edge. A scapula neck plane is defined using points on the anterior 20 and posterior 30 of the scapula neck. A scapula blade plane is defined using points 21 along the lateral border of the scapula and the deepest part of the supraspinatus fossa 40. In the following disclosure, the term 'perpendicular scapula blade' refers to a plane perpendicular to the actual, physical, scapula blade. Glenoid retroversion Figure 5 shows a schematic representation of the scapula blade plane 50, the scapula neck plane 51 and the glenoid plane 52, when viewed from above. Table 1 shows the statistics of the glenoid retroversion seen in this view.

The Scapula neck/ Scapula Blade is measured between the superioinferior axis 74 located in the scapula neck plane 71 and centrally between the anterior and posterior points. The Glenoid/Scapula neck angle is measured between axis 73 and axis 74. Glenoid offset to scapula blade Figure 8 shows a schematic representation of the scapula blade plane 80, the scapula neck plane 81 and the glenoid plane 82, when viewed from the outer lateral direction in the perpendicular scapula blade plane. Table 4 shows the statistical values of the offset position in this view.

The offset between the Scapula neck and scapula blade plane is measured between the geometric centre 84 of the scapula neck points and the projection of this point on the scapula blade plane 80. Glenoid offset to scapula neck Figure 9 shows a schematic representation of the scapula blade plane 90, the scapula neck plane 91 and the glenoid plane 92, when viewed from the outer lateral direction in the scapula neck plane. Table 5 shows the statistical values of the offset position in this view. Table 5 Centre of glenoid centre of neck of scapula Average (mm) 0.3 SD 0.5 Min 0 Max 1.5 These measurements show that the anatomical glenoid position is closely related to the position of the measured locations on the scapula neck. The locations on the scapula neck can therefore be utilised as a guide for positioning a glenoid prosthesis in the anatomical position. In relation to the scapula neck, the average position for the anatomically positioned glenoid is with a retroversion angle of 2.1° and a superior inclination of 1.9°. The glenoid is not circular and a rotation of 5.2° is the average rotation relative to the angle of the scapula neck. Placement of a prosthetic glenoid in this position is therefore, on average, the optimum position. The data above also indicate that the range of positions is limited, providing evidence that the average position is not an extremely wrong position in any patient. For example, the average retroversion is 2.1° with a range of 0° to 5°. The maximum error by placement in the average position in any of the scapulas assessed would therefore be 2.9°. Measurements have indicated that current methods result in an average retroversion between the scapula blade plane and the glenoid of 5.76°, which is close to the anatomical average shown in Table 1 of 6.1°. However, the range of retroversion angles with current methods is -19° to 32°, with a standard deviation of 12.29°. The range shown in Table 1 is only -1° to 13°, with a standard deviation of 3.4°. This suggests significant errors in the placement of Glenoid prostheses using existing methods. The above analysis shows that the centre of the glenoid and the centre of the scapula neck are aligned with an accuracy of 0.3+/-0.5η∩η∩. Therefore, in case of spatial deterioration of the glenoid due to wear, the scapula neck locations provide a strong indication of the desired glenoid centre location. Figure 10 shows a schematic diagram of a tool 100 to assist in the placement of a glenoid shoulder prosthesis in the anatomical position. Arm portions 101 are hinged together to allow relative rotation between the two arms. One end of each arm 101 is terminated in a grip portion 102 and the other end in a handle portion 103. Latching means 104 are provided to latch the tool in a required position. A guide 105 for guiding a key wire is provided in a predetermined orientation relative to the grip portions 102. The tool may be formed from any material with the required mechanical properties suitable for the construction of surgical instruments, for example metal. The grip portions 102 may be shaped to improve stability of the tool when it is located on a scapula in the required location. For example, the grip portions 102 may be cylindrical with a diameter selected to match the expected location. Other shapes may be utilised as appropriate to engage with a scapula neck. The grip portions 102 may be detachable from the arm portions 101. The grip portions 102 may be formed in the same or different materials to the remainder of the tool. For example, polyethylene may be utilised for the grip portions, and metal for the other parts of the tool. The grip portions 102 are configured to engage with the neck of a scapula in the position shown above. Figure 11 show the tool in position on a scapula and with a key wire aligned with the axis of the tool demonstrating the correct alignment of that key wire. The predetermined orientation of the guide is selected according to the above data such that a key wire can be placed in a required position relative to the scapula neck. The key wire can thus be utilised to position a glenoid prosthesis in the required position relative to the scapula neck to recreate the anatomical glenoid position. In a particular embodiment the guide provides a key wire orientation with a retroversion angle of 2.1° and a superior inclination of 1.9° relative to the scapula neck. As will be apparent to the reader, these angles are between the axis of the key wire and a plane perpendicular to the scapula neck plane. Although these are different to the planes and axis utilised above to analyse the anatomical retroversion, both have been shifted through 90° and therefore the values are consistent. The guide is positioned along the axis of the tool and therefore the key wire offset to the centre scapula neck is zero. As per the above analysis this is extremely close to the anatomical offset which has an average value of 0.3mm. In other embodiments the orientation may vary. For example, the retroversion may lie in a range of 0.4° to 3.8°, or in a range from 0° to 5°, and the superior inclination may lie in the range from 0.3° to 3.5°, or in a range from 0° to 5°. In other embodiments specific offsets may be provided other than zero in the embodiment described above. For example, the offset may lie in a range from -0.2mm to 0.8mm, or in a range from 0mm to 1.5mm. The arms of the tool may be detachable to allow the tool to be positioned more easily. For example, the grip portions of each arm of the tool may be placed into position on the scapula and then joined to form the completed tool. Such a system reduces the space required around the glenoid to manoeuvre the tool into position. The detachable pivot may be constructed in any suitable manner, as will be apparent to the skilled reader. Furthermore, such a detachable tool may not require a pivot between the two arms, but other means of attachment between the arms to enable the tool to be secured to the scapula may be utilised. Such alternatives may also be applicable to tools without detachable arms. The guide means for the key wire may be a hole through which the key wire may be passed, as shown in Figure 10. The alignment of the hole guides the key wire to the correct location. Other forms of guide means will be apparent to the skilled person. Some or all of the guide means may be adjustable to allow variation of the angles and offsets of the guides by the surgeon. It is common to insert two key wires to provide a rotational reference for cutting the prosthesis mounting into the scapula. As shown in Figure 12, to facilities such placement the tool may be provided with an attachment point 120 for a second key wire guide 121. As shown in Figure 12 a range of positions for the second key wire may be provided. The first guide is utilised to position the first key wire, and the required one of the second guides is selected to position the second key wire. As demonstrated in the above analysis a rotation of 5.2° may be utilised to restore the average anatomical rotation of the glenoid. A second guide may therefore be provided to provide this angle between the two guide wires relative to the scapula neck. In other embodiments the angle may lie in the range of 4.1° to 6.3°, or in the range from 3° to 7°. Where more than one second guide is provided, they are positioned at defined locations with respect to the first guide to allow tailoring of the tool to specific patients. Furthermore, one second guide, or set of second guides, may be provided for use on right scapulas, and one second guide, or set of second guides, for use on left scapulas, as the angles are mirrored for each side. The use of two guide wires allows the rotation of the prosthetic glenoid to be set to a predetermined position. In a particular embodiment the second guide may be positioned to allow location of the glenoid with a rotation of 5.2° relative to the scapula neck. In other embodiments the rotation may be in the range 4.1° to 6.3°, or in the range from 3° to 7°. The relationship of the two key wires to achieve these angles will depend on the design of the prosthetic glenoid and the tools utilised to machine the scapula to accept the prosthesis. A further component may be provided to attach to the two placed key wires to allow adjustment of the version of the glenoid attachment location. The tool described hereinbefore is utilised in an operation as described below to implant a glenoid prosthesis during a shoulder arthroplasty procedure. The initial stages of the operation to gain access to the glenoid are conducted as in conventional operations. Once the existing glenoid is exposed, the guide tool is clamped onto the scapula with the grip portions located in the defined position on the scapula neck. As described previously, with the grip portion located in this position the tool, and hence guide part, is located in the predetermined orientation relative to the scapula neck and hence to the anatomical glenoid position. Once positioned the guide is utilised to guide the positioning of a key-wire that will guide further steps; in particular the reaming of the glenoid and the drilling of hole(s) utilised to fix the glenoid implant to the scapula. Utilising the guide tool ensures the drilled key-wire is located in the centre of the scapula neck and is at the correct angle to penetrate within the centre of the scapula neck. This is achieved using the known orientation parameters as discussed above and according to which the guide tool is constructed. In prior art techniques where the drilling position is guided by the visible glenoid surface the angle of the key wire may be incorrect such that the drill approaches, or exits, the surface of the scapula bone. In a particular embodiment the key wire is positioned with a retroversion angle of 2.1° and a superior inclination of 1.9° relative to the scapula neck. In other embodiments the orientation may vary. For example, the retroversion of the key wire may lie in a range of 0.4° to 3.8° or in a range from 0° to 5° relative to the scapula neck, and the superior inclination may lie in the range from 0.3° to 3.5° or in a range from 0° to 5° relative to the scapula neck. In a particular embodiment the key wire is positioned along the centre of the scapula neck. In other embodiments the key wire may be positioned with an offset of 0.3mm, or with an offset lying in the range from -0.2mm to 0.8mm, or in a range from 0mm to 1.5mm. In a particular embodiment two key wires are inserted along an axis at an angle of 5.2° to the centre of the scapula neck. In other embodiments the angle may lie in the range of 4.1° to 6.3°, or in the range from 3° to 7° Following positioning of the key wire the replacement may proceed according to conventional processes using the key wire position to drill the hole(s) for the implant fixation and to guide the shaping of the glenoid to accept the prosthesis and thereby ensure the correct positioning of the glenoid prosthesis with respect to the original anatomic position. A guide tool constructed according to the statistical analysis described above was constructed an utilised in a shoulder arthroplasty. Figure 13a shows an axial view of a CT scan prior to a shoulder arthroplasty procedure utilising the techniques described herein. Axis 130 marks surface of the glenoid which has suffered posterior wear. Axis 131 marks the surface of the anatomical glenoid position, calculated utilising the above techniques. The arthroplasty procedure was conducted utilising the technique and tools described above. As shown in Figure 13b the prosthetic glenoid is positioned in accordance with the anatomical position indicating correct implementation and good alignment of the prosthesis. In prior art techniques the prosthesis would have been positioned in accordance with axis 130, resulting in significant errors in position and likely premature failure of the joint. In the foregoing description the positioning of the glenoid is defined based on the statistical analysis set out above. In variations of the apparatus and techniques described herein the position may also or alternatively be defined based on pre-operative imaging of the patient. Such imaging may allow the positioning of the glenoid to more accurately match the particular shape of the patient's scapula. Pre-operative imaging may be utilised in conjunction with the above statistical data to provide an improved position based on the combined data. The tool described above may be provided with moveable guides to allow adjustments based on pre-operative imaging. Figure 14 shows an apparatus to facilitate placing a glenoid prosthesis at the required lateral offset. The apparatus comprises a key wire 140 with a sharp end 141 and an enlarged diameter 142 at the base of the point A measurement scale 142 is provided along at least part of the length of the key wire to provide an indication of distance from the sharp end. Figure 14 is not drawn to scale, but is greatly exaggerated in the vertical direction to clearly show the enlarged diameter region. The enlarged diameter region is not restricted to any particular form and may be located in other positions that directly at the base of the point. Figure 14 shows one possible example but any other shape suitable for insertion through a hole and retention therein may also be utilised. The measurement scale may be marked along the length of the key wire, for example by etched or printed markings, or any suitable means of indicating position. The key wire of Figure 14 is utilised in a two-step procedure for the placement of the key wire. A hole is drilled into the glenoid in the required orientation, for example as described previously using the guide tool described hereinbefore. The drill size is selected to accept the enlarged diameter region in frictional contact with the walls of the resulting hole. The hole is drilled to a depth at which resistance from the deep glenoid corticalis is felt though the drill. The key wire is then inserted into the hole, optionally utilising the guide tool. An initial resistance will be felt when the point enters the corticalis at the base of the hole, and then an increase in resistance will be felt with the expanded diameter region reaches the base of the hole at which point insertion is stopped. The measurement scale thus provides a known reference for placement of the prosthetic glenoid in respect of its lateral offset, and for optimising the component fixation depth and shape to the dimension of the glenoid, in order to increase the component fixation strength. Figure 15 shows a CT scan overlaid with a schematic representation of the key wire of Figure 14 showing an exemplary final location. In an exemplary key wire, the enlarged diameter region of an exemplary 20/10℮ diameter key wire may have a diameter of 4 mm. A typical length is 20 cm. Figure 16 shows a combined drill and key wire 160 for guiding placement of a glenoid prosthesis. A first end of the key wire is provided with a point region 161 leading to a drill bit region 162 which has an enlarged diameter compared to the base of the point region. A measurement scale 163 is provided along at least part of the length of the key wire to provide an indication of distance from the first end. In use a hole is drilled using the key wire of Figure 16 and optionally utilising the guide tool described hereinbefore. An increased resistance will be felt as the point enters the deep corticalis of the glenoid and a subsequent increase in resistance will be felt when the enlarged diameter of the drill bit region enters the corticalis. Drilling is stopped when that second resistance is felt. The measurement scale then provides a known reference for placement of the prosthetic glenoid in respect of its lateral offset. Figure 17 shows a CT scan overlaid with a schematic representation of the key wire of Figure 16 showing an exemplary final location. An exemplary key wire according to Figure 16 may be utilise a 40/10 drill bit and key wire, with a 20/10e tip and having a total length of 20cm.
