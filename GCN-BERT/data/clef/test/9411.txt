CIRCULAR SCALPEL FOR ANTERIOR CAPSULOTOMY OF THE LENS IN CATARACT SURGERY AND SCALPEL'S INJECTOR/EXTRACTOR SCOPE The present invention is primarily intended for a CIRCULAR SCALPEL FOR ANTERIOR CAPSULOTOMY OF THE LENS IN CATARACT SURGERY, which responds to a very special constructive and functional concept specially designed to simplify and make more precise the continuous circular capsulotomy which requires the surgical technique called phacoemulsification to remove the cloudy lens, and then including a transparent lens . More specifically, the present invention relates to a novel scalpel specifically created for running a continuous circular capsulotomy (CCC) in microincision cataract surgery, which is able to enter the eye through the same incision that uses such surgery and support itself, properly focused on the capsular surface of the lens so that with a slight pressure a perfect circular cut is carried out, most appropriately sized and with the required depth . As is known per se, phacoemulsification is one of the most modern techniques in the treatment of cataract, which is practiced worldwide, highlighted because it allows the removal of the opaque lens and replaces it with a transparent lens through a minimal incision (approximately 3 mm), which generally does not require suturing. It is emphasized that the continuous circular capsulotomy ( capsulorhexis ) as it is performed currently, it is one of the most difficult stages of the indicated process, because it requires a great skill by the intervening surgeon, who must make a circumferential cut of very small size, on living tissue, and has to execute it freehand. It is known that continuous circular capsulorhexis "CCC" properly centered and suitably sized is essential for a successful surgery. However, being an action freehand, even the best surgeon can fail. If a focused, consistent and correctly sized "CCC" is not achieved, the stability for lens aspiration is lost, so much that, in many cases it is not advisable to continue with the phacoemulsification, and the entry should be widened (through an incision of about 12 mm) , to proceed with an extra capsular extraction. With the use of the scalpel this invention relates to, the need for performing the rhexis freehand is eliminated and the circular shifts that produce the cut by tearing, being possible to execute a perfect circular cut without any circumferential displacement, through a slight pressure action on the capsular surface. Arguably, instead of continuous circular capsulorhexis (CCC) with the scalpel of this creation a very precisely controlled Continuous circular capsulotomy is carried out. For this, the circular scalpel of the present invention basically comprises a flexible hollow cylindrical body of circular section and open bases, which transversely crushed, can enter into the eye through the same channel of the incision approach, while it is expanded, it keeps some structural rigidity so that, resting on the capsular surface, it is possible to produce a well defined and most suitably sized circumferential cut through a manually controlled pressure perpendicular to said receiving surface . It is an invention that defines a new product designed for a superior result, the same is unpredictable and even surprising to one skilled in the art. Consequently, besides being new, the constructive and functional design shows a clear inventive step, gathering the conditions required by law for such invention to be considered patentable. PRIOR ART It can be said that cataract is a progressive disease which comprises a clouding or opacification of the lens (normally transparent) that prevents the efficient passage of light rays into the eye. It is frequently experienced by individuals over 50 years. The most common symptoms are: blurred vision, opaque color vision, and discomfort with the brightness of sunlight, poor night vision etc. and especially a clear decrease in vision, that in many cases it is not noticeable due to its slow and gradual nature. The only treatment for cataracts is surgery. A traditional technique exists, called "extra capsular", which involves opening the eye with an enlarged incision, lifting the cornea and extracting the cataract.' Then an intraocular lens is introduced, placing it appropriately in the capsular bag or groove ( irido-capsular ) when it is retained, or by stitches. With this advance, this technique tends to disappear due to having all the risks of open surgery (retinal detachment, choroidal detachment, expulsive hemorrhage) and a very slow visual recovery (it can take months to recover) and suboptimal because the sutures necessary for the closure of the incision, invariably generate astigmatism. For these reasons, there has been widespread a use of a more modern technique called "phacoemulsification" which allows removal of the entire lens through an incision of 3 mm. It involves the use of an ultrasound probe to mechanically split lens while being aspirated. Then, it is proceeded to implant an intraocular lens that replaces the lens. In most cases no suturing is required because they are very small and self sealing. Arguably, in the hands of a good surgeon, this procedure is extremely safe and it is highlighted by the following advantages: • It requires a small incision (3mm) so that the need for sutures that may cause astigmatism and feeling of "dirt" in the eye after surgery is eliminated. There are no sudden changes in pressure within the eye and the risks of bleeding are much lower. • It can be performed using local anesthesia, without injections and without the risks of general anesthesia. • The patient's recovery is immediate. They usually do not require hospitalization or bandages in the eye of the patient, who can return to normal activities immediately . • It keeps the eye structures and their resilience intact . It is known that with the arrival of Continuous Circular Capsulotomy (Capsulorhexis ) , described by the Canadian "Howard Gimbel" in the 80s, a resounding twist was given to "phacoemulsification" since an increased security was provided in its implementation and in centration of the intraocular lens. According to one of the known techniques, the incision is made using blades, a pincer ("utrata") is entered, through which the initial tear of the capsule (such as an eyelet) is produced. From this eyelet, the surgeon freehand leads the pincer in a circumferential offset action causing a 360° tear. A few drawbacks have emerged with this procedure, among them highlights the fact that a great individual skill of the surgeon is required to overcome certain really difficult steps which can occur during the performance. In fact, such problems require a steep learning curve for the inexperienced surgeon, particularly as regards the shaping of the cutting in a circle which has to be performed freehand. The surgeon must be well relaxed ant focused at the same time, taking a very comfortable position for his deft hand with his forearm aimed at the center of the eye that allows him to take lateral movements freely. It is also important to maintain a perfect visualization of the anterior capsule, which is given by the type of cataract previously selected (red reflex) and the one obtained by calibrating the microscope (optimal focus and coaxial light ) . It is also important to choose the most appropriate instruments for its performance, for example using pincers that allow maneuvers without causing unwanted corneal folds that may affect the vision of work. Experts suggest that the initial tearing of the capsule should be central and superficial so as not to remove the subcapsular crust which is confusing and makes it difficult to see the capsule. They point out that a good control of the tensile forces is also important, as well as the choice of site or point where the cut should be started. The constant possibility of losing control of the tear that is being made in the capsule, especially its continuity, can lead to many complications, sometimes even reaches to the failure of the surgery that is being performed. In contrast, continuous circular capsulorhexis "CCC", centered and most suitable sized, routes the surgery to a very good finish. In this sense it is reiterated that the biggest drawback is presented in that it has to be made freehand, so that even in the hands of the best surgeon it may fail. In case of failure to achieve a correct "CCC", stability for lens aspiration is lost, so that in many cases it is advisable not to continue the microinsicional technique, expand the entry and proceed to the manual removal of the lens . Once the lens is aspirated, the capsular bag will remain by way of a small cavity of the seat for the containment of the intraocular lens is implanted in replacement of the lens. This lens will be properly centered if the "CCC" was correctly done, otherwise, the surgical outcome is sub- optimal or even null. As part of the Prior Art, it can be mentioned that in order to implement said Continuous Circular Capsulorhexis a specific instrument has been disclosed, protected in USA by US patent 7,011,666, belonging to Mr. Matthew Feinsod, entitled "Incision apparatus for Cataract Surgery". Said document teaches an apparatus (100) designed to make a circumferential incision. In a preferred embodiment said apparatus is constituted of a carrier handle (110) which, by its distal end section retains a circular cutting ring (120) which carries a pair of diametrically opposite holes (122), practiced in the wall thereof, where it crosses said carrier handle that contains it. This circular cutting ring (120) can be deformed by stretching, taking a minimum thickness, to be driven through the incision approach, for which the same handle has two separate abutments (130a) and (130b) of slightly greater dimension than the diameter of said holes (122) . Once the ring is positioned on the capsular surface, moved by the carrier handle, the same buffers unlock it to resume its circular conformation and can be properly centered, with its sharp edge in contact with the tissue to be cut. Under the above conditions, it is possible to proceed with the Capsulorhexis driving the cutting ring to execute the circular motions that produce the tear propagation until the intended cutting at the required depth. However, it can be stated that the instrument disclosed by this invention patent US 7,011,666, presents serious functional problems, mainly because the carrier handle (110) diminishes mobility to said cutting ring positioned within the eye, which is extremely delicate because, to produce the cut, besides the pressure, a simultaneous circular motion must be performed, without which it is not possible to cause the controlled tear cutting of the tissue. Moreover, a minimum undesired displacement of the cutting ring of the carrier handle can cause serious drawbacks to its withdrawal by the entry incision. It is primarily emphasized that for the extraction a combined movement of the handle must be performed bearing the circular cutting ring, until they both move without trauma. It is not gratifying to know that the surgeon is working with an instrument inserted into the eye which cannot be extracted directly with one motion. There are cases where the patient, in the midst of surgery, may present a picture of anxiety and move suddenly and in a counterproductive manner; if he does it with the instrument partially retained within the eye and projected outward, the situation that arises is truly complicated. As discussed in the preceding paragraphs, it can be said that with the use of this instrument traditional technique Capsulorhexis (CCC) is improved. It is also important to note that the instrument of this prior disclosure, cannot produce the cut by pressure, if it is not combined with a circular motion. No matter how keen is its lower edge which contacts the capsular surface, it cannot pierce with a low or normal pressure because it is acting on an elastic fabric. By increasing the pressure, it increases the chance of uncontrolled and unwanted tears. In summary, it can be said that the main disadvantages of the cutting device disclosed in the mentioned US patent 7,011,666 are as follows: 1. Flat edge: Because of the characteristics of the lens capsule (elastic) if it is attacked with a flat edge (no points) to perform the cut, it must be pressed a lot, maybe more than 100 gr. The lens zonule withstands pressures of up to 25 g in the best case. Consequently, to perform the cutting, pressures would have to be performed which would loosen the position of the lens. This situation is utterly inconceivable in surgery. 2. Handle attached to the ring: This is inconvenient for several reasons : a. Enter into the eye an instrument that does not come easily, or representing a folding to exit in controversial is highly dangerous, especially when considering that the patient is awake during surgery, and he can move. A critical point is seen in the use of this device, noticeable when you are doing the capsulotomy, deployed with the ring attached to the handle. If at that time the patient moves, there is a ring inside the eye connected to a professional who is out (a situation not seen with any other instrument) this could be very dangerous. Another point is the mobility and maneuverability of the ring. A handle attached to the ring largely prevents its movement, which would be easily achievable if the control is independent of the ring. This ring moves from a fixed point. Another important aspect relates to the entry and exit of the assembly through the incision. It is emphasized that the instrument has an edge on the lower edge of the ring, so that when entering and exiting the incisional tunnel, the . crossing structures will be undoubtedly damaged. Another important drawback may arise in the unfortunate event that the connection between ring and handle breaks, during surgery, wherein an additional problem to solve appears as how the cutting ring is removed . The anterior chambers of' the eye have different depths, if a deep chamber is faced, how can the ring be positioned on the capsular surface? The angle between the plane and the instrument would make the incisional tunnel damage, or even worse, that there is no contact with the lens surface. DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION - ADVANTAGES The stated problem and the above-mentioned drawbacks are efficiently solved by resorting to the use of circular scalpel for capsulotomy of the present invention, which is designed for entry into the eye through an incision of 2 mm to 3 mm, such as those usually used in Cataract Surgery, and perform the "CCC" without doing it freehand. The invented scalpel can be removed with ease, after running the "CCC", through the same incision through which it was entered. With the invented scalpel the problems are solved because it eliminates the need for performing the "rhexis" freehand and also because, due to their constructive and constitutive conditions, it forms a perfect circular cutting on the capsular surface, both in the depth of it, as in the finished definition of the perimeter edge line that produces said cut. It is especially noted that for its use, the scalpel to which this invention relates to will create a new principle of operation since, to perform said perfect circular cutting it only scrolls by a slight pressure in the perpendicular direction and sense to the capsular surface on which it rests, which eliminates all types of circular motion . It also stands out because the cutting height is determined accurately and independently of the scalpel's own body, given its conformation it stops scrolling when it arrives to the necessary depth. To do this, the scalpel invented basically comprises a flexible, hollow and cylindrical body with a circular section and open bases, which, in a preferred embodiment, may show a sectional diameter between 5 mm and 6 mm, keeping a circular edge of serrated edge intended to rest on the capsular surface, while the opposite edge is defined as "blunt". Said flexible condition allows it to be crushed with pincers or the injector/extractor instrument driving it, until a minimum thickness is achieved, with their internal faces in mutual contact, in which case a width greater than 2 mm is established, a condition in which it can be led to enter the interior of the eye by the microinsicional tunnel, which is usually practiced in the cornea, whose dimensions are typically 2.2 mm to 3.2 mm as appropriate, without requiring the scalpel body to make contact with the walls of said tunnel. Under the conditions above, it is emphasized that invented scalpel can be entered using an injector-ejector, of conventional type, as usual for the "IOL Implant" (intraocular lens) which, for this application, will be duly amended to take the ring and submit and remove it in one operation. Once placed inside the eye, more precisely in the space that determines the anterior chamber defined between the lens and the cornea, when released from injector by the pincer, the instrument of this invention expands to recover its cylindrical structural format, with sharp cutting teeth resting on the capsular surface, in which case, driven by a suitable tool ("chopper" and/or "utrata"), it is positioned properly focused and aligned. Using the same pincers it is possible to perform the cutting, by a pressure action, which results in the formation of a perfect circle. Then with the same injector/ejector tool that entered it, through a single extraction displacement, it is possible to crush and extract it through the same tunnel of the incision which it entered. As noted above, once the invented instrument is properly positioned on the lens, just a slight pressure is enough to enter ½ mm, as with this is the capsule has certainly been cut . It is noteworthy that during the capsulotomy, the scalpel is only available and free to be pressed with said pincers ("chopper" and/or "utrata") so that if the patient moves suddenly and unexpectedly, there is no risk because it only keeps a small ring inside the eye, which, when calm recovers, may be removed without problems or consequences. As is known, the thickness of the capsule is approximately 25 microns, so that in preferred embodiments the height of the cylindrical wall of the invented scalpel may be 0.75 mm, in which case its sharp cutting teeth are of 0.25 mm, enough to ensure that with said slight manual pressure a complete circle is obtained, homogeneous on the whole 360°, without any need for a circular displacement. In preferred embodiments, the aforementioned cutting nails are flat and tapered, which may include one sharp edge or two sharp edges for easy cutting action to be executed. Thus, it is possible to overcome the resistance of the capsular surface more easily. In this regard, the invention contemplates that these cutting teeth adopt various shapes, defining curved edges converging towards the same point of free end or by combining a curved and sharp edge and another straight one, or even edges which form different angular values with each other. As the constituent material, it is a constructive condition that while presenting some structural rigidity, it keeps the referred flexible condition, in which case it is possible to manufacture it with polypropylene, or grillon, with a proper density, it should even considered the possibility of using an alloy of nickel and titanium (NiTi) . As mentioned above, the inventive scalpel can be entered using a similar injector/extractor which applies to the "IOL implant". For this, the injector must include a special carrier cartridge, through which it is possible for the scalpel body to be provided properly crushed forming a minimum thickness, with its cutting teeth facing downwards, and in these conditions be moved until dispose it over capsular surface, in which case, while the injector is removed, it returns to its cylindrical shape, with its serrated section supported on said surface, while maintaining a minimum structural rigidity to prevent deformation when pressed perpendicularly by the upper blunt edge. In this sense, it should be noted that the nozzle of the carrier cartridge which will contact incisional tunnel wall, keeping the scalpel cultured and crushed over the scalpel which looks and expands only when it is arranged facing the capsular surface. INVENTIVE STEP No instrument or surgical tool which is known today proposes or even suggests the constructive and functional solution which emerges as indicated in the preceding paragraphs, which is the reason why it is a proposal that, in addition to novel, it has a clear inventive step. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES To realize the advantages so briefly discussed, to which the users and those skilled in the art may add many others, and to facilitate the understanding of the constructive, constitutive and functional characteristics of the invented scalpel, a preferred example of an embodiment is described below, in which it is schematically illustrated without a certain level in the attached sheets, with the express clarification that, precisely because it is an example, not for assigning to it a limited or exclusive nature of the protective scope of the present patent, but merely assists for explanation and illustrative intent of the basic concept on which it is based. Figure 1 is a perspective view in elevation showing the overall conformation that presents the circular scalpel for capsulotomy of the present patent invention. Figure 2 is a side view of the same scalpel shown in the previous figure, where the cutting teeth are triangular in shape, whose equal sides converging to the open vertex, form the cutting edges. Figure 3 is a side view of the same scalpel shown in the previous figures, in this case where the cutting teeth have edges of different lengths. Figure 4 is a schematic side view similar to the previous figures, depicting the case where the edges of each cutting tooth are curved. Figure 5 is a cross-sectional view of the same scalpel shown in figure 1, including an enlarged detail which highlights how the cutting edge presented by each sharp tooth is composed. Figure 6 is a perspective view depicting the carrier cartridge of the injector/extractor especially designed to hold the scalpel, shown in the arrangement that adopts for receiving the same. Figure 7 is a perspective view showing the carrier cartridge of the injector/extractor able to enter through the incisional micro channel. Figure 8 depicts a portion of the human eye, duly enlarged showing the entry of the invented scalpel hovering crushed from the in ector/extractor. Figure 9 represents the same section of the preceding figure, in this case showing the scalpel properly positioned on the capsular surface of the lens. Figure 10 shows the same section of the preceding figure, showing in this case the invented instrument as it is positioned when the circumferential cut is produced by penetrating the capsular surface. Figure 11 shows the same cutting of the preceding figure showing the presence of the intraocular lens disposed on the capsular bag of the lens once the torn portion has been extracted by suction. It is clarified that in all the figures, in like numbers and reference letters, correspond to the same or equivalent parts or constitutive elements of the set, according to the example chosen for the present explanation of the invented scalpel. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EXAMPLE As can be seen in figure 1, the circular scalpel for anterior capsulotomy of the lens referred to in the present invention comprises a hollow cylindrical body (1) of open bases, defining a blunt upper edge (2) and a lower serrated edge (3) . The invented scalpel is known for being flexible and of variable height, defining a cylindrical wall whose lower edge portion comprises a circumferential alignment of cutting teeth (4) also flat and of sharp shape, whose height may be slightly less than half the total height of the scalpel. In this regard it is clarified that it will be enough to constitute a cylindrical body with open bases and uniform height, with a blunt edge and one serrated, in the most appropriate sizes, so as to fully satisfy its intended use. Under the conditions described, observing the graph of figure 5, we can say that, in preferred embodiments, the total height of the wall of the scalpel may be between 0.75 mm and 1 mm, in which case the height of each cutting tooth (4) will be between 0.25 mm and 0.40 mm, in which case the diameter of the circular section thereof may be 4 mm and about 7 mm. It is understood that the present invention defines as basic and main condition that the lower cutting edge (3) having the scalpel is serrated, but is not subject to the conformation and orientation that can present each of those cutting teeth (4) that give shape to said serrated edge. In this regard, figures 2 to 4 show different options for the cutting teeth, each of which have been specifically designed to produce the cut on the capsular surface of the lens, from a slight perpendicular pressure. In the case shown in figure 2, the teeth (4) are triangular, where the sides converging toward the free vertex are equal to each other. In the case shown in figure 3, the teeth (4') are also triangular but the sides converging to the free corner are uneven, which can result, when said perpendicular pressure to the support surface is carried out, the scalpel tends to make a small circular movement which favors the penetration of the tissue without tearing. Also, figure 4 shows the case where the cutting teeth (4") are curved sides. Observing now figures 6 and 7 a preferred embodiment for the entry and exit of the scalpel of this invention into the eye is exemplified, which comprises arranging the same in a carrier cartridge (C) specially designed for this purpose . Said cartridge (C) comprises a receiving cavity which is defined between the hinged flaps (25) and (26), which enclose a longitudinal central channel (24). Precisely, said longitudinal central channel (24) allows that said flaps can be arranged depressed or open for incorporating the scalpel. In this specific example, the scalpel (1) can be positioned between the longitudinal straight ribs (27) and (28), so that, when the flaps are closed, as shown in figure 7, the body of the scalpel crushes until its side wall remains overlies, giving shape to a more elongated and flattened body which is accommodated with some fairness in said longitudinal channel (24). In both figures 6 and 7 it is seen that said channel (24) is in communication with the dispensing nozzle (29) , specially designed to pass through the tunnel incisional and dispose its distal end facing the capsular surface of the lens (see figure 8) . It is noteworthy that the outer surface of the nozzle can be curved and flat, since it makes contact with the walls of the incisional tunnel, however it is desirable that the inner channel keeps the quadrangular section conformation and thereby ensure that the scalpel is maintained properly positioned during its transportation of entry and exit into the eye. Observing now figure 7, it shows that the referred carrier cartridge (C) , is suitable for engaging the distal end of the actuating syringe (J) that integrates the extractor designed for the application. In the above manner, through the plunger (23) of the syringe (J), the entry and exit movement of the scalpel (1) occurs. To this end, its distal end includes a special hooking tooth (30) whose function is to take the inside cylindrical wall of the scalpel to push it forward into the eye or move it, backward, pulling toward the nozzle (29) so as to flatten it and move it outward. Looking now at figures 8 to 11, it is possible to understand what the purpose of use is and how the tool works as regards this creation. In these figures it is schematically represented a portion of the human eye which allows to appreciate how the continuous circular capsulotomy ("CCC") is performed during a cataract surgery by phacoemulsification. In said figures the following parts that make up the composition of the eye are shown schematically: 6 = Cornea 7 = Aqueous Humor 8 = Pupil 9 = Iris 10 = Capsule 11 = Trabecular Meshwork 12 = Schlemm' s Canal 13 = Irido-Sclero-Corneal Angle 14 = Ciliary Body 15 = Lens 16 = Sclera Looking now to figure 8, it is seen that for cataract surgery by phacoemulsification it is proceeded with a micro corneal incision (17) which does not require sutures, through which slender instruments are introduced which act on the cataract, removed by absorption and then an intraocular lens (19) (shown schematically in figure 11) is implanted that is foldable to pass through said insicional channel (17) which then expands to stay in perfect shape over the lens, taking the place of the extracted capsular surface portion. As is known per se, in the eye, the lens (15) is enclosed and covered by a capsule (10) highly refractile to the electron microscope, which is seen as thick and homogeneous (11 to 18 microns thick) . The internal surface of the capsule is maintained in direct contact with the base of the epithelial cells. In figures 8, 9 and 10 it is shown that the invented scalpel (1) is also designed to enter into the eye, more precisely into the anterior chamber of the eye between the lens (15) and cornea (6), passing through the aforementioned micro corneal incision (17), for which is disposed properly crushed inside the channel of the dispensing nozzle (29) of the carrier cartridge (C) which integrates the extracting medium injector. As depicted in figure 9 as the scalpel is moved out of the dispensing nozzle (29) , it is disposed directly on the anterior capsular surface (10) which, once released, it tends to expand to adopt the cylindrical form shown in the figures, with cutting teeth supported on said surface. It is clarified that the expansion of the invented instrument (1), can also be completed using specific tools "utrata" (20) and the auxiliary "chopper" (21) that enters the micro insicional corneal channel (22), through which it is also properly positioned on the capsular surface (10) . Looking now at figures 9 and 10 it is possible to understand that through the "chopper" (21) which rests on the blunt edge (2) of the instrument (1), it is possible to apply pressure to the lens from its higher segment (4) and move pressing on said upper open base to ensure that the penetration achieved is sufficient to ensure the circular cutting of the entire capsular surface enclosed. Finally figure 11 shows that the forming invented device was removed as well as the torn capsular portion, in which case, there having been a perfect capsulorhexis , as taught by the aforementioned method phacoemulsification proceeds to incorporate the lens (19) . 1.- CIRCULAR SCALPEL FOR ANTERIOR CAPSULOTOMY OF THE LENS IN CATARACT SURGERY, for running said continuous circular capsulotomy (CCC) in microincision cataract surgery, known as "phacoemulsification" which is able to enter the eye through the same microincision that uses said surgery and position itself, properly focused, on the lens capsular surface, so that, with a slight pressure in perpendicular direction and sense to the capsular surface, it carries out the capsulotomy defining a perfect circular cut, well defined and with a suitable size, characterized in that it comprises a hollow cylindrical body (1), essentially flexible, of circular cross section and open bases, whose upper edge (2) is blunt and its lower edge (3) is serrated, formed with sharp cutting teeth (4);
