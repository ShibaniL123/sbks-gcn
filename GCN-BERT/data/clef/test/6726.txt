Preparation of (1S,3R)-1-(5-bromopyridin-2-yl)-2-((1-fluorocyclopropyl)methyl)-3,5-dimethyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-6-amine
5-Bromopicolinaldehyde (507 mg, 2.72 mmol) was added to a stirred solution of (R)-3-(2-(((1-fluorocyclopropyl)methyl)amino)propyl)-2-methylaniline (322 mg, 1.36 mmol) in acetic acid (7028 μL) and water (143 μL). The resulting mixture was heated to 90° C. and stirred at this temperature for 5 hours. The mixture was concentrated and dissolved in EtOAC (50 mL) and saturated NaHCO3 (25 mL). The aqueous layer was extracted with EtOAc (2×50 mL). The combined organics were concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was dissolved in DCM (20 mL) and 1M HCl (20 mL). The mixture was stirred vigorously for 30 minutes. The layers were separated and the the aqueous layer was washed with DCM (20 mL). The aqueous layer was basified to pH 10 with solid NaOH. The solution was extracted with DCM (3×25 mL). The combined organics were dried (phase separator cartridge) and concentrated to give the crude product. The crude product was purified by flash silica chromatography, elution gradient 0 to 60% EtOAc in heptane. Pure fractions were evaporated to dryness to afford (1S,3R)-1-(5-bromopyridin-2-yl)-2-((1-fluorocyclopropyl)methyl)-3,5-dimethyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-6-amine (217 mg, 39%) as a yellow gum.
