Example 7: Synthesis of compound 11110, N-(4-(5-(difluoromethyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl)-2-fluorobenzyl)-N-phenylisonicotinamide
[Step 1] Synthesis of N-(4-(2-(2,2-difluoroacetyl)hydrazine-1-carbonyl)-2-fluorobenzyl)-N-phenylisonicotinamide
N-(2-fluoro-4-(hydrazinecarbonyl)benzyl)-N-phenylisonicotinamide (0.100 g, 0.274 mmol), synthesized in step 2 of Example 6, and triethylamine (0.076 mL, 0.549 mmol), were dissolved in methylene chloride (10 mL) at room temperature, and 2,2-difluoroacetic anhydride (0.057 g, 0.329 mmol) was added to the solution, followed by stirring at the same temperature for 1 hour. Water was added to the reaction mixture, followed by extraction with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed with saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution, dried with magnesium sulfate anhydrous, filtered, and then concentrated under reduced pressure. The title compound was used without further purification (0.120 g, 98.8%, colorless oil).
