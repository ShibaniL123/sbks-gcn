The entire teachings of the above applications are incorporated herein by reference. BACKGROUND Cancer genomics is revealing comprehensively somatic mutations that may constitute the root cause of disease. These findings suggest novel mechanisms for cancer initiation and progression, and new ways we might treat cancer in the future. Recently, a genome-wide sequencing study identified mutations in the metabolic enzyme IDH1 in samples from patients with glioblastoma multiformes, which are among the most lethal cancers with survival of only months after their diagnosis. (Parsons D. W. et al., Science 321, 1807-1812, 2008). Subsequent analyses revealed that mutations in IDH1 are common (70%-80%) in grade II, III gliomas and secondary glioblastomas and that patients lacking IDH1 mutations often harbor mutations in IDH2, which shares 70% identity with IDH1. (Yan H. et al., N Engl J Med 360, 765-773, 2009; Bleeker F. E. et al., Hum Mutat 30, 7-11, 2009; Balss J. et al., Acta Neuropathol 116, 597-602, 2008). More recently, IDH1/2 mutations have been observed in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and rare cases have been reported in other cancers. (Ward P. S. et al., Cancer Cell 17, 225-234, 2010; Exp. Med. 207, 339-344, 2010; Mardis E. R. et al., N Engl J Med 361, 1058-1066, 2009). Notably, all mutations in IDH1/2 are heterozygous and the majority of them affect a particular codon (R132 in IDH1 and the analogous codon, R172, in IDH2) suggesting the gene may contribute to carcinogenesis as an oncogene rather than a tumor suppressor through a gain of function. IDH1/2 are NADP+-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenases that normally mediate oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) via the conversion of NADP+ to NADPH. Mutations in IDH1/2 appear to have two functional consequences for the enzymes' activities: i) a decreased ability to convert isocitrate to α-KG; and ii) a new ability to reduce α-KG to (R)-2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) using NADPH (Ward et al., supra; Dang, L. et al., Nature 462, 739-744, 2009). Indeed 2-HG levels are elevated >50-fold in samples from patients with IDH1/2-mutations. This observation has motivated study of 2-HG as a disease biomarker, as well as deeper study into the molecular mechanism by which this putative ‘oncometabolite’ might contribute to disease. Indeed, 2-HG could interfere with a wide range of processes, such as those regulated by α-KG-dependent, iron-dependent dioxygenases; these processes include the response to hypoxic stress (mediated by EglN prolyl hydroxylases), DNA modification (mediated by TET2, a 5-methylcytosine hydroxylase), and histone methylation (mediated by JmjC-containing demethylases), among others (Figueroa M. E. et al., Cancer Cell, 18, 553-567, 2010; Christensen, B. C. et al., J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 103, 2, 143-53, 2011; Zhao, S. et al., Science, 324, 261-265, 2009; Xu, W. et al., Cancer Cell, 19, 17-30, 2011). Thus, the development of small molecules that inhibit the 2-HG-generating activity of IDH1/2 mutants in cells is important in cancer cell biology and drug development. Point mutations IDH1 and IDH2 occur early in the pathogenesis of gliomas. Reitman reports that the study of 200 metabolites in human oligodendroglioma (HOG) cells to determine the effects of expression of IDH1 and IDH2 mutants showed that the levels of amino acids, glutathione metabolites, choline derivatives, and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates were altered in mutant IDH1- and IDH2-expressing cells. (Reitman Z. J. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2011, 108(8) 3270-3275). Furthermore, N-acetyl-aspartyl-glutamate (NAAG), a common dipeptide in brain, was 50-fold reduced in cells expressing IDH1 mutants and 8.3-fold reduced in cells expressing IDH2 mutants. Hartmann et al., (US 20100291590) discloses a method for the diagnosis of a brain tumor using the presence/absence of a particular IDH1 mutation as a marker. Vogelstein et al. (WO 2010/028099) discloses that mutations in IDH1 and IDH2 are related to astrocytomas, oligodendrogliomas and glioblastomas. Dang et al., (WO 2010/105243) discloses methods for the treatment of isocitrate dehydrogenase related proliferative disorders. Glioblastoma is the most frequent and most malignant human brain tumor. The prognosis remains very poor, with most patients dying within 1 year after diagnosis. (Ohgaki et al. American Journal of Pathology, 170(5), 2007, 1445-1453). There exists a need to develop effective treatments against proliferative disorders including glioblastoma and acute myeloid leukemia. Thus, there exists a need to focus on developing compounds that inhibit mutated IDH1/2 with selectivity over wild-type IDH1/2 with the goal of targeting cancer cells selectively over normal cell. That said, there is also a need for advancing compounds that target both mutant and wild-type IDH1/2 since cancer cells which harbor mutant IDH alleles are dependent on the wild-type allele for proliferation, suggesting inhibition of wild-type IDH may also prove valuable for treating cancer (Ward P. S. et al., Cancer Cell 17, 225-234, 2010).

The Lanterns were then dried on a lyophilizer overnight and carried on to the next step. Fmoc Removal: To a flask containing Lanterns was added a solution of 20% piperidine in DMF (0.8 mL/Lantern). After shaking at rt for 30 min, the piperidine solution was removed and the Lanterns were washed with the following solvents for 30 min intervals: DMF, 3:1 THF/H2O, 3:1 THF/IPA, THF, DCM. QC analysis of an aliquot cleaved from the lantern shows no remaining starting material. The Lanterns were then dried on a lyophilizer overnight and carried on to the next step. N-Capping/Aldehydes: To a flask containing Lanterns was added DMF with 2% AcOH (0.800 mL/Lantern) followed by 4-pyridinecarboxaldehyde (20 equiv). The reaction mixture was shaken at rt for 1 hr then sodium triacetoxyborohydride (20 equiv) was added and shaking was continued. After 3 days the reaction mixture was removed and the Lanterns were washed with the following solvents for 30 min intervals: DMF, 3:1 THF/H2O, 3:1 THF/IPA, THF, DCM. QC analysis of an aliquot cleaved from the lantern shows no remaining starting material. The Lanterns were then dried on a lyophilizer overnight and carried on to the next step. Cross-Coupling/Suzuki: To each flask containing Lanterns was added ethanol (0.800 mL/Lantern) followed by phenylboronic acid (20 equiv), triethylamine (40 equiv) and Pd(PPh3)2Cl2 (1 equiv). The resulting mixture was degassed with a stream of N2 before shaking at 60° C. After 4 days, the reaction mixture was removed and the Lanterns were washed with following solvents for 30 min intervals: DCM, DMF, NaCN solution (0.1M) in 1:1 THF/H2O, DMF, 3:1 THF/H2O, 3:1 THF/IPA, THF, DCM. QC analysis of an aliquot cleaved from the lantern shows no remaining starting material. Cleavage Protocol: To a 96-well plate containing Lanterns was added a 15% solution of HF/pyridine in stabilized THF (350 μL/Lantern). After 2 h the cleavage solution was quenched with TMSOMe (700 μL/Lantern) and the contents of each well were transferred to a pre-weighed 2-mL vial. The Lanterns were washed with an additional 200 μL of stabilized THF (or THF/MeOH) and the solution was transferred to the 2-mL vial. The samples were concentrated on a GENEVAC® solvent evaporation system overnight without heating to afford the title compound (4R,5R)-2-((S)-1-hydroxypropan-2-yl)-4-methyl-5-((methyl(pyridin-3-ylmethyl)amino)methyl)-8-phenyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydrobenzo[b][1,4,5]oxathiazocine 1,1-dioxide (3.1 mg, 31% yield). LCMS RT 0.78 min, observed [M+1]+ 495.22, calculated [M+1]+ 495.22). Loading masses for each alcohol was determined on a FLEXIWEIGH® system.

C-terminally His8-tagged IDH1-R132H protein was expressed in the E. coli Rosetta strain and purified by metal chelate affinity chromatography. The ability of IDH1-R132H to convert α-KG to 2-HG using NADPH is assayed by measuring consumption of NADPH in a diaphorase-coupled assay. Resazurin is a dark blue reagent that has little intrinsic fluorescence. In the presence of NADPH, Resazurin is reduced by diaphorase to resorufin, which is highly fluorescent with an excitation peak at 579 nm and an emission peak at 584 nm (FIGS. 1A-G). To validate the above assay, a set of compounds was screened in a multi-well format in duplicate. The average signal-to-background ratio was about 10; the Z′ factor ranged from 0.7 to 0.85 and CV was <8% for each of the four plates. The scale-up was facile and robust, with an average Z′ of about 0.74 for 101 plates, and yielding over hundred hits with >=30% inhibition in both replicates. A more stringent cutoff of >=40% inhibition in both replicates, corresponding to >4 times the sum of the standard deviations of the negative and positive controls, yielded a smaller set. To identify assay artifacts, such as compounds that activate diaphorase directly, another assay was developed as an alternative method to measure the activity of IDH1-R132H based on absorbance at 340 nm by NADPH (FIG. 2A-B). The assay solution contained 100 mM Tris.HCl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MnCl2, 0.03% BSA, 20 uM NADPH, 0.4 mM α-Ketoglutarate and 87 nM of recombinant IDH1-R132H. Absorbance is measured on a SpectraMax spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices) in kinetic mode. Compound Selectivity Test: To define their selectivity, confirmed inhibitors of IDH1-R132H were tested in dose for their ability to inhibit: (i) wild-type IDH1, (ii) another α-Ketoglutarate-dependent enzyme, the histone demethylase GASC1, and, (iii) another NADP+-dependent dehydrogenase, G6PDH. Selectivity over the following criteria was studied: (i) wild-type IDH1. The ability of the compound to inhibit IDH1-R132H compared to wild-type IDH1. (ii, iii) Selectivity over GASC1 and G6PDH. Ideal compounds should not inhibit either GASC1 or G6PDH (IC50 difference >20-fold). Step Description of assay conditions: 1.

J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2010, 132, 16962-16976). The remaining reagents for the following reaction are commercially available. To an oven-dried round-bottom flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer was added a (945 mg, 2.61 mmol, 1.0 equiv) and 10 mL dichloromethane. PyBOP (1.50 g, 2.88 mmol, 1.1 equiv) and diisopropyl ethylamine (1.01 g, 7.84 mmol, 3.0 equiv) were added. The resulting mixture was cooled in an ice bath before isopropylamine (185 mg, 3.14 mmol, 1.2 equiv) was added as a solution in dichloromethane (3 mL) dropwise over 20 minutes. The mixture was stirred for three days at room temperature. The reaction was quenched with water and extracted with dichloromethane. The combined organic extracts were dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated to yield a white solid. The soluble portions of the mixture were taken up in diethyl ether and the insoluble phosphoramide byproducts were removed via filtration. The solvent was removed in vacuo and the crude product was isolated. Flash chromatography on silica gel (0-50% Ethyl acetate in hexanes) gave the product (540 mg, 51%). Step 2: Synthesis of c To an oven-dried 2-necked round-bottom flask equipped with a magnetic stirbar and condenser was added b (530 mg, 1.32 mmol, 1 equiv) in 15 mL tetrahydrofuran (final concentration 0.05 M). Borane-dimethylsulfide complex (500 mg, 5.68 mmol, 5.0 equiv) was added dropwise via syringe and the reaction was heated at 65° C. for 5 hr. The flask was placed on an ice bath and excess hydride was quenched by addition of methanol until bubbling stopped. The mixture was concentrated to an oil and evaporated three times with methanol to remove excess B(OMe)3. The oil was redissolved in a mixture of aqueous sodium potassium tartrate (10 mL, 0.5 M) and methanol (10 mL) and the resulting slurry was heated at reflux (85° C.) for 12 hours to disrupt the boron-nitrogen complex. Volatiles were removed under reduced pressure and the resulting aqueous mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate. The combined organic extracts were washed once with brine, dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated to provide the desired amine c as a colorless oil in quantitative crude yield (527.6 mg). The material was taken on without purification. Step 3: Synthesis of d To a flame-dried round-bottom flask equipped with stirbar and purged with nitrogen was added c (427 mg, 1.10 mmol, 1.0 equiv) in dichloromethane (final volume 15 mL, concentration 0.04 M). The solution cooled in an ice bath and triethylamine (556 mg, 5.49 mmol, 5.0 equiv) and 2-fluoro-5-nitrophenylacetic acid chloride (598 mg, 2.75 mmol, 2.5 equiv) (prepared as described in Marcuarelle et. al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2010, 132, 16962-16976) were added via syringe. The reaction mixture took on a dark red-orange color. The vessel was warmed to room temperature and allowed to stir overnight. The reaction was quenched with water and extracted with dichloromethane. The combined organic extracts were dried over magnesium sulfate and concentrated to yield the crude product. The material was purified by flash chromatography on silica gel (0-50% EtOAc in hexanes) to give the product d (526 mg, 84%). Step 4: Synthesis of e To a flame-dried 50 mL flask that had been purged with nitrogen was added ammonium fluoride (171 mg, 4.61 mmol, 5.0 equiv) followed by d (526 mg, 0.922 mmol, 1.0 equiv) in tetrahydrofuran (14 mL, final concentration 0.07 M) and tetrabutylammonium fluoride (1.21 g, 4.61 mmol, 5.0 equiv). The mixture was stirred at room temperature overnight. The reaction was quenched with saturated aqueous ammonium chloride. The organic and aqueous layers were separated and the aqueous layer was extracted with ethyl acetate. The combined organic layers were washed with acetic acid solution (1.0 M in water) and brine and dried over magnesium sulfate. The mixture was filtered and the filtrate was concentrated. Flash chromatography on silica gel (20-60% EtOAc in hexanes) yielded the deprotected alcohol (215 mg). This intermediate was dissolved in THF (15 mL, final concentration 0.03 M) and placed in a flame-dried round-bottom flask with stirbar that had been purged with nitrogen. Sodium hydride (94 mg, 2.36 mmol, 5.0 equiv) was added in one portion and the resulting mixture was allowed to stir overnight at room temperature. The reaction was quenched with not-quite-saturated aqueous ammonium chloride solution. The organic and aqueous layers were separated and the aqueous layer was extracted with ethyl acetate. The combined organic extracts were dried over magnesium sulfate and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated to yield the crude product. Flash chromatography on silica gel (50-70% EtOAc in hexanes) afforded the product as a white crystalline solid (122 mg, 30%). 1H NMR (300 MHz, CDCl3, 22° C.) δ 8.18 (d, J=3 Hz, 1H), 8.06 (dd, J=3, 9 Hz, 1H), 7.09 (d, J=9 Hz, 1H), 4.56 (m, 1H), 4.13 (m, 1H), 3.64 (m, 2H), 3.47 (m, 3H), 2.92 (s, 3H), 2.17 (m, 1H), 1.70 (m, 1H), 1.40 (s, 9H), 1.22 (m, 6H), 0.98 (d, J=7 Hz, 3H). 13C NMR (300 MHz, CDCl3, 22° C.) δ 162.8, 144.0, 131.4, 127.7, 123.9, 123.2, 80.2, 52.3, 51.5, 37.4, 36.2, 28.3, 21.2, 19.8, 15.8. Step 5: Synthesis of f To a flame-dried flask equipped with a stirbar was added 10% palladium on carbon (28.2 mg, 26 μmol, 0.1 equiv), followed by purging of the flask with nitrogen. e (115 mg, 256 μmol, 1.0 equiv) was added as a solution in ethanol (11 mL, final concentration 0.025 M). The mixture was heated to 35° C. and a hydrogen atmosphere was applied via balloon. The reaction was allowed to progress for two hours, after which the mixture was removed from heat and filtered through Celite and the solvent was removed in vacuo to afford the crude product (95 mg, crude yield 88%). The material was taken on crude. Step 6: Synthesis of g To a flame-dried 5 mL flask with stirbar that had been purged with nitrogen was added f (9.2 mg, 23 μmol, 1.0 equiv) and 500 μL dichloromethane. Cyclohexyl isocyanate (12.8 mg, 102 μmol, 4.5 equiv) was added and the mixture was stirred for four days. Extra dichloromethane was periodically added to replace that which evaporated over the course of the reaction. The reaction was quenched with water and extracted with methylene chloride. The combined organic extracts were dried over sodium sulfate; the solution was decanted and concentrated in vacuo to afford crude product. Flash chromatography on silica gel (0-10% MeOH in dichloromethane) provided the product (10.4 mg, 86%). Step 7: Synthesis of h To a small vial equipped with a stirbar was added g (10.4 mg, 20 μmol, 1.0 equiv) in dichloromethane (600 μL, 0.02 M). Trifluoroacetic acid (444 mg, 3.89 mmol, 200 equiv) was added and the mixture was stirred for 30 minutes. The mixture was then concentrated in vacuo and mixed with saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate. The resulting aqueous mixture was extracted with dichloromethane; the combined organic extracts were dried over sodium sulfate. The solution was decanted and the solvent was removed by evaporation under a stream of dry nitrogen. The material was taken on crude. Step 8: Synthesis of Example-52 To a vial equipped with a stirbar was added 9 (9.6 mg, 22 μmol, 1.0 equiv) dissolved in 2% acetic acid in dimethylformamide (612 μL, 0.036 M). Isonicotinaldehyde (5.7 mg, 53 μmol, 2.4 equiv) was added via syringe and the reaction was allowed to proceed for 90 minutes. Sodium triacetoxyborohydride (9.0 mg, 42 μmol, 1.9 equiv) was added and the mixture was stirred for two days. The solvent was removed in vacuo at 50° C. and the residue was taken up in saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution. The aqueous mixture was extracted with dichloromethane; the combined organic extracts were dried over sodium sulfate. The solution was decanted and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was purified by high-pressure liquid chromatography to yield the product (4.9 mg, 42%). 1H NMR (300 MHz, CDCl3, 22° C.) δ 7.43 (m, 2H), 7.04 (m, 2H), 6.94 (m, 1H), 5.45 (m, 1H), 4.78 (m, 1H), 4.17 (m, 1H), 3.75 (m, 1H), 3.51 (m, 2H), 3.34 (m, 1H), 3.11 (m, 1H), 2.79 (m, 1H), 2.59 (m, 1H), 2.41 (m, 1H), 2.22 (s, 3H), 1.88 (m, 5H), 1.56 (m, 6H), 1.23 (m, 6H), 0.94 (m, 3H).
