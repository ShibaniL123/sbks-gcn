Step 9: preparation of [5-(3-aminopropyl)-4,9-dioxo-3-thia-5,8,10-triaza-tricyclo[6.2.1.02,6]undec-2(6)-en-10-yl] hydrogen sulfate (Example 10)
TFA (510 µL) was added dropwise to a solution of sodium [5-(3-(tert-butoxycarbonylamino)propyl)-4,9-dioxo-3-thia-5,8,10-triaza-tricyclo[6.2.1.02,6]undec-2(6)-en-10-yl] sulfate (10h) (105 mg, 0.222 mmol) in DCM (1 mL) at 0°C. The mixture was stirred for 15 min at this temperature then concentrated under nitrogen flux. ACN was added to the compound, and after sonication, the precipitate was filtered, and washed twice with ACN to provide [5-(3-aminopropyl)-4,9-dioxo-3-thia-5,8,10-triaza-tricyclo[6.2.1.02,6]undec-2(6)-en-10-yl] hydrogen sulfate (Example 10) (56 mg, 0.159 mmol, 72%) as a beige solid.
