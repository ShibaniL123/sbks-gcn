FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a cleansing composition. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Regarding a skin cleansing agent such as a facial wash and a body soap, various studies have been conventionally made to obtain good foamability, a high cleansing effect, or moist feel after rinsing. In particular, the skin cleansing agent such as body soap is expected to have high foam volume and foam quality with fine texture during a cleansing process. For such reasons, developed is a skin cleansing agent having high lathering property during cleansing process by combining surfactants with high foamability or a cleansing agent having increased foam volume by combination with a commonly used cationic polymer and a non-ionic polymer for increasing liquid viscosity so that the created foam hardly disappear. For example, Patent documents 1 and 2 disclose a cleansing composition containing an anionic surfactant and glyceryl ether having an alkyl group with from 4 to 12 carbon atoms. In addition, Patent document 3 discloses and studies a skin cleansing composition in which a detergent surfactant is combined with cationized cellulose. Meanwhile, in recent days, with commonly occurring hair damages due to wide use of a coloring agent or a perming agent, it is important to provide a hair cleansing agent with an activity of providing a conditioning effect in addition to basic activities such as lathering and detergency. Generally, in order to impart smoothness to the hair, combined use of an anionic surfactant and silicones (Patent Document 4) or combined use of an anionic surfactant and cationized cellulose is carried out.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION A conventionally used skin cleansing composition has a problem that, although it has improved foamability, creamy foam is not provided. There is also a problem that, while having improved foamability, foams hardly disappear during rinsing process so that foams are easily remained in a drain. There is also a problem that, as slimy feel stays during rinsing process, it requires a large amount of water to have frictional feel like a fresh feeling expected from use of a soap. In addition, according to the technique of cleansing hair described above, although smoothness is imparted to the hair, it is required to improve lathering, ease of movement of finger during bubbling, foam dissipation property, and residual feel during rinsing. For hair damaged by a chemical treatment or a heating treatment, in particular, when the movement of finger is not satisfactorily easy during bubbling, hands or fingers may be stuck between hairs during hair washing, thereby causing hair damage. In addition, although smoothness is given, there are cases in which foam dissipation property is poor so that residual feel remains during rinsing and slimy feel remains. The present invention relates to a cleansing composition. The present invention relates to a skin cleansing agent which has an excellent lathering property and high cleansing feel during use, can be easily washed off without slimy feel and has feel with frictional resistance (that is, stop feeling) during rinsing, and also has a property of hardly staying foams in a drain as the foam disappearance is quick. The present invention relates to an aqueous hair cleansing agent which is excellent in lathering and foam quality so as to allow ease of movement of hand and finger during bubbling even in damaged hair, and has an excellent foam dissipation property during washing hair and suppressed residual feel during rinsing. The present inventors found that, by combining a specific cationic polymer in addition to an anionic surfactant with specific glyceryl ether, a cleansing composition having not only an excellent foamability but also fast foam dissipation property can be obtained. The cleansing composition of the present invention is characterized in that lathering is excellent during washing while foam dissipation property is fast during rinsing. In case of a skin cleansing agent, it produces a large volume of foam during washing, foam quality is creamy and wash feel is excellent while it is easily washed off during rinsing, foam dissipation is fast, and foam hardly remains. In addition, it has suppressed residual feel during rinsing, it is possible to provide the skin immediately after towel drying after washing with the feel like the hands adsorbing onto the skin. In case of a hair cleansing agent, it is excellent in lathering and foam quality, even in damaged hair, ease of movement of hand and finger during washing, and foam dissipation property is excellent during washing hair, and residual feel is suppressed during rinsing.

In the aqueous hair cleansing agent, by using the component (A) to (C) in combination, sufficient foam volume allowing ease of movement of hands and fingers even in damaged hair and light foam quality are obtained, and also foam dissipation is favorable, thus the residual feel during rinsing is suppressed. Although the reason is not exactly clear, it is believed that, by the coacervation of the component (A) and the component (C) during rinsing, complexes are precipitated on hair surface so that the component (C) can remain even after rinsing. It is also believed that, as the component (C), the component (A), and the component (B) present on hair surface make a suitable foam quality for hair washing, good lathering property, ease of movement of hands or fingers even when applied to damaged hair, and an effect of suppressing residual feel during rinsing are obtained. The cleansing composition of the present invention can be applied as a skin cleansing agent such as hand soap, hand wash, facial wash, cleansing foam, and body cleansing agent such as body soap, and also a hair cleansing agent such as shampoo.

After keeping in a thermostat bath (20±0.1° C.) for 1 hour, the liquid flow rate was measured. From the flow rate (t (sec)) of copper ammonia solution with various cellulose concentrations (g/dL) and flow rate (t0 (sec)) of aqueous copper ammonia solution to which cellulose has not been added, the reduced viscosity (ηsp/c) at each concentration was calculated in accordance with the following equation.

(4) Etherification Reaction Step; Cationizing Reaction Step: The obtained hydroxypropyl cellulose (226.4 g) was added to a high speed mixer (2 L total volume, manufactured by Fukae Pautec, Co., Ltd.). Under stirring with main wing at 337 rpm (running speed: 3 m/s) and side wing at 1800 rpm, a metallic vessel (500 mL) was installed on top of the mixer via a ball valve, and 3-chloro-2-hydroxypropyltrimethyl ammonium chloride (manufactured by Yokkaichi Chemical Co., Ltd., moisture content of 30% and purity of 70%) (109.1 g) was added to the vessel. The jacket was heated and stirred for 2 hours under temperature control (internal temperature: 50° C.) to give a crude C-HPC. The crude C-HPC was neutralized with lactic acid. Further, for the purpose of obtaining the substitution degree of the propyleneoxy group, the neutralization product was purified by using a dialysis membrane (molecular weight cut off: 1000) and the aqueous solution was subjected to freeze-drying to give a purified C-HPC (9). The average polymerization degree of the obtained purified C-HPC (9), and substitution degree of the cationized ethyleneoxy group and substitution degree of the propyleneoxy group are described in Tables 3 and 4.

The obtained chip-shape pulp was added to a vacuum dryer (product name: VO-402, manufactured by Advantec Toyo Kaisha, Ltd.) and dried for 2 hours at 105° C., 20 kPa under nitrogen stream to give dry chip-shape pulp (average polymerization degree: 1604, α-cellulose content: 99.2%, crystallinity: 74%, and moisture content: 0.8%). (2) Production of Alkali Cellulose (Step 1) The obtained dry chip-shape pulp (920 g) was supplied to a vibration rod mill (“FV-10” manufactured by CHUG KAKOHKI Co., Ltd.: total vessel volume of 35 L, 63 rods made of SUS304, in which each rod has diameter of 30 mm, length of 510 nm, and round cross section, and filling ratio of 70%). After performing pulverizing treatment for 10 minutes (frequency of 20 Hz, amplitude of 8 mm, and temperature of from 10 to 40° C.), a powdery pulp with lowered crystallinity (920 g, average polymerization degree: 1198, crystallinity: 14%, moisture content: 1.0%) was obtained as a cellulose-containing raw material (I). (Step 2) The powdery pulp (4450 g) obtained from above step (1) as cellulose-containing raw material (I) was supplied to a mixer (75 L total volume, “Pro Share mixer” manufactured by Pacific Machinery & Engineering Co., Ltd), and while being stirred with main wing at 3 m/s and chopper wing at 1800 rpm, 43% aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide (2580 g (equivalent to 1.0 mol per mol of AGU of raw material (II) cellulose, and 31% of water per raw material (II) cellulose)) was added for 1.5 minutes by spraying. After the spraying, the internal temperature was increased to 50° C. and aged under stirring for 3 hours to obtain an alkali cellulose mixture. (3) Etherification Reaction Step; Reaction Step for Obtaining Hydroxypropylation: The alkali cellulose mixture (7030 g) obtained from above step 2 was stirred in the Pro Share mixer with main wing at 1 m/s and chopper wing at 400 rpm while the temperature was increased to 50° C. After that, propylene oxide (5580 g, equivalent to 3.5 mol per mol of AGU of the alkali cellulose mixture) was added dropwise thereto for 6 hours. Once the dropwise addition was completed, it was aged for 3 hours at 50° C. (4) Etherification Reaction Step; Cationizing Reaction Step: The obtained hydroxypropyl cellulose (192.0 g) was added to a high speed mixer (2 L total volume, manufactured by Fukae Pautec, Co., Ltd.). Under stirring with main wing at 337 rpm (running speed: 3 m/s) and side wing at 1800 rpm, a metallic vessel (500 mL) was installed on top of the mixer via a ball valve, and 3-chloro-2-hydroxypropyltrimethyl ammonium chloride (manufactured by Yokkaichi Chemical Co., Ltd., moisture content of 30% and purity of 70%) (95.08 g) was added to the vessel. The jacket was heated and stirred for 2 hours under temperature control (internal temperature: 50° C.) to give a crude C-HPC. The crude C-HPC was neutralized with lactic acid. Further, for the purpose of obtaining the substitution degree of the propyleneoxy group, the neutralization product was purified by using a dialysis membrane (molecular weight cut off: 1000) and the aqueous solution was subjected to freeze-drying to give a purified C-HPC (10). The average polymerization degree of the obtained purified C-HPC (10), and substitution degree of the cationized ethyleneoxy group and substitution degree of the propyleneoxy group are described in Tables 3 and 4.
