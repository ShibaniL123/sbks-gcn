"A high flow nasal therapy system" Introduction The invention relates to delivery of aerosol to the respiratory tract via the nasopharynx "high flow nasal therapy" ("HFNT"). Currently, aerosol can be delivered during HFNT using a vibrating mesh nebuliser (or other aerosol generator) and a T-piece positioned in the flow path. US2008/0017198 (Ivri) describes an aerosol delivery apparatus for pressure-assisted breathing systems. WO2013/163527 (Medstar Health) describes an aerosol system with an inspiratory limb and an expiratory limb . US2005/0284469 (Tobia et al) describes a system with a nebulizer and a gas monitoring device downstream of the nebulizer. WO2012/079684/US2014/0290646 (NLI GmbH) describes a nasal inhalation device with a controller for applying a pattern to activation of an aerosol generator. This relies on exhalation down a separate dedicated limb whilst aerosol is being generated in the inspiratory limb. WO2005/048982 (Nektar) describes a ventilator circuit with aerosol delivery, in which there is an inhalation line and an exhalation line. FR2783431 (System Assistance Medical) describes a nebulizer with main and secondary ducts. A major problem with HFNT is that often only small quantities of aerosol are delivered to the patient's respiratory tract, due to losses during patient exhalation or droplet impaction in the high flows required for HFNT. Also, where a jet nebulizer is used for HFNT, it requires 6 to 8 1/min to generate aerosol. This requires that an additional flow be added to the flow being delivered to the patient, and this additional flow must be accounted for. This is problematic during the delivery of HFNT therapy to paediatrics and neonates who can require flows in the range 1 to 3 1/min. The flow required to drive the jet nebuliser would exceed this flow. Also, both jet and ultrasonic nebulizers have high residual volumes. Moreover, ultrasonic systems can overheat the medication thereby potentially inactivating/denaturing labile formulations. The invention addresses these problems.

Detailed Description of the Invention The invention will be more clearly understood from the following description of some embodiments thereof, given by way of example only with reference to the accompanying drawings in which:- Fig. 1 is a diagram illustrating a HFNT system of the invention; Figs. 2(a) and 2(b) are diagrams showing different arrangements of limb size extending from the valve which controls flow into and between the limbs, Figs. 3(a) and 3(b) illustrate different control schemes with continuous variation between the limbs, Fig. 4 is a set of plots showing emitted dose and respirable dose efficiencies recorded across actively controlled gas flow rates, Figs. 5(a) and 5(b) are diagrams showing different arrangements for connection of the limbs to a cannula, in which each limb feeds a single cannula prong only, and Fig. 6 is a diagram illustrating an alternative system. Referring to Fig. 1 a system 1 comprises a gas inlet 2 feeding a regulator 3, in turn feeding a needle valve 4. This feeds a humidifier 5 which actively humidifies the gas and feeds the humidified gas to a flow splitter valve 6. The latter is in this embodiment an electronic 3-way valve from which there are two branches (or "limbs") leading to a nasal interface (e.g. cannula, mask, pillow) 7. Control is provided by an electronic controller 16. The branches are a first branch 10 which is primarily for receiving humidified air only (that is to say never exposed to aerosolised medicament), and a second branch 11 having a nebulizer chamber 12 and a line 13 for delivery of aerosol carried in the humidified gas. There is also a sensor to detect patient inhalation and exhalation, in this case a flow meter 15 across the limbs at the patient end. The function of the flow meter 15 is to detect when the patient is inhaling, and thereafter provide a signal for control of the electronic 3-way valve 6. The feedback signal from the sensor 15 is only used to change the limb through which the airflow is delivered. The positive pressure gas flow is unidirectional and it is not intended, or likely, that the patient exhales back down one or both limbs at any time throughout the breathing cycle. Splitting the unidirectional flow path into two limbs allows for aerosol bolus accumulation in the limb 11 whilst the patient is exhaling. The advantage of aerosol bolus delivery derives from the inhalation of high concentration aerosol medicament with minimal medicament wastage during exhalation as is a problem with some prior art approaches. The bolus will build up in the limb 11 due to the lack of flow through this limb during periods of the breath cycle not associated with inhalation. The only activity generated in the limb 11 during these periods will be by the aerosol generator releasing aerosol droplets into the limb. This limb 11 is not sealed proximal to the patient and in the case of extended periods excess build-up of aerosol may exit limb 11 at the terminal of the line 13. All aerosol droplets released into the limb 11 are potentially available to the patient when required. The controller 16 and the valve 6 actively switch limbs as a means of aerosol protection. The apparatus 1 achieves an advantageous means of aerosol protection whilst maintaining positive pressure ventilator support during exhalation continuously at all times. In contrast, in the prior approach of having a dedicated inhalation limb and a dedicated exhalation limb to take the exhalation flow in the opposite direction, there may be either 1) positive pressure support during exhalation by having the inspiratory limb with a gas flow (preventing the accumulation of an aerosol bolus), or 2) it does not provide positive pressure ventilatory support during exhalation. Advantageously, in the invention described herein there is continuous provision of ventilatory support. The gas flow rate in the first branch 11 can be relatively reduced by means of a flow restrictor. This may for example be a narrower section of tubing, an array of holes in a plate, or by means of the degree to which the flow splitter 6 opens, allowing for a controlled gas flow to pass through. A gas flow rate, for the branch 11 which is lower than that passing through the second branch 10 allows for maximal entrainment of suspended aerosol droplets whilst mitigating the risk of aerosol losses through inertial impaction in high flows. One or both of the limbs 10 and 11 may in some embodiments be heated by means of a heater such as a heated wire in the lumen of the limb or alternatively arranged around the circumference of the limb. Heated tubing is not a requirement but is desirable. The inner diameters of the limbs 10 and 11 can be equal. However it is envisaged that the limb 11 may have a larger inner diameter than that of the limb 10. This arrangement would i) increase the internal volume of the limb such that a larger bolus of aerosol can be stored, ii) reduce gravitational/sedimentary and inertial aerosol losses within limb 11 during the aerosol bolus- building periods where the gas flow is exclusively passing through the limb 10, and iii) to reduce the velocity of the gas passing through the limb 11 thereby reducing the potential for inertial aerosol losses. Of note, for all combinations of gas flow and limb usage, positive pressure ventilatory support is provided to the patient at all times, i.e. during inhalation, positive pressure ventilatory support is provided via limb 11, during exhalation, positive pressure ventilatory support is provided via limb 10. Fig. 2(a) illustrates the embodiment where the limbs 11 and 10 are of equal dimensions, whereas Fig. 2(b) illustrates an embodiment in which where the aerosol limb (11(a)) is wider. Further, the limb 11 may be extended in length when compared with the limb 10. Also, the line 13 may in some embodiments be expandable, but this is not essential. In this embodiment the line 13 is the post-nebuliser side of branch 11 suitable to be filled with aerosol. The system 1 delivers aerosol therapy during HFNT. It cyclically accumulates a bolus of aerosol in the line 13, of the branch 11. The cycle in this embodiment is the breathing cycle and the bolus is accumulated in the line 13 during exhalation. The flow to the patient reverts to non-aerosol laden humidified air in the branch 10 during exhalation. Switching is achieved by means of the electronically controlled 3- way valve 6. At all times the flows in the branches are towards the patient in both of the limbs 11 and 10. The patient's exhaled gas exits the patient via the mouth and to the air, and around the cannula in the nose to the air. Exhaled gas does not flow down the branches 11 or 10 as they are pressurised. The positive pressure gas flow is unidirectional and it is not intended, or likely, that the patient exhales back down one or both limbs at any time throughout the breathing cycle. Splitting the unidirectional flow path into two limbs is particularly effective at allowing aerosol bolus accumulation in the limb 11 whilst the patient is exhaling. This helps to achieve the inhalation of high concentration aerosol medicament with minimal medicament wastage during exhalation as is the problem in the prior art. The feedback for the valve 6 control may take the form of a pressure change (positive or negative, measured with a pressure transducer), flow rate change (measured with a flow meter), respiratory gas (e.g. C02 measured with an appropriate monitor capable of real time digital outputs). Feedback may also take the form of manual user inputs such as button presses. The controller may have an "aerosol delivery mode" on a software GUI or other user interface. On selection of this mode, the valve 6 may act according to its preprogramed instructions to regulate gas flow between the limbs 10 and 11. Under conditions where the aerosol delivery mode is not selected, the valve 6 can act to split the gas flow through one or both of the limbs 10 and 11 concurrently. Because the controller prevents gas flow in the branch 11 during patient exhalation, it allows for the accumulation of aerosol as a bolus as it is not cleared from the branch. Accumulation of aerosol as a bolus results in a high concentration of aerosol being available immediately on inhalation, and thereby improves efficiency of aerosol delivery to the patient. In alternative embodiments the switching may be according to a different control scheme. For example, where perhaps a drug may only be suitable for delivery once every half hour, the controller may operate the valve 6 so that the flow is from the branch 11 at this frequency. The system provides the flexibility of delivering aerosol either breath-by-breath or for pre-defined portions of treatment. The control scheme may be factory- set or it may in alternative embodiments be configurable by the clinician or by the user. In all cases, the controlled division between the branches avoids need to dynamically control the output of the nebulizer 12, although this may additionally be done. The valve 6 is controlled so that the inlet flow is directed in varying proportions between 0% and 100% between the branches 11 and 10. In more detail, upon receipt of the feedback signal; a) The 3- way valve switches to limb 11 only, resulting in no gas flow entering the limb 10 (0 litres per minute (LPM)) and all gas flow entering limb 11 (X LPM). b) The 3-way valve splits the gas flow between limbs 10 and 11. The split may take the form of (% of gas flow: % of gas flow) 50:50, 90: 10, 25:75 as examples. These control schemes are illustrated in Figs. 3(a) and 3(b). Under these gas flow conditions, the aerosol generator may be activated or not, depending on the user selected options. The internal geometries of the line 13 may be different from those of the line 10 so as to allow for maximal generation and storage of the aerosol bolus. These differences may include any or all of the following, but are not limited to; the use of smooth tubing as opposed to corrugated tubing, larger internal diameter tubing, longer length tubing. Additionally, the internal geometries of the line 13 may be different from those of line 10 so as to allow for alteration of the aerosol carrier gas velocity. The valve 6 may be controlled according to the needle valve/flow regulator 6 such that when the gas flow is being directed down the limb 11, or a combination of limbs 10 and 11, the total gas flow is reduced by the gas flow controller 4. This embodiment is designed to reduce aerosol losses within the limb 11 in an effort to increase the emitted fraction of aerosol. The benefits are illustrated in the plots of Fig. 4. Referring to Fig. 5(a), in another embodiment an aerosolisation limb 111 similar to the limb 11 and a gas-only limb 110 similar to the limb 10 feed a nasal cannula 107 with two separate prongs 107(a) and 107(b) each for a single nare. In operation, it is likely that gas flow would be delivered down both limbs 110 and 111 such that the back pressure generated by such a restriction would not interfere with gas flow being delivered to the patient. A potential advantage is that given aerosol shall enter the nasopharynx via one nostril only there will be no mixing of aerosol streams, thereby increasing aerosol rainout in the naso and oropharynx. Another potential advantage is the alternating of pressure build-up between nostrils. It is believed by some that mononasal HFNT reduces intercranial pressure. In another embodiment, as shown in Fig. 5(b) a limb 210 and a limb 211 join at a conduit 215 prior to connection with a cannula 207. It will be appreciated that the system optimises gas flow rates and aerosol delivery efficiency for HFNT. Positive end expiratory pressures can be controlled by the caregiver. The system can provide feedback to the user regarding flow rates and pressures to achieve optimum therapy. Table 1 lists examples of the logic flows used in this system. Table 1: Logic flow Referring To Fig. 6 an alternative system 20, comprises: 21 = Air inlet 22 = Humidifier 23 = Nebulizer 24 = Flow Meter in line to patient interface 25 = Nebulizer power supply and output controller 26 = Communication lines between 25 and 21 or 23 27 = Patient interface, e.g. nasal cannula The gas inlet 21 has a regulator feeding a needle valve Z. This feeds the humidifier 22 which actively humidifies the gas and feeds the humidified gas to the patient circuit. The patient circuit leads to the nasal interface 27 (for example cannula, mask, and/or pillow). The system control unit 25 houses a standalone flow generator, including but not limited to a fan. The gas flow rate within the system can be detected by means of the flow meter 24 or alternatively by an electronic or mechanical signal supplied by the regulator, in the case of an integrated device providing both user interface and flow generation and regulation. These components are connected directly with and supply a signal to the nebuliser controller 25. The nebuliser controller 25 controls nebuliser output described as aerosol flow rate (miUilitres of medicament aerosolised per minute), aerosol density (number of aerosol droplets per unit volume of gas) or intermittent on-off pulses, of varying durations, of aerosol generation. The nebuliser 23 may be placed on the gas inlet side of the humidifier 22 or the patient side of the humidifier 22, and its operation is directly controlled by the nebuliser controller 25. Placement of the nebuliser 23 on the gas inlet side of the humidifier 22 allows for preconditioning of the gas prior to humidification. The nebuliser shall ideally emit a droplet size in the range of 0.1 to 10 microns MMAD, however droplets up to 20 microns MMAD may find utility in targeting the nasal passages specifically. Communication between the gas flow generator control unit and/or the flow meter 24 will identify no gas flow conditions that will be converted to a signal sent to the nebuliser controller 25 and/or the humidifier 22. In this instance of no-flow, or backward flow (flow coming from the patient side towards the flow generator) the nebuliser 23 and/or the humidifier 22 shall be prevented from generating aerosol and/or humidity. The function of this feature is to protect internal electronics, fans and other components of the flow generator and control unit from exposure to aerosol or humidity. The detection of gas flow rate may result in one of several conditions including, but not limited to; control of the nebuliser output or control of the gas flow rate on a temporary basis. In the instance where the nebuliser output is controlled, predefined output settings shall be supplied by the controller 25 to the nebuliser 23. These output settings may include, but are not limited to: reduction of aerosol output concurrent with high gas flow rates, or alternatively an increase in nebuliser output concurrent with low gas flow rates. The function of this control is to optimise aerosol delivery to the patient. In the instance where gas flow rate is controlled, gas flow rates may be reduced or increased on a temporary basis in order to allow for optimised aerosol delivery to the patient. In the system 20 gas flow rate can be monitored in the following ways: - Integrated control of/from electromechanical gas flow generator, for example standalone fan capable of generating therapeutically relevant gas flow rates in the range of 0 to 100 litres per minute. - Pressure transducer, which is in fluid communication with gas flow limb, incorporated into nebuliser controller system. - Digital Flow meter, which is in fluid communication with gas flow limb, incorporated into nebuliser controller system. Referring again to Fig. 4, this shows plots for emitted dose and respirable dose delivery rates across gas flow rates for both high and reduced nebuliser outputs following dynamic nebuliser aerosol output monitoring and control. It will be seen that the slopes are similar, both being downward indicating lower dose with increased gas flow. The data for the plots of Fig. 4 is given in Table 2 below. Table 2: Emitted dose and tracheal dose (expressed as a percentage of the nominal dose placed in the nebuliser prior to test) across 3 standard gas flow rates for both high and reduced aerosol output. NOTES: 1 Emitted dose describes the percentage of the nominal nebuliser dose exiting the system with no simulated patient breathing. Tracheal dose describes the percentage of the nominal nebuliser dose delivered beyond the trachea in a model of a simulated breathing adult patient. Table 3 below lists examples of the logic flows used in this system. INPUT to system OUTPUT from system Control unit programmed by Nebuliser output altered user to a set flow rate Control unit programmed by Pre-programed software does user to a set flow rate not allow selected gas flow rate to be generated during aerosol therapy User informed of suboptimal aerosol delivery conditions Control unit programmed by Nebuliser aerosol output user to a set nebuliser aerosol increased. output Nebuliser aerosol output decreased for optimal aerosol delivery conditions in high gas flow Nebuliser aerosol output decreased for extended e.g. all day or overnight delivery of medication Flowmeter detects no gas No aerosol generated flow Table 3 Aerosol output can be controlled by real-time software monitoring of gas flow rates, and subsequent control of nebuliser power or cycling. Real-time monitoring of gas flow and concurrent adjustment of aerosol output to pre-set levels has applications across several patient interfaces. - One primary use may be the day-long, long-term use of high flow nasal therapy (HFNT). Patients receiving HFNT often wear the device 24-hours a day and during periods of non- activity (e.g. sleep) may increase or decrease the gas flow rate to comfortable levels. During this period, the patient may need to wake up in order to add more medication to the medication cup, or alternatively remove any rainout building up in their breathing circuit. - Other examples of single limb, positive pressure-only systems include non-invasive ventilation systems, e.g. CPAP and BiPAP. Control of nebuliser output on the basis of inspiratory pressure or flows may help avoid wastage of medication. - In instances where the nebuliser system is integrated into a standalone gas flow generator or regulator for short term use, and where therapeutically acceptable, the control mechanism may be used to reduce the gas flow rate to optimal levels for the duration of aerosol therapy only, and restoring gas flow rates again at the end of dose. - Protection of equipment. On occasions where the nebuliser control system is integrated into a standalone gas flow generator or regulator, the optimal placement of the nebuliser for respirable dose optimisation may result in aerosol being generated close to electronics or components that could be adversely affected by aerosol, e.g. float valves on humidifier chambers. Detection of a "no-flow" or "low-flow" condition could be used to prevent generation of aerosol, and thereby protect the incumbent equipment. The invention is not limited to the embodiments described but may be varied in construction and detail. For example the humidifier may be located in the non-aerosolisation branch only. Where the humidifier is in a common inlet, then it may be controlled to have a reduced or zero output when the flow is only through the aerosolized branch. Humidity is known to alter (increase) droplet size and so under the conditions described where airflow is directed through the limb 11 the risks of increased aerosol losses in humidified air are mitigated. Also, it is envisaged that the system may include a means of control of aerosol output to a level deemed appropriate for the gas flow rate being delivered (not on the basis of patient-side sensor feedback. In this embodiment, control of aerosol output is in fluid or digital communication with the gas flow generator. At various gas flow rates aerosol output can be varied in order to maximise the emitted aerosol dose from the system. Variations in aerosol output can take the form of on/off, or reduced/increased output. Further, on selection of an "aerosol delivery mode" the system may act to temporarily reduce the gas flow rate for the duration of active aerosol generation. Fig. 4 illustrates the effect of varying both aerosol output and gas flow rate on emitted dose from the system. Under conditions where reduced gas flow rates are not appropriate (clinically) aerosol generator output can be varied to the same effect.
