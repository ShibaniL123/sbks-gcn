CALCIUM ALUMINATE CLINKER AS A REFRACTORY AGGREGATE WITH AND WITHOUT BARIUM ADDITION AND USE THEREOF Background of the Invention 1. Field of the Invention The use of calcium aluminate clinker as a refractory aggregate in shapes and castables. The present invention provides an improved refractory aggregate based on CaO AI2O3 clinker (hereinafter referred to as "CA" clinker and designated by the following equation CnAx, wherein preferably η is an integer from about 1 to 12 and χ is an integer from about 1-24) and CnAx hydrate phases and analogs or derivatives thereof including those based on barium substitution for calcium or barium additions resulting in calcium substitution after chemical reaction and/or heat treatment, all of which are referred to herein as CA clinker. Refractory materials based on aggregate compositions having these phases singularly or combined, and exclusive of C12A7 as a major phase, are provided in the present invention. 2. Description of the Background Art Lafarge Calcium Aluminates Inc. (Maryland, USA) markets a calcium aluminate clinker as an aggregate available under their "r50" trade name. This clinker known by those skilled in the art is about 52% alumina and is dense. The presence of a relatively large amount of C12A7 causes the LaFarge Calcium Aluminates, Inc.'s calcium aluminate clinker to melt and the product is essentially fused with little or no porosity. Thus, this composition has little utility as a refractory aggregate. The present invention provides a composition comprising a CnAx clinker that lacks significant amounts of C12A7 and that has the additional benefit of the presence of porosity and usefulness as a refractory aggregate. It is known in the refractory arts that the addition of barium-containing materials impart a penetration resistance to materials in contact with molten aluminum. In another embodiment of the present invention, compositions are provided wherein barium is substituted into the CA clinker matrix of the present invention resulting in ΒΑ6, BC2A4 and the other analogs that increase the performance of the product and resist aluminum penetration to a great degree. A primary area of application for the compositions of the present invention is in contact with molten aluminum. Because aluminum has such a low viscosity in the molten state, it easily penetrates the refractory used to contain it. This causes the refractory to wear. In addition, penetration of the refractory causes the freeze plane to move further into the refractory lining thereby allowing molten aluminum to 5 penetrate further. Ideal materials are those that resist aluminum penetration and are insulating enough to have the freeze plane as close as possible to the hot face or contact face of the refractory lining. Current technology relies on the addition of penetration inhibitors that work either by reducing the porosity of the refractory, which can result in moving the freeze plane further into the lining, or by changing the wetting angle of the aluminum on the refractory. Well known examples of these penetration inhibitors are lo fluorospar and barium sulfate, respectively. Other ways of reducing penetration known by those skilled in the art involve the use of increasingly pure alumina as an aggregate and making this material as dense as possible to reduce open porosity and hence penetration. This increases the conductivity of the material and pushes the freeze plane into the backup refractory lining in most typical configurations known by those skilled in the art. L5 Therefore, in spite of the background art, there remains a very real and substantial need for a refractory composition and a refractory aggregate composition having the improved calcium aluminate clinker, and a sprayable and/or castable refractory composition, for use, such as for example, but not limited to, as a refractory lining in the production of molten aluminum.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Figure 1 shows a phase diagram that sets forth the CaO - AI2O3 system. C= CaO, Α= AI2O3. The horizontal axis of Figure 1 shows molecular formations in the range up to the pure oxide of aluminum or AI2O3 on the right and pure CaO on the left. The numbers on the horizontal axis represent the percent of AI2O3 present in the system. 1 ^ Figure 2 shows a more detailed description of the higher AI2O3 portion of Figure 1. Figure 3 shows the BaO- CaO- AI2O3 system containing BaO at 1250 degrees Centigrade. Figure 4 shows the BaO- CaO- AI2O3 system containing BaO at 1400 degrees Centigrade. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION (p) The present invention provides a calcium aluminate (CA) clinker without C12A7 as a major phase and further comprising Αΐ2Ο3(Α), CA (the discrete compound Ca0-Al203, not to be confused with the CA clinker) and CA2 as major phases. There can be other phases present in the clinker such as, for example, C3A, C2A4, etc. Upon heating, the phases can form CAg. In any case, it is known that these phases, including the C12A7, naturally resist penetration of molten 21aluminum, to a degree. In a preferred embodiment of this invention, the CA clinkers of the present invention, for example, but not limited to rotary kiln products, have other beneficial features, at alumina contents of about 68% and higher. First, the shape of the aggregate is rounded making it easier to create a free flowing material. Also, because of the raw materials used to make the product, it tends to form into porous spheres. The porosity of the spheres 2b becomes important if an insulation material, as a final product, is desired. When the aggregate is mixed with water, either in a castable product or shape mix, the surface of the aggregate becomes activated and begins to form the expected hydrates. When the set reaction or precipitation reaction occurs, the porosity of the aggregate is sealed off and the aggregate is bonded together through surface contact. The benefit here is a more insulating material that resists penetration. When a large portion of the mix is the same type of material such as the case would be in a castable, the resulting strength of the material is greatly enhanced by the ability of the aggregate \5 and the matrix to bond with each other. In this case, the final material is a true monolith that naturally resists penetration and is insulating in character due to the sealed off porosity of the surface activated CA clinker. Because the CA clinker of the instant invention contains little or no C12A7, the material can be used at elevated temperatures consistent with aluminum manufacturing as well as other processes. The Q2A7 is a low melting phase that is common to 10 cements having AI2O3 contents of 65% and lower. The more preferred CA clinker products of this invention are those with an AI2O3 content greater than sixty eight percent (68%) by weight in the clinker, as opposed to clinker co-ground with other materials such as additional AI2O3. Preferably, the CA clinker of the present invention as described herein comprises a concentration of AI2O3 greater than or equal to about sixty eight percent by weight (68% w/w) based upon the 15 current manufacturing process of calcium aluminate cements known by those persons skilled in the art. This leads to a final composition of the present invention having a minimal C12A7 content. However, from the phase diagrams of Figures 1 and 2 it can be seen that upon the formation of the CA and CA2 phases (near 68% AI2O3) and up to but not including pure AI2O3, represents the ideal composition of the aggregate. That is CA, CA2, C3A5, CA6 and AI2O3 alone 2ο or in combination. The present applicant has discovered that CA clinkers containing C12A7 in appreciable amounts are undesirable. Thus, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the concentration of AI2O3 can be used as a guideline in determining the potential usefulness of the aggregate, however, the determining factor is limiting the presence of low melting phases, in particular C12A7, that ultimately determines the usefulness of the aggregate. The applicant of the -25 present invention has found that C12A7 concentrations of greater than about 3 molar % (Mol%, or Μ %) would not afford a useful aggregate for applications exceeding 1400 degrees Centigrade but may prove useful at lower temperature applications. Another embodiment of this invention provides the CA clinker composition as described herein and wherein the composition further includes the addition of a source of barium (added in Go a variety of forms such as the carbonate or sulfate salts). If the barium exists in the proper ratio with the CaO(C) and the AI2O3 (A) one can form ΒΑδ, Β3Α, BA, and BC2A4 (where Β = BaO) with temperature. These are analogs of CAe, C3A, and CA, while BC2A4 is a derivative (Fig. 3 and Fig. 4). The presence of these phases greatly enhances the ability of the product to resist penetration by not only changing the contact angle of the aluminum, but also forming a solid solution distributed equally throughout the matrix. This is significantly different than the Ο heterogeneous mixtures current technologies have with barium sulfate additions. Figure 1 shows a phase diagram that sets forth the CaO - AI2O3 system. The horizontal axis of Figure 1 shows molecular formations in the range up to the pure oxide of aluminum or AI2O3 on the right and pure CaO on the left. The numbers on the horizontal axis represent the percent of AI2O3 present in the system. The resulting solid phases are shown in the boxes set |0 forth in Figure 1. The temperatures (in degrees Centigrade) at which they are present, and stable, are shown on the vertical axis of Figure 1. Note that the boxes of Figure lcontaining the Q2A7 solid begin to form liquids (area above the boxes at or near 1400 degrees Centigrade). The effect of the liquid is reduced strength and increased reactivity with the surrounding environment, both of which are detrimental. The diagram of Figure 1 shows pure CA present at about 68% AI2O3. 15 From greater than or equal to about 68% AI2O3 compositions, formed phases are useful as aggregate. Figure 2 shows a more detailed description of the higher AI2O3 portion of Figure 1. Figures 3 and 4 show the BaO-CaO-ABCb systems of the present invention containing BaO at 1250 degrees Centigrade and 1400 degrees Centigrade, respectively. BaO concentrations greater than zero percent that lead to formation of ΒΑδ and C2BA4 are beneficial. The presence 50 of C2BA4 (higher concentrations of BaO, via barium sulfate additions as the barium source in the following examples) results in improved penetration resistance. The calcium aluminate (CA) clinker of the present invention as described herein is a viable aggregate (as compared to a bond matrix) for refractory products. The clinker may comprise all of the aggregate or a portion thereof. This does not include the use of the compound as a discrete bonding matrix such as cement, where it is currently used in a variety of materials. The CA clinker is composed of CnAx, CnAx hydrate, and AI2O3 phases. It will be appreciated by those persons skilled in the art that commercially available clinker have several impurities present such as for example various iron oxides, silicon oxides, alkali, and alkaline earth compounds, etc. The present applicant has found that the purer the clinker the better will be its temperature resistance, and preferably that the impurities are present in concentrations less that 1%, the clinker will suffice as a useable aggregate. A typical commercially available clinker chemistry is shown here in Table 1 below: TABLE 1 Ingredient Avg. Wt.% AI2O3 69.63 Si02 <0.8 Ρ℮2θ3 <0.5 CaO 28.12 Others Combined <0.95 0 AI2O3 69.63 to It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the commercially available clinkers available as set forth in Table 1 will vary from batch to batch and supplier to supplier due to raw material sourcing and other variations. In the compositions of the CA clinker of the present invention, the presence of C12A7 is limited as a minor constituent such that compositions comprise AI2O3 contents >68% in 15 reference to the aggregate or clinker. As used herein, the term "major'' means at least about 50% or greater. As used herein, the term "minor" means less than about 50%. This does not include co-ground or blended materials whose chemistry can be controlled by addition of discrete dilutents. This is important because C12A7 is a low melting phase that limits the maximum operating temperature of the product if present in substantial amounts. The application of the 2ό compositions of the present invention is limited to an operational temperature not exceeding about 1820 degrees Centigrade. At this temperature liquid phases form in the pure system. It should be noted that the product will not be a pure system due to impurities present in the clinker. The CA aggregate or clinker of the present invention may be a sinter product if porosity % is desired or a fusion product if porosity is not desired (including partial fusions as a means of controlling porosity). In some cases, such as aluminum contact, porosity is desirable in order to give the working refractory lining greater insulating character. This can move the freeze plane closer to the hot face and therefore allow for a thinner lining if desired. This in turn can allow for increased production or transport capacity of aluminum, for example. In the present invention the active surface of the aggregate allows these particles to participate in the bonding matrix, particularly at ambient temperature. Although it is true that a cement bonding mix will bind almost any aggregate present, the aggregate itself retains its individuality. It is surrounded by a bond which holds it in place, but does not become part of that bond. The surface of the aggregate and the bonding matrix are essentially identical, in the case of a castable made of the CA clinker of the present invention as the aggregate. Therefore, the aggregate and matrix become one and each component loses its individuality. Indeed no grain boundaries exist in the product made from the composition of the present invention identifying where the matrix ends and the aggregate begins. Only the remaining porosity of the IQ, inactivated interior of the aggregate indicates where an independent grain once existed. This results in the beneficial character of closed porosity, if desired, and increase strength of the true monolith. This character is retained as the material dehydrates with temperature. The addition of barium to the compositions of the present invention improves the enhanced properties even further by reacting to form analogs and derivatives of the CnAx and its 1¾ hydrates, which improve penetration resistance by forming in-situ. Figure 4 shows a phase diagram that sets forth the compounds of interest that are formed and their physical state at 1400 degrees Centigrade. Figure 4 shows that at AI2O3 contents of greater than 68% and with the presence of BaO, Ba can exist in three different forms at this temperature: BaO, which changes the contact angle of aluminum and allows for penetration resistance (current technology), ΒΑ℮ as .20 a solid or solid solution, and C2BA4 as a solid or solid solution. The presence of all three of these compounds improve penetration resistance. In a more preferred embodiment of this invention, the compositions include areas of the phase diagram, which can lead to the formation of ΒΑδ and C2BA4, which greatly improve the penetration resistance in comparison to the addition of BaO (typically as barium sulfate). In a preferred embodiment of this invention, the Αθ addition or use of BaO in combination with the CA clinker of this invention for use as an aggregate is provided. The following are examples of the compositions of the present invention. As used in the examples, CA clinker is as described herein; CAR60 Alumina is calcined alumina and is commercially available from Alcan Chemicals, Pittsburgh, PA; A-3000 FL Alumina is a reactive vjo alumina which are ultrafine refractory material about 0.4 micron and 3.0 microns average particle diameter size, respectively, and are greater than or equal to about ninety-nine (99) weight percent aluminum oxide material and is commercially available from Almatis Chemicals, Leetsdale, PA; Type 153 fibers are fibrous materials commercially available as "HERCULON 153" polyfibers (Hercules, Incorporated, Wilmington, Delaware); and the surfactant may be sodium tripolyphosphate (STPP) (UNIVAR Pittsburgh, Bunola, PA); Tabular Alumina is a refractory aggregate having greater than or equal to about ninety-nine (99) weight percent aluminum oxide commercially available from Almatis, Pittsburgh, PA; SLA-92 is a CA6 based lightweight (less than 120 pounds/cubic foot density) calcium aluminate aggregate commercially available from Almatis, Pittsburgh, PA.

CA cements containing greater than 70% alumina can be used. CA cement containing less than 70% alumina can also be used; however, most commercially available products have impurities, which increase in concentration as the alumina content decreases. Common brands of 70% alumina containing CA cement are Almatis’ CA14 product and Lafarge’s Secar 71 product. The average open porosity of the CA aggregate is near 53% while the TSG (total specific gravity) averages 2.9g/cm3 for the lot of aggregate used in this example. Note that batch to batch variation in these products are expected due to the manufacturing process of the CA aggregate.

Example #5 is a highly porous material that has interesting filtration properties. These examples may be applied via a variety of known installation techniques such as, 2) but not limited to slip casting, vibration casting, pump casting, shape pressing, gunning, and shotcreting. For example, in shotcreting, as understood by those skilled in the art, a dispersant/deflocculation system and optionally the use of a flocculating agent would be employed.
