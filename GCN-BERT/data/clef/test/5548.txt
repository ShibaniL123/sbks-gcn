Step 4
(E)-methyl3-(3,5-difluoro-4-((1R,3R/1S,3S)-5-fluoro-2-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl) -3-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrobenzofuro[2,3-c]pyridin-1-yl)phenyl)acrylate
2-fluoro-N-(1-(4-fluorobenzofuran-3-yl)propan-2-yl)-2-methylpropan-1-amine 73d (200 mg, 0.75 mmol), (E)-methyl 3-(3,5-difluoro-4-formylphenyl)acrylate 1e (254 mg, 1.12 mmol) and triisopropylsiyl chloride (723 mg, 3.75 mmol) were dissolved in 5 mL of N,N-dimethylformamide and placed in a sealed tube. The reaction was heated to 130Â°C and reacted for 3 hours, then the reaction was stopped. The reaction solution was cooled to room temperature and concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was purified by thin layer chromatography with elution system A to obtain the title compound (E)-methyl 3-(3,5-difluoro-4-((1R,3R/1S,3S)-5-fluoro-2-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-3-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrobenzofuro[2,3-c]pyridin-1-yl)pheny 1)acrylate 73e (300 mg, yield 84%) as a yellow oil.
