2 FIELD OF THE INVENTION: The present invention generally relates to design and fabrication of epoxy-cast bushings capable of serving multi purpose functions in high voltage gas insulated switchgear (GIS). More particularly, the present invention relates to a multipurpose epoxy-cast bushing for gas insulated switchgears. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION: Electrical bushings are usually used to conduct high voltage electrical power from a power line into another electrical device such, as transformers through switchgears. The metal housing of such electrical equipment is an electrical ground that is insulated from the high voltage power, being conducted into the electrical equipment, generally through an opening in the housing. Electrical bushings therefore comprise a conductor for high voltage power, an insulation material and means for mounting the bushing on the electrical equipment. There are usually known about two types of insulation for high voltage switchgears, one is Air Insulated Switchgear (AIS), and the other is called Gas Insulated Switchgear (GIS). GIS contains an insulating gas such as SF6. The manufacturing process as well as the design of GIS bushing varies from case to case depending on the application criteria and other associated requirements. European Patent Number ΕΡ0075471 Β1 dated Mar 26,1986 describes electrical bushings that comprise an electrical conductor, a first layer of insulation surrounding the conductor, a ground plane, and a stress-grading material surrounding the insulation, a flange for mounting the bushing to the electrical equipment or apparatus with which it is to be used, and an outer insulating 3 layer. The stress-grading material can extend a predetermined distance from the ground plane. The insulation of the first layer is, for example, a cured epoxy resin, or any similar material. A typical bushing of this type is disclosed in U.S. Patent No, 3 646 251 to Friedrich. It is taught by this prior art that the insulation layer, the interface between the insulation and stress grading material, and the interface between the insulation and the conductor becomes void-free. When an epoxy resin system is used that generally requires the epoxy resin to be degassed and then to be casted in a vacuum and further to be cured under pressure to prevent any void formation. U.S. Patent No. 3 312 776 discloses bushings in which resinous insulation material is cast around a stress shield and a conductor, the conductor being encompassed by a metallic braid. European Patent Number ΕΡ0993005 Α1 dated Apr 12, 2000 describes a bushing device, which is hermetically mounted in a hole of an electrical equipment, insulated with oil fluid or gas, and is provided with a metallic fixing flange having a diameter larger than the diameter of this hole. The bushing device is adapted thereof to interconnect an electrical distribution cable external to the equipment with a device internal to the equipment. The invention also describes addition of "anti-migratory additive" to the elastomeric material for improving its permeability in order to make it compatible with the insulating medium in the epoxy-cast bushing. European Patent Number ΕΡ1889265 Al dated Feb 20, 2008 describes a resinimpregnated graded bushing that has a conductor and a core surrounding the conductor in which the core comprises a sheet-like spacer, wherein the spacer contains filler particles. As per the invention, the spacer may comprise paper, in particular creped paper and the filler particles are preferably electrically insulating or semi conductive particles that allow an increased thermal conductivity of the core. 4 European Patent Number ΕΡ2415133 Al dated Feb 8, 2012 describes a bushing for connecting both GIS with AIS in which the bushing comprises a busbar and a shield. The busbar and the shield are embedded in an electrically insulating body. The GIS-side of electrically insulating body is conical and the AlS-side of electrically insulating body is hollow. The electrically insulating body comprises an assembling flange between the conical side and the hollow side. On the hollow side, a number of sheds are evenly distributed oh the exterior. The angle formed by the axis from the centre of the assembling flange to the end of conical side and the axis from the centre of the assembling flange to the end of the hollow side is less than 180 degree. European Patent Number ΕΡ1202417 Α2 dated May 02, 2002 describes a gas-insulated switchgear provided with a resin mold bushing for supporting and insulating a main circuit conductor from a ground tank. A container portion is formed by opening an end inside of the tank of a resin mold bushing for supporting and insulating an internal conductor from a ground tank where a breaker and a disconnector are accommodated. A blade-supporting a conductor of the disconnector for joining the internal conductor and the disconnector is installed in the container portion. ΕΡ1160945Α1 discloses a gas-insulated switchgear which comprises a cable bushing. This kind of cable bushing is widely used as a connection device in the switchgears. In this context, the present invention describes the design and fabrication of a so- called, "multipurpose Epoxy Bushings" primarily used for insulation for high voltage applications. Such bushings have not yet been used as structural member, or as a medium of current transfer. The unique design in the invention 5 makes the bushing to serve multiple usages either in a single or several multiple combinations depending on the area and or exact conditions of the application/s in this area. OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION It is therefore an object of the invention to propose a multipurpose epoxy-cast bushing for gas insulated switchgears. Another object of the invention is to propose a multipurpose epoxy-cast bushing for gas insulated switchgears, which overcomes possible dielectric breakdown in high voltage stress locations of the switchgear. Another object of the invention is to propose a multipurpose epoxy-cast bushing for gas insulated switchgears, which is provided with sealing arrangement/s between high voltage chambers to prevent the arc, in case of any fault traveling from one chamber to the other. A still another object of the invention is to propose a multipurpose epoxy-cast bushing for gas insulated switchgears, which includes rigid fixed contact to prevent mechanical bending upon engagement of the moving contacts. A further objects of the invention is to propose a multipurpose epoxy-cast bushing for gas insulated switchgears, which is enabled to provide structural support to the interrupters. 6 Yet another object of the invention is to propose a multipurpose epoxy-cast bushing for gas insulated switchgears, which prevents leakage of medium gas (SF6) to the atmosphere. A further object of the invention is to propose a multipurpose epoxy-cast bushing for gas insulated switchgears, which is flexible to act as a gas communicator. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION According to the invention, there is provided a multipurpose epoxy-cast bushing for gas insulated switchgears. The gas insulated switchgear has at least three high voltage chambers, the bushing connects any of two chambers. The three chambers Busbar Chamber, Breaker Chamber and Cable Termination Chamber. The Busbar Chamber comprising bus bars, interpanel barriers, droppers, and on load isolators, and the Breaker chamber comprising a plurality of Vacuum interrupters and a driving mechanism. An insulating body is embedded in the bushing with a conducting link to accommodate a conducting copper terminal to allow current transfer, on the hollow side of which at least one vacuum interrupter is provided. The current transfer from the bushing to the conductor takes place via a multi lam contact mounted on a sliding conductor which can be slided into the embedded copper terminal. The bushing comprises a plurality of slots at 120 degrees on the insulated body to enable the bushing to communicate gas between two adjacent chambers. The bushing when not provided with slots, enables the bushing to seal the chamber it is connected to, and allow generation of a pressure difference between the two adjacent chambers. 7 BRIEF DESCERIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS The above and other objects and features of the invention will become more apparent and the invention itself will be best understood by referring to the following description of an embodiment taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which: Figure 1Α describes a side view of a multi-purpose bushing with a slot (optional). Figure IB describes a side view of the multi-purpose bushing without the slot for gas communication. Figure 2Α describes a sectional side view of the bushing. Rgure 2Β describes the bushing of Figure 2Α without the slots for gas communication. This feature enables to have pressure difference between the adjacent chambers. Figure 3 describes adaptation of the multi-purpose bushing as a medium for current transfer, the current transfer taking place through the gas communicator embedded in the epoxy casting. Figure 4 describes a clamping arrangement of the multi purpose bushing. 8 DETAIL DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention describes a multipurpose epoxy-cast bushing for gas insulated switchgears. As shown in figure 1Α, the bushing is optionally provided with a slot (1). The slot as shown in figure 1Α serves the purpose for the bushing to be used as a gas communicator between the adjacent chambers, in addition to its basic aim of providing insulation. The alternative embodiment of the bushing is shown in figure 2Α. The bushing shown in figure 2Α contains circumferential slots on both sides in the form of O-ring slot. The O-ring slots are used to provide a sealed interface between the chambers and atmosphere. Figure 3 describes as to how the inventive bushing acts as a medium for current transfer. In this case, the current transfer takes place through the gas communicator (3) embedded in the epoxy casting. The clamping arrangement is shown in figure 4. The bushing of figure 4 has metal fasteners (4) embedded in the epoxy casting. The tightening between the bushing and any surface takes through the metal fasteners (4), hence minimizing the compressive stresses on the epoxy body. The construction of the bushing takes into consideration: - the dielectric strength required at the specified locations; - mechanical stability of the bushing so as to use it as a structural support; and - close tolerance and sealing prequisites of the bushing so as to provide a leak proof chamber for gas. 9 Uses: a) The basic purpose of the multipurpose Epoxy Bushing is to ensure sealing between two high voltage chambers of Gas insulated Switchgear (GIS). GIS consists of three high voltage chambers: for example Busbar chamber, Breaker chamber, and Cable Termination chamber. - Busbar chamber includes busbars, Interpanel barriers, droppers, and on load isolators. - Breaker chamber includes the Vacuum Interrupters and the drive mechanism of the chamber. - Cable Termination chamber includes the CT Bushing, and current transfer contacts. b) The multipurpose Epoxy bushing can also be used for sealing between Breaker chamber and Cable Chamber in order to prevent movement of arc in case of any phase-to-earth fault in Breaker Chamber or Cable Chamber. c) Gas communication slots can also be incorporated if same gas pressure is to be maintained between the two adjacent chambers. d) Current transfer takes place from vacuum interrupter to casted Copper through specially designed circular copper component (refer figure 3). The current transfer from Bushing to Cable Chamber is achieved through multilam contact mounted on Copper conductor. Clearances: Phase to earth clearance is very critical and in case of higher rated GIS, bell shape is provided (refer figure 1). The geometry and shape is made to ensure thatrall necessary clearances are achieved between phase to earth. The finish 10 and parallelism are also very critical to reduce contact resistance and to ensure smooth current transfer. Mechanical Strength: Mechanical strength of the bushing is designed in such a manner that all electrical dynamic forces are absorbed by the bushing. It is also ensured that while tightening of fasteners on the Bushing, stresses are not transferred on the bushing. Brass inserts with Μ12 hardware are used for fastening. (Refer figure 4). Inserts are used in top and bottom so that in case of non-communicable design, gas in the breaker chamber does not leak while removing the Bottom Cable Termination Chamber. Prevention of leakage: Leakage of SF6 is prevented by grooves present on the circumference (refer figure 2). The grooves are designed to ensure gas leakage of less than 0.1% by volume per annum. 1.
