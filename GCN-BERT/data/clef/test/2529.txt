Step 3
1-(4,4-Difluoro-cyclohexylmethyl)-3,7-dimethyl-3,7-dihydro-purine-2,6-dione
3,7-Dimethyl-1H-purine-2,6(3H,7H)-dione (78.9 mg, 0.438 mmol) was dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide (100 mL). 4,4-Difluorocyclohexylmethyl methanesulfonate (78.9 mg, 0.438 mmol), potassium carbonate (121 mg, 0.876 mmol) and potassium iodide (87.3 mg, 0.526 mmol) were added. The reaction solution was heated to 120Â°C and stirred for 3 hours, and then concentrated under reduced pressure, the residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (1:1 petroleum ether / ethyl acetate, Rf = 0.3) to give 1-(4,4-difluoro-cyclohexylmethyl)-3,7-dimethyl-3,7-dihydro-purine-2,6-dione (30.0 mg) with a yield of 22%.
