FIELD The present invention concerns the curing and hardening of liquids. In particular, present invention relates to accelerators for curing unsaturated polyester resins, vinyl ester resins, and acrylic resins in conjunction with peroxide type initiators. The accelerators are based on iron/manganese complexes of a tridentate, tetradentate, pentadentate, or hexadentate nitrogen donor ligands. Also disclosed are curable resin compositions including the forgoing accelerators and a curing process for employing these accelerators. These resin compositions show good curing properties and do not contain cobalt accelerators. The present invention further relates to gel coats and molded composites prepared from such unsaturated polyester, vinyl ester, and acrylic resins. BACKGROUND Thermoset resins, including unsaturated polyesters and vinyl esters, are commonly employed in a variety of fabrications, such as casting materials, fiber reinforced materials, and coatings. These resins are typically dissolved in an unsaturated vinyl monomer, like styrene, to facilitate crosslinking (curing) and reduce viscosity. The resin is cured with a peroxide type initiator by means of a free radical co-polymerization mechanism to form a solid article. Accelerators are used to promote the decomposition of peroxides. WO2008003496 discloses a resin composition comprising an unsaturated polyester resin or vinyl ester resin, a manganese compound and a thiol-containing compound and a peroxide compound having formula ROOH, in which R is hydrogen or an optionally substituted alkyl group. WO2008003495 discloses an unsaturated polyester resin composition comprising an unsaturated polyester resin, a manganese compound, a 1,3-dioxo compound and a base; the resin composition being curable with a peroxide.

Thus, there is provided according to this aspect a cured resin obtainable by curing a liquid curable medium according to the first aspect of the invention. Preferably the liquid curable medium comprises less than 0.01 wt % of cobalt wt % based on metal, more preferably less than 0.005, most preferably less than 0.0001 wt %. Ideally the liquid curable medium does not contain cobalt, i.e., the liquid curable medium is cobalt free. DETAILED DESCRIPTION The Resin The liquid curable medium comprises from from about 5 to about 95 wt % of an unsaturated resin. In some embodiments, the liquid curable medium comprises from from about 10 to about 95 wt % of the unsaturated resin. The unsaturated polyester resin or vinyl ester resin as is comprised in the resin may be suitable selected from the unsaturated polyester resin or vinyl ester resin as are well known in the art. The resin comprises a reactive diluent that serves to cross link. Examples of unsaturated polyester resin or vinyl ester resins to be used in resin compositions of the present invention are subdivided in different categories as listed below. (1) Ortho resins: these are based on phthalic anhydride, maleic anhydride, or fumaric acid and glycols, such as ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, 1,2-propylene glycol, 1,3-propylene glycol, dipropylene glycol, tripopylene glycol, neopentyl glycol, or hydrogenated bis-phenol A. Commonly the ones derived from 1,2-propylene glycol are used in combination with a reactive diluent such as styrene.(2) Iso-resins: these are usually prepared from isophthalic acid, maleic anhydride or fumaric acid, and the glycols. These resins may typically contain a higher level of reactive diluent than the ortho-resins.(3) Bisphenol-A-fumarates: these are based on ethoxylated bisphenol-A and fumaric acid.(4) Chlorendics: are resins prepared from chlorine/bromine containing anhydrides or phenols in the preparation of UP resins.(5) Vinyl ester resins: these are resins which are mostly used because of their hydrolytic resistance and excellent mechanical properties, are having unsaturated sites only in the terminal position, introduced by reactions of epoxy resins with (meth)acrylic acid. Typical types of epoxy resins include bisphenol-A, novalac, tetraphenyloethane, cycloaliphatic, tetrabromobisphenol-A, etc. Similar to iso resins and ortho resins are unsaturated polyester resins containing terephthalic acid. Besides these classes of resins also so-called dicyclopentadiene (DCPD) resins can be distinguished as unsaturated polyester resin. As used herein, a vinyl ester resin is a (meth)acrylate functional resin. Also the class of vinyl ester urethane resins (also referred to urethane methacyclate resins) can be distinguished a vinyl ester resins. Preferably, the vinyl ester resin used in the present invention is a resin that is obtained by the esterification of an epoxy resin with a (meth)acrylic acid or a (meth)acrylamide. All of these resins, as can suitably used in the context of the present invention, may be modified according to methods known in the art, e.g. for achieving lower acid number, hydroxyl number or anhydride number, or for becoming more flexible due to insertion of flexible units in the backbone, etc. Also other reactive groups curable by reaction with peroxides may be present in the resins, for instance reactive groups derived from itaconic acid, citraconic acid and allylic groups, etc. Accordingly the unsaturated polyester resins or vinyl ester resins used in the present invention may contain solvents. The solvents may be inert to the resin system or they may be reactive therewith during the curing step. Reactive solvents are particularly preferred. Examples of suitable reactive solvents are styrene, vinyl toluene, divinyl benzene, methyl methacrylate, diallyl phthalate, α-methyl styrene, triallyl cyanurate, (meth)acrylates, N-vinylpyrrolidone, and N-vinylcaprolactam. Mixtures of the reactive solvents, especially with styrene, are also employed. The amount of styrene and/or other reactive diluent may be as large as 60% of the resin composition, but is typically between 25% and 35%. The unsaturated polyester resins and vinyl ester resins as are being used in the context of the present invention may be any type of such resins, but preferably are chosen from the group of DCPD resins, iso-phthalic resins and ortho-phthalic resins and vinyl ester resins or blends thereof. The resin composition according to the invention preferably has an acid value in the range of from 0.001-300 mg KOH/g of resin composition. As used herein, the acid value of the resin composition is determined titrimetrically according to ISO 2114-2000. Preferably the molecular weight of the unsaturated polyester resin is in the range of from 500 to 200.000 g/mol. As used herein the molecular weight of the resin is determined using gel permeation chromatography according to ISO 13885-1. The resin compositions according to the present invention generally contain less than 5 wt % of water. Acrylic resin as is comprised in the resin compositions according to the present invention, may be suitable selected from thermoset acrylic resin or acrylic modified resin as are well known in the art. Examples of acrylic resin or modified acrylic resins to be used in resin compositions of the present invention are listed below. Acrylic resins: based on acrylic monomers that typically contain either acrylate functionality or methacrylate functionality of the general structures: where R can be aromatic or aliphatic, and also contain linear, branched, or cyclic alkanes, ethers, or esters. Acrylic monomers, a.k.a. acrylic ester and methacrylic ester monomers, are typically synthesized from acrylic acid or methacrylic acid and alcohols. In addition to the standard side-chains, special functionality can be added to (meth)acrylic ester monomers by the use of the appropriate functional alcohol. Examples include glycidyl methacrylate, t-butylaminoethyl methacrylate, dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate, 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate, 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate, N-hydroxymethy acrylamide, N-hydroxymethyl methacrylamide, etc., as well as, hydroxy (meth)acrylates made from glycidyl esters of carboxylic acids. Also included with functional monomers are carboxyl types like methacrylic acid, acrylic acid, and itiaconic acid, as well as, multifunctional types like 1,4-butylene dimethacrylate, ethyleneglycol dimethacrylate, 1,6 hexandiol dimethacrylate, diethyleneglycol dimethacrylate, bisphenol-A dimethacrylate, ethoxylated bisphenol-A dimethacrylate, trimethylol propane triacrylate, trimethylol propane methacrylate, ethoxylated trimethylolpropane trimethacrylate etc. Acrylic resins can also use oligomeric acrylates, which are acrylated urethanes, epoxies, polyesters, polyethers, and acrylics. The oligomeric acrylates are formed by reacting acrylate functional monomers with primary or secondary functional groups on the oligomer. The acrylate functional monomers can be added directly to the oligomer or attached to the oligomer using a secondary difunctional monomer. For instance, ureathane acrylate oligomers are formed by reacting polyester or polyether polyol oligomers with diisocyanates (aliphatic or aromatic) and hydroxy (meth)acrylates. Epoxy acrylate oligomers are formed by reacting epoxy resins with carboxyl functional (meth)acrylates. Polyether oligomers can also be reacted with carboxy functional (meth)acrylates to form polyethylene glycol dimethacrylate, as an example. Additionally, acrylic resins can use pre-reacted polymer-in-monomer syrups made by polymerizing an acrylic monomer or co-polymerizing a mixture of different acrylic monomers to a specific degree of polymerization, typically 10-60%. The polymerization is typically carried out at 50-110° C. using a small amount of polymerization initiator and an optional chain transfer agent. The reaction proceeds to a predetermined viscosity, approximation of polymerization degree, and is then cooled to room temperature. Optionally, the reaction is quench cooled by the addition of cold monomer containing a polymerization inhibitor. Acrylic modified resins are broad category of resins that are similar to oligomeric acrylates, with the exception that acrylic modified resins use a base resin of sufficient molecular weight as not to be considered an oligomer. Examples of base resins include polyols, unsaturated polyols, polyesters, unsaturated polyesters, unsaturated dicyclopentadiene-based polyesters, polyisocyantes (chain extended and/or multifunctional), epoxies (Bisphenol-A, novalac, and chain extended) and polyacids, which are typically the products of polyols and polycarboxylic acids or anhydrides. Acrylic modified resins are formed by reacting a base resin's primary and secondary functional groups directly with functional acrylic monomers to create primary and/or secondary (meth)acrylic double bonds on the base resin. Base resin modification with (meth)acrylic double bonds may also be achieved indirectly by initially reacting the resin's primary and/or secondary functional groups with other difunctional or polyfunctional compounds such as isocyanates, acids, or anhydrides. Additionally, Acrylic resins may be further modified by reacting secondary functional groups formed during the initial modification. Methods for the preparation of acrylic modified resins are well known to those skilled in the art. Accordingly acrylic modified resins used in the present invention may contain solvents. The solvents may be inert to the resin system or they may be reactive therewith during the curing step. Reactive solvents are particularly preferred. Acrylic monomers and/or oligomeric acrylates, discussed above, are examples of suitable reactive solvent typically used with acrylic modified resins. Alternately, acrylic monomers can be copolymerized with styrene, vinyl toluene, divinyl benzene, acrylonitrile, vinyl acetate, and vinyl esters of carboxylic acids, etc. in both acrylic and acrylic modified resin. The use of acrylic monomers and/or oligomeric acrylates as reactive diluents for curing or crosslinking further extends the definition of modified acrylic resins to include resins modified by allylic functional groups, where the allylic functionality is introduced to the base resin by allyl glycidyl ether, trimethylol propanediallyl ether, allyl pentaerythritol, and related derivatives. The unsaturated polyester, vinyl ester, and acrylic resin systems described above are cured using peroxide type and azo-type initiators. Initiators are typically dissociated using heat, UV light, or at room temperature with accelerators to form the free radicals required to begin polymerization. Accelerators are usually employed with peroxides, but their use is not limited to ambient curing applications. Not all peroxide initiators can be activated by every accelerator and not all peroxide/accelerator systems are active enough for every resin system. The current state of the art for ambient curing of unsaturated polyester and vinyl ester resins uses peroxides accelerated by the presence of metal compounds, especially cobalt salts as accelerators. Cobalt naphthenate and cobalt octanoate are the most widely used accelerators. The peroxides most commonly used in conjunction with cobalt accelerators are ketone peroxides, hydroperoxides and peresters, specifically with methylethylketone peroxide (MEKP) as the most common type. Modified acrylic resins that contain a significant amount of styrene mixed with acrylate monomers can also be cured with MEKP/cobalt system. The ability to activate many different initiators and be compatible with many resin systems accounts for wide use of cobalt accelerators. However, cobalt accelerators have become undesirable because of their health and environmental hazards. Cobalt accelerators also suffer other technical detriments that include poor reactivity at low temperature (<15° C.), color imparted to the resin, and poor reactivity with acrylic and methacrylic monomers, especially in acrylic resins. Many molding applications take place at ambient temperature. However in winter months, ambient temperature may be significantly lower than 15-40° C., which is the typical operating temperature for ambient curing with cobalt accelerators. At temperatures below 15° C., the reduction in activity of cobalt accelerators is disproportionate to the reduction in temperature rendering them ineffective. Also, cobalt octoate and naphthenate salts are very dark in color. When used as a primary accelerator at a typical concentration of about 0.02% (based on metal), the color form the cobalt accelerator affects the color of the cure gel coat or molded composite. Lower cobalt accelerator levels can be used, but with longer gel and peak exotherm times and lower peak exotherm temperatures. Lastly, unsaturated polyester and vinyl ester resins have been incorporating low volatile acrylic and methacrylic monomers as one way to meet recent government regulations to restrict styrene emissions in open molding facilities. However, the amount of styrene substitution is limited by the poor co-polymerization of most acrylates and methacrylates with maleate and fumarate moieties in the polyester backbone, as well as, the ability of cobalt accelerated MEKP systems to effectively form radicals with acrylic monomers. The latter is especially apparent in acrylic resin systems where cobalt accelerated MEKP systems exhibit little or no reactivity in the absence of styrene. The most common initiator/accelerator system currently practiced with acrylic resin systems is benzoyl peroxide (BPO) with at tertiary amine accelerator; i.e. dimethyl aniline (DMA). However, the BPO is less than ideal because it is a solid powder and the DMA can produce a highly colored gel coat of molded composite. The cured BPO/DMA system also suffers strong discoloration by heat and light. Accordingly, there is substantial need in the unsaturated polyester resin business, and in particular in the field of production of cure gel coats and molded composites as previously defined, for the finding of accelerated or promoted unsaturated polyester resin, vinyl ester resin, and acrylic resin compositions showing good curing properties and having no cobalt content. In particular, there is a need for providing accelerated resin compositions that are curable with liquid peroxides. In particular such curing should take place at ambient temperature and preferably, also at sub-ambient temperatures. Preferably, the accelerator resin compound will produce cured gel coats and molded composites low in color. It was now found, surprisingly, that unsaturated polyester resin, vinyl ester resin, and acrylic resin systems with efficient curing performance when cured with a peroxide could be obtained by using a resin composition comprising an unsaturated polyester resin, vinyl ester resin, or acrylic resin and an accelerator comprising a manganese or iron complex of a tridentate, tetradentate, pentadentate or hexadentate nitrogen donor ligand, e.g. a tetradentate, pentadentate or hexadentate nitrogen donor ligand, as defined below. These iron and manganese complexes function as cobalt-free primary accelerators at low concentrations with surprising technical benefits of reduced color, activity at ambient and sub-ambient temperature, and good curing reactivity in acrylic resins compared to state of the art cobalt accelerators. Primary Accelerator Preferably, the accelerator is present in the resin composition from 0.00001 and 0.02% w/w based on metal, more preferably from 0.00005 and 0.005% w/w based on metal. The level of the primary accelerator may be made up from a mixture of the primary accelerators. The tridentate, tetradentate, pentadentate or hexadentate nitrogen donor ligand, e.g. a tetradentate, pentadentate or hexadentate nitrogen donor ligand, may be built up within any organic structure which will support coordinating nitrogen atoms. For example one can take a basic tridentate ligand such as 1,4,7-triazacyclononane and have further nitrogen co-ordination groups, e.g., —CH2-CH2-NH2, —CH2-Py, covalently bound to one or more of the cyclic nitrogens or aliphatic groups.

The gel time results are shown in Table 1, below: TABLE 1 Gel Time Accelerator (minutes) None >1000 [Fe(N2py3o-C1)Cl]Cl 7.9 [Fe(N2py3o-C8)Cl]Cl 5.1 [Fe(N2py3o-C12)Cl]Cl 4.9 [Fe(N2py3o-C18)Cl]Cl 4.5 [Fe(N2py2-C2H4NMe2)Cl]Cl 45.5 [Fe(MeN4py)Cl]Cl 14.0 [Fe(quinTACN)Cl]ClO4 35.9 [Fe(Metrispicen)Cl]PF6 30.2 [Mn(Bcyclam)]Cl2 37.3 The results in Table 1 show that all six classes of the described iron or manganese complexes of a tetradentate, pentadentate or hexadentate nitrogen donor ligands act as primary accelerators with MEKP. All the accelerators showed good cure properties for gel time in a standard unsaturated polyester resin, especially with 15 gram mass. In general, the Bispidon-type catalysts are the most active accelerators of the group based on the resin/initiator system used in this example. The resin control without accelerator did not gel or cure. All the samples cured to a solidified material with the exception of the unpromoted control. Example 2 Reactivity at Low Concentrations The T707-70 Iso/NPG and 440325-00 Ortho base resins were promoted with 0.5 ppm Fe ([Fe(N2py3o-C1)Cl]Cl) accelerator and then initiated with 1.5% MEKP. The gel time of the promoted resins was determined as in Example 1 using a 15 gram mass. The results are shown in Table 2, below: TABLE 2 Gel Time Resin Accelerator (minutes) T707-70 Iso/NPG 0.5 ppm Fe ([Fe(N2py3o-C1)Cl]Cl) 6.2 44325-00 Ortho 0.5 ppm Fe ([Fe(N2py3o-C1)Cl]Cl) 7.3 The results in Table 2 show that the [Fe(N2py3o-C1)Cl]Cl accelerator produces good cure properties at low concentrations, 0.5 ppm Fe, in typical unsaturated polyester resin systems initiated with MEKP. Both samples cured to a solidified material Example 3 Control of Gel/Cure Times, Comparative Reactivity to Cobalt, Low Concentrations Compared to Cobalt Samples of 6000-T25 vinyl ester base resin was promoted with a range of iron accelerator concentrations using [Fe(N2py3o-C1)Cl]Cl. In another set of experiments, the 6000-T25 vinyl ester resin was promoted with a range of cobalt concentrations using 12% Cobalt Hex-Cem for a comparative reference. All the promoted resin samples were initiated with 1.5% MEKP and the gel time, peak exotherm time, and peak exotherm temperature determined. The results are shown in Table 3 (below): TABLE 3 Peak Peak Exotherm Exotherm Gel Time Time Temp Accelerator (minutes) (minutes) (° C.) 0.4 ppm Fe ([Fe(N2py3o-C1)Cl]Cl) 370.9 463.1 27 0.6 ppm Fe ([Fe(N2py3o-C1)Cl]Cl) 66.0 114.9 31 0.8 ppm Fe ([Fe(N2py3o-C1)Cl]Cl) 32.4 65.8 46 1.1 ppm Fe ([Fe(N2py3o-C1)Cl]Cl) 19.8 43.5 77 1.7 ppm Fe ([Fe(N2py3o-C1)Cl]Cl) 11.9 25.6 127 2.1 ppm Fe ([Fe(N2py3o-C1)Cl]Cl) 10.4 25.3 122 4.3 ppm Fe ([Fe(N2py3o-C1)Cl]Cl) 10.0 28.0 118 10.6 ppm Fe ([Fe(N2py3o-C1)Cl]Cl) 17.7 35.0 145 19.3 ppm Fe ([Fe(N2py3o-C1)Cl]Cl) 24.8 115.0 64 42.2 ppm Fe ([Fe(N2py3o-C1)Cl]Cl) 136.6 517.1 27 10.4 ppm Co (12% Co Hex-Cem) >1000 N.A.

The gel/peak exotherm data represents the entire accelerator concentration range from under promoted to over promoted with vinyl ester resin and using 1.5% MEKP. A concentration of about 2 ppm Fe [Fe(N2py3o-C1)Cl]Cl optimizes the system based on gel time and peak exotherm temperature. The 12% Cobalt Hex-Cem results in Table 3 serve as a comparative benchmark for comparison of the [Fe(N2py3o-C1)Cl]Cl accelerator. In general, the [Fe(N2py3o-C1)Cl]Cl accelerator was significantly more reactive than 12% Cobalt Hex-Cem on a metal concentration basis. 1.7 ppm Fe [Fe(N2py3o-C1)Cl]Cl and 256 ppm Co (12% Cobalt Hex-Cem) produced similar peak exotherm temperatures of 127° C. and 123° C., respectively. Significantly lower concentrations of [Fe(N2py3o-C1)Cl]Cl produced consistently faster gel and peak exotherm times compared to 12% Cobalt Hex-Cem (based on metal). All the samples in both data sets cured to a solidified material with the exception of the sample promoted with 10 ppm cobalt. Example 4 Acryic Resin with acrylate diluent Samples of 91690-00 acrylic base resin were promoted with 0.5 ppm Fe and 20 ppm Fe [Fe(N2py2-C2H4NMe2)Cl]Cl, 0.5 ppm Fe and 20 ppm Fe of [Fe(N2py2-C2H4NMe2)Cl]Cl, 250 ppm Co (12% Cobat Hex-Cem) and 5000 ppm N,N-dimethylaniline (DMA). All the samples were initiated with 1.5% MEKP with the exception of DMA promoted sample, which was initiated with 2.0% BPO. The cobalt and DMA promoted samples were included for comparative references. Gel time and peak exotherm temperature was determined for all the initiated samples. The results are summarized in Table 4 (below): TABLE 4 Peak Gel Time Exotherm Initiator Accelerator (minutes) Temp (° C.) 1.5% MEKP 0.5 ppm Fe 10.2 77 ([Fe(N2py2-C2H4NMe2)Cl]Cl) 1.5% MEKP 20 ppm Fe <0.3 Too fast ([Fe(N2py2-C2H4NMe2)Cl]Cl) 1.5% MEKP 0.5 ppm Fe 53.9 27 ([Fe(N2py3o-C1)Cl]Cl) 1.5% MEKP 20 ppm Fe <0.5 Too fast ([Fe(N2py3o-C1)Cl]Cl) 1.5% MEKP 250 ppm Co >1000 N.A. (12% Cobalt Hex-Cem) 2.0% BPO 5000 ppm DMA 2.4 95 The results in Table 4 show [Fe(N2py2-C2H4NMe2)Cl]Cl and [Fe(N2py3o-C1)Cl]Cl accelerators are reactive in acrylic resins with acrylate reactive diluents when used with a MEKP initiator. [Fe(N2py2-C2H4NMe2)Cl]Cl was more reactive than the [Fe(N2py3o-C1)Cl]Cl based on peak exotherm temperature. Both formulations with 20 ppm Fe gelled before mixing of initiator was completed. Comparatively, the sample promoted with 250 pppm Co and initiated with 1.5% MEKP did not gel or cure. Both the [Fe(N2py2-C2H4NMe2)Cl]Cl/MEKP and [Fe(N2py3o-C1)Cl]Cl/MEKP system showed the potential to be more reactive than a typical DMA/BPO system in acrylic resins. All the samples cured to a solidified material with the exception of the sample promoted with 250 ppm Co. Example 5 Low Temperature The environmental chamber was set to 25° C., 10° C., and 0° C. testing temperatures for the experiments in this example. Triplicate samples of X4545-50 DCPD base resin was promoted with 20 ppm Fe [Fe(N2py3o-C1)Cl]Cl. The 10° C. test temperature sample was let stand at −10° C. before initiation with 1.5% MEKP and placement into the environmental chamber. The 0° C. test temperature sample was let stand at −30° C. before initiation with 1.5% MEKP and placement into the environmental. The lower standing temperatures allowed the resin temperature to closely match the testing temperature after addition and mixing of the initiator. As a comparative reference, triplicate X4545-50 DCPD base resin samples were promoted with 100 ppm Co (12% Cobalt Hex-Cem). The testing protocol was the same as the previous sample set with 1.5% MEKP initiator. A 15 gram mass was used to determine the gel time, peak exotherm time, and peak exotherm temperature. The results are shown in Table 5 (below): TABLE 5 Peak Peak Test Gel Exotherm Exotherm Temp Temp Time Time Temp Difference Accelerator (° C.) (min) (min) (° C.) (Δ ° C.) 20 ppm Fe 25 7.9 17.3 71 46 ([Fe(N2py3o- C1)Cl]Cl) 20 ppm Fe 10 20.8 49.5 20 10 ([Fe(N2py3o- C1)Cl]Cl) 20 ppm Fe 0 36.3 52.5 6 6 ([Fe(N2py3o- C1)Cl]Cl) 100 ppm Co 25 28.5 47.2 77 52 (12% Cobalt Hex-Cem) 100 ppm Co 10 96.5 155.8 14 4 (12% Cobalt Hex-Cem) 100 ppm Co 0 293.7 299.4 2 2 (12% Cobalt Hex-Cem) In general, the results in Table 5 show a strong correlation with test temperature; gel time and peak exotherm time inversely proportional to temperature and peak exotherm temperature and temperature difference directly proportional to temperature. At 25° C., both samples exhibited good gel/cure properties with the [Fe(N2py3o-C1)Cl]Cl promoted sample showing faster gel and peak exotherm times, but the cobalt promoted sample showing a slightly higher exotherm temperature. At sub-ambient temperatures, the samples promoted with 20 ppm Fe ([Fe(N2py3o-C1)Cl]Cl) exhibited significantly better gel/cure properties compared to the samples promoted with 100 ppm Co (12% Cobalt Hex-Cem). At 0° C., gel time of the 20 ppm Fe ([Fe(N2py3o-C1)Cl]Cl) promoted sample was 36.3 minutes compared to 293.7 minutes for the 100 ppm Co (12% Cobalt Hex-Cem) sample. All the samples cured to a solidified material. Example 6 Usage and Lower Colour Samples of all the unsaturated polyester base resins and the vinyl ester base resins were promoted with 20 ppm Fe ([Fe(N2py3o-C1)Cl]Cl) and then initiated with 1.5% MEKP. The gel time, peak exotherm time, and peak exotherm temperature of the promoted resins was determined using a 15 gram mass at 25° C. A separate puck was cast for each promoted resin to determine the relative darkness of the cured resin based on the L* axis (black to white) of the CIE L*a*b* color scale. For a comparative reference, the same base resins were promoted with 250 ppm Co (12% Cobalt Hex-Cem), initiated with 1.5% MEKP, and tested using the same protocols as the initial sample set. The results are shown in Table 6: TABLE 6 Peak Peak CIE Gel Exo Exo L*a*b* Time Time Temp Color Resin Accelerator (min) (min) (° C.)

These results also confirm that significantly lower concentrations of [Fe(N2py3o-C1)Cl]Cl are needed to achieve similar performance compared to cobalt accelerators on a metal basis. The lower [Fe(N2py3o-C1)Cl]Cl accelerator concentration produces an added technical benefit of reduced color in the cured part. A comparison of the L* color values in Table 6 shows castings of resins promoted with 20 ppm Fe ([Fe(N2py3o-C1)Cl]Cl) are significantly lighter in color than the same resins promoted with 250 ppm Co (12% Cobalt Hex-Cem). All the samples and castings cured to a solidified material. Example 7 Confirmation of Primary Accelerator Status Compared to Other Iron Co-Accelerators Gel time tests using X4545-50 DCPD base resin promoted with 20 ppm iron accelerators (based on metal) were initiated with 1.5% MEKP. The same promoted resin samples were used for a second set of experiments initiated with CHP (cumene hydroperoxide) purchased form Sigma Aldrich. The types and manufacturers of the iron accelerators are listed in the table 7a, below.

Example 8 Usage; Process Control with Co-Accelerators Samples of X4545-50 DCPD base resin were promoted with accelerator(s) as shown in Table 8 (below) and then initiated with 1.5% methyl ethyl ketone peroxide (MEKP). Many of the experiments in this example contain mixtures of [Fe(N2py3o-C1)Cl]Cl and co-accelerators, specifically low concentrations of cobalt. One experiment utilizes a mixture of [Fe(N2py3o-C1)Cl]Cl, 12% Cobalt Hex-Cem, dimethylaniline (DMA) and acetylacetone (AA). Also included were reference experiments promoted with only 12% Cobalt Hex-Cem (100 ppm and 10 ppm Co), as well as, a second set of references promoted with only [Fe(N2py3o-C1)Cl]Cl (20 ppm and 0.6 ppm Fe). The gel time and peak exotherm time results are shown in Table 8, below: TABLE 8 Accelerator 12% Peak Cobalt [Fe(N2py3o- Exotherm Hex-Cem C1)Cl]Cl DMA AA Gel Time Time (ppm Co) (ppm Fe) (ppm) (ppm) (minutes) (minutes) 100 — — — 28.5 47.2 10 — — — 313.6 356.4 — 20 — — 7.9 17.3 — 0.6 — — 626.6 No Exotherm 100 20 — — 7.8 16.2 50 0.5 — — 32.3 50.0 5 10 — — 14.0 27.8 5 2 — — 56.6 75.7 5 2 50 50 28.4 45.4 The results in Table 8 show that very similar process conditions of gel time and peak exotherm time can be obtained by using mixtures of [Fe(N2py3o-C1)Cl]Cl and co-accelerators. The experiment promoted with 50 ppm cobalt (12% Cobalt Hex-Cem) and 0.5 ppm iron (Fe(N2py3o-C1)Cl]Cl) showed a 32 minute gel time and 50 minute peak exotherm time compared to a 29 minute gel time and 47 minute peak exotherm time for the reference experiment promoted with 100 ppm cobalt. Another experiment promoted with 100 ppm cobalt and 20 ppm iron (Fe(N2py3o-C1)Cl]Cl) produced a gel time of 7.8 minutes, which was very similar to the gel time of the experiment promoted with 20 ppm iron (Fe(N2py3o-C1)Cl]Cl) alone. However, both of these reference experiments produced gel times much faster than the 29 minutes of the 100 ppm cobalt promoted reference benchmark. An accelerator combination of 5 ppm cobalt with 10 ppm iron (Fe(N2py3o-C1)Cl]Cl) slowed the gel time and peak exotherm time to 14 minutes and 28 minutes, respectively. Further reducing the promotion package to 5 ppm cobalt and 2 ppm iron (Fe(N2py3o-C1)Cl]Cl) produced gel and peak exotherm times of 57 minutes and 76 minutes, respectively, which were to slow compared to the 100 ppm cobalt promoted benchmark. The last example in Table 8 shows the use of a combination of co-accelerators to achieve gel and peak exotherm times comparable to the 100 ppm cobalt promoted experiment. In the last example, the DCPD base resin is promoted with low concentrations of 5 ppm cobalt and 2 ppm iron ([Fe(N2py3o-C1)Cl]Cl) combined with 50 ppm DMA and 50 ppm AA to produce a 28.4 minute gel time and 45.4 peak exotherm time, which is very similar to the 28.5 minute gel time and 47.2 minute peak exotherm time of the 100 ppm cobalt promoted benchmark experiment. Also included are reference experiments promoted with 10 ppm cobalt alone and 0.6 ppm iron (Fe(N2py3o-C1)Cl]Cl) alone that showed gel times of 314 minutes and 627 minutes, respectively. These reference experiments also demonstrate the synergistic effects of the co-accelerator combinations formally presented. All the samples cured to a solidified material. Example 9 Reactivity of [Mn2O3(Me3tacn)2](PF6)2 Samples of X4545-50 DCPD base resin was promoted with 80 ppm accelerator (based on metal) and then initiated with 1.5% methyl ethyl ketone peroxide (MEKP). [Mn2O3(Me3tacn)2](PF6)2 was dissolved in water (1.27% w/w) and this was added to the substrate. A total mass of 15.0 grams was used to determine the gel time of the resin. An unpromoted resin control without accelerator was also included as a control. The gel time of the [Mn2O3(Me3tacn)2](PF6)2 was 215 min (blank did not gel). Another experiment was done by dissolving [Mn2O3(Me3tacn)2](PF6)2 in diethyleneglycol (4.05%) and this was added to the substrate containing cumylhydroperoxide to yield a concentration of 80 ppm (based on metal). The gel time was now 560 min (blank no gel observed). A similar experiment, but now using 20 ppm (based on Mn) of the same manganese compound dissolved in diethyleneglycol and 150 ppm ascorbic acid, gave a gel time of 862 min (blank again no gel observed). The results above show that the manganese catalyst accelerates gel formation of this substrate both with cumylhydroperoxide and with methyl ethyl ketone peroxide. Further, addition of ascorbic to the system allows the level of manganese catalyst to be reduced. 1.
