Synthesis of Intermediate C
Under an Ar atmosphere, 4.47 g of Intermediate B, 1.56 g of a 4-chlorophenylboronic acid, 0.610 g of Pd(PPh3)4, and 4.48 g of K2CO3 were refluxed and stirred in a mixed solution containing 15 mL of water, 20 mL of EtOH, and 100 mL of toluene in a 300-mL three-neck flask while being heated. After the stirred solution was cooled, an organic layer was separated by adding water thereto, and a solvent was evaporated. The residue obtained therefrom was separated and purified by silica gel column chromatography (a mixed solution containing toluene and hexane was used), thereby completing the preparation of 4.31 g (90%) of Intermediate C as a faintly yellow solid. A molecular weight of the prepared Intermediate C was measured to be 479 by MS/FAB.
