Field of the Invention The present invention relates to methods of increasing viability and production of secreted proteins in fed batch eukaryotic cell culture. Background of the Invention Mammalian cell culture is the system of choice for many recombinant protein production processes due to its ability to produce proteins with proper post-translational modifications. With increasing manufacturing demand, a strong motivation exists to improve process efficiency by increasing product yield. Attaining the grams per liter production levels of biotherapeutics in commercial production processes relies upon the optimization of both mammalian cell culture and engineering methods. Inherent in current high density, protein-free mammalian cell cultures is the problem of cell death of which apoptosis can account for up to 80% in a typical fed-batch bioreactor, induced in response to stressors such as nutrient and growth factor deprivation, oxygen depletion, toxin accumulation, and shear stress (Goswami et al., Biotechnol. Bioeng. 62:632-640 (1999)). Apoptosis limits the maximum viable cell density, accelerates the onset of the death phase and potentially decreases heterologous protein yield (Chiang and Sisk, Biotechnol. Bioeng. 91:779-792 (2005); Figueroa et al., Biotechnol. Bioeng. 73:211-222 (2001), Metab. Eng. 5:230-245 (2003), Biotechnol Bioeng. 85:589-600 (2004); Mercille and Massie, Biotechnol. Bioeng. 44:1140-1154 (1994)). Apoptosis is a result of a complex network of signaling pathways initiating from both inside and outside the cell, culminating in the activation of caspases that execute the final stages of cell death. Various methods of apoptosis prevention have been used to maintain cell viability during extended production runs in mammalian cell culture (Arden and Betenbaugh, Trends Biotechnol. 22:174-180 (2004); Vives et al., Metab. Eng. 5:124-132 (2003)). Altering the extracellular environment through media supplementation of growth factors, hydrolysates, and limiting nutrients has led to increased protein production and decreased apoptosis (Burteau et al., In Vitro Cell Dev. Biol. Anim. 39:291-296 (2003); Zhang and Robinson, Cytotechnology 48: 59-74 (2005)). Other researchers have turned to chemical and genetic strategies to inhibit the apoptotic signaling cascade from within the cell (Sauerwald et al., Biotechnol. Bioeng. 77:704-716 (2002), Biotechnol. Bioeng. 81:329-340 (2003)). Researchers have found that over-expression of genes found upregulated in cancer cells can prolong viability in cells grown in bioreactors by preventing apoptosis upstream of caspase activation (Goswami et al., supra; Mastrangelo et al., Trends Biotechnol. 16:88-95 (1998); Meents et al., Biotechnol. Bioeng. 80:706-716 (2002); Tey et al., J Biotechnol. 79:147-159 (2000) and Biotechnol. Bioeng. 68:31-43 (2000)). The anti-apoptotic genes that function in the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway can be divided into three groups, namely 1) those that act early in the pathway, e.g., members of the Bcl-2 family of proteins; 2) those that act mid-pathway to disrupt or inhibit the apoptosome complex, e.g., Aven and 3) those that act late in the pathway, e.g., caspase inhibitors, XIAP. The functionality of the majority of these genes have been studied by over-expressing them in mammalian expression systems, and in some cases the effect of combined over-expression of two or more genes, each derived from a different part of the pathway has been determined. Examples include 1) the additive effect of Bcl-XL and a deletion mutant of XIAP (XIAPΔ) in CHO cells (Figueroa et al., Metab. Eng. 5:230-245 (2003)); 2) E1B-19K and Aven in BHK cells (Nivitchanyong et al., Biotechnol. Bioeng. 98:825-841 (2007)) and 3) Bcl-XL, Aven and XIAPΔ (Sauerwald et al., Biotechnol. Bioeng. 81:329-340 (2003)). One of the major activators of the apoptosis cascade is the protein p53. One mechanism by which p53 activates apoptosis is through up-regulation of a subset of pro-apoptosis proteins including BNIP3 (Yasuda et al., J. Biol. Chem. 273:12415-21 (1998)). Therefore, up-regulation of p53 may be one of the principal factors triggering apoptosis. p53 can be degraded in cells through ubiquitin mediated degradation pathway via MDM2 (murine double minute-2 gene) (Bond et al., Current Cancer Drug Target 5:3-8 (2005)). Thus, over-expression of MDM2 has the potential to lower p53 levels and by extension, inhibit apoptosis. Previously, it was shown that in the presence of stress signals, a CHO cell line over-expressing MDM2 could survive longer in culture compared to wild type CHO in batch culture (Arden et al., Biotechnol. Bioeng. 97:601-614 (2007)). The various approaches described above to increase protein productivity have succeeded to varying degrees. Nevertheless, there is a continuous need to develop methods to increase protein production, especially in large-scale commercial production. Brief Description of the Drawings Figure 1.

Detailed Description As used herein and in the claims, the singular forms "a," "and," and "the" include plural reference unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, reference to "a polypeptide" is a reference to one or more polypeptides and includes equivalents thereof known to those skilled in the art. The term MDM2 as used herein refers to human MDM2 (MDM2 p53 binding protein homolog) having a polypeptide sequence shown in GenBank accession number NP_002383 (SEQ ID NOs: 1 and 2). The term E1B19K as used herein refers to human E1B19K protein, having a polypeptide sequence shown in GenBank accession number NP_004322 (SEQ ID NOs: 5 and 6). The term "apoptoticR genes" as used herein refers to genes encoding proteins that, when over-expressed in a cell, confer increased resistance to cell death when compared to the untransfected cell. Exemplary apoptoticR genes are anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family, including Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, Blc-w or E1B19K, caspase inhibitors, for example the IAP family (inhibitors of apoptosis), including XIAP and XIAPΔ, and other proteins involved in cell cycle regulation, for example p27 and MDM2 (Arden et al., BioProcessing J. March/April 23-28 (2004); Sauerwald et al., Bioprocessing J. Summer 2002, 61-68 (2002); Arden et al., Biotechnol. Bioengineer. 97:601-614, (2007)). Cell death can be measured by methods well known in the art, for example by measuring Viable Cell Density (VCD) and percent (%) viability, and by calculating integrated viable cell density (IVCC). Activation of apoptosis can be measured by measuring caspase activity using well known methods. The term "polypeptide" means a molecule that comprises at least two amino acid residues linked by a peptide bond to form a polypeptide. Small polypeptides of less than 50 amino acids may be referred to as "peptides". Polypeptides may also be referred as "proteins." The term "polynucleotide" means a molecule comprising a chain of nucleotides covalently linked by a sugar-phosphate backbone or other equivalent covalent chemistry. Double and single-stranded DNAs and RNAs are typical examples of polynucleotides. The term "complementary sequence" means a second isolated polynucleotide sequence that is antiparallel to a first isolated polynucleotide sequence and that comprises nucleotides complementary to the nucleotides in the first polynucleotide sequence. Typically, such "complementary sequences" are capable of forming a double-stranded polynucleotide molecule such as double-stranded DNA or double-stranded RNA when combined under appropriate conditions with the first isolated polynucleotide sequence. The term "vector" means a polynucleotide capable of being duplicated within a biological system or that can be moved between such systems. Vector polynucleotides typically contain elements, such as origins of replication, polyadenylation signal or selection markers, that function to facilitate the duplication or maintenance of these polynucleotides in a biological system. Examples of such biological systems may include a cell, virus, animal, plant, and reconstituted biological systems utilizing biological components capable of duplicating a vector. The polynucleotides comprising a vector may be DNA or RNA molecules or hybrids of these. The term "expression vector" means a vector that can be utilized in a biological system or a reconstituted biological system to direct the translation of a polypeptide encoded by a polynucleotide sequence present in the expression vector. As used herein, the term "fed batch cell culture" means a cell culture process which is based on feeding of a growth limiting nutrient substrate to the culture. The fed batch strategy is typically used in bio-industrial processes to reach a high cell density in a bioreactor. Numerous strategies have been devised to improve viability and ultimately productivity of fed batch cell cultures. In the present invention, an alternative approach is described, whereby a combination of apoptoticR genes are over-expressed in a host cell. An uxpectedly high increase in the production of secreted proteins was demonstrated by cells engineered to over-express both MDM2 and E1B19K in the light of published results describing that expression of MDM-2 alone increased productivity by maximum of 2-fold (Arden et al., Biotechn. Bioengin. 97:601-614, 2007), and expression of E1B19K, although inhibiting apoptosis and improving cell yields, did not increase production of secreted proteins in a cell (WO2007/124106A2 of Betenbaugh). Further, cell lines generated during the studies described in the Examples below that over-expressed E1B19K only had less than optimal growth properties and low expression levels. Thus, the present invention demonstrated a significant benefit for production of secreted proteins in mammalian cells by co-expressing MDM2 and E1B19K. The present invention also describes a non-naturally occurring mutant MDM2, which is useful in the methods of the invention. One embodiment of the disclosure is a method if increasing cell viability in a fed batch mammalian cell culture, comprising culturing a mammalian cell line over-expressing one or more apoptoticR genes and evaluating cell viability. The methods of the invention are useful for increasing viability in mammalian fed batch cell culture, such as Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell culture, myeloma or hybridoma cell culture. In particular, the methods of the invention are useful for increasing the integrated viable cell count (IVCC) of CHO cell cultures. The cell lines useful in the method of the invention express one or more apoptosisR genes. In particular, the genes encoding MDM2 (SEQ ID NOs 1 and 2), MDM2D300A (SEQ ID NOs 3 and 4), E1B19K (SEQ ID NOs: 5 and 6), Aven (SEQ ID NOs: 7 and 8), Bcl-LX (SEQ ID NO:s 9 and 10), Bcl-2Δ (SE ID NO: 11 and 12), and XIAPΔ (SEQ ID NOs: 13 and 14) can be used. Expression of the apoptosisR genes can be achieved by transfection techniques known to those skilled in the art. The cell lines generated are superior hosts for the development of production cell lines expressing proteins of interest such as peptides, peptide fusions, growth factors, hormones, antibodies, designed ankyrin repeat proteins (DARPins) and other polypeptides useful for therapeutic, diagnostic or research purposes. CHO cell lines useful in the method of the invention include CHO-K1 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and CHOK1SV (Lonza Biologics, Slough, UK). Myeloma lines useful in the method of the invention include NS0 and Sp2/0. In the present invention, the use of cell lines over-expressing apoptosisR genes allows these cell lines to reach IVCC values about two-fold higher than control cell, increase longevity of fed batch cultures up to 7 days, and improve production of secreted proteins by 2-7 fold. Such improved production is significant and can result in lower production costs for complex biologics and at the same time, generate product of superior quality due to the absence of cell lysis of the non-viable cells, as lysed cells release proteases that degrade product. Accordingly, these lines are superior hosts for the development of production cell lines expressing a protein or proteins of interest. For example, a CHO cell line over-expressing MDM2D300A reached 2-fold increased IVCC values and survived 7 days longer in culture when compared to control cell line. Another embodiment of the disclosure is a method of increasing production of a secreted protein in a CHO fed batch cell culture, comprising culturing a CHO cell line over-expressing at least one apoptoticR genes and one or more genes encoding the secreted protein, and measuring the titer of the secreted protein. Particulary useful cell lines in the methods of the invention are CHO cell lines over-expressing MDM2 and E1B19K, an a cell line over-expressing MDM2D300A alone. Use of these cell lines in the methods of the invention resulted in 5- to 7-fold increased titers of secreted proteins in fed batch culture of up to 21 days. Over-expression of proteins in a cell can be achieved by well known methods, either transiently or by stable expression (Davis et al., Basic Methods in Molecular Biology, 2nd ed., Appleton & Lange, Norwalk, CT, 1994; Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 3rd ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY, 2001). The present disclosure also provides isolated mutant MDM2 polynucleotides, vectors comprising these polynucleotides, isolated host cells, polypeptides obtainable from expression of these polynucleotides, methods for expressing the polypeptides of the invention, and methods of using the polynucleotides and polypeptides of the invention. The compositions and methods of the disclosure can be used for a variety of specific applications. The polynucleotides and vectors of the disclosure are useful because they encode mutant MDM2 polypeptides and can be used to express these polypeptides. The mutant MDM2 polypeptides are useful as they can be used to improve cell viability and increase production of secreted proteins in the cell when they are recombinantly overexpressed or introduced by other means into a host animal or tissue. One aspect of the disclosure is an isolated polynucleotide comprising a polynucleotide having the sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 3 or a complementary sequence thereof. The polynucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 3 encodes a polypeptide comprising the mutant human MDM2D300A. In the MDM2D300A, a putative caspase cleavage site (AspValProAspCysLysLys) identified in the wild type MDM2 was destroyed to confer MDM2 more resistant to degradation, and further increase MDM2 levels in the cell during culture. The polynucleotides of the disclosure may be produced by chemical synthesis such as solid phase polynucleotide synthesis on an automated polynucleotide synthesizer. Alternatively, the polynucleotides of the disclosure may be produced by other techniques such as PCR based duplication, vector based duplication, or restriction enzyme based DNA manipulation techniques. Techniques for producing or obtaining polynucleotides of a given known sequence are well known in the art. The polynucleotides of the disclosure may also comprise at least one non-coding sequence, such as transcribed but not translated sequences, termination signals, ribosome binding sites, mRNA stabilizing sequences, introns and polyadenylation signals. The polynucleotide sequences may also comprise additional sequences encoding additional amino acids. These additional polynucleotide sequences may, for example, encode a marker or tag sequence such as a hexa-histidine peptide (Gentz et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (USA) 86:821-284 (1989) or the HA peptide tag (Wilson et al., Cell 37:767-778 (1984)) which facilitate the purification of fused polypeptides. Another embodiment of the disclosure is a vector comprising an isolated polynucleotide having a sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 3. The vectors of the disclosure are useful for maintaining polynucleotides, duplicating polynucleotides, or driving expression of a polypeptide encoded by a vector of the disclosure in biological systems, including reconstituted biological systems. Vectors may be chromosomal-, episomal- and virus-derived such as vectors derived from bacterial plasmids, bacteriophages, transposons, yeast episomes, insertion elements, yeast chromosomal elements, baculoviruses, papova viruses such as SV40, vaccinia viruses, adenoviruses, fowl pox viruses, pseudorabies viruses, picornaviruses and retroviruses and vectors derived from combinations thereof, such as cosmids and phagemids. The vectors of the disclosure can be formulated in microparticles, with adjuvants, lipid, buffer or other excipients as appropriate for a particular application. In one embodiment of the disclosure the vector is an expression vector. Expression vectors typically comprise nucleic acid sequence elements that can control, regulate, cause or permit expression of a polypeptide encoded by such a vector. Such elements may comprise transcriptional enhancer binding sites, RNA polymerase initiation sites, ribosome binding sites, and other sites that facilitate the expression of encoded polypeptides in a given expression system. Such expression systems may be cell-based, or cell-free systems well known in the art. Nucleic acid sequence elements and parent vector sequences suitable for use in the expression of encoded polypeptides are also well known in the art. An exemplary plasmid-derived expression vector useful for expression of the polypeptides of the disclosure comprises an E. coli origin of replication, an aph(3')-la kanamycin resistance gene, HCMV immediate early promoter with intron A, a synthetic polyA sequence and a bovine growth hormone terminator. Another exemplary plasmid derived expression vector comprises an E. coli origin of replication, an ant(4')-1a kanamycin resistance gene, Rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat sequences, HCMV immediate early promoter and an SV40 late polyA sequence. Another embodiment of the disclosure is an isolated host cell comprising a vector of the disclosure. Representative host cell examples include Archaea cells; bacterial cells such as Streptococci, Staphylococci, Enterococci, E. coli, Streptomyces, cyanobacteria, B. subtilis and S. aureus; fungal cells such as Kluveromyces, Saccharomyces, Basidomycete, Candida albicans or Aspergillus; insect cells such as Drosophila S2 and Spodoptera Sf9; animal cells such as CHO, COS, HeLa, C127, 3T3, BHK, 293, CV-1, Bowes melanoma and myeloma; and plant cells, such as gymnosperm or angiosperm cells. The host cells in the methods of the invention may be provided as individual cells, or populations of cells. Populations of cells may comprise an isolated or cultured population of cells or cells present in a matrix such as a tissue. Introduction of a polynucleotide, such as a vector, into a host cell can be effected by methods well known to those skilled in the art (Davis et al., Basic Methods in Molecular Biology, 2nd ed., Appleton & Lange, Norwalk, CT, 1994; Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 3rd ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY, 2001). These methods include calcium phosphate transfection, DEAE-Dextran mediated transfection, microinjection, cationic lipid-mediated transfection, electroporation, transduction, scrape loading, ballistic introduction and infection. Another embodiment of the disclosure is an isolated polypeptide comprising a polypeptide having a sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 4. SEQ ID NO: 4 is a polypeptide comprising variant human MDM2 protein with a D300A substitution. The polypeptides of the disclosure may be produced by chemical synthesis, such as solid phase peptide synthesis, on an automated peptide synthesizer. Alternatively, the polypeptides of the disclosure can be obtained from polynucleotides encoding these polypeptides by the use of cell-free expression systems such as reticulocyte lysate based expression systems, wheat germ extract based expression systems, and Escherichia coli extract based expression systems. The polypeptides of the disclosure can also be obtained by expression and isolation from cells harboring a nucleic acid sequence of the disclosure by techniques well known in the art, such as recombinant expression of easily isolated affinity labeled polypeptides. Those skilled in the art will recognize other techniques for obtaining the polypeptides of the disclosure. The polypeptides of the disclosure may comprise fusion polypeptides comprising a polypeptide of the disclosure fused with a second polypeptide. Such second polypeptides may be leader or secretory signal sequences, a pre- or pro-or prepro-protein sequence, as well as naturally occurring, or partially synthetic sequences derived in part from a naturally occurring sequence or an entirely synthetic sequence. Another embodiment of the disclosure is a method for expressing a polypeptide comprising the steps of providing a host cell of the disclosure; culturing the host cell under conditions sufficient for the expression of at least one polypeptide comprising the sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 4. Host cells can be cultured under any conditions suitable for maintaining or propagating a given type of host cell and sufficient for expressing a polypeptide. Culture conditions, media, and related methods sufficient for the expression of polypeptides are well known in the art. For example, many mammalian cell types can be aerobically cultured at 37°C using appropriately buffered DMEM media while bacterial, yeast and other cell types may be cultured at 37°C under appropriate atmospheric conditions in LB media. In the methods of the invention the expression of a polypeptide can be confirmed using a variety of different techniques well known in the art. For example, expression of MDM2A300D can be confirmed by Western blot or assaying ability of MDM2A300D to inhibit caspases. The present invention will now be described with reference to the following specific, non-limiting examples. Examples In the following Examples, CHO cell lines over-expressing apoptoticR genes were analyzed in shake flask cultures for peak viable cell density, longevity, caspase 3/7 activation, and improved production of secreted proteins. Materials and Methods: Cell culture: CHOK1SV cell line (Lonza Biologics, Slough, UK), designated as the Control cell line C1013A, and CHOK1 (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, USA), designated as the Control cell line C1835 were cultured in CD-CHO medium (Cat. No. 10743-011, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), containing 30 mM Glucose and supplemented with 6mM L-Glutamine (Invitrogen Cat. No. 10313-021). In some instances, another animal protein-free medium containing various concentrations including 60mM glucose (defined as the high glucose medium) was used. Fetal Bovine serum was purchased from Hyclone Labs, Logan, UT (Cat. No. SH30071.03). Cell cultures were monitored by a Cedex automated cell counting instrument (Innovatis, Germany). Integrated viable cell count (IVCC, cell-day/ml) was calculated using the following formula: IVCCd⁢1=VCDd⁢0+VCDd⁢1/2+VCDd⁢0, where VCD = viable cell density Expression vectors: Coding sequence of Bcl-2Δ (SEQ ID NO: 11) was cloned under the CMV promoter into the pCDNA™3.1(+) vector having Neo®. Coding sequence of Bcl-XL (SEQ ID NO: 9) was cloned under the CMV promoter into the pCDNA™3.1(+) vector having Zeo®. Coding sequence of MDM2 (SEQ ID NO: 3) was cloned under the CMV promoter into the pCDNA™3.1(+) vector having Neo®. pBUDCE4.1 vector designed to constitutively express E1B-19K (EF-la promoter), either alone or in conjunction with Aven (CMV promoter) has been described (Nivitchanyong et al., Biotechnol. Bioeng. 98:825-841 (2007)). The vector expressing XIAPΔ (CMV promoter) has been described (Sauerwald et al., Biotechnol. Bioeng. 77:704-716 (2002)). MDM2D300A expression vector was generated by in vitro mutagenesis from the MDM2 expression vector. A model antibody (Ab #1) expression vector was constructed by cloning a heavy and a light chain cDNA into a Glutamine Synthase (GS) expression vector (obtained from Lonza Biologics, Slough, UK, under a research license). Generation of apoptotic R cell lines: An exponential culture of CHOK1SV cell line was transfected with various combinations of expression vectors as shown in Table 1. Transfectomas were selected using a combination of 400 µg/ml hygromycin, 400 µg/ml genticin, or 300 µg/ml Zeocin. About 200 resulting transfectomas were expanded into 24-well plate and caspase 3/7 activity determined by APO-ONE assay (Promega, Madison, WI). Two measurements were performed; a) early in growth phase (~day 3 post-seeding) following treatment with Staurosporine to induce apoptosis; and b) late in growth phase (~day 10 post-seeding), at which time, a subset of wild-type cells has progressed into apoptosis. Transfectomas that had reduced caspase 3/7 activities in both cases were further expanded and top two to four clones were subjected to shake-flask batch growth profile studies. Promising cell lines were cryopreserved. Shake-flask cultures of selected lines were tested for reduced caspase 3 activity by FLOW, using fluorescent-labeled antibodies specific for caspase 3 (BD Bioscience; Cat. #68652X/550557). Selected cell lines were C-coded and submitted for cell banking. These cell lines underwent ten to 15 passage stability testing in the absence of antibiotics, which were used as selection agents. The cell lines generated are shown in Table 1. Expression of each transgene was confirmed in a select set of cell lines by Western blot.

CD-CHO medium is formulated with 30 mM glucose. Additionally, select Ab-expressing cell lines were cultured in a custom formulated animal protein-free medium supplemented with 6mM glutamine and 60mM glucose. Caspase 3/7 activity Assay: About 3x105 cells of each clone were seeded in one ml of growth medium in a 24-well plate. On day 4 (d4) post seeding, about 1x105 cells were transferred in triplicate to a 96well plate. Staurosprine (2µM fc) was added and the cells were incubated for 16h before assaying for caspase3/7 activity by APO-ONE kit (BD Labs). The procedure was repeated on d10, except that Staurosporine was omitted. The clones that had significantly lower caspase3/7 activity on both days were expanded into shake flasks. The apoptoticR nature of the selected clones was confirmed by flow cytometry analysis (see below). Analysis of apoptotic R clones by flow cytometry: About 1x106 cells from exponential cultures were withdrawn from each shake flask into 24well plates, incubated with Staurosporine (2µM fc) for 16h, harvested and washed once in PBS. The cells were then incubated with CytoPerm (Cat. No. 2075KK, BD BioScience) to fix and permeablized them. Following a PBS wash, cells were incubated with FITC-labeled anti-caspase3 (Cat. No. 68654, BD BioScience) antibody before subjecting them to analysis by flow cytometry. Example 1 Effect of MDM2 on Bcl-2Δ expressing cell lines Growth profiles (SF/Batch) of BMX-13 and BMX-39, expressing Bcl-2Δ, MDM2 and XIAPΔ, as well as double transfected cell line BX-61 expressing Bcl-2Δ and XIAPΔ, B-31 expressing Bcl-2Δ alone, and the control C1013A were analyzed. The peak viable cell count (VCD) of the control cell line reached 6x10e6 cellsm/ml whereas those of BMX clones reached about 11x10e6 cells/ml. Cell lines expressing Bcl-2Δ and/or XIAPΔ had intermediate VCD (Figure 1A). BMX clones had higher integrated viable cell count (IVCC) compared to B-31 or BX-61. BMX-39 had a 44% increase in IVCC over control as compared to 23% for B-31. XIAPΔ had no incremental effect on IVCC when used in conjunction with Bcl-2Δ (Figure 1B). High IVCC correlates with high viability of cells in the long term culture in a bioreactor, resulting in increased product yields. Further, biopharmaceuticals generated from a production cell line derived from an apoptoticR host cell line may be of superior quality. Cell lines BMX-13 and BMX-39 demonstrated caspase 3/7 downregulation by 10-fold and 16-fold, respectively when compared to the control C1013A, confirming anti-apoptotic effect of the genes in the CHO cell line. B-31 and BX-61 had had 12- and 6-fold downregulation of caspases. Example 2 Effect of MDM2 on Bcl-XL expressing cell lines Growth profiles of triple transfected BxMX-01, BxMX11 and BxMX-25, expressing Bcl-XL, MDM2 and XIAPΔ in comparison to Bx-51 expressing Bcl-XL alone as well as the control cell line C1013 were evaluated. The peak viable cell count (VCD) of control cell line reached 6x10e6 cells/ml whereas those of BxMX clones reached about 12x10e6 cells/ml (Figure 2A). Cell lines expressing Bcl-XL only had intermediate VCD. For example, the peak VCD of cell line Bx-51 was 10x10e6 cells/ml. BxMX clones had higher IVCC compared to Bx-51 with 34% increase in IVCC over control as compared to 18% for Bx-51 (Figure 2B). Co-transfection of Bcl-XL and MDM2 only (without XIAPΔ) failed to generate cell lines with higher VCD or extended longevity (data not shown). Thus, XIAPΔ and MDM2 are likely to function synergistically towards achieving the high IVCC observed in BxMX-01, BxMX-11 and BxMX-25 cell lines. Caspase 3/7 activity was downregulated 7- , 5-, and 8-fold in BxMX-01, BxMx-11 and BxMX-25, respectively, as compared to control C1013A. Example 3 Effect of MDM2 on E1B19K expressing cell lines Growth profiles of EM-15 and EM-70 expressing E1B19K and MDM2 are shown in Figure 3. For comparison, in a separate experiment, cell lines expressing E1B19K and AVEN (EA-167), or expressing E1B19K, AVEN and XIAPΔ (EAX-197) as well as the transfection host cell line, C1013A were included. The peak viable cell density (VCD) of control cell line reached 6x10e6 cells/ml whereas those of EM clones reached about 12x10e6 cells/ml to 16x10e6 cells/ml. The maximum VCD for EA-167 and EAX-197 was 13.6 - 13.9x10e6 cells/ml. The EM clones had higher IVCC compared to EA-167 or EAX-197. EM-70 had a 100% increase in IVCC over control as compared to 23% increase over control for EA-167. This data, along with the fact that cell lines expressing E1B19K alone were not sufficient for achieving the high IVCC observed in this experiment (Nivitchanyong et al., Biotechnol Bioeng 98:825-841 (2007)) suggests that MDM2 contributed to the increase in IVCC observed in EM-15 and EM-70 cell lines. Co-transfection of E1B19K, MDM2 and XIAPΔ failed to generate cell lines with higher VCD or IVCC as compared to (data not shown). Caspase 3/7 activity in EM-15 and EM-70 cell lines were 13% and 30%, respectively, from the control C1013A. For comparison, EA-167and EAX-197 had 37% and 20% of caspase 3/7 activity as that of C1013A control. Apoptosis was also confirmed by FLOW as described above. 91% of control cells were positive for caspase 3/7 whereas 1 - 30% of cells within cell lines expressing apoptototicR genes were caspase 3/7 positive. Cell lines with the lowest caspase 3/7 activity (eg. B-31) did not necessarily have the highest IVCC. Example 4 Cloning and expression of mutant MDM2 The vector expressing wild-type human MDM2 full-length cDNA (Genbank Accession M92424.1) was obtained from John Hopkins University. The MDM2D300A expression vector was generated by in vitro mutagenesis with a mutagenesis primer 5' gctgaagagggcttt gatgtgccggcttgt aaaaaaactatagtg 3' (SEQ ID NO: 15, resulting in a replacement of A at position 899 with C, and in substitution of Aspartic acid for Alanine in the predicted MDM2D300A protein. The mutagenesis was confirmed by sequencing. The MDM2D300A DNA sequence is shown in SEQ ID NO: 3 and the predicted MDM2D300A protein sequence is shown in SEQ ID NO: 4. This new mutant vector as well as its wild-type counterpart was used for transient and stable transfections. The MDM2300A and MDM2 wild type proteins were transiently expressed in Hek293 cells. Western blot demonstrated presence of higher levels of MDM2D300A in the cells when compared to the wild type MDM2, suggesting the mutant protein was more resistant to proteolytic degradation than the wild type MDM2. Example 5 Generation of MDM2 D300A -expressing cell lines Stable cell lines over-expressing MDM2D300A or WT MDM2 proteins were generated as described in Example 1. Two host cell lines, C1013A and C1835A were used. The list of cell lines used in growth profile studies is shown in Table 2.

Using Centocor proprietary protein-free medium, the peak viable cell density (VCD) of C1013A control cell line was 8x106cells/ml, and that of the C1835A control cell line was 5x106 cells/mL. Cell lines over-expressing MDM2D300A had increased longevity as compared to the control cell lines. In fed-batch cultures, B1 and B5 cell lines were maintained in culture for up to 20 days, whereas the untransfected host cell as well as the cells derived from bulk selected pool following transfection with MDM2D300A lost viability by day 14 of the culture (Figure 5). Example 7 Stability of the CHO cell lines over-expressing MDM2 The C1013A-derived and C1835A-derived CHO cell lines D6 and B5 over-expressing MDM2D300A were subjected to a 15-passage stability study, with and without the selection agent, geniticin. A growth curve study was conducted at the beginning and the end of the stability study for each cell line and peak viable cell density (indicative of cell line stability) was noted. The cultures without geneticin selection and at higher passages had equivalent or higher VCD's and thus can be considered to very stable in the absence of the selection reagent (Table 3).

The cell line, A4, over-expressing MDM2 and B1, over-expressing MDM2D300A were transfected with a recombinant antibody heavy and light chain expression vector. The transfection mixture was first bulk selected using glutamine-free media containing Glutamine Synthetase supplements and 25 µM MSX. Subsequently, the mixture was plated in methocult for isolation of individual clones. About 100 resulting transfectomas per transfection were expanded into 24-well plate and a 14-day spent titer was measured by nephelometry. The average titers for the MDM2 and MDM2D300A cell lines expressing CNTO328 were 90 mg/L, and significantly higher than that of clones derived from C1013A, which was 21.3 mg/L. In a separate experiment, CHOK1SV cells were transfected with MDM2 and E1B19K and one clone, EM70 stably expressing E1B19K and MDM2 was transfected with a recombinant heavy and light chain antibody expression vector (Dorai et al., Biotechnol. Bioeng., 103:592-608 (2009). The transfection mixture was first bulk selected using glutamine-free media containing Glutamine Synthetase supplements and 25uM MSX. For comparison, several other cell lines including C1013A (control), C1013M, C1013J, C1013K, A4, B5, BMX13. Following bulk selection for 29days, the surviving cells were subjected to a shake-flask fed-batch study. EM70 provided antibody titers of >700 mg/L on d23 whereas the titers of the remaining cell lines did not exceed 100 mg/L (Figure 6). An exponential culture of CHOK1SV was transfeced with vectors expressing E1B19K and MDM2. Two days later antibiotic selection protocol was initiated. By day 29, all untransfected cells were eliminated whereas the antibiotic resistant cells (transfected pool) had survived. These cells were used for performing a shake-flask fed-batch growth profile study. 2e5cells/ml was seeded in Mach-1 medium containing supplements. Starting day-2, the cultures were fed daily a nutrient mix of glucose and amino acids. Cell counts and titer was measured daily.
