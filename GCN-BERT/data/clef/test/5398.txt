Step 2: 2-(((tert-Butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)methyl)-8-chloro-1-(2,6-dichlorophenyl)-5-(3,4-dihydroxybutyl)-1,6-naphthyridin-4(1H)-one
Osmium tetroxide (2.5 wt % solution in tert-butanol, 0.133 ml, 10.59 mmol) was added to a solution of 5-(but-3-en-1-yl)-2-(((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)methyl)-8-chloro-1-(2,6-dichlorophenyl)-1,6-naphthyridin-4(1H)-one (0.111 g, 0.212 mmol) and N-methylmorpholine N-oxide (0.027 g, 0.233 mmol) in the mixture of tert-butanol/water (2 ml/2 ml). The resulting mixture was stirred at room temperature for 4 hours. The product was separated between EtOAc and brine and combined organic extracts were dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by silica gel chromatography (0-100% EtOAc in heptane) to give the title compound (0.077 g, 65% yield).
