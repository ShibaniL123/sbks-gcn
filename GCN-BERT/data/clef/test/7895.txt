Tin compounds are useful as catalysts for the condensation cure of many polyorganosiloxane compositions, including adhesives, sealants, and low permeability products such as those useful in insulating glass applications, coatings, and silicone elastomer latices. Organotin compounds for condensation reaction catalysis are those where the valence of the tin is either +4 or +2, i.e., Tin (IV) compounds or Tin (II) compounds. Examples of tin (IV) compounds include stannic salts of carboxylic acids such as dibutyl tin dilaurate, dimethyl tin dilaurate, di-(n-butyl)tin bis-ketonate, dibutyl tin diacetate, dibutyl tin maleate, dibutyl tin diacetylacetonate, dibutyl tin dimethoxide, carbomethoxyphenyl tin tris-uberate, dibutyl tin dioctanoate, dibutyl tin diformate, isobutyl tin triceroate, dimethyl tin dibutyrate, dimethyl tin di-neodeconoate, dibutyl tin di-neodeconoate, triethyl tin tartrate, dibutyl tin dibenzoate, butyltintri-2-ethylhexanoate, dioctyl tin diacetate, tin octylate, tin oleate, tin butyrate, tin naphthenate, dimethyl tin dichloride, a combination thereof, and/or a partial hydrolysis product thereof. Tin (IV) compounds are known in the art and are commercially available, such as Metatin® 740 and Fascat® 4202 from Acima Specialty Chemicals of Switzerland, Europe, which is a business unit of The Dow Chemical Company. Examples of tin (II) compounds include tin (II) salts of organic carboxylic acids such as tin (II) diacetate, tin (II) dioctanoate, tin (II) diethylhexanoate, tin (II) dilaurate, stannous salts of carboxylic acids such as stannous octoate, stannous oleate, stannous acetate, stannous laurate, stannous stearate, stannous naphthanate, stannous hexanoate, stannous succinate, stannous caprylate, and a combination thereof. REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemical) is European Union legislation aimed to help protect human health and the environment and to improve capabilities and competitiveness through the chemical industry. Due to this legislation, tin based catalysts, which are used in many condensation reaction curable polyorganosiloxane products such as sealants and coatings, are to be phased out. Therefore, there is an industry need to replace conventional tin catalysts in condensation reaction curable compositions.

For example, ingredient (B) may have formula (II): R1R22SiO—(R22SiO)e′—SiR22R1, where R1 and R2 are as described above and subscript e′ is an integer having a value sufficient to give the polydiorganosiloxane of formula (II) the viscosity described above. Alternatively, subscript e′ may have a value ranging from 1 to 200,000, alternatively 50 to 1,000, and alternatively 200 to 700. Alternatively, ingredient (B) may comprise a hydroxyl-functional polydiorganosiloxane of formula (II) described above, in which each R1 may be a hydroxyl group, each R2 may be an alkyl group such as methyl, and subscript e′ may have a value such that the hydroxyl functional polydiorganosiloxane has a viscosity of at least 100 mPa·s at 25° C. Alternatively, subscript e′ may have a value ranging from 50 to 700. Exemplary hydroxyl-endblocked polydiorganosiloxanes are hydroxyl-endblocked polydimethylsiloxanes. Hydroxyl-endblocked polydiorganosiloxanes suitable for use as ingredient (B) may be prepared by methods known in the art, such as hydrolysis and condensation of the corresponding organohalosilanes or equilibration of cyclic polydiorganosiloxanes. Alternatively, ingredient (B) may comprise an alkoxysilylhydrocarbylene-endblocked polydiorganosiloxane, for example, when in formula (I) above each R3 is divalent hydrocarbon group or a combination of a divalent hydrocarbon group and a divalent siloxane group. Each R3 may be an alkylene group such as ethylene, propylene, or hexylene; an arylene group such as phenylene, or an alkylarylene group such as: Alternatively, each R1 and each R2 may be alkyl, each R3 may be alkylene such as ethylene, and each subscript d may be 3. Alkoxysilylhydrocarbylene-endblocked polydiorganosiloxanes may be prepared by reacting a vinyl-terminated, polydimethylsiloxane with (alkoxysilylhydrocarbyl)tetramethyldisiloxane. Alternatively, ingredient (B) may comprise a moisture-curable, silane-functional, organic polymer. Alternatively, the organic polymer may be a polymer in which at least half the atoms in the polymer backbone are carbon atoms with terminal moisture curable silyl groups containing hydrolyzable substituents bonded to silicon atoms. The organic polymer can, for example, be selected from hydrocarbon polymers, polyethers, acrylate polymers, polyurethanes and polyureas. Ingredient (B) may be elastomeric, i.e., have a glass transition temperature (Tg) less than 0° C. When ingredient (B) is elastomeric, ingredient (B) may be distinguished, based on the Tg, from semi-crystalline and amorphous polyolef ins (e.g., alpha-olefins), commonly referred to as thermoplastic polymers. Ingredient (B) may comprise a silylated poly(alpha-olefin), a silylated copolymer of an iso-mono-olefin and a vinyl aromatic monomer, a silylated copolymer of a diene and a vinyl aromatic monomer, a silylated copolymer of an olefin and a diene (e.g., a silylated butyl rubber prepared from polyisobutylene and isoprene, which may optionally be halogenated), or a combination thereof (silylated copolymers), a silylated homopolymer of the iso-mono-olefin, a silylated homopolymer of the vinyl aromatic monomer, a silylated homopolymer of the diene (e.g., silylated polybutadiene or silylated hydrogenated polybutadiene), or a combination thereof (silylated homopolymers) or a combination silylated copolymers and silylated homopolymers. For purposes of this application, silylated copolymers and silylated homopolymers are referred to collectively as ‘silylated polymers’. The silylated polymer may optionally contain one or more halogen groups, particularly bromine groups, covalently bonded to an atom of the silylated polymer. Examples of suitable mono-iso-olefins include, but are not limited to, isoalkylenes such as isobutylene, isopentylene, isohexylene, and isoheptylene; alternatively isobutylene. Examples of suitable vinyl aromatic monomers include but are not limited to alkylstyrenes such as alpha-methylstyrene, t-butylstyrene, and para-methylstyrene; alternatively para-methylstyrene. Examples of suitable alkyl groups include methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, and t-butyl; alternatively methyl. Examples of suitable alkenyl groups include, vinyl, allyl, propenyl, butenyl, and hexenyl; alternatively vinyl. The silylated organic polymer may have Mn ranging from 20,000 to 500,000, alternatively 50,000-200,000, alternatively 20,000 to 100,000, alternatively 25,000 to 50,000, and alternatively 28,000 to 35,000; where values of Mn are expressed in grams per mole (g/mol) and were measured by Triple Detection Size Exclusion Chromatography and calculated on the basis of polystyrene molecular weight standards. Examples of suitable silylated poly(alpha-olefins) are known in the art and are commercially available. Examples include the condensation reaction curable silylated polymers marketed as VESTOPLAST®, which are commercially available from Degussa AG Coatings & Colorants of Marl, Germany, Europe. Briefly stated, a method for preparing the silylated copolymers involves contacting i) an olefin copolymer having at least 50 mole % of repeat units comprising residuals of an iso-mono-olefin having 4 to 7 carbon atoms and at most 50 mole % of repeat units comprising residuals of a vinyl aromatic monomer; ii) a silane having at least two hydrolyzable groups and at least one olefinically unsaturated hydrocarbon or hydrocarbonoxy group; and iii) a free radical generating agent. Alternatively, silylated copolymers may be prepared by a method comprising conversion of commercially available hydroxylated polybutadienes (such as those commercially available from Cray Valley SA of Paris, France, under trade names Poly BD and Krasol) by known methods (e.g., reaction with isocyanate functional alkoxysilane, reaction with allylchloride in presence of Na followed by hydrosilylation). Alternatively, examples of suitable silyl modified hydrocarbon polymers include silyl modified polyisobutylene, which is available commercially in the form of telechelic polymers. Silyl modified polyisobutylene can, for example, contain curable silyl groups derived from a silyl-substituted alkyl acrylate or methacrylate monomer such as a dialkoxyalkylsilylpropyl methacrylate or trialkoxysilylpropyl methacrylate, which can be reacted with a polyisobutylene prepared by living anionic polymerisation, atom transfer radical polymerization or chain transfer polymerization. Alternatively, ingredient (B) may comprise a polyether. One type of polyether is a polyoxyalkylene polymer comprising recurring oxyalkylene units of the formula (—CtH2t—O—) where subscript t is an integer with a value ranging from 2 to 4. Polyoxyalkylene polymers typically have terminal hydroxyl groups, and can readily be terminated with silyl groups having hydrolyzable substituents bonded to silicon atoms, for example by reaction of the terminal hydroxyl groups with an excess of an alkyltrialkoxysilane to introduce terminal alkyldialkoxysilyl groups. Alternatively, polymerization may occur via a hydrosilylation type process. Polyoxyalkylenes comprising mostly oxypropylene units may have properties suitable for many sealant uses. Polyoxyalkylene polymers, particularly polyoxypropylenes, having terminal alkyldialkoxysilyl or trialkoxysilyl groups may react with each other in the presence of ingredient (A) and moisture. The composition containing these base polymers may optionally further comprise a crosslinker. The organic polymer having hydrolysable silyl groups can alternatively be an acrylate polymer, that is an addition polymer of acrylate and/or methacrylate ester monomers, which may comprise at least 50 mole % of the monomer repeat units in the acrylate polymer. Examples of suitable acrylate ester monomers are n-butyl, isobutyl, n-propyl, ethyl, methyl, n-hexyl, n-octyl and 2-ethylhexyl acrylates. Examples of suitable methacrylate ester monomers are n-butyl, isobutyl, methyl, n-hexyl, n-octyl, 2-ethylhexyl and lauryl methacrylates. For some applications, the acrylate polymer may have a Tg below ambient temperature; and acrylate polymers may form lower Tg polymers than methacrylate polymers. An exemplary acrylate polymer is polybutyl acrylate. The acrylate polymer may contain lesser amounts of other monomers such as styrene, acrylonitrile or acrylamide. The acrylate polymer can be prepared by various methods such as conventional radical polymerization, or living radical polymerization such as atom transfer radical polymerization, reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer polymerization, or anionic polymerization including living anionic polymerization. The curable silyl groups can, for example, be derived from a silyl-substituted alkyl acrylate or methacrylate monomer. Hydrolysable silyl groups such as dialkoxyalkylsilyl or trialkoxysilyl groups can, for example, be derived from a dialkoxyalkylsilylpropyl methacrylate or trialkoxysilylpropyl methacrylate. When the acrylate polymer has been prepared by a polymerization process which forms reactive terminal groups, such as atom transfer radical polymerization, chain transfer polymerization, or living anionic polymerization, it can readily be reacted with the silyl-substituted alkyl acrylate or methacrylate monomer to form terminal hydrolyzable silyl groups. Silyl modified polyurethanes or polyureas can, for example, be prepared by the reaction of polyurethanes or polyureas having terminal ethylenically unsaturated groups with a silyl monomer containing hydrolyzable groups and a Si—H group, for example a dialkoxyalkylsilicon hydride or trialkoxysilicon hydride. Alternatively, the base polymer may have a silicone-organic block copolymer backbone, which comprises at least one block of polyorganosiloxane groups and at least one block of an organic polymer chain. The polyorganosiloxane groups may comprise groups of formula —(R4fSiO(4-f)/2)—, in which each R4 is independently an organic group such as a hydrocarbon group having from 1 to 18 carbon atoms, a halogenated hydrocarbon group having from 1 to 18 carbon atoms such as chloromethyl, perfluorobutyl, trifluoroethyl, and nonafluorohexyl, a hydrocarbonoxy group having up to 18 carbon atoms, or another organic group exemplified by an oxygen atom containing group such as (meth)acrylic or carboxyl; a nitrogen atom containing group such as amino-functional groups, amido-functional groups, and cyano-functional groups; a sulfur atom containing group such as mercapto groups; and subscript f has, on average, a value ranging from 1 to 3, alternatively 1.8 to 2.2. Alternatively, each R4 may be a hydrocarbon group having 1 to 10 carbon atoms or a halogenated hydrocarbon group; and subscript f may be 0, 1 or 2. Examples of groups suitable for R4 include methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, vinyl, cyclohexyl, phenyl, tolyl group, a propyl group substituted with chlorine or fluorine such as 3,3,3-trifluoropropyl, chlorophenyl, beta-(perfluorobutyl)ethyl or chlorocyclohexyl group. The organic blocks in the polymer backbone may comprise, for example, polystyrene and/or substituted polystyrenes such as poly(α-methylstyrene), poly(vinylmethylstyrene), dienes, poly(p-trimethylsilylstyrene) and poly(p-trimethylsilyl-α-methylstyrene). Other organic groups, which may be incorporated in the polymer backbone, may include acetylene terminated oligophenylenes, vinylbenzyl terminated aromatic polysulphones oligomers, aromatic polyesters, aromatic polyester based monomers, polyalkylenes, polyurethanes, aliphatic polyesters, aliphatic polyamides and aromatic polyamides. Alternatively, the organic polymer blocks in a siloxane organic block copolymer for ingredient (B) may be polyoxyalkylene based blocks comprising recurring oxyalkylene units, illustrated by the average formula (—CgH2g—O—)h where subscript g is an integer with a value ranging from 2 to 4 and subscript h is an integer of at least four. The number average molecular weight (Mn) of each polyoxyalkylene polymer block may range from 300 to 10,000. Moreover, the oxyalkylene units are not necessarily identical throughout the polyoxyalkylene block, but can differ from unit to unit. A polyoxyalkylene block, for example, can comprise oxyethylene units (—C2H4—O—), oxypropylene units (—C3H6—O—) or oxybutylene units (—C4H8—O—), or combinations thereof. Alternatively, the polyoxyalkylene polymeric backbone may consist essentially of oxyethylene units and/or oxypropylene units. Other polyoxyalkylene blocks may include for example, units of the structure: —[—R5—O—(—R6—O—)i-Pn-CR72-Pn-O—(—R6—O—)j—R5]—, in which Pn is a 1,4-phenylene group, each R5 is the same or different and is a divalent hydrocarbon group having 2 to 8 carbon atoms, each R6 is the same or different and is an ethylene group or propylene group, each R7 is the same or different and is a hydrogen atom or methyl group and each of the subscripts i and j each represent a positive integer having a value ranging from 3 to 30. Alternatively, ingredient (B) may comprise a silicone resin, in addition to, or instead of, one of the polymers described above for ingredient (B). Suitable silicone resins are exemplified by an MQ resin, which comprises siloxane units of the formulae: R29wR30(3-w)SiO1/2 and SiO4/2, where R29 and R30 are monovalent organic groups, such as monovalent hydrocarbon groups exemplified by alkyl such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, pentyl, octyl, decyl, dodecyl, undecyl, and octadecyl; cycloalkyl such as cyclopentyl and cyclohexyl; aryl such as phenyl, tolyl, xylyl, and benzyl; and aralkyl such as 2-phenylethyl; halogenated hydrocarbon group exemplified by chlorinated alkyl groups such as chloromethyl and chloropropyl groups; fluorinated alkyl groups such as fluoromethyl, 2-fluoropropyl, 3,3,3-trifluoropropyl, 4,4,4-trifluorobutyl, 4,4,4,3,3-pentafluorobutyl, 5,5,5,4,4,3,3-heptafluoropentyl, 6,6,6,5,5,4,4,3,3-nonafluorohexyl, and 8,8,8,7,7-pentafluorooctyl; chlorinated cycloalkyl groups such as 2,2-dichlorocyclopropyl, 2,3-dichlorocyclopentyl; and fluorinated cycloalkyl groups such as 2,2-difluorocyclopropyl, 2,3-difluorocyclobutyl, 3,4-difluorocyclohexyl, and 3,4-difluoro-5-methylcycloheptyl; and other monovalent organic groups such as hydrocarbon groups substituted with oxygen atoms such as glycidoxyalkyl, and hydrocarbon groups substituted with nitrogen atoms such as aminoalkyl and cyano-functional groups such as cyanoethyl and cyanopropyl; and each instance of subscript w is 0, 1, or 2. Alternatively, each R29 and each R30 may be an alkyl group. The MQ resin may have a molar ratio of M units to Q units (M:Q) ranging from 0.5:1 to 1.5:1. These mole ratios are conveniently measured by Si29 NMR spectroscopy. This technique is capable of quantitatively determining the concentration of R293 SiO1/2 (“M”) and SiO4/2 (“Q”) units derived from the silicone resin and from the neopentamer, Si(OSiMe3)4, present in the initial silicone resin, in addition to the total hydroxyl content of the silicone resin. The MQ silicone resin is soluble in solvents such as liquid hydrocarbons exemplified by benzene, toluene, xylene, and heptane, or in liquid organosilicon compounds such as a low viscosity cyclic and linear polydiorganosiloxanes. The MQ silicone resin may contain 2.0% or less, alternatively 0.7% or less, alternatively 0.3% or less, of terminal units represented by the formula X″SiO3/2, where X″ represents hydroxyl or a hydrolyzable group such as alkoxy such as methoxy and ethoxy; alkenyloxy such as isopropenyloxy; ketoximo such as methyethylketoximo; carboxy such as acetoxy; amidoxy such as acetamidoxy; and aminoxy such as N,N-dimethylaminoxy. The concentration of silanol groups present in the silicone resin can be determined using FTIR. The Mn desired to achieve the desired flow characteristics of the MQ silicone resin can depend at least in part on the Mn of the silicone resin and the type of organic group, represented by R29, that are present in this ingredient. The Mn of the MQ silicone resin is typically greater than 3,000, more typically from 4500 to 7500. The MQ silicone resin can be prepared by any suitable method. Silicone resins of this type have reportedly been prepared by cohydrolysis of the corresponding silanes or by silica hydrosol capping methods known in the art. Briefly stated, the method involves reacting a silica hydrosol under acidic conditions with a hydrolyzable triorganosilane such as trimethylchlorosilane, a siloxane such as hexamethyldisiloxane, or a combination thereof, and recovering a product comprising M and Q units (MQ resin). The resulting MQ resins may contain from 2 to 5 percent by weight of silicon-bonded hydroxyl groups. The intermediates used to prepare the MQ silicone resin may be triorganosilanes of the formula R293SiX, where X represents a hydrolyzable group, as described above for ingredient (B), and either a silane with four hydrolyzable groups such as halogen, alkoxy or hydroxyl, or an alkali metal silicate such as sodium silicate. In some compositions, it may be desirable that the amount of silicon-bonded hydroxyl groups (i.e., HOR29SiO1/2 or HOSiO3/2 groups) in the silicone resin be below 0.7% by weight of the total weight of the silicone resin, alternatively below 0.3%. Silicon-bonded hydroxyl groups formed during preparation of the silicone resin are converted to trihydrocarbylsiloxy groups or a hydrolyzable group by reacting the silicone resin with a silane, disiloxane or disilazane containing the appropriate terminal group. Silanes containing hydrolyzable groups may be added in excess of the stoichiometric quantity of the silicon-bonded hydroxyl groups of the silicone resin.

Alternatively, a resin containing M, T, and Q units may be used, such as DOW CORNING® MQ-1640 Flake Resin, which is also commercially available from Dow Corning Corporation. Such resins may be supplied in organic solvent. Alternatively, the silicone resin may comprise a silsesquioxane resin, i.e., a resin containing T units of formula (R31SiO3/2). Each R31 may be independently selected from a hydrogen atom and a monovalent organic group, such as a monovalent hydrocarbon group exemplified by alkyl such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, pentyl, octyl, decyl, dodecyl, undecyl, and octadecyl; cycloalkyl such as cyclopentyl and cyclohexyl; aryl such as phenyl, tolyl, xylyl, and benzyl; and aralkyl such as 2-phenylethyl; halogenated hydrocarbon group exemplified by chlorinated alkyl groups such as chloromethyl and chloropropyl groups; a fluorinated alkyl group such as fluoromethyl, 2-fluoropropyl, 3,3,3-trifluoropropyl, 4,4,4-trifluorobutyl, 4,4,4,3,3-pentafluorobutyl, 5,5,5,4,4,3,3-heptafluoropentyl, 6,6,6,5,5,4,4,3,3-nonafluorohexyl, and 8,8,8,7,7-pentafluorooctyl; chlorinated cycloalkyl groups such as 2,2-dichlorocyclopropyl, 2,3-dichlorocyclopentyl; and fluorinated cycloalkyl groups such as 2,2-difluorocyclopropyl, 2,3-difluorocyclobutyl, 3,4-difluorocyclohexyl, and 3,4-difluoro-5-methylcycloheptyl; and another monovalent organic group such as a hydrocarbon group substituted with oxygen atoms such as glycidoxyalkyl, and a hydrocarbon group substituted with a nitrogen atom such as aminoalkyl and cyano-functional groups such as cyanoethyl and cyanopropyl.

Other suitable resins include DT resins containing methyl and phenyl groups. The amount of silicone resin added to the composition can vary depending on the end use of the composition. For example, when the reaction product of the composition is a gel, little or no silicone resin may be added. However, the amount of silicone resin in the composition may range from 0% to 90%, alternatively 0.1% to 50%, based on the weight of all ingredients in the composition. The amount of ingredient (B) can depend on various factors including the end use of the reaction product of the composition, the type of base polymer selected for ingredient (B), and the type(s) and amount(s) of any additional ingredient(s) present, if any. However, the amount of ingredient (B) may range from 0.01% to 99%, alternatively 10% to 95%, alternatively 10% to 65% of the composition. Ingredient (B) can be one single base polymer or a combination comprising two or more base polymers that differ in at least one of the following properties: average molecular weight, hydrolyzable substituents, siloxane units, sequence, and viscosity. When one base polymer for ingredient (B) contains an average of only one to two hydrolyzable substituents per molecule, then the composition further may further comprise an additional base polymer having an average of more than two hydrolyzable substituents per molecule, or ingredient (C) a crosslinker, or both. The composition may optionally further comprise one or more additional ingredients, i.e., in addition to ingredients (A) and (B) and distinct from ingredients (A) and (B). The additional ingredient, if present, may be selected based on factors such as the method of use of the composition and/or the end use of the cured product of the composition. The additional ingredient may be: (C) a crosslinker; (D) a drying agent; (E) an extender, a plasticizer, or a combination thereof; (F) a filler such as (f1) a reinforcing filler, (f2) an extending filler, (f3) a conductive filler (e.g., electrically conductive, thermally conductive, or both); (G) a filler treating agent; (H) a biocide, such as (h1) a fungicide, (h2) an herbicide, (h3) a pesticide, or (h4) an antimicrobial; (J) a flame retardant; (K) a surface modifier such as (k1) an adhesion promoter or (k2) a release agent; (L) a chain lengthener; (M) an endblocker; (N) a nonreactive binder; (O) an anti-aging additive; (P) a water release agent; (Q) a pigment; (R) a rheological additive; (S) a vehicle; (T) a tackifying agent; (U) a corrosion inhibitor; and a combination thereof. The additional ingredients are distinct from one another. In some embodiments at least one, alternatively each of additional ingredients (C) to (U), and the combination thereof, does not completely prevent the condensation reaction of ingredient (B). Ingredient (C) is a crosslinker that may be added to the composition, for example, when ingredient (B) contains an average of only one or two hydrolyzable substituents per molecule and/or to increase crosslink density of the reaction product prepared by condensation reaction of the composition. Generally, ingredient (C) is selected with functionality that can vary depending on the degree of crosslinking desired in the reaction product of the composition and such that the reaction product does not exhibit too much weight loss from by-products of the condensation reaction. Generally, the selection of ingredient (C) is made such that the composition remains sufficiently reactable to be useful during storage for several months in a moisture impermeable package. Generally, ingredient (C) is selected such that the hydrolyzable substituents on ingredient (C) are reactive with ingredient (B). For example, when X in ingredient (B) is a hydroxyl group, then the hydrolyzable substituent for ingredient (C) may be a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom; an amido group, an acyloxy groups, a hydrocarbonoxy group, an amino group, an aminoxy group, a mercapto group, an oximo group, a ketoximo group, or an alkoxysilylhydrocarbylene group, or a combination thereof. The exact amount of ingredient (C) can vary depending on factors including the type of base polymer and crosslinker selected, the reactivity of the hydrolyzable substituents on the base polymer and crosslinker, and the desired crosslink density of the reaction product. However, the amount of crosslinker may range from 0.5 to 100 parts based on 100 parts by weight of ingredient (B). Ingredient (C) may comprise a silane crosslinker having hydrolyzable groups or partial or full hydrolysis products thereof.

Ingredient (D) is a drying agent. The drying agent binds water from various sources. For example, the drying agent may bind by-products of the condensation reaction, such as water and alcohols. Examples of suitable adsorbents for ingredient (D) may be inorganic particulates. The adsorbent may have a particle size of 10 micrometers or less, alternatively 5 micrometers or less.

R. Grace of Maryland, U.S.A. Alternatively, the drying agent may bind the water and/or other by-products by chemical means. An amount of a silane crosslinker added to the composition (in addition to ingredient (C)) may function as a chemical drying agent. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is thought that the chemical drying agent may be added to the dry part of a multiple part composition to keep the composition free from water after the parts of the composition are mixed together. For example, alkoxysilanes suitable as drying agents include vinyltrimethoxysilane, vinyltriethoxysilane, and combinations thereof. The amount of ingredient (D) depends on the specific drying agent selected. However, when ingredient (D) is a chemical drying agent, the amount may range from 0 parts to 5 parts, alternatively 0.1 parts to 0.5 parts. Ingredient (D) may be one chemical drying agent. Alternatively, ingredient (D) may comprise two or more different chemical drying agents. Ingredient (E) is an extender and/or a plasticizer.

A low molecular weight organic plasticizer and a higher molecular weight polymer plasticizer may be used in combination. The exact amount of ingredient (E) used in the composition can depend on various factors including the desired end use of the composition and the cured product thereof. However, the amount of ingredient (E) may range from 0.1% to 10 based on the combined weights of all ingredients in the composition. Ingredient (F) is a filler. The filler may comprise a reinforcing filler, an extending filler, a conductive filler, or a combination thereof. For example, the composition may optionally further comprise ingredient (f1), a reinforcing filler, which when present may be added in an amount ranging from 0.1% to 95%, alternatively 1% to 60%, based on the weight of the composition. The exact amount of ingredient (f1) depends on various factors including the form of the reaction product of the composition and whether any other fillers are added.

Examples of such other fillers include magnetic particles such as ferrite; and dielectric particles such as fused glass microspheres, titania, and calcium carbonate. The composition may optionally further comprise ingredient (G) a treating agent. The amount of ingredient (G) can vary depending on factors such as the type of treating agent selected and the type and amount of particulates to be treated, and whether the particulates are treated before being added to the composition, or whether the particulates are treated in situ. However, ingredient (G) may be used in an amount ranging from 0.01 to 20%, alternatively 0.1% to 15%, and alternatively 0.5% to 5%, based on the weight of the composition. Particulates, such as the filler, the physical drying agent, certain flame retardants, certain pigments, and/or certain water release agents, when present, may optionally be surface treated with ingredient (G).

Alternative, a polyorganosiloxane capable of hydrogen bonding is useful as a treating agent. This strategy to treating surface of a filler takes advantage of multiple hydrogen bonds, either clustered or dispersed or both, as the means to tether the compatibilization moiety to the filler surface. The polyorganosiloxane capable of hydrogen bonding has an average, per molecule, of at least one silicon-bonded group capable of hydrogen bonding. The group may be selected from: an organic group having multiple hydroxyl functionalities or an organic group having at least one amino functional group. The polyorganosiloxane capable of hydrogen bonding means that hydrogen bonding is the primary mode of attachment for the polyorganosiloxane to a filler. The polyorganosiloxane may be incapable of forming covalent bonds with the filler. The polyorganosiloxane may be free of condensable silyl groups e.g., silicon bonded alkoxy groups, silazanes, and silanols. The polyorganosiloxane capable of hydrogen bonding may be selected from the group consisting of a saccharide-siloxane polymer, an amino-functional polyorganosiloxane, and a combination thereof. Alternatively, the polyorganosiloxane capable of hydrogen bonding may be a saccharide-siloxane polymer. Ingredient (H) is a biocide.

Ingredient (k2) is a release agent. Suitable release agents are exemplified by fluorinated compounds, such as fluoro-functional silicones, or fluoro-functional organic compounds. Alternatively, the surface modifier for ingredient (K) may be used to change the appearance of the surface of a reaction product of the composition. For example, surface modifier may be used to increase gloss of the surface of a reaction product of the composition. Such a surface modifier may comprise a polydiorganosiloxane with alkyl and aryl groups. For example, DOW CORNING® 550 Fluid is a trimethylsiloxy-terminated poly(dimethyl/methylphenyl)siloxane with a viscosity of 125 cSt that is commercially available from Dow Corning Corporation. Alternatively, ingredient (K) may be a natural oil obtained from a plant or animal source, such as linseed oil, tung oil, soybean oil, castor oil, fish oil, hempseed oil, cottonseed oil, oiticica oil, and rapeseed oil. The exact amount of ingredient (K) depends on various factors including the type of surface modifier selected as ingredient (K) and the end use of the composition and its reaction product. However, ingredient (K), when present, may be added to the composition in an amount ranging from 0.01 to 50 weight parts based on the weight of the composition, alternatively 0.01 to 10 weight parts, and alternatively 0.01 to 5 weight parts. Ingredient (K) may be one adhesion promoter. Alternatively, ingredient (K) may comprise two or more different surface modifiers that differ in at least one of the following properties: structure, viscosity, average molecular weight, polymer units, and sequence. Chain lengtheners may include difunctional silanes and difunctional siloxanes, which extend the length of polyorganosiloxane chains before crosslinking occurs. Chain lengtheners may be used to reduce the modulus of elongation of the cured product. Chain lengtheners and crosslinkers compete in their reactions with the hydrolyzable substituents in ingredient (B). To achieve noticeable chain extension, the difunctional silane has substantially higher reactivity than the trifunctional crosslinker with which it is used. Suitable chain lengtheners include diamidosilanes such as dialkyldiacetamidosilanes or alkenylalkyldiacetamidosilanes, particularly methylvinyldi(N-methylacetamido)silane, or dimethyldi(N-methylacetamido)silane, diacetoxysilanes such as dialkyldiacetoxysilanes or alkylalkenyldiacetoxysilanes, diaminosilanes such as dialkyldiaminosilanes or alkylalkenyldiaminosilanes, dialkoxysilanes such as dimethyldimethoxysilane, dimethyldiethoxysilane and α-aminoalkyldialkoxyalkylsilanes, polydialkylsiloxanes having a degree of polymerization of from 2 to 25 and having an average per molecule of at least two hydrolyzable groups, such as acetamido or acetoxy or amino or alkoxy or amido or ketoximo substituents, and diketoximinosilanes such as dialkylkdiketoximinosilanes and alkylalkenyldiketoximinosilanes.

The polydiorganosiloxanes having both hydroxyl end groups and triorganosilyl end groups, may have more than 50%, alternatively more than 75%, of the total end groups as hydroxyl groups. The amount of triorganosilyl group in the polydimethylsiloxane may be used to regulate the modulus of the reaction product prepared by condensation reaction of the composition. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is thought that higher concentrations of triorganosilyl end groups may provide a lower modulus in certain cured products. Ingredient (M) may be one endblocker. Alternatively, ingredient (M) may comprise two or more different endblockers that differ in at least one of the following properties: structure, viscosity, average molecular weight, polymer units, and sequence. Ingredient (N) is a non-reactive, elastomeric, organic polymer, i.e., an elastomeric organic polymer that does not react with ingredient (B).

Ingredient (N) may be one non-reactive, elastomeric, organic polymer. Alternatively, ingredient (N) may comprise two or more non-reactive, elastomeric, organic polymers that differ in at least one of the following properties: structure, viscosity, average molecular weight, polymer units, and sequence. Alternatively, ingredient (N) may be added to the composition when ingredient (B) comprises a base polymer with an organic polymer backbone. Ingredient (O) is an anti-aging additive. The anti-aging additive may comprise an antioxidant, a UV absorber, a UV stabilizer, a heat stabilizer, or a combination thereof. Suitable antioxidants are known in the art and are commercially available. Suitable antioxidants include phenolic antioxidants and combinations of phenolic antioxidants with stabilizers. Phenolic antioxidants include fully sterically hindered phenols and partially hindered phenols. Alternatively, the stabilizer may be a sterically hindered amine such as tetramethyl-piperidine derivatives. Suitable phenolic antioxidants include vitamin E and IRGANOX® 1010 from Ciba Specialty Chemicals, U.S.A. IRGANOX® 1010 comprises pentaerythritol tetrakis(3-(3,5-di-t-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)propionate). Examples of UV absorbers include phenol, 2-(2H-benzotriazol-2-yl)-6-dodecyl-4-methyl-, branched and linear (TINUVIN® 571). Examples of UV stabilizers include bis(1,2,2,6,6-pentamethyl-4-piperidyl) sebacate; methyl 1,2,2,6,6-pentamethyl-4-piperidyl/sebacate; and a combination thereof (TINUVIN® 272). These and other TINUVIN® additives, such as TINUVIN® 765 are commercially available from Ciba Specialty Chemicals of Tarrytown, N.Y., U.S.A. Other UV and light stabilizers are commercially available, and are exemplified by LowLite from Chemtura, OnCap from PolyOne, and Light Stabilizer 210 from E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company of Delaware, U.S.A. Oligomeric (higher molecular weight) stabilizers may alternatively be used, for example, to minimize potential for migration of the stabilizer out of the composition or the cured product thereof. An example of an oligomeric antioxidant stabilizer (specifically, hindered amine light stabilizer (HALS)) is Ciba TINUVIN® 622, which is a dimethylester of butanedioic acid copolymerized with 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidine ethanol. Heat stabilizers may include iron oxides and carbon blacks, iron carboxylate salts, cerium hydrate, barium zirconate, cerium and zirconium octoates, and porphyrins. The amount of ingredient (O) depends on various factors including the specific anti-aging additive selected and the anti-aging benefit desired. However, the amount of ingredient (O) may range from 0 to 5 weight %, alternatively 0.1% to 4%, and alternatively 0.5% to 3%, based on the weight of the composition. Ingredient (O) may be one anti-aging additive. Alternatively, ingredient (O) may comprise two or more different anti-aging additives. Ingredient (P) is a water release agent that releases water over an application temperature range. Ingredient (P) is selected such that ingredient (P) contains an amount of water sufficient to partially or fully react the composition and such that ingredient (P) releases the sufficient amount of water when exposed for a sufficient amount of time to a use temperature (i.e., a temperature at which the composition is used). However, ingredient (P) binds the water sufficiently to prevent too much water from being released during the method for making the composition and during storage of the composition. For example, ingredient (P) binds the water sufficiently during compounding of the composition such that sufficient water is available for condensation reaction of the composition during or after the application process in which the composition is used. This “controlled release” property also may provide the benefit of ensuring that not too much water is released too rapidly during the application process, since this may cause bubbling or voiding in the reaction product formed by condensation reaction of the composition. Precipitated calcium carbonate may be used as ingredient (P) when the application temperature ranges from 80° C. to 120° C., alternatively 90° C. to 110° C., and alternatively 90° C. to 100° C. However, when the composition is prepared on a continuous (e.g., twin-screw) compounder, the ingredients may be compounded at a temperature 20° C. to 30° C. above the application temperature range for a short amount of time. Therefore, ingredient (P) is selected to ensure that not all of the water content is released during compounding; however ingredient (P) releases a sufficient amount of water for condensation reaction of the composition when exposed to the application temperature range for a sufficient period of time. Examples of suitable water release agents are exemplified by metal salt hydrates, hydrated molecular sieves, and precipitated calcium carbonate, which is available from Solvay under the trademark WINNOFIL® SPM. The water release agent selected can depend on various factors including the other ingredients selected for the composition, including catalyst type and amount; and the process conditions during compounding, packaging, and application. In a twin-screw compounder, residence time may be less than a few minutes, typically less than 1 to 2 minutes. The ingredients are heated rapidly because the surface area/volume ratio in the barrels and along the screw is high and heat is induced by shearing the ingredients. How much water is removed from ingredient (P) depends on the water binding capabilities, the temperature, the exposure time (duration), and the level of vacuum used to strip the composition passing through the compounder. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is thought that with a twin screw compounding temperature of 120° C. there would remain enough water on the precipitated CaCO3 to cause the composition to react by condensation reaction over a period of 1 to 2 weeks at room temperature when the composition has been applied at 90° C. A water release agent may be added to the composition, for example, when the base polymer has low water permeability (e.g., when the base polymer has an organic polymer backbone) and/or the amount of ingredient (P) in the composition depends on various factors including the selection of ingredients (A), (B) and (C) and whether any additional ingredients are present, however the amount of ingredient (P) may range from 5 to 30 parts based on the weight of the composition. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is thought when the composition is heated to the application temperature, the heat would liberate the water, and the water would react with the hydrolyzable groups on ingredient (B) to react the composition. By-products such as alcohols and/or water left in the composition may be bound by a drying agent, thereby allowing the condensation reaction (which is an equilibrium reaction) to proceed toward completion. Ingredient (Q) is a pigment. For purposes of this application, the term ‘pigment’ includes any ingredient used to impart color to a reaction product of a composition described herein. The amount of pigment depends on various factors including the type of pigment selected and the desired degree of coloration of the reaction product. For example, the composition may comprise 0 to 20%, alternatively 0.001% to 5%, of a pigment based on the weight of all ingredients in the composition. Examples of suitable pigments include indigo, titanium dioxide Stan-Tone 505P01 Green (which is commercially available from PolyOne) and carbon black. Representative, non-limiting examples of carbon black include Shawinigan Acetylene black, which is commercially available from Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LP; SUPERJET® Carbon Black (LB-1011) supplied by Elementis Pigments Inc., of Fairview Heights, Ill. U.S.A.; SR 511 supplied by Sid Richardson Carbon Co, of Akron, Ohio U.S.A.; and N330, N550, N762, N990 (from Degussa Engineered Carbons of Parsippany, N.J., U.S.A.). The composition may optionally further comprise up to 5%, alternatively 1% to 2 based on the weight of the composition of ingredient (R) a rheological additive for modifying rheology of the composition. Rheological additives are known in the art and are commercially available. Examples include polyamides, Polyvest, which is commercially available from Evonik, Disparlon from King Industries, Kevlar Fibre Pulp from Du Pont, Rheospan from Nanocor, and Ircogel from Lubrizol. Other suitable rheological additives include polyamide waxes; hydrogenated castor oil derivatives; and metal soaps such as calcium stearate, aluminum stearate and barium stearate, and combinations thereof. Alternatively, ingredient (R) may comprise a microcrystalline wax that is a solid at 25° C. (wax). The melting point may be selected such that the wax has a melting point at the low end of the desired application temperature range. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is thought that ingredient (R) acts as a process aid that improves flow properties while allowing rapid green strength development (i.e., a strong increase in viscosity, corresponding to increase in the load carrying capability of a seal prepared from the composition, with a temperature drop) upon cooling the composition a few degrees, for example, after the composition is applied to a substrate. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is thought that incorporation of wax may also facilitate incorporation of fillers, compounding and de-airing (during production of the composition), and mixing (static or dynamic mixing during application of parts of a multiple-part composition). It is thought that the wax, when molten, serves as a process aid, substantially easing the incorporation of filler in the composition during compounding, the compounding process itself, as well as in during a de-airing step, if used. The wax, with a melt temperature below 100° C., may facilitate mixing of the parts of a multiple part composition before application, even in a simple static mixer. The wax may also facilitate application of the composition at temperatures ranging from 80° C. to 110° C., alternatively 90° C. to 100° C. with good rheology. Waxes suitable for use as ingredient (R) may be non-polar hydrocarbons. The waxes may have branched structures, cyclic structures, or combinations thereof. For example, petroleum microcrystalline waxes are available from Strahl & Pitsch, Inc., of West Babylon, N.Y., U.S.A. and include SP 96 (melting point ranging from 62° C. to 69° C.), SP 18 (melting point ranging from 73° C. to 80° C.), SP 19 (melting point ranging from 76° C. to 83° C.), SP 26 (melting point ranging from 76° C. to 83° C.), SP 60 (melting point ranging from 79° C. to 85° C.), SP 617 (melting point ranging from 88° C. to 93° C.), SP 89 (melting point ranging from 90° C. to 95° C.), and SP 624 (melting point ranging from 90° C. to 95° C.). Other petroleum microcrystalline waxes include waxes marketed under the trademark Multiwax® by Crompton Corporation of Petrolia, Pa., U.S.A. These waxes include 180-W, which comprises saturated branched and cyclic non-polar hydrocarbons and has melting point ranging from 79° C. to 87° C.; Multiwax® W-445, which comprises saturated branched and cyclic non-polar hydrocarbons, and has melting point ranging from 76° C. to 83° C.; and Multiwax® W-835, which comprises saturated branched and cyclic non-polar hydrocarbons, and has melting point ranging from 73° C. to 80° C. The amount of ingredient (R) depends on various factors including the specific rheological additive selected and the selections of the other ingredients of the composition. However, the amount of ingredient (R) may range from 0 parts to 20 parts, alternatively 1 part to 15 parts, and alternatively 1 part to 5 parts based on the weight of the composition. Ingredient (R) may be one rheological additive. Alternatively, ingredient (R) may comprise two or more different rheological additives. A vehicle (e.g., a solvent and/or diluent) may be used in the composition. Vehicle may facilitate flow of the composition and introduction of certain ingredients, such as silicone resin. Vehicles used herein are those that help fluidize the ingredients of the composition but essentially do not react with any of these ingredients. Vehicle may be selected based on solubility the ingredients in the composition and volatility. The solubility refers to the vehicle being sufficient to dissolve and/or disperse ingredients of the composition. Volatility refers to vapor pressure of the vehicle. If the vehicle is too volatile (having too high vapor pressure) bubbles may form in the composition at the application temperature, and the bubbles may cause cracks or otherwise weaken or detrimentally affect properties of the cured product. However, if the vehicle is not volatile enough (too low vapor pressure) the vehicle may remain as a plasticizer in the reaction product of the composition, or the amount of time for the reaction product to develop physical properties may be longer than desired. Suitable vehicles include polyorganosiloxanes with suitable vapor pressures, such as hexamethyldisiloxane, octamethyltrisiloxane, hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane, and other low molecular weight polyorganosiloxanes, such as 0.5 to 1.5 centiStoke (cSt) Dow Corning® 200 Fluids and DOW CORNING® OS FLUIDS, which are commercially available from Dow Corning Corporation of Midland, Mich., U.S.A. Alternatively, the vehicle may be an organic solvent. The organic solvent can be an alcohol such as methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, butanol, or n-propanol; a ketone such as acetone, methylethyl ketone, or methyl isobutyl ketone; an aromatic hydrocarbon such as benzene, toluene, or xylene; an aliphatic hydrocarbon such as heptane, hexane, or octane; a glycol ether such as propylene glycol methyl ether, dipropylene glycol methyl ether, propylene glycol n-butyl ether, propylene glycol n-propyl ether, or ethylene glycol n-butyl ether, a halogenated hydrocarbon such as dichloromethane, 1,1,1-trichloroethane or methylene chloride; chloroform; dimethyl sulfoxide; dimethyl formamide, acetonitrile; tetrahydrofuran; white spirits; mineral spirits; naphtha; n-methyl pyrrolidone; or a combination thereof. The amount of vehicle can depend on various factors including the type of vehicle selected and the amount and type of other ingredients selected for the composition. However, the amount of vehicle may range from 1% to 99%, alternatively 2% to 50%, based on the weight of the composition. The composition may optionally further comprise ingredient (T) a tackifying agent. The tackifying agent may comprise an aliphatic hydrocarbon resin such as a hydrogenated polyolef in having 6 to 20 carbon atoms, a hydrogenated terpene resin, a rosin ester, a hydrogenated rosin glycerol ester, or a combination thereof. Tackifying agents are commercially available. Aliphatic hydrocarbon resins are exemplified by ESCOREZ 1102, 1304, 1310, 1315, and 5600 from Exxon Chemical and Eastotac resins from Eastman, such as Eastotac H-100 having a ring and ball softening point of 100° C., Eastotac H-115E having a ring and ball softening point of 115° C., and Eastotac H-130L having a ring and ball softening point of 130° C. Hydrogenated terpene resins are exemplified by Arkon P 100 from Arakawa Chemicals and Wingtack 95 from Goodyear. Hydrogenated rosin glycerol esters are exemplified by Staybelite Ester 10 and Foral from Hercules. Examples of commercially available polyterpenes include Piccolyte A125 from Hercules. Examples of aliphatic/aromatic or cycloaliphatic/aromatic resins include ECR 149B or ECR 179A from Exxon Chemical. Alternatively, a solid tackifying agent (i.e., a tackifying agent having a ring and ball softening point above 25° C.), may be added. Suitable tackifying agents include any compatible resins or mixtures thereof such as (1) natural or modified rosins such, for example, as gum rosin, wood rosin, tall-oil rosin, distilled rosin, hydrogenated rosin, dimerized rosin, and polymerized rosin; (2) glycerol and pentaerythritol esters of natural or modified rosins, such, for example as the glycerol ester of pale, wood rosin, the glycerol ester of hydrogenated rosin, the glycerol ester of polymerized rosin, the pentaerythritol ester of hydrogenated rosin, and the phenolic-modified pentaerythritol ester of rosin; (3) copolymers and terpolymers of natural terpenes, e.g., styrene/terpene and alpha methyl styrene/terpene; (4) polyterpene resins having a softening point, as determined by ASTM method E28,58T, ranging from 60° C. to 150° C.; the latter polyterpene resins generally resulting from the polymerization of terpene hydrocarbons, such as the bicyclic monoterpene known as pinene, in the presence of Friedel-Crafts catalysts at moderately low temperatures; also included are the hydrogenated polyterpene resins; (5) phenolic modified terpene resins and hydrogenated derivatives thereof, for example, as the resin product resulting from the condensation, in an acidic medium, of a bicyclic terpene and phenol; (6) aliphatic petroleum hydrocarbon resins having a ring and ball softening point ranging from 60° C. to 135° C.; the latter resins resulting from the polymerization of monomers consisting of primarily of olefins and diolefins; also included are the hydrogenated aliphatic petroleum hydrocarbon resins; (7) alicyclic petroleum hydrocarbon resins and the hydrogenated derivatives thereof; and (8) aliphatic/aromatic or cycloaliphatic/aromatic copolymers and their hydrogenated derivatives. The amount of tackifying agent depends on various factors including the specific tackifying agent selected and the selection the other ingredients in the composition. However, the amount of tackifying agent may range from 0 parts to 20 parts based on the weight of the composition. The composition may optionally further comprise ingredient (U), a corrosion inhibitor. Examples of suitable corrosion inhibitors include benzotriazole, mercaptabenzotriazole and commercially available corrosion inhibitors such as 2,5-dimercapto-1,3,4-thiadiazole derivative (CUVAN® 826) and alkylthiadiazole (CUVAN® 484) from R. T. Vanderbilt of Norwalk, Conn., U.S.A. When present, the amount of ingredient (U) may range from 0.05% to 0.5% based on the weight of the composition. When selecting ingredients for the composition described above, there may be overlap between types of ingredients because certain ingredients described herein may have more than one function. For example, certain alkoxysilanes may be useful as filler treating agents and as adhesion promoters, certain fatty acid esters may be useful as plasticizers and may also be useful as filler treating agents, carbon black may be useful as a pigment, a flame retardant, and/or a filler, and nonreactive polydiorganosiloxanes such as polydimethylsiloxanes may be useful as extenders and as solvents. The composition described above may be prepared as a one part composition, for example, by combining all ingredients by any convenient means, such as mixing. For example, a one-part composition may be made by optionally combining (e.g., premixing) the base polymer (B) and an extender (E) and mixing the resulting extended base polymer with all or part of the filler (F), and mixing this with a pre-mix comprising the crosslinker (C) and ingredient (A). Other additives such as (O) the anti-aging additive and (Q) the pigment may be added to the mixture at any desired stage. A final mixing step may be performed under substantially anhydrous conditions, and the resulting compositions are generally stored under substantially anhydrous conditions, for example in sealed containers, until ready for use. Alternatively, the composition may be prepared as a multiple part (e.g., 2 part) composition when a crosslinker is present. In this instance the catalyst and crosslinker are stored in separate parts, and the parts are combined shortly before use of the composition. For example, a two part curable composition may be prepared by combining ingredients comprising (B) and (C) to form a first (curing agent) part by any convenient means such as mixing. A second (base) part may be prepared by combining ingredients comprising (A) and (B) by any convenient means such as mixing. The ingredients may be combined at ambient or elevated temperature and under ambient or anhydrous conditions, depending on various factors including whether a one part or multiple part composition is selected. The base part and curing agent part may be combined by any convenient means, such as mixing, shortly before use. The base part and curing agent part may be combined in relative amounts of base: curing agent ranging from 1:1 to 10:1. The equipment used for mixing the ingredients is not specifically restricted. Examples of suitable mixing equipment may be selected depending on the type and amount of each ingredient selected. For example, agitated batch kettles may be used for relatively low viscosity compositions, such as compositions that would react to form gums or gels. Alternatively, continuous compounding equipment, e.g., extruders such as twin screw extruders, may be used for more viscous compositions and compositions containing relatively high amounts of particulates. Exemplary methods that can be used to prepare the compositions described herein include those disclosed in, for example, U.S. Patent Publications US 2009/0291238 and US 2008/0300358. These compositions made as described above may be stable when the stored in containers that protect the compositions from exposure to moisture, but these compositions may react via condensation reaction when exposed to atmospheric moisture. Alternatively, when a low permeability composition is formulated, the composition may cure to form a cured product when moisture is released from a water release agent. Compositions prepared as described above, and the reaction products thereof, have various uses. The ingredients described above may be used to prepare various types of composition comprising ingredients (A) and (B). The composition may further comprise one or more of the additional ingredients described above, depending on the type of composition and the desired end use of the composition and/or the reaction product of the composition. For example, the ingredients and methods described above may be used for chain extension processes to increase viscosity of the base polymer and/or form a gum, for example, when the base polymer has an average of one to two hydrolyzable groups per molecule. Alternatively, the ingredients and methods described above may be used to formulate curable compositions, for example, when the base polymer has two or more hydrolyzable groups per molecule and/or a crosslinker is present in the composition. The compositions described herein may be reacted by condensation reaction by exposure to moisture. For example, the compositions may react via condensation reaction when exposed to atmospheric moisture. Alternatively, the composition react moisture is released from a water release agent, when a water release agent is present. Each composition described herein reacts to form a reaction product. The reaction product may have a form selected from a gum, a gel, a rubber, or a resin.

Methyltrimethoxysilane (“MTM”) and n-butyltrimethoxysilane lot7f-10749 (“nbtms”) were also purchased from Gelest, Inc. The solvent used in each example below was toluene, dimethylsulfoxide (“DMSO”), or a 1:1 vol mixture of toluene and DMSO. Example 1 Formation of Iron-Ligand Complexes and condensation reaction Precursor solutions were prepared by mixing a Precursor (50 wt %, from Centec International Limited of Cheshire, U.K.) at a 0.2 molar (M) concentration with toluene. Solutions of each ligand shown in Table 1 were prepared by mixing each ligand at a 0.4 molar (M) concentration with toluene. Then equal volumes of precursor solution and ligand solution were mixed together and heated at 70° C. for one hour to form reaction products. 30 μL and 60 μL of these reaction products were added into a mixture of 0.136 g methyltrimethoxy silane MTM/2.1 g polydimethylsiloxane-diol (with viscosity of 90 cSt to 120 cSt at RT) in 5 mL vials. The resulting vials containing compositions were stirred for 1 min with vigorous stirring (several hundred rpm to homogenize each composition). The vials were then each covered with a perforated plate and placed into a humidity chamber maintained at RT and with a relative humidity level (RH) of 50%. The 48 hour visual viscosity measurements were determined by side to side visual comparison of the samples with vials containing different viscosity reference standards at RT. The measurements were performed 48 hours after the samples were first exposed to moisture. The visual viscosity measurement value of each sample was assigned based on the vial of the reference standard it most closely matched. The reference standards were DOW CORNING® 200 fluids (“200 Fluid”) of different viscosities, which were commercially available from Dow Corning Corporation of Midland, Mich., U.S.A. The visual viscosity description and standard to which it corresponded are shown below in Table 1. A value of 0 or 1 indicated that the sample did not exhibit condensation reaction in the 48 hours. A value of 2 to 5 indicated that condensation reaction increasingly occurred. Replicate experiments were subject to normal variation due to various factors, such as the operator performing the visual viscosity measurement and whether the replicate experiments were performed at different times.

Table 2 showed six ligands and the corresponding iron complexes made by the method described above and 48 Hour Visual Viscosity at a loading of 30 or 60 microliters (uL) catalyst in the sample. For comparison, Fe(III)2-ethylhexanoate and DBTDL were also used as catalysts to prepare control samples. In Table 2, In table 2, the hardness was measured by touching the cured samples using fingers.

In each instance, the 48 Hour Visual Viscosity Value was 1. The examples show that the catalysts described above for ingredient (A) and tested as described herein are capable of catalyzing condensation reaction. The composition described herein may be free of tin catalysts, such as those described above. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is thought that the catalysts described herein as ingredient (A) may provide alternative, comparable, or better cure performance in some condensation reaction curable compositions, as compared to the same composition containing a tin catalyst.
