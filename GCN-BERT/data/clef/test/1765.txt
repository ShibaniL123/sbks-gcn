Process E
A solution of ethyl isocyanoacetate (9.06 g, 80.13 mmol) and DBU (12.20 g, 80.13 mmol) in 120 ml of tetrahydrofuran was heated to 50 °C and then a solution of acetaldehyde in 40 ml of tetrahydrofuran was added dropwise to the solution over 30 minutes. The resulting mixed solution was stirred for one hour at 50 °C, cooled to room temperature, neutralized with acetic acid and then rotary evaporated to dryness. The resulting residue was dissolved in 300 ml of ethyl acetate and then washed successively with 1 mol of hydrochloric acid, saturated sodium bicarbonate solution and saturated NaCl solution. The organic layer was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered and rotary evaporated to dryness. The residue was purified by column chromatography to give compound 25A as a pale yellow solid (3.7 g, the yield was 20.5%).
