These applications are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates generally to a dairy composition comprising a high-potency sweetener composition with improved temporal profile and/or flavor profile. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Natural caloric sugars, such as sucrose, fructose, and glucose are utilized heavily in beverage, food, pharmaceutical, and oral hygienic/cosmetic industries due to their pleasant taste. In particular, sucrose imparts a desirable taste for consumers. Although sucrose provides superior sweetness characteristics, it is caloric. While calories are necessary for proper bodily functions, there is a need in the market to provide alternative non-caloric or low-caloric sweeteners with sugar-like taste for consumers with sedentary lifestyles or those who are calorie conscious. However, in general, non-caloric or low caloric sweeteners have associated undesirable tastes to consumers such as delayed sweetness onset; lingering sweet aftertaste; bitter taste; metallic taste; astringent taste; cooling taste; licorice-like taste; and/or the like. For example, the sweet tastes of natural and/or synthetic high-potency sweeteners are slower in onset and longer in duration than the sweet taste produced by sugar and thus change the taste balance of a food composition. Because of these differences, use of a natural high-potency sweetener to replace a bulk sweetener, such as sugar, in a food or beverage, causes an unbalanced temporal profile and/or flavor profile. In addition to the difference in temporal profile, high-potency sweeteners generally exhibit (i) lower maximal response than sugar, (ii) off tastes including bitter, metallic, cooling, astringent, licorice-like taste, etc., and/or (iii) sweetness which diminishes on iterative tasting. It is well known to those skilled in the art of food/beverage formulation that changing the sweetener in a composition requires re-balancing of the flavor and other taste components (e.g., acidulants). If the taste profile of natural and synthetic high-potency sweeteners could be modified to impart specific desired taste characteristics to be more sugar-like, the type and variety of compositions that may be prepared with that sweetener would be significantly expanded. Accordingly, it would be desirable to selectively modify the taste characteristics of natural and synthetic high-potency sweeteners. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Generally, this invention addresses the above described need by providing a dairy composition having improved temporal profile and/or flavor profile and a method for improving the temporal profile and/or flavor profile for dairy compositions. In particular, this invention improves the temporal profile and/or flavor profile by imparting a more sugar-like temporal profile and/or flavor profile. More particularly, this invention comprises a dairy composition comprising a dairy product; at least one high-potency sweetener; and at least one sweet taste improving composition.

Generally described, embodiments of the present invention provide dairy compositions comprising at least one natural and/or synthetic high-potency sweetener, at least one sweet taste improving composition, and a dairy product. I. DAIRY PRODUCTS Dairy products and processes for making dairy products suitable for use in this invention are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Dairy products, as used herein, comprise milk or foodstuffs produced from milk. Non-limiting examples of dairy products suitable for use in embodiments of this invention include milk, milk cream, sour cream, crème fraiche, buttermilk, cultured buttermilk, milk powder, condensed milk, evaporated milk, butter, cheese, cottage cheese, cream cheese, yogurt, ice cream, frozen custard, frozen yogurt, gelato, vla, piima, filmjolk, kajmak, kephir, viili, kumiss, airag, ice milk, casein, ayran, lassi, khoa, or combinations thereof. Milk is a fluid secreted by the mammary glands of female mammals for the nourishment of their young. The female ability to produce milk is one of the defining characteristics of mammals and provides the primary source of nutrition for newborns before they are able to digest more diverse foods. In particular embodiments of this invention, the dairy products are derived from the raw milk of cows, goats, sheep, horses, donkeys, camels, water buffalo, yaks, reindeer, moose, or humans. In particular embodiments of this invention, the processing of the dairy product from raw milk generally comprises the steps of pasteurizing, creaming, and homogenizing. Although raw milk may be consumed without pasteurization, it usually is pasteurized to destroy harmful microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, protozoa, molds, and yeasts. Pasteurizing generally comprises heating the milk to a high temperature for a short period of time to substantially reduce the number of microorganisms, thereby reducing the risk of disease. Creaming traditionally follows pasteurization step, and involves the separation of milk into a higher-fat cream layer and a lower-fat milk layer. Milk will separate into milk and cream layers upon standing for twelve to twenty-four hours. The cream rises to the top of the milk layer and may be skimmed and used as a separate dairy product. Alternatively, centrifuges may be used to separate the cream from the milk. The remaining milk is classified according to the fat content of the milk, non-limiting examples of which include whole, 2%, 1%, and skim milk. After removing the desired amount of fat from the milk by creaming, milk is often homogenized. Homogenization prevents cream from separating from the milk and generally involves pumping the milk at high pressures through narrow tubes in order to break up fat globules in the milk. Pasteurization, creaming, and homogenization of milk are common but are not required to produce consumable dairy products. Accordingly, suitable dairy products for use in embodiments of this invention may undergo no processing steps, a single processing step, or combinations of the processing steps described herein. Suitable dairy products for use in embodiments of this invention may also undergo processing steps in addition to or apart from the processing steps described herein. Particular embodiments of this invention comprise dairy products produced from milk by additional processing steps. As described above, cream may be skimmed from the top of milk or separated from the milk using machine-centrifuges. In a particular embodiment, the dairy product comprises sour cream, a dairy product rich in fats that is obtained by fermenting cream using a bacterial culture. The bacteria produce lactic acid during fermentation, which sours and thickens the cream. In another particular embodiment, the dairy product comprises crème fraiche, a heavy cream slightly soured with bacterial culture in a similar manner to sour cream. Crème fraiche ordinarily is not as thick or as sour as sour cream. In yet another particular embodiment, the dairy product comprises cultured buttermilk. Cultured buttermilk is obtained by adding bacteria to milk. The resulting fermentation, in which the bacterial culture turns lactose into lactic acid, gives cultured buttermilk a sour taste. Although it is produced in a different manner, cultured buttermilk generally is similar to traditional buttermilk, which is a by-product of butter manufacture. According to other particular embodiments of this invention, the dairy products comprise milk powder, condensed milk, evaporated milk, or combinations thereof. Milk powder, condensed milk, and evaporated milk generally are produced by removing water from milk. In a particular embodiment, the dairy product comprises a milk powder comprising dried milk solids with a low moisture content. In another particular embodiment, the dairy product comprises condensed milk. Condensed milk generally comprises milk with a reduced water content and added sweetener, yielding a thick, sweet product with a long shelf-life. In yet another particular embodiment, the dairy product comprises evaporated milk. Evaporated milk generally comprises fresh, homogenized milk from which about 60% of the water has been removed, that has been chilled, fortified with additives such as vitamins and stabilizers, packaged, and finally sterilized. According to another particular embodiment of this invention, the dairy product comprises a dry creamer/sweetener composition. In another particular embodiment, the dairy product provided herein comprises butter. Butter generally is made by churning fresh or fermented cream or milk. Butter generally comprises butterfat surrounding small droplets comprising mostly water and milk proteins. The churning process damages the membranes surrounding the microscopic globules of butterfat, allowing the milk fats to conjoin and to separate from the other parts of the cream. In yet another particular embodiment, the dairy product comprises buttermilk, which is the sour-tasting liquid remaining after producing butter from full-cream milk by the churning process. In still another particular embodiment, the dairy product comprises cheese, a solid foodstuff produced by curdling milk using a combination of rennet or rennet substitutes and acidification. Rennet, a natural complex of enzymes produced in mammalian stomachs to digest milk, is used in cheese-making to curdle the milk, causing it to separate into solids known as curds and liquids known as whey. Generally, rennet is obtained from the stomachs of young ruminants, such as calves; however, alternative sources of rennet include some plants, microbial organisms, and genetically modified bacteria, fungus, or yeast. In addition, milk may be coagulated by adding acid, such as citric acid. Generally, a combination of rennet and/or acidification is used to curdle the milk. After separating the milk into curds and whey, some cheeses are made by simply draining, salting, and packaging the curds. For most cheeses, however, more processing is needed. Many different methods may be used to produce the hundreds of available varieties of cheese. Processing methods include heating the cheese, cutting it into small cubes to drain, salting, stretching, cheddaring, washing, molding, aging, and ripening. Some cheeses, such as the blue cheeses, have additional bacteria or molds introduced to them before or during aging, imparting flavor and aroma to the finished product. Cottage cheese is a cheese curd product with a mild flavor that is drained but not pressed so that some whey remains. The curd is usually washed to remove acidity. Cream cheese is a soft, mild-tasting, white cheese with a high fat content that is produced by adding cream to milk and then curdling to form a rich curd. Alternatively, cream cheese can be made from skim milk with cream added to the curd. It should be understood that cheese, as used herein, comprises all solid foodstuff produced by the curdling milk. In another particular embodiment of this invention, the dairy product comprises yogurt. Yogurt generally is produced by the bacterial fermentation of milk. The fermentation of lactose produces lactic acid, which acts on proteins in milk to give the yogurt a gel-like texture and tartness. In particularly desirable embodiments, the yogurt may be sweetened with a sweetener and/or flavored. Non-limiting examples of flavorings include, but are not limited to, fruits (e.g., peach, strawberry, banana), vanilla, and chocolate. Yogurt, as used herein, also includes yogurt varieties with different consistencies and viscosities, such as dahi, dadih or dadiah, labneh or labaneh, bulgarian, kefir, and matsoni. In another particular embodiment, the dairy product comprises a yogurt-based beverage, also known as drinkable yogurt or a yogurt smoothie. In particularly desirable embodiments, the yogurt-based beverage may comprise sweeteners, flavorings, other ingredients, or combinations thereof. It is well known to those of ordinary skill in the art that phytonutrients, plant extracts, and herbal compositions may be used in their natural and/or modified form. Modified phytonutrients, plant extracts, and herbal compositions include phytonutrients, plant extracts, and herbal compositions which have been altered naturally. For example, a modified phytonutrient includes, but is not limited to, phytonutrients which have been fermented, contacted with enzyme, or derivatized or substituted on the phytonutrient. In one embodiment, modified phytonutrients may be used individually or in combination with unmodified phytonutrients. For the sake of brevity, however, in the description of embodiments of this invention, a modified phytonutrient is not described expressly as an alternative to an unmodified phytonutrient, but it should be understood that modified phytonutrients can be substituted for or combined with phytonutrients in any embodiment disclosed herein. The same embodiments would be applicable to plant extracts and other herbal compositions. Plant extracts include extracts from foliage, stems, bark, fruit, seed, and any other plant matter. It is contemplated that other dairy products beyond those described herein may be used in particular embodiments of this invention. Such dairy products are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art, non-limiting examples of which include vla, piima, filmjolk, kajmak, kephir, viili, kumiss, airag, ice milk, casein, ayran, lassi, and khoa. According to particular embodiments of this invention, the dairy compositions also may comprise other additives. Non-limiting examples of suitable additives include sweeteners and flavorants such as chocolate, strawberry, and banana. Particular embodiments of the dairy compositions provided herein also may comprise additional nutritional supplements such as vitamins (e.g., vitamin D) and minerals (e.g., calcium) to improve the nutritional composition of the milk. In a particularly desirable embodiment, the dairy composition comprises at least one natural and/or synthetic high-potency sweetener in combination with at least one sweet taste improving composition and a dairy product. In a particular embodiment, the at least one natural and/or synthetic high-potency sweetener is present in the dairy composition in an amount in the range of about 200 to about 20,000 weight percent of the dairy composition. II. SWEETENER COMPOSITIONS As described hereinabove, the dairy compositions comprise at least one natural and/or synthetic high-potency sweetener and at least one sweet taste improving composition. The combination of the at least one natural and/or synthetic high-potency sweetener and at least one sweet taste improving composition, as used herein, comprises the “sweetener composition.” As used herein, dairy product is synonymous with a “sweetenable composition.” In addition, the combination of the sweetener composition and dairy product comprises a “sweetened composition.” A. Natural High-Potency Sweeteners Desirably, the sweetener composition comprises at least one natural and/or synthetic high-potency sweetener. As used herein the phrases “natural high-potency sweetener”, “NHPS”, “NHPS composition”, and “natural high-potency sweetener composition” are synonymous. “NHPS” means any sweetener found in nature which may be in raw, extracted, purified, or any other form, singularly or in combination thereof and characteristically have a sweetness potency greater than sucrose, fructose, or glucose, yet have less calories. Non-limiting examples of NHPSs suitable for embodiments of this invention include rebaudioside A, rebaudioside B, rebaudioside C, rebaudioside D, rebaudioside E, rebaudioside F, dulcoside A, dulcoside B, rubusoside, stevia, stevioside, mogroside IV, mogroside V, Luo Han Guo sweetener, siamenoside, monatin and its salts (monatin SS, RR, RS, SR), curculin, glycyrrhizic acid and its salts, thaumatin, monellin, mabinlin, brazzein, hernandulcin, phyllodulcin, glycyphyllin, phloridzin, trilobatin, baiyunoside, osladin, polypodoside A, pterocaryoside A, pterocaryoside B, mukurozioside, phlomisoside I, periandrin I, abrusoside A, and cyclocarioside I. NHPS also includes modified NHPSs. Modified NHPSs include NHPSs which have been altered naturally. For example, a modified NHPS includes, but is not limited to, NHPSs which have been fermented, contacted with enzyme, or derivatized or substituted on the NHPS. In one embodiment, at least one modified NHPS may be used in combination with at least one NHPS. In another embodiment, at least one modified NHPS may be used without a NHPS. Thus, modified NHPSs may be substituted for a NHPS or may be used in combination with NHPSs for any of the embodiments described herein. For the sake of brevity, however, in the description of embodiments of this invention, a modified NHPS is not expressly described as an alternative to an unmodified NHPS, but it should be understood that modified NHPSs can be substituted for NHPSs in any embodiment disclosed herein. In one embodiment, extracts of a NHPS may be used in any purity percentage. In another embodiment, when a NHPS is used as a non-extract, the purity of the NHPS may range for example from about 25% to about 100%. According to other embodiments, the purity of the NHPS may range from about 50% to about 100% from about 70% to about 100%; from about 80% to about 100%; from about 90% to about 100%; from about 95% to about 100%; from about 95% to about 99.5%; from about 96% to about 100%; from about 97% to about 100%; from about 98% to about 100%; and from about 99% to about 100%. Purity, as used here, represents the weight percentage of a respective NHPS compound present in a NHPS extract, in raw or purified form. In one embodiment, a steviolglycoside extract comprises a particular steviolglycoside in a particular purity, with the remainder of the stevioglycoside extract comprising a mixture of other steviolglycosides. To obtain a particularly pure extract of a NHPS, such as rebaudioside A, it may be necessary to purify the crude extract to a substantially pure form. Such methods generally are known to those of ordinary skill in the art. An exemplary method for purifying a NHPS, such as rebaudioside A, is described in the co-pending patent application No. 60/805,216, entitled “Rebaudioside A Composition and Method for Purifying Rebaudioside A,” filed on Jun. 19, 2006, by inventors DuBois, et al., the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Briefly described, substantially pure rebaudioside A is crystallized in a single step from an aqueous organic solution comprising at least one organic solvent and water in an amount from about 10% to about 25% by weight, more particularly from about 15% to about 20% by weight. Organic solvents desirably comprise alcohols, acetone, and acetonitile. Non-limiting examples of alcohols include ethanol, methanol, isopranol, 1-propanol, 1-butanol, 2-butanol, tert-butanol, and isobutanol. Desirably, the at least one organic solvent comprises a mixture of ethanol and methanol present in the aqueous organic solution in a weight ratio ranging from about 20 parts to about 1 part ethanol to 1 part methanol, more desirably from about 3 parts to about 1 part ethanol to 1 part methanol. Desirably, the weight ratio of the aqueous organic solvent and crude rebaudioside A ranges from about 10 to about 4 parts aqueous organic solvent to 1 part crude rebaudioside A, more particularly from about 5 to about 3 parts aqueous organic solvent to 1 part crude rebaudioside A. In an exemplary embodiment, the method of purifying rebaudioside A is carried out at approximately room temperature. In another embodiment, the method of purifying rebaudioside A further comprises the step of heating the rebaudioside A solution to a temperature in a range from about 20° C. to about 40° C., or in another embodiment to a reflux temperature, for about 0.25 hours to about 8 hours. In another exemplary embodiment, wherein the method for purifying rebaudioside A comprises the step of heating the rebaudioside A solution, the method further comprises the step of cooling the rebaudioside A solution to a temperature in the range from about 4° C. to about 25° C. for about 0.5 hours to about 24 hours. According to particular embodiments, the purity of rebaudioside A may range from about 50% to about 100%; from about 70% to about 100%; from about 80% to about 100%; from about 90% to about 100%; from about 95% to about 100%; from about 95% to about 99.5%; about 96% to about 100%; from about 97% to about 100%; from about 98% to about 100%; and from about 99% to about 100%. According to particularly desirable embodiments, upon crystallization of crude rebaudioside A, the substantially pure rebaudioside A composition comprises rebaudioside A in a purity greater than about 95% by weight up to about 100% by weight on a dry basis. In other exemplary embodiments, substantially pure rebaudioside A comprises purity levels of rebaudioside A greater than about 97% up to about 100% rebaudioside A by weight on a dry basis, greater than about 98% up to about 100% by weight on a dry basis, or greater than about 99% up to about 100% by weight on a dry basis. The rebaudioside A solution during the single crystallization step may be stirred or unstirred. In an exemplary embodiment, the method of purifying rebaudioside A further comprises the step of seeding (optional step) the rebaudioside A solution at an appropriate temperature with high-purity crystals of rebaudioside A sufficient to promote crystallization of the rebaudioside A to form pure rebaudioside A. An amount of rebaudioside A sufficient to promote crystallization of substantially pure rebaudioside A comprises an amount of rebaudioside A from about 0.0001% to about 1% by weight of the rebaudioside A present in the solution, more particularly from about 0.01% to about 1% by weight. An appropriate temperature for the step of seeding comprises a temperature in a range from about 18° C. to about 35° C. In another exemplary embodiment, the method of purifying rebaudioside A further comprises the steps of separating and washing the substantially pure rebaudioside A composition. The substantially pure rebaudioside A composition may be separated from the aqueous organic solution by a variety of solid-liquid separation techniques that utilize centrifugal force, that include, without limitation, vertical and horizontal perforated basket centrifuge, solid bowl centrifuge, decanter centrifuge, peeler type centrifuge, pusher type centrifuge, Heinkel type centrifuge, disc stack centrifuge and cyclone separation. Additionally, separation may be enhanced by any of pressure, vacuum, and gravity filtration methods, that include, without limitation, the use of belt, drum, nutsche type, leaf, plate, Rosenmund type, sparkler type, and bag filters and filter press. Operation of the rebaudioside A solid-liquid separation device may be continuous, semi-continuous or in batch mode. The substantially pure rebaudioside A composition also may be washed on the separation device using various aqueous organic solvents and mixtures thereof. The substantially pure rebaudioside A composition can be dried partially or totally on the separation device using any number of gases, including, without limitation, nitrogen and argon, to evaporate residual liquid solvent. The substantially pure rebaudioside A composition may be removed automatically or manually from the separation device using liquids, gases or mechanical means by either dissolving the solid or maintaining the solid form. In still another exemplary embodiment, the method of purifying rebaudioside A further comprises the step of drying the substantially pure rebaudioside A composition using techniques well known to those skilled in the art, non-limiting examples of which include the use of a rotary vacuum dryer, fluid bed dryer, rotary tunnel dryer, plate dryer, tray dryer, Nauta type dryer, spray dryer, flash dryer, micron dryer, pan dryer, high and low speed paddle dryer and microwave dryer. In an exemplary embodiment, the step of drying comprises drying the substantially pure rebaudioside A composition using a nitrogen or argon purge to remove the residual solvent at a temperature in a range from about 40° C. to about 60° C. for about 5 hours to about 100 hours. In yet another exemplary embodiment, wherein the crude rebaudioside A mixture comprises substantially no rebaudioside D impurity, the method of purifying rebaudioside A further comprises the step of slurrying the composition of substantially pure rebaudioside A with an aqueous organic solvent prior to the step of drying the substantially pure rebaudioside A composition. The slurry is a mixture comprising a solid and an aqueous organic or organic solvent, wherein the solid comprises the substantially pure rebaudioside A composition and is only sparingly soluble in the aqueous organic or organic solvent. In an embodiment, the substantially pure rebaudioside A composition and aqueous organic solvent are present in the slurry in a weight ratio ranging from about 15 parts to 1 part aqueous organic solvent to 1 part substantially pure rebaudioside A composition. In one embodiment, the slurry is maintained at room temperature. In another embodiment, the step of slurrying comprises heating the slurry to a temperature in a range from about 20° C. to about 40° C. The substantially pure rebaudioside A composition is slurried for about 0.5 hours to about 24 hours. In still yet another exemplary embodiment, the method of purifying rebaudioside A further comprises the steps of separating the substantially pure rebaudioside A composition from the aqueous organic or organic solvent of the slurry and washing the substantially pure rebaudioside A composition followed by the step of drying the substantially pure rebaudioside A composition. If further purification is desired, the method of purifying rebaudioside A described herein may be repeated or the substantially pure rebaudioside A composition may be purified further using an alternative purification method, such as the column chromatography. It also is contemplated that other NHPSs may be purified using the purification method described herein, requiring only minor experimentation that would be obvious to those of ordinary skill in the art. The purification of rebaudioside A by crystallization as described above results in the formation of at least three different polymorphs: Form 1: a rebaudioside A hydrate; Form 2: an anhydrous rebaudioside A; and Form 3: a rebaudioside A solvate. In addition to the at least three polymorph forms of rebaudioside A, the purification of rebaudioside A may result in the formation of an amorphous form of rebaudioside A, Form 4. The aqueous organic solution and temperature of the purification process influence the resulting polymorph and amorphous forms in the substantially pure rebaudioside A composition. FIGS. 1-5 are exemplary powder x-ray diffraction (XRPD) scans of the polymorph and amorphous forms of rebaudioside A: Form 1 (hydrate), Form 2 (anhydrate), Form 3A (methanol solvate), Form 3B (ethanol solvate), and Form 4 (amorphous), respectively. The material properties of the three rebaudioside A polymorph and amorphous forms are summarized in the following table: TABLE 1 Rebaudioside A Polymorphs and Amorphous Forms Form 1 Form 2 Form 3 Form 4 Polymorph Polymorph Polymorph Amorphous Rate of Very low Intermediate High High dissolution (<0.2%/60 (<30%/5 (>30%/5 (>35%/5 in H2O at minutes) minutes minutes) minutes) 25° C. Alcohol <0.5% <1% 1-3% <0.05% content Moisture >5% <1% <3% 6.74% content The type of polymorph formed is dependent on the composition of the aqueous organic solution, the temperature of the crystallization step, and the temperature during the drying step. Form 1 and Form 3 are formed during the single crystallization step while Form 2 is formed during the drying step after conversion from Form 1 or Form 3. Low temperatures during the crystallization step, in the range of about 20° C. to about 50° C., and a low ratio of water to the organic solvent in the aqueous organic solvent results in the formation of Form 3. High temperatures during the crystallization step, in the range of about 50° C. to about 80° C., and a high ratio of water to the organic solvent in the aqueous organic solvent results in the formation of the Form 1. Form 1 can be converted to Form 3 by slurrying in an anhydrous solvent at room temperature (2-16 hours) or at reflux for approximately (0.5-3 hours). Form 3 can be converted to Form 1 by slurrying the polymorph in water at room temperature for approximately 16 hours or at reflux for approximately 2-3 hours. Form 3 can be converted to the Form 2 during the drying process; however, increasing either the drying temperature above 70° C. or the drying time of a substantially pure rebaudioside A composition can result in decomposition of the rebaudioside A and increase the remaining rebaudioside B impurity in the substantially pure rebaudioside A composition. Form 2 can be converted to Form 1 with the addition of water. Form 4 may be formed from Form 1, 2, 3, or combinations thereof, using methods well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Non-limiting examples of such methods include melt-processing, ball milling, crystallization, lyophilization, cryo-grinding, and spray-drying. In a particular embodiment, Form 4 can be prepared from a substantially pure rebaudioside A composition obtained by the purification methods described hereinabove by spray-drying a solution of the substantially pure rebaudioside A composition. B. Synthetic High-Potency Sweeteners As used herein, the phrase “synthetic sweetener” refers to any compositions which are not found in nature and characteristically have a sweetness potency greater than sucrose, fructose, or glucose, yet have less calories. Non-limiting examples of synthetic sweeteners suitable for embodiments of this invention include sucralose, potassium acesulfame, aspartame, alitame, saccharin, neohesperidin dihydrochalcone, cyclamate, neotame, N—[N-[3-(3-hydroxy-4-methoxyphenyl)propyl]-L-α-aspartyl]-L-phenylalanine 1-methyl ester, N—[N-[3-(3-hydroxy-4-methoxyphenyl)-3-methylbutyl]-L-α-aspartyl]-L-phenylalanine 1-methyl ester, N—[N-[3-(3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenyl)propyl]-L-α-aspartyl]-L-phenylalanine 1-methyl ester, salts thereof, and the like. C. Combinations of Natural and/or Synthetic High-Potency Sweeteners The NHPS and synthetic sweeteners may be used individually or in combination with other NHPS and/or synthetic sweeteners. For example, the sweetener composition may comprise a single NHPS or a single synthetic sweetener; a single NHPS in combination with a single synthetic sweetener; one or more NHPSs in combination with a single synthetic sweetener; a single NHPS in combination with one or more synthetic sweeteners; or one or more NHPSs in combination with one or more synthetic sweeteners. A plurality of natural and/or synthetic high-potency sweeteners may be used as long as the combined effect does not adversely affect the taste of the sweetener composition. For example, particular embodiments comprise combinations of NHPSs, such as steviolglycosides. Non-limiting examples of suitable stevioglycosides which may be combined include rebaudioside A, rebaudioside B, rebaudioside C, rebaudioside D, rebaudioside E, rebaudioside F, dulcoside A, dulcoside B, rubusoside, stevioside, or steviolbioside.

III. SWEET TASTE IMPROVING COMPOSITIONS The sweetener composition also comprises a sweet taste improving composition, non-limiting examples of which include carbohydrates, polyols, amino acids and their corresponding salts, polyamino acids and their corresponding salts, sugar acids and their corresponding salts, nucleotides, organic acids, inorganic acids, organic salts including organic acid salts and organic base salts, inorganic salts, bitter compounds, flavorants and flavoring ingredients, astringent compounds, proteins or protein hydrolysates, surfactants, emulsifiers, flavonoids, alcohols, polymers, other sweet taste improving taste additives imparting such sugar-like characteristics, and combinations thereof. In one embodiment, a single sweet taste improving composition may be used in combination with a single natural and/or synthetic high-potency sweetener. In another embodiment of the present invention, a single sweet taste improving composition may be used in combination with one or more natural and/or synthetic high-potency sweeteners. In yet another embodiment, one or more sweet taste improving compositions may be used in combination with a single natural and/or synthetic high-potency sweetener. In a further embodiment, there may be a plurality of sweet taste improving combinations used in combination with one or more natural and/or synthetic high-potency sweeteners. In a particular embodiment, combinations of at least one natural and/or synthetic high-potency sweetener and at least one sweet taste improving composition suppress, reduce, or eliminate undesirable taste and impart sugar-like characteristics to the sweetener composition. As used herein, the phrase “undesirable taste” includes any taste property which is not imparted by sugars, e.g. glucose, sucrose, fructose, or similar saccharides. Non-limiting examples of undesirable tastes include delayed sweetness onset, lingering sweet aftertaste, metallic taste, bitter taste, cooling sensation taste or menthol-like taste, licorice-like taste, and/or the like. A. Sweet Taste In one embodiment, a sweetener composition exhibits a more sugar-like temporal and/or sugar-like flavor profile than a sweetener composition comprising at least one natural and/or synthetic high-potency sweetener, but without a sweet taste improving composition is provided. As used herein, the phrases “sugar-like characteristic,” “sugar-like taste,” “sugar-like sweet,” “sugary,” and “sugar-like” are synonymous. Sugar-like characteristics include any characteristic similar to that of sucrose and include, but are not limited to, maximal response, flavor profile, temporal profile, adaptation behavior, mouthfeel, concentration/response function behavior, tastant and flavor/sweet taste interactions, spatial pattern selectivity, and temperature effects. These characteristics are dimensions in which the taste of sucrose is different from the tastes of natural and synthetic high-potency sweeteners. Whether or not a characteristic is more sugar-like is determined by expert sensory panel assessments of sugar and compositions comprising at least one natural and/or synthetic high-potency sweetener, both with and without a sweet taste improving composition. Such assessments quantify similarities of the characteristics of compositions comprising at least one natural and/or synthetic high-potency sweetener, both with and without a sweet taste improving composition, with those comprising sugar. Suitable procedures for determining whether a composition has a more sugar-like taste are well known in the art. In a particular embodiment, a panel of assessors is used to measure the reduction of sweetness linger. Briefly described, a panel of assessors (generally 8 to 12 individuals) is trained to evaluate sweetness perception and measure sweetness at several time points from when the sample is initially taken into the mouth until 3 minutes after it has been expectorated. Using statistical analysis, the results are compared between samples containing additives and samples that do not contain additives. A decrease in score for a time point measured after the sample has cleared the mouth indicates there has been a reduction in sweetness perception. The panel of assessors may be trained using procedures well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. In a particular embodiment, the panel of assessors may be trained using the Spectrum™ Descriptive Analysis Method (Meilgaard et al, Sensory Evaluation Techniques, 3rd edition, Chapter 11). Desirably, the focus of training should be the recognition of and the measure of the basic tastes; specifically, sweet. In order to ensure accuracy and reproducibility of results, each assessor should repeat the measure of the reduction of sweetness linger about three to about five times per sample, taking at least a five minute break between each repetition and/or sample and rinsing well with water to clear the mouth. Generally, the method of measuring sweetness comprises taking a 10 mL sample into the mouth, holding the sample in the mouth for 5 seconds and gently swirling the sample in the mouth, rating the sweetness intensity perceived at 5 seconds, expectorating the sample (without swallowing following expectorating the sample), rinsing with one mouthful of water (e.g., vigorously moving water in mouth as if with mouth wash) and expectorating the rinse water, rating the sweetness intensity perceived immediately upon expectorating the rinse water, waiting 45 seconds and, while wating those 45 seconds, identifying the time of maximum perceived sweetness intensity and rating the sweetness intensity at that time (moving the mouth normally and swallowing as needed), rating the sweetness intensity after another 10 seconds, rating the sweetness intensity after another 60 seconds (cumulative 120 seconds after rinse), and rating the sweetness intensity after still another 60 seconds (cumulative 180 seconds after rinse). Between samples take a 5 minute break, rinsing well with water to clear the mouth. B.

In another embodiment, the dairy composition comprises at least one natural and/or synthetic high-potency sweetener and a dairy product in combination with a plurality of sweet taste improving additives, desirably 3 or more sweet taste improving additives, and even more desirably 4 or more sweet taste improving additives, wherein each sweet taste improving additive is present in an amount such that no one sweet taste improving additive imparts a substantial off taste to the sweetener composition. In other words, the amounts of the sweet taste improving additives in the sweetener composition are balanced so that no one sweet taste improving additive imparts a substantial off taste to the sweetener composition. According to a particular embodiment of this invention, the sweetener composition provided herein comprises at least one sweet taste improving composition in the sweetener composition in an amount effective for the sweetener composition to impart an osmolarity of at least 10 mOsmoles/L to an aqueous solution of the sweetener composition, wherein the at least one natural and/or synthetic high-potency sweetener is present in the aqueous solution in an amount sufficient to impart a maximum sweetness intensity equivalent to that of a 10% aqueous solution of sucrose by weight. As used herein, “mOsmoles/L” refers to milliosmoles per liter. According to another embodiment, the sweetener composition comprises at least one sweet taste improving composition in an amount effective for the sweetener composition to impart an osmolarity of 10 to 500 mOsmoles/L, preferably 25 to 500 mOsmoles/L preferably, more preferably 100 to 500 mOsmoles/L, more preferably 200 to 500 mOsmoles/L, and still more preferably 300 to 500 mOsmoles/L to an aqueous solution of the sweetener composition, wherein the at least one natural and/or synthetic high-potency sweetener is present in the aqueous solution in an amount sufficient to impart a maximum sweetness intensity equivalent to that of a 10% aqueous solution of sucrose by weight. Wherein a plurality of sweet taste improving compositions are combined with at least one natural and/or synthetic high-potency sweetener, the osmolarity imparted is that of the total combination of the plurality of sweet taste improving compositions. Osmolarity refers to the measure of osmoles of solute per liter of solution, wherein osmole is equal to the number of moles of osmotically active particles in an ideal solution (e.g., a mole of glucose is one osmole), whereas a mole of sodium chloride is two osmoles (one mole of sodium and one mole of chloride). Thus, in order to improve in the quality of taste of the sweetener composition, the osmotically active compounds or the compounds which impart osmolarity must not introduce significant off taste to the formulation. In one embodiment, suitable sweet taste improving carbohydrate additives for the present invention have a molecular weight less than or equal to 500 and desirably have a molecular weight from 50 to 500. In particular embodiments, suitable carbohydrates with a molecular weight less than or equal to 500 include, but are not limited to, sucrose, fructose, glucose, maltose, lactose, mannose, galactose, and tagatose. Generally, in accordance with desirable embodiments of this invention, a sweet taste improving carbohydrate additive is present in the sweetener compositions in an amount from about 1,000 to about 100,000 ppm. (Throughout this specification, the term ppm means parts per million by weight or volume. For example, 500 ppm means 500 mg in a liter.) In accordance with other desirable embodiments of this invention, a sweet taste improving carbohydrate additive is present in the sweetened compositions in an amount from about 2,500 to about 10,000 ppm. In another embodiment, suitable sweet taste improving carbohydrate additives for imparting osmolarities ranging from about 10 mOsmoles/L to about 500 mOsmoles/L to a sweetenable composition include, but are not limited to, sweet taste improving carbohydrate additives with a molecular weight ranging from about 50 to about 500. In one embodiment, suitable sweet taste improving polyol additives have a molecular weight less than or equal to 500 and desirably have a molecular weight from 76 to 500. In particular embodiments, suitable sweet taste improving polyol additives with a molecular weight less than or equal to 500 include, but are not limited to, erythritol, glycerol, and propylene glycol.

V. EXAMPLES The present invention is further illustrated by the following examples, which are not to be construed in any way as imposing limitations upon the scope thereof. On the contrary, it is to be clearly understood that resort may be had to various other embodiments, modifications, and equivalents thereof which, after reading the description therein, may suggest themselves to those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit of the present invention and/or the scope of the appended claims. Unless otherwise specified, %'s are by weight. Example Set A Example A1 Milk A dairy composition comprises a dairy product, at least one high-potency sweetener, and at least one sweet taste improving composition. The dairy product comprises 2% milk obtained from a commercial source. The at least one high-potency sweetner is provided at a concentration of 450 ppm and comprises substantially pure rebaudioside A having 98.91 wt. % rebadioside A, 0.06 wt. % stevioside, 0.03 wt. % rebaudioside C, 0.12 wt. % unknown #1, 0.13 wt. % unknown #2, 0.1 wt. % rebaudioside D, 0.49 wt. % rebaudioside B, and 0.03 wt. % steviolbioside. The at least one sweet taste improving composition comprises erythritol and is provided at a concentration of 35,000 ppm. Example A2 Ice Cream A dairy composition comprises a mixture of cream, high-potency sweetener, and a sweet taste improving composition. The high-potency sweetener comprises substantially pure rebaudioside A having 98.91 wt. % rebadioside A, 0.06 wt. % stevioside, 0.03 wt. % rebaudioside C, 0.12 wt. % unknown #1, 0.13 wt. % unknown #2, 0.1 wt. % rebaudioside D, 0.49 wt. % rebaudioside B, and 0.03 wt. % steviolbioside. The sweet taste improving composition comprises erythritol. The high potency sweetener is provided at a concentration of 450 ppm and the sweet taste improving composition is provided at a concentration of 35,000 ppm. After mixing, the composition is cooled below its freezing point while stirring to produce a frozen ice cream composition. Example A3 Yogurt A dairy composition is formed by inoculating pasteurized milk with a bacterial culture and incubating between 104 and 113 degrees Fahrenheit. The fermentation of lactose by the bacteria produces lactic acid. The mixture is allowed to incubate until the pH drops to about 5.0, at which point the mixture begins to form a yogurt gel. A high-potency sweetener comprising substantially pure rebaudioside A having 98.91 wt. % rebadioside A, 0.06 wt. % stevioside, 0.03 wt. % rebaudioside C, 0.12 wt. % unknown #1, 0.13 wt. % unknown #2, 0.1 wt. % rebaudioside D, 0.49 wt. % rebaudioside B, and 0.03 wt. % steviolbioside is provided at a concentration of 450 ppm. A sweet taste improving composition comprising erythritol is added to the yogurt at a concentration of 35,000 ppm. After the addition of the sweetener, the mixture is refrigerated in order to stop the fermentation and growth of the bacteria and to firm the yogurt gel. The process of forming yogurt is well known to one of ordinary skill in the art. For example, a process for forming yogurt is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,956,186 to Streiff et al.
