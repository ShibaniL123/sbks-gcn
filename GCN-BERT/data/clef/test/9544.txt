TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a novel ring-fused heterocyclic compound or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof having a T-type calcium channel regulatory activity and useful as a therapeutic and/or preventive agent for pruritus, and the like, and a T-type calcium channel inhibitor and the like which comprise, as an active ingredient, the ring-fused heterocyclic compound or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. BACKGROUND ART Voltage-dependent calcium channels are ion channels that cause influx of calcium ions into cells under the potential difference between the interior and the exterior of a cell, and are known to have important biological functions, including neuronal excitation, synaptic transmission, muscle contraction, cardiac automaticity, secretion of neurotransmitters and hormones, cell proliferation and differentiation, and the like. Voltage-dependent calcium channels have been classified into any of the five categories T, L, P/Q, N, and R by their electrophysiological and pharmacological properties [Physiological Review, Vol. 83, p. 117 (2003)]. Among these five channels, only the T-type channels are activated by high membrane potentials, and are called low-voltage-activated channels. The other four channels are called high-voltage-activated (hereinafter, “HVA”) channels, because of their activation at low membrane potentials. As the name suggests, the T (transient)-type calcium channels are characterized by transient activation and quick inactivation. On the other hand, the HVA channels require a long time for inactivation. It is known that the HVA channels basically act as a heterotetramer having α1, α2/δ, β, and γ subunits. It is known that, among these subunits, the α1 subunit is the subunit that forms a channel pore, whereas the other subunits act as regulatory or accessory subunits. On the other hand, it is believed that the T-type calcium channels act as the α1 subunit alone. Currently, ten kinds of α1 subunits are known in voltage-dependent calcium channels, and three of these α1 subunits, α1G (Cav3.1), α1H (Cav3.2), and α1I (Cav3.3) are known to form the T-type calcium channels. The expression of T-type calcium channels has been confirmed in the peripheral and central nervous systems, heart, kidneys, smooth muscle, skeletal muscle, endocrine cells, bone, sperm, and the like. As physiological functions of the T-type calcium channels, neuronal firing, sleeping, pain transmission, heart's pacemaker function, renovascular tonus, hormone secretion, fertilization, and the like, are reported [Physiological Review, Vol. 83, p. 117 (2003); Trends in Pharmacological Science, Vol. 30, p. 32 (2008); Proceedings of the National Academy of Science of the United States of America, Vol. 102, p. 1743 (2005); Proceedings of the National Academy of Science of the United States of America, Vol. 101, p. 18195 (2004)]. As a disease associated with enhancement of the T-type calcium channels, epilepsy [Neuron, Vol. 31, p. 35 (2001); Annals of Neurology, Vol. 54, p. 239 (2003); Journal of Neurophysiology, Vol. 98, p. 2274 (2007)], pain [Channels, Vol. 1, p. 238 (2007); EMBO Journal, Vol. 24, p. 315 (2005); Journal of Neuroscience, Vol. 27, p. 3305 (2007); Molecular Cells, Vol. 25, p. 242 (2008); Acta Pharamacologica Sinica, Vol. 27, p. 1547 (2006); Genes, Brain and Behavior, Vol. 6, p. 425 (2007); Pain, Vol. 105, p. 159 (2003); Pain, Vol. 109, p. 150 (2004); Pain, Vol. 145, p. 184 (2009)], heart disease [Journal of Pharmacological Sciences, Vol. 99, p. 197 (2005); Journal of Pharmacological Sciences, Vol. 99, p. 205 (2005); Journal of Pharmacological Sciences, Vol. 99, p. 211 (2005); Journal of Pharmacological Sciences, Vol. 99, p. 214 (2005)], kidney disease [American Journal of Kidney Disease, Vol. 38, p. 1241 (2001); Journal of Pharmacological Science, Vol. 99, p. 221 (2005); Circulation Research, Vol. 100, p. 342 (2007)], inflammation and edema [Pharmacological Research, Vol. 44, p. 527 (2001)], arteriosclerosis [Cardiology, Vol. 89, p. 10 (1998)], aldosteronism [The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, Vol. 287, p. 824 (1998)], cancer [Cell Calcium, Vol. 36, p. 489 (2004); Molecular Pharmacology, Vol. 62, p. 210 (2002)], hearing impairment [Hearing Research, Vol. 226, p. 52 (2007)], and the like, have been reported. T-type calcium channel antagonists are thus considered effective for the treatment or prevention of these diseases. In fact, the cardioprotective effect [Circulation Journal, Vol. 67, p. 139-145 (2003); Circulation, Vol. 101, p. 758 (2000)] and the renoprotective effect [Hypertension Research, Vol. 30, p. 621 (2007)] of T-type calcium channel antagonists are reported in the clinic. Further, it was reported that T-type calcium channels are involved in sleeping [Proceedings of the National Academy of Science of the United States of America, Vol. 102, p. 1743 (2005); Proceedings of the National Academy of Science of the United States of America, Vol. 101, p. 18195 (2004)], and their antagonists may be effective for the treatment and/or prevention of sleep disorder [Current Opinion in Pharmacology, Vol. 8, p. 33 (2008)]. Further, in recent years, it was reported that T-type calcium channel antagonists may be effective for the treatment and/or prevention of pruritus (WO2010/110428). Among the compounds that act on the T-type calcium channels, many compounds are known as a T-type calcium channel inhibitor. Examples include efonidipine (see, Non-Patent Documents 1 and 2, and the like), mibefradil (see, Non-Patent Document 3, and the like), diphenylmethane derivatives (see, Patent Document 1, and the like), dihydroquinazoline derivatives (see, Patent Documents 2 and 3, and the like), piperidine derivatives (see, Patent Document 4, and the like), piperazine derivatives (see, Patent Document 5, and the like), azetidine and azetidone derivatives (see, Patent Document 6, and the like), thiazole derivatives (see, Patent Document 7, and the like), pyridine derivatives (see, Patent Document 8, and the like), and the like. On the other hand, as a imidazopyridine derivative, compounds described in Patent Documents 9 to 38 and the like are known. Furthermore, as a T-type calcium channel inhibitor, imidazopyridine derivatives and the like (see, Non-Patent Document 39) are known.

Test Example 1 Inhibitory Effect for Intracellular Calcium Response Via Cav3.2 T-Type Ca2+ Channels Intracellular calcium response was measured with an FLIPR Calcium 3 Assay Kit (Molecular Devices). The fluorescence indicator attached to the kit was dissolved in an assay buffer containing 20 mmol/L HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.4), 0.5 mmol/L CaCl2, 0.407 mmol/L MgSO4, 0.75 mg/mL amaranth, and Hanks' Balanced Salt Solutions (calcium and magnesium free) to prepare an indicator solution. A human Cav3.2 T-type Ca2+channel-expressing cell line was produced according to a known method [Analytical Biochemistry, Vol. 400, p. 163 (2010)], using KJMGER8 cells (Namalwa cell-derived cell line) as a host. The cells were suspended in the indicator solution in 1×106 cells/mL density, and plated in a 384-well clear-bottom black plate (Nunc) in 40 μL/well portions, then incubated in a CO2 incubator (95% air, 5% CO2) at 37° C. for 30 minutes. By using an FDSS 6000 (Hamamatsu Photonics K.K.), 5 μL/well of a solution containing the test compound in 10-fold concentration of the final concentration (prepared using an assay buffer containing 1 vol % DMSO and 0.2 vol % bovine serum albumin) was added and incubated for 5 minutes. Then, 5 μL/well of an assay buffer containing 50 mmol/L CaCl2 (final concentration 5 mmol/L) was added to induce the reaction, and the fluorescence (excitation wavelength 480 nm, fluorescence wavelength 540 nm) was measured every two seconds for 2 minutes and 40 seconds. The difference between the minimum value and the maximum value of the fluorescence values after the addition of CaCl2 was used as the index of calcium response. The calcium response in the absence of the test compound was taken as 100% with respect to the calcium response in the presence of 3 μmol/L mibefradil (T-type Ca2+ channel inhibitor; Sigma-Aldrich), and the test compound concentration that shows a 50% inhibitory effect (IC50 value) was calculated. As a result, the IC50 of compounds 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 14, 15, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 34, 39, 40, 45, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 103, 104, 106, 107, 109, 110, 112, 115, 120, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 131, 133, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 201, 202, 203, 204, 205, 206, 207, 208, 209, 210, 211, 212, 213, 214, 215, 216, 217, 218, 219, 220, 221, 222, 223, 224, 225, 226 and 227 for the human Cav3.2 T-type Ca2+ current was equal to or lower than 100 nmol/L. It was confirmed that compound (I) and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof inhibit the human Cav3.2 T-type Ca2+ current. Therefore, compound (I) and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof were considered to be useful as therapeutic and/or preventive agents for diseases associated with the T-type calcium channels. Thus, compound (I) and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof were considered to be useful as therapeutic and/or preventive agent for diseases associated with the T-type calcium channels, such as, epilepsy (for example, absence epilepsy, and the like), sleep disorder (for example, insomnia, and the like), pain (for example, neuropathic pain, trigeminal neuralgia, diabetic pain, postherpetic neuralgia, neuropathic low back pain, HIV-related pain, fibromyalgia syndrome, cancer pain, inflammatory pain, acute pain, chronic pain, postoperative pain, acute pain after tooth extraction, chronic musculoskeletal pain, nociceptive pain, psychogenic pain, menstrual pain, and the like), migraine, pruritus [for example, pruritus accompanied by skin lesion, including, for example, atopic dermatitis, neurodermatitis, senile cutaneous pruritus, seborrheic dermatitis, caterpillar dermatitis, urticaria, eczema and dermatitis, photosensitivity, autosensitive dermatitis, prurigo, insect bites and stings, scabies, mycosis, cutaneous pruritus, hypertrophic scar, psoriasis such as plaque psoriasis, hydroa, xeroderma, lichen, ringworm, burn, and the like; visceral diseases such as hepatic and biliary tract diseases (for example, cirrhosis such as primary biliary cirrhosis, cholestasis, hepatitis, and the like), kidney diseases (for example, kidney failure such as chronic kidney failure, kidney dialysis, and the like), endocrine and metabolic diseases (for example, thyroid disease such as thyroid dysfunction, diabetes, and the like), and the like; cancers (for example, malignant lymphoma, digestive cancer, and the like); hematological disorders (for example, polycythemia vera, hypoferric anemia, and the like); neurological disorders (for example, multiple sclerosis, neurosis, and the like); AIDS; pregnancy; pruritus that are not necessarily accompanied by skin lesion due to drug side effects; pruritus associated with ophthalmic or otorhinolaryngological diseases; and the like], heart diseases (for example, cardiac hypertrophy, heart failure, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrhythmia, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and the like), kidney diseases (for example, nephritis, nephropathy, kidney failure, and the like), endocrine diseases (for example, aldosteronism, Cushing's syndrome, hyperthyroidism, hyperinsulinemia, and the like), cancers (for example, prostate cancer, breast cancer, leukemia, neuroblastoma, retinoblastoma, and the like), hearing impairment (for example, noise-induced hearing impairment, and the like), and the like. Test Example 2 Inhibitory Effect for Pruritus in Morphine-Induced Pruritus Mice Morphine (1 nmol/5 μL, dissolved in physiological saline) or physiological saline was intrathecally administered between the fifth and sixth lumbar vertebrae of male ddY mice using a microsyringe fitted with a 30-gauge injection needle. Mice to which only morphine was administered were referred to as a control group, and mice to which only physiological saline was administered were referred to as as a physiological saline-administered group. The number of scratching behavior with the hind legs which began to be observed immediately after the morphine administration was measured for 30 minutes. Because mice show continuous scratching actions in each scratching behavior, a series of such actions was counted as a single scratching behavior. Each test compound was administered 30 minutes or 1 hour before the morphine administration. The test compound was suspended in a 0.5% methylcellulose solution and was prepared plural administration solutions of different concentrations, and each of them was orally administered in a volume of 10 mL/kg. As a result, Compounds 15, 40, 53, 55, and 129 inhibited the increase of the scratching behavior observed in the morphine-induced pruritus mice by the administration of them at a dose of 30 mg/kg or less. Compounds 164, 173, 176, 178, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 189, 190, 193, 194, 197, and 208 inhibited the increase of the scratching behavior observed in the morphine-induced pruritus mice by the administration of them at a dose of 10 mg/kg or less. Therefore, it was confirmed that compound (I) or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof were useful as therapeutic and/or preventive agents for pruritus, and useful as therapeutic and/or preventive agents for pruritus, such as pruritus accompanied by skin lesion, including, for example, atopic dermatitis, neurodermatitis, senile cutaneous pruritus, seborrheic dermatitis, caterpillar dermatitis, urticaria, eczema and dermatitis, photosensitivity, autosensitive dermatitis, prurigo, insect bites and stings, scabies, mycosis, cutaneous pruritus, hypertrophic scar, psoriasis such as plaque psoriasis, hydroa, xeroderma, lichen, ringworm, burn, and the like; pruritus that are not necessarily accompanied by skin lesion, which is caused by visceral diseases such as hepatic and biliary diseases (cirrhosis such as primary biliary cirrhosis, cholestasis, hepatitis, and the like), kidney diseases (kidney failure such as chronic kidney failure, kidney dialysis, and the like), endocrine and metabolic diseases (thyroid disease such as thyroid dysfunction, diabetes, and the like), and the like, cancers (malignant lymphoma, digestive system cancer, and the like), hematological disorders (polycythemia vera, hypoferric anemia, and the like), neurological disorders (multiple sclerosis, hematological disorders, and the like), AIDS, pregnancy, or drug side effects; pruritus associated with ophthalmic and otorhinolaryngological diseases, and the like. Compound (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof can be administered alone as it is. However, usually, compound (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof are preferably provided in various pharmaceutical preparations. Also, the pharmaceutical preparations are used for animals or humans. The pharmaceutical preparations according to the present invention may contain compound (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof as an active ingredient, either alone or as a mixture with any other active ingredient for other treatments. Further, the pharmaceutical preparations are prepared by mixing the active ingredient with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers (for example, diluent, solvent, excipient, and the like) and then subjecting the mixture to any method well known in the technical field of pharmaceutics. As for the administration route, it is preferred to select the most effective route for the treatment. Examples of the administration route include oral administration, parenteral administration such as intravenous administration, and the like. Examples of the dosage form include a tablet, injection, and the like.

Suitable dosage forms for the parenteral administration, for example, injections and the like, can be prepared by using diluents, or solvents, or the like, such as a salt solution, a glucose solution, a mixture of brine with a glucose solution, and the like. The doses and the frequencies of administration of compound (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof may vary depending upon dosage form, age and body weight of a patient, nature or seriousness of the symptom to be treated, and the like. In the oral administration, in general, a dose of 0.01 to 1,000 mg, preferably, 0.05 to 100 mg, is administered to an adult patient once or several times a day. In parenteral administration such as intravenous administration, a dose of 0.001 to 1,000 mg, preferably, 0.01 to 100 mg, is administered to an adult patient once or several times a day.
