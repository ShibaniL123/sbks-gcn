Probiotic compositions and uses thereof for treatment of obesity- related disorders Field of the Art [001] The present disclosure relates generally to compositions and methods to provide probiotic supplements useful for the therapeutic and/or prophylactic treatment, amelioration and/or regulation of disease states or pathological conditions. More specifically, the present disclosure relates to methods and compositions for the treatment or prevention of metabolic syndrome, obesity and obesity-related disorders. Background [002] Obesity is one of the most common metabolic disorders in the world, rapidly increasing in prevalence both in the developed and the developing world. Obesity is defined as a body weight more than 20% in excess of the ideal body weight, frequently resulting in a significant impairment of health. Obesity may be measured by body mass index, an indicator of adiposity or fatness. Further parameters for defining obesity are waist circumferences, skinfold thickness and bio impedance. Obesity is fast becoming one of the most critical and challenging medical epidemics, we face, not only placing enormous financial burden on health systems, but affecting the quality of life and ultimately life expectancy of sufferers. Obesity is associated with a number of subsequent disorders including cardiovascular disease, type II diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and various forms of cancer, and is closely correlated with metabolic syndrome. [003] Metabolic syndrome (also known as syndrome X and insulin resistance syndrome) is a collection of cardiovascular risk factors including abdominal obesity, hypertension, high blood levels of triglycerides, high fasting glucose levels, and low blood levels of HDL cholesterol. Typically the presence of three or more of these risk factors is required for the diagnosis of metabolic syndrome. Insulin resistance also greatly increases the risk of developing metabolic syndrome. Metabolic syndrome often precedes the development of type II diabetes, coronary artery disease and other atherosclerotic conditions such as stroke and peripheral vascular disease. It is estimated that in the United States alone, there are more than 50 million sufferers of metabolic syndrome. [004] Metabolic syndrome typically begins with obesity and/or insulin resistance. In the early stages, metabolic risk factors such as elevated apolipoprotein B, elevated triglycerides, high small LDL, low HDL, elevated glucose, elevated plasminogen activator inhibitor 1, elevated fibrinogen, elevated factor VII, elevated inflammatory cytokines, vascular dysfunction and vascular inflammation, may be increased slightly. However with time, particularly as obesity increases and other exacerbating factors emerge, the risk factors increase considerably. [005] Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is of increasing relevance in today's society (and is a more commonly diagnosed liver disease than alcoholic liver disease) due to the rapid and increased prevalence and burden of obesity. The prevalence of NAFLD is almost proportional to the global increase in obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Furthermore, NAFLD is the most commonly diagnosed cause of abnormal liver function tests. NAFLD is caused by fat deposited (steatosis) in the liver that is not due to excess alcohol consumption or liver inflammation and its consequences. Disruption of the normal mechanisms for synthesis, transport and removal of fatty acids (LCFA) and triglycerides (TG) underpins the basic mechanism for the development of NAFLD. [006] The progressive form of NAFLD is designated non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). NASH is the progression of steatosis to chronic inflammation of the liver with fat accumulation (steatohepatitis). The progression from NAFLD to NASH may lead to cirrhosis and end stage liver disease that is adverse to health and associated with morbidity. [007] The major risk factor for NAFLD is over consumption of calorie rich foods and the resulting consequences, namely obesity (abdominal visceral obesity), dyslipidemia, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Diets comprising high amounts of saturated fats or carbohydrates have been associated with increased liver inflammation. Currently, NAFLD has been estimated to affect as much as 34% and NASH between 2-5% of the population. Dividing the population into lean and obese groups further highlights the correlation with obesity. NAFLD has been found in 16% of lean individuals, opposed to 76% of obese individuals. With childhood obesity rates increasing, the prevalence of NAFLD and NASH is expected to rise, increasing the burden of fatty liver disease. In the pathogenesis of NAFLD and NASH, there is hypothesised a strong involvement of the gastrointestinal system, as evidenced by studies on the gut-liver axis. An understanding of the role of the gut microbiota and intestinal permeability dysfunction in obesity related liver disorders is warranted. [008] This multifactorial nature of obesity, and obesity-related disorders such as metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance and fatty liver disorders makes treatment a particular challenge. There is growing interest in the development of novel therapeutic strategies that target multiple risk factors more effectively that the current complex multi-drug therapies employed.

Detailed Description [0065] Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by those of ordinary skill in the art to which the disclosure belongs. Although any methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice or testing of the present disclosure, typical methods and materials are described. [0066] The articles "a" and "an" are used herein to refer to one or to more than one (i.e., to at least one) of the grammatical object of the article. By way of example, "an element" means one element or more than one element. [0067] In the context of this specification, the term "about," is understood to refer to a range of numbers that a person of skill in the art would consider equivalent to the recited value in the context of achieving the same function or result. [0068] Throughout this specification and the claims which follow, unless the context requires otherwise, the word "comprise", and variations such as "comprises" or "comprising", will be understood to imply the inclusion of a stated integer or step or group of integers or steps but not the exclusion of any other integer or step or group of integers or steps. [0069] In the context of this specification, the term "probiotic" is to be given its broadest construction and is understood to refer to a microbial cell population or preparation, or component of a microbial cell population or preparation, which when administered to a subject in an effective amount promotes a health benefit in the subject. [0070] In the context of this specification, the term "prebiotic" is to be given its broadest construction and is understood to refer to any non-digestible substance that stimulates the growth and/or activity of bacteria in the digestive system. [0071] In the context of this specification, the terms "food", "foods", "beverage" or "beverages" include but are not limited to health foods and beverages, functional foods and beverages, and foods and beverages for specified health use. When such foods or beverages of the present invention are used for subjects other than humans, the terms can be used to include a feedstuff. [0072] The term "subject" as used herein refers to any mammal, including, but not limited to, livestock and other farm animals (such as cattle, goats, sheep, horses, pigs and chickens), performance animals (such as racehorses), companion animals (such as cats and dogs), laboratory test animals and humans. Typically the subject is a human. [0073] As used herein, the term "effective amount" refers to an amount of a probiotic composition that is sufficient to effect one or more beneficial or desired outcomes. An "effective amount" can be provided in one or more administrations. The exact amount required will vary depending on factors such as the identity and number of individual probiotic strains employed, the subject being treated, the nature of the disease(s) or condition(s) suffered by the subject that is to be treated and the age and general health of the subject, and the form in which the composition is administered. Thus, it is not possible to specify an exact "effective amount". However, for any given case, an appropriate "effective amount" may be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art using only routine experimentation. [0074] As used herein the terms "treating", "treatment" and the like refer to any and all applications which remedy, or otherwise hinder, retard, or reverse the progression of, a disease or disorder or at least one symptom of a disease or disorder, including reducing the severity of a disease or disorder. Thus, treatment does not necessarily imply that a subject is treated until complete recovery from a disease or disorder. Similarly, the terms "preventing", "prevention" and the like refer to any and all applications that prevent the establishment of a disease or disorder or otherwise delay the onset of a disease or disorder. [0075] The term "improve" in the context of markers of metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance means that a composition is administered to a subject, or a method is used, for a period of time effective to improve one or more markers of metabolic syndrome and/or insulin resistance as determined by comparison with the same one or more markers in the subject absent the administration of the composition or method. Typically such "improvement" comprises normalization (e.g. of the level) of a marker, wherein normalization means restoring the (e.g. level) of the marker to (or towards) that expected, or observed in individuals, in the absence of metabolic syndrome or insulin resistance. Any suitable method(s) of assessing markers can be used to determine whether an improvement occurs, as will be readily appreciated by those skilled in the art. [0076] The term "optionally" is used herein to mean that the subsequently described feature may or may not be present or that the subsequently described event or circumstance may or may not occur. Hence the specification will be understood to include and encompass embodiments in which the feature is present and embodiments in which the feature is not present, and embodiments in which the event or circumstance occurs as well as embodiments in which it does not.

[0095] Contemplated herein are packages comprising a probiotic composition according to the present disclosure in one unit dosage form and a prebiotic in a separate unit dosage form, wherein the separate unit dosage forms are intended to be co-administered. The unit dosage forms may be, for example, capsules. In an exemplary embodiment, the probiotic composition may be administered in a daily dose of 2000 mg of a multi-strain combination (200 billion CFU bacteria) and 3000 mg prebiotic (such as FOS), to be taken, for example, as 2 x 50 mg probiotic capsules and 2 x 750 mg prebiotic capsules in the morning, followed by 2 x 500 mg probiotic capsules and 2 x 750 mg prebiotic capsules at night (8 capsules per day). A package may contain blister packs of probiotic and prebiotic capsules, each blister pack providing one, two or more days supply. [0096] Compositions of the invention may further comprise any suitable additives, carriers, additional therapeutic agents, bioavailability enhancers, side-effect suppressing components, diluents, buffers, flavouring agents, binders, preservatives or other ingredients that are not detrimental to the efficacy of the composition. In some embodiments, the probiotic strains may comprise from about 50% to about 90% by weight of the composition, based on the total weight of the composition including a carrier medium, or from about 60% to about 80% by weight of the composition. [0097] In particular embodiments, compositions of the present disclosure may be gluten free and dairy free, and suitable for ingestion by vegetarians. [0098] Compositions of the invention can be readily manufactured by those skilled in the art using known techniques and processes. For example, the microbial strains can be seeded from standard stock into a reactor and grown in standardized media until a predetermined cfu/g concentration is reached. The bulk material can then be drained from the reactor and dried by spray drying, lyophilization, or flatbed oven drying. The dried bacterial material can then be blended with the carrier medium and the resulting mixture can be pressed into tablets, filled into foil pouches as a granular solid, or introduced into gelatin capsules as a particulate material. [0099] Compositions of the present disclosure may be suitably formulated for oral administration, and may be prepared according to conventional methods well known in the pharmaceutical and nutraceutical industries, such as those described in Remington's Pharmaceutical Handbook (Mack Publishing Co., NY, USA) using suitable excipients, diluents and fillers. [00100] Compositions suitable for oral administration may be presented as discrete units (i.e. dosage forms) such as gelatine or HPMC capsules, cachets or tablets, each containing a predetermined amount of each component of the composition as a powder, granules, as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous liquid or a non-aqueous liquid, or as an oil-in-water liquid emulsion or a water-in-oil liquid emulsion. [00101] When the composition is formulated as capsules, the components of the composition may be formulated with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers such as starch, lactose, microcrystalline cellulose and/or silicon dioxide. Additional ingredients may include lubricants such as magnesium stearate and/or calcium stearate. The capsules may optionally be coated, for example, with a film coating or an enteric coating and/or may be formulated so as to provide slow or controlled release of the composition therein. [00102] Tablets may be prepared by compression or moulding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the components of the composition in a free-flowing form such as a powder or granules, optionally mixed with a binder, lubricant (for example magnesium stearate or calcium stearate), inert diluent or a surface active/dispersing agent. Moulded tablets may be made by moulding a mixture of the powdered composition moistened with an inert liquid diluent, in a suitable machine. The tablets may optionally be coated, for example, with a film coating or an enteric coating and/or may be formulated so as to provide slow or controlled release of the composition therein. [00103] The compositions may be provided to the user in a powder form. For oral administration, the composition may then be mixed with a suitable volume of an aqueous medium, typically with agitation, to dissolve the components, or produce a suspension, suitable for ingestion. Thus, the compositions may be provided to a user in a powder form, which powder may then be added by the user to any type of aqueous medium (for example water or fruit juice) and consumed there after. Alternatively, the composition may be provided as a beverage, pre-mixed with an aqueous medium such as water. In another embodiment the compositions may be added in powder form by the user to any type to a food product (for example, yoghurt) and consumed there after. In another embodiment, the compositions may simply be consumed as a powder in the absence of a drink or additional food product. [00104] The probiotic strains may be conveniently incorporated in a variety of food and/or beverage products, nutraceutical products, probiotic supplements, food additives, pharmaceuticals and over-the-counter formulations. The food or food additive may be a solid form such as a powder, or a liquid form. Specific examples of the types of beverages or foods include, but are not limited to water-based, milk-based, yoghurt-based, other dairy-based, milk- substitute based such as soy milk or oat milk, or juice-based beverages, water, soft drinks, carbonated drinks, and nutritional beverages, (including a concentrated stock solution of a beverage and a dry powder for preparation of such a beverage); baked products such as crackers, breads, muffins, rolls, bagels, biscuits, cereals, bars such as muesli bars, health food bars and the like, dressings, sauces, custards, yoghurts, puddings, pre-packaged frozen meals, soups and confectioneries. [00105] Those skilled in the art will appreciate that single or multiple administrations of compositions disclosed herein can be carried out with dose levels and dosing regimes being determined as required depending on the circumstances and on the condition of the subject to be treated. The skilled addressee can readily determine suitable dosage regimes. A broad range of doses may be applicable. Dosage regimens may be adjusted to provide the optimum therapeutic response. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the exact amounts and rates of administration of the probiotic microorganisms will depend on a number of factors such as the particular composition being administered, the age, body weight, general health, sex and dietary requirements of the subject, as well as any drugs or agents used in combination or coincidental with the compositions. For example, several divided doses may be administered hourly, daily, weekly, monthly or at other suitable time intervals or the dose may be proportionally reduced as indicated by the exigencies of the situation. Based on the teaching herein those skilled in the art will, by routine trial and experimentation, be capable of determining suitable dosage regimes on a case-by-case basis. [00106] In general, compositions of the present disclosure may be administered in any suitable dose amount that is effective as a health supplement, food supplement, food additive, and/or therapeutic agent to achieve the desired health outcome. In some embodiments, an effective dose of a composition may be in a range of from 1 g to 30 g for an adult subject per day, between about 2 g and about 20 g per day, or between about 5 g and about 15 g per day. Pediatric dosages may be in the range of 15% to 90% of adult dosages. In therapeutic applications a constant dosage of the composition can be administered over time. [00107] For the various circumstances in which a composition of the present disclosure may be administered, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the amount of the consumed, and the number of discreet consumptions per unit time will vary depending on the actual use to which the composition is put, the condition of the subject who will consume the beverage, the subject's age, sex, weight and general health. Typically, several doses may be administered in hourly, daily, twice daily or at other suitable time intervals, and/or the dose may be proportionally reduced or increased as indicated by the exigencies of the situation. In exemplary embodiments disclosed herein, where the composition is provided in capsule form, a daily dose may comprise one or two capsules. [00108] Compositions and methods of the present disclosure may be employed as an adjunct to other therapies or treatments for metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, obesity and obesity-related disorders. Accordingly compositions and methods disclosed herein may be coadministered with other agents that may facilitate a desired therapeutic outcome, for example one more cardiovascular or anti-obesity drugs. By "co-administered" is meant simultaneous administration in the same formulation or in two different formulations via the same or different routes or sequential administration by the same or different routes. By "sequential" administration is meant a time difference of from seconds, minutes, hours or days between the administration of the agents, compositions or treatments. Sequential administration may be in any order. [00109] The reference in this specification to any prior publication (or information derived from it), or to any matter which is known, is not, and should not be taken as an acknowledgment or admission or any form of suggestion that that prior publication (or information derived from it) or known matter forms part of the common general knowledge in the field of endeavour to which this specification relates. [00110] The present disclosure will now be described with reference to the following specific examples, which should not be construed as in any way limiting the scope of the invention. Examples [00111] The following examples are illustrative of the invention and should not be construed as limiting in any way the general nature of the disclosure of the description throughout this specification. Example 1 - Attenuation of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in mice fed a high fat diet [00112] The inventors investigated the effect of a multi-strain probiotic preparation containing a combination of probiotic strains including Bifidobacteria and Lactobacilli species and a Streptococcus species in a mouse model of high fat diet/obesity induced liver steatosis. Study design [00113] Mice were fed either a standard chow diet or a high fat diet (HFD) for a total of 20 weeks. At the end of week 10, the HFD group of mice were divided into 2 groups and probiotics were added to the drinking water for the remaining 10 weeks for one group of mice. At the end of week 20 all mice were euthanized, dissected and samples stored for later analysis. Animals [00114] Young wild type (WT) mice on a C57B 1/6J background were randomly divided into one of three groups: 1) a control group, receiving a standard diet (n=10); 2) a HFD fed group (n=10); and 3) HFD fed group supplemented with probiotics (n=10; 1 x 10 8-"9 Colony Forming Units (CFU)/mL). All animals were housed in a SPF facility maintained at 20Â°C on a 12 hour light/dark cycle with access to clean water and food. Bacterial Strains [00115] The multi-strain probiotic preparation consisted of nine strains of probiotics represented here as percentages of total CFU/mL: Lactobacillus rhamnosus / Lactobacillus casei I Lactobacillus acidophilus / Lactobacillus plantarum / Lactobacillus fermentum comprised 87% of the total colony forming units; Bifidobacterium lactis / Bifidobacterium breve / Bifidobacterium bifidum comprised 13% of the total colony forming units; and Streptococcus thermophilus comprised 5% of the total colony forming units. All strains were lyophilized, water soluble and added to the drinking water as a combination probiotic. The total concentration of probiotic blend added to the drinking water was 1 x 10 8-"9 CFU/mL. This dosage was chosen as it represents a dose per kilogram of body mass equivalent for a human. Diet [00116] The standard chow and HFD were purchased from Specialty Feeds (WA, Australia; HFD product no. SF03-020). The chow diet contained 4.8% total fat (mono unsaturated fat 2%, polyunsaturated fat 1.77% and saturated fat 0.74%) providing 14 MJ/Kg of energy while the HFD contained 23% total fat (mono unsaturated fat 7.59%, polyunsaturated fat 2.04% and saturated fat 12.6%) providing 20 MJ/Kg of energy. Dissection [00117] At the end of week 20, mice were anaesthetized using an intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital and xylene. Once anaesthetized, blood was collected using a cardiac puncture and allowed to clot at room temperature before serum was removed and stored. Tissue was collected by first removing the pancreas followed by the liver, fat pads, thigh muscle, small intestine, large intestine, spleen and the heart. The mass of the liver and fat pads was recorded. Tissue samples from the different sites were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, fixed in OCT fluid or placed in formalin for histology. Tissue placed in formalin for fixing was transferred to a 70% ethanol solution after 24 hrs. Large Intestine / Swiss Roll [00118] The large intestine was cut longitudinally from the caecum to the rectum and opened. The intestinal tract was cleared of faecal matter using a cotton bud and cut longitudinally down the centre again providing two separate longitudinal segments. One segment was carefully rolled on a wooden toothpick starting from the colon end with the mucosa on the outside of the roll. The resulting roll was then carefully placed in formalin for histology. The second segment was cut into two or three pieces and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Blood Biochemistry [00119] Serum was analysed spectrophotometrically for alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), albumin, glucose, cholesterol and triglycerides. Analysis was performed using a Cobas Integra 400, reagents and calibrators supplied by Roche Diagnostics (NSW, Australia). Hepatic Triglycerides Quanitification [00120] Liver tissue was homogenized in a 1.5% potassium chloride solution (2.3 g KC1 in 200 mL water). 500 Î¼Î of homogenate was extracted using a 2: 1 chloroform/methanol mixture. Extracts were dried and stored at -80Â°C until analysis. For analysis, samples were reconstituted using 2% triton-x with the aid of sonication. Samples were further diluted with 2% triton-x for a final concentration of 1:6 ready for analysis. Samples were measured spectrophotometrically (Cobas Mira, Roche Diagnostics, Australia) using a kit and calibrators supplied by Novachem (Victoria, Australia). Protein Quantification [00121] Proteins were measured as per manufacturer's direction using a Pierce BCA protein assay kit supplied by Thermo Scientific (Victoria, Australia). Tight Junction Proteins - ZO-1, ZO-2 [00122] Tight junction proteins zonulin occludens 1 (ZO-1) and ZO-2 rabbit anti-human polyclonal antibodies were purchased from Lifespan Biosciences (WA, USA). A polymer HRP anti-rabbit secondary antibody was purchased from Daco (Vic, Australia). ZO-1 and ZO-2 were analysed on large intestine swiss roll histology slides as per manufacturer's direction. Optimisation of the antibodies gave optimal concentrations of 2.5 Î¼g/ml and 10 Î¼g/ml for ZO- 1 and ZO-2 respectively. Histological Scoring [00123] Histology was blindly scored on large intestinal swiss roll sections with ZO-1 and ZO-2 staining and liver sections with H and E and oil red O staining. Swiss rolls were scored for the expression of ZO-1 and ZO-2. Liver sections were scored for diagnosis, NAFLD activity score, steatosis grade and percentage, portal inflammation, lobular inflammation and ballooning, mallory's hyaline, fibrosis stage, portal score and centrilobular score. Statistical analysis [00124] All data is presented as mean + standard deviation unless otherwise stated. Data was tested for normality of the distribution, and analysis was performed with the statistical software GraphPad Prism. Comparison between groups was carried out using a 1-way analysis of variance with a Tukey's multiple comparison post hoc test or a Kruskal-Wallis test for non- parametric data with a Dunn's multiple comparisons post hoc test of significance between individual groups. Differences were considered significant when P was less than 0.05 (* = P < 0.05; # = p < 0.01; Â§ = p < 0.001). All significant differences between groups were determined using the HFD group as the reference group. Results [00125] Histological examination of the large intestine Swiss rolls for tight junction proteins ZO-1 and ZO-2 showed mice fed a HFD had reduced expression for ZO-1(0.01+0.01 vs. 0.38+0.08) and ZO-2 (0.17+0.08 vs. 0.81+0.19) compared to the chow group. Mice fed a HFD and supplemented with probiotics showed significant recovery in ZO-1 (0.24+0.04 vs. 0.01+0.01) and ZO-2 (0.44+0.12 vs. 0.17+0.08) compared to high fat fed mice (Figure 1A-C and Figure 2). Histological examination of livers from HFD mice demonstrated the development of steatosis with large fat droplets present. Chow fed mice showed no steatosis development (Table 1) or fat droplet accumulation. Compared to mice fed a HFD, mice fed a HFD and supplemented with probiotics showed a reduction in steatosis grade (2.44 + 0.73 and 2.00 + 1.25 respectively; p = 0.50) and steatosis percentage (72.78% + 27.17 & 59.2% + 38.74; p = 0.9) respectively (Table 1) and visible reductions in fat droplets (Figure 3A-C). Without wishing to be bound by theory, the inventors suggest that the reduction in fat deposits observed in mice fed a HFD and supplemented with probiotics may be due to, or influenced by, the ability of the probiotic strains to alleviate gut dysbiosis (a gut barrier associated abnormality that increases permeability) and restore, in whole or in part, homeostasis in the gastrointestinal tract. Table 1: Liver histology grading HFD + Chow HFD probiotics (n= =9) (n= =9) (n= =10) Steatosis Grade 0.0 Î® : 0.0 2.4 + 0.7* 2.0 + 1.3* Steatosis % 0.1 : 0.3 72.8 + 27.2* 59.2 + 38.7* Portal Inflammation 0.0 : 0.0 0.2 4 -. 0Î 0.0 4 : 0.0 Lobular Inflammation 0.6 4 : 0.7 1.9 + 0.9* 1.7 4 : 1.1 Ballooning 0.2 4 : 0.4 1.3 + 0.7* 1.1 + 0.6* [00126] Confirming liver histology scores and observation, mice supplemented with probiotics had a two and a half fold reduction in hepatic triglyceride concentrations compared to HFD mice (Figure 4; p<0.001). [00127] After the removal of outliers, serum ALT and AST concentrations were significantly reduced in HFD mice with probiotic supplementation compared to HFD fed mice (Figure 5; p<0.05). As shown in Figure 6, fat pad mass in the HFD mice and in mice fed the HFD supplemented with probiotics was significantly greater than in the chow fed mice (0.90 + 0.33, 2.60 + 0.47 and 2.14 + 0.56; p <0.01), while the reduction in fat pad mass in mice fed the HFD supplemented with probiotics versus HFD mice was also statistically significant. [00128] The results of this study demonstrate that mice fed a HFD followed by the administration of a multi-strain probiotic formulation maintained tight junction proteins (i.e., decreased intestinal epithelial cell permeability) and reduced hepatic triglyceride concentrations compared to mice fed a HFD alone. Furthermore, the study demonstrated that supplementation with a multi-strain probiotic preparation non-significantly reduced the effects of a HFD by attenuating the progression of steatosis / NAFLD as evidenced in part from liver tissue histology, with more than half the mice showing visible reductions in fat droplets. [00129] Histological analysis of the large intestine showed that the administration of probiotics partly preserved the HFD induced sub-optimal expression of tight junction protein ZO-1 and ZO-2. Without wishing to be bound by theory, the inventors suggest that by maintaining the integrity of the gastrointestinal tract epithelial layer through the administration of probiotics, the liver may have been spared further development / progression of NAFLD, and hypothesise that this is in part the result of reducing the inflammatory response that a HFD triggered dysbiotic gastrointestinal tract would promote from the effects of exogenous pathogens / pathobiont and by-product translocations across the epithelial gut barrier.
