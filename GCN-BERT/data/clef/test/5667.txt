Step 1: Benzyl 4-((tosyloxy)methyl)piperidine-1-carboxylate
A stirred solution of benzyl 4-(hydroxymethyl)piperidine-1-carboxylate (49.86 g, 200 mmol) in anhydrous pyridine (200 mL) at 0° C. under nitrogen was added with portionwise p-toluenesulfonyl chloride (41.94 g, 220 mmol). The reaction was stirred at 0° C. for 100 minutes before warming to room temperature. After 18 hours the reaction mixture was re-cooled to 0° C. and aqueous saturated aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate was cautiously added. The resultant suspension was stirred at room temperature for 4 hours. The suspension was filtered and the filter cake washed with water. The solid was dried under vacuum in the presence of P2O5 to afford the title compound (76.47 g, 95%).
