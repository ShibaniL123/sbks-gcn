The third step
To a solution of Compound 30 (80mg, 0.181mmol) in pyridine (0.5 mL) was added methanesulfonic anhydride (63.2 mg, 0.363 mmol), and the mixture was stirred for 1 hour at room temperature. The reaction mixture was extracted with chloroform after addition of 2 mol / L hydrochloric acid. The organic layer was washed with water, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and concentrated under reduced pressure by an evaporator. The resulting residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (chloroform-methanol) to yield Compound 31 (87.1mg, yield 93%).
