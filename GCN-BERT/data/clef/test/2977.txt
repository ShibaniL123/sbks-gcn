SOLID COLORANT FOR TINTING PAINT The invention relates to solid colorants for tinting paint compositions, a method to prepare the solid colorants and use of the solid colorants. Architectural paint and stain manufacturers typically distribute premixed paints and stains in a small number of popular colors. To accommodate consumer desires and enable matching of existing painted or stained surfaces, manufacturers typically also distribute a set of tintable paints and several concentrated colorants. These are combined at point-of- sale outlets using colorant dispensing and shaker mixing equipment to make small batch lots of custom-tinted paint in a much larger array of colors than the limited color array available in premixed products. The custom color systems from different paint manufacturers tend to have somewhat similar components. For example, a typical custom color paint system may employ several (e.g., 2 to 4) tintable paints ranging for example from a white base intended to accept at most a small quantity of colorant, to a relatively unpigmented clear base intended to accept a much larger quantity of colorant. Base paints may employ various binders (e.g., natural or synthetic resins), binder forms (e.g., solution polymers or latex polymers) and vehicles (e.g., solvent-borne or water-borne versions), and may provide various dried surface finishes (e.g., matt, semi-gloss or gloss finishes). Some manufacturers also sell colored base paints (e.g. a red, a blue and yellow colored base) which are intended to be combined with additional colorant(s) when one coat hiding power is desired for strongly-tinted custom paint shades. The colorants in custom color paint or stain systems may, for example, be volumetrically metered from a multiple-colorant dispensing station, with 12 colorants for paint or stain typically being employed in colorant dispensing stations for the U.S. market, and more (e.g., 16 or 24 colorants) sometimes being employed in other markets. WO2010091418 describes liquid colorants that can be used in tinting systems. Disadvantage of liquid tinting systems is the difficulty to keep the working places clean and prevent infection of mould, the phase separation of the pigments in the liquid tinting systems, which will result in inaccurate dosing of pigments and fouling of the dosing system, and the problem of evaporation of solvents, which will change the concentration of the liquid colorant and the viscosity of the liquid colorant, making the dosing inaccurate. WO0047681 , EP 1474485, US7318864 and WO09074576 disclose solid pigment preparations that can be used to color paints. These solid pigment preparations are prepared in a spray drying process. US2001/0055639 describes a process to prepare a granular product. A suspension of particles is sprayed by means of a two-fluid nozzle into liquid nitrogen. The granular product has a broad or even bimodal particle size distribution. US201 1/0262654 describes a process for making porous particles, by electrospraying a suspension of particles, collecting droplets in liquid nitrogen and then drying in vacuum. Irregular particles have been obtained. EP0191 125 describes a method to prepare solid particles by shock cooling of particles and subsequent drying of the particles by sublimation. DE19914329 describes a method to prepare solid particles by spray drying. EP1 103173 describes a method to prepare solid pigment particles by spray drying. All above methods prepare particles which have either an irregular shape, and/or a broad particle size distribution. The particles prepared in a spray drying process have a number of disadvantages. They show a broad particle size distribution, contain a considerable amount of dust and turn out to be mechanically instable. The broad particle size distribution makes it necessary to include a sieving step in the process to produce the particles, which makes the process expensive and results in a low yield of suitable product. Even after sieving, the particle size distribution is still broad which causes several problems. The smaller particles (typically having a particle size below 100 μηη) tend to agglomerate to aggregates that are mechanically instable and show a variable bulk density. After agglomeration the bulk density may be locally increased. At the same time small particles and large particles may show percolation, which means that the particles separate from each other: small particles drift to the lower part of a container, while larger particles tend to float on top of the smaller particles. This separation causes differences in bulk density and gives an irregular flow behavior of the particles. Moreover the particles obtained in a spray drying process do not have a regular circular shape: many particles have the shape of a 'donut'. The 'donut' shape causes an increased cohesion between the particles, which has a negative influence on the flowability of the particles and influences the bulk density. The solid pigment preparations of the prior art need to be dosed to base paint compositions in a gravimetric manner, due to the broad particle size distribution and other properties. Gravimetric dosing is usually carried out by weighing a container comprising the base paint compositions and determining the addition of the pigment preparation to the total weight of the base paint. This is complex, especially when only small amounts of solid pigment preparations should be dosed. In such cases, small variations in the environment (like vibrations and air turbulence) can cause large measuring errors, which will generate colored paint compositions that are out of specification in color. Also gravimetric measurement of the pigments means that all pigments should be dosed in a sequential manner, since each pigment should be dosed individually. There is a need for solid colorants that can be used in tinting systems and can overcome one or more of the problems associated with the present tinting systems. After extensive studies, the inventors solved the above mentioned problems and developed new solid colorants that can be favorably used in tinting systems for tinting base paint compositions. Summary of the invention The invention relates to a solid colorant comprising a) 30-97 wt% of a pigment b) less than 5 wt% of a solvent c) 3-40 wt% surfactants and wherein the ratio S/A [standard deviation of the particle size distribution/average particle size] of the solid colorant is <25%, preferably <22% and more preferably <20%, and wherein wt% is relative to the total weight of the solid colorant, and wherein the particle size distribution is determined with light scattering with fully automated image analysis according to ISO 13322-1 Static image analysis First edition 2004-12-01 by the use of the OCCHIO ZEPHYR ESR analyzer. Preferably the solid colorant has an average particle size between 400 and 1400 micron (μηη), preferably between 500 and 1300 μηη, more preferably between 600 and 1000 Mm. The particle size distribution (PSD), the standard deviation (Std dev) of the PSD and average particle size (= average sphere diameter) are determined with light scattering with fully automated image analysis according to ISO 13322-1 Static image analysis First edition 2004-12-01 by the use of the OCCHIO ZEPHYR ESR analyzer. In a preferred embodiment the solid colorant comprises a) 50-95 wt% of a pigment b) Less than 3 wt% of a solvent c) 5-30 wt% surfactants d) 0.1 -5 wt% additives e) 0-20 wt% colorless filler f) 0-10wt% binder wherein the ratio S/A [Std dev of the particle size distribution / average particle size] of the solid colorant is <25%, preferably <22% and more preferably <20%, wherein the solid colorant has an average particle size between 400 and 1400 μηη, preferably between 500 and 1300 μηη, more preferably between 600 and 1000 μηη, and wherein wt% is relative to the total weight of the solid colorant. The solid colorant according to the invention has a surprisingly narrow particle size distribution relative to solid colorants prepared according to spray drying as known from the prior art. Moreover the colorants show a fast deployment of the intrinsic color strength which is an indication of a fast dispersion into aqueous or organic solvent based base paints to obtain tinted base paints. The solid colorant according to the present invention has a high mechanical stability and a narrow particle size distribution, which makes it possible to add the solid colorant to a base paint in a volumetric manner, instead to the known gravimetric dosing of solid colorants to base paint compositions. The amount of solid material in the solid colorants is determined with Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) method using Kern MLS analyzer equipment. The solid content (%) is 100% - moisture content (%). The solid material in the solid colorants consists essentially of pigments, colorless filler materials and surfactants. Preferably the amount of solid material ranges between 95 and 99.9 wt%, more preferably between 98 and 99,9 wt%, relative to the weight of the solid colorant. A colorant is any substance (e.g. a dye, pigment, ink, or paint) that impacts color or modifies the hue of something else. A solid colorant is a solid composition, which can be added to a point- of sale container whose interior volume is largely (e.g. two thirds of the container volume or more) but not completely already filled with a base paint so as to alter the hue or lightness of such base paint, and which composition contains pigment or dye. The pigments used in the solid colorants according to the invention can be inorganic or organic in nature and can, for example, be chosen from metal oxides formed from a variety of metals, e.g., from aluminum, antimony, bismuth, boron, chromium, cobalt, gallium, indium, iron, lanthanum, lithium, magnesium, manganese, molybdenum, neodymium, nickel, niobium, silicon, tin, titanium, vanadium or zinc. It will be appreciated that the pigment component may also comprise mixtures of various organic or various inorganic pigments or mixtures of organic and inorganic pigments. The pigment component may comprise one or more pigments. It will be appreciated that mixtures of two or more pigments can also be used. The pigments are present in finely divided form. Accordingly, their median particle size is typically in the range from 0.01 to 5 μηη. The inorganic pigments used can be chromatic, black and white pigments (color pigments) and also luster pigments.

Luster pigments are platelet-shaped pigments having a monophasic or polyphasic construction whose color play is marked by the interplay of interference, reflection and absorption phenomena. Examples are aluminum platelets and aluminum, iron oxide and mica platelets bearing one or more coats, especially of metal oxides. The pigments are preferably chosen from the oxides/hydroxides pigments, mixed metal oxides pigments, carbon black pigments, monoazos, naphtol AS, benzimidazolone, isoindolin(one)e and polycyclic pigments. The solvent component can consist of one or more solvents which are preferably at least partly miscible. Preferred solvents are water, alcohols and glycols, such as ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, higher glycols and mixtures thereof. Preferably the solvent contains water. Preferably the amount of solvent in the solid colorant is low, for example less than 5 wt%, preferably less than 3 wt% more preferably less than 2.5 wt%, relative to the total weight of the solid colorant. The surfactant component in the solid colorant may comprise one or more surfactants. The choice of surfactant type is especially dependent on the choice of pigment and also the desired color. Surfactants are compounds that lower the surface tension of a liquid, the interfacial tension between two liquids, or the interfacial tension between a liquid and a solid. In solutions this behavior is known as wetting, and it occurs as a result of surfactants adsorbing to the air/water interface. Surfactants may act as detergents, wetting agents, emulsifiers, foaming agents, and dispersants. Surfactants are used to stabilize the dispersion of polymer particles during emulsion polymerization in paints and other applications. The mechanical stability, freeze-thaw stability and shelf-life of paints are all improved by the addition of surfactants. Useful surfactants are in particular nonionic and/or anionic water-soluble surface- active additives. Particularly suitable nonionic surfactants are based on polyethers. As well as the unmixed polyalkylene oxides, preferably C2-C4-alkylene oxides and phenyl- substituted C2-C4-alkylene oxides, especially polyethylene oxides, polypropylene oxides and poly(phenylethylene oxide)s, it is in particular block copolymers, especially polymers having polypropylene oxide and polyethylene oxide blocks or poly(phenylethylene oxide) and polyethylene oxide blocks, and also random copolymers of these alkylene oxides which are suitable. These polyalkylene oxides are obtainable by polyaddition of alkylene oxides onto starter molecules such as saturated or unsaturated aliphatic and aromatic alcohols, saturated or unsaturated aliphatic and aromatic amines, saturated or unsaturated aliphatic carboxylic acids and carboxamides and also aromatic carboxamides and sulfonamides. Aromatic starter molecules may be substituted by CrC20-alkyl or C7-C30- aralkyl. It is customary to use from 1 to 300 mol and preferably from 3 to 150 mol of alkylene oxide per mole of starter molecule, although in the case of aromatic starter molecules the amounts of alkylene oxide are in particular in the range from 2 to 100 mol, preferably in the range from 5 to 50 mol and especially in the range from 10 to 30 mol. The polyaddition products may have a terminal OH group or be end group capped, being in the form of CrC6-alkyl ethers for example. Suitable aliphatic alcohols comprise in general from 6 to 26 carbon atoms and preferably from 8 to 18 carbon atoms and can have an unbranched, branched or cyclic structure. Examples are octanol, nonanol, decanol, isodecanol, undecanol, dodecanol, 2- butyloctanol, tridecanol, isotridecanol, tetradecanol, pentadecanol, hexadecanol (cetyl alcohol), 2-hexyldecanol, heptadecanol, octadecanol (stearyl alcohol), 2-heptyl-undecanol, 2-octyldecanol, 2-nonyltridecanol, 2-decyltetradecanol, oleyl alcohol and 9-octadecenol and also mixtures of these alcohols, such as C8/Ci0, Ci3 Ci5 and Ci6 Ci8 alcohols, and cyclopentanol and cyclohexanol. Of particular interest are the saturated and unsaturated fatty alcohols obtained from natural raw materials by lipolysis and reduction and the synthetic fatty alcohols from the oxo process. The alkylene oxide adducts with these alcohols typically have average molecular weights Mn from 200 to 5000. Examples of the above-mentioned aromatic alcohols include not only unsubstituted phenol and a- and β-naphthol but also the alkyl-substituted products, which are substituted in particular by C Ci2-alkyl, preferably C4-Ci2-alkyl or d-C4-alkyl, and the aralkyl- substituted products, in particular C7-C30-aralkyl-substituted phenol, such as hexylphenol, heptylphenol, octylphenol, nonylphenol, isononylphenol, undecylphenol, dodecylphenol, di- and tributylphenol and dinonylphenol, and also bisphenol A and its reaction products with styrene, in particular bisphenol A substituted by a total of 4 phenyl-1 -ethyl radicals in the ortho positions to the two OH groups. Suitable aliphatic amines correspond to the above-mentioned aliphatic alcohols. Again of particular importance here are the saturated and unsaturated fatty amines which preferably have from 14 to 20 carbon atoms. Examples of aromatic amines are aniline and its derivatives. Useful aliphatic carboxylic acids include especially saturated and unsaturated fatty acids which preferably comprise from 14 to 20 carbon atoms and fully hydrogenated, partially hydrogenated and unhydrogenated resin acids and also polyfunctional carboxylic acids, for example dicarboxylic acids, such as maleic acid. Suitable carboxamides are derived from these carboxylic acids. As well as alkylene oxide adducts with monofunctional amines and alcohols it is alkylene oxide adducts with at least bifunctional amines and alcohols which are of very particular interest. The at least bifunctional amines preferably have from 2 to 5 amine groups and conform in particular to the formula H2N--(R --NR2)n--H(R1 : C2-C6-alkylene; R2: hydrogen or C C6- alkyl; n: 1 -5). Specific examples are: ethylenediamine, diethylenetriamine, triethylene- tetramine, tetraethylenepentamine, 1 ,3-propylenediamine, dipropylenetriamine, 3-amino-1 - ethyleneaminopropane, hexamethylenediamine, dihexamethylenetriamine, 1 ,6-bis(3- aminopropylamino)hexane and N-methyldipropylenetriamine, of which hexamethylenediamine and diethylenetriamine are more preferable and ethylenediamine is most preferable. These amines are preferably reacted first with propylene oxide and then with ethylene oxide. The ethylene oxide content of the block copolymers is typically about 10% to 90% by weight. The average molecular weights Mn of the block copolymers based on polyfunctional amines are generally in the range from 1000 to 40.000 and preferably in the range from 1500 to 30.000. The at least bifunctional alcohols preferably have from two to five hydroxyl groups. Examples are C2-C6-alkylene glycols and the corresponding di- and polyalkylene glycols, such as ethylene glycol, 1 ,2-propylene glycol, 1 ,3-propylene glycol, 1 ,2-butylene glycol, 1 ,4-butylene glycol, 1 ,6-hexylene glycol, dipropylene glycol and polyethylene glycol, glycerol and pentaerythritol, of which ethylene glycol and polyethylene glycol are more preferable and propylene glycol and dipropylene glycol are most preferable. Particularly preferred alkylene oxide adducts with at least bifunctional alcohols have a central polypropylene oxide block, i.e. are based on a propylene glycol or polypropylene glycol which is initially reacted with further propylene oxide and then with ethylene oxide. The ethylene oxide content of the block copolymers is typically in the range from 10% to 90% by weight. The average molecular weights Mn of the block copolymers based on polyhydric alcohols are generally in the range from 1000 to 20.000 and preferably in the range from 1000 to 15.000. Such nonionic surface-active additives are known and commercially available for example under the names of Tetronic®, Pluronic® and Pluriol® (BASF), Atlas®, Symperonic, (Uniquema), Emulgator WN and 386 (Lanxess) and also Rhodasurf, Soprophor® (Rhodia), Genopol (Clariant), Dowfax (Dow), Berol, Duomeen, Ethomeen (Akzo), Ethylan, (Akcros). Examples of the water-soluble anionic surface-active agents which are particularly useful are additives based on polymers of ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acids, additives based on polyurethanes , additives based on acidic phosphoric, phosphonic, sulfuric and/or sulfonic esters of the abovementioned polyethers and additives based on polycondensation products of aromatic sulfonic acids and formaldehyde. It will be appreciated that it is also possible to use mixtures of a plurality of additives, i.e., not only mixtures of various nonionic additives but also mixtures of various anionic additives and also mixtures of nonionic and anionic additives. Useful water-soluble anionic surface-active additives based on polymers of unsaturated carboxylic acids are particularly additives from the group of the homo- and copolymers of ethylenically unsaturated monocarboxylic acids and/or ethylenically unsaturated dicarboxylic acids, which may each further comprise interpolymerized vinyl monomers comprising no acid function, the alkoxylation products of these homo- and copolymers and the salts of these homo- and copolymers and their alkoxylation products. As examples of carboxyl-containing monomers and of vinyl monomers there may be mentioned: acrylic acid, methacrylic acid and crotonic acid; maleic acid, maleic anhydride, maleic monoesters, maleic monoamides, reaction products of maleic acid with diamines, which may be oxidized to form derivatives comprising amine oxide groups, and fumaric acid, of which maleic acid, maleic anhydride and maleic monoamides are preferred; vinylaromatics, such as styrene, methylstyrene and vinyltoluene; ethylene, propylene, isobutene, diisobutene and butadiene; vinyl ethers, such as polyethylene glycol monovinyl ether; vinyl esters of linear or branched monocarboxylic acids, such as vinyl acetate and vinyl propionate; alkyl esters and aryl esters of ethylenically unsaturated monocarboxylic acids, in particular acrylic and methacrylic esters, such as methyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate, propyl acrylate, isopropyl acrylate, butyl acrylate, pentyl acrylate, hexyl acrylate, 2- ethylhexyl acrylate, nonyl acrylate, lauryl acrylate, hydroxyethyl acrylate, methyl methacrylate, ethyl methacrylate, propyl methacrylate, isopropyl methacrylate, butyl methacrylate, pentyl methacrylate, hexyl methacrylate, 2-ethylhexyl methacrylate, nonyl methacrylate, lauryl methacrylate and hydroxyethyl methacrylate and also phenyl acrylate, phenyl methacrylate, naphthyl acrylate, naphthyl methacrylate, benzyl acrylate and benzyl methacrylate; dialkyl esters of ethylenically unsaturated dicarboxylic acids, such as dimethyl maleate, diethyl maleate, dipropyl maleate, diisopropyl maleate, dibutyl maleate, dipentyl maleate, dihexyl maleate, di-2-ethylhexyl maleate, dinonyl maleate, dilauryl maleate, di-2-hydroxyethyl maleate, dimethyl fumarate, diethyl fumarate, dipropyl fumarate, diisopropyl fumarate, dibutyl fumarate, dipentyl fumarate, dihexyl fumarate, di-2- ethylhexyl fumarate, dinonyl fumarate, dilauryl fumarate, di-2-hydroxyethyl fumarate; vinylpyrrolidone; acrylonitrile and methacrylonitrile; of which styrene, isobutene, diisobutene, acrylic esters and polyethylene glycol monovinyl ether are preferred. Polyacrylic acids in particular are to be mentioned as examples of preferred homo- polymers of these monomers. The copolymers of the monomers mentioned may be constructed of two or more and in particular three different monomers. The copolymers may be random, alternating, block or graft. Preferred copolymers are styrene-acrylic acid, acrylic acid-maleic acid, acrylic acid- methacrylic acid, butadiene-acrylic acid, isobutene-maleic acid, diisobutene-maleic acid and styrene-maleic acid copolymers, which may each comprise acrylic esters and/or maleic esters as additional monomeric constituents. Preferably, the carboxyl groups of nonalkoxylated homo- and copolymers are wholly or partly present in salt form in order that solubility in water may be ensured. The alkali metal salts, such as sodium and potassium salts, and the ammonium salts are suitable for example. The nonalkoxylated polymeric additives will typically have average molecular weights Mw in the range from 900 to 250 000. The molecular weight ranges particularly suitable for the individual polymers depend on their composition, of course. The molecular weight data which follow for various polymers are given by way of example: polyacrylic acids: Mw from 900 to 250 000; styrene-acrylic acid copolymers: Mw from 1000 to 50 000; acrylic acid- methacrylic acid copolymers: Mw from 1000 to 250 000; acrylic acid-maleic acid copolymers: Mw from 2000 to 70 000. As well as these homo- and copolymers themselves, their alkoxylation products are also of particular interest for use as additives. These alkoxylation products are in particular polymers formed by partial to (if possible) complete esterification with polyether alcohols. The degree of esterification of these polymers is generally in the range from 30 to 80 mol %. Useful polyether alcohols for the esterification are in particular alcohols such as ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, butanol, fatty alcohols, the polyether alcohols themselves, preferably polyethylene glycols and polypropylene glycols, and also their unilaterally end- capped derivatives, in particular the corresponding monoethers, such as monoaryl ethers, for example monophenyl ethers, and in particular mono-CrC26-alkyl ethers, for example ethylene and propylene glycols etherified with fatty alcohols, and the polyetheramines which are preparable for example by conversion of a terminal OH group of the corresponding polyether alcohols or by polyaddition of alkylene oxides onto preferably primary aliphatic amines. Preference here is given to polyethylene glycols, polyethylene glycol monoethers and polyetheramines. The average molecular weights Mn of the polyether alcohols used and of their derivatives are typically in the range from 200 to 10 000. Specific surface-active properties can be achieved for the additives by varying the ratio of polar to apolar groups. These anionic surface-active additives are likewise known and commercially available, for example under the names Sokalan® (BASF), Joncryl® (Johnson Polymer), Alcosperse® (Alco), Geropon® (Rhodia), Good-Rite® (Goodrich), Neoresin® (Avecia), Orotan® and Morez® (Rohm & Haas), Disperbyk® (Byk) and also Tegospers® (Degussa). Useful anionic surface-active additives for inclusion in these pigment preparations further include polyurethane-based additives. For the purposes of the present invention, the term "polyurethane" shall comprehend not just the pure reaction products of polyfunctional isocyanates with isocyanate-reactive hydroxyl-comprising organic compounds, but also these reaction products after additional functionalization through the addition of further isocyanate-reactive compounds, examples being carboxylic acids bearing primary or secondary amino groups. These additives are notable for their low ionic conductivity and their neutral pH compared with other surface- active additives. Useful polyfunctional isocyanates for preparing the additives are in particular diisocyanates, but compounds having three or four isocyanate groups can be used as well. Both aromatic and aliphatic isocyanates may be used.

The amount of defoaming agent is between 0.1 and 2 wt%, preferably between 0.1 and 1 wt%, more preferably between 0.1 and 0.5 wt%, relative to the total weight of the liquid pigment dispersion. The liquid pigment dispersion may contain a small amount of biocides (between 0.01 and 0.5 wt%, relative to the total weight of the liquid pigment dispersion). Biocides can be added to the liquid pigment dispersion to protect them against biological infestation and growth. The solid colorant according to the invention can contain colorless fillers. The fillers are usually insoluble in the solvent and are selected in particular from the following chemical classes (not only products of natural origin but also products of synthetic origin being recited by way of example): oxides and hydroxides: natural: aluminum oxide and magnesium oxide; synthetic: aluminum hydroxide and magnesium hydroxide; silicon dioxide and silicates: natural: quartz, christobalite, kieselguhr, talc, kaolin, diatomaceous earth, mica, wollastonite and feldspar; synthetic: fumed silica, precipitated silica, aluminosilicates and calcined aluminosilicates; carbonates: natural: carbonates of calcium and of magnesium, such as calcite, chalk, dolomite and magnesite; synthetic: precipitated calcium carbonate; sulfates: natural: sulfates of barium and of calcium, such as barite and gypsum; synthetic: precipitated barium sulfate.

The amount of binder is between 0 and 15 wt%, or for example 1 and 10 wt%, or 3 and 7 wt%, relative to the total weight of the solid colorant. The glass transition temperature for the polymeric binder may for example be about -20 to about +60 eC. The invention also relates to a liquid pigment dispersion which can be used to prepare the solid colorant according to the invention. The liquid pigment dispersion comprises a) 15 - 75 wt% of a pigment b) 20 - 70 wt% of solvent c) 5 - 30 wt% surfactant wherein the wt% is relative to the total weight of the liquid pigment dispersion.

The pigment, solvent, surfactant, colorless filler and additives are as defined above for the solid colorant. The invention also relates to a process for making a solid colorant. The process for making the solid colorant according to the invention comprises the following steps: a) Providing a liquid pigment dispersion containing at least pigment, solvent and surfactants, b) spraying of the liquid pigment dispersion to obtain droplets of liquid pigment dispersion c) Freezing of the droplets of liquid pigment dispersion to obtain a frozen colorant d) Freeze drying the frozen colorant to obtain the solid colorant. Preferably the droplets prepared in step b) are uniform of size. Preferably the droplets are frozen in step c) before contact between individual droplets can occur, in order to prevent agglomeration of droplets. Preferably the solvent is water. The spraying of the liquid pigment dispersion can be performed by any means. Spraying is usually performed by using a spray nozzle. In the spray nozzle the liquid pigment dispersion is atomized, breaking up of the liquid pigment dispersion into droplets. Spray nozzles can have one or more outlets. Examples of spray nozzles are single fluid nozzles, two fluid nozzles, vibrating nozzles, rotary atomizers and ultrasonic atomizers. Spraying is preferably performed by using a vibrating spray nozzle. The vibrating spray nozzle has a nozzle diameter between 0.1 -0.4 mm, preferably between 0.15 and 0.35 mm, more preferably between 0.18 and 0.32 mm. Vibration takes place typically with a frequency between 100 and 5000 Hz, preferably between 200 and 2000 Hz, more preferably between 500 and 1200 Hz. It is preferable, that the spraying provides uniform droplets. The droplet size is, for example, between 100 and 5000 μηη, preferably between 400 and 1400 μηη, more preferably between 500 and 1300 μηη or between 600 and 1000 μηη. The droplets of liquid dispersion preferably are frozen before they can contact each other and start agglomerating again. For this purpose, a fast cooling step is preferred, which allows the individual droplets to solidify and prevent agglomeration of the individual droplets. Fast cooling can preferably be conducted with a low temperature gas.. Air may be cooled with chillers, with liquid carbon dioxide or with other means. The low temperature gas preferably has a temperature between -10 and -200 °C, more preferably between -60 and -150 °C , or between -50 and -100 °C. Preferably a chilled flow of nitrogen gas having a temperature between -10 and - 200 °C, more preferably between -50 and -100°C is used as cooling medium to quickly freeze the individual droplets. The frozen liquid dispersion droplets are freeze dried in order to remove the majority of solvent from the droplets. By freeze drying the solvent sublimes out of the droplets, leading to an open pore structure of the particles. In the freezing step the liquid dispersion droplets are brought to a temperature between -10 eC and -200 eC, preferably between -50 and -100 eC. When the droplets of the liquid dispersion are frozen by contacting with preferably a chilled gas directly after spraying, this freezing step is equal to the prefreezing stage in freeze drying. When the droplets are frozen in another way it might be possible that a prefreezing stage is necessary to bring the frozen colorant to a suitable temperature to start the primary drying stage. Freeze drying is performed under subatmospheric pressure (vacuum). The pressure is typically below 6 mbar, preferably below 1 mbar, more preferably below 0.1 mbar. The temperature during the freeze drying process is typically <30°C. The invention relates to the use of solid colorants for tinting paint compositions. The invention also relates to a system for tinting base paint composition, comprising a) At least one base paint composition packaged in a container with a volume of about 0.2 to 20 L equipped with and openable and recloseable lid, cap or other closure for an opening through which a colorant may be dispensed from an automated or manual colorant dispenser into the base paint composition; and b) An array of colorants being packaged in containers with a volume from 0.5 to 5 liters provided with a colorant dispenser from which colorant may be dispensed into the base paint composition, whereby the colorant is a solid colorant and dispensing of the solid colorant is performed in a volumetric way. Preferably the ratio S/A [Std dev of the particle size distribution / average particle size] of the solid colorant is <25%, preferably <22% and more preferably <20%, Preferably the average particle size of the solid colorants ranges between 400 and 1400 μηη, preferably between 500 and 1300 μηη, more preferably between 600 and 1000 μηη. Volumetric dosing is the dosing of a predetermined volume of solid colorant. The predetermined volume can be dosed by measuring an initial volume of solid colorant in a colorant dispenser, followed by dosing the solid colorant till an end volume is reached, wherein the predetermined volume is the difference between the initial and the end volume. Alternatively, one may determine the time needed to dispense a certain predetermined volume, when the colorant dispenser doses a constant or known volume per time. Figures. Figure 1 relates an example of a particles size distribution of particles prepared by a spray drying process. Figure 2 relates to particles prepared with the process according to the invention. Figure 3 shows testing equipment for volumetric dosing of solid pigment particles. The testing equipment contains a vessel 1 , having an opening 2 for discharging solid particles, a plunger 3 which can be moved up and down to open or close opening 2 of vessel 1 in order to release solid particles 4. Examples A number of examples have been prepared to illustrate the invention. The compositions of the liquid pigment dispersion (LPD) to prepare solid colorants (SC) are summarized in table 1 . Table 1 : List of used materials and recipes LPD = Liquid pigment dispersion SC = Solid Colorant Experiment 1 : Preparation of a liquid pigment dispersion The amounts of raw materials needed to prepare the liquid pigment dispersion are given in the recipes (table 1 ). First, the liquids are weighted into a 10ltr vessel using a scale. The vessel is placed under a high shear dissolver. The solids materials (amounts weighted in on beforehand in a can) are added slowly using a spoon. The shear of the dissolver should be adjusted that a vortex is visible at all times during addition of the solids. After all solids are added the viscosity is measured on a Stormer rheometer and the viscosity is adjusted before the milling phase (typically between 70 and 120 Krebs Units (KU)) by addition of water. The dispersion is milled on a pearl mill till particle size typically <15 μηη. Measurement of the particle size is done with a Hegman gauge (according to SFS-ISO 1524). Viscosity, color strength and color shade (according to CIE lab) are measured and the liquid pigment dispersion is diluted to the required viscosity and color standard. Table 2: Measurements of the liquid pigment dispersions Experiment 2: Preparation of a solid colorant by Comparative method A Production of solid colorants by spray drying: (a) atomization of a suspension with the aid of a one-material nozzle carried out in a spray tower; (b) bringing the droplets generated in step (a) in contact with air to dry the same to give granules with a given residual moisture content. The gas inlet temperature in the spray tower is 165 °C. The gas outlet temperature is 70 °C. (c) separation of the granules from the gas stream. Irregular granules have been formed having a large particle size distribution and low porosity (BET values generally≤15 m2/g, and especially≤10 m2/g). The S/A typically ranges between 40 and 60 (see table 4). Experiment 3: Preparation of a solid colorant by method B With a vibrating nozzle droplets of the liquid pigment dispersion are formed, which are immediately cooled in a tube containing chilled nitrogen gas stream (in counterflow to the particles) having a temperature between about -78 °C and -70 °C. The frozen droplets are collected in a container and freeze dried in a freeze drier (pressure 0.1 mbar and temperature 25 °C) The vibrating nozzle preferably has a diameter of 0.3 mm. A typical used frequency of 500 Hz, amplitude 400 mV and pressure 1 10 mbar. Nice well defined solid colorant particles are obtained, having a narrow particle size distribution with S/A between 5 and 20 (see table 4). Experiment 4: Difference in solubility due to particle size of the spheres To use the solid colorants in practice, the maximum shaking time (using a paint shaker) to develop full color strength in the paint is 2 minutes. The size of the spheres might have an influence on the solubility of the solid colorant. A liquid pigment dispersion of Oxide Yellow pigment has been made according to experiment 1 , using the recipe given in table 1 (column 3). From this liquid pigment dispersion solid colorants have been made using method B as described in experiment 3, resulting in a solid colorants with recipe as given in table 1 (column 4). Depending on the size of the vibrating nozzle different fractions have been obtained. The solid colorant has been divided in fractions with different particle size (0-250, 250-500, 500-710, 710-1000, 1000-1400, 1400-2000 Mm) using sieves with different mesh. From each fraction 1 .3 grams was added to 100 grams of an acrylic white paint in a 120 ml plastic can (height 70 mm, diameter 50 mm). These mixtures were shaken for different times (t= 1 , 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 min) in a vibrational paint shaker (e.g. Vibro ST from Corob). After every shaking time the samples were opened, a part of the paint was taken out and a draw-down on a black-white card was made using a block-applicator of 150 μηη. The color strength of all samples has been measured using a spectrophotometer (measurement on Z-axis, according to LAB Color Space). The sample with the smallest particle size (0-250 μηη) and shaken for 6 minutes has been used as standard. All other samples have been measured against this standard. The color strength between the standard and the samples is measured and the difference is presented in % in table 2. When the difference in color strength between the standard and the sample <2 % the particles are considered as being dissolved. Table 3: Color strength development at different particle The particle size of the spheres has an influence on the solubility of the spheres in the paint. Particle size of the largest spheres should be < 1400 μηη to prevent particle size having influence on the solubility of the spheres into the paint within the required max shaking time of 2 minutes. Experiment 5: Difference in PSD due to the used production method for the solid colorants An important factor for accurate volumetric dosing of the dispenser or specifically the dosing unit, is the variation in powder particle size. To determine particle size and particle distribution an OCCHIO ZEPHYR ESR analyzer has been used. The analyzer gives accurate size and shape analysis of free flowing powders with a particle size from 20 Mm to 30 mm. The OCCHIO ZEPHYR ESR analyzer works according to the ISO 13322-1 Static image analysis First edition 2004-12- 01 standard. Each sample was given to a vibrating feeder where it was transported to a drop shaft to obtain gravity dispersion of the sample in the OCCHIO ZEPHYR ESR analyzer. Thereafter the camera took pictures from all particles in the focus. For each sample the particle size of 50000 particles was analyzed. The statistical evaluation was performed with the use of CALLISTO-software. Liquid pigment dispersions of Oxide Yellow, Blue, Green and Red pigment have been made according to experiment 1 , using the recipes given in table 1 (columns 3, 5, 7 and 9). From this liquid pigment dispersions solid colorants have been made using method A and method B as described in experiment 2 and 3, resulting in solid colorants with recipes as given in table 1 (columns 4, 6, 8 and 10). In table 4 a summary of the results of the PSD measurements are given. The Min- Max and the factor S/A [standard deviation of the particle size distribution / average particle size] (%) are a measure for the homogeneity in size and distribution of the solid colorant, which is an important indication of the flowability. A perfect flowability is required for optimal volumetric dispensing of the spheres. Figures 1 and 2 are examples of the difference in PSD using different methods to produce the spheres. The results show that method A solid colorant spheres are relatively very small in size compared to method B solid colorant spheres. Furthermore, method B spheres show much less size variation than method A spheres. The homogeneity in size (S/A <25%, preferably <20%) seen in method B spheres is an important indication of the excellent flow ability of these spheres.

The device is schematically illustrated in figure 3. The testing unit contains a vessel or container 1 which has an opening 2 for dosing solid particles. The opening can be opened or closed by means of a plunger 3, which can move up and down. During the time that the plunger is opened, a certain volume of solid colorant will be dosed by gravity. The volumetric dosage of two samples has been tested with the device as illustrated in figure 3. The following test method has been used: The plunger is moved down, which means the dosing unit is closed. The container 1 is partially filled with solid spheres. The plunger is moved upwards, which starts the dosing of solid colorant through opening 2 for a determined period of time. The plunger is moved down again in order to close the dosing unit. The amount of spheres is measured by weight, using the tap density to determine the volume. In the first test the funnel was filled with Oxide Yellow PY42, produced with production method B (see experiment 5, table 4). The particle size ranges between 593- 1375 μηη, with a narrow particle size distribution (S/A is 14%). With a closed plunger there was no leaking of particles. When filling the funnel the sample looked homogenous; there was no difference in particle size noticed between the top and bottom of the sample. In the second (comparative) test the funnel was filled with Oxide Yellow PY42 solid spheres, produced with production method A (see experiment 5, table 4). The particle size ranges between 22.5 and 645 μηη and S/A is 40%, which means that the particle size distribution is very broad. Even when the plunger 3 was closed, the fraction small paticles started to fall through the (small) opening between plunger 3 and opening 2. Due to to leakage of small particles, and the inhomogeneity of the particles in container 1 , the dosing of the particles was inaccurate and unreliable. Further it was noticed that during filling of the funnel the bigger particles came to the surface, while the smaller particles moved to the bottom. It is expected that this will result in inaccuracy of volumetric dosing. From above tests it can be concluded that a small particle size distribution is needed for accurate volumetric dosing. And that volumetric dosing becomes impossible when the particle size of the solid colorants is too small. 1.
