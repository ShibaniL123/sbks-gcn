Example 163A
1-[1-Ethyl-2,6-dioxo-4-(pyridinium-1-yl)-1,6-dihydropyrimidin-5(2H)-ylidene] 2,2-difluoroethoxide
At RT, 35 ml (430 mmol) of pyridine were added to a suspension of 7.5 g (43.0 mmol) of the compound from Ex. 160A in 110 ml of acetonitrile. 21.4 ml (172 mmol) of difluoroacetic anhydride were then slowly added dropwise. After the addition had ended, the mixture was stirred at RT for another 1 h. About 300 ml of water were then added, and the mixture was extracted four times with about 100 ml of ethyl acetate each time. The organic extract was washed with saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulphate and then concentrated to dryness. At RT, the solid that remained was stirred in a mixture of 50 ml of diisopropyl ether and 50 ml of diethyl ether. After filtration with suction and drying under high vacuum, 6.38 g (50% of theory) of the title compound were obtained.
