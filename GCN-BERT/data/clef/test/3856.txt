Synthesis Example 1-(8): Synthesis of Compound 1
Compound 1 was synthesized as illustrated in the following Reaction Scheme 8:
In a 250-mL round-bottom flask reactor, Intermediate 1-a (5.5 g, 13 mmol), Intermediate 1-g (4.7 g, 16 mmol), tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium (0.46 g, 3 mmol), and potassium carbonate (3.67 g, 26.5 mmol) were placed, followed by toluene (30 mL), 1,4-dioxane (30 mL) and water (11 mL). The temperature of the reactor was elevated to 90Â° C. before stirring overnight. After completion of the reaction, the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic layer thus formed was isolated and concentrated in a vacuum, followed by purification through column chromatography. Recrystallization in toluene and acetone afforded Compound 1.
