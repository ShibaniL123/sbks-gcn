Preparation of compound 25-b.
Compound 25-c (1.6 g, 6.35 mmol) and isopropylhydrazine hydrochloride (769 mg, 6.99 mmol) were dissolved in anhydrous ethanol (20 mL) and triethylamine (962 mg, 9.53 mmol) was then added thereto. The reaction mixture was heated under reflux for 16 hours and then cooled to room temperature. The reaction mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure and the residue was dissolved in ethyl acetate (100 mL) and then washed successively with water (50 mL Ã— 3) and brine (50 mL), dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered and the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure to deliver a pale yellow solid 25-b (1.3 g, yield: 67%). This product was used without further purification.
