The content of these applications are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety for all purposes. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The taste system provides sensory information about the chemical composition of the external world. Taste transduction is one of the most sophisticated forms of chemical-triggered sensation in animals. Signaling of taste is found throughout the animal kingdom, from simple metazoans to the most complex of vertebrates. Sensations associated with taste are thought to involve distinct signaling pathways mediated by receptors, i.e., metabotropic or ionotropic receptors. Cells which express taste receptors, when exposed to certain chemical stimuli, elicit taste sensation by depolarizing to generate an action potential, which is believed to trigger the sensation. This event is believed to trigger the release of neurotransmitters at gustatory afferent neuron synapses, thereby initiating signaling along neuronal pathways that mediate taste perception. As such, taste receptors specifically recognize molecules that elicit specific taste sensation. These molecules are also referred to herein as “tastants.” Many taste receptors belong to the 7-transmembrane receptor superfamily, which are also known as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Other tastes are believed to be mediated by channel proteins. G protein-coupled receptors control many physiological functions, such as endocrine function, exocrine function, heart rate, lipolysis, carbohydrate metabolism, and transmembrane signaling. For example, family C of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) from humans comprises eight metabotropic glutamate (mGlu(1-8)) receptors, two heterodimeric gamma-aminobutyric acid(B) (GABA(B)) receptors, a calcium-sensing receptor (CaR), three taste (T1R) receptors, a promiscuous L-alpha-amino acid receptor (GPRC6A), and five orphan receptors. The family C GPCRs are characterized by a large amino-terminal domain, which binds the endogenous orthosteric agonists. Additionally, allosteric modulators which bind to the seven transmembrane domains of the receptors have also been reported. In general, upon ligand binding to a GPCR, the receptor presumably undergoes a conformational change leading to activation of a G protein. G proteins are comprised of three subunits: a guanyl nucleotide binding α-subunit, a β-subunit, and a γ-subunit. G proteins cycle between two forms, depending on whether GDP or GTP is bound to the α-subunit. When GDP is bound, the G protein exists as a heterotrimer: the Gαβγ complex. When GTP is bound, the α-subunit dissociates from the heterotrimer, leaving a Gβγ complex. When a Gαβγ complex operatively associates with an activated G protein-coupled receptor in a cell membrane, the rate of exchange of GTP for bound GDP is increased and the rate of dissociation of the bound Gα subunit from the Gαβγ complex increases. The free Gα subunit and Gβγ complex are thus capable of transmitting a signal to downstream elements of a variety of signal transduction pathways. These events form the basis for a multiplicity of different cell signaling phenomena, including for example the signaling phenomena that are identified as neurological sensory perceptions such as taste and/or smell. Mammals are believed to have five basic taste modalities: sweet, bitter, sour, salty, and umami (the taste of monosodium glutamate). Numerous physiological studies in animals have shown that taste receptor cells may selectively respond to different chemical stimuli. In mammals, taste receptor cells are assembled into taste buds that are distributed into different papillae in the tongue epithelium. Circumvallate papillae, found at the very back of the tongue, contain hundreds to thousands of taste buds. By contrast, foliate papillae, localized to the posterior lateral edge of the tongue, contain dozens to hundreds of taste buds. Further, fungiform papillae, located at the front of the tongue, contain only a single or a few taste buds. Each taste bud, depending on the species, contains 50-150 cells, including precursor cells, support cells, and taste receptor cells. Receptor cells are innervated at their base by afferent nerve endings that transmit information to the taste centers of the cortex through synapses in the brain stem and thalamus. Elucidating the mechanisms of taste cell signaling and information processing is important to understanding the function, regulation, and perception of the sense of taste. The gustatory system has been selected during evolution to detect nutritive and beneficial compounds as well as harmful or toxic substances. Outside the tongue, expression of Gαgust has also been localized to gastric and pancreatic cells, suggesting that a taste-sensing mechanism may also exist in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Expression of taste receptors has also been found in the lining of stomach and intestine, suggesting that taste receptors may play a role in molecular sensing of therapeutic entities and toxins. Complete or partial sequences of numerous human and other eukaryotic chemosensory receptors are currently known. Within the last several years, a number of groups including the present assignee Senomyx, Inc. have reported the identification and cloning of genes from two GPCR families that are involved in taste modulation and have obtained experimental results related to the understanding of taste biology. These results indicate that bitter, sweet and amino acid taste, also referred as umami taste, are triggered by activation of two types of specific receptors located at the surface of taste receptor cells (TRCs) on the tongue i.e., T2Rs and T1Rs. It is currently believed that at least 26 to 33 genes encode functional receptors (T2Rs) for bitter tasting substances in human and rodent respectively. By contrast there are only 3 T1Rs, T1R1, T1R2 and T1R3, which are involved in umami and sweet taste. Structurally, the T1R and T2R receptors possess the hallmark of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), i.e., 7 transmembrane domains flanked by small extracellular and intracellular amino- and carboxyl-termini respectively. T2Rs have been cloned from different mammals including rats, mice and humans. T2Rs comprise a novel family of human and rodent G protein-coupled receptors that are expressed in subsets of taste receptor cells of the tongue and palate epithelia. These taste receptors are organized in clusters in taste cells and are genetically linked to loci that influence bitter taste. The fact that T2Rs modulate bitter taste has been demonstrated in cell-based assays. For example, mT2R-5, hT2R-4 and mT2R-8 have been shown to be activated by bitter molecules in in vitro gustducin assays, providing experimental proof that T2Rs function as bitter taste receptors. See also T2Rs disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 7,105,650. T1R family members in general include T1R1, T1R2, and T1R3, e.g., rT1R3, mT1R3, hT1R3, rT1R2, mT1R2, hT1R2, and rT1R1, mT1R1 and hT1R1. It is known that the three T1R gene members T1R1, T1R2 and T1R3 form functional heterodimers that specifically recognize sweeteners and amino acids. It is generally believed that T1R2/T1R3 combination recognizes natural and artificial sweeteners while the T1R1/T1R3 combination recognizes several L-amino acids and monosodium glutamate (MSG), respectively. For example, co-expression of T1R1 and T1R3 in recombinant host cells results in a hetero-oligomeric taste receptor that responds to umami taste stimuli. Umami taste stimuli include by way of example monosodium glutamate and other molecules that elicit a “savory” taste sensation. By contrast, co-expression of T1R2 and T1R3 in recombinant host cells results in a hetero-oligomeric sweet taste receptor that responds to both naturally occurring and artificial sweeteners. There is a need in the art to develop various ways of identifying compounds or other entities suitable for modifying receptors and their ligands associated with chemosensory or chemosensory related sensation or reaction. In addition, there is a need in the art for compounds or other entities with such characteristics. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention is based, at least in part, on the discovery that an extra-cellular domain, e.g., the Venus flytrap domain of a chemosensory receptor, especially one or more interacting sites within the Venus flytrap domain, is a suitable target for compounds or other entities to modulate the chemosensory receptor and/or its ligands. Accordingly, the present invention provides screening methods for identifying modifiers of chemosensory receptors and their ligands as well as modifiers capable of modulating chemosensory receptors and their ligands.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Prior to specifically describing the invention, the following definitions are provided. The term “T1R” family includes polymorphic variants, alleles, mutants, and homologs that: (1) have about 30-40% amino acid sequence identity, more specifically about 40, 50, 60, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 96, 97, 98, or 99% amino acid sequence identity to the T1Rs known or disclosed, e.g., in patent application Ser. No. 10/179,373 filed on Jun. 26, 2002, Ser. No. 09/799,629 filed on Apr. 5, 2001 and U.S. Ser. No. 10/035,045 filed on Jan. 3, 2002, over a window of about 25 amino acids, optimally 50-100 amino acids; (2) specifically bind to antibodies raised against an immunogen comprising an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of the T1R sequences disclosed infra, and conservatively modified variants thereof; (3) specifically hybridize (with a size of at least about 100, optionally at least about 500-1000 nucleotides) under stringent hybridization conditions to a sequence selected from the group consisting of the T1R DNA sequences disclosed infra, and conservatively modified variants thereof; (4) comprise a sequence at least about 40% identical to an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of the T1R amino acid sequences disclosed infra or (5) are amplified by primers that specifically hybridize under stringent hybridization conditions to the described T1R sequences. In particular, these “T1R5” include taste receptor GPCRs referred to as hT1R1, hT1R2, hT1R3, rT1R1, rT1R2, rT1R3, mT1R1, mT1R2, and mT1R3 having the nucleic acid sequences and amino acid sequences known or disclosed, e.g., in U.S. Ser. No. 10/179,373 filed on Jun. 26, 2002, U.S. Ser. No. 09/799,629 filed on Apr. 5, 2001 and U.S. Ser. No. 10/035,045 filed on Jan. 3, 2002, and variants, alleles, mutants, orthologs and chimeras thereof which specifically bind and/or respond to sweet, umami, or any other chemosensory related ligands including activators, inhibitors and enhancers. Also T1Rs include taste receptor GPCRs expressed in humans or other mammals, e.g., cells associated with taste and/or part of gastrointestinal system including without any limitation, esophagus, stomach, intestine (small and large), colon, liver, biliary tract, pancreas, gallbladder, etc. Also, T1R polypeptides include chimeric sequences derived from portions of a particular T1R polypeptide such as T1R1, T1R2 or T1R3 of different species or by combining portions of different T1Rs wherein such chimeric T1R sequences are combined to produce a functional sweet or umami taste receptor. For example chimeric T1Rs may comprise the extracellular region of one T1R, i.e., T1R1 or T1R2 and the transmembrane region of another T1R, either T1R1 or T1R2. Topologically, certain chemosensory GPCRs have an “N-terminal domain;” “extracellular domains,” a “transmembrane domain” comprising seven transmembrane regions, and corresponding cytoplasmic and extracellular loops, “cytoplasmic regions,” and a “C-terminal region” (see, e.g., Hoon et al., Cell 96:541-51 (1999); Buck et al., Cell 65:175-87 (1991)). These regions can be structurally identified using methods known to those of skill in the art, such as sequence analysis programs that identify hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains (see, e.g., Stryer, Biochemistry, (3rd ed. 1988); see also any of a number of Internet based sequence analysis programs, such as those found at dot.imgen.bcm.tmc.edu). These regions are useful for making chimeric proteins and for in vitro assays of the invention, e.g., ligand binding assays. “Extracellular domains” therefore refers to the domains of chemosensory receptors, e.g., T1R polypeptides that protrude from the cellular membrane and are exposed to the extracellular face of the cell. Such regions would include the “N-terminal domain” that is exposed to the extracellular face of the cell, as well as the extracellular loops of the transmembrane domain that are exposed to the extracellular face of the cell, i.e., the extracellular loops between transmembrane regions 2 and 3, transmembrane regions 4 and 5, and transmembrane regions 6 and 7. The “N-terminal domain” starts at the N-terminus and extends to a region close to the start of the transmembrane region. These extracellular regions are useful for in vitro ligand binding assays, both soluble and solid phase. In addition, transmembrane regions, described below, can also be involved in ligand binding, either in combination with the extracellular region or alone, and are therefore also useful for in vitro ligand binding assays. “Transmembrane domain,” which comprises the seven transmembrane “regions,” refers to the domains of chemosensory receptors, e.g., T1R polypeptides that lie within the plasma membrane, and may also include the corresponding cytoplasmic (intracellular) and extracellular loops, also referred to as transmembrane “regions.” The seven transmembrane regions and extracellular and cytoplasmic loops can be identified using standard methods, as described in Kyte et al., J. Mol. Biol. 157:105-32 (1982)), or in Stryer, supra. “Cytoplasmic domains” refers to the domains of chemosensory receptors, e.g., T1R proteins that face the inside of the cell, e.g., the “C-terminal domain” and the intracellular loops of the transmembrane domain, e.g., the intracellular loops between transmembrane regions 1 and 2, transmembrane regions 3 and 4, and transmembrane regions 5 and 6. “C-terminal domain” refers to the region that spans from the end of the last transmembrane region to the C-terminus of the protein, and which is normally located within the cytoplasm. The term “7-transmembrane receptor” means a polypeptide belonging to a superfamily of transmembrane proteins that have seven regions that span the plasma membrane seven times (thus, the seven regions are called “transmembrane” or “TM” domains TM I to TM VII). The phrase “functional effects” or “activity” in the context of the disclosed assays for testing compounds that modulate a chemosensory receptor, e.g., enhance T1R family member mediated signal transduction such as sweet or umami receptor functional effects or activity includes the determination of any parameter that is indirectly or directly under the influence of the particular chemosensory receptor, e.g., functional, physical and chemical effects. It includes, without any limitation, ligand binding, changes in ion flux, membrane potential, current flow, transcription, G protein binding, GPCR phosphorylation or dephosphorylation, signal transduction, receptor-ligand interactions, second messenger concentrations (e.g., cAMP, cGMP, IP3, or intracellular Ca2+), in vitro, in vivo, and ex vivo and also includes other physiologic effects such increases or decreases of neurotransmitter or hormone release. The term “determining the functional effect” or receptor “activity” means assays for a compound that increases or decreases a parameter that is indirectly or directly under the influence of a chemosensory receptor, e.g., functional, physical and chemical effects. Such functional effects can be measured by any means known to those skilled in the art, e.g., changes in spectroscopic characteristics (e.g., fluorescence, absorbance, refractive index), hydrodynamic (e.g., shape), chromatographic, or solubility properties, patch clamping, voltage-sensitive dyes, whole cell currents, radioisotope efflux, inducible markers, oocyte chemosensory receptor, e.g., T1R gene expression; tissue culture cell chemosensory receptor, e.g., T1R expression; transcriptional activation of chemosensory receptor, e.g., T1R genes; ligand binding assays; voltage, membrane potential and conductance changes; ion flux assays; changes in intracellular second messengers such as cAMP, cGMP, and inositol triphosphate (IP3); changes in intracellular calcium levels; neurotransmitter release, and the like. “Inhibitors,” “activators,” and “modifiers” of chemosensory receptor, e.g., T1R proteins are used interchangeably to refer to inhibitory, activating, or modulating molecules identified using in vitro and in vivo assays for chemosensory signal transduction, e.g., ligands, agonists, antagonists, and their homologs and mimetics. Inhibitors are compounds that, e.g., bind to, partially or totally block stimulation, decrease, prevent, delay activation, inactivate, desensitize, or down regulate taste transduction, e.g., antagonists. Activators are compounds that, e.g., bind to, stimulate, increase, open, activate, facilitate, enhance activation, sensitize, or up regulate chemosensory signal transduction, e.g., agonists. Modifiers include compounds that, e.g., alter, directly or indirectly, the activity of a receptor or the interaction of a receptor with its ligands, e.g., receptor ligands and optionally bind to or interact with activators or inhibitors; G Proteins; kinases (e.g., homologs of rhodopsin kinase and beta adrenergic receptor kinases that are involved in deactivation and desensitization of a receptor); and arrestins, which also deactivate and desensitize receptors. Modifiers include genetically modified versions of chemosensory receptors, e.g., T1R family members, e.g., with altered activity, as well as naturally occurring and synthetic ligands, antagonists, agonists, small chemical molecules and the like. The term “chemosensory receptor ligand modifier” as used herein includes chemosensory receptor ligand enhancer. In the present invention this includes, without any limitation, sweet ligands (agonists or antagonists), umami ligands (agonists and antagonists), sweet enhancers and umami enhancers and sweet taste or umami taste inhibitors. “Enhancer” herein refers to a compound that modulates (increases) the activation of a particular receptor, preferably the chemosensory, e.g., T1R2/T1R3 receptor or T1R1/T1R3 receptor but which by itself does not result in substantial activation of the particular receptor. Herein such enhancers will enhance the activation of a chemosensory receptor by its ligand. Typically the “enhancer” will be specific to a particular ligand, i.e., it will not enhance the activation of a chemosensory receptor by chemosensory ligands other than the particular chemosensory ligand or ligands closely related thereto. “Putative enhancer” herein refers to a compound identified, e.g., in silico or not, as a potential enhancer using assays which are described herein but which enhancer activity has not yet been confirmed in vivo, e.g., in suitable taste tests. The terms “polypeptide,” “peptide” and “protein” are used interchangeably herein to refer to a polymer of amino acid residues. The terms apply to amino acid polymers in which one or more amino acid residue is an artificial chemical mimetic of a corresponding naturally occurring amino acid, as well as to naturally occurring amino acid polymers and non-naturally occurring amino acid polymer. The “extra-cellular domain” and chemosensory receptor, e.g., T1R receptor regions or compositions described herein also include “analogs,” or “conservative variants” and “mimetics” (“peptidomimetics”) with structures and activity that substantially correspond to the exemplary sequences. Thus, the terms “conservative variant” or “analog” or “mimetic” refer to a polypeptide which has a modified amino acid sequence, such that the change(s) do not substantially alter the polypeptide's (the conservative variant's) structure and/or activity, as defined herein. These include conservatively modified variations of an amino acid sequence, i.e., amino acid substitutions, additions or deletions of those residues that are not critical for protein activity, or substitution of amino acids with residues having similar properties (e.g., acidic, basic, positively or negatively charged, polar or non-polar, etc.) such that the substitutions of even critical amino acids does not substantially alter structure and/or activity. More particularly, “conservatively modified variants” applies to both amino acid and nucleic acid sequences. With respect to particular nucleic acid sequences, conservatively modified variants refers to those nucleic acids which encode identical or essentially identical amino acid sequences, or where the nucleic acid does not encode an amino acid sequence, to essentially identical sequences. Because of the degeneracy of the genetic code, a large number of functionally identical nucleic acids encode any given protein. For instance, the codons GCA, GCC, GCG and GCU all encode the amino acid alanine. Thus, at every position where an alanine is specified by a codon, the codon can be altered to any of the corresponding codons described without altering the encoded polypeptide. Such nucleic acid variations are “silent variations,” which are one species of conservatively modified variations. Every nucleic acid sequence herein which encodes a polypeptide also describes every possible silent variation of the nucleic acid. One of skill will recognize that each codon in a nucleic acid (except AUG, which is ordinarily the only codon for methionine, and TGG, which is ordinarily the only codon for tryptophan) can be modified to yield a functionally identical molecule. Accordingly, each silent variation of a nucleic acid which encodes a polypeptide is implicit in each described sequence. Conservative substitution tables providing functionally similar amino acids are well known in the art. For example, one exemplary guideline to select conservative substitutions includes (original residue followed by exemplary substitution): ala/gly or ser; arg/lys; asn/gln or his; asp/glu; cys/ser; gln/asn; gly/asp; gly/ala or pro; his/asn or gln; ile/leu or val; leu/ile or val; lys/arg or gln or glu; met/leu or tyr or ile; phe/met or leu or tyr; ser/thr; thr/ser; trp/tyr; tyr/trp or phe; val/ile or leu. An alternative exemplary guideline uses the following six groups, each containing amino acids that are conservative substitutions for one another: 1) Alanine (A), Serine (S), Threonine (T); 2) Aspartic acid (D), Glutamic acid (E); 3) Asparagine (N), Glutamine (Q); 4) Arginine (R), Lysine (I); 5) Isoleucine (I), Leucine (L), Methionine (M), Valine (V); and 6) Phenylalanine (F), Tyrosine (Y), Tryptophan (W); (see also, e.g., Creighton, Proteins, W. H. Freeman and Company (1984); Schultz and Schimer, Principles of Protein Structure, Springer-Verlag (1979)). One of skill in the art will appreciate that the above-identified substitutions are not the only possible conservative substitutions. For example, for some purposes, one may regard all charged amino acids as conservative substitutions for each other whether they are positive or negative. In addition, individual substitutions, deletions or additions that alter, add or delete a single amino acid or a small percentage of amino acids in an encoded sequence can also be considered “conservatively modified variations.” The terms “mimetic” and “peptidomimetic” refer to a synthetic chemical compound that has substantially the same structural and/or functional characteristics of the polypeptides, e.g., extra-cellular domain or any region therewith of T1R2 or T1R1. The mimetic can be either entirely composed of synthetic, non-natural analogs of amino acids, or may be a chimeric molecule of partly natural peptide amino acids and partly non-natural analogs of amino acids. The mimetic can also incorporate any amount of natural amino acid conservative substitutions as long as such substitutions also do not substantially alter the mimetic's structure and/or activity. As with polypeptides of the invention which are conservative variants, routine experimentation will determine whether a mimetic is within the scope of the invention, i.e., that its structure and/or function is not substantially altered. Polypeptide mimetic compositions can contain any combination of non-natural structural components, which are typically from three structural groups: a) residue linkage groups other than the natural amide bond (“peptide bond”) linkages; b) non-natural residues in place of naturally occurring amino acid residues; or c) residues which induce secondary structural mimicry, i.e., to induce or stabilize a secondary structure, e.g., a beta turn, gamma turn, beta sheet, alpha helix conformation, and the like. A polypeptide can be characterized as a mimetic when all or some of its residues are joined by chemical means other than natural peptide bonds. Individual peptidomimetic residues can be joined by peptide bonds, other chemical bonds or coupling means, such as e.g., glutaraldehyde, N-hydroxysuccinimide esters, bifunctional maleimides, N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) or N,N′-diisopropylcarbodiimide (DIC). Linking groups that can be an alternative to the traditional amide bond (“peptide bond”) linkages include, e.g., ketomethylene (e.g., —C(O)—CH2— for —C(O)—NH—), aminomethylene —CH2(NH)—, ethylene, olefin —CH═CH—, ether —CH2O—, thioether —CH2S—, tetrazole (CN4), thiazole, retroamide, thioamide or ester (see, e.g., Spatola, Chemistry and Biochemistry of Amino Acids, Peptides and Proteins, Vol. 7, 267-357, Marcell Dekker, Peptide Backbone Modifications, NY (1983)). A polypeptide can also be characterized as a mimetic by containing all or some non-natural residues in place of naturally occurring amino acid residues; non-natural residues are well described in the scientific and patent literature. “Alkyl,” by itself or as part of another substituent, refers to a saturated or unsaturated, branched, straight-chain or cyclic monovalent hydrocarbon radical derived by the removal of one hydrogen atom from a single carbon atom of a parent alkane, alkene or alkyne.

Compounds may be identified either by their chemical structure and/or chemical name. When the chemical structure and chemical name conflict, the chemical structure is determinative of the identity of the compound. The compounds described herein may contain one or more chiral centers and/or double bonds and therefore, may exist as stereoisomers, such as double-bond isomers (i.e., geometric isomers), enantiomers or diastereomers. Accordingly, the chemical structures depicted herein encompass all possible enantiomers and stereoisomers of the illustrated compounds including the stereoisomerically pure form (e.g., geometrically pure, enantiomerically pure or diastereomerically pure) and enantiomeric and stereoisomeric mixtures.

The compounds may also exist in several tautomeric forms including the enol form, the keto form and mixtures thereof. Accordingly, the chemical structures depicted herein encompass all possible tautomeric forms of the illustrated compounds.

The present invention is based, at least in part, on the discovery that an extra-cellular domain, e.g., the Venus flytrap domain of a chemosensory receptor, especially one or more interacting sites within the Venus flytrap domain, is a suitable target for compounds or other entities to modulate the chemosensory receptor and/or its ligands. Accordingly, the present invention provides screening methods for identifying chemosensory receptor modifiers as well as chemosensory receptor ligand modifiers. In addition, the present invention provides compounds and compositions capable of modulating chemosensory receptors as well as chemosensory receptor ligands. According to one aspect of the present invention, it provides methods of screening for chemosensory receptor modifiers by determining whether a test entity is suitable to interact with a chemosensory receptor via one or more interacting sites within the extra-cellular domain of the chemosensory receptor, e.g., the Venus flytrap domain of the chemosensory receptor. According to another aspect of the present invention, it provides methods of screening for chemosensory receptor ligand modifiers by determining whether a test entity is suitable to interact with a chemosensory receptor, and optionally its ligand via one or more interacting sites within the extra-cellular domain, e.g., the Venus flytrap domain of the chemosensory receptor, optionally in the presence of a chemosensory receptor ligand. In general, the extra-cellular domain of a chemosensory receptor refers to the extra-cellular amino-terminus of a chemosensory receptor and usually includes a ligand-binding domain and a cysteine-rich linker domain, which connects the ligand-binding domain and the rest of the protein. In Class C GPCRs, the ligand binding domain is generally referred to as a Venus flytrap domain, the structure of which has been elucidated, e.g., using X-ray crystallography. A Venus flytrap domain typically consists of two relatively rigid lobes connected by three strands forming a flexible “hinge” region. In the absence of a ligand, the Venus flytrap domain tends to adopt open conformations with well-separated lobes as well as closed conformations with lobes closer together. In one example, the Venus flytrap domain includes a region from amino acid 36 to amino acid 509 of human T1R1, amino acid 31 to amino acid 507 of human T1R2, and/or amino acid 35 to amino acid 511 of human T1R3. The Venus flytrap domain of the present invention includes any ligand binding domain or ligand interacting domain within the extra-cellular domain of a chemosensory receptor. In one embodiment, the Venus flytrap domain of the present invention includes any ligand binding domain of a member of the T1R family. In another embodiment, the Venus flytrap domain of the present invention includes any extra-cellular domain of a chemosensory receptor with a structure comprising two lobes connected by a hinge region. In yet another embodiment, the Venus flytrap domain of the present invention includes any domain corresponding to the structure and/or function of a region including amino acid 36 to amino acid 509 of human T1R1, amino acid 31 to amino acid 507 of human T1R2, and/or amino acid 35 to amino acid 511 of human T1R3. In still another embodiment, the Venus flytrap domain of the present invention includes any ligand binding domain of T1R1, T1R2, and/or T1R3 as well as any polymorphic variation, allele, or mutation thereof. Exemplary illustrations of polymorphic variations for T1R1 and T1R2 are shown in FIGS. 1-4. According to the present invention, a chemosensory receptor can be any receptor associated with chemosensory sensation or chemosensory ligand triggered signal transduction, e.g., via taste receptors or taste related receptors expressed in taste bud, gastrointestinal tract, etc. In one embodiment, a chemosensory receptor is a receptor that belongs to the 7-transmembrane receptor superfamily or G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). In another embodiment, a chemosensory receptor is a receptor carrying out signal transduction via one or more G proteins. In yet another embodiment, a chemosensory receptor is a receptor that belongs to family C or class C of GPCRs. In yet another embodiment, a chemosensory receptor is a receptor that belongs to the T1R family. In yet another embodiment, a chemosensory receptor is a receptor of T1R1, T1R2, T1R3, or their equivalences or variances or a combination thereof. In still another embodiment, a chemosensory receptor is a hetero-dimer of T1R2 and T1R3, or their equivalences or variances. According to the present invention, an interacting site within the Venus flytrap domain of a chemosensory receptor can be one or more interacting residues or a three dimensional interacting space or a combination thereof. In one embodiment, the interacting site of the present invention is within the Venus flytrap domain of T1R2. In another embodiment, the interacting site of the present invention is within the Venus flytrap domain of T1R3. In yet another embodiment, the interacting site of the present invention is within the Venus flytrap domain of both T1R2 and T1R3. Usually such an interacting site can be determined by any suitable means known or later discovered in the art. For example, such interacting site can be determined based on computer modeling, e.g., using software such as Homology or Modeller (by Accelrys Corporation) to construct three dimensional homology models of a chemosensory receptor Venus flytrap domain, e.g., the T1R2 and/or T1R3 Venus flytrap domains based on crystal structures of homologous Venus flytrap domains. Such an interacting site can also be determined, e.g., based on X-ray crystallography and the three dimensional structure of a chemosensory receptor determined therefrom, e.g., the T1R2, T1R3, or T1R2/T1R3 heterodimer. Alternatively, for example, such an interacting site can be determined based on molecular mechanical techniques, e.g., normal mode analysis, loop generation techniques, Monte Carlo and/or molecular dynamics simulations to explore motions and alternative conformations of the Venus flytrap domains, docking simulations to dock candidate receptor ligands and candidate receptor ligand modifiers into these models or into experimentally determined structures of chemosensory receptors, e.g., T1R1 and T1R2. In addition, for example, such an interacting site can be determined based on mutagenesis, e.g., site-directed mutagenesis or a combination of two or more suitable methods known or later discovered, e.g., methods described herein. In one example, such an interacting site is located in part of a chemosensory receptor, e.g., T1R2 and can be determined in the presence or absence of the other part of the chemosensory receptor, e.g., T1R3. In another example, such an interacting site can be determined in the presence or absence of a chemosensory receptor modifier and/or chemosensory receptor ligand modifier. In one embodiment, the interacting site within the Venus flytrap domain of a chemosensory receptor includes one or more interacting residues of the Venus flytrap domain of a chemosensory receptor.

In still another example, the interacting residue of the present invention includes any residue of a chemosensory receptor associated with an interaction between a chemosensory receptor, a sweet flavor entity, and a sweet flavor entity enhancer. In another instance, the interacting residue of the present invention is a residue within the Venus flytrap domain of a chemosensory receptor, wherein any mutation of which could result in a change of the activity of the chemosensory receptor or the impact of a chemosensory receptor ligand to the chemosensory receptor or both. For example, the interacting residue of the present invention can include any residue within the Venus flytrap domain of a chemosensory receptor, wherein the mutation of which results in a detectable change, e.g., qualitative or quantitative change of the activity of the chemosensory receptor in response to a chemosensory receptor modifier and/or chemosensory receptor ligand modifier. In yet another instance, the interacting residue of the present invention is a residue within the Venus flytrap domain of a chemosensory receptor that interacts or forms productive interaction(s), e.g., van der Waals, burial of hydrophobic atoms or atomic groups, hydrogen bonds, ring stacking interactions, or salt-bridging electrostatic interactions with a chemosensory receptor modifier or chemosensory receptor ligand modifier, or both. In still another instance, the interacting residue of the Venus flytrap domain of a chemosensory receptor can be any residue constituting one or more interacting structural components of the Venus flytrap domain, which are associated, directly or indirectly, with the interaction between a chemosensory receptor and a chemosensory receptor modifier or a chemosensory receptor ligand modifier or both. For example, the Venus flytrap domain structure of a chemosensory receptor generally includes two lobes joint by a hinge region. Residues constituting an interacting structural component of the Venus flytrap domain can be, e.g., residues constituting the hinge region, the inner side of each lobe, or residues on each lobe that are brought into close proximity during activation or conformational change of the Venus flytrap domain, including without any limitation, residues on the inner surfaces of the lobes pointing towards each other or on the tips of the lobes where the residues are partially exposed to solvent but still close to residues on the opposite lobe, etc. Exemplary interacting residues of the Venus flytrap domain of a chemosensory receptor include any one or more residues of 1) N143, S144, and I167 of a human T1R2, 2) S40, S144, S165, Y103, D142, and P277 of a human T1R2, 3) K65, R383, D307, E302, and D278 of a human T1R2, 4) I167, P185, T184, T326, E302, V384, A305, I325, I306, R383, D307, E382, D278, I279, I67, V66, V309, D142, S165, S40, S303, T242, F103, Q328, and S168 of a human T1R2, 5) N143, S144, I167, K65, R383, D307, E302, D278, P185, T184, T326, E302, V384, A305, I325, I306, D307, E382, I279, I67, V66, V309, D142, S165, S40, S303, T242, F103, Q328, and S168 of a human T1R2, and 6) N143, I167, K65, R383, D307, E302, D278, P185, T184, T326, V384, A305, I325, I306, D307, E382, I279, I67, V66, V309, D142, S165, S40, S303, T242, F103, Q328, and S168 of a human T1R2.

Exemplary interacting space within the Venus flytrap domain of a chemosensory receptor with respect to a chemosensory receptor modifier includes any space within the Venus flytrap domain outlined or at least partially defined by the hinge region. According to the present invention, the hinge region usually comprises residues that are close to the three strands connecting the two lobes. In one example, the hinge region comprises residues that are homologous to residues observed coordinating agonists and antagonists in crystal structures of one or more Venus flytrap domains such as that of the mGluR receptor. In another example, the hinge region of T1R2 includes residues N143, S144, and I167 of T1R2. Exemplary interacting sites within the Venus flytrap domain of a chemosensory receptor with respect to a chemosensory receptor ligand modifier include any space outlined or at least partially defined by the inner side of one or two lobes away from the hinge region, as well as residues on the tips of the lobes that are brought into close proximity to residues on the other lobe. In yet another embodiment, the interacting site within the Venus flytrap domain of a chemosensory receptor is a combination of one or more interacting residues with an interacting space of the chemosensory receptor. For example, the interacting site of a chemosensory receptor can be interacting residues associated with one interacting structural component of a chemosensory receptor in combination with a three dimensional space adjacent, e.g., not less than 1 Angstrom and not more than 30 Angstroms, to that interacting structural component. Another example of the interacting site of a chemosensory receptor includes interacting residues associated with one interacting structural component of a chemosensory receptor in combination with a three dimensional space apart from the interacting structural component. In general, the screening methods provided by the present invention can be carried out by any suitable means known or later discovered. In one embodiment, the screening methods provided by the present invention are carried out in silico, e.g., via “virtue screening” using any suitable computer modeling system or via specific or rational design of a compound using any suitable computer design system. In another embodiment, the screening methods provided by the present invention are carried out via biological assays, e.g., high throughput screening of interactions between compounds and a chemosensory receptor or its fragments, e.g., genetically modified chemosensory receptors or fragments thereof such as mutated Venus flytrap domains of chemosensory receptors. In yet another embodiment, the screening methods provided by the present invention are carried out via a combination of biological assay(s) and computer modeling and/or design. For example, the screening methods provided by the present invention can be a combination of high-throughput screening of interactions between computer designed or pre-screened compounds and mutated Venus flytrap domains of chemosensory receptors. In one example, the screening method provided by the present invention for chemosensory receptor modifiers includes determining an interacting site using a known chemosensory receptor modifier, e.g., structurally similar to a chemosensory receptor modifier of interest and then determining whether a test entity is suitable to interact with the chemosensory receptor via the interacting site so determined. In another example, the screening method provided by the present invention for chemosensory receptor modifiers includes determining whether a test entity is suitable to interact with a chemosensory receptor via a predetermined interacting site, e.g., an interacting site selected or determined prior to screening, including without any limitation, selected or determined based on known chemosensory receptor modifiers or desired characteristics of a chemosensory receptor modifiers. In yet another example, the screening method provided by the present invention for chemosensory receptor ligand modifiers includes determining a docking site for a chemosensory receptor ligand and subsequently determining whether a test entity is suitable to interact with the chemosensory receptor ligand via an interacting site selected in light of the docking of the chemosensory receptor ligand. According to the present invention, docking process can include any known or later discovered methods. For instance, docking can be a process in which the center of mass, orientations, and internal degrees of freedom of a molecule are modified to fit them into a predetermined space in a structural model. In one example, docking can be a process which includes translating and rotating a chemosensory receptor ligand relative to the chemosensory receptor structural model, e.g., the Venus flytrap domain of a chemosensory receptor model while simultaneously adjusting internal torsional angles of the chemosensory receptor ligand to fit it into the interacting site of the chemosensory receptor. An example of a widely used docking program is GLIDE from Schroedinger, Inc. In yet another example, the screening method provided by the present invention for chemosensory receptor ligand modifiers includes determining a docking site for a chemosensory receptor ligand and subsequently determining an interacting site using a known modifier of the chemosensory receptor ligand and then determining whether a test entity is suitable to interact with the chemosensory receptor ligand via the interacting site so determined. In yet another example, the screening method provided by the present invention for chemosensory receptor ligand modifiers includes determining whether a test entity is suitable to interact with a chemosensory receptor via a predetermined interacting site for chemosensory receptor ligand modifiers. In still another example, the screening method provided by the present invention for chemosensory receptor ligand modifiers includes determining whether a test entity is suitable to interact with a chemosensory receptor by determining, e.g., concurrently whether a chemosensory receptor ligand and the test entity are suitable to interact with the chemosensory receptor in a predetermined interacting site of the chemosensory receptor or an interacting site determined using known chemosensory receptor ligand and its modifier of interest. In still another example, the screening method provided by the present invention for chemosensory receptor ligand modifiers includes determining whether a test entity is suitable to interact with a chemosensory receptor via an interacting site, either pre-determined or not, as well as whether a test entity is suitable to interact with a chemosensory receptor ligand. In still another example, the screening method provided by the present invention for chemosensory receptor ligand modifiers includes determining whether a test entity is suitable to interact with a chemosensory receptor via an interacting site, either pre-determined or not, as well as whether such interaction can stabilize a conformation, e.g., a semi-closed or closed conformation within the Venus flytrap domain formed by the interaction between a chemosensory receptor ligand and a chemosensory receptor, e.g., by forming productive additional interactions within the hinge region, lobes of the Venus flytrap domain, or tips of the flytrap domain via van der Waals, burial of hydrophobic atoms or atomic groups, hydrogen bonds, ring stacking interactions, or salt-bridging electrostatic interactions, etc. In general, any suitable means known or later discovered can be used to determine whether a test entity is suitable to interact with an interacting site of the present invention. For example, one could determine the suitability of a test entity based on whether part or all of a test entity fits into a particular space entailed by an interacting site, e.g., whether a test entity fits into a particular space entailed by an interacting site substantially the same way a known chemosensory receptor modifier or chemosensory receptor ligand modifier does. Alternatively one could determine the suitability of a test entity with respect to an interacting site based on whether it forms interactions with a chemosensory receptor similar to the interactions formed by a known chemosensory receptor modifier or chemosensory receptor ligand modifier when they interact with the interacting site. In addition, one could determine the suitability of a test entity based on whether it forms productive interactions with an interacting site, e.g., van der Waals, burial of hydrophobic atoms or atomic groups, hydrogen bonds, ring stacking interactions, or salt-bridging electrostatic interactions, etc. In one embodiment, one could determine the suitability of a test entity being a chemosensory receptor ligand modifier based on whether it forms productive interactions with an interacting site without forming van der Waals overlapping with one or more atoms of a chemosensory receptor or the chemosensory receptor ligand, e.g., in the context of one or more conformations of the Venus flytrap domain in light of the possible flexibility of the Venus flytrap domain. According to the present invention, a test entity suitable to interact with one or more interacting sites within the Venus flytrap domain of a chemosensory receptor is indicative of a candidate for a chemosensory receptor modifier or chemosensory receptor ligand modifier.

In another example, a test entity suitable to interact with one or more interacting sites containing one or more interacting residues of S40, S144, Y103, D142, and P277 of human T1R2 is indicative of a candidate for a T1R2 receptor ligand enhancer with respect to sucrose or sucralose or any ligand with a structure similar to sucrose or sucralose or any ligand interacting with T1R2 in a way similar to that of sucrose or sucralose, e.g., via one or more interacting spaces and/or residues used by sucrose or sucralose.

In other embodiments of Formula (XXII), compounds having the structures below are provided: The definitions and substituents for various genus and subgenus of the present compounds have been described above in detail. It should be understood by one skilled in the art that any combination of the definitions and substituents described above should not result in a inoperable species or compound. By “inoperable species or compound”, it is meant a compound structure that violates the relevant scientific principle (such as, for example, a carbon atom connecting to more than four covalent bonds) or is so unstable that separation of the compound from a reaction is impossible (such as, for example, more than three carbonyl groups connecting to each other continuously). In one embodiment, the present invention provides a process of preparing a compound having structural Formula (a): comprising reacting a compound having structural Formula (b) with a base, wherein D is oxygen or sulfur; A is —NH2 or —ORb; R17 is hydrogen, alkyl, substituted alkyl, aryl, substituted aryl, arylalkyl, or substituted arylalkyl; R26 and R27 are independently hydrogen, alkyl, substituted alkyl, aryl, substituted aryl, arylalkyl, substituted arylalkyl, acyl, substituted acyl, heteroalkyl, substituted heteroalkyl, heteroaryl, substituted heteroaryl, heteroarylalkyl, substituted heteroarylalkyl, —CN, —NO2, —OR31, —S(O)hR31, —NR31R32, —CONR31R32, —CO2R31, —SO2NR31R32, or —NR31SO2R32; or alternatively R26 and R27, together with the atoms to which they are bonded, form a cycloalkyl, substituted cycloalkyl, heterocycloalkyl, or substituted heterocycloalkyl ring; Ar is aryl or substituted aryl; and Ra is —CN, —C(O)Rb, —C(O)ORb, —C(O)N(Rb)2; each Rb is independently hydrogen, alkyl, substituted alkyl, aryl, substituted aryl, arylalkyl, substituted arylalkyl, acyl, substituted acyl, heteroalkyl, substituted heteroalkyl, heteroaryl, substituted heteroaryl, heteroarylalkyl, or substituted heteroarylalkyl; h is 0, 1 or 2; and R31 and R32 are independently hydrogen, alkyl, substituted alkyl, aryl, substituted aryl, arylalkyl, substituted arylalkyl, acyl, substituted acyl, heteroalkyl, substituted heteroalkyl, heteroaryl, substituted heteroaryl, heteroarylalkyl or substituted heteroarylalkyl; or alternatively R31 and R32, together with the atoms to which they are bonded, form a cycloheteroalkyl or substituted cycloheteroalkyl ring. It is preferable that the base is an inorganic base, such as NaOH. In one embodiment, the compound having structural Formula (b) is prepared by reacting a compound having structural Formula (c): with a compound having structural Formula (d): Preferably, the above Ar group is phenyl or substituted phenyl.

It is preferable that the base is an inorganic base, such as NaOH. In another embodiment, the present invention provides a process of preparing a compound having structural Formula (e): comprising reacting a compound having structural Formula (g) with NH2S(O)2NH2 or Cl—S(O)2—NH2 in the presence of a base to provide directly a compound having structural Formula (e); or alternatively to provide the compound having structural formula (f) which is further reacted with a base to provide a compound having structural Formula (e). It is preferable that the base is an organic base, such as DBU. In general, the compounds of the present invention, e.g., compounds with the formulae described herein can be synthesized according to the processes described above and the following exemplary procedures and/or schemes. As discussed hereinabove, a salt of the compound of the present invention generally can be formed by reacting the compound with an acid or base. In one embodiment, the present invention further provides a synthetic method for preparing a salt of the compound having any of the above-mentioned structural formula at a large scale. The synthetic method enables preparation of a large quantity of a salt of the present compound quickly and economically. The synthetic method can be applied in either a laboratory setting or an industrial setting. One example of the synthetic method is described in details as Example 165 hereinbelow. In general, the compounds of the present invention, e.g., compounds with the formulae described herein can be synthesized according to the following exemplary procedures and/or schemes. Pyrimidines B including fused pyrimidine derivatives such as quinazolines and pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidines are synthesized from 2-amino nitriles, 2-amino ketones, or 2-amino carboxyl derivatives A by reaction with the corresponding carboxyl derivatives as illustrated in Scheme 1 (Rad-Moghadam et al., J. of Heterocyclic Chem. 2006, 43, 913; Roy et al., J. Org. Chem. 2006, 71, 382; Jung et al., J. Med. Chem. 2006, 49, 955; Khabnadideh et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2005, 13, 2637). The amino group in the starting material A can be further functionalized by alkylation (Brown et al., J. Med. Chem. 1990, 33, 1771) or reductive amination (Uehling et al., J. Med. Chem. 2006, 49, 2758, etc.) to provide the corresponding N-monosubstituted 2-amino nitriles, 2-amino ketones or 2-amino carboxyl derivatives C. The coupling reaction of A or C with iso(thio)cyanates such as, for example, benzoyliso(thio)cyanates and subsequent cyclization by treatment with NaOH provides the pyrimidin-2(1H)-(thi)one derivatives E including, but not limited to, fused pyrimidin-2(1H)-(thi)ones such as quinazolin-2(1H)-(thi)one and pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidin-2(1H)-(thi)one derivatives (El-Sherbeny et al., Med. Chem. Rev. 2000, 10, 122 and references cited therein; Reddy et al., Synthetic Commun. 1988, 18, 525; Wilson, Org. Lett. 2001, 3, 585, and references cited therein). Direct cyclization of A or C with (thio)ureas in the presence of NaOH also results in the formation of pyrimidin-2(1H)-(thi)one derivatives E (Scheme 1) (Naganawa et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2006, 14, 7121 and references cited therein). Pyrimidines B and pyrimidin-2(1H)-(thi)ones E can also be prepared from corresponding 1,3-dicarbonyl derivatives and α,β-unsaturated carbonyl derivatives by condensation with guanidines, amidines, or (thio)urea derivatives as shown in Scheme 2 (Sharma et al., Eur. J. Med. Chem. 2006, 41, 83, and references cited therein; Bellur et al., Tetrahedron 2006, 62, 5426 and references cited therein; Hauser et al., J. Org. Chem. 1953, 18, 588). Various pyrimidines and pyrimidin-2(1H)-(thi)ones as well as their fused pyrimidine and pyrimidin-2(1H)-(thi)one derivatives such as quinazolines and quinazolin-2(1H)-ones can be synthesized from pyrimidine-2,4(1H, 3H)-dione derivatives as well as the fused pyrimidine-2,4(1H, 3H)-diones such as quinazoline-2,4(1H, 3H)-dione and pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine-2,4(1H, 3H)-dione derivatives (Scheme 3). Reaction of pyrimidine-2,4(1H, 3H)-dione derivatives with phosgene or POCl3 provides the corresponding 2,4-dichloropyrimidines (Lee et al., Synlett. 2006, 65 and references cited therein). Subsequent displacements of the two chlorides with various nucleophiles resulted in the formation of pyrimidines and pyrimidin-2(1H)-(thi)ones as well as fused pyrimidine and pyrimidin-2(1H)-(thi)one derivatives (Kanuma et al., Bioorg. & Med. Chem. Lett. 2005, 15, 3853 and references cited therein; Liu et al., Bioorg. & Med. Chem. Lett. 2007, 17, 668; Wilson et al., Bioorg. & Med. Chem. 2007, 15, 77; Boarland et al., J. Chem. Soc. 1951, 1218). Similarly, [1,2,6]thiadiazine-2,2-dioxides and fused [1,2,6]thiadiazine-2,2-dioxide derivatives such as, for example, 1H-benzo[c][1,2,6]thiadiazine-2,2-dioxides are also synthesized from 2-amino nitriles, 2-amino ketones, or 2-amino carboxyl derivatives A or C (Scheme 4), by reaction with NH2SO2Cl (Hirayama et al., Bioorg. & Med. Chem. 2002, 10, 1509; Kanbe et al., Bioorg. & Med. Chem. Lett. 2006, 16, 4090 and references cited therein) or NH2SO2NH2 (Maryanoff et al., J. Med. Chem. 2006, 49, 3496, and references cited therein) and followed by cyclization in the presence of NaOH (Goya et al., Heterocycles, 1986, 24, 3451; Albrecht et al., J. Org. Chem. 1979, 44, 4191; Goya et al., Arch. Pharm. (Weinheim) 1984, 317, 777). The condensation of the corresponding 1,3-dicarbonyl derivatives, α,β-unsaturated carbonyl derivatives with sulfamide derivatives (Scheme 4) also results in the formation of [1,2,6]thiadiazine-2,2-dioxide derivatives (Wright, J. Org. Chem. 1964, 29, 1905). Methods for the synthesis of thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine derivatives are described in Scheme 5. 2-Amino thiophene derivatives 303 are synthesized via the Gewald reaction (Chen et al., Synthetic Communication 2004, 34, 3801 and references cited therein; Elmegeed et al., Eur. J. Med. Chem. 2005, 40, 1283 and references cited therein). Compound 303 can be cyclized with the corresponding carboxyl derivatives to give the thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine derivatives 304 (Rad-Moghadam, J. Heterocyclic Chem. 2006, 43, 913; Seijas et al., Tetrahedron Lett. 2000, 41, 2215, and references cited therein; Jung et al., J. Med. Chem. 2006, 49, 955). 2-Amino thiophene derivatives 303 can be further alkylated by either treatment with R3Br/K2CO3 or with RCHO/NaBH(OAc)3 to give the N-alkylated 2-amino thiophene derivatives 305 (Brown et al., J. Med. Chem. 1990, 33, 1771; Uehling et al., J. Med. Chem. 2006, 49, 2758 and references cited therein), which are then reacted, for example, with benzoyliso(thio)cyanate to give the corresponding benzoyl (thio)urea derivatives 306. Compounds 306 may be cyclized by treatment with NaOH to provide thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine derivatives 7 (El-Sherbeny et al., Med. Chem. Rev. 2000, 10, 122, and references cited therein; Reddy et al., Synthetic Commun. 1988, 18, 525; Wilson, Org. Lett. 2001, 3, 585 and references cited therein). When R3═H, compounds 307 may be reacted with R5Br/NaOH to give the alkylated products 8 (Hirota et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2003, 11, 2715). When R4═NH2, the amino group can be further functionalized to give the products 309. Similarly, quinazolin-2(1H)-one and quinazolin-2(1H)-thione derivatives 402 were synthesized from various 2-aminobenzoic acid derivatives, 2-aminobenzonitrile derivatives, 2-aminoacetophenone derivatives and 2-aminobenzamide derivatives 400 as shown in Scheme 6. Coupling reaction of compounds 400 with benzoyl iso(thio)cyanates lead to the formation of corresponding benzoyl (thio)urea derivatives 401. Their cyclization in the presence of NaOH provides the quinazolin-2(1H)-(thi)one derivatives 402 (El-Sherbeny, Med. Chem. Rev. 2000, 10, 122 and references cited therein; Reddy et al., Synthetic Commun. 1988, 18, 525; Wilson, Org. Lett. 2001, 3, 585 and references cited therein). 1H-benzo[c][1,2,6]thiadiazine-2,2-dioxide derivatives 404 are synthesized from the same starting materials 400 (Scheme 7) via their reactions with sulfamide or sulfamoyl chloride, followed by cyclization with NaOH. Direct reaction of compounds 400 with sulfamide in the presence of DBU at the elevated temperature also resulted in the formation of 1H-benzo[c][1,2,6]thiadiazine-2,2-dioxide derivatives 404 (Maryanoff et al., J. Med. Chem. 2006, 49, 3496, and references cited therein). Quinazoline derivatives are also synthesized from quinazoline-2,4(1H, 3H)-diones (Scheme 8). Reaction of quinazoline-2,4(1H, 3H)-diones with POCl3 provided the corresponding dichloroquinazolines (Zunszain et al., Bioorg. & Med. Chem. 2005, 13, 3681 and references cited therein). Subsequent displacements of the two chlorides with various nucleophiles resulted in formation of quinazoline derivatives (Scheme 8) (Kanuma et al., Bioorg. & Med. Chem. Lett. 2005, 15, 3853 and references cited therein; Blackburn, Bioorg. & Med. Chem. Lett. 2006, 16, 2621). 4-Amino-5,6,7,8-tetrahydroquinazolin-2(1H)-(thi)one derivatives and 4-amino-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-1H-benzo[c][1,2,6]thiadiazine-2,2-dioxide derivatives, as well as structural analogs with different ring sizes, as shown in Scheme 9, are generally synthesized according to the methods described therein. Thorpe-Ziegler cyclization of dinitriles in the presence of base provides β-amino-α,β-unsaturated nitrile derivatives (Winkler et al., Tetrahedron 2005, 61, 4249; Yoshizawa et al., Green Chem. 2002, 4, 68, and references cited therein; Rodriguez-Hahn et al., Synthetic Commun. 1984, 14, 967, and references cited therein; Francis et al., J. Med. Chem. 1991, 34, 2899). The β-amino-α,β-unsaturated nitriles may be reacted, for example, with benzoyliso(thio)cyanate and subsequently cyclized by treatment with NaOH to provide 4-amino-5,6,7,8-tetrahydroquinazolin-2(1H)-(thi)one derivatives (El-Sherbeny et al., Med. Chem. Rev. 2000, 10, 122, and references cited therein; Reddy et al., Synthetic Commun. 1988, 18, 525) as well as their structural analogs with different ring sizes (Scheme 9). Similarly reaction of β-amino-α,β-unsaturated nitrile derivatives with sulfamoyl chloride, followed by treatment with NaOH provides 4-amino-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-1H-benzo[c][1,2,6]thiadiazine-2,2-dioxide derivatives, as well as structural analogs with different ring size (Scheme 9) (Hirayama et al., Bioorg. & Med. Chem. 2002, 10, 1509; Kanbe et al., Bioorg. & Med. Chem. Lett. 2006, 16, 4090 and references cited therein). Acesulfame and fused acesulfame derivatives C such as benzo[e][1,2,3]oxathiazin-4(3H)-one-2,2-dioxides can be synthesized via the reaction of 1,3-dicarbonyl derivatives A or 2-hydroxy carboxyl derivatives B and D with SO3 or ClSO2NH2, as described in Scheme 10 (Linkies et al, Synthesis 1990, 405 and references cited therein; Ahmed et al., J. Org. Chem. 1988, 53, 4112; Ahmed et al., Heterocycles 1989, 29, 1391). Acesulfame derivatives C can also be synthesized via cyclization of alkynes or enols with FSO2NCO (Clauss et al., Tetrahedron Lett. 1970, 2, 119) or ClSO2NCO (Rasmussen et al., J. Org. Chem. 1973, 38, 2114; Etter et al., J. Org. Chem. 1986, 51, 5405; Tripathi et al., Indian J. Chem. Sect. B 1987, 26B, 1082) as shown in Scheme 11. Saccharin derivatives may be synthesized by direct oxidative cyclization of N-alkyl-o-methyl-arenesulfonamides as shown in Scheme 12 (Xu et al., Tetrahedron 2006, 62, 7902 and references cited therein; Pal et al., Letters in Drug Design & Discovery 2005, 2, 329). Cyclization of o-carboxyl-arenesulfonyl chloride derivatives with primary amines can also provide saccharin derivatives (Robinson et al., Eur. J. Org. Chem. 2006, 19, 4483 and references cited therein; Yamada et al., J. Med. Chem. 2005, 48, 7457 and references cited therein; Da Settimo et al., J. Med. Chem. 2005, 48, 6897). Other heteroaromatic fused isothiazol-3(2H)-one-1,1-dioxide derivatives may be synthesized similarly. According to the present invention, chemosensory receptor modifiers or chemosensory receptor ligand modifiers of the present invention can be used for one or more methods of the present invention, e.g., modulating a chemosensory receptor and/or its ligands. In general, chemosensory receptor modifiers and chemosensory receptor ligand modifiers of the present invention are provided in a composition, such as, e.g., an ingestible composition. As used herein, an “ingestible composition” includes any substance intended for oral consumption either alone or together with another substance. The ingestible composition includes both “food or beverage products” and “non-edible products”. By “Food or beverage products”, it is meant any edible product intended for consumption by humans or animals, including solids, semi-solids, or liquids (e.g., beverages). The term “non-edible products” or “noncomestible composition” includes supplements, nutraceuticals, functional food products (e.g., any fresh or processed food claimed to have a health-promoting and/or disease-preventing properties beyond the basic nutritional function of supplying nutrients), pharmaceutical and over the counter medications, oral care products such as dentifrices and mouthwashes, cosmetic products such as sweetened lip balms and other personal care products that use sucralose and or other sweeteners. The ingestible composition also includes pharmaceutical, medicinal or comestible composition, or alternatively in a formulation, e.g., a pharmaceutical or medicinal formulation or a food or beverage product or formulation. In one embodiment, the chemosensory receptor modifiers or chemosensory receptor ligand modifiers provided by the present invention can be used at very low concentrations on the order of a few parts per million, in combination with one or more known sweeteners, natural or artificial, so as to reduce the concentration of the known sweetener required to prepare an ingestible composition having the desired degree of sweetness. Commonly used known or artificial sweeteners for use in such combinations of sweeteners include but are not limited to the common saccharide sweeteners, e.g., sucrose, fructose, glucose, and sweetener compositions comprising natural sugars, such as corn syrup (including high fructose corm syrup) or other syrups or sweetener concentrates derived from natural fruit and vegetable sources, semi-synthetic “sugar alcohol” sweeteners such as erythritol, isomalt, lactitol, mannitol, sorbitol, xylitol, maltodextrin, and the like, and artificial sweeteners such as aspartame, saccharin, acesulfame-K, cyclamate, sucralose, and alitame.

Exemplary comestible compositions also include breakfast cereals, sweet beverages or solid or liquid concentrate compositions for preparing beverages, ideally so as to enable the reduction in concentration of previously known saccharide sweeteners, or artificial sweeteners. Typically at least a chemosensory receptor modulating amount, a chemosensory receptor ligand modulating amount, a sweet flavor modulating amount, a sweet flavoring agent amount, or a sweet flavor enhancing amount of one or more of the chemosensory receptor modifiers or chemosensory receptor ligand modifiers of the present invention will be added to the comestible or medicinal product, optionally in the presence of known sweeteners, e.g., so that the sweet flavor modified comestible or medicinal product has an increased sweet taste as compared to the comestible or medicinal product prepared without the modifiers of the present invention, as judged by human beings or animals in general, or in the case of formulations testing, as judged by a majority of a panel of at least eight human taste testers, via procedures commonly known in the field. The concentration of sweet flavoring agent needed to modulate or improve the flavor of the comestible or medicinal product or composition will of course depend on many variables, including the specific type of comestible composition and its various other ingredients, especially the presence of other known sweet flavoring agents and the concentrations thereof, the natural genetic variability and individual preferences and health conditions of various human beings tasting the compositions, and the subjective effect of the particular compound on the taste of such chemosensory compounds. One application of the chemosensory receptor modifiers and/or chemosensory receptor ligand modifiers is for modulating (inducing, enhancing or inhibiting) the sweet taste or other taste properties of other natural or synthetic sweet tastants, and comestible compositions made therefrom. A broad but also low range of concentrations of the compounds or entities of the present invention would typically be required, i.e., from about 0.001 ppm to 100 ppm, or narrower alternative ranges from about 0.1 ppm to about 10 ppm, from about 0.01 ppm to about 30 ppm, from about 0.05 ppm to about 10 ppm, from about 0.01 ppm to about 5 ppm, or from about 0.02 ppm to about 2 ppm, or from about 0.01 ppm to about 1 ppm. In yet another embodiment, the chemosensory receptor modifier and chemosensory receptor ligand modifier of the present invention can be provided in pharmaceutical compositions containing a therapeutically effective amount of one or more compounds of the present invention, preferably in purified form, together with a suitable amount of a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle, so as to provide the form for proper administration to a patient. When administered to a patient, the compounds of the present invention and pharmaceutically acceptable vehicles are preferably sterile. Water is a preferred vehicle when a compound of the present invention is administered intravenously. Saline solutions and aqueous dextrose and glycerol solutions can also be employed as liquid vehicles, particularly for injectable solutions. Suitable pharmaceutical vehicles also include excipients such as starch, glucose, lactose, sucrose, gelatin, malt, rice, flour, chalk, silica gel, sodium stearate, glycerol monostearate, talc, sodium chloride, dried skim milk, glycerol, propylene, glycol, water, ethanol and the like. The present pharmaceutical compositions, if desired, can also contain minor amounts of wetting or emulsifying agents, or pH buffering agents. In addition, auxiliary, stabilizing, thickening, lubricating and coloring agents may be used. Pharmaceutical compositions comprising a compound of the present invention may be manufactured by means of conventional mixing, dissolving, granulating, dragee-making, levigating, emulsifying, encapsulating, entrapping or lyophilizing processes. Pharmaceutical compositions may be formulated in conventional manner using one or more physiologically acceptable carriers, diluents, excipients or auxiliaries, which facilitate processing of compounds of the present invention into preparations which can be used pharmaceutically. Proper formulation is dependent upon the route of administration chosen. The present pharmaceutical compositions can take the form of solutions, suspensions, emulsion, tablets, pills, pellets, capsules, capsules containing liquids, powders, sustained-release formulations, suppositories, emulsions, aerosols, sprays, suspensions, or any other form suitable for use. In some embodiments, the pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle is a capsule (see e.g., Grosswald et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,698,155). Other examples of suitable pharmaceutical vehicles have been described in the art (see Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, Philadelphia College of Pharmacy and Science, 20th Edition, 2000). For topical administration a compound of the present invention may be formulated as solutions, gels, ointments, creams, suspensions, etc. as is well-known in the art. Systemic formulations include those designed for administration by injection, e.g., subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, intrathecal or intraperitoneal injection, as well as those designed for transdermal, transmucosal, oral or pulmonary administration. Systemic formulations may be made in combination with a further active agent that improves mucociliary clearance of airway mucus or reduces mucous viscosity. These active agents include, but are not limited to, sodium channel blockers, antibiotics, N-acetyl cysteine, homocysteine and phospholipids. In some embodiments, the compounds of the present invention are formulated in accordance with routine procedures as a pharmaceutical composition adapted for intravenous administration to human beings. Typically, compounds of the present invention for intravenous administration are solutions in sterile isotonic aqueous buffer. For injection, a compound of the present invention may be formulated in aqueous solutions, preferably in physiologically compatible buffers such as Hanks' solution, Ringer's solution, or physiological saline buffer. The solution may contain formulatory agents such as suspending, stabilizing and/or dispersing agents. When necessary, the pharmaceutical compositions may also include a solubilizing agent. Pharmaceutical compositions for intravenous administration may optionally include a local anesthetic such as lignocaine to ease pain at the site of the injection. Generally, the ingredients are supplied either separately or mixed together in unit dosage form, for example, as a lyophilized powder or water free concentrate in a hermetically sealed container such as an ampoule or sachette indicating the quantity of active agent. When the compound of the present invention is administered by infusion, it can be dispensed, for example, with an infusion bottle containing sterile pharmaceutical grade water or saline. When the compound of the present invention is administered by injection, an ampoule of sterile water for injection or saline can be provided so that the ingredients may be mixed prior to administration. For transmucosal administration, penetrants appropriate to the barrier to be permeated are used in the formulation. Such penetrants are generally known in the art. Pharmaceutical compositions for oral delivery may be in the form of tablets, lozenges, aqueous or oily suspensions, granules, powders, emulsions, capsules, syrups, or elixirs, for example. Orally administered pharmaceutical compositions may contain one or more optionally agents, for example, sweetening agents such as fructose, aspartame or saccharin; flavoring agents such as peppermint, oil of wintergreen, or cherry coloring agents and preserving agents, to provide a pharmaceutically palatable preparation. Moreover, where in tablet or pill form, the pharmaceutical compositions may be coated to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract, thereby providing a sustained action over an extended period of time. Selectively permeable membranes surrounding an osmotically active driving compound are also suitable for orally administered compounds of the present invention. In these later platforms, fluid from the environment surrounding the capsule is imbibed by the driving compound, which swells to displace the agent or agent composition through an aperture. These delivery platforms can provide an essentially zero order delivery profile as opposed to the spiked profiles of immediate release formulations. A time delay material such as glycerol monostearate or glycerol stearate may also be used. Oral compositions can include standard vehicles such as mannitol, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, sodium saccharine, cellulose, magnesium carbonate, etc. Such vehicles are preferably of pharmaceutical grade. For oral liquid preparations such as, for example, suspensions, elixirs and solutions, suitable carriers, excipients or diluents include water, saline, alkyleneglycols (e.g., propylene glycol), polyalkylene glycols (e.g., polyethylene glycol) oils, alcohols, slightly acidic buffers between pH 4 and pH 6 (e.g., acetate, citrate, ascorbate at between about 5.0 mM to about 50.0 mM) etc. Additionally, flavoring agents, preservatives, coloring agents, bile salts, acylcarnitines and the like may be added. For buccal administration, the pharmaceutical compositions may take the form of tablets, lozenges, etc. formulated in conventional manner. Liquid drug formulations suitable for use with nebulizers and liquid spray devices and EHD aerosol devices will typically include a compound of the present invention with a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle. Preferably, the pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle is a liquid such as alcohol, water, polyethylene glycol or a perfluorocarbon. Optionally, another material may be added to alter the aerosol properties of the solution or suspension of compounds of the invention. Preferably, this material is liquid such as an alcohol, glycol, polyglycol or a fatty acid. Other methods of formulating liquid drug solutions or suspension suitable for use in aerosol devices are known to those of skill in the art (see, e.g., Biesalski, U.S. Pat. No. 5,112,598; Biesalski, U.S. Pat. No. 5,556,611). A compound of the present invention may also be formulated in rectal or vaginal pharmaceutical compositions such as suppositories or retention enemas, e.g., containing conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter or other glycerides. In addition to the formulations described previously, a compound of the present invention may also be formulated as a depot preparation. Such long acting formulations may be administered by implantation (for example, subcutaneously or intramuscularly) or by intramuscular injection. Thus, for example, a compound of the present invention may be formulated with suitable polymeric or hydrophobic materials (for example, as an emulsion in an acceptable oil) or ion exchange resins, or as sparingly soluble derivatives, for example, as a sparingly soluble salt. When a compound of the present invention is acidic, it may be included in any of the above-described formulations as the free acid, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, a solvate or hydrate. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts substantially retain the activity of the free acid, may be prepared by reaction with bases and tend to be more soluble in aqueous and other protic solvents than the corresponding free acid form. A compound of the present invention, and/or pharmaceutical composition thereof, will generally be used in an amount effective to achieve the intended purpose. For use to treat or prevent diseases or disorders the compounds of the present invention and/or pharmaceutical compositions thereof, are administered or applied in a therapeutically effective amount. The amount of a compound of the present invention that will be effective in the treatment of a particular disorder or condition disclosed herein will depend on the nature of the disorder or condition and can be determined by standard clinical techniques known in the art. In addition, in vitro or in vivo assays may optionally be employed to help identify optimal dosage ranges. The amount of a compound of the present invention administered will, of course, be dependent on, among other factors, the subject being treated, the weight of the subject, the severity of the affliction, the manner of administration and the judgment of the prescribing physician. For example, the dosage may be delivered in a pharmaceutical composition by a single administration, by multiple applications or controlled release. In some embodiment, the compounds of the present invention are delivered by oral sustained release administration. Dosing may be repeated intermittently, may be provided alone or in combination with other drugs and may continue as long as required for effective treatment of the disease state or disorder. Suitable dosage ranges for oral administration depend on potency, but are generally between about 0.001 mg to about 200 mg of a compound of the present invention per kilogram body weight. Dosage ranges may be readily determined by methods known to the artisan of ordinary skill the art. Suitable dosage ranges for intravenous (i.v.) administration are about 0.01 mg to about 100 mg per kilogram body weight. Suitable dosage ranges for intranasal administration are generally about 0.01 mg/kg body weight to about 1 mg/kg body weight. Suppositories generally contain about 0.01 milligram to about 50 milligrams of a compound of the present invention per kilogram body weight and comprise active ingredient in the range of about 0.5% to about 10% by weight. Recommended dosages for intradermal, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous, epidural, sublingual or intracerebral administration are in the range of about 0.001 mg to about 200 mg per kilogram of body weight. Effective doses may be extrapolated from dose-response curves derived from in vitro or animal model test systems. Such animal models and systems are well-known in the art. Preferably, a therapeutically effective dose of a compound of the present invention described herein will provide therapeutic benefit without causing substantial toxicity. Toxicity of compounds of the present invention may be determined using standard pharmaceutical procedures and may be readily ascertained by the skilled artisan. The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effect is the therapeutic index. A compound of the present invention will preferably exhibit particularly high therapeutic indices in treating disease and disorders. The dosage of a compound of the present invention described herein will preferably be within a range of circulating concentrations that include an effective dose with little or no toxicity. In certain embodiments of the present invention, the compounds of the present invention and/or pharmaceutical compositions thereof can be used in combination therapy with at least one other agent. The compound of the present invention and/or pharmaceutical composition thereof and the other agent can act additively or, more preferably, synergistically. In some embodiments, a compound of the present invention and/or pharmaceutical composition thereof is administered concurrently with the administration of another agent, which may be part of the same pharmaceutical composition as the compound of the present invention or a different pharmaceutical composition. In other embodiments, a pharmaceutical composition of the present invention is administered prior or subsequent to administration of another agent. In still another embodiment, the chemosensory receptor modifiers and chemosensory receptor ligand modifiers of the present invention and/or pharmaceutical compositions thereof may be advantageously used in human medicine. When used to treat and/or prevent diseases or disorders, the compounds described herein and/or pharmaceutical compositions may be administered or applied singly, or in combination with other agents. The compounds and/or pharmaceutical compositions thereof may also be administered or applied singly, in combination with other active agents. Methods of treatment and prophylaxis by administration to a patient of a therapeutically effective amount of a compound described herein and/or pharmaceutical composition thereof are provided herein. The patient may be an animal, more preferably, a mammal and most preferably, a human. In one example, the compounds described herein and/or pharmaceutical compositions thereof, are administered orally. The compounds of the present invention and/or pharmaceutical compositions thereof may also be administered by any other convenient route, for example, by infusion or bolus injection, by absorption through epithelial or mucocutaneous linings (e.g., oral mucosa, rectal and intestinal mucosa, etc.). Administration can be systemic or local. Various delivery systems are known, (e.g., encapsulation in liposomes, microparticles, microcapsules, capsules, etc.) that can be used to administer a compound described herein and/or pharmaceutical composition thereof. Methods of administration include, but are not limited to, intradermal, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intravenous, subcutaneous, intranasal, epidural, oral, sublingual, intranasal, intracerebral, intravaginal, transdermal, rectally, by inhalation, or topically, particularly to the ears, nose, eyes, or skin. The preferred mode of administration is left to the discretion of the practitioner and will depend in-part upon the site of the medical condition. In most instances, administration will result in the release of the compounds and/or pharmaceutical compositions thereof into the bloodstream. In another example, it may be desirable to administer one or more compounds of the present invention and/or pharmaceutical composition thereof locally to the area in need of treatment. This may be achieved, for example, and not by way of limitation, by local infusion during surgery, topical application, e.g., in conjunction with a wound dressing after surgery, by injection, by means of a catheter, by means of a suppository, or by means of an implant, said implant being of a porous, non-porous, or gelatinous material, including membranes, such as sialastic membranes, or fibers. In one embodiment, administration can be by direct injection at the site (or former site) of the condition. In yet another example, it may be desirable to introduce one or more compounds of the present invention and/or pharmaceutical compositions thereof into the central nervous system by any suitable route, including intraventricular, intrathecal and epidural injection. Intraventricular injection may be facilitated by an intraventricular catheter, for example, attached to a reservoir, such as an Ommaya reservoir. A compound of the present invention and/or pharmaceutical composition thereof may also be administered directly to the lung by inhalation. For administration by inhalation, a compound of the present invention and/or pharmaceutical composition thereof may be conveniently delivered to the lung by a number of different devices. For example, a Metered Dose Inhaler (“MDI”), which utilizes canisters that contain a suitable low boiling propellant, (e.g., dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethane, carbon dioxide or any other suitable gas) may be used to deliver compounds of the present invention and/or pharmaceutical compositions thereof directly to the lung. Alternatively, a Dry Powder Inhaler (“DPI”) device may be used to administer a compound of the invention and/or pharmaceutical composition thereof to the lung. DPI devices typically use a mechanism such as a burst of gas to create a cloud of dry powder inside a container, which may then be inhaled by the patient. DPI devices are also well known in the art. A popular variation is the multiple dose DPI (“MDDPI”) system, which allows for the delivery of more than one therapeutic dose. For example, capsules and cartridges of gelatin for use in an inhaler or insufflator may be formulated containing a powder mix of a compound of the present invention and a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch for these systems. Another type of device that may be used to deliver a compound of the present invention and/or pharmaceutical composition thereof to the lung is a liquid spray device supplied, for example, by Aradigm Corporation, Hayward, Calif. Liquid spray systems use extremely small nozzle holes to aerosolize liquid drug formulations that may then be directly inhaled into the lung. In yet another example, a nebulizer is used to deliver a compound of the present invention and/or pharmaceutical composition thereof to the lung. Nebulizers create aerosols from liquid drug formulations by using, for example, ultrasonic energy to form fine particles that may be readily inhaled (see e.g., Verschoyle et al., British J. Cancer, 1999, 80, Suppl. 2, 96). Examples of nebulizers include devices supplied by Sheffield Pharmaceuticals, Inc (See, Armer et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,954,047; van der Linden et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,950,619; van der Linden et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,970,974), and Batelle Pulmonary Therapeutics, Columbus, Ohio. In yet another example, an electrohydrodynamic (“EHD”) aerosol device is used to deliver a compound of the present invention and/or pharmaceutical composition thereof to the lung. EHD aerosol devices use electrical energy to aerosolize liquid drug solutions or suspensions (see e.g., Noakes et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,765,539). The electrochemical properties of the formulation may be important parameters to optimize when delivering a compound of the present invention and/or pharmaceutical composition thereof to the lung with an EHD aerosol device and such optimization is routinely performed by one of skill in the art. EHD aerosol devices may more efficiently deliver compounds to the lung than other pulmonary delivery technologies. In yet another example, the compounds of the present invention and/or pharmaceutical compositions thereof can be delivered in a vesicle, in particular a liposome (Langer, 1990, Science 249:1527-1533; Treat et al., in “Liposomes in the Therapy of Infectious Disease and Cancer,” Lopez-Berestein and Fidler (eds.), Liss, New York, pp. 353-365 (1989); see generally “Liposomes in the Therapy of Infectious Disease and Cancer,” Lopez-Berestein and Fidler (eds.), Liss, New York, pp. 353-365 (1989)). In yet another example, the compounds of the present invention and/or pharmaceutical compositions thereof can be delivered via sustained release systems, preferably oral sustained release systems. In one embodiment, a pump may be used (See, Langer, supra, Sefton, 1987, CRC Crit. Ref Biomed Eng. 14:201; Saudek et al., 1989, N. Engl. J Med. 321:574). In yet another example, polymeric materials can be used (see “Medical Applications of Controlled Release,” Langer and Wise (eds.), CRC Pres., Boca Raton, Fla. (1974); “Controlled Drug Bioavailability,” Drug Product Design and Performance, Smolen and Ball (eds.), Wiley, New York (1984); Langer et al., 1983, J Macromol. Sci. Rev. Macromol Chem. 23:61; see also Levy et al., 1985, Science 228: 190; During et al., 1989, Ann. Neurol. 25:351; Howard et al., 1989, J. Neurosurg. 71:105). In still other embodiments, polymeric materials are used for oral sustained release delivery. Preferred polymers include sodium carboxymethylcellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose and hydroxyethylcellulose (most preferred, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose). Other preferred cellulose ethers have been described (Alderman, Int. J. Pharm. Tech. & Prod. Mfr., 1984, 5(3) 1-9). Factors affecting drug release are well known to the skilled artisan and have been described in the art (Bamba et al., Int. J. Pharm., 1979, 2, 307). In yet another example, enteric-coated preparations can be used for oral sustained release administration. Preferred coating materials include polymers with a pH-dependent solubility (i.e., pH-controlled release), polymers with a slow or pH-dependent rate of swelling, dissolution or erosion (i.e., time-controlled release), polymers that are degraded by enzymes (i.e., enzyme-controlled release) and polymers that form firm layers that are destroyed by an increase in pressure (i.e., pressure-controlled release). In still another example, osmotic delivery systems are used for oral sustained release administration (Verma et al., Drug Dev. Ind. Pharm., 2000, 26:695-708). In yet other embodiments, OROS™ osmotic devices are used for oral sustained release delivery devices (Theeuwes et al., U.S. Pat. No. 3,845,770; Theeuwes et al., U.S. Pat. No. 3,916,899). In still another example, a controlled-release system can be placed in proximity of the target of the compounds and/or pharmaceutical composition of the invention, thus requiring only a fraction of the systemic dose (See, e.g., Goodson, in “Medical Applications of Controlled Release,” supra, vol. 2, pp. 115-138 (1984). Other controlled-release systems discussed in Langer, 1990, Science 249:1527-1533 may also be used. Having now generally described the invention, the same will be more readily understood by reference to the following examples, which are provided by way of illustration and are not intended as limiting. It is understood that various modifications and changes can be made to the herein disclosed exemplary embodiments without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. EXAMPLES Experiment 1 Modeling and Identification of Potential Chemosensory Receptor Ligand Enhancer General Procedure The general procedures for identifying a potential chemosensory receptor ligand enhancer is summarized as the following. 1. Constructing a model of the structure of the Venus flytrap T1R2 domain 2. Docking a chemosensory receptor ligand, e.g., a sweetener into the active site of the structure of the Venus flytrap domain of T1R2, with or without T1R3 present 3. Docking a chemosensory receptor ligand enhancer, e.g., a sweet enhancer into the active site in the presence of the chemosensory receptor ligand, e.g., the sweetener 4. Selecting a chemosensory receptor ligand enhancer, e.g., sweet enhancer candidate based on two criteria: a) it fits the active site in the model, and b) it forms productive interactions with the Venus flytrap domain of T1R2 and with the chemosensory receptor ligand, e.g., the sweetener. Interactions can be van der Waals, burial of hydrophobic atoms or atomic groups, hydrogen bonds, ring stacking interactions, or salt-bridging electrostatic interactions. Key residues for such interactions include the hinge residues, the near active site, the pincer residues, e.g., interacting residues described in the present invention. Candidates are not restricted to fitting completely within the active site, as it is open and chemosensory receptor ligand enhancer candidates may extend beyond the active site as long as they partially extend into it. Model of the Structure A model of the structure of the Venus Flytrap T1R2 domain may come from crystal structures of T1R2 or of T1R2 complexed with T1R3. The domains may be in open or in closed form, and may or may not be APO or contain a ligand. Alternatively a model of the structure of the Venus Flytrap T1R2 domain may be built using standard homology modeling methods using crystal structures of available Venus flytrap domains such as the mGluR receptor Venus flytrap domains as templates to construct the model. An example of a procedure for building such a model is to use the commercial software Homology or Modeller from the Accelrys Corporation that is well documented in the literature and available commercially. Alternative conformations of the model may further be explored using additional molecular mechanical techniques that may include but are not limited to normal mode analysis to explore relative movement of the lobes of the model, loop generation techniques to generate alternative conformations of loops in the model, or Monte Carlo and/or molecular dynamics simulations. Docking A chemosensory receptor ligand, e.g., sweetener was first docked into the active site of T1R2. Its modeled pose in the active site was selected by its ability to form productive van der Waals, ring stacking, hydrogen bonding, and/or salt bridging interactions with interacting residues within the active site of the Venus flytrap domain of T1R2. A candidate for a chemosensory receptor ligand modifier, e.g., sweet enhancer was then docked into the active site in the presence of the ligand, e.g., the sweetener described in the previous paragraph. Its active pose and its candidacy as a potential chemosensory receptor ligand modifier, e.g., sweet enhancer was based on its ability to form productive interactions in the form of van der Waals, ring stacking, hydrogen bonding, and/or salt bridging interactions with interacting residues described in the present invention, with additional residues of the T1R2 domain, and optionally with the chemosensory receptor ligand, e.g., the sweetener placed in the active site as described above. Candidate for Chemosensory Receptor Ligand Modifiers A molecule was considered a candidate if it can be docked into the active site in the presence of a chemosensory receptor ligand, e.g., sweetener, forming productive interactions with interacting residues described in the present invention. We defined two spaces within the active site: a first space occupied by a chemosensory receptor ligand, e.g., sweetener, and a second space occupied by a chemosensory receptor ligand modifier, e.g., enhancer. Modeling and mutagenesis results established key residues that were considered to be likely to line these spaces for the chemosensory receptor ligand, e.g., sweeteners and chemosensory receptor ligand modifier, e.g., sweet enhancers. In the context of our study, “residue lining the space” meant that the residue had backbone and/or side-chain atoms that were positioned so that they can potentially interact with atoms of the chemosensory receptor ligand, e.g., sweetener (space #1) and/or chemosensory receptor ligand modifier, e.g., sweet enhancer (space #2). While the chemosensory receptor ligand, e.g., sweetener and chemosensory receptor ligand modifier, e.g., sweet enhancer themselves cannot occupy the same space, their corresponding spaces may overlap due to the ability of residues to contact both the chemosensory receptor ligand, e.g., sweetener and the chemosensory receptor ligand modifier, e.g., sweet enhancer, due to protein flexibility, due to ligand flexibility, and due to the potential for multiple binding modes for a chemosensory receptor ligand, e.g., sweetener or chemosensory receptor ligand modifier, e.g., sweet enhancer. Information on important residues lining space #1 and space #2 came from modeling and docking and from site directed mutagenesis. The Hinge Residues are Considered to be Associated with the First Space (Space #1). We have discovered that one of the spaces occupied by a chemosensory receptor ligand, e.g., sweetener is partially lined by residues herein called hinge residues. Many Venus flytrap domains have been crystallized with agonists including mGluR1, mGluR2, and mGluR3 that show agonists forming interactions with homologous residues to those identified herein for T1R2. Many chemosensory receptor ligands, e.g., sweeteners docked to the model of T1R2 can be docked to this region. Our site directed mutagenesis also provides strong evidence to support the finding that hinge residues or residues spatially adjacent to it are key residues to the activation of a chemosensory receptor, e.g., T1R2 related receptor. Since chemosensory receptor ligands, e.g., sweeteners vary in size, there are additional residues lining this first space for larger residues where the list of these additional residues is dependent, partially on the size of the chemosensory receptor ligand, e.g., sweetener. Pincer Residues are Considered to be Associated with the Second Space (Space #2). Venus flytrap domains are known to transition from an “open” state to a “closed” state on agonist binding. The flytrap domain is comprised of two lobes commonly referred to in the literature as the upper lobe and lower lobe. In the “open” state the lobes are further apart, while in the closed state the lobes undergo a relative motion that brings the upper and lower lobe closer together. In addition to direct stabilization of the closed state of T1R2 by the agonist, our modeling study has demonstrated that there is additional stabilization of the closed state through interactions of residues on the upper lobe with corresponding residues on the lower lobe that are herein called the “pincer residues”. We have discovered that an interacting site, e.g., interacting space for a chemosensory receptor ligand modifier, e.g., sweet enhancer is the space that is partially lined by these pincer residues, since additional interactions in this region can further stabilize the closed, agonized form of the Venus flytrap domain. Our site directed mutagenesis study also provides evidence to support the finding that pincer residues and residues spatially adjacent to them are key residues associated with modulation of chemosensory receptor ligand, e.g., enhancement activity of the ligand. The First Space and Second Space can be Swapped. In the above discussion the chemosensory receptor modifier, e.g., sweetener binds to the hinge while the chemosensory receptor ligand modifier, e.g., sweet enhancer binds to the pincer region. This is just one example and should not be construed restrictively. For example, our modeling and docking study has also demonstrated that a likely binding mode for saccharine as an agonist (sweetener) involves binding to the pincer region. Such result was further supported by our site-directed mutagenesis. With a chemosensory receptor modifier, e.g., sweetener bound to the pincer region there is opportunity for further stabilization of the closed form of the Venus flytrap domain through binding of a chemosensory receptor ligand modifier, e.g., sweet enhancer to the hinge region. Procedural Definitions. 1. Docking Docking is generally considered as the process of translating and rotating the candidate molecule relative to a chemosensory receptor, e.g., T1R2 structural model while simultaneously adjusting internal torsional angles of the candidate molecule to fit the candidate molecule into the active site of the chemosensory receptor, e.g., T1R2 structural model. Poses of the candidate molecule (positions, relative orientations, and internal torsions) are selected based on whether the molecule fits the active site, and whether the molecule can form productive van der Waals interactions, hydrogen bonds, ring stacking interactions, and salt bridge interactions with residues of the active site and with the chemosensory receptor ligand, e.g., sweetener. Key residues can be identified. A candidate is considered more likely if it interacts with sets of residues in the active site as the hinge region, the near active site, the pincer residues, and the totality of the active site. It is also considered more likely if it forms direct interactions with a chemosensory receptor ligand, e.g., a sweetener. 2. Homology Modeling Homology modeling is generally considered as the process of constructing a model of the Venus flytrap domain of a chemosensory receptor, e.g., T1R2 from its amino acid sequence and from the three dimensional coordinates of one or more homologous Venus flytrap domain proteins. Homology modeling may be performed using standard methods well-described in the literature and available in commercial software such as the Homology program or Modeler from the Accelrys Corporation. Models based on experimentally determined structures of open and closed forms, as well as animation of models using normal mode analysis, were used to define the pincer residues discussed above. Exemplary Illustrations of Modeling Studies FIGS. 5 to 10 illustrate interacting spaces and residues associated with one of our molecular modeling studies. Experiment 2 Mutagenesis Study for Identification of Chemosensory Receptor Ligand Modifier Enhancer In our previous patent applications (International Publication No. WO07047988 and International Publication No. WO070104709), we described a method using human-rat chimeric sweet-umami chimeric receptors to map the binding sites of sweet and umami tastants. Our data demonstrated that a number of sweeteners, including sucrose, fructose, arspartame, neotame, D-tryptophan (D-Trp), Acesulfame K, saccharin and dulcin, all interact with the T1R2 Venus flytrap domain (VFT), while the umami tastants, including L-glutamate, inosine-5′-monophosphate (IMP), and guanosine-5′-monophosphate (GMP), all interact with the T1R1 Venus flytrap domain. Under the guidance of molecular modeling, we performed site-directed mutagenesis on human T1R2 VFT. The mutagenesis was done using the routine PCR-based method. Human T1R2 mutants were transiently transfected into HEK293 cell together with the human T1R3 wild type cDNA, and the transfected cells were characterized using an automated FLIPR machine or a calcium imaging system as described in our previous patent applications. In order to control for plasma membrane expression, protein folding and other factors that might contribute to changes in receptor activity, we used 2 sweeteners which interact with other domains of the human sweet receptor as positive controls. The 2 control sweeteners were cyclamate and compound X (Senomyx). It is known from our previous data that cyclamate interacts with the human T1R3 transmembrane domain, while compound X interacts with the human T1R2 transmembrane domain. The mutagenesis data for a number of sweeteners are summarized in the following tables. Based on the data, we concluded that 6 residues (S40, S144, S165, Y103, D142, P277) are critical for interaction with those sweeteners.

Using the previously described human-rat chimeric receptors, we mapped the binding site of compound A to hT1R2 VFT. As shown in FIG. 11, compound A enhanced the sucralose activity on human sweet receptor (h2/h3) but not rat sweet receptor (r2/r3). When we replaced the rat receptor T1R2 VFT with its human counterpart (h2-r2/r3), the receptor can be enhanced by compound A. On the other hand, when we replaced the human receptor T1R2 VFT with its rat counterpart (r2-h2/h3), the receptor can no longer be enhanced by compound A. We conclude that compound A interacts with human T1R2 VFT. Due to the different sensitivity of human and rat receptors to sucralose, different sucralose concentrations were used to achieve ˜EC20 of the different receptors. Following compound A, 8 more analogues have been identified to enhance the sucralose activity of human sweet receptor. The same mapping experiments were carried out on these 8 analogues, and we observed the same activity pattern as compound A as summarized in the following table. We conclude that all 8 compound A analogues interact with human T1R2 VFT. After mapping the enhancers to human T1R2 VFT, we performed mutagenesis analysis to further define the interaction site. As summarized in the following table, six residues (K65, D278, L279, D307, R383, V384) were identified as critical for the activities of compound A and analogous. These compounds, namely, compounds A and A1 to A8, are representative compounds of the present invention including compounds of structural Formula (I) and its subgeneric formulas. Interestingly, V384 is also important for the activities of 2 structurally related sweeteners (as shown in FIG. 12), saccharin and acesulfame K (AceK), indicating that these sweeteners might occupy similar space in the human T1R2 VFT. The concentrations for the sweeteners are Aspartame (15 mM), D-Trp (20 mM), Sucrose (200 mM), Sucralose (3.2 mM), AceK (8 mM), Saccharin (3.2 mM), Cyclamate (80 mM), S3819 (25 μM). h2/h3 r2/r3 h2-r2/r3 r2-h2/h3 Compound + — + — A (25 μM) Compound + — + — A1 (25 μM) Compound + — + — A2 (25 μM) Compound + — + — A3 (25 μM) Compound + — + — A4 (25 μM) Compound + — + — A5 (25 μM) Compound + — + — A6 (25 μM) Compound + — + — A7 (25 μM) Compound + — + — A8 (100 μM) Enhancement Activity (at 25 μM) for Compound A and its analogs hT1R2 Sucralose A A4 A1 A5 A2 A6 A3 A8 A7 WT ++ ++ ++ +++ ++ +++ ++ + ++ +++ V384A ++ ++ ++ +++ ++ +++ ++ + ++ +++ E382A ++ ++ ++ +++ ++ +++ ++ + ++ +++ Y103A — + + ++ + ++ + + ++ ++ P277A + ++ + +++ + +++ + + ++ +++ D278A* — ++ + +++ + +++ + + + ++ K65A + — — — — — — — — — L279A ++ — — — — — — — — — V384F ++ + + + + + + — — + S165I ++ ++ ++ +++ ++ +++ ++ + ++ +++ I67A ++ ++ ++ +++ ++ +++ ++ + ++ +++ S165A ++ + ++ +++ ++ +++ ++ + ++ +++ N143A ++ ++ ++ +++ ++ +++ ++ + ++ +++ T326A ++ ++ ++ +++ ++ +++ ++ + ++ +++ T242A ++ ++ ++ +++ ++ +++ ++ + ++ +++ S303A ++ ++ ++ +++ ++ +++ ++ + ++ +++ Q328A ++ ++ ++ +++ ++ +++ ++ + ++ +++ T184V ++ ++ ++ +++ ++ +++ ++ + ++ +++ T184A ++ ++ ++ +++ ++ +++ ++ + ++ +++ V64M ++ ++ ++ +++ ++ +++ ++ + ++ +++ S168T ++ ++ ++ +++ ++ +++ ++ + ++ +++ R383H ++ ++ ++ +++ ++ +++ ++ + ++ +++ S40T + ++ ++ +++ ++ +++ ++ + ++ +++ I167A + + + ++ + ++ + + + ++ E302A + + + ++ + ++ + + + ++ R383F + — — — — — — — — — D307A + — — — — — — — — — D142A — + + ++ + ++ + + + ++ S40A — + + ++ + ++ + + + ++ R383A — + + ++ + ++ + + + ++ A305F — — — — — — — — — — *D278 is a critical residue for the enhancers, because all enhancers in the above table show agonist activity on D278A mutant, i.e., they activate the mutant receptor in the absence of sucralose.

The reaction was stirred at 0° C. for 15 minutes then heated at 80° C. for 70 minutes. After cooling to room temperature, ethanol (920 mL) was removed reduced pressure and aqueous NaCl (30%, 750 mL) was added. The resulting mixture was stirred for 10 minutes and extracted with diethyl ether (1 L). The aqueous layer was further extracted with diethyl ether (500 mL) and the insoluble solids were removed by filtration after which the organic layer was separated and combined with the first diethyl ether extract. The combined organic extract was dried over MgSO4, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was stirred for 2 hours in dichloromethane (300 mL) and a solid was collected. More solid was isolated from the dichloromethane solution cooled to −78° C. The combined solid product was refluxed in dichloromethane (600 mL) for 10 minutes then stirred at room temperature for 30 minutes and cooled to −78° C. The resultant precipitate was collected by filtration to give the crude product (115 g). The filtrate was concentrated and the residue was chromatographed on silica gel (eluent: dichloromethane) to provide a solid that was combined with the previous crude product. The resulting residue was purified by flash chromatography on silica gel (dichloromethane) to yield 2-amino-4,5-dimethylthiophene-3-carbonitrile (105 g, 38%) as an off white solid. 1H NMR (400 MHz, DMSO-d6) δ 1.93 (d, J=1.2 Hz, 3H), 2.07 (d, J=1.2 Hz, 3H), 3.33 (s, 2H).

Experiment 4 Biological Assay An HEK293 cell line derivative (Chandrashekar et al., Cell 100, 703-711, 2000) which stably expresses Gα15 and hT1R2/hT1R3 (Li et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 99, 4692-4696, 2002) (see also, International Publication No. WO 03/001876) was used in biological assays in association with identifying compounds with sweet taste enhancing properties. Compounds were initially selected based on their activity on the hT1R2/hT1R3-HEK293-Gα15 cell line Li et al., supra. Activity was determined using an automated fluorometric imaging assay on a FLIPR instrument (Fluorometric Intensity Plate Reader, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, Calif.) (designated FLIPR assay). Cells from one clone (designated clone S-9) were seeded into 384-well plates (at approximately 50,000 cells per well) in a medium containing DMEM Low Glucose (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.), 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.), 100 Units/ml Penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml Streptomycin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) (Li et al., 2002) (see also, International Publication No. WO 03/001876). S-9 cells were grown for 24 hours at 37° C. S-9 cells were then loaded with the calcium dye Fluo-3AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, Oreg.), 4 μM in a phosphate buffered saline (D-PBS) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.), for 1 hour at room temperature. After replacement with 25 μl D-PBS, stimulation was performed in the FLIPR instrument and at room temperature by the addition of 25 μl D-PBS supplemented with compounds at concentrations corresponding to three times the desired final level (Stimulation 1). Cells were incubated with the compounds for 7.5 minutes and then another stimulation was performed in the FLIPR instrument by the addition of 25 μl of D-PBS supplemented with a sub-optimal concentration of sweeteners (producing about 5% to 20% receptor activity) (Stimulation 2). Alternatively after replacement with 25 μl D-PBS per well, stimulation was performed in the FLIPR instrument at room temperature by addition of 25 μl D-PBS supplemented with different stimuli. Typical sweeteners used include, but are not limited to D-Glucose, D-Fructose, Sucralose, Aspartame and Sucrose. Receptor activity was then quantified by determining the maximal fluorescence increases (using a 480 nm excitation and 535 nm emission) after normalization to basal fluorescence intensity measured before stimulation. Compounds producing an increase in sweetener-mediated receptor activity were chosen for further characterization and quantification of potential enhancement properties. In this follow assay, a fixed concentration of compounds was added in duplicates to 10 consecutive columns (20 wells total) during stimulation 1. Typical compound concentrations tested were 300 μM, 100 μM, 50 μM, 30 μM, 10 μM, 3 μM and 1 μM, 0.3 μM, 0.1 μM, or 0.03 μM. After the 7.5 minute incubation period, increasing concentrations of sweetener (to generate a dose-response curve) was presented in the same wells, in duplicates, during stimulation 2. The relative efficacy of compounds at enhancing the receptor was determined by the calculating the magnitude of a shift in the EC50 for the sweetener. Enhancement was defined as a ratio (EC50R) corresponding to the EC50 of sweeteners, determined in the absence of the test compound, divided by the EC50 of the sweetener, determined in the presence of the test compound. In some embodiments, compounds have an EC50R between about 1 (e.g., >1) and about 1000. In other embodiments, compounds have an EC50R between about 1.25 and about 500. In still other embodiments, compounds have an EC50R between about 1.50 and about 100. In yet other embodiments, compounds have an EC50R between about 1 (e.g., >1) and about 50. In still other embodiment, compounds at about 50 μM have an EC50R between about 1 (e.g., >1) and about 1000, between about 1.25 and about 500, between about 1.50 and about 100, or between about 1 (e.g., >1) and about 50. Assay results for compounds are illustrated in Table A below. In one illustrative example, the pre-incubated sucralose EC50R at 50 μM for one group of specific compounds of the present invention generally ranges from 0.73 to 5.20, while the co-stimulation sucralose EC50R at 50 μM for the same group of compounds generally ranges from 0.72 to 4.46.

In another illustrative example, the co-stimulated sucrose EC50R at 50 μM for one group of specific compounds of the present invention generally ranges from 1.27 to 116.56, the co-stimulation sucralose EC50R at 50 μM for the same group of compounds generally ranges from 1.48 to 157.63, and the co-stimulation fructose EC50R at 50 μM for the same group of compounds generally ranges from 0.68 to 9.56. In another illustrative example, the co-stimulated sucrose EC50R at 50 μM for one group of specific compounds of the present invention generally ranges from 0.88 to 36.66, the co-stimulation sucralose EC50R at 50 μM for the same group of compounds generally ranges from 1.07 to 101.15, and the co-stimulation fructose EC50R at 50 μM for the same group of compounds generally ranges from 0.71 to 7.09. In another illustrative example, the co-stimulated sucrose EC50R at 50 μM for one group of specific compounds of the present invention generally ranges from 1.39 to 17.17, the co-stimulation sucralose EC50R at 50 μM for the same group of compounds generally ranges from 3.80 to 49.89, and the co-stimulation fructose EC50R at 50 μM for the same group of compounds generally ranges from 0.92 to 6.07. In another illustrative example, the co-stimulated sucrose EC50R at 50 μM for one group of specific compounds of the present invention generally ranges from 1.30 to 56.27, the co-stimulation sucralose EC50R at 50 μM for the same group of compounds generally ranges from 1.26 to 204.98, and the co-stimulation fructose EC50R at 50 μM for the same group of compounds generally ranges from 1.14 to 8.37. Experiment 5 Sweet Flavor and Sweet Flavor Enhancement Measurement Using Human Panelists Conducting a Scaling Test Test samples containing experimental compounds were compared to a dose-response curve for perceived sweetness intensity of sweeteners (such as, for example, sucralose, sucrose, fructose and other sweeteners) concentrations to determine equivalent sweetness intensity. A group of eight or more panelists tasted solutions including sweeteners at various concentrations, as well as the experimental compound both with and without added sweetener. Panelists then rated sweetness intensity of all samples on a structured horizontal line scale, anchored from 0 to 15, where 0 equals no sweetness and 15 equals equivalent sweetness to a 15% sucrose sample. Scores for sweetness intensity were averaged across panelists. Then using the average scores and/or equation of the line for the sweetener dose-response curve, equivalent sweetness concentrations were determined for the samples containing experimental compounds. Subjects had been previously familiarized with the key attribute taste and were trained to use the 0 to 15 point line scale. Subjects refrained from eating or drinking (except water) for at least 1 hour prior to the test. Subjects ate a cracker and rinsed with water several times to clean the mouth. Sweetener solutions are provided at a wide range of concentrations such as 100 ppm, 200 ppm, 300 ppm, 400 ppm, and 500 ppm for sucralose, or between 0% and 12% for sucrose or fructose, in order to create a dose-response curve. Samples containing experimental compound were prepared both alone and in a 100 ppm sucralose solution or a 6% sucrose or fructose solution. All samples were made up in low sodium buffer pH 7.1. In order to aid dispersion, solutions can be made up in 0.1% ethanol. The solutions were dispensed in 20 ml volumes into 1 oz. sample cups and served to the subjects at room temperature. All samples were presented in randomized counterbalanced order to reduce response bias. Further, two sessions of testing may be used to check panel precision. Subjects tasted each sample individually and rate sweetness intensity on the line scale prior to tasting the next sample. All samples were expectorated. Subjects may retaste the samples but can only use the volume of sample given. Subjects must rinse with water between samples. Eating an unsalted cracker between samples may be required depending on the samples tasted. The scores for each sample were averaged across subjects and standard error was calculated. The dose-response curve was plotted graphically, and this may be used to ensure the panel is rating accurately; i.e., increasing the concentration of sucralose should correspond to increased average scores for sweetness. A 2-way ANOVA (factors being samples and panelists) and multiple comparison tests (such as Tukey's Honestly Significant Difference test) can be used to determine differences among samples and/or panelists. A 3-way ANOVA, with sessions as the third factor, can be used to determine if there is any difference in the ratings between sessions. The compounds tested in this Experiment, namely, compounds C1 to C21, are representative compounds of the present invention including compounds of structural Formula (I) and its subgeneric formulas. The results of human taste tests with a compound C1 are found below. Table 1 indicates that 100 μM compound C1 in 100 ppm sucralose has sweetness equivalent to 200 ppm sucralose. Table 2 indicates that 100 μM compound C1 alone has no sweetness, and therefore can be defined as a true sweet enhancer. TABLE 1 Average sweetness scores for various sucralose samples, including 100 ppm sucralose with 100 μM compound C1, n = 32 (16 Panelists × 2 replicates). Tukey's value = 1.409 (α = 0.05).

Table 3 indicates that 100 μM compound in 100 ppm sucralose has sweetness equivalent to about 600 ppm sucralose. Table 4 shows a dose response curve of compound C2 with 100 ppm sucralose which shows that the sweetness of sucralose is significantly enhanced by addition of increasing amounts of compound C2.

A group of 10-16 or more panelists participated in each test. Subjects refrained from eating or drinking (except water) for at least 1 hour prior to the test. Subjects rinsed with water several times to clean the mouth. All samples are prepared with ethanol to ensure dispersion of the compound in solution. This includes samples without compound; all solutions are balanced for 0.1% ethanol. Samples are also prepared with low sodium buffer (pH 7.1) in place of water. Buffer contains 0.952 g of KCl, 5.444 g of Na2HPO4, and 0.952 g of KH2PO4 in 40 L of DIUF water. Sample volumes are usually 20 ml. In one paired comparison test, the panelist is presented with two different samples and asked to identify the sample which is sweeter. The samples within a paired comparison test are presented in a randomized, counterbalanced order. Panelists have up to a 1 minute delay between taste tests to clear the mouth of any tastes. Binomial probability tables are used to determine the probability of the correct number of responses occurring for each test at alpha=0.05.
