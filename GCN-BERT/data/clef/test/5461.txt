Reference Example C-1: Synthesis of [6-[4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]pyrimidin-4-yl]methylamine (C-1)
(step 1) Synthesis of 4-methyl-6-[4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]pyrimidine
To 4-chloro-6-methylpyrimidine (4.78 g, 37.4 mmol), 4-trifluoromethylphenylboronic acid (8.47 g, 44.6 mmol) and tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) (1.40 g, 1.21 mmol) was added acetonitrile (50 mL). To the reaction mixture was added a solution of sodium carbonate (12.9 g, 121 mmol) in water (9 mL), and the mixture was heated under reflux under an argon atmosphere for 3 hr and added to water. Further, the mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate, and the organic layer was washed with saturated brine and dried over sodium sulfate. The desiccant was filtered off, the solvent was evaporated and the obtained residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (petroleum ether/ethyl acetate) to give the title compound (6.13 g, 25.8 mmol, 69%).
