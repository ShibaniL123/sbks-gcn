Step 2: Preparation of tert-butyl(1-(6-fluoro-3-(pyridine-2-yl)quinoline-2-yl)ethyl)carbamate
254 mg (0.916 mmol) of tert-butyl (S)-(3-oxo-4-(pyridine-2-yl)butane-2-yl)carbamate prepared in step 1, 134 mg (0.961mmol) of 2-amino-5-fluorobenzaldehyde, and 398 mg (2.883 mmol) of potassiumcarbonate (K2CO3) were dissolved in ethanol (3 mL), followed by stirring at 90Â° C. for 2 hours. The reaction mixture was added with ethyl acetate and water, followed by extraction. The extracted organic layer was dried (Na2SO4), filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was separated by column chromatography (SiO2, eluent: hexane/ethyl acetate, 5/1) to give 250 mg of the target compound tert-butyl(1-(6-fluoro-3-(pyridine-2-yl)quinoline-2-yl)ethyl)carbamate as a yellow solid (0.680 mmol, yield: 71%).
