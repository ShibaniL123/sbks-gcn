STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT Not Applicable. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Technical Field The present disclosure relates generally to the production of biofuels. More specifically, the disclosure relates to a high shear process for culturing algae. 2. Background of the Invention Petroleum reserve depletion, economic, and environmental pressures have influenced and reduced the production and refining of petroleum derived liquid fuels. As a result, increasing interest and investment into renewable sources of liquid hydrocarbons has accelerated. However, dependency on crop-derived biofuels is limited by growing season, harvesting, and limited crop viability. Further, the reliance on food-crops for biofuels represents a supply-side strain on worldwide foodstuffs, from grains to livestock, food-crop implementation faces increased hurdles to economic, long-term, viability as a source for liquid fuel replacement. Algae do not face the same hurdles to viability for biofuels applications as crops, as they may be cultured and harvested year-round on relatively small land areas. Further, many algae have been discovered to produce significant quantities of upgradeable hydrocarbons, such as lipids. However, as water-living, carbon-fixing organisms, the development and storage of these hydrocarbons is limited by the diffusion of carbonaceous gases, such as carbon dioxide, through water. Alternate growth media, gas bubblers, and fluid beds implemented currently have not resulted in increased hydrocarbon production, as the diffusion of gases through the algae media limits carbon available for fixation, growth, and storage. During harvesting, the quantity of hydrocarbons available for refining does not reach the theoretical yield calculated for a given algae density. As the harvesting, lysing, and separation steps in conventional processes are slow, on the scale of seconds and minutes, the hydrocarbon/lipids exposed to free radicals, digestive enzymes, and other intracellular biological compounds rapidly degrade. Biological degradation represents an additional hurdle to efficient conversion of algal biomass to upgradeable hydrocarbons. As such, industrial scale algal bio fuels represent an equally inefficient resource.

FIG. 3 is a process flow diagram according to an alternate embodiment of the present disclosure for high shear algae processing. DETAILED DESCRIPTION Overview: The present disclosure provides a system and method for algae production, harvesting, and processing with at least one high shear device. Algae are a diverse group of photosynthetic organisms that typically grow in bodies of water as unicellular or multicellular forms. As aquatic or marine organisms, algae acquire the carbon dioxide necessary for photosynthesis by Brownian motion and diffusion. Further, certain species of algae fix carbon derived from carbon dioxide to produce and store fatty oils, carbohydrates, proteins, polysaccharides, and other compounds, hereinafter hydrocarbons. The acquisition of carbon dioxide, hereinafter CO2, from water represents a limiting step in growth rate and storage of these compounds. As certain algae are potentially useable in liquid fuel production, the uptake and fixation of carbon is a limiting step in preparing alga-derived biofuels. Further, after growth in the culture, the algae are harvested, lysed, and the desired hydrocarbons are separated from other biological molecules. The process of lysing the algae exposes the hydrocarbons to intracellular compounds, enzymes, and free radicals that degrade the hydrocarbon chains. These intracellular compounds reduce the hydrocarbon yields. Conventionally, buffers and chelators for these intracellular compounds are limited in their protection of the hydrocarbons by the rates of diffusion and Brownian motion. The limits of buffers for chelating these compounds represent a product limitation for the harvesting of algae and isolation of hydrocarbons for processing into liquid fuels. A system and method employ a high shear mechanical device to provide rapid contact and mixing of chemical ingredients in a controlled environment in the reactor/mixer device. The high shear device reduces the mass transfer limitations on the reaction and thus increases the overall reaction rate. Chemical reactions and mixtures involving liquids, gases, and solids rely on the laws of kinetics that involve time, temperature, and pressure to define the rate of reactions. Where it is desirable to react two or more raw materials of different phases (e.g. solid and liquid; liquid and gas; solid, liquid and gas), one of the limiting factors controlling the rate of reaction is the contact time of the reactants. In the case of heterogeneously catalyzed reactions, there may be an additional rate limiting factor, namely, removing the reaction products from the surface of the catalyst to enable the catalyst to catalyze further reactants. In conventional processes, contact time for the reactants and/or catalyst may is altered by mixing which provides contact between two or more reactants involved in a chemical reaction. A reactor assembly that comprises a high shear device makes possible decreased mass transfer limitations and thereby allows the reaction to more closely approach kinetic limitations. When reaction rates are accelerated, residence times may be decreased, thereby increasing obtainable throughput and production. Alternatively, where the current yield is acceptable, decreasing the required residence time allows for the use of smaller amounts of reactant, thus improving the process economics. High Shear Device: High shear devices (HSD) such as high shear mixers and high shear mills, are generally divided into classes based upon their ability to mix fluids. Mixing is the process of reducing the size of inhomogeneous species or particles within the fluid. One metric for the degree or thoroughness of mixing is the energy density per unit volume that the mixing device generates to disrupt the fluid. The classes are distinguished based on delivered energy density. There are three classes of industrial mixers having sufficient energy density to consistently produce mixtures or emulsions with particle or bubble sizes in the range of 0 to 50 μm. Homogenization valve systems are typically classified as high-energy devices. Fluid to be processed is pumped under very high pressure through a narrow-gap valve into a lower pressure environment. The pressure gradients across the valve and the resulting turbulence and cavitations act to break-up any particles in the fluid. These valve systems are most commonly used in milk homogenization and may yield average particle size range from about 0.01 μm to about 1 μm. At the other end of the spectrum are high shear mixer systems classified as low energy devices. These systems usually have paddles or fluid rotors that turn at high speed in a reservoir of fluid to be processed, which in many of the more common applications is a food product. These systems are usually used when average particle, globule, or bubble, sizes of greater than 20 microns are acceptable in the processed fluid. Between low energy-high shear mixers and homogenization valve systems, in terms of the mixing energy density delivered to the fluid, are colloid mills, which are classified as intermediate energy devices. The typical colloid mill configuration includes a conical or disk rotor that is separated from a complementary, liquid-cooled stator by a closely-controlled rotor-stator gap, which may be in the range of from about 0.025 mm to 10.0 mm. Rotors may preferably be driven by an electric motor through a direct drive or belt mechanism. Many colloid mills, with proper adjustment, may achieve average particle, or bubble, sizes of about 0.01 μm to about 25 μm in the processed fluid. These capabilities render colloid mills appropriate for a variety of applications including colloid and oil/water-based emulsion processing such as preparation of cosmetics, mayonnaise, silicone/silver amalgam, and roofing-tar mixtures. Referring now to FIG. 1, there is presented a schematic diagram of a high shear device 200. High shear device 200 comprises at least one rotor-stator combination. The rotor-stator combinations may also be known as generators 220, 230, 240 or stages without limitation. The high shear device 200 comprises at least two generators, and most preferably, the high shear device comprises at least three generators. The first generator 220 comprises rotor 222 and stator 227. The second generator 230 comprises rotor 223, and stator 228; the third generator comprises rotor 224 and stator 229. For each generator 220, 230, 240 the rotor is rotatably driven by input 250. The generators 220, 230, 240 are configured t0 rotate about axis 260, in rotational direction 265. Stator 227 is fixably coupled to the high shear device wall 255. The generators include gaps between the rotor and the stator. The first generator 220 comprises a first gap 225; the second generator 230 comprises a second gap 235; and the third generator 240 comprises a third gap 245. The gaps 225, 235, 245 are between about 0.025 mm (0.01 in) and 10.0 mm (0.4 in) wide. Alternatively, the process comprises utilization of a high shear device 200 wherein the gaps 225, 235, 245 are between about 0.5 mm (0.02 in) and about 2.5 mm (0.1 in). In certain instances, the gap is maintained at about 1.5 mm (0.06 in). Alternatively, the gaps 225, 235, 245 are different between generators 220, 230, 240. In certain instances, the gap 225 for the first generator 220 is greater than about the gap 235 for the second generator 230, which is greater than about the gap 245 for the third generator 240. Additionally, the width of the gaps 225, 235, 245 may comprise a coarse, medium, fine, and super-fine characterization. Rotors 222, 223, and 224 and stators 227, 228, and 229 may be toothed designs. Each generator may comprise two or more sets of rotor-stator teeth, as known in the art. Rotors 222, 223, and 224 may comprise a number of rotor teeth circumferentially spaced about the circumference of each rotor. In further designs, the rotors 222, 223, and 224 may comprise multiple concentric rows of rotor teeth. Stators 227, 228, and 229 may comprise a number of stator teeth circumferentially spaced about the circumference of each stator. In further designs, the stators 227, 228, and 229 may comprise multiple concentric rows of stator teeth. In embodiments, the inner diameter of the rotor is about 11.8 cm. In embodiments, the outer diameter of the stator is about 15.4 cm. In further embodiments, the rotor and stator may have an outer diameter of about 60 mm for the rotor, and about 64 mm for the stator. Alternatively, the rotor and stator may have alternate diameters in order to alter the tip speed and shear pressures. In certain embodiments, each of three stages is operated with a super-fine generator, comprising a gap of between about 0.025 mm and about 3 mm. When a feed stream 205 including solid particles is to be sent through high shear device 200, the appropriate gap width is first selected for an appropriate reduction in particle size and increase in particle surface area. In embodiments, this is beneficial for increasing catalyst surface area by shearing and dispersing the particles. High shear device 200 is fed a reaction mixture comprising the feed stream 205. Feed stream 205 comprises an emulsion of the dispersible phase and the continuous phase. Emulsion refers to a liquefied mixture that contains two distinguishable substances (or phases) that will not readily mix and dissolve together. Most emulsions have a continuous phase (or matrix), which holds therein discontinuous droplets, bubbles, and/or particles of the other phase or substance. Emulsions may be highly viscous, such as slurries or pastes, or may be foams, with tiny gas bubbles suspended in a liquid. As used herein, the term “emulsion” encompasses continuous phases comprising gas bubbles, continuous phases comprising particles (e.g., solid catalyst), continuous phases comprising droplets, or globules, of a fluid that is insoluble in the continuous phase, and combinations thereof. Feed stream 205 may include a particulate solid catalyst component. Feed stream 205 is pumped through the generators 220, 230, 240, such that product dispersion 210 is formed. In each generator, the rotors 222, 223, 224 rotate at high speed relative to the fixed stators 227, 228, 229. The rotation of the rotors pumps fluid, such as the feed stream 205, between the outer surface of the rotor 222 and the inner surface of the stator 227 creating a localized high shear condition. The gaps 225, 235, 245 generate high shear forces that process the feed stream 205. The high shear forces between the rotor and stator functions to process the feed stream 205 to create the product dispersion 210. Each generator 220, 230, 240 of the high shear device 200 has interchangeable rotor-stator combinations for producing a narrow distribution of the desired bubble size, if feedstream 205 comprises a gas, or globule size, if feedstream 205 comprises a liquid, in the product dispersion 210. The product dispersion 210 of gas particles, globules, or bubbles, in a liquid comprises an emulsion. In embodiments, the product dispersion 210 may comprise a dispersion of a previously immiscible or insoluble gas, liquid or solid into the continuous phase. The product dispersion 210 has an average gas particle, globule or bubble, size less than about 1.5 μm; preferably the globules are sub-micron in diameter. In certain instances, the average globule size is in the range from about 0.1 μm to about 1.0 μm. Alternatively, the average globule size is less than about 400 nm (0.4 μm) and most preferably less than about 100 nm (0.1 μm). Tip speed is the velocity (m/sec) associated with the end of one or more revolving elements that is transmitting energy to the reactants. Tip speed, for a rotating element, is the circumferential distance traveled by the tip of the rotor per unit of time, and is generally defined by the equation V (m/sec)=π·D·n, where V is the tip speed, D is the diameter of the rotor, in meters, and n is the rotational speed of the rotor, in revolutions per second. Tip speed is thus a function of the rotor diameter and the rotation rate. For colloid mills, typical tip speeds are in excess of 23 m/sec (4500 ft/min) and may exceed 40 m/sec (7900 ft/min). For the purpose of the present disclosure the term ‘high shear’ refers to mechanical rotor-stator devices, such as mills or mixers, that are capable of tip speeds in excess of 5 m/sec (1000 ft/min) and require an external mechanically driven power device to drive energy into the stream of products to be reacted. A high shear device combines high tip speeds with a very small shear gap to produce significant friction on the material being processed. Accordingly, a local pressure in the range of about 1000 MPa (about 145,000 psi) to about 1050 MPa (152,300 psi) and elevated temperatures at the tip of the shear mixer are produced during operation. In certain embodiments, the local pressure is at least about 1034 MPa (about 150,000 psi). The local pressure further depends on the tip speed, fluid viscosity, and the rotor-stator gap during operation. An approximation of energy input into the fluid (kW/l/min) may be made by measuring the motor energy (kW) and fluid output (1/min) In embodiments, the energy expenditure of a high shear device is greater than 1000 W/m3. In embodiments, the energy expenditure is in the range of from about 3000 W/m3 to about 7500 W/m3. The high shear device 200 combines high tip speeds with a very small shear gap to produce significant shear on the material. The amount of shear is typically dependent on the viscosity of the fluid. The shear rate generated in a high shear device 200 may be greater than 20,000 s−1. In embodiments, the shear rate generated is in the range of from 20,000 s−1 to 100,000 s−1. The high shear device 200 produces a gas emulsion capable of remaining dispersed at atmospheric pressure for at least about 15 minutes. For the purpose of this disclosure, an emulsion of gas particles, globules or bubbles, in the dispersed phase in product dispersion 210 that are less than 1.5 μm in diameter may comprise a micro-foam. Not to be limited by a specific theory, it is known in emulsion chemistry that sub-micron particles, globules, or bubbles, dispersed in a liquid undergo movement primarily through Brownian motion effects. The globules in the emulsion of product dispersion 210 created by the high shear device 200 may have greater mobility through boundary layers of solid catalyst particles, thereby facilitating and accelerating the catalytic reaction through enhanced transport of reactants. The rotor is set to rotate at a speed commensurate with the diameter of the rotor and the desired tip speed as described hereinabove. Transport resistance is reduced by incorporation of high shear device 200 such that the velocity of the reaction is increased by at least about 5%. Alternatively, the high shear device 200 comprises a high shear colloid mill that serves as an accelerated rate reactor. The accelerated rate reactor comprises a single stage, dispersing chamber. The accelerated rate reactor comprises a multiple stage inline disperser comprising at least 2 stages. Selection of the high shear device 200 is dependent on throughput requirements and desired particle or bubble size in the outlet dispersion 210. In certain instances, high shear device 200 comprises a DISPAX REACTOR® of IKA® Works, Inc. Wilmington, N.C. and APV North America, Inc. Wilmington, Mass. Model DR 2000/4, for example, comprises a belt drive, 4M generator, PTFE sealing ring, inlet flange 1″ sanitary clamp, outlet flange ¾″ sanitary clamp, 2 HP power, output speed of 7900 rpm, flow capacity (water) approximately 300 l/h to approximately 700 l/h (depending on generator), a tip speed of from 9.4 m/s to about 41 m/s (about 1850 ft/min to about 8070 ft/min). Several alternative models are available having various inlet/outlet connections, horsepower, tip speeds, output rpm, and flow rate. Without limitation by theory, a toothed rotor and stator combination provides increased reactant exposure to multiple shear gaps when compared to other shear devices described herein. Additionally, the reactants are subjected to increasing shear as the reactants move radially outward between each rotor and stator combination. The difference in rotational rate accounts for an increasing shear as the reactants are exposed to teeth or rows of teeth found in each rotor/stator combination. Without wishing to be limited to a particular theory, it is believed that the level or degree of high shear mixing is sufficient to increase rates of mass transfer and may produce localized non-ideal conditions that enable reactions to occur that would not otherwise be expected to occur based on Gibbs free energy predictions. Localized non-ideal conditions are believed to occur within the high shear device resulting in increased temperatures and pressures with the most significant increase believed to be in localized pressures. The increase in pressures and temperatures within the high shear device are instantaneous and localized and quickly revert to bulk or average system conditions once exiting the high shear device. In some cases, the high shear-mixing device induces cavitation of sufficient intensity to dissociate one or more of the reactants into free radicals, which may intensify a chemical reaction or allow a reaction to take place at less stringent conditions than might otherwise be required. Cavitation may also increase rates of transport processes by producing local turbulence and liquid microcirculation (acoustic streaming). An overview of the application of cavitation phenomenon in chemical/physical processing applications is provided by Gogate et al., “Cavitation: A technology on the horizon,” Current Science 91 (No. 1): 35-46 (2006). The high shear-mixing device of certain embodiments of the present system and methods is operated under what are believed to be cavitation conditions effective to dissociate the carbon dioxide into a nanofoam for the optimization of algal growth. In certain instances, the conditions are effective for mechanically disintegrating the algae for extracting hydrocarbons. Further, the conditions may be effective for mechanically homogenizing the hydrocarbon chains to produce liquid hydrocarbon products. Process and System for Algae Growth and Processing: Referring to FIG. 2, that illustrates an algae processing system (APS) 100. APS 100 comprises high shear device (HSD) 30, bioreactor 35, lysis reactor 50 and hydrocarbon reactor 60. APS 100 is configured to optimize the growth and harvesting of algae. APS 100 is configured for introducing a media stream, comprising nutrients, and gases to HSD 30 prior to inoculation with a selected algal species and introduction to a bioreactor 35. Further, APS 100 is configured to isolate lipids, oils, and polysaccharides, herein hydrocarbons, from algae. APS 100 is configurable to comprise a plurality of HSD 30 or similar devices. In certain applications, APS 100 may be configured for the homogenization of the hydrocarbons. Algae are grown or cultured in a broth or substrate, such as media stream 12. In certain instances, the media stream 12 comprises sugars, proteins, amino acids, and other biomacromolecules suitable to replicate and/or simulate the growth environment of the algae. The presence of these biomolecules in media stream 12 comprises additional molecules for the algal life cycle. Further, media stream 12 comprises salinity similar to the natural environment of the algae. For instance, media stream 12 comprises a salinity to replicate an aquatic, a marine, or a brackish environment. Generally, water, preferably distilled water, is used to culture the algae. The water is sterile and free from all contaminants. Any appropriate culture mediums known to those of skill in the art may be used as media stream 12 depending on the specific algae species selected for culturing in APS 100. In certain instances, media stream 12 is supplemented to improve growth of algae. Media stream 12 comprises a pH enhancer stream 14, an electrolyte stream 16, and a nutrient stream 18. In instances, pH enhancer stream 14, electrolyte stream 16, and nutrient stream 18 comprise media stream 12. Alternatively, pH enhancer stream 14, electrolyte stream 16, and nutrient stream 18 are mixed with media stream 12 to alter, and/or regulate the composition of media stream 12. Further, pH enhancer stream 14, electrolyte stream 16, and nutrient stream 18 are introduced to media stream 12 as a make up stream for replacing the media and nutrients consumed by the algal culture. A pH enhancer stream 14 is mixed with media stream 12. A pH enhancer stream 14 comprises any chemical understood by one skilled in the art to alter pH. Alternatively, a pH enhancer stream comprises any chemical understood by one skilled in the art to resist pH changes, for instance a buffer. The pH enhancer stream 14 comprises a salt, a buffer, an anion, or a cation without limitation. In instances, pH enhancer stream 14 is introduced directly to media stream 12; alternatively, pH enhancer stream 14 is introduced to APS 100 in any point in the process. Media stream 12 is supplemented by an electrolyte stream 16. Without limitation by theory, an electrolyte comprises any chemical having free ions. Alternatively, an electrolyte comprises an electrically conductive medium, such as an ionic solution. In certain instances, electrolyte stream 16 comprises magnesium, calcium, sodium, potassium, chloride, phosphate, or carbonate ions, without limitation. Electrolyte stream 16 comprises compounds conducive for the synthesis of chlorophyll; alternatively, for the synthesis of algal hydrocarbons. Media stream 12 is supplemented with a nutrient stream 18. In certain instances, nutrient stream 18 introduces nutrients, such as but not limited to sugars, lipids, and biomacromolecules. Alternatively, nutrient stream 18 comprises a make-up stream, configured to reintroduce nutrients to media stream 12. Nutrient stream 18 may further comprise antibiotics or antifungal compounds for controlling contaminants in media stream 12. Media stream 12 is directed to pump 15. Pump 15 is used to provide a controlled flow to HSD 30 and APS 100. Pump 15 increases the pressure of the media stream 12 to greater than about 203 kPa (2 atm). Alternatively, pump 15 may pressurize media stream 12 to a pressure of greater than about 2030 kPa (20 atm). The increased pressure of media stream 12 can be used to accelerate reactions and diffusion of molecules. In further instances, the increased pressure of media stream 12 ensures sterility of the media stream. Without limitation by theory, sterilizing media stream 12 eliminates competitors for nutrients in media stream 12. The limiting factor for pressure in APS 100 may be the pressure limitations of pump 15 and HSD 30. Preferably, all contact parts of pump 15 comprise stainless steel or other bacteria and fungus resistant materials. Pump 15 may be any suitable pump, for example, a Roper Type 1 gear pump, Roper Pump Company (Commerce Ga.) or a Dayton Pressure Booster Pump Model 2P372E, Dayton Electric Co. (Niles, Ill.). Pump 15 is fluid communication with HSD 30. Gas stream 20 is injected, bubbled, diffused, or introduced into media stream 12. Gas stream 20 is directed to HSD 30. Gas stream 20 comprises air. Gas stream 20 comprises a carbon-containing gas or gas stream. Gas stream 20 further comprises carbon dioxide (CO2) stream 22 and nitrogen stream 24. CO2 stream 22 comprises gaseous CO2, for example pressurized CO2. Further, CO2 stream 22 comprises air, for example air from a CO2 rich environment such as a parking garage, an airport, a building, or air brought in from a city or urban environment. Without limitation by theory, the implementation of air from a CO2 rich environment comprises sequestering the CO2, recycling the CO2, or reducing the CO2 contribution to atmospheric pollutants. Nitrogen stream 24 comprises nitrogen-containing gases, for example gaseous nitrogen (N2) and other nitrogen compounds. Nitrogen stream 24 comprises nitrogen (N2), oxides of nitrogen, ammonia, nitrates, and other nitrogen containing compounds, without limitation. CO2 stream 22 and nitrogen stream 24 are introduced to gas stream 20 in a controlled ratio. The ratio of CO2 stream 22 to nitrogen stream 24 is regulated to maximize algal growth. Media stream 12 and gas stream 20 are introduced to HSD 30. Media stream 12 and gas stream 20 are injected into HSD 30 via pump 15. In certain instances, pump 15 injects media stream 12, and gas stream 20 is introduced separately. Media stream 12 and gas stream 20 are introduced to HSD 30 for processing. As discussed in detail above, HSD 30 is a mechanical device that utilizes, for example, a rotor/stator mixing head with a fixed gap between the rotor and the stator. In HSD 30, gas stream 20 and media stream 12 are mixed to form an emulsion comprising microbubbles and nanobubbles of nitrogen and CO2 containing gas from gas stream 20. The resultant dispersion comprises an average bubble size less than about 1.5 μm; alternatively, the mean bubble size is less than from about 0.1 μm to about 1.5 μm. The resultant dispersion comprises bubbles with a submicron mean bubble diameter. The mean bubble size is less than about 400 nm; more preferably, less than about 100 nm. The high shear mixing produces gas bubbles capable of remaining dispersed at atmospheric pressure for about 15 minutes or longer depending on the bubble size. The emulsion may further comprise a micro-foam or a nanofoam. In certain configurations, APS 100 comprises a plurality of HSD 30 operated in series. Not to be limited by a specific method, it is known in emulsion chemistry that submicron particles dispersed in a liquid undergo movement primarily through Brownian motion effects. Thus, submicron gas particles created by the HSD 30 have greater mobility through boundary layers of suspended solids in media stream 12 thereby facilitating and accelerating algal uptake, growth, and APS 100 efficiency. HSD 30 produces an emulsion stream 32. Emulsion stream 32 is directed to bioreactor 35. Bioreactor 35 comprises an open pond, a translucent tank, translucent tube, deep tank, lighted tank, flowing reactor, or other arrangement without limitation. Bioreactor 35 comprises any bioreactor having a means known to one skilled in the art to grow algae. Bioreactor 35 comprises a plurality of monitors and automated circuits to maintain preferred conditions. Bioreactor 35 comprises a heater or other thermal elements configured to heat or warm the contents and maintain a preferred temperature. Bioreactor 35 comprises light conduits, for instance fiber-optic cables to transmit light into the maximal volume of the bioreactor. Bioreactor 35 comprises an agitating means, such as a stirrer, to expose algae to additional light irradiation. Without limitation by theory, algal growth rates are effected by exposure to light, and a mechanical agitating means is configured to expose the algae to light or light source irradiation. In certain instance bioreactor 35 comprises a light source 34 configured for delivering light to the bioreactor 30. Further, light source 34 comprises the sun. Light source 34 is configured to supplement solar light spectrum in certain ranges. Light source 34 comprises an artificial natural light, i.e. a light that transmits in a similar spectrum and intensity as solar light. Alternatively, light source 34 comprises a light configured to irradiate the bioreactor with a preferred spectrum of light. Light source 34 is configured to heat or warm bioreactor 35 to a temperature favorable for algal growth. Algae stream 33 is introduced to bioreactor 35. Algae stream 33 comprises an inoculation stream. Algae stream 33 comprises algae in an inoculation media. Algae stream 33 may comprise an inoculation tank, for growing a volume of algae for inoculating bioreactor 35. Algae stream 33 comprises a concentrated stream or slurry of algae for inoculating emulsion stream 32. Algae stream 33 comprises a stream or slurry of algae for growth in bioreactor 35. In certain instances, bioreactor 35 is prefilled with emulsion stream 32; alternatively, algae stream 33 and emulsion stream 32 are introduced into bioreactor 35 simultaneously. Algae stream 33 and emulsion stream 32 are allowed to circulate through bioreactor 35. Without limitation by theory, algae in bioreactor 35 grow, divide and multiply by consumption of biomolecules in media stream 12 and gas stream 20. The consumed portions of media stream 12 and gas stream 20 are reintroduced to bioreactor 35 by emulsion stream 32. In certain instances, the reintroduction of biomolecules comprises make-up streams. The make-up streams follow the original process stream described herein. Further, the make-up stream may comprise an alternative composition as preferred to maintain conditions in bioreactor 35. Bioreactor 35 comprises monitors for tracking the composition of emulsion stream 32 make-up streams and adjusting the composition of media stream 12 and gas stream 20. Bioreactor 35 is drained by algae outlet 37 to a filter 40. Bioreactor 35 may be continuously drained, such that a constant flow of algae is removed from bioreactor 35. Alternatively, bioreactor 35 is drained on a batch-process basis. Algae withdrawn by algae outlet 37 are separated from the media by filter 40.
