TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a nematic liquid crystal composition and a liquid crystal display element using it, that are useful as a liquid crystal display material, in which its dielectric constant anisotropic value (Δ∈) is positive. Liquid crystal display elements have been used in various devices such as measuring equipment, automotive panel, word processor, electronic note, printer, computer, TV, clock, advertisement panel board, and etc., including watch and electronic calculator. The representative of the liquid crystal display method includes TN (twisted nematic) type, STN (super twisted nematic) type, vertical orientation type using a TFT (thin film transistor), and IPS (in-plane switching) type. The liquid crystal composition used in the liquid crystal display element is demanded to be stable to the external stimulation such as water, air, heat, and light. It is also demanded to exhibit a liquid crystalline phase in a temperature range as wide as possible including the room temperature, as well as to have a low viscosity and to require lower drive voltage. Furthermore, the liquid crystal composition comprises several to dozens of components in order to make individual display element provided with the most appropriate values of dielectric constant anisotropy (Δ∈) and/or refractive index anisotropy (Δn). A vertical orientation (VA) type display uses a liquid crystal composition whose value of Δ∈ is negative, and a horizontal orientation model display such as TN type, STN type and IPS (in-plane switching) type uses a liquid crystal composition whose value of Δ∈ is positive. Also, there is a report of a drive type using a liquid crystal composition having a positive value of Δ∈, which is made a vertical orientation at no voltage application, but when applying horizontal electric field, it can display. Therefore, the need for liquid crystal composition having a positive value of Δ∈ has been further increased. On the other hand, lower voltage drive, higher response, and wider operating temperature are demanded in all drive types. Namely, it is demanded to have a positive value of Δ∈ with a higher absolute value, having a lower viscosity (η), and higher transition temperature (Tni) between nematic phase and isotropic liquid phase. Also, in order to regulate the product (Δn×d) of Δn and a cell gap (d) in a specified value, it is required to adjust the Δn value of the liquid crystal composition in a suitable range in accordance with the cell gap. In addition, when the liquid crystal display element is applied to a TV, high-speed response is weighed heavily, and therefore, the liquid crystal composition is required to have a small rotary viscosity (γ1). As a constitution of the liquid crystal composition to accomplish high-speed response, an example of such a liquid crystal composition was disclosed, that is a combination of a compound represented by the formula (A-1) or formula (A-2) that is a liquid crystal compound with a positive value of Δ∈, with a compound represented by the formula (B) that is a liquid crystal compound with a neutral value of Δ∈. Such a liquid crystal composition is characterized in that the liquid crystal compound with the positive Δ∈ has a —CF2O— structure, and that the liquid crystal compound with the neutral Δ∈ has an alkenyl group. These characteristics are widely known in the field of the liquid crystal composition (see Patent References Nos. 1-4). On the other hand, as the application of the liquid crystal display element has come to spread, a large change has been made in its use and manufacturing method. In order to cope with the change, it has been demanded to optimize the characteristics more than the basic physical properties as conventionally known. Namely, as the liquid crystal display element using the liquid crystal composition, a VA type and an IPS type have been widely used, and in addition, a display element having a super large size such as model 50 or more has become available and used. As upsizing the board size, the injection method of the liquid crystal composition into the board has been changed, too; that is, the conventional vacuum injection method has been replaced with an instillation method (ODF: One Drop Fill). However, a problem of deteriorated display quality has been noticed due to the drip trace caused when dropping the liquid crystal composition onto board. Furthermore, in the liquid crystal display element manufacture process using the ODF method, it is necessary to drop a liquid crystal at the most suitable quantity according to the size of the liquid crystal display element. As the dripping quantity becomes significantly different from the optimum quantity, the designed balance in the refractive index and the drive electric field of the liquid crystal display element can be collapsed, thereby causing indication defectiveness such as irregularity outbreak and contrast defectiveness. Particularly, in case of a small-sized liquid crystal display element widely used in smartphones being recently popular, the most suitable quantity of the liquid crystal to be dropped is so small that it is difficult to control the gap fallen within a certain range from the optimum quantity. Therefore, in order to maintain a high production yield of the liquid crystal display element, a liquid crystal composition is required e.g., to be little influenced by sudden change in pressure and impact caused inside the dripping device during the liquid crystal dripping, as well as to allow it to be continuously dropped for an extended period. In this way, in the liquid crystal composition used in the active matrix drive liquid crystal display element driven with TFT elements, the followings are demanded: to maintain a characteristic and performance for a liquid crystal display element such as high speed response performance; to provide with high resistivity level, high voltage retention, and stability to the outside stimulation such as light and heat; and to consider the manufacturing method of the liquid crystal display element.

Using the birefringence of the liquid crystal composition, it can be used into a liquid crystal display element which controls the light transmission volume. As the liquid crystal display element, it is useful for AM-LCD (active matrix liquid crystal display element), TN (nematic liquid crystal indicating element), STN-LCD (super twisted nematic liquid crystal indicating element), OCB-LCD and IPS-LCD (in-plane switching liquid crystal display element), but it is particularly useful for AM-LCD, and can be used in a liquid crystal display element in a type of transmission or reflection. Two substrates of liquid crystalline cell used for the liquid crystal display element can a flexible and transparent material such as glass or resin, and one of them can be an opaque material such as silicon. For example, a transparent substrate having a transparent electrode layer can be obtained by sputtering indium tin oxide (ITO) on a transparent substrate such as a glass plate. For example, the color filter can be made by the pigment dispersion method, printing method, electrodeposition method, or dyeing method. Here, the preparation method of a color filter by the pigment dispersion method is explained, for example. A curable coloration composition for color filter is applied on the transparence substrate, and then a patterning processing is applied, which is then cured by heating or light irradiation. Each process is performed for three colors of red, green, blue to form pixel parts for the color filter. In addition, on the said substrate, a pixel electrode having an active element such as TFT and thin-film diode can be provided. The substrates are opposed to each other such that the transparent electrode layers are located inside. At that time, the distance of the substrates can be regulated by a spacer therebetween. Here, it is preferable to adjust the color adjustment layer having a thickness of 1-100 μm. It is more preferably 1.5 to 10 μm. When a polarizing plate is used, it is preferable to adjust the product of the refractive index anisotropy Δn and the cell thickness d of the liquid crystal in order to maximize the contrast. In addition, in case of two polarizing plates, the polarization axis of each polarizing plate can be adjusted in order to make the view angle and contrast good. Furthermore, a phase difference film can be used in order to widen the view angle. For example, the spacer can include a columnar spacer of glass particle, resin particle, alumina particle, and photoresist material. Thereafter, the sealant such as epoxy type thermosetting composition is screen-printed on the substrate such that an injection hole for liquid crystal is provided, and the substrates are attached to each other, which are then heated to thermally cure the sealant. The liquid crystal composition including the polymerizable compound can be intervened between two substrates by means of normal vacuum injection method and ODF method. However, there is a problem in the vacuum injection method since a trace of the injection can be left while a drip trace does not occur. The present invention is more suitable for the display element which is manufactured by means of the ODF method. In the liquid crystal display element manufacturing process by means of the ODF method, either one substrate of the back plane or the front plane is applied with a sealant such as epoxy type light/heat curable agent to draw a closed-loop embankment form by using a dispenser, into which the liquid crystal composition is dropped at a specified amount under deairing, and then, the back plane and the front plane are joined to each other to produce a liquid crystal display element. The liquid crystal composition of the present invention can stably drop the liquid crystal composition during the ODF process, and is suitably useful. For the method to polymerize a polymerizable compound, appropriate polymerization rate is desirable to obtain good orientation performance of the liquid crystal, so that a method to polymerize it by irradiating active energy lines such as ultraviolet rays or electron beams alone or in combination thereof. When using ultraviolet rays, a polarization light source can be used, or an unpolarized light source can be used. When the liquid crystal composition including a polymerizable compound is polymerized in a state that it is placed between the two substrates, at least one of the substrates located at the side of the irradiation surface shall be suitably transparent to the active energy lines. Also, after having polymerized only a specific moiety by using a mask at the time of light irradiation, the condition such as electric field, magnetic field or temperature is changed such that the orientation state of the non-polymerized portion is changed, and then, polymerization is performed by further irradiating the active energy lines. In particular, when ultraviolet rays are exposed, the liquid crystal composition including a polymerizable compound is preferably applied with alternative electric field while exposed to ultraviolet rays. The alternative electric field to be applied is preferably alternative current with a frequency of 10 Hz to 10 kHz, and more preferably 60 Hz to 10 kHz. The voltage is selected depending on the desired pretilt angle of the liquid crystal display element. In other words, the pretilt angle of the liquid crystal display element can be controlled by the voltage to be applied. In the liquid crystal display element of the horizontal electric field type MVA mode, the pretilt angle can be preferably controlled at 80 degrees to 89.9 degrees in view of the orientation stability and contrast. The temperature at the time of the irradiation is preferably within the temperature range where the liquid crystalline state of the liquid crystal composition of the present invention can be maintained. It is preferable to typically polymerize at a temperature that is close to the room temperature, namely a temperature of 15-35° C. The lamp generating the ultraviolet rays to be used can include metal halide lamp, high pressure mercury lamp, and super-high pressure mercury lamp. Also, with respect to the wavelength of the ultraviolet rays to be irradiated, it is preferable to irradiate ultraviolet lights having a wavelength range that does not overlap with the absorption wavelength band of the liquid crystal composition. If necessary, the ultraviolet rays are trimmed to be used. The strength of the ultraviolet rays to be irradiated is preferably 0.1 mW/cm2 to 100 W/cm2, and more preferably 2 mW/cm2 to 50 W/cm2. The energy amount of the ultraviolet rays to be irradiated can be appropriately adjusted, and it is preferably 10 mJ/cm2 to 500 J/cm2, more preferably 100 mJ/cm2 to 200 J/cm2. When irradiating ultraviolet rays, the strength can be changed. The period to irradiate ultraviolet rays can be appropriately adjusted depending on the strength of the ultraviolet rays to be irradiated, and it is preferably 10 to 3,600 seconds, and more preferably 10 to 600 seconds. The liquid crystal display element using the liquid crystal composition of the present invention is useful in accomplishing both the high speed response and the restraint of the display defectiveness. It is particularly useful for the liquid crystal display elements for active matrix drive, and applicable to liquid crystal display elements for VA mode, PSVA mode, PSA mode, IPS (in-plane switching) mode, VA-IPS mode, FFS (fringe field switching) mode or ECB modes. Hereinafter, with reference to the drawing, the preferable embodiment of the liquid crystal display device of the present invention is explained in detail. FIG. 1 is a cross section of the liquid crystal display element comprising a seal material provided between two substrates opposed to each other, and a liquid crystal enclosed in the sealed region surrounded by seal material. In details, there is provided a backplane in which TFT layer 102 and pixel electrode 103 are provided on first substrate 100, onto which passivation film 104 and first oriented film 105 are provided. On the second substrate 200, black matrix 202, color filter 203, flattened film (overcoat layer) 201, transparent electrode 204 are provided, onto which second oriented film 205 is provided. The back plane is opposed to the front plane. Seal material 301 is provided between the substrates. Liquid crystal layer 303 is enclosed in the sealed region surrounded by the seal material. Projections (columnar spacer) 302,304 are provided on the substrate surface with which seal material 301. In this way, the details of the liquid crystal display element are provided. The first substrate or the second substrate is not particularly limited in its material, if it is substantially transparent. The example can include glass, ceramics, and resin. The resin substrate can include cellulose and cellulose derivative such as triacetylcellulose and diacetyl cellulose; polycycloolefin derivative, polyester such as polyethylene terephthalate and polyethylenenaphthalate; polyolefin such as polypropylene and polyethylene; polycarbonate, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl chloride, polyvinylidene chloride, polyamide, polyimide, polyimide amide, polystyrene, acrylics, polymethyl methacrylate, polyethersulfone, and polyarylate, and furthermore, inorganic-organic composite material such as fiberglass-epoxy resin, and fiberglass-acrylic resin. In addition, a barrier film is preferably provided when a resin substrate is used. The function of the barrier film is to reduce the moisture permeability of the resin substrate and to improve the reliability of the electrical characteristics of the liquid crystal display element. The barrier film is not particular limited so long as it has high transparency and small vapor-permeability. It is generally formed by vapor deposition, sputtering and chemical vapor deposition method (CVD method) using inorganic material such as silicon oxide. In the present invention, the first substrate and the second substrate can be made of either the same material or different material, and not particularly limited. If using a glass substrate, the liquid crystal display element can be provided with excellent heat resistance and dimensional stability, so it is preferable. Alternatively, if using a resin substrate, it is suitable for the manufacturing method by the roll-to-roll process as well as suitable for reducing the weight or making flexible. Also, if aiming for flatness and thermal stabilization, favorable results can be obtained by combining a glass substrate with a resin substrate. In addition, in the later Example, a substrate is used as material of the first substrate 100 or the second substrate 200. As the back-plane, TFT layer 102 and pixel electrode 103 are provided on the first substrate 100. These are prepared by normal array process. Thereon, passivation film 104 and first oriented film 105 are provided to obtain the back-plane. The passivation film 104 (it is also called as an inorganic protection film) is a film to protect the TFT layer, which is usually formed by chemical vapor phase epitaxy (CVD) techniques of nitride film (SiNx), oxide film (SiOx) and etc. Also, the first oriented film 105 is a film having a function to make the liquid crystal oriented, and such material often used is usually high polymeric material such as polyimide. As an application liquid, used is an orientation agent solution including polymer material and a solvent. The oriented film might inhibit the adhesive force with the seal material, so that it applied as a pattern in the sealed region. The application method to be used can include a printing method such as flexo printing method, or a droplet discharge method such as ink jet. Thereby applied orientation agent solution is temporarily dried to evaporate the solvent, and then, baked to crosslinking curing. Then, an orientation processing is performed to exhibit the orientation function. The orientation processing is usually carried out by means of rubbing method. On the polymer membrane formed as explained before, a rubbing cloth made of fiber such as rayon is used such that it is rubbed in one direction to generate the liquid crystalline orientation ability. In addition, a light orientation method can be used. The light orientation method is a method to produce the orientation ability by irradiating polarization on the oriented film including an organic material having photosensitivity. This method does not produce wound or dust on the substrate unlike the rubbing method. The example of the organic material in the light orientation method can include materials including dichromatic dye. The dichromatic dye can include a group to cause orientation induction of the molecule due to the Weigert Effect resulting in the photodichroism; or a group to cause photoreaction which results in the liquid crystalline orientation ability (which is hereinafter referred to as light orientation group) such as isomerization reaction (e.g., azobenzene group), dimerization reaction (e.g., cinnamoyl group), photocrosslinking reaction (e.g., benzophenone group), or photolysis reaction (e.g., polyimido group). After the solvent is evaporated by temporary drying, the orientation agent solution as applied is exposed to light (polarization) having any inclination so as to produce an oriented film having an orientation ability in any direction. One front-plane is provided with black matrix 202, color filter 203, flattened film 201, transparent electrode 204, and second oriented film 205 on the second substrate 200. For example, the black matrix 202 is made by a pigment dispersion method. In detail, on the second substrate 200 having the barrier film 201, color resin liquid which uniformly disperses black colorant for forming the black matrix is applied so as to form the color layer. Then, the color layer is baked to cure. Thereon, a photoresist is applied, and prebake is carried out. The photoresist is exposed to light through a mask pattern, and then it is developed to pattern the color layer. Then, the photoresist layer is exfoliated, and the color layer is baked to complete the black matrix 202. Alternatively, a pigment dispersion liquid of a photoresist type can be used. In this case, the pigment dispersion liquid of the photoresist type is applied and prebake is carried out, which is then exposed to light through a mask pattern, and thereafter, it is developed so as to pattern the color layer. Then, the photoresist layer is exfoliated, and the color layer is baked to complete the black matrix 202. The color filter 203 is made by pigment dispersion method, electrodeposition technique, printing method or dyeing method. For example, the pigment dispersion method is explained. A color resin liquid in which pigment (for example, red pigment) is uniformly dispersed is applied on the second substrate 200, and then, baking is carried out to cure. Thereon, a photoresist is applied and pre-baking is carried out. The photoresist is exposed to light through a mask pattern, and then, it is developed for patterning. Then, the photoresist layer is exfoliated, and it is again baked to complete the (red) color filter 203 (203a). The order of the color to make is not particularly limited. Similarly, green color filter 203 (203b) and blue color filter 203 (203c) are formed. The transparent electrode 204 is provided on the color filter 203 (if necessary, on the color filter 203 an overcoat layer (201) is provided for the surface flattening). The transparent electrode 204 is preferable if it has high transmissivity, and if it has small electrical resistance. The transparent electrode 204 is formed by carrying out the sputtering method of oxide film such as ITO. Also, for the purpose to protect the transparent electrode 204, a passivation film can be formed on transparent electrode 204. The second oriented film 205 is the same as the first oriented film 105 as explained above. As explained above, concrete embodiments of the back-plane and the front-plane have been explained to be used in the present invention. However, the present invention is not limited to the concrete embodiments above, and changes can be freely made depending on the desired liquid crystal display element. The shape of the columnar spacer is not particularly limited, and it can be various. The example of its horizontal section can include a circle, and a polygon such as quadrangle. In consideration of the misalignment margin at the time of the process, it is preferable that the horizontal section is in a shape of a circle or a regular polygon. Also, the shape of the projection is preferably a circular truncated cone or a prismoid. The material of the columnar spacer is not particularly limited, so long as it does not dissolve with the seal material, or an organic solvent used for the seal material, or the liquid crystal. It is, however, preferable to use a synthetic resin (curable resin) in view of the processing and weight saving. On the other hand, the projection can be formed on the first substrate to which the seal material contacts, by means of a photolithography method, or a droplet discharge method. Because of the reasons above, it is preferable to use a photocurable resin suitable for the photolithography method and the droplet discharge method. As an example, the explanation is made in case where the columnar spacer is formed by means of a photolithography method. FIG. 2 shows the exposure processing process using the pattern to produce a columnar spacer to form on the black matrix as a photomask pattern. On the transparent electrode 204 of the front-plane, a resin liquid for forming the columnar spacer (in which no colorant is included) is applied. Then, the resin layer 402 is baked and cured. Thereon, a photoresist is applied, and prebake is carried out. The photoresist is exposed to light through a mask pattern 401, and then, it is developed to pattern the resin layer. Then, the photoresist layer is exfoliated, and the resin layer is baked to complete the columnar spacer (References 302 and 0304 in FIG. 1). The formation position of the columnar spacer can be decided as desired, depending on the mask pattern. Therefore, both inside and outside of the sealed region of the liquid crystal display element (i.e., the portion where the seal material is applied) can be formed simultaneously. Also, the columnar spacer is preferably formed to be located on the black matrix in order not to deteriorate the quality of the sealed region. The columnar spacer formed by the photolithography method in this way may be called as a column spacer or a photospacer. The material of the spacer can include a mixture of a negative aqueous resin such as the PVA-stilbazo photosensitive resin, multi-functional acrylic type monomer, acrylic acid copolymer, and triazole type initiator. Alternatively, there is a way to use a color resin in which colorant is dispersed in polyimide resin. It is not particularly limited in the present invention, and the spacer can be formed from known materials, depending on the affinity between the liquid crystal and the seal material, and so on. In this way, after the columnar spacer is formed on the surface to become the sealed region on the front-plane, the seal material (reference 301 in FIG. 1) is applied on the back-plane surface to which the seal material contacts. The material of the seal material is not particularly limited, and used can be a curable resin composition which has added a photocurable, thermosetting or light/heat curable such as epoxy type or acrylic type; and a polymerization initiator. In addition, in order to control the moisture permeability, elastic modulus and viscosity, there may be added fillers of inorganic materials or organic materials. The shape of these fillers is not particularly limited, and can be a spherical, fibrous, or amorphous. Furthermore, in order to favorably control the cell gap, gap materials having a spherical or fibrous shape with a monodispersed diameter can be mixed. Also, in order to increase the strength of the adhesive force with the substrate, fibrous materials which are easy to get twisted with the projections on the substrate can be mixed. The diameter of the fibrous material to be used here is preferably in the level of ⅕ to 1/10 or less of the cell gap, and the length of the fibrous material is desirably shorter than the width of the seal as applied. Also, the material of the fibrous material is not particularly limited, and can be appropriately selected from synthetic fiber such as cellulose, polyamide and polyester; and inorganic materials such as glass and carbon. The method to apply the seal material can include a printing method and a dispensing method, but the dispensing method is desirable since the usage amount of the seal material can be smaller. The application position of the seal material is usually set on the black matrix in order not to adversely affect the sealed region. In order to form the liquid crystal drip region in the subsequent process (in order not to leak the liquid crystal), the shape of the seal material application is a closed-loop. The liquid crystal is dropped in the closed-loop shape (i.e., the sealed region) of the front-plane where the seal material has been applied. A dispenser is usually used. In order to match the liquid crystal quantity to be dropped with the liquid crystalline cell capacity, the quantity is basically equal to the product of the height of the columnar spacer and the area of the seal application. However, in view of the liquid crystal leak or the optimization of the display characteristic during the cell lamination process, the liquid crystal quantity to be dropped can be adjusted appropriately, or the liquid crystal drip position can be dispersed. Then, the back-plane is laminated to the front-plane in which the seal material has been applied and the liquid crystal has been dropped. In detail, on a stage having a mechanism that can adhere to a substrate such as an electrostatic chuck device, the front-plane and the back-plane are adhered. The second oriented film of the front-plane and the first oriented film of the back-plane are faced to each other, so as to set in a position (distance) such that the seal material and the other substrate do not contact with each other. The inside in the system is vacuumed in this state. After finishing the vacuum, the positions of both substrates are adjusted while confirming the lamination position of the front-plane and the back-plane (i.e., alignment operation). After completing the adjustment of the lamination position, the substrate is made close to the position where the back-plane contacts the seal material on the front-plane. In this state, an inert gas is filled inside the system, and then, returned to the normal pressure while gradually releasing the reduced pressure. At this time, the front-plane and the back-plane are laminated together due to the atmospheric pressure, while a cell gap is formed by the height position of the columnar spacer. In this state, the seal material is exposed to ultraviolet rays to cure the seal material to form a liquid crystal cell. Then, if necessary, a heating step is carried out to promote the curing of the seal material. In order to improve the reinforcement of the adhesive strength and the electrical characteristics reliability of the seal material, a heating step is often added. EXAMPLES The present invention is explained more in detail with reference to the Examples, but the present invention is not limited to these Examples. Also, the term “%” in the composition of the Examples and the Comparative Examples below means “mass %.” In the Examples, the characteristics that were measured are as follows.

A predetermined fixed pattern was displayed inside the display area for six weeks, and then, a uniform displaying at full screen was performed to check the level of the afterimage of the fixed pattern by visual observation to evaluate it by four grades. “A”: No afterimage. “B”: Acceptable level though there were a few afterimages “C”: Unacceptable level due to the afterimages “D” Very inferior due to the existence of the afterimages <Evaluation of the Volatility (Production Device Staining)> Into a specific container of a vacuum stirring degassing mixer with a volume of 0.33 L, 0.15 kg of the liquid crystal composition was put. While operating the vacuum stirring degassing mixer at a revolution speed of 20 S−1 and at a rotation speed of 10.0 S−1 to deair it to 15 kPa, the foaming of the liquid crystal material was visually observed. The volatility was classified in four levels below, depending o the time until the foaming began from the operation start of the mixer. “A”: It took 3 minutes or more until it foamed. It was unlikely to cause the staining of the device by the volatilization. “B”: It took 1 minute or more and 3 minutes or less until it foamed.

There was concern of significant stain of the device caused by the volatilization. <Evaluation of the Process Compatibility> In the ODF process, a constant volume metering pump was used. 50 pL of the liquid crystal was dropped per one time, and this step was repeated 100,000 times. For each 100 times (i.e., 0-100 times, 101-200 times, 201-300 times, . . . 99901-100,000 times), the change of the amount of the liquid crystal was evaluated by following four grades. “A”: The change was extremely small (the liquid crystal display element can be produced stably). “B”: Acceptable level though there were slight changes. “C”: Unacceptable Level due to the changes (the yield was worsened by spot outbreak). “D”: Considerably inferior because of the changes (i.e., the leak of the liquid crystal or vacuum air void was generated). <Evaluation of the Solubility at Low Temperature> The evaluation of the solubility at a low temperature was made as follows. After preparation of a liquid crystal composition, 0.5 g of the liquid crystal composition was weighted in a sample pot of 1 mL, which was put in a test bath with temperature control, and applied to one cycle of the temperature changes as follows: “−25° C. (kept for one hour)→raising the temperature (0.2° C./minute)→0° C. (kept for one hour)→raising the temperature (0.2° C./minute)→25° C. (kept for one hour)→decreasing the temperature (−0.2° C./minute)→0° C. (kept for one hour)→decreasing the temperature (−0.2° C./minute)→−25° C.” During the cycle, the generation of the deposit from the liquid crystal composition was visually observed by the four grades below. “A”: No deposits were observed for 480 hours or more. “B”: No deposits were observed for 240 hours or more. “C”: Deposits were observed within 120 hours. “D”: Deposits were observed within 60 hours.
