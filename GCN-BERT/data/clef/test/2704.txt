DETAILED DESCRIPTION Before describing the invention in detail, it is to be understood that this invention is not limited to particular compositions or biological systems, which can, of course, vary. It is also to be understood that the terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only, and is not intended to be limiting. As used in this specification and the appended claims, the singular forms “a,” “an,” and “the” include plural referents unless the content clearly dictates otherwise. Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which the invention pertains. Although any methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice for testing of the invention(s), specific examples of appropriate materials and methods are described herein. Also, the use of “or” means “and/or” unless stated otherwise. Similarly, “comprise,” “comprises,” “comprising,” “include,” “includes,” and “including” are interchangeable and not intended to be limiting. It is to be further understood that where descriptions of various embodiments use the term “comprising,” those skilled in the art would understand that in some specific instances, an embodiment can be alternatively described using language “consisting essentially of” or “consisting of.” Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood to one of ordinary skill in the art to which this disclosure belongs. Although any methods and reagents similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice of the disclosed methods and compositions, the exemplary methods and materials are now described. Thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP)-dependent enzymes, including 2-keto acid decarboxylase and acetolactate synthase, perform a diverse range of reactions. Acetolactate synthase catalyzes the condensation of two pyruvates to form 2-acetolactate. Isobutanol production from Escherichia coli has been demonstrated using a 2-keto acid-based pathway. This pathway contained two TPP-dependent enzymes, acetolactate synthase (ALS) and 2-keto acid decarboxylase (KDC). The present disclosure provides an ALS from Bacillus subtilis that catalyzes a decarboxylation of 2-ketoisovalerate like KDC both in vivo and in vitro. The disclosure further provides engineered metabolic pathways comprising such a polypeptide. The disclosure further provides expression of ALS in E. coli to produce isobutanol without the presence of KDC. Mutational studies of ALS have revealed that replacement of Q487 with alanine diminishes only decarboxylase activity and maintains synthase activity. The fact that acetolactate synthase catalyzes a decarboxylation reaction supports the hypothesis that TPP-dependent enzymes have diverged from a common ancestor during their evolution. TPP is a cofactor whose biochemical functions and mechanistic role are well understood. TPP-dependent enzymes perform a diverse range of reactions, including non-oxidative decarboxylation of 2-keto acids, oxidative decarboxylation of 2-keto acids, and carboligation. It is generally accepted that the initial step in catalysis by these enzymes is the deprotonation of the thiazolium ring at the C-2 atom involving a conserved glutamate, N-1′, and the 4′-amino group. Protein sequence comparisons of various TPP-dependent enzymes reveal that these enzymes share high sequence homology with each other. In addition, protein structure comparisons of TPP-dependent enzymes: transketolase, pyruvate oxidase, and pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC), indicated that their TPP-binding sites are very similar. ALS is part of the valine biosynthesis pathway and catalyzes the aldo condensation of two molecules of pyruvate to 2-acetolactate. The overall reaction catalyzed by ALS is irreversible because of CO2 evolution. The first step in catalysis is the ionization of the thiazolium ring of TPP. The highly reactive tricyclic intermediate first forms and this reacts with the first pyruvate that then decarboxylates to give the relatively non-reactive enamine. Because this intermediate is stable, the enzyme can pause midway through the catalytic cycle while releasing CO2 and admitting the second molecule of pyruvate. The tricyclic-carbanion then forms, followed by reacting with the second pyruvate. Deprotonation followed by C—C bond breakage completes the reaction, producing 2-acetolactate. KDC is a non-oxidative TPP-dependent enzyme. KDCs are rare in bacteria, being more frequent in plants, yeasts, and fungi. A number of KDCs have been identified in various organisms, and these enzymes include PDC, phenylpyruvate decarboxylase, branched-chain 2-keto acid decarboxylase, 2-ketoglutarate decarboxylase, and indole-3-pyruvate decarboxylase. 2-Keto acids are intermediates in amino acid biosynthesis pathways and can be converted to aldehydes by KDCs in the Ehrlich pathway. In a previous study to produce isobutanol, glucose was converted to 2-ketoisovalerate through over-expressed AlsS (Bacillus subtilis), IlvC (E. coli), and IlvD (E. coli) (FIG. 1) (Atsumi and Liao, Nature, 451:86-89, 2008). The resulting 2-ketoisovalerate (2-KIV) is then converted to isobutanol using Kivd (Lactoccus lactis) and Adh2 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) (FIG. 1A). This strain produced 6.8 g/L isobutanol in 24 hrs and more than 20 g/L in 112 hrs (id.). The present disclosure describes the use of ALS from B. subtilis (SEQ ID NO:1 and 2) in a recombinant microorganism for the generation of biofuels including isobutanol. Furthermore, the disclosure provided a variant ALS that can be used in such microorganisms. Both the wild-type and variant ALS can be engineered into a micoroorganism to generate a recombinant metabolic pathway for the generation of a biofuel such as isobutanol in the absence of a KDC. While these polypeptides and variants will be described in more detail below, it is understood that polypeptides of the disclosure can contain one or more modified amino acids or additional conservative amino acid substitutions. The presence of modified amino acids can be advantageous in, for example, (a) increasing polypeptide in vivo half-life, (b) reducing or increasing polypeptide antigenicity, and (c) increasing polypeptide storage stability. Amino acid(s) are modified, for example, co-translationally or post-translationally during recombinant production (e.g., N-linked glycosylation at N—X—S/T motifs during expression in eukaryotic cells) or modified by synthetic means. Accordingly, a “mutant”, “variant” or “modified” protein, enzyme, polynucleotide, gene, or cell, means a protein, enzyme, polynucleotide, gene, or cell, that has been altered or derived, or is in some way different or changed, from a parent protein, enzyme, polynucleotide, gene, or cell. A mutant or modified protein or enzyme is usually, although not necessarily, expressed from a mutant polynucleotide or gene. A “parent” protein, enzyme, polynucleotide, gene, or cell, is any protein, enzyme, polynucleotide, gene, or cell, from which any other protein, enzyme, polynucleotide, gene, or cell, is derived or made, using any methods, tools, or techniques, and whether or not the parent is itself native or mutant. A parent polynucleotide or gene encodes for a parent protein or enzyme. A “mutation” means any process or mechanism resulting in a mutant protein, enzyme, polynucleotide, gene, or cell. This includes any mutation in which a protein, enzyme, polynucleotide, or gene sequence is altered, and any detectable change in a cell arising from such a mutation. Typically, a mutation occurs in a polynucleotide or gene sequence, by point mutations, deletions, or insertions of single or multiple nucleotide residues. A mutation includes polynucleotide alterations arising within a protein-encoding region of a gene as well as alterations in regions outside of a protein-encoding sequence, such as, but not limited to, regulatory or promoter sequences. A mutation in a gene can be “silent”, i.e., not reflected in an amino acid alteration upon expression, leading to a “sequence-conservative” variant of the gene. This generally arises when one amino acid corresponds to more than one codon. Non-limiting examples of a modified amino acid include a glycosylated amino acid, a sulfated amino acid, a prenylated (e.g., farnesylated, geranylgeranylated) amino acid, an acetylated amino acid, an acylated amino acid, a pegylated amino acid, a biotinylated amino acid, a carboxylated amino acid, a phosphorylated amino acid, and the like. References adequate to guide one of skill in the modification of amino acids are replete throughout the literature. Example protocols are found in Walker (1998) Protein Protocols on CD-ROM (Humana Press, Towata, N.J.). A “protein” or “polypeptide”, which terms are used interchangeably herein, comprises one or more chains of chemical building blocks called amino acids that are linked together by chemical bonds called peptide bonds. An “enzyme” means any substance, composed wholly or largely of protein, that catalyzes or promotes, more or less specifically, one or more chemical or biochemical reactions. A “native” or “wild-type” protein, enzyme, polynucleotide, gene, or cell, means a protein, enzyme, polynucleotide, gene, or cell that occurs in nature. The polypeptides disclosed herein are useful in the production of biofuels including isobutanol from recombinant microorganisms. In one embodiment, the microorganism is E. coli. In another embodiment, the microorganism lacks a gene encoding a 2-keto acid decarboxylase. In yet another embodiment, the microorganism is an E. coli that is engineered to express a recombinant ALS or variant thereof and lacks one or more genes encoding enzymes in a competitive metabolic pathway that causes a flux of substrates away from the desired product (e.g., a biofuel such as isobutanol). The production of isobutanol and other fusel alcohols by various yeast species, including Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is of special interest to the distillers of alcoholic beverages, for whom fusel alcohols constitute often undesirable off-notes. Production of isobutanol in wild-type yeasts has been documented on various growth media, ranging from grape must from winemaking (Romano, et al., (2003) World J. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 19:311-315), in which 12-219 mg/L isobutanol were produced, to supplemented minimal media (Oliviera, et al. (2005) World J. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 21:1569-1576), producing 16-34 mg/L isobutanol. Work from Dickinson, et al., (J. Biol. Chem. 272:26871-26878, 1997) has identified the enzymatic steps utilized in a pathway converting branch-chain amino acids (e.g., valine or leucine) to isobutanol. The present disclosure provides metabolically engineered microorganisms comprising biochemical pathways for the production of higher alcohols including isobutanol from a suitable substrate. A metabolically engineered microorganism of the disclosure comprises one or more recombinant polynucleotides within the genome of the organism or external to the genome within the organism. The microorganism can comprise a reduction, disruption, or knockout of a gene found in the wild-type organism and/or introduction of a heterologous polynucleotide. The present disclosure also includes metabolically engineered biosynthetic pathways that utilize an organism's native amino acid pathway. Biofuel production utilizing the organism's native amino acid biosynthetic pathways offers several advantages. Not only does it avoid the difficulty of expressing a large set of foreign genes but it also minimizes the possible accumulation of toxic intermediates. Contrary to the butanol production pathway found in many species of Clostridium, the engineered amino acid biosynthetic routes for biofuel production circumvent the need to involve oxygen-sensitive enzymes and CoA-dependent intermediates. In one embodiment, the disclosure provides a recombinant microorganism comprising elevated expression of at least one target enzyme as compared to a parental microorganism or encodes an enzyme not found in the parental organism. In a specific embodiment, the enzyme comprises an acetolactate synthase (ALS). In yet another embodiment, the enzyme comprises an acetolactate synthase from B. subtilis. In a further embodiment, the enzyme comprises a sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO:2 or a variant having at least 80%, 90%, 95%, 98%, or 99% identity to SEQ ID NO:2 and having acetolactate synthase activity. In some embodiments wherein the microorganism comprises an acetolactate synthase from B. subtilis or a derivative thereof, the microorganism lacks a 2-keto acid decarboxylase. In a further embodiment, the enzyme comprises a sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO:7 or a variant having at least 80%, 90%, 95%, 98%, or 99% identity to SEQ ID NO:7, and having acetolactate synthase activity. In another or further embodiment, the microorganism comprises a reduction, disruption, or knockout of at least one gene encoding an enzyme that competes with a metabolite necessary for the production of a desired higher alcohol product. The recombinant microorganism produces at least one metabolite involved in a biosynthetic pathway for the production of isobutanol or other a higher alcohol. In general, the recombinant microorganism comprises at least one recombinant metabolic pathway that comprises a target enzyme and can further include a reduction in activity or expression of an enzyme in a competitive biosynthetic pathway. The pathway acts to modify a substrate or metabolic intermediate in the production of a biofuel such as isobutanol. The target enzyme is encoded by, and expressed from, a polynucleotide derived from a suitable biological source. In some embodiments, the polynucleotide comprises a gene derived from a bacterial or yeast source and recombinantly engineered into the microorganism of the disclosure. As used herein, the term “metabolically engineered” or “metabolic engineering” involves rational pathway design and assembly of biosynthetic genes, genes associated with operons, and control elements of such polynucleotides, for the production of a desired metabolite, such as a 2-keto acid or a higher alcohol, in a microorganism. “Metabolically engineered” can further include optimization of metabolic flux by regulation and optimization of transcription, translation, protein stability, and protein functionality using genetic engineering and appropriate culture conditions including the reduction of, disruption, or knocking out of, a competing metabolic pathway that competes with an intermediate leading to a desired pathway. A biosynthetic gene can be heterologous to the host microorganism, either by virtue of being foreign to the host, or by being modified by mutagenesis, recombination, and/or association with a heterologous expression control sequence in an endogenous host cell. In one embodiment, where the polynucleotide is xenogenetic to the host organism, the polynucleotide can be codon optimized. The term “biosynthetic pathway”, also referred to as “metabolic pathway”, refers to a set of anabolic or catabolic biochemical reactions for converting (transmuting) one chemical species into another. Gene products belong to the same “metabolic pathway” if they, in parallel or in series, act on the same substrate, produce the same product, or act on or produce a metabolic intermediate (i.e., metabolite) between the same substrate and metabolite end product. For example, L-valine is synthesized through a biosynthetic pathway inherent to L-valine which diverges from the intermediate (2-ketoisovalerate) of the L-leucine biosynthesis system. In Escherichia, the biosynthesis of L-valine and biosynthesis inherent to L-leucine are carried out by a group of enzymes encoded by ilvGMEDA operon and those encoded by leuABCD operon, respectively. The ilvGMEDA operon includes ilvG, ilvM, ilvE, ilvD, and ilvA genes. Among them, ilvG encodes acetolactate synthase II large subunit, ilvM encodes acetolactate II synthase small subunit, ilvE encodes branched-chain amino acid amino transferase, ilvD encodes dihydroxyacid dehydratase, and ilvA encodes threonine deaminase. In some species and strains of E. coli, ilvG and ilvM are silent. The leuABCD operon includes leuA, leuB, leuC, and leuD genes. Among them, leuA encodes α-isopropylmalate synthase, leuB encodes β-isopropylmalate dehydrogenase, and leuC and leuD encode α-isopropylmalate isomerase. Of these enzymes, α-isopropylmalate synthase catalyzes the synthetic reaction from α-ketoisovalerate to α-isopropylmalate, α-isopropylmalate isomerase catalyzes the isomerization reaction from α-isopropylmalate to β-isopropylmalate, and β-isopropylmalate dehydrogenase catalyzes the dehydrogenation reaction from β-isopropylmalate to α-ketoisocaproic acid, which is the final intermediate of L-leucine biosynthesis. Escherichia possess four kinds of transaminases, namely, transaminase A (aspartate-glutamate aminotransferase) encoded by aspC gene, transaminase B (BCAA aminotransferase) encoded by ilvE gene which is included in ilvGMEDA operon, transaminase C (alanine-valine aminotransferase) encoded by avtA gene and transaminase D (tyrosine aminotransferase) encoded by tyrB gene. These enzymes participate in various amination reactions. Of these enzymes, transaminase B and transaminase D catalyze the above-mentioned amination reaction from α-ketoisocaproic acid to L-leucine. Transaminase C and transaminase D catalyze the final step of L-valine biosynthetic pathway, which includes a common pathway among the L-valine biosynthesis and L-leucine biosynthesis pathways. Expression of ilvBN gene encoding acetohydroxy acid synthase I suffers concerted repression by L-valine and L-leucine, expression of ilvGM gene encoding acetohydroxy acid synthase II suffers concerted repression by L-isoleucine, L-valine, and L-leucine, and expression of ilvIH gene encoding acetohydroxy acid synthase III suffers repression by L-leucine. The term “substrate” or “suitable substrate” refers to any substance or compound that is converted or meant to be converted into another compound by the action of an enzyme. The term includes not only a single compound, but also combinations of compounds, such as solutions, mixtures, and other materials which contain at least one substrate, or derivatives thereof. Further, the term “substrate” encompasses not only compounds that provide a carbon source suitable for use as a starting material, such as any biomass derived sugar, but also intermediate and end product metabolites used in a pathway associated with a metabolically engineered microorganism as described herein. A “biomass derived sugar” includes, but is not limited to, molecules such as glucose, sucrose, mannose, xylose, and arabinose. The term biomass derived sugar encompasses suitable carbon substrates ordinarily used by microorganisms, such as 6 carbon sugars, including but not limited to glucose, lactose, sorbose, fructose, idose, galactose, and mannose all in either D or L form, or a combination of 6 carbon sugars, such as glucose and fructose, and/or 6 carbon sugar acids including, but not limited to, 2-keto-L-gulonic acid, idonic acid (IA), gluconic acid (GA), 6-phosphogluconate, 2-keto-D-gluconic acid (2 KDG), 5-keto-D-gluconic acid, 2-ketogluconatephosphate, 2,5-diketo-L-gulonic acid, 2,3-L-diketogulonic acid, dehydroascorbic acid, erythorbic acid (EA), and D-mannonic acid. The term “alcohol” includes for example 1-propanol, isobutanol, 1-butanol, 2-methyl-1-butanol, 3-methyl-1-butanol, or 2-phenylethanol. The term “1-butanol” or “n-butanol” generally refers to a straight chain isomer with the alcohol functional group at the terminal carbon. The straight chain isomer with the alcohol at an internal carbon is sec-butanol or 2-butanol. The branched isomer with the alcohol at a terminal carbon is isobutanol, and the branched isomer with the alcohol at the internal carbon is tert-butanol. Recombinant microorganisms provided herein can express a plurality of target enzymes involved in pathways for the production of, for example, isobutanol, 1-propanol, 1-butanol, 2-methyl-1-butanol, 3-methyl-1-butanol, or 2-phenylethanol using a suitable carbon substrate. Accordingly, metabolically “engineered” or “modified” microorganisms are produced via the introduction of genetic material into a host or parental microorganism of choice, thereby modifying or altering the cellular physiology and biochemistry of the microorganism. Through the introduction of genetic material, the parental microorganism acquires new properties, e.g., the ability to produce a new, or greater quantities of, an intracellular metabolite. In an illustrative embodiment, the introduction of genetic material into a parental microorganism results in a new or modified ability to produce an alcohol such as isobutanol, 1-propanol, 1-butanol, 2-methyl-1-butanol, 3-methyl-1-butanol, or 2-phenylethanol. The genetic material introduced into the parental microorganism contains gene(s), or parts of genes, coding for one or more of the enzymes involved in a biosynthetic pathway for the production of an alcohol and may also include additional elements for the expression and/or regulation of expression of these genes, e.g., promoter sequences. An engineered or modified microorganism can also include in the alternative or in addition to the introduction of a genetic material into a host or parental micoorganism, the disruption, deletion, or knocking out of a gene or polynucleotide to alter the cellular physiology and biochemistry of the microorganism. Through the reduction, disruption, or knocking out of a gene or polynucleotide the microorganism acquires new or improved properties (e.g., the ability to produce a new or greater quantities of an intracellular metabolite, improve the flux of a metabolite down a desired pathway, and/or reduce the production of undesirable by-products). The disclosure demonstrates that the expression of one or more heterologous polynucleotide(s) or over-expression of one or more heterologous polynucleotide(s) encoding a polypeptide having both acetolactate synthase and keto acid decarboxylase activity are useful in the generation of isobutanol. In one specific embodiment, the disclosure demonstrates that with over-expression of the heterologous alsS gene from B. subtilis and adh2, and the ilvC and IlvD from E. coli, the production of isobutanol can be obtained. Microorganisms provided herein are modified to produce metabolites in quantities not available in the parental microorganism. A “metabolite” refers to any substance produced by metabolism or a substance necessary for or taking part in a particular metabolic process. A metabolite can be an organic compound that is a starting material (e.g., glucose or pyruvate), an intermediate (e.g., 2-keto acid), or an end product (e.g., 1-propanol, isobutanol, 1-butanol, 2-methyl-1-butanol, 3-methyl-1-butanol, or 2-phenylethanol) of metabolism. Metabolites can be used to construct more complex molecules, or they can be broken down into simpler ones. Intermediate metabolites may be synthesized from other metabolites, perhaps used to make more complex substances, or broken down into simpler compounds, often with the release of chemical energy. Exemplary metabolites include glucose, pyruvate, 1-propanol, isobutanol, 1-butanol, 2-methyl-1-butanol, 3-methyl-1-butanol or 2-phenylethanol, and 2-ketoisovalerate or 2-ketovaleric acids. As depicted in FIG. 1A, exemplary 2-keto acid intermediates include 2-ketobutyrate, 2-ketoisovalerate, 2-ketovalerate, 2-keto 3-methylvalerate, 2-keto 4-methyl-pentanoate, and phenylpyruvate. Accordingly, provided herein are recombinant microorganisms that produce isobutanol and in some aspects may include the elevated expression of target enzymes such as acetohydroxy acid synthase (e.g., ilvIH operon, or any other als containing operon), acetohydroxy acid isomeroreductase (e.g., ilvC), dihydroxy-acid dehydratase (e.g., ilvD), and alcohol dehydrogenase (e.g., ADH2). The microorganism can further include the deletion or inhibition of expression of an ethanol dehydrogenase (e.g., an adhE), ldh (e.g., an ldhA), frd (e.g., an frdB, an frdC or an frdBC), fnr, leuA, ilvE, poxB, ilvA, pflB, or pta gene, or any combination thereof, to increase the availability of pyruvate or reduce enzymes that compete for a metabolite in a desired biosynthetic pathway. In some aspects the recombinant microorganism can include the elevated expression of acetolactate synthase (e.g., alsS), acetohydroxy acid isomeroreductase (e.g., ilvC), dihydroxy-acid dehydratase (e.g., ilvD), and alcohol dehydrogenase (e.g., ADH2). With reference to alcohol dehydrogenases, although ethanol dehydrogenase is an alcohol dehydrogenase, the synthesis of ethanol is undesirable as a by-product in the biosynthetic pathways. Accordingly, reference to an increase in alcohol dehydrogenase activity or expression in a microorganism specifically excludes ethanol dehydrogenase activity. As previously noted the target enzymes described throughout this disclosure generally produce metabolites. For example, the enzymes acetolactate synthase (alsS), acetohydroxy acid isomeroreductase (ilvC), and dihydroxy-acid dehydratase (ilvD) can produce 2-ketoisovalerate from a substrate that includes pyruvate. In addition, the target enzymes described throughout this disclosure are encoded by polynucleotides. For example, acetohydroxy acid isomeroreductase can be encoded by a polynucleotide derived from an ilvC gene. Dihydroxy-acid dehydratase can be encoded by a polynucleotide derived from an ilvD gene. Alcohol dehydrogenase can be encoded by a polynucleotide derived from an ADH2 gene. Additional enzymes and exemplary genes are described throughout this document. Homologs of the various polypeptides and polynucleotides can be derived from any biologic source that provides a suitable polynucleotide encoding a suitable enzyme. Homologs, for example, can be identified by reference to various databases. The disclosure identifies specific genes useful in the methods, compositions, and organisms of the disclosure; however it will be recognized that absolute identity to such genes is not necessary. For example, changes in a particular gene or polynucleotide comprising a sequence encoding a polypeptide or enzyme can be performed and screened for activity. Typically such changes comprise conservative mutations and/or silent mutations. Such modified or mutated polynucleotides and polypeptides can be screened for expression of a functional enzyme activity using methods known in the art. Due to the inherent degeneracy of the genetic code, other polynucleotides which encode substantially the same or a functionally equivalent polypeptide can also be used to clone and express the polynucleotides encoding such enzymes. As will be understood by those of skill in the art, it can be advantageous to modify a coding sequence to enhance its expression in a particular host. The genetic code is redundant with 64 possible codons, but most organisms typically use a subset of these codons. The codons that are utilized most often in a species are called optimal codons, and those not utilized very often are classified as rare or low-usage codons. Codons can be substituted to reflect the preferred codon usage of the host, a process sometimes called “codon optimization” or “controlling for species codon bias.” Optimized coding sequences containing codons preferred by a particular prokaryotic or eukaryotic host (see also, Murray et al. (1989) Nucl. Acids Res. 17:477-508) can be prepared, for example, to increase the rate of translation or to produce recombinant RNA transcripts having desirable properties, such as a longer half-life, as compared with transcripts produced from a non-optimized sequence. Translation stop codons can also be modified to reflect host preference. For example, typical stop codons for S. cerevisiae and mammals are UAA and UGA, respectively. The typical stop codon for monocotyledonous plants is UGA, whereas insects and E. coli commonly use UAA as the stop codon (Dalphin et al. (1996) Nucl. Acids Res. 24:216-218). Methodology for optimizing a nucleotide sequence for expression in a plant is provided, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 6,015,891, and the references cited therein, all incorporated herein in their entirety. In addition, homologs of enzymes useful for generating metabolites are encompassed by the microorganisms and methods provided herein. The term “homologs” used with respect to an original enzyme or gene of a first family or species refers to distinct enzymes or genes of a second family or species which are determined by functional, structural, or genomic analyses to be an enzyme or gene of the second family or species which corresponds to the original enzyme or gene of the first family or species. Most often, homologs will have functional, structural, and/or genomic similarities. Techniques are known to the skilled artisan by which homologs of an enzyme or gene can readily be cloned using genetic probes and PCR. Identity of cloned sequences as a homolog can be confirmed using functional assays and/or by genomic mapping of the genes. A protein has “homology” or is “homologous” to a second protein if the nucleic acid sequence that encodes the protein has a similar sequence to the nucleic acid sequence that encodes the second protein. Alternatively, a protein has homology to a second protein if the two proteins have “similar” amino acid sequences. (Thus, the term “homologous proteins” is defined to mean that the two proteins have similar amino acid sequences.) As used herein, two proteins (or a region of the proteins) are substantially homologous when the amino acid sequences have at least 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% identity. To determine the percent identity of two amino acid sequences, or of two nucleic acid sequences, the sequences are aligned for optimal comparison purposes (e.g., gaps can be introduced in one or both of a first and a second amino acid or nucleic acid sequence for optimal alignment and non-homologous sequences can be disregarded for comparison purposes). In one embodiment, the length of a reference sequence aligned for comparison purposes is at least 30%, typically at least 40%, more typically at least 50%, even more typically at least 60%, and even more typically at least 70%, 80%, 90%, or 100% of the length of the reference sequence. The amino acid residues or nucleotides at corresponding amino acid positions or nucleotide positions are then compared. When a position in the first sequence is occupied by the same amino acid residue or nucleotide as the corresponding position in the second sequence, then the molecules are identical at that position (as used herein amino acid or nucleic acid “identity” is equivalent to amino acid or nucleic acid “homology”). The percent identity between the two sequences is a function of the number of identical positions shared by the sequences, taking into account the number of gaps, and the length of each gap, which need to be introduced for optimal alignment of the two sequences. For example, reference to an als gene includes homologs from other organisms encoding an enzyme having substantially similar enzymatic activity, as well as genes having at least 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 85, 90, 95, 98, or 99% identity to the referenced gene and which encodes an enzyme having substantially similar enzymatic activity as the referenced gene. In particular, the homologs will have the highest level of amino acid sequence identity in the region of the active site or a co-factor binding site, and any other region of the enzyme necessary for its function. It is also understood that an isolated nucleic acid molecule encoding a polypeptide homologous to the enzymes described herein can be created by introducing one or more nucleotide substitutions, additions, or deletions into the nucleotide sequence encoding the particular polypeptide, such that one or more amino acid substitutions, additions, or deletions are introduced into the encoded protein. Mutations can be introduced into the polynucleotide by standard techniques, such as site-directed mutagenesis and PCR-mediated mutagenesis. In contrast to those positions where it may be desirable to make non-conservative amino acid substitutions (see above), in some positions it is preferable to make conservative amino acid substitutions. A “conservative amino acid substitution” is one in which an amino acid residue is substituted by another amino acid residue having a side chain (R group) with similar chemical properties (e.g., charge or hydrophobicity). In general, a conservative amino acid substitution will not substantially change the functional properties of a protein. In cases where two or more amino acid sequences differ from each other by conservative substitutions, the percent sequence identity or degree of homology may be adjusted upwards to correct for the conservative nature of the substitution. Means for making this adjustment are well known to those of skill in the art. Families of amino acid residues having similar side chains have been defined in the art. These families include amino acids with basic side chains (e.g., lysine, arginine, histidine), acidic side chains (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid), uncharged polar side chains (e.g., glycine, asparagine, glutamine, serine, threonine, tyrosine, cysteine), nonpolar side chains (e.g., alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, proline, phenylalanine, methionine, tryptophan), beta-branched side chains (e.g., threonine, valine, isoleucine) and aromatic side chains (e.g., tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, histidine). In addition, the following five groups each contain amino acids that are conservative substitutions for one another: 1) Serine (S), Threonine (T); 2) Asparagine (N), Glutamine (Q); 3) Arginine (R), Lysine (K); 4) Isoleucine (I), Leucine (L), Methionine (M), Alanine (A), Valine (V), and 5) Phenylalanine (F), Tyrosine (Y), Tryptophan (W). Sequence homology for polypeptides, which is also referred to as percent sequence identity, is typically measured using sequence analysis software. See, e.g., the Sequence Analysis Software Package of the Genetics Computer Group (GCG), University of Wisconsin Biotechnology Center, 910 University Avenue, Madison, Wis. 53705. Protein analysis software matches similar sequences using measure of homology assigned to various substitutions, deletions, and other modifications, including conservative amino acid substitutions. For instance, GCG contains programs such as “Gap” and “Bestfit” which can be used with default parameters to determine sequence homology or sequence identity between closely related polypeptides, such as homologous polypeptides from different species of organisms or between a wild type protein and a mutein thereof. See, e.g., GCG Version 6.1. A typical algorithm used for comparing a molecule sequence to a database containing a large number of sequences from different organisms is the computer program BLAST (Altschul, J. Mol. Biol. 215:403-441 (1990); Gish, Nature Genet. 3:266-272 (1993); Madden, Meth. Enzymol. 266:131-141 (1996); Altschul, Nucl. Acids Res. 25:3389-3402 (1997); Zhang, Genome Res. 7:649-656 (1997)), especially blastp or tblastn (Altschul, Nucl. Acids Res. 25:3389-3402 (1997)). Typical parameters for BLASTp are: Expectation value: 10 (default); Filter: seg (default); Cost to open a gap: 11 (default); Cost to extend a gap: 1 (default); Max. alignments: 100 (default); Word size: 11 (default); No. of descriptions: 100 (default); Penalty Matrix: BLOWSUM62. When searching a database containing sequences from a large number of different organisms, it is typical to compare amino acid sequences. Database searching using amino acid sequences can be measured by algorithms other than blastp known in the art. For instance, polypeptide sequences can be compared using FASTA, a program in GCG Version 6.1. FASTA provides alignments and percent sequence identity of the regions of the best overlap between the query and search sequences. For example, percent sequence identity between amino acid sequences can be determined using FASTA with its default parameters (a word size of 2 and the PAM250 scoring matrix), as provided in GCG Version 6.1, hereby incorporated herein by reference. The disclosure provides accession numbers for various genes, homologs and variants useful in the generation of recombinant microorganisms described herein. It is to be understood that homologs and variants described herein are exemplary and non-limiting. Additional homologs, variants and sequences are available to those of skill in the art using various databases including, for example, the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), access to which is available on the World-Wide-Web. Ethanol Dehydrogenase (also referred to as Aldehyde-alcohol DeHydrogenase) is encoded in E. coli by adhE. adhE comprises three activities: alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH); acetaldehyde/acetyl-CoA dehydrogenase (ACDH); pyruvate-formate-lyase deactivase (PFL deactivase); PFL deactivase activity catalyzes the quenching of the pyruvate-formate-lyase catalyst in an iron, NAD, and CoA dependent reaction. A decrease or modification of the expression or activity of ethanol dehydrogenase in a transformed host cell can be useful in the presently disclosed methods for the production of an alcohol, such as isobutanol, 2-methyl 1-butanol, and/or 2-methyl 1-butanol.

Two membrane-bound, FAD-containing enzymes are responsible for the catalysis of fumarate and succinate interconversion; the fumarate reductase is used in anaerobic growth, and the succinate dehydrogenase is used in aerobic growth.

It is understood that a range of microorganisms can be modified to include a recombinant metabolic pathway suitable for the production of e.g., 1-propanol, isobutanol, 1-butanol, 2-methyl-1-butanol, 3-methyl-1-butanol, or 2-phenylethanol. It is also understood that various microorganisms can act as “sources” for genetic material encoding target enzymes suitable for use in a recombinant microorganism provided herein. The term “microorganism” includes prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbial species from the Domains Archaea, Bacteria, and Eucarya, the latter including yeast and filamentous fungi, protozoa, algae, or higher Protista. The terms “microbial cells” and “microbes” are used interchangeably with the term “microorganism”. The term “prokaryotes” is art recognized and refers to cells which contain no nucleus or other cell organelles. The prokaryotes are generally classified in one of two domains, the Bacteria and the Archaea. The definitive difference between organisms of the Archaea and Bacteria domains is based on fundamental differences in the nucleotide base sequence in the 16S ribosomal RNA. The term “Archaea” refers to a categorization of organisms of the division Mendosicutes, typically found in unusual environments and distinguished from the rest of the prokaryotes by several criteria, including the number of ribosomal proteins and the lack of muramic acid in cell walls. On the basis of ssrRNA analysis, the Archaea consist of two phylogenetically-distinct groups: Crenarchaeota and Euryarchaeota. On the basis of their physiology, the Archaea can be organized into three types: methanogens (prokaryotes that produce methane); extreme halophiles (prokaryotes that live at very high concentrations of salt ((NaCl)); and extreme (hyper) thermophilus (prokaryotes that live at very high temperatures). Besides the unifying archaeal features that distinguish them from Bacteria (i.e., no murein in cell wall, ester-linked membrane lipids, and the like), these prokaryotes exhibit unique structural or biochemical attributes which adapt them to their particular habitats. The Crenarchaeota consists mainly of hyperthermophilic sulfur-dependent prokaryotes and the Euryarchaeota contains the methanogens and extreme halophiles. “Bacteria”, or “eubacteria”, refers to a domain of prokaryotic organisms. Bacteria include at least 11 distinct groups as follows: (1) Gram-positive (gram+) bacteria, of which there are two major subdivisions: (1) high G+C group (Actinomycetes, Mycobacteria, Micrococcus, others) (2) low G+C group (Bacillus, Clostridia, Lactobacillus, Staphylococci, Streptococci, Mycoplasmas); (2) Proteobacteria, e.g., Purple photosynthetic+non-photosynthetic Gram-negative bacteria (includes most “common” Gram-negative bacteria); (3) Cyanobacteria, e.g., oxygenic phototrophs; (4) Spirochetes and related species; (5) Planctomyces; (6) Bacteroides, Flavobacteria; (7) Chlamydia; (8) Green sulfur bacteria; (9) Green non-sulfur bacteria (also anaerobic phototrophs); (10) Radioresistant micrococci and relatives; and (11) Thermotoga and Thermosipho thermophiles. “Gram-negative bacteria” include cocci, nonenteric rods, and enteric rods. The genera of Gram-negative bacteria include, for example, Neisseria, Spirillum, Pasteurella, Brucella, Yersinia, Francisella, Haemophilus, Bordetella, Escherichia, Salmonella, Shigella, Klebsiella, Proteus, Vibrio, Pseudomonas, Bacteroides, Acetobacter, Aerobacter, Agrobacterium, Azotobacter, Spirilla, Serratia, Vibrio, Rhizobium, Chlamydia, Rickettsia, Treponema, and Fusobacterium. “Gram positive bacteria” include cocci, nonsporulating rods, and sporulating rods. The genera of gram positive bacteria include, for example, Actinomyces, Bacillus, Clostridium, Corynebacterium, Erysipelothrix, Lactobacillus, Listeria, Mycobacterium, Myxococcus, Nocardia, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and Streptomyces. The term “recombinant microorganism” and “recombinant host cell” are used interchangeably herein and refer to microorganisms that have been genetically modified to express or over-express endogenous polynucleotides, or to express non-endogenous sequences, such as those included in a vector, or which have a reduction in expression of an endogenous gene. The polynucleotide generally encodes a target enzyme involved in a metabolic pathway for producing a desired metabolite as described above. Accordingly, recombinant microorganisms described herein have been genetically engineered to express or over-express target enzymes not previously expressed or over-expressed by a parental microorganism. It is understood that the terms “recombinant microorganism” and “recombinant host cell” refer not only to the particular recombinant microorganism but to the progeny or potential progeny of such a microorganism. E. coli, Yeast, Corynebacterium, Lactobacillus, Bacillus, and the like, are particularly useful as a host cell. A “parental microorganism” refers to a cell used to generate, or derive, a recombinant microorganism. The term “parental microorganism” describes a cell that occurs in nature, i.e., a “wild-type” cell that has not been genetically modified. The term “parental microorganism” also describes a cell that has been genetically modified but which does not express or over-express a target enzyme, e.g., an enzyme involved in the biosynthetic pathway for the production of a desired metabolite such as 1-propanol, isobutanol, 1-butanol, 2-methyl-1-butanol, 3-methyl-1-butanol, or 2-phenylethanol. For example, a wild-type microorganism can be genetically modified to express or over-express a first target enzyme such as acetolactate synthase. This microorganism can act as a parental microorganism in the generation of a microorganism modified to express or over-express a second target enzyme, e.g., acetohydroxy acid isomeroreductase (IlvC). In turn, the microorganism modified to express or over-express, e.g., acetolactate synthase and acetohydroxy acid isomeroreductase, can be modified to express or over-express a third target enzyme, e.g., dihydroxy-acid dehydratase (IlvD). Accordingly, a parental microorganism, or host microorganism, functions as a reference cell for successive genetic modification events. Each modification event can be accomplished by introducing a nucleic acid molecule into the reference cell. The introduction facilitates the expression or over-expression of a target enzyme. It is understood that the term “facilitates” encompasses the activation of endogenous polynucleotides encoding a target enzyme through genetic modification of, e.g., a promoter sequence in a parental microorganism. It is further understood that the term “facilitates” encompasses the introduction of exogenous polynucleotides encoding a target enzyme into a parental microorganism. In another embodiment, a method of producing a recombinant microorganism that converts a suitable carbon substrate to, e.g., isobutanol, 2-methyl 1-butanol, and/or 3-methyl 1-butanol is provided. The method includes transforming a microorganism with one or more recombinant polynucleotides encoding polypeptides that include, for example, an enzyme having both acetolatate synthase and 2-ketodecarboxylase activity (e.g., als), and a polypeptide having alcohol dehydrogenase activity. Polynucleotides that encode enzymes useful for generating metabolites including homologs, variants, fragments, related fusion proteins, or functional equivalents thereof, are used in recombinant nucleic acid molecules that direct the expression of such polypeptides in appropriate host cells, such as bacterial or yeast cells. It is understood that the addition of sequences which do not alter the encoded activity of a polynucleotide, such as the addition of a nonfunctional or non-coding sequence, is a conservative variation of the basic nucleic acid. The “activity” of an enzyme is a measure of its ability to catalyze a reaction resulting in a metabolite, i.e., to “function”, and may be expressed as the rate at which the metabolite of the reaction is produced. For example, enzyme activity can be represented as the amount of metabolite produced per unit of time or per unit of enzyme (e.g., concentration or weight), or in terms of affinity or dissociation constants. It is understood that the polynucleotides described above include “genes” and that the nucleic acid molecules described above include “vectors” or “plasmids.” For example, a polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide having acetolactate synthase and 2-ketodecarboxylase activity can be encoded by an als gene or homolog thereof. Accordingly, the term “gene”, also called a “structural gene” refers to a polynucleotide that codes for a particular sequence of amino acids, which comprise all or part of one or more proteins or enzymes, and may include regulatory (non-transcribed) DNA sequences, such as promoter sequences, which determine, for example, the conditions under which the gene is expressed. The transcribed region of the gene may include untranslated regions, including introns, 5′-untranslated region (UTR), and 3′-UTR, as well as the coding sequence. The term “nucleic acid” or “recombinant nucleic acid” refers to polynucleotides such as deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), and, where appropriate, ribonucleic acid (RNA). The term “expression” with respect to a gene sequence refers to transcription of the gene and, as appropriate, translation of the resulting mRNA transcript to a protein. Thus, as will be clear from the context, expression of a protein results from transcription and translation of the open reading frame sequence. The term “operon” refers to two or more genes which are transcribed as a single transcriptional unit from a common promoter. In some embodiments, the genes comprising the operon are contiguous genes. It is understood that transcription of an entire operon can be modified (i.e., increased, decreased, or eliminated) by modifying the common promoter. Alternatively, any gene or combination of genes in an operon can be modified to alter the function or activity of the encoded polypeptide. The modification can result in an increase in the activity of the encoded polypeptide. Further, the modification can impart new activities on the encoded polypeptide. Exemplary new activities include the use of alternative substrates and/or the ability to function in alternative environmental conditions. A “vector” is any means by which a nucleic acid can be propagated and/or transferred between organisms, cells, or cellular components. Vectors include viruses, bacteriophages, pro-viruses, plasmids, phagemids, transposons, and artificial chromosomes such as YACs (yeast artificial chromosomes), BACs (bacterial artificial chromosomes), and PLACs (plant artificial chromosomes), and the like, that are “episomes,” that is, that replicate autonomously or can integrate into a chromosome of a host cell. A vector can also be a naked RNA polynucleotide, a naked DNA polynucleotide, a polynucleotide composed of both DNA and RNA within the same strand, a poly-lysine-conjugated DNA or RNA, a peptide-conjugated DNA or RNA, a liposome-conjugated DNA, or the like, that are not episomal in nature, or it can be an organism which comprises one or more of the above polynucleotide constructs such as an agrobacterium or a bacterium. “Transformation” refers to the process by which a vector is introduced into a host cell. Transformation (or transduction, or transfection), can be achieved by any one of a number of means including electroporation, microinjection, biolistics (or particle bombardment-mediated delivery), or agrobacterium mediated transformation. Those of skill in the art will recognize that, due to the degenerate nature of the genetic code, a variety of DNA compounds differing in their nucleotide sequences can be used to encode a given amino acid sequence (e.g., enzyme) of the disclosure. The native DNA sequence encoding the biosynthetic enzymes described herein are referenced herein merely to illustrate an embodiment of the disclosure, and the disclosure includes DNA compounds of any sequence that encode the amino acid sequences of the polypeptides and proteins of the enzymes utilized in the methods of the disclosure. In similar fashion, a polypeptide can typically tolerate one or more amino acid substitutions, deletions, and/or insertions in its amino acid sequence without loss or significant loss of a desired activity. The disclosure includes such polypeptides with different amino acid sequences than the specific proteins described herein so long as the modified or variant polypeptides have the enzymatic anabolic or catabolic activity of the reference polypeptide, and the amino acid sequences encoded by the DNA sequences shown herein merely illustrate embodiments of the disclosure. The disclosure provides nucleic acid molecules in the form of recombinant DNA expression vectors or plasmids, as described in more detail below, that encode one or more target enzymes. Generally, such vectors can either replicate in the cytoplasm of the host microorganism or integrate into the chromosomal DNA of the host microorganism. In either case, the vector can be a stable vector (i.e., the vector remains present over many cell divisions, even if only with selective pressure) or a transient vector (i.e., the vector is gradually lost by host microorganisms with increasing numbers of cell divisions). The disclosure provides DNA molecules in isolated (i.e., not pure, but existing in a preparation in an abundance and/or concentration not found in nature) and purified (i.e., substantially free of contaminating materials or substantially free of materials with which the corresponding DNA would be found in nature) forms. Provided herein are methods for the heterologous expression of one or more of the biosynthetic genes involved in alcohol production (e.g., isobutanol production or biosynthesis and recombinant DNA expression vectors useful in the method. Thus, included within the scope of the disclosure are recombinant expression vectors that include such nucleic acids. The term “expression vector” refers to a nucleic acid that can be introduced into a host microorganism or cell-free transcription and translation system. An expression vector can be maintained permanently or transiently in a microorganism, whether as part of the chromosomal or other DNA in the microorganism or in any cellular compartment, such as a replicating vector in the cytoplasm. An expression vector also comprises a promoter that drives expression of an RNA, which typically is translated into a polypeptide in the microorganism or cell extract. For efficient translation of RNA into protein, the expression vector also typically contains a ribosome-binding site sequence positioned upstream of the start codon of the coding sequence of the gene to be expressed. Other elements, such as enhancers, secretion signal sequences, transcription termination sequences, and one or more marker genes by which host microorganisms containing the vector can be identified and/or selected, may also be present in an expression vector. Selectable markers, i.e., genes that confer antibiotic resistance or sensitivity, are used and confer a selectable phenotype on transformed cells when the cells are grown in an appropriate selective medium. The various components of an expression vector can vary widely, depending on the intended use of the vector and the host cell(s) in which the vector is intended to replicate or drive expression. Expression vector components suitable for the expression of genes and maintenance of vectors in E. coli, yeast, Streptomyces, and other commonly used cells are widely known and commercially available. For example, suitable promoters for inclusion in the expression vectors of the disclosure include those that function in eukaryotic or prokaryotic host microorganisms. Promoters can comprise regulatory sequences that allow for regulation of expression relative to the growth of the host microorganism or that cause the expression of a gene to be turned on or off in response to a chemical or physical stimulus. For E. coli and certain other bacterial host cells, promoters derived from genes for biosynthetic enzymes, antibiotic-resistance conferring enzymes, and phage proteins can be used and include, for example, the galactose, lactose (lac), maltose, tryptophan (trp), beta-lactamase (bla), bacteriophage lambda PL, and T5 promoters. In addition, synthetic promoters, such as the tac promoter (U.S. Pat. No. 4,551,433), can also be used. For E. coli expression vectors, it is useful to include an E. coli origin of replication, such as from pUC, p1P, p1, and pBR. A nucleic acid of the disclosure can be amplified using cDNA, mRNA, or alternatively, genomic DNA, as a template and appropriate oligonucleotide primers according to standard PCR amplification techniques and those procedures described in the Examples section below. The nucleic acid so amplified can be cloned into an appropriate vector and characterized by DNA sequence analysis. Furthermore, oligonucleotides corresponding to nucleotide sequences can be prepared by standard synthetic techniques, e.g., using an automated DNA synthesizer. In another embodiment a method for producing an alcohol, e.g., isobutanol, is provided. The method includes culturing a recombinant microorganism as provided herein in the presence of a suitable substrate and under conditions suitable for the conversion of the substrate to isobutanol. The alcohol produced by a microorganism provided herein can be detected by any method known to the skilled artisan. Such methods include mass spectrometry. Culture conditions suitable for the growth and maintenance of a recombinant microorganism provided herein are described in the Examples below. The skilled artisan will recognize that such conditions can be modified to accommodate the requirements of each microorganism. As previously discussed, general texts which describe molecular biological techniques useful herein, including the use of vectors, promoters and many other relevant topics, include Berger and Kimmel, Guide to Molecular Cloning Techniques, Methods in Enzymology Volume 152, (Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, Calif.)

Improved methods for cloning in vitro amplified nucleic acids are described in Wallace et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,426,039. Improved methods for amplifying large nucleic acids by PCR are summarized in Cheng et al. (1994) Nature 369:684-685 and the references cited therein, in which PCR amplicons of up to 40 kb are generated. One of skill will appreciate that essentially any RNA can be converted into a double stranded DNA suitable for restriction digestion, PCR expansion, and sequencing using reverse transcriptase and a polymerase. See, e.g., Ausubel, Sambrook and Berger, all supra. Appropriate culture conditions are conditions of culture medium pH, ionic strength, nutritive content, and the like; temperature; oxygen/CO2/nitrogen content; humidity; and other culture conditions that permit production of the compound by the host microorganism, i.e., by the metabolic action of the microorganism. Appropriate culture conditions are well known for microorganisms that can serve as host cells.

A shorter fragment was purified and cloned into plasmid pCS27 (Shen and Liao, (2008) Metab. Eng. 10:312-320) cut with the same enzymes, creating pZL8. Both alsS single site mutations (Q487N and Q487A) were introduced using PCR directed mutagenesis. To introduce the mutation into alsS, pSA69 was used as PCR template with A306 and A124 (Q487N) and A307 and A124 (Q487A). The beginning of the alsS gene located on pSA69 was also amplified from the AatII site upstream of the ribosome binding site to the 1,485th base in the alsS gene, using primers A300 and A305. These two fragments were then joined by splice overlap extension (SOE). The products were digested with AatII and SalI and cloned into pSA69 cut with the same enzyme, creating pSA163 and pSA164. For protein over-expression and purification, the wild-type and alsS variants were amplified with primers A297 and A298. PCR products were digested with BamHI and SalI and cloned into pETDuet-1 (Novagen (Madison, Wis.)) cut with the same enzymes (Table 2), creating pS159 and pSA166.

M9 medium (64 g Na2HPO4.7H2O, 15 g KH2PO4, 2.5 g NaCl, 5 g NH4Cl, 2 mM MgSO4, 0.1 mM CaCl2, 10 mg thiamine per liter water) containing 36 g/L glucose, 5 g/L yeast extract, 100 μg/ml ampicillin, 30 μg/ml kanamycin and 1 ml/liter of Trace Metal Mix A5 (2.86 g H3BO3, 1.81 g MnCl2.4H2O, 0.222 g ZnSO4.7H2O, 0.39 g Na2MoO4.2H2O, 0.079 g CuSO4.5H2O, 49.4 mg Co(NO3)2.6H2O per liter water) was used for cell growth. Preculture in test tubes containing 3 ml of medium was performed at 37° C. overnight on a rotary shaker (250 rpm). Overnight culture was diluted 1:100 into 20 ml of fresh medium in a 250 ml screw cap conical flask. Cells were grown at 37° C. for 3 hrs, followed by adding 0.1 mM IPTG (isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside). Production was performed under microaerobic conditions at 30° C. on a rotary shaker (250 rpm) for 24 hrs. Isobutanol was quantified by a gas chromatography-flame ionization detector as previously described (Atsumi et al., (2008) Nature 451:86-89). Secreted pyruvate was quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography as previously described (Atsumi et al., (2008) Metab. Eng. 10:305-311). Protein purification. The wild type AlsS and AlsS variants were synthesized from a His-tag plasmid in E. coli strain BL21 Star™ (DE3) (Invitrogen (Carlsbad, Calif.)) followed by purification with Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) spin columns (Qiagen (Valencia, Calif.)). Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad (Hercules, Calif.)). Als enzyme activity. An enzyme assay for Als activity of AlsS was carried out in 1 ml of morpholinepropanesulfonic acid (MOPS) buffer (pH 7.0) containing 80 nM AlsS, 100 mM MOPS (pH 7.0), 1 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM TPP, 10 mM acetate, and various concentrations of pyruvate at 37° C. for 10 min. The reaction was terminated by acidification of the solution with 0.1 ml of 50% H2SO4. The mixture was incubated for an additional 25 min at 37° C. to allow for the acid hydrolysis of the acetolactate to acetoin. Acetoin formation was measured as described previously (Holtzclaw and Chapman, (1975) J. Bacteriol. 121:917-922). One unit of enzyme activity was defined as the amount of enzyme that converts 1 μmol of substrate into product in 1 minute under these conditions. The Km values for pyruvate and the Vmax were extrapolated after nonlinear regression of the experimental points with the Gauss-Newton method using Matlab. Kdc activity assay. The enzyme assay for Kdc activity of AlsS was carried out in reaction mixtures containing 80 nM AlsS, 100 mM MOPS (pH 7.0), 1 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM TPP, 10 mM acetate, and various concentrations of KIV at 37° C. for 1 h. The production of isobutyraldehyde was confirmed to be linear over 1 h. Isobutyraldehyde was measured by a gas chromatography-flame ionization detector as previously described (Atsumi et al., (2008) Nature 451:86-89). One unit of enzyme activity was defined as the amount of enzyme that converts 1 μmol of substrate into product in 1 minute under these conditions. The Km values for KIV and the Vmax were extrapolated after nonlinear regression of the experimental points with the Gauss-Newton method using Matlab. TABLE 3 Sequences of included sequence listing.

Since E. coli does not have any Kdc, it was hypothesized that pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) or 2-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (KGDH) of E. coli could catalyze the conversion of KIV to isobutyryl coenzyme A, followed by the conversion of isobutyryl coenzyme A to isobutyraldehyde and then isobutanol by aldehyde and alcohol dehydrogenases. To test these possibilities, aceE and sucA were deleted, which encode subunits of the PDH and KGDH complexes, respectively. However, this double knockout strain with over-expression of alsS, ilvC, and ilvD was still capable of producing isobutanol, indicating that neither PDH nor KGDH catalyzes the reaction in the Kdc-independent isobutanol production. To determine essential components for the Kdc-independent isobutanol production, isobutanol production from the strain over-expressing different combinations of alsS, ilvC, and ilvD was measured (FIG. 2). The strain over-expressing alsS alone produced isobutanol, but the strain over-expressing ilvC and ilvD did not (FIG. 2A). When ilvC and ilvD were over-expressed with alsS, isobutanol production increased nearly ninefold (FIG. 2A). Because the only known activity of AlsS is acetolactate synthase, it is unclear how the strain could produce isobutanol only with alsS over-expression. As a control experiment, ilvI and ilvH (E. coli), which encodes an acetohydroxy acid synthase (Ahas) instead of AlsS (B. subtilis), were over-expressed. The strain over-expressing ilvI and ilvH (E. coli) did not produce isobutanol. Increasing AlsS levels in E. coli led to a parallel increase in the formation of acetoin, which is the product of spontaneous decarboxylation of 2-acetolactate (Aristidou et al., (1994) Biotechnol. Bioeng. 44:944-951). To test whether some enzymes in E. coli could utilize acetoin as a substrate for isobutanol production, acetoin was fed to the E. coli culture. Neither isobutyraldehyde nor isobutanol was detected from this culture, indicating that acetoin was not a precursor of isobutanol in this pathway. To confirm that the Kdc-independent pathway used the same route as the Kdc-dependent pathway, the ilvC gene on the genome was deleted (FIG. 2A). The deletion of ilvC abolished isobutanol production, indicating that this Kdc-independent pathway utilized KIV as a precursor (FIG. 2A). KIV was then supplied to the medium to assess the capability to utilize KIV for isobutanol production (FIG. 2B). The strain without AlsS did not produce isobutanol in the presence of 6 g/liter of KIV (FIG. 2B), but addition of KIV to strains over-expressing alsS led to isobutanol production in the wild-type and ΔilvC backgrounds (FIG. 2B). These tests revealed that Kdc-independent isobutanol production requires over-expression of alsS and a high concentration of KIV. Feeding of KIV to the strain over-expressing alsS, ilvC, and ilvD did not change the production of isobutanol (FIG. 2C), presumably because the concentration of KIV may already saturate the enzyme which utilizes KIV for isobutanol production or the efficiency of KIV uptake may decrease (FIG. 2C). Characterization of wild type and AlsS variants. It was hypothesized that AlsS could catalyze the decarboxylation of KIV and give isobutyraldehyde without the nucleophilic attack of the second pyruvate in the presence of a high concentration of KIV and a low concentration of pyruvate. Because the over-expression of alsS, ilvC, and ilvD significantly decreases the secretion of pyruvate to below a detection limit of 0.1 mM (the host strain without these plasmids secretes 7 mM pyruvate), it is possible that under this condition, KIV reacts with TPP and undergoes decarboxylation, and then escapes by giving isobutyraldehyde before undergoing the carboligation. Purification and characterization of wild type and AlsS variants. Using the crystal structure of Klebsiella pneumoniae AlsS, Pang et al., (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279:2242-2253) showed that the extended side chain of Gln483 causes steric hindrance with the larger substrate, 2-ketobutyrate, which explains why AlsS reacts very poorly with a larger 2-keto acid as the second substrate (Gollop et al., (1990) J. Bacteriol. 172:344-3449; Pang et al., (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279:2242-2253). Gln483 in K. pneumoniae AlsS has been shown to be in close proximity to the first pyruvate and also involved in second-substrate specificity (Pang et al., (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279:2242-2253), suggesting that Gln483 may play a role in the release of aldehydes (see FIG. 3A). The residue corresponding to Gln483 in K. pneumoniae AlsS is Gln487 in B. subtilis AlsS. To test whether Gln487 could play a role in decarboxylation, Gln487 was replaced with various other amino acids. For example, Gln487 was replaced with Asn and Ala. The side-chain of Asn has an amine group like Gln but it is shorter than that of Gln. The side-chain of Ala is shorter than that of Gln but does not contain an amine group. These AlsS mutants were over-expressed with INC and IlvD. Isobutanol production with AlsS (Q487N) and AlsS (Q487A) decreased by 25% and 90%, respectively (FIG. 3B). The replacement of Q487 with alanine nearly abolished isobutanol production, indicating that this residue is important for either acetolactate synthase or 2-ketoisovalerate decarboxylase activity. To test which reactions were affected by these mutations, KDC was over-expressed (FIG. 3C). With over-expression of KDC, all strains produced similar levels of isobutanol (FIG. 3C), indicating the replacement of Q487 only affected the decarboxylase activity. Purification and characterization of wild type and AlsS variants. To assay the Kdc activity (FIG. 1C, bottom) of AlsS, His-tagged wild-type AlsS was expressed from a His-tag plasmid and purified as described above. The Kdc activity of the His-tagged wild-type AlsS was 5.5 μmol·min−1·mg−1, while isobutyraldehyde production was not detected from a negative control experiment without AlsS. Although the activity was weak, AlsS showed the decarboxylase activity toward KIV in vitro. The kinetic parameters were measured for AlsS variants (Table 2). The kcat/Km values for pyruvate of Q487 variants with small residues (Q487A, Q487G, and Q487S) were similar to that of the wild type, while the kcat/Km values for KIV of these variants decreased dramatically (Table 2). Q487L and Q487I replacements impaired Als activity (Table 2). However, the kcat/Km values for KIV of these variants were similar to that of the wild type. The wild type and all variants showed extremely high Km values for KIV (Table 2), which may explain why an increase of the flux toward KIV is required for the decarboxylase activity of AlsS. Effects of Q487 replacements for isobutanol production. To test these AlsS variants' capability to produce isobutanol, which requires both Als (FIG. 1C, top) and Kdc (FIG. 1C, bottom) activities, these alsS variants were over-expressed with ilvC and ilvD. Isobutanol production with AlsS (Q487N) was similar to the production achieved using wild-type AlsS (FIG. 4A), presumably because the side chain of Asn has an amine group, like Gln. However, the replacement of Q487 with valine, alanine, glycine, serine, leucine, and isoleucine nearly abolished isobutanol production (FIG. 4A). According to the results of the performed enzyme assays (Table 2), the replacement of Q487 with glycine and serine maintained Als activity and decreased Kdc activity. The ratios of Km for KIV to Km for pyruvate of Q487G and Q487S were 109±30 and 140±79, respectively, while the ratio for the wild-type enzyme was 20±2.9. The strains with either Q487G or Q487S cannot produce isobutanol, presumably because the Kdc activity of Q487G and Q487S could not compete with the Als activity. Enzyme assays showed that Q487L and Q487I replacements impaired Als activity. Increased flux toward KIV was found to be important for isobutanol production when using AlsS for Kdc activity (FIGS. 2A and 2B), but the Km values for KIV of Q487L and Q487I were 342±45 mM and 323±26 mM, respectively (Table 2), which were extremely high. Because these Km values are extremely high, the strains with these replacements could not produce isobutanol, presumably because the intracellular concentration of KIV would not be high enough for the Kdc activity. No replacements were found that could increase isobutanol production. Effects of Q487 replacements for Als activity. To distinguish between Als and Kdc activities in these variants, the growth rate of an E. coli strain KS145 (ΔilvI ΔilvB) expressing various Q487 variants was tested in a minimum glucose medium supplemented with L-isoleucine. AlsS is a distant homologue of Ahas, which is responsible for both Als (FIG. 1C, top) and 2-aceto-2-hydroxy butyrate synthase (Ahbs) (FIG. 1C, middle) activities in the branched chain amino acid biosynthesis. The KS145 strain does not have Als and Ahbs activities (FIG. 1C); thus, the specific growth rate in the minimal medium with L-isoleucine reflects the Als activity. FIG. 4B shows that all of the Q487 variants retain significant Als activity. Considering that most of the Q487 variants did not generate isobutanol (FIG. 4A), it was concluded that AlsS is indeed responsible for the Kdc activity observed in isobutanol synthesis, and that Q487 is important for this activity. KS145 cells expressing Q487L or Q487I showed slow growth with the L-isoleucine supplement (FIG. 4B), indicating that these replacements would reduce Als activity. These results were consistent with the results of enzyme assays (Table 2). In the structure model of K. pneumoniae AlsS, the C-1 carbonyl oxygen of the modeled second pyruvate is hydrogen-bonded to the side chain of Gln483 (Pang et al., (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279:2242-2253). Thus, the nonpolar side chain of isoleucine and leucine in the 487th residue would reduce the binding affinity of the second pyruvate to the site. No growth phenotype was observed in any strain while grown on minimum glucose medium supplemented with L-valine, L-leucine, and L-isoleucine. Effects of Q487 replacements for Ahbs activity. AlsS reacts very poorly with the larger substrate, 2-ketobutyrate (Gollop et al., (1990) J. Bacteriol. 172:3444-3449). If these replacements change the second substrate specificity by removing steric hindrance, the AlsS variants would gain the Ahbs activity so that the KS145 cells expressing the variants could grow in minimal medium with L-valine and L-leucine supplementation. As predicted, KS145 cells expressing the wild-type AlsS were unable to grow without L-isoleucine (FIG. 4C), indicating that the wild-type AlsS was not capable of catalyzing Ahbs reaction, which is consistent with previous studies (Huseby and Stormer, (1971) Eur. J. Biochem. 20:215-217). Interestingly, the AlsS variants which contain small residues (Ala, Gly, and Ser) at the 487th residue rescued the growth of KS145 under the same conditions (FIG. 4C). This result suggests that the replacement of Q487 with small side chain amino acids would make the substrate binding site larger so that the variants are able to react with 2-ketobutyrate as the second substrate (Ahbs activity) (FIG. 1C, middle). The foregoing evidence shows that Kdc is not essential for isobutanol production and that AlsS, previously known only to have Als activity, can catalyze the decarboxylation of KIV. The use of mutational studies allowed the inventors to identify that Q487 is important for Kdc activity. The disclosure also demonstrates that AlsS is able to function as a KDC to release aldehydes after decarboxylation. KDC requires only one substrate binding event and one catalytic reaction, while ALS requires two substrate binding events and two catalytic reactions (decarboxylation and ligation using the second substrate). Since KDC is simpler than ALS, KDC may have arisen earlier than ALS.
