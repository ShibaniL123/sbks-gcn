This application is a national stage application of PCT/CN2012/075575 filed on May 16, 2012, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. BACKGROUND The present disclosure relates generally to polycarbonate compositions that have good flow properties, high impact properties, and good aesthetic values. Also disclosed herein are methods for preparing and/or using the same. Polycarbonates (PC) are synthetic engineering thermoplastic resins derived from bisphenols and phosgene, or their derivatives. They are linear polyesters of carbonic acid and can be formed from dihydroxy compounds and carbonate diesters or carbonyl halides, or by ester interchange. Polycarbonates are a useful class of polymers having many beneficial properties. The consumer electronics market has grown significantly in recent years. Recent designs aim for slimness, with thinner walls and with wide and large display panels. Known compositions used for such mobile devices (e.g. mobile phones) may exhibit brittleness and/or cracking, unsightly surfaces, and/or poor flowability. Due to various “critical to quality” requirements of customers, there is a need for polycarbonate compositions that have good flow properties, aesthetic properties, and impact properties combined with stiffness.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION The present disclosure may be understood more readily by reference to the following detailed description of desired embodiments and the examples included therein. In the following specification and the claims which follow, reference will be made to a number of terms which shall be defined to have the following meanings. The singular forms “a,” “an,” and “the” include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. As used in the specification and in the claims, the term “comprising” may include the embodiments “consisting of” and “consisting essentially of.” Numerical values in the specification and claims of this application, particularly as they relate to polymers or polymer compositions, reflect average values for a composition that may contain individual polymers of different characteristics. Furthermore, unless indicated to the contrary, the numerical values should be understood to include numerical values which are the same when reduced to the same number of significant figures and numerical values which differ from the stated value by less than the experimental error of conventional measurement technique of the type described in the present application to determine the value. All ranges disclosed herein are inclusive of the recited endpoint and independently combinable (for example, the range of “from 2 grams to 10 grams” is inclusive of the endpoints, 2 grams and 10 grams, and all the intermediate values). The endpoints of the ranges and any values disclosed herein are not limited to the precise range or value; they are sufficiently imprecise to include values approximating these ranges and/or values. As used herein, approximating language may be applied to modify any quantitative representation that may vary without resulting in a change in the basic function to which it is related. Accordingly, a value modified by a term or terms, such as “about” and “substantially,” may not be limited to the precise value specified, in some cases. In at least some instances, the approximating language may correspond to the precision of an instrument for measuring the value. The modifier “about” should also be considered as disclosing the range defined by the absolute values of the two endpoints. For example, the expression “from about 2 to about 4” also discloses the range “from 2 to 4.” Compounds are described using standard nomenclature. For example, any position not substituted by any indicated group is understood to have its valency filled by a bond as indicated, or a hydrogen atom. A dash (“-”) that is not between two letters or symbols is used to indicate a point of attachment for a substituent. For example, the aldehyde group —CHO is attached through the carbon of the carbonyl group. The term “aliphatic” refers to a linear or branched array of atoms that is not cyclic and has a valence of at least one. Aliphatic groups are defined to comprise at least one carbon atom. The array of atoms may include heteroatoms such as nitrogen, sulfur, silicon, selenium, and oxygen in the backbone or may be composed exclusively of carbon and hydrogen. Aliphatic groups may be substituted or unsubstituted. Exemplary aliphatic groups include, but are not limited to, methyl, ethyl, isopropyl, isobutyl, hydroxymethyl (—CH2OH), mercaptomethyl (—CH2SH), methoxy, methoxycarbonyl (CH3OCO—), nitromethyl (—CH2NO2), and thiocarbonyl. The term “alkyl” refers to a linear or branched array of atoms that is composed exclusively of carbon and hydrogen. The array of atoms may include single bonds, double bonds, or triple bonds (typically referred to as alkane, alkene, or alkyne). Alkyl groups may be substituted (i.e. one or more hydrogen atoms is replaced) or unsubstituted. Exemplary alkyl groups include, but are not limited to, methyl, ethyl, and isopropyl. It should be noted that alkyl is a subset of aliphatic. The term “aromatic” refers to an array of atoms having a valence of at least one and comprising at least one aromatic group. The array of atoms may include heteroatoms such as nitrogen, sulfur, selenium, silicon, and oxygen, or may be composed exclusively of carbon and hydrogen. Aromatic groups may be substituted or unsubstituted. Exemplary aromatic groups include, but are not limited to, phenyl, pyridyl, furanyl, thienyl, naphthyl, and biphenyl. The term “aryl” refers to an aromatic radical composed entirely of carbon atoms and hydrogen atoms. When aryl is described in connection with a numerical range of carbon atoms, it should not be construed as including substituted aromatic radicals. For example, the phrase “aryl containing from 6 to 10 carbon atoms” should be construed as referring to a phenyl group (6 carbon atoms) or a naphthyl group (10 carbon atoms) only, and should not be construed as including a methylphenyl group (7 carbon atoms). It should be noted that aryl is a subset of aromatic. The term “cycloaliphatic” refers to an array of atoms which is cyclic but which is not aromatic. The cycloaliphatic group may include heteroatoms such as nitrogen, sulfur, selenium, silicon, and oxygen in the ring, or may be composed exclusively of carbon and hydrogen. A cycloaliphatic group may comprise one or more noncyclic components. For example, a cyclohexylmethyl group (C6H11CH2—) is a cycloaliphatic functionality, which comprises a cyclohexyl ring (the array of atoms which is cyclic but which is not aromatic) and a methylene group (the noncyclic component). Cycloaliphatic groups may be substituted or unsubstituted. Exemplary cycloaliphatic groups include, but are not limited to, cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, 1,1,4,4-tetramethylcyclobutyl, piperidinyl, and 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinyl. The term “cycloalkyl” refers to an array of atoms which is cyclic but is not aromatic, and which is composed exclusively of carbon and hydrogen. Cycloalkyl groups may be substituted or unsubstituted. It should be noted that cycloalkyl is a subset of cycloaliphatic. In the definitions above, the term “substituted” refers to at least one hydrogen atom on the named radical being substituted with another functional group, such as alkyl, halogen, —OH, —CN, —NO2, —COOH, etc. For thin yet large part designs of mobile devices, a high-modulus material is needed to both support the body and the display panel. The high flexural modulus reflects stiffness, or in other words that the molded part will maintain its shape. High ductility and good flow properties reflect how easily the polymeric composition can be poured into a mold for forming the shape of the part. Higher stiffness can be obtained by the addition of a mineral filler to a polymeric composition. However, the addition of mineral filler reduces the ductility and the flow properties of the polymeric composition. Even highly impact resistant polymers, such as polycarbonates, become brittle at room temperature at high filler loadings. Another conventional way of increasing stiffness is by increasing the weight average molecular weight of the polymer, but this typically also reduces the flow properties and makes it difficult to fill complex or thin-walled molds. Another concern is related to aesthetics; molded parts with mineral filler protruding from the surface are unsightly. Good flow properties can also aid in manufacturing by reducing in-mold stress which can lead to cracking. Cracking of the molded parts reduces the overall yield rate of production. The present disclosure generally relates to polycarbonate compositions which exhibit a balance of good flow properties, good aesthetic properties, and good impact properties. The polycarbonate compositions comprise (A) at least one poly(aliphatic ester)-polycarbonate copolymer, (B) a polysiloxane-polycarbonate copolymer, and (C) glass fibers. The synergistic combination of these ingredients provides excellent impact ductility and surface aesthetics. As used herein, the terms “polycarbonate” and “polycarbonate polymer” mean compositions having repeating structural carbonate units of the formula (1): in which at least about 60 percent of the total number of R1 groups are aromatic organic radicals and the balance thereof are aliphatic, alicyclic, or aromatic radicals. An ester unit (—COO—) is not considered a carbonate unit, and a carbonate unit is not considered an ester unit. In one embodiment, each R1 is an aromatic organic radical, for example a radical of the formula (2): [in-line-formulae]-A1-Y1-A2- (2)[/in-line-formulae] wherein each of A1 and A2 is a monocyclic divalent aryl radical and Y1 is a bridging radical having one or two atoms that separate A1 from A2. In an exemplary embodiment, one atom separates A1 from A2. Illustrative non-limiting examples of radicals of this type are —O—, —S—, —S(O)—, —S(O)2—, —C(O)—, methylene, cyclohexyl-methylene, 2-[2.2.1]-bicycloheptylidene, ethylidene, isopropylidene, neopentylidene, cyclohexylidene, cyclopentadecylidene, cyclododecylidene, and adamantylidene. The bridging radical Y1 may be a hydrocarbon group or a saturated hydrocarbon group such as methylene, cyclohexylidene, or isopropylidene. Polycarbonates may be produced by the interfacial reaction of dihydroxy compounds having the formula HO—R1—OH, wherein R1 is as defined above. Dihydroxy compounds suitable in an interfacial reaction include the dihydroxy compounds of formula (A) as well as dihydroxy compounds of formula (3) [in-line-formulae]HO-A1-Y1-A2-OH (3)[/in-line-formulae] wherein Y′, A1 and A2 are as described above. Also included are bisphenol compounds of general formula (4): wherein Ra and Rb each represent a halogen atom or a monovalent hydrocarbon group and may be the same or different; p and q are each independently integers of 0 to 4; and Xa represents one of the groups of formula (5): wherein Rc and Rd each independently represent a hydrogen atom or a monovalent linear or cyclic hydrocarbon group and Re is a divalent hydrocarbon group.

Combinations comprising at least one of the foregoing dihydroxy compounds may also be used. Other useful dihydroxy compounds include aromatic dihydroxy compounds of formula (6): wherein each Rk is independently a C1-10 hydrocarbon group, and n is 0 to 4. The halogen is usually bromine. Examples of compounds that may be represented by the formula (6) include resorcinol, substituted resorcinol compounds such as 5-methyl resorcinol, 5-phenyl resorcinol, 5-cumyl resorcinol, or the like; catechol; hydroquinone; substituted hydroquinones such as 2-methyl hydroquinone, 2-t-butyl hydroquinone, 2-phenyl hydroquinone, 2-cumyl hydroquinone, 2,3,5,6-tetramethyl hydroquinone, or the like; or combinations comprising at least one of the foregoing compounds.

The polycarbonate compositions of the present disclosure contain at least two polycarbonate copolymers. First, the polycarbonate compositions of the present disclosure contain at least one poly(aliphatic ester)-polycarbonate copolymer (A). The poly(aliphatic ester)-polycarbonate copolymer is made up of a combination of carbonate units and aliphatic ester units. The molar ratio of ester units to carbonate units can vary widely, for example from 1:99 to 99:1, or more specifically from 25:75 to 75:25, depending on the desired properties of the final compositions. In embodiments, the ester unit may have the structure of Formula (II): wherein m is from about 4 to about 18. In some embodiments, m is from about 8 to about 10. The ester units may be derived from a C6-C20 aliphatic dicarboxylic acid (which includes the terminal carboxylate groups) or a reactive derivative thereof, including a C8-C12aliphatic dicarboxylic acid. In some embodiments, the terminal carboxylate groups are derived from the corresponding dicarboxylic acid or reactive derivative thereof, such as the acid halide (specifically, the acid chloride), an ester, or the like.

Each R may be independently derived from a dihydroxy compound. In a specific exemplary embodiment, a useful poly(aliphatic ester)-polycarbonate copolymer comprises sebacic acid ester units and bisphenol A carbonate units (Formula (II), where m is 8, and the average molar ratio of x:y is 6:94). Such poly(aliphatic ester)-polycarbonate copolymers are commercially available as LEXAN HFD copolymers (LEXAN is a trademark of SABIC Innovative Plastics IP B. V.). In some embodiments, the poly(aliphatic ester) polycarbonate copolymer may have a weight average molecular weight of from about 15,000 to about 40,000, including from about 20,000 to about 38,000 (measured by GPC based on BPA polycarbonate standards). The polycarbonate compositions of the present disclosure may include from about 30 wt % to about 85 wt % of the poly(aliphatic ester)-polycarbonate copolymer. In some embodiments of the present disclosure, the polycarbonate composition includes two poly(aliphatic ester)-polycarbonate copolymers, i.e. a first poly(aliphatic ester)-polycarbonate copolymer (A1) and a second poly(aliphatic ester)-polycarbonate copolymer (A2). The two poly(aliphatic ester)-polycarbonate copolymers may have the same or different ester unit and the same or different carbonate unit. The second poly(aliphatic ester)-polycarbonate copolymer has a greater weight average molecular weight than the first poly(aliphatic ester)-polycarbonate copolymer. The first poly(aliphatic ester)-polycarbonate copolymer may have a weight average molecular weight of from about 15,000 to about 25,000, including from about 20,000 to about 22,000 (measured by GPC based on BPA polycarbonate standards). Referring to Formula (III), the first poly(aliphatic ester)-polycarbonate copolymer may have an average molar percentage ratio x:y of from about 4:96 to about 7:93. The second poly(aliphatic ester)-polycarbonate copolymer may have a weight average molecular weight of 30,000 to about 40,000, including from about 35,000 to about 38,000 (measured by GPC based on BPA polycarbonate standards). Referring to Formula (III), the second poly(aliphatic ester)-polycarbonate copolymer may have an average molar percentage ratio x:y of from about 7:93 to about 13:87. In embodiments, the weight ratio of the first poly(aliphatic ester)-polycarbonate copolymer to the second poly(aliphatic ester)-polycarbonate copolymer may be at least 1:1, and in further embodiments is at least 2:1, at least 3:1, or at least 4:1. In some embodiments, the weight ratio is from about 3:2 to about 15:1 (i.e. from about 1.5 to about 15). Note the weight ratio described here is the ratio of the amounts of the two copolymers in the composition, not the ratio of the molecular weights of the two copolymers. The weight ratio between the two poly(aliphatic ester)-polycarbonate copolymers will affect the flow properties, ductility, and surface aesthetics of the final composition. The compositions may include from about 55 to about 85 wt % of the first poly(aliphatic ester)-polycarbonate copolymer (i.e. the lower Mw copolymer) and the second poly(aliphatic ester)-polycarbonate copolymer (i.e. the higher Mw copolymer) combined. The composition may contain from about 15 to about 75 wt % of the first poly(aliphatic ester)-polycarbonate copolymer. The composition may contain from about 5 to about 50 wt % of the second poly(aliphatic ester)-polycarbonate copolymer. In specific embodiments, the composition contains from about 35 to about 75 wt % of the first poly(aliphatic ester)-polycarbonate copolymer and from about 5 to about 30 wt % of the second poly(aliphatic ester)-polycarbonate copolymer. The polycarbonate compositions of the present disclosure also contain a polysiloxane-polycarbonate copolymer (B). This copolymer comprises polycarbonate blocks and polydiorganosiloxane blocks. The polycarbonate blocks in the copolymer comprise repeating structural units of formula (1) as described above, for example wherein R1 is of formula (2) as described above. These units may be derived from reaction of dihydroxy compounds of formula (3) as described above. The polydiorganosiloxane blocks comprise repeating structural units of formula (7) (sometimes referred to herein as ‘siloxane’): wherein each occurrence of R is same or different, and is a C1-13 monovalent organic radical. For example, R may be a C1-C13 alkyl group, C1-C13 alkoxy group, C2-C13 alkenyl group, C2-C13 alkenyloxy group, C3-C6 cycloalkyl group, C3-C6 cycloalkoxy group, C6-C10 aryl group, C6-C10 aryloxy group, C7-C13 aralkyl group, C7-C13 aralkoxy group, C7-C13 alkaryl group, or C7-C13 alkaryloxy group. Combinations of the foregoing R groups may be used in the same copolymer. Generally, D may have an average value of 2 to about 1000, specifically about 2 to about 500, more specifically about 30 to about 100, or from about 35 to about 55. Where D is of a lower value, e.g., less than about 40, it may be desirable to use a relatively larger amount of the polycarbonate-polysiloxane copolymer. Conversely, where D is of a higher value, e.g., greater than about 40, it may be necessary to use a relatively lower amount of the polycarbonate-polysiloxane copolymer. D may be referred to as the siloxane block chain length. In one embodiment, the polydiorganosiloxane blocks are provided by repeating structural units of formula (8): wherein D is as defined above; each R may be the same or different, and is as defined above; and Ar may be the same or different, and is a substituted or unsubstituted C6-C30 arylene radical, wherein the bonds are directly connected to an aromatic moiety. Suitable Ar groups in formula (8) may be derived from a C6-C30 dihydroxyarylene compound, for example a dihydroxyarylene compound of formula (3), (4), or (6) above. Combinations comprising at least one of the foregoing dihydroxyarylene compounds may also be used. Such units may be derived from the corresponding dihydroxy compound of the following formula (9): wherein Ar and D are as described above. Compounds of this formula may be obtained by the reaction of a dihydroxyarylene compound with, for example, an alpha, omega-bisacetoxypolydiorangonosiloxane under phase transfer conditions. In another embodiment the polydiorganosiloxane blocks comprise repeating structural units of formula (10): wherein R and D are as defined above. R2 in formula (10) is a divalent C2-C8 aliphatic group. Each M in formula (10) may be the same or different, and may be cyano, nitro, C1-C8 alkylthio, C1-C8 alkyl, C1-C8 alkoxy, C2-C8 alkenyl, C2-C8 alkenyloxy group, C3-C8 cycloalkyl, C3-C8 cycloalkoxy, C6-C10 aryl, C6-C10 aryloxy, C7-C12 aralkyl, C7-C12 aralkoxy, C7-C12 alkaryl, or C7-C12 alkaryloxy, wherein each n is independently 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. In one embodiment, M is an alkyl group such as methyl, ethyl, or propyl, an alkoxy group such as methoxy, ethoxy, or propoxy, or an aryl group such as phenyl, or tolyl; R2 is a dimethylene, trimethylene or tetramethylene group; and R is a C1-8 alkyl, haloalkyl such as trifluoropropyl, cyanoalkyl, or aryl such as phenyl or tolyl. In another embodiment, R is methyl, or a mixture of methyl and phenyl. In still another embodiment, M is methoxy, n is one, R2 is a divalent C1-C3 aliphatic group, and R is methyl. These units may be derived from the corresponding dihydroxy polydiorganosiloxane (11): wherein R, D, M, R2, and n are as described above. Such dihydroxy polysiloxanes can be made by effecting a platinum catalyzed addition between a siloxane hydride of the formula (12), wherein R and D are as previously defined, and an aliphatically unsaturated monohydric phenol. Suitable aliphatically unsaturated monohydric phenols included, for example, eugenol, 2-allylphenol, 4-allylphenol, 4-allyl-2-methylphenol, 4-allyl-2-phenylphenol, 4-allyl-2-t-butoxyphenol, 4-phenyl-2-phenylphenol, 2-methyl-4-propylphenol, 2-allyl-4,6-dimethylphenol, 2-allyl-6-methoxy-4-methylphenol and 2-allyl-4,6-dimethylphenol. Mixtures comprising at least one of the foregoing may also be used. In specific embodiments, where Ar of formula (8) is derived from resorcinol, the polydiorganosiloxane repeating units are derived from polysiloxane bisphenols of formula (13): or, where Ar is derived from bisphenol A, from polysiloxane bisphenols of formula (14): wherein D is as defined above. In other specific embodiments, the polysiloxane units are derived from a polysiloxane bisphenol of formula (15): wherein D is as described in formula (7). In yet other specific embodiments, the polysiloxane units are derived from polysiloxane bisphenol of formula (16): wherein D is as described in formula (7). The siloxane blocks may make up from greater than zero to about 25 wt % of the polysiloxane-polycarbonate copolymer, including from 4 wt % to about 25 wt %, from about 4 wt % to about 10 wt %, or from about 15 wt % to about 25 wt %. The polycarbonate blocks may make up from about 75 wt % to less than 100 wt % of the block copolymer, including from about 75 wt % to about 85 wt %. It is specifically contemplated that the polysiloxane-polycarbonate copolymer is a diblock copolymer. The polysiloxane-polycarbonate copolymer may have a weight average molecular weight of from about 28,000 to about 32,000. The polycarbonate compositions of the present disclosure may include from greater than 0 to about 30 wt % of the polysiloxane-polycarbonate copolymer, including from about 5 wt % to about 25 wt % and from about 9 wt % to about 20 wt %. In particular embodiments, the composition comprises from about 0.5 wt % to about 6 wt % of siloxane originating from the polysiloxane-polycarbonate copolymer. However, the amount (by weight) of polysiloxane-polycarbonate copolymer is less than the amount of poly(aliphatic ester)-polycarbonate copolymer (A), usually by at least 10 wt % or by at least 20 wt % of the composition. Alternatively, the amount of polysiloxane-polycarbonate copolymer can be defined by the total siloxane block content that it contributes to the overall polycarbonate composition. In embodiments, the composition may have a siloxane block content of from about 0.5 wt % to about 5 wt % based on the total weight of the composition, including from about 0.9 wt % to about 4.0 wt %, or from about 2.0 wt % to about 3.0 wt %. Exemplary commercially available polysiloxane-polycarbonate copolymers are sold under the mark LEXAN® EXL by SABIC Innovative Plastics IP B. V. The poly(aliphatic ester)-polycarbonate copolymer (A) may contain additional monomers if desired. Similarly, the polysiloxane-polycarbonate copolymer (B) may contain additional monomers if desired. These polycarbonate copolymers can be manufactured by processes known in the art, such as interfacial polymerization and melt polymerization. Although the reaction conditions for interfacial polymerization may vary, an exemplary process generally involves dissolving or dispersing a dihydric phenol reactant in aqueous caustic soda or potash, adding the resulting mixture to a suitable water-immiscible solvent medium, and contacting the reactants with a carbonate precursor in the presence of a suitable catalyst such as triethylamine or a phase transfer catalyst, under controlled pH conditions, e.g., about 8 to about 10. Generally, in the melt polymerization process, polycarbonates may be prepared by co-reacting, in a molten state, the dihydroxy reactant(s) and a diaryl carbonate ester, such as diphenyl carbonate, in the presence of a transesterification catalyst in a Banbury® mixer, twin screw extruder, or the like to form a uniform dispersion. Volatile monohydric phenol is removed from the molten reactants by distillation and the polymer is isolated as a molten residue. The polycarbonate compositions of the present disclosure also comprise glass fibers (C). The term “glass” here refers generally to a material, natural or synthetic, which contains silicon dioxide (SiO2) or silica as its main material. The glass fibers may be textile glass fibers such as E, A, C, ECR, R, S, D, and/or NE glass fibers, and are desirably E type glass fibers. The glass fibers may have an average length of from about 2 mm to about 5 mm, including from about 2 mm to about 4 mm. The glass fibers may have an average diameter of from about 12 microns to about 15.5 microns, including from about 12 microns to about 14 microns. The glass fibers may be present in the compositions of the present disclosure in amounts of from about 5 to about 35 wt %. In some embodiments, the compositions comprise from about 10 to about 30 wt % of the glass fibers, including from about 10 wt % to about 20 wt %. The glass fibers can also be optionally coated with coatings such as an epoxy coating, polyvinyl acetate, particular polyester resins, starch, acrylic resins, melamine, polyvinyl chloride, polyethylene oxide, polyurethane, polyepoxide, or polyvinyl alcohol, or a silane coupling agent, to change the bonding properties between the glass fibers and the other polymeric ingredients in the polycarbonate composition. The glass fibers can be either bonding or non-bonding glass fibers. The polycarbonate composition may, in some embodiments, further comprise an impact modifier (D). The impact modifier may include an elastomer-modified graft copolymer comprising (i) an elastomeric (i.e., rubbery) polymer substrate having a glass transition temperature (Tg) less than about 10° C., more specifically less than about −10° C., or more specifically about −40° C. to −80° C., and (ii) a rigid polymeric superstrate grafted to the elastomeric polymer substrate. As is known, elastomer-modified graft copolymers may be prepared by first providing the elastomeric polymer, then polymerizing the constituent monomer(s) of the rigid phase in the presence of the elastomer to obtain the graft copolymer. The grafts may be attached as graft branches or as shells to an elastomer core. The shell may merely physically encapsulate the core, or the shell may be partially or essentially completely grafted to the core. Suitable materials for use as the elastomer phase include, for example, conjugated diene rubbers; copolymers of a conjugated diene with less than about 50 wt % of a copolymerizable monomer; olefin rubbers such as ethylene propylene copolymers (EPR) or ethylene-propylene-diene monomer rubbers (EPDM); ethylene-vinyl acetate rubbers; silicone rubbers; elastomeric C1-8 alkyl(meth)acrylates; elastomeric copolymers of C1-8 alkyl(meth)acrylates with butadiene and/or styrene; or combinations comprising at least one of the foregoing elastomers. As used herein, the terminology “(meth)acrylate monomers” refers collectively to acrylate monomers and methacrylate monomers. A specific impact modifier of this type is a methyl methacrylate-butadiene-styrene (MBS) impact modifier wherein the butadiene substrate is prepared using above-described sulfonates, sulfates, or phosphates as surfactants. Other exemplary elastomer-modified graft copolymers include acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS), acrylonitrile-styrene-butyl acrylate (ASA), methyl methacrylate-acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (MABS), and acrylonitrile-ethylene-propylene-diene-styrene (AES). In some embodiments, the impact modifier is a graft polymer having a high rubber content, i.e., greater than or equal to about 50 wt %, optionally greater than or equal to about 60 wt % by weight of the graft polymer. The rubber is desirably present in an amount less than or equal to about 95 wt %, optionally less than or equal to about 90 wt % of the graft polymer. A mixture of grafting monomers may also be used, to provide a graft copolymer. An example of a suitable mixture comprises a monovinylaromatic hydrocarbon and an acrylic monomer. Examples of graft copolymers suitable for use include, but are not limited to, acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) and methacrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (MBS) resins. Suitable high-rubber acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene resins are available from SABIC Innovative Plastics (formerly General Electric Company) as BLENDEX® grades 131, 336, 338, 360, and 415. In this regard, the polycarbonate composition may have a softblock content of less than 3.5 wt % of the overall composition. In this regard, the softblock content refers to the portion of a polymer or a composition that is formed from elastomeric material. It is believed that the softblock content is proportional to the impact performance of the overall composition. For example, in a polysiloxane-polycarbonate copolymer, the siloxane blocks may be considered to contribute to the softblock content of the composition because of their elastomeric quality, in contrast to the rigid quality of the polycarbonate blocks. In embodiments, the polycarbonate composition comprises from about 50 wt % to about 90 wt % of the poly(aliphatic ester)-polycarbonate copolymer (A); from about 2 wt % to about 25 wt % of the polysiloxane-polycarbonate copolymer (B); and from about 5 wt % to about 35 wt % of the glass fibers (C). When present, the impact modifier (D) may be present in the amount of from about 2 wt % to about 8 wt %. These values are based on the total weight of the composition. It should be noted that the at least one poly(aliphatic ester)-polycarbonate copolymer (A) may be a blend of two or more polycarbonate copolymers having different weight average molecular weights, and the recited about 50 wt % to about 90 wt % refers to the total amount of such polycarbonate copolymers (A) in the composition. In additional embodiments, the polycarbonate composition comprises from about 35 wt % to about 75 wt % of the poly(aliphatic ester)-polycarbonate copolymer (A1) having a Mw of from about 15,000 to about 25,000; from about 5 wt % to about 30 wt % of the poly(aliphatic ester)-polycarbonate copolymer (A2) having a Mw of from about 30,000 to about 40,000; from about 9 wt % to about 20 wt % of the polysiloxane-polycarbonate copolymer (B); and from about 10 wt % to about 20 wt % of the glass fibers (C); wherein the weight ratio of copolymer (A1) to copolymer (A2) is from about 3:2 to about 15:1.

A lower ratio of low MW to high MW, however, decreased the MVR about 28% and increased the NH about 33%. Next, comparing examples C3, E1, and E3, increasing the polysiloxane-polycarbonate copolymer content (PC-Si) decreased the MVR but increased the NII. Again, the flexural modulus was not significantly affected. Example E2 shows the effect of combining a second impact modifier (MBS) with the polysiloxane-polycarbonate copolymer. The properties of E2 and E3 are very similar, but E3 achieves the properties with a lower softblock content. In this regard, the softblock content is believed to provide the impact performance, and so obtaining the same performance with a lower softblock content is somewhat surprising. Examples E1 and E2 reflect a particularly good balance of properties. Next, Comparative Examples C4-C9 completely replace the PC-Si with different impact modifiers. Using the polysiloxane-polycarbonate copolymer (E1, E3) achieves similar impact modification in comparison to these examples, but with a lower softblock content. Examples E10-E13 Some examples were made to compare the results when 20 wt % of glass fibers was used instead of 10 wt %. Comparative Examples C10, C11 and Examples E10-E13 are described in Table 5 below: TABLE 5 Ingredient Unit E10 E11 E12 E13 C10 C11 PAEBPAlow wt % 54 58 36 36 0 0 PAEBPAhigh wt % 26 24 24 28 0 0 PClow wt % 0 0 0 0 20 38 PChigh wt % 0 0 0 0 42.5 36 PC-Si wt % 10 5 20 10 17.5 0 MBS wt % 0 3 0 6 0 0 S2001 wt % 0 0 0 0 0 6 Glass fibers wt % 10 10 20 20 20 20 CB phr 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.3 Softblock PC-Si wt % 1.7 0.8 3.3 1.7 2.9 0 Softblock MBS wt % 0 2.3 0 4.7 0 0 Softblock S2001 wt % 0 0 0 0 0 0 Total softblock wt % 1.7 3.2 3.3 6.3 2.9 0 PAEBPAlow/PAEBPAhigh 2.1 2.4 1.5 1.3 NA NA MVR cc/10 min 10.7 13.9 5.86 2.67 4.38 3.5 Flex. modulus MPa 3540 3380 5030 4990 5130 5240 NII J/m 276 206 179 98 260 238 Gloss % 68.46 71.88 47.04 43.4 36.82 36.8 Comparing E12/E13 to C10/C11, it was seen that compositions containing the HFD polymers (E12/E13) exhibited higher gloss compared to BPA homopolymers (C10/C11). Example E12 reflects a good balance of properties. Compositions E10-E13 further illustrate that the combination of PAEBPAlow and PAEBPAhigh achieved good impact (at least 90 J/m) and surface gloss properties (at least 40). A relatively high amount of PAEBPAlow compared to PAEBPAhigh in particular improved the flow properties. Comparing E2 to E13 illustrates that increasing the glass fiber content decreases the MVR, increases the flexural modulus, and decreases the NII. Examples E20-E30 Next, compositions were made containing 30 wt % glass fibers, and varied with different loadings of the polysiloxane-polycarbonate copolymer. Example Compositions E20-E30 and Comparative Example C20 are described in Tables 6A and 6B below: TABLE 6A Ingredient Unit E20 E21 E22 E23 E24 E25 C20 PAEBPAlow wt % 0 16.25 32.5 0 16.25 32.5 0 PAEBPAhigh wt % 65 48.75 32.5 60 43.75 27.5 0 PClow wt % 0 0 0 0 0 0 59 PC-Si wt % 5 5 5 10 10 10 11 Glass fibers wt % 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 TiO2 wt % 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 PAEBPAlow/PAEBPAhigh 0 0.3 1 0 0.4 1.2 NA MVR cc/10 min 5.9 5.81 8.19 4.17 6.23 7.14 11.3 Flex. modulus MPa 6560 6470 6530 6220 6150 6250 5780 NII J/m 94.6 106 102 140 139 123 151 TABLE 6B Ingredient Unit E26 E27 E28 E29 E30 PAEBPAlow wt % 47 59 16.25 32.5 55 PAEBPAhigh wt % 12 0 38.75 22.5 0 PClow wt % 0 0 0 0 0 PC-Si wt % 11 11 15 15 15 Glass fibers wt % 30 30 30 30 30 TiO2 wt % 5 5 5 5 5 PAEBPAlow/PAEBPAhigh 3.9 NA 0.4 1.4 NA MVR cc/10 min 12.3 16.4 4.35 8.02 14.7 Flex. modulus MPa 5770 5850 5900 6030 5750 NII J/m 154 135 180 136 155 Comparing the contents of Tables 4A-6B, it was seen that generally, increasing the glass fiber content increased the flexural modulus and decreased the NII. Increasing the glass fiber content generally decreased the MVR, but this could be compensated by changing the polycarbonate split ratio. Comparing E21/E24E/28 and E22/E25/E29, it was seen that increasing the polysiloxane-polycarbonate copolymer content and decreasing the PAEBPAhigh decreased the MVR and decreased the flexural modulus. However, the NII generally increased. This is believed to be due to molecular weight differences. The combination of PAEBPAlow, PAEBPAhigh, and PC-Si results in good balance between flow and ductile properties. Looking at E26, this effect could be maintained at PAEBPAlow/PAEBPAhigh ratios up to 4. Comparing E28 to E29, at a given loading of polysiloxane-polycarbonate copolymer, the balance between MVR and NII can be varied by changing the PAEBPAlow/PAEBPAhigh ratio. Examples E31-E39 Six Comparative Examples C30-C35 and Examples E31-E39 are described in Tables 7A and 7B. These compositions were made with 10 wt % glass fibers.

However, once the PAEBPAlow content was above 65 wt %, the NII decreased dramatically. In addition, E36-E38, containing both the PC-Si and MBS, had a good balance between NII and MVR. Example E31 reflects a particularly good balance of properties. Examples E40-E53 Comparative Examples C40, C41 and Examples E40-E53 are described in Tables 8A and 8B. These Example compositions were made with 20 wt % glass fibers. Example C40 contained 38 wt % of a bisphenol-A homopolymer with a Mw of about 21,800; 35.64 wt % of a bisphenol-A homopolymer with a Mw of about 30,500; 20 wt % glass fibers; 6 wt % of a PMMA-g-PBA-co-PDMS core-shell impact modifier, 0.3 wt % of an UV absorber, and 0.06 wt % of phosphite. Examples E40, E42, and E52 reflect a particularly good balance of properties. It is expected that the flexural modulus for Examples E40-E45 and E48-50 should be between 5000 MPa and 6000 MPa.
