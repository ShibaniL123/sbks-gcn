CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION This application claims benefit from provisional application Serial No. 61/243,701 filed on September 18, 2009. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to methods of preparation or synthesis and isolation of highly purified Rose Bengal, Rose Bengal Lactone and related xanthenes, and also relates to highly purified Rose Bengal, Rose Bengal Lactone and related xanthenes. One aspect of the present invention relates to synthetic procedures to prepare iodinated fluorescein derivatives that contain at most 2% by weight, and preferably less than 0.15% by weight, of individual organic impurities. Controlling impurities to the 0.15% or 1500 ppm level or lower is relevant for pharmaceutical utility since this represents the qualification threshold for compliance with International Conference of Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines. Hence, another aspect of this invention relates to the pharmaceutical utility and identification of the novel compounds that are disclosed herein, for which the above synthesis was specifically engineered to control their formation. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The fluorescein structural motif and one step cyclization from phthalic anhydride and resorcinol is believed to have been first described in 1871 by Baeyer (Berichte. 1871: 4, 555). Graebe (Annalen. 1887: 18, 318) is believed to be the first to use halogenated phthalic anhydride as substrates in the cyclization noting in his report the use of an excess of anhydride (1.3 equivalents) to resorcinol. Iodination of dichlorofluorescein appeared in the literature in 1887 with a report by Le Royer (Annalen. 1887: 238, 359). In the 20th century, several uses for fluorescein analogs emerged. The compounds have been used as textile dyes, biological stains, building blocks for non-volatile memory devices, thermoimaging substrates and food and cosmetics coloring. For example, erythrosine (FD&C No.3) and partially iodinated erythrosine (D&C Nos. 11 and 12) are used as food, drug and cosmetic dyes. A particular tetraiodo-xanthene, Rose Bengal, has been used for visualization of ocular disease and, in radiolabeled form, as a medical diagnostic for liver function, appearing in the United States Pharmacopeia in 1965. The cyclization, however, to create the xanthene core of Rose Bengal has not substantially improved from the 1880's technology (high temperature melts in open kettles), even though interest in the synthesis of the non-halogenated analogs and elaboration on the fluorescein motif is extensive. The known synthetic methods produce a range of unpredictable and poorly characterized impurities including residual solvents, inorganic compounds and organic compounds derived from side reactions or degradation processes. For many historical uses in industrial applications, food dyes or diagnostics, these impurities are permissible. For example, the United States Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) allows an impurity level for FD&C No. 3 (erythrosine) of no more than 1% mono-iodinated impurities and no more than 9% of other lower iodinated fluoresceins. The CFR also allows residual impurities originating in the cyclization step, such as partially iodinated phthalic acids and resorcinols (for example, see: Kamikura, Shokuhin Eiseigaku Zasshi 1985: 26, 243 and Wada et al., Food. Add. Contam. 2004: 21, 1137). Such historical coloring agent specifications are quite disparate to modern International Conference of Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines for a new drug substance, which requires reporting of impurities of 0.05% or higher, comprehensive identification of any organic impurity present at levels of 0.1% or higher, and thorough toxicologic qualification of any impurities over 0.15%, and further provide limits on inorganic impurities and especially stringent limits on residual solvents. Hence, when introducing this class of compounds into the body at therapeutic doses, the necessity to have a well controlled, predictable and reproducible synthesis becomes a priority. Unpredictable generation of multiple impurities during synthetic steps or in purification is not an option for inclusion in such a specification, especially with a potential parenteral drug product formulation. To make reagent grade Rose Bengal, the United States Pharmacopeia XXII recommends using HCl to purify Rose Bengal via an acid/base manipulation. The present inventors have found that, quite surprisingly, when oxidants like hydrogen peroxide or oxone are present, treatment of iodinated fluoresceins with reagents that contain or can generate aqueous chloride ions causes a side reaction where one or more of the I substituents can be transhalogenated to Cl. This can also occur when chloride free radicals, hypochlorite ion, or hypochlorous acid are present. This side reaction during the preparation of Rose Bengal has not been reported previously and the cyclization step, the iodination step and any purification scheme must be carefully controlled to prevent this undesirable side reaction. While iodinated fluorescein analogs have been previously described and often generically recite the word "halogen", none of these prior disclosures appear to enable the synthesis of iodo-xanthene substituted fluoresceins directly from iodo-resorcinols. Also, none of the prior disclosures appear to require at least one iodine to be present in the molecule, and none claim a pharmaceutical applicability of these compounds that is most certainly iodine dependent. Predominant use of fluoresceins for nontherapeutic purposes have resulted in a paucity of information regarding the description and reduction to practice of methods required for the preparation of high purity active pharmaceutical ingredients in this compound class, as well as methods for the identification, characterization and synthesis of minor by-products which may have utility as human therapeutics or as colorants. Iodinated xanthenes have been generically included as embodiments in various disclosures, and Rose Bengal is a well known compound first described in the 1880's. None of these references, however, has described the isolation or identification, nor disclosed or indicated the possibility of the existence of, the transhalogenated minor products composed of at least one I and at least one Cl substituent on the xanthene core. The present inventors have discovered that these products can exist in up to 2% by weight in commercial samples of Rose Bengal. Furthermore, prior references allude to lower iodinated xanthene contaminants (for example, not more than 9% is allowed for the dye certification of erythrosine in the present CFR 74.303), but none of these references have proposed a structure or a name for triiodinated versions that can be substituted with hydrogen in either the 2' or 4' position or their corresponding atropisomers (see figures 1q and 1r infra and refer to U.S. Pat. No. 6,649,769 for a discussion of atropisomerism on this scaffold). Nor has the prior references taught or suggested the isolation or enabled the synthesis of independent I/Cl substitutions about the xanthene core. The present invention identifies, characterizes and establishes methods to efficiently control the synthesis of these by-products to meet the standards required for utility in pharmaceutical applications. In addition, the process of the present invention avoids undesirable formation of these by-products, avoids the necessity of using multiple solvents and sets strict control of reagents, all of which improve handling, yield, purity and applicability of the process for pharmaceutical use. Published PCT application WO 02/05812 discloses a medicament for chemotherapeutic treatment of disease. The reference relates in particular to halogenated xanthine such as Rose Bengal for use in treating illnesses and in particular chemotherapy. In Tetrahedron, vol. 41, no. 11, 1 January 1985, pages 2183 to 2190, J Lambert et al discuss Rose Bengal derivatives as singlet oxygen sensitizers. The relationship between structural and photo physical properties are studied. In J. Am. Chem. Soc., vol. 106, no. 20, 1 January 1984, J. Lambert et al discussed novel Rose Bengal derivatives and their synthesis. The equilibrium between the quinoid and lactonic forms of the compounds is discussed. Published PCT application WO2008/003954 discloses dye imaging agents including Rose Bengal. The document provides specific imaging agents and discusses methods of manufacture. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to materials and methods to control the impurity level in iodinated xanthenes of Formula 4a manufactured for pharmaceutical use, processes for the manufacture of these iodinated xanthene compounds, and the disclosure of related but previously unanticipated transhalogenated impurities. The present invention also relates to materials and methods for preparing the same, and in particular processes for preparing erythrosine (FD&C 3), Rose Bengal, and other related iodinated xanthenes in purity suitable for pharmaceutical use. In one embodiment, this process employs only a single organic solvent, low temperature (less than 100Â°C) and requires use of very limited and select additives and modifiers to avoid formation of impurities. Avoiding formation of transhalogented impurities can, for example, be accomplished by limiting chloride ion to less than 1500 ppm in the reaction mixtures, and especially in the reaction mixtures during the iodination step. No extraction, chromatographic or solvent concentration steps are required, and the intermediate, as well as final compounds, can be isolated via filtration or similar means. The present invention is also directed to specific analogs and new compounds, particularly those that can be made or are avoided via the method disclosed above. These compounds have been isolated and identified, and are adapted for pharmaceutical, medicinal, cosmetic and colorant use. In a further embodiment, there is provided a process for the production of a compound of Formula 4a: wherein R1 is independently Cl or Br; R11 and R12 are independently H, Na, K, Li, or a counter-ion capable of forming a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, comprising combining a compound of Formula 3a, or a quinoid isomer thereof wherein compound of Formula 3a, or the quinoid isomer thereof, is substantially free of chloride ion impurities and chloride-ion-producing impurities, wherein R1 is independently Cl or Br; R2, R3, R4, and R5 are H; which method takes place with at least about 4 equivalents of iodine, in a solution substantially free of chloride ions and substantially free of chloride-ion-producing impurities to form the compound of Formula 4a characterized in that there is substantially no formation of transhalogenated derivatives of the compound of Formula 4b, wherein for the transhalogenated impurities of the compound of Formula 4b, R1 is independently Cl or Br; at least one of R2, R3, R4 and R5 is Cl and the remainder are I; R11 and R12 are independently H, Na, K, Li, or a counter-ion capable of forming a pharmaceutically acceptable salt.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENTLY PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS Definitions "C1-C4 alkyl" refers to straight chain and branched saturated hydrocarbon groups, generally having a specified number of carbon atoms. Examples of C1-C4 alkyl groups include, without limitation, methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, i-propyl, n-butyl, s-butyl, i-butyl and t-butyl. "Halo" and "halogen" may be used interchangeably, and refer to fluoro, chloro, bromo, and iodo functionalities. "Substantially chloride free" and similar language refers to reaction conditions, reagents or intermediates that are free of chloride ion, impurities containing chloride ion, or impurities which can produce chloride ion, to a level of purity sufficient to avoid undesirable formation of transhalogenated impurities of Formula 3, Formula 3a or Formula 4a at levels of 0.15% (e.g., 1500 ppm) or greater, or wherein such reaction conditions, reagents or intermediates contain chloride ion, impurities containing chloride ion, or impurities which can produce chloride ion at a level of 1500 ppm or lower. "Substantially free of transhalogenated impurities" and similar language refers to the presence of compounds of Formula 3, and Formula 4b wherein, R1 is independently Cl or Br, at least one of R2, R3, R4 and R5 is Cl and the remainder are I, at a level of 0.15% (e.g., 1500 ppm) or lower. Generic Structural Representations The structures of various intermediate and final products of Formula 3, Formula 3a, Formula 3b, Formula 4a and Formula 4b are illustrated for the sake of simplicity in their generic lactone or quinoid isomeric forms, and may, depending upon pH or other conditions, be present in their alternate isomeric form (e.g., quinoid instead of lactone, or lactone instead of quinoid). Such generic representation is not intended to limit the disclosure to the specific generic isomeric forms illustrated. Reaction Schemes Scheme I shows one embodiment of the present invention which involves a method of making iodinated xanthenes (such as, for example, Formula 3). This method includes reacting a phthalic anhydride (Formula 1) with an excess of a resorcinol (Formula 2) to give a compound of Formula 3a where R2, R3, R4, and R5 are not I and at least one of R2-R5 is H. This compound, following minimal isolation, is then subjected to iodination to give a compound of Formula 3 where at least one of R2, R3, R4 or R5 is substituted with I. The cyclization reaction, Step 1 above, may be carried out, for example, using neat to 10% methanesulfonic acid (MSA) in water, at temperatures from 0Â°C to reflux. In a preferred embodiment, neat methanesulfonic acid is used at 85Â°C - 95Â°C, for 1-16 hours. In a further preferred embodiment, between 2-6 volumes of MSA, more preferably between 4 and 5 volumes of MSA, and even more preferably approximately 4.8 volumes of MSA, are used. Alternatively, p-toluenesulfonic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, sulfuric acid or trifluoromethanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, camphorsulfonic acid, or an acidic solution comprised of one or more of an alkyl sulfonic acid or aryl sulfonic acid with a melting point less than about 250Â°C, an alky carboxylic acid or aryl carboxylic acid with a melting point less than about 250Â°C, a non-chloride BrÃ¸Ìnsted acid, a non-chloride or chloride-immobilized Lewis Acid, or their respective polymer bound or salt preparations, or aqueous solutions thereof, alone or in combination with methanesulfonic acid, may be used to effect cyclization. The cyclization to Formula 3a can be effected using substantially stoichiometric amounts of reactants (e.g., with a ratio of 2:1 resorcinols of Formula 2 to phthalic anhydrides of Formula 1). In a further embodiment, it may be preferable to carry out the reaction with an excess of resorcinol (e.g., from about 2.5 equivalents to about 3 or more equivalents, and more preferably about 3.2 or more equivalents) in order to assure complete consumption of phthalic anhydride. After isolation of Formula 3a, the resultant solid can be re-suspended with or without agitation, preferably with heating to 50Â°C to 70Â°C, to improve purity, using water and a combination of acetone and water or DMF and water, and more preferably using acetone and water about 60Â°C. Isolation and re-suspension may be repeated until the material of Formula 3a is of a desired purity. The iodination reaction, Step 2 above, may be carried out using molar excess of iodine (I2), preferably under basic conditions. For example, the reaction may be carried out using 0.1-5 M sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium bicarbonate or potassium bicarbonate, at temperatures from 0Â°C to reflux. In a preferred embodiment, this reaction may be carried out using 0.4-1.0 M NaOH at 70Â°C-95Â°C. KI, NaI or a mixture of KI and NaI can be used to solubilize iodine in the reaction mixture, for example using NaI at 1-2.5 equivalents. Reaction times range from 1-24 h and are dependent on the number of iodine atoms added to the xanthene ring system. In a further embodiment, it is possible to control the extent of iodination by varying the reaction time, temperature, or base concentration. Iodine for this reaction may also be generated in situ using an oxidizing agent such as oxone or hydrogen peroxide and iodide salts selected from potassium iodide, lithium iodide, sodium iodide or some mixture thereof. In this particular example, it is preferable to avoid inclusion of components in the reaction mixture that could lead to undesirable transhalogenation, such as aqueous chloride, chlorine, HCl or other components capable of producing halogen ions, unless any oxidizing agent, including atmospheric oxygen and iodine, has been removed or quenched prior to addition of such components. For example sodium hypochlorite is a particularly undesireable component in this reaction mixture since it is a source of labile chloride ions and a potent oxidizer, also chloride ions, chloride radicals, other hypochlorite derivatives, hypochlorous acid and mixtures thereof can lead to the undesireable side reaction. At reaction completion, the mixture can be cooled to approximately -20Â°C to 10Â°C, preferably below 10Â°C, and iodine can be quenched by addition of an iodine scavenger, such as sodium thiosulfate, potassium thiosulfate, ammonium thiosulfate, potassium sulfite, sodium sulfite or a mixture thereof. In a preferred embodiment, sodium sulfite is used to quench. Facile isolation of Formula 3 is possible if the pH of the reaction is then adjusted, preferably maintaining a temperature below 10Â°C and using neat aqueous sulfuric acid to 1% aqueous solution, preferably 5% sulfuric acid aqueous solution, until the pH is adjusted to between 1.5 and 5, causing Formula 3 to precipitate from solution. In a preferred embodiment, the pH is adjusted to between pH 1.5 and pH 3. After isolation of Formula 3, the resultant solid can be re-suspended and further isolated at ambient temperature to remove impurities, for example using water and a combination of acetone and water or DMF and water, preferably acetone and water. Additionally, pH may be adjusted to 5 or higher to solubilize Formula 3 as Formula 4a prior to conversion back to Formula 3 for isolation under acidic conditions. Scheme II shows another embodiment of the present invention, wherein compounds of Formula 3 may also exist in a quinoid form (Formula 4) at substantially neutral or at basic pH, and these quinoids may exist as salts where one or both hydroxyl groups are replaced with a basic counter-ion, R11 and / or R12, including Na, K or Li ion. Scheme III shows a method of replacing I with Cl to generate compounds of Formula 3b, where at least one position selected from R2,R3,R4 and R5 is Cl, starting from compounds of Formula 3 where at least one position selected from R2,R3,R4 and R5 is I. Scheme IV shows another embodiment of the present invention, wherein compounds of Formula 4 may also be isolated as products of this process (Formula 4a) and impurities (Formula 4b), and these quinoids may exist as salts where one or both hydroxyl groups at R11 and / or R12 are replaced with a counter-ion capable of forming a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, including H, Na, K or Li ion. Preferred embodiments of the present invention relate to compounds of Formula 3 and Formula 4a where R1 is independently Cl or Br, and R2-R5 are independently selected from Cl, I or H where at least 1 hydrogen atom are present at R2-R5 or at least one chlorine atom is present at R2-R5, and including atropisomers when applicable.

Compounds of Formula 3 or Formula 4a of the present invention may contain chiral centers and therefore may exist in different enantiomeric and diastereomeric forms. Likewise, the quinoid form of compounds of Formula 3 or Formula 4a where the xanthene ring is not symmetric due to dissimilar substituents on the corresponding xanthene aryl rings (i.e., for example, R2 â  R5 when R3 = R4 or R3 â  R4 when R2 = R5, such as the quinoid forms of compounds depicted in Figures 1c, 1d, 1g, 1h, 1i, 1j, 1k, 1o, 1p) may exist as stable atropisomers (as illustrated in Figures 1q and 1r). The process described herein encompasses both the minimization of the relative amount of racemic atropisomeric pairs when they may occur as reaction impurities as well as the preparation of these atropisomers as racemic mixtures. In so far as the compounds of Formula 3 are acidic compounds, they are capable of forming a wide variety of different salts with various inorganic and organic bases. The base addition salts of the acidic compounds of the present invention are readily prepared by treating the lactone of Formula 3 with at least one or two equivalents of the chosen mineral or organic base in an aqueous or suitable organic solvent, such as ethanol or methanol. Upon evaporation of the solvent, filtration or using directly an aqueous solution of the resulting salt, the desired salt is readily obtained in the quinoid form as described by Formula 4a. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, for example, those formed with sodium, calcium, potassium, magnesium, meglumine, ammonium, aluminum, zinc, piperazine, tromethamin, lithium, choline, diethylamine, 4-phenylcyclohexylamine and benzathine. EXAMPLES The following examples are intended to be illustrative, and represent specific embodiments of the present invention. General Methods All reactions were carried out in open vessels. The vessels were sometimes covered to protect from ambient light. All reactions were carried out under nitrogen, argon or other inert atmosphere unless otherwise noted. All solvents and reagents used were from commercial sources, and no further purification was performed. Reactions were monitored using high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) using either a Agilent 1100 Series Quaternary pump/variable wavelength detector (225 nm detection wavelength) with Supelco Ascentis Express C18 column (4.6x150 mm, 2.7 Âµm at 40Â°C, MeCN/0.5% H3PO4 in H2O, 65/35 to 90/10 gradient running over 30 min) or the same instrument using a Waters Symmetry Shield RP-18 column (4.6x150 mm, 5Âµm at 40Â°C, MeCN/10 mM K3PO4 pH 3 in H2O + 5% MeCN, 10/90 to 80/20 gradient over 25 min or 65/35 isocratic); mass spectrometry (Agilent LC/MSD trap or Waters LCMS with similar chromatography conditions as HPLC, modified with formic acid); and/or thin-layer chromatography (TLC) using UV light and a iodine stain for visualizing. Supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC) was performed using a Thar SFC 80 with a RegisCell column (3 x 25 cm), loading 20-22 mg/injection at a 4.5 mg/mL concentration in ethanol. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectra were recorded at 300 MHz on a Varian INOVA 300 or Varian Gemini 2000 or at 400 MHz on a Varian Oxford 400, each using TMS as an internal standard. Chemical shifts are reported (as Î´ units in parts per million, ppm) relative to the singlet at 2.50 ppm for DMSO-d6 referenced to tetramethylsilane (TMS) at 0 ppm. Coupling constants (J) are reported in Hertz (Hz). Noise-decoupled Carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (13C NMR) spectra were recorded at 75 MHz on either a Varian INOVA 300, at 100 MHz on a Varian Oxford 400, or at 75 MHz on a Varian Gemini 2000 spectrometer. Chemical shifts are reported as Î´ in ppm relative to the center line of the septet at 39.5 ppm for DMSO-d6, UV-VIS spectroscopic data were obtained on a Hitachi U-2810 Double Beam Spectrophotometer or on a Spectronic Genesys 2 Spectrophotometer scanning from 200-600 nm, slit width 1.5 nm, path length 10.0 mm. Example 1- Preparation of 4,5,6,7-tetrachloro-3',6'-dihydroxy-2',4',5',7'-tetraiodo-3H-spiro[isobenzofuran-1,9'-xanthen]-3-one (Rose Bengal Lactone, Figure 1a) Step 1: Cyclization. A 500 mL round bottom flask was equipped with a heating mantle, J-Kem thermocouple, large magnetic stir bar, nitrogen inlet line, and a magnetic stir plate. This apparatus was charged with tetrachlorophthalic anhydride (1.00 eq, 50.00 g, 174.9 mmol), resorcinol (2.10 eq, 40.44 g, 367.3 mmol), and neat methanesulfonic acid (250 mL). The resulting reaction mixture was a suspension at room temperature. The reaction mixture was purged with nitrogen and heated to 90Â°C to give a dark red-orange solution. The reaction was held at 90Â°C for 5 hours, and then an additional 5.78 g of resorcinol (0.3 eq, 52.47 mmol) was added. The reaction continued to stir at 90Â°C for 2.5 hours. The reaction is deemed to be complete when the amount of residual tetrachlorophthalic anhydride is < 1.0% by HPLC. A 1 L round-bottomed flask (3 neck) equipped with a mechanical stirrer, ice bath and J-Kem thermocouple was charged with ambient USP water (500 mL). The 90Â°C reaction mixture was added slowly via transfer line to the USP water at < 10Â°C using a positive pressure of nitrogen. During the transfer of the reaction mixture to water, the transfer rate was controlled such that the temperature of the water quench mixture did not exceed 60Â°C. An additional 100 mL of USP water was used to rinse the reactor then transferred to the reactor containing the water. The resultant green-brown suspension was allowed to gradually cool to room temperature (RT) and stirred at RT for an additional 30 min. The solids were isolated via vacuum filtration. The reactor was rinsed with USP water (2 x 250 mL aliquots) and these rinses were used to rinse the wetcake. The wetcake was pulled dry for 60 min, and then dried in vacuo at 70Â°C overnight to give 88.60 g of greenish-brown solids. This material, along with 550 mL of acetone was added to a 2 L round bottom flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, J-Kem thermocouple, heating mantle, nitrogen inlet line, and a Y-adapter with a reflux condenser. The resulting suspension was heated to reflux for 1.5 hours, whereupon it was treated with 530 mL of USP water (slowly added via an addition funnel over 60 min) such that the temperature remained â¥ 56Â°C. During the addition of the water, the temperature was observed to rise (maximum temp achieved was 62Â°C). After the addition of the water was complete, the yellowish-brown suspension was held at reflux for 3 hours, and then gradually cooled to RT over approximately 30-40 minutes. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for an additional 30 min, and then the yellowish-brown suspension was collected via vacuum filtration. The reactor was rinsed with 50% aqueous acetone (v/v, 4 x 100 mL), and these rinses were used to rinse the wetcake. The wetcake was allowed to pull dry over 48 h and then further dried in vacuo at 70Â°C overnight to give 74.43 g (90.5 % yield at 96.8% AUC purity) of tetrachlorofluorescein as a yellow brown solid. 1H NMR (300 MHz; DMSO d6) Î´ 10.23 (S, 2H), 6.95 (d, J=8.7 Hz, 2H), 6.69 (d, J=2.1 Hz, 2H), 6.57 (d of d, J=8.7 Hz, 2H). Step 2: Iodination. A 500 mL round bottom flask (3-neck) was equipped with a reflux condenser, Y-adapter, J-Kem thermocouple, mechanical stirrer, heating mantle, and a nitrogen inlet line. The reactor was purged with nitrogen and covered with aluminum foil. This was charged with 10.00 grams of tetrachlorofluorescein (21.3 mmol), 30 mL of 5 M NaOH solution and 300 mL of USP water to give a dark red solution. Then, 7.03 grams of sodium iodide (46.9 mmol) and 32.4 g of iodine (127.7 mmol) were charged to the reactor. The reaction mixture was allowed to stir at ambient temperature for 30 min, then it was heated to 90Â°C. HPLC analysis of an aliquot of the reaction mixture indicated complete consumption of starting material, no partially iodinated intermediates, and complete conversion to the desired product. After the reaction had been heated at 90Â°C for 1.5 hours, the heat was turned off, and the reaction mixture was allowed to gradually cool to room temperature over 1.5 hours. The dark purplish-pink reaction mixture was cooled to < 10Â°C with an ice bath. The pH of the reaction mixture was 7.13. Sodium sulfite (6.70 g) was added to the reaction mixture in small portions. 75 mL of acetone was charged to the reactor at < 10Â°C, and the mixture was allowed to stir for 10 min at < 10Â°C. While at < 10Â°C, 5% aqueous H2SO4 solution (24 mL) was added dropwise to achieve pH 2.03 and yield a pink suspension. This reaction suspension was collected via vacuum filtration. The reactor was rinsed with 25% aqueous acetone (v/v, 4 x 100 mL) and the rinses were utilized to rinse the wetcake. The wetcake was pulled dry for 3 hours and dried in vacuo. at 60Â°C overnight to give 25.81 g of pink solids. These solids and 225 mL of acetone were added to a 1 L round bottom flask (3 neck) equipped with a mechanical stirrer, J-Kem thermocouple, and Y-adapter with nitrogen inlet. This mixture was stirred at room temperature for 10 min, then 255 mL of USP water was added over 10 min to give a suspension. The suspension was stirred at room temperature for 2.25 hours, and then filtered via vacuum filtration to isolate solids. The reactor was rinsed using 50% aqueous acetone (1 x 75 mL), and this was used to rinse the wetcake. The wetcake was then rinsed with 50% aqueous acetone (2 x 75 mL) and USP water (1 x 75 mL), pulled dry for 1 hour and further dried at 80Â°C to give 18.68 g of product (90.2% yield, coral pink solids, HPLC AUC purity of 99.5%) of 4,5,6,7-tetrachloro-3',6'-dihydroxy-2',4',5',7'-tetraiodo-3H-spiro[isobenzofuran-1,9'-xanthen]-3-one.1H NMR (300 MHz; DMSO d6) 6 10.27 (s, 2H), 7.59 (s, 2H). 13C NMR (300 MHz; DMSO d6) 6 163.2, 158.6, 151.9, 146.7, 138.8, 136.5, 135.3, 131.2, 126.8, 124.6, 110.8, 81.8, 79.3, 77.0.
