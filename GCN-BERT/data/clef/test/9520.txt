Step B: 2-(Difluoromethyl)-8-(7-methyl-1H-indazol-5-yl)-7-(trifluoromethyl)imidazo[1,2-c]pyrimidine
To a solution of 2-(difluoromethyl)-8-(7-methyl-1-((2-(trimethylsilyl)ethoxy)methyl)-1H-indazol-5-yl)-7-(trifluoromethyl)imidazo[1,2-c]pyrimidine from Step B (56 mg, 0.11 mmol) in DCM (1.8 mL) was added TFA (1.0 mL). The mixture was stirred at rt for 30 minutes. The solvent was concentrated in vacuo and then redissolved in EtOAc. The reaction mixture was diluted with N2HCO3, extracted with EtOAc (Ã—2) and the combined organic extracts were dried (Na2SO4), filtered, and concentrated in vacuo. Purification (FCC, SiO2; 0-10% MeOH/DCM) afforded the title compound as a white solid (25.8 mg, 62% yield).
