FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a fat or oil composition, which is suited for a frozen dessert such as an ice cream. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION A fat or oil has been conventionally blended in a frozen dessert for the purpose of, for example, imparting a taste and flavor, improving a palate feeling, or improving physical properties. As the fat or oil for a frozen dessert, the following (1) to (4) has been heavily used: (1) a liquid oil typified by soybean oil or rapeseed oil having an extremely low melting point in consideration of a satisfactory melt-in-the-mouth feeling in a freezing temperature range; (2) an SUS-type triglyceride characterized by having a sharp melt-in-the-mouth feeling at temperatures near the body temperature (a triglyceride having an unsaturated fatty acid at the 2-position and saturated fatty acids at the 1- and 3-positions; (3) a lauric acid-rich fat or oil such as coconut oil or palm kernel oil; and (4) a solid fat typified by palm oil. However, the liquid oil (1) is insufficient in amount of crystals even at low temperature and hence is poor in emulsion stability. In the case of the solid fats (2) to (4), all of the fats or oils containing the solid fats pass through the throat to be ingested without melting in the mouth. Hence, the solid fats are poor in melt-in-the-mouth feeling in some cases. In addition, the solid fats are liable to provide frozen desserts with poor fineness and texture. On the other hand, a fat or oil containing diacylglycerols at high concentrations has been known to have physiological effects such as suppression of an increase in triglyceride (neutral fat) in blood after meal and less accumulation in the body (Patent Documents 1 and 2), and is expected to be used as an alternative to conventional fats or oils. Hitherto, for example, a diacylglycerol-containing semisolid fat or oil or the like synthesized from palm oil or the like has been reported as the diacylglycerol-containing fat or oil (Patent Document 3). CITATION LIST Patent Document [Patent Document 1] JP-A-4-300826 [Patent Document 2] JP-A-10-176181 [Patent Document 3] WO-A-2010/019598 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides a fat or oil composition, comprising 50 mass % or more of diacylglycerols satisfying the following (1) to (4): (1) 20 to 92 mass % of a disaturated diacylglycerol (SS) in the diacylglycerols; (2) 60 mass % or less of a monosaturated-monounsaturated diacylglycerol (SU) in the diacylglycerols; (3) 8 to 80 mass % of a diunsaturated diacylglycerol (UU) in the diacylglycerols; and (4) 20 mass % or more of a total content of saturated fatty acids having 10, 12, and 14 carbon atoms in saturated fatty acids constituting the diacylglycerols. The present invention also provides an emulsion, comprising the fat or oil composition, and having amass ratio between an oil phase and an aqueous phase of from 10:90 to 90:10. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION However, it found that, when the diacylglycerol-containing fat or oil produced by a conventional technology is used for frozen desserts, the fat or oil has properties of being poor in emulsion stability and being liable to be demulsified during freezing. Therefore, the present invention relates to providing a fat or oil composition that is excellent in emulsion stability and crystallization property, has a satisfactory melt-in-the-mouth feeling and the like, and has a high content of diacylglycerol. The inventors of the present invention made intensive studies to search a fat or oil capable of imparting excellent properties to frozen desserts with focusing attention on the ratio of a diacylglycerol having a specific structure in diacylglycerols, and as a result, found that it is possible to produce a fat or oil composition that is excellent in emulsion stability and crystallization property in the range of refrigeration and freezing temperatures, has a satisfactory melt-in-the-mouth feeling at a temperature near the body temperature or the like, and has performance suited for a fat or oil for frozen desserts, when the fat or oil composition contains specific amounts of a diacylglycerol including only saturated fatty acids, a diacylglycerol including only unsaturated fatty acids, and a diacylglycerol including a saturated fatty acid and an unsaturated fatty acid, respectively, and the ratio of a specific fatty acid in the diacylglycerols is adjusted within a predetermined range.

The fat or oil composition according to the present invention can be produced by, for example, separately preparing a fat or oil containing a high concentration of the disaturated diacylglycerol (SS), which includes only the saturated fatty acids, and a fat or oil containing a high concentration of the diunsaturated diacylglycerol (UU), which includes only the unsaturated fatty acids, or the like and then blending the fats or oils so that the diacylglycerols have the above-mentioned specific composition. Further, if necessary, a usual edible fat or oil may be blended. The edible fat or oil may be any of a plant-derived fat or oil and an animal-derived fat or oil. A specific raw material therefor may be exemplified by: plant-derived fats or oils such as soybean oil, rapeseed oil, safflower oil, rice oil, corn oil, sunflower oil, cotton seed oil, olive oil, sesame oil, peanut oil, Job's tears seed oil, wheat germ oil, Japanese basil oil, linseed oil, perilla oil, sacha inchi oil, walnut oil, kiwi seed oil, salvia seed oil, grape seed oil, macadamia nut oil, hazelnut oil, pumpkin seed oil, camellia oil, tea seed oil, borage oil, palm oil, palm olein, palm stearin, coconut oil, palm kernel oil, cacao butter, sal butter, shea butter, and algae oil; and animal-derived fats or oils such as fish oil, lard, beef tallow, and butter fat. In addition, fats or oils such as transesterified oils, hydrogenated oils, and fractionated oils thereof may be used. In the case of using the hydrogenated oil, a fully hardened oil is preferably used because a content of a trans unsaturated fatty acid in the total fatty acids constituting the fat or oil can be decreased. The oils may be used singly or may be mixed appropriately before use. Of those, from the viewpoint of usability, a plant-derived fat or oil is preferably used. A fat or oil containing a high content of diacylglycerol can be obtained through an esterification reaction of a fatty acid and glycerin, a glycerolysis reaction of a fat or oil and glycerin, or the like. From the viewpoint of controlling the fatty acid composition, it is preferably obtained by an esterification reaction of a raw material fat or oil-derived fatty acid and glycerin. The esterification reaction and/or the glycerolysis reaction are roughly classified into chemical methods using a chemical catalyst such as an alkali metal or an alloy thereof, an oxide, hydroxide, or alkoxide having from 1 to 3 carbon atoms of an alkali metal or an alkali earth metal, and enzymatic methods using an enzyme such as a lipase. In particular, the reactions are preferably carried out under enzymatically mild conditions by using a lipase or the like as the catalyst, from the viewpoint of an excellent taste and flavor or the like. After the esterification reaction and/or the glycerolysis reaction, a purification step usually employed for the fat or oil may be carried out. Specific examples thereof include steps of acid treatment, water washing, decoloration, and deodorization or the like. The raw material fat or oil for the fatty acid used in the esterification reaction and the raw material fat or oil used in the glycerolysis reaction may be the fats or oils listed above as the edible fats or oils. The fat or oil composition according to the present invention preferably contains an antioxidant. The content of the antioxidant in the fat or oil composition is preferably from 0.005 to 0.5%, more preferably from 0.04 to 0.25%, even more preferably from 0.08 to 0.2%, from the viewpoints of, for example, a taste and flavor, oxidation stability, and suppression of coloration. Any antioxidant that is usually used in a food may be used as the antioxidant. It is possible to use, for example, vitamin E, butylhydroxytoluene (BHT), butylhydroxyanisole (BHA), t-butylhydroquinone (TBHQ), vitamin C or derivatives thereof, phospholipids, and natural antioxidants such as a rosemary extract. The fat or oil composition according to the present invention can be used for an oil-in-water emulsion or a water-in-oil emulsion. A mass ratio between an aqueous phase and an oil phase is not particularly limited, but is preferably “oil phase:aqueous phase”=from 10:90 to 90:10, more preferably “oil phase:aqueous phase”=from 20:80 to 80:20, even more preferably “oil phase:aqueous phase”=from 30:70 to 70:30. In the case where the fat or oil composition is formed into an emulsion, a component usually used for an emulsion, such as an emulsifier, an antioxidant, a stabilizer, a thickener, a gelling agent, or a surfactant, may be appropriately blended. Further, another fat or oil may be blended in the oil phase in addition to the fat or oil composition according to the present invention. Examples of another fat or oil may include usual animal- and plant-derived edible fats or oils as mentioned above and processed fats or oils. The fat or oil composition according to the present invention is in a solid state at normal temperature (20° C.) and can be applied as an edible fat or oil to a variety of foods and beverages. In particular, the fat or oil composition is suited for frozen desserts because the composition has an excellent melt-in-the-mouth feeling in the mouth and is excellent in emulsion stability and crystallization property in the range of refrigeration and freezing temperatures. The frozen desserts are not particularly limited as long as the preservation temperature or ingestion temperature falls within the range of refrigeration and freezing temperatures, and examples thereof include ice creams (ice cream, ice milk, and lactic ice) and edible ices (such as sherbet and shaved ice).

Each of the fat or oil compositions was melted at 80° C. to prepare a homogeneous oil phase. 85 parts by mass of an aqueous phase (3 parts by mass of casein sodium, 77 parts by mass of a maltose solution, 5 parts by mass of water) was heated to 80° C., and 15 parts by mass of the oil phase heated to 80° C. was added dropwise thereto while the mixture was stirred (3,000 rpm) using a homomixer (manufactured by PRIMIX Corporation). After completion of the dropwise addition, the mixture was subjected to an emulsification treatment at 7,000 rpm for 10 minutes to prepare a preliminary oil-in-water emulsion. The resultant preliminary emulsion was subjected to a homogenization treatment using the homogenizer at a temperature of 65° C. and a pressure of 4×106 Pa, to an UHT sterilization treatment (VTIS sterilizer manufactured by Alfa Laval, Inc.), and then to a rehomogenization treatment at a temperature of 70° C. and a pressure of 2.5×106 Pa. The emulsion after the homogenization treatment was cooled to 8° C., thereby obtaining an oil-in-water emulsion. (2) Evaluation of Emulsion Stability 100 mL of the oil-in-water emulsion prepared in (1) above was taken in an emulsification test tube, and the emulsion was evaluated for its emulsion stability in accordance with the following criteria based on an amount of water separation determined after 4 hours at 5° C. Table 3 shows the results. (Emulsion Stability) 4: Very satisfactory emulsion stability without separation of water from emulsion 3: Satisfactory emulsified state even with separation of a small amount of water from emulsion 2: Satisfactory emulsified state even with separation of small amounts of water and oil from emulsion 1: Poor emulsified state with separation of water and oil from emulsion (3) Preparation of Lactic Ice Each of the fat or oil compositions prepared in (1) above and excellent in emulsion stability was used to prepare a lactic ice having a blending ratio (represented as mass % in terms of solids) shown in Table 2. The raw materials other than the flavor were melted at 85° C. to prepare a homogeneous mixture, and the mixture was subjected to a preliminary emulsification for 10 minutes using a puddle mixer. After that, the mixture was emulsified using a high-pressure homogenizer (Sanwa Engineering Ltd.) under a condition of 150 kg/cm2. The resultant emulsion was heated to 85° C. to sterilize the emulsion and immediately cooled to 5° C. The resultant was aged at the same temperature for 24 hours, thereby obtaining an oil-in-water emulsion. A flavor was added to the resultant oil-in-water emulsion, and the mixture was subjected to a freezing in an ice cream freezer (Mitsubishi Electric Corporation), thereby obtaining a lactic ice. It should be noted that a monoglyceride (EXCEL T-95, Kao Corporation) was used as an emulsifier, and a thickener (SAN BEST AS-1, San-Ei Gen F.F.I., Inc.) was used as a stabilizer.
