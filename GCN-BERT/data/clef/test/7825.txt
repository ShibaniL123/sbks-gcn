BACKGROUND The present invention relates to settable compositions according to claim 1. Settable compositions may be used in a variety of subterranean applications. As used herein, the term "settable composition" refers to any composition that over time will set to form a hardened mass. One example of a settable composition comprises hydraulic cement and water. Subterranean applications that may involve settable compositions include, but are not limited to, primary cementing, remedial cementing, and drilling operations. Settable compositions also may be used in surface applications, for example, construction cementing. Settable compositions may be used in primary cementing operations whereby pipe strings, such as casing and liners, are cemented in well bores. In performing primary cementing, a settable composition may be pumped into an annular space between the walls of a well bore and the pipe string disposed therein. The settable composition sets in the annular space, thereby forming an annular sheath of hardened cement (e.g., a cement sheath) that supports and positions the pipe string in the well bore and bonds the exterior surface of the pipe string to the walls of the well bore. Settable compositions also may be used in remedial cementing operations, such as sealing voids in a pipe string or a cement sheath. As used herein the term "void" refers to any type of space, including fractures, holes, cracks, channels, spaces, and the like. Such voids may include: holes or cracks in the pipe strings; holes, cracks, spaces, or channels in the cement sheath; and very small spaces (commonly referred to as "microannuli") between the cement sheath and the exterior surface of the well casing or formation. Sealing such voids may prevent the undesired flow of fluids (e.g., oil, gas, water, etc.) and/or fine solids into, or from, the well bore. The sealing of such voids, whether or not made deliberately, has been attempted by introducing a substance into the void and permitting it to remain therein to seal the void. If the substance does not fit into the void, a bridge, patch, or sheath may be formed over the void to possibly produce a termination of the undesired fluid flow. Substances used heretofore in methods to terminate the undesired passage of fluids through such voids include settable compositions comprising water and hydraulic cement, wherein the methods employ hydraulic pressure to force the settable composition into the void. Once placed into the void, the settable composition may be permitted to harden. Remedial cementing operations also may be used to seal portions of subterranean formations or portions of gravel packs. The portions of the subterranean formation may include permeable portions of a formation and fractures (natural or otherwise) in the formation and other portions of the formation that may allow the undesired flow of fluid into, or from, the well bore. The portions of the gravel pack include those portions of the gravel pack, wherein it is desired to prevent the undesired flow of fluids into, or from, the well bore. A "gravel pack" is a term commonly used to refer to a volume of particulate materials (such as sand) placed into a well bore to at least partially reduce the migration of unconsolidated formation particulates into the well bore. While screenless gravel packing operations are becoming more common, gravel packing operations commonly involve placing a gravel pack screen in the well bore neighboring a desired portion of the subterranean formation, and packing the surrounding annulus between the screen and the well bore with particulate materials that are sized to prevent and inhibit the passage of formation solids through the gravel pack with produced fluids. Among other things, this method may allow sealing of the portion of the gravel pack to prevent the undesired flow of fluids without requiring the gravel pack's removal. Settable compositions also may be used during the drilling of the well bore in a subterranean formation. For example, in the drilling of a well bore, it may be desirable, in some instances, to change the direction of the well bore. In some instances, settable compositions may be used to facilitate this change of direction, for example, by drilling a pilot hole in a hardened mass of cement, commonly referred to as a "kickoff plug," placed in the well bore. Certain formations may cause the drill bit to drill in a particular direction. For example, in a vertical well, this may result in an undesirable well bore deviation from vertical. In a directional well (which is drilled at an angle from vertical), after drilling an initial portion of the well bore vertically, the direction induced by the formation may make following the desired path difficult. In those and other instances, special directional drilling tools may be used, such as a whipstock, a bent sub-downhole motorized drill combination, and the like. Generally, the directional drilling tool or tools used may be orientated so that a pilot hole is produced at the desired angle to the previous well bore in a desired direction. When the pilot hole has been drilled for a short distance, the special tool or tools are removed, if required, and drilling along the new path may be resumed. To help ensure that the subsequent drilling follows the pilot hole, it may be necessary to drill the pilot hole in a kickoff plug, placed in the well bore. In those instances, prior to drilling the pilot hole, a settable composition may be introduced into the well bore and allowed to set to form a kickoff plug therein. The pilot hole then may be drilled in the kickoff plug, and the high strength of the kickoff plug helps ensure that the subsequent drilling proceeds in the direction of the pilot hole. Settable compositions used heretofore commonly comprise Portland cement. Portland cement generally is a major component of the cost for the settable compositions. To reduce the cost of such settable compositions, other components may be included in the settable composition in addition to, or in place of, the Portland cement. Such components may include fly ash, slag cement, shale, metakaolin, micro-fine cement, and the like. "Fly ash," as that term is used herein, refers to the residue from the combustion of powdered or ground coal, wherein the fly ash carried by the flue gases may be recovered, for example, by electrostatic precipitation. "Slag," as that term is used herein, refers to a granulated, blast furnace by-product formed in the production of cast iron and generally comprises the oxidized impurities found in iron ore. Slag cement generally comprises slag and a base, for example, such as sodium hydroxide, sodium bicarbonate, sodium carbonate, or lime, to produce a settable composition that, when combined with water, may set to form a hardened mass. During the manufacture of cement, a waste material commonly referred to as "CKD" is generated. "CKD," as that term is used herein, refers to a partially calcined kiln feed which is removed from the gas stream and collected in a dust collector during the manufacture of cement. Usually, large quantities of CKD are collected in the production of cement that are commonly disposed of as waste. Disposal of the waste CKD can add undesirable costs to the manufacture of the cement, as well as the environmental concerns associated with its disposal. The chemical analysis of CKD from various cement manufactures varies depending on a number of factors, including the particular kiln feed, the efficiencies of the cement production operation, and the associated dust collection systems. CKD generally may comprise a variety of oxides, such as SiO2, Al2O3, Fe2O3, CaO, MgO, SO3, Na2O, and K2O. SUMMARY The present invention provides a settable compositon as defined by claim 1. The features and advantages of the present invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art. It will be appreciated that the invention may be modified within the scope of the appended claims. DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The present invention relates to settable compositions according to claim 1. The settable compositions of the present invention may be used in a variety of subterranean applications, including primary cementing, remedial cementing, and drilling operations. The settable compositions of the present invention also may be used in surface applications, for example, construction cementing. Settable Compositions of the Present Invention The settable compositions of the present invention has a density of 13.3 pounds per gallon ("ppg") [1600 kg/m3] The water used in the settable compositions of the present invention may include freshwater, saltwater (e.g., water containing one or more salts dissolved therein), brine (e.g., saturated saltwater produced from subterranean formations), seawater, or combinations thereof. Generally, the water may be from any source, provided that it does not contain an excess of compounds that may adversely affect other components in the settable composition. As used herein, the term "by weight," when used herein to refer to the percent of a component in the settable composition, means by weight included in the settable compositions of the present invention relative to the weight of the dry components in the settable composition. The CKD is present in the settable compositions of the present invention in an amount of 25% by weight. The settable compositions of the present invention comprise Portland cement.. The Portland cement used in the present invention is classified as Class A cement according to American Petroleum Institute, API Specification for Materials and Testing for Well Cements, API Specification 10, Fifth Ed., July 1, 1990. The Portland cement is present in the settable compositions of the present invention in an amount of 50% by weight. The settable compositions of the present invention comprise zeolite. Zeolites generally are porous alumino-silicate minerals that may be either a natural or synthetic material. Synthetic zeolites are based on the same type of structural cell as natural zeolites, and may comprise aluminosilicate hydrates. As used herein, the term "zeolite" refers to all natural and synthetic forms of zeolite. In certain embodiments, suitable zeolites for use in the present invention may include "analcime" (which is hydrated sodium aluminum silicate), "bikitaite" (which is lithium aluminum silicate), "brewsterite" (which is hydrated strontium barium calcium aluminum silicate), "chabazite" (which is hydrated calcium aluminum silicate), "clinoptilolite" (which is hydrated sodium aluminum silicate), "faujasite" (which is hydrated sodium potassium calcium magnesium aluminum silicate), "harmotome" (which is hydrated barium aluminum silicate), "heulandite" (which is hydrated sodium calcium aluminum silicate), "laumontite" (which is hydrated calcium aluminum silicate), "mesolite" (which is hydrated sodium calcium aluminum silicate), "natrolite" (which is hydrated sodium aluminum silicate), "paulingite" (which is hydrated potassium sodium calcium barium aluminum silicate), "phillipsite" (which is hydrated potassium sodium calcium aluminum silicate), "scolecite" (which is hydrated calcium aluminum silicate), "stellerite" (which is hydrated calcium aluminum silicate), "stilbite" (which is hydrated sodium calcium aluminum silicate), and "thomsonite" (which is hydrated sodium calcium aluminum silicate), and combinations thereof. In certain embodiments, suitable zeolites for use in the present invention include chabazite and clinoptilolite. An example of a suitable source of zeolite is available from the C2C Zeolite Corporation of Calgary, Canada. The zeolite is present in an amount of 25% by weight. Methods The settable compositions of the present invention may be used in a variety of subterranean applications, including, but not limited to, primary cementing, remedial cementing, and drilling operations. The settable compositions of the present invention also may be used in surface applications, for example, construction cementing. An example of a method comprises providing a settable composition according to claim 1; placing the settable composition in a location to be cemented; and allowing the settable composition to set therein. In some embodiments, the location to be cemented may be above ground, for example, in construction cementing. The location to be cemented may be in a subterranean formation, for example, in subterranean applications. Another example of a method is a method of cementing a pipe string (e.g., casing, expandable casing, liners, etc.) disposed in a well bore. An example of such a method may comprise providing a settable composition comprising water and CKD; introducing the settable composition into the annulus between the pipe string and a wall of the well bore; and allowing the settable composition to set in the annulus to form a hardened mass. Generally, in most instances, the hardened mass should fix the pipe string in the well bore. Another example of a method is method of sealing a portion of a gravel pack or a portion of a subterranean formation. An example of such a method may comprise providing a settable composition comprising water and CKD; introducing the settable composition into the portion of the gravel pack or the portion of the subterranean formation; and allowing the settable composition to form a hardened mass in the portion. The portions of the subterranean formation may include permeable portions of the formation and fractures (natural or otherwise) in the formation and other portions of the formation that may allow the undesired flow of fluid into, or from, the well bore. The portions of the gravel pack include those portions of the gravel pack, wherein it is desired to prevent the undesired flow of fluids into, or from, the well bore. Among other things, this method may allow the sealing of the portion of the gravel pack to prevent the undesired flow of fluids without requiring the gravel pack's removal. Another example of a method is a method of sealing voids located in a pipe string (e.g., casing, expandable casings, liners, etc.) or in a cement sheath. Generally, the pipe string will be disposed in a well bore, and the cement sheath may be located in the annulus between the pipe string disposed in the well bore and a wall of the well bore. An example of such a method may comprise providing a settable composition comprising water and CKD; introducing the settable composition into the void; and allowing the settable composition to set to form a hardened mass in the void. When sealing a void in a pipe string, the methods further may comprise locating the void in the pipe string; and isolating the void by defining a space within the pipe string in communication with the void; wherein the settable composition may be introduced into the void from the space. The void may be isolated using any suitable technique and/or apparatus, including bridge plugs, packers, and the like. The void in the pipe string may be located using any suitable technique. When sealing a void in the cement sheath, the methods further may comprise locating the void in the cement sheath; producing a perforation in the pipe string that intersects the void; and isolating the void by defining a space within the pipe string in communication with the void via the perforation, wherein the settable composition is introduced into the void via the perforation. The void in the pipe string may be located using any suitable technique. The perforation may be created in the pipe string using any suitable technique, for example, perforating guns. The void may be isolated using any suitable technique and/or apparatus, including bridge plugs, packers, and the like. Another example of a method is a method of changing the direction of drilling a well bore. An example of such a method may comprise providing a settable composition comprising CKD; introducing the settable composition into the well bore at a location in the well bore wherein the direction of drilling is to be changed; allowing the settable composition to set to form a kickoff plug in the well bore; drilling a hole in the kickoff plug; and drilling of the well bore through the hole in the kickoff plug. Generally, the drilling operation should continue in the direction of the hole drilled through the kickoff plug. The well bore and hole in the kickoff plug may be drilled using any suitable technique, including rotary drilling, cable tool drilling, and the like. One or more oriented directional drilling tools may be placed adjacent to the kickoff plug. Suitable directional drilling tools include, but are not limited to, whip-stocks, bent sub-downhole motorized drill combinations, and the like. The direction drilling tools then may be used to drill the hole in the kickoff plug so that the hole is positioned in the desired direction. Optionally, the directional drilling tool may be removed from the well bore subsequent to drilling the hole in the kickoff plug. To facilitate a better understanding of the present invention, the following examples of certain aspects of some embodiments are given. In no way should the following examples be read to limit, or define, the scope of the invention.
