The present invention relates to a screw-type jewellery lock. More particularly, the invention relates to a screw-type jewellery lock which is used for preventing ornamental members from slithering over the chain-type jewellery member. Background of Invention: Chain-type jewellery is generally used to encircle various body parts, like neck, wrists, ankles, waist etc. This type of jewellery mainly comprises of a fine metallic chain, usually gold, silver, platinum or white gold, more recently even steel has been used as low cost alternative, for daily jewellery or costume jewellery. The chains are often ornamented by a variety of pendants or, at times, a plurality of beads are strung together to form decorative patter over the chain. Beads are generally pierced for threading or stringing. Beads range in size from under 1 millimetre (0.039 in) to over centimetre (0.39 in) in diameter. The bores, generally have a larger diameter than the chain to facilitate easy sliding over the chain while manufacturing. Size of bead is 5mm to mm diameter and the inner diameter (hole) is 3 mm to 5 mm. The chain is 2.8 to 3 mm the bead does not tilt Bore diameter of beads being larger than the chain diameter they usually slither throughout the length of chain, if chain is manufactured as a single piece. Most commercial chains are not manufactured as single piece. They are normally provided with a locking mechanism, such as a hook, referred to as hook and eye clasps or other locking mechanisms like a box clasps, lobster clasp, magnetic clasp, S-hook / S-clasps, spring ring clasp, tube-bar clasp or a toogle clasps. The main intention of these locks is to keep the chain shape intact and make them easy to wear and easy to remove. Of the various types of jewellery locks available, a toogle clasp, or toogle, is very commonly used, mainly for their functionality and for their contribution to the overall design of the piece of jewellery. Toogle has been in use since it was first disclosed in US Patent No. 906616, filed by E. A. Coxin April, 1908 and granted in December, 1908. US Patent No. 4358924, more particularly discloses a toogle clasp lock system more particularly the said patent discloses toogle locks for jewellery chains. The toogle used herein does not provide a customizability of the ornamentation of chain. US Patent No. 7093332 disclosed an improved toogle clasp, with an locking arrangement, such that the T-part of toogle would not slip out, thereby opening the lock. The patent provides no means for customizability. With a view of providing customizability and improved ease of use the inventor of present invention has provided a novel locking mechanism for toogle-clasp which, along with customizability provides a safety to delicate ornamental beads which have been incorporated therein. Summary of Invention: The present invention provides a novel screw-type toogle clasp, wherein the eyehole (1) has a tapped portion (11) which complementarily fits over a threaded projection (21) of the chain (2), thereby improving safety and customizability of ornament. Brief description of Drawings: Fig. 1 depicts a chain-type ornament comprising an eyehole (1), a chain (2) and a T-bar (3). Fig. 2 depicts a magnified version of eye-hole (1), wherein the eye-hole comprises of an even periphery (22). The figure further shows a tapped projection 11 and a compatible threaded region of the chain (2) marked as 21. Fig. 3 depicts the magnified version of T-bar (3) Fig. 4 shows a magnified version of eyehole (1) Fig. 5 shows a modified embodiment of eyehole (1) wherein the tapped-region (11) is integrated broader periphery (51). Fig. 6 shows various embodiments of the eyehole (1) and T-bar (3) Fig. 7 shows embodiments of screw type toogle clasp incorporated in jewellery. Derailed description of Invention: The present invention describes an improved toogle-clasp which substantially improves customer experience, since toogle clasp is easier for customers to wear a bracelet or any other chain-type ornament by themselves. Further, the eyehole (1) is provided by a tapped projection/region (1 1) which is screwed over the threaded end (21), prevents beads made of delicate material, including but not limited to lamp-work glass, crystal, slithering down the chain and breaking. With reference to Fig. 1 and Fig. 2, the present invention describes an improved toogleclasp comprising a eyehole (1) and a T-bar (3). The screw-type locking mechanism comprising a tapped projection/region (11) and threaded projection (21) incorporates a customizability of the ornamentations which are added over the chain (2). Further, the screw-type locking mechanism helps in securing the ornamentation against slithering over the chain and hitting the ground and breaking, which might be result of pulling the toggle open. The diameter of eyehole being grater then the diameter of chain, the ornamentation is secured by the eyehole. In an embodiment, the eyehole is attached to a first terminal of chain (2), through a connection mechanism comprising a tapped region (1 1) affixed to the periphery (22) of the said eyehole (1) and a threaded projection (21). In another embodiment, the tapped region (11) of connection mechanism is integrated with the periphery of the eyehole, whereby the periphery (51) is broader proximate to the tapped region as shown in Fig. In yet another embodiment as illustrated in Fig. 6, embellishments are cut out on the flat surface of the eyehole (1). As seen in Fig. 7, opportunity for branding is provided by means of imprinting the brand tags or emblems on the flat surface of the said eyehole (1). In further embodiments, the chain (2) is worn around one’s neck, wrist, waist, ankles or any part of human body optionally carrying pendants, beads, charms, gemstones or any heavy/precious jewellery attachments. This screw type toogle clasp is enabled to be incorporated in chains having identification tags for pets or other bred animals. In a further embodiment, the present invention can be incorporated in any suitable device to be used in a secured manner for personal, ornamental, security based or industrial application such as binding chains to prevent accidental slipping or removal of things held by them.
