In another embodiment, the compositions of the present invention comprising HCFC-244bb may further comprise at least one compound selected from the group consisting of HCFC-243db and HFC-245fa. The series of reactions that may form the compositions of the present invention are shown in FIG. 1. The sequence of steps begins with the chorination of propylene by reaction with chlorine, Cl2 to form allyl chloride or HCO-1260zf (CH2=CHCH2Cl). The next step involves further chlorination in the presence of Cl2 to product HCC-260db (CH2ClCHClCH2Cl). Reaction of HCC-260db with aqueous NaOH (or other caustic solution) forms HCO-1250xf (CH2=CClCH2Cl). And reaction of HCO-1250xf with chlorine, Cl2 produces HCC-250aa (CH2ClCCl2CH2Cl, or 1,2,2,3-tetrachloropropane). Further chlorination with Cl2 will produce HCC-240da (CHCl2CCl2CH2Cl). Reaction of HCC-240da with aqueous NaOH (or other caustic solution) will form HCO-1230xa (CCl2═CClCH2Cl). In another embodiment, any of the compositions as described previously may additionally comprise hydrogen fluoride (HF), due to the presence of HF as either a reactant or a by-product of the reaction chemistry to produce each composition. Of note are composiitons which are free of HCl, compositions which are free of HF and compositions which are free of both HCl and HF. Of particular note are compositions which are acid free. Acids can be removed by processes known in the art such as distillation and water or caustic washing. Fluorination of HCO-1230xa The HCO-1230xa may be fluorinated by reaction with hydrogen fluoride (HF) in the presence of a catalyst to produce HCFO-1233xf. This reaction is shown in FIG. 1. The fluorochlorination reaction may be carried out in the liquid or vapor phase. For liquid phase embodiments of the invention, the reaction of HCO-1230xa with HF may be conducted in a liquid-phase reactor operating in batch, semi-batch, semi-continuous, or continuous modes. In the batch mode, HCO-1230xa and HF are combined in an autoclave or other suitable reaction vessel and heated to the desired temperature. In one embodiment, this reaction is carried out in semi-batch mode by feeding HCO-1230xa to a liquid-phase reactor containing HF. In another embodiment, HF may be fed to a liquid-phase reactor containing a mixture of HCO-1230xa and reaction products formed by reacting HF and HCO-1230xa. In another embodiment of the liquid-phase process, HF and HCO-1230xa may be fed concurrently in the desired stoichiometric ratio to the reactor containing a mixture of HF and reaction products formed by reacting HF and HCO-1230xa. Suitable temperatures for the reaction of HF with HCO-1230xa in the liquid-phase reactor are, in one embodiment, from about 80° C. to about 180° C., and in another embodiment, from about 100° C. to about 150° C. Higher temperatures typically result in greater conversion of the HCO-1230xa. A suitable molar ratio of HF to total amount of HCO-1230xa fed to the liquid-phase reactor is, in one embodiment, at least stoichiometric (about 3:1, HF to HCO-1230xa) and in another embodiment, is from about 5:1 to about 100:1. Of note are embodiments wherein the molar ratio of HF to HFO-1243zf is from about 8:1 to about 50:1. The reactor pressure in the liquid-phase process is not critical and in batch reactions is usually the autogenous pressure of the system at the reaction temperature. The pressure of the system increases as hydrogen chloride is formed by replacement of hydrogen substituents by chlorine, and by replacement of chlorine substituents by fluorine in the starting materials and intermediate reaction products. In a continuous process it is possible to set the pressure of the reactor in such a way that the lower boiling products of the reaction are vented from the reactor, optionally through a packed column or condenser. In this manner, higher boiling intermediates remain in the reactor and the volatile products are removed. Typical reactor pressures are from about 20 psig (239 kPa) to about 1,000 psig (6,994 kPa). In some embodiments, in which the reaction is conducted using a liquid-phase process, catalysts which may be used include carbon, AlF3, BF3, FeCl3-aFa (where a=0 to 3), FeX3 supported on carbon, SbCl3-aFa, AsF3, MCl5-bFb (where b=0 to 5 and M=Sb, Nb, Ta, or Mo), and M′Cl4-cFc (where c=0 to 4, and M′=Sn, Ti, Zr, or Hf). In another embodiment, catalysts for the liquid phase process are MCl5-bFb (where b=0 to 5 and M=Sb, Nb, or Ta). In another embodiment, the reaction of HF with HCO-1230xa is carried out in the vapor phase. Typically a heated reactor is used. A number of reactor configurations are possible including horizontal or vertical orientation of the reactor as well as the sequence of reaction of the HCO-1230xa with HF. In one embodiment of the invention, the HCO-1230xa may be initially vaporized and fed to the reactor as a gas. Suitable temperatures for the vapor-phase reaction are from about 120° C. to about 500° C. Higher temperatures result in greater conversion of HCO-1230xa and higher degrees of fluorination and halogenation in the converted compounds. Suitable reactor pressures for the vapor-phase reactor may be from about 1 to about 30 atmospheres. A pressure of about 15 to about 25 atmospheres may be advantageously employed to facilitate separation of HCl from other reaction products, and the suitable reaction time may vary from about 1 to about 120 seconds, preferably from about 5 to about 60 seconds. The molar ratio of HF to the total amount of HCO-1230xa for the vapor-phase reaction is, in one embodiment, from about the stoichiometric ratio of HF to the total amount of HCO-1230xa (3:1 HF to HCO-1230xa) to about 50:1 and, in another embodiment, from about 10:1 to about 30:1. In one embodiment, a catalyst is used in the reaction zone for the vapor-phase reaction of HF with (3:1 HF to HCO-1230xa).

In one embodiment, when used on a support, the total metal content of the catalyst will be from about 0.1 to about 20 percent by weight based on the total weight of the catalyst; in another embodiment from about 0.1 to about 10 percent by weight based on the total weight of the catalyst. Suitable chlorofluorination catalysts for the vapor-phase reactions include chromium-containing catalysts including chromium(III) oxide (Cr2O3); Cr2O3 with other metals such as magnesium halides or zinc halides supported on Cr2O3; chromium(III) halides supported on carbon; mixtures of chromium and magnesium (including elemental metals, metal oxides, metal halides, and/or other metal salts) optionally supported on graphite; and mixtures of chromium and other metals (including elemental metals, metal oxides, metal halides, and/or other metal salts) optionally supported on graphite, alumina, or aluminum halides such as aluminum fluoride. Chromium-containing catalysts are well known in the art. They may be prepared by either precipitation methods or impregnation methods as generally described by Satterfield on pages 87-112 in Heterogeneous Catalysis in Industrial Practice, 2nd edition (McGraw-Hill, New York, 1991). Of note are chlorofluorination catalysts that comprise at least one chromium-containing component selected from the group consisting of crystalline alpha-chromium oxide where from about 0.05 atom % to about 6 atom % of the chromium atoms in the alpha-chromium oxide lattice are replaced by trivalent cobalt atoms, and crystalline alpha-chromium oxide where from about 0.05 atom % to about 6 atom % of the chromium atoms in the alpha-chromium oxide lattice are replaced by trivalent cobalt atoms which has been treated with a fluorinating agent.

No. 5,036,036. Optionally, the metal-containing catalysts described above can be pretreated with HF. This pretreatment can be accomplished, for example, by placing the metal-containing catalyst in a suitable container, and thereafter, passing HF over the metal-containing catalyst. In one embodiment, such container can be the reactor used to perform the chlorofluorination reaction. In one embodiment, the pretreatment time is from about 15 to about 300 minutes, and the pretreatment temperature is from about 200° C. to about 450° C.

Utility The compositions disclosed herein comprising HFO-1234yf are useful as low global warming potential (GWP) heat transfer compositions, aerosol propellant, foam expansion agents (also known as foaming agents or blowing agents), solvents, cleaning agents, carrier fluids, displacement drying agents, buffing abrasion agents, polymerization media, foaming agents for polyolefins and polyurethane, gaseous dielectrics, extinguishing agents, and fire suppression agents in liquid or gaseous form. The disclosed compositions can act as a working fluid used to carry heat from a heat source to a heat sink. Such heat transfer compositions may also be useful as a refrigerant in a cycle wherein the fluid undergoes a phase change; that is, from a liquid to a gas and back or vice versa. Examples of heat transfer systems include but are not limited to air conditioners, freezers, refrigerators, heat pumps, water chillers, flooded evaporator chillers, direct expansion chillers, walk-in coolers, heat pumps, mobile refrigerators, mobile air conditioning units and combinations thereof. In one embodiment, the compositions comprising HFO-1234yf are useful in mobile heat transfer systems, including refrigeration, air conditioning, or heat pump systems or apparatus. In another embodiment, the compositions are useful in stationary heat transfer systems, including refrigeration, air conditioning, or heat pump systems or apparatus. As used herein, mobile heat transfer systems refers to any refrigeration, air conditioner, or heating apparatus incorporated into a transportation unit for the road, rail, sea or air. In addition, mobile refrigeration or air conditioner units, include those apparatus that are independent of any moving carrier and are known as “intermodal” systems. Such intermodal systems include “containers’ (combined sea/land transport) as well as “swap bodies” (combined road/rail transport). As used herein, stationary heat transfer systems are systems that are fixed in place during operation. A stationary heat transfer system may be associated within or attached to buildings of any variety or may be stand alone devices located out of doors, such as a soft drink vending machine. These stationary applications may be stationary air conditioning and heat pumps (including but not limited to chillers, high temperature heat pumps, residential, commercial or industrial air conditioning systems, and including window, ductless, ducted, packaged terminal, chillers, and those exterior but connected to the building such as rooftop systems). In stationary refrigeration applications, the disclosed compositions may be useful in high temperature, medium temperature and/or low temperature refrigeration equipment including commercial, industrial or residential refrigerators and freezers, ice machines, self-contained coolers and freezers, flooded evaporator chillers, direct expansion chillers, walk-in and reach-in coolers and freezers, and combination systems. In some embodiments, the disclosed compositions may be used in supermarket refrigerator systems. Therefore in accordance with the present invention, the compositions as disclosed herein containing HFO-1234yf may be useful in methods for producing cooling, producing heat, and transferring heat. The compositions disclosed herein may be useful as low global warming potential (GWP) replacements for currently used refrigerants, including but not limited to R134a (or HFC-134a, 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane), R22 (or HCFC-22, chlorodifluoromethane), R12 (CFC-12, dichlorodifluoromethane); R407C (ASHRAE designation for a blend of 52 weight percent R134a, 25 weight percent R125 (pentafluoroethane), and 23 weight percent R32 (difluoromethane)); R410A (ASHRAE designation for a blend of 50 weight percent R125 and 50 weight percent R32); and R404A (ASHRAE designation for a blend of 44 weight percent R125, 52 weight percent R143a (1,1,1-trifluoroethane), and 4.0 weight percent R134a), among others. In many applications, some embodiments of the present compositions comprising HFO-1234yf are useful as refrigerants and provide at least comparable cooling performance (meaning cooling capacity and energy efficiency) as the refrigerant for which a replacement is being sought. In another embodiment is provided a method for recharging a heat transfer system that contains a refrigerant to be replaced and a lubricant, said method comprising removing the refrigerant to be replaced from the heat transfer system while retaining a substantial portion of the lubricant in said system and introducing one of the present compositions comprising HFO-1234yf to the heat transfer system. In another embodiment, a heat exchange system containing any of the present compositions comprising HFO-1234yf is provided, wherein said system is selected from the group consisting of air conditioners, freezers, refrigerators, heat pumps, water chillers, flooded evaporator chillers, direct expansion chillers, walk-in coolers, heat pumps, mobile refrigerators, mobile air conditioning units, and systems having combinations thereof. Additionally, the compositions comprising HFO-1234yf may be useful in secondary loop systems wherein these compositions serve as the primary refrigerant thus providing cooling to a secondary heat transfer fluid that thereby cools a remote location. Vapor-compression refrigeration, air-conditioning, or heat pump systems include an evaporator, a compressor, a condenser, and an expansion device. A vapor-compression cycle re-uses refrigerant in multiple steps producing a cooling effect in one step and a heating effect in a different step. The cycle can be described simply as follows. Liquid refrigerant enters an evaporator through an expansion device, and the liquid refrigerant boils in the evaporator, by withdrawing heat from the environment, at a low temperature to form a gas and produce cooling. The low-pressure gas enters a compressor where the gas is compressed to raise its pressure and temperature. The higher-pressure (compressed) gaseous refrigerant then enters the condenser in which the refrigerant condenses and discharges its heat to the environment. The refrigerant returns to the expansion device through which the liquid expands from the higher-pressure level in the condenser to the low-pressure level in the evaporator, thus repeating the cycle. In one embodiment, there is provided a heat transfer system containing any of the present compositions comprising HFO-1234yf. In another embodiment is disclosed a refrigeration, air-conditioning or heat pump apparatus containing any of the present compositions comprising HFO-1234yf.

EXAMPLES General Procedure for Product Analysis The following general procedure is illustrative of the method used for analyzing the products of fluorination reactions. Part of the total reactor effluent was sampled on-line for organic product analysis using a gas chromatograph equipped with a mass selective detector (GC/MS). The gas chromatography utilized a 20 ft. (6.1 m) long×⅛ in. (0.32 cm) diameter tube containing perfluorinated polyether sold under the trademark Krytox® by E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (hereinafter “DuPont”) of Wilmington, Del. on an inert carbon support. The helium flow was 30 mL/min (5.0×10−7 m3/sec). Gas chromatographic conditions were 60° C. for an initial hold period of three minutes followed by temperature programming to 200° C. at a rate of 6° C./minute. Example 1 Fluorination of HCFO-1233xf to HCFC-244bb The contents of a small PTFE vial containing 20 grams of viscous SbF5 were poured into a dry 400 mL Hastelloy® shaker tube. The tube was closed and was pressurized with nitrogen for leak testing. The shaker tube was then cooled to less than −40° C. with dry ice, slowly vented, and then evacuated. 75 grams (3.75-moles) of anhydrous HF was condensed into the shaker tube followed by 165 grams (1.26-moles) of HCFO-1233xf. The shaker tube was placed in a barricade and shaking was started. The shaker tube was agitated at ambient temperature (˜20-23° C.) and the pressure was 21 to 25 psig. After 2 hours, shaking was stopped and 150 mL of water was carefully pumped into the shaker tube. The tube was left overnight and then cooled to 0 to 5° C. in an ice bath before depressurization and transferring the contents to a plastic container. The container was kept on ice. The container contents were poured into a polypropylene separatory funnel containing some ice. The lower organic layer was light amber in appearance. The organic layer was separated into a media bottle made of a glass sold under the trademark of Pyrex® by Corning (Lowell, Mass.) (hereinafter “Pyrex®”) containing ˜50-mL of 4 molar (pH 7) phosphate buffer and ice (˜100-mL). The organic layer was again separated and poured into a dry Pyrex® media bottle containing a small amount of anhydrous magnesium sulfate. Crude yield was 164.3 grams (about 120-mL, 86%). GC/MS of the crude material showed that it was mostly HCFC-244bb. Other components included 0.16% 1233xf, and other byproducts totaling 12.2%. Example 2 Fluorination of HCFO-1233xf to HCFC-244bb The contents of a small PTFE vial containing 20 grams of viscous SbF5 were poured into a dry 400-mL Hastelloy® shaker tube. The tube was closed and was pressurized with nitrogen for leak testing. The shaker tube was then cooled to less than −40° C. with dry ice, slowly vented, and then evacuated. 53 grams (2.65 moles) of anhydrous HF was transferred into the shaker tube followed by 227 grams (1.74 moles) of HCFO-1233xf was condensed into the chilled shaker tube. The shaker tube was placed in the barricade and shaking was started. The shaker tube was agitated at ambient temperature (˜18-21° C.) and the pressure was 16 to 20 psig. After 2 hours, shaking was stopped and 100 mL of water was carefully pumped into the shaker tube. The tube was left overnight and cooled to 0 to 5° C. in an ice bath before venting and transferring the contents to a plastic container. The container was kept on ice. The container contents were poured into a polypropylene separatory funnel containing some ice. The lower organic layer was light amber in appearance. The organic layer was separated into a Pyrex® media bottle containing about 50 mL of 4 molar (pH 7) phosphate buffer and ice (˜100-mL). The organic layer was again separated and poured into a dry Pyrex® media bottle containing a small amount of anhydrous magnesium sulfate. Crude yield was 238.8 grams (about 170-mL, 91%). GC/MS of the crude material indicated that it was mostly HCFC-244bb. Other components included 0.11% HFC-245cb, 0.10% HFC-245eb, 0.26% HCFO-1233xf, and other byproducts totaling 9.7%.
