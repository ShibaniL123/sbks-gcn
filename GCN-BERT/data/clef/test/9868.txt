STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT N/A BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention The present disclosure relates to wearable materials and items, and in particular swimsuit, intended to help the wearer shape the female body. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION An object of the present invention is to provide a swimsuit with integrated molding adapted to cover the female upper body and thigh, the integrated molding comprising several tension straps and compressed fabric to highlight the shapes of some female body. A further object is to provide a swimsuit with integrated molding which comprise a limited number of components, are easy and quick to produce and can be manufactured industrially with fabrics of conventional type. A further object is to provide a swimsuit integrated molding which for the appropriate size are adaptable to the different forms of the abdomen, buttocks and thigh of the wearer of the swimsuit. The invention itself, both as to its configuration and its mode of operation will be best understood, and additional objects and advantages thereof will become apparent, by the following detailed description of a preferred embodiment taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawing. The Applicant hereby asserts, that the disclosure of the present application may include more than one invention, and, in the event that there is more than one invention, that these inventions may be patentable and non-obvious one with respect to the other. Further, the purpose of the accompanying abstract is to enable the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and the public generally, and especially the scientists, engineers, and practitioners in the art who are not familiar with patent or legal terms or phraseology, to determine quickly from a cursory inspection the nature and essence of the technical disclosure of the application. The abstract is neither intended to define the invention of the application, which is measured by the claims, nor is it intended to be limiting as to the scope of the invention in any way. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS The accompanying drawings which are incorporated herein constitute part of the specifications and illustrate the preferred embodiment of the invention. FIG. 1 is a side view of the first exemplary swimsuit with integrated molding in accordance with the principles of the present disclosure. FIG. 2 is a front view of the first exemplary swimsuit with integrated molding in accordance with the principles of the present disclosure. FIG. 3 is a back view of the first exemplary swimsuit with integrated molding in accordance with the principles of the present disclosure. FIG. 4 is a front view of the first exemplary swimsuit with integrated molding and external fabric in accordance with the principles of the present disclosure. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT FIG. 1 is directed to the first embodiment of the present invention including a swimsuit 1 with integrated molding. The swimsuit comprises a top part 2 and a bottom part 3. The top part comprises at least a main strap 10 supporting the swimsuit under the female chest. It important to understand that the preferred embodiment is directed to the body parts under the female breasts. The female breast may be cover by a top bikini cover portion or any other top cover part selected to be combined with the swimsuit 1. The top part 2 is preferably made of a first fabric comprising compressing characteristics which extends from the hips up to the female breast. The top part 2 further includes back straps 11 for providing more adjustable top part 2. The straps 11 are made of an elastic material that does not wrinkle. The top part 2 material, more particularly the top front portion 2a, further compresses uniformly the female's abdomen to avoid wrinkles due to body fat as shown in FIG. 2. As mentioned before the back straps 11 assists the compression of female's abdomen in combination with the top front portion 2a. The front portion 2a further extends to the females groin area. Pressure is also exerted at this portion of the body. The bottom part 3 is more directed to the thighs and buttocks. A second fabric having compressing characteristics is use to cover the thigh. However, as shown in FIG. 3 the buttocks 4 area comprises a third fabric that in more flexible than the second fabric. The purpose of a more flexible third fabric is because the expansion and movement of skin on the area of the buttocks is more frequent. Also is the skins contraction and expansion on the buttocks area is more prominent than at the thigh. The bottom part 3 comprises at least two leg compartments 3a made of the second fabric with straps at each end 100. The straps 100 avoid unwanted displacement of each leg compartment 3a. The top part 2 and bottom part 3 are coupled in such way that no bumps are easily identified between these two sections. Several sewing technics are used to avoid unwanted bumps at the connection between fabrics. It is important to understand that all part of the swimsuit 1, including the female breast may be covered with an external fabric 5 in order to cover differences between fabrics of the integrated molding, as shown in FIG. 4. While the invention has been described as having a preferred design, modifications, variations and other uses and applications of the subject invention will, however, become apparent to those skilled in the art without materially departing from the novel teachings and advantages of this invention after considering this specification together with the accompanying drawings. Accordingly, all such changes, modifications, variations and other uses and applications which do not depart from the spirit and scope of the invention are deemed to be covered by this invention as defined in the following claims and their legal equivalents. In the claims, means-plus-function clauses, if any, are intended to cover the structures described herein as performing the recited function and not only structural equivalents but also equivalent structures. All of the patents, patent applications, and publications recited herein, and in the Declaration attached hereto, if any, are hereby incorporated by reference as if set forth in their entirety herein. All, or substantially all, the components disclosed in such patents may be used in the embodiments of the present invention, as well as equivalents thereof. The details in the patents, patent applications, and publications incorporated by reference herein may be considered to be incorporable at applicant's option, into the claims during prosecution as further limitations in the claims to patentable distinguish any amended claims from any applied prior art. 1.
