TECHNICAL FIELD This invention relates to therapeutics, their uses and methods for the treatment of viral infection, cancer treatment or neurodegenerative disease treatment. In particular the invention relates to therapies and methods of treatment for HIV infection, adenovirus infection, colon cancer and spinal muscular atrophy. BACKGROUND The Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) affects approximately 33 million people worldwide, with two thirds of those infected living in Sub-Saharan Africa. HIV is the causative agent of the Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS), a condition where selective invasion of helper T cells (CD4+T cells) by the virus leads to progressive destruction of the immune system, leaving the victim vulnerable to life threatening opportunistic infections. About 1.8 million people die per year due to AIDS, and until the mid-1990s, the life expectancy for patients with AIDS was one to two years. However, with access to Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy (HAART), otherwise known as drug combination therapy, the situation has dramatically changed. By simultaneously taking several drugs that target the viral entry and/or the viral enzymes reverse transcriptase (RT), integrase and protease, viral loads are reduced to undetectable levels. In this context, in developed countries HIV is treated as a chronic infection, rather than a life threatening illness. In common with other viruses, HIV cannot ensure its own replication. Therefore, upon entry into the host cell it must take control of the cell machinery in order to replicate. The virus first attaches to a host cell receptor CD4, then interacts with CCR5 and/or CXCR4 co- receptors, and this is followed by virus-cell fusion. The viral capsid is released into the cytoplasm of the host cell where it is uncoated, releasing the viral enzymes and viral RNA. The single stranded viral RNA is then converted to a double stranded complimentary viral DNA (cDNA) by the viral enzyme RT. The cDNA is translocated to the nucleus where it is incorporated into the host DNA, this step is facilitated by the viral enzyme integrase. To produce new viral particles the integrated viral DNA must be first transcribed into mRNA in the nucleus and then translated into the viral protein Gag-Pol, in the cytoplasm. Gag-Pol is then cleaved by the viral enzyme protease into gag, gag-pol and env. Further processing by protease yields the remaining essential, structural HIV-i proteins. The viral proteins then assemble at the cell membrane and bud off as a new immature virus. The three key enzymes, RT, integrase and protease, in the HIV replication cycle are the major targets against which most anti-HIV/AIDS drugs have been developed. Different drugs target different parts of the HIV life cycle (for example, Maraviroc and Enfuvirtide target virus entry; Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) = Zidovudine, Didanosine, Zalcitabine, Stavudine, Abacavir, Emtricitabine, Entecavir, Apricitabine - Nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NtRTI) = Tenofovir, Adefovir - Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) = Efavirenz, Nevirapine, Delavirdine, Etravirine, Rilpivirine target Reverse Transcriptase (RT); Raltegravir targets Integrase; and Saquinavir, Ritonavir, Indinavir, Nelfmavir, and Amprenavir target Protease). Currently, 29 RT and protease inhibitors and the integrase inhibitor Raltegravir are being used in anti-HIV/AIDS therapy in HAART. The HIV drug combination therapy inhibits the viral enzymes from performing their vital roles in the HJV-i replication cycle. There are also 2 entry inhibitors (Maraviroc and Enfuvirtide) used in HAART which interfere with the binding, fusion and entry of HIV into a cell. It is important to note that the selection of drugs in a combination therapy as well as the dosing regimen for each drug is tailored to the individual patient because the combination of drugs must block replication of all HIV variants present. Treatment is also guided by an individual's viral load and CD4 counts. Unfortunately, long term use of HAART is limited by issues of drug compliance, toxic side effects and drug resistance. This reality underscores the continuing need for new and accessible drugs, and in particular, those acting through new, and as of yet unexplored, mechanisms of action. Following transcription from the integrated HIV genome, the 9 kb HIV primary transcript is spliced and alternatively spliced through the use of four 5' splice sites (Di to D4) and eight 3' splice sites (Ai, A2, A3, A4a, Α- , A4c, A5 andAz) to produce 15 viral proteins. Among these, auxiliary proteins such as Tat, Rev and Nef, will respectively stimulate HIV transcription, allow transport to the cytoplasm of unspliced and partially spliced transcripts encoding viral enzymes and structural proteins, and ensure full virulence in the host (Li, L, H. S. Li, et al. (2005). "Roles of HIV-i auxiliary proteins in viral pathogenesis and host-pathogen interactions." Cell Res 15(11-12): 923-934; Karn, J. and C. M. Stoltzfus (2012). "Transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation of HIV-i gene expression." Cold Spring Harb Perspect Med 2(2): 3006916.). The production of Tat, Rev and Nef must therefore be exquisitely controlled, and splicing imbalances can severely compromise HIV replication (Tazi, J., N. Bakkour, et al. (2010). "Alternative splicing: regulation of HIV-i multiplication as a target for therapeutic action." FEBS J 277(4): 867-876). A variety of cellular hnRNP and SR proteins have been implicated in the control of HIV splicing (Stoltzfus, C. M. (2009). "Chapter 1. Regulation of HIV-i alternative RNA splicing and its role in virus replication." Adv Virus Res 74: 1-40; and Stoltzfus, C. M. and J. M. Madsen (2006). "Role of viral splicing elements and cellular RNA binding proteins in regulation of HIV-i alternative RNA splicing." Curr HIV Res 4(1): 43-55). Targeting the expression or activity of these classes of proteins could provide novel anti-HIV strategies. Although hnRNP and SR proteins also regulate the alternative splicing of cellular pre-mRNAs (Bakkour, N., Y. L. Lin, et al. (2007). "Small-molecule inhibition of HIV pre-mRNA splicing as a novel antiretroviral therapy to overcome drug resistance." PLoS Pathog 3(10): 1530- 1539; and Martinez-Contreras, R, P. Cloutier, et al. (2007). "hnRNP proteins and splicing control." Adv Exp Med Biol 623: 123-147), the fact that HIV produces over 40 distinct mRNAs by alternative splicing may render its replication exquisitely sensitive to even slight disturbances in the production of early HIV proteins. Most attempts at altering HIV splicing have focused on SR proteins. The localization and activity of these proteins are controlled by a variety of kinases such as SRPKs and CLKs (Zhou, Z. and X. D. Fu (2013). "Regulation of splicing by SR proteins and SR protein-specific kinases." Chromosoma 122(3): 191-207). A small molecule inhibitor of CLKs can alter HIV RNA processing and inhibit HIV replication (Wong, R., A. Balachandran, et al. (2011). "Differential effect of CLK SR Kinases on HIV-i gene expression: potential novel targets for therapy." Retrovirology 8: 47). Interestingly, digoxin, a drug used to treat congestive heart failure has been shown to modulate the activity of the CLK family of SR protein kinases, that in turn increases the activity of SRSF3 (aka SRp2o) to alter HIV pre-mRNA splicing (Wong, R. W., A. Balachandran, et al. (2013). "Characterization of novel inhibitors of HIV-i replication that function via alteration of viral RNA processing and rev function." Nucleic Acids Res 41(20): 9471-9483). Moreover, an indole derivative that inhibits the function of SRSFi has displayed anti-HIV potency (Soret, J., N. Bakkour, et al. (2005). "Selective modification of alternative splicing by indole derivatives that target serine-arginine-rich protein splicing factors." Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 102(24): 8764-8769; and Bakkour, N., Y. L. Iin, et al. (2007). PLoS Pathog 3(10): 1530- 1539)· SUMMARY This invention is based in part on the fortuitous discovery that compounds described herein modulate HIV infection.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION Described herein are compounds, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof for use in the inhibition of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection (i.e. the prevention and/or treatment of infection by HIV and in the treatment of the resulting acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)). As used herein, the treatment of HIV infection is meant to include both the prevention and/or treatment of infection by HIV. The HIV infection may be either latent or acute. As used herein " - " " is meant to convey that they structure may have a single bond or a carbon and "G" as set out in Formula I. " (hereinafter may be referred to as "a point of attachment bond") denotes a bond that is a point of attachment between two chemical entities, one of which is depicted as being attached to the point of attachment bond and the other of which is not depicted as being attached to the point of attachment bond. For example, " " indicates that the chemical entity "XY" is bonded to another chemical entity via the point of attachment bond. Furthermore, the specific point of attachment to the non-depicted chemical entity may be specified by inference. For example, the compound CH3-R3, wherein " infers that when R3 is "XY", the point of attachment bond is the same bond as the bond by which R3 is depicted as being bonded to CH3. The term "latent HIV infection," as used herein, refers to the cellular latency of HIV infection, as contrasted with clinical latency ( i.e., the dormancy of HIV in resting memory CD4 T cells and other cells, including but not limited to monocyte/macrophages, neural cells (including glial cells and astrocytes), as well as the cells of the reproductive system). Latency ends when the virus starts to actively replicate within the subject. As used herein, the phrase "Cx-Cy alkyl" is used as it is normally understood to a person of skill in the art and often refers to a chemical entity that has a carbon skeleton or main carbon chain comprising a number from x to y (with all individual integers within the range included, including integers x and y) of carbon atoms. For example a "d-C10 alkyl" is a chemical entity that has 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 carbon atom(s) in its carbon skeleton or main chain. The term "acute HIV infection," as used herein, refers to the active replication of the HIV within the subject. There are provided methods of treating and a pharmaceutical composition for treating HIV infection and AIDS. The treatment may involve the administering to a subject in need of such treatment a pharmaceutical composition comprising a pharmaceutical carrier and a therapeutically-effective amount of a compound described herein. These pharmaceutical compositions may be in the form of orally-administrable suspensions or tablets; nasal sprays; sterile injectable preparations, for example, as sterile injectable aqueous or oleagenous suspensions or suppositories. In some embodiments, compounds of Formula I or Formula II above may be used for systemic treatment of HIV infection. In some embodiments compounds of Formula I or Formula II may be used in the preparation of a medicament or a composition for systemic treatment of HIV infection. In some embodiments, methods of systemically treating HIV infection are also provided. In some embodiments, compounds described herein may be used for the treatment of adenoviral infections, for the treatment of colon cancer, or spinal muscular dystrophy. Alternatively, compound described herein may be used for the treatment of viral infection. Alternatively, compound described herein may be used for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Alternatively, compound described herein may be used for the treatment of cancer. SRSF10 The serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 10 (SRSF10) gene is a member of the serine-arginine (SR) family of proteins, which are involved in the regulation of RNA splicing. The role of SR proteins in regulated splicing is achieved via binding to exonic splicing enhancer sites that may lead to the inclusion of an exon into the spliced mRNA transcript. Alternatively, SR protein binding may induce skipping of an exon leading to its removal from the spliced mRNA transcript. SR proteins are subjected to a reversible phosphorylation/ dephosphorylate cycle during splicing that is required for the assembly of the spliceosome and splicing catalysis (Zhou, Z. and X. D. Fu (2013). "Regulation of splicing by SR proteins and SR protein-specific kinases." Chromosoma 122(3): 191-207). SRSFio has been shown to be a key regulator of alternative splicing that can function as a sequence-dependent splicing activator (Feng, Y., M. Chen, et al. (2008). "Phosphorylation switches the general splicing repressor SRp38 to a sequence-specific activator." Nat Struct Mol Biol 15(10): 1040-1048). The SRSFio homolog in mice has been shown to be involved in splicing events related to adipogenesis and adipocyte differentiation, specifically involving the axini, ACLY, UFPi and lipin 1 genes(Ii, H., Y. Cheng, et al. (2014). "SRSFio regulates alternative splicing and is required for adipocyte differentiation." Mol Cell Biol 34(12): 2198- 2207). In chicken cells, SRSFio was shown to play a regulatory role in variety of splicing events linked to genes involved in cell survival and responses to cellular stress and apoptosis (Zhou, X., W. Wu, et al. (2014). "Transcriptome analysis of alternative splicing events regulated by SRSFio reveals position-dependent splicing modulation." Nucleic Acids Res 42(6): 4019-4030). A variety of studies have also identified SRSFio as a splicing factor involved in the response to heat shock (Shi, Y. and J. L. Manley (2007). "A complex signaling pathway regulates SRp38 phosphorylation and pre-mRNA splicing in response to heat shock." Mol Cell 28(1): 79-90; Shi, Y., K. Nishida, et al. (2011). "Heat shock-induced SRSFio dephosphorylation displays thermotolerance mediated by Hsp27." Mol Cell Biol 31(3): 458- 465; and Shin, C, Y. Feng, et al. (2004). "Dephosphorylated SRp38 acts as a splicing repressor in response to heat shock." Nature 427(6974): 553-558). Recently, SRSFio has been shown to regulate the splicing of Bcl-2-associated transcription factor 1 (BCLAFi) transcript leading to the inclusion of an alternative exonsa. Tissue samples from colorectal cancer patients showed increased SRSFio expression and increased inclusion of the BCLAFi exonsa variant(Zhou, X., X. Li, et al. (2014). "BCLAFi and its splicing regulator SRSFio regulate the tumorigenic potential of colon cancer cells." Nat Commun 5: 4581). Increased expression of SRSFio has also been shown in human endometrial carcinomas and ovarian cancers by immunohistochemical analysis of tumor tissue (Peng, Z. Y, P. J. Xiao, et al. (2011). "NSSRi is regulated by testosterone in the mouse uterus and extensively expressed in endometrial carcinoma." Tumour Biol 32(2): 359-366). SRSFio has been shown to associate with the translocation liposarcoma protein (TLS) and Ewing's sarcoma protein (EWS) in normal cells. The association between SRSFio and TLS has been shown to influence the splicing of adenovirus EiA pre-mRNA (Yang, L., L. J. Embree, et al. (1998). "Oncoprotein TLS interacts with serine-arginine proteins involved in RNA splicing." J Biol Chem 273(43): 27761-27764). The loss of SRSFio splicing activity has also been suggested in certain cancers. Upon the generation of oncogenic fusion proteins of TLS or EWS in myeloid leukemia and sarcomas respectively, the normal recruitment of the SRSFio splicing factor is abrogated, leading to aberrant splicing (Yang, L., L. J. Embree, et al. (2000). "TLS-ERG leukemia fusion protein inhibits RNA splicing mediated by serine- arginine proteins." Mol Cell Biol 20(10): 3345-3354). SRSFio has also been linked to the splicing efficiency of the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) which is involved in cholesterol homeostasis (Ling, I. F. and S. Estus (2010). "Role of SFRS13A in low-density lipoprotein receptor splicing." Hum Mutat 31(6): 702-709) and has been identified as a master regulatory involved in gene regulatory networks in cell culture models of advanced atherosclerosis (Bjorkegren, J. L., S. Hagg, et al. (2014). "Plasma cholesterol-induced lesion networks activated before regression of early, mature, and advanced atherosclerosis." PLoS Genet 10(2): 61004201). The human SRSFio is encoded by the human gene identified as EntrezGene # 10772 and is located at chromosomal location ip36.11. SRSFio is also known as neural-salient SR protein (NSSR); TLS-associated protein with SR repeats (TASR); splicing factor SRp38; TLS- associated serine-arginine protein 1 (TASRi); TLS-associated serine-arginine protein 2 (TASR2); FUS interacting protein (serine-arginine rich) 1 (FUSIPl); FUS interacting protein (serine-arginine rich) 2 (FUSIP2); splicing factor, arginine/serine-rich 13 (SFRS13); serine- arginine repressor protein 4okDa (SRrp4o); splicing factor arginine/serine-rich 13A (SFRS13A); protein phosphatase 1, regulatory subunit 149 (PPP1R149). ΤΚΑ2β The human transformer 2 beta homolog (hTRA2p) is also a member of the serine/arginine protein family that plays a role in mRNA processing and can be expressed as 5 separate mRNA isoforms through alternative splicing. Previous studies have shown that I1TRA2 β controls the alternative splicing of the calcitonin-calcitonin gene-related peptide(Tran, Q., T. P. Coleman, et al. (2003). "Human transformer 2beta and SRp55 interact with a calcitonin- specific splice enhancer." Biochim Biophys Acta 1625(2): 141-152), SMN2 (Hofmann, Y., C. L. Lorson, et al. (2000). "Htra2-beta 1 stimulates an exonic splicing enhancer and can restore full-length SMN expression to survival motor neuron 2 (SMN2)." Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 97(17): 9618-9623) and tau (Glatz, D. C, D. Rujescu, et al. (2006). "The alternative splicing of tau exon 10 and its regulatory proteins CLK2 and TRA2-BETA1 changes in sporadic Alzheimer's disease." J Neurochem 96(3): 635-644) and CD44 (Takeo, K., T. Kawai, et al. (2009). "Oxidative stress-induced alternative splicing of transformer 2beta (SFRS10) and CD44 pre-mRNAs in gastric epithelial cells." Am J Physiol Cell Physiol 297(2): C330-338) often with the involvement of other splicing factors (Tsuda, K., T. Someya, et al. (2011). "Structural basis for the dual RNA-recognition modes of human Tra2-beta RRM." Nucleic Acids Res 39(4): 1538-1553). I1TRA2 β recognizes specific RNA sequences (exonic splicing enhancers) by way of its RNA recognition motif. Previous studies have shown that hTRA2 β is upregulated in response to hypoxic/oxidative stress and in a variety of disease conditions including cancer (Tsukamoto, Y., N. Matsuo, et al. (2001). "Expression of a novel RNA- splicing factor, RA30i/Tra2beta, in vascular lesions and its role in smooth muscle cell proliferation." Am J Pathol 158(5): 1685-1694), arteriosclerosis (Tsukamoto, Y., N. Matsuo, et al. (2001). Am J Pathol 158(5): 1685-1694), age-related macular degeneration (Karunakaran, D. K., A. R. Banday, et al. (2013). "Expression analysis of an evolutionarily conserved alternative splicing factor, Sfrsio, in age-related macular degeneration." PLoS One 8(9): e75964)- A role of I1TRA2 β has also been shown in HIV replication. In a previous study, digoxin was found to suppress HIV gene expression through alteration in the use of specific ΗΓν pre- mRNA splice sites. Protein analysis found that digoxin treatment leads to increased abundance of a higher MW form of hTRA2 β. Overexpression of hTRA2 β resulted in a reduction in all HIV RNA transcripts (Wong, R. W., A. Balachandran, et al. (2013). "Digoxin suppresses HIV-i replication by altering viral RNA processing." PLoS Pathog 9(3): eioo324i). Spinal muscular atrophy is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder caused by deletion or mutations within the survival motor neuron gene 1 (SMNi). The human genome contains a nearly identical copy of the SMNi gene, known as SMN2, yet this gene contains a single nucleotide difference in exon 7, and produces a truncated, less stable SMN protein that is unable to functionally correct for the loss of SMNi (Lorson, C. L., E. Hahnen, et al. (1999). "A single nucleotide in the SMN gene regulates splicing and is responsible for spinal muscular atrophy." Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 96(11): 6307-6311). It is thought that the nucleotide alteration in the exon 7 of SMN2 leads to the disruption of an exonic splicing enhancer site, which promotes the skipping of exon7 during pre-mRNA splicing (Hofmann, Y., C. L. Lorson, et al. (2000). Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 97(17): 9618-9623). Various studies have identified splicing factors that either promote (Hofmann, Y., C. L. Lorson, et al. (2000). Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 97(17): 9618-9623; and Young, P. J., C. J. DiDonato, et al. (2002). "SRp30c-dependent stimulation of survival motor neuron (SMN) exon 7 inclusion is facilitated by a direct interaction with hTra2 beta 1." Hum Mol Genet 11(5): 577-58) or inhibit the inclusion of exon7 (Wee, C. D., M. A Havens, et al. (2014). "Targeting SR proteins improves SMN expression in spinal muscular atrophy cells." PLoS One 9(12): 6115205). As described by Hofmann and colleague, increased expression of I1TRA2 β promotes the inclusion of exon 7 into the SMN2 transcript, leading to increased production of functional SMN protein. Compounds described herein may be useful in the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy. Alternatively, compounds described herein may be useful in the treatment of other neurodegenerative diseases. The human transformer 2 beta homolog (hTRA2 β) is encoded by the human gene identified as EntrezGene # 6434 and is located at chromosomal location 3q26.2-q27. hTRA2 β is also known as SFRS10; SRFS10; TRAN2B; PPP1R156; TRA2-BETA; hTRA2-betai and Htra2- beta.

In some embodiments, compounds as described herein may contain both acidic and basic groups and may be in the form of inner salts or zwitterions, for example, and without limitation, betaines. Salts as described herein may be prepared by conventional processes known to a person skilled in the art, for example, and without limitation, by reacting the free form with an organic acid or inorganic acid or base, or by anion exchange or cation exchange from other salts. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that preparation of salts may occur in situ during isolation and purification of the compounds or preparation of salts may occur by separately reacting an isolated and purified compound. In some embodiments, compounds and all different forms thereof (e.g. free forms, salts, polymorphs, isomeric forms) as described herein may be in the solvent addition form, for example, solvates. Solvates contain either stoichiometric or non-stoichiometric amounts of a solvent in physical association the compound or salt thereof. The solvent may be, for example, and without limitation, a pharmaceutically acceptable solvent. For example, hydrates are formed when the solvent is water or alcoholates are formed when the solvent is an alcohol. In some embodiments, compounds and all different forms thereof (e.g. free forms, salts, solvates, isomeric forms) as described herein may include crystalline and amorphous forms, for example, polymorphs, pseudopolymorphs, conformational polymorphs, amorphous forms, or a combination thereof. Polymorphs include different crystal packing arrangements of the same elemental composition of a compound. Polymorphs usually have different X-ray diffraction patterns, infrared spectra, melting points, density, hardness, crystal shape, optical and electrical properties, stability and/or solubility. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that various factors including recrystallization solvent, rate of crystallization and storage temperature may cause a single crystal form to dominate. In some embodiments, compounds and all different forms thereof (e.g. free forms, salts, solvates, polymorphs) as described herein include isomers such as geometrical isomers, optical isomers based on asymmetric carbon, stereoisomers, tautomers, individual enantiomers, individual diastereomers, racemates, diastereomeric mixtures and combinations thereof, and are not limited by the description of the formula illustrated for the sake of convenience. In some embodiments, pharmaceutical compositions as described herein may comprise a salt of such a compound, preferably a pharmaceutically or physiologically acceptable salt. Pharmaceutical preparations will typically comprise one or more carriers, excipients or diluents acceptable for the mode of administration of the preparation, be it by injection, inhalation, topical administration, lavage, or other modes suitable for the selected treatment. Suitable carriers, excipients or diluents (used interchangeably herein) are those known in the art for use in such modes of administration. Suitable pharmaceutical compositions may be formulated by means known in the art and their mode of administration and dose determined by the skilled practitioner. For parenteral administration, a compound may be dissolved in sterile water or saline or a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle used for administration of non-water soluble compounds such as those used for vitamin K. For enteral administration, the compound may be administered in a tablet, capsule or dissolved in liquid form. The tablet or capsule may be enteric coated, or in a formulation for sustained release. Many suitable formulations are known, including, polymeric or protein microparticles encapsulating a compound to be released, ointments, pastes, gels, hydrogels, or solutions which can be used topically or locally to administer a compound. A sustained release patch or implant may be employed to provide release over a prolonged period of time. Many techniques known to one of skill in the art are described in Remington: the Science & Practice of Pharmacy by Alfonso Gennaro, 20th ed., Lippencott Williams & Wilkins, (2000). Formulations for parenteral administration may, for example, contain excipients, polyalkylene glycols such as polyethylene glycol, oils of vegetable origin, or hydrogenated naphthalenes. Biocompatible, biodegradable lactide polymer, lactide/glycolide copolymer, or polyoxyethylene-polyoxypropylene copolymers maybe used to control the release of the compounds. Other potentially useful parenteral delivery systems for modulatory compounds include ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer particles, osmotic pumps, implantable infusion systems, and liposomes. Formulations for inhalation may contain excipients, for example, lactose, or may be aqueous solutions containing, for example, polyoxyethylene-9-lauryl ether, glycocholate and deoxycholate, or may be oily solutions for administration in the form of nasal drops, or as a gel. Compounds or pharmaceutical compositions as described herein or for use as described herein may be administered by means of a medical device or appliance such as an implant, graft, prosthesis, stent, etc. Also, implants may be devised which are intended to contain and release such compounds or compositions. An example would be an implant made of a polymeric material adapted to release the compound over a period of time. An "effective amount" of a pharmaceutical composition as described herein includes a therapeutically effective amount or a prophylactically effective amount. A "therapeutically effective amount" refers to an amount effective, at dosages and for periods of time necessary, to achieve the desired therapeutic result, such as reduced tumor size, increased life span or increased life expectancy. A therapeutically effective amount of a compound may vary according to factors such as the disease state, age, sex, and weight of the subject, and the ability of the compound to elicit a desired response in the subject. Dosage regimens may be adjusted to provide the optimum therapeutic response. A therapeutically effective amount is also one in which any toxic or detrimental effects of the compound are outweighed by the therapeutically beneficial effects. A "prophylactically effective amount" refers to an amount effective, at dosages and for periods of time necessary, to achieve the desired prophylactic result, such as smaller tumors, increased life span, increased life expectancy or prevention of the progression of prostate cancer to an androgen-independent form. Typically, a prophylactic dose is used in subjects prior to or at an earlier stage of disease, so that a prophylactically effective amount maybe less than a therapeutically effective amount. It is to be noted that dosage values may vary with the severity of the condition to be alleviated. For any particular subject, specific dosage regimens may be adjusted over time according to the individual need and the professional judgment of the person administering or supervising the administration of the compositions. Dosage ranges set forth herein are exemplary only and do not limit the dosage ranges that may be selected by medical practitioners. The amount of active compound(s) in the composition may vary according to factors such as the disease state, age, sex, and weight of the subject. Dosage regimens may be adjusted to provide the optimum therapeutic response. For example, a single bolus may be administered, several divided doses may be administered over time or the dose may be proportionally reduced or increased as indicated by the exigencies of the therapeutic situation. It may be advantageous to formulate parenteral compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. In some embodiments, compounds and all different forms thereof as described herein may be used, for example, and without limitation, in combination with other treatment methods for inhibiting HIV infection. In general, compounds as described herein should be used without causing substantial toxicity. Toxicity of the compounds as described herein can be determined using standard techniques, for example, by testing in cell cultures or experimental animals and determining the therapeutic index, i.e., the ratio between the LD50 (the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the EC50 (The concentration of an investigational drug required to inhibit virus replication by 50 percent). In some circumstances however, such as in severe disease conditions, it may be appropriate to administer substantial excesses of the compositions. Some compounds as described herein may be toxic at some concentrations. Titration studies may be used to determine toxic and non-toxic concentrations. Toxicity may be evaluated by examining a particular compound's or composition's specificity across cell lines. Animal studies may be used to provide an indication if the compound has any effects on other tissues. Compounds as described herein may be administered to a subject. As used herein, a "subject" may be a human, non-human primate, rat, mouse, cow, horse, pig, sheep, goat, dog, cat, etc. The subject may be suspected of having or at risk for having an HIV infection. Diagnostic methods for determining HIV infection are known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Various alternative embodiments and examples of the invention are described herein. These embodiments and examples are illustrative and should not be construed as limiting the scope of the invention.

SRSFi or SRSFa cDNA Expression in HeLa Cells HeLa cells were co-transfected with a plasmid carrying Bcl-x minigene X2.13 and a plasmid containing the CMV promoter driving the expression of the SRSFi or SRSF9 cDNA, as described previously in Cloutier, P., J. Toutant, et al. (2008). "Antagonistic effects of the SRp30c protein and cryptic 5' splice sites on the alternative splicing of the apoptotic regulator Bcl-x." J Biol Chem 283(31): 21315-21324, except the present assay was performed in the presence of various concentrations of C8. Anti-HIV-i assay The anti-HIV activity of C8 was measured by a human T-cell reporter assay based on CEM- GXR cells. These cells express GFP due to the activation of the tat-dependent promoter upon HIV-i infection, and the level of infection was monitored using Flow cytometric analysis (guavaSoft 2.2™ software, Guava HT8, Millipore™). Antiviral activity was evaluated in the assay that measure inhibition of HIV-i spread in a co-culture of CEM-GXR cells containing one percent of HIV-i infected (GFP positive) cells. Infection was performed in a 96-well plate containing serial dilutions of molecule C8, and the inhibitory concentration 50 percent (IC50) were determined on day 3. ViaCount Viability Assay The ViaCount assay was performed with the Guava easyCyte 8HT™ flow cytometer according to the manufacturer's manual (Guava Technologies™, Inc., Hayward, CA, USA). In brief, CEM-GXR cells were seeded in 96-well plates 80000 cells/well in the absence or presence of compound C8 in various concentrations. Twenty-four hours later, 25 μΐ. of cell suspension was mixed with 225 μΐ, of Guava ViaCount™ reagent, and the mixture was incubated for 5 min at room temperature. Sample acquisition and data analysis were performed with the selection of EasyFit analysis feature using the ViaCount™ software module. Quantitative and endpoint RT-PCR assays Quantitative and endpoint RT-PCR analysis was performed by the R omics Platform™ at Universite de Sherbrooke. Design and validation of quantitative RT-PCR assays were done as previously described (Brosseau, J. P., J. F. Lucier, et al. (2010). "High-throughput quantification of splicing isoforms."

A first cycle of 10 minutes at 95°C was followed by 40 cycles of 15 seconds at 94°C, 20 seconds at 55°C and 20 seconds at 68°C. Fluorescence measurement using SYBR Green was performed and values were normalized to a set of housekeeping genes. For the cellular genes, endpoint analysis was performed using a set of alternative splicing units derived from the RefSeq™ database. For the HIV-i genes, sets of primers mapping in the exons flanking all the simple alternative splicing events were designed using Primer3 with default parameters. Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol™ and quantified using a 2100 Bioanalyzer™ (Agilent™ Inc. Santa Clara, CA, USA). A total of 2 μg of RNA was reverse transcribed using a mix of random hexamers and oligo(dT) and the Omniscript™ reverse transcriptase (Qiagen™, Germantown, MD, USA) in a final volume of 20 ul. Twenty ng of cDNA were amplified with 0.2 U/ 10 ul of HotStarTaq™ DNA Polymerase (Qiagen™) in the buffer provided by the manufacturer, and in the presence of the specific primers (IDT) for each splicing unit (at concentrations ranging from 0.3 to 0.6 uM) and dNTPs. The list of ASEs and oligos, are not shown, and primer locations mapped to the UCSC genome browser can be viewed at http://palace.lgfus.ca/data/related/2073/odgene /. Reactions were carried out in the GeneAmp™ PCR system 9700 (Applied Biosystems™, Foster City, CA, USA). A first cycle of 15 minutes at 95°C was followed by 35 cycles of 30 seconds at 94°C, 30 seconds at 55°C and 1 minute at 72°C. Thermocycling was concluded with an extension step of 10 minutes at 72°C. Visualization and analysis of amplified products were done using the LabChip HT™ DNA assay on a Caliper LC-90 automated microfluidic station (Caliper™, Hopkmton, MA, USA). Plasmids, transfection and RNA interference assays Plasmids expressing Bcl-x reporter mini genes (X2.13 and X2) and SRSF9 (aka SRp30c) and SRSFi (aka AFS/SF2) were previously described (Garneau D. et al. J Biol Chem. 2005 28o(24):2264i-5o; Shkreta L. et al. J Biol Chem. 2011 286(ι):33ΐ-4θ, 2011; Cloutier, P., J. Toutant, et al. J Biol Chem. 2008 283(31): 21315-21324). Details of plasmids expressing 3XFlag-SRSFio, Flag-SRSFio and HA-tagged SRSFio were also previously described (Shkreta L. et al. in preparation). Plasmid transfections were carried out with polyethyleneimide (Polysciences™ Inc.) or Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen™) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The siRNA used to knock down the expression of SRSFio, siGENOME SMARTpool-Human SRSFio, was purchased from Dharmacon™ (GE Healthcare™) and transfected into cells at a concentration of 100 nM using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen™). Proteins or RNA were extracted from mock-transfected and siRNA-transfected cells at 72 hours post-transfection. Immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry analysis HeLa-HIV cells expressing Flag-SRSFio and treated or not with various concentration of C8 were cultured in 150 mm plates. Collected cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed on ice for 30 minutes in NET-2 buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.05 % (vol/vol) Nonidet P-40 added with EDTA-free protease and phosphatase inhibitors cocktail (Roche Diagnostics GmbH™). The lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 χ g for 15 min and RNase A solution (0.1 mg/mL cellular lysate) was added. SureBeads™ protein G magnetic beads (Biorad™) were coupled with monoclonal anti-FLAG™ M2 antibody (F3165, Sigma Aldrich™) through rotation for 1 hour at room temperature. Equal aliquots of anti- Flag coupled beads were added to pre-cleared Flag-SRSFio-containing cell lysates. After over-night incubation at 4°C, beads were magnetized and washed 4 x with NET2 buffer and 4 x with 20 mM NH4HCO3. Beads were resuspended in 50 μί. of 20 mM NH4HCO3 buffer containing 1 μg of Trypsin Gold™ (Promega™) and incubated overnight at 37 °C while shaking. The reaction was stopped by adding formic acid to 1% final concentration. The supernatant was transferred to a new tube, while beads were resuspended in 50 of a solution containing 60% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid and incubated for 5 min at room temperature. Both supernatants were pooled and lyophilized using a Speedvac™. Peptides were resuspended in 30 μΐ. of 0.1% of trifluoroacetic acid and proceeded to desalting using ZipTip C18 (Millipore™) as recommended by the manufacturer. Eluted peptides were lyophilized and resuspended in 25 iL of 1% formic acid. Trypsin digested peptides loaded onto an Acclaim™ PepMapioo C18 column (0.3 mm id x 5 mm, Dionex Corporation™) were separated using a Dionex Ultimate 3000™ nanoHPLC system. The HPLC system was coupled to an OrbiTrap QExactive™ mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.™) via an EasySpray™ source. Data acquired using the Xcalibur™software were processed, searched and quantified using the MaxQuant™ software package version 1.4.1.2 as described previously (Cox, J., and Mann, M. (2008) MaxQuant enables high peptide identification rates, individualized p.p.b.-range mass accuracies and proteome-wide protein quantification. Nat Biotechnol 26, 1367-1372) employing the Human Uniprot database. Transcriptome analysis Total RNA from cells treated with various concentrations of C8 in triplicates (o, 1, 5, 10 and 20 μΜ) was purified using the RNAeasy™ mini kit (Qiagen™). A total of 10 μg of RNA was used to generate an TruSeq™ library using the manufacturer's protocol (iUumina™). The library was then sequenced for 51 cycles on a Alumina HiSeq-2500™ platform following the manufacturer's recommendations (Alumina™). The 51-nucleotide (nt) reads from the sequencer Fastq files were then aligned to the human genome (hgig) with TopHat™ v2.o.io, using the options -p6—no-coverage-search with a transcriptome index produced from the Ensemble GRCI137 release 73 gene build. 51-nt reads were generated for the control, and C8-treated samples. On average, 20M reads were obtained per sample with greater than 95% of reads successfully aligned and 85% of the total reads uniquely aligned to the human genome. RPKM (Reads per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads) per genes were then produced by counting the number of uniquely mappable reads that fell within exonic region for all the genes annotated in the Ensembl GRCI137 release 73 build. The total length of exonic regions were used to normalize read counts per gene. The coverage plots were produced by breaking down the spliced transcript in 100 bins and by computing the median read coverage within each bin relative to the total coverage along the transcript. For the individual transcripts, the relative coverage for the different samples was then plotted along the length of the transcript using the same scale for the y axis. The average coverage along all transcripts was calculated by computing the means for each of the 100 bins for all expressed transcripts (transcripts with an RPKM greater than 0.5 in at least two samples) and plotting the resulting coverage for all 100 bins. MISO analysis was performed using the MISO software. MISO analysis The MISO software (Katz, Y., E. T. Wang, et al. (2010). "Analysis and design of RNA sequencing experiments for identifying isoform regulation." Nat Methods 7(12): 1009-1015) was used to follow the profile of alternative splicing events.

To screen for anti-HIV activity a human T-cell-based reporter cell line (GXR-5) that expresses the HIV-i receptor CD4, the CXCR4 and CCR5 co-receptors was used, and green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a direct and quantitative marker, as described previously (Brockman et al. 2006 J. Virol Methods 131(2): 134-142). GXR-5 cells express GFP due to the activation of the tat-dependent promoter upon HIV infection, and the level of infection can be monitored using Flow cytometric analysis (guavaSoft 2.2™ software, Guava HT8™, Millipore™). A co-culture method using infected and non-infected cells was used to assay both viral replication and cell to cell spread, as described previously (Chen et al. 2007. J. Virol 8i(22):i2582-95). Briefly, a co-culture of lxio6 non-infected GXR-5 cells and 1% HIV- 1NL4-3 infected cells was exposed to varying concentrations of the test compound in DMSO or 1 uM Nelfinavir as a control. At four days post-infection, the level of infection was determined by flow-cytometry using GFP expression as a read-out. As shown in the FIGURE lA, the C8 and D3 compounds showed a dose-dependent ability to inhibit viral replication and cell to cell spread, whereas compounds E5 and C2 showed the same level of anti-HIV activity regardless of the dose used. In FIGURE lB SL309 showed a gradual dose-dependent ability to inhibit viral replication. Similarly, FIGURE 15 shows an inhibition of viral spread at various concentrations of SL309 from o μΜ to 25 μΜ. Example 2: The antiretroviral activity of C8 on wild-type HIV-i and drug resistant strains C8 was evaluated for its antiretroviral activity using a human T-cell line (CEM-GXR) against wild-type HIV-i in both subtype A and subtype B, and against multiple drug-resistant strains ofHIV-l. CEM-GXR cells express HIV-i receptor CD4, both the CXCR4 and CCR5 coreceptors, and GFP as a direct and quantitative marker. CEM-GXR cells express GFP due to the activation of the tat-dependent promoter upon HIV infection, and the level of infection was monitored using Flow cytometric analysis (guavaSoft 2.2™ software, Guava HT8™, Millipore™). Antiviral activity was evaluated in the assay that measures inhibition of HIV-i spread in a co- culture of one million CEM-GXR cells containing one percent HIV-i variants infected cells. Infection was performed in a T25 flask containing 5ml RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS. C8 is then added to the culture at final concentration from ο.ι-8.ομΜ from a 5mM stock. At four days post-infection, the level of infection is determined by flow cytometry using GFP expression as readout. As shown in FIGURE 2, C8 showed activity at the submicromolar concentrations against both HIV-IIIIB (subtype B, X4-tropic), and HIV-i 97USSN54 (subtype A, Rs-tropic), with IC50 of ο.όμΜ and 0.9UM respectively (FIGURE 2A and B). To assess its potential against drug-resistant strains, the antiretroviral activity of the C8 compound was tested against strains that are resistant to the current 4 major drug targets categories: (Non)-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor (NNRTI), Protease Inhibitor (PI), and Integrase Inhibitor (INI). C8 was evaluated against a (N)NRTI-resistant isolate known as E00443 that harbors a variety of mutations, including the highly prevalent K103N and V108I substitutions in reverse transcriptase that render the virus resistant to delavirdine (DLV), efavirenz (EFV), nevirapine (NVP). This virus also carries the mutations D67N, K70R, V75I, F77L, Y115F, F116Y, Q151M, M184V, T215V, K219Q which confer for high-level resistance to lamivudine (3TC), abacavir (ABC), zidovudine (AZT), stavudine (D4T) , didanosine (DDI) , emtricitabine (FTC), tenofovir (TDF). C8 showed activity against this (N)NRTI-resistant virus with an IC50 of ι.3μΜ (FIGURE 2C). C8 also displayed potency against a Pi-resistant isolate (2948) that contains substitution G48V, and L90M. This combination of mutation decreases susceptibility to each of the FDA approved Pis except Tipranavir (TPV) and Darunavir (DRV) (Rhee et al 2010 Antimicrob Agents Chemother). C8 retained its activity against this Pi-resistant strain with an IC50 of ι.4θμΜ (FIGURE 2D). HIV-i chnical isolate resistant to integrase inhibitors (11845) was tested for its susceptibility to C8. This virus harbors G140S, and Q148H substitution that reduce Raltegravir (RAL) and Elvitegravir (EVG) susceptibility > 100-fold (Abram et al. 2013 Antimicrob Agents Chemother), and reduces Dolutegravir (DTG) up to 10-fold (Underwood et al. 2012 J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr). C8 showed submicromolar activity again this isolate with an IC50 of 1.36UM (FIGURE 2E). Lastly, the C8 compound also showed activity against an HIV strain that is resistant against the entry inhibitor-based drug known as maraviroc with an IC50 of 0.9 μΜ (FIGURE 2F). The maraviroc-resistant variant from the R5 strain of HIV-i contains five mutations within the HIVV3 loop: A19T, L20F, T22A, E25D, and I26V. FIGURE 3 shows four active molecules (i.e. D3, E5, C2, and C8) in 2μΜ final concentration for their ability to inhibit HIV-i replication of HAART RTI-resistant strains. The resistant strains used were the highly resistant Eoo443_v, the moderately resistant Eoo435_4 and the slightly resistant E oo476_v. The active molecules were tested in a dose-response experiment, DGPS56/DH-052 (C8), DGPS39/LB-45 (E5), DGPS154/MM-99 (D3), DGPS73/SKK-31 (C2), at concentrations of ιμΜ, 2μΜ and 4μΜ, with Nelfinavir ιμΜ (a protease inhibitor more potent than AZT) as a positive control. FIGURE 3 summarizes the results of this experiment. The ability of DGPS56/DH-052 and DGPS154/ M-99 to inhibit the virus increased as their concentration increased. For compounds DGPS39/LB-45 and DGPS73/SKK-31 the change in concentration had no significant effect on the inhibition of HIV-i replication. This could be due to the fact that the difference between concentrations was not large enough to observe a significant difference. DGPS56/DH-052 appeared to be the most potent. Example 3 : Compound C8 interferes with the splicing of HIV transcripts A HeLa cell line stably expressing a modified X4HIV-1 (LAQ+I) provirus (HeLa rtTA-HV- AMls) was used to determine the effect of compound C8 on the splicing of HIV transcripts and the transcription of the HIV genome as described previously by Wong et al. (Wong et al. 2011 Retrovirology 2011 8:47). This provirus contains mutations that abrogate the function of the TAR RNA element and the Tat gene, thus rendering HIV-i expression strictly dependent on the Tet-ON system. Briefly, the HeLa rtTA-HV-AMls cells were treated with either DMSO or the C8 compound for a 1 hr period followed by the addition of doxocycline to induce the expression of the HIV provirus. Cells were incubated for a further 24hr at which point, cells were harvested for either RNA or protein analysis. Endpoint PCR and qRT-PCR were used to monitor the production of HIV transcripts as described previously (Lund et al. 2012 Nucl Acids Res). Protein levels for the Gag protein were determined by ELISA according to the manufacturer's protocol. Protein levels for the Env and Tat proteins were determined by Western blot analysis and fluorescent microscopy. As shown in FIGURE 4B and 4C, quantitative RT-PCR determined that C8 at various concentrations (i.e. 1 μΜ, 5 μΜ and 10 μΜ) induced a marked decrease in the level of HIV-i RNA accumulation in HeLa-H cells (of selected amplicons as shown in FIGURE 4A). The intensity of products was normalized relative to the amount produced in the controls (which corresponds to an arbitrary unit value of 1). A comparison of the effect of C8 as compared to DMSO on HIV-i expression in HeLa HIV Amis rtA cells, where HeLa HIV-i cells were treated with either DMSO or C84 hrs. prior to a 24 hr. incubation with doxycycline (dox) to induce provirus expression, before cells were harvested for viral protein and viral protein levels were assessed. Western blot analysis of viral proteins showed results consistent with decreased protein expression of Gag, Env and Tat in response to increasing concentrations of the C8 compound (FIGURE 5A and 5B). FIGURE 5C shows the structure of the HIV-i provirus used to generate the HeLa cell line with the GagGFP fusion, wherein the provirus has elements (TetO sites, rtTA) required for regulation by doxycycline (Dox). Similarly, the negative impact of C8 on the production the Gag viral protein was further confirmed by fluorescent microscopy fluroscent microscopy. FIGURE 5D shows the effect of C8 on HIV-i US RNA localization, the cells were incubated in the absence (-) or the presence (+) of Dox for 24 h, then fixed, stained with DAPI and imaged using a Leica DMR epifluorescent microscope and HeLa HIVGagGFP cells were treated with either DMSO or C8 (1 μΜ) for 4 h prior to addition of Dox to induce provirus expression, wherein 24 hours after Dox addition, cells were fixed and US RNA localization was determined by in situ hybridization (Magnification 6oox). HIV-i splicing was analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR using different combinations of forward and reverse primers to amplify products corresponding to various splicing events (see the map of donor and acceptor splice sites used for the production of the major HIV mRNAs as shown in FIGURE 6A), wherein the AS2 set of primers was used to monitor the production of Tati and Nef2 in panels FIGURES B and C. The differential impact of C8 on products derived from different splicing events indicates that these effects are not likely due to a reduction in HIV transcription alone, and is therefore consistent with the notion that C8 differentially affects splice site usage in HIV-i. To test this conclusion, we carried out endpoint RT-PCR using the AS2 pair of primers that co-amplify Tati (D1/A3 and D4/A7 splicing) and Nef2 (D1/A5 and D4/A7 splicing) products. The results indicate that the production of Tati was preferentially compromised compared to that of Nef2 (FIGURES 6B and 6C). Based on the above results, we anticipate that the combined effect of C8 on HIV-i transcription and splicing leads to critical unbalances in the production of components required for viral replication. FIGURE 6B shows the results from the endpoint RT-PCR assay from HeLa-HIV cells treated with C8. Representative electropherograms showing the Tati (D1/A3) and Nef2 (D1/A5) amplicons. FIGURE 6C shows the histograms depicting the impact of C8 on Tati and Nef2 production, wherein the intensity of products was normalized relative to the total intensity for each lane. Generally a dose dependent response was seen for all mRNA products. Also, FIGURES 7A shows that compound C8 at 1 uM, 5 uM, 10 uM did not significantly affect the level of unspliced RNA in the HeLa-HIV cell line with three different primer pairs (US-i, US-2 and US-4). FIGURE 7B shows a dose dependent reduction of Tat transactivated HIV promoter activity in response to compound C8 at 1 uM, 10 μΜ, 20 uM, measured as total GFP fluorescence at 24 hours post-transfection. Example 4: SRSF10 is a host target of the C8 compound To determine if C8 displays activity against SR proteins, we tested whether C8 affected the splice switching activity of SRSFi on Bcl-x transcripts (Li, X., J. Wang, et al. (2005). "Loss of splicing factor ASF/SF2 induces G2 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, but inhibits internucleosomal DNA fragmentation." Genes Dev 19(22): 2705-2714; Paronetto, M. P., T. Achsel, et al. (2007). "The RNA-binding protein Sam68 modulates the alternative splicing of Bcl-x." J Cell Biol 176(7): 929-939; and Cloutier, P., J. Toutant, et al. (2008). J Biol Chem 283(31): 21315-21324). A plasmid expressing SRSFi was co-transfected into 293 cells with a Bcl-x reporter mini-gene (X2.13). Bcl-x is alternatively spliced through the use of two 5' splice sites to produce the Bcl-xL and Bcl-xS splice variants (Cloutier, P., J. Toutant, et al. (2008). J Biol Chem 283(31): 21315-21324). As a control we used a plasmid that expresses SRSF9 (aka SRp30c), a protein that also regulates Bcl-x splicing (Cloutier, P., J. Toutant, et al. (2008). J Biol Chem 283(31): 21315-21324). Both SRSFi and SRSF9 shifted Bcl-x splicing to favor the production of the Bcl-xL antiapoptotic variant, consistent with previous results (Paronetto, M. P., T. Achsel, et al. (2007). J Cell Biol 176(7): 929-939; Cloutier, P., J. Toutant, et al. (2008). J Biol Chem 283(31): 21315-21324; and Li, X., J. Wang, et al. (2005). Genes Dev 19(22): 2705-2714) (FIGURE 8A). The addition of C8 at concentrations of up to 20 uM did not alter the shift in splice site use induced by overexpression SRSFi or SRSF9 (Fig. 8A). We then tested the impact of C8 on the activity of another SR protein, SRSF10, that we have recently implicated in Bcl-x splicing regulation (L. Shkreta, J. Toutant and B. Chabot, manuscript in preparation). A Flag-tagged SRSFio protein stimulates the production of pro- apoptotic Bcl-xS on transcripts derived from a Bcl-x mini-gene (X2), which contains different control elements than X2.13 (FIGURE 8B). In this case, 10 μΜ of C8 completely abrogated the SRSFio-induced shift in splicing (FIGURE 8B). Since C8 had little effect on the expression of the Flag-SRSFio protein (FIGURE 8C), our results indicate that C8 had selectively abrogated the splicing regulatory function of SRSFio. Example 5: SRSFio controls HIV splicing and C8 affects the phosphorylation of SRSFio If C8 impacts HIV-i splicing by affecting the activity of SRSFio, then HIV-i splicing should be sensitive to a reduction in the level of SRSFio. To test this prediction, an siRNA to partially deplete SRSFio in the HeLa-HIV cell line was used (FIGURE 9A). Quantitative RT-PCR analysis indicated that this partial depletion of SRSFio reduced by 20 to 30 percentage points the level of products derived from the D4/A7 splice (SS5 and SS6 pairs of primers), the D1/A5 splice (SSi and SS1.2 pairs of primers), the D1/A2 splice (SS3 pair of primers) and the D1/A4 splice (SS4 pair of primers). The siRNA against SRSFio had no impact on HIV transcription as measured by products derived from the unspliced genomic pre-mRNA (USi, US2 and US4 pairs of primers) (FIGURE 9B). These results indicate that SRSFio participates in the control of HIV-i splicing. The impact of C8 on HIV-i splicing may therefore be caused, at least in part, by an alteration in the activity of SRSFio. How the activity of SRSFio might be affected by C8 was investigated. SRSFio is a phosphorylated protein, and its dephosphorylation converts SRSFio from a positive regulator into a repressor (Shin, C, Y. Feng, et al. (2004). "Dephosphorylated SRp38 acts as a splicing repressor in response to heat shock." Nature 427(6974): 553-558; and Feng, Y., M. Chen, et al. (2008). "Phosphorylation switches the general splicing repressor SRp38 to a sequence-specific activator." Nat Struct Mol Biol 15(10): 1040-1048). Treating extracts with calf intestinal phosphatase (CIP) produces a dephosphorylated version of SRSFio with distinctively faster gel mobility than phosphorylated forms(Shin, C. and J. L. Manley (2002). "The SR protein SRp38 represses splicing in M phase cells." Cell 111(3): 407-417). This associated change in migration was reproduced when we treated extracts from cells expressing FlagSRSFio and HA-tagged SRSFio proteins with CIP and fractionated proteins using appropriate gel-migrating conditions (FIGURE 10A). Using this system, we observed that treating cells with 20 μΜ of C8 for 24 hours converted SRSFio into faster-migrating forms that did not co-migrate with the fully dephosphorylated form produced with CIP, suggesting that the treatment with C8 partially dephosphorylated SRSFio. The conversion of SRSFio into two major distinctly migrating versions suggests that more than one phosphorylation event might be altered by C8. To identify the phosphorylation changes that C8 is promoting on SRSFio, an immunoprecipation assay using anti-Flag antibody and extracts of cells expressing Flag- SRSFio was carried out, treated with various concentrations of C8. The assay was performed in duplicate and the recovered material was analyzed by MALDI mass spectrometry. Among the peptides that uniquely matched SRSFio, the peptide SFDYNYR carried a serine at position 133 that was phosphorylated in 30% of all the peptide recovered (FIGURE 10B and FIGURE 10C). The recovery of this phosphorylated peptide relative to the non- phosphorylated version was decreased by 2- to 6-fold in extracts from cells that had been treated with 1, 10 and 25 μΜ of C8 (FIGURE 10C). Thus, C8 promoted the dephosphorylation of FlagSRSFio at serine 133. Since C8 converts the slowest migrating form of HA-tagged SRSFio into at least two faster migrating forms (FIGURE 10A), it was expected that other peptides would harbor changes in phosphorylation, particularly in the RS2 domain, which is known to undergo phosphorylation. However, possibly because the coverage of SRSFio by this mass spectrometry analysis was partial, we did not identify other phosphorylated peptides in the control samples. Example 6: C8 alters the interaction of Tra2p with SRSFio Since splicing factors often mediate their activity on splice site selection by interacting with other regulators, we determined whether Flag-SRSFio interacted with ΜΈΑ2β, a known regulator of HIV-i splicing (Erkelenz, S., G. Poschmann, et al. (2013). "Tra2-mediated recognition of HIV-i 5' splice site D3 as a key factor in the processing of vpr mRNA." J Virol 87(5): 2721-2734; and Wong, R. W., A. Balachandran, et al. (2013). "Digoxin suppresses HIV- 1 replication by altering viral RNA processing." PLoS Pathog 9(3): 61003241). Since the phosphorylation is important for SRSFio to interact with other proteins (Shin, C, Y. Feng, et al. (2004). Nature 427(6974): 553-558;), it would be relevant to address whether C8 impacts this putative SRSFio/hTra2 interaction. Since the above immunoprecipation assays had been performed with ribonuclease-treated samples to eliminate interactions mediated by RNA bridging, MALDI mass spectrometry data was interrogated for the presence of hTRA2p- specific peptides. Several unique hTra2p peptides were identified in the control anti-SRSFio immunoprecipitates. Notably, for equivalent amounts of SRSFio in samples, we found that the recovery of ΜΈΑ2β peptides was increased by nearly 100-fold in samples of HeLa cells treated with ιο μπι of C8 (FIGURE 10D). Another set of relevant interactors were the SR- protein kinases SRPKi and SRPK2 whose recovery was stimulated 3 to 8-fold by 10 μΜ of C8 (FIGURE 10E). Our results therefore indicate that C8 increases the interaction of SRSFio with hTra2p, a known regulator of HIV-i splicing, and with kinases known to phosphorylate SRSFio. The changes in phosphorylation elicited by C8 are likely to contribute directly to the effect on HIV-i splicing. Example 7: Impact of C8 on cellular pre-mRNA splicing An anti-HIV compound that alters the activity of a cellular protein may be of limited use because it may affect the normal cellular functions carried out by the cellular protein. Although C8 had a modest negative impact on cell growth (FIGURE 12), it was of interest to determine whether C8 also affected the alternative splicing of cellular genes. A preliminary screen using RT-PCR was carried out on a set of 96 alternative splicing events from 92 different human genes (data not shown). At 10 μΜ of C8, only one splicing event (INF2) shifted with a q-value inferior to 0.01. At 1 uM of C8, a concentration that severely blocks HIV replication, no alternative splicing event from this set was significantly altered (q-value < 0.05). A recent study carried out in human colon cancer cell lines identified BCLAFi as a gene whose alternative splicing is regulated by SRSFio (Zhou, X., X. Li, et al. (2014). "BCLAFi and its splicing regulator SRSFio regulate the tumorigenic potential of colon cancer cells." Nat Commun 5: 4581). The ability of C8 to impact the alternative splicing of BCLAFi was tested in the HeLa-HIV cell line as well as in three colon cancer cell lines (Caco2, SW620 and HCT116). In all cases, 20 uM of C8 elicited a 10-20 percentage points drop in the production of exon 5a-containing variant of BCLAFi (FIGURE 11), consistent with the predicted effect of a decrease in the activity of SRSFio. Notably, a slight but still statistically significant change with 1 uM of C8 was noted only in HeLa cells. To extend these observations more globally, we carried out a transcriptome analysis by performing RNA-Seq on total RNA from the HeLa-HIV cells treated with DMSO and increasing concentrations of C8 (o, 1, 5, 10 and 20 uM) in triplicates. We used the MISO software (Katz, Y., E. T. Wang, et al. (2010). "Analysis and design of RNA sequencing experiments for identifying isoform regulation." Nat Methods 7(12): 1009-1015) to follow thousands of alternative splicing events. The MISO analysis revealed 66 alternative splicing units affected by more than 30 percentage points with 20 μΜ of C8 with a Bayesian coefficient score greater than 400 (data not shown). We selected 22 of these units for validation by endpoint RT-PCR using o, 1, 5 and 10 μΜ of C8 on HeLa-HIV cells. Of the 22 units, only 6 were confirmed as hits by C8 (DOM3Z(DXO), ESYT2, ITGB3BP, NAP1L4, RBM41, SPTANi ; data not shown). Although 10 uM of C8 shifted these six events between 13 and 45 percentage points, all the shifts observed with 1 uM of C8 were between o and 12 percentage points, values that are essentially below or at the validation threshold. Example 8: C8 suppresses adenovirus replication Since C8 had an effect on SRSFio-mediated splicing, C8 was studied for its impact on adenovirus replication. Previous studies reported that interaction between SRSF10 and TLS could influence splicing of the adenovirus EiA pre-mRNA. Specifically, overexpression of SRSF10 alone or in combination with TLS could lead to the promotion of the 9, 10, 11 isoforms of the EiA mRNA (Yang, L., L. J. Embree, et al. (1998). "Oncoprotein TLS interacts with serine-arginine proteins involved in RNA splicing." J Biol Chem 273(43): 27761-27764). To investigate whether C8 would impact adenovirus replication, A549 cells (human carcinomic alveolar basal epithelial cell line) were infected with adenovirus. After 1 hr for virus adsorption, the media was removed and replaced with fresh media containing either C8 or DMSO as a control. Cells were harvested after 24 hrs and analyzed by Western blot. As shown in FIGURE 14A, the presence of ιομιη of C8 resulted in a significant reduction in the levels of the adenovirus hexon protein, suggesting that C8 effectively suppressed the viral replication. This was confirmed by determining the levels of adenovirus present by limiting dilution titration in adenovirus-infected A549 cells treated with varying concentrations of C8. As shown in FIGURE 14B, there is a decline in the viral titre observed in the A549 cells as the concentration of C8 increases. Example 9: Treatment with C8 leads to increased production of full length SMN2 transcript Since C8 treatment increased the interaction between SRSF10 and hTra2 β other splicing targets of hTra2 were investigated as targets of C8. Previous studies have shown that hTra2P can promote the inclusion of the survival motor neuron 2 (SMN2) exon 7, leading to full length SMN2 mRNA ( Hofmann, Y., C. L. Lorson, et al. (2000). "Htra2-beta 1 stimulates an exonic splicing enhancer and can restore full-length SMN expression to survival motor neuron 2 (SMN2)." Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 97(17): 9618-9623). As shown in Figure 14, endpoint RT-PCR was used to determine whether treatment with C8 affected the inclusion of exon 7 of SMN2 using a cell line derived from a patient with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). As shown in Figure 14B, treatment with varying concentrations of C8 resulted in an increased production of the full length SMN2 transcript, relative to the DMSO control, suggesting that the presence of C8 may directly or indirectly enhance the activity of hTra2 β. Example 10: Off-target Effects and Toxicity FIGURE 7C shows no significant change in the transcription on housekeeping cellular genes MRPL19, PUMi and YWHAZ in HeLa-HIV a cell line in response to various concentrations of compound C8 (o, 1, 10 and 20 μΜ). To extend these observations more globally, a transcriptome analysis was carried out by performing RNA-Seq on total RNA from the HeLa- HIV cells treated with DMSO and increasing concentrations of C8 (o, 1, 5, 10 and 20 μΜ) in triplicates. MISO software (Katz, Y., E. T. Wang, et al. (2010). Nat Methods 7(12): 1009- 1015) was used to follow thousands of alternative splicing events. The MISO analysis revealed 66 alternative splicing units affected by more than 30 percentage points with 20 μΜ of C8 with a Bayesian coefficient score greater than 400 (data not shown). 22 of these units were selected for validation by endpoint RT-PCR using o, 1, 5 and 10 μΜ of C8 on HeLa-HIV cells. Of the 22 units, only 6 were confirmed as hits by C8 (DOM3Z(DXO), ESYT2, ITGB3BP, NAP1L4, RBM41, SPTANi ; data not shown). Although 10 uM of C8 shifted these six events between 13 and 45 percentage points, all the shifts observed with 1 μΜ of C8 were between o and 12 percentage points, values that are essentially below or at the validation threshold. Furthermore, the results from a preliminary RT-PCR screen of 96 alternative splicing events in 92 cellular genes from HeLa-HIV cells treated with either 1 uM or 10 μΜ of C8 or an untreated control were also completed (data not shown). The cells treated with 1 μΜ of C8 showed no alternative splicing events that were significantly altered as compared to control. Cells treated with 10 μΜ of C8, had one splicing event in the INF2 gene as compared to control cells (DMSO treated). Lastly, C8 showed limited toxicity a high concentration as shown in FIGURE 16, where various concentrations of C8 were tested in a Guava ViaCount assay for GXR-CEM cell viability.
