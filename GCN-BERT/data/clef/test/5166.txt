FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to novel pyridinone-derivatives which are positive allosteric modulators of the metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 2 (“mGluR2”) and which are useful for the treatment or prevention of neurological and psychiatric disorders associated with glutamate dysfunction and diseases in which the mGluR2 subtype of metabotropic receptors is involved. The invention is also directed to pharmaceutical compositions comprising such compounds, to processes to prepare such compounds and compositions, and to the use of such compounds for the prevention or treatment of neurological and psychiatric disorders and diseases in which mGluR2 is involved. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Glutamate is the major amino acid neurotransmitter in the mammalian central nervous system. Glutamate plays a major role in numerous physiological functions, such as learning and memory but also sensory perception, development of synaptic plasticity, motor control, respiration, and regulation of cardiovascular function. Furthermore, glutamate is at the centre of several different neurological and psychiatric diseases, where there is an imbalance in glutamatergic neurotransmission. Glutamate mediates synaptic neurotransmission through the activation of ionotropic glutamate receptors channels (iGluRs), and the NMDA, AMPA and kainate receptors which are responsible for fast excitatory transmission. In addition, glutamate activates metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) which have a more modulatory role that contributes to the fine-tuning of synaptic efficacy. Glutamate activates the mGluRs through binding to the large extracellular amino-terminal domain of the receptor, herein called the orthosteric binding site. This binding induces a conformational change in the receptor which results in the activation of the G-protein and intracellular signaling pathways. The mGluR2 subtype is negatively coupled to adenylate cyclase via activation of Gαi-protein, and its activation leads to inhibition of glutamate release in the synapse. In the central nervous system (CNS), mGluR2 receptors are abundant mainly throughout cortex, thalamic regions, accessory olfactory bulb, hippocampus, amygdala, caudate-putamen and nucleus accumbens. Activating mGluR2 was shown in clinical trials to be efficacious to treat anxiety disorders. In addition, activating mGluR2 in various animal models was shown to be efficacious, thus representing a potential novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of schizophrenia, epilepsy, addiction/drug dependence, Parkinson's disease, pain, sleep disorders and Huntington's disease. To date, most of the available pharmacological tools targeting mGluRs are orthosteric ligands which activate several members of the family as they are structural analogs of glutamate. A new avenue for developing selective compounds acting at mGluRs is to identify compounds that act through allosteric mechanisms, modulating the receptor by binding to a site different from the highly conserved orthosteric binding site. Positive allosteric modulators of mGluRs have emerged recently as novel pharmacological entities offering this attractive alternative. Various compounds have been described as mGluR2 positive allosteric modulators. WO2004/092135 (NPS & Astra Zeneca), WO2004/018386, WO2006/014918 and WO2006/015158 (Merck), W02001/56990 (Eli Lilly) and WO2006/030032 (Addex & Janssen Pharmaceutica) describe respectively phenyl sulfonamide, acetophenone, indanone, pyridylmethyl sulfonamide and pyridinone derivatives as mGluR2 positive allosteric modulators. None of the specifically disclosed compounds therein are structurally related to the compounds of the present invention. It was demonstrated that such compounds do not activate the receptor by themselves. Rather, they enable the receptor to produce a maximal response to a concentration of glutamate which by itself induces a minimal response. Mutational analysis has demonstrated unequivocally that the binding of mGluR2 positive allosteric modulators does not occur at the orthosteric site, but instead at an allosteric site situated within the seven transmembrane region of the receptor. Animal data are suggesting that positive allosteric modulators of mGluR2 have effects in anxiety and psychosis models similar to those obtained with orthosteric agonists. Allosteric modulators of mGluR2 were shown to be active in fear-potentiated startle, and in stress-induced hyperthermia models of anxiety. Furthermore, such compounds were shown to be active in reversal of ketamine- or amphetamine-induced hyperlocomotion, and in reversal of amphetamine-induced disruption of prepulse inhibition of the acoustic startle effect models of schizophrenia. (J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2006, 318, 173-185; Psychopharmacology 2005, 179, 271-283). Recent animal studies further reveal that the selective positive allosteric modulator of metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 2 biphenyl-indanone (BINA) blocks a hallucinogenic drug model of psychosis, supporting the strategy of targeting mGluR2 receptors for treating glutamatergic dysfunction in schizophrenia. (Mol. Pharmacol. 2007, 72, 477-484). Positive allosteric modulators enable potentiation of the glutamate response, but they have also been shown to potentiate the response to orthosteric mGluR2 agonists such as LY379268 or DCG-IV. These data provide evidence for yet another novel therapeutic approach to treat above mentioned neurological and psychiatric diseases involving mGluR2, which would use a combination of a positive allosteric modulator of mGluR2 together with an orthosteric agonist of mGluR2.

The notation C1-3alkyl as a group or part of a group defines a saturated, straight or branched, hydrocarbon radical having from 1 to 3 carbon atoms, such as methyl, ethyl, 1-propyl and 1-methylethyl; e.g. hydroxyC1-3alkyl for example defines hydroxymethyl, 2-hydroxyethyl, 3-hydroxypropyl and 1-hydroxy-1-methylethyl. The notation C1-6alkyl as a group or part of a group defines a saturated, straight or branched, hydrocarbon radical having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms such as methyl, ethyl, 1-propyl, 1-methylethyl, 1-butyl, 2-methyl-1-propyl, 3-methyl-1-butyl, 1-pentyl, 1-hexyl and the like. The notation C3-7cycloalkyl defines a saturated, cyclic hydrocarbon radical having from 3 to 7 carbon atoms, such as cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl and cycloheptyl. The notation halo or halogen as a group or part of a group is generic for fluoro, chloro, bromo, iodo. For therapeutic use, salts of the compounds of formula (I) are those wherein the counterion is pharmaceutically acceptable. However, salts of acids and bases which are non-pharmaceutically acceptable may also find use, for example, in the preparation or purification of a pharmaceutically acceptable compound. All salts, whether pharmaceutically acceptable or not, are included within the ambit of the present invention. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts are defined to comprise the therapeutically active non-toxic acid addition salt forms that the compounds according to Formula (I) are able to form. Said salts can be obtained by treating the base form of the compounds according to Formula (I) with appropriate acids, for example inorganic acids, for example hydrohalic acid, in particular hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulphuric acid, nitric acid and phosphoric acid; organic acids, for example acetic acid, hydroxyacetic acid, propanoic acid, lactic acid, pyruvic acid, oxalic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, malic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, cyclamic acid, salicylic acid, p-aminosalicylic acid and pamoic acid. Conversely said salt forms can be converted into the free base form by treatment with an appropriate base. The compounds according to Formula (I) containing acidic protons may also be converted into their therapeutically active non-toxic base salt forms by treatment with appropriate organic and inorganic bases. Appropriate base salt forms comprise, for example, the ammonium salts, the alkaline and earth alkaline metal salts, in particular lithium, sodium, potassium, magnesium and calcium salts, salts with organic bases, e.g. the benzathine, N-methyl-D-glucamine, hybramine salts, and salts with amino acids, for example arginine and lysine. Conversely, said salt forms can be converted into the free acid forms by treatment with an appropriate acid. The term solvate comprises the solvent addition forms as well as the salts thereof, which the compounds of formula (I) are able to form. Examples of such solvent addition forms are e.g. hydrates, alcoholates and the like. The term “stereochemically isomeric forms” as used hereinbefore defines all the possible isomeric forms that the compounds of Formula (I) may possess. Unless otherwise mentioned or indicated, the chemical designation of compounds denotes the mixture of all possible stereochemically isomeric forms, said mixtures containing all diastereomers and enantiomers of the basic molecular structure. The invention also embraces each of the individual isomeric forms of the compounds of Formula (I) and their salts and solvates, substantially free, i.e. associated with less than 10%, preferably less than 5%, in particular less than 2% and most preferably less than 1% of the other isomers. Thus, when a compound of formula (I) is for instance specified as (R), this means that the compound is substantially free of the (S) isomer. Stereogenic centers may have the R- or S-configuration; substituents on bivalent cyclic (partially) saturated radicals may have either the cis- or trans-configuration. Following CAS nomenclature conventions, when two stereogenic centers of known absolute configuration are present in a compound, an R or S descriptor is assigned (based on Cahn-Ingold-Prelog sequence rule) to the lowest-numbered chiral center, the reference center. The configuration of the second stereogenic center is indicated using relative descriptors [R*,R*] or [R*,S*], where R* is always specified as the reference center and [R*,R*] indicates centers with the same chirality and [R*,S*] indicates centers of unlike chirality. For example, if the lowest-numbered chiral center in the compound has an S configuration and the second center is R, the stereo descriptor would be specified as S−[R*,S*]. If “α” and “β” are used: the position of the highest priority substituent on the asymmetric carbon atom in the ring system having the lowest ring number, is arbitrarily always in the “α” position of the mean plane determined by the ring system. The position of the highest priority substituent on the other asymmetric carbon atom in the ring system (hydrogen atom in compounds according to Formula (I)) relative to the position of the highest priority substituent on the reference atom is denominated “α”, if it is on the same side of the mean plane determined by the ring system, or “β”, if it is on the other side of the mean plane determined by the ring system. In the framework of this application, an element, in particular when mentioned in relation to a compound according to Formula (I), comprises all isotopes and isotopic mixtures of this element, either naturally occurring or synthetically produced, either with natural abundance or in an isotopically enriched form. Radiolabelled compounds of Formula (I) may comprise a radioactive isotope selected from the group of 3H, 11C, 18F, 122I, 123I, 125I, 131I, 75Br, 76Br, 77Br and 82Br. Preferably, the radioactive isotope is selected from the group of 3H, 11C and 18F. Preparation The compounds according to the invention can generally be prepared by a succession of steps, each of which is known to the skilled person. In particular, the compounds can be prepared according to the following synthesis methods. The compounds of Formula (I) may be synthesized in the form of racemic mixtures of enantiomers which can be separated from one another following art-known resolution procedures. The racemic compounds of Formula (I) may be converted into the corresponding diastereomeric salt forms by reaction with a suitable chiral acid. Said diastereomeric salt forms are subsequently separated, for example, by selective or fractional crystallization and the enantiomers are liberated therefrom by alkali. An alternative manner of separating the enantiomeric forms of the compounds of Formula (I) involves liquid chromatography using a chiral stationary phase. Said pure stereochemically isomeric forms may also be derived from the corresponding pure stereochemically isomeric forms of the appropriate starting materials, provided that the reaction occurs stereospecifically.

Pharmacology The compounds provided in this invention are positive allosteric modulators of metabotropic glutamate receptors, in particular they are positive allosteric modulators of mGluR2. The compounds of the present invention do not appear to bind to the glutamate recognition site, the orthosteric ligand site, but instead to an allosteric site within the seven transmembrane region of the receptor.

At present, the fourth edition of the Diagnostic & Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) of the American Psychiatric Association provides a diagnostic tool for the identification of the disorders described herein. The person skilled in the art will recognize that alternative nomenclatures, nosologies, and classification systems for neurological and psychiatric disorders described herein exist, and that these evolve with medical and scientific progresses. Because such positive allosteric modulators of mGluR2, including compounds of Formula (I), enhance the response of mGluR2 to glutamate, it is an advantage that the present methods utilize endogenous glutamate. Because positive allosteric modulators of mGluR2, including compounds of Formula (I), enhance the response of mGluR2 to agonists, it is understood that the present invention extends to the treatment of neurological and psychiatric disorders associated with glutamate dysfunction by administering an effective amount of a positive allosteric modulator of mGluR2, including compounds of Formula (I), in combination with an mGluR2 agonist. The compounds of the present invention may be utilized in combination with one or more other drugs in the treatment, prevention, control, amelioration, or reduction of risk of diseases or conditions for which compounds of Formula (I) or the other drugs may have utility, where the combination of the drugs together are safer or more effective than either drug alone. Pharmaceutical Compositions The invention also relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent and, as active ingredient, a therapeutically effective amount of a compound according to the invention, in particular a compound according to Formula (I), a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, a solvate thereof or a stereochemically isomeric form thereof. The compounds according to the invention, in particular the compounds according to Formula (I), the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, the solvates and the stereochemically isomeric forms thereof, or any subgroup or combination thereof may be formulated into various pharmaceutical forms for administration purposes. As appropriate compositions there may be cited all compositions usually employed for systemically administering drugs. To prepare the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention, an effective amount of the particular compound, optionally in salt form, as the active ingredient is combined in intimate admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent, which carrier or diluent may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration. These pharmaceutical compositions are desirable in unitary dosage form suitable, in particular, for administration orally, rectally, percutaneously, by parenteral injection or by inhalation. For example, in preparing the compositions in oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed such as, for example, water, glycols, oils, alcohols and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations such as, for example, suspensions, syrups, elixirs, emulsions and solutions; or solid carriers such as, for example, starches, sugars, kaolin, diluents, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like in the case of powders, pills, capsules and tablets. Because of the ease in administration, oral administration is preferred, and tablets and capsules represent the most advantageous oral dosage unit forms in which case solid pharmaceutical carriers are obviously employed. For parenteral compositions, the carrier will usually comprise sterile water, at least in large part, though other ingredients, for example, to aid solubility, may be included. Injectable solutions, for example, may be prepared in which the carrier comprises saline solution, glucose solution or a mixture of saline and glucose solution. Injectable suspensions may also be prepared in which case appropriate liquid carriers, suspending agents and the like may be employed. Also included are solid form preparations that are intended to be converted, shortly before use, to liquid form preparations. In the compositions suitable for percutaneous administration, the carrier optionally comprises a penetration enhancing agent and/or a suitable wetting agent, optionally combined with suitable additives of any nature in minor proportions, which additives do not introduce a significant deleterious effect on the skin. Said additives may facilitate the administration to the skin and/or may be helpful for preparing the desired compositions. These compositions may be administered in various ways, e.g., as a transdermal patch, as a spot-on, as an ointment. It is especially advantageous to formulate the aforementioned pharmaceutical compositions in unit dosage form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Unit dosage form as used herein refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active ingredient calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. Examples of such unit dosage forms are tablets (including scored or coated tablets), capsules, pills, powder packets, wafers, suppositories, injectable solutions or suspensions and the like, and segregated multiples thereof. The exact dosage and frequency of administration depends on the particular compound of formula (I) used, the particular condition being treated, the severity of the condition being treated, the age, weight, sex, extent of disorder and general physical condition of the particular patient as well as other medication the individual may be taking, as is well known to those skilled in the art. Furthermore, it is evident that said effective daily amount may be lowered or increased depending on the response of the treated subject and/or depending on the evaluation of the physician prescribing the compounds of the instant invention. Depending on the mode of administration, the pharmaceutical composition will comprise from 0.05 to 99% by weight, preferably from 0.1 to 70% by weight, more preferably from 0.1 to 50% by weight of the active ingredient, and, from 1 to 99.95% by weight, preferably from 30 to 99.9% by weight, more preferably from 50 to 99.9% by weight of a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, all percentages being based on the total weight of the composition. As already mentioned, the invention also relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising the compounds according to the invention and one or more other drugs in the treatment, prevention, control, amelioration, or reduction of risk of diseases or conditions for which compounds of Formula (I) or the other drugs may have utility as well as to the use of such a composition for the manufacture of a medicament. The present invention also relates to a combination of a compound according to the present invention and a mGluR2 orthosteric agonist. The present invention also relates to such a combination for use as a medicine. The present invention also relates to a product comprising (a) a compound according to the present invention, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof or a solvate thereof, and (b) a mGluR2 orthosteric agonist, as a combined preparation for simultaneous, separate or sequential use in the treatment or prevention of a condition in a mammal, including a human, the treatment or prevention of which is affected or facilitated by the neuromodulatory effect of mGluR2 allosteric modulators, in particular positive mGluR2 allosteric modulators. The different drugs of such a combination or product may be combined in a single preparation together with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or diluents, or they may each be present in a separate preparation together with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or diluents.

These compounds appear to potentiate glutamate responses by binding to an allosteric site other than the glutamate binding site. The response of mGluR2 to a concentration of glutamate is increased when compounds of Formula (I) are present. Compounds of Formula (I) are expected to have their effect substantially at mGluR2 by virtue of their ability to enhance the function of the receptor. The behaviour of positive allosteric modulators tested at mGluR2 using the [35S]GTPγS binding assay method described below and which is suitable for the identification of such compounds, and more particularly the compounds according to Formula (I), are shown in Table 3. [35S]GTPγS Binding Assay The [35S]GTPγS binding assay is a functional membrane-based assay used to study G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) function whereby incorporation of a non-hydrolysable form of GTP, [35S]GTPγS (guanosine 5′-triphosphate, labelled with gamma-emitting 35S), is measured. The G-protein a subunit catalyzes the exchange of guanosine 5′-diphosphate (GDP) by guanosine triphosphate (GTP) and on activation of the GPCR by an agonist, [35S]GTPγS, becomes incorporated and cannot be cleaved to continue the exchange cycle (Harper (1998) Current Protocols in Pharmacology 2.6.1-10, John Wiley & Sons, Inc.). The amount of radioactive [35S]GTPγS incorporation is a direct measure of the activity of the G-protein and hence the activity of the agonist can be determined MGluR2 receptors are shown to be preferentially coupled to GαI-protein, a preferential coupling for this method, and hence it is widely used to study receptor activation of mGluR2 receptors both in recombinant cell lines and in tissues (Schaffhauser et al 2003, Pinkerton et al, 2004, Mutel et al (1998) Journal of Neurochemistry. 71:2558-64; Schaffhauser et al (1998) Molecular Pharmacology 53:228-33). Here we describe the use of the [35S]GTPγS binding assay using membranes from cells transfected with the human mGluR2 receptor and adapted from Schaffhauser et al ((2003) Molecular Pharmacology 4:798-810) for the detection of the positive allosteric modulation (PAM) properties of the compounds of this invention. Membrane Preparation CHO-cells were cultured to pre-confluence and stimulated with 5 mM butyrate for 24 hours, prior to washing in PBS, and then collected by scraping in homogenisation buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, 4° C.). Cell lysates were homogenized briefly (15 s) using an ultra-turrax homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 23 500×g for 10 minutes and the supernatant discarded. The pellet was resuspended in 5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 and centrifuged again (30 000×g, 20 min, 4° C.). The final pellet was resuspended in 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4 and stored at −80° C. in appropriate aliquots before use. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad, USA) with bovine serum albumin as standard. [35S]GTPγS Binding Assay Measurement of mGluR2 positive allosteric modulatory activity of test compounds in membranes containing human mGluR2 was performed using frozen membranes that were thawed and briefly homogenized prior to pre-incubation in 96-well microplates (15 μg/assay well, 30 minutes, 30° C.) in assay buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 50 μM GDP, 10 μg/ml saponin,) with increasing concentrations of positive allosteric modulator (from 0.3 nM to 50 μM) and either a minimal pre-determined concentration of glutamate (PAM assay), or no added glutamate. For the PAM assay, membranes were pre-incubated with glutamate at EC25 concentration, i.e. a concentration that gives 25% of the maximal response glutamate, and is in accordance to published data (Pin et al. (1999) Eur. J. Pharmacol. 375:277-294). After addition of [35S]GTPγS (0.1 nM, f.c.) to achieve a total reaction volume of 200 μl, microplates were shaken briefly and further incubated to allow [35S]GTPγS incorporation on activation (30 minutes, 30° C.). The reaction was stopped by rapid vacuum filtration over glass-fibre filter plates (Unifilter 96-well GF/B filter plates, Perkin-Elmer, Downers Grove, USA) microplate using a 96-well plate cell harvester (Filtermate, Perkin-Elmer, USA), and then by washing three times with 300 μl of ice-cold wash buffer (Na2PO4.2H2O 10 mM, NaH2PO4.H2O 10 mM, pH=7.4). Filters were then air-dried, and 40 μl of liquid scintillation cocktail (Microscint-O) was added to each well, and membrane-bound [35S]GTPγS was measured in a 96-well scintillation plate reader (Top-Count, Perkin-Elmer, USA). Non-specific [35S]GTPγS binding is determined in the presence of cold 10 μM GTP. Each curve was performed at least once using duplicate sample per data point and at 11 concentrations. Data Analysis The concentration-response curves of representative compounds of the present invention in the presence of added EC25 of mGluR2 agonist glutamate to determine positive allosteric modulation (PAM), were generated using the Prism GraphPad software (Graph Pad Inc, San Diego, USA). The curves were fitted to a four-parameter logistic equation (Y=Bottom+(Top-Bottom)/(1+10̂((Log EC50−X)*Hill Slope) allowing determination of EC50 values. The EC50 is the concentration of a compound that causes a half-maximal potentiation of the glutamate response. This is calculated by subtracting the maximal responses of glutamate in presence of a fully saturating concentration of a positive allosteric modulator from the response of glutamate in absence of a positive allosteric modulator. The concentration producing the half-maximal effect is then calculated as EC50. TABLE 3 Pharmacological data for compounds according to the invention. All compounds were tested in presence of mGluR2 agonist, glutamate at a predetermined EC25 concentration, to determine positive allosteric modulation (GTPγS-PAM). Values shown are averages of duplicate values of 11-concentration response curves, from at least one experiment. All tested compounds showed a pEC50 (−logEC50) value of more than 5.0, from 6.05 to 7.20. The error of determination of a pEC50 value for a single experiment is estimated to be about 0.3 log-units.
