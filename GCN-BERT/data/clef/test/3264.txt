DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION [0046] In the following detailed description of embodiments of this disclosure, reference is made to the accompanying drawings in which like references indicate similar elements, and in which is shown, by way of illustration, specific embodiments in which this disclosure may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice this disclosure, and it is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and that other changes may be made without departing from the scope of this disclosure. The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of this disclosure is defined only by the appended claims. As used in this disclosure, the term "or" shall be understood to be defined as a logical disjunction (i.e., and/or) and shall not indicate an exclusive disjunction unless expressly indicated as such with the term "either," "unless," "alternatively," and words of similar effect. I. DEFINITIONS [0047] The term "area under the curve" ("AUC") refers to the area under the curve defined by changes in the blood, plasma, or serum concentration of an active pharmaceutical ingredient (e.g., estradiol or progesterone), or one or more metabolites of the active pharmaceutical ingredient, over time following the administration of a dose of the active pharmaceutical ingredient. "AUCo-∞" is the area under the concentration-time curve extrapolated to infinity following the administration of a dose. "AUCo_t" is the area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to time t following the administration of a dose, wherein t is the last time point with measurable concentration. [0048] The term "Cmax" refers to the maximum value of blood, plasma, or serum concentration shown on the curve that represents changes in blood, plasma, or serum concentrations of an active pharmaceutical ingredient (e.g., progesterone or estradiol), or one or more metabolites of the active pharmaceutical ingredient, over time. [0049] The term "Tmax" refers to the time that it takes for the blood, plasma, or serum concentration of an active pharmaceutical ingredient (e.g., estradiol or progesterone), or of one or more metabolites of the active pharmaceutical ingredient, to reach the maximum value. [0050] Collectively, AUC, Cmax, and, optionally, Tmax are the principal pharmacokinetic parameters that can characterize the pharmacokinetic response of a particular drug product, such as progesterone or estradiol, in an animal, especially a mammal, including human, subject. [0051] An "active pharmaceutical ingredient" (API), as used herein, means the active compound or compounds used in formulating a drug product. APIs are generally safe for administering to animals, especially mammals, including humans, according to established governmental standards, including those promulgated by the United States Food and Drug Administration. [0052] The term "bioavailability" has the meaning as defined in 21 C.F.R. § 320.1(a): the rate and extent to which an API or active ingredient or active moiety is absorbed from a drug product and becomes available at the site of action. For drug products that are not intended to be absorbed into the bloodstream, bioavailability may be assessed by measurements intended to reflect the rate and extent to which the API or active ingredient or active moiety becomes available at the site of action. For example, bioavailability can be measured as the amount of API in the blood (whole bood, serum, or plasma) as a function of time. In embodiments, the amount of API is measured in blood plasma. Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters such as AUC, Cmax, or Tmax may be used to measure and assess bioavailability. [0053] The term "bioequivalent" has the meaning as defined in 21 C.F.R. § 320.1(e): the absence of a significant difference in the rate and extent to which the API or active ingredient or active moiety in pharmaceutical equivalents or pharmaceutical alternatives becomes available at the site of drug action when administered at the same molar dose under similar conditions in an appropriately designed study. Where there is an intentional difference in rate (e.g., in certain extended release dosage forms or modified release dosage forms), certain pharmaceutical equivalents or alternatives may be considered bioequivalent if there is no significant difference in the extent to which the active ingredient or moiety from each product becomes available at the site of drug action. This applies only if the difference in the rate at which the active ingredient or moiety becomes available at the site of drug action is intentional and is reflected in the proposed labeling, is not essential to the attainment of effective body drug concentrations on chronic use, and is considered medically insignificant for the drug. In practice, two products are considered bioequivalent if the 90% confidence interval of the AUC, Cmax, or optionally Tmax is within 80.00% to 125.00%. [0054] The term "bio-identical hormone" or "body-identical hormone" refers to an active pharmaceutical ingredient that is structurally identical to a hormone naturally or endogenously found in the human body (e.g., estradiol and progesterone). [0055] The term "estrogen" refers to a group of several female sex hormones produced primarily by the ovaries, including estradiol, estrone, and estriol. As used herein, unless otherwise specified, estrogen refers to estradiol. [0056] The term "estradiol" refers to (17P)-estra-l ,3,5(10)-triene-3, 17-diol. Estradiol is also interchangeably called 17P-estradiol, oestradiol, or E2, and is found endogenously in the human body. As used herein, estradiol refers to the bio-identical or body-identical form of estradiol found in the human body having the structure: [0057] As used herein, unless specified, estradiol includes estradiol in anhydrous or hemi- hydrate forms. For the purposes of this disclosure, the anhydrous form or the hemihydrate form can be substituted for the other by accounting for the water or lack of water according to well-known and understood techniques . [0058] The term "solubilized estradiol" means that the estradiol or a portion thereof is solubilized or dissolved in the solubilizing agents or the formulations disclosed herein. Solubilized estradiol may include estradiol that is about 80% solubilized, about 85% solubilized, about 90%> solubilized, about 95% solubilized, about 96%> solubilized, about 97% solubilized, about 98%> solubilized, about 99% solubilized or about 100% solubilized. In some embodiments, the estradiol is "fully solubilized" with all or substantially all of the estradiol being solubilized or dissolved in the solubilizing agent. Fully solubilized estradiol may include estradiol that is about 97% solubilized, about 98% solubilized, about 99% solubilized or about 100% solubilized. Solubility can be expressed as a mass fraction (% w/w, which is also referred to as wt %). [0059] The term "progesterone" refers to pregn-4-ene-3,20-dione. Progesterone is also interchangeably called P4 and is found endogenously in the human body. As used herein, progesterone refers to the bio-identical or body-identical form of progesterone found human body having the structure: [0060] The term "solubilized progesterone" means that the progesterone or a portion thereof is solubilized or dissolved in the solubilizing agents or the formulations disclosed herein disclosed herein. In some embodiments, the progesterone is "partially solubilized" with a portion of the progesterone being solubilized or dissolved in the solubilizing agent and a portion of the progesterone being suspended in the solubilizing agent. Partially solubilized progesterone may include progesterone that is about 1% solubilized, about 5% solubilized, about 10% solubilized, about 15% solubilized, about 20%> solubilized, about 30%> solubilized, about 40%o solubilized, about 50%> solubilized, about 60%> solubilized, about 70%> solubilized, about 80%) solubilized, about 85% solubilized, about 90%> solubilized or about 95% solubilized. In other embodiments, the progesterone is "fully solubilized" with all or substantially all of the progesterone being solubilized or dissolved in the solubilizing agent. Fully solubilized progesterone may include progesterone that is about 97% solubilized, about 98%o solubilized, about 99% solubilized or about 100% solubilized. Solubility can be expressed as a mass fraction (% w/w, which is also referred to as wt %). [0061] The terms "micronized progesterone" and "micronized estradiol," as used herein, include micronized progesterone and micronized estradiol, respectively, having an X50 particle size value below about 15 microns or having an X90 particle size value below about 25 microns. The term "X50" means that one-half of the particles in a sample are smaller in diameter than a given number. For example, micronized progesterone having an X50 of 5 microns means that, for a given sample of micronized progesterone, one-half of the particles have a diameter of less than 5 microns. Similarly, the term "X90" means that ninety percent (90%) of the particles in a sample are smaller in diameter than a given number. [0062] The term "solubilizing agent" refers to an agent or combination of agents that solubilize an active pharmaceutical ingredient (e.g., estradiol or progesterone). For example and without limitation, suitable solubilizing agents include medium chain oils and other solvents and co-solvents that solubilize or dissolve an active pharmaceutical ingredient to a desirable extent. Solubilizing agents suitable for use in the formulations disclosed herein are pharmaceutical grade solubilizing agents (e.g., pharmaceutical grade medium chain oils). It will be understood by those of skill in the art that other excipients or components can be added to or mixed with the solubilizing agent to enhance the properties or performance of the solubilizing agent or resulting formulation. Examples of such excipients include, but are not limited to, surfactants, emulsifiers, thickeners, colorants, flavoring agents, etc. In some embodiments, the solubilizing agent is a medium chain oil and, in some other embodiments, the medium chain oil is combined with a co-solvent(s) or other excipient(s). [0063] The term "medium chain" is used to describe the aliphatic chain length of fatty acid containing molecules. "Medium chain" specifically refers to fatty acids, fatty acid esters, or fatty acid derivatives that contain fatty acid aliphatic tails or carbon chains that contain between 6 (C6) and 14 (CI 4) carbon atoms. [0064] The terms "medium chain fatty acid" and "medium chain fatty acid derivative" are used to describe fatty acids or fatty acid derivatives with aliphatic tails (i.e., carbon chains) having 6 to 14 carbons. Fatty acids consist of an unbranched aliphatic tail attached to a carboxylic acid functional group. Fatty acid derivatives include, for example, fatty acid esters and fatty acid containing molecules, including, without limitation, mono-, di- and triglycerides that include components derived from fatty acids as well as fatty acid esters of ethylene or propylene glycol. Those of skill will appreciate that the aliphatic tails can be saturated or unsaturated (one or more double bonds between carbon atoms). In some embodiments, the aliphatic tails are saturated (i.e., no double bonds between carbon atoms). Medium chain fatty acids or medium chain fatty acid derivatives include those with aliphatic tails having 6-14 carbons, including those that are C6-C14, C6-C12, C8-C14, C8-C12, C6- CIO, C8-C10, or others. In embodiments, medium chain fatty acids or medium chain fatty acid derivatives are those that are saturated. Examples include, without limitation, caproic acid, caprylic acid, capric acid, lauric acid, myristic acid, and derivatives thereof. [0065] The term "oil," as used herein, refers to any pharmaceutically acceptable oil, and specifically excluding peanut oil, that can suspend or solubilize any suitable progesterone or estradiol, starting material, or precursor, including micronized progesterone or estradiol as described herein. [0066] The term "medium chain oil" refers to an oil wherein the composition of the fatty acid fraction of the oil is substantially medium chain (i.e., C6 to CI 4) fatty acids, i.e., the composition profile of fatty acids in the oil is substantially medium chain. As used herein, "substantially" means that between 20% and 100% (inclusive of the upper and lower limits) of the fatty acid fraction of the oil is made up of medium chain fatty acids, i.e., fatty acids with aliphatic tails (i.e., carbon chains) having 6 to 14 carbons. In some embodiments, about 25%, about 30%, about 35%, about 40%, about 45%, about 50%, about 55%, about 60%, about 65%o, about 70%, about 75%, about 85%, about 90% or about 95% of the fatty acid fraction of the oil is made up of medium chain fatty acids. Those of skill in the art that will readily appreciate that the terms "alkyl content" or "alkyl distribution" of an oil can be used in place of the term "fatty acid fraction" of an oil in characterizing a given oil or solubilizing agent, and these terms are used interchangeable herein. As such, medium chain oils suitable for use in the formulations disclosed herein include medium chain oils wherein the fatty acid fraction of the oil is substantially medium chain fatty acids, or medium chain oils wherein the alkyl content or alkyl distribution of the oil is substantially medium chain alkyls (C6-C12 alkyls). It will be understood by those of skill in the art that the medium chain oils suitable for use in the formulations disclosed herein are pharmaceutical grade (e.g., pharmaceutical grade medium chain oils). Examples of medium chain oils include, for example and without limitation, medium chain fatty acids, medium chain fatty acid esters of glycerol (e.g., for example, mono-, di-, and triglycerides), medium chain fatty acid esters of propylene glycol, medium chain fatty acid derivatives of polyethylene glycol, and combinations thereof. [0067] The term "ECN" or "equivalent carbon number" means the sum of the number of carbon atoms in the fatty acid chains of an oil, and can be used to characterize an oil as, for example, a medium chain oil or a long-chain oil. For example, tripalmitin (tripalmitic glycerol), which is a simple triglyceride containing three fatty acid chains of 16 carbon atoms, has an ECN of 3x16=48. Conversely, a triglyceride with an ECN=40 may have "mixed" fatty acid chain lengths of 8, 16, and 16; 10, 14, and 16; 8, 14, and 18; etc. Naturally occurring oils are frequently "mixed" with respect to specific fatty acids, but tend not to contain both long chain fatty acids and medium chain fatty acids in the same glycerol backbone. Thus, triglycerides with ECNs of 21-42 typically contain predominantly medium chain fatty acids; while triglycerides with ECNs of greater than 43 typically contain predominantly long chain fatty acids. For example, the ECN of corn oil triglyceride in the US Pharmacopeia (USP) would be in the range of 51-54. Medium chain diglycerides with ECNs of 12-28 will often contain predominantly medium chain fatty acids, while diglycerides with ECNs of 32 or greater will typically contain predominantly long chain fatty acids. Monoglycerides will have an ECN that matches the chain length of the sole fatty acid chain. Thus, monoglyceride ECNs in the range of 6-14 contain mainly medium chain fatty acids, and monoglycerides with ECNs 16 or greater will contain mainly long chain fatty acids. [0068] The average ECN of a medium chain triglyceride oil is typically 21-42. For example, as listed in the USP, medium chain triglycerides have the following composition as the exemplary oil set forth in the table below: and would have an average ECN of 3* [(6*0.02) + (8*.070) + (10*0.25) + (12*0.02) + (14*0.01)] = 25.8. The ECN of the exemplary medium chain triglycerides oil can also be expressed as a range (per the ranges set forth in the USP) of 24.9-27.0. For oils that have mixed mono-, di-, and triglycerides, or single and double fatty acid glycols, the ECN of the entire oil can be determined by calculating the ECN of each individual component (e.g., C8 monoglycerides, C8 diglycerides, CIO monoglycerides, and CIO diglycerides) and taking the sum of the relative percentage of the component multiplied by the ECN normalized to a monoglyceride for each component. For example, the oil having C8 and CIO mono- and diglycerides shown in the table below has an ECN of 8.3, and is thus a medium chain oil: Expressed differently, ECN can be calculated as each chain length in the composition multiplied by its relative percentage in the oil: (8*0.85) + (10*0.15) = 8.3. [0069] The term "excipients," as used herein, refers to non-active pharmaceutical ingredients such as solubilizing agents, anti-oxidants, oils, lubricants, and others used in formulating pharmaceutical products. [0070] The terms "treat," "treating," and "treatment" refer to any indicia of success in the treatment or amelioration of an injury, disease, or condition, including any objective or subjective parameter such as abatement; remission; diminishing of symptoms or making the injury, disease, or condition more tolerable to the patient; slowing in the rate of degeneration or decline; or improving a patient's physical or mental well-being. The treatment or amelioration of symptoms can be based on objective or subject parameters, including the results of a physical examination, neuropsychiatric examinations, or psychiatric evaluation.

In some embodiments, micronized estradiol has an X50 particle size value of less than about 15 microns, less than about 10 microns, less than about 5 microns or less than about 3 microns. In some embodiments, micronized estradiol has an X90 particle size value of less than about 25 microns, less than about 20 microns, or less than about 15 microns. In some embodiments, the composition comprises micronized and partially solubilized estradiol. [0075] In some embodiments, the composition comprises micronized progesterone. The progesterone active pharmaceutical ingredient may be micronized via any one of the multiple methods typically utilized by the ordinarily skilled artisan. In various embodiments, micronized progesterone has an X50 particle size value of less than about 15 microns, less than about 10 microns, less than about 5 microns or less than about 3 microns. In various embodiments, micronized progesterone has an X90 particle size value of less than about 25 microns, less than about 20 microns, or less than about 15 microns. Particle size may be determined in any suitable manner. For example, a Beckman Coulter LS 13 320 Laser Diffraction Particle Size Analyzer (the "Beckman Device") may be used to determine particle size. [0076] Estradiol and progesterone compositions and methods of preparing such compositions are described in U.S. Patent No. 8,633,178; U.S. Publication No. 2013/0129818; U.S. Publication No. 2013/0338123; International Publication No. WO 2013/078422; and International Publication No. WO 2013/192251; each of which is incorporated by reference in its entirety. Solubilizing Agents [0077] Estradiol and progesterone compositions of the present disclosure are prepared via blending with a solubilizing agent. In some embodiments, the solubilizing agent is a pharmaceutically acceptable oil that comprises a medium chain oil. In some embodiments, the solubilizing agent is a medium chain oil comprised substantially of C6-C12 medium chains, e.g., at least 20%, at least 30%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%, or at least 90% of the chains present in the oil are C6-C12. In some embodiments, the oil comprises at least one medium chain fatty acid such as medium chain fatty acids having at least one mono-, di-, or triglyceride, or derivatives thereof, or combinations thereof. In some embodiments, the medium chain oil comprises at least one medium chain fatty acid or propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, or glyceride having esters of medium chain fatty acids. In some embodiments, the solubilizing agent is not peanut oil. [0078] In some embodiments, oils used to solubilize estradiol and to suspend, partially suspend and partially solubilize, or fully solubilize progesterone include medium chain fatty acid esters, (e.g., esters of glycerol, polyethylene glycol, or propylene glycol) and mixtures thereof. In some embodiments, the medium chain fatty acids are C6, C8, CIO, C12, C6-C12, C8-C12, C6-C10, C8-C10, or C10-C12 fatty acids. In some embodiments, the medium chain fatty acids are saturated, or predominantly saturated, e.g., greater than about 50%> saturated, greater than about 60% saturated, or greater than about 75% saturated. In some embodiments, a solubilizing agent comprises predominantly medium chain length, saturated fatty acids or derivatives thereof, specifically predominantly C8 to C12 saturated fatty acids or derivatives thereof. [0079] In some embodiments, medium chain solubilizing agents include, for example and without limitation, saturated medium chain fatty acids or derivatives of saturated medium chain fatty acids: caproic acid (C6), enanthic acid (C7), caprylic acid (C8), pelargonic acid (C9), capric acid (CIO), undecylic acid (CI 1), lauric acid (CI 2), tridecylic acid (CI 3), or myristic acid (C14). In some embodiments, the solubilizing agent comprises oils made of these free medium chain fatty acids, oils of medium chain fatty acid esters of glycerin, propylene glycol, or ethylene glycol, or combinations thereof. These examples comprise predominantly saturated medium chain fatty acids (i.e., greater than 50% of the fatty acids are medium chain saturated fatty acids). In some embodiments, the solubilizing agent comprises predominantly C6 to C12 saturated fatty acids or derivatives of fatty acids. [0080] In some embodiments, the solubilizing agent comprises one or more mono-, di-, or triglycerides or combinations thereof. Exemplary glycerin based solubilizing agents include MlGLYOLs®, which are caprylic/capric triglycerides (SASOL Germany GMBH, Hamburg). MlGLYOLs® includes MIGLYOL® 810 (caprylic/capric triglyceride), MIGLYOL® 812 (caprylic/capric triglyceride), MIGLYOL® 816 (caprylic/capric triglyceride), and MIGLYOL® 829 (caprylic/capric/succinic triglyceride). Other caprylic/capric triglyceride solubilizing agents are likewise contemplated, including, for example: caproic/caprylic/capric/lauric triglycerides; caprylic/capric/linoleic triglycerides; or caprylic/capric/succinic triglycerides. Other exemplary caprylic/capric mono-, di-, or triiglyceride solubilizing agents include CAPMULs® (ABITEC, Columbus, Ohio), including, but are not limited to, CAPMUL® MCM, CAPMUL® MCM CIO, CAPMUL® MCM C8, CAPMUL® MCM C8 EP, and CAPMUL® 708 G . Other mono-, di-, and triglycerides of fractionated vegetable fatty acids, and combinations or derivatives thereof can be the solubilizing agent, according to embodiments. For example, the solubilizing agent can be 1 ,2,3-propanetriol (glycerol, glycerin, glycerine) esters of saturated coconut and palm kernel oil and derivatives thereof. [0081] In some embodiments, the solubilizing agent comprises one or more esters of propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, or combinations thereof. Exemplary propylene and polyethylene glycol based solubilizing agents include glyceryl mono- and di-caprylates; propylene glycol monocaprylate (e.g., CAPMUL® PG-8 or CAPMUL® PG-8 NF); propylene glycol monocaprate (e.g., CAPMUL® PG-10); propylene glycol monolaurate (e.g., CAPMUL® PG-12 EP/NF); propylene glycol mono- and dicaprylates; propylene glycol mono- and dicaprate; propylene glycol dicaprylate/dicaprate (e.g., MIGLYOL® 840); propylene glycol dilaurate (e.g., CAPMUL® PG-2L EP/NF); diethylene glycol mono ester (e.g., TRANSCUTOL®,2-(2-Ethoxyethoxy)ethanol, GATTEFOSSE SAS, Saint-Priest, France); and diethylene glycol monoethyl ether. [0082] In some embodiments, commercially available fatty acid glycerol and glycol ester solubilizing agents are prepared from natural oils and therefore may comprise components in addition to the fatty acid esters that predominantly comprise and characterize the solubilizing agent. Such other components may be, e.g., other fatty acid mono-, di-, and triglycerides, fatty acid mono- and diester ethylene or propylene glycols, free glycerols or glycols, or free fatty acids. For example, the Technical Data Sheet by ABITEC for CAPMUL® MCM C8 describes CAPMUL® MCM C8 as being composed of mono- and diglycerides of medium chain fatty acids (mainly caprylic) and describes the alkyl content as < 1% C6, > 95% C8, < 5% C IO, and < 1.5% C12 and higher. By way of further example, MIGLYOL® 812 is generally described as a C8-C10 triglyceride because the fatty acid composition is at least about 80%) caprylic (C8) acid and capric (C IO) acid. However, it can also comprise small amounts of other fatty acids, e.g., less than about 5% of caproic (C6) acid, lauric (C12) acid, and myristic (CI 4) acid. [0083] In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition comprises about 20% to about 85% solubilizing agent by weight, e.g., about 60%> to about 85% solubilizing agent by weight. In some embodiments, the composition comprises progesterone, e.g., dissolved and micronized, from about 20 to about 50 wt %, e.g., about 30 to about 35 wt %. In some embodiments, the composition comprises estradiol from about 0.1 to about 0.8 wt %, e.g., about 0.15 to about 0.40 wt %. Surfactants [0084] In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition further comprises one or more non-ionic or ionic surfactants. In some embodiments, the non-ionic surfactant is selected from one or more of glycerol and polyethylene glycol esters of medium chain fatty acids or long chain fatty acids, for example, lauroyl macrogol-32 glycerides or lauroyl polyoxyl-32 glycerides, commercially available as GELUCIRE®, including, for example, GELUCIRE® 39/01 (glycerol esters of saturated C12-C18 fatty acids); GELUCIRE® 43/01 (hard fat NF/JPE); GELUCIRE® 44/14 (lauroyl macrogol-32 glycerides EP, lauroyl polyoxyl-32 glycerides NF, lauroyl polyoxylglycerides (USA FDA IIG)); and GELUCIRE® 50/13 (stearoyl macrogol-32 glycerides EP, stearoyl polyoxyl-32 glycerides NF, stearoyl polyoxylglycerides (USA FDA IIG)). [0085] In some embodiments, non-ionic surfactants comprise combinations of mono- and di- propylene and ethylene glycols and mono-, di-, and triglyceride combinations. For example, in some embodiments, polyethylene glycol glyceride (GELUCIRE®, GATTEFOSSE SAS, Saint-Priest, France) can be used herein as the surfactant. For example, GELUCIRE® 44/14 (PEG-32 glyceryl laurate EP), a medium chain fatty acid esters of polyethylene glycol, is a polyethylene glycol glyceride composed of mono-, di- and triglycerides and mono- and diesters of polyethylene glycol. [0086] In some embodiments, non-ionic surfactants include, for example and without limitation: one or more of oleic acid, linoleic acid, palmitic acid, and stearic acid. In some embodiments, non-ionic surfactants comprise polyethylene sorbitol esters, including polysorbate 80, which is commercially available under the trademark TWEEN 80® (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Polysorbate 80 comprises approximately 60%-70% oleic acid with the remainder comprising primarily linoleic acids, palmitic acids, and stearic acids. [0087] In some embodiments, non-ionic surfactants include PEG-6 palmitostearate and ethylene glycol palmitostearate, which are available commercially as TEFOSE® 63 (GATTEFOSSE SAS, Saint-Priest, France), which can be used with, for example, CAPMUL® MCM having ratios of MCM to TEFOSE® 63 of, for example, 8:2 or 9: 1. Other exemplary solubilizing agents/non-ionic surfactants combinations include, without limitation: MIGLYOL® 812:GELUCIRE 50/13 or MIGLYOL® 812:TEFOSE® 63. [0088] A non-ionic or ionic surfactant may be used at concentrations greater than about 0.01%, for example at a concentration of about 0.01%- 10.0%, about 0.1% to 10.0%, or about 1% to 10.0%. In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition comprises about 10.0% surfactant by weight. In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition comprises about 0.1%) to about 5.0%) surfactant by weight, e.g., about 1.0 wt %. Other Excipients [0089] In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition further comprises one more other excipients, such as but not limited to colorants, flavoring agents, preservatives, and taste-masking agents. The choice of excipients will, to a large extent, depend on factors such as the particular mode of administration, the effect of the excipients on solubility and stability, and the nature of the dosage form. Colorants, for example, may comprise about 0.1% to about 2% by weight. Preservatives may comprise methyl and propyl paraben, for example, in a ratio of about 10: 1, and at a proportion of about 0.005% and 0.05% by weight. [0090] Generally, the solubilizing agents, surfactants, and excipients used in the pharmaceutical compositions described herein are non-toxic, pharmaceutically acceptable, compatible with each other, and maintain stability of the pharmaceutical composition and the various components with respect to each other. Additionally, the combination of various components that comprise the pharmaceutical compositions will maintain will result in the desired therapeutic effect when administered to a subject. Formulation [0091] In some embodiments, combinations of solubilizing agents {e.g., two or more oils) or combinations of one or more solubilizing agents and one or more surfactants are used to form estradiol and progesterone compositions. Various ratios of these solubilizing agents or solubilizing agents and surfactants can be used. For example, CAPMUL® MCM and a non- ionic surfactant, e.g., GELUCIRE® 44/14 (lauroyl macrogol-32 glycerides EP; lauroyl polyoxyl-32 glycerides NF; lauroyl polyoxylglycerides (USA FDA IIG)), can be used at ratios of about 99: 1 to about 2: 1, including, for example and without limitation: 60:40, 65:35, 70:30, 75:25, 80: 10, 80:15, 85:20, 90: 10, and 98: 1. As another example, CAPMUL® MCM and a non-ionic surfactant, e.g., TEFOSE® 63, can be used as rations of about 8:2 or 9:1. Other exemplary solubilizing agent/surfactant combinations include, without limitation: MIGLYOL® 812:GELUCIRE® 50/13 or MIGLYOL® 812:TEFOSE® 63. The ratios of oil {e.g., medium chain fatty acid esters of monoglycerides and diglycerides) to non-ionic surfactant can be significantly higher. For example, CAPMUL® MCM and GELUCIRE® can be used in ratios of up to about 65: 1, e.g., 8: 1, 22: 1, 49: 1, 65: 1 and 66: 1. Thus, useful ratios can be 8: 1 or greater, e.g., 60 to 70: 1. [0092] In some embodiments, estradiol or progesterone is soluble in the solubilizing agent at room temperature, although it may be desirable to warm certain solubilizing agents. For example, when the formulation comprises medium chain fatty acid mono- and diglycerides (e.g., CAPMUL® MCM) and polyethylene glycol glycerides (e.g., GELUCIRE®) as a surfactant, the oil or the surfactant can be warmed up, e.g., to about 65°C for the surfactant and less for the oil, to facilitate mixing of the oil and surfactant. The estradiol can be added at this temperature, or at lower temperatures as the mixture cools, e.g., about 40°C or about 30°C, or even after the mixture has cooled to room temperature. The progesterone can also be added as the mixture cools, e.g., to below about 40°C or to below about 30°C, or after the mixture has cooled to room temperature. [0093] As a non-limiting example, a composition of this disclosure comprises solubilized estradiol; progesterone, at least 30% (e.g., at least about 30%, about 40%>, about 50%>, about 60%), about 70%o, about 75%>, about 80%>, about 85%>, or more) of the progesterone being solubilized (the balance being micronized as discussed elsewhere herein); and a solubilizing agent that is an oil, wherein the oil comprises medium chain fatty acid mono-, di-, or triglycerides, with or without a surfactant. In certain embodiments, a specification for progesterone is set at >80%> solubilized, <20%> micronized or >85%> solubilized, <15%> micronized. Specific examples of such illustrative embodiments, with CAPMUL® MCM NF (glyceryl caprylate/caprate) as a solubilizing agent and GELUCIRE® 44/14 (lauroyl polyoxyglyceride) as a surfactant, in which at least about 85%> of the progesterone can be solubilized, include, e.g., the following five formulations A-E: Table 1. Pharmaceutical Composition A - progesterone 50 mg / estradiol 0.25 mg Ingredient Amount (% w/w) Qty/Capsule (mg) Estradiol Hemihydrate 0.34 2.06 CAPMUL® MCM, NF 65.32 391.94 GELUCIRE® 44/14, NF 1.00 6.00 Total 100.00 600.00 * Note: 1.00 mg Estradiol is equivalent to 1.03 mg Estradiol Hemihydrate [0094] In general terms, the above formulations comprise 30 to 35 wt % progesterone, 0.1 to 0.4 wt % estradiol (or estradiol hemihydrate), 55 to 75 wt % of an oil that is predominantly medium chain fatty acid mono-, di-, or triglycerides, such as CAPMUL® MCM, and 0.5 to 10 wt % of a non-ionic surfactant, such as GELUCIRE® 44/14. The above formulations may be modified to comprise excipients, e.g., gelatin such as Gelatin 200 Bloom, glycerin, coloring agents such as Opatint red and white, and, optionally, MIGLYOL® 812. [0095] Estradiol solubilization helps ensure high content uniformity and enhanced stability. Fully solubilized progesterone formulations or partially solubilized progesterone formulations in which at least about 50% of the progesterone, e.g., at least about 50%, 60%>, 70%>, 75%, 80%), 85%), 90%), 95%o or more, is solubilized appear to provide improved PK-related properties. Pharmacokinetic Parameters of Estradiol and Progesterone Compositions [0096] The pharmaceutical compositions of this disclosure can be formulated to provide desirable pharmacokinetic parameters in a subject {e.g., a female subject) to whom the composition is administered. In some embodiments, a pharmaceutical composition as described herein produces desirable pharmacokinetic parameters for progesterone in the subject. In some embodiments, a pharmaceutical composition as described herein produces desirable pharmacokinetic parameters for estradiol in the subject. In some embodiments, a pharmaceutical composition as described herein produces desirable pharmacokinetic parameters for one or more metabolites of progesterone or estradiol in the subject, for example, estrone or total estrone. [0097] Following the administration of a composition comprising progesterone and estradiol to a subject, the concentration and metabolism of progesterone or estradiol can be measured in a sample {e.g., a blood, serum, or plasma sample) from the subject. Progesterone is metabolized to pregnanediols and pregnanolones, which are then conjugated to glucuronide and sulfate metabolites that are excreted or further recycled. Estradiol is converted reversibly to estrone, and both estradiol and estrone can be converted to the metabolite estriol. In postmenopausal women, a significant proportion of circulating estrogens exist as sulfate conjugates, especially estrone sulfate. Thus, estrone can be measured with respect to "estrone" amounts (excluding conjugates such as estrone sulfate) and "total estrone" amounts (including both free, or unconjugated, estrone and conjugated estrone such as estrone sulfate). [0098] The pharmaceutical compositions of this disclosure can be characterized for one or more pharmacokinetic parameters of progesterone, estradiol, or a metabolite thereof following administration of the composition to a subject or to a population of subjects. These pharmacokinetic parameters include AUC, Cmax, and Tmax. AUC is a determination of the area under the curve (AUC) plotting the blood, serum, or plasma concentration of drug along the ordinate (Y-axis) against time along the abscissa (X-axis). AUCs are well understood, frequently used tools in the pharmaceutical arts and have been extensively described. Cmax is well understood in the art as an abbreviation for the maximum drug concentration in blood, serum, or plasma of a subject. Tmax is well understood in the art as an abbreviation for the time to maximum drug concentration in blood, serum, or plasma of a subject. [0099] In some embodiments, one or more pharmacokinetic parameters, e.g., AUC, Cmax, or Tmax, is measured for estradiol. In some embodiments, one or more pharmacokinetic parameters, e.g., AUC, Cmax, or Tmax, is measured for progesterone. In some embodiments, one or more pharmacokinetic parameters, e.g., AUC, Cmax, or Tmax, is measured for estrone. In some embodiments, one or more pharmacokinetic parameters, e.g., AUC, Cmax, or Tmax, is measured for total estrone. [0100] Any of a variety of methods can be used for measuring the levels of progesterone, estradiol, estrone, or total estrone in a sample, including immunoassays, mass spectrometry (MS), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with ultraviolet fluorescent detection, liquid chromatography in conjunction with mass spectrometry (LC-MS), tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC- MS/MS). In some embodiments, the levels of progesterone, estradiol, estrone, or total estrone are measured using a validated LC-MS/MS method. Methods of measuring hormone levels are well described in the literature. [0101] The levels of progesterone, estradiol, estrone, or total estrone can be measured in any biological sample, e.g. a tissue or fluid such as blood, serum, plasma, or urine. In some embodiments, the sample is blood or plasma. In some embodiments, the levels of progesterone, estradiol, estrone, or total estrone are measured about 0.0, 0.10, 0.20, 0.05, 0.30, 0.35, 0.40, 0.45, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, 42, 45, or 48 hours after dosing, or any other appropriate time period that is common or useful in determining the levels of each of the hormones. In some embodiments, the levels of progesterone, estradiol, estrone, or total estrone are measured about 18 hours, about 24 hours, about 18-36 hours, about 20-30 hours, about 22-26 hours, about 24-36 hours, about 36 hours, about 36-48 hours, about 40-48 hours, or about 48 hours after administration of a single dose or a first dose. Generally, assays to determine the levels of progesterone, estradiol, estrone, or total estrone are measured one or more times every 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 60, 120, 360, 480, 720, or 1440 minutes after administration, or combinations thereof (e.g., the first measurements are taken every 15 minutes for the first hour, followed by every 120 minutes thereafter). In embodiments, the timing of such measurements are designed to accurately measure Cmax, max, or AUC. Timing can be adjusted based on the given circumstances (i.e., one formulation may cause a more rapid Cmax, in which case the initial times would be clustered closer together, closer to time zero, or both to ensure accurate measurement of Cmax, Tmax, and AUC). In some embodiments, the Cmax, Tmax, or AUC values for progesterone, estradiol, estrone, or total estrone are measured following administration of a single dose of a pharmaceutical composition as described herein. [0102] In some embodiments, the values for Cmax, Tmax, or AUC represent a number of values taken from all the subjects in a patient population and are, therefore, mean values (e.g., arithmetic or geometric means) averaged over the entire population. [0103] In some embodiments, oral administration of a pharmaceutical composition comprising estradiol, progesterone, and a medium chain solubilizing agent as described herein to a subject, or to a population of subjects, produces one or more AUC, Cmax, or Tmax parameters, or one or more mean AUC, mean Cmax, or mean Tmax parameters, respectively, for estradiol, progesterone, estrone, or total estrone as described below. AUC, Cmax, and Tmax parameters (A) [0104] In some embodiments, a pharmaceutical composition of this disclosure comprises estradiol at a dosage of about 0.25 mg and progesterone at a dosage of about 50 mg. In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition comprises the formulation of Formulation A in Table 1 above. [0105] In some embodiments, administration of a composition comprising about 0.25 mg estradiol and about 50 mg progesterone to a subject produces, in a plasma sample from the subject, one or both parameters selected from: (i) an AUC(o-t) for estradiol that is from 140.3733 pg-hr/ml to 219.3333 pg-hr/ml; or (ii) a Cmax for estradiol that is from 6.4790 pg/ml to 10.1235 pg/ml. [0106] In some embodiments, administration of the composition to the subject produces both an AUC(0-t) for estradiol that is from 140.3733 pg-hr/ml to 219.3333 pg-hr/ml, and a Cmax for estradiol that is from 6.4790 pg/ml to 10.1235 pg/ml. [0107] In some embodiments, administration of the composition to the subject further produces, in a plasma sample from the subject, one or both parameters selected from: (i) an AUC(o-t) for progesterone that is from 24.0174 ng-hr/ml to 37.5272 ng-hr/ml; or (ii) a Cmax for progesterone that is from 17.8444 ng/ml to 27.8819 ng/ml. [0108] In some embodiments, administration of the composition to the subject produces both an AUC(o-t) for progesterone that is from 24.0174 ng-hr/ml to 37.5272 ng-hr/ml, and a Cmax for progesterone that is from 17.8444 ng/ml to 27.8819 ng/ml. [0109] In some embodiments, administration of the composition to the subject produces, in a plasma sample from the subject, (i) an AUC(0-t) for estradiol that is from 140.3733 pg-hr/ml to 219.3333 pg-hr/ml; (ii) a Cmax for estradiol that is from 6.4790 pg/ml to 10.1235 pg/ml; (iii) an AUC(0-t) for progesterone that is from 24.0174 ng-hr/ml to 37.5272 ng-hr/ml; or (iv) a Cmax for progesterone that is from 17.8444 ng/ml to 27.8819 ng/ml. [0110] In some embodiments, administration of the composition to the subject further produces, in a plasma sample from the subject, a Tmax for estradiol that is from 7.2 hr to 11.3 hr. In some embodiments, administration of the composition to the subject further produces, in a plasma sample from the subject, a Tmax for progesterone that is from 2.4 hr to 3.8 hr. [0111] In some embodiments, administration of the pharmaceutical composition to the subject produces, in a plasma sample from the subject, one, two, three or more parameters selected from: (i) an AUC(o-t) for estradiol that is from 140.3733 pg-hr/ml to 219.3333 pg-hr/ml; (ii) a Cmax for estradiol that is from 6.4790 pg/ml to 10.1235 pg/ml; (iii) an AUC(0-t) for progesterone that is from 24.0174 ng-hr/ml to 37.5272 ng-hr/ml; or (iv) a Cmax for progesterone that is from 17.8444 ng/ml to 27.8819 ng/ml. [0112] In some embodiments, administration of the pharmaceutical composition to the subject produces both parameters (i) and (ii). In some embodiments, administration of the composition to the subject produces both parameters (i) and (iii). In some embodiments, administration of the composition to the subject produces both parameters (i) and (iv). In some embodiments, administration of the composition to the subject produces both parameters (ii) and (iii). In some embodiments, administration of the composition to the subject produces both parameters (ii) and (iv). In some embodiments, administration of the composition to the subject produces both parameters (iii) and (iv). In some embodiments, administration of the composition to the subject produces all of parameters (i), (ii), and (iii). In some embodiments, administration of the composition to the subject produces both parameters (i), (iii), and (iv). In some embodiments, administration of the composition to the subject produces both parameters (ii), (iii), and (iv). In some embodiments, administration of the composition to the subject produces all of parameters (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv). [0113] In some embodiments, administration of the pharmaceutical composition to the subject further produces, in a plasma sample from the subject, one or more parameters selected from: (i) an AUC(o-t) for estrone that is from 909.6091 pg-hr/ml to 1421.2642 pg-hr/ml; (ii) a Cmax for estrone that is from 42.6549 pg/ml to 66.6483 pg/ml; or (iii) a Tmax for estrone that is from 4.4 hr to 6.9 hr.

[0115] In some embodiments, a pharmaceutical composition comprising about 0.25 mg estradiol and about 50 mg progesterone is administered to a population of subjects in need thereof, and mean parameters are determined for samples (e.g., blood or plasma samples) from the subjects administered the composition. Thus, in some embodiments, administration of the composition to a population of subject produces, in plasma samples from the subjects, one or more of a mean AUC(o-t) for estradiol that is from 140.3733 pg-hr/ml to 219.3333 pg-hr/ml, a mean Cmax for estradiol that is from 6.4790 pg/ml to 10.1235 pg/ml, and a mean Tmax for estradiol that is from 7.2 hr to 1 1.3 hr. In some embodiments, administration of the composition to a population of subject produces, in plasma samples from the subjects, one or more of a mean AUC(o-t) for progesterone that is from 24.0174 ng-hr/ml to 37.5272 ng-hr/ml, a mean Cmax for progesterone that is from 17.8444 ng/ml to 27.8819 ng/ml, and a mean Tmax for progesterone that is from 2.4 hr to 3.8 hr. In some embodiments, administration of the composition to a population of subject produces, in plasma samples from the subjects, one or more of a mean AUC(o-t) for estrone that is from 909.6091 pg-hr/ml to 1421.2642 pg-hr/ml, a mean Cmax for estrone that is from 42.6549 pg/ml to 66.6483 pg/ml, and a mean Tmax for estrone that is from 4.4 hr to 6.9 hr.

EXAMPLE 5 [0192] Pharmacokinetics of the First Combination 17P-Estradiol/Progesterone Capsule in Clinical Development for Hormone Therapy [0193] The objective of this study was to evaluate the pharmacokinetic and oral bioavailability of a combination capsule of 17P-estradiol/progesterone in comparison to coadministration of the individual products ESTRACE® and PROMETRIUM® . [0194] Subjects and Study Design: An open label, balanced, randomized, single-dose, 2- treatment, 3 -period, 3 -sequence, crossover, partial-rep licate, reference-scaled, oral, relative bioavailability study compared the bioavailability of an investigational 2-mg 17β- estradiol/200-mg progesterone combination capsule, without peanut oil (formulated in a manner similar to that set forth in Table 9), with that of co-administered 200-mg PROMETRIUM® (progesterone) and 2-mg ESTRACE® (17P-estradiol) tablets in healthy postmenopausal women aged 40-65 years (N=66). Key inclusion criteria for subjects included a BMI 18.50 to 29.99 kg/m2 who were nonsmokers or ex-smokers (no smoking in the last 3 months). Key exclusion criteria for subjects included consuming grapefruit juice or poppy-containing foods within 48 hours before and throughout the study, use of any hormonal agent within 14 days before the study, and use of menopausal hormone therapy within 6 months before dosing. [0195] Patients were randomly assigned sequentially to 1 of 3 dosing sequences of the same dose of the combination capsule (Test, T) and reference products (Reference, R): TRR, RTR, or RRT. 66 subjects were randomized and 62 (94.0%) completed the study. Subjects had a mean age of 49.5 ± 5.6 years (range 40 to 64) and a mean BMI of 24.8 ± 3.1 kg/m2 (range 18.7-29.9). [0196] After consuming a high-fat, high-calorie breakfast, each woman received a single dose of the combination (Test) capsule in 1 period of the study and single doses of the coadministered products (Reference) in each of the 2 remaining periods. Blood samples were collected within 75 minutes before dosing and post-dose at 0.25, 0.5, 0.67, 0.83, 1, 1.33, 1.67, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 48 hours after dosing to determine progesterone, free (unconjugated) estradiol, and free and total (conjugated+free, including estrone sulfates) estrone concentrations. After collection of blood samples at each time point, the blood samples were centrifuged at 4000 RPM for 10 minutes at 4°C to separate the plasma. The plasma from samples was separated into two aliquots. 1.5 mL from the plasma sample was transferred into aliquot I, and the remaining plasma sample was transferred into aliquot II. These aliquots were stored at -30°C for interim storage, then at -70°C until completion of the analysis. [0197] Progesterone, estradiol, estrone, and total estrone in human plasma was determined using the LC-MS/MS method. The primary (Cmax, AUCo-t, and AUCo-∞) and secondary (Tmax, t½, and Ke) PK parameters for each analyte were determined for each subject during each period by non-compartment analyses using baseline-adjusted concentrations. Statistical analyses were conducted using the SAS® statistical software. [0198] Results: The mean, standard deviation (SD), geometric mean, coefficient of variation (CV %), minimum, median, and maximum were calculated for Cmax, AUCo-t, AUCo- ∞, Tmax, ti/2, Kei, Kenower, Kipper, and AUCo/oExtrap obs for progesterone, estradiol, estrone, and total estrone. The results are presented in Tables 10, 11, 12, and 13 below. For each of Tables 10-13, "Test Product (T)" refers to the progesterone + estradiol pharmaceutical composition, while "Reference product (Rl)" and "Reference product (R2)" refers to co- administered PROMETRIUM® (progesterone) and ESTRACE® (estradiol).
