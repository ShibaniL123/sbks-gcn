Preparation of N-(4-fluorobenzyl)-1-methylpiperidin-4-amine Dihydrochloride (Compound V×2HCl)
In a 100 mL round bottom flask, equipped with a stir bar, 4-fluorobenzylamine (10 mL, 0.088 mol) was dissolved in dry MeCN (110 mL), then 1-methylpiperidin-4-one (10.54 mL, 0.092 mol) was added and the reaction mixture was stirred at ambient temperature under N2 atmosphere for 18 h to give the desired imine solution.
Reduction of the resulting imine was performed in a 250 mL reactor. Reactor was purged with N2 and NaBH(OAc)3 (29.84 g, 0.14 mol) was suspended in MeCN (80 mL). The suspension was cooled to 0-5° C. and solution of the imine in MeCN was added dropwise during 20 min. After the addition was completed, temperature was increased to 20° C. in 5° C. increments, during 1 h. After 2.5 h at 20° C., the reaction was quenched with addition of water (200 mL). Then DCM (100 mL) was added and pH was adjusted to 2 with 5M HCl solution. Layers were separated and aqueous one washed with DCM 2×100 mL, basified to pH 9.5 with 6M NaOH and extracted with DCM 2×100 mL. The combined organic layers were transferred to a 500 mL reactor and cooled to 10-15° C. To the resulting solution, 5-6 N HCl in 2-PrOH (3 equiv., 0.264 mmol) was added dropwise over 30 min. and white crystals were formed. The suspension was then cooled to 0-5° C. and stirred for 2 hours.
Crystals were filtered off, washed with 2×50 mL of DCM, dried at 50° C./10 mbar for 15 hours yielding 21.95 g (84.5%) of N-(4-fluorobenzyl)-1-methylpiperidin-4-amine dihydrochloride (Compound V×2HCl).

Preparation of N-(4-fluorobenzyl)-1-methylpiperidin-4-amine dihydrochloride (Compound V×2HCl)
In a 50 mL three necked round bottom flask, equipped with a stir bar, thermometer and under N2 atmosphere, 4-fluorobenzylamine (10 mL, 0.088 mol) was cooled to 0-5° C. and 1-methylpiperidin-4-one (12.2 mL, 0.106 mol) was added dropwise over 15 min. After the addition was completed, reaction mixture was stirred at 0-5° C. for additional 30 minutes to give the desired imine solution.
Reduction of the resulting imine was performed in a 500 mL three necked round bottom flask. The flask was purged with N2 and NaBH4 (5.32 g, 0.14 mol) was suspended in MeCN (50 mL). The suspension was cooled to 0-5° C. and solution of glacial acetic acid (24.1 mL, 0.42 mol) in MeCN (60 mL) was added dropwise over 60 minutes to give desired NaBH(OAc)3. The solution of the imine in MeCN was then added dropwise into the suspension of in situ prepared NaBH(OAc)3 at 0-5° C., over 30 min. After the addition was completed, reaction mixture was stirred at 0-5° C. for 1 hour and additionally 1.5 hours at 20° C. The reaction was quenched with addition of water (200 mL) and pH was adjusted to 2 with 5M HCl solution. After extraction with DCM (2×100 mL), layers were separated and aqueous one was basified to pH 9.5 with 6M NaOH and extracted with DCM (2×100 mL). The combined organic layers were transferred to a 500 mL three necked round bottom flask and cooled to 0-5° C. To the resulting solution, 5-6 N HCl in 2-PrOH (3 equiv., 0.264 mmol) was added dropwise over 10 min. and white crystals were formed. The suspension was stirred at 0-5° C. for 1 hour.
Crystals were filtered off, washed with 2x50 mL of DCM, dried at 45° C./10 mbar for 10 hours yielding 21.62 g (83.3%) of N-(4-fluorobenzyl)-1-methylpiperidin-4-amine dihydrochloride (Compound V×2HCl).

Preparation of N-(4-fluorobenzyl)-1-methylpiperidin-4-amine dihydrochloride (Compound V×2HCl)
In a 100 mL three round bottom flask, equipped with a stir bar, thermometer and under N2 atmosphere, 4-fluorobenzylamine (10 mL, 0.088 mol) was cooled to 0-5° C. and 1-methylpiperidin-4-one (12.05 mL, 0.106 mol) was added dropwise over 20 min. After the addition was completed, temperature was increased to ambient temperature and stirred for next 2 h.
Reduction of the resulting imine was performed in a 600 mL autoclave with addition of Raney-Ni (3.3 g, 30 wt. %), glacial acetic acid (5.03 mL, 0.088 mol), MeOH (75 mL) and at 5 bar pressure for 66 h. After filtration of catalyst through Celite, the solution was concentrated to 50 mL and water (100 mL) and DCM (100 mL) were added. pH of this solution was adjusted to 2 with 5M HCl. Layers were separated and aqueous one washed with once again with DCM (100 mL), basified to pH 9.5 with 6M NaOH and extracted with DCM 2×100 mL. The combined organic layers were transferred to a 500 mL reactor and cooled to 10-15° C. To the resulting solution, 5-6 N HCl in 2-PrOH (3 equiv., 0.264 mol) was added dropwise over 30 min. and white crystals were formed. The suspension was then cooled to 0-5° C. and stirred for 2 hours.
