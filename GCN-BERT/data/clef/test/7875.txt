Technical Field The invention relates to the field of parts of a sunshade umbrella, in particular to a controllable automatic umbrella unfolding device. Background A traditional sunshade umbrella is opened in such a manner of: driving the umbrella rope and the pull lever through an umbrella unfolding crank, and then pushing by hand; such a crank-opening way has the defects of troublesome umbrella unfolding, slow opening speed and high breakage possibility of the umbrella rope; there is another pull lever-type opening and closing device, which, however, is high in umbrella position after pull lever-type closing and also quite inconvenient.

Detailed Description of the Embodiments The invention will be further described below by the embodiments with reference to the accompanying drawings. Embodiment 1: as shown in FIG.1, FIG.2, FIG.3, FIG.4 and FIG.5, a controllable automatic umbrella unfolding device comprises an upper runner 18, a middle runner 19, a lower runner 20 and a center bar 13, the upper runner 18 of the umbrella is fixed at the top end of the center bar 13, the middle runner 19 and the lower runner 20 of the umbrella are movably sleeved on the center bar 13, the upper runner 18 is connected with long ribs 15, the long ribs 15 are connected with short ribs 16, the middle runner 19 is connected with branch ribs 17, the branch ribs 17 are connected with the short ribs 16, the short ribs 16 are connected with the lower runner 20, a gas spring is disposed in the center bar 13, the tail end of a cylinder barrel 4 of the gas spring is connected with the middle runner 19 of the umbrella, a valve 14 is arranged at the end of a piston rod 5 of the gas spring, a valve opening device is disposed corresponding to the valve 14, the valve opening device comprises a gas spring support 12, a U-shaped sheet metal part 6, a driving lever 8, a lever 9, a pin shaft 10 and a spring 3, the gas spring support 12 is fixed at a specified position of the center bar 13 through a screw I 1, a screw II 7 on the U-shaped sheet metal part 6 is sleeved inside a pair of long through holes 11 on the nitrogen spring support 12, the U-shaped sheet metal part 6 is movably connected to the nitrogen spring support 12 through the screw II 7, the end of the piston rod 5 of the nitrogen spring, after the spring 3 is sleeved thereon, passes through the U-shaped sheet metal part 6 and is then fixed on the nitrogen spring support 12 through a nut 2, the lever 9 is erected on the screw II 7 and movably connected to the nitrogen spring support 12 through the pin shaft 10, and the driving lever 8 is fixedly connected with the lever 9. In practical use, the valve opening device controls free positioning of the umbrella in its opening process by moving the driving lever; the controllable gas spring is featured by the fact that: stroke that is controlled by valve opening and closing can be stopped at any position. The working principle is that: when the umbrella is about to be closed, the lower runner is gripped and moved downwards, at the same time, the cylinder barrel of the nitrogen spring is moved downwards to drive the U-shaped sheet metal part to be moved downwards against the elasticity of the spring, the screw II that is fixed on the U-shaped sheet metal part is moved downwards, the lever swings downwards around the pin shaft owing to the elasticity of the valve (the valve is stretched out because of own elasticity, and the valve is closed under the default state), the valve is stopped at the current stroke after being completely stretched out to be closed, thus positioning for umbrella closing is accomplished; when the umbrella is about to be opened, the driving lever is moved upwards to open the valve, the valve is retracted into the piston rod of the nitrogen spring, in the meantime, the cylinder barrel of the nitrogen spring is moved upwards, and umbrella unfolding is then accomplished based upon the structural relationship of the product. The controllable gas spring functions as follows: in case of umbrella closing, the built-in gas spring is compressed at a position where the stroke is close to the limit and is under a state of compression and preparation for bounce, at this moment, the valve is closed so that the stroke is located at the position of the bottom end that is close to the limit, thereby ensuring the closing state of the umbrella; when the valve is opened by moving the driving lever, the gas spring resets to drive the middle runner to move towards the upper runner, and in accordance with the structural relationship in assembly, the middle runner is connected with the branch ribs, the branch ribs are connected with the short ribs, and then, the short ribs drive the lower runner to move towards the upper runner, until the umbrella cover is unfolded to realize umbrella unfolding.
