Step 2: 5-((3R,5S,6R)-5-tert-butoxycarbonylamino-6-(2,5-difluorophenyl)tetrahydro-2H -pyran-3-yl)-3-methyl-1-methylsulfonyl-1,4,5,6-tetrahydropyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrazole
To tetrahydrofuran (10 mL) were added 5-((3R,5S,6R)-5-tert-butoxycarbonylamino-6-(2,5-difluorophenyl)tetrahydro-2H-pyran-3-yl)-3-methyl-1,4,5,6-tetrahydropyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrazole (145 mg, 0.33 mmol) and triethylamine (53 mg, 0.53 mmol), and cooled in an ice bath. Methylsulfonyl chloride (49 mg, 0.43 mmol) was then added, and stirred for 2 hours. The reaction mixture was poured into water, and extracted with dichloromethane. The organic phase was dried, and the residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography to give 5-((3R,5S,6R)-5-tert-butoxycarbonylamino-6-(2,5-difluorophenyl)tetrahydro-2H-pyran-3-yl)-3-methyl-1-methylsulfonyl-1,4,5,6-tetrahydropyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrazole (16 mg). Yield: 9.5%.
