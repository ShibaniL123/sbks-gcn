PHARMACOLOGICALLY ACTIVE QUINAZOLINEDIONE DERIVATIVES FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present disclosure relates to pharmacologically active quinazolinedione derivatives, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts or esters thereof, as well as to pharmaceutical compositions containing them and to their use as positive allosteric modulators of the γ-aminobutyric acid class B (GABAB) receptor. They can be used in isotopically unlabeled or labeled form. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION γ-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the adult mammalian central nervous system (CNS) mediating its effect through ionotrophic GABAA and GABAc receptors and metabotrophic GABAB receptors. GABAB receptors are widely distributed in the CNS as well as in peripheral tissues. The receptor is present both on presynaptic terminals and postsynaptic neurons involved in fine-tuning of several neurotransmitter systems. GABAB receptors belong to class C of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) in the same class as metabotrophic glutamate receptors, calcium sensing receptors, taste receptors, and a number of orphan receptors. A specific feature of GABAB receptors, contrary to other GPCRs, is the function as obligatory heterodimers comprised of two subunits, GABAB i and GABAB2. The GABAei subunit is the site for binding of the orthosteric ligand and the GABAB2 subunit is responsible for signaling and coupling of the receptor to intracellular G proteins. Binding of an orthosteric ligand to the N-terminal Venus flytrap domain in the GABABi subunit induces a conformational change and activation of the GABAB2 subunit and further activation of intracellular signaling. GABAB receptors couple via Ga, proteins to inhibit adenylyl cyclase activity and via ϋβγ subunits to regulate the activity of inwardly rectifying potassium channels and voltage-sensitive calcium channels. Mutational studies have shown that the allosteric site is distinct from the orthosteric site residing within the transmembrane domain of the GABAB2 subunit (Binet, V. et al. Journal of Biological Chemistry, 279 (2004) 29085). Dysfunction in the GABAergic system or other neurotransmitter systems controlled by the activity of the GABAergic system has been implicated in a number of CNS disorders (Bowery, N. G. et al. Pharmacological Reviews, 54 (2002) 247). Therefore, GABAB receptor activating compounds, such as positive allosteric modulators of the GABAB receptor, could be useful in the treatment of several diseases, such as essential tremor, Parkinsonian tremor, levodopa-induced dyskinesia, Parkinsonian motor symptoms, Parkinsonian non-motor symptoms, spasticity related to multiple sclerosis, spasticity related to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, spasticity related to spinal cord injury, spasticity related to cerebral injury, dystonia, chronic pain, addiction, anxiety, epilepsy, autism, fragile X syndrome, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, insomnia, narcolepsy, Alzheimer's disease, dementia, Charcot Marie Tooth 1A neuropathy, overactive bladder, gastroesophageal reflux disease, inflammatory bowel disease, or chronic tinnitus. The GABAB receptor agonist baclofen is in clinical use for the treatment of spastic movement disorders and as a muscle relaxant. Despite the selectivity and potency as GABAB agonist, the compound has limitations due to a poor pharmacokinetic profile for CNS indications and side effects, such as sedation and development of tolerance (Kumar, K. et al. Pharmacology, Biochemistry and Behavior, 110 (2013) 174). In order to avoid sedation due to agonism, it is desirable that the positive allosteric modulator of the GABAB receptor has weak intrinsic activity and efficacy as agonist. However, several of the positive allosteric modulators of the GABAB receptor known in the art are associated with agonism. A positive allosteric modulator offers the possibility of a more physiological way of modulating the receptor only in the presence of the endogenous agonist. A pure positive allosteric modulator without agonism exerts it effect by increasing the efficacy and/or potency of the endogenous agonist and being inactive in the absence of the endogenous neurotransmitter(s). Compared to traditional orthosteric agonists, allosteric modulation offers several advantages, such as spatial and temporal physiological activation of the targeted neurotransmitter system and corresponding receptor, and hence a safer profile with potential for less side-effects. The development of tachyphylaxis and tolerance can be avoided by an allosteric mode of action (De Amici, M. et al. Medicinal Research Reviews, 30 (2010) 463; Kenakin, T. Combinatorial Chemistry & High Throughput Screening, 11 (2008) 337). Some compounds with a positive allosteric GABAB modulator effect are known in the art.

As already mentioned hereinbefore, the compounds of formula I show interesting pharmacological properties, namely they exhibit an enhanced positive allosteric GABAB modulator effect and possess decreased agonism. Said properties are demonstrated with the pharmacological test presented below. Determination of agonism and positive allosteric modulator pharmacology in vitro CHO cells expressing the human GABABi and GABAB2 receptor subunits co-expressing promiscuous Galphal6 proteins to force couple the receptor to the intracellular calcium signalling pathway were used to study GABAB pharmacology in vitro. The cells were maintained at 37 °C in a 5 % C02 95 % air atmosphere in HAM F-12 medium supplemented with 10 % foetal bovine serum and selection antibiotics. The day before the experiment the cells were detached and plated into black-walled clear bottom 384-well plates at a cell density of 20000 cells per well. The growth medium was removed and the cells were incubated with FLIPR Calcium 5 Assay reagent (Molecular Devices, CA, USA) diluted 1: 1 in Probenecid-Ringer for 1 h at 37 °C in dark. Probenecid- Ringer buffer consisted of 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM C1, 1.2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM CaCl2, 5 mM glucose, 20 mM 2-(4-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazin-l-yl)ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES), and 2.5 mM Probenecid (pH 7.4 adjusted with 1.0 M NaOH and osmolarity adjusted to 322 Osm). Compounds were dissolved in Probenecid-Ringer. Changes in intracellular calcium were monitored using FLIPRtetra (Molecular Devices, CA, USA) and displayed using Screen Works software. The samples were excited at 470-495 nm and emission was detected at 515-575 nm. All experiments were performed at 37 °C. A two-addition protocol was used to determine agonism and positive allosteric modulator pharmacology in the same assay using a kinetic read out. Agonism pharmacology of compounds was studied in the first addition in the concentration range 0.123-30 μΜ in quadruplicate at each concentration. In the second addition, a low (EC 10.5) concentration of GABA was applied to detect the positive allosteric modulator pharmacology of the compounds to be studied. The EQ0.5 concentration was determined from the GABA EC50 value using the formula ECF = (F/(100-F))1/H · EC50, wherein F is the fraction of full response and H is Hill slope. Baseline fluorescence minimum was subtracted from maximum for the calculation of agonism and positive allosteric modulator pharmacology. Both in the agonism mode and in the allosteric mode, the efficacy was related to the intrinsic activity (IA) of the endogenous agonist GABA at 30 μΜ (positive allosteric modulator efficacy at 10 μΜ GABA efficacy or agonism efficacy at 30 μΜ GABA efficacy). To determine potentiation of GABA dose- response, the compounds, at a concentration of 10 μΜ diluted in Probenecid-Ringer, were added by FLIPR tetra followed by addition of GABA (diluted in water in the concentration range 0.123-10 μΜ). The EC50 values were determined using a four-parameter logistic fit (model 205 in ActivityBase XE). The EC50 value of GABA was divided with the EC50 value of GABA in the presence of positive allosteric modulator to determine potentiation of GABA dose-response EC50 value. The results of the determination of agonism and positive allosteric modulator pharmacology in vitro are shown in Table 1. The results show that the compounds of formula I exhibit an enhanced positive allosteric GABAB modulator effect and possess decreased agonism.
