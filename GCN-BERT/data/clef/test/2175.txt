Step E: 8-Ethyl-2-(trifluoromethyl)-[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyridine-6-carbaldehyde. To a solution of 8-ethyl-2-(trifluoromethyl)-6-vinyl-[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyridine (116 mg, 0.481 mmol) in 1,4-dioxane (5.6 mL) was added a suspension of NaIO4 (308 mg, 1.44 mmol) in H2O (1.2 mL). The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 2.5 h and then additional NaIO4 (1 equiv) added. After stirring overnight, sat. aq. NaHCO3 was added, and the aqueous layer extracted with EtOAc (2Ã—). The combined organics were washed with brine, dried over Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated in vacuo. Purification (FCC, SiO2, 0-50% EtOAc in hexanes) afforded the title compound as a white solid (72 mg, 61% yield).
