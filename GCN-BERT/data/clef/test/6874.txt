Agricultural machine The invention relates to an agricultural machine for wrapping of round bales according to claim 1, intended to be connected to a tractor. The wrapping of round bales for silage has improved strongly during the past years, among others because of the flexibility of the system and the small amount of manpower needed. Although the sales of so called baler-wrapper combinations with a wrapper fix connected to a round baler has increased in Finland is the method to first press the grass with a baler and after to wrap the bales in plastic film globally the by far most common way of producing bale silage. To improve the capacity the wrappers are today mostly equipped with double film pre stretchers. Anyhow a new source of disturbance occurs when the wrapper is equipped with double pre stretchers. This due to the fact, that it is practically impossible to get bout of the stretcher units to always work so accurate that bout of them will be out of film at the same time. Most frequent it happens in practice that when one film roll is empty, there is still enough film on the other to at least finish the bale already at work. As one hereby mostly prefer to change only the empty roll one have to interrupt working after the next bale and step down from the cabin to replace the other film roll. The fact that the film in bout of the stretcher units hardly at any time fill be empty at the same time is also depending of the fact that two film rolls seldom consist the same amount of film in meter. The amount of film is mostly determinate in kg and not in meter of length, which also contribute to increase the frequencies of disturbances. The patent document FI 100874 do present a partial solution to this problem. Here a wrapper with double pre stretchers is shown, where each of the pre stretcher units are equipped with a film brake sensor. When the film roll in one of the pre stretchers is empty or the film crack, the electronic control unit of the wrapper do automatically double the amount of remaining wraps around the bale with the remaining functional pre stretcher to ensure correct amount of film on the bale. This method has proved to work well in practice, and is today in use by most of the producers of baler-wrapper combinations. One disadvantage of the system is that it depends on a signal connection from the in general around the bale rotating film pre stretchers and the electronic control system of the wrapper. This signal connection has in practical solutions either been done with so called slip ring connections, or with wireless transfer. Bout solutions are rather expensive and as the sensors do work with low tensions and currents the disturbance sensitivity is frequently so big due to corrosion and dirt, that it takes away a great part of the benefit with the film control system. l To halve the above described problem with the disturbance that is created when the film will crack or when the roll will be empty, a cost effective control system according to the present invention has been developed, and the invention is characterized by what is described in the patent claims below. The invention is below described relating to the following drawings: Fig 1 shows a principal side view of a bale wrapper with two wrap arms. Fig 2 shows a principal top view of the same bale wrapper According to the Fig 1, the wrapper consist of a conventional wrapping unit 1 mounted on a frame 2. The wrapping unit is equipped with two separate pre stretch units 3 and 4 for the plastic film mounted on the wrap arms 5 and 6. These rotate around a vertical centre axis 7, by the drive unit 8 and to apply pre stretch film from the pre stretcher units 3 and 4 around the bale 10. The bale do at the same time also rotate around its horizontal centre axis 11, driven by the support roller 12, and to ensure that the film will be applied around the hole circumstance of the bale, these two rotation speeds are synchronized with each other. To ensure that the film will be pre stretched in the pre stretcher units a tension in the film 13, 14 bigger than the yield point of the material is required. This normally results in a pulling force of approx. 150 - 200 N for the most common 750mm wide commercially available stretch films on the market. The torque or the power needed from the drive unit 8 to rotate the wrapping arms around the vertical centre axis 7 is registered by a sensor 9. The information from the sensor 9 is registered and processed by a not shown electronic control unit 15. Normally the wrapping arms are driven by a hydraulic motor, and therefore the pressure drop over the hydraulic motor can be used to register the torque to rotate the arms, in any position needed. As the bale in a top view show a rectangular cross-section, it is possible as clearly to be seen from the Fig. 2 that the perpendicular distance from the stretched film 13, 14 to the vertical centre axis 7 change during the wrapping process. Therefore also the torque needed to rotate the arms 5, 6 will have a regular variation. The information registered by the sensor 9 will thus show big variations. This information is further send to the not shown electronic control unit 15 that while wrapping continuously register these measured values and their variations. From this information the control unit can then calculate if the film has cracked or if the film roll in one or more of the pre stretchers has run empty. This can be done for example so, that a torque diagram (or power diagram) is produced and continuously stored, preferably as a function of the rotation angel of the wrap arms. As long as all pre stretchers work as normal, these diagrams will follow a somehow regular aunt. If the film in one pre stretcher run empty or crack, the torque (or the power) needed to rotate the arms 5, 6 around the bale will suddenly decrease. When the control unit by missing film detect a bigger difference as normal between the from the sensor 9 measured value compared to the stored reference values, the control unit alarm film brake. From the size of the difference it is also possible to decide how many pre stretchers have film disturbances. It can be a advantageous to us analysis of variance and probability to improve the determining accuracy for the film disturbance, in particular if the available sensor 9 do not measure only the torque fo the wrapping arms, but do also register for example the total pressure for several or all of the hydraulic functions of the wrapper. In an advantageous manner this can for example happen as follow: First a median value for the pressure during a short period of time will be created. After an estimated value A for what the pressure should be at different numbers of film simultaneous applied. By calculating this value it can be advantageous to also take the wrap arm speed and the actual bale size in account. After that the absolute amounts of the estimated value minus the measured median value (for the pressure) and the so created variable B describes the deviation from the estimated value. This variable B will be calculated for all numbers of pre stretchers possible. (On a wrapper equipped with two pre stretchers: 0, 1 and 2). Many times the variable B can be used directly to determinate the probable number of film, but this variable is sensitive for pressure disturbances. To improve the determination accuracy and to ignore situations where the pressure temporary deviate for example by use of other hydraulic functions it is advantageous to calculate the standard deviation of the pressure during the same period of time for which the median value was calculated. After that the invers value of the previously calculated deviation divided by the standard deviation to get the final reliability factor for each numbers of films. The biggest of these reliability factors is then compared to a limit value. Is the value above the limit value it can be estimated that the real number of films is in accordance with the biggest reliability factor. Is the biggest reliability factor below the limit value, the number of film layers cannot be determinate for example due to other pressure disturbances than from the wrapping arms. After a on one of the above manners registered missing of film in one pre stretcher preferably what is described in FI 100574 can occur. It is a benefit if the machine is equipped with separate speed control for the rotation of the bale and for the rotation of the wrapping arms. Then it is possible to develop the control program to reduce the rotation speed of the bale around its horizontal centre axis if one film is at its end or crack. In this manner it will be possible to maintain the overlap between the film layers on the bale constant in spite of disturbance in one pre stretcher. When disturbance occur in all of the pre stretchers the wrapping will be stopped. The main advantage of the system is that it greatly increase the capacity of the wrapping of bales as the number of disturbing cases by which the driver has to stop the work and leave the tractor cabin is roughly cut by the half. Another benefit is that the film detection system can be arranged without need of additional components to be added on the wrapper. The sensor 9 can be a pressure sensor in the hydraulic system also used to control other functions of the wrapper. The invention is not limited to the above described version but a number of variations of it is possible within the scope of the following patent claims. So can for example the sensor to register the torque (or the pressure) not be positioned close to the drive unit, but can be mounted wherever in the power supply line. It can for example be a pressure sensor in or close to the control valve of the wrapper. 1.
