Compound 131B (9 g, 41 mmol) was dissolved in anhydrous dichloromethane (100 ml) and boron tribromide (14 mL, 82 mmol) was added dropwise at 0 °C. After completion of the dropwise addition, the reaction solution was stirred at 10-15 °C overnight. After completion of the reaction, the reaction solution was quenched with ice water, adjusted till the pH value was neutral with 15% sodium hydroxide solution, and extracted with ethyl acetate (100 ml x 4). The organic phase was combined, washed with saturated NaCl soltution, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and filtered, and the filtrate was concentrated to give a yellow solid compound 131C (5.3 g, 63%).
