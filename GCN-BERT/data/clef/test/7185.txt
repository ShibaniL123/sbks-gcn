TECHNICAL FIELD [0004] The present disclosure relates to carrier nanoparticles and in particular to nanoparticles targeted to bind the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) for delivering compounds of interest, such as EGFR-specific interfering RNA, and related compositions, methods and systems. BACKGROUND [0005] Effective delivery of compounds of interest to cells, tissues, organs, and organisms has been a challenge in biomedicine, imaging and other fields where delivery of molecules of various sizes and dimensions to a predetermined target is desirable. [0006] Whether for pathological examination, therapeutic treatment or for fundamental biology studies, several methods are known and used for delivering various classes of biomaterials and biomolecules which are typically associated with a biological and/or chemical activity of interest. [0007] As the number of molecules suitable to be used as chemical or biological agents (e.g. drugs, biologies, therapeutic or imaging agents) increases, development of a delivery systems suitable to be used with compounds of various complexity, dimensions and chemical nature has proven to be particularly challenging. [0008] Nanoparticles are structures useful as carriers for delivering agents with various methods of delivery. Several nanoparticle delivery systems exist, which utilize an array of different strategies to package, transport, and deliver an agent to specific targets. SUMMARY [0009] Provided herein are nanoparticles and related compositions, methods and systems that in several embodiments provide a multifunctional tool for effective and specific delivery of a compound of interest. In particular, in several embodiments, nanoparticles herein described can be used as a flexible system for carrying and delivering a wide range of molecules of various sizes, dimensions and chemical nature to predetermined targets. [0010] According to one aspect, a nanoparticle comprising a polymer containing a polyol and to a polymer containing a boronic acid is described. In the nanoparticle, the polymer containing a boronic acid is coupled to the polymer containing a polyol and the nanoparticle is configured to present the polymer containing a boronic acid to an environment external to the nanoparticle. One or more compounds of interest can be carried by the nanoparticle, as a part of or attached to the polymer containing a polyol and/or the polymer containing a boronic acid. [0011] According to another aspect, a composition is described. The composition comprises a nanoparticle herein described and a suitable vehicle and/or excipient. [0012] According to another aspect, a method to deliver a compound to a target is described. The method comprises contacting the target with a nanoparticle herein described wherein the compound is comprised in the polymer containing a polyol or in the polymer containing a boronic acid of the nanoparticle herein described. [0013] According to another aspect, a system to deliver a compound to a target is described. The system comprises at least a polymer containing a polyol and polymer containing a boronic acid capable of reciprocal binding through a reversible ester linkage, to be assembled in a nanoparticle herein described comprising the compound. [0014] According to another aspect, a method to administer a compound to an individual is described. The method comprises administering to the individual an effective amount of a nanoparticle herein described, wherein the compound is comprised in the polymer containing a polyol and/or in the polymer containing a boronic acid. [0015] According to another aspect, a system for administering a compound to an individual is described. The system comprises, at least a polymer containing a polyol and polymer containing a boronic acid capable of reciprocal binding through a reversible ester linkage, to be assembled in a nanoparticle herein described attaching the compound to be administered to the individual according to methods herein described. In some embodiments the system further comprises targeting ligand specific for EGFR and a therapeutic agent, such as an siRNA specific for EGFR. [0016] According to another aspect, a method to prepare a nanoparticle comprising a polymer containing a polyol and a polymer containing a boronic acid is described. The method comprises contacting the polymer containing polyols with the polymer containing a boronic acid for a time and under condition to allow coupling of the polymer containing polyoly with the polymer containing a boronic acid. [0017] According to another aspect, several polymer containing a boronic acid are described which are illustrated in details in the following sections of the present disclosure. [0018] According to another aspect, several polymers containing polyols are described, which are illustrated in details in the following sections of the present disclosure. [0019] Also described herein are nanoparticles having a polymer containing a polyol that are conjugated to polymers having a nitrophenylboronic acid group, which enhances the stability of the nanoparticle by reducing its pKa. [0020] Another aspect of the present disclosure provides a description of targeted nanoparticles that, in some embodiments, can have only one single targeting ligand, which is capable of promoting delivery of the nanoparticle to a particular target, such as a cell expressing a binding partner for the targeting ligand of the particle. Targeted nanoparticles of this sort have advantages over nanoparticles with a plurality of targeting ligands, such as having a smaller overall size, due to having fewer surface ligands, and have fewer ligands to mediate nonspecific binding through avidity-based interactions, rather than affinity-based interactions. Additionally, nanoparticles that contain or carry a therapeutic agent can be successfully targeted to location of interest (such as a cell or tissue) using only a single targeting ligand, thereby delivering the therapeutic agent to the target at a very high targeting ligand-to-therapeutic ratio. This aspect of the described nanoparticles can significantly increase the efficiency of making such therapeutics while also reducing the need to employ a high number of costly antibodies to mediate targeting. [0021] Nanoparticles herein described and related compositions, methods, and systems can be used in several embodiments as a flexible molecular structure suitable for carrying compounds of various sizes, dimensions and chemical nature. [0022] Nanoparticles herein described and related compositions, methods, and systems can be used in several embodiments as delivery systems which can provide protection of the carried compound from degradation, recognition by immune system and loss due to combination with serum proteins or blood cells. [0023] Nanoparticles herein described and related compositions, methods, and systems can be used in several embodiments as delivery systems characterized by steric stabilization and/or ability to deliver the compound to specific targets such as tissues, specific cell types within a tissue and even specific intracellular locations within certain cell types. [0024] Nanoparticles herein described and related compositions, methods, and systems can be designed in several embodiments, to release a carried compound in a controllable way, including controlled release of multiple compounds within a same nanoparticle at different rates and/or times. [0025] Nanoparticles herein described and related compositions, methods, and systems can be used in several embodiments, to deliver compounds with enhanced specificity and/or selectivity during targeting and/or enhanced recognition of the compound by the target compared to certain systems of the art.

[0037] The term "nanoparticle" as used herein indicates a composite structure of nanoscale dimensions. In particular, nanoparticles are typically particles of a size in the range of from about 1 to about 1000 nm, and are usually spherical although different morphologies are possible depending on the nanoparticle composition. The portion of the nanoparticle contacting an environment external to the nanoparticle is generally identified as the surface of the nanoparticle. In nanoparticles herein described, the size limitation can be restricted to two dimensions and so that nanoparticles herein described include composite structure having a diameter from about 1 to about 1000 nm, where the specific diameter depends on the nanoparticle composition and on the intended use of the nanoparticle according to the experimental design. For example, nanoparticles to be used in several therapeutic applications typically have a size of about 200 nm or below, and the ones used, in particular, for delivery associated to cancer treatment typically have a diameter from about 1 to about 100 nm. The term "targeted nanoparticle" denotes a nanoparticle that is conjugated to a targeting agent or ligand. [0038] Additional desirable properties of the nanoparticle, such as surface charges and steric stabilization, can also vary in view of the specific application of interest. Some of the exemplary properties that can be desirable in clinical applications such as cancer treatment have been described in the scientific literature. Additional properties are identifiable by a skilled person upon reading of the present disclosure. Nanoparticle dimensions and properties can be detected by techniques known in the art. Exemplary techniques to detect particles dimensions include but are not limited to dynamic light scattering (DLS) and a variety of microscopies such at transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM).

[0039] Nanoparticles and related compositions, methods, and systems herein described can be used to deliver a compound of interest and in particular an agent to a predetermined target. [0040] The term "deliver" and "delivery" as used herein indicates the activity of affecting the spatial location of a compound, and in particular controlling said location. Accordingly, delivering a compound in the sense of the present disclosure indicates the ability to affect positioning and movement of the compound at a certain time under a certain set of conditions, so that the compound's positioning and movement under those conditions are altered with respect to the positioning and movement that the compound would otherwise have. [0041] In particular, delivery of a compound with respect to a reference endpoint indicates the ability to control positioning and movement of the compound so that the compound is eventually positioned on the selected reference endpoint. In an in vitro system, delivery of a compound is usually associated to a corresponding modification of the chemical and/or biological detectable properties and activities of the compound. In an in vivo system, delivery of a compound is also typically associated with modification of the pharmacokinetics and possibly pharmacodynamics of the compound. [0042] Pharmacokinetic of a compound indicates absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of the compound from the system, typically provided by the body of an individual. In particular the term "absorption" indicates the process of a substance entering the body, the term "distribution" indicates the dispersion or dissemination of substances throughout the fluids and tissues of the body, the term "metabolism" indicates the irreversible transformation of parent compounds into daughter metabolites and the term "excretion" indicates the elimination of the substances from the body. If the compound is in a formulation, pharmacokinetics also comprises liberation of the compound from the formulation which indicates process of release of the compound, typically a drug, from the formulation. The term "pharmacodynamic" indicates physiological effects of a compound on the body or on microorganisms or parasites within or on the body and the mechanisms of drug action and the relationship between drug concentration and effect. A skilled person will be able to identify the techniques and procedures suitable to detect pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic features and properties of a compound of interest and in particular of an agent of interest such as a drug. [0043] The term "agent" as used herein indicates a compound capable of exhibiting a chemical or biological activity associated to the target. The term "chemical activity" as used herein indicates the ability of the molecule to perform a chemical reaction. The term biological activity as used herein indicates the ability of the molecule to affect a living matter. Exemplary chemical activities of agents comprise formation of a covalent or electrostatic interaction.

[0044] The term "target" as used herein indicates a biological system of interest including unicellular or pluricellular living organisms or any portion thereof and include in vitro or in vivo biological systems or any portion thereof. [0045] The nanoparticles herein describe a polymer containing a boronic acid that is coupled to a polymer containing a polyol through a boronic ester linkage and is arranged in the nanoparticle to be presented to an environment external to the nanoparticle. [0046] The term a "polymer" as used herein indicates a large molecule composed of repeating structural units typically connected by covalent chemical bonds. A suitable polymer may be a linear and/or branched, and can take the form of a homopolymer or a co-polymer. If a co-polymer is used, the co-polymer may be a random copolymer or a branched co-polymer. Exemplary polymers comprise water-dispersible and in particular water soluble polymers. For example, suitable polymers include, but are not limited to polysaccharides, polyesters, polyamides, polyethers, polycarbonates, polyacrylates, etc. For therapeutic and/or pharmaceutical uses and applications, the polymer should have a low toxicity profile and in particular that are not toxic or cytotoxic. Suitable polymers include polymers having a molecular weight of about 500,000 or below. In particular, suitable polymers can have a molecular weight of about 100,000 and below. [0047] The term "polymer containing a polyol" or "polyol(s) polymer" as used herein indicates a polymer presenting multiple hydroxyl functional groups. In particular, the polymer containing a polyol suitable to form the nanoparticles here described comprise polymers presenting at least a portion of the hydroxyl functional groups for a coupling interaction with at least one boronic acid of a polymer containing a boronic acid. [0048] The term "present" as used herein with reference to a compound or functional group indicates attachment performed to maintain the chemical reactivity of the compound or functional group as attached. Accordingly, a functional group presented on a surface, is able to perform under the appropriate conditions the one or more chemical reactions that chemically characterize the functional group. [0049] Structural units forming polymers containing polyols comprise monomeric polyols such as pentaerythritol, ethylene glycol and glycerin. Exemplary polymers containing polyols comprise polyesters, polyethers and polysaccharides. Exemplary suitable polyethers include but are not limited to diols and in particular diols with the general formula HO- (CH2CH20)p-H with p> 1, such as polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol, and poly(tetramethylene ether) glycol. Exemplary, suitable polysaccharides include but are not limited to cyclodextrins, starch, glycogen, cellulose, chitin and β-Glucans. Exemplary, suitable polyesters include but are not limited to polycarbonate, polybutyrate and polyethylene terephthalate, all terminated with hydroxyl end groups. Exemplary polymers containing polyols comprise polymers of about 500,000 or less molecular weight and in particular from about 300 to about 100,000. [0050] Several polymers containing polyols are commercially available and/or can be produced using techniques and procedures identifiable by a skilled person. Additional procedures for making polymer containing polyols will be identifiable by a skilled person in view of the present disclosure. [0051] The term "polymer containing a boronic acid" or "BA polymer" as used herein indicates polymer containing at least one boronic acid group presented for binding to a hydroxyl group of a polymer containing polyols. In particular, polymers containing boronic acids of the nanoparticles herein described include a polymer comprising in at least one structural unit an alkyl or aryl substituted boronic acid containing a carbon to boron chemical bond. Suitable BA polymers comprise polymers wherein boronic acid is in a terminal structural unit or in any other suitable position to provide the resulting polymer with hydrophilic properties. Exemplary polymers containing polyols comprise polymers of about 40,000 or less molecular weight and in particular of about 20,000 or less, or about 10,000 or less. [0052] Several polymer containing a boronic acids are commercially available and/or can be produced using techniques and procedures identifiable by a skilled person. Additional procedures for making BA polymers will be identifiable by a skilled person in view of the present disclosure. [0053] In the nanoparticles herein described polyols polymers are coupled to the BA polymers. The term "coupled" or "coupling" as used herein with reference to attachment between two molecules indicates an interaction forming a reversible covalent linkage. In particular, in presence of a suitable medium, a boronic acid presented on the BA polymer interact with hydroxyl groups of the polyols via a rapid and reversible pair-wise covalent interaction to form boronic esters in a suitable medium. Suitable medium include water and several aqueous solutions and additional organic media identifiable by a skilled person. In particular, when contacted in an aqueous medium BA polymers and polyols polymers react, producing water as a side product. The boronic acid polyol interaction is generally more favorable in aqueous solutions but is also known to proceed in organic media. In addition, cyclic esters formed with 1,2 and 1,3 diols are generally more stable than their acyclic ester counterparts. [0054] Accordingly, in a nanoparticle herein described, at least one boronic acid of the polymer containing a boronic acid is bound to hydroxyl groups of the polymer containing a polyol with a reversible covalent linkage. Formation of a boronic ester between BA polymers and polyols polymers can be detected by methods and techniques identifiable by a skilled person such as boron- 11 nuclear magnetic resonance (UB NMR), potentiomeric titration, UV/Vis and fluorescent detection techniques whereby the technique of choice is dependent on the specific chemical nature and properties of the boronic acid and polyol composing the nanoparticle. [0055] A nanoparticle resulting from coupling interactions of a BA polymer herein described with a polyol polymer herein described presents the BA polymer on the surface of the particle. In several embodiments the nanoparticles can have a diameter from about 1 to about 1000 nm and a spherical morphology although the dimensions and morphology of the particle are largely determined by the specific BA polymer and polyol polymers used to form the nanoparticles and by the compounds that are carried on the nanoparticles according to the present disclosure. [0056] In several embodiments the compound of interest carried by the nanoparticle forms part of the BA polymer and/or the polyol polymers. Examples of such embodiments are provided by nanoparticles wherein one or more atoms of a polymer is replaced by a specific isotope e.g., 19F and 10B, and are therefore suitable as agent for imaging the target and/or providing radiation treatment to the target. [0057] In several embodiments, the compound of interest carried the nanoparticle is attached to a polymer, typically a polyol polymer, through covalent or non-covalent linkage. Examples of such embodiments are provided by nanoparticles wherein one or more moieties in at least one of the polyol polymer and BA polymer attaches one or more compounds of interest. [0058] The term "attach", "attached" or "attachment" as used herein, refers to connecting or uniting by a bond, link, force or tie in order to keep two or more components together, which encompasses either direct or indirect attachment such that for example where a first compound is directly bound to a second compound, and the embodiments wherein one or more intermediate compounds, and in particular molecules, are disposed between the first compound and the second compound. [0059] In particular, in some embodiments a compound can be attached to the polyol polymer or BA polymer through covalent linkage of the compound to suitable moieties of the polymer. Exemplary covalent linkages include, attachment of the drug Camptothecin to Mucic Acid polymer through biodegradable ester bond linkage. [0060] In some embodiments, the polymer can be designed or modified to enable the attachment of a specific compound of interest, for example by adding one or more functional groups able to specifically bind a corresponding functional group on the compound of interest. For example, in several embodiments it is possible to PEGylate the nanoparticle with a BA-PEG- X, where X can be a Maleimide or an iodoacetyl group or any leaving group that will react specifically with a thiol or non-specifically with an amine. The compound to be attached can then react to the maleimide or iodoacetyl groups after modification to express a thiol functional group. The compound to be attached can also be modified with aldehydes or ketone groups and these can react via a condensation reaction with the diols on the polyols to give acetals or ketals. [0061] In some embodiments, a compound of interest can be attached to the polyol polymer or BA polymer through noncovalent bonds such as ionic bonds and intermolecular interactions, between a compound to be attached and a suitable moiety of the polymer. [0062] A compound of interest can be attached to the nanoparticle before, upon or after formation of the nanoparticle, for example via modification of a polymer and/or of any attached compound in the particulate composite. Additional procedures to attach a compound to a BA polymer polyol polymer or other components of the nanoparticle herein described (e.g. a previously introduced compound of interest) can be identified by a skilled person upon reading of the present disclosure. [0063] In some embodiments, at least one compound of interest attached to a BA polymer presented on the nanoparticle herein described is an agent that can be used as a targeting ligand. In particular, in several embodiments, the nanoparticle attaches on the BA polymer one or more agents to be used as a targeting ligand, and on the polyol polymer and/or the BA polymer, one or more agents to be delivered to a target of choice. In some embodiments the targeting ligand is an antibody or protein that preferentially binds to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). In one embodiment the antibody or protein that preferentially binds the EGFR is the antibody cetuximab. Alternatively, the antibody or protein that preferentially binds the EGFR can be a ligand for the receptor, such as EGF or an EGF peptide. [0064] The term "targeting ligand" or "targeting agent" as used in the present disclosure indicates any molecule that can be presented on the surface of a nanoparticle for the purpose of engaging a specific target, and in particular specific cellular recognition, for example by enabling cell receptor attachment of the nanoparticle. Examples of suitable ligands include, but are not limited to, vitamins (e.g. folic acid), proteins (e.g. transferrin, and monoclonal antibodies), monosaccharides (e.g. galactose), peptides, and polysaccharides. In particular targeting ligands can be antibodies against certain surface cell receptors such as anti-EGFR. [0065] The choice of ligand, as one of ordinary skill appreciates, may vary depending upon the type of delivery desired. As another example, the ligand may be membrane permeabilizing or membrane permeable agent such as the TAT protein from HIV-1. The TAT protein is a viral transcriptional activation that is actively imported into the cell nucleus. Torchilin, V. P. et al, PNAS. 98, 8786 8791, (2001). Suitable targeting ligands attached to a BA polymer typically comprise a flexible spacer such as a poly(ethylene oxide) with a boronic acid attached to its distal end. [0066] In several embodiments, at least one of the compounds comprised or attached to the polyol polymer and/or BA polymer (including a targeting ligand) can be an agent and in particular a drug, to be delivered to a target, for example an individual, to which the chemical or biological activity, e.g. the therapeutic activity, is to be exerted. [0067] Selection of a polyol polymer and a BA polymer suitable to form a nanoparticle herein described can be performed in view of the compound and the target of interest. In particular, selection of a suitable polymer containing a polyol and a suitable BA polymer to form a nanoparticle herein described can be performed by providing candidate polyol polymers and BA polymer, and selecting the polyol polymer and the BA polymer able to form a coupling interaction in the sense of the disclosure, wherein the selected BA polymer and polyol polymer have a chemical composition such that in view of the compound of interest and targeting ligand to comprised or attached to the polyol polymers and/or the BA polymers, the polyol polymers is less hydrophilic than the BA polymer. Detection of the BA polymer on the surface of the nanoparticle and related presentation on the environment external to the nanoparticle can be performed by detection of the zeta potential which can demonstrate modification of the surface of the nanoparticle. [0068] In several embodiments, polymers containing polyols comprise one or more of at least one of the followin structural units (I) (II) (III) wherein A is an organic moiety of formula (IV) in which Ri and R2 are independently selected from any carbon based or organic group with a molecular weight of about lOkDa or less; X is independently selected from an aliphatic group, containing one or more of -H, -F, - C, -N or -O ; and Y is independently selected from -OH or an organic moiety bearing a hydroxyl (-OH) group including but not limited to -CH2OH, -CH2CH2OH, -CF2OH, - CF2CF2OH, and C(RiGi)(RG2)(RiG3)OH, with R1G1, RiG2 and R1G3 are independently organic based functionalities, and B is an organic moiety linking one of Ri and R2 of a first A moiety with one of the Ri and R2 of a second A moiety. [0069] The term "moiety" as used herein indicates a group of atoms that constitute a portion of a larger molecule or molecular species. In particular, a moiety refers to a constituent of a repeated polymer structural unit. Exemplary moieties include acid or base species, sugars, carbohydrates, alkyl groups, aryl groups and any other molecular constituent useful in forming a polymer structural unit.

[0077] In several embodiments, in polymers containing a polyol of the particle herein described one ore more structural units (A) can independently have the formula IX X and XI [0078] In several embodiments, (B) can be formed by any straight, branched, symmetric or asymmetric compound linking the two (A) moieties through functional groups. [0079] In several embodiments, (B) can be formed by a compound where at least two cross-linkable groups linking the two (A) moieties. [0080] In some embodiments, (B) contains a neutral, cationic or anionic organic group whose nature and composition is dependent on the chemical nature of the compound to be covalently or non-covalently tethered [0081] Exemplary cationic moieties of (B) for use with anionic cargo include, but are not limited to, organic groups bearing amidines groups, quartenary ammoniums, primary amine group, secondary amine group, tertiary amine groups (protonated below their pKa's), and immidazoliums [0082] Exemplary anionic moieties contained in (B) for use with cationic cargo include, but are not limited to, organic groups bearing sulfonates of formula, nitrates of formula, carboxylates of formula, and phosphonates [0083] In particular one or more cationic or anionic moieties (B) for use with anionic cargo and cationic cargos respectively can independently have a general formula of: R5— Organic group— R5 (XII) wherein R5 is an electrophilic group that can be covalently linked to A when A contains nucleophilic groups.

In some embodiments the targeting ligand is an antibody or protein that preferentially binds to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). In one embodiment the antibody or protein that preferentially binds the EGFR is the antibody cetuximab. Alternatively, the antibody or protein that preferentially binds the EGFR can be a ligand for the receptor, such as EGF or an EGF peptide.

Additional functional groups can be identified by a skilled person upon reading of the present disclosure. As used herein, the term "corresponding functional group" refers to a functional group that can react to another functional group. Thus, functional groups that can react with each other can be referred to as corresponding functional groups. [0102] An end-group indicates a constitutional unit that is an extremity of a macromolecule or oligomer molecule. For example the end-group of a PET polyester may be an alcohol group or a carboxylic acid group. End groups can be used to determine molar Exemplary end groups comprise -OH. -COOH, NH2, and OCH3, [0103] In some embodiments, the polymer containing boronic acid can have formula (XXXI) wherein s is from 20 to 300.

In particular, nucleic acid aptamers can comprise, for example, nucleic acid species that have been engineered through repeated rounds of in vitro selection or equivalently, SELEX (systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment) to bind to various molecular targets such as small molecules, proteins, nucleic acids, and even cells, tissues and organisms. Aptamers are useful in biotechno logical and therapeutic applications as they offer molecular recognition properties that rival that of the antibodies. Peptide aptamers are peptides that are designed to specifically bind to and interfere with protein-protein interactions inside cells. In particular, peptide aptamers can be derived, for example, according to a selection strategy that is derived from the yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) system. In particular, according to this strategy, a variable peptide aptamer loop attached to a transcription factor binding domain is screened against the target protein attached to a transcription factor activating domain. In vivo binding of the peptide aptamer to its target via this selection strategy is detected as expression of a downstream yeast marker gene.

In particular, non-natural amino acids include D- stereoisomers of naturally occurring amino acids (these including useful ligand building blocks because they are not susceptible to enzymatic degradation). The term "artificial amino acids" indicate molecules that can be readily coupled together using standard amino acid coupling chemistry, but with molecular structures that do not resemble the naturally occurring amino acids. The term "amino acid analog" refers to an amino acid in which one or more individual atoms have been replaced, either with a different atom, isotope, or with a different functional group but is otherwise identical to original amino acid from which the analog is derived. All of these amino acids can be synthetically incorporated into a peptide or polypeptide using standard amino acid coupling chemistries. The term "polypeptide" as used herein includes polymers comprising one or more monomer, or building blocks other than an amino acid monomer. The terms monomer, subunit, or building blocks indicate chemical compounds that under appropriate conditions can become chemically bonded to another monomer of the same or different chemical nature to form a polymer. The term "polypeptide" is further intended to comprise a polymer wherein one or more of the building blocks is covalently bound to another by a chemical bond other than amide or peptide bond. [0108] The term "protein" as used herein indicates a polypeptide with a particular secondary and tertiary structure that can participate in, but not limited to, interactions with other biomolecules including other proteins, DNA, RNA, lipids, metabolites, hormones, chemokines, and small molecules.

[0110] In several embodiments, polyol polymers form a non-covalent complex or linkage with one or more compounds of interest to be delivered according to the schematic illustration of Figures 1 and 2. [0111] In several embodiments, a nanoparticle structure comprises an agent and a polymer containing a polyol, where the agent is linked to a polyol polymer by a covalent bond. In these embodiments, polyol polymers conjugated to an agent (herein referred to as "polyol polymer-agent conjugate") form nanoparticles whose structure presents sites on their surface for interaction with BA molecules. [0112] In several of those embodiments, the nanoparticle further comprises BA polymers configured to provide steric stabilization and/or targeting functionality to the nanoparticle. In particular, in those embodiments the addition of a BA polymer allows minimizing of self- aggregation and undesired interactions with other nanoparticles, thus providing enhanced salt and serum stability. [0113] In such embodiments, the structure of this nanoparticle affords several advantages over agents delivery methods of the prior art, such as the ability to provide controlled release of one or more agents. This feature can be provided, for example, by the use of a biodegradable ester linkage between the agent and the polyol polymer. A person skilled in the art will recognize other potential linkages suitable for this purpose. In these embodiments, another advantage is the ability to provide specific targeting of the agent through the BA polymer moiety. [0114] In several embodiments, a nanoparticle structure comprises an agent and a polyol polymer, where the nanoparticle is a modified liposome. In these embodiments, the modified liposome comprises lipids conjugated to polyol polymers via a covalent linkage such that the surface of the liposome presents polyol polymers. In these embodiments, the modified liposomes form such that the agents to be delivered are contained within the liposome nanoparticle. [0115] The term "liposome" as used herein indicates a vesicular structure comprised of lipids. The lipids typically have a tail group comprising a long hydrocarbon chain and a hydrophilic head group. The lipids are arranged to form a lipid bilayer with an inner aqueous environment suitable to contain an agent to be delivered. Such liposomes present an outer surface that may comprise suitable targeting ligands or molecules for specific recognition by cell surface receptors or other targets of interest. [0116] The term "conjugated" as used herein indicates that one molecule has formed a covalent bond with a second molecule and includes linkages where atoms covalently bond with alternating single and multiple (e.g. double) bonds (e.g., C=C-C=C-C) and influence each other to produce electron derealization. [0117] In yet other embodiments of the present disclosure, a nanoparticle structure comprises an agent and a polyol, where the nanoparticle is a modified micelle. In these embodiments, the modified micelle comprises polyol polymers modified to contain a hydrophobic polymer block. [0118] The term "hydrophobic polymer block" as used in the present disclosure indicates a segment of the polymer that on its own would be hydrophobic. [0119] The term "micelle" as used herein refers to an aggregate of molecules dispersed in a liquid. A typical micelle in aqueous solution forms an aggregate with the hydrophilic "head" regions in contact with surrounding solvent, sequestering the hydrophobic single tail regions in the micelle center. In the present disclosure the head region may be, for example, a surface region of the polyol polymer while the tail region may be, for example, the hydrophobic polymer block region of the polyol polymer. [0120] In these embodiments, polyol polymers with a hydrophobic polymer block, when mixed with an agent to be delivered, arrange to form a nanoparticle that is a modified micelle with agents to be delivered contained within the nanoparticle. Such nanoparticle embodiments present polyol polymers on their surface that are suitable to interact with BA polymers that do or do not have targeting functionality according to previous embodiments. In these embodiments, BA polymers capable of use for this purpose include those with hydrophilic A and hydrophobic B in formula (I) or (II). This interaction provides the same or similar advantages as it does for other nanoparticle embodiments mentioned above. [0121] In some embodiments, nanoparticles or related components can be comprised in a composition together with an acceptable vehicle. The term "vehicle" as used herein indicates any of various media acting usually as solvents, carriers, binders, excipients or diluents for a nanoparticle comprised in the composition as an active ingredient. [0122] In some embodiments, where the composition is to be administered to an individual the composition can be a pharmaceutical composition and the acceptable vehicle can be a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle. [0123] In some embodiments, a nanoparticle can be included in pharmaceutical compositions together with an excipient or diluent. In particular, in some embodiments, pharmaceutical compositions are disclosed which contain nanoparticle, in combination with one or more compatible and pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle, and in particular with pharmaceutically acceptable diluents or excipients. [0124] The term "excipient" as used herein indicates an inactive substance used as a carrier for the active ingredients of a medication.

In addition to their use in the single-dosage quantity, excipients can be used in the manufacturing process to aid in the handling of nanoparticles. Depending on the route of administration, and form of medication, different excipients may be used. Exemplary excipients include but are not limited to antiadherents, binders, coatings disintegrants, fillers, flavors (such as sweeteners) and colors, glidants, lubricants, preservatives, sorbents. [0125] The term "diluent" as used herein indicates a diluting agent which is issued to dilute or carry an active ingredient of a composition. Suitable diluents include any substance that can decrease the viscosity of a medicinal preparation. [0126] In certain embodiments, compositions and, in particular, pharmaceutical compositions can be formulated for systemic administration, which includes parenteral administration and more particularly intravenous, intradermic, and intramuscular administration. [0127] Exemplary compositions for parenteral administration include but are not limited to sterile aqueous solutions, injectable solutions or suspensions including nanoparticles. In some embodiments, a composition for parenteral administration can be prepared at the time of use by dissolving a powdered composition, previously prepared in a freeze-dried lyophilized form, in a biologically compatible aqueous liquid (distilled water, physiological solution or other aqueous solution). [0128] The term "lyophilization" (also known as freeze-drying or cryodesiccation) indicates a dehydration process typically used to preserve a perishable material or make the material more convenient for transport. Freeze-drying works by freezing the material and then reducing the surrounding pressure and adding enough heat to allow the frozen water in the material to sublime directly from the solid phase to gas. [0129] In pharmaceutical applications freeze-drying is often used to increase the shelf life of products, such as vaccines and other injectables. By removing the water from the material and sealing the material in a vial, the material can be easily stored, shipped, and later reconstituted to its original form for injection. [0130] In several embodiments nanoparticles herein described are delivered to a predetermined target. In some embodiments, the target is an in vitro biological system and the method comprises contacting target with the nanoparticle herein described.

[0134] The phrases "systemic administration," "administered systemically," "peripheral administration" and "administered peripherally" as used herein mean the administration of a nanoparticle or composition thereof other than directly into the central nervous system, such that it enters the individual's system and, thus, is subject to metabolism and other like processes, for example, subcutaneous administration. [0135] Actual dosage levels of the active ingredient or agent in the pharmaceutical compositions herein described may be varied so as to obtain an amount of the active ingredient which is effective to achieve the desired therapeutic response for a particular individual, composition, and mode of administration, without being toxic to the individual. [0136] These therapeutic polymer conjugate may be administered to humans and other animals for therapy by any suitable route of administration, including orally, nasally, as by, for example, a spray, rectally, intravaginally, parenterally, intracisternally and topically, as by powders, ointments or drops, including buccally and sublingually.

Aqueous systems susceptible to microbiological attack or degradation are also found in the leather industry, the textile industry, and the coating or paint industry. Examples of such microbicides and their uses are described, individually and in combinations, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,693,631, 6,034,081, and 6,060,466, which are incorporated herein by reference. Compositions containing active agents such as those discussed above may be used in the same manner as known for the active ingredient itself. Notably, because such uses are not pharmacological uses, the polymer of the composite does not necessarily have to meet the toxicity profile required in pharmaceutical uses. [0147] In certain embodiments, nanoparticles comprising polyol polymers and BA polymers can also be comprised in a system suitable for delivering any of the compounds herein indicated and in particular agents, using a nanoparticle.

[0214] In view of the forgoing description, the following items are provided to illustrate particular embodiments of the described subject matter: EXAMPLES [0215] The methods system herein described are further illustrated in the following examples, which are provided by way of illustration and are not intended to be limiting. Example 1: Nanoparticle design [0216] Nanoparticles were designed to specifically target EGFR-positive non- small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells and deliver siRNA to hinder EGFR expression. The nanoparticles have 4 primary components (see FIG. 1): 1. A biocompatible cationic mucic acid polymer (cMAP) that encapsulates siRNA with a charge ratio (+/-) of 1; 2. 5-nitrophenyl boronic acid-mPEG (5-nPBA-mPEG), which binds to cMAP through boronic acids' interaction with diols present on cMAP, to form a coating of methoxy- polyethylene glycol (mPEG) in order to ensure particle stability in serum; 3. Cetuximab, the targeting agent for the particle, also attached to cMAP through a 5- nitrophenyl boronic acid-PEG entity; and 4. siRNA against EGFR (siEGFR), able to knock down EGFR mRNA expression to 20% at a 50 picomolar concentration (see SEQ ID NO: 1). The resulting nanoparticles are cetuximab-conjugated cMAP-siEGFR nanoparticles. Example 2: Reaction scheme for the production of cationic mucic acid polymer (cMAP) dimethyl ester N-Boc-ethylenediamine N-Boc protected mucic acid ethylenediamine Mucic acid ethylenediamine Mucic acid ethylenediamine Dimethyl suberimidate (DMS) Cationic Mucic Acid Polymer (cMAP) GPC: MWW = 6415, MWn = 5584, PDI = 1.15 NMR: MWn = 5388 Degree of Polymerization = 11 Example 3: Reaction scheme for the production of 5-nitrophenyl boronic acid-methoxy polyethylene glycol 3-carboxyl-5-nitrophenyl boronic acid -acyl chloride- 5-nitrophenyl boronic acid-mPEG Example 4: Reaction scheme for the production of cetuximab-conjugated PEG-nitrophi boronic acid -nitrophenyl boronic acid-PEG-COOH cetuximab-PEG-nitrophenyl boronic acid Example 5: Chemical and physical characterization of nanoparticles [0217] The nanoparticles described in example 1 were then characterized to assess hydrophobic diameter (FIG. 2), salt stability (FIG. 3), zeta potential (FIG. 4), and particle size (FIG. 5). The particles were formed by mixing a solution of cMAP, 5-nPBA-mPEG, and 0.13 mol% 5-nPBA-mPEG-cetuximab in 10 mM phosphate buffe, pH 7.4 with siEGFR (SEQ ID NO: l) to form cetuximab-conjugated cMAP-siEGFR nanoparticles. Example 6: Assessment of tumor targeting by cMAP-siEGFR nanoparticles [0218] To assess the ability of cMAP-siEGFR nanoparticles to target non-small cell adenocarcinoma lung cancer tumor cells in vivo, the nanoparticles were injected into nude mice bearing HI 975 (a non-small cell adenocarcinoma lung cancer tumor cell line) xenografts. Tumors were collected 24 hours after injection of the nanoparticles and were assessed for the presence of siEGFR RNA using quantitative RT-PCR. As shown in FIG. 6 tumors from mice injected with cMAP-siEGFR nanoparticles had significantly higher amounts of siEGFR RNA than control mice (treated with saline or cetuximab alone). Example 7: Assessment of anti-tumor effect of cMAP-siEGFR nanoparticles [0219] In view of the observation that cMAP-siEGFR nanoparticles targeted HI 975 tumors, studies were undertaken to assess the effect of these nanoparticles on tumor progression. Athymic nude mice bearing HI 975 xenografts were treated with cMAP-siEGFR nanoparticles, saline, or cetuximab alone and tumor progression was assessed over time. As shown in Figs. 7- 9, mice treated with cMAP-siEGFR nanoparticles had reduced tumor progression and lower mortality than control mice. [0220] These studies indicate that nanoparticles containing antibodies as targeting agents and siRNA payloads can be formulated into well-defined, stable therapeutics. The nanoparticle system descried in these examples has a pH-tunable 5-nPBA that allows for targeting and stabilizing the nanoparticle at a physiologic pH of 7.4. The targeting agent and PEG coating is able to detach from the nanoparticle at acidic pH, like those found in endosomes, enabling the siRNA payload to escape and reach its site of action within the cell. These nanoparticles produce significant tumor regression in vivo that is superior to cetuximab alone.
