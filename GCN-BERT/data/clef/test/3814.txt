COMPOSITIONS FOR LIGHTENING SKIN COLOR FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention is directed to a skin lightening additive as well as compositions comprising the same. More particularly the present invention is directed to a cosmetic composition comprising a skin lightening additive whereby the skin lightening additive comprises a heterosubstituted, saturated or unsaturated aliphatic acid, or a mixture thereof. The skin lightening additive, when used, results in a cosmetic composition that can provide moisturizing benefits. Moreover it has been unexpectedly discovered that such aliphatic acids have skin lightening benefits when topically applied. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Many consumers are concerned with the characteristics of their skin. For example consumers are concerned with the degree of pigmentation of their skin, freckles and/or age spots. Other consumers wish to reduce skin darkening caused by exposure to sunlight. To meet the needs of consumers, many attempts have been made to develop products that improve skin characteristics. The products developed thus far often tend to have low efficacy, undesirable side effects or both. Furthermore such products can be expensive and are often not an alternative for lower income consumers. There is an increasing interest to develop a cosmetic composition that comprises new skin lightening additives. This invention is directed to cosmetic compositions that comprise new skin lightening additives. The cosmetic compositions of the present invention preferably comprise, as a lightening additive, compounds like 12-hydroxystearic acid, ricinoleic acid or both. The cosmetic compositions of this invention result in a decrease in melanin content which is at least 8% lower (preferably at least about 11% lower) when comparing MelanoDerm™ cultures treated with the same to MelanoDerm cultures that have not been subjected to a composition with the newly discovered skin lightening additives of this invention. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION Efforts have been disclosed for making skin care cosmetic compositions, in US 6 875 425, skin lightening agents with 4-substituted resorcinol derivative compounds are described. Other efforts have been disclosed for making skin treatment compositions. In US 7.2.50158 and US 7 247 294, methods for treating with skin lightening agents are described. Still other efforts have been disclosed for treating skin. In US 5 998 423, compositions with polycyclic nitrogen heterocycles are described. None of the additional information above describes skin lightening compositions that comprise, as a lightening additive, a heterosubstituted, saturated or unsaturated aliphatic acid, or mixture thereof.

The examples which follow are provided to illustrate and facilitate an understanding of the invention. The examples are not intended to limit the scope of the claims. Examples Commercially available human skin equivalents (MelanoDerm™ from MatTek) were obtained for testing the impact of heterosubstituted, saturated or unsaturated aliphatic acid on melanogenesis. Solutions having a final concentration of 0.1 to 5 micromolar were prepared from a 10 millimolar dimethyl sulfoxide stock solution and dosed ten (10) times in a three (3) week period into the media of the MelanoDerm cultures. The media consisted of commercially available basal Dulbecco's Modified Eagles media prepared and treated in the manner set forth in the manufacturer's instructions. For long term maintenance of the MelanoDerms, the basal media was supplemented with basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and alpha melanocyte stimulating hormone (MSH) to stimulate melanocyte growth and melanogenesis. Each treatment condition was done in duplicate and three (3) sets were made for each treatment as well as for a control (culture not treated with the aliphatic acid). The cultures were maintained at a temperature of 37°C and incubated in a humidified, 5% C02 incubator during the dosing period, but removed while being dosed. After a three (3) week period, the MelanoDerm cultures were removed and solubilized in a centrifuge tube containing 250 microliters of Solvable reagent (GNE9100, Packard) for sixteen (16) hours (overnight) in a 60°C oven. Following solubilization, the centrifuge tube containing the sample was spun at 12,000 g for five (5) minutes. Two hundred (200) microliters of supernatant were removed and placed in a ninety-six (96) well plate. A spectrophotometer was used to measure the absorbance of the supernatant at 490 nm. A standard curve using synthetic melanin was set up in parallel to allow quantitation of melanin, in micrograms, of the samples.
