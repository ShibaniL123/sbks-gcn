BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION (1) Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a process for purifying insulin and insulin analogues comprising liquid chromatography with an acidic cation exchange medium performed under low to moderate pressure at an elevated temperature. (2) Description of Related Art Recombinant production of insulin and insulin analogs in genetically modified microbial or yeast host cells entails expression of the insulin or insulin analog in the host cell as a single-chain precursor insulin molecule comprising three polypeptide domains (A-chain, C-chain, B-chain), as in native pre-insulins, along with the addition of a fusion peptide at the N-terminus whose function is to allow the correct N-terminal sequence of the insulin to be obtained during its synthesis in the host cell. In the microbial host E. coli, the single-chain precursor insulin molecule is sequestered in inclusion bodies consisting of mostly of incorrectly folded single-chain precursor molecules. To produce recombinant insulin, the inclusion bodies are extracted from the cell, washed, and the single-chain precursor molecule is solubilized, refolded, and then purified by at least one chromatographic step. The refolded, single-chain precursor molecule is then further processed into a heterodimer insulin molecule by the concurrent removal of the C-chain and the N-terminus fusion peptide by enzymatic digestion. The insulin heterodimer comprises the A-chain and B-chain polypeptides linked together by three disulfide bridges. In subsequent purification steps including ion-exchange chromatography and reverse phase HPLC, the insulin heterodimer is purified away from digestion byproducts to yield a highly purified product. The purified product may be formulated in a zinc and m-cresol (preservative) containing buffer to provide the insulin product. Methods for isolating inclusion bodies, refolding and enzymatically digesting precursor insulin molecules to produce insulin heterodimers have been disclosed U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,663,291; 5,986,048; 6,380,355, and 5,473,049. Ion-exchange chromatography methods for purifying insulin heterodimers from digestion byproducts have been disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,101,013, which discloses cation-exchange chromatography on strongly acidic ion exchangers under atmospheric or medium pressure and elution by means of aqueous alkanol with only a relatively small amount of alkanol to purify insulin heterodimers; and, U.S. Pat. No. 5,977,297, which discloses high-pressure cation-exchange chromatography on pressure-stable acidic cation exchangers under a pressure of about 1.1 MPa (11 bar) to about 40 MPa (400 bar) to purify insulin heterodimers. Further purification of the insulin heterodimer has been described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,710,167 and 5,621,073. While there are methods available for purifying insulin heterodimers, there remains a need for alternative methods for purifying insulin heterodimers and analogues thereof. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In an effort to provide additional processes for obtaining insulin or insulin analog heterodimers from enzymatic cleavage reactions, we have found that insulin and insulin heterodimers can be purified from other byproducts of the enzymatic digestion by chromatography of the insulin or insulin analog heterodimers on temperature-stable acidic cation exchangers under a pressure of about 0.276 MPa (40 psi or 2.7 bar).

Following loading of the insulin sample from an enzymatic digest in buffer A1, the column is washed with A1 buffer (Wash 1) for 20 column volumes. Next, the column is washed with Wash 2 containing an A1/B1 mixture (about 6.5% B1) for 20 column volumes as shown. The insulin sample is eluted with an A1/B1 mixture (about 26% B1) for twenty column volumes as shown. The column is stripped using B1 buffer. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Precursor insulin or insulin analogue molecules produced in prokaryote host cells such as E. coli or lower eukaryote host cells such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae or Pichia pastoris are enzymatically cleaved in vitro to remove the connecting peptide joining the B-chain peptide to the A-chain peptide to produce insulin or insulin analogue heterodimers. The enzymatic cleavage of precursor insulin or insulin analogue molecules is using achieved by digestion with trypsin, carboxypeptidase, lysC, or combinations thereof. However, the enzymatic digests introduce impurities such as the three amino acid B-chain truncate (des-Thr), deamidoinsulin, arginine- and diarginine-insulin and insulin ethyl ester. To remove these impurities, the present invention provides a cation exchange process that can be performed in column chromatography format in which during the chromatography the column differential pressure is less than 1.1 MPa and the outlet temperature is about 42° C. or more.

Thus, the present invention may be used in a process for preparing insulin or insulin analogue for use in treating diabetes. The following examples are intended to promote a further understanding of the present invention. EXAMPLE 1 The acidic cation exchange (CEX) column is packed with BioSepra CM Ceramic HyperD F, a high-capacity hydrogel polymerized within the pores of a rigid ceramic bead available from Pall Corporation, Port Washington, N.Y.; Cat. No. 20050. The defined volume of cation exchange material is first allowed to settle. The storage solution (20% ethanol) is decanted and replaced with an equal volume of CEX Strip/Storage Solution (Table 1) and the cation exchange material is resuspended in this solution. Settling, decanting, and resuspension with an equal volume of CEX Strip/Storage Solution are repeated two more times allowing for the sufficient equilibration of the cation exchange material with 30% hexylene glycol. Next, the slurry is diluted to achieve a slurry percent of about 50% and held in the CEX Strip/Storage Solution for 24 hours. The cation exchange material slurry is transferred to the column and resuspended with a paddle. The upper head plate is inserted into the column and lowered to the solution interface. The column is flow-packed with CEX Strip/Storage Solution at a flow rate that produces a column differential pressure of about 40 psid (0.276 MPA) or more and at a temperature of about 20±2° C. Once a stable bed height is achieved, the flow rate is reduced and the upper head plate is lowered until about 2 to 3 mm above the cation exchange material interface. The head space is to prevent the cation exchange material from interfering with the sealing of the head plate. The column is returned to the packing pressure, and the bed is allowed to compress again. The procedure of slowing flow and lowering the head plate is repeated as necessary until the upper head plate is about 2 to 3 mm above the resin cation exchange material interface at the packing pressure. Next, the column is connected to the chromatography skid and flushed with CEX Cleaning Solution (Table 1) as a pre-use sanitization, during which a final compression of the bed is observed. If necessary, the head plate should be lowered again to remain 2 to 3 mm above the cation exchange material interface. Next, the column is promptly flushed with CEX Pre-Equilibration Solution (Table 1) and CEX Strip/Storage Solution.

Next, the column is flushed with the defined volume of CEX Strip/Storage Solution and the (low-to-high) transition is monitored via conductivity. Finally, the column may be stored until use. Crude recombinant insulin or insulin analogue heterodimer obtained from a trypsin digest in 50 mM acetic acid, pH 3.5 is diluted to about 0.3 to 0.4 g/L with hexylene glycol prior to loading on the column and the pH adjusted to about 4.2. The mass of hexylene glycol to crude recombinant insulin is about 0.395 kg hexylene glycol/kg crude recombinant insulin. To prepare for loading of the diluted crude recombinant insulin, the column is equilibrated with CEX Equilibration/Wash 1 Solution using a gradient initially to transition from the CEX Strip/Storage Solution to the CEX Equilibration/Wash 1 Solution to prevent extreme pH excursions across the cation exchange material in the column. The column is loaded with the diluted crude recombinant insulin or insulin analogue at about 3-6 g insulin or insulin analogue/L cation exchange material/cycle. All steps between and including column wash and column strip use CEX Equilibration/Wash 1 Solution (A1) and CEX Strip/Storage Solution (B1) (Table 1). Following loading, the column is washed with CEX Equilibration/Wash 1 Solution containing about 20 mM NaCl. The column is operated a flow rate that produces a column differential pressure of about 40 psid (0.276 MPa) or less with an outlet temperature of about 42±2° C. In general, the flow rate is about 182 to 201 cm/hour or about 1 L/minute. The column is washed as shown in FIG. 1 with an A1/B1 mixture containing about 6.5±1.0% solution B1 in solution A1 to produce a solution comprising about 37 mM NaCl for about 18-20 column volumes. The column is then eluted as shown in FIG. 1 with an A1/B1 mixture containing about 26.1±1.0% B1 in A1 to produce a solution comprising about 95 mM NaCl with about 20 column volumes. During elution, fractions are collected during the elution process to allow analysis by UV absorption prior to pooling of those fractions that contain eluted insulin or insulin analogue. In general, collection of fractions begins at the start of the elution step and ends when the UV peak is below 10% of the peak maximum value. The fractions may be analyzed by HPLC to determine purity. The fractions that correspond to the required purity are combined. In general, purity as measured by HPLC is greater than 90% with a yield of about 60-85% or more. EXAMPLE 2 A crude mixture of the acid-stable insulin analogue Gly(A21), Arg(B31), Arg(B32)-human insulin (insulin glargine) is purified as in Example 1. Because of non-specific enzymatic cleavages during the trypsin digest, very small amounts of product-related impurities, e.g. the three amino acid B-chain truncate (des-Thr) are produced. These product impurities, which are present in the crude mixture, are reduced using the method in Example 1. In general, the yield of the process has been about 65-85% with a purity of greater than 94% as determined by HPLC analysis.
