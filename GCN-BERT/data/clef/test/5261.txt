CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14/102,837, filed Dec. 11, 2013, which in turn claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61/738,550, filed on Dec. 12, 2012. The entire disclosure and contents of the above applications are hereby incorporated by reference. FIELD This invention relates to the field of blankets and towels and more particularly to a towel having arm slit formed/sewed onto a back surface of the towel. BACKGROUND There are many occasions that one wraps a towel or blanket around their shoulders. At home, often after being comfortable under a blanket, one wraps the blanket around their shoulders when getting up to keep warm. Likewise, after a shower, one often wraps a towel around their body to keep warm and continue drying. At the beach or pool, typically after bathing, one may wrap a towel around their upper torso to dry off as well as keep warm, especially when there is a breeze. When standing relatively still and not performing other activities, it is often easy to keep a hold onto the blanket or towel to keep it from falling off. There are many times when this is not possible. It is not easy to keep the towel or blanket on one's shoulders when performing other operations such as picking up beach paraphernalia, cooking, tending to children, etc. Wrapping of a towel around one's waist is more secure than covering one's shoulders, but wrapping a towel around one's waist does not dry the upper torso as well as keep that area of the body warm. What is needed is a towel/blanket that will stay in place around one's shoulders without occupying the wearer's hands, thereby freeing the wearer's hands to perform other activities. SUMMARY In one embodiment, a planar sheet is disclosed having a base sheet made of cloth that has a top lengthwise edge, a first widthwise edge and a second widthwise edge. A first arm cover made of the cloth has a first edge and a second edge that are affixed to the base sheet such that an area between the base sheet and the first arm cover defines a first arm channel that has a first shoulder opening proximal to a point that is equidistant from the first widthwise edge and the second widthwise edge of the base sheet and has a first wrist opening proximal to the first widthwise edge of the base sheet. There is a second arm cover also made of the cloth. A first edge and a second edge of the second arm cover is affixed to the base sheet such that an area between the base sheet and the second arm cover defines a second arm channel that has a shoulder opening proximal to the point that is equidistant from the first widthwise edge and the second widthwise edge and has a second wrist opening proximal to the second widthwise edge. In another embodiment, a method of using a towel is disclosed. The towel has a base sheet made of cloth that has a top lengthwise edge, a first widthwise edge and a second widthwise edge. A first arm cover made of the cloth has a first edge and a second edge that are affixed to the base sheet such that an area between the base sheet and the first arm cover defines a first arm channel that has a first shoulder opening proximal to a point that is equidistant from the first widthwise edge and the second widthwise edge of the base sheet and has a first wrist opening proximal to the first widthwise edge of the base sheet.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION Reference will now be made in detail to the presently preferred embodiments of the invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Throughout the following detailed description, the same reference numerals refer to the same elements in all figures. Throughout this description, the towel/blanket 10 is anticipated to be any substantially planar device that is of a size that enables draping of the towel/blanket 10 around a person's shoulders. For example, it is anticipated that the towel/blanket 10 is a towel, blanket, rug, sleeping blanket, mat, etc. Referring to FIGS. 1, 1A, 2, and 3, several views of a towel/blanket 10 with arm covers 20 are shown. The base sheet 12 of the towel/blanket 10 is preferably made of a material that is flexible so as to easily wrap around a person's shoulders or upper torso. Examples of this material are those typically used in fabrication of towels such as cloth, terry cloth, cotton, etc. In some embodiments, other materials are anticipated such as nylon, Mylar, straw mats, etc. The arm covers 20 are preferably made of a sheet of material that is flexible so as to easily adapt to arms inserted into the arm covers 20. Examples of this material are those typically used in fabrication of towels such as cloth, terry cloth, cotton, etc. In some embodiments, other materials are anticipated such as nylon, Mylar, straw mats, etc. There is no requirement that the arm covers 20 be made of the same material as the base sheet 12 of the towel/blanket 10. In some embodiments, the arm covers 20 are made from the same material as the base sheet 12 of the towel/blanket 10 while in other embodiments, the arm covers 20 are made from a different material as the base sheet 12 of the towel/blanket 10. In a preferred embodiment, edges of the material of the arm covers 20 attach to the back of the base sheet 12 of the towel/blanket 10 in a substantially linear upper connection 24 and an arced lower connection 22, though any shape of connections 22/24 is also anticipated. Any type of attachment or connection between the material of the arm covers 20 and the back of the base sheet 12 of the towel/blanket 10 is anticipated including, but not limited to, stitching, gluing, hot welding, etc. In some embodiments, the arm channels 20 are fabricated as part of the base sheet 12 of the towel/blanket 10, for example, during the weaving process. In one embodiment, a top, lengthwise edge 14 of the base sheet 12 is longer than both a first widthwise edge 15 of the base sheet 12 and a second widthwise edge 16 of the base sheet 12. In some embodiments, the first widthwise edge 15 of the base sheet 12 is substantially the same length as the second widthwise edge 16 of the base sheet 12, in that there is no noticeable difference as perceived by the naked eye between the length of the first widthwise edge 15 of the base sheet 12 and the length of the second widthwise edge 16 of the base sheet 12. In some embodiments, the arm covers 20 are wider than the distance between the connections 22/24, thereby forming a bulging channel between the arm covers 20 and the base sheet 12 of the towel/blanket 10 as shown in FIG. 1. The channels 28/30 are wide enough to accept the arms of a person 40 (see FIGS. 4, 5, and 6). In other embodiments, the arm covers 20 are of similar width as the distance between the connections 22/24 so that the arm covers 20 lay substantially flat against the base sheet 12 when not warn as shown in FIG. 1A. By virtue of the width of the arm covers 20 and, hence the distance between the connections 22/24, the arm channel opens as the wearer inserts an arm between the arm channel 22 and the base sheet 12. In the figures, the substantially linear upper connection 24 is wider that the arced lower connection 22, forming angled openings 28. In a preferred embodiment, the openings 28 are larger than the wrist openings 30, making it easier to don. The larger openings 28 also better accommodate the shoulders of the person 40 when the towel/blanket 10 is worn. In a preferred embodiment, both the towel/blanket 10 and the arm channels 20 are made of materials typically used for towels and blankets (e.g. terry cloth, cotton, wool, etc.). This allows the towel/blanket 10 with arm covers 20 to be used for basically any purpose that a towel/blanket of the prior art is used. For example, anticipated uses for the towel/blanket 10 include drying one's body after showering/bathing, lying upon the towel/blanket 10 at the beach, covering one's body with the towel/blanket 10 when cold, wrapping the towel/blanket 10 around one's body, etc. Often, one wraps a towel or blanket [of the prior art] around the person's upper body after a shower/bath, after bathing at the beach/pool/hot tub, or just to keep warm. This serves the intended purpose (to keep warm) using towels and blankets of the prior art, but limits freedom of the user to move about and do anything with their hands and arms because doing such often leads to the towel or blanket falling off. To reduce unwanted falling off of the towel/blanket 10, a person 40 inserts their arms, one each, into each of the arm channels 28, thereby positioning the point 26 where the arm channels converge (e.g., touch or are closest together) roughly centered on the user's back/neck with the towel/blanket 10 covering the upper torso area of the user's back, in some cases, part or all of the user's neck as shown in FIGS. 4, 5, and 6. To facilitate insertion of the arms of a person 40, the inner openings 28 are formed at an angle with respect to the lengthwise edge 14 of the towel/blanket 10. In some embodiments, the angle is approximately 40 degrees with respect to the lengthwise edge 14 of the towel/blanket 10. This angled opening 28 accommodates/accepts portions of the arms and shoulders of the person 40, opening wide enough for the largest anticipated person 40. The upper connections 24 meet or almost meet at an approximately lengthwise central point 26 to enable wrapping around the neck and shoulders of the user. In such, the upper vertexes 27 of the arm channels 22 are close to each other or touch so that when worn, the arm channels 22 cover the shoulders of the wearer as well as the arm of the wearer (or at least a portion of the arm of the wearer). The material of the arm channels 22 between the upper vertexes 27 and the lower vertexes 29 wraps around the wearer's shoulders and, therefore, holds the towel/blanket 10 in place on the wearer's shoulders, when worn, without the use of any straps, buttons, or any fastener. The arm of the person is inserted into the openings 28 and the hands of the person 40 extend out of the wrist openings 30. Although the towel/blanket 10 is shown to be rectangular, any shape is anticipated. Although any shape or arc radius for the lower connection 22 is anticipated, it has been found that a slight arc in lower connection 22 enables bending of the arms of the wearer 40 at the elbow. Preferably, though not required, the upper connection 24 is at an angle with respect to the closer lengthwise edge 14 of the towel/blanket 10, angling closer to the closer lengthwise edge 14 of the towel/blanket 10 near to the point where the arm channels meet (or are closest together) 26. Although any angle is anticipated, a 6 degree slope is preferred. Equivalent elements can be substituted for the ones set forth above such that they perform in substantially the same manner in substantially the same way for achieving substantially the same result. It is believed that the system and method as described and many of its attendant advantages will be understood by the foregoing description. It is also believed that it will be apparent that various changes may be made in the form, construction and arrangement of the components thereof without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention or without sacrificing all of its material advantages.
