Example 79: Synthesis of compound 11359, N-(3-fluorophenyl)-N-((5-(5-(trifluoromethyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl)pyridin-2-yl)methyl)isonicotinamide
[Step 1] Synthesis of methyl 6-((N-(3-fluorophenyl)isonicotinamido)methyl)nicotinate
Methyl 6-(((3-fluorophenyl)amino)methyl)nicotinate (0.200 g, 0.768 mmol) and N,N-diisopropylethylamine (0.268 mL, 1.537 mmol) were dissolved in dichloromethane (10 mL) at room temperature, and isonicotinoyl chloride hydrochloride (0.178 g, 0.999 mmol) was added to the solution. The mixture was stirred at the same temperature for 18 hours. Water was added to the reaction mixture, followed by extraction with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed with saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution, dried with magnesium sulfate anhydrous, filtered, and then concentrated under reduced pressure. The concentrate was purified by column chromatography (SiO2, 12 g cartridge; ethyl acetate/hexane = from 0% to 100%) and concentrated to give the title compound (0.277 g, 98.7%) as colorless oil.
