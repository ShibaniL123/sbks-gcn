Example 54 : Preparation of 6-(2-amino-6-chloropyrimidin-4-yl)-[2,4'-bipyridin]-5-ol
Example 54-1 : Preparation of 4-(6-bromo-3-methoxypyridin-2-yl)-6-chloropyrimidin-2-amine
2-Amino-6-(6-bromo-3-methoxypyridin-2-yl)pyrimidin-4(1H)-one (100 mg, 336.58 mol) obtained in Example 51-2 was dissolved in acetonitrile (2 mL). To the resulting solution were added dropwise benzyltriethylammonium chloride (TEBAC) (153.33 mg, 673.15 µmol), triethylamine (93.82 µL, 673.15 µmol) and phosphoryl chloride (POCl3) (313.72 µL, 3.37 mmol) and the solution was refluxed with heat for 4 hrs and cooled to room temperature. The solution was evaporated under reduced pressure to concentrate and neutralized with 6 N sodium hydroxide. After extraction of the solution with dichloromethane, the organic solvent was dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate (MgSO4), filtered, and evaporated under reduced pressure to concentrate. The resulting solid was washed with diethylether to give the title compound (26 mg, 24 %).
