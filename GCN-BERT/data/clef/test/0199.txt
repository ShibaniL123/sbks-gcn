DETAILED DESCRIPTION [0010] The axon initial segment plays a significant role in action potential modulation and contains more Na+, K+, and Ca2+ channels than the rest of the neuron. The enhanced ion channel structure allows for cell-type-specific neural behavior that modulates the amplitude, chance of initiation, rate of decay, rate of rise, and spike duration of action potentials and influences back-propagation into the soma of the neuron. Slow signals (-1.5 s) occurring below the action potential threshold are processed and can induce an action potential at the axon initial segment and action potentials can carry information in an analog fashion. This analog information reflects the intensity of the stimulus that is received by the neuron. These potentials, termed excitatory pre-synaptic potentials have a small amplitude close to 5 mV with a rise time similar to 20 ms, and a half duration in the order of 100 ms. [0011] Inspection of typical action potential, excitatory pre-synaptic potential, and inhibitory post-synaptic potential waveforms shows that these potentials have exponential trends. These potentials may be driven primarily by the flow of ions into and out of the neuron. For action potentials, relative concentrations of ions in the outside of the neuron against the inside determine the resting potential and AP waveform, and affect the behavior of voltage-gated ion channels. For excitatory pre-synaptic potentials and inhibitory post-synaptic potentials, the neurotransmitters from the pre-synaptic cell may affect the behavior of ion channels in the post-synaptic cell which then regulate waveforms in a process similar to the one seen in action potentials. Each ion channel may behave in a discrete way, where ions are allowed to flow in or out at a specific time point and at a determined variable or constant rate. The summation of the effect of all the ion channels in a specific area of the neural membrane is what gives the potentials their characteristic exponential curve. Embodiments described herein reproduce that exponential behavior and may be implemented in in neural stimulators due to that behavior. Each type of ion channel may correspond to a measurable ionic current that affects the output waveform of the overall signal measured through voltage-clamp methodologies. Several ionic currents with exponential trends may determine one specific signal waveform. The action of the ionic currents may be mathematically simplified to the point that only two currents with opposing signs remain. These currents with opposing signs may represent a depolarization and then repolarization event of the nerve membrane. [0012] Equivalent resistances for nerve fibers may range from 8 ΜΩ to 89 ΜΩ. Due to the high impedance of nerve cells, the effect of the cell may be assumed to be negligible and does not significantly affect the behavior of the circuit. Waveforms simulated based on the design of Figure 1 showed waveforms similar to waveforms associated with the ion channels. According to that design, the difference in the potentials between the two capacitors is the source of the stimulation potential. The circuit of Figure 1 is designed to provide stimulation only when the capacitors are charging or discharging. The circuit provides minimal to no current to the stimulation site when there is a signal powering the circuit; this is due to the fact that the two capacitors are charged to the same voltage. This proves useful whenever the circuit would be in the presence of external signals which could cause undesired behavior. The input voltage or powering signal, can come in various forms including induction coupling, microwave transmission and radio frequency transmission. The powering signal determines the max amplitude of the output stimulation and requires the powering signal to have a minimum amplitude to allow the circuit to function properly. The capacitors and resistors, provide control over the time constant of the stimulation signal, and therefore control the rate of rise and decay of the output waveform. The capacitors also affect the amount of energy that will be transferred into the tissue and the amplitude of the stimulation signal. [0013] Neural stimulation systems consistent with the descriptions herein may take the form of an implantable neural stimulator that has wireless capability, has a passive design, is small scale, and simulates naturally occurring waveforms. Devices such as the devices described herein may, for example, be used to directly stimulate muscle tissue. The circuit design mimics the behavior of ion channels in neurons. In prophetic embodiments, circuits having the general characteristics described herein or as specifically depicted in Figure 1 would be implemented as an integrated circuit, in a multi-channel implementation, or both. Example 1 [0014] An electrical circuit that utilizes a pair of capacitors was developed in an effort to reproduce the additive effect of these depolarization and repolarization events that result in excitatory pre-synaptic potentials, inhibitory post-synaptic potentials, and action potentials. The waveform resulting from the circuit may be used as a stimulation waveform. The circuit utilizes the potential difference between the two capacitors as the stimulation potential. The same potential is used across each capacitor. By setting the potential across one capacitor as a reference for the other capacitor, the difference in their potentials may be used to produce a stimulation potential. Different time constants are defined for each resistor- capacitor segment in order to model the differential activation of ion channels. [0015] The circuit presented in Figure 1 contains transistors, which act as an electrical analogue of ion channels. The capacitors may be varied to provide specific rate-of-rise and rate-of-decay for the voltage induced by the current originating from the transistors. The resistors may be selected to be consistent with resistances found in neural stimulation systems. Ionic inward and outward currents are thus modeled in the resistor capacitor segments. The potential difference between the resistor capacitor segments is the stimulation potential of the system. Thus, by varying the capacitance, resistance, input voltage amplitude, and input voltage timing it is possible to generate several diverse waveforms with varying amplitude, duration, and shape. [0016] Referring now to Figure 1 of the drawings, a Neural stimulator 50 is depicted as having a Signal initiator 100 and a Signal generator 200. Signal initiator 100 may for example include an Alternating current power source 103, a Switch 106, a First magnetic inductance coil 1 10 and a Ground 113. Signal generator 200 may for example include a Ground 203, a Second magnetic inductance coil 210, a Diode 216, a Top metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor 220, a First electrical node 221, a Top capacitor 223, a Top resistor 226, a Top ground 228, a Bottom metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor 240, a Second electrical node 241, a Bottom capacitor 243, a Bottom resistor 246, a Bottom ground 248 and a Stimulation site resistor 250. Components associated with Signal initiator 100 may for example be located outside of a person and components associated with Signal generator 200 may be located inside the body with the components associated with Signal generator 200 being positioned such that voltage waveforms that may be produced by Neural stimulator 50 may initiate actions or other signaling in the body. Various waveforms such as those described herein may be formed by Neural stimulator 50. [0017] Referring now to Figure 2 of the drawings, a Signal generator 200 may include a Top capacitor 223, a Top resistor 226, a Top ground 228, a Bottom capacitor 243, a Bottom resistor 246, a Bottom ground 248, an Input voltage source 300, Input voltage components 303, a Top electrode 280, a Bottom electrode 283 and a Capacitor resistor configuration 320 may be attached to a Nerve 290. The configuration depicted in Figure 2 may be configured to match the circuitry described in Figure 1 or it may be powered by other means. Capacitor resistor configuration 320 and the selection of combinations of various capacitors and resistors placed in the configuration of Capacitor resistor configuration 320 may create configurations conducive to the production of particular wave forms useful for neural signaling. Capacitor resistor configuration 320 may be particularly useful for producing excitatory post-synaptic potential waveforms. [0018] Referring now to Figure 3 of the drawings, which depicts a variety of waveforms and includes: Top electrode waveform 403, Bottom electrode wave form 406, Sodium ion waveform 413, Potassium ion waveform 416, Combined waveform 420, and Maximum stimulation voltage 423. In Figure 3, Top electrode waveform 403 represents the voltage of Top electrode 280 over time and Bottom electrode wave form 406 represents the voltage of Bottom electrode 283 over time. Sodium ion waveform 413 represents voltage induced by activity in sodium ion channels and Potassium ion waveform 416 represents the voltage induced by activity in potassium ion channels. Combined waveform 420 represents either the sum of Top electrode waveform 403 and Bottom electrode wave form 406 or it represents the sum of Sodium ion waveform 413 and Potassium ion waveform 416, as those two sums create essentially identical waveforms. Maximum stimulation voltage 423 represents the maximum voltage of the Combined waveform 420. [0019] Figure 4 of the drawings depicts an Ion channel excitatory postsynaptic potential waveform 463, a Stimulation excitatory post-synaptic potential waveform 466, an Ion channel inhibitory post-synaptic potential waveform 473, and a Stimulation inhibitory post-synaptic potential waveform 476. As can be seen from the figure, the stimulation waveforms produced by embodiments described herein can very closely match the natural ion channel waveforms. [0020] Referring now to Figure 5 of the drawings, an External device 503 may be positioned on or near a Person 500 using a Strap 506 to position External device 503 such that it is in proximity to a Signal generator 200 (not shown). Signal generator 200 may, for example, be positioned at the Spinal cord 508 of Person 500. [0021] Referring now to Figure 6 of the drawings, Signal initiator 100 communicates by a Wireless signal 520 to Individual stimulation devices 530 to stimulate Stimulation sites 533 on Spinal nerves 536. Individual stimulation devices 530 may be configured such that varying signals from Signal initiator 100 induce a variety of nervous system responses by way of the particular configurations of the various Individual stimulation devices 530. Wireless signal 520 may act through the Skin 523 of Person 500. [0022] Certain embodiments described herein have features including a passive design and no internal power supply for the portion of Neural stimulator 50 located in the body. Further, the portion of Neural stimulator 50 located in the body may be constructed such that it lacks any form of instruction or control processing. Still further, Signal initiator 100, Signal generator 200 or both may be constructed in significant part by integrated circuit fabrication having few outside components. Signal generator 200 may further operate without wires that connect Signal generator 200 to any device outside the body and may produce one or more of the types of neural signals described herein. [0023] A working prototype of the device was built using bench top components to allow testing of various capacitor values and the behavior of the circuit. Although not constructed in that form, it is contemplated that the circuitry described herein could be implemented in a very-large-scale integration or in a surface mount device. The types of capacitors used were ceramic and thin- film. The tested capacitor values were 9.26 ± 0.005 nF, 21.5 ± 0.05 nF, 32.6 ± 0.05 nF, 47.2 ± 0.05 nF, 50.0 ± 0.05 nF, 92.7 ± 0.05 nF, 146.2 ± 0.05 nF, 465 ± 0.5 nF, 675 ± 0.5 nF, 976 ± 0.5 nF, and 990 ± 0.5 nF. The input signal timing was also varied, with inputs having 3, 4, 5, 8, 12, and 18 Hz input. This was achieved by adjusting the rotating switch input voltage to the values 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 5.6, 7.0, and 1.0 V, respectively. The input signal was a sine wave 20 KHz, 10 V p-p. The rotating switch methodology affected the time that the signal was charging the circuit, and this time is estimated to be 500 ± 250 for 12 Hz, and 20 ms ± 10 ms for the 3 Hz input timing. Several different waveforms were obtained by varying the capacitance values of the circuit and the timing of the powering signal. The waveforms are characterized by which peak was dominant (primary or secondary), width of the peaks, amplitude of the peaks, and whether or not they resembled action potentials. If a peak was not dominant, it is assumed it does not significantly affect the stimulation potential. In the configuration tested, Top resistor 226 and Bottom resistor 246 were 30 kQ resistors and Stimulation site resistor 250 was a 1 kQ resistor. Table 1, below, indicates particular figures showing the characteristic waveforms, the data set from which the signal was obtained, and the corresponding capacitance values. Table 1 : [0024] Maximum power consumption of the device was calculated by adding the power dissipated through the diode, metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors, and resistors during the duration of one stimulation signal. Power dissipated through the resistors in this case was approximated to be 8.2 pW in one stimulation cycle. Power dissipated through the transistors was approximated to be 0.36 mW each, and the diode dissipated an approximate 0.1 mW. The total power dissipated by the system was approximated to be 0.82 mW. [0025] Mathematical analysis of the circuit of Figure 1 is presented below. The analysis assumes that the signal coming in through the transistors is at a frequency much faster than the discharging rate of the capacitors, and the capacitors are assumed to be constantly charging with negligible ripple due to the high frequency of the input signal. The voltage across the bottom capacitor is and the voltage for the upper capacitor is where Vin is the amplitude of the input signal. The stimulation voltage is then defined simply as: VstimW = Vcl (t) - VC2 (t) [0026] Three factors affect the output signal waveform. The input signal directly affects the maximum output value as it defines the theoretical maximum voltage of an output signal. The input signal can also indirectly affect the shape of the output signal with proper timing. Three input timings can affect the output waveforms depending on when the input signal is turned on or off. The signal can be turned off a long time after it is turned on, turned off quickly after it is turned on, and turned on again quickly after it is turned off. The latter signal timings give rise to stimulation waveforms with two varying peaks. The resistors in the RC segment affect the rate-of-rise and decay of the output signal. The capacitors affect the rate- of-rise and decay, the amplitude of the output waveform, and the shape of the output waveform. For testing purposes, the capacitance was tested across several values ranging from 10 to 1000 nF. The resistance and input voltage signal were kept constant. However, the input voltage signal timing was adjusted when large changes in the time constant occurred in order to properly allow the capacitors to charge.
