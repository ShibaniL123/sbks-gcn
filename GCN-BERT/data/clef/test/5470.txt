[EXAMPLE 1]
Synthesis of compound I-001 and compound 1-002
Step 1 Synthesis of compound 1b
A solution of the compound 1a (43.8 g, 300 mmol) in DMF (307 mL) was warmed to 60°C. Dicyclohexylamine (59.6 mL, 300 mmol) and 1-bromo-3-methyl-2-butene (38.1 mL, 300 mmol) were added to the solution. The mixture was stirred at 60°C for 1 hour. Then, the precipitates were removed by filtration. Water was added to the filtrate, followed by extraction with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed by water and brine and then dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure. Under ice cooling, diphenyldiazomethane (64.1 g, 330 mmol) was added to a solution of the obtained residue in tetrahydrofuran (321 mL). The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 7 hours. The mixture was left standing at room temperature for 2 days. Then, the solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure. The obtained crude product was purified by silica gel column chromatography (hexane-ethyl acetate) to afford the compound 1b (104 g, yield 91%).
