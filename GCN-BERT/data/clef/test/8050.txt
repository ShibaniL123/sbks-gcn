This invention relates to the production of relatively even shades on regenerated cellulose, e.g., viscose rayon by applying thereto trisazo dyes which may be obtained by tetrazotising a 3 : 4r-diaminoazobenzene or a snbstitution product thereof and coupling with suitable coupling components as herein iudieated. The 3 : 4'-diaminoazobenzene and its derivatives are htained by coupling, for instance, a diazotised m-nitroamine of the benzene series with an amine of the benzene series which couples in the par position to the amino group, and reducing the 3-nitro-4 -aminoazobenzene thus oht ined. The 3-nitro-4 -aminoazobensene may be diazotised and coupled, for example, with a sulphonic acid or carbexylie acid derivative of a phenol or napbthol or of an N-substituted naphthylamine or aminonaphthol, the resultant nitro disazo dyestuff reduced and coupled with a coupling component. For the production of the best even dyeing results we have found that it is • les 1 rable that the trisazo dyestuff molecule should contain at least two carboxylic or sulphonic groups. Certain grisazo dyes derived from 4 : 4r-diaminoazobenzene have already been described as substantive dyes for tbe dyeing of cotton, but such dyes have not the valuable property of giving even dyemgs on viscose rayon, that is, a regenerated cellulose, which we have found to be characteristic of trisazo dyes derived from 3 : 4 -diaminoazobenzene. Our invention accordingly represents a valuable contribution in the art of dyeing such regenerated cellulose.

Violet hhe. 1-Amino-5-naphthol-7-sulpbonl¢ acid. 3 : 4'-Diamino-5'-methoxy-2%nethylazobenzene is obtained by coupling m-nitrodiazobenzene with metaminopara cresolmethyl ether and reducing the 3 -nitro-4 -amino-5'-methoxy_2,_methylazobenzene (brown, m.p. about ,163° C.) with sodium sulphide. It forms reddish-brown crystals, which, crystallised from toluene melt at 164-5° C. 3 : 4 -Diaminoazobenzene forms brownish crystals and melts at about 210° C. with decomposition. 3-Nitro-4 -aminoazobenzene, forms orange crystals, melting at 208-209° C. Example.--The goods to be dyed (100 parts) are entered cold into 5,000 pats r of water containing • . 3 parts of soap and 1 part of any of the dyestuffs mentioned in tbe above table. The dyebath is brought to the boil and maintained at or near tbat temperature for hour, about 15 parts of Glauber's salt being added before the fmisb. The rayon is then removed from the bath, rinsed and dried. 1 A process of dyeing regenerated cellulose in comparatively, event shades which censists in applying to the material a dyestuff which filly obtained by tetrazotising a 3 : 4 -diaminoazohenzene or a substitution pro- ',duct thereof and coupling with two molecular proportions of the same different azo dyestuff components provided that m the resultant l r s zQ dyestuff molecule there are at least two carhexylic or sulphoni¢ greups one of each. 2. A process according to Claim 1, in which the dye used is one of those me n.tioned in the table given herein. " KUENNING DxPENNING, Agents ]or the ApI lieants_. Dated this Z th da/y o] March 1980
