[015] Fig. 1 shows an exemplary electronic cigarette 100, including a cartridge 105 and a battery unit 110. The cartridge 105 may have a first end portion 101 for placement in the mouth during use, e.g., the first end portion 101 is coupled to a mouthpiece 103 or filter having an outlet to allow a user to inhale vapor. The second end portion 102 of the cartridge 105 may be configured to connect to the battery unit 110 (or other component(s) of the electronic cigarette 100), as discussed below. Similarly, the battery unit 110 may have a first end portion 116 configured to connect to the cartridge 105 (or other component of the electronic cigarette 100), and a second end portion 117. The second end portion 117 of the battery unit 110 may include an inlet for the passage of air, and may be connected to other components of the electronic cigarette 100, such as a lighted tip 118. [016] The second end portion 102 of the cartridge 105 and the first end portion 115 of the battery unit 110 may include elements complementary to each other to provide for a conveniently detachable, yet secure, connection. As shown in Fig. 1, the connecting end portions of the cartridge 105 and battery unit 110 may be configured as telescoping sleeves. For example, the cartridge 105 may include a first, outer sheath 106, and the battery unit 110 may include a recessed portion as a second, inner sheath 111. Thus, the inner diameter of the first sheath 106 may be greater than the outer diameter of the second sheath 111, such that the first sheath 106 may slide over the second sheath 111. When connected, the outer surfaces of the cartridge 105 and battery unit 110 may lie flush. That is, the cartridge 105 and the battery unit 110 may have equal or approximately equal outer diameters, and the wall thickness of the first sheath 106 may be approximately the same as the difference between the outermost diameter of the battery unit 110 and the outer diameter of the second sheath 111. [017] The cartridge 105 and the battery unit 110 may include inner lumens (108 and 114, respectively) in communication with each other once the components are connected, to allow for the passage of air from the external environment and delivery of vapor through the electronic cigarette 100. For example, the first end portion 101 of the cartridge 105 may be in communication with a proximal outlet (e.g. via mouthpiece 103), and the second end portion 117 of the battery unit 110 may be in communication with a distal inlet (e.g., via a notch or other inlet of the lighted tip 118), each of the inlet and outlet exposed to the external environment. In some embodiments, when the cartridge 105 and the battery unit 110 are connected, the proximal outlet and the distal inlet may be the only portions of the electronic cigarette 100 exposed to the external environment. [018] At least a portion of the inner lumen 108 of the cartridge 105 may be defined by a first inner member 109, such that between the outer sheath 106 and the inner member 109 there may be a cavity 107. In some embodiments, both of the first inner member 109 and the first sheath 106 may extend to the end of the cartridge 105 (e.g., terminating at the same axial position along the longitudinal axis of the cartridge 105). Similarly, the inner lumen 114 of the battery unit 110 may be defined by a second inner member 113 recessed from the end of the battery unit 110. Between the second sheath 111 and the second inner member 113 there may be a space 112. Thus, the battery unit 110 may be inserted into the cartridge 105, wherein the cavity 107 of the cartridge 105 accommodates the second sheath 111, and the space 112 of the battery unit 110 accommodates the first inner member 109. In some embodiments, the first inner member 109 of the cartridge 105 may at least partially surround the second inner member 113 of the battery unit 110 when the cartridge 105 and the battery unit 110 are connected. While Fig. 1 illustrates the battery unit 110 configured for insertion into the cartridge 105, the opposite configuration is possible such that the cartridge may be inserted into the battery unit (i.e., the battery including an outer sheath, and the cartridge including an inner sheath). [019] To assist in securing the two components together, the telescoping elements may include a locking mechanism. In some embodiments, for example, one or more surfaces of the first and second sheaths 106, 111, and/or one or more surfaces of the first and second inner members 109, 113, may be configured to increase friction, e.g., via suitable materials or surface features. In some embodiments, the one or more surfaces of the sheaths 106, 111 and inner members 109, 113, may include a spring or deformable element to exert a force. [020] Fig. 2 illustrates an exemplary locking mechanism for components 205 and 210 of an electronic vaporizing device. For example, component 205 may be a cartridge including any of the features of cartridge 105, and component 210 may be a battery unit including any of the features of battery unit 110, discussed above. Thus, cartridge 205 may include a first sheath 206, a first inner member 209, a cavity 207 defined by the first sheath 206 and first inner member 209, and an inner lumen 208. The battery unit 210 may include a second sheath 211, a second inner member 213, a space 212 defined by the second sheath 211 and the second inner member 213, and an inner lumen 214. Once the cartridge 205 and the battery unit 210 are connected, the first inner member 209 and the second inner member 213 may share a central longitudinal axis L. Further, the inner lumens 208, 214 may be in communication with each other for the passage of air from the external environment through the vaporizing device, from the battery unit 210 to the cartridge 205, as indicated in Fig. 2. In particular, the inner lumens 208, 214 may define an inner lumen of the vaporizing device, e.g., in communication with the external environment via a proximal outlet and a distal inlet. In some embodiments, the electronic vaporizing device may only be in communication with the external environment via the proximal outlet and the distal inlet. [021] The inside surface of the second sheath 211 may include one or more elements 215, e.g., having a first end 215a, a second end 215b, and a portion 215c therebetween that extends radially inward and is deformable such that the portion may be pushed radially outward by force. The locking mechanism may comprise, for example, a single discrete element 215, a plurality of discrete elements 215 disposed at different radial positions, and/or an annular, ring-like element 215 to completely surround the first inner member 209. In some embodiments, a plurality of elements 215 (e.g., two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, or more elements 215) may be disposed at regular intervals along the inside surface of the second sheath 211. As shown in cross-sectional view in Fig. 2, for example, the second sheath 211 may include at least two elements 215 coupled to opposite sides of the second sheath 211, or a single annular element 215 (a cross-sectional view of both embodiments being represented by Fig. 2). In at least one embodiment, the second sheath 211 may include six elements 215 disposed at regular intervals (approximately 60 degrees apart) having gaps between adjacent elements 215. For example, the second sheath 211 may include three pairs of elements 215, each pair comprising two elements 215 opposite each other and facing each other (approximately 180 degrees apart). [022] As shown in Fig. 2, the second sheath 211 may include proximal and distal stepped portions to limit or prevent axial movement of the element(s) 215. For example, the stepped portions may include grooves into which the first and second ends 215a, 215b may be inserted. In some embodiments, one or more elements 215 may be fixedly attached to the second sheath 211. For example, at least one of the first end 215a and the second end 215b of the element(s) 215 may be fixedly attached to the second sheath 211 , such that the element(s) 215 do not rotate or move axially with respect to the second sheath 211. While Fig. 2 shows an exemplary configuration wherein the element(s) 215 are coupled to inner surface(s) of the second sheath 211, the element(s) 215 may be coupled to outer surface(s) of the first inner member 209, e.g., for applying a force against the second sheath 211 when the cartridge 205 and the battery unit 210 are connected. [023] In some embodiments, the element(s) 215 may be rotatable with the respect to the second sheath 211, e.g., by moving the first and second ends 215a, 215b within the grooves of the second sheath 211. For example, a plurality of elements 215 may be interconnected, e.g., coupled together at their first ends 215a and/or second ends 215b via a linkage. All or part of the linkage may be annular in shape and concentric with the second sheath 211, such as a band, ring, or circular wire. In some embodiments, the first ends 215a and/or the second ends 215b may form part of the linkage, e.g., the first and/or second ends 215a, 215b may be integral with the linkage. The annular linkage(s) may allow the plurality of elements 215 to rotate relative to the second sheath 211 while maintaining the spacing between adjacent elements 215. Thus, in some embodiments, the element(s) 215 may not inhibit rotation of the cartridge 205 and the battery unit 210 with respect to each other when the cartridge 205 and the battery unit 210 are connected and locked together. [024] The element(s) 215 may comprise one or more flexible materials, e.g., allowing the middle portion 215c to flex while the first and second ends 215a, 215b are coupled to the second sheath 211. In an unstressed position (as shown in Fig. 2), the middle portion 215c of the element(s) 215 may bulge radially inward. Once the battery unit 210 is inserted into the cartridge 205, the first inner member 209 may contact the element(s) 215 and force them towards the inner wall of the second sheath 211 , e.g., in a stressed position. The force between the first inner member 209 and the element(s) 215 may prevent the cartridge 205 and battery unit 210 from moving with respect to each other (e.g., inhibiting axial and/or rotational movement of the components) or becoming detached. [025] When the cartridge 205 and the battery unit 210 are connected, a distal end 206a of the first sheath 206 may abut a stepped portion 210a of the battery unit 210. In some embodiments, the length of the portion of the first sheath 206 that overlies the second sheath 211 may be approximately equal to the length of the second sheath 211 between its proximal-most end 221a and the stepped portion 210, e.g., such that the cartridge 205 and the battery unit 210 lie flush (e.g., the cartridge 205 and the battery unit 210 having equal or approximately equal outermost diameters). As the battery unit 210 is inserted into the cartridge 205, a distal end 209a of the first inner member 209 may engage the element(s) 215, and force the element(s) 215 radially outward towards the second sheath 211. In a final inserted position, the distal end 209a of the first inner member 209 may abut a stepped portion 213a of the second inner member 213. A proximal-most end of the second inner member 213 may be tapered (as shown in Fig. 2) to facilitate placement of the first inner member 209 into the space 212 between the second sheath 21 1 and the second inner member 213. The first inner member 209 may include a shallow groove or concave portion 209b where it comes into contact with the element(s) 215, e.g., to receive the element(s) 215 and further inhibit movement once the components are connected. [026] Further, as the battery unit 210 is inserted into the cartridge 205, a proximal- most end 21 la of the second sheath 211 may enter the cavity 207 of the cartridge 205, and abut a stepped portion 207a of the cavity 207a in a final inserted position. The proximal- most end 21 la of the second sheath 211 also may be tapered (as shown in Fig. 2) to facilitate placement of the second sheath 211 into the cavity 207. In some embodiments, the cavity 207 of the cartridge 205 may have a shape complementary to the shape of the second sheath 211, and/or the space 212 of the battery unit 210 may have a shape complementary to the shape of the first inner member 209, e.g., to provide for a tight fit. [027] Materials suitable for the element(s) 215 may include metals and metal alloys (including shape memory materials), polymers and polymer blends (including plastics), and combinations thereof, among other possible flexible materials. Materials suitable for the first and second sheaths 206, 211, and first and second inner members 209, 213, include metals and metal alloys, polymers and polymer blends (including plastics), ceramics, and combinations thereof, among other suitable materials. Any of the housing materials disclosed in U.S. Publication No. 2013/0284190 Al; U.S. Publication No. 2013/0284191 Al; U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/906,803, filed November 20, 2013; and/or U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/907,002, filed November 21, 2013, each of which is incorporated by reference herein, may be used according to the present disclosure. [028] In some embodiments, at least a portion of the first and/or second sheaths 206, 211 may be flexible. For example, in at least one embodiment, at least a portion of the second inner member 213 may be flexible to allow the second inner member 213 to flex radially inward of the first inner member 209 when the cartridge 205 and the battery unit 210 are connected (e.g., as the first inner member 209 is placed within the space 212 between the second inner member 213 and the second sheath 211). In other embodiments, the first and/or second sheaths 206, 211 may be partially or completely rigid. Further, the first sheath 206, second sheath 211, first inner member 209, and/or second inner member 213 may have portions that are flexible and portions that are rigid, e.g., to facilitate the secure connection between the cartridge 205 and the battery unit 210. For example, any of the first sheath 206, the second sheath 211, the first inner member 209, and/or the second inner member 213 may comprise a combination of materials, such as different metals or metal alloys, or one or more metals and one or more non-metals, different non-metals, etc. In at least one embodiment, the element(s) 215 may comprise a different metal than the second sheath 211 and the first inner member 209. In at least one embodiment, the first inner member 209 may comprise a combination of a metal and a non-metal. As illustrated by the lighter and darker shaded regions in Fig. 2, different portions of the cartridge 205 and battery unit 210 may comprise different materials or combinations of materials (e.g., the first inner member 209 comprising two or three different materials). Other variations and alternatives consistent with the disclosure herein will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art. [029] While the discussion herein focuses on the connection between the cartridge 105 and battery unit 110 for illustration purposes, the mechanisms presently disclosed are not limited to those particular components, and may be used in connections between any vaporization device components. For example, a cartridge detachable from a battery may allow for replacing or repair of either component, refilling the cartridge (e.g., with a suitable composition, including those disclosed in U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/826,318, filed May 22, 2013; U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/856,374, filed July 19, 2013; and/or U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/969,650, filed March 24, 2014; incorporated by reference herein), or recharging the battery and/or receiving data from the battery unit (e.g., including any of the methods, systems, or other features disclosed in U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/847,364, filed July 17, 2013; and/or U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/971,340, filed March 27, 2014; incorporated by reference herein). Detaching the cartridge 105 from the battery unit 110 also may allow for replacement or repair of any portions of those components, such as a heating coil, wick, core, reservoir, or other portion of a vaporization unit (e.g., including any of the features of a vaporization unit disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 8,539,959; U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/906,803, filed November 20, 2013; U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/938,451, filed February 11, 2014; U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/907,002, filed November 21, 2013; U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/970,587, filed March 26, 2014; U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/968,855, filed March 31, 2014; and/or U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/938,451, filed February 11, 2014; incorporated by reference herein).
