Vaccine Compositions and Methods for Restoring NKG2D Pathway Function Against Cancers CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLCIATIONS This application claims priority to, and the benefit of U.S. S.N. 61/953,064 filed on March 14, 2014, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. GOVERNMENT SUPPORT This invention was made with Government support under Grant No. NCI 1R01CA173750-01, awarded by the National Institutes of Health. The Government has certain rights in the invention. TECHNICAL FIELD This invention relates to methods and compositions for inducing an anti-cancer immune response in a human subject. BACKGROUND MICA is a ligand for NKG2D, a C-type lectin-like, type II transmembrane receptor expressed on most human NK cells, γδ T cells, and CD8+ T cells. Upon ligation, NKG2D signals through the adaptor protein DAP 10 to evoke perforin dependent cytolysis and to provide co-stimulation. In humans, the NKG2D ligands include MHC class I chain-related protein A (MICA), the closely related MICB, UL-16 binding proteins (ULBP) 1-4, and RAE-1G. While NKG2D ligands are not usually found on healthy tissues, various forms of cellular stress, including DNA damage, may upregulate ligand expression, resulting in their frequent detection in multiple solid and hematologic malignancies, including melanoma. NKG2D activation through ligand positive transformed cells contributes to extrinsic tumor immunity, since NKG2D deficient mice manifest enhanced tumor susceptibility. But in many cancer patients NKG2D -mediated tumor immunity is ineffective. In part, immune escape may be achieved by the shedding of NKG2D ligands from tumor cells, which triggers internalization of surface NKG2D and impaired function of cytotoxic lymphocytes. See e.g., Wu et al, "Prevalent Expression of the Immunostimulatory MHC Class I Chain-related Molecule is Counteracted by Shedding in Prostate Cancer," J Clin Invest 114: 560-8 (2004); Groh et al, "Tumour-derived Soluble MIC Ligands Impair Expression of NKG2D and T-cell Activation," Nature 419: 734-8 (2002); Doubrovina et al., "Evasion from NK Cell Immunity by MHC Class I Chain- related Molecules Expressing Colon Adenocarcinoma," J Immunol 171 :6891-9 (2003). A reduction in the density of MIC expressed on the tumor cell surface due to MIC shedding from tumors is also one of the mechanisms for tumor evasion. See Marten et al., "Soluble MIC is Elevated in the Serum of Patients with Pancreatic Carcinoma Diminishing Gamma Delta T Cell Cytotoxicity," Int J Cancer 119:2359-65 (2006). Soluble NKG2D ligands may also stimulate the expansion of regulatory NKG2D+CD4+Foxp3- T cells that may antagonize anti-tumor cytotoxicity through Fas ligand, IL- 10, and TGF-β. MICA is a NKG2D ligand shed from tumor cells, i.e., released from the cell surface into the surrounding medium, and sera from a subset of cancer patients contains elevated levels of the soluble form (sMICA). MIC (the term "MIC" referring to MICA and MICB) shedding is accomplished in part through interactions with the protein disulfide isomerase ERp5, which cleaves a disulfide bond in the MIC a3 domain, rendering it susceptible to proteolysis by ADAM- 10/ 17 and MMP14. Methods of treating cancer by administering anti-MIC antibodies or antigen-binding peptide fragments have been described. For example, US 8,182,809 describes such methods utilizing a purified antibody or a polypeptide comprising an antigen-binding fragment thereof that specifically binds to the amino acid sequence NGTYQT located in the a3 ectodomain of the MIC polypeptide, such that the interaction of the MIC polypeptide and ERp5 is inhibited and the shedding of MIC is inhibited. And US 7,959,916 describes methods of inhibiting the shedding of MIC polypeptides from cancer cells using anti-MIC a3 domain antibodies. Tumor-derived soluble MIC polypeptides, either MICA or MICB, or both, have also been suggested as biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis of cancer and anti- MICA or anti-MICB antibodies as therapeutic agents for the treatment of cancer and autoimmune diseases. For example, US 7,771,718 describes methods of relieving MIC- induced suppression of NKG2D in lymphocytes using anti-MIC antibodies to bind soluble MIC polypeptides. In practice, methods of treating cancer or other diseases with therapeutic antibodies is relatively expensive because of the need to produce large quantities of such antibodies of sufficient purity for infusion to patients. In view of the complexity of large- scale antibody production and the specialized requirements for antibody infusion protocols, alternative methods are needed to target MIC polypeptides in a more efficient and cost-effective manner. The present invention provides a solution to this problem by providing vaccines for the induction of anti-MIC antibodies in a subject. Tumor vaccines are typically composed of tumor antigens and immunostimulatory molecules (e.g. cytokines or TLR ligands) that work together to induce antigen-specific cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) that recognize and lyse tumor cells. At this time, almost all vaccines contain either shared tumor antigens or whole tumor cell preparations (Gilboa, 1999). The shared tumor antigens are immunogenic proteins with selective expression in tumors across many individuals and are commonly delivered to patients as synthetic peptides or recombinant proteins (Boon et al, 2006). In contrast, whole tumor cell preparations are delivered to patients as autologous irradiated cells, cell lysates, cell fusions, heat-shock protein preparations or total mRNA (Parmiani et al., 2007). Since whole tumor cells are isolated from the patient, the cells express patient-specific tumor antigens as well as shared tumor antigens. Finally, there is a third class of tumor antigens that has rarely been used in vaccines due to technical difficulties in identifying them (Sensi et al. 2006). This class consists of proteins with tumor-specific mutations that result in altered amino acid sequences. Such mutated proteins have the potential to: (a) uniquely mark a tumor (relative to non-tumor cells) for recognition and destruction by the immune system (Lennerz et al., 2005); (b) avoid central and sometimes peripheral T cell tolerance, and thus be recognized by more effective, high avidity T cells receptors (Gotter et al, 2004).

Figure 6F depicts that all three human MICA antibodies enhanced ex vivo killing of 51Cr labeled YAC-1 cells by splenocytes. DETAILED DESCRIPTION The present invention provides compositions and methods for treating cancer in a subject by eliciting an immune response against MIC polypeptides. The terms "elicit," "stimulate," and "induce" are used interchangeably to denote the generation of a de novo immune response in a subject or to denote the enhancement of the strength or persistence of an existing immune response. The compositions of the invention contain, as an immunogenic component (also referred to herein as an "immunogen"), at least one MIC peptide which comprises or consists of the full-length alpha 3 domain of MICA [SEQ ID NO: 1] or MICB [SEQ ID NO: 14]. In certain embodiments, the MIC peptide is an epitope selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs 2-13 or SEQ ID NOs: 15-23. In the context of the invention, an epitope is a portion of an antigenic molecule capable of eliciting an immune response to the molecule, preferably a cytotoxic T cell response or an antibody-secreting B cell mediated response, or which can be bound by an antibody. The minimal epitopes represented by SEQ ID NOs: 11-13 and 21-23 were identified by the inventors as the antibody-binding epitopes for the CM33322 Ab4, CM33322 Ab28, and CM33322 Ab29, which are described in U.S. Provisional Application Nos. 61/792,034 and 61/913,198 and in US Application No. 14/025,573. These antibodies were isolated from cancer patients responsive to immunotherapy. These antibodies enhance the activity of NK cells and CD 8 T cells against cancer cells by inhibiting cleavage of MIC proteins from cancer cells. The antibodies bind to the a3 domain of MIC proteins and have strong anti-tumor activity in relevant animal models. These clinical immunological studies evidence that induction of antibodies against the a3 domain of MIC proteins restores anti-tumor immune function against cancers. In accordance with the present invention, the epitopes recognized by these antibodies can be used as the immunogenic component of a cancer vaccine to stimulate antibody production against the MIC a3 domain. An important element of this invention is that antibodies are produced against the MIC a3 domain, but not against the al-a2 domains of MIC, given that the NKG2D receptor on NK cells and CD8 T cells binds to the <xl-<x2 domains. Accordingly, the invention provides the epitopes of the MICA and B proteins that are important for an effective anti-MIC immune response in humans and methods and compositions relating to the use of same as the immunogenic components of a cancer vaccine.

The peptides which form or are incorporated into the vaccine compositions of the invention are preferably purified from contaminating chemical precursors, if chemically synthesized, or substantially free of cellular material from the cell or tissue source from which they are derived. In a specific embodiment, the peptides are 60%, preferably 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, or 99% free of contaminating chemical precursors, proteins, lipids or nucleic acids.

In this context, the term "similar" refers to amino acid sequence similarity which is defined according to the number of conservative and non-conservative amino acid changes in a query sequence relative to a reference sequence. Conservative and non-conservative amino acid changes are known in the art. See, for example, W. R. Taylor, The Classification of Amino Acid Conservation, J. Theor. Biol. 1986 119:205-218, and D. Bordo and P. Argos, Suggestions for "Safe" Residue Substitutions in Site-Directed Mutagensis, 1991 J. Mol. Biol. 217:721 -729. Generally, a conservative amino acid change refers to a substitution of one amino acid for another amino acid having substantially similar chemical properties, specifically with reference to the amino acid side chains. A non-conservative change refers to a substitution of one amino acid for another amino acid having substantially different chemical properties. Generally, conservative substitutions are those recognized in the art as being unlikely to affect the overall structure or biological function of the polypeptide, while non-conservative changes are recognized as more likely to affect structure and function. Non-limiting examples of a conservative amino change include substitution of amino acids within the following groups: aliphatic, aromatic, polar, nonpolar, acidic, basic, phosphorylatable hydrophobic, hydrophilic, small nonpolar, small polar, large nonpolar, and large polar. Non-limiting examples of non-conservative amino acid changes include substitutions of amino acids between the foregoing groups. In one embodiment, a conservative amino acid change is a substitution in which the substitution matrix for the pair of residues has a positive value. Examples of amino acid substitution matrices are known in the art, for example the BLOSUM50 matrix or the PAM250 matrix (see W. A. Pearson, Rapid and Sensitive Sequence Comparison with FASTP and FASTA, Meth. Enzymology, 1990 183:63-98, ed. R. Doolittle, Academic Press, San Diego). For further examples of scoring matrices and a comparison between them see M. S. Johnson and J. P. Overington, 1993, A Structural Basis for Sequence Comparisons: An Evaluation of Scoring Methodologies, J. Mol. Biol. 233:716-738. In a preferred embodiment, a conservative amino acid change is a substitution of one amino acid for another amino acid within the same chemical group wherein the groups are selected from neutral and polar amino acids (Ser, Thr, Pro, Ala, Gly, Asn, Gin), negatively charged and polar amino acids (Asp, Glu), positively charged and polar amino acids (His, Arg, Lys), nonpolar amino acids lacking a ring structure (Met, He, Leu, Val), nonpolar amino acids having a ring structure (Phe, Tyr, Trp), and Cysteine. In one embodiment, the vaccine composition of the invention comprises as its immunogenic component a chimeric protein which consists of two or more MIC peptide epitopes independently selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs 2-13 or SEQ ID NOs: 15-23 in which the epitopes are linked. In one embodiment, the two or more MIC peptide epitopes are the same epitope. In another embodiment, the two or more MIC peptide epitopes comprise at least two MIC peptide epitopes that are different. In one embodiment, the vaccine composition comprises as its immunogenic component the chimeric protein displayed on the surface of a viral capsid, such as a Hepatitis B core capsid. In one embodiment, the vaccine composition of the invention comprises as its immunogenic component a chimeric protein which consists of two or more MIC peptide epitopes selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs 2-13 or SEQ ID NOs: 15-23 placed into an immunoglobulin (Ig) domain having a similar overall immunoglobulin fold compared to MICA. In one embodiment, the Ig domain is an Ig domain selected from one of the following: UL18 (human CMV), the C-terminal Ig domain of IFN- alpha/beta binding protein C12R (poxvirus decoy receptor, PDB ID:30Q3), the N- terminal Ig domain of outer capsid protein from a T4-like bacteriophage (Hoc, PDB ID: 3SHS), and the human CMV protein US2 (PDB ID: 1IM3). In one embodiment, the vaccine composition of the invention comprises two separate components adapted to be administered separately, the first component comprising an immunogen consisting of a first MIC peptide which comprises or consists of the full-length alpha 3 domain of MICA [SEQ ID NO: 1] or MICB; the second component comprising an immunogen consisting of one or more MIC peptide epitopes selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs 2-13 or SEQ ID NOs: 15-23. In one embodiment, the vaccine composition comprises a first component comprising an immunogen consisting of a first MIC peptide which comprises or consists of the full- length alpha 3 domain of MICA [SEQ ID NO: 1]; and one or more additional components, each comprising an immunogen consisting of one or more MIC peptide epitopes selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs 2-13 or SEQ ID NOs: 15-23. Preferably, the first component is administered before the second or additional components in a prime -boost fashion according to methods known in the art. In one embodiment consistent with any of the foregoing embodiments, the vaccine composition of the invention may comprise one or more polynucleotide sequences encoding the MIC epitopes of SEQ ID NOs 1-23. In a further embodiment, the DNA encoding the one or more MIC epitopes is in the form of a nanoparticle comprising the DNA. Peptide Variants In some instances, amino acid sequences of the peptides disclosed herein can be modified and varied to create peptide variants (e.g., peptides with a defined sequence homology to the peptides disclosed herein), for example, so long as the antigen binding property of the peptide variant is maintained or improved relative to the unmodified peptide (antigen binding properties of any modified peptide can be assessed using the in vitro and/or in vivo assays described herein and/or techniques known in the art). While peptide variants are generally observed and discussed at the amino acid level, the actual modifications are typically introduced or performed at the nucleic acid level. For example, variants with 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98, or 99% amino acid sequence identity to the peptides of the invention can be generated by modifying the nucleic acids encoding the peptides or portions/fragments thereof, using techniques (e.g., cloning techniques) known in the art. Amino acid sequence modifications typically fall into one or more of three classes: substitutional, insertional, or deletional modifications. Insertions include amino and/or terminal fusions as well as intra-sequence insertions of single or multiple amino acid residues. Insertions ordinarily will be smaller insertions than those of amino or carboxyl terminal fusions, for example, on the order of one to four residues. Deletions are characterized by the removal of one or more amino acid residues from the protein sequence. Typically, no more than about from 2 to 6 residues are deleted at any one site within the protein molecule. Amino acid substitutions are typically of single residues, but can occur at a number of different locations at once; insertions usually will be on the order of about from 1 to 10 amino acid residues; and deletions will range about from 1 to 30 residues. Deletions or insertions can be made in adjacent pairs, i.e., a deletion of 2 residues or insertion of 2 residues. Substitutions, deletions, insertions or any combination thereof may be combined to arrive at a final construct. The mutations must not place the sequence out of reading frame and preferably will not create complementary regions that could produce secondary mR A structure. Substitutional modifications are those in which at least one residue has been removed and a different residue inserted in its place. In some instances, substitutions can be conservative amino acid substitutions. In some instances, peptides herein can include one or more conservative amino acid substitutions relative to a peptide of the invention. For example, variants can include 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 20-30, 30-40, or 40-50 conservative amino acid substitutions relative to a peptide shown in Table 1. Alternatively, variants can include 50 or fewer, 40 or fewer, 30 or fewer, 20 or fewer, 10 or fewer, 9 or fewer, 8 or fewer, 7 or fewer, 6 or fewer, 5 or fewer, 4 or fewer, 3 or fewer, or 2 or fewer conservative amino acid substitutions relative to a peptide shown in Table 1. Such substitutions generally are made in accordance with the following Table 2 and are referred to as conservative substitutions. Methods for predicting tolerance to protein modification are known in the art (see, e.g., Guo et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA, 101(25):9205-9210 (2004)). Table 2: Conservative Amino Acid Substitutions Amino Acid Substitutions (others are known in the art) Ala Ser, Gly, Cys Arg Lys, Gin, His Asn Gin, His, Glu, Asp Asp Glu, Asn, Gin Cys Ser, Met, Thr Gin Asn, Lys, Glu, Asp, Arg Glu Asp, Asn, Gin Gly Pro, Ala, Ser His Asn, Gin, Lys lie Leu, Val, Met, Ala Leu lie, Val, Met, Ala Lys Arg, Gin, His Met Leu, He, Val, Ala, Phe Phe Met, Leu, Tyr, Trp, His Ser Thr, Cys, Ala Thr Ser, Val, Ala Trp Tyr, Phe Tyr Trp, Phe, His Val He, Leu, Met, Ala, Thr In some instances, substitutions are not conservative. For example, an amino acid in a peptide shown in Table 1 can be replaced with an amino acid that can alter some property or aspect of the peptide. In some instances, non-conservative amino acid substitutions can be made, e.g., to change the structure of a peptide, to change the binding properties of a peptide (e.g., to increase or decrease the affinity of binding of the peptide to an antigen and/or to alter increase or decrease the binding specificity of the peptide to the antigen). In some instances, peptides and/or peptide variants can include or can be fragments of the peptides shown in Table 1. Such fragments can include, for example, 1 , 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 50- 100, 101-150, fewer amino acids than the CDRs, FRs, and/or AAs shown in Table 1, e.g., so long as the fragments retain at least at portion of the binding properties of the full- length peptide (e.g., at least 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, or 100% of the binding properties of the full-length peptide). Truncations can be made at the amino-terminus, the carboxy-terminus, and/or within the peptides herein. In some instances, the interacting face of a peptide variant can be the same (e.g., substantially the same) as an unmodified peptide, e.g., to alter (e.g., increase or decrease), preserve, or maintain the binding properties of the peptide variant relative to the unmodified peptide. Methods for identifying the interacting face of a peptide are known in the art (Gong et al, BMC: Bioinformatics, 6: 1471-2105 (2007); Andrade and Wei et al, Pure and Appl. Chem., 64(11): 1777-1781 (1992); Choi et al, Proteins: Structure, Function, and Bioinformatics, 77(1): 14-25 (2009); Park et al., BMC: and Bioinformatics, 10: 1471-2105 (2009). Those of skill in the art readily understand how to determine the identity of two polypeptides (e.g., an unmodified peptide and a peptide variant). For example, identity can be calculated after aligning the two sequences so that the identity is at its highest level. Another way of calculating identity can be performed by published algorithms. Optimal alignment of sequences for comparison may be conducted by the local identity algorithm of Smith and Waterman, Adv. Appl. Math, 2:482 (1981), by the identity alignment algorithm of Needleman and Wunsch, J. Mol. Biol. 48:443 (1970), by the search for similarity method of Pearson and Lipman, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85:2444 (1988), by computerized implementations of these algorithms (GAP, BESTFIT, FASTA, and TFASTA in the Wisconsin Genetics Software Package, Genetics Computer Group, 575 Science Dr., Madison, WI), or by inspection. The same types of identity can be obtained for nucleic acids by, for example, the algorithms disclosed in Zuker, Science 244:48-52 (1989); Jaeger et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86:7706-10 (1989); Jaeger et al, Methods Enzymol. 183:281-306 (1989), which are herein incorporated by reference for at least material related to nucleic acid alignment. It is understood that any of the methods typically can be used and that in certain instances the results of these various methods may differ, but the skilled artisan understands if identity is found with at least one of these methods, the sequences would be said to have the stated identity and to be disclosed herein. In some instances, as described in more detail under the methods section below, therapeutic compositions disclosed herein can be produced using genetic material (e.g., DNA and/or m NA) isolated and/or purified from immune cells (e.g., B cells, including memory B cells) obtained using the methods disclosed herein. Once such genetic material has been obtained, methods for using it to produce the therapeutic compositions disclosed herein are known in the art and/or are summarized below. In some instances, peptides can include a detectable label. As used herein, a "label" refers to a moiety that has at least one element, isotope, or functional group incorporated into the moiety which enables detection of the peptide to which the label is attached. Labels can be directly attached (i.e., via a bond) or can be attached by a linker (e.g., such as, for example, a cyclic or acyclic, branched or unbranched, substituted or unsubstituted alkylene; cyclic or acyclic, branched or unbranched, substituted or unsubstituted alkenylene; cyclic or acyclic, branched or unbranched, substituted or unsubstituted alkynylene; cyclic or acyclic, branched or unbranched, substituted or unsubstituted heteroalkylene; cyclic or acyclic, branched or unbranched, substituted or unsubstituted heteroalkenylene; cyclic or acyclic, branched or unbranched, substituted or unsubstituted heteroalkynylene; substituted or unsubstituted arylene; substituted or unsubstituted heteroarylene; or substituted or unsubstituted acylene, or any combination thereof, which can make up a linker). Labels can be attached to a peptide at any position that does not interfere with the biological activity or characteristic of the inventive polypeptide that is being detected. Labels can include: labels that contain isotopic moieties, which may be 2 3 13 14 15 31 32 radioactive or heavy isotopes, including, but not limited to, H, H, C, C, N, P, P, 35S, 67Ga, 99mTc (Tc-99m), mIn, 123I, 125I, 169Yb, and 186Re; labels that include immune or immunoreactive moieties, which may be antibodies or antigens, which may be bound to enzymes {e.g., such as horseradish peroxidase); labels that are colored, luminescent, phosphorescent, or include fluorescent moieties (e.g., such as the fluorescent label FITC); labels that have one or more photoaffinity moieties; labels that have ligand moieties with one or more known binding partners (such as biotin-streptavidin, FK506-FKBP, etc.). In some instances, labels can include one or more photoaffinity moieties for the direct elucidation of intermolecular interactions in biological systems. A variety of known photophores can be employed, most relying on photoconversion of diazo compounds, azides, or diazirines to nitrenes or carbenes (see, e.g., Bayley, H., Photogenerated Reagents in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (1983), Elsevier, Amsterdam, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference). In certain embodiments of the invention, the photoaffinity labels employed are o-, m- and p-azidobenzoyls, substituted with one or more halogen moieties, including, but not limited to 4-azido-2, 3,5,6- tetrafluorobenzoic acid. Labels can also be or can serve as imaging agents. Exemplary imaging agents include, but are not limited to, those used in positron emissions tomography (PET), computer assisted tomography (CAT), single photon emission computerized tomography, x-ray, fluoroscopy, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); anti-emetics; and contrast agents. Exemplary diagnostic agents include but are not limited to, fluorescent moieties, luminescent moieties, magnetic moieties; gadolinium chelates (e.g., gadolinium chelates with DTPA, DTPA-BMA, DOTA and HP-D03A), iron chelates, magnesium chelates, manganese chelates, copper chelates, chromium chelates, iodine -based materials useful for CAT and x-ray imaging, and radionuclides. Suitable radionuclides include, but are not limited to, 1231, 125I, 130I, 131I, 133I, 135I, 47Sc, 72As, 72Se, 90Y, 88Y, 97Ru, 100Pd, 101mRh, 119Sb, 128Ba, 197Hg, 211At, 212Bi, 212Pb, 109Pd, mIn, 67Ga, 68Ga, 67Cu, 75Br, 77Br, 99mTc, 14C, 13N, 150, 32P, 33P, and 18F. Fluorescent and luminescent moieties include, but are not limited to, a variety of different organic or inorganic small molecules commonly referred to as "dyes," "labels," or "indicators." Examples include, but are not limited to, fluorescein, rhodamine, acridine dyes, Alexa dyes, cyanine dyes, etc. Fluorescent and luminescent moieties may include a variety of naturally occurring proteins and derivatives thereof, e.g., genetically engineered variants. For example, fluorescent proteins include green fluorescent protein (GFP), enhanced GFP, red, blue, yellow, cyan, and sapphire fluorescent proteins, reef coral fluorescent protein, etc. Luminescent proteins include luciferase, aequorin and derivatives thereof. Numerous fluorescent and luminescent dyes and proteins are known in the art (see, e.g., U.S. Patent Publication 2004/0067503; Valeur, B., "Molecular Fluorescence: Principles and Applications," John Wiley and Sons, 2002; and Handbook of Fluorescent Probes and Research Products, Molecular Probes, 9th edition, 2002). Peptides for use in the vaccine compositions of the invention can be made synthetically. In certain embodiments, one or more peptide bonds is replaced, e.g., to increase physiological stability of the peptide, by: a retro-inverso bonds (C(O)-NH); a reduced amide bond (NH-CH2); a thiomethylene bond (S-CH2 or CH2-S); an oxomethylene bond (0-CH2 or CH2-0); an ethylene bond (CH2-CH2); a thioamide bond (C(S)-NH); a trans-olefm bond (CH=CH); a fluoro substituted trans-olefm bond (CF=CH); a ketomethylene bond (C(O)-CHR) or CHR-C(O) wherein R is H or CH3; and a fiuoro-ketomethylene bond (C(O)-CFR or CFR-C(O) wherein R is H or F or CH3. In certain embodiments, the peptides are modified by one or more of acetylation, amidation, biotinylation, cinnamoylation, farnesylation, fluoresceination, formylation, myristoylation, palmitoylation, phosphorylation (Ser, Tyr or Thr), stearoylation, succinylation and sulfurylation.

In some embodiments the subject has been diagnosed as having a cancer or as being predisposed to cancer. The vaccine compositions of the invention may be administered separately or as part of a therapeutic regimen or combination therapy, as described below. The vaccine compositions of the invention may also be administered singly, or in multiple administrations, for example in a prime-boost strategy. In this context, the term "prime- boost" refers to the use of two different immunogens in succession. The two different immunogens are typically administered successively following a period of time such as 10 to 30 days or 10 to 60 days. In one embodiment, the period of time is from 2 to 4 weeks. Thus, for example, in one embodiment a vaccine composition of the invention is administered at time zero and a second vaccine composition of the invention (comprising a different immunogen) is administered following a period of time, for example from 10 to 30 days, from 10 to 60 days, or from 2 to 4 weeks. In one embodiment, one or a plurality of different vaccine compositions of the invention is administered to the subject at multiple sites as described in US 8,110,196.

Exemplary methods of administration are described in the FDA's CDER Data Standards Manual, version number 004 (which is available at fda.give/cder/dsm/DRG/drg00301.htm). Preferably, the route of administration is selected to target a composition to a particular site, for example, by injection directly into a lymph node or a lymph node cluster, by oral administration to target the lymph nodes of the stomach, by anal administration to target the lymph nodes of the rectum, by inhalation or aerosol to target the lymph nodes of the lungs, or by any other suitable route of administration. Where the methods of the invention comprise administering a vaccine composition to multiple sites, each composition is preferably administered at substantially the same time, for example, within one to eight hours or during the same doctor's visit. In one embodiment, each composition is administered within one to two hours, within one to three hours, within one to four hours, or within one to five hours. Where the vaccine composition is in the form of a scaffold, the method of vaccinating a subject comprises implanting the scaffold composition in the subject, preferably subcutaneous implantation. In certain embodiments, the method of vaccinating a subject may comprise implanting or injecting the scaffold vaccine composition in two or more areas of the subject's anatomy. In one embodiment, the methods of the invention further comprise administering to the subject antigen presenting cells which have been sensitized with at least one MIC peptide selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs: 2-13. In a preferred embodiment, the antigen presenting cells are dendritic cells. In one embodiment, the method further comprises administering to the subject one or more adjuvants. In one embodiment, the one or more adjuvants is selected from the group consisting of an oil-based adjuvant, a CpG DNA adjuvant, a mineral salt adjuvant, a mineral salt gel adjuvant, a particulate adjuvant, a microparticulate adjuvant, a mucosal adjuvant, and a cytokine. Such adjuvants may either be formulated with the compositions of the invention or administered separately from the compositions, e.g., prior to, concurrently with, or after the compositions are administered to the subject. The methods disclosed herein can be applied to a wide range of species, e.g., humans, non-human primates (e.g., monkeys), horses, cattle, pigs, sheep, deer, elk, goats, dogs, cats, mustelids, rabbits, guinea pigs, hamsters, rats, and mice. The terms "treat" or "treating," as used herein, refers to partially or completely alleviating, inhibiting, ameliorating, and/or relieving the disease or condition from which the subject is suffering. In some instances, treatment can result in the continued absence of the disease or condition from which the subject is suffering. In general, methods include selecting a subject at risk for or with a condition or disease. In some instances, the subject's condition or disease can be treated with a pharmaceutical composition disclosed herein. For example, in some instances, methods include selecting a subject with cancer, e.g., wherein the subject's cancer can be treated by targeting one or both of MICA and/or angiopoetin-2. In some instances, treatments methods can include a single administration, multiple administrations, and repeating administration as required for the prophylaxis or treatment of the disease or condition from which the subject is suffering. In some instances treatment methods can include assessing a level of disease in the subject prior to treatment, during treatment, and/or after treatment. In some instances, treatment can continue until a decrease in the level of disease in the subject is detected. The terms "administer," "administering," or "administration," as used herein refers to implanting, absorbing, ingesting, injecting, or inhaling, the inventive peptide, regardless of form. In some instances, one or more of the peptides disclosed herein can be administered to a subject topically (e.g., nasally) and/or orally. For example, the methods herein include administration of an effective amount of compound or compound composition to achieve the desired or stated effect. Specific dosage and treatment regimens for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors, including the activity of the specific compound employed, the age, body weight, general health status, sex, diet, time of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, the severity and course of the disease, condition or symptoms, the patient's disposition to the disease, condition or symptoms, and the judgment of the treating physician. Following administration, the subject can be evaluated to detect, assess, or determine their level of disease.

EXAMPLES The invention is further described in the following examples, which do not limit the scope of the invention described in the claims. Example 1: Design of Chimeric Protein with Properly Placed Epitopes for MICA Antibodies Two designs are shown in Figures 3 and 4. In the first design (Figure 3) the two key epitopes recognized by human MICA antibodies were placed into an irrelevant protein (UL18 from human CMV) which has a similar overall immunoglobulin fold. This protein should be especially useful in the context of a booster following primary immunization with the human MICA a3 domain. In the second design (Figure 4) a minimal protein is created in which the two key epitopes are linked. This protein could be displayed on the surface of a viral capsid, such as Hepatitis B core capsid since N- and C-termini are in close vicinity. Example 2: Therapeutic activity of human MICA antibodies Methods The study design was approved by the institutional animal care and use committee (IACUC, protocol ID 08-049). Six-week-old male SCID (ICR-Prkdcscid) mice were obtained from Taconic (Hudson, NY). U937 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). For survival experiments, 2xl06 cells were injected into the peritoneal cavity of naive mice. Tumors were allowed to grow for ten days prior to randomization of mice into blinded treatment groups. Each treatment group contained ten mice, which is sufficient to discern survival benefits per the laboratory's previous experience. Randomization was based on in vivo imaging of mice, with treatment groups containing mice with similar overall mean signal intensity, indicating similar tumor burden. Treatments were blinded by an outside lab member not performing survival experiments. Investigators administered treatments in syringes labeled "Group A" or "Group B". Study was unblended at the conclusion of each survival experiment. Antibody treatments were given intravenously at a 100μg/dose. Animals received three doses per week for a total of three weeks. Mice were bled weekly for the detection of circulating sMICA. All mice were included in the analysis. For short-term treatment, 2xl06 U937 cells were implanted subcutaneously and allowed to establish tumors for ten days. Mice with palpable tumors were then treated for one 1 week (3x 100μ§) with fully human antibodies (isotype, AML Ab2, Mel Ab28, or Mel Ab29). Eight days following initial treatment, mice were sacrificed, and tumors and spleens were excised, with tumor mass recorded. Tumors were cut into small pieces in Petri dishes containing 5mL of digestion media containing RPMI media with 2% FBS, 50 U/ml collagenase type IV (Invitrogen), and 10 U/mL DNAse (Roche). Tissues were incubated in digestion medium at 37°C for 2 hours. Tumors were then further dissociated using a gentleMACS Dissociator (Miltenyi Biotech). Supernatant of tumor cell suspension was saved for measurement of local sMICA concentrations. Cell suspensions were filtered through a 70μΜ strainer and washed three times with PBS. Single cell suspensions were then stained for NK cell analysis with Zombie Yellow (viability dye, BioLegend), NKG2D-APC (CX5), Perforin-PE (eBioOMAK-D), CD45-PacBlue (30- Fl l), NKp46-PerCP/Cy5.5 (29A1.4), IFNy-BV711 (XMG1.2), NK1.1-BV510 (PK136), CD 16-APC/Cy7 (93), and CD49b-FITC (DX5). All antibodies were from BioLegend with the exception of Perforin (eBiosciences). An additional separate aliquot of cells was stained for MICA expression using anti-MICA-PE (clone 6D4, BioLegend). It is to be understood that while the invention has been described in conjunction with the detailed description thereof, the foregoing description is intended to illustrate and not limit the scope of the invention, which is defined by the scope of the appended claims. Other aspects, advantages, and modifications are within the scope of the following claims. Human MICA/B antibodies potently inhibit MICA shedding in the tumor microenvironment A mouse model for assessment of the therapeutic efficacy of human MICA antibodies was established . Mice do not have MICA or MICB orthologs, but the mouse NKG2D receptor recognizes human MICA/B. See Liu et al. 2013. JCI 123(10): 4410- 4422. We implanted human U937 cells, an AML cell line, in SCID mice that have NK cells but are deficient in T and B cells. This model allowed us to determine the impact of human MICA antibodies on NK cell mediated immunity against human tumor cells, but CD8 T cell responses could not be evaluated in this model. MICA antibody AML Ab2 was expressed with a murine IgG2a Fc segment to enable appropriate interaction with murine Fc receptors. The patient antibody had the human IgGl isotype, which is functionally similar to mouse IgG2a. Mice were implanted with U937 cells and randomized to blinded treatment groups after ten days. Treatment for a three-week period (3xl0(^g/week) provided a substantial survival benefit, with 55% survival at day 45 in the treatment group (AML Ab2) compared to 0% in the control group (Istotype). See Figure 5 A. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that sMICA became undetectable in sera after only two weeks of antibody treatment, while sMICA levels rose in the control group. See Figure 5B. We next examined the functional effects of treatment at an early time point using three fully human MICA/B antibodies. Following one week of treatment of SCID mice with subcutaneous tumors, sMICA levels were greatly reduced in mice in AML Ab2, Mel Ab28, and Mel Ab29 treatment groups compared to isotype control. See Figure 5C. Flow cytometric analysis of tumors also revealed significantly increased expression of MICA on the surface of the tumor cells, mirroring in vitro results. See Figure 5D. These results established that human MICA/B antibodies potently inhibit MICA shedding in the tumor microenvironment and thereby increase the density of MICA on tumor cells for recognition by cytotoxic lymphocytes. Human MICA/B antibodies thus improve both local and systemic NK cell mediated immunity against tumor cells We performed further mechanistic studies on tumor-infiltrating NK cells at the one week time point of treatment. Inhibition of MICA shedding in tumors increased NKG2D surface expression on tumor-infiltrating NK cells. See Figure 6A. Antibody treatment also resulted in >40-fold expansion of tumor-infiltrating NK cells and enhanced expression of the NKp46 receptor. See Figures 6B and 6C. Expanded tumor-infiltrating NK cells produced larger quantities of IFNy, a cytokine critical for anti-tumor immunity, and expressed higher levels of perforin, a key molecule for cytotoxic function. See Figures 6d and 6e. To determine cytotoxic potential of NK cells in MICA/B antibody treated mice, we assessed killing of YAC-1 cells ex vivo by splenic NK cells. Enhanced killing was observed across all anti-MICA antibody treated mice relative to isotype treated mice. See Figure 6F. Human MICA/B antibodies thus improve both local and systemic NK cell mediated immunity against tumor cells. 1.
