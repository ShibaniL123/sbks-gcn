The invention relates to a component for shortening a chain, particularly one made of round steel links, said component being provided with a connector bow which can be hung into a connector body, which is preferably provided with a fiat portion, said connector bow having an insertion opening that can be closed by a safety bolt, and said component having, on the end lying below the connector bow, a shortening member for shortening the chain, whose end link is captively connected to the component with the help of a retainer pin, whereby the safety bolt is formed as a retainer pin for the end link of the chain, said retainer pin being secured against moving. State of the art A component of the preceding type is known from Figures 5 and 6 of WO 97/23405. In the known design, the safety bolt is arranged in the area of the insertion opening of the connector bow in such a manner that it can move against the action of a spring, while the retainer pin for the end link of the chain to be shortened is, together with the shortening member, located, at a distance from the opening of the connector bow, at the lower end of the component, and the shortening organ and the bore holes of the retainer pin held in place on both sides lie in a common plane that runs roughly perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the component. The known component is not fully satisfactory, because the minimum value by which the chain can be shortened is comparably high, due to the position of the retainer pin and the shortening member. The reason for this lies in the fact that the number of chain links needed for forming the chain loop between the end link of the chain and the chain link that is closest to the end link and that can be hung into the shortening member is comparably high due to the chain path that results from the position of the retainer pin and the shortening member. Description of the invention The object of the invention is to create a component of the type being considered, whereby said component makes it possible to shorten a chain by smaller amounts than is possible with the known component. This object is solved according to the invention in that the shortening organ is arranged on the end of the component that lies below the retainer pin, Due to the position of the retainer pin above the shortening member, the retaining pin taking on a securing function and, so to speak, forming a combination bolt, small shortening lengths can be maUzed, which is particularly desirable in the case of multiplestrand suspension gear. It furthermore proves to be advantageous that the manufacturing effort for the component is reduced due to the omission of a bolt and its support. Ultimately the handling of the component during shortening is also made easier, because, unlike in the case of the known component, a partial twining of the shortening member through the chain is made superfluous. Further details and features of the invention result from the following description of a number of embodiments and from the dependent claims. Brief description of the drawings Shown are: Fig. 1 the front view of a component formed in the manner of a shortening hook with the non-shortened chain Fig. 2 the side view of the component according to Figure 1 Fig. 3 the front view of the component according to Figures 1 and 2, with a minimally shortened chain Fig. 4 the side view of the component according to Figure 3 Fig. 5 the front view of a component formed in the manner of a shortening bracket with a non-shortened chain Fig. 6 the side view of the component according to Figure Fig. 7 the front view of the component according to Figures 5 and 6, with a minimally shortened chain Fig. 8 the side view of the component according to Figure 7 Fig. 9 the front view of a component formed in the manner of a shortening claw with a non-shortened chain Fig. 10 the side view of the component according to Figure 9 Fig. 11 the front view of the component according to Figures 8 and 9, with a minimally shortened chain Fig. 12 the side view of the component according to Figure 11 Ways to execute the invention The component shown in Figures 1 to 4 and formed in the manner of a shortening hook has a base body 1, whose upper end is formed as a connector bow 2 with an insertion slot 4 that is bridged by a retainer pin 3 and that is for a connector body 6 that is provided with a fiat portion 5, while the lower end of the component forms a shortening member 7 consisting of a hook. One end of the retainer pin is held in a blind bore 8, while its other end rests in a through bore 9 that is aligned with the blind bore 8. A spring pin 10 secures the retainer pin 3 in the bore holes 8, 9 which receive the retainer pin, The end link 11 of a chain 12, only a short portion of which is shown in the figures and which is formed from a section of a round steel chain, is connected to the retainer pin 3. To shorten the chain 12 by the smallest amount possible, it is necessary to form a chain loop, shown in Figure 3, consisting of a total of 7 links. In practice, this corresponds to a shortening of the chain 12 by an amount in the order of only three times the link division t. The embodiment according to Figures 5 through 8 involves a component whose base body 13 is provided with a shortening organ 14 on its lower and, said shortening organ 14 being formed in a known manner by a bracket equipped with a pull-through opening and a longitudinal slot bounded by support surfaces on the sides, while the design of the upper and corresponds to the design of the upper end of the component according to Figures 1 through 4. In this case, again, a retainer pin 3 for the end link 11 of a chain 12 serves to close the insertion slot 4 for the connector body 6 that is provided with a flat portion 5, i.e., here again there is no need for a separate safety bolt. As can be recognized by comparing Figures 5 and 6 with Figures 7 and 8, the chain 12 in this case can be shortened by a minimum amount that, in fact, corresponds to the order of only twice the division t of the links. A minimum shortening on the order of twice the division or pitch t of the chain links can also be achieved in the case of the embodiment of the component according to Figures 9 through 12, in which the shortening organ 16 arranged at the lower end of a base body is formed as a retainer claw. 1.
