EXAMPLE 7
5-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-3-methyl-1-{2-oxo-2-[4-(2-oxo-1,4-dihydro-2H-quinazolin-3-yl)-piperidin-1-yl]-ethyl}-1H-pyrimidine-2,4-dione (reaction scheme 1, compound 7)
Similarly to example 1.8, starting from 217 mg (1.6 mmol) of 3-hydroxyphenylboronic acid and 150 mg (0.3 mmol) of 5-bromo-3-methyl-1-{2-oxo-2-[4-(2-oxo-1,4-dihydro-2H-quinazolin-3-yl)-piperidin-1-yl]-ethyl}-1H-pyrimidine-2,4-dione (prepared as described in example 2.5), 30 mg (20%) of 5-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-3-methyl-1-{2-oxo-2-[4-(2-oxo-1,4-dihydro-2H-quinazolin-3-yl)-piperidin-1-yl]-ethyl}-1H-pyrimidine-2,4-dione is obtained in the form of a grey solid.
