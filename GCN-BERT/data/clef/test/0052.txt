BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates generally to a window covering, and more particularly to an arched window covering capable of adjusting the size thereof. 2. Description of the Related Art Arched window coverings are designed for semi-circular windows. In early days, the arched window covering is simply a fan-shaped shade attached to the window by glue or double-sided adhesive tape. The shade usually is damaged when it is taken off from the window to wash or to replace. Nowadays, an improved arched window covering is provided, which includes a rail and a fan-shaped shade. The rail is mounted on the window, and the shade is detachably mounted on the rail without the damage problem when wash or replace. However, the sizes of the windows are variable, and the length of the rail must fit the window. The arched window covering with too short rail can't shade the entire window. Therefore, it has to prepare a rail longer than the usual window, and the rail is cut to fit the specific window when the worker installs the arched window covering on the window. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The primary objective of the present invention is to provide an arched window covering, which is able to adjust a size thereof to fit different windows.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION FIG. 1 and FIG. 2 show an arched window covering of the first preferred embodiment of the present invention, including a shade mount 100 and a fan-shaped shade 200. The shade 200 may be a honeycomb shade or a pleated shade. The present embodiment shows a honeycomb shade. The shade 200 is detachably mounted on the shade mount 100. As shown in FIGs. from FIG. 3 to FIG. 6, the shade mount 100 includes a base 10, a plurality of arched plates 20, so called spacers, and two rails 30. The base 10 includes two case pieces 11 for butt connection to form a hollow case with a vertical opening 12, so called inserting portion, at middle and two connecting portions 13, 14 at opposite sides. Each case piece 11 has two protrusions 11a , 11b for engagement. The engaged protrusions 11a, 11b form a semi-circular support portion S in the opening 12. As shown in FIG. 3, the support portion S connects the case pieces 11 and separate the opening 12 into two sub-openings 12A, 12B. The arched plates 20 have different lengths, and the shortest arched plate 20 may be fully attached to the support portion S, and the rest arched plates 20 are stacked on it in an order from the shortest one to the longest one. Each arched plate 20 (except the shortest one) is provided with protrusions 20a and slots 20b on opposite sides to engage the neighboring arched plate 20, and the arched plates 20 may easily disengage with each other as well. The shortest arched plate 20 only has the slots 20b on a top side. Therefore, the stack of the arched plates 20 has smooth bottom. The number of the arched plates 20 may change by removing the arched plate(s) 20 from the top of the stack. Each arched plate 20 has two stop portions 20c, 20d at opposite ends. The opposite ends of the arched plates 20 are inserted into the sub-openings 12A, 12B and extend out of the base 10. FIG. 6 shows eight arched plates 20 are stacked on the support portion S, and FIG. 7 shows six arched plates 20 are stacked on the support portion S. It is easy to tell that the overall diameter of the stack of eight arched plates 20 is wider than the stack of six arched plates 20. In other words, the maximum distance between the stop portions 20c, 20d (the distance between two proximal ends 30a of rails 30) in FIG. 7 is shorter than that in FIG. 6. Each arched plate 20 is provided with a plurality of shade slots 20e as shown in FIG. 4. The shade slots 20e are used to engage the shade 200. Each rail 30 is an elongated member with a U-shaped cross-section. Proximal ends 30a of the rails 30 movably engage the connecting portions 13, 14 of the base 10 and touch the stop portions 20c, 20d of the arched plates 20, and distal ends 30b of the rails 30 extend in opposite directions. Consequently, a distance between the distal ends 30b of the rails 30 in FIG. 6 is longer than that in FIG. 7. It is easy to understand that we can change a length of the shade mount 100, the distance between the distal ends 30b of the rails 30, by adding or removing the arched plate(s) 20 rather than cutting the rail, and that will in turn increase or decrease the area of the shade 200 mounted on the shade mount 100 to fit the windows with different sizes. As shown in FIG. 3 and FIG. 4, each case piece 11 is provided with a semi-circular board 40 at an outer side so that the arched plates 20 can hide behind the boards 40. The board 40 can include a first board 42 and a second board 41. The first board 42 can be inherently formed on the case piece 11, and the second board 41 detachably engages the first board 42 to form the semi-circular board 40. As shown in FIG. 8, a shade mount 100A of the second preferred embodiment of the present invention includes a base 50, a plurality of arched plates 53, so called spacers, and two rails 54. The base 50 consists of two case pieces to form a hollow case with an arched support portion at a center, and the rails 54 are two elongated members with U-shaped cross-sections. The base 50 has two inserting portions at opposite sides. Each inserting portion includes an opening 51 at a top of the base 50 and a plurality of parallel slots 52 on a bottom thereof. The arched plates 53 have different lengths to be stacked on the support portion in sequence. At each end of the arched plate 53 a stop portion 53b is formed. The stop portion 53b is a narrow piece to fit the openings 51. Two slots 53a are formed on opposite sides of the stop portion 53b. The stop portions 53b of each arched plate 53 are inserted into the openings 51 with the slots 53a engaging the corresponding slots 52 of the base 50. The same as the first preferred embodiment, the rails 54 connect to the connecting portions of the base 50 and touch the stop portions 53b of the arched plate 53. We can adjust the length of the shade mount 100A by adding or remove the arched plate(s) 53 to change the size of the shade. FIG. 9 shows a shade mount of the third preferred embodiment of the present invention, which is basically the same as the second preferred embodiment, except that a base 50′ has corresponding slots 51′ and 52 at a top and a bottom to engage each arched plates of different lengths. FIG. 10 shows a single flexible plate 60, the spacer, having a plurality of slots 61 along its longitudinally opposite sides. The plate 60 is bent to engage the slots 61 to the specified slots 52 on the base 50 of the shade mount 100A as shown in FIG. 8. As shown in FIG. 11, the plate 60 may be flexed to engage the slots 52 proximate to a center of the base 50, or may be extended to engage the slots 52 distal to the center of the base 50. The same as above, the rails connect to the base and touch the plate so that the length of the shade mount will decrease when the plate 60 engages the proximal slots 52, and will increase when the plate 60 engages the distal slots 52, and therefore, the size of the arched window covering changes, so as to fix different window sizes. FIG. 12 shows a shade mount of the fifth preferred embodiment of the present invention, including a base 70, a plurality of arched plates 72, and two rails 74. The base 70 has a support portion 76 and an inserting portion to engage the arched plates 72. As shown in FIG. 13, the inserting portion includes two sets of slots 78 on a top of the base 70 and on opposite sides of the support portion 76 to respectively engage slots (not shown) of the arched plates 72 like above embodiments. Because of the restraint of the slots 78 the shortest arched plates 72 does not touch the support portion 76, and there are small gaps between the neighboring arched plates 72. The base 70 has no opening or slot on the bottom, and ends of the arched plates 72 are received in the base 70. The base 70 further has two one-piece boards 80 to hide the arched plates 74. The rail 74, comparing with the rail 30 shown in FIG. 2, has an extra wall 82 under a pair of engaging portions 84 which engage the fan-shaped shade (not shown), and the wall 82 will touch the longest arched plates 72. The function of the shade mount of the fifth preferred embodiment is the same as above.
