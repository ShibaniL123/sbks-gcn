100 mg of (R,R)-6-benzyl-octahydro-pyrrolo[3,4-b]pyridine dihydrochloride was added into a 25-mL round-bottomed flask, and 2.00 mL of deionized water was added thereinto. After 55.8 mg of 6-chloro-7-deazapurine was added into the reaction mixture, 191 mg of potassium carbonate (K2CO3) was added into the reaction mixture, and the reaction mixture was refluxed for about 36 hours and then cooled at room temperature. The reaction mixture was extracted three times with 3.00 mL of dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) to collect an organic phase. The collected organic phase was concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was purified by flash column chromatography (MeOH:CH2Cl2=2:98). As a result, 93.6 mg of 4-((4aR,7aR)-6-benzyl-octahydro-1H-pyrrolo[3,4-b]pyridine-1-yl)-7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine was obtained with a yield of about 81.4%.
93.6 mg of 4-((4aR,7aR)-6-benzyl-octahydro-1H-pyrrolo[3,4-b]pyridine-1-yl)-7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine was added to a 25-mL round-bottomed flask and then dissolved with 1.00 mL of methanol. After 40.0 mg of a 10w/w% palladium/carbon (Pd/C) was added thereinto, a hydrogen-containing balloon was installed on the reaction flask. The reaction mixture was vigorously stirred for about 24 hours, and then filtered through a Celite™ 545 filter agent. The resulting filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting fraction was concentrated under reduced pressure and then further under vacuum. As a result, 60.1 mg of 4-((4aR,7aR)-octahydro-1H-pyrrolo[3,4-b]pyridine-1-yl)-7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine was obtained with a yield of about 88.4%.
60.1 mg of 4-((4aR,7aR)-octahydro-1H-pyrrolo[3,4-b]pyridine-1-yl)-7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine was added to a 5-mL round-bottomed flask, and then dissolved with 1.50 mL of n-butanol. After 0.237 mL of ethyl cyanoacetate was added into the solution, the reaction mixture was treated with 0.0169 mL of 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU) and then heated at about 80°C for about 24 hours. After termination of the reaction, the reaction solution was distilled under reduced pressure to remove the solvent. The resulting residue was purified by flash column chromatography (MeOH:CH2Cl2=2:98). The resulting fraction was concentrated under reduced pressure and then further under vacuum. As a result, 50.0 mg of 3-((4aR,7aR)-1-(7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine-4-yl)octahydro-6H-pyrrolo[3,4-b]pyridine-6-yl)-3-oxopropanenitrile was obtained with a yield of about 63.3%.
