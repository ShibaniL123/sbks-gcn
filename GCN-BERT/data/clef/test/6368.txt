Step 3. tert-Butyl 5-(4-((tert-butoxycarbonyl(methyl)amino)methyl)-2-fluoro-6-methylphenyl)-6-cyano-3-iodo-H-pyrazolo[4,3-b]pyridine-1-carboxylate
To a solution of tert-butyl (4-(6-cyano-1H-pyrazolo[4,3-b]pyridin-5-yl)-3-fluoro-5-methylbenzyl)(methyl)carbamate (252.3 mg, 0.638 mmol) in DMF (6.0 ml) was added N-iodosuccinimide (201.2 mg, 0.894 mmol). The mixture was stirred at 80Â° C. for 2 h. After cooling to room temperature, Boc-anhydride (208.6 mg, 0.956 mmol) was added followed by DMAP (28.5 mg, 0.233 mmol). The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 30 min, and then concentrated. The residue was purified on silica gel (40 g, 0-100% EtOAc in hexanes) to give the desired product as a yellow foamy solid (269.3 mg, 68%).
