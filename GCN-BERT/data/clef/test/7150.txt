BACKGROUND Cancers of the brain and nervous system are among the most difficult to treat. Prognosis for patients with these cancers depends on the type and location of the tumor as well as its stage of development. For many types of brain cancer, average life expectancy after symptom onset may be months or a year or two. Treatment consists primarily of surgical removal and radiation therapy; chemotherapy is also used, but the range of suitable chemotherapeutic agents is limited, perhaps because most therapeutic agents do not penetrate the blood-brain barrier adequately to treat brain tumors. Using known chemotherapeutics along with surgery and radiation rarely extends survival much beyond that produced by surgery and radiation alone. Thus improved therapeutic options are needed for brain tumors. Gliomas are a common type of brain tumor. They arise from the supportive neuronal tissue comprised of glial cells (hence the name glioma), which maintain the position and function of neurons. Gliomas are classified according to the type of glial cells they resemble: astrocytomas (including glioblastomas) resemble star-shaped astrocyte glial cells, oligodendrogliomas resemble oligodendrocyte glial cells; and ependymomas resemble ependymal glial cells that form the lining of fluid cavities in the brain. In some cases, a tumor may contain a mixture of these cell types, and would be referred to as a mixed glioma. The typical current treatment for brain cancers is surgical removal of the majority of the tumor tissue, which may be done by invasive surgery or using biopsy or extractive methods. Gliomas tend to disseminate irregularly, though, and are very difficult to remove completely. As a result, recurrence nearly always occurs soon after tumor removal. Radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy can be used in combination with surgical removal, but these generally provide only modest extension of survival time. For example, recent statistics showed that only about half of patients in the U.S. who are diagnosed with glioblastoma are alive one year after diagnosis, and only about 25% are still alive after two years, even when treated with the current standard of care combination treatments. Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common adult primary brain tumor and is notorious for its lethality and lack of responsiveness to current treatment approaches. Unfortunately, there have been no substantial improvements in treatment options in recent years, and minimal improvements in the survival prospects for patients with GBM. Thus there remains an urgent need for improved treatments for cancers of the brain such as gliomas. Gliomas develop in a complex tissue microenvironment comprised of many different types of cells in the brain parenchyma in addition to the cancer cells themselves. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are one of the prominent stromal cell types present, and often account for a substantial portion of the cells in the tumor tissues. Their origin is not certain: these TAMs may originate either from microglia, the resident macrophage population in the brain, or they may be recruited from the periphery. TAMs can modulate tumor initiation and progression in a tissue-specific manner: they appear to suppress cancer development in some cases, but they enhance tumor progression in the majority of studies to date. Indeed, in approximately 80% of the cancers in which there is increased macrophage infiltration, the elevated TAM levels are associated with more aggressive disease and poor patient prognosis. Several studies have shown that human gliomas also exhibit a significant increase in TAM numbers, which correlates with advanced tumor grade, and TAMs are typically the predominant immune cell type in gliomas. However, the function of TAMs in gliomagenesis remains poorly understood, and it is currently not known whether targeting of these cells represents a viable therapeutic strategy. In fact, opposing effects on tumor growth have been reported in the literature, in some cases even where a similar experimental strategy was used to deplete macrophages in the same orthotopic glioma implantation model. In some studies, TNF-α or integrin β3 produced by TAMs have been implicated in the suppression of glioma growth, whereas in other reports CCL2 and MT1-MMP have been proposed as enhancers of tumor development and invasion. Inhibition of CSF-1R signaling represents a novel, translationally relevant approach that has been used in several oncological contexts, including xenograft intratibial bone tumors. However, it has not yet been shown to be effective in brain tumors. Some non-brain cancers have been targeted with compounds that affect a variety of cell types that are associated with, or support, tumor cells rather than directly targeting the tumor cells themselves. For example, PLX3397 is reported to co-inhibit three targets (FMS, Kit, and Flt3-ITD) and to down-modulate various cell types including macrophages, microglia, osteoclasts, and mast cells. PLX3397 has been tested for treating Hodgkin's lymphoma. However, Hodgkin's lymphoma responds well to various chemotherapeutics, according to the PLX3397 literature, while brain tumors are much more resistant to chemotherapeutics and have not been successfully treated. As demonstrated herein, a CSF-1R inhibitor had no direct effect on proliferation of glioblastoma cells in culture, though, and it did not reduce numbers of macrophage cells in tumors of treated animals. It is thus surprising that, as also demonstrated herein, a CSF-1R inhibitor can effectively inhibit growth of brain tumors in vivo, cause reduction in tumor volume in advanced stage GBM, and even apparently eradicating some glioblastomas. SUMMARY OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION The present invention is based on demonstrations that brain tumors, particularly glioblastoma, can be treated with an inhibitor of CSF-1R. The effectiveness of the CSF-1R inhibitors described herein is believed to be due to their inhibition of certain activities of TAMs, even though it does not appear to significantly reduce the number of TAMs present, and is likely also a function of the demonstrated ability of these compounds to penetrate the blood-brain barrier effectively in subjects with a brain tumor. These methods provide much needed new therapeutic options for patients diagnosed with brain tumors, particularly glioblastomas. Colony stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1), also termed macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF), signals through its receptor CSF-1R (also known as c-FMS) to regulate the differentiation, proliferation, recruitment and survival of macrophages. Small molecule inhibitors of CSF-1R have been developed that block receptor phosphorylation by competing for ATP binding in the active site, as for other receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors. The present invention uses a potent, selective CSF-1R inhibitor, which penetrates the blood-brain barrier (BBB), to block CSF-1R signaling in glioma as illustrated in the RCAS-PDGF-B-HA/Nestin-Tv-a;Ink4a/Arf−/−mouse model of gliomagenesis. This genetically engineered glioma model is ideal for preclinical testing as a model for human GBM, as it recapitulates all features of human GBM in an immunocompetent setting. Because it closely models human GBM, and proneural GBM in particular, efficacy in this model is expected to translate into clinical efficacy on human glioblastomas such as glioblastoma multiforme and mixed gliomas. The invention can be practiced with any inhibitor of CSF-1R capable of penetrating the brain. Some such compounds are the 6-O-substituted benzoxazole and benzothiazole compounds disclosed in WO2007/121484, particularly the compounds of Formula IIa and IIb in that reference, and the compounds disclosed herein. In one aspect, the invention provides a method to treat a brain tumor in a mammalian subject, comprising administering to the subject an effective amount of a compound of Formula (I): wherein R1 is an alkyl pyrazole or an alkyl carboxamide; and R2 is a hydroxycycloalkyl;or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. The method can be used to treat a patient, frequently a human subject, who has been diagnosed with a brain tumor. Further embodiments of the invention are described below.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION The invention provides compounds of Formula (I) for use to treat brain tumors, and methods of using compounds of Formula (I) for the treatment of brain tumors. The compounds of Formula (I) have this formula: wherein R1 is an alkyl pyrazole or an alkyl carboxamide; and R2 is a hydroxycycloalkyl; and include pharmaceutically acceptable salts as well as neutral compounds of this formula. Specific compounds within the scope of the invention are further described below. The treatment of a brain tumor can include inhibition of the rate of growth of a brain tumor (slowing tumor growth), or reversal of growth of a brain tumor (i.e., reduction in tumor volume), or substantial elimination of the tumor, which has been demonstrated by the treatment herein of mice having such tumors. In particular, the treatment can slow progression or reverse progression of a glioblastoma. It may be used in conjunction with other treatments including removal of the bulk of a brain tumor, and may be used to slow or reverse regrowth or to reduce the volume or mass of residual tumorous tissue following brain tumor removal by surgical or biopsy methods. The compounds may also be used in conjunction with other chemotherapeutics. The compounds of formula (I) include compounds wherein R1 is an alkyl-substituted pyrazole or carboxamide, e.g., a C1-C4 alkyl pyrazole or a carboxamide of the formula —C(O)NHR, where R is a C1-C4 alkyl group. In preferred embodiments, the alkyl group is Me or Et. Certain preferred compounds for use in the invention are disclosed below. In some embodiments of these methods, R1 is wherein R′ is Me or Et. Preferably, the pyrazole ring is attached at position 4, i.e.: In these compounds, R2 can be a hydroxycyclohexyl group such as this: or a 2-hydroxycyclopent-1-yl group. Specifically preferred compounds include any of the following compounds, or a mixture of any two or more of these compounds, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of any one of these: Each of these compounds and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts are preferred embodiments for purposes of the present invention. Preferred embodiments of these compounds also include compounds of these formulas: where R′ is Me, Et or Propyl, preferably methyl. Specific embodiments of these compounds can be of (R,R) absolute stereochemistry or (S,S) absolute stereochemistry. These compounds are expected to exhibit blood-brain barrier penetration like BLZ945, based on their very similar physicochemical properties, and are therefore suitable for use in the present treatment methods. Compounds of Formula (I) are known in the art, and methods for making them are disclosed, for example, in WO2007/121484; their usefulness to treat glioma and their penetration of the blood-brain barrier were not previously known. Compound (1c) corresponds to BLZ945, which was utilized for in vitro and in vivo tests described herein. Compounds of Formula (Ih) having the (1S,2S) stereochemstry at the cyclohexyl ring are novel. These compounds are unexpectedly good inhibitors of PDGFRβ while also inhibiting CSF-1R very effectively (see data herein). Accordingly, the novel compounds of this formula where R′ is Me, Et or Propyl are another aspect of the present invention that provide a dual-inhibitor effect that is expected to increase effectiveness in the treatment methods disclosed herein. The compounds can be used alone or they can be formulated into a pharmaceutical composition that also contains at least one pharmaceutically acceptable excipient, and often contains at least two pharmaceutically acceptable excipients. It will be understood that pharmaceutically acceptable excipients are typically sterilized. Some suitable excipients are disclosed herein; in some embodiments, the compound is formulated as a composition comprising captisol, e.g, 20% captisol. In some embodiments, the brain tumor is selected from a brain metastasis, an astrocytoma (including glioblastoma), an oligodendroglioma, an ependymomas, and a mixed glioma. In preferred embodiments, the brain tumor is a glioma, particularly glioblastoma multiforme. In other embodiments, the brain tumor is a brain metastasis, i.e., a metastatic tumor arising from a cancer that originated elsewhere in the body. In some embodiments, the patient is one having glioblastoma. In specific embodiments, the subject is one diagnosed with proneural glioblastoma. See Verhaak, et al., Cancer Cell 17(1):98-110 (2010). This subtype of glioblastoma tends to occur in younger subjects and to involve mutations of TP53, IDH1 and PDGFRA. Verhaak, et al. reported that patients with proneural glioblastoma were less responsive than other subtypes (classical, neural, mesenchymal) to the aggressive chemotherapies in use in 2010, and even suggested that such treatment may be contraindicated for these patients. The present methods are especially effective to treat proneural glioblastoma, as demonstrated by the proneural GBM animal model used herein. Specific genetic signatures found in TAMs in mice treated with BLZ945 were found to match those of human proneural glioblastoma patients who had longer than average median survival times; this correlation did not occur when compared with patients having other subtypes of glioblastoma. Thus the genetic signature information can be used to select patients for treatment with a CSF-1R inhibitor as described herein, or to assess prognosis for a subject receiving such treatments. In some embodiments, the method is used to treat a subject before other treatment methods such as tumor removal. In other embodiments, the method is used to treat a subject in conjunction with other treatment methods such as tumor removal by either surgical or biopsy methods, or in conjunction with radiation therapy, or in conjunction with both tumor removal and radiation therapy. Optionally, other chemotherapeutic agents can be used along with the compounds and methods disclosed above. Suitable additional chemotherapeutic agents for use in these methods are those known in the art as conventional ones for use in treating glioblastoma. Some such chemotherapeutics include antiangiogenic agents, bevacizumab with or without irinotecan, nitrosoureas such as Carmustine (BCNU), platins such as cis-platinum (cisplatin), alkylating agents such as temozolomide, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (gefitinib or erlotinib), Ukrain, and cannabinoids. These additional therapeutic agents (co-therapeutics) can be used simultaneously with the CSF-1R inhibitor as by concurrent administration, admixing the cotherapeutic with the CSF-1R inhibitor, or by sequential administration. A preferred embodiment involves use of a compound selected from those of Formula I disclosed herein, (e.g., Formula Ia,Ib, Ic, Id, Ie, If, Ig or Ih) in combination with temozolomide or a platin compound. In addition, macrophages have been implicated in reduced therapeutic responses in breast cancer and increased revascularization in glioblastoma xenografts following radiation therapy. Since these macrophage effects reduce the efficacy of other therapies, compounds of the invention, which inhibit macrophage activities in glioblastoma in vivo, may be expected to provide a synergistic effect when used in combination with other therapeutic agents or radiation therapy. In some embodiments, the methods described herein are practiced with a compound of Formula (Ic). In other embodiments, the methods may be practiced with a compound of Formula (I) that is not the compound of Formula (Ic), such as the other species disclosed herein. In some embodiments, the compound of Formula (I) also inhibits at least one other target to provide enhanced antitumor effects. For example, compounds of these formulas: also inhibit PDGFR at concentrations achieved in typical therapeutic dosages such as those described herein. Accordingly, these compounds can be used where a dual mechanism of action is desired, and can be used in any of the methods described above. Exemplary compounds of Formula Ig and Ih are included in the following table to illustrate the relative activities on CSF-1R and PDGFR. Many such compounds are known in the art, see WO2007/066898, and methods to make these compounds are also well known. The compounds of Formula I are quite active on CSF-1R regardless of the stereochemistry at the cyclohexyl ring as shown in the table below. Among the various isomers, the S,S isomers are also highly active on PDGFR-β as well as on CSF-1R, and thus may act on gliomas by two mechanisms to provide enhanced efficacy.

As used herein, the terms “salt” or “salts” refers to an acid addition or base addition salt of a compound of the invention. “Salts” include in particular “pharmaceutically acceptable salts”. The term “pharmaceutically acceptable salts” refers to salts that retain the biological effectiveness and properties of the compounds of this invention and, which typically are not biologically or otherwise undesirable. Pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts can be formed with inorganic acids and organic acids, e.g., acetate, aspartate, benzoate, besylate, bromide/hydrobromide, bicarbonate/carbonate, bisulfate/sulfate, camphorsulfonate, chloride/hydrochloride, chlortheophyllonate, citrate, ethandisulfonate, fumarate, gluceptate, gluconate, glucuronate, hippurate, hydroiodide/iodide, isethionate, lactate, lactobionate, laurylsulfate, malate, maleate, malonate, mandelate, mesylate, methylsulphate, naphthoate, napsylate, nicotinate, nitrate, octadecanoate, oleate, oxalate, palmitate, pamoate, phosphate/hydrogen phosphate/dihydrogen phosphate, polygalacturonate, propionate, stearate, succinate, sulfosalicylate, tartrate, tosylate and trifluoroacetate salts. Inorganic acids from which salts can be derived include, for example, hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, and the like. Organic acids from which salts can be derived include, for example, acetic acid, propionic acid, glycolic acid, oxalic acid, maleic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, fumaric acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, benzoic acid, mandelic acid, methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, toluenesulfonic acid, sulfosalicylic acid, and the like. Pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salts can be formed with inorganic and organic bases. Inorganic bases from which salts can be derived include, for example, ammonium salts and metals from columns Ito XII of the periodic table. In certain embodiments, the salts are derived from sodium, potassium, ammonium, calcium, magnesium, iron, silver, zinc, and copper; particularly suitable salts include ammonium, potassium, sodium, calcium and magnesium salts. Organic bases from which salts can be derived include, for example, primary, secondary, and tertiary amines, substituted amines including naturally occurring substituted amines, cyclic amines, basic ion exchange resins, and the like. Certain organic amines include isopropylamine, benzathine, cholinate, diethanolamine, diethylamine, lysine, meglumine, piperazine and tromethamine. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the present invention can be prepared by conventional chemical methods. Generally, such salts can be prepared by reacting free acid forms of these compounds with a stoichiometric amount of the appropriate base (such as Na, Ca, Mg, or K hydroxide, carbonate, bicarbonate or the like), or by reacting free base forms of these compounds with a stoichiometric amount of the appropriate acid. Such reactions are typically carried out in water or in an organic solvent, or in a mixture of the two. Generally, use of non-aqueous media like ether, ethyl acetate, ethanol, isopropanol, or acetonitrile is desirable, where practicable. Lists of additional suitable salts can be found, e.g., in REMINGTON'S PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES, 20th ed., Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa., (1985); and in HANDBOOK OF PHARMACEUTICAL SALTS: PROPERTIES, SELECTION, AND USE by Stahl and Wermuth (Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, Germany, 2002). Any formula given herein is intended to represent unlabeled forms as well as isotopically labeled forms of the compounds. Isotopically labeled compounds have structures depicted by the formulas given herein except that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having a selected atomic mass or mass number. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorous, fluorine, and chlorine, such as 2H, 3H, 11C, 13C, 14C, 15N, 18F 31P, 32P, 35S, 36Cl, 125I respectively. I n preferred embodiments, the compounds of the invention are unlabeled, i.e., they comprise approximately natural isotope abundances for all atoms. In other embodiments, the compounds of the invention are labeled by selective incorporation of an enriched non-natural isotope for one atom in the compound of Formula (I). The invention includes various isotopically labeled compounds as defined herein, for example those into which radioactive isotopes, such as 3H and 14C, or those into which non-radioactive isotopes, such as 2H and 13C are present. Such isotopically labelled compounds are useful in metabolic studies (with 14C), reaction kinetic studies (with, for example 2H or 3H), detection or imaging techniques, such as positron emission tomography (PET) or single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) including drug or substrate tissue distribution assays, or in radioactive treatment of patients. In particular, an 18F or labeled compound may be particularly desirable for PET or SPECT studies. Isotopically-labeled compounds of formula (I) can generally be prepared by conventional techniques known to those skilled in the art in view of the description of synthesis of the compounds of Formula I in, for example, U.S. patent publication no. US200810045528 (WO2007/121484). BLZ945 is described in that reference as well as several of its isomers. Examples 173 and 174 in that reference describe synthesis of pyrazole compound (Ie) using 1R,2R-aminocyclohexanol, and can be adapted for synthesis of other pyrazole compounds of Formula I, both labeled and unlabeled. The same publication at page 163 describes synthesis of both 1R,2R-and 1S,2S-aminocyclohexanol, which can readily be substituted into the method of Example 173 to produce (If) and other compounds of Formula I, both labeled and unlabeled. Further, substitution with heavier isotopes, particularly deuterium (i.e., 2H or D) may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements or an improvement in therapeutic index. It is understood that deuterium in this context is regarded as a substituent of a compound of the formula (I). The concentration of such a heavier isotope, specifically deuterium, may be defined by the isotopic enrichment factor. The term “isotopic enrichment factor” as used herein means the ratio between the isotopic abundance and the natural abundance of a specified isotope. If a substituent in a compound of this invention is denoted deuterium, such compound has an isotopic enrichment factor for each designated deuterium atom of at least 3500 (52.5% deuterium incorporation at each designated deuterium atom), at least 4000 (60% deuterium incorporation), at least 4500 (67.5% deuterium incorporation), at least 5000 (75% deuterium incorporation), at least 5500 (82.5% deuterium incorporation), at least 6000 (90% deuterium incorporation), at least 6333.3 (95% deuterium incorporation), at least 6466.7 (97% deuterium incorporation), at least 6600 (99% deuterium incorporation), or at least 6633.3 (99.5% deuterium incorporation). As used herein, the term “pharmaceutically acceptable excipients” includes any and all solvents, dispersion media, coatings, surfactants, antioxidants, preservatives (e.g., antibacterial agents, antifungal agents), isotonic agents, absorption delaying agents, salts, preservatives, drug stabilizers, binders, excipients, disintegration agents, lubricants, sweetening agents, flavoring agents, dyes, and the like and combinations thereof, as would be known to those skilled in the art (see, for example, Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th Ed. Mack Printing Company, 1990, pp. 1289-1329). Except insofar as any conventional carrier is incompatible with the active ingredient, its use in the therapeutic or pharmaceutical compositions is contemplated.

EXAMPLES Compounds of the invention were prepared according to methods known in the art, particularly those described in WO2007/121484. The compounds and/or intermediates were characterized by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a Waters Millenium chromatography system with a 2695 Separation Module (Milford, Mass.). The analytical columns were reversed phase Phenomenex Luna C18-5, 4.6×50 mm, from Alltech (Deerfield, Ill.). A gradient elution was used (flow 2.5 mL/min), typically starting with 5% acetonitrile/95% water and progressing to 100% acetonitrile over a period of 10 minutes. All solvents contained 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). Compounds were detected by ultraviolet light (UV) absorption at either 220 or 254 nm. HPLC solvents were from Burdick and Jackson (Muskegan, Mich.), or Fisher Scientific (Pittsburgh, Pa.). Mass spectrometric analysis was performed on one of two LCMS instruments: a Waters System (Alliance HT HPLC and a Micromass ZQ mass spectrometer; Column: Eclipse XDB-C18, 2.1×50 mm; gradient: 5-95% (or 35-95%, or 65-95% or 95-95%) acetonitrile in water with 0.05% TFA over a 4 min period; flow rate 0.8 mL/min; molecular weight range 200-1500; cone Voltage 20 V; column temperature 40° C.) or a Hewlett Packard System (Series 1100 HPLC; Column: Eclipse XDB-C18, 2.1×50 mm; gradient: 5-95% acetonitrile in water with 0.05% TFA over a 4 min period ; flow rate 0.8 mL/min; molecular weight range 150-850; cone Voltage 50 V; column temperature 30° C.). All masses were reported as those of the protonated parent ions. Analytical Data for Compound (If): HPLC retention time 1.93 min. Molecular Ion (MH+): m/z=422.1 (LC/MS RT=0.50 min). Example 1 Macrophage Numbers are Increased in a Mouse Model of Gliomagenesis Compared to Normal Brain This example demonstrated the contribution of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) to gliomagenesis in the RCAS-PDGF-B-HA/INestin-Tv-a;Ink4a/Arf−/−mouse model. In these mice, when tumor development is induced in adults, the vast majority of lesions that develop are high-grade glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), which histologically models human GBM. FIG. 1. (A) Cerebrum/forebrain from uninjected Nestin-Tv-a;Ink4a/Arf−/− mice (normal brain) or grade IV tumors (GBM) from symptomatic RCAS-PDGF-B-HA/Nestin-Tv-a;Ink4a/Arf−/− (PDG) mice were processed to a single cell suspension with papain for flow cytometry (n=5 each). There was a significant increase in CD45+ leukocytes from 3.6±0.6% to 13.1±2.0%. CD11b+ myeloid cells/macrophages accounted for the overwhelming majority of leukocytes (89.9-98.5% of CD45+ cells), with a 3.8-fold increase in CD45+ CD11b+ cells in the tumors (12.7±2.0%) compared to normal brain (3.3±0.5%), and no differences in the populations of CD45+CD11b-cells. (B) Normal brain or GBM tissue sections from symptomatic PDG mice were immunofluorescently co-stained for CSF-1R, CD68 (macrophages), and DAPI. (C) Normal brain and GBM tumors (n=3 each) were used for RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis, and qPCR. Assays were run in triplicate and expression normalized to ubiquitin C (Ubc) for each sample. Expression is depicted relative to normal brain. (D) Normal brain or GBM tissue sections from symptomatic PDG mice were stained for CSF-1R in combination with the macrophage markers F4/80 and CD11b as well as F4/80, CD11b, and CD68 in combination with Iba-1 (macrophages/microglia). DAPI was used for the nuclear counterstain. Scale bar, 50 μm. Data are presented as mean+SEM. P values were obtained using unpaired two-tailed Student's t-test; *P<0.05; **P<0.01. Numbers of macrophage cells were substantially higher in GBM tissue relative to normal brain, as shown by staining with the macrophage-specific antibody CD68 (FIG. 1B). This was confirmed by flow cytometry analysis, in which tumor-associated leukocytes (CD45+) constitute 13.1% of the tumor mass, and the vast majority are macrophages (CD11 b+) (FIG. 1A). Expression analysis of normal brain compared to GBM revealed that the mRNA level of CSF-1 and CSF-1R, as well as CD68, increases in tumors (FIG. 1C). The different cell type-specific populations were also from GBMs to determine the source of CSF-1 and its receptor. The purity of the distinct populations was confirmed by expression of the TVA receptor only in the tumor cell fraction and CD11b solely in the TAMs. While CSF-1 was expressed by both tumor cells and TAMs, CSF-1R was only expressed by TAMs (FIG. 1D). The first column in each group of three in FIG. 1D is Mixed cells, the second is FACS-purified tumor cells, and the third is FACS-purified TAMs; Mixed cells are set to 1 to normalize the data. The graphs show no CD11b expression in tumor cells and no CSF-1R expression in tumor cells, while TVA stains tumor cells only, not TAMs, and CSF-1 is present in approximately equal amounts in both tumor and TAM cells. These findings were confirmed by immunostaining, and all CSF-1R+ cells were also positive for CD68 (not shown). This demonstrates that any effects on tumorigenesis following CSF-1R inhibition in this model are macrophage dependent. Example 2 Analysis of the CSF-1R Inhibitor BLZ945: Pharmacokinetics and Cell-Based Assays. BLZ945 (Compound Ic) has been disclosed as a selective c-fms (CSF-1R) kinase inhibitor for the suppression of tumor-induced osteolytic lesions in bone. BLZ945 is an ATP competitive inhibitor that inhibits CSF-1R in biochemical assays at 1 nM, and inhibits CSF-dependent cell proliferation at an IC-50 of about 67 nM. By comparison, the IC50 values for most of >200 miscellaneous kinases tested are >10 μM (10,000 nM), and for cKIT and PDGFRf3 the IC-50's are 3.5 μM (3500 nM) and 5.9 μM (5900 nM) respectively. When screened against several hundred kinases in the Ambit® kinase array, the compound showed activity lower than 50% of control only against CSF-1R, PDGFRa and PDGFRβ, and the activity on the two PDGFRs was far lower than its activity on CSF-1R in direct inhibition assays. As discussed herein, compounds like BLZ945 but having the (S,S) stereochemistry exhibit activity against PDGFRβ at levels similar to their high level of activity on CSF-1R. Mice having GBM detectable in only the right half of their brains were treated with BLZ945, and the concentration of compound in plasma, and in the right and left halves of the brain were then measured at various time points (15 mins, 2 hr, 8 hr, 24 hr). As FIG. 2 shows, the plasma concentration rises rapidly to a little over 100 uM and remains above 50 uM at 8 hr, then declines to a low level by 24 hr. The concentration in brain tissue follows a similar pattern: it remains a little lower than the plasma level, but rises well above 50 uM at the 15 min and 2 hr time points. This shows that BLZ945 crosses the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and that concentrations sufficient to inhibit macrophage growth and/or survival can be achieved in the brain. It also shows that the compound penetrates at similar levels into tumor-containing and tumor-free halves of the brain, suggesting that penetration may not depend on a lesion in the BBB caused by the presence of the tumor. This demonstrates sufficiently rapid penetration of the blood-brain barrier to provide therapeutically effective drug levels in the brain, well above the levels needed to effectively inhibit macrophages in culture. Example 3 Inhibitory Activity of BLZ945 Against Different Cell Types in Vitro Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were isolated and differentiated as previously described in the literature, and were then treated with 67 nM BLZ945. BLZ945 caused a clear inhibition of CSF-1R phosphorylation following CSF-1 stimulation (FIG. 3A) at each time point (1.5 min, 3 min, 5 min). The effects of BLZ945 on macrophages were also examined: a range of doses, from 67 nM to 6700 nM dramatically blocked macrophage survival, comparable to the effects of CSF-1 withdrawal (FIG. 3B). BMDMs from Ink4a/Arf null mice (the genetic background of the GBM model), were also tested in the presence and absence of BLZ945. FIG. 3C shows that these BMDMs, like those from the wild-type mice, were substantially inhibited by concentrations of BLZ945 of 67 nM and above (FIG. 3D). Thus, BLZ945 is an effective inhibitor of CSF-1R signaling, which leads to a complete block in macrophage viability. FIGS. 3C-3E demonstrate that proliferation of BMDM cells from the Ink4a/Arf−/− mice as strongly inhibited at concentrations of BLZ945 of 67 nM and above, as were CRL-2467 cells (normal mouse brain), while even at 6700 nM it has little or no effect on proliferation of four mouse and one human glioblastoma cell cultures To determine the lack of a direct effect of BLZ945 on tumor cells, a human glioma cell line and a series of primary tumor cells and neurospheres were treated with BLZ945 at similar concentrations to those found effective against macrophage growth. U87-MG cells, derived from a human GBM, which have been shown to be dependent on PDGFR signaling in culture and in vivo, were not affected by BLZ945 treatment at the same doses as above (FIG. 3E). Similarly, the formation of secondary neurospheres from primary neurospheres (derived from mouse RCAS-PDGF-B-HA/Nestin-Tv-a;Ink4a/Arf−/−GBMs) was not altered by BLZ945 treatment (FIG. 3F). Neither the number nor the size of neurospheres were significantly affected by BLZ945. Finally, the effects of BLZ945 on multiple tumor cell lines that were established from secondary mouse GBM neurospheres were examined, and again, there were no differences (FIG. 3F). Collectively, these experiments demonstrate that the effects of CSF-1R inhibition by BLZ945 are specific to macrophages, with no discernible direct consequences on tumor cells. Example 4 Treatment With the CSF-1R Inhibitor BLZ945 Blocks Glioma Progression Given the potent inhibitory effects of BLZ945 in macrophage cell-based assays, and its demonstrated ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, it appeared desirable to test this inhibitor in preclinical trials in the RCAS-PDGF-B-HA/INestin-Tv-a;Ink4a/Arf−/− model. These genetically engineered mice were injected at 5-6 weeks of age with RCAS-PDGF-B-HA virus-infected DF-1 cells to initiate glioma formation as described (Hambardzumyan, et al., Transl. Oncol., vol. 2, 89-95 (2009). At 2.5 weeks following tumor initiation, cohorts of mice were dosed via oral gavage daily with either 200 mg/kg BLZ945 in 20% captisol, or the vehicle (20% captisol) as a control. The mice were subsequently evaluated for symptom-free survival. The median survival in the vehicle treated cohort was 5.71 weeks (40 days), whereas 64.4% of the BLZ945 treated cohort were still alive at the trial endpoint of 26 weeks post-injection (31-32 weeks of age) (FIG. 4A, P<0.0001). This endpoint was chosen because mice in the Ink4a/Arf−/− background start developing spontaneous tumors, mostly lymphomas and sarcomas, around 30 weeks of age, which would complicate interpretation of the glioma phenotype in longer studies. The data in FIG. 4A shows that none of the control mice (vehicle only) were symptom free by 8 weeks after virus injection, while over half of the treated mice were symptom free at the endpoint of 26 weeks. Note: 4 treated mice were sacrificed at 12 weeks for histology studies. Of these, 3 were tumor free, and one had a grade II glioma. Tumor Grades were determined for the mice in both cohorts of mice (see FIG. 4B). All vehicle-treated mice at end stage had high-grade tumors, with Grade IV GBM lesions in 13 of 14 mice. In contrast, the BLZ945 treated animals had significantly less malignant tumors:80% were either Grade II or tumor free; the remaining 20% had Grade III tumor. In 56% of the mice alive at the 26-week trial endpoint, there were no detectable lesions (FIG. 4B). Five of the BLZ945 treated mice were sacrificed as symptomatic during the trial (n=5), and compared to the group that were still asymptomatic when sacrificed at the end of the trial (n=9). In both groups, there was still a significant decrease in tumor grade compared to the vehicle-treated animals. This shows a dramatic increase in survival and reduction in tumor malignancy in this long-term trial with BLZ945 treatment. Example 5 MRI Imaging to Monitor Effects of BLZ945 on Tumor Growth A short-term, 7 day trial of BLZ945 in tumor-induced mice was monitored by regular MRI scans to measure tumor size changes during a short treatment period when tumor growth is normally rapid. Tumor volume in the RCAS-PDGF-B-HA/Nestin-Tv-a;Ink4a/Arf−/− mice was determined by MRI, and mice were added to the trial when this was at least 4.5 mm3 or greater. Mice were treated with BLZ945 or the vehicle control for 7 days, as described above. MRI scans were performed on the day before treatment was initiated, at the mid-point of the treatment, and at the day before the end of the trial period. Vehicle-treated mice showed a progressive, dramatic increase in tumor volume over this short trial, as shown in FIG. 5A, with the average tumor volume increasing about 5-fold. BLZ945 treatment blocked tumor progression as determined by MRI (FIG. 5A), with no increase in tumor size over the same short period. Treated subjects, (lower line) showed little or no tumor enlargement, while tumor volume increased sharply in the vehicle-treated controls. FIG. 5B shows tumor volume for individual control mice (upper graph) and treated mice (lower graph) during the first 6 days after dosing with BLZ945 started. Nearly all of the BLZ945 treated animals show little or no increase in tumor size, while all of the control animals show large increases in tumor volume. As shown in FIG. 5B, untreated tumors increased by about 150-850% in volume during this time, while tumor size was reduced in 7 of 11 treated animals and only two of the treated animals had tumor volume increases over 50%. FIGS. 5-2A and 5-2B depict the tumor volume data for all 11 test and control animals, and show that treatment largely stopped tumor size increases, while untreated tumors grew substantially in the 6-day treatment. These results indicate that CSF-1R signaling, and the presumed contribution of CSF-1R-dependent macrophages, is critical for glioma progression in this mouse model, and that BLZ945 can prevent growth of a brain tumor in a highly relevant mammalian model for human glioblastoma. In a second in vivo test on larger tumors in the same GBM model (“large tumor” cohort), mice with tumor volumes of 48.7 to 132 mm3 were treated with BLZ945, and changes in tumor volume were monitored by MRI over a span of 6 days. Tumor volume actually decreased in nearly all test animals, and 6 of 18 treated mice had a reduction of at least 30% in tumor size (FIGS. 5D and 5-2C). Control animals were not included in this test, because they would not have been expected to survive to the endpoint. Example 6 Analysis of Hallmark Capabilities of Cancer in BLZ945 Treated Tumors The identification of a striking effect of CSF-1R inhibition on gliomagenesis led us to investigate the underlying mechanisms for this response and determine how BLZ945 treatment affected several of the hallmark capabilities of cancer. The analyses were performed on tissues from the short-term trial (see Example 5), so that tumors from the different treatment groups could be compared at the same defined endpoint. Tumor cell density was examined using the oligodendrocyte marker Olig2, which has previously been used to identify glioma cells. Olig2 was significantly reduced in the BLZ945 treated group compared to the vehicle controls, showing that BLZ945 significantly reduced numbers of tumor cells. (FIG. 6A). Analysis of the proportion of Olig2+ cells that were proliferating, as determined by bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation, revealed a significant reduction in the BLZ945 group (FIG. 6B). Again, BLZ945 significantly reduced proliferation of tumor cells. The level of apoptosis in these cells was assessed, also. Apoptotic cells were counted as those that had cytoplasmic cleaved caspase-3 (CC3)+ staining and condensed nuclei. As shown in FIG. 6C, the CSF-1R inhibitor treatment caused an increase in apoptosis at the earlier time point in particular, although little staining was observed in the Day 7 large tumor cohort. The following table summarizes the histological analyses performed on the samples from Example 5: TABLE 1 Histologic analyses. BLZ945 BLZ945 BLZ945, BLZ945, Large, Large, Parameter Vehicle Day 3 Day 7 Day 3 Day 7 Tumor Volume +498% — 0.68% — −24.3% (Day −1 vs Day 6) Total DAPI+ Cells — −72% −80% −40% −65% Tumor Cells — −27% −77% −14% −73% (% Olig2+) Proliferation — −91% −67% −98% −94% (% BrdU+Olig2+) Apoptosis — +17-fold +6-fold +9-fold +2-fold (% CC3+) Vasculature — — −17% — −67% (CD31 MVD) Macrophages — +3-fold +2-fold +2-fold +4-fold (% CD68+) Phagocytic — +2.6-fold +3.0-fold +2.2-fold +4.1-fold Index Phagocytic — +11.5-fold +5.0-fold +7.1-fold +6.0-fold Capacity Tumor volume change is volume at endpoint (day 6) relative to day one, and the reported changes are relative to the control (vehicle) group. Together, these analyses demonstrate that inhibition of CSF-1R signaling effectively blocks the growth and malignancy of gliomas through a combined effect on reducing tumor cell proliferation and increasing cell death. In summary, these data demonstrate that the CSF-1R inhibitor BLZ945 is a potent new therapy that blocks tumor progression in a very aggressive glioma model in mice. The compound dramatically enhanced survival in a preclinical mouse model of gliomagenesis, and sharply reduced tumor growth rates and also reduced tumor size over a short and longer test period. In the long term test, BLZ945 appears to eliminate visible tumors in significant numbers of mice, and sharply reduces the tumor grade in most of the treated mice. Since increased macrophage infiltration has been shown to correlate with malignancy in human gliomas, the potency of BLZ945 in this mouse model, apparently due to therapeutic targeting of TAMs in subjects with GBM, is expected to translate into efficacy against glioblastoma in other mammals, including humans. Since myeloid cells, including macrophages, have been implicated in blunting chemotherapeutic response in breast cancer models and in enhancing the adaptive response following irradiation in GBM xenograft models, this and similar CSF-1R inhibitors may be effective in combination with therapies directed against the cancer cells in gliomas, a possibility that merits further investigation. In particular, compounds such as offer the ability to target CSF-1 R and PDGFR at similar concentrations, and thus may be even more effective than BLZ945. Indeed, compound (Id) inhibits PDGFR with an IC50 only about 4-fold higher than its IC50 for CSF-1R. Thus a therapeutically effective concentration of either of these compounds is expected to affect both target sites, and to exhibit synergistic activity on gliomas. Example 7 To investigate the molecular mechanisms whereby BLZ945-treated TAMs can elicit such a striking anti-tumor response in vivo, despite a lack of evident depletion of TAMs or any direct antiproliferative effect on human GBM cells, CD11b+Gr−1− TAMs were isolated from mice treated with vehicle or BLZ945, and microarray expression profiling was performed (see FIG. 7). Microarray analysis identified 257 genes as significantly differentially expressed between the groups: 52 genes were upregulated and 205 downregulated (FIGS. 7B; also 8A). Among these, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed that targets of Egr2, a transcription factor downstream of CSF-1R signaling, were downregulated in BLZ945 treated TAMs (FIG. 7C). Disproportionately, genes associated with M2 phase were upregulated (FIG. 7D and 7E). Example 8 Gene Expression Changes Induced by the CFR-1R Inhibitor Lasso regression modeling was employed to determine the minimal number of genes that best discriminated the two treatment groups. This identified a 5-gene signature for BLZ945 treatment comprised of adrenomedullin (Adm), arginase 1 (Arg1), the clotting factor F13a1, mannose receptor C type 1 (Mrc1/CD206), and the protease inhibitor serpinB2 (FIG. 8B). Interestingly, each of these genes has been associated with alternatively activated/ M2 macrophage polarization, and 4 of 5 genes are downregulated following BLZ945 treatment. SerpinB2 (also known as PAI2), the only upregulated gene in the 5-gene signature, generally correlates positively with increased survival, particularly in breast cancer patients. In many tissue contexts TAMs have been found to be more M2 polarized, which has been linked to their immunosuppressive and pro-tumorigenic functions. Further, macrophages in human gliomas exhibit an M2-like phenotype, determined by increased levels of the scavenger receptors CD163 and CD204, which are associated with higher tumor grade. Given the striking enrichment for M2 genes in the restricted 5-gene signature, the 257-gene list was examined to determine if there were additional M2-associated markers altered following BLZ945 treatment. This revealed 10 further genes [Alox15 (arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase); Cdh1 (cadherin); Cd163 (CD163 antigen); Fpr2 (formyl peptide receptor 2); Hmox1 (heme oxygenase (decycling) 1); il1b (interleukin 1 beta); and Stab1 (stabilin 1)], the majority of which were downregulated (FIG. 7D, table 2). Classically activated/ M1 polarization genes were not correspondingly upregulated, with the exception of interleukin-1-beta receptor (FIG. 7E). These data suggest that in response to CSF-1R inhibition by BLZ945, TAMs lose their M2 polarization and may gain anti-tumorigenic functions. This also suggests that monitoring these gene expression changes as biomarkers may provide valuable prognosis information for treatment of glioma patients with CSF-1R inhibitors. Treated subjects whose gene expression profiles change in the same or a similar pattern as these observed changes may be expected to respond positively to treatment with the CSF-1R inhibitor, and those who do not exhibit such gene expression changes may need to receive an alternative or additional treatment due to a negative prognosis on the CSF-1R inhibitor alone.

A support vector machine (SVM) and the Lasso signature were used to analyze GBM data from The Cancer Gene Atlas (TCGA) and a second combined series of GBM datasets and segregate patients into either ‘BLZ945’ or ‘Vehicle’ classifiers. These analyses revealed an increase in median survival ranging from 10 months in TCGA proneural patients using the Lasso signature (FIGS. 8C and 8D) to 31.5 months in the combined datasets with the SVM signature (FIGS. 8E and 8F). Interestingly, this increase in survival was not evident in other subtypes of GBM, and was not dependent upon enrichment of G-CIMP+ proneural patients.

The proneural specificity is consistent with the TAM signatures originally having been generated from the PDG model of gliomagenesis, which most closely represents proneural GBM. This suggests these gene signatures can provide useful prognostic guidance for subjects undergoing treatment with chemotherapeutics, particularly GBM patients treated with CSF-1R inhibitors. As proneural GBM does not respond to aggressive chemo-and radiotherapy compared to the other subtypes, the finding of prognostic value associated with these signatures may have important translational potential for this group of patients. Based on the observed correlation, patients receiving chemotherapy who exhibit a gene signature at least about 80% similar to either the Lasso or the SVM gene signature are expected to respond positively to that chemotherapeutic. In particular, this correlation is expected to be useful with subjects treated with an inhibitor of CSF-1R, particularly compounds of Formula (I) as described herein.

The Nestin-Tv-a;Ink4a/Arf−/− mouse model (mixed strain background) has been previously described (see E. Tchougounova et al., Oncogene 26, 6289 (2007)). Wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 mice and β-actin-GFP (C57BL/6) mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories and Jackson Laboratories respectively, and also bred within our animal facility. Intracranial Injections The initiation of tumors with RCAS-PDGF-B-HA in adult mice has been previously described (A. H. Shih et al., Cancer Res 64, 4783 (2004)). Briefly, mice were fully anesthetized with 10 mg/ml ketamine/1 mg/ml xylazine and were subcutaneously injected with 50 μl of the local anesthetic 0.25% bupivacaine at the surgical site. Mice were intracranially injected with 1 μl containing 2×105 DF-1:RCAS-PDGF-B-HA cells between 5-6 weeks of age using a fixed stereotactic apparatus (Stoelting). Injections were made to the right frontal cortex, approximately 1.5 mm lateral and 1 mm caudal from bregma, and at a depth of 2 mm. To investigate the cell type specific expression of CSF-1 and CSF-1R in flow cytometric sorted cell populations, tumors were initiated in mice with RCAS-PDGF-B-HA-SV40-eGFP (RCAS-PDGF-GFP) as previously described (E. I. Fomchenko et al., PloS ONE 6, e20605 (2011).). Nestin-Tv-a;Ink4a/Arf−/− pups were injected with 1 μl of DF-1:RCAS-PDGF-B-GFP cells on post-natal day 2 into the left cortex between the eye and ear. BLZ945 Inhibitor and Treatment The CSF-1R inhibitor BLZ945 was formulated in 20% captisol at a concentration of 12.5 mg/ml. The vehicle control, 20% captisol, was processed in the same manner. For BLZ945 studies, mice were dosed with 200 mg/kg BLZ945 or vehicle (20% captisol) by oral gavage once per day. To determine if the drug was able to cross the blood-brain barrier, tumor-bearing mice were treated with a single dose of BLZ945 and sacrificed at different time points post treatment. Plasma, and the left (contralateral) and right (tumor-bearing) hemispheres of the brain were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen for subsequent analysis of BLZ945 concentrations in the tissue. For long-term survival studies, dosing was begun at 17 days/2.5 weeks post-injection of RCAS-PDGF-B-HA. For the fixed time-point studies, mice underwent MRI scans at 4-5 weeks post-injection of RCAS-PDGF-B-HA, as previously described (Trans Oncol 2, 89 (2009)). To determine tumor volume, regions of interest (ROI) were circumscribed on T2 weighted images and their corresponding area in mm2 was multiplied by the slice height of 0.7 mm. The total tumor volume is the sum of the ROI volume in each slice, and the volume for the first and last slice in which the tumor appear is halved to approximate the volume of a trapezoid. When tumor volume was in the range of 4.5-40 mm3, animals were randomly assigned to treatment groups. A third cohort of mice with tumors larger than 40 mm3 was also treated with BLZ945 (denoted as BLZ945 Large). A size-matched vehicle treated cohort was not included for this cohort having the larger starting tumor burden because these mice would not have been able to survive to the trial endpoint. Mouse Sacrifice and Tissue Harvest Mice were euthanized at defined time points as described in the figure legends or when they became symptomatic from their tumors, which included signs of poor grooming, lethargy, weight loss, hunching, macrocephaly, or seizures. To isolate tissues for snap freezing in liquid nitrogen, mice were euthanized by carbon dioxide asphyxiation or fully anesthetized with avertin (2,2,2-tribromoethanol, Sigma) and cervically dislocated prior to tissue harvest. For flow cytometry, mice were fully anesthetized with avertin and transcardially perfused with 20 ml of PBS. The brain was then isolated and the tumor macrodissected from the surrounding normal tissue. For proliferation analysis, mice were injected intraperitoneally with 100 mg/g of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU; Sigma) 2 hours prior to sacrifice. To isolate tissues for frozen histology, mice were fully anesthetized with avertin, transcardially perfused with 10 ml of PBS, followed by 10 ml of 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (PFA). The brain was postfixed in PFA overnight at 4° C. while other tissues were cryopreserved in 30% sucrose at 4° C. After post-fixation, the brain was then transferred to 30% sucrose and incubated at 4° C. until the brain was fully equilibrated and sank to the bottom of the tube (typically 2 to 3 days). All tissues were then embedded in OCT (Tissue-Tek) and 10 μm cryostat tissue sections were used for all subsequent analysis. Histology, Immunohistochemistry, and Analysis For grading of tumor malignancy, hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was performed, and the tissues blindly scored by an independent neuropathologist. For immunofluorescence, 10 μm thick frozen sections were thawed and dried at room temperature and then washed in PBS. For the standard staining protocol, tissue sections were blocked in 0.5% PNB in PBS for at least 1 hour at room temperature or up to overnight at 4° C., followed by incubation in primary antibody in 0.25% PNB for 2 hours at room temperature or overnight at 4° C. Primary antibody information and dilutions are listed in Table 6. Sections were then washed in PBS and incubated with the appropriate fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibody (Molecular Probes) at a dilution 1:500 in 0.25% PNB for 1 hour at room temperature. After washing in PBS, tissue sections were counterstained with DAPI (5 mg/ml stock diluted 1:5000 in PBS) for 5 minutes prior to mounting with ProLong Gold Antifade mounting media (Invitrogen). For angiogenesis and proliferation analysis, tissue sections were first subjected to citrate buffer based antigen retrieval by submerging in antigen unmasking solution (0.94% v/v in distilled water; Vector Laboratories) and microwaving for 10 minutes on half power, followed by cooling to room temperature for at least 30 minutes. For angiogenesis analysis, tissues were then washed in PBS and blocked with mouse Ig blocking reagent (Vector Laboratories) according to the manufacturer's instructions for 1 hour at room temperature. For proliferation analysis, after antigen retrieval, tissue sections were incubated with 2M HCl for 15 minutes at room temperature to denature DNA and then in neutralizing 0.1M sodium borate buffer (pH 8.5) for 5 minutes. After PBS washes, the rest of the staining was performed according to the standard protocol. For staining for phagocytosis analysis, 10 μm thick frozen sections were thawed and dried at room temperature and then washed in PBS. Tissue sections were blocked in 0.5% PNB in PBS for at least 1 hour at room temperature, followed by incubation in rabbit anti-cleaved caspase-3 primary antibody diluted 1:500 in 0.5% PNB overnight at 4° C. The next day, slides were washed 6 times for 5 minutes in PBS prior to incubation with goat-anti-rabbit Alexa568 secondary antibody (1:500 in 0.5% PNB) for 1 hour at room temperature. Tissue sections were then washed 6 times for 5 minutes in PBS and blocked overnight at 4° C. in a new buffer of 5% donkey serum, 3% bovine serum albumin, and 0.5% PNB in PBS. The following day, slides were incubated for 2 hours at room temperature with the next set of primary antibodies: rabbit anti-Olig2 (1:200) and rat anti-CD11b (1:200) diluted in 5% donkey serum, 3% bovine serum albumin, and 0.5% PNB in PBS. Slides were washed 6 times for 5 minutes in PBS prior to incubation with donkey-anti-rabbit Alexa647 (1:500) and donkey-anti-rat Alexa488 (1:500) secondary antibodies in 0.5% PNB for 1 hour at room temperature. Tissue sections were then washed 4 times for 5 minutes in PBS prior to staining with DAPI (5 mg/mL stock diluted 1:5000 in PBS) for 5 minutes, washed twice more in PBS for 5 minutes, and mounted with ProLong Gold Antifade mounting media (Invitrogen). Co-staining for CSF-1R (first primary antibody) and Ibal (second primary antibody) was also performed in series in the same manner, with the addition of citrate buffer based antigen retrieval at the outset. Tissue sections were visualized under a Carl Zeiss Axioimager Z1 microscope equipped with an Apotome. The analysis of immunofluorescence staining, cell number, proliferation, apoptosis, and colocalization studies were performed using TissueQuest analysis software (TissueGnostics) as previously described (Journal Immunol Methods 237, 39 (2000)). Overviews of tissue sections from gliomas stained for angiogenesis analysis were generated by TissueGnostics acquisition software by stitching together individual 200× images. All parameters of angiogenesis were quantitated using MetaMorph (Molecular Devices), as previously described (V. Gocheva, et al., Biol Chem 391, 937 (2010)). For analysis of phagocytosis, 15 randomly selected fields of view from within the tumor were acquired using the 63× oil immersion objective (total magnification 630×) and the Apotome to ensure cells were in the same optical section. Positive cells were counted manually using Volocity (PerkinElmer) and were discriminated by the presence of a DAPI+ nucleus. Apoptotic cells were counted as those that had cytoplasmic cleaved caspase-3 (CC3)+ staining and condensed nuclei. A cell was considered to have been engulfed by a macrophage when it was surrounded by a contiguous CD11b+ ring that encircled at least two-thirds of the cell border. The numbers of mice analyzed are specified in the figure legends. Protein Isolation and Western Blotting Mice were treated with BLZ945 or vehicle and sacrificed 1 hour following the final dose and tumors were harvested. Samples were biochemically fractionated as described previously. Synaptosomal membrane fractions were lysed in NP-40 lysis buffer (0.5% NP-40, 50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 50 mM NaCl, 1× complete Mini protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche), 1× PhosSTOP phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Roche)) and protein quantified using the BCA assay (Pierce). Protein lysates were loaded (90 μg/lane) onto SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to PVDF membranes for immunoblotting. Membranes were probed with antibodies against phospho-CSF-1R Y721 (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology), CSF-1R (1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or GAPDH (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology) and detected using HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit (Jackson Immunoresearch) antibodies using chemiluminescence detection (Millipore). Bands from western blots were quantified in the dynamic range using the Gel analysis module in ImageJ software. Primary bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) were cultured in the absence of CSF-1 for 12 hours prior to stimulation with CSF-1 (10 ng/ml) for the time points indicated in FIG. S2, in the presence or absence of 67 nM BLZ945. Whole protein lysates were isolated with NP40 lysis buffer and detected by western blot as described above. Preparation of Single Cell Suspensions and Flow Cytometry For investigation of brain macrophage populations by flow cytometric analysis or sorting, the tumor was digested to a single cell suspension by incubation with 5 ml of papain digestion solution (0.94 mg/ml papain [Worthington], 0.48 mM EDTA, 0.18 mg/ml NAcety-L-cysteine [Sigma], 0.06 mg/ml DNase I [Sigma], diluted in Earl's Balanced Salt Solution and allowed to activate at room temperature for at least 30 minutes). Following digestion, the enzyme was inactivated by the addition of 2 ml of 0.71 mg/ml ovomucoid (Worthington). The cell suspension was then passed through a 40 μm mesh to remove undigested tissue, washed with FACS buffer (1% IgG Free BSA in PBS [Jackson Immunoresearch]), and centrifuged at a low speed of 750 rpm (Sorvall Legend®), to remove debris and obtain the cell pellet. As many immune cell epitopes are papain-sensitive, for investigation of immune cell infiltration by flow cytometric analysis, tumors were digested to a single cell suspension by incubation for 10 minutes at 37° C. with 5 mL of 1.5 mg/ml collagenase III (Worthington) and 0.06 mg/mL DNase I in 1× Hanks Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) with calcium and magnesium. The cell suspension was then washed with PBS and passed through a 40 μm mesh to remove undigested tissue. To remove myelin debris, the cell pellet was resuspended in 15 ml of room temperature 25% Percoll prepared from stock isotonic Percoll (90% Percoll [Sigma], 10% 10× HBSS), and then spun for 15 minutes at 1500 rpm (Sorvall Legend RT) with accelerator and brake set to 1. The cell pellet was then washed with 1× HBSS prior to being resuspended in FACS buffer. After counting, cells were incubated with 1 μl of Fc Block for every million cells for at least 15 minutes at 4° C. Cells were then stained with the appropriate antibodies for 10 minutes at 4° C., washed with FACS buffer, and resuspended in FACS buffer containing DAPI (5 mg/ml diluted 1:5000) for live/dead cell exclusion. Antibodies used for flow cytometry are listed in Table 6. TABLE 6 List of Antibodies and sources.

For sorting, samples were run on a BD FACSAria (Becton Dickstein) cell sorter and cells were collected into FACS buffer. Cells were then centrifuged and resuspended in 500 μl Trizol (Invitrogen) before snap freezing in liquid nitrogen and storage at −80° C. Derivation of Mouse Primary Glioma Cultures, Neurospheres and Glioma Cell Lines Macrodissected tumors were digested to a single cell suspension by incubation for 8-12 minutes at 37° C. as described above. The cell suspension was washed with Neural Stem Cell (NSC) Basal Media (Stem Cell Technologies), and centrifuged at low speed (750 rpm Sorvall Legend RT), to remove debris. To derive mouse primary glioma cultures the cell pellet was resuspended in DMEM containing 10% FBS (Gibco). These primary cultures were used at early passage (P2-P3), and contain a mixture of different cell types found in gliomas including tumor cells, macrophages, and astrocytes as determined by immunofluorescence staining. Primary glioma cultures were grown for 24 hours on poly-L-lysine coated coverslips (BD Biocoat). Cells were then fixed with 4% PFA in 0.1M phosphate buffer overnight at 4° C., permeabilized with 0.1% Triton-X for 5 minutes and blocked with 0.5% PNB for at least one hour. The presence of macrophages, tumor cells and astrocytes were examined by immunofluorescent staining of CD11b (1:200), Nestin (1:500) and GFAP (1:1000), respectively (Table 7).

Fresh media was added every 72 hours for 2 weeks. Primary neurospheres were collected, mechanically disaggregated to a single cell suspension and propagated by serial passaging. To generate glioma cell lines, secondary neurospheres were dissociated to single cell suspensions and cultivated in DMEM+10% FBS as a monolayer. Multiple glioma cell lines were derived from independent mice, denoted GBM1-4 herein. Glioma cells were infected with a pBabe-H2B-mCherry construct as described previously (O. Florey, et al., Nat Cell Biol 13, 1335 (2011)). Isolation of Bone Marrow-Derived Macrophages (BMDMs) For bone marrow isolation, followed by macrophage derivation, C57BL/6 WT, C57BL/6 β-actin-GFP or Nestin-Tv-a; Ink4a/Arf−/− mice were anesthetized with Avertin (Sigma) and then sacrificed via cervical dislocation. Femurs and tibiae were harvested under sterile conditions from both legs and flushed. The marrow was passed through a 40 μm strainer and cultured in 30 ml Teflon® bags (PermaLife PL-30) with 10 ng/ml recombinant mouse CSF-1 (R&D Systems). Bone marrow cells were cultured in Teflon® bags for 7 days, with fresh CSF-1-containing media replacing old media every other day to induce macrophage differentiation. Additional cell lines U-87 MG (HTB-14) glioma and CRL-2467 microglia cell lines were purchased from the ATCC. The U-87 MG cell line was cultured in DMEM+10% FBS. The CRL-2467 cell line was cultured in DMEM+10% FBS with 30 ng/ml recombinant mouse CSF-1. Glioma cell-conditioned media (GCM) experiments Media that had been conditioned by glioma tumor cell lines grown in serum free media for 24 hours was passed through 0.22 μm filters to remove cellular debris, and is referred to herein as glioma cell-conditioned media (GCM). GCM was used to stimulate differentiated C57BL/6 WT or R-actin-GFP+ BMDMs. Control macrophages received fresh media containing 10% FBS and 10 ng/ml recombinant mouse CSF-1. When indicated, differentiated BMDMs were cultivated in GCM containing either DMSO as vehicle, or 67 nM BLZ945, 670 nM BLZ945, or in regular media containing 10 ng/ml mouse recombinant CSF-1 and 10 ng/ml IL-4 (R&D Systems) for 24 hours or 48 hours prior to experimental analysis. Analysis of Mrc1/CD206 Expression by Flow Cytometry For mouse primary glioma cultures (containing a mixed population of tumor cells, TAMs, astrocytes etc.), 1×106 cells were cultivated in DMEM+10% FBS in the presence of BLZ945 or DMSO as vehicle. For BMDMs, 1×106 cells were cultivated in DMEM supplemented with recombinant mouse CSF-1 or GCM in the presence of BLZ945 or DMSO as vehicle. After 48 hours, cells were scraped and washed with FACS buffer. Cells were counted and incubated with 1 μl of Fc Block (BD Pharmingen) per 106 cells for at least 15 minutes at 4° C. Cells were then stained with CD45 and CD11b antibodies for 10 minutes at 4° C. and washed with FACS buffer. Cells were fixed and permeabilized using the BD Cytofix/Cytoperm™ kit (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Subsequently cells were stained with anti-CD206 antibody. For analysis, samples were run on a BD LSR II (Becton Dickstein), and all subsequent compensation and gating performed with FlowJo analysis software (TreeStar). Cell Cycle Analysis Control or GCM pre-stimulated macrophages derived from β-actin-GFP+ mice were cocultured in a 1:1 ratio with 1×105 serum starved mCherry-positive glioma cells (from the cell lines derived above) for 48 hours in the presence of 670nM BLZ945 or DMSO as vehicle. Following collection of trypsinized co-cultured cells, wells were rinsed in additional media and this volume was collected to ensure harvesting of all macrophages, which adhered tightly to cell culture dishes. Samples were then washed once with FACS buffer, followed by incubation for 10 minutes at room temperature in permeabilizing buffer (10 mM PIPES, 0.1 M NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 6.8) containing 0.1 mg DAPI (Invitrogen). After acquisition on an LSR II flow cytometer (BD) using a UV laser (350-360 nm), cell cycle status of glioma tumor cells was analyzed using the Flow Jo Dean-Jett-Fox program for cell cycle analysis. Proliferation Assays Cell growth rate was determined using the MTT cell proliferation kit (Roche). Briefly, cells were plated in triplicate in 96-well plates (1×103 cells/well for glioma cell lines and 5×103 cells/well for BMDM and CRL-2467 cells) in the presence or absence of 6.7-6700 nM of BLZ945. Media was changed every 48 hours. BMDM and CRL-2467 cells were supplemented with 10 ng/ml and 30 ng/ml recombinant mouse CSF-1 respectively unless otherwise indicated. 10 μl of MTT labeling reagent was added to each well and then incubated for 4 hours at 37° C., followed by the addition of 100 μl MTT solubilization reagent overnight. The mixture was gently resuspended and absorbance was measured at 595 nm and 750 nm on a spectraMax 340 pc plate reader (Molecular Devices). Secondary Neurosphere Formation Assay Primary neurospheres were disaggregated to a single cell suspension and 5×103 cells were plated in a 6 well plate in neurosphere media in the presence of BLZ945 or DMSO as vehicle. Media was changed every 48 hours. Secondary neurosphere formation was assayed by counting the number of neurospheres obtained after 2 weeks. RNA Isolation, cDNA Synthesis and Quantitative Real Time PCR RNA was isolated with Trizol, DNase treated, and 0.5 μg of RNA was used for cDNA synthesis. Taqman probes (Applied Biosystems) for Cd11b (Mm00434455_m1), Cd68 (Mm03047343_m1), Csf-1 (Mm00432688_m1), Csf-1r (Mm00432689_m1), II34 (Mm00712774_m1), Mrcl (Mm00485148_m1), and Tv-a (custom), were used for qPCR. Assays were run in triplicate and expression was normalized to ubiquitin C (Mm01201237_m1) for each sample. Microarrays and Gene Expression Profiling All samples were prepared and processed by the genomics core facility at MSKCC. RNA was isolated using Trizol and the quality was assessed by running on an Agilent Bioanalyzer. 75 ng of total RNA was reverse transcribed and labeled using the Genechip 3′ IVT Express Kit (Affymetrix). The resulting cRNA was hybridized to Affymetrix MOE 430A 2.0 chips. Raw expression data were analyzed using GCOS 1.4 (Affymetrix). Data were normalized to a target intensity of 500 to account for differences in global chip intensity. Microarray Analysis All bioinformatic analyses were completed in R using the Bioconductor Suite of packages. Robust Multi-Array Average (RMA) expression values were generated using the ‘ally’ package and quantile normalized (R. A. Irizarry et al., Nucleic Acids Res 31, e15 (2003); L. Gautier, et al., Bioinformatics 20, 307 (2004). The limma' package (G. K. Smyth, Statistical Applications in Genetics and Molecular Biology 3, Article 3 (2004)) was used to identify differentially expressed genes between the vehicle and BLZ945 treated samples. Differential expression was considered significant at a fold change of +/−2 with a false discovery rate of 10%. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was used as described previously (15). For subsequent analysis and comparison to human datasets, mouse expression values were mean centered across all samples. Lasso Regression Method for Gene Signature Identification Mouse expression data was normalized and mean centered as described above. Differentially expressed genes were used for further analysis. A Lasso regression model was trained to differentiate between Vehicle and BLZ945 treated samples using the ‘glmnet’ package (J. Friedman, et al., Journal of Statistical Software 33, 1 (2010).). The regularization parameter for Lasso regression was chosen by 4-fold cross validation. Patient Datasets TCGA expression data was downloaded from the TCGA data portal and all clinical data was downloaded from the data portal ≧http://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/tcga/tcgaHome2.jsp>. Clinical and expression data for the Rembrandt data set was downloaded from <https://caintegrator.nci.nih.gov/rembrandt/>. The Freije (GSE4412), Murat (GSE7696), and Phillips (GSE4271) datasets were downloaded from the NCBI <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/>. For the Freije datasets, only samples that were run on the HGU133A platform were considered, as samples on the HGU133B platform contained minimal overlap with the remaining datasets. Each data set was imported separately using the ‘Ally’ package and RMA expression values were generated. All data sets were quantile normalized and each gene was mean centered across all patients. Subtyping of Non TCGA Patients To investigate subtype specific survival differences in all publically available datasets, a subtype classifier described previously (R. G. Verhaak et al., Cancer Cell 17, 98 (2010)) was utilized to train a support vector machine (SVM). The 840 genes used by Verhaak and colleagues for the ClacNc analysis were used to subset the dataset. Subsequently, data sets were subsetted for genes that were called present across all patient data sets described above. The remaining 776 genes were used to train a multiclass SVM on the Core samples from the TCGA dataset. The SVM was completed using a Gaussian radial basis kernel function using the ‘kernlab’ package (A. Karatzoglou, et al., J. Statistical Software, 11, 9 (2004)). This SVM was then used to predict the subtype of the remainder of the TCGA patients and public datasets. Patient Classification A SVM was trained on mouse expression data to classify patients into “Vehicle” classification or “BLZ945” classification. Patient expression data was subsetted for common genes across all data sets and genes that have known mouse homologues. Similarly, mouse expression data was subsetted for genes with human homologues that were common across all patient samples. Subsequently, mouse data was subsetted for differentially expressed genes identified using the limma' package. Human data was subsetted for the human homologues of these differentially expressed genes. This led to a feature reduction from 257 differentially expressed genes to 206 differentially expressed genes with known human homologues across all patient datasets. The ‘kernlab’ package was then used to train a SVM on the mouse expression data using a vanilla kernel function. This SVM was then used to predict patients into either “Vehicle” classifier or “BLZ945” classifier. A similar approach was used to classify patients with a Lasso regression model. The subsetting of patient and mouse data was identical to that described above. Instead of using the ‘kernlab’ package, the Lasso regression model was trained using the ‘glmnet’package. This model was then used to predict patient classification into either “Vehicle” classifier or “BLZ945” classifier. G-CIMP patient status was determined by hierarchical clustering of patient methylation data (H. Noushmehr et al., Cancer Cell 17, 510 (2010)) as described below. Stratification of Patients by G-CIMP Status Experimentally, it appears that the survival advantage offered by the “BLZ945” treatment signature was not due to an enrichment of Glioma CpG Island Methylator Phenotype (GCIMP) patients, which have previously been shown to be associated with improved overall survival (Noushmehr). Of the 453 GBMs analyzed from the TCGA dataset, 263 also had genomic methylation data and were classified into the methylation clusters as described previously. Of the 21 G-CIMP patients, 20 (95%) were classified into the “BLZ945″classification, showing a strong enrichment of BLZ945 samples in the G-CIMP patients. Despite this enrichment, survival analysis of Proneural patients known to be GCIMP negative (67/133 total Proneural patients) revealed that the “BLZ945” classification group still showed an increase in survival of ˜10.8 months (P=0.014). Moreover, cox proportional hazard models demonstrated that the increase in survival demonstrated by “BLZ945” classification was not dependent upon G-CIMP patients. The hazard ratio associated with the BLZ945 signature was significant with and without G-CIMP patients. Also, the hazard ratio for G-CIMP strata was not significant when the BLZ945 signature was also considered in a mixed model. Thus, although the G-CIMP patients are clearly enriched for mock “BLZ945” classification samples, the survival benefit offered by this classification is not dependent upon GCIMP status. Survival Analysis Survival analysis was completed using the ‘survival’ package in R (T. Therneau, in R package version 2.36-12. (2012)). Hazard ratios were determined utilizing the ‘coxph’ function from the ‘survival’ package. Patients were stratified based on the probability of the Lasso regression classification model, G-CIMP status, or both as indicated. P values were generated using Wald's test. Plots for Patient Analyses All Kaplan-Meier survival curves, heatmaps and volcano plots were generated in R v 2.14.1 using the ‘gplots’ package (G. R. Warnes et al., R package version 2.10.1, (2011).). Hazard ratio forest plots were generated in GraphPad Prism ProS. Data Presentation and Statistical Analysis Data are presented as means with their respective standard error (SEM) or as statistical scatter plots using GraphPad Prism ProS. Numeric data were analyzed by unpaired twotailed Student's t-test unless otherwise noted. For survival curves, P values were obtained using Log Rank (Mantel-Cox) test, and Fisher's exact test was used for histological tumor grading. P=0.05 was considered as statistically significant. 1.-24. (canceled) 25.
