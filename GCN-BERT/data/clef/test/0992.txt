Step 3
1-(7-fluorobenzofuran-3-yl)propan-2-one
7-fluorobenzofuran-3(2H)-one 84c (340 mg, 2.2 mmol) and acetonyltriphenylphophonium chloride (1.2 g, 3.3 mmol) were dissolved in 10 mL of xylene, then 1.1 mL of N,N-diisopropylehtylamine was added. The reaction solution was warmed up to 140Â°C and stirred for 12 hours, then cooled to room temperature, and water was added. The reaction solution was extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic phase was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure, and the resulting residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography with elution system B to obtain the title compound 1-(7-fluorobenzofuran-3-yl)propan-2-one 84d (171 mg, yield 40%) as a red-brown liquid.
