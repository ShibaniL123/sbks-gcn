DETAILED DESCRIPTION Disclosed herein are quinone-masked probes including fluorophores and/or luminophores. The compounds can be used as labeling reagents for cell uptake measurements. These labeling reagents can be broadly used to label a variety of targets of interest such as peptides, proteins including but not limited to antibodies or low density lipoproteins (LDL), nucleotides, sugars, lipids, specific substrates for transporters, or nanoparticles and microsomes including but not limited to drug carriers. The labeling reagents may also be used to label detergents. Upon uptake of labeled targets of interest by cells, quinone can be reduced by intracellular reduction potential to release the fluorophore or luminophore. The intensity of fluorescence or luminescence can be correlated to the amount of the target(s) of interest taken up by cells. Also disclosed are labeled agents. The disclosed labeling reagents and labeled agents have multiple advantages over current techniques: they allow for either imaging or plate-based detection; they are less sensitive to extracellular reductants (e.g. free thiols, DTT, GSH); they avoid the need for fixed cells; and no washing step is required opposed to traditional isotope and fluorescence methods. 1.

Heterocyclic groups of the present invention may be unsubstituted or substituted by one or more suitable substituents, preferably 1 to 3 suitable substituents, as defined above. Heterocyclic groups of the present invention may be can contain one or more oxo groups (═O) or thioxo (═S) groups attached to the ring. As used herein, the term “hydroxy” refers to an —OH group. As used herein, the term “hydroxyalkoxy” refers to an alkoxy group, as defined herein, substituted by at least one hydroxy group. Representative examples of hydroxyalkoxy include, but are not limited to, hydroxyethoxy, and 2-hydroxypropoxy. As used herein, the term “hydroxyalkyl” refers to an alkyl group, as defined herein, substituted by at least one hydroxy group. Representative examples of hydroxyalkyl include, but are not limited to, hydroxymethyl, 2-hydroxyethyl, 3-hydroxypropyl, 2,3-dihydroxypropyl, 2,3-dihydroxypentyl, 4-hydroxybutyl, 2-ethyl-4-hydroxyheptyl, 3,4-dihydroxybutyl, and 5-hydroxypentyl. As used herein, the term “hydroxycarbonyl” refers to a hydroxy group, as defined herein, appended to the parent molecular moiety through a carbonyl group, as defined herein. The term “linker” may refer to a chain of 2 to 50 atoms that link a substrate moiety to the parent molecular moiety. Linkers may include one or more heteroatoms. Linkers may also be substituted by oxo groups, amino groups, alkyl groups, halogens and nitro groups. Linkers may also contain aryl groups. The linkers may be “traceless” or “self-immolative” linkers. The term “traceless linker” or “self-immolative linker” refers to a linker wherein cleavage of the substrate moiety from the linker results in spontaneous cleavage of the linker from the parent molecular moiety. The term “lower cycloalkyl” refers to a monovalent moiety obtained by removing a hydrogen atom from a hydrocarbon compound having from 3 to 6 carbon atoms. Examples of saturated lower cycloalkyl groups include, but are not limited to, groups such as cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl and cyclohexyl. Examples of unsaturated lower cycloalkyl groups which have one or more carbon-carbon double bonds include, but are not limited to, groups such as cyclopropenyl, cyclobutenyl, cyclopentenyl and cyclohexenyl. The term “luminescent enzyme”, “bioluminescent enzyme”, or “luciferase” as used interchangeably herein refers to a class of oxidative enzymes used in bioluminescence wherein the enzyme produces and emits light when given a substrate. The luciferase may be a naturally occurring, recombinant or mutant luciferase that uses a luciferase substrate. The luciferase substrate may be luciferin, a luciferin derivative or analog, a preluciferin derivative or analog, a coelenterazine, or a coelenterazine derivative or analog. The luminescent enzyme, if naturally occurring, may be obtained easily by the skilled person from an organism. If the luminescent enzyme is one that occurs naturally or is a recombinant or mutant luminescent enzyme, e.g. one which retains activity in a luciferase-coelenterazine or luciferase-luciferin reaction of a naturally occurring luminescent enzyme, it can be obtained readily from a culture of bacteria, yeast, mammalian cells, insect cells, plant cells, or the like, transformed to express a nucleic acid encoding the luminescent enzyme. Further, the recombinant or mutant luminescent enzyme can be derived from an in vitro cell-free system using a nucleic acid encoding the luciferase. Suitable luminescent enzymes include luciferases derived from bioluminescent decapods, such as from the Oplophoroidea (e.g. Oplophorus-derived luciferases), beetle luciferases (e.g., Photinus pyralis, Photuris pennsylvanica, etc.), marine organisms such as cnidarians (e.g., Renilla luciferase), Aristeidae, Solenoceridae, Luciferidae, Sergestidae, Pasipheidae and Thalassocarididae decapoda families, copepod luciferases, such as Gaussia luciferase, such as Gaussia princeps luciferase, Metridia luciferases, such as Metridia longa and Metridia pacifica luciferases, Vargula luciferases, such as Vargula hilgendorfii luciferase, Pleuromamma xiphias luciferase, and photoproteins, such as Aequorin, and variants, recombinants, and mutants thereof. A “luminescent reaction mixture” contains materials that will allow the luminescent enzyme to generate a light signal, i.e., luminescence. The mixture may also contain the enzyme, e.g., the luciferase enzyme or luciferase. The materials, and the particular concentrations and/or amounts, needed to generate a luminescent signal will vary depending on the luminescent enzyme used as well as the type of assay being performed. Often other materials will be added to the solution including: a buffer to maintain the reaction at the proper pH, an additive such as PRIONEX or Bovine serum albumin (BSA) to help maintain enzyme activity, reducing agents, detergents, etc. As used herein, the term “methylenedioxy” refers to a —OCH2O— group wherein the oxygen atoms of the methylenedioxy are attached to the parent molecular moiety through two adjacent carbon atoms. As used herein, the term “natural amino acid” refers to any one of the common, naturally occurring L-amino acids found in proteins, including glycine (Gly), alanine (Ala), valine (Val), leucine (Leu), isoleucine (Ile), lysine (Lys), arginine (Arg), histidine (His), proline (Pro), serine (Ser), threonine (Thr), phenylalanine (Phe), tyrosine (Tyr), tryptophan (Trp), aspartic acid (Asp), glutamic acid (Glu), asparagine (Asn), glutamine (Gln), cysteine (Cys) and methionine (Met). As used herein, the term “unnatural amino acid” refers to all amino acids which are not natural amino acids as described above. Such amino acids include the D-isomers of any of the 20 naturally occurring amino acids described above. Unnatural amino acids also include homoserine, ornithine, norleucine, and thyroxine. Additional unnatural amino acids are well known to one of ordinary skill in the art. An unnatural amino acid may be a D- or L-isomer. An unnatural amino acid may also be an alpha amino acid or a beta amino acid. An unnatural amino acid may also be a post-translationally modified amino acid, such as a phosphorylated serine, threonine or tyrosine, an acylated lysine, or an alkylated lysine or arginine. Many forms of post-translationally modified amino acids are known. As used herein, the term “protected amino acid,” refers to an amino acid side chain as described above which additionally contains a protected functional group. Protecting groups are well known in the art and are intended to protect such functional groups as amino, hydroxy, thio or carboxy against undesirable reactions during synthetic procedures. The protecting groups may be removed by a chemical reaction following the synthesis. Examples of protected amino acid side chains include benzyloxymethyl derived from serine, (4-methoxyphenyl)methyl derived from tyrosine, and tert-butylpropanoate derived from glutamate. As used herein, the term “amino acid side chain,” refers to the group attached to the α-carbon of an amino acid. It is the characterizing portion of an amino acid and is derived from a corresponding amino acid by elimination of the NH2CHC(O)OH moiety. For example, the amino acid side chain of alanine is methyl, and the amino acid side chain of phenylalanine is phenylmethyl. An amino acid side chain may be a natural amino acid side chain or an unnatural amino acid side chain. In some embodiments, an amino acid side chain may be a protected amino acid side chain. As used herein, the term “amino protecting group,” refers to a moiety that prevents chemical reactions from occurring on the nitrogen atom to which that protecting group is attached. An amino protecting group must also be removable by a chemical reaction. Such groups are well known in the art and include those described in detail in Protecting Groups in Organic Synthesis, T. W. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts, 3rd edition, John Wiley & Sons, 1999, the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference. Suitable amino protecting groups include, but are not limited to, carbobenzyloxy (—NHCO—OCH2C6H5 or —NH-Cbz); t-butyloxycarbonyl (—NHCO—OC(CH3)3 or —NH-Boc); 9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (—NH-Fmoc), 2,2,2-trichloroethyloxycarbonyl (—NH-Troc), and allyloxycarbonyl (—NH-Alloc). (In each of the above, the —NH— represents the nitrogen from the amino group that is being protected.) As used herein, the term “amino blocking group,” refers to a moiety that prevents chemical reactions from occurring on the nitrogen atom to which that blocking group is attached. In contrast to an amino protecting group, an amino blocking group is not intended to be removed by a chemical reaction. Such groups include, for example, acyl groups such as acetyl (—NHCO—CH3), and succinyl (—NH—CO—CH2—CH2—COO−). (In each of the above, the —NH— represents the nitrogen from the amino group that is being blocked.) As used herein, the term “aminoluciferin” refers to (4S)-2-(6-amino-1,3-benzothiazol-2-yl)-4,5-dihydrothiazole-4-carboxylic acid, or a substituted analog of this molecule. As used herein, the term “nitrogen protecting group” refers to groups intended to protect an amino group against undesirable reactions during synthetic procedures. Representative nitrogen protecting groups include acetyl, benzoyl, benzyl, benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz), formyl, phenylsulfonyl, tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc), tert-butylacetyl, trifluoroacetyl, and triphenylmethyl (trityl). As used herein, the term “oxo” refers to a double bonded oxygen (═O) radical wherein the bond partner is a carbon atom. Such a radical can also be thought as a carbonyl group. The term “peptide” or “polypeptide” refers to a sequence of at least two amino acids. In some embodiments, a peptide may contain no more than 80 amino acids, or no more than 35 amino acids, or no more than 10 amino acids. The term “saccharide” refers to a sugar or other carbohydrate, especially a simple sugar. It includes both the alpha- and the beta-anomers. The saccharide can be a C6-polyhydroxy compound, typically a C6-pentahydroxy, and often a cyclic glycal. It includes the known simple sugars and their derivatives, as well as polysaccharides with two or more monosaccharide residues. The saccharide can include protecting groups on the hydroxyl groups. The hydroxyl groups of the saccharide can be replaced with one or more acetamido, halo or amino groups. Additionally, one or more of the carbon atoms can be oxidized, for example to keto or carbonyl groups. Suitable saccharides include galactose, glucose, glucoronic acid and neurominic acid. As used herein, the term “sulfonyl” refers to an >S(O)2 group. A prefix attached to a multi-component substituent only applies to the first component it precedes. To illustrate, the term “cycloalkylalkyl” contains two components: alkyl and cycloalkyl. Thus, the C1-C6-prefix on C1-C6-cycloalkylalkyl means that the alkyl component of the cycloalkylalkyl contains from 1 to 6 carbon atoms; the C1-C6-prefix does not describe the cycloalkyl component. To illustrate further, the term “halo-C1-C6-alkyl” refers to halomethyl, haloethyl, halopropyl, halobutyl, halopentyl, and halohexyl. To illustrate further, the prefix “halo” on haloalkoxyalkyl indicates that only the alkoxy component of the alkoxyalkyl substituent is substituted with one or more halogen radicals. If the halogen substitution may only occur on the alkyl component, the substituent would instead be described as “alkoxyhaloalkyl.” A substituent is “substitutable” if it comprises at least one carbon or nitrogen atom that is bonded to one or more hydrogen atoms. Thus, for example, hydrogen, halogen, and cyano do not fall within this definition. In addition, a sulfur atom in a heterocyclyl containing such atom is substitutable with one or two oxo substituents. If a substituent is described as being “substituted”, a non-hydrogen radical is in the place of hydrogen radical on a carbon or nitrogen of the substituent. Thus, for example, a substituted alkyl substituent is an alkyl substituent in which at least one non-hydrogen radical is in the place of a hydrogen radical on the alkyl substituent. To illustrate, monofluoroalkyl is alkyl substituted with a fluoro radical, and difluoroalkyl is alkyl substituted with two fluoro radicals. It should be recognized that if there is more than one substitution on a substituent, each non-hydrogen radical may be identical or different (unless otherwise stated). When a substituent is referred to as “unsubstituted” or not referred to as “substituted” or “optionally substituted”, it means that the substituent does not have any substituents. If a substituent is described as being “optionally substituted”, the substituent may be either (1) not substituted or (2) substituted. If a substituent is described as being optionally substituted with up to a particular number of non-hydrogen radicals, that substituent may be either (1) not substituted; or (2) substituted by up to that particular number of non-hydrogen radicals or by up to the maximum number of substitutable positions on the substituent, whichever is less. Thus, for example, if a substituent is described as a heteroaryl optionally substituted with up to 3 non-hydrogen radicals, then any heteroaryl with less than 3 substitutable positions would be optionally substituted by up to only as many non-hydrogen radicals as the heteroaryl has substitutable positions. To illustrate, tetrazolyl (which has only one substitutable position) would be optionally substituted with up to one non-hydrogen radical. To illustrate further, if an amino nitrogen is described as being optionally substituted with up to 2 non-hydrogen radicals, then a primary amino nitrogen will be optionally substituted with up to 2 non-hydrogen radicals, whereas a secondary amino nitrogen will be optionally substituted with up to only 1 non-hydrogen radical. If substituents are described as being “independently selected” from a group, each substituent is selected independent of the other. Each substituent, therefore, may be identical to or different from the other substituent(s). 2. LABELING REAGENTS Disclosed are compounds that may be labeling reagents.

METHODS The compounds of the present invention provide an effective tool for covalently labeling agents for a wide variety of cell uptake applications. The labeled agents allow quantification of the uptake of a biomolecule(s) of interest in biological samples (i.e., cells, tissues, and organs), monitoring effectiveness for drug delivery, effectiveness of therapeutic treatments, profiling pharmacokinetics, drug-drug interactions and drug toxicity, monitoring cellular metabolic status, such as fatty acids and glucose, and detecting homeostasis of cholesterol. The cell uptake measurement is often a significant part of scientific research and development, drug design, screening and optimization, phylogenetic classification, genotyping individuals, parental and forensic identification, environmental studies, diagnosis, prognosis, and/or treatment of disease conditions. a. Methods of Evaluating Cellular Uptake In some aspects, provided are methods for evaluating cellular uptake of an agent. The methods may comprise contacting a sample comprising a cell with a labeled agent as detailed above and detecting light emission, whereby the detection of light emission indicates cellular uptake of the agent. The cellular uptake of the agent results in the reduction of the compound and the generation of a released reporter moiety. (1) Fluorescent Reporter Moiety In some embodiments, the reporter moiety may include a fluorescent reporter moiety. The fluorescent reporter moiety may include a fluorophore. Light emission is detected by exposing the sample to a wavelength of light and detecting the fluorescence generated by the released reported moiety. An increase in fluorescence or a change in fluorescence wavelength as compared to the fluorescence or fluorescence wavelength of a control sample indicates cellular uptake of the agent. The control sample may be sample medium only, without cells, a sample with cells but without experimental treatment, or a sample not contacted with labeled agent. Fluorescence may be detected inside or outside the cell. Non-reducible analogues of the disclosed quinone labeling moieties may be used as control labels. (2) Bioluminescent Reporter Moiety In some aspects, the reporter moiety may include a bioluminescent reporter moiety. The bioluminescent reporter moiety may include a prosubstrate for a luciferase. In some embodiments, the cell includes a luciferase. The luciferase may be expressed in the cell. Light emission is detected by detecting luminescence produced by the luciferase utilizing the released reporter moiety. The detection of any light emission may indicate the cellular uptake of the agent. Alternatively, luminescence of the sample may be compared to the luminescence of a control sample, wherein cellular uptake of the agent is indicated if the luminescence of the sample is higher than the luminescence of the control sample. The control sample may be a sample that is not contacted with a labeled agent. Luminescence may be detected inside or outside the cell. In some embodiments, the cell does not include or express a luciferase, and luciferase is added to the sample. Light emission is detected by detecting luminescence produced by the luciferase utilizing the released reporter moiety that may exit the cell or be present in a cell lysate. The detection of any light emission may indicate the cellular uptake of the agent. Alternatively, luminescence of the sample may be compared to the luminescence of a control sample, wherein cellular uptake of the agent is indicated if the luminescence of the sample is higher than the luminescence of the control sample. The control sample may be sample medium only, without cells, a sample with cells but without experimental treatment, or a sample not contacted with labeled agent. Luminescence may be detected inside or outside the cell. Non-reducible analogues of the disclosed quinone labeling moieties may be used as control labels. (3) Sample The labeled agents may be used with samples containing biological components. The sample may comprise cells, tissues, or organs in vitro or in vivo. The compounds are generally non-toxic to living cells and other biological components within the concentrations of use. Cells may include eukaryotic cells, e.g., yeast, avian, plant, insect or mammalian cells, including but not limited to human, simian, murine, canine, bovine, equine, feline, ovine, caprine or swine cells, or prokaryotic cells, or cells from two or more different organisms, or cell lysates or supernatants thereof. The cells may not have been genetically modified via recombinant techniques (non-recombinant cells), or may be recombinant cells which are transiently transfected with recombinant DNA and/or the genome of which is stably augmented with a recombinant DNA, or which genome has been modified to disrupt a gene, e.g., disrupt a promoter, intron or open reading frame, or replace one DNA fragment with another. The recombinant DNA or replacement DNA fragment may encode a molecule to be detected by the methods of the invention, a moiety which alters the level or activity of the molecule to be detected, and/or a gene product unrelated to the molecule or moiety that alters the level or activity of the molecule. The cell may or may not express a luciferase. (4) Contact The labeled agents may be combined with the sample in a way that facilitates contact between the compound and the sample components of interest. Typically, the labeled agent or a solution containing the labeled agent is simply added to the sample. The cell uptake levels for selected labeled agents can be monitored with/without treatments that permeabilize the plasma membrane, such as electroporation, shock treatments or high extracellular ATP. Alternatively, selected labeled agents can be monitored physically inserted into cells, e.g., by pressure microinjection, scrape loading, patch clamp methods, or phagocytosis. An additional detection reagent typically produces a detectable response due to the presence of a specific cell component, intracellular substance, or cellular condition, according to methods generally known in the art. When the additional detection reagent has, or yields a product with, spectral properties that differ from those of the subject labeled agents, multi-color applications are possible. This is particularly useful where the additional detection reagent is a dye or dye conjugate having spectral properties that are detectably distinct from those of the labeled agents. In certain embodiments, washing steps are unnecessary when using the disclosed labeling reagents and labeled agents. (5) Light Detection The labeled agents are generally utilized by combining a labeled agent as described above with a sample of interest comprising a cell under conditions selected to yield a detectable optical response or light output. Typically, a specified characteristic of the sample is determined by comparing the optical response with a standard or expected response. The sample may be illuminated at a wavelength selected to elicit the optical response. Alternatively, the light emission from the sample may be measured in a reading device that can measure the light output (luminescence) generated by the luciferase and bioluminescent reporter moiety, e.g., using a luminometer or photomultiplier. The optical response or light output may also be measured over time, for example in the same reaction chamber for a period of seconds, minutes, hours, etc. A detectable optical response means a change in, or occurrence of, an optical signal that is detectable either by observation or instrumentally. Typically, the detectable response is a change in fluorescence or luminescence, such as a change in the intensity, excitation or emission wavelength distribution of fluorescence or luminescence, fluorescence or luminescence lifetime, fluorescence or luminescence polarization, or a combination thereof. The degree and/or location of the signal, compared with a standard or expected response, indicates whether, and to what degree, the sample possesses a given characteristic. At any time after or during contact with the labeled agent, the sample is illuminated with a wavelength of light selected to give a detectable optical response and observed with a means for detecting the optical response. Equipment that is useful for illuminating the compounds of the invention includes, but is not limited to, hand-held ultraviolet lamps, mercury arc lamps, xenon lamps, lasers and laser diodes. These illumination sources are optionally integrated into laser scanners, fluorescence microplate readers, standard or minifluorometers, or chromatographic detectors. The optical response or light output may be optionally detected by visual inspection or by use of any of the following devices: CCD cameras, video cameras, photographic film, laser-scanning devices, fluorometers, photodiodes, quantum counters, epifluorescence microscopes, scanning microscopes, flow cytometers, fluorescence microplate readers, or by means for amplifying the signal such as photomultiplier tubes. Where the sample is examined using a flow cytometer, examination of the sample optionally includes sorting portions of the sample according to their fluorescence response. 6. KITS One aspect of the invention is the formulation of kits that facilitate the practice of various assays using any of the compounds of the invention, as described above. The kits of the invention may comprise a labeling reagent, an agent, a labeled agent, or any combination thereof. The kit optionally further comprises one or more buffering agents, typically present as an aqueous solution. The kits of the invention optionally further comprise at least one component for detecting the released labeled reagent, such as a detection reagent. The detection reagent may contain a luciferase, as described above, and/or other reagents required to conduct the detection assay such as buffers, salts, enzymes, enzyme co-factors, such as D-cysteine, and the like buffers. For example, the detection reagent may be Luciferin Detection Reagent (Promega Corporation). The kits of the invention optionally further comprise a purification medium for purifying the resulting labeled agent, luminescence and/or fluorescence standards, enzymes, enzyme inhibitors, organic solvent, constructs for expression of fusion proteins, e.g., fusion proteins comprising a luciferase protein fused to a protein or target of interest, fusion proteins, or instructions for carrying out an assay of the invention. In other embodiments, the kit also includes a genetically-modified cell or a vector for gene fusion, e.g., fusion comprising a luciferase protein fused to a protein or target of interest. Instructions for use optionally may be included. 7.
