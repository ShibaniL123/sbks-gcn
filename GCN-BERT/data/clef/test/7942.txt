Apparatus for cleaning of bulbous and tuberous plants. The present invention relates to an apparatus for cleaning of bulbous and tuberous plants. From the European patent application number EP 0 730 399 A is known an apparatus for the separating of potatoes from admixtures such as earth, stones, clods and foliage and such like, with a number of rolling bodies disposed beside one another on parallel axes transverse to the direction of transport of the potatoes, whereby the potatoes that are to be cleaned are transported over the bodies from a potato input end to a potato output end, while the admixtures that are loosened from the potatoes are led downwards through the space between the rolling bodies. With this known apparatus the potatoes are separated in a mechanical manner, that is to say dry, from the admixtures. After this separation the potatoes still have to be washed. From the Dutch patent application number NL 1030714 is known a sorting apparatus for bulbous and tuberous plants and such like comprising a washing basin filled with water from where the bulbs end up via an overflow onto sieving means which are formed by parallel rolls that are positioned parallel to the direction of transport of the plants. Above the rolls a supply of water is provided, by means of which water a pushing force and extra cleaning effort is exerted onto the bulbs, whereby the bulbs are transported over the rolls and the rest material (the admixtures with any smaller bulbs) with the water is discharged downwards with the water through the spaces between the rolls to a collecting vessel. The water is circulated from the collecting vessel to the washing vessel. At the end of the apparatus, as seen in the direction of transport of the bulbs, a discharge belt for the rest material is provided. It is an object of the present invention to provide an apparatus by means of which clods and stones and also foliage and further rest material can be removed from the bulbous and tuberous plants in one operation, which uses little energy and water and which is short and compact in form. The apparatus according to the invention to that end comprises a frame provided with a washing area for loosening of stones and clods and such like from the tuberous and bulbous plants, with an overflow for transporting the tuberous plants from the washing area to a separating area for the loosening of foliage and further rest material from the tuberous plants, with means for the supply of water to the washing area and/or the separating area, whereby the separating area is provided with a number of rolling bodies for moving the tuberous plants thereon to a discharge for the tuberous plants, and wherein in between the rolling bodies spaces are provided for the foliage and further rest material to fall through, while underneath the rolling bodies a collecting area is provided for collecting the water that has been led over the crops, and whereby underneath the rolling bodies and above the receiving area means are provided by which foliage and further rest material can be removed and discharged from the water that has been led over the plants. According to a characteristic of the apparatus according to the invention the means by which foliage and further rest material can be removed and discharged from the water that has been led over the plants are formed by a conveyor belt provided with openings or perforations. According to another characteristic of the apparatus according to the invention the means are formed by a netting belt. According to a further characteristic of the apparatus according to the invention means are provided for the circulating of water from the collecting area to the washing area. Further characteristics and features will be described with reference to the drawings of an example of an embodiment of the apparatus according to the invention. Figure 1 shows a top view, partly in section, of an example of an embodiment of the apparatus according to the invention. Figure 2 shows a side view of the embodiment according to figure 1 , partly in section. Figure 3 shows a back view of the apparatus according to the figures 1 and 2. As can be seen in the figures 1 , 2 and 3 the apparatus for the cleaning of bulbous and tuberous plants comprises a frame 1 provided with a washing area 2. The washing area 2 comprises a water vessel 3 with an overflow 4 to a separating area 5. Further means 6 are provided (schematically shown) for the supply of water to the separating area 5, and a pump 7 for the circulating of water from a collecting area 8 back to the water vessel 3 in the washing area 2. The separating area 5 is provided with a number of rolling bodies 9 in between which spaces 10 are provided. In the example of the embodiment shown the rolling bodies 9 extend transverse to the direction of transport of the plants. The distance between the rolling bodies is adjustable, such that the spaces 10 between the rolling bodies 9 can be made larger and smaller. In an embodiment the direction of rotation of the rolling bodies or that of one or more rolling bodies is adjustable. Depending on the sort of plants several sorts of rolling bodies can be used, of steel, with a flexible shell (from rubber or plastic). Further it is possible to provide the outer surface of all rolling bodies 9 with ribs, or to provide only a part of the rolling bodies, the rolling bodies 9a, with those, while the other part of the rolling bodies, the rolling bodies 9b, are more or less smooth. The ribs accomplish an extra conveying effort onto the plants and/or an extra foliage and dirt removing effort. In the example of an embodiment shown the separating area 5 with the rolling bodies 9, as seen in the direction of transport (arrow A) of the plants 1 1 , is arranged sloping downwards. The slope is adjustable. Behind the separating area 5 the conveyor belt 12 is provided for the discharge of the cleaned bulbous and tuberous plants 1 1. During operation the bulbous and tuberous plants 1 1 are brought into the washing vessel 3 in the washing area 2. As a result of the water circulation by the pump 7 a whirling is established in the water vessel 3, by means of which stones and clods are loosened from the bulbous and tuberous plants. The stones and clods end up in a bottom vessel and are removed by means of a discharge belt 13. Through the overflow 4 the bulbous and tuberous plants together with the water arrive in the separating area 5 and onto the rolling bodies 9. By the rotation of the rolling bodies 9 the bulbous and tuberous plants 1 1 are transported over the rolling bodies 9 in the direction of the discharge belt 12. Depending on the nature of the plants 11 the distance between the rolling bodies 9 and the surface of the rolls (steel, flexible, provided with ribs, etc. ) is chosen such that adhering foliage and such like is led by the rolling bodies through the spaces 10 and falls downwards there through. By means of the supply 6 of water onto the separating area 5 an extra cleaning effort lakes place onto the bulbous and tuberous plants 1 1, while the water further contributes to the loosening of the foliage from the bulbous and tuberous plants and the pushing/pulling along of the loosened foliage and further rest material downwards through the spaces 10. Because the stones and clods first are largely removed from the bulbous and tuberous plants in the washing area 2 substantially less damage occurs to the plants and the apparatus in the separating area 5. As can be seen in figure 2 underneath the rolling bodies 9 a collecting area 8 is provided for collecting the water that has been led over the bulbous and tuberous plants. This water is returned by the pump 7 to the washing area 2. Beneath the rolling bodies 9 and above the collecting area 8 means 14 are provided by which the loosened foliage and further rest material can be removed from the water that has been led over the bulbous and tuberous plants, and discharged. By this it is prevented that the foliage, floating parts and further rest material and dirt, such as small light stones and such like are circulated again and again in the apparatus. In this example of an embodiment the means are formed by a conveyor sieve belt 14. By the positioning of this belt underneath the separating area 5 and above the collecting area 8 a very short and compact apparatus is provided. 1. Apparatus for cleaning of bulbous and tuberous plants, comprising a frame provided with a washing area for the loosening of stones and clods and such like from the plants, with an overflow for transporting the plants from the washing area to a separating area for loosening of foliage and further rest material from the plants, with means for the supply of water to the washing area and/or the separating area, wherein the separating area is provided with a number of rolling bodies for moving thereon of the plants to a discharge for the plants, and wherein in between the rolling bodies spaces are provided for allowing the foliage and further rest material to fall through, while underneath the rolling bodies a collecting area is provided for collecting the water that has been led over the plants, and whereby underneath the rolling bodies and above the receiving area means are provided by which foliage and further rest material can be removed and discharged from the water that has been led over the crops. 2.
