Preparation of: rac-trans-1-(1-acetyl-4-(4-methoxyphenyl)piperidin-3-yl)-3-(6-chloropyridin-3-yl)urea (Example 19)
To a stirred solution of rac-trans-1-(3-amino-4-(4-methoxyphenyl)piperidin-1-yl)ethanone hydrochloride (0.04 g, 0.14 mmol, 1 eq) [synthesis described in the synthesis of Example 4] in DCM (10 mL) was added Et3N (0.06 mL, 0.42 mmol, 3 eq) followed by 2-chloro-5-isocyanatopyridine (0.02 g, 0.14 mmol, 1 eq) at 0Â° C. and stirred for 2 h at RT. Then the reaction was quenched with sat. NaHCO3 solution, the organic layer was separated, washed with brine (10 mL), dried over Na2SO4 and concentrated. The crude was purified by preparative TLC to afford Example 19 (0.03 g, 54%) as white solid.
