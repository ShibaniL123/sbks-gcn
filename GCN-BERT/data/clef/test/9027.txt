Step 2
7-(Cyclopentylmethyl)-3-methyl-1-(4-(3-methylisoxazol-5-yl)butyl)-1H-purine-2,6(3H,7H)-dione
7-(Cyclopentylmethyl)-3-methyl-1H-purine-2,6(3H,7H)-dione (100 mg, 0.403 mmol), 5-(4-bromobutyl)-3-methylisoxazole (87.8 mg, 0.403 mmol) and potassium iodide (6.7 mg, 0.40 mmol) were dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide (5 mL), potassium carbonate (111 mg, 0.806 mmol) was added at 25°C. The reaction was heated to reflux at 130°C for 3 hours. The reaction solution was cooled to 25°C, filtered and the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting product was purified by preparative HPLC to give 7-(cyclopentylmethyl)-3-methyl-1-(4-(3-methylisoxazol-5-yl)butyl)-1H-purine-2,6(3H,7H)-dione (41.0 mg) with a yield of 26%.
