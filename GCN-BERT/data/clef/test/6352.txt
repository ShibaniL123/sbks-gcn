DEGASSING MODULE FOR A CONTROLLED COMPLIANT FLOW PATH CROSS REFERENCE [001] This application claims the priority of U.S. Application No. 13/757,717 filed on February 1, 2013, the entire contents thereof are incorporated herein by reference. FIELD OF THE INVENTION [002] This disclosure relates to a degassing module for use in fluid therapy systems and methods. The fluid therapies can include hemodialysis, ultrafiltration, hemofiltration, peritoneal dialysis or any therapy requiring degassing from a fluid used in the therapy. The degassing module can be used in connection with a controlled compliant flow path for preparing all fluids required for a fldui therapy session from water wherein the controlled compliant flow path modifies water into any one of a solution for priming a hemodialysis system, a physiologically compatible solution for contacting blood, a physiologically compatible solution for infusion to a subject, and a solution for blood rinse back to a subject. The systems can have a dialyzer, control components, dialysate regeneration cartridge and fluid reservoirs configured to be capable of operating free of infrastructure utilities required for a high volume of purified water source and sufficient drain. The systems and methods are configured to have a suitable weight and design to be carried by an individual including the patient. The systems and methods are simple and intuitive to operate and maintain such that the burden on the user and skill requirement is minimized. Moreover, the systems and methods are sufficiently compact such that little space is required for the device during storage or transport. BACKGROUND [003] Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), also known as chronic renal disease, may be a sudden or progressive loss in renal function. As the disease severity progresses, a patient with severe renal failure develops many symptoms that, if left untreated, eventually result in death. The most severe stage of CKD is End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD). ESRD, also referred to as kidney failure or renal failure, is the medical condition wherein a person’s kidneys fail to sufficiently remove toxins, waste products, and excess fluid, and to maintain proper electrolyte levels. [004] Current treatments for CKD seek to manage comorbidities and, if possible, slow the progression of the disease. However, as the disease progresses, renal function decreases and eventually renal replacement therapy is employed to compensate for lost kidney function. Renal replacement therapy typically entails transplantation of a new kidney, or dialysis. Kidney dialysis is a medical procedure that is performed to aid or replace some of the kidney functions in severe renal failure. Hemodialysis, hemofiltration, hemodiafiltration, and peritoneal dialysis are all replacement therapies for patients who have lost most or all of their kidney function. Dialysis can remove many of the toxins and wastes that the natural kidney would remove. In addition, these therapies are used to balance the electrolyte or blood salt levels and to remove excess fluid that accumulates in patients with renal failure. [005] Hemodialysis treatment can be performed to remove waste products from the blood that are no longer being effectively removed by the kidneys, such as urea, creatinine and phosphates. Although the population of patients afflicted with CKD grows each year, there is no cure. The excess fluid accumulated in patients suffering from renal failure is generally removed by the ultrafiltration action of a dialysis procedure. [006] Hemodialysis procedures in developed countries are usually carried out three times a week in three to five hour sessions. In some geographies, hemodialysis is less available and conducted less frequently. Dialysis emulates kidney function by removing waste solutes, excess electrolytes and excess fluid from a patient’s blood. During dialysis, the patient’s blood that contains a high concentration of waste solutes is exposed to a semi-permeable membrane in contact with a solute-deficient dialysis solution (dialysate). Solute removal and electrolyte balancing is accomplished via diffusion across the membrane. Fluid removal is accomplished via pressure-driven convective transport through the membrane, commonly referred to as ultrafiltration. Once the blood is purified, it is then returned to the patient. Although effective at removing wastes from blood, dialysis treatments are administered intermittently and therefore do not emulate the continuous function of a natural kidney. Moreover, there are many inconveniences associated with dialysis, such as the necessity of traveling to a dialysis center and committing to time consuming treatments multiple times per week. [007] Although hemodialysis removes excess fluid, interdialytic intervals of a hemodialysis schedule create variations in the patient’s waste removal, impurity removal, fluid removal and electrolyte balance. These variations result in patient complications and the high rates of patient morbidity and mortality. Since the mid-1990s a number of physicians have prescribed treatment regimens with increased dialysis frequency and treatment time to try to eliminate the problems associated with the thrice-weekly hemodialysis schedule. Two recent randomized controlled clinical studies have shown statistically significant benefits of a more frequent dialysis regimen. Culleton et αℓ. (Culleton, BF et αℓ. Effect of Frequent Nocturnal Flemodialysis vs. Conventional Flemodialysis on Left Ventricular Mass and Quality of Life. 2007 Journal of the American Medical Association 298 (11)) reported that when compared with conventional hemodialysis (trice weekly) daily nocturnal hemodialysis improved left ventricular mass (a surrogate for mortality), reduced the need for blood pressure medications and improved some measures of mineral metabolism. The FHN trial (The FHN Trial Group. In-Center Hemodialysis Six Times per Week versus Three Times per Week, New England Journal of Medicine, 2010) was a comparison of increased treatment frequency of 5.2 hemodialysis treatments a week compared with the traditional thrice-weekly regimen: “Frequent hemodialysis, as compared with conventional hemodialysis, was associated with favorable results with respect to the composite outcomes of death or change in left ventricular mass and death or change in a physical-health composite score.” Based on this data it would be desirable to have a hemodialysis system that would allow kidney patients to dialyze from five to seven days a week, if not continuously. [008] Despite the clinical results from the Culleton and FHN research, few patients presently undergo a higher frequency of dialysis treatment. More frequent hemodialysis is only used on a small part of the patient population due to the burden and cost of more frequent therapies. Even the thrice weekly-regime is a significant burden to ESRD patients, and an increase in treatment frequency can often be difficult due to the deficiencies in known devices and the cost of the additional treatments. Most dialysis is performed in a dialysis center; hence, there is a need for the practical implementation of more frequent hemodialysis using a simple, wearable/portable, and safe technology that can be used by a patient at home. [009] Typical home-dialysis equipment employs an amount of dialysis fluid greater than 20 liters, up to 120 liters or more, that must be produced by a dedicated water purification system. The typical requirement for large amounts of purified water creates a barrier in that stationary, expensive, and often architecturally incompatible water purification supply and drain systems must be connected to the plumbing. [010] A different water-related barrier to treatment exists in some developing regions of the world, in that infrastructure to produce the large volumes of purified water may not exist within feasible traveling distance for persons suffering from ESRD. Thus, a dialysis therapy system that does not require large volumes of purified water could increase availability of life-saving hemodialysis therapy for those suffering from ESRD in such regions. In such regions, a system that can provide dialysis therapy from just a few liters of potable or bottled drinking water is of special value. In developing regions, or even in developed regions suffering from natural disaster, a model for delivering life-saving hemodialysis therapy can be mobile dialysis units that can travel to the location where therapy is needed and provide the needed therapy. Equipment that is compact, lightweight, and free of requirements for large volumes of purified water, and not requiring a high ratio of skilled technicians per patient to operate the equipment is the equipment of choice for this therapy delivery modality. [011] The large volume of dialysate fluid required for dialysis is in part attributable to the large quantity of solution necessary for the diffusion of waste products removed and the balancing of electrolytes within the dialysate from the blood of a dialysis patient. Regeneration of spent dialysate is one way to reduce the total volume of a dialysis system by eliminating the need for a large reserve of fresh dialysate. However, existing technologies for regenerating spent dialysate have been met with various limitations. For example, the Recirculating Dialysate System (“REDY system”) may be subject to variations in pH and sodium concentrations that depart from physiological norms. Additionally, REDY systems have limited or no ability to remove sulfates, and may not be easily portable by the individual receiving therapy. [012] Development of dialysate recirculating techniques has resulted in systems that employ a variety of sorbent media, including activated carbon, urease, and zirconium-, aluminum-, and magnesium-based materials. Yet one of the problems associated with sorbent regeneration of spent dialysate is the buildup of sodium ions released as a byproduct of the adsorption process, thus necessitating a high degree of sodium concentration control which has yet to be achieved by currently available wearable or portable dialysis systems. [013] Some systems have attempted to address the volume and weight problems by allowing for external connections to a tap water source. However, the introduction of tap water into a dialysis system necessitates additional purification measures, thus adding to system complexity and size. As a result, such systems may not be useful for mobile or portable use. [014] Sorbent-based dialysate regeneration systems can be found in U.S. Patent No. 3,669,878 Marantz et αℓ., which describes sorbent removal of urea and ammonium ions from spent dialysate via urease, ammonium carbonate, and zirconium phosphate; U.S. 3,669,880 Marantz et αℓ., which describes directing a controlled volume of dialysate through zirconium phosphate, activated carbon, and hydrated zirconium oxide columns; U.S. 3,850,835 Marantz et αℓ., which describes production of a zirconium hydrous oxide ion exchange media; and U.S. 3,989,622 Marantz et αℓ., which describes adsorption of urease on aluminum oxide and magnesium silicate media to convert liquid urea to ammonium carbonate.

[018] There is a need for systems and/or methods that can simplify and automate these tasks for those individuals suffering from ESRD who are unable to access a dialysis centers, or who prefer not to. There is also a further need for expansion of hemodialysis therapy to individuals, or those living in developing regions where there is limited space available for the equipment at the home including those individuals suffering from ESRD who live in a single room shared by multiple individuals. [0019] In particular, there is a need to provide a system including a degas module for removing unwanted gas molecules from a circulating fluid before, during, and/or after a hymodialysis process.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Definitions [076] Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein generally have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the relevant art. The definitions provided herein should not be rigidly construed without taking into account the context and other ascribed meanings provided, or by their use, in other parts of the specification, claims, and drawings. [077] The articles “a” and “an” are used herein to refer to one or to more than one (i.e., to at least one) of the grammatical object of the article. By way of example, “an element” means one element or more than one element. [078] An “acid” can be either an Arrhenius acid, a Brpnsted-Lowry acid, or a Lewis acid. The Arrhenius acids are substances or fluids which increase the concentration of hydronium ions (Η30+) in solution. The Brpnsted-Lowry acid is a substance which can act as a proton donor. Lewis acids are electron-pair acceptors. [079] The term “cation infusate pump” historically known as an “acid concentrate pump”in dialysis systems refers to a pump that serves the function to move or control the flow of a fluid to and/or from a reservoir having a substance that contains at least one cation species, such as calcium, magnesium and potassium ions. In the present invention, the historically used term of “acid concentrate pump” is used. [080] The term “activated carbon” refers to a porous carbon material having a surface area greater than 500 m2 per gram. Activated carbon can be capable of absorbing several species including heavy metals such as lead, mercury, arsenic, cadmium, chromium and thallium among others, oxidants such as chlorine and chloramines, fluoride ions, and waste species such as phosphate and certain nitrogen-containing waste species such as creatinine and uric acid. [081] The terms “administering,” “administer,” “delivering,” and “deliver,” can be used in context to indicate the provision of water; aqueous solutions such as saline and dialysate that may contain salts acids, bases, and sugars; anticoagulant; or therapeutics such as erythropoietin and vitamins to a dialysate, dialysis circuit, or extracorporeal flow path where such water, or agent will enter the blood of the patient by diffusion, transversal of a diffusion membrane or other means. [082] The term “air trap” refers to a structure for separating a gas from a mixture of a gas and a liquid or any other separation means known in the art. An air trap can include a hydrophobic membrane for allowing gases to pass and for preventing the passage of water. [083] The term “albumin sieving coefficient” can be used to describe the amount of albumin that will cross a membrane. [084] The terms “ammonia sensing module” and “ammonia detector” refer to a unit that performs all or part of the function to detect a predetermined level of, or measure a concentration of, ammonia and/or ammonium ions in a fluid. [085] The term “anticoagulant” is a substance that prevents or delays the clotting of blood, such as heparin, Fragmin®, and sodium citrate. [086] The term “atmospheric pressure” refers to the local pressure of air in the environment in proximity to the system at the time that the system is operating. [087] A “base” can be either a substance that can accept hydrogen cations (protons) or more generally, donate a pair of valence electrons. A soluble base is referred to as an alkali if it contains and releases hydroxide ions (ΟΗ-) quantitatively. The Brpnsted-Lowry theory defines bases as proton (hydrogen ion) acceptors, while the more general Lewis theory defines bases as electron pair donors, allowing other Lewis acids than protons to be included.[l] The Arrhenius bases act as hydroxide anions, which is strictly applicable only to alkali. [088] The term “base module” refers to a basic unit of an apparatus for hemodialysis, hemodiafiltration, or hemofiltration that incorporates one or more fluid pathways. Exemplary, non-limiting components that can be included in the base module include conduits, valves, pumps, fluid connection ports, sensing devices, a controller and a user interface. The base module can be configured to interface with reusable or disposable modules of the apparatus for hemodialysis, hemodiafiltration, or hemofiltration to form at least one complete fluid circuit, such as a dialysis, cleaning, disinfection, priming or blood rinse back circuit. [089] The term “bicarbonate buffer component” refers to any composition contain bicarbonate (HC03-) ion or a conjugate acid of bicarbonate ion in any amount, proportion or pH of the composition. The bicarbonate buffering system is an important buffer system in the acidbase homeostasis of living things, including humans. As a buffer, it tends to maintain a relatively constant plasma pH and counteract any force that would alter it. In this system, carbon dioxide (C02) combines with water to form carbonic acid (H2C03), which in turn rapidly dissociates to form hydrogen ions and bicarbonate (HC03- ) as shown in the reactions below. The carbon dioxide - carbonic acid equilibrium is catalyzed by the enzyme carbonic anhydrase; the carbonic acid - bicarbonate equilibrium is simple proton dissociation/association and needs no catalyst. co2 + h2o h2co3 ^ hco~ + i-r Any disturbance of the system will be compensated by a shift in the chemical equilibrium according to Le Chatelier's principle. For example, if one attempted to acidify the blood by dumping in an excess of hydrogen ions (acidemia), some of those hydrogen ions will associate with bicarbonate, forming carbonic acid, resulting in a smaller net increase of acidity than otherwise. [090] The term “bicarbonate cartridge” refers to a container that can be a stand-alone container or alternatively can be integrally formed with an apparatus for hemodialysis, hemodiafiltration, or hemofiltration. The bicarbonate cartridge can store a source of buffering material, such as sodium bicarbonate, and can be configured to interface with at least one other functional module found in systems for hemodialysis, hemodiafiltration, or hemofiltration. For example, the bicarbonate cartridge can contain at least one fluid pathway and include components such as conduits, valves, filters or fluid connection ports. The bicarbonate cartridge can be disposable or be consumable wherein the cartridge is recharged upon depletion. Specifically, the term “bicarbonate consumables container” refers to an object or apparatus having or holding a material in solid and/or solution form that is a source of bicarbonate, such as sodium bicarbonate, that is depleted during operation of the system. The object or apparatus may be single use, or may be replenished and used multiple times, for example, by refilling the object to replace the consumed material. [091] The term “bidirectional pump” refers to a device configured to perform work on a fluid to cause the fluid to flow alternatively in either of two opposing directions. [092] A “biocompatible material” is a material that has the ability to interface with living biological tissues with an acceptable host response in any of specific medical systems, methods of treatment or delivery contemplated herein. The biocompatible material can consist of synthetic, natural or modified natural polymers intended to contact or interact with the biological systems during application of any of the inventions contained herein. [093] The term “blood access connection” refers to a junction or aperture through which the blood of a subject is conveyed to or from an extracorporeal circuit. Commonly, the blood access connection is made between a terminal end of a conduit of an extracorporeal circuit and the terminal end of a catheter or fistula needle that is distal to the subject receiving therapy. A subject may have more than one blood access connection when receiving therapy. In the case of two blood access connections they can be referred to as an arterial blood access connection and a venous blood access connection. [094] The term “blood rinse back” refers to returning the blood from a dialyzer and/or extracorporeal circuit to a subject, normally at conclusion of a therapy session and prior to disconnecting or removing the subject’s blood access connection or connections. The procedure can include conveying a physiologically compatible solution through the extracorporeal circuit to push or flush the blood from the extracorporeal circuit to the subject via the subject’s blood access connection or connections. [095] The term “bolus” refers to an increase (or at times a decrease) of limited duration in an amount or concentration of one or more solutes, for example sodium, glucose and potassium, or a solvent, for example water, such that the concentration of a solution is changed. The term “bolus” includes delivery of solute and/or solvent to the dialysate fluid path such that it is delivered to the blood of a subject via diffusion and/or convection across a dialysis membrane such that the amount or concentration in the subject is increased or decreased. A “bolus” may also be delivered directly to the extracorporeal flow path or the blood of a subject without first passing through the dialysis membrane. [096] The term “bottled water” refers to water that may be filtered or purified and has been packaged in a container. Bottled water can include water that has been packaged and provided to a consumer as drinking water. [097] The terms “bubble detector”, “bubble sensor”, “gas detector” and “air detector” refer to a device that can detect the presence of a void, void space, or gas bubble in a liquid.

The volume of fluid in the system is generally constant (unless additional fluids are added to a reservoir from outside of the system) once the system is in operation if the patient fluid volume(s), flow paths, and reservoirs are considered part of the total volume of the system (each individual volume may sometimes be referred to as a fluid compartment). The attached reservoirs allow the system to adjust the patient fluid volume by withdrawing fluid and storing the desired amount in an attached control reservoir and/or by providing purified and/or rebalanced fluids to the patient and optionally removing waste products. The terms “controlled compliance” and “controlled compliant” are not to be confused with the term “non-compliant volume,” which simply refers to a vessel, conduit, container, flow path, conditioning flow path or cartridge that resists the introduction of a volume of fluid after air has been removed from a defined space such as a vessel, conduit, container, flow path, conditioning flow path or cartridge.

[0151] “Dialysis” is a type of filtration, or a process of selective diffusion through a membrane. Dialysis removes solutes of a specific range of molecular weights via diffusion through a membrane from a fluid to be dialyzed into a dialysate. During dialysis, a fluid to be dialyzed is passed over a filter membrane, while dialysate is passed over the other side of that membrane. Dissolved solutes are transported across the filter membrane by diffusion between the fluids. The dialysate is used to remove or add solutes from the fluid to be dialyzed. The dialysate can also provide enrichment to the other fluid.

A flow loop comprises a route or a collection of routes for a fluid to move within. Within a flow loop there may be more than one route that a volume of fluid can follow to move from one position to another position. A fluid volume may move through a flow loop such that it recirculates, or passes the same position more than once as it moves through a flow loop. A flow loop may operate to cause fluid volume ingress to and fluid volume egress from the flow loop. The term “flow loop” and “flow path” often may be used interchangeably. [0179] The term “flow path” refers to a route or a collection of routes for a fluid to move within. Within a flow path there may be more than one route that a fluid can follow to move from a first position to a second position.

[0184] The term “fluid port” refers to an aperture through which a liquid or gas can be conveyed. [0185] The term “fluid port cap or plug” refers to a device that can be connected to a fluid port to prevent fluid from passing through the fluid port. A fluid cap or plug may be configured into an apparatus having multiple caps or plugs to prevent fluid from passing through multiple fluid ports when the apparatus is connected to the multiple fluid ports.

[0189] “Gas phase pressure” also known as “vapor” is the equilibrium pressure from a liquid or a solid at a specific temperature. If the vapor is in contact with a liquid or solid phase, the two phases will be in a state of equilibrium. [0190] “Hemodiafiltration” is a therapy that combines hemofiltration and hemodialysis. [0191] “Hemodialysis” is a technique where blood and a “cleansing fluid” called dialysate are exposed to each other separated by a semi-permeable membrane. Solutes within the permeability range of the membrane pass while diffusing along existing concentration gradients. Water and solutes are also transferred by convection across a pressure gradient that may exist across the dialysis membrane. The dialysate employed during hemodialysis has soluble ions such as sodium, calcium and potassium ions and is not pure water. The sieving properties of the membrane exclude certain solutes above a certain threshold from crossing the membrane. One common sieving property is “albumin sieving.” In most situations it is not desirable to remove albumin during renal replacement therapy, as lower blood serum albumin is associated with increased mortality rates. [0192] The term “hemofilter” refers to a apparatus (or may refer to a filter) used in hemofiltration. A hemofilter apparatus can be connected to an extracorporeal circuit and configured to operate with a semipermeable membrane that separates at least a portion of the fluid volume from blood to produce a filtrate fluid. [0193] “Hemofiltration” is a therapy in which blood is filtered across a semi-permeable membrane. Water and solutes are removed from the blood via pressure-driven convection across the membrane. The sieving properties of the membrane exclude certain solutes above a certain threshold from crossing the membrane. One common sieving property is “albumin sieving.” In most situations it is not desirable to remove albumin during renal replacement therapy, as lower blood serum albumin is associated with increased mortality rates. In hemofiltration, solutes small enough to pass through the membrane in proportion to their plasma concentration are removed. The driving force is a pressure gradient rather than a concentration gradient. A positive hydrostatic pressure drives water and solutes across the filter membrane from the blood compartment to the filtrate compartment, from which it is drained. Solutes, both small and large, get dragged through the membrane at a similar rate by the flow of water that has been engineered by the hydrostatic pressure. Hence, convection overcomes the reduced removal rate of larger solutes (due to their slow speed of diffusion) observed in hemodialysis. The rate of solute removal is proportional to the amount of fluid removed from the blood circuit, which can be adjusted to meet the needs of a clinical situation. In general, the removal of large amounts of plasma water from the patient requires volume substitution. Substitution fluid, typically a buffered solution close to the plasma water composition a patient needs, can be administered pre or post filter (pre-dilution mode, post-dilution mode). [0194] The term “hydrophobic membrane” refers to a semipermeable porous material that may allow gas phases of matter to pass through, but which substantially resists the flow of water through the material due to the surface interaction between the water and the hydrophobic material. [0195] The terms “hydrophobic vent” and “hydrophobic vent membrane” refer to a porous material layer or covering that can resist the passage of a liquid such as water through the pores while allowing the passage of a gas. The pores may also be of a sufficiently small size to substantially prevent the passage of microorganisms. [0196] The term “impedance meter” refers to a device for measuring the opposition of an object or structure to an alternating current. [0197] The terms “impurity” or “impurity species” refer to a molecular or ionic species that originates from tap water, a sorbent cartridge, a source other than a patient’s or the subject’s blood including, for example, but limited to chlorine, fluoride ions, and aluminum-containing species.

The presence of a volume of fluid less than the maximum amount will fail to completely fill the vessel or container. Once a substantially inflexible volume has been filled with a fluid, removal of fluid from that volume will create a negative pressure that resists fluid removal unless fluid is added and removed simultaneously at substantially equal rates. Those skilled in the art will recognize that a minimal amount of expansion or contraction of the vessel or container can occur in a substantially inflexible volume; however, the addition or subtraction of a significant volume of fluid over a maximum or minimum will be resisted.

[0278] The term “ultrafiltrate” refers to fluid that is removed from a subject by convection through a permeable membrane during hemodialysis, hemofiltration, hemodiafiltration, or peritoneal dialysis. The term “ultrafiltrate,” as used herein, can also refer to the fluid in a reservoir that collects fluid volume removed from the patient, but such a reservoir may also include fluids or collections of fluids that do not originate from the subject. [0279] The term "ultrafiltration" refers to subjecting a fluid to filtration, where the filtered material is very small; typically, the fluid comprises colloidal, dissolved solutes or very fine solid materials, and the filter is a microporous, nanoporous, or semi-permeable medium. A typical medium is a membrane. During ultrafiltration, a “filtrate” or “ultrafiltrate” that passes through the filter medium is separated from a feed fluid. In certain instances, the use of the term “filtrate” can refer to the fluid generated during hemofiltration. In general, when transport across a membrane is predominantly diffusive as a result of a concentration driving force, the process is described herein as dialysis.

[0296] In certain embodiments, the therapy disposable and consumable components can be advantageously configured into subgroupings to be installed on a base module, or even configured as individual components to be installed on a base module. When installed onto the base module, the flow paths contained within individual or subgrouped components combine with the base module to form a completed controlled compliance dialysate fluid circuit for hemodialysis, hemodiafiltration, or hemofiltration. Such configurations can be advantageous when it is desired to customize a therapy setup, for example, to use a particular dialyzer or acid concentrate solution; or where economic preference favors re-use of certain components, such as in the case of refilling of a bicarbonate consumables container. [0297] The system prepares its own priming solution and conducts priming of the dialysate and extracorporeal flow paths automatically. A separate supply of packaged or prepared sterile saline is not required for priming, fluid bolus, or blood rinse back when using this system. In certain embodiments, normal saline is around 0.9% by weight and is commonly used for priming dialyzers and extracorporeal circuits is 154mEq/L. Certain portions of the dialysate circuit are re-used and routine cleaning and disinfection maintenance of this fluid circuit is performed automatically with a simple cleaning manifold. The system can be configured so that the cleaning manifold is stored and transported in-situ and without opening the disinfected flow path. The system can also be configured with design features that enable it to fold into a small, self-protective form that may be readily transported by the user. In some embodiments, the space required for stowed transport or stationary storage is compatible with airline carry-on luggage size allowances. For example, in some, non-limiting embodiments, weights of less than 15 kilograms and stowed configurations of less 40 liters volume are contemplated by the present invention. [0298] In the described controlled compliant flow path of the present invention, net passive movement of fluid volume across the dialysis membrane due to operational pressure changes is eliminated. The invention provides for the ability to accurately control net patient fluid removal, and/or diffusive clearance combined with increased clearance via convection, and/or active provisioning of extra fluid to a patient. The system allows priming of the controlled compliant flow path and extracorporeal flow path, a fluid bolus, or the return of blood from the system back to the patient without requirement to provide for additional fluids from a separate source. The invention can actively provide fluid to the patient when the patient becomes hypotensive or hypovolemic, and can displace the internal volume of a blood circuit with a physiological solution when a patient is taken off a system. The invention can also provide for actively enhanced convective clearance by alternately varying the rate and/or direction of the fluid balance control pump. Any combination of the above mentioned features is contemplated by the invention. The system can optionally account for an infusate volume, provide additional convective clearance, and/or provide control of the entire process. The controlled compliant flow path can have one or more means for selectively metering fluid into and out of the controlled compliant flow path. The means can be any one of control pump, a water pump, a salination pump, an acid concentrate pump, and combinations thereof and, in some cases, a replacement fluid pump. The described controlled compliant flow path also simplifies the entire system. Specifically, balance chambers, scales or gravimetric control methods are not required to balance fluid removal with fluid replacement. [0299] FIG. 1 shows a system for circulating blood and a dialysate through a dialyzer 701. A shunt such as a needle or catheter is connected to a patient’s vasculature to draw blood and circulate the patient’s blood through an extracorporeal flow path 100. The portion of the extracorporeal flow path 100 that contains drawn blood from the patient can be referred to as the arterial line 102, which by convention is understood to mean a line for transporting blood from the patient regardless of whether blood is drawn from an artery or vein of the patient. Similarly, the portion that returns blood to the patient can be referred to as the venous line 105. In certain embodiments, the arterial line 102 and the venous line 105 connect with one or more veins of the patient. Locomotive power for moving the blood through the extracorporeal flow path 100 is provided by a blood pump 302, which is typically located along the arterial 102 line. Blood is typically conveyed through the extracorporeal flow path 100 at a rate of 50 to 600 mL/min and can be adjusted by a controller to any required rate suitable for a procedure performed by the invention. Blood pump 302 can be a peristaltic pump, although those skilled in the art will readily understand that other types of pumps can be used including diaphragm pumps, centrifugal pumps, and shuttle pumps. In certain embodiments, the blood pump 302 conveys blood through the dialyzer 701 where the blood is contacted with a blood side of a dialysis membrane 702. Blood enters the dialyzer 701 through a blood inlet 504 and exits through a blood outlet 505. The pressure of the blood prior to the blood pump 302 is measured by a pressure sensor 602 and post dialyzer 701 by a pressure sensor 604. The pressure at pressure sensor 602 provides an indication of the adequacy of the blood flow in the arterial line connected to the blood pump 302 inlet and a low or excessively negative pressure relative to atmosphere is an indication of a less adequate access flow that may cause the flow rate produced by blood pump 302 to be unacceptably below the set point flow rate. The pressure indication at pressure sensor 604 can serve to detect obstructions in the venous bloodline and to monitor transmembrane pressure within dialyzer 701. An air trap 707 is placed along the extracorporeal flow path 100 to prevent the introduction of air into the circulatory system of the patient. The air trap 707 is not limited to a particular design. Typical air traps can be drip chambers with an air space that employ a hydrophobic membrane that allows air to pass through the membrane while retaining water-based fluids. Alternatively the air trap 707 can be a chamber that is run full of fluid and which traps any air at a point of greatest elevation and exchanges air via a hydrophobic membrane, such that there is no direct air blood interface. Air-fluid detectors, or bubble detectors 601 and 603 are present to confirm that air is not present in the extracorporeal flow path 100. In some embodiments, air fluid detectors 601 and 603 can be ultrasonic sensors that can detect a change in solution density or scattering due the presence of air or air bubbles. [0300] Valve 402 controls flow into or out of the arterial line 102 of extracorporeal flow path 100. Valve 401 controls flow into or out of the venous line 105 of extracorporeal flow path 100. Valves 401 and 402 may be pinch valves that control flow by non-invasively squeezing the exterior of the extracorporeal flow path to occlude the tubing to prevent flow. Occluding tubing in this manner refers to collapsing the tubing such that the inner lumen of the tubing is closed and flow is prevented from passing through collapsed portion. Other valves, such as diaphragm valves that cause a moving or flexible member to block a flow orifice can also serve this function. [0301] Patient blood access sites are individualized; access types include catheters, grafts and fistulas; and blood access procedures may vary between patients. Any blood access type or method can be used and is non-specific to the present invention. Line 104 indicates the arterial or supply portion of a patient’s blood access and could be a fistula needle or catheter. Line 103 indicates the venous, or return portion of the patient’s blood access and could be a fistula needle or catheter. [0302] The patient’s arterial blood access line 104 is connected to the arterial line 102 of the extracorporeal flow path 100 at connection point 502. A non-limiting example of such a connector is a luer connector. Similarly, the patient’s venous blood access line 103 is connected to the venous line 105 of extracorporeal flow path 100 at connection point 501. [0303] Drawing of blood samples and administration of therapeutic substances via the extracorporeal flow path 100 is contemplated by this invention. Any therapeutic substances that can be administered via the blood through extracorporeal flow path 100 such as erythropoietin, iron, and vitamin D may be administered to the patient during dialysis therapy through venous port 503. Further, blood samples may be withdrawn from the extracorporeal flow path 100 at arterial port 525 or venous port 503. A non-limiting partial list of port designs may include capped luer, petcocks, button membranes, and pre-split needle-free wherein one of ordinary skill will understand that port designs in the art may be employed without departing from the scope of the invention [0304] During the course of conveyance of blood along the extracorporeal flow path 100, heparin or other anticoagulant is added to the blood to prevent clotting of blood within the dialyzer 701 or blood conveyance pathway/extracorporeal flow path 100. Heparin or another anticoagulant is added from an anticoagulant container such as a syringe at a metered rate using an anticoagulant pump 301. The anticoagulant pump 301 can be any pump capable of accurately metering the anticoagulant. [0305] Water reservoir 202 holds a small volume of water that is used to create the solution used for system priming, dialysis therapy, provision of fluid bolus, blood rinse back and system cleaning and disinfection. The water reservoir 202 may be filled with potable tap water by the user. Alternatively, the water reservoir 202 may be filled with bottled drinking water if potable water or other suitable types of water are not available. Purified water may also be used. Further, water reservoir 202 may be the container of bottled drinking water itself. Other types of water suitable for use in dialysis systems including hemofiltration, hemodiafiltration and peritoneal dialysis are contemplated by the present invention. One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that it is possible to bypass water reservoir 202 and connect a potable water source directly to port 510S as shown in Fig. 5C. Degassing and De-aeration of Water Supply [0306] The water source used to supply water reservoir 202 may have significant amounts of dissolved gasses that could be released from solution inside the controlled compliant flow path 110 to create air pockets that degrade performance of the system. Dissolved gasses may include the gaseous constituents of air such as nitrogen, oxygen and carbon dioxide. As detailed in FIG. 1C, the invention has a water degassing, or de-aeration circuit that can optionally be employed to remove dissolved gasses from the water in reservoir 202 prior to mixing solution and priming the fluid circuits. The arrows in FIG. 1C depict the direction of flow during the de-aeration process. During de-aeration, fluid intake bypass valve 404 is positioned to allow pump 305 to withdraw fluid from water reservoir 202 through intake line 113 and flow restriction 408 and heater 708. De-aeration of the water can be accomplished without having heater 708 located in the de-aeration flow path and therefore heater 708 and heating of the fluid can be considered optional to de-aeration. Pump 304 is a positive displacement pump that is not operated during this phase of operation and no flow passes through pump 304. De-aeration bypass valve 405 is positioned or set to direct flow from the outlet of dialysate pump 305 through de-aeration bypass conduit 112 to line 114 and back into water reservoir 202. Flow restriction 408 is sized such that when the dialysate pump 305 is operated at a predetermined rate, the pressure of fluid flowing through the restriction 408 drops to a low absolute pressure causing dissolved air to be released from solution and form gas bubbles. Non-limiting examples of flow restrictions are orifices, venturis, or narrow tubes. Heater 708 can optionally be operated to increase the temperature of the fluid which further reduces the solubility of air in water, enhancing the de-aeration process. As the fluid is recirculated in the de-aeration loop shown in FIG. 1C, air bubbles are released from solution and returned to water reservoir 202 through lines 112 and 114, where they rise to the surface of the fluid in water reservoir 202 and are exhausted from water reservoir 202 through vent opening 512. The de-aeration process recirculates the water for a predetermined time sufficient to de-aerate the water and, optionally, until no more bubbles are detected in the water flowing past bubble detector 608. [0307] Referring again to FIG 1, dialysate within the system is conveyed through one of a first recirculating dialysate pathway or controlled compliant flow path 110 which carries dialysate from outlet port 507 of dialyzer 701 in a complete loop back to inlet port 506 of dialyzer 701, or a bypass flow path 111, which serves to bypass the dialyzer 701 during certain system functions. The controlled compliant flow path 110 can contain dialysate in certain embodiments, and be referred to as a solution conduit flow path. Bypass flow path 111 may be referred to as a priming or recirculation bypass in certain embodiments as described further herein. The controlled compliant flow path 110 and bypass flow path 111 have one or more conduits for conveying the dialysate. Flow is controlled to go through the controlled compliant flow path 110 or bypass flow path 111 by means of bypass valve 407. It is understood by one skilled in the art that three-way valve 407 can be replaced by two-way valves with the same result to control the flow through the dialyzer 701 or bypass flow path 111. [0308] Dialysate that is conveyed through the dialyzer 701 on the dialysate side of the dialysis membrane 702 picks up waste products from the blood, including urea, by diffusion, ultrafiltration, hemofiltration or hemodiafiltration. Dialysate enters the dialyzer at a dialysate inlet end 506 and exits at an outlet end 507. The dialysate exiting the dialyzer 701 passes through a blood leak detector 605 that can determine the presence of blood in the dialysate indicating a breach in the dialysis membrane 702. [0309] Valve 403 passes flow in only one direction such that fluid may not enter the dialyzer 701 through the outlet port 507, but may only enter the dialyzer through inlet port 506, having first flowed through microbial filter 706. In other embodiments, the valve 403 may be a 2-way valve under active control, or a 3-way valve under active control allowing fluid back to the dialyzer 701 and positioned at junction 526. Microbial filter 706 removes residual bacteria and endotoxin from the dialysate, such that dialyzer membrane 702 becomes a redundant microbial barrier between the dialysate and the blood. In other embodiments, the microbial filter 706 can be placed in any portion of a flow path (not shown) to minimize system contamination. Suitable microbial filters include commercially available hollow fiber ultrafilters having a membrane pore size sufficiently small to exclude passage of both microbes and endotoxins and other such suitable filters known to those of ordinary skill in the art. [0310] The dialysate is conveyed through heater 708 to heat the dialysate to the prescribed dialysate temperature. Dialysate pump 305 provides the pumping action to cause the dialysate to flow through the controlled compliant flow path 110, which can re-circulate dialysate. Flow rate sensor 609 measures dialysate flow rate for closed loop control of dialysate pump 305 and/or measurement of dialysate flow rate to enable control of infusate metering at a controlled ratio to the dialysate flow. In certain embodiments dialysate pump 305 can be a positive displacement metering pump and flow rate sensor 609 can be an optional sensor. Pressure sensor 610 measures pressure of the dialysate before inlet port 513 of sorbent cartridge 703. The sorbent cartridge can be a disposable cartridge assembly that is disposed after use, a system of individual material containers, or a re-usable container that has contents that can be opened and the contents replaced as needed. [0311] Sorbent cartridge 703 removes waste products from the dialysate before the dialysate is re-conveyed through the dialyzer 701. The dialysate enters the sorbent cartridge 703 at a dialysate inlet end 513 and exits at an outlet end 514. [0312] In one non-limiting embodiment a static mixer 704 serves to ensure that concentrates added to the dialysate are thoroughly mixed before solution characteristics such as conductivity are measured. In any embodiment, if sufficient mixing of infusate and dialysate is obtained without employing a static mixer, then the static mixer 704 may be considered to be optional in that embodiment. Degassing and De-aeration During Priming [0313] In certain embodiments, a degassing module 705 removes air during system priming as well as gasses, such as carbon dioxide, introduced into the dialysate by the sorbent cartridge 703. Referring to Fig. 16, a schematic of a degassing module 705 is shown having an upper port 516 that is a fluid inlet port, a lower port 519 that is a fluid outlet port, a hydrophobic vent membrane 710 separating a flow through chamber 220, and a space that is referred to as a gas collection chamber 221. Gas collection chamber 221 has a vent port 517 in communication with gas outlet port 518, which is in communication with the atmosphere. Vent control valve 410 can be operated to selectively permit gas to flow between gas collection chamber 221 and the atmosphere, and, when vent control valve 410 is open, the pressure in gas collection chamber 221 is equal to atmospheric pressure. When vent control valve 410 is open, direction of gas flow depends upon the relative pressure difference between chambers 220 and atmosphere. If valve 410 is open and chamber 220 has a pressure greater than atmospheric, any gas in chamber 220 that has risen to contact hydrophobic vent membrane 710 will be forced through hydrophobic vent membrane 710 and will be passed through gas collection chamber 221 and flow out to atmosphere through gas outlet port 518. Conversely, if valve 410 is open and flow through chamber 220 has a pressure less than atmospheric, air in contact with vent membrane 710 will be forced through hydrophobic vent membrane 710 and will enter flow through chamber 220. During normal operation, the degassing module can be operated with a fluid pressure in flow through chamber 220 that is greater than atmospheric to ensure that gas that has risen to contact hydrophobic vent membrane 710 will be exhausted from flow through chamber 220. Degassing module 705 can be located in the controlled compliant flow path 110 between pump 305 and dialyzer inlet port 506 as shown in embodiments depicted in Fig’s 1 and IE, and between pump 305 and replacement fluid port 538 on the venous line 105 of extracorporeal circuit 100, as shown the embodiment depicted in Fig. ID. Other positions are possible in the present invention suitable for the intended purposes of degassing the system. The system can be normally operated with fluid pressures at ports 506 and 538 that are greater than atmosphere and therefore the pressure inside degassing module 705 flow through chamber 220 will be greater than atmospheric also, thus causing any gas contacting hydrophobic vent membrane 710 to pass through hydrophobic vent membrane 710 to atmosphere. Fluid pressure at pressure sensor 606 in the case of the embodiments depicted in Fig.’s 1 and IE, or fluid pressure at pressure sensor 604 in the embodiment depicted in Fig. ID can be monitored and, if the pressure drops to less than a predetermined amount greater than atmospheric, for example less than 25 mm mercury above atmospheric, vent control valve 410 can be closed to prevent air ingress to degassing module 705. In certain embodiments, a flow restriction 409 is present in bypass flow path 111, as needed, to ensure that sufficient back pressure remains in the main controlled compliant flow path 110 to maintain adequate pressure inside the degassing module 705 flow through chamber 220 relative to atmospheric pressure during operations where the dialysate flow is switched to bypass the dialyzer 701 through bypass flow path 111. Flow restriction 409 may be an orifice, a venture, tubing with sufficiently small inside diameter to create the necessary restriction, an actuated restrictor, such as a pinch valve that compresses the tubing to constrict the flow passing through bypass flow path 111, or any suitable element that sufficiently restricts the fluid flow to maintain the desired fluid pressure upstream of the restriction. [0314] The dialysate flow inlet 516 in Fig. 16 is placed at a higher elevation than the dialysate outlet 519 so that the dialysate or fluid in the system flows in a downward direction through the module. It is a known phenomenon that gas bubbles rise rates in aqueous solutions increase as the diameter of the gas bubble increases wherein gas bubble rising rates are known in the published literature. This principle can be applied to separate the gas bubbles from the liquid to ensure that the bubbles do not pass out of flow through chamber 220 through fluid outlet port 519. The maximum fluid flow rate that will pass through the degassing module 705 flow through chamber 220 can be determined wherein the cross sectional area of the chamber is selected such that the downward flow velocity of the dialysate is less than the upward rise velocity of the smallest bubble that the module is intended to capture. [0315] In one embodiment, the degassing module has a flow-through chamber 220 having a hydrophobic vent membrane 710 forming an upper portion of the flow chamber 220. The minimum elevation requirement for the location of the vent membrane is that it has an elevation greater than the fluid outlet port 519. The hydrophobic vent membrane 710 has a sufficient permeability and the surface area of hydrophobic vent membrane that is exposed to both chamber 220 and chamber 221 is sufficiently large to enable a flow of gas that is rising to the top of flow through chamber 220 to contact hydrophobic vent membrane 710 will be caused to flow through hydrophobic vent membrane 710 to gas collection chamber 221 by the pressure differential between the fluid in flow through chamber 220 and the atmosphere. The hydrophobic vent membrane 710 is further required to have a sufficient water break through pressure, for example greater than 2 bar, so that liquid water does not pass from flow through chamber 220 through hydrophobic vent membrane 710 to gas collection chamber 221. Persons of skill in the art will be able to determine the range of operating pressures for flow through chamber 220 and a desired rate of gas removal from flow through chamber 220 to determine a combination of membrane permeability and exposed membrane surface area that is required for a particular application. An example of a commercially available membrane that can be suitable for a degassing module is Pall Corporation 0.2 micron pore size F.mflon® part number PTFE020LF0A. [0316] Vent control valve 410 is opened to permit gas flow to atmosphere when the degassing module 705 is being operated to remove gas from the dialysate. Vent control valve 410 is closed to prevent air entry into the controlled compliant flow path through the hydrophobic vent membrane during certain operating functions of the system that may cause the dialysate pressure in the degassing module 705 to drop below atmospheric and undesirably pull air into the system. Vent control valve 410 is opened during other system functions where the dialysate pressure within degassing module 705 is below atmospheric pressure and it is desirable to allow air to enter the controlled compliant flow path through the hydrophobic vent membrane at gas outlet port 518, for example when fluid is being drained from the controlled compliant flow path. [0317] In Fig. 17, an embodiment of a degassing module 705 is shown that has fluid inlet port 516 at a lower elevation in flow through chamber 220 than fluid outlet port 519. The present design can be used if a flow cross section of the flow through chamber 220 is sufficiently large that, at a maximum fluid flow rate for the degassing module, a fluid transit time from fluid inlet port 516 to fluid outlet port 519 is sufficiently long so that the smallest bubble that the degassing module is intended to capture will rise at least by the amount of an elevation difference 150 and will rise above the elevation of fluid outlet port 519 during the elapsed fluid transit time from fluid inlet port 516 to fluid outlet port 519. [0318] Fig. 18 shows images from an embodiment of degassing module 705. The left hand view is an isometric view of the exterior of the degassing module. The right hand view is a section through a plane that passes through the axis of fluid inlet port 516 and the axis of fluid outlet port 519. The embodiment has a body 715 that houses the flow through chamber 220. The hydrophobic vent membrane 710 is shown in contact with the cover 716. The surface of cover 716 that contacts hydrophobic vent membrane 710 has a plurality of intersecting grooves that form gas collection chamber 221 and allow the gas to flow to vent port 517. Also shown is an o-ring seal 835 that serves to prevent fluid leakage from the seam between body 715 and cover 716. The methods of seal and attachment are exemplary and non-limiting, as those of skill in the art will recognize that there are many methods to attach cover 716 to body 715 and form a leak tight seal, for example adhesive bonding, ultrasonic bonding and overmolding. The shown o-ring seals 836 can provide fluid seals between fluid ports 516 and 519 and their mating ports of the base module. Again, the seal 836 and geometry of ports 516 and 519 are exemplary and non-limiting, as those of skill in the art will recognize that there are many suitable seals, for example Q-rings, double seals, lip seals and face seals, and many fluid port geometries, for example luer connectors, Hansen connectors, and push to connect tube fittings. [0319] Other types of degassing modules may be employed, such as parallel or wound hollow fiber assemblies. With these devices, a vacuum may be applied to the gas side of the module to draw dissolved gas from solution in addition to removing gas bubbles. Non-limiting examples of dissolved gasses include nitrogen, oxygen and carbon dioxide. If the gas being removed is carbon dioxide, the pH of the dialysate can be increased without adding buffer, or by addition of less buffer. [0320] Another type of degassing module that can be employed has a float that causes a seal to be pressed against an escape orifice when the chamber is full, or nearly full of liquid. When the chamber has trapped a quantity of gas sufficient to cause the liquid level to drop so that the float no longer presses the seal onto the orifice, gas is allowed to escape from the chamber. Microbial contamination of the fluid can be prevented by placing a microbial vent filter over the chamber outlet opening to atmosphere. [0321] In one non-limiting embodiment, the dialysate can flow through or across the ammonia sensor 611 that detects a potentially hazardous condition where the ammonia byproduct of urea breakdown escapes from sorbent column 703. The ammonia sensor may use optical methods to detect a color change of ammonia and/or ammonium sensitive media contained within sensor 611. If ammonia and/or ammonium are detected, control action switches bypass valve 407 to direct dialysate flow to bypass flow path 111 and prevent out of tolerance dialysate from passing through the dialyzer 701. Further, one-way valve 403 prevents the ammonia and/or ammonium bearing dialysate from backing up into the dialyzer 701. As such, the dialysate can be circulated through the sorbent cartridge 703 while bypassing the dialyzer 701 and preventing contact with the patient’s blood when required. [0322] Temperature sensor 612 measures the temperature of the dialysate to verify that it is within the predetermined temperature limits before passing through dialyzer 701. If the temperature is out of tolerance, control action switches bypass valve 407 to direct dialysate flow to bypass flow path 111 and prevent out of tolerance dialysate from passing through the dialyzer 701 and further recirculated until the dialysate temperature is within acceptable limits. Temperature sensor 612 may also be used for closed loop control of dialysate temperature by action of the controller and heater. Refreshed dialysate exiting an outlet end of the sorbent cartridge 703 can be monitored by a conductivity sensor 613. The design of any conductivity sensor employed in embodiments described herein is not particularly limited; however, a typical conductivity sensor has two electrodes where a current between the two electrodes is monitored. The presence of sodium ions in the dialysate is the major contributor to the conductivity measured by conductivity sensor 613. Conductivity is continually monitored and reported to the controller to assess the quality and safety of the dialysate. When the conductivity of the dialysate falls within a predetermined range, the dialysate is directed by valve 407 to a dialysate inlet end 506 of the dialyzer 701; the valve 407 is located between an outlet end 514 of the sorbent cartridge 703 and the dialysate inlet end 506 of the dialyzer 701. In certain embodiments, the valve 407 is a three-way valve. The control action of valve 407 can also be accomplished by a pair of 2-way valves. [0323] When the conductivity measured by conductivity sensor 613 is outside of the predetermined range, the valve 407 can direct the dialysate to be conveyed through the bypass flow path 111 and bypass the dialyzer 701. Further, one-way valve 403 prevents the dialysate from backing up into the dialyzer 701. As such, the dialysate can be circulated through the sorbent cartridge 703 while bypassing the dialyzer 701 and preventing contact with the patient’s blood until the sodium has been adjusted by control action of the system. The system reduces sodium concentration within the controlled volume dialysate circuit by simultaneously operating water pump 304 to add water from water reservoir 202 while simultaneously operating fluid balance control pump 303 to remove an equal volume of dialysate by pumping it to solutions reservoir 201. If conductivity is low, the system can increase sodium concentration by switching salination valve 406 to direct flow through a sodium conduit flow path in fluid communication with sodium chloride cartridge 203 and pump saturated sodium solution into the dialysate by pumping and metering action of salination pump 307. [0324] The dialysate is filtered through a microbial filter 706 before passing into dialyzer 701 through inlet 506. Sorbent cartridge 703 performs a high degree of bacterial and endotoxin removal from the solution and the microbial filter 706 further removes residual bacteria and endotoxin such that the resulting solution is capable of meeting the microbial purity standard for ultrapure dialysate and dialyzer membrane 702 becomes a redundant barrier to passage of bacteria from the dialysate compartment to the blood compartment by solution that is transferred across dialysis membrane 702. [0325] Typically, the output of the sorbent cartridge in prior art sorbent systems meets the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation’s (AAMI) Water for Hemodialysis standard but does not meet the AAMI standard for microbiologically ultrapure dialysate. It has been shown in the medical literature that ultrapure dialysate is desirable in reducing the inflammatory response in the ESRD patient. Desirable quality for ultrapure dialysate is less than about 0.1 colony forming unit (cfu)/mL where cfu is the number of viable cells per unit volume, and detectable endotoxins less than about 0.03 endotoxin unit (EU/mL). Suitable filters include ultrafilters and micro filters manufactured or supplied by Medica, however any known by those of ordinary skill for the intended purpose can be used. [0326] The pressure of the dialysate entering the dialysate inlet end of the dialyzer 701 can be measured by a pressure sensor 606. [0327] The components forming the controlled compliant flow path 110 can have a controlled compliant volume wherein the controlled compliant flow path 110 further incorporates a control pump such as fluid balance control pump 303 that can be operated bi-directionally to cause the net movement of fluid from an extracorporeal side of the dialyzer 701 into the controlled compliant flow path 110 or to cause net movement of fluid from the controlled compliant flow path 110 into the extracorporeal side of the dialyzer 701. In particular, the control pump 303 or any such similar pump can be operated in the efflux direction to cause the movement of fluid from the extracorporeal side of the dialyzer 701 into the controlled compliant flow path 110 and in the influx direction to cause the movement of fluid from the controlled compliant flow path 110 into the extracorporeal side of the dialyzer 701. In this manner, the net volume of fluid crossing the dialysate membrane 702 between the dialysate compartment and the blood compartment can be under direct control and can be accurately determined. [0328] In certain embodiments, operation of the control pump 303 in the influx direction to drive liquid into the controlled compliant flow path 110 and subsequently cause movement of fluid from the controlled compliant flow path 110 to the extracorporeal side of the dialyzer 701. The control pump 303 can also be used for the movement of fluid in the opposite direction across the dialyzer 701 into the controlled compliant flow path 110. It is noted that the solution reservoir 201 or any other suitable reservoir attached to the controlled compliant flow path 110 can allow the system to adjust the patient fluid volume by withdrawing fluid and storing the desired amount in the respective reservoir and/or by providing rebalanced fluids to the patient and removing waste products. For example, the fluid stored in a solution reservoir 201 attached to the controlled compliant flow path can be used to store a volume of fluid equal to the ultrafiltrate volume removed from the patient during ultrafiltration (UF). Alternatively, the fluid stored in any fluid reservoir attached to the controlled compliant flow path 110 can contain a desired infusate. In certain embodiments, the delivered fluid can contain a therapeutic component deliverable across the dialyzer 701 and into the patient’s bloodstream. Additionally, the volume of the controlled compliant flow path 110 can be actively controlled by the user or a programmed controller. [0329] In certain embodiments, the control pump 303 can allow for fluid to move from the controlled compliant flow path 110 to the extracorporeal side without creating a vacuum, wherein the operation of the control pump 303 is controlled as described herein. Likewise, the control pump 303 can allow for fluid to move from the extracorporeal side, and hence the patient’s body via the action of the pumps. The net movement of fluid between the extracorporeal side of the dialyzer 701 and the controlled compliant flow path 110 can be accurately controlled and metered using the removed fluid in certain embodiments. In other embodiments, the removed fluid can be transferred back to the patient through controlled compliant flow path 110 using the solution stored in solution reservoir 201. In some embodiments, the solution reservoir 201 can be prefilled with water, dialysate or other fluid for addition to the controlled compliant flow path 110. [0330] As such, embodiments of the invention can have a controlled compliance controlled compliant flow path 110 that is accurately controlled to precisely remove or add fluid to the extracorporeal side of the dialyzer 701. Due to the substantially inflexible void volume of the components and connecting conduits of the controlled compliant flow path 110, net movement of fluid or water is prevented from moving in either direction across the membrane 702 between the extracorporeal flow path 100 of the dialyzer 701 and the controlled compliant flow path 110 of the dialyzer 701. Specifically, due to the controlled compliance feature of the void volume of the controlled compliant flow path 110, water cannot passively move in either direction between the extracorporeal side and the dialysate side through the dialysis membrane 702. In the event of factors that tend to increase pressure on the extracorporeal side of the dialysis membrane, such as increased blood flow rate or blood viscosity, pressure across the membrane will automatically be equalized due to the limited volume of the controlled compliant flow path 110 and the non-compressible nature of the dialysate. In the event of factors that tend to increase pressure on the dialysate side of the dialysis membrane 702, such as increased dialysate flow rate, net movement of water from the controlled compliant flow path 110 to the extracorporeal flow path 100 is prevented by a vacuum that would form in the controlled compliant flow path 110 in the event of such a movement. This capability can further be used to enhance the convective clearance of the system for uremic impurities while controlling the net fluid removed from the patient, for example, creating periods of fluid movement across the membrane with occasional reversal of direction. In certain embodiments, an ultrafiltrate can be used as described herein. However, the present invention is not limited to a controlled compliance flow path wherein the controlled compliant flow path 110 in certain embodiments is not a controlled compliance flow path and may include one or more open reservoirs for storing or accumulating dialysate. [0331] Since the dialyzer can be a high-flux type there is some fluid flux back and forth across the dialyzer membrane due to the pressure differential on the blood and dialysate sides of the membrane. This is a localized phenomenon due to the low pressure required to move solution across the membrane and is called back-filtration, however results in no net fluid gain or loss by the patient. [0332] The fixed volume controlled compliant flow path, as described, enables the fluid balance control pump 303 to be operated in concert with the water pump 304 and acid concentrate pump 306 such that net fluid removal or subtraction from the controlled compliant flow path 110, and thus the extracorporeal flow path 100 can be precisely determined and controlled according to a simple volumetric control algorithm that is expressed by as sum of the volumes in following formula. Patient Fluid Balance + Fluid Balance Control Pump + Water Pump + Acid Cone. Pump + ςγ=ο *i=o The term “Patient Fluid Balance” refers to the volume of fluid added to or removed from the patient by net movement of fluid across the dialyzer membrane 702. The algebraic sign of each term of the above formula is determined by whether the flow is efflux or influx to the controlled compliant flow path 110. The term X refers to the volumetric flow rate of a pump where the number of pumps can range for η from 0 to 20. The term “n from 0 to 20” means any integer value of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 ,16, 17, 18, 19, or 20. The formula applies to an instantaneous rate of fluid removal. The instantaneous net fluid removal rate can also be integrated over the time course of therapy to determine the net fluid removal during the elapsed therapy time. Thus, the system can operate the aforementioned pumps to selectively meter in and meter out fluid from the flow loop to accomplish a predetermined patient fluid balance at any time throughout the course of a therapy delivery session. [0333] In certain embodiments, any one of the control pumps of the invention can be a peristaltic pump, a volumetric metering pump, diaphragm pump, or a syringe style pump. Hence, the controlled compliant flow path 110 has a substantially inflexible volume that can deliver controlled changes in volume modulated by the control pump 303 and optionally any other pump(s) that add or remove fluid to and from the controlled compliant flow path 110. The contents of U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 13/565,733 filed on August 2, 2012 are incorporated herein by references in their totality. [0334] In certain embodiments, the controlled compliant flow path 110 can have a total void volume from about 0.15 L to about 0.5 L. In other embodiments, the controlled compliant flow path 110 can have a void volume from about 0.2 L to about 0.4 L or from 0.2 L to about 0.35 L. Other volumes can be envisioned by those of ordinary skill in the art depending on parameters such as patient weight, size, and health condition. The system can be designed to be a portable system, a desktop system or a large system suitable for heavy use in a clinical setting. Hence, both large volumes greater than 0.5 L to about 5L, and micro-volumes from as small as 0.1 L to about 0.5 L such as 0.1 L to 0.2 L, 0.1 L to 0.3 L, 0.1 L to 0.4 L, 0.2 L to 0.3 L, 0.3 L to 0.4 L, or 0.3 L , 0.5 L, or greater volumes of about 1 L, 2 L, 3L, 4L, or 5L are contemplated by the invention. [0335] Infusates such as sodium chloride and sodium bicarbonate which have aqueous solubility limits greater than their concentration in dialysate can be produced on line by reconstituting a saturated solution from a container having a mass of solute greater than the amount of solute required for a therapy session, such that a reserve of solute persists and the solution in the container remains saturated. Although solubility does vary with temperature, the circulating dialysate temperature is controlled by heater 708 and the temperate of the solution exiting the containers may be optionally measured by temperature sensor 614 located near the outlet of the containers such that actual concentration of infusate can be determined from empirical temperature-solubility curves. [0336] Salination valve 406 directs the saturated solution flow path through either sodium chloride cartridge 203 having an excess of the solute sodium chloride, or through a buffer conduit flow path in fluid communication with sodium bicarbonate cartridge 204 having an excess of the solute sodium bicarbonate. The excess amount of solute can be an amount of solute greater than a predetermined amount of the solute that may be consumed during the course of normal operation of the system, such that some undissolved solute remains in the cartridge or container. The excess undissolved solute can result in solution exiting the cartridge or container that can be maintained in an essentially saturated state by virtue of the excess solute that remains available to dissolve into solution. It is readily apparent to one skilled in the art that the function of 3-way valve 406 could be replaced by two 2-way valves to accomplish the same fluid circuit functionality. Other valve arrangements whether 2-way, 3-way or more having different configurations to achieve the same effect is contemplated by the present invention. [0337] In a preferred embodiment, sodium chloride cartridge 203 and bicarbonate cartridge 204 are supplied in dry form and then hydrated to produce a saturated aqueous solution during the water intake and priming steps of system operation. This eliminates microbial growth that is possible with bicarbonate that is supplied as an aqueous solution and also reduces the transportation weight of the supplies. In Fig. 19, a fluid flow through bicarbonate cartridge 204 can reconstitute a saturated aqueous solution from a dry sodium bicarbonate as shown. Fluid can enter through port 524, pass through a first proximal layer of filter material 711, through flow through chamber 222, then pass through a second distal layer of filter material 711, and then out through fluid outlet port 523. The function of the filter material 711 can be to retain the sodium bicarbonate inside chamber 222 during storage and transport and also to prevent undissolved sodium bicarbonate particles from passing out of chamber 222 when fluid is flowing through chamber 222. Blown or spun depth filter media are preferred for filter material 711. An amount of dry sodium bicarbonate that is greater than the amount that will be consumed during operation of the system is contained in flow through chamber 222. The fluid flowing through chamber 222 can dissolve the sodium bicarbonate until a saturated solution is produced. The fluid passing out of bicarbonate cartridge204 at fluid outlet port 523 can remain saturated as long as an amount of undissolved sodium bicarbonate remains in flow through chamber 222. Saturation concentration of sodium bicarbonate is well known, including its variation with temperature. Temperature sensor 614 can measure the temperature of the solution exiting through fluid outlet port 523 to enable a controller to determine the sodium bicarbonate concentration of the fluid exiting the bicarbonate cartridge 204. It should be further noted that the solution that is metered from flow path 100 through the bicarbonate cartridge 204 by action of pump 307 can contain other solutes, principally sodium and chloride, that these solutes affect the saturation concentration of bicarbonate in bicarbonate cartridge 204, and the effect of these solutes, whose concentrations are also controlled by the system, can be taken into account when determining the bicarbonate concentration in the saturated bicarbonate cartridge 204. The rate of salination pump 307 can be adjusted accordingly by a controller to maintain the desired rate of sodium bicarbonate infusion from conditioning conduit flow path 115 to the controlled compliant flow path 110 and filtrate regeneration circuit 120. [0338] In Fig. 20 an embodiment of a bicarbonate cartridge 204 is shown. Fluid can enter through fluid inlet port 524, and can pass through a first proximal filter layer 711, then through flow through chamber 222 containing an amount of sodium bicarbonate in excess of the amount that will be consumed by operation of the system, through a second distal filter layer 711, and then exits through fluid outlet port 523. The enclosure of the bicarbonate cartridge is formed by base 717 and cover 718. In the embodiment shown, there can be a lap joint positioned between base 717 and cover 718. The lap joint configuration is a non-limiting example of an embodiment of the invention wherein those of skill in the art will recognize that many suitable methods of attachment and sealing of the cover 718 to body 717, for example adhesive bonding, snaps with elastomeric seals, threads, spin welding, ultrasonic welding and press fitting are available. Also shown are o-ring seals 836 that provide fluid seals between fluid ports 524 and 523 and their mating ports of the base module. The seals 835 and the geometry of ports 524 and 523 are exemplary and non-limiting, as those of skill in the art will recognize that there are many suitable seals, for example Q-rings, double seals, lip seals and face seals, and many fluid port geometries, for example luer connectors, Hansen connectors, and push to connect tube fittings, any of which can be used in the present invention,. [0339] As shown in FIG. 1, the dialysate is recirculated through the controlled compliant flow path 110 by a dialysate pump 305. When the fluid balance control pump 303, water pump 304, salination pump 307, and acid concentrate pump 306 are not operating, fluid along the length of the controlled compliant flow path 110 flows into and out of the dialyzer 701 at a rate determined solely by the action of the dialysate pump 305. In some embodiments, the dialysate pump can be operated at a rate from about 50 to about 800 mL/min. The dialysate pump 305 can be a positive displacement pump such as a reciprocating metering pump, a diaphragm pump, or peristaltic roller pump. The dialysate pump 305 selection is not limited to positive displacement pumps and may be a gear pump, vane pump, or centrifugal pump. In one embodiment, a gear pump can be used in the controlled compliant flow path 110. In the extracorporeal path 100, a peristaltic pump can be used. However, it will be understood that many other types of pumps known to those of skill in the art can be used. [0340] In preferred embodiments, fluid balance control pump 303 can operate bi-directionally to meter fluid between solution reservoir 201 and the controlled compliant flow path 110 and the fluid balance control pump 303 is a positive displacement pump. Non-limiting examples of positive displacement pumps include fixed volume, reciprocating piston pumps, diaphragm pumps or peristaltic roller pumps. [0341] Water pump 304 is normally operated in an influx direction to meter water from water reservoir 202 into the controlled compliant flow path 110. Water pump 304 is a positive displacement pump. Non-limiting examples of positive displacement pumps include fixed volume, reciprocating piston pumps, diaphragm pumps or peristaltic roller pumps. [0342] Salination pump 307 is operated to meter fluid from the controlled compliant flow path 110 through cartridges within a conditioning flow path 115 containing an amount of solute greater than the aqueous solubility of the solute such that saturated solutions of an infusate such as sodium chloride or sodium bicarbonate are metered back into the controlled compliant flow path 110 to enable the concentration of one or more solutes in the dialysate to be increased in the dialysate. Salination pump 307 is a positive displacement pump. Non-limiting examples of positive displacement pumps include fixed volume, reciprocating piston pumps, diaphragm pumps or peristaltic roller pumps. [0343] In FIG. 1, the salination pump 307 can pull dialysate after the outlet of the sorbent cartridge 703 and returns the fluid to the controlled compliant flow path 110 at a point upstream of the dialysate pump inlet. The configuration shown in FIG. 1 is one non-limiting example where one of ordinary skill can envision other points on the controlled compliant flow path 110 for returning fluid either pre, or post sorbent cartridge 703. Specifically, and with reference to FIG. 1, the function of salination pump 307 is to meter a controlled volume of fluid from the controlled compliant flow path 110 through a conditioning flow path 115 containing a saturated solution cartridge and return to the controlled compliant flow path 110 an equal volume of saturated solution. The fluid can be returned to the controlled compliant flow path 110 at a range of points between bypass junction 526 and conductivity sensor 613. Referencing FIG. 1C, it is further noted that the salination pump 307 can intake fluid at a range of points from bypass junction 526 and conductivity sensor 613, with the preference that the inlet to pump 307 is located at a point on the controlled compliant flow path 110 that is not immediately downstream from the outflow of concentrated solution passing from valve 406 back to the controlled compliant flow path 110. [0344] Electrolyte concentrate, or acid concentrate pump 306 is normally operated in an influx direction to meter a concentrate containing electrolytes such as K+, Mg++, Ca++ and other substances constituting the dialysate prescription from the acid concentrate reservoir 205. Acid concentrate pump 306 is a positive displacement pump. Non-limiting examples of positive displacement pumps include fixed volume, reciprocating piston pumps, diaphragm pumps or peristaltic roller pumps. [0345] Due to the substantially inflexible void volume of the circuit components and connecting conduits that constitute the controlled compliant flow path 110, the net movement of fluid over any time interval across the dialysis membrane 702 can be accurately controlled by precisely removing or adding fluid volume to the controlled compliant flow path by coordinated action of one or more of the pumps 303, 304 and 306. Thus a means to accurately introduce or remove fluid from the patient is provided. [0346] FIG. ID shows an embodiment employing a hemofiltration approach. The components shown in FIG. ID are comparable to FIG. 1 where the same reference numbers refer to like elements. During hemofiltration, filtrate from the blood is drawn across membrane 732 through filtrate pump 335 and waste species are removed from the blood by the action of solvent drag as the filtrate passes through membrane 732. The pumping rate of filtrate pump 335 determines the rate of convective filtration. As such, a dialysate is not circulated through hemofilter 731. Rather, a filtrate fluid is removed from blood at hemofilter 731 and a replacement fluid is regenerated for reintroduction to the patient via the venous line 105 at port 538 to prevent hypovolemia that would occur due to excessive fluid removal in the absence of replacement fluid return. [0347] The components and conduits that comprise a filtrate regeneration circuit 120 and bypass flow path 111 are substantially inflexible such that a controlled compliance filtrate regeneration circuit is created and, as described for FIG 1, pumps 303, 304 and 306 can be operated to precisely control net fluid removal or addition to a subject receiving therapy. As such, the fluid balance control pump 303 can be operated in concert with the water pump 304 and acid concentrate pump 306 such that net fluid removal or subtraction from the filtrate regeneration circuit 120, and thus the extracorporeal flow path 100 can be precisely determined and controlled according to a simple volumetric control algorithm that is expressed by as sum of the volumes in given in the following formula. Filtrate regeneration circuit 120 can also be referred to as a solution conduit flow path. Patient Fluid Balance + Fluid Balance Control Pump + Water Pump + Acid Cone. Pump + Xf=0 = 0 [0348] “Patient Fluid Balance” refers to the volume of fluid added to or removed from the patient by net movement of fluid removed as filtrate through hemofilter membrane 732 and returned as replacement fluid through port 538 of the extracorporeal flow path 100. The algebraic sign of each term of the above formula is determined by whether the flow is efflux or influx to the filtrate regeneration circuit 120. The term X refers to the volumetric flow rate of a pump where the number of pumps can range for η from 0 to 20. The term "n from 0 to 20" means any integer value of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 ,16, 17, 18, 19, or 20.The formula applies to an instantaneous rate of fluid removal. The instantaneous net fluid removal rate can also be integrated over the time course of therapy to determine the net fluid removal during the elapsed therapy time. Thus, the system can operate the aforementioned pumps to selectively meter in and meter out fluid from the flow loop to accomplish a predetermined patient fluid balance at any time throughout the course of a therapy delivery session. [0349] In some embodiments, the amount of replacement fluid returned to the subject is substantially the same as the volume removed through the hemofilter 731. In other embodiments, the volume of replacement fluid infused into the subject is less than the volume removed through the hemofilter 731 to affect a net fluid removal from the subject. [0350] Filtrate can be removed from the hemofilter 731 through outlet 537 and the pressure of the removed fluid (i.e. filtrate fluid) is monitored by pressure sensor 615. Blood leak detector 605 monitors the filtrate for presence of blood in the filtrate that would indicate a breach of hemofilter membrane 732. FIG. 1 describes the use of system components to modify the composition of a dialysate to maintain physiological compatibility. Similar system components can be used to modify the composition of the regenerated filtrate to produce a replacement fluid for reinfusion to the venous line 105 via port 538. [0351] Prior to the initiation of hemofiltration treatment, the conduits of the system must be primed with a physiologically compatible solution. As described for FIG. 1, water from reservoir 202 is optionally de-aerated and then drawn into filtrate regeneration circuit 120 by action of pump 304. As described, sodium cartridge 203 and bicarbonate cartridge 204, in conjunction with salination valve 406 and pump 307, can be used to generate an predetermined level of sodium ion and buffer to generate a physiologically compatible priming solution. The solution produced can then be circulated through bypass flow path 111, which functions as a priming and recirculation loop, by action of valve 407. In general, the steps for controlling generation the physiologically compatible solution are as follows: (1) Η20 pump = Control Pump; (2) Salination pump rate = ((solution target/ NaCl cone.)) x Η20 pump rate) + (( delta conductivity/ NaCl cone.) χ solution conduit flow rate). [0352] As described for FIG 1, the physiological priming solution is moved into the therapy solution reservoir 201 by action of control pump 303 and the process continues until a predetermined amount of physiologically compatible solution sufficient for priming, fluid bolus, and blood rinse-back has been produced and reserved in reservoir 201. [0353] Once the predetermined volume of physiologically compatible solution has been produced and moved to the therapy solution reservoir 201, pump 303 can be reversed to begin moving a portion of the prepared solution volume contained in reservoir 201 back to the filtrate circuit and valve 407 is now positioned to allow the solution volume to pass through microbial filters 706 and 709 and into the extracorporeal flow path at port 538. Priming of the extracorporeal flow path continues as described for FIG 1, except that the physiologically compatible priming solution enters the extracorporeal circuit at port 538 instead of across dialyzer 701 membrane 702, and air in the extracorporeal flow path is moved to a hydrophobic vent 560 located at the terminal ends of extracorporeal flow path 100 as shown in FIG 4Β or into priming over flow reservoir 210 as shown in the examples of FIG 4Α and FIG 4C. Additionally, as the extracorporeal flow path fills with the priming solution, fluid passes across the hemofilter membrane 732, exiting hemofilter 731 through port 537, returning to the filtrate regeneration circuit 120. Any air passed into filtrate regeneration circuit 120 with the fluid exiting hemofilter 731 at port 537 is exhausted by action of degassing module 705 located in filtrate regeneration circuit 120 before the solution is circulated back to the extracorporeal flow path. During this process, infusates can be added from concentrate reservoir 205 by action of pump 306 to add additional cations and components (e.g. potassium ions, magnesium ions, calcium ions, etc.) to the solution. [0354] Upon initiation of hemofiltration treatment, waste species are removed from the filtration fluid by sorbent cartridge 703. Infusates can be added from concentrate reservoir 205 by action of pump 306 to add necessary cations and components (e.g. potassium ions, magnesium ions, calcium ions, etc.) to regenerate a replacement fluid solution. The treated filtrate is then passed through the degas module 705, microbial filters 706 and 709 to complete preparation of the replacement fluid solution prior to its introduction to the venous line 105 at port 538 for infusion into the patient. The replacement fluid solution may be necessary for preventing hypovolemia, and can replace at least a portion of the fluid volume removed as filtrate from the blood of the subject. Replacement fluid can also be referred to as a substitution fluid wherein such terms are used interchangeably in the present invention. As in FIG 1, ammonia sensor 611, temperature sensor 612, and conductivity sensor 613 monitor the replacement fluid to verify that it remains within predetermined limits. If the solution composition is outside of predetermined limits, valve 407 diverts the solution through bypass flow path 111, functioning as a priming and recirculation loop, until the fluid has been corrected. Those skilled in the art will understand that the composition of the filtrate (e.g. sodium ion concentration, conductivity) may not always match a desired composition for a replacement fluid. As such, the sodium cartridge 203 and the bicarbonate cartridge 204 can be used to modify the composition of the filtrate as necessary to allow a suitable replacement fluid to be generated. For example, conductivity of the filtrate fluid can be increased using the conditioning pathway 115 by operating pump 307 and valve 406. Similarly, conductivity can be lowered through addition of water from reservoir 202 by action of pump 304 and excess fluid can be removed through operation of pump 303. A additional pressure sensors can be added in the replacement fluid pathway before microbial filter 706 and between microbial filters 706 and 709 to monitor condition of the filters independently. As described for FIG 1, a fluid bolus can be provided to the subject by delivering additional solution volume from reservoir 201 to the filtrate regeneration circuit 120 via action of pump 303, except that the bolus fluid volume enters the extracorporeal circuit at port 538 instead of passing across dialyzer 701 membrane 702. [0355] FIG. IE shows an embodiment to perform hemodiafiltration therapy. This system is the same as the hemodialysis system shown in FIG. 1, except that a replacement fluid metering pump 308 and a redundant microbial filter 709 have been added to the circuit wherein effluent dialysate exits the dialyzer 701 via outlet 507 and returns via inlet 506. The replacement fluid metering pump 308 may be a reciprocating type piston pump, or a diaphragm pump, or a peristaltic pump. Microbial filter 709 may be an individual microbial filter, or multiple redundant microbial filters in series. Because the controlled compliant flow path 110, also referred to as a solution conduit flow path, has a controlled compliant volume, operation of replacement fluid metering pump 308 causes additional filtrate to be pulled from the blood across membrane 702 into the dialysate compartment for enhanced clearance by convection across the dialysis membrane. This filtrate is combined into the effluent stream passing through dialyzer outlet 507 returning to the sorbent cartridge 703 where impurities are removed. The combined dialysate and filtrate stream is then reinfused with cations from concentrate reservoir 205 and continues toward the dialyzer inlet 506. Prior to reaching dialyzer inlet 506, replacement fluid metering pump 308 redirects a portion of the regenerated fluid through microbial filter 709 as replacement fluid solution into the venous line 105 of the extracorporeal flow path at port 538. [0356] Because of the controlled compliance of the controlled compliant flow path 110, net fluid removal from the subject can be determined by calculating the algebraic sum of the flow rates of control pump 303, water pump 304, electrolyte pump 306 and replacement fluid metering pump 308 per unit time according to the following formula. Patient Fluid Balance + Fluid Balance Control Pump + Water Pump + Acid Cone. Pump + Replacement Fluid Pump + ΣΡ=ο ℅ = 0 [0357] The term “Patient Fluid Balance” refers to the volume of fluid added to or removed from the patient by net movement of fluid across the dialyzer membrane 702 and into the extracorporeal flow path 105 at port 538. The algebraic sign of each term of the above formula is determined by whether the flow is efflux or influx to the controlled compliant flow path 110. The formula applies to an instantaneous rate of fluid removal. The instantaneous net fluid removal rate can also be integrated over the time course of therapy to determine the net fluid removal during the elapsed therapy time. The term X denotes the volumetric flow rates of other possible pumps where η can range from 0 to 20. It will be understood that many possible permutations of numbers and types of pumps and reservoirs can be used together in the above described formula without departing from the scope of the invention. [0358] Each of control pump 303, water pump 304, acid concentrate pump 306 and replacement fluid metering pump 308 can be operated under coordinated active control where volumetric pumping rates can be independently adjusted and one or more can be turned on or off as required to achieve a prescribed fluid composition and a prescribed fluid removal from the subject undergoing therapy. [0359] FIG. 2 shows an embodiment in which base module 803 is in fluid communication with the controlled compliant flow path components of an optional therapy cassette 820. Therapy cassette 820 can contain consumable and disposable items required for therapy and can be detachably mounted on the base module 803. Therapy cassette 820 can contain a dialyzer 701, one or more infusates 804 and one or more solution reservoir 201. The infusates can be in the form of dry materials or solutions. In some embodiments, the therapy cassette 820 can contain a dialyzer and one or more infusate reservoirs wherein the dialyzer or infusate containers 804 may or may not be fully detachable from the therapy cassette (not shown). In other embodiments, the therapy cassette can contain the dialyzer and one or more solutions reservoir 201 wherein either may or may not be fully detachable from the therapy cassette (not shown). During therapy, the blood circulation of subject 850 is in fluid communication with dialyzer 701 contained in therapy cassette 820. In certain embodiments, connected water reservoir 202 can be detachably connected to the system or formed integrally with one more system components such as the base module 803. During operation, the water reservoir 202 is in fluid communication with the base module. Sorbent cartridge 703 is also in fluid communication with the base module 803. The actions of the base module are controlled by controller 802. Control module 802 sends messages to and receives commands from the user through user interface 801. Whether combined into the optional therapy cassette 820, or individually mounted on base module 803, in any embodiment the dialyzer 701, infusates 804, solution reservoir 201, sorbent cartridge 703 and water reservoir 202 are in fluid communication with the jumpered ports (not shown) of base module 803 to complete a controlled compliant dialysis flow path for purposes of delivering therapy to a subject. [0360] FIG. 3 shows the re-usable fluid path components and ports of the controlled compliant flow path 110 of FIG. 1 contained within base module 803 of FIG 2. Dotted lines added to the fluid circuit diagram indicate fluid path connections that are established by jumper pathways 860-871 contained within a cleaning manifold 840 shown in FIG. 6Α. The jumpers contained in cleaning manifold 840 complete the fluid circuit segments that were opened by removal of the disposable and consumable components upon therapy completion prior to the cleaning and/or disinfection process. The jumpers create completed fluid circuits to enable fluid to be flushed and recirculated through the re-usable components contained in base module 803 for purposes of cleaning and/or disinfection. The dotted lines shown in FIG 3 provide a single, non-limiting example of a configuration to jumper the fluid ports. Alternative jumpered port combinations are contemplated by this invention and those skilled in the art will recognize that other combinations of jumpered ports can be employed to create completed fluid circuit pathways for purposes of flushing fluids and recirculation of a cleaning and/or disinfection fluid throughout the re-usable portions of the controlled compliance dialysate fluid circuit. [0361] A cleaning manifold 840 having the fluid circuit jumpers and ports of FIG. 3 is shown in FIG. 6Α. The circuit jumpers, or fluid port jumpers, connect to the fluid ports of the base module 803 to complete the fluid circuit where the disposable and consumable components of the controlled compliance controlled compliant flow path have been removed upon completion of therapy. When cleaning manifold 840 is installed on base module 803, the cleaning manifold fluid ports 506Μ, 507Μ, 508Μ, 509ΑΜ, 510ΑΜ, 515Μ, 516Μ, 519Μ, 522Μ, 523Μ, 524Μ, 530Μ, and 531Μ shown in FIG. 6Α engage the corresponding fluid ports 506S, 507S, 508S, 509S, 510S, 515S, 516S, 517S, 519S, 522S, 523S, 524S, 530S, and 531S of base module 803 shown in FIG. 5C. FIG. 6Α also shows fluid ports 509ΒΜ and 510ΒΜ that connect to lines 113 and 114 of FIG. 3, respectively, to enable fluid communication between cleaning manifold 840 and reservoir 202. One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that water reservoir 202 can be bypassed by connecting a suitable water source directly to fluid port 510ΒΜ of cleaning manifold 840 if the water source will not require deaeration by the system before use in the cleaning and/or disinfection process. [0362] During cleaning and disinfection a volume of water may be first de-aerated as necessary by the method described earlier. During de-aeration valves 411 and 412, which are contained in cleaning manifold 840, are operated to allow water to flow from water reservoir 202 through line 113, valve 411, valve 404, optionally heater 708, dialysate pump 305, and valve 405 to return to water reservoir 202 through de-aeration bypass conduit 112, valve 412 and line 114. Before removing sorbent cartridge 703 shown in FIG. 1 from the jumpered flow path shown in FIG. 3, the jumpered circuit is filled with water and a predetermined excess volume of water may optionally be flushed through the jumpered flow path 110. To accomplish this, water is metered into the jumpered flow path 110 by water pump 304, purified by sorbent cartridge 703, circulated through the various flow paths, pumps, and valves of the jumpered flow path 110 shown in FIG. 3 and then passed through flush control valve 413 into flush reservoir 841 that is contained within cleaning manifold 840. In an alternative embodiment, a drain connection can be substituted for flush reservoir 841. Those skilled in the art will recognize that the sorbent cartridge may be removed prior to this step if provisions are made to complete the fluid circuit, such as by jumpering ports 514 and 513 for the flushing step, and if the source water is sufficiently clean such that no further filtration for use as a flushing fluid or if filtration is provided within the cleaning manifold such as at water inlet ports 509ΒΜ and 510ΒΜ. Next, the sorbent cartridge is disconnected from jumpered controlled compliant flow path 110 and cleaning and/or disinfection concentrate cartridge 720 is connected at ports 514 and 513. Valves 411 and 412 are positioned to prevent flow through water reservoir 202, while allowing flow through base module 803 water intake connection ports 509S and 510S in the recirculating flow path so they can be cleaned and disinfected. Next all pumps shown in FIG. 3 are started and all valves except 413 and 410 are cycled to direct the recirculation fluid through all pathways and distribute the cleaning and/or disinfection concentrate from cartridge 720. Heater 708 is employed to increase the fluid temperature to a temperature that aids disinfection. During the disinfection process the temperature of the heated cleaning and/or disinfection solution is monitored by sensors such as 607, 612 and 614 to verify that the fluid temperature remains within predetermined limits for cleaning and/or disinfection. Additional temperature sensors and temperature sensor locations are contemplated by the invention and those skilled in the art will recognize that the specific location and number of temperature sensors can be tailored to the requirements of individual embodiments. [0363] Disinfection is controlled by a 4-way interaction between fluid temperature, type of disinfectant chemical, disinfectant chemical concentration, and disinfection time. In one, non-limiting preferred embodiment citric acid is employed as the cleaning and disinfectant chemical at a concentration of approximately 2% by weight. Citric acid is effective to remove mineral scale, is relatively non-toxic and biocompatible, and readily reconstituted from a dry chemical form. In one, non-limiting preferred embodiment, the cleaning and disinfection fluid temperature is 80° C to 90° C, and the disinfection time at temperature is less than 1 hour. In another, non-limiting embodiment, the cleaning and disinfection fluid temperature is around 85° C and the disinfection time is around 20 minutes. One of ordinary skill will understand that specific temperature and time parameters will be dependent upon the specific embodiment. [0364] At the conclusion of the cleaning and/or disinfection process, the system shuts down and the cleaning manifold 840, disinfectant cartridge 720, and disinfectant fluid are left in place for convenience and to keep the fluid pathways closed to contaminant entry. FIG. 6C shows a cutaway of a base module door 802, revealing that the cleaning and disinfection module 840 may remain in-situ in the stowed configuration. [0365] As illustrated herein, for example in FIG.’s 1, 5C and 5G, a base module 803 having fluid connection ports 506S, 507S, 508S, 509S, 510S, 515S, 516S, 519S, 522S, 523S, 524S, 530S, and 531S is connected to the disposable and consumable components, optionally organized into the therapy cassette 820, to complete the controlled compliant flow path 110. That is, connections can be made to the base module 803 between a disposable therapy cassette 820, reservoirs such as water reservoir 202, and sorbent cartridge 703 to form a completed jumpered controlled compliant flow path for preparation of a physiologically compatible dialysate. As illustrated herein, for example FIG.’s 3, 5C, 6Α, a cleaning manifold 840 can be attached to the base module 803 to clean and disinfect reusable portions of the jumpered controlled compliant flow path 110 separate from other portions of the jumpered controlled compliant flow path 110 that may be replaced between uses of the system. In other embodiments, a therapy cassette can contain any combination of one or more disposable or consumable therapy components such as dialyzer 701, extracorporeal flow path 100, cartridges 203 and 204, concentrate reservoir 205, control reservoir 201, sensors such as ammonia sensor 611, and sorbent cartridge 703. [0366] With reference to FIG.’s 1, ID, IE and 3, the fluid circuitry of the therapy system may be divided into a number of segments that can be combined to form a completed controlled compliance flow path. Segments can be selected from the group consisting of: a first segment having a sorbent cartridge 703 or a cleaning and/or disinfection concentrate cartridge 720 in fluid communication with the controlled compliant flow path 110; a second segment having a concentrate pump 306 in fluid communication with both a reservoir for addition of a concentrate solution 205 and a conduit of the controlled compliant flow path 110; a third segment containing a degassing module 705 in fluid communication with the controlled compliant flow path 110, and a vent control valve 410 in fluid communication with a vent port 517 of a degassing module 705; a fourth segment having at least one salination pump 307 or at least one salination valve 406, and a bypass pathway 115 for conveyance of fluid through a sodium chloride cartridge 203 or a bicarbonate cartridge 204 to a sorbent cartridge 703 without conveyance through a dialyzer 701 ; a fifth segment having a dialyzer 701 with a blood inlet port 504 and blood outlet port 505 in fluid communication with an extracorporeal flow path 100 and dialysate inlet port 506 in fluid communication with a first microbial filter 706 and dialysate outlet port 507 in fluid communication with a one-way valve 403; a sixth segment that is a bypass flow path 111, functioning as priming and recirculation loop, for conveying fluid from the sorbent cartridge 703 without contacting the dialyzer 701 or passing through a sodium chloride cartridge 203 or a bicarbonate cartridge 204; a seventh segment having a control pump 303 in fluid communication with both a control reservoir 201 and a conduit of the controlled compliant flow path 110; an eighth segment having a water pump 304 in fluid communication with both a water reservoir 202 and a conduit of the controlled compliant flow path 110; a ninth segment having a pump 305 in fluid communication with the controlled compliant flow path 110, a de-aeration bypass conduit 112 in fluid communication with at least a conduit of the controlled compliant flow path 110 and an air vent 512, and a fluid intake bypass valve 404 to direct or to cause fluid movement of fluid from a port 509 of a water reservoir 202 through a flow restriction 408 and pump 305 to de-aerate a fluid; a tenth segment in fluid communication with both a flush reservoir 841 and a pump 303, 304, 306, or 307 in fluid communication with a conduit of the controlled compliant flow path 110; an eleventh segment in fluid communication with at least a port 509 of a water reservoir 202, a flow restriction 408 and a fluid intake bypass valve 404; a twelfth segment in fluid communication with a port 510 of a water reservoir 202, a deaeration bypass valve 405 and a pump 305 in fluid communication with a conduit of the controlled compliant flow path 110; a thirteenth segment having a hemofilter 731 with blood inlet port 504 and blood outlet port 505 in fluid communication with an extracorporeal flow path 100 and a filtrate port 537 in fluid communication with a one-way valve 403; a fourteenth segment having a second microbial filter 709 in fluid communication with a conduit of an extracorporeal flow path 100 and a first microbial filter 706; a fifteenth segment having a second microbial filter 709 in fluid communication with a conduit of an extracorporeal flow path 100 and a replacement fluid pump 308, the replacement fluid pump 308 being in fluid communication with a first microbial filter 706 and a dialysate inlet port 506 of a dialyzer 701. [0367] During priming of the system and treatment of a subject, connection of the disposable and consumable components, optionally organized into therapy cassette 820, to the base module 803 connects the second segment, the third segment, the fourth segment, the fifth segment and the seventh segment to the controlled compliant flow path 110 in order to complete portions of the controlled compliant flow path 110. Installation and connection of sorbent cartridge 703 at ports 513 and 514 completes the first segment. The fourth segment is provided to allow for the presence of sodium cartridge 203 and bicarbonate cartridge 204 to allow for the generation of a physiological compatible dialysate from water provided from reservoir 202. [0368] Attachment of the cleaning manifold 840 in place of the removable disposable and consumable therapy components allows for the re-useable portions of the controlled compliant flow path 110 of base module 803 to be connected into a completed fluid circuit to allow for generation and circulation of a cleaningand/or disinfection fluid. The connections formed by the cleaning manifold 840 are shown by jumpers 860-871 in FIG. 3. In particular, a connection can be made between ports 516 and 519 in lieu of the degas module 705, between ports 506 and 507 in lieu of the dialyzer 701, between ports 522, 523 and 524 in lieu of the sodium chloride cartridge 203 and bicarbonate cartridge 204. Additional connections can be made by cleaning manifold 840 to complete a tenth segment connecting a flush reservoir 841 and a fluid port of the base module pump in fluid communication with controlled compliant flow path 110, for example port 508 and pump 303, of the base module; an eleventh segment connecting water reservoir 202 port 509 to base module port 509S, and hence to flow restriction 408 and fluid intake bypass valve 404 of the base module; and a twelfth segment connecting water reservoir 202 port 510 to base module fluid connection port 510S, and hence to bypass conduit 112 and water pump 304 of the base module. The cleaning manifold 840 attached to the base module 803 completes a jumpered controlled compliant flow path 110 wherein connection of the cleaning manifold 840 to the base module 803 completes or connects the second segment, the third segment, the fourth segment, the fifth segment, the tenth segment, the eleventh segment and the twelfth segment to form the controlled compliant flow path 110. [0369] The use of the base module 803 and the various fluid connection ports are described in Table 1 below in conjunction with the cleaning manifold 840, the disposable and consumable components optionally arranged into therapy cassette 820,and various jumpered connections that can be made between the fluid connection ports. Each fluid connection port can be located on or connected to one or more of the base module 803, the cleaning manifold 840, or the disposable and consumable components optionally arranged into therapy cassette 820. Table 1 states each fluid port as located on the base module 803 or on another system component. If a fluid connection port is part of the base module 803 as shown in, for example, FIG.’s 5C and 5G, the ports location as part of the main controlled compliant flow path 110 or the nearest component of the base module fluid circuit is indicated under the “Base Module” column. For example, the sodium cartridge outlet 522 is indicated to make a connection local to the salination valve 406 rather than part of the main controlled compliant flow path 110. Each port located on the base module 803 is used for one or more connections to the cleaning manifold 840 and/or components of therapy cassette 820 or to another system component such as sorbent inlet 513 and outlet 514, where connection to the cleaning manifold 840 and/or component of therapy cassette 820 is not indicated. As described above, sorbent inlet 513 and outlet 514 form connections with the sorbent cartridge 703 or cleaning and/or disinfection concentrate cartridge 720. [0370] The connection of any fluid connection port of the base module 803 to the cleaning manifold 840 or therapy cassette 820 is also indicated under the appropriate column. It should be noted that many fluid connection ports of the base module 803 are used for connection of both the cleaning manifold 840 and the therapy cassette 820. For example, a dialyzer is not used during operation of the cleaning manifold 840. Nevertheless, the dialyzer inlet 506 and outlet 507 ports of the base module 803 are in use regardless of whether the cleaning manifold 840 or therapy cassette 820 is placed. When the components of therapy cassette 820 are placed on the base module 803, appropriate connection is made to the dialyzer, as indicated. When the cleaning manifold 840 is placed on the base module 803, ports 506 and 507 are still required to complete a flow path for the cleaning solution. As indicated in Table 1, ports 506 and 507 both attach to the cleaning manifold 840 and are connected by jumper 860 of the cleaning manifold 840. Ports sharing the same numbered jumper indicate ports that are directly connected by a jumper during placement of the cleaning manifold 840. [0371] It is noted that not all ports indicated in Table 1 are located on the base module 803. For those ports, “no” is indicated under the “Base Module” column, the relevant connection to the cleaning manifold 840 and the therapy cassette 820 is indicated. For example, the patient’s venous blood access 501 is connected to the venous line 105 of the extracorporeal flow path 100. [0372] Finally, it should be noted that the port and jumper combinations for the cleaning manifold are a non-limiting exemplary embodiment and other combinations are contemplated by the invention. Those skilled in the art will recognize alternate port and jumper combinations that will enable a cleaning manifold to form a complete jumpered fluid circuit to flush fluids and circulate a cleaning and/or disinfection fluid through the re-usable components of base module 803.

The shelf doors 802 have been closed to provide a protective exterior surface that can protect interior components of the system while also contributing to a transport and storage configuration that has a compact size and may have a smooth exterior surface. User interface 801 is configured in a stowed position, having been nested into an exterior recess in the device such that the potentially fragile side of the interface is protected against the main body of the base unit, leaving only the protective back and side surfaces of user interface 801 exposed, yet positioned flush to the device exterior. This configuration enables a transport and stowage size that can be made compatible with airline carryon luggage size requirements. [0374] In FIG. 5Β a retractable handle 803 has been extended and integral wheels 804 are shown that facilitate system transport. [0375] In FIG. 5C hinged shelf doors 802 have been opened to create access to the fluid connection ports 506S, 507S, 508S, 509S, 510S, 515S, 516S, 517S, 519S, 522S, 523S, 524S, 530S, and 531S that are located on the main body of the base module and user interface 801 has been deployed to ready the system for setup. Shelf doors 802 create mounting surfaces for the water reservoir 202 and sorbent cartridge 703. [0376] In FIG. 5D, disposable and consumable therapy components, optionally organized into integrated therapy cassette 820, have been installed on the therapy system after first raising locking lever 805 to allow the system to accept the cassette. A simple straight-on translation perpendicular to the view plane of FIG. 5D has placed the cassette on the system. Locking lever 805 will be pushed down in the direction of the dotted arrow to engage the stator of the peristaltic roller blood pump and at the same time actuate the locking mechanism to lock the cassette 820 in place on the system. The lever 805 shown in FIG. 5D is a non-limiting example and those skilled in the art can readily envision other mechanisms to engage a peristaltic blood pump stator while simultaneously locking the cassette 820 in place. [0377] In FIG. 5Ε cassette 820 is locked in place. Water reservoir 202 has been filled with water and placed in position on a shelf door 802. Water intake line 113 is connected to base module port 509S and water line 114 is connected to base module port 510S. Sorbent cartridge 703 is shown in position on a shelf door 802 and connected to the controlled compliant flow path at ports 513 and 514. Arterial line 102 and venous line 105 are arranged within the therapy cassette 820 and are joined in fluid communication to priming overflow reservoir 210 by reversible connections. [0378] In FIG. 5F solution reservoir 201 has been unfolded from the therapy cassette and mounted on the rear of the therapy system base module 803. The protective exterior surfaces of shelf doors 802 and the protective back surface of user interface 801 are shown. [0379] In FIG. 5G, the fluid connection ports 506Τ, 507Τ, 508Τ, 515Τ, 516Τ, 517Τ, 519Τ, 522Τ, 523Τ, 524Τ, 530Τ, and 531Τ of the disposable and consumable therapy components that connect to the base module are shown, as optionally organized into a therapy cassette. The therapy cassette features a dialyzer 701, a degassing module 705, a cation concentrate reservoir 205, an ammonia sensing module 611, a dry bicarbonate cartridge 204, and a dry sodium chloride cartridge 203. Arterial line 102 and venous line 105 extend from the cassette. [0380] In FIG. 6Α the integrated flush fluid storage reservoir 841 of cleaning manifold 840 that accepts and holds fluids flushed during the cleaning and/or disinfection process is shown. A plurality of jumpers 860-871 create fluid pathways that complete the fluid pathways where the disposable and consumable components of integrated therapy cassette 820 have been removed from the fluid circuit prior to cleaning and disinfection operations. Flush control valve 413 controls flush fluid egress from the jumpered fluid circuit to the integrated flush reservoir 841. The flush control valve 413 can be computer or mechanically operated. One of ordinary skill in the art will understand that any suitable valves for use in fluid lines for dialysis may be used. The valves may be one-, two-, three-, or more-way depending on the desired direction of flow. Again, it will be understood that the present configuration described here is non-limiting wherein many more valve and flow configurations can be designed without departing from the scope of the invention. In the described embodiment, valves 411 and 412 allow fluid to be flushed through the connection ports 509S and 510S (not shown) on the base module 803 for thorough cleaning and/or disinfection. A plurality of ports 506Μ, 507Μ, 508Μ, 509ΑΜ, 510ΑΜ, 515Μ, 516Μ, 519Μ, 522Μ, 523Μ, 524Μ, 530Μ, and 531Μ having integral fluid seals connect to corresponding ports of the base module 803 when the cleaning manifold 840 is placed on the base module after the therapy cassette 820 has been removed. [0381] In FIG. 6Β, a cleaning manifold 840 with integral jumpers 860-871, flush control valves 411-413 and integral flushed fluid reservoir 841 is shown in place on the therapy system. Cleaning and/or disinfection concentrate cartridge 720 is shown connected at ports 513 and 514 to the controlled compliant flow path in place of sorbent cartridge 703 (not shown in this figure). [0382] FIG. 6C shows an exterior view of the system after cleaning and/or disinfection has been completed. A portion of shelf door 802 is cut away to reveal that the cleaning manifold 840 remains in place on the system and the cleaning and/or disinfection fluid remains in the fluid circuit. Shelf doors 802 have been closed and user interface 801 stowed. [0383] FIG. 7Α shows one possible section detail for a mating fluid port connection between a removable disposable or consumable therapy component arranged in a therapy cassette 820 and a fluid pathway of the system base module 803. The mating fluid port connection utilizes a male into female configuration such that the removable therapy component portion of the connection 830 is male and has an integral seal 831 that seals against the internal surface of the female port 832 that forms system base module 803 portion of the fluid interconnect. Connection ports 830 and 832 respectively have male and female configurations that do not limit the configurations to having only round cross sections. One of ordinary skill in the art will understand that other shapes such as oval cross sections can be configured to fit together as a male and female connection wherein such alternative configurations are contemplated by the present invention. Additionally, other sealing configurations known to those of ordinary skill in the art can be used. For example, sealing systems containing one or more O-rings, X-rings, Quad rings, lip seals, spring energized seals can be used. Moreover, one of ordinary skill can use replacements for the removable therapy component portion of the connection 830 using any suitable sealing systems and/or methods known by those of ordinary skill in the art. To provide for a secure seal, a fresh set of seals can be provided by the removable therapy component conduit portion 830 each time a new disposable or consumable component is installed onto the base module 803. It is further contemplated by the invention that check valves known to those of ordinary skill in the art (not shown) can be added to either the male or female half of the connection port to prevent fluid flow when the port is disconnected. [0384] In FIG. 7Β, one possible female fluid connection port 843 of the cleaning and disinfection manifold 840 is shown in place on the base module 803 port 832. The base module 803 portion of the fluid connection is 832 and is male and fits inside the female port 843 of cleaning manifold 840. Connection ports 843 and 832 respectively have female and male configurations that do not limit them to having only round cross sections. For example, one of ordinary skill in the art can envision other shapes, such as oval cross sections that can be configured to fit together as a male and female connections for use in the present invention. The seals 845 for this connection are provided on the cleaning manifold port 843. Various configurations and materials for the seals 845 are contemplated by the invention. The double seals 845 are intended to be illustrative in nature and not intended to limit the scope of the present invention. Those of ordinary skill in the art can envision other possible seal configurations such as O-rings, X-Rings, Quad-rings, lip seals and spring energized seals. [0385] It will be recognized by one skilled in the art that the port configurations shown in FIG.’s 7Α and 7Β are complimentary and work in combination to ensure that all fluid port surfaces that may contact the therapy solution, or dialysate will always be reliably exposed to the cleaning and/or disinfection fluid. Further, the external end surfaces of the base module 803 fluid port tubes 832 are also exposed to the cleaning and/or disinfection fluid, which ensures that microbial growth is not allowed to be present at the ends of the base module 803 fluid connection port tubes 832 and become transferred to the therapy solution contacting end surfaces of the removable therapy component male connector 830. The specific placement of the ports need not exactly conform to those depicted where other configurations for achieving the intended purposes of the invention can be used and many alternative configurations can be envisioned without departing from the scope of the invention. [0386] A method of circulating blood and a dialysate through a dialyzer using a hemodialysis device having a controlled compliance flow path and having a range of positions where the conditioning pathway 115 outflow can be infused into the main controlled compliant flow path is shown in Fig. 8, for example, using the hemodialysis device illustrated in FIG. 1Α representing one embodiment of the disposable and consumable therapy components only connected in fluid communication with one segment of a dialysate flow path. As shown in FIG. 1Α, the fluid connection ports 506Τ, 507Τ, 508Τ, 522Τ, 523Τ, 524Τ, 514Τ, 513Τ, 515Τ, 516Τ, 517Τ, 519Τ, 530Τ, 531Τ, 520Τ, and 521Τ can connect to the corresponding fluid ports of a base module. The removable disposable and consumable therapy components in the present, non-limiting examples include a degassing module 705, an ammonia sensing module 611, a dry bicarbonate cartridge 204, a dry sodium chloride cartridge 203, a cation concentrate reservoir 205, a solution reservoir 201, a dialyzer 701, and an extracorporeal flow path 100. However, additional permutations or groupings of components are contemplated, such as the dialyzer and dry bicarbonate cartridge. [0387] With reference to FIG. 8, in the first step of the method of circulating blood and a dialysate through a dialyzer 900 a preliminary setup procedure 901 can be performed to change the configuration of the hemodialysis device from a stowed or transport configuration to an open and ready configuration. In the next step, a therapy setup procedure can be performed 902 to further prepare the hemodialysis device for a hemodialysis therapy session by attaching the components and materials required to perform therapy. Next, a priming procedure can be performed 903 to initially fill a controlled compliance flow path and extracorporeal circuit with a physiologically compatible solution, such as a dialysate. Then, a therapy procedure is performed 904 to circulate blood and the dialysate through a dialyzer. When the therapy has been completed, a rinse-back procedure can be performed 905 to return the blood from the extracorporeal flow path. Then, an evacuation procedure can be performed 906 to remove fluid from the extracorporeal flow path and controlled compliant flow path. Finally, a cleaning and disinfection procedure can be performed 907 to prepare the hemodialysis device for storage before a future dialysis session. [0388] The solutions or fluids required for a hemodialysis therapy session can include a fluid to prime the dialysate flow path, a fluid to prime a dialyzer and extracorporeal flow path, a fluid to provide a bolus infusion to a subject receiving therapy, and a fluid to rinse blood contained in the dialyzer and extracorporeal flow path back to the subject at completion of therapy. The solutions or fluids required for a hemofiltration therapy session can include a fluid to prime the filtrate flow path, a fluid to prime a hemofilter and extracorporeal flow path, a fluid to provide a bolus infusion to a subject receiving therapy, a replacement fluid, and a fluid to rinse blood contained in the hemofilter and extracorporeal flow path back to the subject at completion of therapy. The solutions or fluids required for a hemodiafiltration therapy session can include a fluid to prime the dialysate flow path, a fluid to prime a dialyzer and extracorporeal flow path, a fluid to provide a bolus infusion to a subject receiving therapy, a replacement fluid, and a fluid to rinse blood contained in the dialyzer and extracorporeal flow path back to the subject at completion of therapy. The procedures of method 900 will describe the steps to produce fluids that are physiologically compatible in terms of chemistry and having microbiological purity for these uses. [0389] Further, a detailed sequence of steps will be disclosed for each of the individual steps of the method 900. With reference to FIG. 9, the preliminary setup procedure 901 to configure the hemodialysis device equipment can be performed by a user in conjunction with simultaneous monitoring by the hemodialysis system to verify and confirm correct setup of the equipment. In some embodiments the user can be a therapy subject. [0390] Referring to FIG. 9, at initiation of system setup for the next therapy session, the user can enter a request to remove the input cleaning manifold 911, which generally remains installed on the base module between therapy sessions to ensure the fluid pathways remain free of contamination. For example, in an embodiment shown in FIG.’s 2 and 5C, a user can initiate the preliminary setup procedure by turning on system power and selecting Setup Mode via user interface 801. The user further can enter a request through user interface 801 to remove cleaning manifold 840 and start the setup process for a therapy session. The system or device then can cycle the pumps and valves in sequence to drain the cleaning and/or disinfection solution from the fluid pathways and components of controlled compliant flow path 110, conditioning flow path 115 through pump 307 and valve 406, bypass flow path 111, metering pumps 303, 304 and 306 the cleaning and/or disinfection concentrate cartridge, and the cleaning manifold jumper lumens. The drained fluid is collected in integrated reservoir 841 contained in cleaning manifold 840. Optionally, in some embodiments, water reservoir 202 can be filled with water and connected to cleaning manifold ports 509ΒΜ and 510ΒΜ to allow fresh water flushing of the cleaning and/or disinfection solution as a first part of the fluid draining step. [0391] In the next step, the user verifies that the cleaning and/or disinfection solution has been drained from a cleaning and/or disinfection cartridge and a cleaning manifold 912 in FIG. 9. Alternatively, in any embodiment the system can return a message to the user via user interface 801 in FIG.’s 2 and 5C that the user may now remove cleaning manifold 840 and cleaning and/or disinfection concentrate cartridge 720. For example, and throughout operation, the system may intermittently activate sensors to confirm removal or correct loading of components and materials. In any embodiment, the hemodialysis device can communicate through visual, audible, or tactile signals to the user during the process to confirm successful completion of setup tasks, or to provide corrective feedback to complete the task. [0392] In the next step, the user removes the cleaning manifold 913 and removes cleaning and/or disinfection concentrate cartridge 914. The user can drain the contents of cleaning manifold reservoir 915, for example, by gravity, into a suitable disposal and the cleaning manifold 840 can be retained for re-use at completion of the next therapy session. [0393] Referring now to FIG. 10, therapy setup procedure 902 begins in step 920 and the user can install a the disposable and consumable therapy components 921. For example, referring to FIG. 1, arterial pinch valve 402 and venous pinch valve 401 can be opened so that blood lines 102 and 105 of extracorporeal flow path 100 can be inserted. With reference to FIG’s. 5C and 5D, the user can place disposable and consumable components that are optionally arranged as therapy cassette 820 onto the invention and engage latch mechanism 805 wherein the arterial pinch valve 402 and venous pinch valve 401 are reset to the normally closed position. In any embodiment, sensors may be used to confirm that the disposable and consumable components or therapy cassette 820 are properly engaged and user interface 801 can signal to user that task is successfully completed, or provide corrective feedback to complete the task. [0394] The user then can install the solution reservoir 922. Referring to FIG.’s 1 and 5Ε, if a solution reservoir 201 has been included in a cassette such as 820, user can re-position solution reservoir 201 from therapy cassette 820 and place it in the operating position on system. In any embodiment, optional sensors may be used to confirm the solution reservoir is properly placed and the user interface can signal to the user that the solution reservoir installation task is successfully completed, or can provide corrective feedback to complete the task. [0395] Next, the user can install the sorbent cartridge 923 as shown in FIG. 10. In an embodiment shown in FIG.s 1 and 5Ε, the user can install the sorbent cartridge 703 on system and connect the sorbent cartridge 703 inlet and outlet ports 513, 514 to the controlled compliant flow path connectors, respectively. In any embodiment, sensors may be used to confirm the sorbent cartridge has been properly engaged and signals sent to user that task is successfully completed such that the sensors can provide corrective feedback to complete the task. [0396] Then, the user can install the water reservoir 924 as shown in FIG. 10. In an embodiment illustrated in FIG.’s 1 and 5D, the user can fill water reservoir 202 with potable water or other types of water suitable for use in the present invention, place it on the therapy system, and connect it to the fluid intake ports 509S and 510S of the system. In any embodiment, the user can transport water including potable water to the water reservoir 202 and fill it in place on the system. In any embodiment, sensors may be used to confirm that the water reservoir 202 is properly filled and engaged wherein the user interface signals to user that the water reservoir installation task is successfully completed, or provides corrective feedback to complete the task. [0397] In the next step, the user can verify that the setup sequence is complete 925. In any embodiment, the user interface can display a message that the setup sequence has been successfully completed and prompt the user for authorization to initiate a system priming sequence. [0398] A detailed priming procedure is shown in FIG. 11. First, the user can initiate the priming procedure 931 to fill and prime a hemodialysis device dialysate flow path and extracorporeal flow path. In any embodiment, the filling and priming process can be automatically performed by the hemodialysis device. For example, in an embodiment shown in FIG.’s 2 and 5Ε, the user can initiate the priming sequence through a user interface and the fluid circuit priming sequence can proceed automatically under control of a controller. Next, the device can confirm it has entered the dialysate priming mode 932, for example, by displaying a message on the user interface. [0399] In the next step, a de-aeration procedure can be performed 933. For example, in an embodiment corresponding to FIG. 1C, the valves states can be switched or positioned to create a de-aeration recirculation fluid circuit loop. Fluid intake bypass valve 404 can open a flow path connecting water intake line 113 to the controlled compliant flow path in the direction of the heater 708 only, and de-aeration bypass valve 405 can open a flow path from the dialysate pump 305 to the de-aeration bypass conduit 112 only. In this example, the water intake pump 304 is not operated, thus causing any flow through de-aeration bypass conduit 112 to be directed back to the water reservoir 202 through water line 114. [0400] Further, the dialysate pump 305 can be operated to pull water into the circuit from water reservoir 202 through flow restriction 408 at a flow rate such that the absolute pressure of the fluid is reduced sufficiently, by the, within the restriction to release a majority of the dissolved air from solution and convert it to air bubbles that can be vented from the circuit through vent opening 512 in water reservoir 202 as the water returns to water reservoir 202. At the same time, optionally, heater 708 can be operated to heat the water flowing through the recirculating de-aeration loop to a predetermined temperature, further reducing the solubility of air in water and enhancing the de-aeration process. Optionally, the water can be circulated and heated in the de-aeration loop for a pre-determined time period sufficient to de-aerate the water. In certain embodiments, an optional air bubble detector 608 can be positioned in the de-aeration fluid loop to monitor and confirm that the air is sufficiently removed from the water. When air bubbles are no longer observed passing a bubble detector after a predetermined time, the water is sufficiently degassed to continue to the next step of the process. [0401] In the next step, a dialyzer bypass loop priming procedure can be performed 934 to mix a physiologic solution and store the solution in a reservoir. For example, in an embodiment corresponding to FIG. 1, the valve states can be set to create the mixing and filling fluid circuit. Fluid intake bypass valve 404 closes the water inlet path through flow restrictor 408 and opens the controlled compliant flow path between pumps 303 and 304. De-aeration bypass valve 405 closes the de-aeration bypass conduit 112 and opens the controlled compliant flow path from dialysate pump 305 through sorbent cartridge 703, and dialyzer bypass valve 407 is set to direct flow from the outlet port 519 of degassing module 705 to the bypass flow path 111. Passing water through the materials contained in the sorbent cartridge can purify the water by removing organic, inorganic and microbial contamination from the water as the water passes through the sorbent cartridge. [0402] With reference to FIG. 1, the dialysate loop can initially be filled as water intake pump 304 and dialysate pump 305 begin pumping to intake water and recirculate it through the bypass flow path 111. Water pump 304 can be operated until the fluid pressure measured at pressure sensor 610 rises to a predetermined level. The rate of water pump 304 is then controlled to maintain the fluid pressure within a predetermined range by pumping in additional fluid as air is exhausted from the fluid circuit through degassing module 705. Bubble detector 608 can be monitored and the recirculation continued until no more air is detected in the line. In any embodiment, air from the operating portion of the controlled compliant flow path can be trapped in degas module 705 and exhausted through vent port 517 and vent control valve 410 during this sequence. [0403] In the next step, a buffering loop priming procedure can be performed 935. For example, in an embodiment in accordance with FIG. 1, in order to prime the dry sodium bicarbonate cartridge 204, salination valve 406 can open a flow path through outlet port 523 of bicarbonate cartridge 204 to the junction with the controlled compliant flow path between pump 303 and pump 304, and the salination pump 307 can be started while water intake pump 304 and dialysate pump 305 continue to operate as per the previous sequence. The buffering loop priming procedure is concluded when the air bubbles have passed bubble detector 608 and a conductivity increase is observed at conductivity sensor 613. In any embodiment, air from the bicarbonate cartridge 204 is moved to degas module 705, trapped, and exhausted from the fluid circuit at vent port 517 through vent control valve 410 during this sequence. [0404] Continuing to the next step, a salination loop priming procedure can be performed 936. For example, in an embodiment shown in FIG. 1, in order to prime the dry sodium chloride cartridge 203, salination valve 406 can open a flow path through outlet port 522 of sodium chloride cartridge 203 to the junction with the controlled compliant flow path between pump 303 and pump 304, and the water intake pump 304 and the dialysate pump 305 continue to operate according to the previously described sequence. The salination loop priming procedure is concluded when the air bubbles have passed bubble detector 608 and the conductivity reading observed at conductivity sensor 613 indicates that the desired physiologic sodium concentration level in the solution has been reached. In any embodiment, air from the sodium chloride cartridge 203 can be removed by the degassing module 705, trapped, and exhausted from the fluid circuit through vent port 517 and vent control valve 410 during this sequence. [0405] In the next step, a physiologic solution preparation can be performed 937. For example, the system can add a concentration of approximately 0.9% by weight of sodium chloride to the water that has been first purified by passing through the sorbent cartridge to produce a physiologically compatible solution for priming a hemodialysis system. A solution of this composition will be recognized by those of skill in the art as a physiologically compatible solution for contacting blood as part of a renal replacement therapy delivery process and is a solution commonly employed for priming a dialyzer and extracorporeal circuit and also as a solution for blood rinse back to a subject from the extracorporeal circuit at completion of a therapy session. For example, in an embodiment in accordance with FIG. 1, in order to mix a physiologic priming solution and store the physiologic solution in solution reservoir 201, fluid balance control pump 303 can be operated to move fluid from the fluid circuit to solution reservoir 201 while operating water intake pump 304 to pull water into the circuit at the same rate. The salination valve 406 can direct flow through the sodium chloride cartridge 203, and the salination pump 307 rate can be adjusted to a predetermined proportion of the water intake pump 304 rate to produce the desired solution sodium concentration while monitoring the conductivity of the mixed solution at conductivity sensor 613. [0406] The rate of salination pump 307 can be adjusted according to the conductivity readings to maintain the desired solution sodium concentration, wherein the salination pump rate is the volumetric flow rate of fluid passing through the conditioning conduit flow path 115. In any embodiment, during this sequence the salination valve 406 can be periodically switched or positioned to direct flow through bicarbonate cartridge 204 to infuse a desired amount of bicarbonate buffer into the solution. The physiologic solution preparation can be continued until a predetermined volume of solution has been produced and reserved in solution reservoir 201. For example, the total volume of required physiologic solution can be determined as the sum of the priming volume of dialyzer 701, the priming volume of the extracorporeal flow path 100, and a blood rinse-back reserve volume to be used at the end of the therapy session, and a predetermined fluid bolus reserve volume. The fluid bolus reserve volume can be held in reserve as a physiological-compatible fluid bolus infusion reserve volume to return to the subject if needed during therapy, such as for treatment of episodic intradialytic hypotension. Optionally, an additional predetermined volume can be prepared and reserved as a flushing fluid for a dialyzer and/or an extracorporeal flow path in reservoir 201 if a volume for additional rinsing of a dialyzer or an extracorporeal flow path is needed, such as in the case where a contaminant such as residual sterilant from the dialyzer manufacturing process is to be rinsed from a dialyzer and/or extracorporeal circuit or flow path. [0407] Then, a dialyzer loop priming procedure can be performed 938. For example, with reference to FIG. 1, in order to prime the remainder of the controlled compliant flow path and dialyzer, the water intake pump 304 and salination pump 307 can be stopped while bypass valve 407 is set to direct flow through the dialyzer and fluid balance control pump 303 operates to add solution volume from solution reservoir 201 back to the controlled compliant flow path 110 while dialysate pump 305 continues to operate. The trans-membrane pressure monitored by dialysate pressure sensors 606 and venous pressure 604 and fluid balance control pump 303 rate is controlled to ensure that the hollow fibers in the dialyzer 701 are not collapsed or damaged by exceeding their pressure capacity. [0408] In any embodiment, the therapy solution can be infused during this process with bicarbonate and electrolytes (for example, potassium, magnesium, glucose or calcium) per a dialysate prescription by switching salination valve 406 to bicarbonate cartridge 204 flow path and operating the salination pump 307 to infuse bicarbonate from cartridge 204, and operating acid concentrate pump 306 to infuse electrolytes from cation concentrate reservoir 205 to the priming solution per the desired dialysate prescription. In any embodiment, sorbent cartridge 703 can remove the majority of bacteria and endotoxin from the solution as it passes through the sorbent cartridge. Residual bacterial and endotoxin are removed from the solution prior to entering the dialyzer by first passing through endotoxin retentive microbial filter 706 located in the fluid circuit prior to the dialyzer inlet 506. Air from the remainder of the controlled compliant flow path and dialyzer is trapped in degas module 705 and exhausted through vent port 517 and vent control valve 410 during this sequence. The dialyzer priming procedure can continue for a predetermined time and until air bubbles are not observed at bubble detector 608, indicating that the controlled compliant flow path is completely filled. [0409] In the next step, a venous loop priming procedure can be performed 939. The physiologically compatible solution that has been passed into the dialyzer by the preceding steps can first be purified by passing the fluid through the sorbent cartridge wherein a physiologically compatible level of at least sodium chloride, for example approximately 0.9% by weight, has been added to the purified water. The solution can then be passed through a microbial filter 706 for removal of residual microbial contamination from the solution. When the solution flows through the dialyzer membrane to the blood, the dialyzer membrane 702 can serve as a final, redundant microbial filter. Thus, a physiologically compatible solution for contacting blood having a necessary microbiological purity is unexpectedly provided from potable or tap water by the present invention. For example, in an embodiment in accordance with FIG. 1, the pumps and valves in the dialysate loop can continue to operate as described in the previous sequence moving solution from the solution reservoir 201 to the controlled compliant volume fluid path of controlled compliant flow path 110 which is now filled, thus causing the solution to further back filter across the dialysis membrane 702 from the dialysate compartment to the blood compartment. In any embodiment, the dialyzer membrane 702 provides a redundant barrier to prevent bacteria and endotoxin from entering the blood compartment during priming of the extracorporeal flow path. [0410] As the pumps and valves of the dialysate loop continue to operate in the manner described, arterial pinch valve 402 remains closed and venous pinch valve 401 is opened. Referring also to FIG. 4Α, this action allows solution to fill the lumen of venous line 105 and displace the air out through venous connector 501 to an overflow bag 210 attached through a tee fitting 550 at the junction between arterial line connector 502 and venous line connector 501. In the case of the alternative configuration shown in FIG. 4Β, this action allows solution to fill the lumen of venous line 105 and displace air out of a hydrophobic vent membrane 560 at the junction of arterial line connector 502 and venous line connector 501. In the further case of alternative configuration shown in FIG. 4C, this action allows solution to fill the lumen of venous line 105 and displace air out through connector 501 into overflow bag 210. This process continues until a volume of fluid sufficient to displace the internal volume of venous line 105 and any desired additional flush volume has been pumped and no further bubbles are being detected at air-fluid (bubble) detector 603. Then venous pinch valve 401 is closed. Alternatively, in the example shown in FIG 4, the operation can be continued until the pressure reading increase at venous pressure sensor 604 indicates that the venous line 105 has been filled and no further air is detected by venous bubble detector 603. [0411] Next, an arterial loop priming procedure can be performed 940 as described in FIG. 11. For example, in an embodiment corresponding to FIG. 1, as the dialysate loop pumps and valves continue to operate in the manner described in the previous step, arterial pinch valve 402 is now opened and blood pump 302 is operated in reverse first to complete filling of the dialyzer blood compartment and finally arterial line 102. Referring also to FIG. 4Α, this action allows solution to fill the lumen of arterial line 102 and displace the air out through arterial connector 502 to an overflow bag 210 attached through a tee fitting 550 at the junction between arterial line connector 502 and venous line connector 501. In the case of the alternative configuration shown in FIG. 4Β, this action allows solution to fill the lumen of arterial line 102 and displace air out of a hydrophobic vent membrane 560 at the junction of arterial line connector 502 and venous line connector 501. In the further case of alternative configuration shown in FIG. 4C, this action allows solution to fill the lumen of arterial line 102 and displace air out through connector 502 into overflow bag 210. [0412] Blood pump 302 continues to operate until the desired volume of fluid has been pumped through arterial line 102 and no further bubbles are detected at arterial bubble detector 601. Then the arterial pinch valve 402 is closed. Alternatively, in any embodiment blood pump 302 can be operated until the pressure reading increase at arterial pressure sensor 602 indicates that the arterial line 102 has been filled and no further air is detected by arterial bubble detector 601, at which time the system stops all pumps and maintains arterial pinch valve 402 and venous pinch valve 401 in the closed position. [0413] In an alternative configuration shown in FIG. 4C, blood pump 302 can be operated to recirculate the solution that has filled extracorporeal circuit 100 by the actions of steps 938, 939 and 940 for a predetermined time through the dialyzer and extracorporeal circuit to rinse contaminants from the dialyzer and extracorporeal circuit such as residual sterilant or particulate residue that can be present in certain commercially available dialyzers and extracorporeal circuits. Following a predetermined recirculation, a volume for additional rinsing of a dialyzer or an extracorporeal flow path can be conveyed from reservoir 201 through the controlled compliant flow path to flush the contaminants and contaminated solution to overflow bag 210. [0414] Then, the system can confirm that the hemodialysis device is prepared for a therapy session 941. For example, the user interface can display a message to notify the user that priming is complete and system is ready for a therapy session. [0415] During steps 938, 939 and 940 the minimum volume of solution required to fill the blood compartment of the dialyzer and the extracorporeal circuit 100 can be referred to as the void volume or a priming volume of the extracorporeal flow path. [0416] FIG. 12 shows a therapy procedure 904 in accordance with the invention. The user can initiate the therapy procedure 950 by preparing blood access 951 per the patient’s normal blood access preparation procedure. Then, blood can be drawn into the arterial and venous lines of an extracorporeal flow path 952. For example, in an embodiment shown in FIG.’s 1, and 4A, 4Β or 4C, the user can separate the arterial line connector 502 from the priming connection and connects arterial line 102 of the extracorporeal flow path 100 to the arterial blood access 104 at arterial line connector 502. The user can then prompt the hemodialysis device through user interface 801 to start blood flow. [0417] Blood pump 302 can be operated with the arterial pinch valve 402 and venous pinch valve 401 open. Blood displaces the priming solution in extracorporeal flow path 100, first through arterial line 102, next through dialyzer 701, and then out through the venous line at 501 into overflow reservoir 210. Blood pump 302 stops when a volume of fluid approximately equal to the internal volume of the extracorporeal flow path has been displaced into priming overflow reservoir 210 by the pumped blood. Alternatively, the displaced priming solution can be discharged into a suitable container or a drain. The user can connect venous line 105 of extracorporeal flow path 100 to the patient’s venous blood access line 103 at connector 501. [0418] Alternatively, in any embodiment all of the priming solution can be retained in the system without requiring an overflow bag or discharge into a collection container. For example, the user can separate venous line 105 of extracorporeal flow path 100 from tee fitting 550 of the priming overflow reservoir 210 or, in some embodiments, from hydrophobic vent 560, and connects patient’s venous blood access 103 at connector 501. The user further can prompt the system through the user interface to start venous blood flow. The system can open venous pinch valve 401 and switches valve 407 to bypass mode or, in some embodiments, close degassing vent control valve 410 to prevent air from being drawn into the system by sub-atmospheric pressure in controlled compliant flow path 110 through port 517 and the hydrophobic vent membrane of degassing module 705. Fluid balance control pump 303 can be operated to pull the priming solution across dialysis membrane 702 from the blood compartment to the dialysate compartment and into solution reservoir 201. Fluid control pump 303 continues to operate until a predetermined volume of solution approximately equal to the internal volume of venous line 105 has pumped across dialysis membrane 702 to solution reservoir 201. Then fluid control pump 303 stops and venous pinch valve 401 closes. [0419] Next in any embodiment wherein all of the priming solution can be retained in the system without requiring an overflow bag or discharge into a collection container, the user interface 801 can prompt the user to connect arterial line 102 of extracorporeal flow path 100 to the arterial line 104 of the patient’s blood access at connector 502, and the user can connect arterial line 102 of extracorporeal flow path 100 to the arterial connector of the patient’s blood access line 104 at connector 502. In any embodiment, the user can confirm through user interface 801 that the arterial blood access is connected. The system can open arterial pinch valve 402 and start blood pump 302 and fluid balance control pump 303 at equal pumping rates to displace a volume of solution approximately equal to the sum of the internal volumes of arterial line 102 and dialyzer 701 blood compartment across dialysis membrane 702 and into the solution reservoir 201. Then the fluid balance control pump 303 can be stopped and venous pinch valve 401 opened to allow blood pump 302 to pump blood through the complete extracorporeal flow path and back to the subject through venous blood access line 103. [0420] In the next step, a therapy sequence can be executed 953. For example, a therapy process control algorithm can be executed to accomplish the dialysis prescription as follows: The dialysate pump 305, the blood pump 302 and the heparin pump 301 each can be operated at their respective prescribed flow rates. Dialysate temperature can be controlled by heater 708 in closed loop with temperature measurements from a temperature sensor, such as sensor 612, or any appropriate location in controlled compliant flow path 110. In certain embodiments, the acid concentrate pump 306 can be operated at a controlled ratio to the dialysate flow rate to infuse the dialysate with the proper concentration of cations, such as K+, Mg++, Ca++ from cation concentrate reservoir 205. Other solutes, for example glucose and/or acetic acid, may also be included in the cation concentrate in reservoir 205 as per the dialysis prescription, and thereby added at the prescribed concentration to the dialysate by this means, and salination valve 406 can be operated to direct flow through bicarbonate cartridge 204 and the salination pump 307 is operated at a controlled rate to infuse the dialysate with the prescribed level of bicarbonate buffer. Control of the dialysate sodium level can be accomplished by sensing conductivity at conductivity sensor 613 and operating water pump 304 to add water to reduce sodium level or, alternatively, switching salination valve 406 to direct flow through sodium chloride cartridge 203 and operating salination pump 307 to infuse sodium chloride concentrate into the dialysate to increase the sodium level, while control of the patient fluid removal rate is accomplished by controlling the fluid balance control pump 303. When the control pump 303 withdraws fluid volume from the controlled volume controlled compliant flow path 110 to the solution reservoir 201 in excess of the volumes added by pumps 304 and 306 a volume of fluid equal to the excess amount is drawn from the patient’s blood across dialysis membrane 702 to controlled compliant flow path 110. [0421] Because the controlled compliant flow path 110 has a fixed volume, net fluid removal is controlled and determined according to the following formula: Patient Fluid Balance + Fluid Balance Control Pump + Water Pump + Acid Cone, pump ςγ=ο χΐ =ο [0422] One skilled in the art will recognize that both constant and varying profiles of patient ultrafiltration rate and dialysate sodium levels can be accomplished through this algorithm. As provided herein, the term X refers to the volumetric flow rate of a pump where the number of pumps can range for η from 0 to 20. The term "n from 0 to 20" means any integer value of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 ,16, 17, 18, 19, or 20. [0423] In any embodiment, a fluid bolus can optionally be added 955. For example, in an embodiment in accordance with FIG. 1, the user may request a fluid bolus through user interface 801. Fluid bolus is provided to the subject at a controlled rate and to a controlled total volume by changing the rate of fluid balance control pump 303 such that net fluid is added to controlled compliant flow path 110 from control reservoir 201 according to the preceding formula. Because controlled compliant flow path 110 has a substantially inflexible void volume, any net fluid added to controlled compliant flow path 110 will be passed across dialysis membrane 702 to the blood compartment and the patient. Check valve 403 ensures that any fluid added to controlled compliant flow path 110 cannot enter the dialyzer through port 507, but rather, the bolus solution is forced to travel only toward the sorbent cartridge 703 and is purified by first flowing through sorbent cartridge 703 , gas bubbles are removed by flowing through degassing module 705 and then through microbial filter 706 before passing into the dialyzer. Finally, the fluid can first pass through the dialyzer membrane before contacting the blood, with the dialyzer membrane serving as a redundant filtration step to ensure microbial purity of the fluid volume passing to the blood. [0424] In other embodiments, such as the system for hemofiltration shown in Fig. ID and the system for hemodiafiltration shown in Fig. IE, a physiologically compatible solution for infusion to a subject is produced by passing the fluid exiting microbial filter 706 through an additional microbial filter 709 that can act as a redundant filtration step to ensure microbial purity of the fluid before it enters extracorporeal circuit 100 at port 538 and is passed to the subject. [0425] The sodium level can be assessed by monitoring conductivity at sensor 613 and if the sodium level of the bolus solution deviates from the desired value, the solution is sent through bypass flow path 111 by valve 407 and circulated until the sodium level is adjusted by either adding water from reservoir 202 through water pump 304 to lower sodium concentration in the bolus solution by dilution, or by infusing sodium through sodium chloride cartridge 203 to increase sodium concentration in the bolus solution. In any embodiment, the bolus fluid can be re-infused with electrolytes by cation concentrate from reservoir 205 metered by acid concentrate pump 306. The solution is further filtered through microbial filter 706 to remove residual microorganisms and endotoxin, and next across dialysis membrane 702 to the blood compartment and to the patient. In any embodiment, dialysis membrane 702 provides a redundant microbiological barrier between the dialysate compartment and the blood compartment. [0426] The therapy process continues until the dialysis prescription is completed 955. Alternatively, the user can request to end the therapy process. If therapy is successfully completed per the dialysis prescription, the system can provide notification through user interface 801 that the therapy session is completed. [0427] FIG. 13 shows a blood rinse-back procedure 905 in accordance with the invention. The user can initiate the rinse-back procedure 960, for example, by entering a request through the user interface for blood rinse back or blood rinse back can begin automatically at the conclusion of a therapy session. Through operations as described in preceding steps, the fluid in the controlled compliant flow loop 110 and reservoir 201 can be comprised of filtrate from the blood of the subject and a physiologically compatible solution that has been has been first purified by passing through the sorbent cartridge that has a physiologically compatible level of at least sodium chloride, for example approximately 140 mEq/L. Before entering the dialyzer, the fluid is further passed through microbial filter 706 for removal of residual microbial contamination from the fluid. When the solution is further passed through the dialyzer membrane to the blood, the dialyzer membrane serves as a final, redundant microbial filter. Thus, a physiologically compatible solution for blood rinse back to a subject can be provided with necessary microbiological purity. In any embodiment, the user can control the sequence of arterial line 102 and venous line 105 rinse back by selecting through user interface 801 which line to rinse back first. Then, the arterial line can be rinsed back 961. For example, in an embodiment corresponding to FIG.’s 1 and 2, blood can be rinsed back to the patient from arterial line 102 by operating the fluid control pump 303 to add fluid back to controlled compliant flow path 110 from solution reservoir 201 to cause solution to move from the controlled compliant flow path 110 across dialysis membrane 702 to the blood compartment. Venous pinch valve 401 can be closed and blood pump 302 is operated in reverse direction at the same rate as fluid control pump 303 is adding solution to controlled compliant flow path 110. In this manner, a solution volume sufficient to rinse the volume of blood from the blood compartment of dialyzer 701 and arterial line 102 back to the patient is pumped and then fluid balance control pump 303 and blood pump 302 are stopped. In any embodiment, the user can prompt through the user interface to return an additional increment of fluid for further rinse back of arterial line 102, or acknowledge that arterial line 102 is sufficiently rinsed back. When the user confirms through user interface 801 that arterial line 102 is sufficiently rinsed back, arterial pinch valve 402 closes to prevent further fluid ingress or egress through arterial blood access line 104. [0428] Next, the venous line can be rinsed back 962 as described in FIG. 13. Blood can be rinsed back to the patient from the venous line by operating fluid balance control pump 303 in an embodiment corresponding to FIG.’s 1 and 2 to add solution back to controlled compliant flow path 110 from solution reservoir 201 to cause solution to move from the controlled compliant flow path 110 across dialysis membrane 702 to the blood compartment. Venous pinch valve 401 is opened to allow the solution to push the blood out of the venous line 105 to the patient. Fluid balance control pump 303 continues to operate until a fluid volume sufficient to rinse the blood volume from venous line 105 back to the patient has been pumped and then fluid balance control pump 303 is stopped. In any embodiment, the user can enter prompts through user interface 801 to return additional increments of solution for further rinse back of venous line 105, or acknowledge that venous line 105 is sufficiently rinsed back. When the user acknowledges that venous line 105 is sufficiently rinsed back, venous pinch valve 401 closes to prevent further fluid ingress or egress through venous blood access line 103. [0429] In the next step, the user can disconnect the blood access 963, for example by disconnecting patient blood access lines 103 and 104 from connection ports 501 and 502 of extracorporeal flow path 100 per the patient’s normal blood access procedures. Then, the user can verify the rinse-back is complete 964. For example, in any embodiment the user can communicate via user interface 801 that patient’s blood access disconnection has been completed. [0430] FIG. 14 shows an evacuation procedure 906 in accordance with the invention. For ease of shutdown and disposal, evacuation procedure 970 can move fluid volume remaining in the system to a reservoir, for example reservoir 201. The fluid volumes moved can include fluid volume from an extracorporeal flow path, consisting of solution that remains in the extracorporeal circuit 100 after the blood has been rinsed back; fluid volume from an infusate reservoir, consisting of solution that remains in an infusate reservoir at the end of a therapy session such as fluid remaining in reservoir 205; fluid volume removed from a conditioning conduit flow path, such as fluid remaining at the end of a therapy session in conditioning conduit flow path 115; fluid volume removed from a bypass conduit, such as fluid volume remaining in bypass flow path 111; and fluid volume removed from a solution flow conduit, including flow paths such as 110 or 120. The evacuation procedure can be initiated 970, for example, by the user entering a request through the user interface. First, the arterial line can be evacuated 971. For example, the system can remove the rinse back solution from arterial line 102 by opening arterial pinch valve 402 and operating blood pump 302 and fluid control pump 303 toward solution reservoir 201 to move the solution from arterial line 102 across dialysis membrane 702 to controlled compliant flow path 110 and into solution reservoir 201. Arterial pinch valve 402 can be closed and blood pump 302 stopped when a solution volume sufficient to drain arterial line 102 has been pumped. [0431] Next, the venous line can be evacuated 972. For example, the system can remove the rinse back solution from venous line 105, dialyzer 701, microbial filter 706, and the portion of controlled compliant flow path 110 from dialyzer inlet 506 to degassing module outlet 519 by opening venous pinch valve 401, closing degassing vent valve 410, and operating dialysate pump 305 in the reverse direction. Fluid balance control pump 303 continues to remove fluid from controlled compliant flow path 110 into solution reservoir 201 during this step. Pumping continues until a volume of fluid sufficient to drain this portion of the fluid circuit has been moved to solution reservoir 201 and then dialysate pump 305 is stopped. Control pump 303 continues to operate in the efflux direction and fluid in the portion of controlled compliant flow path 110 between dialyzer outlet 507 and control pump 303 is moved to reservoir 201, and then venous pinch valve 401 is closed and valve 407 is positioned to bypass flow path 111. With control pump 303 continuing to operate in the efflux direction, vent valve 410 is opened to drain the degassing module 705 and that portion of the controlled compliant flow path 110 from degassing module outlet 519 to bypass valve 407. Pumping continues until a volume of fluid sufficient to drain this portion of the fluid circuit has been moved to solution reservoir 201. [0432] Then, in the next step, electrolyte cartridges can be drained 973. For example, the sodium chloride cartridge 203, bicarbonate cartridge 204, and connecting lines can be drained to a void volume created within main controlled compliant flow path 110 by the preceding step. To accomplish this, fluid balance control pump 303 is stopped, bypass valve 407 is positioned or switched back to dialyzer inlet flow path, degassing vent valve 410 is opened, venous pinch valve 401 is opened, and salination pump 307 operates in reverse direction while the salination valve is directed alternately between sodium chloride cartridge 203 flow path and bicarbonate cartridge 204 flow path. This action moves the fluid to temporary storage created in degassing module 705 and controlled compliant flow path 110 by previous actions. When a volume of fluid sufficient to drain both cartridges and the conditioning flow path 115 lines has been pumped to degas module 705 and main controlled compliant flow path 110, salination pump 307 is stopped. [0433] In the next step, the bypass loop and degassing module can be evacuated 974. For example, with reference to FIG. 1, the portion of controlled compliant flow path 110 between degassing module 705 outlet 519 and dialyzer 701 can be drained by operating dialysate pump 305 in reverse with venous pinch valve 401 remaining open, vent valve 410 closed, and control pump 303 operating in an efflux direction until a volume sufficient to drain the volume of fluid re-introduced to that portion of controlled compliant flow path 110 by the preceding drainage of sodium chloride cartridge 203 and bicarbonate cartridge 204 has been removed to control reservoir 201. Then dialysate pump 305 is stopped, venous pinch valve 401 is closed and bypass valve 407 is positioned or switched to direct flow through bypass flow path 111 and degassing vent valve 410 is opened with control pump 303 continuing to operate in the efflux direction. Fluid balance control pump 303 operates to move fluid to therapy solution reservoir 201 until a volume of fluid sufficient to drain degassing module 705, the portion of the controlled compliant flow path 110 from degassing module outlet 519 to valve 407, and priming and recirculation bypass flow path 111 has been moved to solution reservoir 201. [0434] Then, the dialysate loop can be drained 975. For example, with reference to FIG. 1, the remainder of controlled compliant flow path 110 can be drained. Dialysate pump 305 can be operated in reverse with vent valve 410 open and fluid balance control pump 303 operating in the efflux direction to move fluid remaining in controlled compliant flow path 110 between degassing module 705 inlet 516 and fluid balance control pump 303 to solution reservoir 201. Finally, all pumps are stopped and the degassing vent control valve 410 is closed. In any embodiment, the user interface can display a message to the user that the evacuation procedure is complete, and that therapy cassette 820 may be removed and replaced with cleaning manifold 840.lt will be recognized from the detailed description of this invention that solution reservoir 201 functions as a common reservoir of solution or fluid volume used for multiple purposes and originating from multiple sources or locations within the system. The reservoir may contain any one of a dialysate, a filtrate, a volume of a physiologically compatible priming solution, a volume of a physiologically compatible solution to provide a bolus of fluid to a subject receiving treatment, a volume of physiologically compatible solution to provide solution for return of blood from an extracorporeal flow path to a subject receiving treatment, a volume of solution returned to the common reservoir from an extracorporeal flow path when blood from a subject is introduced to the extracorporeal flow path, and combinations thereof. Solution reservoir 201 further can receive fluids that are drained from the extracorporeal flow path, the controlled compliant flow path, and/or an infusate reservoir following conclusion of a treatment. [0435] FIG. 15 shows a cleaning and disinfection procedure 907 in accordance with the invention. The cleaning and disinfection procedure can be initiated 981, for example, by the user acknowledging through user interface the user’s intent to remove the disposable and consumable components, optionally grouped into a therapy cassette. In the next step, the user can remove the therapy cassette 982. For example, in an embodiment corresponding to FIG.’s 1, 5G, 6A and 6Β, arterial pinch valve 402 and venous pinch valve 401 can be opened to allow arterial line 102 and venous line 105 to be disengaged for cassette removal, and the user can remove the therapy cassette. Then, the user can install a cleaning manifold 983. For example, the user can remove the therapy cassette 820 and install cleaning manifold 840 in place of therapy cassette 820 on the system. In any embodiment, sensors can be activated to confirm correct loading of the cleaning manifold. In any embodiment, the system may optionally communicate through visual, audible, or tactile signals to user during the process to confirm successful task completion, or to provide corrective feedback. [0436] In the next step, a water reservoir can be filled. For example, the system can display a message on the user interface 801 to prompt the user to fill water reservoir 202 with sufficient water, including potable water, to execute the cleaning and disinfection cycle. It is noted the system is not limited to potable water but can include other types of water prepared and/or treated by those of ordinary skill in the art suitable for use in the present dialysis systems and methods contemplated by the present invention including peritoneal dialysis, hemodiafiltration and hemodialysis. The required amount of water can further be displayed on the user interface. In any embodiment, water reservoir 202 can include a visual indicator of the minimum fill level for this process. The user can fill water reservoir 202 and reconnect it to cleaning manifold 820 connection ports 509ΒΜ and 510ΒΜ. Alternatively, in any embodiment, the user can transport water or potable water to water reservoir 202 and fill it in place on the system. In some embodiments, sensors can be activated to confirm correct filling and reconnection of the water reservoir. [0437] In any embodiment, the system can intake and degas water from the water reservoir 202 according to the same procedure as previously described under the de-aeration procedure described herein. With reference to FIG. 3, the system can purify water from water reservoir 202 by passing the water through the sorbent cartridge 703 while the pumps and valves are sequenced to flush clean water through each fluid circuit component to the integral fluid reservoir contained in the cleaning manifold in order to flush residual therapy solutions from controlled compliant flow path 110, the conditioning flow path 115 through pump 307 and valve 406, bypass flow path 111, which can function in the present embodiment to bypass the dialyzer, and also metering pumps 303, 304, and 306 prior to further cleaning and/or disinfection. [0438] In the next step, a cleaning and/or disinfection concentrate cartridge is installed 985. For example, the user interface 801 can prompt the user to remove sorbent cartridge 703 and connect the cleaning and/or disinfection concentrate cartridge 720 into the controlled compliant flow path in place of sorbent cartridge 703 at connection ports 513 and 514. The user can acknowledge through user interface 801 that the cleaning and/or disinfection concentrate cartridge 720 is installed. In any embodiment, sensors can be activated to confirm correct connection of the cleaning solution concentrate cartridge. [0439] In the next step, a cleaning and/or disinfection sequence can be executed 986. For example, the user can enter a prompt through user interface 801 to start an automated cleaning and/or disinfection cycle. After this action, the user may not be required to be present for the remainder of the process. The system can first circulate the water contained in the controlled compliant flow path and jumper lumens of the cleaning reservoir in a recirculating loop through the cleaning and/or disinfection solution concentrate cartridge by operating the pumps and valves of controlled compliant flow path 110 to mix and distribute the cleaning and/or disinfection solution concentrate uniformly through all fluid pathways. The system heater 708 can heat the circulating cleaning and/or disinfection solution to a sufficient temperature to clean and disinfect the fluid circuit while continuing to operate the pumps and valves to circulate the cleaning and/or disinfection solution through all fluid pathways until the disinfection process temperature is reached. The fluid temperature is monitored at control points to confirm that the solution has reached the required disinfection temperature throughout the fluid circuit. The system continues to monitor and control the fluid at the required disinfection temperature while operating the pumps and valves to circulate the heated cleaning and/or disinfection solution through all fluid pathways until the required time at temperature is completed. When the cleaning and/or disinfection cycle has been completed, the heater and system pumps can be shut down. Optionally, the pumps can continue to run briefly following heater shutdown to allow residual heat to be safely dissipated from the heater. [0440] In the next step, the hemodialysis system or device can be stored 987. For example, in an embodiment corresponding to FIG. 6Β, the cleaning and/or disinfection solution can remain in the fluid circuit and the cleaning manifold 840 can be left in place on the system until the system is needed for the next therapy session. In any embodiment, the hemodialysis device can be folded into the storage and transport configuration with the fluid circuit filled with the cleaning and/or disinfection solution and the cleaning manifold in place to ensure that contamination is not introduced to the fluid pathways prior to the next use. [0441] The FIG.’s and specific examples provided herein illustrate a possible embodiment of the invention and are non-limiting with respect to the specific physical geometries of the various components depicted in the illustrations. It will be apparent to one skilled in the art that various combinations and/or modifications can be made in the systems and methods described herein depending upon the specific needs for operation.
