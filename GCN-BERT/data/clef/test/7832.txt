2-((3,5-dimethyl-1-phenyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)amino)-2-oxoethyl 2-(4-fluoro-1H-indol-1-yl)acetate
Step 1: ethyl 2-(4-fluoro-1H-indol-1-yl)acetate
To a suspension of NaH (76 mg, 1.90 mmol, 60% in oil) in anhydrous THF (2.0 mL) was added a solution of 4-fluoroindole (225 mg, 1.67 mmol) in anhydrous DMF (3 mL + 2 mL rinse) dropwise via cannula at 0 °C under argon. The reaction mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature, and after 45 min, was cooled to 0 °C at which time ethyl bromoacetate (0.22 mL, 2.0 mmol) was added. The reaction was warmed to room temperature, and after 5 h, the reaction was quenched with aqueous NH4Cl (30 mL) and diluted with EtOAc (20 mL). The two layers were separated and the aqueous layer was extracted with EtOAc (2 x 10 mL). The combined organics were washed with brine (10 mL), dried (MgSO4), filtered, and concentrated in vacuo. Purification by column chromatography (20% EtOAc in petroleum ether) gave 349 mg (94%) of the title compound
