Preparation of compound 1-h.
Compound 1-i (500 mg, 2.02 mmol) was dissolved in dichloromethane (5 mL), activated manganese dioxide (270 mg, 3.04 mmol) was added and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 3 hours. The reaction mixture was filtered through diatomite and the filter cake was washed with dichloromethane (5 mL Ã— 4). The combined filtrates were concentrated under reduced pressure to deliver a white solid 1-h (430 mg, yield: 86%), this product was used without further purification.
