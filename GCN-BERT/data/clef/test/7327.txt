Example 115A
6-Bromo-3-cyano-2-phenylquinoline-4-carboxylic acid
A mixture of 1.85 g (8.18 mmol) of 5-bromo-1H-indole-2,3-dione in 10 ml of water and 9.0 ml (9.0 mmol) of 1 M aqueous potassium hydroxide solution was stirred at 40° C. for 2 h. After cooling to RT, the solid present was filtered off and the filtrate was concentrated on a rotary evaporator to a volume of about 5 ml. This concentrate was added to a solution of 1.19 g (8.18 mmol) of 3-oxo-3-phenylpropanenitrile in 10 ml of ethanol and the mixture was stirred at 100° C. overnight. After cooling to RT, the solid present was filtered off, stirred in a diethyl ether/acetone mixture (3:1), filtered off again and dried under reduced pressure. 1.18 g (41% of theory, 100% purity) of the title compound were obtained.
