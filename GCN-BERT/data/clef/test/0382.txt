Synthesis of compound 22-b
Compound 4-c (80mg, 0.24mmol) was added to a suspension of ethyl 2-methyl-2-mercaptopropionate (71mg, 0.48mmol) and potassium carbonate (100mg, 0.72mmol) in DMF (2mL). The mixture was stirred at 130°C for 2hrs, cooled to room temperature, followed by adding water (20mL), being extracted with EA (20mL×3). The organic phases were combined, washed in turn with water (20mL×3) and saturated brine (20mL), dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified with silica preparative plate (PE:EA = 3:1) to give yellow oil 22-b (75mg, yield 78%).
