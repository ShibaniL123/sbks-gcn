As illustrated in Figure 4, together a monoblock offset stem element (10) of the present invention and a bushing (50) of the present invention form a prosthesis system (100) of the present invention. The usage of the prosthesis system (100) depends of the diameter of the intramedullary canal of a patient's long bone. In an embodiment, the prosthesis system of the present invention achieve optimal fit of prosthesis components while still reducing the inventory of joint prosthesis parts that are needed to meet patient needs. Regarding inventory, in an embodiment a kit of the present invention includes monoblock stem extensions available under (Z) offset options as well as bushings available under (Y) diameter options and (X) lengths. In an embodiment, a component set of the present invention requires (X*Y+Z) components. In an embodiment, a kit of the present invention includes a first monoblock stem extension of the present invention having a second neutral axis that is offset from a first neutral axis by a distance α1; a second monoblock stem extension of the present invention having a second neutral axis that is offset from a first neutral axis by a distance α2, wherein α1 and α2 are not equal; and at least two bushings of the present invention available under multiple diameter options and multiple lengths. In an embodiment, a kit of the present invention includes first monoblock stem extension of the present invention having a second neutral axis that is offset from a first neutral axis by a distance α1 ; a second monoblock stem extension of the present invention having a second neutral axis that is offset from a first neutral axis by a distance α2, wherein α1 and α2 are not equal; a first bushing of the present invention; and a second eccentric bushing of the present invention, wherein the center of the circle formed by the outside diameter of the external cylindrical shaft of the second eccentric bushing is at a different point from the center of the circle formed by the inside diameter of the internal cylinder of the second eccentric bushing so the two circles are not concentric. In an embodiment, a kit of the present invention includes first monoblock stem extension of the present invention having a second neutral axis that is offset from a first neutral axis by a distance α1; a second monoblock stem extension of the present invention having a second neutral axis that is offset from a first neutral axis by a distance α2, wherein α1 and α2 are not equal; at least two first bushings of the present invention available under multiple diameter options and multiple lengths; and at least two second eccentric bushings of the present invention available under multiple lengths, wherein the center of the circle formed by the outside diameter of the external cylindrical shaft of the second eccentric bushing is at a different point from the center of the circle formed by the inside diameter of the internal cylinder of the second eccentric bushing so the two circles are not concentric. In an embodiment, a surgeon selects a bushing from a kit that features a diameter similar to the diameter of the intramedullary canal of the patient's tibia and assembles it to a monoblock offset stem extension. In an embodiment, a locking element of the bushing is designed to match a locking element of the monoblock offset stem extension). Also, the internal cylinder of the bushing is compatible with the external cylinder of the monoblock offset stem extension. Finally, the length of the external cylindrical shaft of the bushing is preferably shorter than the length of the cylindrical shaft of the monoblock offset stem extension, so the distal extremity of the cylindrical shaft can protrude from the distal extremity from the external cylindrical shaft. Figures 5A and SB show the range of adjustment of the offset for the bushing of the first embodiment of the present invention and the eccentric bushing of the second embodiment of the present invention. In Figure SB, an eccentric bushing (50) is illustrated in which the external cylindrical shaft (51) of the bushing (50) features a neutral axis (51a) parallel but offset by a distance β from the neutral axis (50a) defined by the internal cylinder (53) of the bushing (50). Such situation is particularly advantageous as both offsets a and β can be added or subtracted in order to adjust the offset of the anatomical long bone. In an embodiment, bushing (50) is positioned over the longitudinal cylindrical shaft (31) of the monoblock offset stem element (10) in a first position and then rotated around the longitudinal cylindrical shaft (31) to a second position so as to result in an offset that is equal to α + β. In an embodiment, bushing (50) is positioned over the longitudinal cylindrical shaft (31) of the monoblock offset stem element (10) in a first position and then rotated around the longitudinal cylindrical shaft (31) to a second position so as to result in an offset that is equal to α - β. An eccentric bushing (50) of the present invention is one which has the center of the circle formed by the outside diameter of the external cylindrical shaft (51) which is at a different point from the center of the circle formed by the inside diameter of the internal cylinder (53), so the two circles are not concentric. Eccentricity can be checked by determining the wall thickness around the bushing (50) at any cross section to establish maximum and minimum. In an embodiment, the neutral axis (50a) and the neutral axis (51 a) are offset from each other by a distance β of between about 0.25 mm to about 5 mm.

In an embodiment, the neutral axis (50a) and the neutral axis (51 a) are offset from each other by a distance β of about 0.75 mm. In an embodiment, the neutral axis (50a) and the neutral axis (5 la) are ofiset from each other by a distance β of about 1 mm. In an embodiment, the neutral axis (50a) and the neutral axis (51a) are offset from each other by a distance β of about 1.25 mm. In an embodiment, the neutral axis (50a) and the neutral axis (51a) are ofiset from each other by a distance β of about l.S mm. In an embodiment, the neutral axis (50a) and the neutral axis (51a) are offset from each other by a distance β of about 1.75 mm. In an embodiment, the neutral axis (50a) and the neutral axis (51a) are offset from each other by a distance β of about 2 mm. In an embodiment, the third axis (50a) and the neutral axis (51a) are ofiset from each other by a distance β of about 2.25 mm. In an embodiment, the neutral axis (50a) and the neutral axis (51a) are offset from each other by a distance β of about 2.5 mm. In an embodiment, the neutral axis (50a) and the neutral axis (51a) are offset from each other by a distance β of about 2.75 mm. In an embodiment, the neutral axis (50a) and the neutral axis (51a) are offset from each other by a distance β of about 3 mm. In an embodiment, the neutral axis (50a) and the neutral axis (51a) are ofiset from each other by a distance β of about 3.25 mm. In an embodiment, the neutral axis (50a) and the neutral axis (51a) are offset from each other by a distance β of about 3.S mm. In an embodiment, the neutral axis (50a) and the neutral axis (51a) are ofiset from each other by a distance β of about 3.75 mm. In an embodiment, the neutral axis (50a) and the neutral axis (Sla) are ofiset from each other by a distance β of about 4 mm In an embodiment, the neutral axis (50a) and the neutral axis (51a) are offset from each other by a distance β of about 4.25 mm. In an embodiment, the neutral axis (50a) and the neutral axis (5 la) are offset from each other by a distance β of about 4.5 mm. In an embodiment, the neutral axis (50a) and the neutral axis (51a) are ofiset from each other by a distance β of about 4.75 mm. In an embodiment, the neutral axis (50a) and the neutral axis (51a) are offset from each other by a distance β of about 5 mm. With respect to Figure 5A, in an embodiment the neutral axis (50a) of the bushing (50) or the neutral axis (30a) of the cylindrical shaft (31) can rotate around the neutral axis (20a) of the first locking element (21) by an offset of a. With respect to Figure 5B, in an embodiment the neutral axis (51a) of bushing (50) can rotate around the neutral axis (50a) of the internal cylinder (53) by an offset of β; which is substantially co-linear with the neutral axis (30a) of the cylindrical shaft (31); which can itself rotate around the neutral axis (20a) of the proximal portion (20) by an offset of a; which results into the neutral axis (51a) of bushing (50) being located relative to the neutral axis (20a) of the proximal portion (20) inside an area defined by α±β. If α=β, then the combination of the monoblock offset stem extension (10) with the bushing (50) allows the full adjustment of the offset inside a circle having a radius of α+β. Such eccentric bushing (50) is particularly appealing from inventory, as the system monoblock stem extension available under 1 offset option as well as bushing available under (Y) diameter options and (X) length. In an embodiment, a component set of the present invention requires (X*Y+1) components. According to another embodiment, a locking element (not represented) can be added (preferably at the distal extremity) to the cylindrical shaft (31) of the monoblock stem extension (10) in order to fully assemble the locking elements. Figures 6A, 6B, 6C and 6D are representations of random positions of the component system assembled with a tibial tray (0). Due to the offset (a) between the first neutral axis (20a) of the proximal portion (20) and the second neutral axis (30a) of the longitudinal cylindrical shaft (31) then the second neutral axis (30a) of the longitudinal cylindrical shaft (31) and the third neutral axis (50a) of the internal cylinder (53) of the bushing (50) is located on a circle centered on the first neutral axis (20a) of the proximal portion (20) of the monoblock stem extension; which the circle has a radius equal to a. Towards this end, Figure 6A and 6B represent a singular position where the third neutral axis (50a) of the internal cylinder (53) of the bushing (50) adjusts a tibial offset from both an antero-posterior (α AP) and medio-lateral (α ML) point of views. Figure 6C and 6D represent a singular position where the third neutral axis (50a) internal cylinder (53) of the bushing (50) is fully shifted along the medial or lateral aspect (α ML) depending on the side of the implant (i.e., Left or Right). Figures 7 A, 7B, 7C and 7D are representations of random positions of the component system assembled with a tibial tray (0). Due to the combined presence of the offset (α) between the first neutral axis (20a) of the proximal portion (20) and the second neutral axis (30a) longitudinal cylindrical shaft (31) and the offset (β) between the third neutral axis (50a) of the internal cylinder (53) of the eccentric bushing (50), then the fourth neutral axis (51 a) of the external cylindrical shaft (SI) of the bushing (50) is located between two concentric circles centered on the first neutral axis (20a) of the proximal portion (20); which the largest circle has a radius equal to α+β and the smallest circle has a radius equal to α-β. Towards this end, Figure 7A and 7B represent a position where the fourth neutral axis (51a) of the external cylindrical shaft (51) of the bushing (50) adjusts a tibial offset from both an antero-posterior (α,β AP) and medio-lateral (α,βML) point of views. Figure 7C and 7D represent a singular position where the fourth neutral axis (SI a) of the external cylindrical shaft (51) of the bushing (50) is fully shifted along the medial or lateral aspect (α,β ML) depending of the side of the implant (i.e., Left or Right). Considering this singular position, the fourth neutral axis (51a) of the external cylindrical shaft (51) of the bushing (50) is located on the largest circle having a radius equal to α+β so offset (α,β ML) is equal to α+β. From this point it is understood that one advantage of the eccentric bushing over the first embodiment bushing is to adjust the antero-posterior tibial offset (α,βAP) independently of the medio-lateral offset (α,βML). A prosthesis system of the present invention includes a monoblock stem extension comprising a proximal portion having a first neutral axis; and a distal portion defined by a longitudinal cylindrical shaft having a second neutral axis, wherein the second neutral axis is parallel and offset by a distance a from the first neutral axis; and an eccentric bushing arranged coaxial around the cylindrical shaft of the monoblock stem extension, the eccentric bushing comprising an external cylindrical shaft having a third neutral axis; and an internal cylinder having a fourth neutral axis that is substantially co-linear with the second neutral axis of the monoblock stem extension, wherein the third neutral axis is parallel and offset by a distance β from the fourth neutral axis. In an embodiment, a kit includes at least two monoblock stem extensions of the present invention, wherein the first monoblock stem extension has a distance ai, and wherein the second monoblock stem extension has a distance α2, wherein ai is not equal to α2, and at least two bushings each having a fourth neutral axis parallel but offset by a distance β from the third neutral axis, available under multiple diameter options and multiple lengths. While this invention is particularly suitable for tibial prosthesis components having modular stem extensions, the features of this invention could be adapted, as appropriate, to tibial prosthesis components having an integral stem extension with offset features, or other prosthetic components which utilize modular or integral stem components. It will be appreciated that several of the above-disclosed and other features and functions, or alternatives thereof, may be desirably combined into many other different systems or applications.
