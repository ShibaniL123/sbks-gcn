This application is a Continuation In Part of pending application having Ser. No. 12/658,223, filed Feb. 2, 2010, claiming priority from Provisional Application having Ser. No. 61/207,063 filed Feb. 9 2009. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to clothing that is worn in cold environments where the clothing warms the user. More particularly, the present invention relates to clothing in which the user's breath is used to provide a heated, insulating device. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Staying warm when outdoors in cold weather is important if one desires to enjoy outdoor activities. Insulated garments have long been provided and are used to retain body heat, particularly for use in sports activities such as hunting, ice fishing, hiking, running, snow skiing, camping, cold weather emergency rescue units and the like. Some garments employ heaters such as electric or battery powered heaters, while others rely on layers of insulation to trap or retain body heat. U.S. Pat. No. 6,668,385 relates to an adjustable insulation apparatus where a plurality of cords extend or retract linings to retain body heat. U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2008/0268765 discloses a portable system for delivering self-warmed air to the body extremities through a multiplicity of air delivery hoses in an extensive network of tubes. U.S. Pat. No. 6,910,235 discloses an adjustably insulating construct body. The construct may be a vest or other article of clothing. It has two outer layers of an impervious material that form a chamber in which an additional layer that is porous and insulating is place. There is a pump designed to introduce air into the porous insulation. U.S. Pat. No. 5,976,176 discloses a body heating devise with a central conduit and mouth opening coupled to a plurality of tubes with an attachment means for attaching both to a person's body. A distribution control assembly selectively distributes air to each of the tubes using one or more air flow adjustment valves. Warm air in the form of the user's breath is delivered to selected body areas by the open ends of the tubes. None of these designs properly offer direct and long lasting comfort with a minimum of action needed to be done by the user. In every case, the presence of the user's breath includes moisture which seriously reduced the effectiveness of keeping the user warm. Accordingly, one advantage of the present invention is to provide a garment such as a vest that is simple to manufacture and involves simple, easy to obtain components. Another advantage of the present invention is to provide a garment such as a vest that is comfortable to wear, and easy to use and contains essentially no moisture from the user's breath. Yet another advantage of the present invention is to provide such a garment that maintains an even temperature for the user while allowing adjustment of the degree of warmth desired by the user in different environments. Other advantages will appear hereinafter. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It has now been discovered that the above and other advantages of the present invention may be obtained in the following manner. In its simplest form, the present invention includes a garment, such as a vest, that forms a chamber proximate some or all of the user's body, wherein the chamber holds the user's breath that has been blown into it, thus providing warmth to the man or lady using the device. The garment includes a device for removing moisture from the user's breath. The garment is made from water and vapor proof material. The garment includes a one-way inlet line including a moisture removing element so the line is connected to a chamber formed by at least a portion of the front and back of the garment. The line extends through a portion of the garment to a designated location where the warm air is distributed in the chamber. There is a second valve that the user can operate to release the contained air, such as when one goes inside or when one wants to replenish the warm air after a period of time has passed. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS For a more complete understanding of the invention, reference is hereby made to the drawings, wherein like numbers refer to like elements, and in which: FIG. 1 is a perspective view of the garment of the present invention with portions inside the garment are shown in dashed lines. FIG. 2 is a view of an inlet line. FIG. 3 is a view of one embodiment of this invention showing a preferred embodiment. FIG. 4 is a view of the embodiment illustrating the air exhaust component of the invention. FIG. 5 is a view of the location of the moisture removing device in cooperation with a check valve. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT The present invention comprises a garment used to provide warmth for a person who is in a cold environment. By the term “garment” is meant any article of clothing worn by a person, including but not limited to vests, jackets, coats and other outerwear. The garment 10 of this invention is shown as a sleeveless vest having a front 11 and back 13 that are fastened together. Other garments including those with sleeves, hoods, long tails, and other garment components or shapes are equally suitable for use in this invention. Garment 10 is double layered at least in part to form a chamber 15, shown in Fig. as the space between front 11 and back 13. In a preferred embodiment, garment 10 is formed by bonding two identical or similarly sized sheets at the periphery thereof so that the space between the two sheets forms an air tight chamber. A one-way air fill line OAL with tube BB extends from its tip that is located conveniently near the user's head to permit the user to blow air or breathe into the tip. OAL opening may be free standing or held in place with a hook and latch fastener or other fastener. Tube BB extends into chamber 15 and begins to fill chamber 15 with breath from the user. Tube BB extends to discharge point ACIL so that chamber 15 expands to create a warm air barrier between the user and the environment. Optionally, other clothing such as rain gear, snowmobile suits, hunting coats and the like may be worn over garment 10. Also located in chamber 15 is an additional section of tube BB that extends from input ACOL through valve AA to discharge point ARP when the user desires to deflate vest 10. FIGS. 1 and 2 show how the warm breath passes into chamber 15 along the length of line OAL past check valve DD that prevents air from backing up line OAL to air inlet ACIL. Check valve DD includes a moisture removal device MR as shown in FIG. 5. device MR contains a desiccant that is removable by the user if device MR is full of moisture. The warm breath spreads through chamber 15 until it reaches the exhaust system shown in FIGS. 1 and 4. When the user desires to empty chamber 15, release valve AA is opened. This allows trapped air to enter tubing BB at ACOL and pass through release valve AA, held in place by elbows FF. In one embodiment, valve AA is a common ⅜″ gas ball valve with a ⅜″ inside diameter and a fitting elbow (FF) screwed into each side using Teflon tape. Line BB is attached to both sides of the elbows FF. Both portions of discharge tube BB run inside chamber 15 basically side by side, one takes warm air from the vest to valve AA. When the ball valve is opened, the other tube BB releases the warm air inside the vest at air release point ARP. to provide warming. The ball valve assembly is mounted inside the vest (EE), with just the ball valve control (AA) outside the vest. As seen in FIG. 3, tubing BB preferably includes a plurality of holes HH that facilitate release of the warm breath in the designated regions of chamber 15 of FIG. 1. Elbow FF is used to position tubing BB where desired. FIG. 4 illustrates an additional feature of the present invention, where tubing BB extends from inside chamber 15 to release valve AA, which is operated by the user to deflate chamber 15 as desired. When valve AA is opened, air flows through it to the air release point ARP at the end of tube BB. Valve AA is located over one side of the user's chest (left side in FIG. 1), or any other place of convenience, and is conveniently reached so the user may release the air in chamber 15. ARP is located near the small of the user's back, but can be placed in any location. Tubing BB may be made from any flexible tubing. In one embodiment, a 3′8 inch clear vinyl tubing was used. Garment 10 may be made from any air and vapor impermeable material such as vinyl coated fabric. One preferred material is neoprene or polychloroprene, which is a synthetic rubber material that has good chemical stability and flexibility over a wide temperature range, such as that encountered in outdoor activities. This invention is admirably suited for most outdoor activities and has a particular advantage when used while hunting. Because the inlet to tube BB is close to the user's mouth, he or she can access tube BB and inflate chamber 15 without much movement. Similarly, valve AA is easily reached without significant movement. Thus one at a deer stand, for example, can use the garment without movement that would be noticed by an approaching deer or other animal. When worn under a hunting jacket, no movement would be detected.
