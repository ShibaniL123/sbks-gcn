FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a nanocomposite comprising nanoparticles. The present invention also relates to the use of said nanocomposite as a masterbatch in a process for the preparation of a second nanocomposite. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Nanoparticles offer interesting and frequently unexpected properties because their properties are rather the result of the surface of the particles than of the bulk volume. For example, nanoparticles can show surprising mechanical, optical and electrical properties, even at low concentrations. The properties of nanoparticles have attracted interest in polymer science, particularly for polymer reinforcement. Particular attention has been focused on carbon nanotubes (CNTs). An important factor in polymer reinforcement is the nanoparticles' distribution in the polymer. It is believed that the nanoparticles, and in particular carbon nanotubes, should ideally be uniformly distributed in the polymer and each nanoparticle individually coated with the polymer so that an efficient load transfer to the nanoparticles can be achieved. Lack of homogeneity, i.e. uneven distribution of the nanoparticles, may create weak spots and an uneven distribution of stress, in consequence leading at best to only marginal increases in mechanical properties. Due to difficulties in dispersion, the hopes of drastically improving the polymer's mechanical properties by the incorporation of nanoparticles have not yet been fulfilled. Hence, the need to improve the distribution of nanoparticles in polymers remains. Several processes are presented in the literature to obtain a good dispersion of CNTs in polymers, and polyolefins in particular, such as in-situ polymerization and use of a compatibilizer. In-situ polymerization: in this approach, the CNTs are used as catalyst support, replacing more classical supports like silica or alumina phosphate. After impregnation or deposit of the catalyst on the CNT-support, the supported catalyst can then be introduced in a polymerization reactor. At the end of the polymerization, catalyst residues (containing the CNTs) can be well dispersed in the polymer matrix. A main drawback of this approach is the need to introduce the CNT-supported catalyst in an industrial polymerization reactor. Indeed, at the end of the CNT-polyolefin production, a complete cleaning of the reactor may be required. Such cleaning can be severe for safety reasons (due to the uncertainties on the CNT toxicity, there should be no contamination of the CNTs in the next polyolefin production) and for product quality reasons (any remaining traces of CNT in the reactor could induce a significant color change of the polymer prepared in the next run). Use of a compatibilizer: numerous products are known to be interesting compatibilizers for CNT—polymer blends. Unfortunately, effective compatibilizers can correspond to quite expensive products. The final cost of the CNT/compatibilizer/polymer can be significantly increased due to the presence of such a compatibilizer. There remains a need to provide nanocomposites with improved dispersion of the nanoparticles. There also remains a need to provide processes to obtain nanocomposites with improved dispersion of the nanoparticles. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a nanocomposite with an improved and/or more stable dispersion of nanoparticles. It is also an object of the present invention to provide a process for preparing a second nanocomposite with an improved and/or more stable dispersion of nanoparticles. The inventors have now discovered that these objects can be met either individually or in any combination by the present nanocomposite and their use as a masterbatch. The inventors have surprisingly found that by selecting the appropriate polyolefin, good nanoparticle dispersion can be easily achieved using standard extrusion processes. Furthermore, the inventors have surprisingly found that by mixing a masterbatch of the nanocomposite according to the invention (based on an appropriate polyolefin) with a polyolefin with other properties than the polyolefin used for the masterbatch, good nanoparticle dispersion can still be easily achieved using standard extrusion processes.

The nanoparticles used in the present invention can generally be characterized by having a size from 1 to and 500 nm. In the case of, for example, nanotubes, this definition of size can be limited to two dimensions only, i.e. the third dimension may be outside of these limits. Preferably, the nanoparticles are selected from the group comprising: carbon nanoparticles, silicon nanoparticles, and SiC nanoparticles. In an embodiment, the nanoparticles are selected from the group comprising nanotubes, nanofibers, carbon black, nanographene, nanographite, and blends thereof. In an embodiment, the nanoparticles are selected from the group comprising carbon-, silicon- or SiC-nanotubes, -nanofibers, -nanographene, -nanographite, carbon black, and blends thereof. Preferably, the nanoparticles are selected from the group comprising nanotubes, nanofibers, carbon black, and blends of these. More preferred are nanotubes, nanofibers, and blends of these. Most preferred are nanotubes. Suitable nanotubes to be used in the invention can be cylindrical in shape and structurally related to fullerenes, an example of which is Buckminster fullerene (C60). Suitable nanotubes may be open or capped at their ends. The end cap may for example be a Buckminster-type fullerene hemisphere. The nanotubes made in the present invention may be made from elements of group 14 of the periodic table of the elements, such as carbon (carbon nanotubes or CNTs) or silicon (silicon nanotubes), or mixtures thereof, such as SiC nanotubes, or from a combination of elements of groups 13 and 15 of the periodic table of the elements (see International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) Periodic Table of the Elements), such as for example a combination of boron or aluminum with nitrogen or phosphorus. Suitable nanotubes may also be made from silicon and a combination of elements of groups 13, 14 and 15 of the periodic table of the elements. Alternatively, suitable nanotubes may also be made from carbon and a combination of elements of groups 13, 14 and 15 of the periodic table of the elements.

In a preferred embodiment, the nanoparticles are selected from carbon nanotubes, silicon nanotubes, or SiC nanotubes. Preferably the nanotubes used in the present invention are made from carbon, i.e. they comprise more than 90%, more preferably more than 95%, even more preferably more than 99% and most preferably more than 99.9% of their total weight in carbon; such nanotubes are generally referred to as “carbon nanotubes” (CNT). According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the nanoparticles are carbon nanotubes. However, minor amounts of other atoms may also be present. Suitable carbon nanotubes to be used in the present invention can be prepared by any method known in the art. They can be prepared by the catalyst decomposition of hydrocarbons, a technique that is called Catalytic Carbon Vapor Deposition (CCVD). Other methods for preparing carbon nanotubes include the arc-discharge method, the plasma decomposition of hydrocarbons or the pyrolysis of selected polyolefin under selected oxidative conditions. The starting hydrocarbons can be acetylene, ethylene, butane, propane, ethane, methane or any other gaseous or volatile carbon-containing compound. The catalyst, if present, is used in either pure or in supported form. The presence of a support greatly improves the selectivity of the catalysts but it contaminates the carbon nanotubes with support particles, in addition to the soot and amorphous carbon prepared during pyrolysis. Purification can remove these by-products and impurities. This can be carried out according to the following two steps: 1) the dissolution of the support particles, typically carried out with an appropriate agent that depends upon the nature of the support and 2) the removal of the pyrolytic carbon component, typically based on either oxidation or reduction processes. Nanotubes can exist as single-walled nanotubes (SWNT) and multi-walled nanotubes (MWNT), i.e. nanotubes having one single wall and nanotubes having more than one wall, respectively. In single-walled nanotubes a one atom thick sheet of atoms, for example a one atom thick sheet of graphite (also called graphene), is rolled seamlessly to form a cylinder. Multi-walled nanotubes consist of a number of such cylinders arranged concentrically. The arrangement in a multi-walled nanotube can be described by the so-called Russian doll model, wherein a larger doll opens to reveal a smaller doll. In an embodiment, the nanoparticles are multi-walled carbon nanotubes, more preferably multi-walled carbon nanotubes having on average from 5 to 15 walls. Nanotubes, irrespectively of whether they are single-walled or multi-walled, may be characterized by their outer diameter or by their length or by both. Single-walled nanotubes are preferably characterized by an outer diameter of at least 0.5 nm, more preferably of at least 1 nm, and most preferably of at least 2 nm. Preferably their outer diameter is at most 50 nm, more preferably at most 30 nm and most preferably at most 10 nm. Preferably, the length of single-walled nanotubes is at least 0.1 μm, more preferably at least 1 μm, even more preferably at least 10 μm.

The preferred outer diameter is at most 100 nm, more preferably at most 80 nm, 60 nm or 40 nm, and most preferably at most 20 nm. Most preferably, the outer diameter is in the range from 10 nm to 20 nm.

The most preferred length is in the range from 100 nm to 10 μm. In an embodiment, the multi-walled carbon nanotubes have an average outer diameter in the range from 10 nm to 20 nm or an average length in the range from 100 nm to 10 μm or both. Non-limiting examples of commercially available multi-walled carbon nanotubes are Graphistrength™ 100, available from Arkema, and Nanocyl™ NC 7000, available from Nanocyl. In an embodiment, the nanoparticles are nanofibers. Suitable nanofibers for use in the present invention preferably have a diameter of at least 1 nm, more preferably of at least 2 nm and most preferably of at least 5 nm. Preferably, their diameter is at most 500 nm, more preferably at most 300 nm, and most preferably at most 100 nm. Their length may vary from 10 μm to several centimeters. Preferably, the nanofibers used in the present invention are carbon nanofibers, i.e. they comprise at least 50% by weight of carbon, relative to the total weight of the nanofiber. Preferably, suitable nanofibers used in the present invention comprise polyolefins, polyamides, polystyrenes, or polyesters as well as polyurethanes, polycarbonates, polyacrylonitrile, polyvinyl alcohol, polymethacrylate, polyethylene oxide, polyvinylchloride, or any blend thereof. Suitable nanofibers for the present invention can be prepared by any suitable method, such as for example by drawing of a melt-spun or solution-spun fiber, by template synthesis, phase separation, self-assembly, electrospinning of a polyolefin solution or electrospinning of a polyolefin melt. In an embodiment, the nanoparticles are carbon black particles. Carbon black is made of microcrystalline, finely dispersed carbon particles, which are obtained through incomplete combustion or thermal decomposition of liquid or gaseous hydrocarbons. Carbon black particles are characterized by a diameter in the range of from 5 nm to 500 nm, though they have a great tendency to form agglomerates. Carbon black comprises from 96% to 99% by weight of carbon, relative to its total weight, with the remainder being hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur or any combination of these. The surface properties of carbon black can be dominated by oxygen-comprising functional groups, such as hydroxyl, carboxyl or carbonyl groups, located on its surface. In an embodiment, the nanoparticles are nanographene. Graphene in general, and including nanographene, may be a single sheet or a stack of several sheets having both micro- and nano-scale dimensions, such as in some embodiments an average particle size of 1 to 20 μm, specifically 1 to 15 μm, and an average thickness (smallest) dimension in nano-scale dimensions of less than or equal to 50 nm, specifically less than or equal to 25 nm, and more specifically less than or equal to 10 nm. An exemplary nanographene may have an average particle size of 1 to 5 μm, and specifically 2 to 4 μm. Graphene, including nanographene, may be prepared by exfoliation of nanographite or by a synthetic procedure by “unzipping” a nanotube to form a nanographene ribbon. Exfoliation to form graphene or nanographene may be carried out by exfoliation of a graphite source such as graphite, intercalated graphite, and nanographite. Exemplary exfoliation methods include, but are not limited to, those practiced in the art such as fluorination, acid intercalation, acid intercalation followed by thermal shock treatment, and the like, or a combination comprising at least one of the foregoing. Exfoliation of the nanographite provides a nanographene having fewer layers than non-exfoliated nanographite. It will be appreciated that exfoliation of nanographite may provide the nanographene as a single sheet only one molecule thick, or as a layered stack of relatively few sheets. In an embodiment, exfoliated nanographene has fewer than 50 single sheet layers, specifically fewer than 20 single sheet layers, specifically fewer than 10 single sheet layers, and more specifically fewer than 5 single sheet layers. In an embodiment, the nanographene has an aspect ratio in the range of greater than or equal to about 100:1, for example, greater than equal to about 1000:1. In an embodiment, the nanographene has a surface area greater than or equal to about 40 m2/gram nitrogen surface adsorption area. For example, the surface area is greater than or equal to about 100 m2/gram nitrogen surface adsorption area. In an embodiment, the nanographene is expanded. In an embodiment, the nanoparticles are nanographite. The nanographite can be multilayered by furnace high temperature expansion from acid-treated natural graphite or microwave heating expansion from moisture saturated natural graphite. In an embodiment, the nanographite is a multi-layered nanographite which has at least one dimension with a thickness less than 100 nm. In some exemplary embodiments, the graphite may be mechanically treated such as by air jet milling to pulverize the nanographite particles. The pulverization of the particles ensures that the nanographite flake and other dimensions of the particles are less than 20 microns, most likely less than 5 microns. The nanoparticles can form nanoparticle aggregates in the nanocomposite. Preferably, the size of each nanoparticle aggregate in the nanocomposite is at most 125 μm, preferably at most 100 μm, preferably at most 75 μm, preferably at most 50 μm. In an embodiment, the size of each nanoparticle aggregate in the nanocomposite is at most 40 μm, preferably at most 30 μm, preferably at most 20 μm, preferably at most 10 μm. The size of nanoparticles aggregates can be measured by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) or by optical microscopy, which allows visualization of isolated nanoparticles. Preferably, the composite material is cut in microtome sections, typically with a section width of from 0.05 to 100 μm, preferably from 50 to 100 μm, and investigated with a microtome. This allows evaluating the larger aggregates of CNT and gives an indication of their size. In a preferred embodiment, the degree of dispersion of the nanoparticles in the polyolefin composition can be assessed by a method based on ISO 18553:2002. As part of said method based on ISO 18553:2002, the size of nanoparticle aggregates dispersed in the polyolefin composition can be determined. The degree of dispersion of the nanoparticles in the polyolefin composition can be assessed using the (molar) absorptivity of the nanocomposite. As used herein, the terms “molar absorption coefficient”, “molar extinction coefficient”, “molar absorptivity” and “absorptivity” are used interchangeably and refer to the measurement of how strongly a chemical species absorbs light at a given wavelength. Different disciplines have different conventions as to whether absorbance is Napierian or decadic, i.e., defined with respect to the transmission via natural or common logarithm. As used herein, the molar absorptivity is decadic. The qualitative identification of a nanocomposite can be achieved by comparing the absorption spectrum of the nanocomposite with the spectra of known substances. A known substance can be determined by measuring the absorbance at one or more wavelengths and using the Beer-Lambert law and the molar absorptivity to calculate its amount concentration. Concentrations can also be determined from an analytical function or an analytical calibration curve. According to an embodiment of the invention, the absorptivity ε of the nanocomposite at a wavelength λ of 800 nm is at least 250 per cm thickness of the sample and per % by weight of nanoparticles, wherein % by weight is calculated relative to the total weight of the nanocomposite, wherein the absorptivity is calculated using the Lambert-Beer equation A=lCε, wherein A is the absorbance, l is the thickness of the sample in cm and C is the concentration of nanoparticles in % by weight, relative to the total weight of the nanocomposite. According to an embodiment of the invention, the difference in molar absorptivity Δε of the nanocomposite at a wavelength λ of 800 nm compared to the nanocomposite without nanoparticles is at least 75 per cm thickness of the sample and per % by weight of nanoparticles, wherein % by weight is calculated relative to the total weight of the nanocomposite, wherein the absorptivity is calculated using the Lambert-Beer equation A=lCε, wherein A is the absorbance, l is the thickness of the sample in cm and C is the concentration of nanoparticles in % by weight, relative to the total weight of the nanocomposite. The method to measure the absorptivity of a nanocomposite can be performed as described herein below. A slice of the nanocomposite is cut up in a thin section, preferably with a thickness from 40 μm to 100 μm. The thin section is melted between two microscopic slides and then pressed under compression. The temperature is above the melting point of the nanocomposite, preferably between 200 and 250° C., preferably 220° C. The sample can be compressed manually. The thickness of the slice is measured. The slice is then put inside a spectrophotometer and a light beam with wavelength of 800 nm is sent on the sample. The absorbance is recorded and the (molar) absorptivity is calculated following the Lambert-Beer equation. In an embodiment of the invention, the nanocomposite comprises one or more additives selected from the group comprising an antioxidant, an antiacid, a UV-absorber, an antistatic agent, a light stabilizing agent, an acid scavenger, a lubricant, a nucleating/clarifying agent, a colorant or a peroxide, and combinations thereof. The invention also encompasses the nanocomposite as described herein wherein the nanocomposite comprises from 0% to 10% by weight of at least one additive, based on the total weight of the nanocomposite. In a preferred embodiment, said nanocomposite comprises less than 5% by weight of additive, based on the total weight of the nanocomposite, for example from 0.1 to 3% by weight of additive, based on the total weight of the nanocomposite. In a preferred embodiment, the nanocomposite comprises an antioxidant.

Suitable antioxidants also include, for example, phenolic antioxidants with dual functionality such 4,4′-Thio-bis(6-tert-butyl-m-methyl phenol) (Antioxidant 300), 2,2′-Sulfanediylbis(6-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol) (Antioxidant 2246-S),2-Methyl-4,6-bis(octylsulfanylmethyl)phenol, thiodiethylene bis[3-(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)propionate], 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-(4,6-bis(octylthio)-1,3,5-triazin-2-ylamino)phenol, N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)stearamide, bis(1,2,2,6,6-pentamethyl-4-piperidyl) [[3,5-bis(1,1-dimethylethyl)-4-hydroxyphenyl]methyl]butylmalonate, 2,4-di-tert-butylphenyl 3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxybenzoate, hexadecyl 3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxy-benzoate, 2-(1,1-dimethylethyl)-6-[[3-(1,1-dimethylethyl)-2-hydroxy-5-methylphenyl]methyl]-4-methylphenyl acrylate, and Cas nr. 128961-68-2 (Sumilizer GS). Suitable antioxidants also include, for example, aminic antioxidants such as N-phenyl-2-naphthylamine, poly(1,2-dihydro-2,2,4-trimethyl-quinoline), N-isopropyl-N′-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine, N-Phenyl-1-naphthylamine, CAS nr. 68411-46-1 (Antioxidant 5057), and 4,4-bis(alpha,alpha-dimethylbenzyl)diphenylamine (Antioxidant KY 405). In a preferred embodiment, the antioxidant is selected from pentaerythritol tetrakis[3-(3′,5′-di-tert-butyl-4′-hydroxyphenyl)propionate] (herein referred to as Irganox 1010), tris(2,4-ditert-butylphenyl)phosphite (herein referred to as Irgafos 168), or a mixture thereof. The present invention also encompasses a process for preparing a nanocomposite masterbatch according to the first aspect to the invention, comprising melt blending a polyolefin composition with at least 5% by weight of nanoparticles, relative to the total weight of the nanocomposite, to form a nanocomposite. In a preferred embodiment, the nanoparticles are selected from carbon nanoparticles, silicon nanoparticles, or SiC nanoparticles. In an embodiment, the melt blending is performed in the absence of a solvent. The process of the present invention is particularly advantageous as it is simple and does not require additional compounds, such as for example compatibilizers. Hence, the process for preparing the nanocomposite of the present invention is preferably characterized by the absence of a compatibilizer. In other words, the preferred process for preparing the nanocomposite of the present invention is characterized by making no use of compatibilizers to homogeneously distribute the nanoparticles in the polyolefin composition. Contrary to all expectations it has been found that the use of compatibilizers is not necessary to achieve a homogeneous dispersion of nanoparticles in a polyolefin composition as defined above. Surprisingly, the present process for preparing a nanocomposite of the present invention has given very good results for non-polar polymers such as polyolefins. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the polyolefin composition for use in the process described above is in the form of a fluff, powder, or pellet, preferably in the form of a fluff. As used herein, the term “fluff” refers to the polyolefin material that is prepared in a loop reactor with the hard catalyst particle at the core of each grain of the powder. As used herein the term “resin” encompasses both the fluff prepared in the loop reactor as well as the subsequently melted and/or pelleted polyolefin. As used herein, the terms “polyolefin product” or “polyolefin pellet” are defined as polyolefin material that is prepared through compounding and homogenizing of the resin, for instance with mixing and/or extruder equipment. Preferably, the polyolefin particles have an average diameter (D50) of at most 2 mm, more preferably at most 1 mm, more preferably at most 100 μm. The D50 is defined as the particle size for which fifty percent by volume of the particles has a size lower than the D50. The average size of the particles is preferably assessed by particle sieving. Alternatively, the size may be measured by using optical measurements, preferably with a Camsizer. As used herein, the term “polyolefin powder” refers to ground polyolefin fluff or ground polyolefin pellets. Preferably, the nanocomposites are processed at a temperature above the melt temperature, i.e. they are melt-processed. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the process of the present invention comprises the step of processing the nanocomposite at a temperature above the melt temperature of said nanocomposite; wherein this step preferably comprises extruding a mixture of the polyolefin composition and the nanoparticles in an extruder. The melt temperature of the nanocomposite can for example be determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The DSC can be performed with a Perkin-Elmer Pyris 1 equipment. In a typical DSC experiment, the sample is first heated up to 200° C. at a 20° C./min rate in order to fully melt the nanocomposite and remove its thermomechanical history. The sample is held at 200° C. during 3 min. Then the sample is cooled down to −40° C. at a 20° C./min rate and heated up again at 200° C. at 20° C./min. The melt temperature is measured during the second heating step and corresponds to the maximum of the melting peak. The standard used to calibrate the heating and cooling rate is Indium. It is noted that generally the melt temperature of the nanocomposite will be substantially the same as that of the polyolefin composition. Said melt-processing step can for example be a pelletization, i.e. the production of pellets by melt-extruding, the nanocomposite, or can be a process selected from the group comprising fiber extrusion, film extrusion, sheet extrusion, pipe extrusion, blow molding, rotomolding, slush molding, injection molding, injection-stretch blow molding and extrusion-thermoforming. Most preferably, the melt-processing step is a process selected from the group comprising pelletization, fiber extrusion, film extrusion, sheet extrusion and rotomolding. The present invention preferably relates to extrusion. As used herein, the terms “extrusion” or “extrusion process”, “pelletization” or “pelletizing” are used herein as synonyms and refer to the process of transforming polyolefin resin into a “polyolefin product” or into “pellets” after pelletizing. The process preferably comprises several equipments connected in series, including one or more rotating screws in an extruder, a die, and means for cutting the extruded filaments into pellets. Preferably, polyolefin resin is fed to the extruding apparatus through a valve, preferably a feeding screw or a rotary valve, and conveyed—while passing a flow meter—to the at least one feeding zone of the extrusion apparatus. Preferably, nitrogen is provided in the feeding zone to prevent air from entering the extrusion apparatus, to thereby limit polyolefin degradation. After being fed into the extruder, the polyolefin resin is preferably transported along with the rotating screw of the extruder. High shear forces are present in the extruder and product temperature increases. The polyolefin product, optionally in the presence of additives, melts and is homogenized and mixed. The extruder can have one or more heating means e.g. a jacket to heat the extruder barrels or a hot oil unit. The screw in the extruder can be the vehicle upon which the polyolefin product travels. The shape of the screw can determine along with the speed at which the screw turns, expressed in rpm, the speed at which the product moves and the pressure attained in the extruder. The screw in the screw mixer can be powered by a motor, preferably an electric motor. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the extruder has a screw speed from 10 to 2000 rpm, for example from 100 to 1000 rpm, for example from 150 to 300 rpm. The melted and homogenized polyolefin product may further be pumped and pressurized by a pump at the end of the extruder, preferably powered by an electrical motor. Preferably, the melted polyolefin product is further filtered by means of a filter to remove impurities and to reduce the amount of gels. Preferably, the product is then pushed through a die, preferably a die plate, provided in a pelletizer. In an embodiment, the polyolefin comes out of the die plate as a large number of noodles which are then delivered into pellet cooling water and cut underwater in the pelletizer by rotating knives. The particles can be cooled down with the water and form the pellets which are transported to further processing sections, e.g. to a packaging section. Preferably, the nanocomposites are processed at a temperature below the decomposition temperature of the nanocomposite. As used herein, the decomposition temperature of the nanocomposite is equal to the decomposition temperature as the polyolefin composition. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the temperature is from 150° C. to 300° C., preferably from 200° C. to 250° C. The present invention also encompasses the use of a nanocomposite according to the first aspect of the invention as a masterbatch, preferably wherein the nanocomposite is blended with a polyolefin to prepare a polyolefin resin. In particular, the invention provides a process for preparing a polyolefin resin comprising a polyolefin and a nanocomposite comprising the step of blending a nanocomposite according to the first aspect of the invention with a polyolefin. In an embodiment, the blending is performed in the absence of a solvent. The polyolefin to be used in the resin can be as described above for the polyolefin of the polyolefin composition. Features that were preferred for the polyolefin in the polyolefin composition are also preferred for the polyolefin in the polyolefin resin. In an embodiment, the polyolefin for use in the resin has the same properties as the polyolefin composition for use in the nanocomposite. In a preferred embodiment, the polyolefin for use in the resin has different properties than the polyolefin composition of the nanocomposite. In an embodiment, the polyolefin for use in the resin has poor carbon nanotube dispersion properties compared to the polyolefin for use in the polyolefin composition of the nanocomposite. In a preferred embodiment, the polyolefin for use in the resin is a polyolefin prepared in the presence of a catalyst selected from a Ziegler-Natta catalyst, a metallocene catalyst, or a chromium catalyst. The term “chromium catalysts” refers to catalysts obtained by deposition of chromium oxide on a support, e.g. a silica or aluminum support. Illustrative examples of chromium catalysts comprise but are not limited to CrSiO2 or CrAl2O3. The polyolefin for use in the resin may be viscous or fluid at a temperature of 190° C. The viscosity η of the polyolefin can be measured by Rheologic Dynamic Analysis at a frequency of 1 rad/s and a temperature of 190° C., as described herein above. Preferably, the viscosity is at least 10 000 Pa·s, preferably at least 20 000 Pa·s, preferably at least 40 000 Pa·s.

From these polyolefin resin samples microtome slices having an average thickness of 130 nm were cut under cryogenic conditions. An area of ca. 1 mm by 1 mm was then checked optically for the presence of any agglomerated nanoparticles. Distribution of nanoparticles in the polyolefin resin was determined based on standard ISO 18553:2002. A slice of the polyolefin resin was cut up after extrusion using a razor blade. The thin section was melted between two microscopic slides and then pressed under compression. The thickness of the slice was comprised between 40 μm and 100 μm, preferably 60 μm.
