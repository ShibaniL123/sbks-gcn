The term halo is generic to fluoro, chloro, bromo and iodo. As used in the foregoing and hereinafter, polyhalomethyl as a group or part of a group is defined as mono- or polyhalosubstituted methyl, in particular methyl with one or more fluoro atoms, for example, difluoromethyl or trifluoromethyl; polyhaloC1-6alkyl as a group or part of a group is defined as mono- or polyhalosubstituted C1-6alkyl, for example, the groups defined in halomethyl, 1,1-difluoro-ethyl and the like.

Het or Het1 are meant to include all the possible isomeric forms of the heterocycles mentioned in the definitions of Het or Het1, for instance, pyrrolyl also includes 2H-pyrrolyl. The Het or Het1 radical may be attached to the remainder of the molecule of formula (I) through any ring carbon or heteroatom as appropriate. Thus, for example, when the heterocycle is pyridyl, it may be 2-pyridyl, 3-pyridyl or 4-pyridyl. When any variable (eg. aryl, R2 etc.) occurs more than one time in any constituent, each definition is independent. Lines drawn into ring systems from substituents indicate that the bond may be attached to any of the suitable ring atoms. For therapeutic use, salts of the compounds of formula (I) are those wherein the counterion is pharmaceutically acceptable. However, salts of acids and bases which are non-pharmaceutically acceptable may also find use, for example, in the preparation or purification of a pharmaceutically acceptable compound. All salts, whether pharmaceutically acceptable or not are included within the ambit of the present invention. The pharmaceutically acceptable addition salts as mentioned hereinabove are meant to comprise the therapeutically active non-toxic acid addition salt forms which the compounds of formula (I) are able to form. The latter can conveniently be obtained by treating the base form with such appropriate acids as inorganic acids, for example, hydrohalic acids, e.g. hydrochloric, hydrobromic and the like; sulfuric acid; nitric acid; phosphoric acid and the like; or organic acids, for example, acetic, propanoic, hydroxyacetic, 2-hydroxypropanoic, 2-oxopropanoic, oxalic, malonic, succinic, maleic, fumaric, malic, tartaric, 2-hydroxy-1,2,3-propanetricarboxylic, methanesulfonic, ethanesulfonic, benzenesulfonic, 4-methylbenzenesulfonic, cyclohexanesulfamic, 2-hydroxybenzoic, 4-amino-2-hydroxybenzoic and the like acids. Conversely the salt form can be converted by treatment with alkali into the free base form. The compounds of formula (I) containing acidic protons may be converted into their therapeutically active non-toxic metal or amine addition salt forms by treatment with appropriate organic and inorganic bases. Appropriate base salt forms comprise, for example, the ammonium salts, the alkali and earth alkaline metal salts, e.g. the lithium, sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium salts and the like, salts with organic bases, e.g. primary, secondary and tertiary aliphatic and aromatic amines such as methylamine, ethylamine, propylamine, isopropylamine, the four butylamine isomers, dimethylamine, diethylamine, diethanolamine, dipropylamine, diisopropylamine, din-butylamine, pyrrolidine, piperidine, morpholine, trimethylamine, triethylamine, tripropylamine, quinuclidine, pyridine, quinoline and isoquinoline, the benzathine, N-methyl-D-glucamine, 2-amino-2-(hydroxymethyl)-1,3-propanediol, hydrabamine salts, and salts with amino acids such as, for example, arginine, lysine and the like. Conversely the salt form can be converted by treatment with acid into the free acid form. The term addition salt also comprises the hydrates and solvent addition forms which the compounds of formula (I) are able to form. Examples of such forms are e.g. hydrates, alcoholates and the like. The term "quaternary amine" as used hereinbefore defines the quaternary ammonium salts which the compounds of formula (I) are able to form by reaction between a basic nitrogen of a compound of formula (I) and an appropriate quaternizing agent, such as, for example, an optionally substituted alkylhalide, arylhalide or arylalkylhalide, e.g. methyliodide or benzyliodide. Other reactants with good leaving groups may also be used, such as alkyl trifluoromethanesulfonates, alkyl methanesulfonates, and alkyl p-toluenesulfonates. A quaternary amine has a positively charged nitrogen. Pharmaceutically acceptable counterions include chloro, bromo, iodo, trifluoroacetate and acetate. The counterion of choice can be introduced using ion exchange resins. It will be appreciated that some of the compounds of formula (I) and their N-oxides, addition salts, quaternary amines and stereochemically isomeric forms may contain one or more centers of chirality and exist as stereochemically isomeric forms. The term "stereochemically isomeric forms" as used hereinbefore defines all the possible stereoisomeric forms which the compounds of formula (I), and their N-oxides, addition salts, quaternary amines or physiologically functional derivatives may possess. Unless otherwise mentioned or indicated, the chemical designation of compounds denotes the mixture of all possible stereochemically isomeric forms, said mixtures containing all diastereomers and enantiomers of the basic molecular structure as well as each of the individual isomeric forms of formula (I) and their N-oxides, salts, solvates or quaternary amines substantially free, i.e. associated with less than 10%, preferably less than 5%, in particular less than 2% and most preferably less than 1% of the other isomers. In particular, stereogenic centers may have the R- or S-configuration; substituents on bivalent cyclic (partially) saturated radicals may have either the cis- or trans-configuration. Compounds encompassing double bonds can have an E or Z-stereochemistry at said double bond. Stereochemically isomeric forms of the compounds of formula (I) are obviously intended to be embraced within the scope of this invention. The N-oxide forms of the present compounds are meant to comprise the compounds of formula (I) wherein one or several nitrogen atoms are oxidized to the so-called N-oxide. Some of the compounds of formula (I) may also exist in their tautomeric form. Such forms although not explicitly indicated in the above formula are intended to be included within the scope of the present invention. Whenever used hereinafter, the term "compounds of formula (I)" is meant to also include their N-oxide forms, their salts, their quaternary amines and their stereochemically isomeric forms.

In general, compounds of formula (I) can be prepared by reacting an HIV replication inhibiting intermediate of formula (A1)(A2)N-H with an intermediate of formula (III), wherein W1 represents a suitable leaving group, such as a halogen, e.g. chloro, bromo and the like, in the presence of a suitable base, such as for example sodium hydride, butyl lithium, sodium hydroxide or N-(1-methylethyl)-2-propanamine, and a suitable reaction-inert solvent, such as for example tetrahydrofuran. In this and the following preparations, the reaction products may be isolated from the reaction medium and, if necessary, further purified according to methodologies generally known in the art such as, for example, extraction, crystallization, distillation, trituration and chromatography. Compounds of formula (I), wherein R1 is C1-6alkyloxycarbonylC1-6alkylcarbonyl, aryl1C1-6alkyloxycarbonylC1-6alkylcarbonyl, Het 1C1-6alkyloxycarbonylC1-6alkylcarbonyl or R9R10N-C1-6alkyloxycarbonylC1-6alkylcarbonyl, said R1 being represented by R1a-O-C(=O)-C1-6alkyl-C(=O), and said compounds by formula (I-a), can be prepared by reacting an HIV replication inhibiting intermediate of formula (A1)(A2)N-H with an intermediate of formula (IV), wherein W2 represents a suitable leaving group, such as a halogen, e.g. chloro, bromo and the like, and an intermediate of formula (V) in the presence of a suitable base, such as sodium hydride, and a suitable reaction-inert solvent, such as N,N-dimethylformamide. The compounds of formula (I) may further be prepared by converting compounds of formula (I) into each other according to art-known group transformation reactions. The compounds of formula (I) may be converted to the corresponding N-oxide forms following art-known procedures for converting a trivalent nitrogen into its N-oxide form. Said N-oxidation reaction may generally be carried out by reacting the starting material of formula (I) with an appropriate organic or inorganic peroxide. Appropriate inorganic peroxides comprise, for example, hydrogen peroxide, alkali metal or earth alkaline metal peroxides, e.g. sodium peroxide, potassium peroxide; appropriate organic peroxides may comprise peroxy acids such as, for example, benzenecarboperoxoic acid or halo substituted benzenecarboperoxoic acid, e.g. 3-chlorobenzenecarbo-peroxoic acid, peroxoalkanoic acids, e.g. peroxoacetic acid, alkylhydroperoxides, e.g. t.butyl hydro-peroxide.

Some of the compounds of formula (I) and some of the intermediates in the present invention may contain an asymmetric carbon atom. Pure stereochemically isomeric forms of said compounds and said intermediates can be obtained by the application of art-known procedures. For example, diastereoisomers can be separated by physical methods such as selective crystallization or chromatographic techniques, e.g. counter current distribution, liquid chromatography and the like methods. Enantiomers can be obtained from racemic mixtures by first converting said racemic mixtures with suitable resolving agents such as, for example, chiral acids, to mixtures of diastereomeric salts or compounds; then physically separating said mixtures of diastereomeric salts or compounds by, for example, selective crystallization or chromatographic techniques, e.g. liquid chromatography and the like methods; and finally converting said separated diastereomeric salts or compounds into the corresponding enantiomers. Pure stereochemically isomeric forms may also be obtained from the pure stereochemically isomeric forms of the appropriate intermediates and starting materials, provided that the intervening reactions occur stereospecifically. An alternative manner of separating the enantiomeric forms of the compounds of formula (I) and intermediates involves liquid chromatography, in particular liquid chromatography using a chiral stationary phase. Some of the intermediates and starting materials are known compounds and may be commercially available or may be prepared according to art-known procedures or may be prepared according to the procedures described in WO99/50250 and WO 00/27825.

This reaction can be performed at a temperature ranging between 50°C and 250°C. The HIV replication inhibiting pyrimidine intermediates of formula (II), wherein L is a radical of formula -NR7R3, said intermediates being represented by formula (II-a), can be prepared by reacting an intermediate of formula (VIII) wherein W4 is a suitable leaving group such as, for example, a halogen or a triflate, with an intermediate of formula (IX) under solvent-free conditions or in an appropriate solvent such as, for example, ethanol, 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone, N,N-dimethylformamide, 1,4-dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, dimethyl sulfoxide, tetraline, sulfolane, acetonitrile and the like, under a reaction-inert atmosphere such as, for example, oxygen free argon or nitrogen, and optionally in the presence of an acid such as, for example, 1 N hydrochloric acid in diethyl ether. This reaction can be performed at a temperature ranging between 50°C and 250°C. The HIV replication inhibiting pyrimidine intermediates of formula (II), wherein L is a radical of formula -O-R3, said intermediates being represented by formula (II-b), can be prepared by reacting an intermediate of formula (VIII) wherein W4 is a suitable leaving group such as, for example a halogen or a triflate, with an intermediate of formula (X) in an appropriate solvent such as, for example, 1,4-dioxane, dimethyl sulfoxide, tetraline, sulfolane and the like under a reaction-inert atmosphere such as, for example, oxygen free argon or nitrogen, and in the presence of a base such as, for example, sodium hydride, potassium hydride, sodium hydroxide or the like. This reaction can be performed at a temperature ranging between 50°C and 250°C. The HIV replication inhibiting pyrimidine intermediates of formula (II) may further be prepared by converting intermediates of formula (II) into each other according to art-known group transformation reactions. The HIV replication inhibiting pyrimidine intermediates of formula (II) may be converted to the corresponding N-oxide forms following art-known procedures as described hereinabove for the preparation of the N-oxide forms of the compounds of formula (I). For instance, the HIV replication inhibiting pyrimidine intermediates of formula (II) wherein Q is a halogen may be converted to the corresponding intermediates wherein Q is -NR4H using NH2R4 as a reagent in a reaction inert solvent such as, for example, 1,4-dioxane and the like, optionally in the presence of a suitable base such as, for example, N,N-diethylethanamine or N,N-diisopropylethylamine or the like. In case R4 contains a hydroxy moiety, it may be convenient to perform the above reaction with a protected form of NH2R4 whereby the hydroxy moiety bears a suitable protecting group P being, for instance, a trialkylsilyl group, and subsequently removing the protective group according to art-known methodologies. Intermediates of formula (VI) wherein L is -X-R3, said intermediates being represented by formula (VI-1) can be prepared by reacting a pyrimidine derivative of formula (XI) wherein each W3 is as defined previously, with HXR3 (XII) in a reaction-inert solvent such as, for example, 1,4-dioxane, 2-propanol or the like, and in the presence of a base such as, for example, N,N-diethylethanamine or N,N-diisopropylethylamine or the like. Different regio-specific isomers may be formed and can be separated from one another using suitable separation techniques such as, for example, chromatography. Intermediates of formula (VIII) can be prepared by reacting an intermediate of formula (XI-a) wherein W4 is a suitable leaving group such as, for example, a halogen, with an intermediate of formula (XIII) in a suitable solvent such as, for example, 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone, 1,4-dioxane or the like, in the presence of an acid such as, for example, 1 N hydrochloric acid in diethyl ether. This reaction can be performed at a temperature ranging between 50°C and 250°C. Alternatively, intermediates of formula (VIII) can be prepared by reacting an intermediate of formula (XIV) with a leaving group introducing agent, wherein W4 represents the leaving group and R represents the remaining of the leaving group introducing agent, examples of suitable leaving group introducing agents are phosphorous oxychloride, triflic anhydride or a functional derivative thereof under a reaction-inert atmosphere such as, for example, oxygen free argon or nitrogen. This reaction can be performed at a temperature ranging between 20°C and 150°C. Intermediates of formula (XIV) can be prepared by reacting an intermediate of formula (XV) or a functional derivative thereof, with an intermediate of formula (XIII). This reaction may be performed under solvent-free conditions or in an appropriate solvent such as, for example, diglyme, tetraline or the like under a reaction-inert atmosphere such as, for example, oxygen free argon or nitrogen, and optionally in the presence of a base such as, for example, sodium hydride, potassium hydride or the like. This reaction can be performed at a temperature ranging between 100°C and 250°C. Intermediates of formula (XIV) can also be prepared by reacting an intermediate of formula (XVI), wherein W5 is a suitable leaving group such as for example C1-6alkyloxy and Y and Q are as defined for an intermediate of formula (II), with an intermediate of formula (XVII) in an appropriate solvent such as , for example, ethanol, or the like, and in the presence of a base such as, for example, sodium ethoxide or the like, under a reaction-inert atmosphere such as, for example, oxygen free argon or nitrogen. The reaction can be performed at a temperature ranging between 20°C and 125°C. A convenient way of preparing an intermediate of formula (VIII) wherein Y is a bromine or chloro atom, said intermediates being represented by formula (VIII-1), involves the introduction of a bromine or chloro atom to an intermediate of formula (XVIII), wherein W4 is as previously defined, using N-bromosuccinimide or N-chlorosuccinimide in a reaction-inert solvent such as, for example, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride or the like. This reaction can be performed at a temperature ranging between 20°C and 125°C. Analogous to the conversion of intermediates of formula (II) wherein Q is a halogen to intermediates of formula (II) wherein Q is -NHR4, the intermediates of formula (VI), (VIII) and (XI) can also be converted. The compounds of formula (I) as prepared in the hereinabove described processes may be synthesized as a mixture of stereoisomeric forms, in particular in the form of racemic mixtures of enantiomers which can be separated from one another following art-known resolution procedures. The racemic compounds of formula (I) may be converted into the corresponding diastereomeric salt forms by reaction with a suitable chiral acid. Said diastereomeric salt forms are subsequently separated, for example, by selective or fractional crystallization and the enantiomers are liberated therefrom by alkali. An alternative manner of separating the enantiomeric forms of the compounds of formula (I) involves liquid chromatography using a chiral stationary phase. Said pure stereochemically isomeric forms may also be derived from the corresponding pure stereochemically isomeric forms of the appropriate starting materials, provided that the reaction occurs stereospecifically. Preferably if a specific stereoisomer is desired, said compound will be synthesized by stereospecific methods of preparation. These methods will advantageously employ enantiomerically pure starting materials. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that in the processes described above the functional groups of intermediate compounds may need to be blocked by protecting groups. Functional groups which it is desirable to protect include hydroxy, amino and carboxylic acid. Suitable protecting groups for hydroxy include trialkylsilyl groups (e.g. tert-butyldimethylsilyl, tert-butyldiphenylsilyl or trimethylsilyl), benzyl and tetrahydropyranyl. Suitable protecting groups for amino include tert-butyloxycarbonyl or benzyloxycarbonyl. Suitable protecting groups for carboxylic acid include C1-6alkyl or benzyl esters. The protection and deprotection of functional groups may take place before or after a reaction step. The use of protecting groups is fully described in 'Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry', edited by J W F McOmie, Plenum Press (1973), and 'Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis' 2nd edition, T W Greene & P G M Wutz, Wiley Interscience (1991). As described hereinabove, the compounds of the present invention are prodrugs. Prodrugs are pharmacologically acceptable derivatives of drugs per se. After administration to the subject in need thereof, the prodrugs undergo a conversion to the physiologically active species. This conversion may involve an enzymatic or chemical cleavage of a functionality on the prodrug, thus resulting in the release of the corresponding active compound. The reference by Goodman and Gilman (The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 8th ed., McGraw-Hill, Int. Ed. 1992, "Biotransformation of Drugs", p. 13-15) describing prodrugs generally, is hereby incorporated. The present compounds hydrolyse under physiological conditions releasing the corresponding HIV replication inhibiting (reverse transcriptase inhibitors) pyrimidine derivatives of formula (II) or (II'). The advantage of prodrugs is that they may provide an increased bioavailability than that which could be obtained if the active compound per se was administered; a delayed bioavailability; an enhanced distribution into targeted tissues or an increased biological penetration into a given biological system (e.g. blood, lymphatic system, central nervous sytem); an altered metabolism and rate of excretion; an increased solubility. An increased solubility may allow administration by injection or by solution, the latter especially being preferred when the patients are children, elderly people or persons with difficulties to swallow. An increased solubility may enhance the bioavailability, and may also contribute to an improvement of the drug load per unit dosage form, which may reduce the patient's pill burden and hence improve the patient compliance. It may also provide for the possibility to increase the daily administered amount of drug. Due to their conversion under physiological conditions into the HIV replication inhibiting pyrimidines of formula (II) or (II'), the present compounds show antiretroviral properties, in particular against Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), which is the aetiological agent of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) in humans. The HIV virus preferentially infects human T-4 cells and destroys them or changes their normal function, particularly the coordination of the immune system. As a result, an infected patient has an everdecreasing number of T-4 cells, which moreover behave abnormally. Hence, the immunological defense system is unable to combat infections and neoplasms and the HIV infected subject usually dies by opportunistic infections such as pneumonia, or by cancers. Other conditions associated with HIV infection include thrombocytopaenia, Kaposi's sarcoma and infection of the central nervous system characterized by progressive demyelination, resulting in dementia and symptoms such as, progressive dysarthria, ataxia and disorientation. HIV infection further has also been associated with peripheral neuropathy, progressive generalized lymphadenopathy (PGL) and AIDS-related complex (ARC). The present compounds also show activity against multi drug resistant HIV strains, in particular multi drug resistant HIV-1 strains, more in particular the present compounds show activity against HIV strains, especially HIV-1 strains, that have acquired resistance to art-known non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Art-known non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors are those non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors other than the active species of the prodrugs of the present invention. They also have little or no binding affinity to human α-1 acid glycoprotein. Due to their conversion into compounds having antiretroviral properties, particularly anti-HIV properties, especially anti-HIV-1-activity, the compounds of formula (I) or (I'), their N-oxides, pharmaceutically acceptable addition salts, quaternary amines and stereochemically isomeric forms thereof, are useful in the treatment or prevention of viral infections. In general, the compounds of the present invention may be useful in the treatment of warm-blooded animals infected with viruses whose existence is mediated by, or depends upon, the enzyme reverse transcriptase. Conditions which may be prevented or treated with the compounds of the present invention, especially conditions associated with HIV and other pathogenic retroviruses, include AIDS, AIDS-related complex (ARC), progressive generalized lymphadenopathy (PGL), as well as chronic CNS diseases caused by retroviruses, such as, for example HIV mediated dementia and multiple sclerosis. The present compounds of formula (I) or (I') or any subgroup thereof may therefore be used as medicines, especially against above-mentioned conditions. They may be used in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment or the prevention of the above-mentioned conditions. Said use as a medicine or method of treatment comprises the systemic administration to HIV-infected subjects of an amount effective to combat the conditions associated with HIV and other pathogenic retroviruses, especially HIV-1. In view of the utility of the compounds of formula (I) or (I'), there is provided a compound of claim 1 for use in a method of treating warm-blooded animals, including humans, suffering from or a method of preventing warm-blooded animals, including humans, to suffer from viral infections, especially HIV infections. Said method comprises the administration, preferably oral administration, of an effective amount of a compound of formula (I) or (I'), a N-oxide form, a pharmaceutically acceptable addition salt, a quaternary amine or a possible stereoisomeric form thereof, to warm-blooded animals, including humans. The present invention also provides compositions for treating viral infections comprising a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula (I) or (I') and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. The compounds of the present invention or any subgroup thereof may be formulated into various pharmaceutical forms for administration purposes. As appropriate compositions there may be cited all compositions usually employed for systemically administering drugs. To prepare the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention, an effective amount of the particular compound, optionally in addition salt form, as the active ingredient is combined in intimate admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, which carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration. These pharmaceutical compositions are desirable in unitary dosage form suitable, particularly, for administration orally, rectally, percutaneously, or by parenteral injection. For example, in preparing the compositions in oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed such as, for example, water, glycols, oils, alcohols and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations such as suspensions, syrups, elixirs, emulsions and solutions; or solid carriers such as starches, sugars, kaolin, diluents, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like in the case of powders, pills, capsules, and tablets. Because of their ease in administration, tablets and capsules represent the most advantageous oral dosage unit forms, in which case solid pharmaceutical carriers are obviously employed. For parenteral compositions, the carrier will usually comprise sterile water, at least in large part, though other ingredients, for example, to aid solubility, may be included. Injectable solutions, for example, may be prepared in which the carrier comprises saline solution, glucose solution or a mixture of saline and glucose solution. Injectable suspensions may also be prepared in which case appropriate liquid carriers, suspending agents and the like may be employed. Also included are solid form preparations which are intended to be converted, shortly before use, to liquid form preparations. In the compositions suitable for percutaneous administration, the carrier optionally comprises a penetration enhancing agent and/or a suitable wetting agent, optionally combined with suitable additives of any nature in minor proportions, which additives do not introduce a significant deleterious effect on the skin. Said additives may facilitate the administration to the skin and/or may be helpful for preparing the desired compositions. These compositions may be administered in various ways, e.g., as a transdermal patch, as a spot-on, as an ointment. The compounds of the present invention may also be administered via inhalation or insufflation by means of methods and formulations employed in the art for administration via this way. Thus, in general the compounds of the present invention may be administered to the lungs in the form of a solution, a suspension or a dry powder. Any system developed for the delivery of solutions, suspensions or dry powders via oral or nasal inhalation or insufflation are suitable for the administration of the present compounds. It is especially advantageous to formulate the aforementioned pharmaceutical compositions in unit dosage form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Unit dosage form as used herein refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active ingredient calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. Examples of such unit dosage forms are tablets (including scored or coated tablets), capsules, pills, powder packets, wafers, suppositories, injectable solutions or suspensions and the like, and segregated multiples thereof. Since the present compounds are prodrugs, which have to be converted into the active compounds per se, it will be appreciated that their dose to be administered will be such as to release an effective therapeutic or prophylactic amount of the active compound per se upon conversion. As used hereinbefore or hereinafter, a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula (I) or (I') will define such an amount of a compound of formula (I) or (I') which enables the release of a therapeutically effective amount of the corresponding active compound per se upon conversion. In general it is contemplated that an effective daily amount of the corresponding HIV replication inhibiting pyrimidine derivative per se would be from 0.01 mg/kg to 50 mg/kg body weight, more preferably from 0.1 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg body weight. It may be appropriate to administer the required dose as two, three, four or more sub-doses at appropriate intervals throughout the day. Said sub-doses may be formulated as unit dosage forms, for example, containing 1 to 1000 mg, and in particular 5 to 200 mg of active ingredient per unit dosage form. The exact dosage and frequency of administration depends on the particular compound of formula (I) or (I') used, the particular condition being treated, the severity of the condition being treated, the age, weight and general physical condition of the particular patient as well as other medication the individual may be taking, as is well known to those skilled in the art. Furthermore, it is evident that said effective daily amount may be lowered or increased depending on the response of the treated subject and/or depending on the evaluation of the physician prescribing the compounds of the instant invention. The effective daily amount ranges mentioned hereinabove are therefore only guidelines and are not intended to limit the scope or use of the invention to any extent. The present prodrugs can be used alone or in combination with other therapeutic agents, such as anti-virals, antibiotics, immunomodulators or vaccines for the treatment of viral infections. They may also be used alone or in combination with other prophylactic agents for the prevention of viral infections. The present compounds may be used in vaccines and methods for protecting individuals against viral infections over an extended period of time. The prodrugs may be employed in such vaccines either alone or together with other compounds of this invention or together with other anti-viral agents in a manner consistent with the conventional utilization of reverse transcriptase inhibitors in vaccines. Thus, the present compounds may be combined with pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvants conventionally employed in vaccines and administered in prophylactically effective amounts to protect individuals over an extended period of time against HIV infection. The combination of an antiretroviral compound and a compound of formula (I) or (I') can be used as a medicine. Thus, the present invention also relates to a product containing (a) a compound of formula (I) or (I'), and (b) another antiretroviral compound, as a combined preparation for simultaneous, separate or sequential use in anti-HIV treatment. The different drugs may be combined in a single preparation together with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. Said other antiretroviral compounds may be known antiretroviral compounds such as suramine, pentamidine, thymopentin, castanospermine, dextran (dextran sulfate), foscamet-sodium (trisodium phosphono formate); nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, e.g. zidovudine (3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine, AZT), didanosine (2',3'-dideoxyinosine; ddI), zalcitabine (dideoxycytidine, ddC) or lamivudine (2'-3'-dideoxy-3'-thiacytidine, 3TC), stavudine (2',3'-didehydro-3'-deoxythymidine, d4T), abacavir and the like; non-nucleoside reverse transciptase inhibitors such as nevirapine (11-cyclopropyl-5,11-dihydro-4-methyl-6H-dipyrido[3,2-b : 2',3'-e][1,4]diazepin-6-one), efavirenz, delavirdine, TMC-120, TMC-125 and the like; compounds of the TIBO (tetrahydroimidazo[4,5,1-jk][1,4]-benzodiazepine-2(1H)-one and thione)-type e.g. (S)-8-chloro-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-5-methyl-6-(3-methyl-2-butenyl)imidazo-[4,5,1-jk][1,4]benzodiazepine-2(1H)-thione; compounds of the α-APA (α-anilino phenyl acetamide) type e.g. α-[(2-nitrophenyl)amino]-2,6-dichlorobenzene-acetamide and the like; inhibitors of trans-activating proteins, such as TAT-inhibitors, e.g. RO-5-3335, or REV inhibitors, and the like; protease inhibitors e.g. indinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, lopinavir (ABT-378), nelfinavir, amprenavir, TMC-126, BMS-232632, VX-175 and the like; fusion inhibitors, e.g. T-20, T-1249, AMD-3100 and the like; inhibitors of the viral integrase; nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors, e.g. tenofovir and the like; ribonucleotide reductase inhibitors, e.g. hydroxyurea and the like. By administering the compounds of the present invention with other anti-viral agents which target different events in the viral life cycle, the therapeutic effect of these compounds can be potentiated. Combination therapies as described above exert a synergistic effect in inhibiting HIV replication because each component of the combination acts on a different site of HIV replication. The use of such combinations may reduce the dosage of a given conventional anti-retroviral agent which would be required for a desired therapeutic or prophylactic effect as compared to when that agent is administered as a monotherapy. These combinations may reduce or eliminate the side effects of conventional single anti-retroviral therapy while not interfering with the anti-viral activity of the agents. These combinations reduce potential of resistance to single agent therapies, while minimizing any associated toxicity. These combinations may also increase the efficacy of the conventional agent without increasing the associated toxicity. The prodrugs of the present invention may also be administered in combination with immunomodulating agents, e.g. levamisole, bropirimine, anti-human alpha interferon antibody, interferon alpha, interleukin 2, methionine enkephalin, diethyldithiocarbamate, tumor necrosis factor, naltrexone and the like; antibiotics, e.g. pentamidine isethiorate and the like; or cholinergic agents, e.g. tacrine, rivastigmine, donepezil, galantamine and the like to prevent or combat infection and diseases or symptoms of diseases associated with HIV infections, such as AIDS and ARC, e.g. dementia. A compound of formula (I) or (I') can also be combined with another compound of formula (I) or (I'). Although the present invention focuses on the use of the present compounds for preventing or treating HIV infections, the present compounds may also be used as inhibitory agents for other viruses which depend on similar reverse transcriptases for obligatory events in their life cycle.

Cancer, 36, 445-451, 1985) to be highly susceptible to and permissive for HIV infection, served as the target cell line. Inhibition of the HIV-induced cytopathic effect was used as the end point. The viability of both HIV- and mock-infected cells was assessed spectrophotometrically via the in situ reduction of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT). The 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC50 in µM) was defined as the concentration of compound that reduced the absorbance of the mock-infected control sample by 50%. The percent protection achieved by the compound in HIV-infected cells was calculated by the following formula : ODTHIV-ODCHIVODCMOCK-ODCHIVexpressed in%, whereby (ODT)HIV is the optical density measured with a given concentration of the test compound in HIV-infected cells; (ODC)HIV is the optical density measured for the control untreated HIV-infected cells; (ODC)MOCK is the optical density measured for the control untreated mock-infected cells; all optical density values were determined at 540 nm. The dose achieving 50% protection according to the above formula was defined as the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50 in µM). Table 2Comp.
