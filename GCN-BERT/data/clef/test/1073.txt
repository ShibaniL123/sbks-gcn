While these exemplary embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention, it should be understood that other embodiments may be realized and that logical, chemical and mechanical changes may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. For example, the steps recited in any of the method or process descriptions may be executed in any order and are not necessarily limited to the order presented. Moreover, many of the functions or steps may be outsourced to or performed by one or more third parties. Furthermore, any reference to singular includes plural embodiments, and any reference to more than one component or step may include a singular embodiment or step.

Additionally, any reference to without contact (or similar phrases) may also include reduced contact or minimal contact. Corrosion inhibition compositions used on metal and metal coated substrates are important to many industries. For example, aircraft landing gear often contain metal coated substrates in landing gear and other components, such as bushings. Metal coated substrates are also used in other contexts, such as in other vehicles such automobiles, trains, and heavy equipment. In addition, metal coated substrates are found in construction contexts. As used herein, a “substrate” may include any metal and/or metal coated material. For example, a substrate may comprise iron, coated iron, steel, coated steel, stainless steel, coated stainless steel, nickel, coated nickel, aluminum, coated aluminum, bronze, coated bronze, and copper beryllium, coated copper beryllium, zinc and/or coated zinc. In various embodiments, stainless steel may comprise a high strength stainless steel such as 15-5PH. In various embodiments, a substrate may comprise a chromium-nickel-tungsten martensitic alloy (also known as Greek Ascoloy). In various embodiments, steel may comprise a high strength low-alloy steel such as 4340 or 300M. In various embodiments, a substrate may comprise a metal that is coated with another material. A coating may be applied by electroplating, cold spraying or other suitable methods. Coatings may comprise one or more metals, such as nickel (Ni), zinc (Zn), cadmium (Cd), titanium (Ti) and combinations thereof. For example, in various embodiments, a substrate may comprise a coated low alloy steel (e.g., 300M steel) comprising a Zn—Ni coating. In various embodiments, a substrate may comprise a coated steel comprising a Cd and/or a TiCd coating, optionally chromate conversion top-coated overcoat. In various embodiments, a substrate may comprise a zinc alloy and/or a TCP (trivalent chromium process (Trivalent Cr coating process) coated zinc alloy. In various embodiments, a substrate may comprise bare steel and/or bare stainless steel. In various embodiments, a substrate may comprise aluminum-nickel-bronze alloys and/or copper alloys. In various embodiments, a substrate may comprise aluminum and aluminum alloys. White rust is a form of corrosion product that may affect substrates comprising zinc. For example, white rust may affect bare zinc and/or metals coated with zinc containing materials, such as Zn—Ni coated or plated steel, since the former functions as a sacrificial coating that protects a steel substrate from corroding. Exposure to water and carbon dioxide may cause zinc oxide and/or zinc hydroxide to form, which may be referred to as white rust, eventually leaving the steel substrate unprotected against corrosion. To aid in preventing this form of corrosion and/or to promote surface passivation, among other things, it may be beneficial to coat a substrate with a corrosion inhibition composition. This corrosion inhibiting composition may also protect the substrate at scratched or damaged areas, and/or areas where the sacrificial coating has failed. A corrosion inhibition composition may comprise one or more materials that inhibit at least one form of corrosion of a substrate and/or promote surface passivation of a substrate. In various embodiments, a corrosion inhibition composition may comprise one of more constituent species that may be referred to as pigments or corrosion inhibition constituents. In various embodiments, the corrosion inhibition constituents may combine in a synergistic manner to help prevent corrosion of a substrate and/or promote surface passivation of a substrate. A corrosion inhibition composition may be mixed with an application vehicle to aid the application of the corrosion inhibition composition to a substrate. An application vehicle may be one or more materials that aid in the dispersing and/or application of a corrosion inhibition composition to a substrate. For example, an application vehicle may comprise an organic resin matrix. In various embodiments, organic resin matrices used as application vehicles include one or more of an epoxy, a polyurethane, an alkyd, a polysulfide, a silicone, an acrylic, or butadiene. In that regard, the corrosion inhibition composition, and/or a smart release adjunct, as described herein, may be referred to as a corrosion inhibition organic coating. As further described herein, the efficacy of the use of molybdates as corrosion inhibition constituents is related to the solubility of molybdate. The higher solubility, the better inhibition molybdates tend to offer. However, using a high solubility of molybdate in corrosion inhibition organic coatings may produce other issues in corrosion inhibition organic coating application, such as formation of blistering, or a lack of long-term corrosion protection performance. In addition, it is beneficial for a corrosion inhibition organic coating to have a poorly soluble corrosion inhibition composition. Thus, a sparingly soluble corrosion inhibition composition may be beneficial. For example, in accordance with various embodiments, a corrosion inhibition composition may have a solubility of between 0.1 and 20 millimolar (mM) (where 1 mM=10−3 mol/L), between 0.5 mM and 15 mM, and between 1 mM and 10 mM. In that regard, a smart release adjunct may be used to enhance molybdate solubility in corrosion inhibition compositions that contain molybdate. A smart release adjunct may be any material that regulates the solubility of molybdate. In various embodiments, a corrosion inhibition composition may regulate the corrosion current of a substrate in sodium chloride solution to values at or below those achieved with a saturated strontium chromate solution, with or without the presence of dissolved oxygen. In addition, a corrosion inhibition composition may maintain an open circuit potential (OCP) relationship of steel greater than Cd, TiCd, and plated Zn alloys and/or maintain a corrosion current of Cd, TiCd and Zn alloy plating greater than steel. The present inventors have found that substances such as silicate, molybdate and tungstate compounds tend to inhibit corrosion while elevating the open circuit potential of metals to differing degrees. The present inventors have also found that compounds such as rare earth metal cations, zinc phosphate and benzoate compounds inhibit corrosion while depressing the open circuit potential. In addition, corrosion inhibition compositions and corrosion inhibition organic coatings, in accordance with various embodiments, tend to preserve the galvanic relationship between zinc nickel and steel, where zinc nickel is sacrificial to steel, where the substrate is steel coated with (e.g., plated with) zinc nickel. A corrosion inhibition composition may, in various embodiments, comprise a cerium, a silicate compound, and a molybdate compound. As used herein, a molybdate is a compound that contains an oxide of molybdenum. In various embodiments, the molybdate compound is ZnMoO4 and/or CaMoO4. In various embodiments, the cerium comprises between 10% and 90% by weight (% wt) of the corrosion inhibition composition. As used herein, the term “% wt” or “% by weight,” used in reference to a corrosion inhibition composition, may refer to the percentage weight of a corrosion inhibition constituent or a group of corrosion inhibition constituents over the weight of the entire corrosion inhibition composition. For the avoidance of doubt, the weight of the entire corrosion inhibition composition in % wt does not include the weight of any application vehicle and/or smart release adjunct used in a corrosion inhibition organic coating. In various embodiments, molybdate compound (e.g., ZnMoO4) comprises between 10% and 90% by weight of the corrosion inhibition composition. In various embodiments, the cerium comprises 50% by weight of the corrosion inhibition composition and the molybdate compound (e.g., ZnMoO4) comprises 50% by weight of the corrosion inhibition composition.

Testing was performed on a number of corrosion inhibition compositions. Corrosion current between substrate electrodes of the same size was measured in the inhibited electrolyte under an externally imposed potential difference ranging between larger than 0 mV and 200 mV. Corrosion inhibition compositions were screened for inhibition by comparing steady state corrosion current at inhibitor saturation level in a typical electrolyte (e.g. 3500 ppm NaCl) versus the un-inhibited electrolyte control and the chromated inhibitor baseline (e.g. SrCrO4). The x axis of FIG. 2 shows the type of corrosion inhibition composition tested. Each corrosion inhibition composition tested was tested on TCP-ZnNi-plated steel (left bar) and ZnNi-plated steel (right bar). The y axis shows the current measured in μA. As shown, a composition consisting of a molybdate compound and a silicate compound is shown as corrosion inhibition composition 202. A composition consisting of a zinc oxide, a zinc hydroxide benzoate, and a sodium benzoate is shown as composition 204. A composition comprising a zinc oxide, a zinc hydroxide benzoate, a sodium benzoate, a molybdate and a silicate compound is shown as composition 206. As illustrated, the current exhibited by composition 206 is lower than what would have been expected by additively combining composition 202 and composition 204.

Inhibition level measurements were taken over TCP/ZnNi-plated steel, ZnNi-plated steel, bare steel, and CCC/Cd-plated steel substrates. The below table summarizes the results in TABLE 1.

As described above, one or more smart release adjuncts may be used in a corrosion inhibition organic coating. The smart release adjunct aids in the solubility of the corrosion inhibition composition. In various embodiments, a complexing agent (e.g., nicotinic acid or a salt of nicotinic acid) is used as smart release adjunct to increase the solubility of CaMoO4/CaSiO3 pigments. In various embodiments, an anion (e.g., the oxalate anion C2O42− of MgC2O42−) is used as smart release adjunct to react with a targeted cation (e.g, Ca2+), forming the lower solubility CaC2O4 thus increasing the solubility of CaMoO4/CaSiO3 pigments. In various embodiments, a tungstate WO42− (e.g. Na2WO4 or CaWO4) is combined with SrMoO4 pigment forming the lower solubility SrWO4 thus increasing the solubility of SrMoO4. In various embodiments, MgSiO3 combined with ZnMoO4 is used as smart release adjunct with a corrosion inhibition composition that has a high percentage by weight of MoO42−. With reference to FIG. 6, method 600 is illustrated. In step 602, one or more smart release adjuncts may be combined with a corrosion inhibition composition and an application vehicle (e.g. organic resin matrix) to form a corrosion inhibition organic coating. In step 604, corrosion inhibition organic coating may be painted or otherwise distributed on a substrate and allowed to dry. For example, a corrosion inhibition organic coating may be applied using a brush and/or roller. A corrosion inhibition organic coating may also be applied by dipping or by spraying. Spraying may involve a pump style paint application system, with or without the use of air, to spray the corrosion inhibition organic coating onto the substrate. In various embodiments, spraying may involve the use of a propellant, such as a volatile hydrocarbon, to pressurize the corrosion inhibition organic coating and propel the corrosion inhibition organic coating onto the substrate. Step 604 may be repeated one or more times to build one or more layers onto the substrate. Systems, methods and computer program products are provided.
