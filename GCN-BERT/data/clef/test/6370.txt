For fully describing the solutions of the present application for solving problems, the following embodiments are illustrated as examples, and are not intended to limit the present application and the specific implementation, and are only for fully illustrating the technical solutions of the present application. First Embodiment In this embodiment, referring to FIG. 3 and FIG. 4, the retaining member is a protrusion 202 arranged at an outer portion of the atomizing assembly. The battery connecting end 1011 is provided with a guiding retaining groove seat 120. The guiding retaining groove 111 is arranged on the side wall of the guiding retaining groove seat 120, and is configured to allow the protrusion to be inserted therein, to prevent the mutual rotation of the atomizing assembly 102 and the battery assembly 101. In this embodiment, most electronic cigarettes are cylindrical to look like the real cigarettes. The atomizer connecting end 1022 is also a solid cylinder, and the cylinder is provided with a protrusion 202 in the axial direction of the electronic cigarette to function as the retaining member. The battery connecting end 1011 is provided with an accommodating cavity 113 for cooperating with the atomizer connecting end 1022. The accommodating cavity 113 is provided with the guiding retaining groove seat 120, and the side wall of the guiding retaining groove seat 120 is provided with the guiding retaining groove 111 which is configured to allow the protrusion 202 to be inserted therein, to prevent the mutual rotation of the atomizing assembly 102 and the battery assembly 101. In this embodiment, the guiding retaining groove seat 120 is fixed in the accommodating cavity 113. When the atomizer connecting end 1022 is inserted into the accommodating cavity 113 of the battery connecting end 1011, the protrusion 202 is inserted into the guiding retaining groove 111 of the guiding retaining groove seat 120 at the same time. In this embodiment, at least one protrusion 202 is provided, and at least two guiding retaining grooves 111 are provided. If the connecting end is provided with one protrusion, the number of the guiding retaining grooves 111 can be two or three or four. The protrusion 202 can correspond to any one of the guiding retaining grooves 111, thus the user has more choices when connecting the battery assembly and the atomizing assemble. In this way, the connection of the atomizing assembly and the battery assembly is convenient, which is unlike the situation that the atomizing assembly and the battery assembly has to be perfectly matched to be connected when one protrusion corresponding to one guiding retaining groove 111. If there are two protrusions, the number of the guiding retaining grooves 111 can be two or four, which facilitates the user inserting the protrusions into the guiding retaining groove 111. The specific numbers of the protrusions and the guiding retaining groove 111 are not limited herein. In this embodiment, it is preferable that the number of the protrusions is two, and the number of the guiding retaining grooves 111 is four. In this embodiment, the protrusion 202 is square, and if the protrusion 202 is arranged on the atomizer connecting end 1022, the length of the protrusion 202 in the axial direction of the atomizer connecting end 1022 is less than or equal to the axial length of the atomizer connecting end 1022. In the case that the length of the protrusion 202 is equal to the axial length of the atomizer connecting end 1022, the protrusion 202 can realize the best effect for preventing rotation of the atomizing assembly and the battery assembly. In the case that the length of the protrusion 202 is less than the axial length of the atomizer connecting end 1022, the minimum length of the protrusion 202 can not less than one-third of the axial length of the atomizer connecting end 1022, otherwise, the effect for preventing rotation is not well. In this embodiment, the depth of the guiding retaining groove 111 should fit to the length of the protrusion 202. The depth of the guiding retaining groove 111 can be equal to or greater than the length of the protrusion 202, which is not limited herein. In this embodiment, for realizing better connection of the protrusion 202 and the guiding retaining groove 111, the protrusion 202 is a magnet, the wall of the guiding retaining groove 111 is made of magnetic material. The magnetic attraction makes the connection of the protrusion 202 and the guiding retaining groove 111 more tightly, which ensures the effect for preventing rotation. In this embodiment, the protrusion 202 and the connecting end can be integrally formed, and can also be separately formed. When the protrusion 202 and the connecting end are separately formed, the protrusion 202 is firstly mounted to the connecting end before connecting the atomizing assembly and the battery assembly. The specific manner is not limited. In this embodiment, the protrusion 202 may be embodied as a semicircle with elasticity; and the guiding retaining groove 111 is embodied as a semicircular groove. The semicircle matches with the semicircular groove, the number of the semicircular groove may be more than the number of the semicircle, and the positions of the semicircular groove and the semicircle on the connecting ends are not limited. When connecting the atomizing assembly to the battery assembly, the protrusion is pressed to be flush with the end surface of the connecting end while the connecting ends are connected since the semi-circular protrusion has elasticity, thus the protrusion won't interfere the connection, and when the semicircle is arranged in a position corresponding to the semicircular groove, the semicircle pops up to cooperate with the semicircular groove, to prevent rotation. The height, protruding out of the connecting end, of the semicircle is not limited herein, as long as the height is greater than a half of the length of the semicircular protrusion. A second embodiment of the present application is shown in FIG. 5 and FIG. 6. In this embodiment, the retaining member is a protruding snap ring 302 which is arranged in the axial direction of the electronic cigarette and has an embossment. The protruding snap ring 302 is fixedly connected to the atomizer connecting end. A groove ring 301 is provided in the accommodating cavity of the battery connecting end and is configured to cooperate with the protruding snap ring 302. The groove ring 301 is provided with a guiding retaining groove in the axial direction of the electronic cigarette, and the guiding retaining groove allows the embossment of the protruding snap ring 302 to be inserted therein, to prevent the mutual rotation of the atomizing assembly 102 and the battery assembly 101. The protruding snap ring 302 is mounted on the atomizer connecting end 1022. The groove ring 301 may be formed integrally, and may also be formed by several arcs mounted in the hollow cylinder of the battery connecting end 1011. By this way, after the atomizing assembly 102 is connected to the battery assembly 101, the embossment of the protruding snap ring 302 and the groove of the groove snap ring 301 may cooperate with each other to prevent the mutual rotation. In this embodiment, the protruding snap ring 302 is made of an annular member, the annular member is provided with at least one embossment, and the embossment has a corner angle. The number of the embossment can be two or three, or etc., which is not limited herein. The groove of the groove snap ring 301 matches with the embossment of the protruding snap ring 302, the number of the groove can be more than the number of the embossment, and the specific relationship between the numbers of the groove and the embossment is not limited herein. The length of the embossment in the axial direction of the atomizing assembly is less than or equal to the length of the groove. The length of the embossment in the axial direction of the atomizing assembly is less than or equal to the length of the atomizer connecting end, but the minimum length of the embossment should not be less than a half of the length of the atomizer connecting end, since the effect of preventing the mutual rotation realized by the embossment will be affected adversely in the case that the length of the embossment in the axial direction of the atomizing assembly is less than a half of the length of the atomizer connecting end. In this embodiment, the protruding snap ring 302 and the groove snap ring 301 are made of plastic material. The protruding snap ring 302 is contacted to the atomizer connecting end 1022 or the battery connecting end 1011 by injection molding. The groove snap ring 301 may be integrally formed and then slotted to form the groove, or, the ring may be formed by several parts, then the several parts of the ring are connected to the connecting end by injection molding with intervals therebetween, thereby forming the groove. The groove snap ring 301 is connected to the atomizer protruding snap ring 1022 or the battery connecting end 1011 by injection molding. In this embodiment, the protruding snap ring 302 and the groove snap ring 301, which are made of plastic material, are formed integrally in the mould to facilitate processing, and it is not required to machine the shape of a corner angle on the connecting ends of the atomizing assembly 102 and the battery connecting end 101, thus in the process of producing the electronic cigarette, the process can be reduced, the production process can be simplified, and the productivity can be increased. In this embodiment, the protruding snap ring 302 and the groove snap ring 301 after being produced are fixedly connected to the connecting ends by injection molding respectively, and this connection has a strong adhesion. After the injection molding is finished, this manner has the same effect as the structure in other embodiments that the member with the corner angle is integrally formed with the connecting end. The mutual rotation of the atomizing assembly 102 and the battery assembly 101 can be prevented by the interaction between the protruding snap ring 302 and the groove snap ring 301. In a third embodiment of the present application, the atomizer connecting end 1022 is a solid polygonal prism. The battery connecting end 1011 is a hollow polygonal prism which is configured to cooperate with the atomizer connecting end 1022. In this embodiment, the corner angle is an angle included by two edges of the polygonal prism, and is configured to prevent the mutual rotation of the atomizing assembly 102 and the battery assembly 101. In this embodiment, the atomizer connecting end 1022 can be a hollow polygonal prism, and the battery connecting end 1011 can be a solid polygonal prism which is configured to cooperate with the atomizer connecting end 1022. The above two manners only have structural change, and both use the corner angle to prevent the mutual rotation. In the embodiment, the hollow polygonal prism and the solid polygonal prism can be a trilateral polygonal prism or a quadrilateral polygonal prism. Of cause, the polygonal prism may also be a quinquelateral polygonal prism or a hexagonal polygonal prism, and etc., which is not limited herein. However, when the polygonal prism has excessive edges, the effect for preventing the rotation may be affected. The polygonal prism having excessive edges is similar to a circle, thus the atomizing assembly 102 and the battery assembly 101 can rotate with respect to each other. Therefore, it is preferable that a quadrilateral polygonal prism is used. In this embodiment, an embossment can be arranged on the end surface of the connecting end of the polygonal prism, and a groove for receiving the embossment may be arranged in the accommodating cavity of the polygonal prism, which can more effectively prevent the mutual rotation of the atomizing assembly 102 and the battery assembly 101. The embossment may be a magnet, and the wall of the groove may be made of magnetic material. In this embodiment, the atomizing assembly 102 is connected to the battery assembly 101 by magnetic attraction. The connecting ends of the atomizing assembly 102 and the battery assembly 101 are both a polygonal prism, and the shape of the main body of the electronic cigarette can be a cylinder, which is not limited herein. In this embodiment, the atomizer connecting end 1022 may be a hollow polygonal prism which is configured to cooperate with the battery connecting end 1011 and to allow the battery connecting end to be inserted therein. The battery connecting end 1011 may be a solid polygonal prism. In this manner, only the structures of the connecting ends of the atomizing assembly 102 and the battery assembly 101 are changed, and the working manner and the function are the same as the above manner, thus will not be repeated herein. Referring to FIG. 7 and FIG. 8, a fourth embodiment is provided according to the present application. In this embodiment, the atomizer connecting end 1022 is an arched body 402 which is formed by cutting a part of arc body from a cylinder along at least one section; and the battery connecting end 1011 is an arched groove 401 which is formed by cutting a part of arc body from a cylinder along at least one section. A part of arc is cut at one side of the cylinder, thus a corner angle is formed on the cylinder, and the corner angle can avoid the mutual rotation of the atomizing assembly 102 and the battery assembly 101. In this embodiment, a part of arc body can be cut along one or two sections, and also can be cut along three sections, and etc., which is not limited herein. The section is cut completely along with the connecting end. The section can be located between a quarter and a half of the length of the radius of the circular section of the cylinder, and is preferably located at one-third of the radius of the section of the cylinder. If the position of the section does not exceed a half of the radius or exceeds a quarter of the radius, the restraining force for restraining the mutual rotation of the atomizing assembly 102 and the battery assembly 101 will be affected adversely, and the above-described effect can not be achieved. In this embodiment, the atomizer connecting end is an arched groove 401 which is formed by cutting a part of arc body from a cylinder along at least one section, and the battery connecting end is an arch body 402 which is formed by cutting a part of arc body from a cylinder along at least one section. This solution is obtained by structural exchanging, which realizes the same effect as the above solution, thus will not be repeated herein.
