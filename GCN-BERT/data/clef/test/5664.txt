Synthesis of 3-methoxy-1-methyl-1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid
To a 50-mL round bottom flask, ethyl 3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylate (200 mg, 1.28 mmol), iodomethane (397 ÂµL, 6.40 mmol), and DMF (5 mL) were added, sodium hydride (60%, dispersed in liquid paraffin, 256 mg, 6.40 mmol) was added to the mixture, and the resulting mixture was stirred at room temperature for 22 hours. Under ice cooling, water was added to the reaction solution, and the resulting mixture was extracted three times with ethyl acetate. The combined organic layers were dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, then the insoluble substance was separated by filtration, and the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was subjected to silica gel column chromatography (25 g) using ethyl acetate and hexane (concentration gradient, 5 to 60%) as the elution solvent to obtain ethyl 3-methoxy-1-methyl-1H-pyrazole-4-carboxylate (51 mg, 22%) as white solid.
