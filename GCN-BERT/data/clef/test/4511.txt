BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition for preventing and treating cancer comprising C12orf59 protein or a fragment thereof, or a polynucleotide encoding the same as an active ingredient. 2. Description of the Related Art C12orf59 (chromosome 12 open reading frame 59) gene has been well kept in human, chimpagne, dog, cow, mouse, rat, and chicken. Two isoforms of its nucleotide sequence have been reported (BC131523, 183a.a.; NM—153022, 163a.a.). This protein has been presumed as a membrane protein considering the amino acid sequence thereof, but the function of this protein has not been disclosed, yet. In some patent descriptions (WO2010/037859 and US 2009/0163435), the involvement of C12orf59 gene in cancer has been proposed, which is though only in relation to the gene expression regulation by the treatment of anti-cancer drug. Up to date, the expression regulation and function of C12orf59 gene involved in cancer have not been explained, yet. Cancer is one of the toughest diseases threatening human health most, which is developed by a series of cell mutation in which cells are proliferated unlimitedly and uncontrollably and hence immortalized. A variety of biochemical mechanisms in relation to cancer have been disclosed and hence therapeutic agents have also been developed. However, any fundamental treatment method for cancer has not been established, yet. Studies have been actively undergoing to identify various biomolecules involved in cancer and thereby to develop a drug targeting such molecules, and attempts have also been made to increase cancer treatment effect by utilizing the combination of developed drugs. Therefore, it can be said that the task to identify a target molecule involved in cancer is very important. Colorectal cancer is a kind of incurable diseases which causes million illnesses every year over the world, among which 530,000 patients are killed. This disease increases so fast as to take the third place (12.7%) of total cancer cases in Korea, which seems to be partly attributed to aging and the change in dietary pattern. The recently developed anticancer agents that are effective in treating colorectal cancer are exemplified by fluoropyrimidines such as 5-FU, UFT and capecitabine (product name: XELODA®); irinotecan (product name: CAMPTO®); and oxaliplatin. Seven largest pharmaceutical markets including those in USA and Europe for colorectal cancer treatment agents amount to $900 million today, which is expected to grow fast to $7,800 million in 2017. However, there are always disadvantages of continuous use of these drugs, which are resistance and side effects. Therefore, it is requested to study further to develop a novel treatment agent. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), which has been used as a marker for diagnosing colorectal cancer, is a kind of glycoproteins normally generated in the prebirth stage. The production of this protein is normally stopped before birth. If CEA level in adult is higher than that in a newborn baby, it presents the possibility of colorectal cancer or other cancers. However, the CEA level can be increased in liver cirrhosis, liver failure, and alcoholic pancreatitis patients and smokers as well. Therefore, the CEA level is used for diagnosing cancer supplementarily. The present inventors have studied to develop a cancer diagnosis or cancer treatment agent, and as a result confirmed the expression of C12orf59 gene in cancer cell line. Particularly, when C12orf59 protein or a fragment thereof was over-expressed in cancer cell line, ITGA5 expression involved in cancer cell invasion was decreased, indicating the reduction of cancer cell invasion. When C12orf59 gene expression was suppressed in colorectal cancer cell line, cancer cell invasion was increased and cancer cell survivability was increased as well, leading to the activation of various cell signal transmission pathways. The above results indicate that C12orf59 gene has a function as a tumor suppressor. Additionally, the present invention confirmed that particular peptides originated from isoforms 1 and 2 of C12orf59 protein effectively inhibit invasion of cancer cells and metastasis. Therefore, the present inventors finally completed this invention by confirming that C12orf59 gene or protein can be effectively used for the pharmaceutical composition for preventing and treating cancer and for the method for screening cancer diagnosis or cancer treatment agent candidate substances. Additionally, the present invention was completed upon confirming that the particular peptides originated from isoforms 1 and 2 of C12orf59 proteins can be used in preventing and treating cancer.

The said C12orf59 (chromosome 12 open reading frame 59) protein or the fragment thereof preferably has the amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of the following amino acid sequences of 1)-3), but not always limited thereto: 1) amino acid sequence represented by SEQ.

ID. NOS: 27 to 39, but not always limited thereto. The present invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition for preventing and treating cancer comprising an inducer inducing the expression or activation of C12orf59 protein as an active ingredient. The cancer herein is preferably selected from the group consisting of esophageal cancer, stomach cancer, colorectal cancer, oral cancer, pharyngeal cancer, laryngeal cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer, cervical cancer, endometrial cancer, ovarian cancer, prostate cancer, testicular cancer, bladder cancer, renal cancer, liver cancer, pancreatic cancer, bone cancer, connective tissue cancer, skin cancer, melanoma, brain cancer, thyroid cancer, leukemia, Hodgkin's disease, lymphoma and multiple myeloma, but not always limited thereto. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, total RNA was extracted from each cell line, followed by RT-PCR to confirm the expression of C12orf59 gene in colorectal cancer, lung cancer, and stomach cancer cell lines. As a result, the expression was confirmed in colo205, HCT-15, and SW480 cell lines among the colorectal cancer cell lines (see FIG. 1a and FIG. 1b), and the expression similar to those in the said colorectal cancer cell lines was confirmed in the stomach cancer cell lines KAT0111 and NCl-N87, which was the medium level expression. It was also confirmed that the expression was comparatively high in the lung cancer cell line A549 and the stomach cancer cell lines AGS, MKN28, and MKN45, while the expression was very low in the stomach cancer cell line TMK1 (see FIG. 2). From the above results, it was confirmed that C12orf59 gene was expressed in two different isoforms in various cancer cell lines and the expression level was different according to the cell line. In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, SW480 cell line was transfected with pcDNA-C12orf59-isoform1-myc vector containing pcDNA-myc and C12orf59 construct to induce over-expression of C12orf59 therein. The intracellular location of C12orf59 protein was detected by immunofluorescence. As a result, C12orf59 was confirmed to be expressed on the surface of cancer cell (see FIG. 4). In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, SW480 cell line was transfected with the vectors containing pcDNA-myc and C12orf59 construct, which were pcDNA-C12orf59-isoform1-myc, pcDNA-C12orf59-isoform2-myc, and pcDNA-C12orf59-isoform1del-myc, followed by investigation of cancer cell invasion. As a result, it was confirmed that cancer cell invasion was decreased by the over-expression of C12orf59 (see FIG. 5a and FIG. 5b). SW480 cell line was also transfected with the vectors containing pcDNA-myc and C12orf59 construct, which were pcDNA-C12orf59-isoform1-myc, pcDNA-C12orf59-isoform2-myc, and pcDNA-C12orf59-isoform1del-myc, followed by investigation of the changes of promoter activity by luciferase assay. As a result, it was confirmed that the activities of AP-1 cis element and ITGA5 promoter were decreased by the over-expression of C12orf59 (see FIG. 6a and FIG. 6b). HCT-15 cell line was transfected with the vectors containing pcDNA-myc and C12orf59 construct, which were pcDNA-C12orf-sioform1-myc, pcDNA-C12orf59-isoform2-myc, and pcDNA-C12orf59-isoform1del-myc, and with AP-1 cis-element reporter, followed by investigation of AP-1 cis-element promoter activity by luciferase assay. As a result, it was confirmed that the cis-element AP-1 activity was decreased by C12orf59 protein (see FIG. 7a). ITGA5 promoter region includes AP-1 site, and the transcription factor AP-1 induces ITGA5 expression (Corbi et al., FEBS Letters (2000) 474:201-207). Thus, the decrease of the transcription factor AP-1 activity is presumed to reduce ITGA5 expression. It is also presumed that integrin a5, a member of integrin family, which has been reported to be involved in cancer cell invasion and wound healing and to be highly expressed in those colorectal cancer cells demonstrating higher invasion ability rather than in those cells showing lower invasion ability, is playing a certain role in cancer cell migration and invasion. The present inventors then confirmed that C12orf59 protein inhibited cancer cell invasion by inhibiting the transcription factor AP-1 activity and by suppressing the expression of integrin a5 (ITGA5) in colorectal cancer cells. In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, the colorectal cancer cell line SW480 was transfected with C12orf59 specific siRNA, followed by investigation of intracellular C12orf59 expression and cell morphology changes. As a result, it was confirmed that the expression of C12orf59 was suppressed 48 hours after the introduction of C12orf59 specific siRNA in SW480 cell line (see FIG. 8a). Morphological changes like cell diffusion and the formation of lamellipodia were also observed (see FIG. 8b). The above results confirmed that C12orf59 siRNA could inhibit the expression of C12orf59 in cancer cell line and the inhibition of C12orf59 expression caused morphological changes of cancer cells to have high mobility form. In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, SW480 cell line was transfected with C12orf59 specific siRNA, and then cancer cell invasion and survivability were investigated 48 hours after the transfection. As a result, it was confirmed that the inhibition of C12orf59 expression increased cancer cell invasion (see FIG. 8c) and induced anoikis (apoptosis following loss of cell anchorage)-resistance (see FIG. 10). In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, HCT-15 cell line was transfected with C12orf59 specific siRNA, and then cancer cell invasion was investigated 48 hours after the transfection. As a result, it was confirmed that the inhibition of C12orf59 expression increased cancer cell invasion (see FIGS. 9a and 9b). In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, the activation of cancer cell signal transmission pathway induced by C12orf59 specific siRNA was examined by Western blotting using cell lysates. As a result, it was confirmed that the phosphorylations of ERK1/2, p38, and JNK were all increased by C12orf59 specific siRNA in cancer cells (see FIG. 11), indicating that MAPK activation contributed to cancer cell invasion and survivability induced by the inhibition of C12orf59 expression. In addition, the peptide represented by SEQ. ID. NO: 28 or NO: 29 was constructed from the extracellular amino acid sequence of C12orf59 isoform 1 represented by SEQ. ID. NO: 1 or C12orf59 isoform 2 represented by SEQ. ID. NO: 2, followed by investigation of colorectal cancer cell invasion and survivability. As a result, it was confirmed that colorectal cancer cell invasion was decreased by the peptide represented by SEQ. ID. NO: 28 or NO: 29, and colorectal cancer cell survivability was also decreased thereby (see Figure and FIG. 13). From the above results, it was confirmed that the C12orf59 protein or a fragment thereof of the present invention inhibited cancer cell invasion. It was also confirmed that cancer cell invasion was increased and anoikis (apoptosis following loss of cell anchorage)-resistance was induced when the expression of C12orf59 was suppressed. Therefore, C12orf59 protein or a fragment thereof or a vector containing the polynucleotide encoding the same or a cell containing the said vector can be effectively used for the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition for preventing and treating cancer. The pharmaceutically effective dosage of the composition of the present invention can be determined by considering various factors such as administration method, target area, patient condition, etc. Thus, the dosage for human body has to be determined with the consideration of safety and efficiency at the same time. It is also possible to predict the effective dosage based on the effective dosage confirmed by animal test. Various factors that have to be considered for the determination of the effective dosage are described in the following articles: Hardman and Limbird, eds., Goodman and Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 10th ed. (2001), Pergamon Press; and E. W. Martin ed., Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th ed. (1990), Mack Publishing Co. The composition of the present invention can include any generally used carrier, diluent, excipient, or a combination of at least two of those. The pharmaceutically acceptable carrier can be any carrier that is able to deliver the composition of the present invention in human body without limitation, which is exemplified by the compounds described in Merck Index, 13th ed., Merck & Co. Inc., such as saline, sterilized water, Ringer's solution, buffered saline, dextrose solution, maltodextrin solution, glycerol, ethanol, liposome and a mixture comprising one or more of those components. If necessary, a general additive such as antioxidant, buffer, and bacteriostatic agent can be additionally added.

HCT116, HT29, Colo205, SW480, SW620, HCT15, SKOV-3, and IGROV-1 cell lines were cultured in RPMI1640 (GIBCO, USA) containing 10% FBS, penicillin-streptomycin, L-glutamine, and sodium pyruvate. HEK293E (Human Embryonic Kidney 293E) cell line was cultured in DMEM (Dulbeco's Modified Eagle Medium: GIBCO, USA) containing 10% FBS, penicillin-streptomycin, L-glutamine, sodium pyruvate, and glucose. The lung cancer cell line A549 and the stomach cancer cell line AGS, KATOIII, MKN28, MKN45, NCI-N87, SNU-216, SNU-638, SNU-668, SNU-719, and TMK1 were cultured in RPMI1640 (GIBCO, USA) containing 10% FBS, penicillin-streptomycin, L-glutamine, and sodium pyruvate. MKN28, MKN45, SNU-216, SNU-638, SNU-668, and SNU-719 cell lines were provided from Korean Cell Line Bank (Seoul), and TMK1 was provided from professor Park of Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital (Chonnam, Korea). Other cell lines were provided from ATCC and all the cell lines were cultured at 37° C. with 5% CO2. In addition, SW480sub cell line is a subpopulation isolated from SW480 cell line with high invasion ability. Example 2 Confirmation of C12orf59 Gene Expression in Cancer Cell Line To confirm the expression of C12orf59 gene in cancer cell line, total RNA was extracted by using TRIZOL® (Invitrogen) from the various cell lines cultured under the conditions described in <Example 1>. Then, RT-PCR was performed with the total RNA. Particularly, RT-PCR was performed as described in the below diagram. The primer sequences were as follows: the forward primer: 5′-cagccctgctgtatttcatcc-3′ (SEQ. ID. NO: 3), and the reverse primer: 5′-ggccaaacaccgactgcag-3′ (SEQ. ID. NO: 4). cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg RNA by using cDNA synthesis pre-mix kit (cat. K-2046, Bioneer, Korea). TABLE 1 RT-PCR conditions In the meantime, as for the internal control of PCR, beta-actin was used. At this time, the primers used were as follows: the forward primer: 5′-GCTCGTCGTCGACAACGGCTC-3′ (SEQ. ID. NO: 5) and the reverse primer: 5′-CAAACATGATCTGGGTCATCTTCTC-3′ (SEQ. ID. NO: 6). The obtained PCR product was electrophoresed on 2% agarose gel, or 5% or 8% polyacrylamide gel to confirm the expression. As a result, 297 bp (isoform1(183 a.a)) and 253 pb isoform2(163 a.a)) DNA fragments were amplified, according to the isoforms of C12orf59 gene. The expression was confirmed in the colon cancer cell lines Colo205 (low expression), HCT-15 (high expression), and SW480 (medium expression) (FIGS. 1a and 1b). In every cell line, 183a.a isoform was comparatively highly expressed. The expression was also detected in the stomach cancer cell lines KATOIII and NCI-N87, which was also medium level expression similar to that in the colorectal cancer cell line SW480. The expression level was comparatively high in the lung cancer cell line A549, the stomach cancer cell lines AGS, MKN28, and MKN45. In the meantime, the expression level was very low in the stomach cancer cell line TMK1 (FIG. 2). The expression level of 163a.a isoform was comparatively high in the lung cancer cell line A549 and the stomach cancer cell lines MKN45 and NCl-N87. From the above results, it was confirmed that C12orf59 gene was expressed in two different isoforms in various cancer cell lines, and the expression level was varied from each cell line. Example 3 Construction of C12orf59 Expression Vector Vectors in a variety forms were constructed by inserting C12orf59 gene therein in order to investigate the effect of C12orf59 expression in cancer cell lines. Particularly, the amino acid residing next to myc in pcDNA3.1-myc his A vector (Invitrogen) sequence was selectively mutated to stop codon by using site-directed mutagenesis (QUIKCHANGE II site-directed mutagenesis kit, Stratagene). Then, PCR was performed with the vector using the primers listed in Table 1 under the condition described in Table 2. Two kinds of isoforms of C12orf59 (UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot; Q4KMG9-1 (183a.a isoform 1) and Q4KMG9-2 (163a.a isoform 2)) and 66a.a form, the amino acids ranging 1st amino acid to 66th of 183a.a isoform 1 where cytoplasmic domain was eliminated, were subcloned by using XhoI/HindIII. Subcloning was performed to insert stop codon right next to 183a.a isoform1, 163a.a isoform 2, and 66a.a form in order to express C12orf59 protein that was designed not to express myc protein.

Example 4 Construction of Integrin α5 Promoter-Reporter For promoter reporter assay, integrin α 5 promoter-reporter construct was prepared. Particularly, to amplify human integrin α 5 promoter region of the colon cancer cell line SW480 genomic DNA, PCR was performed with the primers 5′-CCGCTCGAGGAGCTGAAGGTTGGGTCC-3′ (SEQ. ID. NO: 25) and 5′-CCGCTCGAGCCGTCTGTTCCCGGC-3′ (SEQ. ID. NO: 26). The amplified product obtained from the PCR, integrin alpha 5 promoter region, was digested with XhoI, which was inserted in pGL3 basic vector (Promega, Southampton, UK), leading to the construction of integrin α 5 promoter-reporter construct. Example 5 Construction of Poly-C12orf59 Antibody and Confirmation of the Effect Thereof To detect the expressed C12orf59, C12orf59 specific antibody was order-made by Young In Frontier. Particularly, polyclonal antibody was prepared by immunizing a rabbit with one of three epitopes (the 3rd underlined amino acid sequence of FIG. 3a) highly usable for antibody construction (Young In Frontier) (FIG. 3). Western blotting was performed to confirm the prepared antibody. Particularly, HEK293E cells were transfected with the vectors constructed in Example 3 (pcDNA-myc, pcDNA-C12orf59-isoform1-myc, pcDNA-C12orf59-isoform1, pcDNA-C12orf59-isoform2-myc, and pcDNA-C12orf59-isoform2 by using PEI reagent. 48 hours later, the cells were lysed using RIPA buffer (10 mM Tris, pH7.2, 150 mM NaCl, 1% deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 50 mM NaF, 1 mM PMSF, complete protease inhibitor). The proteins in the obtained cell lysate were quantified. 30 μg of the cell lysate quantified above was mixed with SDS sample buffer, which was heated, followed by electrophoresis on 18% SDS-PAGE gel. The protein isolated by the electrophoresis was transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane, followed by blocking with 5% skim milk. The membrane was reacted with the prepared antibodies (primary antibody, 1:2000). Then, the membrane was reacted with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Bio-rad, USA). Antibody/antigen affinity was analyzed using ECL kit (ECL Plus, Amersham, USA) according to the manufacturer's instruction. As a result, it was confirmed that the two kinds of antibodies (Rabbit #1 and Rabbit #2) obtained from two rabbits did recognize clearly C12orf59 protein in the cell lysate expressing the protein (FIG. 3b, left panel, arrow). The confirmed band disappeared after the blocking using the antigen peptide blocking reagent used for the construction of antibody (FIG. 3b, right panel), indicating that the band was C12orf59 protein-specific. Therefore, it was confirmed that the order-made antibody was C12orf59 antibody specifically recognizing C12orf59 protein.

As a result, C12orf59 protein was confirmed to exist on the cell surface (FIG. 4), which was attributed to transmembrane domain in the amino acid sequence of C12orf59. <1-2> Changes of Cancer Cell Invasion Ability by C12orf59 Over-Expression To investigate the changes of cancer cell invasion ability induced by C12orf59 over-expression in cancer cell lines, the colon cancer cell line SW480 was transected with pcDNA-myc, pcDNA-C12orf59-isoform1-myc, pcDNA-C12orf59-isoform2-myc, and pcDNA-C12orf59-isoform1del-myc, followed by invasion assay 48 hours later. Particularly, the porous membrane of 24-well transwell plate (8 μm pore size; Costar, USA) was coated with 100 μl of MATRIGEL (BD Biosciences, USA) diluted in serum free medium at the concentration of 200 μg/ml for invasion assay, which stood at room temperature for 1 hour for fixing. The lower chamber of the transwell plate was coated with 100 μl of collagen type I (Sigma) at the concentration of 20 μg/ml for migration and invasion assay. The transformed cells transfected with pcDNA-myc, pcDNA-C12orf59-isoform1-myc, pcDNA-C12orf59-isoform2-myc, and pcDNA-C12orf59-isoform1del-myc by microporation as described in Experimental Example <1-1> were distributed in the upper chamber of the said 24-well transwell plate at the density of 2.5×104 and 3×104 cells respectively. Culture was performed at 37° C. with 5% CO2 for 48 hours to let the cells migrate from the upper chamber to the lower chamber. The non-migrated cells were eliminated from the surface of the upper chamber. The cells migrated to the lower chamber were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde dissolved in PBS, followed by staining with 2% crystal violet solution. The excessive crystal violet solution was washed off with distilled water. The selected area (×100) was photographed. The number of the cells migrated and invaded was counted from 5 different selected areas. The experiment was duplicated with the same condition to make sure the results. Data reflected migrated cells±standard error at ×200 HPF (high power field). As a result, the transformed cells prepared by introducing pcDNA-myc, pcDNA-C12orf59-isoform1-myc, pcDNA-C12orf59-isoform2-myc, and pcDNA-C12orf59-isoform1del-myc into SW480 cell line demonstrated reduced cancer cell invasion ability when C12orf59 protein or a fragment thereof was expressed therein, except the control cell line transfected with pcDNA-myc vector (FIGS. 5a and 5b), indicating that C12orf59 could efficiently inhibit cancer cell invasion. <1-3> Inhibition of Integrin Expression by C12orf59 Over-Expression in Cancer Cell Line It is well-known that the promoter region of integrin alpha 5 (ITGA5) includes AP-1 site and the transcription factor AP-1 induces ITGA5 expression. Therefore, decrease of the AP-1 activity can reduce the expression of ITGA5. ITGA5 has been known to be involved in cancer cell invasion and wound healing, and is up-regulated in colorectal cancer cells having high invasion ability, compared with them having low invasion ability. It has been reported that ITGA5 contributes to migration and invasion of cancer cells. Therefore, the present inventors investigated whether the decrease of cancer cell invasion by C12orf59 over-expression was attributed to ITGA5 known to be involved in cancer cell migration and invasion. To do so, the C12orf59 over-expression vector, the reporter vector (Integrin α 5 promoter-reporter, ITGA5 promoter-reporter), and the AP-1 cis element vector (AP-1 cis-Reporting system, Stratagene) were expressed in the colorectal cancer cell line SW480. Then, the activity of each promoter therein was investigated by luciferase assay. Particularly, 2.5×105 SW480 cells were distributed in 6-well plate, followed by transfection with 1.8 μg of pcDNA-myc, pcDNA-C12orf59-isoform1-myc, pcDNA-C12orf59-isoform2-myc, and pcDNA-C12orf59-isoform1del-myc along with 2 μg of reporter plasmid DNA prepared in Example 4 by using LIPOFECTAMINE 2000 reagent (invitrogen). 48 hours after the transfection, luciferase activity was measured by DUAL-LUCIFERASE reporter assay system (Promega). Transfection efficiency was measured by using Renilla luciferase activity value measured after co-transfection with 0.2 μg of Renila luciferase vector and pRL-TK (Promega). As a result, in the cell line introduced with C12orf59 protein, AP-1 cis element and ITGA5 promoter altogether, the activities of AP-1 cis element and ITGA5 promoter were inhibited by C12orf59 over-expression and the inhibition was most peculiar with the vector pcDNA-C12orf59-isoform1del-myc (FIGS. 6a and 6b). The colon cancer cell line HCT-15 was also transfected with pcDNA-myc, pcDNA-C12orf59-isoform1-myc, pcDNA-C12orf59-isoform2-myc, pcDNA-C12orf59-isoform1del-myc, and AP-1 cis element (AP-1 cis-Reporting system, Stratagene) reporter vector by using LIPOFECTAMINE 2000 reagent by the same manner as described above. 48 hours after the transfection, the activity of AP-1 cis element promoter was confirmed by luciferase assay. As a result, it was confirmed that the activity of the transcription factor AP-1 was reduced in HCT-15 cell line by the expression of C12orf59 (FIG. 7a) and the phosphorylation level of c-jun, one of major components of AP-1, was also reduced (FIGS. 7b and 7c). From the above results, it was confirmed that the inhibition of cell invasion by C12orf59 in cancer cell line was attributed to the suppression of the transcription factor AP-1 activity and the inhibition of integrin α 5 expression. Experimental Example 2 Inhibition of C12orf59 Expression in Cancer Cell Line <2-1> Changes of Cell Morphology in Cancer Cell Line by the Inhibition of C12orf59 Expression To investigate the relation of the inhibition of C12orf59 expression and morphological changes in cancer cell line, the colon cancer cell line SW480 was transfected with C12orf59 specific siRNA by electroporation, followed by observation of changes in C12orf59 expression and cell morphology in the cancer cell line. Particularly, SW480 cells were harvested, followed by washing with PBS. The cells were resuspended in R buffer at the density of 3×105 cells/12 μl, to which 2 μl of 40 μM siRNA was added, followed by transfection using electroporation (NEON Transfection System, Invitrogen). To confirm the inhibition of the expression, RT-PCR was performed. At this time, the C12orf59 specific siRNA was purchased from Dharmacon Co. (4 different mixtures) and the 4 target sequences are as shown in the below: (SEQ. ID. NO: 7) 5′-GGG UAC AUC UCU GGU AUA U-3′, (SEQ. ID. NO: 8) 5′-UCA CAU CUC UGC AGU CGG U-3′, (SEQ. ID. NO: 9) 5′-GAA UAG UUG ACU CUU GGA A-3′, and (SEQ. ID. NO: 10) 5′-GGU UCU UAC UCU UCG UUC A-3′. Cell morphology was observed 48 hours after the transfection with C12orf59 siRNA. Cell shape was observed and photographed under Olympus microscope at 100×. Photographs were compared and analyzed. As a result, it was confirmed that the expression of C12orf59 was inhibited 48 hours after the introduction of C12orf59 specific siRNA (Dharmacon) in SW480 cell line (FIG. 8a). Morphological changes like cell diffusion and the formation of lamellipodia were also observed (FIG. 8b). Therefore, it was confirmed that the expression of C12orf59 in cancer cell line was inhibited by C12orf59 specific siRNA and the inhibition of C12orf59 expression resulted in the changes in cancer cell morphology into the typical form that was highly apt to migrate. <2-2> Cancer Cell Invasion Ability Affected by the Inhibition of C12orf59 Expression in Cancer Cell Line To analyze cancer cell invasion ability affected by the inhibition of C12orf59 expression in cancer cell line, SW480 cell line was transfected with C12orf59 specific siRNA (Dharmacon) and the control siRNA (sense strand: 5′-CUU ACG CUG AGU ACU UCG ATT-3′ (SEQ. ID. NO: 11), anti-sense strand: 5′-UCG AAG UAC UCA GCG UAA GTT-3′ (SEQ. ID. NO: 12), Samchully Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., Korea), followed by invasion assay 48 hours later. Particularly, the porous membrane of 24-well transwell plate (8 μm pore size; Costar, USA) was coated with 100 μm of matrigel (BD Biosciences, USA) diluted in serum free medium at the concentration of 250 μg/ml, which stood at room temperature for 1 hour for fixing. The lower part of the transwell plate was coated with 100 μl of collagen type I (Sigma) at the concentration of 20 μg/ml. The said collagen type I was used as a chemoattractant. 3×104 SW480 cells resuspended in serum free medium were distributed in the upper chamber of the said 24-well transwell plate, followed by culture at 37° C. with 5% CO2 for 48 hours, during which the cells were induced to migrate from the upper chamber to the lower chamber. The non-migrated cells were eliminated from the surface of the upper chamber. The cells migrated to the lower chamber were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde dissolved in PBS, followed by staining with 2% crystal violet solution. The excessive crystal violet solution was washed off with distilled water. The selected area (×200) was photographed. The number of the cells migrated was counted from 5 different selected areas. The experiment was duplicated with the same condition to make sure the results. Data reflected migrated cells±standard error at ×200 HPF (high power field). As a result, the inhibition of C12orf59 expression resulted in the increase of cancer cell invasion (FIG. 8c), indicating that the inhibition of C12orf59 expression in cancer cell line induced cancer cell morphological changes, increased cell migration, and hence increased cancer cell invasion ability. The colon cancer cell line HCT-15 was also transfected with C12orf59 specific siRNA (Samchully Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., Korea) by microporation. 48 hours later, the experiment using collagen and transwell coated with matrigel was performed by the same manner as described above. As a result, it was confirmed that cancer cell invasion was increased by the inhibition of C12orf59 expression in HCT-15 cell line (FIGS. 9a and 9b). <2-3> Investigation of Cancer Cell Survivability Affected by the Inhibition of C12orf59 Expression in Cancer Cell Line To investigate whether or not the inhibition of C12orf59 expression could affect cancer cell survivability, cell survival rate was measured under the anchorage independent condition. Particularly, 100 μl of poly-HEMA (Sigma) at the concentration of 12 mg/ml was loaded in 96-well plate, which stood in clean bench for 1 day, followed by drying. On the next day, the plate was coated with Poly-HEMA once again. SW480 cancer cells were transfected with siRNA for 48 hours, the cells were diluted at the density of 1×104, followed by plating in each well by 100 μl. At that time, serum free medium was used. 72 hours later, 10 μl of CCK-8 reagent (Dojindo cat. CK04-13) was added to each well, followed by reaction for 3 hours to induce color development. Then, OD450 was measured to investigate cell survivability. As a result, it was confirmed that cancer cell survivability was increased when C12orf59 siRNA was treated to inhibit the expression of C12orf59, compared with when the control siRNA was treated (FIG. 10). Therefore, it was confirmed that the inhibition of C12orf59 expression induced anoikis (apoptosis following loss of cell anchorage)-resistance. <2-4> Activation of Signal Transmission Pathway by the Inhibition of C12orf59 Expression in Cancer Cell Line To investigate the activation of cell signal transmission pathway by C12orf59 siRNA in cancer cell line, the colon cancer cell line SW480 was transfected with C12orf59 specific siRNA. 48 hours later, the cell lysate was obtained, and Western blotting was performed using the same. Particularly, the cells were lysed with RIPA buffer (10 mM Tris, pH7.2, 150 mM NaCl, 1% deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 50 mM NaF, 1 mM PMSF, complete protease inhibitor) and the cell lysate was quantified by modified Bradford assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, Calif.). 30 μl of the obtained cell lysate was mixed with SDS sample buffer, which was heated, followed by electrophoresis on 8% SDS-PAGE gel. The protein isolated on SDS-PAGE gel through electrophoresis was transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane, followed by blocking with 5% skim milk. The membrane was reacted with anti-beta-actin antibody (1:1000, Santa Cruz), anti-phosphorylated-ERK1/2 antibody, anti-ERK1/2 antibody, anti-phosphorylated-p38 antibody, anti-p38 antibody, anti-phosphorylated-JNK antibody, and anti-JNK antibody (1:1000, Cell signaling technology) as primary antibodies. Then, the membrane was reacted with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, followed by color development by using ECL kit (ECL Plus, Amersham, USA) according to the manufacturer's instruction. As a result, it was confirmed that the phosphorylations of ERK1/2, p38, and JNK were all increased by the inhibition of C12orf59 expression (FIG. 11), suggesting that MAPK activation contributed to cancer cell invasion and cancer cell survivability induced by the inhibition of C12orf59 expression. Experimental Example 3 Effect of the A_Intact Peptide and the B_Intact Peptide, which are Originated from C12orf59 Isoform, on Cancer Cells <3-1> Inhibition of Colorectal Cancer Cell Invasion by A_Intact Peptide and B_Intact Peptide Inhibitory effect of the peptide prepared in Example 6 on colorectal cancer cell invasion was investigated. SW480sub was subpopulation of SW480 having high in vitro invasion and in vivo metastasis ability. The effect of each peptide on colorectal cancer cell invasion was analyzed using the said SW480sub. SW480sub cells were mixed with each peptide, followed by pre-incubation for 30 minutes. The cell/peptide mixture was then distributed in the upper chamber of transwell plate, while buffer was added to the lower chamber, followed by invasion assay. Particularly, the porous membrane of 24-well transwell plate (8 μm pore size; Costar, USA) was coated with 100 μl of matrigel (BD Biosciences, USA) diluted in serum free medium at the concentration of 250 μl/ml, which stood at room temperature for 1 hour for fixing. The lower part of the transwell plate was coated with 100 μl of collagen type I (Sigma) at the concentration of 20 μl/ml. The said collagen type I was used as a chemoattractant. 1×104 cells resuspended in serum free medium were distributed in the upper chamber of the said 24-well transwell plate, followed by culture at 37° C. with 5% CO2 for 48 hours, during which the cells were induced to migrate from the upper chamber to the lower chamber. The non-migrated cells were eliminated from the surface of the upper chamber. The cells migrated to the lower chamber were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde dissolved in PBS, followed by staining with 2% crystal violet solution. The excessive crystal violet solution was washed off with distilled water. The selected area (×100) was photographed. The number of the cells migrated was counted from 5 different selected areas. Then, mean value and standard error were obtained. As a result, as shown in FIG. 12, colorectal cancer cell invasion was reduced by 82% and 90% by A_intact and B_intact (100 μg/ml) respectively (FIG. 12). <3-2> Effect of the A_Intact and B_Intact Peptides on Colorectal Cancer Cell Survivability To investigate the effect of the peptide prepared in Example 6 on colorectal cancer cell survivability, SW480 cells were mixed with each peptide and then distributed in 96-well plate coated with polyHEMA. 6 days later, cell survivability was measured by colorimetric technique under the anchorage independent condition. Particularly, 100 μl of poly-HEMA (Sigma) at the concentration of 12 mg/ml was loaded in 96-well plate, which stood in clean bench for 1 day, followed by drying. On the next day, the plate was coated with Poly-HEMA once again. Cells were distributed in the poly-HEMA coated plate by 100 μl/well (1×104 cells/well). At that time, serum-free medium was used. 6 days later, 10 μl of CCK-8 reagent (Dojindo cat. CK04-13) was added to each well, followed by reaction for 3 hours. Then, OD450 was measured. As a result, as shown in FIG. 13, cell survivability was reduced by 82% and 90% by A_intact and B_intact (100 μl/ml) respectively (FIG. 13). <3-3> Effect of Peptides Originated from C12orf59 Isoforms on Invasion of SW480sub Cells From Experimental Examples <3-1> and <3-2>, it was confirmed that A_intact peptide and B_intact peptide exhibit effects on cancer cell invasion. Accordingly, it was decided to develop a peptide which is capable of effectively inhibiting cancer cell invasion while having a shorter length compared to A_intact or B_intact peptides. Therefore, SW480sub cells were treated with each of the peptides of SEQ. ID. NOS: 30 to 39 prepared in Example 6, and cell invasion was analyzed. In particular, in order to investigate an effect of A_intact, A_C-term1, A_C-term2, B_intact, B_C-term1, B_Cen, and B_C-term2 which are peptides originated from C12orf59 prepared in Example 6 on an invasion ability of SW480sub cells cultured according to Example 1, invasion assay was performed as described in Example <3-1>. The peptides used therein were treated on cells at a concentration of 50 μM, except B_intact peptide which had a concentration of 43 μM. Through a microscope, the results confirmed that invasion was reduced when 7 peptides originated from C12orf59 peptides was treated, as demonstrated in FIGS. 14 and 15. It was observed that invasion of colorectal cancer cells were significantly reduced by in the order of 40%, 48% and 46% due to A_intact, A_N-term, A_C-term1, A_Cen, and A_C-term2 peptides compared to that of the vehicle control. Additionally, the invasion rate was significantly reduced by in the order of 29%, 73%, 33%, and 50% due to B_intact, B_C-term1, B_Cen, and B_C-term2 peptides compared to the control. Compared to the antecedent peptide, A_intact and B_intact, A_C-term1, A_C-term2, B_C-term1, B_Cen, and B_C-term2 exhibited similar or superior effects on invasion of colorectal cancer cells, despite their shorter length. In addition, the effect of the peptides on cancer cell invasion was investigated by treating SW480sub cells with A_C-term1 and A_C-term2 each at a concentration of 100 μg/mL, and the results are demonstrated in FIGS. 16 and 17. As demonstrated in FIGS. 16 and 17, the results showed that compared to the vehicle group treated with DMSO, the treatment of A_C-term1 and A_C-term2 peptides according to the present invention effectively inhibited the invasion of colorectal cancer cells. Especially, compared to treating A_intact peptide at an identical concentration (100 μg/mL) of A_C-term1 and A_C-term2 peptides as demonstrated in FIG. 12, treating A_C-term1 and A_C-term2 peptides exhibited greater inhibitory effects on colorectal cancer invasion while having a shorter length, as A_C-term1 exhibited inhibitory effects of about 92%, and A_C-term2 exhibited inhibitory effects of about 99%, while A_intact exhibited inhibitory effects of about 82%. <3-4> Effect of Peptides Originated from C12orf59 Isoforms on Invasion of SW480 Cells SW480 colorectal cancer cells were treated with peptides originated from C12orf59, and effects of the peptids on invasion of the cells were analyzed. In particular, in order to investigate the effect of 8 kinds of peptides originated from C12orf59 prepared in Example 6 on invasion of SW480 cells cultured according to Example 1, invasion assay was performed in the same manner as described in Example <3-2>. Through a microscope, the results confirmed that a total of 8 kinds of peptides originated from C12orf59 reduced cancer cell invasion, as demonstrated in FIGS. 18 and 19. Quantitatively, it was observed that the invasion of cells was reduced by 39%, 48%, 49%, and 38% by A_N-term, A_C-term1, A_Cen, and A_C-term2 peptides, respectively (FIG. 18). Additionally, the invasion rate was reduced by 47%, 55%, 45%, and 39% by B_intact, B_N-term, B_C-term1, and B_C-term2 peptides, respectively (FIG. 19). <3-5> Effect of Peptides A/B Common and B_Cen2 on Invasion of SW480 Cells In order to investigate effects of A_C-term2, B_C-term2, A/B common and B_Cen2 peptides prepared in Example 6 on the invasion of colorectal cancer cells, SW480 cells were treated with A_C-term2, B_C-term2, A/B common, and B_Cen2 peptides at a concentration of 50 μM. Further, SW480 cells were treated with DMSO 0.25% to serve as a control. The experiments were performed in the same manner as described in Experimental Example 3-1. The results showed that all of the four peptides inhibited the invasion of colorectal cancer cells compared to the control. Especially, B_Cen2 exhibited superior inhibitory effects on invasion of colorectal cancer cells even compared to A/B common, A_C-term2, and B_C-term2. A/B common also showed effects similar to those of A_C-term2 and B_C-term2. Experimental Example 4 Effects of Peptides Originated from C12orf59 on the Survival Rate of Colorectal Cancer Cells Based on the results of Experimental Example <3-2> which showed that the cancer cell survival rate was reduced in SW480sub colorectal cancer cells, the effect of A_N-term, A_C-term1, B_N-term, and B_C-term1 peptides on cellular survival rate was analyzed. In particular, a cellular survival rate was measured using absorbance in the same manner as in Example <3-2>. The results showed that A_N-term, A_C-term1, B_N-term, or B_C-term1 peptides all exhibited inhibitory effects on the survival of colorectal cancer cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Experimental Example 4 In Vivo Metastasis Inhibition by A_Intact Peptide 1. Generation of A_Intact-Fc Fusion Protein A_intact peptide fused with human immunoglobulin Fc protein was generated and total 4.5 mg was obtained (FIG. 20). N-terminal sequence (EEN) of this fusion protein was confirmed by N-terminal amino acid sequencing analysis service (Cosmogenetech co, Ltd, Seoul, Korea). 2. In Vivo Metastasis Inhibition by A_Intact-Fc Fusion Protein and A_Intact Peptide (1) In Vivo Experimental Metastasis Model In vivo therapeutic efficacy of A_intact peptide was evaluated using experimental metastasis mouse model. The in vivo experimental metastasis model was constructed as described below. Nude mice (BALB/c-nude, 6 weeks old, female) were obtained from Charles River Japan (Japan). C8161 (human melanoma) cells (8×105 cells in 1000 PBS per mouse) were injected into the tail vein. Two days later, mice were randomized into control and treatment groups (n=5 per group). Modified A_intact peptide (200 μl/100 μl PBS) or A_intact-Fc fusion protein (100 μl/100 μl PBS) were intravenously injected into each mouse twice per week (total 7 times). As a negative control, PBS (100 μl/mouse) was injected. All animals were killed at 4 weeks after injection of cancer cells. Lung and liver were excised and fixed in 10% formalin for 24 h. Metastatic foci on the surface of lung and liver were counted. When compared with negative control (PBS), A_intact-Fc fusion protein inhibited metastasis to the lung and liver in nude mice. Modified A_intact peptide (N-terminal acetylation and C-terminal amidation) also inhibited metastasis to the lung and liver in nude mice (FIGS. 21a and 21b). (2) Invasion Assay First, the invasion assay was performed as shown below. Specifically, C8161 (human melanoma) cell line was cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS, penicillin-streptomycin, L-glutamine, sodium pyruvate and glucose. C8161 cells (1×104) in the presence of the peptide were plated in serum-free medium on 24-well Transwell inserts (8 μm pore size; Costar, USA) coated with 25 μg of MATRIGEL (BD Biosciences, USA). The underside of the insert was coated with 100 μl of collagen type I (Sigma) at the concentration of 5 μg/ml. After incubation for 24 h at 37° C. with 5% CO2, the inserts were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde dissolved in PBS, followed by staining with 2% crystal violet solution. The number of cells that had invaded was counted in five representative fields per insert. Then, mean value and standard deviation were obtained. The results are shown in FIG. 22. As a result, as shown in FIG. 22, A_intact peptide reduced C8161 invasion by 10% and 45% at the concentration of 30 μg/ml and 100 μg/ml, respectively. In addition, B_intact peptide reduced invasion by 48% and 70% at the concentration of 30 μg/ml and 100 μg/ml, respectively. A_intact-Fc fusion protein also decreased C8161 invasion by 68% at the concentration of 30 μg/ml. These results suggest that reduction of in vivo metastasis of C8161 cells by A_intact peptide or A_intact-Fc fusion protein is associated with inhibition of in vitro invasion.
