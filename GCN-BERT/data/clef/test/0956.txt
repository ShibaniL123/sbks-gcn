BRINE LEACHING PROCESS FOR RECOVERING VALUABLE METALS FROM OXIDE MATERIALS CROSS-REFERENCE The present application claims the benefits of U.S. Provisional Application Serial No. 61/992,036 filed May 12, 2014 entitled "BRINE LEACHING PROCESS FOR RECOVERING VALUABLE METALS FROM OXIDE MATERIALS", the entire contents of which is incorporated herein by this reference. FIELD A method of recovering a valuable metal from a valuable metal-containing material is described. The method general describes recovering silver from a base metal- containing material. The valuable metal is recovered form the valuable metal-containing material at about a neutral pH value or at about a mildly basic pH value using a chloride-containing leaching solution. The valuable metal is generally silver and the valuable metal-containing material typically contains one or more base metals. The chloride-containing leaching solution dissolves at least most of the silver contained in the valuable metal-containing material but less than most of any one of the one or more base metals. The one or more base metals are commonly selected from the group consisting of lead, zinc and copper, more commonly one or more of lead and zinc. BACKGROUND Oxide ores and concentrates can have metallurgical properties complicating valuable metal recovery by hydrometallurgical processes, particularly by aqueous leaching processes. The recovery of silver from silver-containing ores having base metals, such as for example lead, and zinc, among others, can be complicated when the both of the silver and base metals are brought into solution during the leaching process. Furthermore, some aqueous leaching processes can be expensive and can potentially present a severe environmental hazard if not properly controlled. For example, in direct cyanide leaching, cyanide is contacted with the ore or concentrate in the presence of molecular oxygen to dissolve the valuable metal and form a pregnant leach solution. Activated carbon can be employed to collect the dissolved valuable metal. Although effective, cyanide leaching can be expensive and, if not properly controlled, is extremely hazardous. In another process, the ore or concentrate is contacted with a hot agitated chloride lixiviant. A typical lixiviant solution includes about 200 g/L sodium chloride, 10 g/L ferric iron, and 10 g/L HCl. The lixiviant dissolves not only silver but also lead, zinc, tin, and other base metals. Separation of the various dissolved metal species can be expensive and difficult. Additional expense is incurred by the use of an acidic solution containing hydrochloric acid and elevated process solution temperatures. Moreover, the elevated temperature and high hydrochloride acid concentration present an environmental hazard.

The present disclosure can provide a number of advantages depending on the particular configuration. The brine leaching process described in this disclosure can provide a high level of silver recovery from base metal oxide, sulfide, and mixed oxide/sulfide ores and concentrates even when performed at ambient temperature and pressure. It can be agnostic to mineralogy of such ores and concentrates. It can have similar or superior recoveries to conventional cyanide leaching while being substantially less expensive and having few, if any, environmental risks. It can be configured to substantially avoid or inhibit dissolution of base metals, particularly lead, zinc, and iron, thereby avoiding the need to remove the dissolved base metals from solution. It can use readily available salt deposits and/or seawater as the leaching agent.

The "Merrill-Crowe process" refers to a process in which the pregnant leach solution is separated from the ore by methods such as filtration (e.g. horizontal leaf type clarifiers) and counter current decantation (CCD). Afterwards a very clear solution is achieved by using pre- coated filters applying diatomaceous earth. Oxygen is then removed by passing the solution through a vacuum de-aeration column. Zinc dust is added to the clarified, de-aerated solution which precipitates the gold and/or silver; zinc having a higher affinity for the lixiviant ion than gold and/or silver. The precipitate (mixed with zinc dust) is then filtered out of the solution, and the zinc dust and gold and/or silver are mixed with sulfuric acid to dissolve the zinc. The solution is filtered, and the remaining solids are smelted to a gold and/or silver bullion bar.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION A typical silver-containing mineral having the composition given in Table 1 was subjected to a standard cyanide leach process, a common acidic salt leach process and an aqueous salt solution leach process according to some of the embodiments described herein. Table 1 Table 2 summarizes the cyanide leach process parameters and the silver, the copper, zinc and lead recovered from the silver-containing mineral by the cyanide leach process. Table 3 summarizes the salt leach process parameters and the silver, iron, zinc and lead recovered from the silver-containing mineral by an acidic salt leach process (sample 30) and aqueous salt solution leach process (samples 31-33). Both the cyanide and acidic salt leaching processes leach substantial amounts of the base metals from the silver-containing mineral. The cyanide process leaches 34% of copper, 6% of the zinc and 17% of lead from the Table 2 Solids feed: 200 grams; Temperature: ambient; Pulp density: 45% solids; Grind size, Pso 48 μηι; CaO requirement: 5.89 kg/t; silver-containing mineral. The acidic salt leach process (sample 30) also leaches substantial amount of the base metals from the silver-containing mineral. The acidic solution leaches 31% of the iron, 62% of the zinc and 57% of lead from the silver-containing mineral. It was surprising found that one or both of conducting the salt leach process at one or more of neutral and/or slightly basic pH and at ambient temperature substantially reduces level of base metals reporting to the leach solution while substantially maintaining the level silver reporting to the leach leach solution. The level of silver recovered in at a pH of about pH 7 in the salt leach process (sample 31-33) was respectively 70, 68 and 65%. Slightly less than the 74% recovered at pH 0.3. However, the level of iron, zinc and lead reporting to the leach solution respectively decreased from about 31% to about 3-7%, from about 62% to about 12-14% and from about 57% to about 7-11%. The decreased levels of base metals in the leach solution simplifies the silver recovery process, that is one or more eliminates the need to recover the one or more of base metals prior to recovering silver and recovering one or more of the base Pulp Density: 45.0% solic s; Grind size, Pso 48 μηι 100% HC1 used includes the acid in the lixiviant before the leach and the acid necessary to maintain the leach (not the acid used for re-pulping and washing). metals from the leach solution prior to sending the silver-depleted leach solution to tailings. Furthermore, leaching at a neutral and/or neutral pH substantially eliminates the environmental and health hazards of operating at low pH. Furthermore, operating at a neutral and/or nearly neutral pH eliminates the need for acid resistance piping and tanks. Conducting salt leach process at ambient temperature also reduces environmental impact and hazards of handling and disposing of a high temperature acid solution. In step 100 of Fig. 1 a valuable metal-containing material 100 is provided. The valuable metal-containing material can be any oxide, sulfide, or mixture of oxide and sulfide ores (whether oxide or sulfide dominant), concentrate, mine or mill tailings, calcine, and the like. It can include one or more valuable metals, such as silver and/or base metal(s). In some embodiments, the valuable metal-containing material 100 comprises silver and one or more base metals. For example, the valuable metal-containing material 100 typically can include at least about 25 g/t, more typically at least about 50 g/t, and even more typically at least about 75 g/t but no more than typically about 1 ,500 g/t, more typically about 1,000 g/t, and even more typically about 750 g/t silver on the one hand and at least about 0.005 wt.%, more typically at least about 0.01 wt.%, and even more typically at least about 0.1 wt.% but no more than typically about 30 wt.%, more typically about 25 wt.%, and even more typically about 15 wt.% of base metals, both individually and collectively, on the other. In some configurations, the valuable metal-containing material 100 contains from about 70 to about 110 g/t silver. Typically, the valuable metal- containing material can have from about 0.01 to about 0.7 wt.% sulfide (S2~). Commonly, more than about 50 wt.% of the silver in the valuable metal-containing material 100 is acanthite (Ag2S). More commonly, more than about 80 wt.% of the silver in the valuable metal-containing material 100 is acanthite (Ag2S). Typically, the one or more base metals comprise iron, lead, zinc, nickel, manganese, copper, chromium, and cobalt. Moreover, the valuable metal-containing material 100 can contain from about 10 to about 2 wt.% iron, from about 0.2 to about 0.5 wt.% lead and from about 0.1 to about 0.15 wt.% zinc. The manganese content of the valuable metal-containing material 100 can be from about 0.01 to about 0.6 wt.%. The copper content can be from about 0.01 to about 20 wt.%; the chromium content can be from about 0.001 to about 1.0 wt.%; and the cobalt content can be from about 0.001 to about 1.0 wt.%. In optional step 104, a crusher and/or mill can comminute the valuable metal- containing material 100. The comminuted valuable metal-containing material can have a desired particle size distribution. As will be appreciated, the particle size distribution can be dependent on the mineralogy of the valuable metal-containing material 100. Moreover, the particle size distribution is generally selected to achieve exposure of the valuable metals contained within the valuable metal-containing material mineral matrix. When the valuable metal comprises silver, the comminutation of the valuable metal-containing material exposures at least some, if not at least most, of the silver contained within the valuable metal- containing material. In some embodiments, the Pso size of the comminuted valuable metal-containing material 108 is typically no more than about 500 microns, more typically no more than about 250 microns, more typically no more than about 200 microns, and even more typically no more than about 150 microns. In step 112, the valuable metal- containing material 100 or comminuted valuable metal-containing material 108, as the case may be, is contacted in with an aqueous solution. The aqueous solution can be an aqueous lixivant solution. The aqueous solution can comprise an alkali and/or alkaline earth metal halide and an oxidant. It can be appreciated that the valuable metal- containing material 100 or comminuted valuable metal-containing material 108 is generally suspended in the aqueous solution in the form of one or more of a slurry and/or a suspension 119. The contacting of the aqueous solution with the valuable metal- containing material 100 or comminuted valuable metal-containing material 108 typically dissolves the valuable metal into the aqueous solution to form a pregnant solution and a depleted valuable metal-containing material. When the valuable metal comprises silver, the contacting of the aqueous solution with the silver contained within the valuable metal- containing material 100 or the comminuted valuable metal-containing material 108 can dissolve the silver into the pregnant leach solution and form the silver-depleted valuable metal-containing material. The alkali or alkaline earth metal halide can comprise a chloride salt such as, but not limited to, potassium chloride, sodium chloride or a mixture thereof. The oxidant can comprise molecular oxygen, ozone, a peroxygen compound (such as, but not limited to, hydrogen peroxide and perchlorate), a hypohalite (such as hypochlorite), a halogen (such as chlorine, Cl2), chlorite, chlorate, and the like. It can be appreciated that the concentrations of alkali and/or alkaline earth metal halide and the oxidant are monitored and substantially maintained within the concentration ranges described herein during the contacting of the aqueous solution with the valuable metal-containing material 100 and/or comminuted valuable metal- containing material 108. The concentrations can be adjusted by one or more of the following: adding water to the aqueous solution (typically to lower the concentration of one or more of the alkali and/or alkaline earth halide and/or the oxidant); adding oxidant to the aqueous solution; adding one or both of alkali and alkaline earth halide; or a combination thereof. The aqueous solution leaching can have a neutral, a pH value of about pH 7, or near neutral acidic pH, such as a pH value from about pH 6 to about pH 7, or a near neural basic pH, such as a pH from about pH 9 to about pH 7, during the contacting of the valuable metal- containing material with the aqueous solution. A base material, such as an alkali or alkaline earth metal oxide or hydroxide or lime, which is a mixture of carbonates, oxides, and hydroxides and/or a mineral acid, such as HC1, HBr, HI, H2SO4 or HNO3, or such, can be added to adjust the pH of the aqueous solution to a neutral or near neutral pH value. The aqueous solution contacted with the valuable metal- containing material 100 and/or comminuted valuable metal-containing material 108 typically includes at least about 25 g/L, more typically at least about 50 g/L, and even more typically at least about 100 g/L but typically no more than about 750 g/L, more typically no more than about 500 g/L, more typically no more than about 400 g/L, and even more typically no more than about 300 g/L of the alkali or alkaline earth metal halide. Moreover, the aqueous solution typically includes at least about 2.5 kg/tonne, more typically at least about 5 kg/tonne, and even more typically at least about 5.5 kg oxidant/tonne of material 100 kg/tonne but typically no more than about 250 kg/tonne, more typically no more than about 150 kg/tonne, and even more typically no more than about 100 kg oxidant/tonne of the valuable metal-containing material 100 and/or the comminuted valuable metal-containing material 108. Typically, the aqueous solution can have a solution pH from about pH 6 to about pH 10. More typically the aqueous solution has a solution pH from pH 7 to about pH 10, even more typically from about pH 7.1 to about pH 10, yet even more typically from about pH 7.1 to about pH 9, still yet more typically from about pH 7.1 to about pH 8.8, still yet more typically from about pH 7.2 to about pH 8.5, and yet still more typically from about pH 7.2 to about pH 8. To realize any of these pH ranges, from about 0.25 to about 10 kg of a base material and/or base equivalent is added per tonne of the valuable metal-containing material 100 and/or comminuted valuable metal-containing material 108. Although the aqueous solution can have any temperature during step 112, the temperature of the aqueous solution is typically at about ambient temperature. Moreover, the aqueous solution can have a temperature generally from about 30 to about 110 degrees Fahrenheit, more generally from about 40 to 100 degrees Fahrenheit, even more generally from about 45 to about 95 degrees Fahrenheit, or yet even more generally from about 50 to about 90 degrees Fahrenheit. To avoid decomposition of sulfides into sulfuric acid, the oxidation/reduction potential ("ORP", or electromotive force) of the aqueous solution is typically no more than about 550 mV or higher but no more than about 1 ,200 mV (as measured with a Pt-Ag/AgCl electrode in saturate KC1). Generally, the oxidation/reduction potential of the aqueous solution is from about 600 to about 1,150 mV, more generally from about 700 to about 1 ,100 mV, even more generally from about 800 to about 1,050 mV, yet even more generally from about 850 to about 1 ,000 mV, or even yet more generally from about 890 to about 950 mV (as measured with a Pt-Ag/AgCl electrode in saturate KC1). Compared to acidic salt leaching, a neutral and/or near neural basic pH leaching can avoid base metal removal and/or recovery; due to lower concentrations of dissolved base metal generated when leaching is conducted at the neutral and/or near neutral basic pH values. When leaching is conducted at an acidic pH value, base metals in the valuable metal- containing material can dissolve into the pregnant leach solution, thereby complicating silver recovery. For example, dissolving the valuable metal, such as silver, into the pregnant leach solution at a neutral and/or near neutral basic pH commonly dissolves no more than about 25 wt.%, more commonly no more than 20 wt.%, even more commonly no more than 15 wt.%, yet even more commonly no more than 10 wt.%, or still yet even more commonly no more than 5 wt.% of the one or more base metals, selectively or collectively into the pregnant leach solution. In some embodiments, dissolving silver into the pregnant leach solution at a neutral and/or near neutral basic pH commonly dissolves no more than about 25 wt.%, more commonly no more than 20 wt.%, even more commonly no more than 15 wt.%, yet even more commonly no more than 10 wt.%, or still yet even more commonly no more than 5 wt.% of the one or more base metals selected from the group consisting of iron, zinc and lead, selectively or collectively. While silver recoveries may be lower compared to an acidic brine leaching pH, the elimination of dissolved base metal removal can be one or more of economically more beneficial, simply the silver recovery process, or a combination thereof. It can be appreciated that, the contacting of aqueous solution with the valuable metal- containing material 100 or comminuted valuable metal-containing material 108 in step 1 12 forms one or more of a slurry and/or suspension 1 19 having a % solids pulp density. The one or more slurry and suspension % solids pulp density can depend on the application. Generally, the one or more of a slurry and/ suspension 119 can have from about 30 to about 65 % solids pulp density, more generally from 35 to 60 % solids pulp density, even more generally from about 40 to about 55 % solids pulp density, or yet even more generally from 45 to about 50 % solids pulp density. In some embodiments, the one or more of a slurry and/ suspension 119 has about 45% solids pulp density. The contacting of the aqueous solution and/or the valuable metal from the valuable metal-containing material 100 and/or the comminuted valuable metal- containing material 108 can be performed at atmospheric pressure in one or more of an agitated or stirred tank or vat reactor or a heap. In some process configurations, contacting can be performed in cascading agitated vessels fabricated from corrosion resistant material(s) to withstand chloride and/or one or more of acid and base attack. Non- limiting examples of such corrosion resistant materials include rubber- lined tanks and/or tanks constructed with fiberglass reinforced plastic materials. In some embodiments the process can include step 120, the one or more of the pregnant solution and the depleted valuable metal-containing material are subjected to solid/liquid separation. The solid/liquid separation can be effected by any suitable technique, such as filtration, hydrocycloning, decantation, gravity separation, and the like. The separation of the pregnant solution from the depleted valuable metal-containing material yields a separated pregnant solution 124 and separated metal- containing solids. The separated metal-containing solids can be sent directly to tailings or subjected to further processing to recover any remaining metals, such as any base metals contained in the separated metal-containing solids. Step 120 can also include sending the separated pregnant solution 124 to a valuable metal recovery step 128. When the valuable metal is silver, step 128 can comprise a silver metal recovery process. Silver can be recovered in step 128 from the separated pregnant solution 124 by any suitable technique know within the art to form a lean solution 132 and a silver product (not shown) for subsequent processing, such as by furnace refining, to provide a purified silver product. Examples include cementation on a medium such as iron or zinc; precipitation; adsorption and/or absorption on carbon (such as Carbon-In-Leach) or resin (such as Resin-in-Leach); electrolysis; the Merrill-Crowe process; precipitation with a water soluble sulfide, such as without limitation sodium sulfide, lithium sulfide, or ammonium sulfide; and the like. The concentration of silver in the pregnant solution can be upgraded or increased by cycling the pregnant solution to step 112 before silver recovery (not depicted), by membrane filtration (e.g., reverse osmosis, leaky reverse osmosis, nanofiltration, etc.), and by other techniques. In some embodiments, silver is cemented onto powdered iron or zinc at a pH typically ranging from about pH 0.5 to about pH 5 and more typically from about pH 1 to about pH 3. Iron or zinc reduces silver chloride. The silver cemented product is removed from the solution by thickening and filtration and washed to remove residual chloride. The cemented silver filter cake, which may contain lead sulfide, is further refined. In some embodiments, process step 120 can include contacting the separated pregnant solution 124 with a deoxidizing agent (not depicted) to remove any of the oxidant (from the aqueous solution) contained in the separated pregnant solution 124. A non-limiting example of the deoxidizing agent is a peroxide containing material, such as hydrogen peroxide. Some embodiments of process step 120 can include contacting the separated pregnant solution 124 with an alkali and/or alkaline earth salt of hydrogen sulfide (such as non-limiting examples of NaHS, LiHS, SrHS, Ca(HS)2, Mg(HS)2, and mixtures thereof). During the contacting of the separated pregnant solution 124 with the alkali and/or alkaline earth salt of hydrogen sulfide, the pH value of the separated pregnant solution 124 can be adjusted by contacted one or more of an acidic and a basic material with the separated pregnant solution 124. The contacting of the separated pregnant solution 124 with the alkali and/or alkaline earth hydrogen sulfide salt generally precipitates a silver sulfide material. The silver sulfide material typically comprises Ag2S. The silver sulfide material can be separated from solution by any solid liquid separation process, as described herein, to form a separated silver sulfide material and a filtrate. The separated silver sulfide material can be further processed to obtain elemental silver metal. The filtrate can sent to one or more of tailings, such as to one or more of step 112 and step 152 (see below). In some embodiments, the process can include step 136. In step 136, any dissolved base metals in all or part of the lean leach solution 132 are precipitated as sulfides to produce a barren leach solution 140 and precipitated base metal product (not shown). Precipitation of the base metal product can be performed by contacting the lean leach solution 132 with an alkali metal hydrosulfide typically at a pH of less than pH 7 and more typically ranging from about pH 4 to about pH 6.5. Other sulfides may be employed, such as hydrogen sulfide, ammonium sulfide, an alkali metal sulfide, or an alkaline earth metal polysulfide. The sulfide ion typically converts the water soluble and/or dissolved base metal chloride to a water insoluble base metal sulfide which generally precipitates out of the lean leach solution 132. Sufficient sulfide ion is provided to precipitate substantially all of the dissolved base metal. This concentration of sulfide ion typically ranges from about 100 to 150% of the stoichiometric amount relative to the dissolved base metal concentration. As will be appreciated, other techniques can be used to remove dissolved base metals, such as electrolysis. In optional solid/liquid separation step 144, the barren leach solution 140 can be separated from the precipitated base metal product to form a separated barren leach solution 148 and a recovered base metal product (not depicted). Solid/liquid separation can be effected by any suitable technique, such as filtration, hydrocycloning, decantation, gravity separation, and the like. In one process configuration, the barren leach solution 140 is thickened and filtered to form a filter cake that is subsequently washed. A small stream of the sulfide precipitation thickener underflow can be recycled to the precipitation circuit as seed. The separated barren leach solution 148 can be sent to an optional scrubbing step 152, while the recovered base metal product can be subjected to further processing (not depicted). In optional scrubbing step 152, the separated barren leach solution 148 can be circulated through a scrubber to scrub a plant to form an aqueous solution 156 (that is, an aqueous lixivant solution). The aqueous solution 156 is generally sent to step 112 for contacting with the valuable metal-containing material 100 or comminuted valuable metal-containing material 108, as the case may be. The processing of the separated barren leach solution 148 can produce a vent gas (not depicted). The vent gas can be processed to produce an off-gas suitable for discharge into the atmosphere (not depicted). The off-gas can be collected in one or more of the process steps discussed above and include a variety of contaminants (such as chlorine gas, sulfuric acid gas, etc.). In the scrubber, the separated barren leach solution 148 can be contacted with a base, such as an alkali metal hydroxide, to react with acid gas components. The treated leach solution 156 is recharged with fresh halide, oxidant, and/or base, as needed. The recharged, treated leach solution 156 can be sent to step 1 12. Silver is recovered in step 128 from the separated pregnant solution 124 by any suitable technique to form a lean solution 132 and a silver product (not shown) for subsequent processing, such as by furnace refining, to provide a purified silver product. Examples include cementation on a medium such as iron or zinc; precipitation; adsorption and/or absorption on carbon (such as Carbon-In-Leach) or resin (such as Resin-in-Leach); electrolysis; the Merrill-Crowe process; precipitation with a water soluble sulfide, such as sodium sulfide, lithium sulfide, or ammonium sulfide; and the like. The concentration of silver in the pregnant solution can be upgraded or increased by recycling the pregnant solution to step 1 12 before silver recovery, by membrane filtration (e.g., reverse osmosis, leaky reverse osmosis, nanoflltration, etc.), and by other techniques. EXAMPLES The following examples are provided to illustrate certain aspects, embodiments, and configurations of the disclosure and are not to be construed as limitations on the disclosure, as set forth in the appended claims. All parts and percentages are by weight unless otherwise specified. The leaches of ore compositions I and II were performed in an agitated, 2 L baffled glass resin kettle with a lid and cold water condenser. Analysis of ore compositions I and II are given in Table 4. Silver was assayed was by atomic absorption (AA) and other metals were assayed by inductively coupled plasma emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES).

Fig. 2 depicts an embodiment of the brine leaching process according to some embodiments of the present disclosure. In step 210, the valuable metal-containing material is provided and, if necessary, is crushed and/or milled to form a comminuted valuable-metal containing material 108. It can be appreciated that the valuable metal-containing material contains silver. In the crushing and/or milling process oversized rock can be broken by a manually operated pick to pass through a grizzly. The undersized rock can pass through the grizzly to a jaw crusher. The rock is crushed to a nominal size of about 190 mm. The crushed rock can be feed to semi-autogeneous grinding mill. Single coarse and fine grinding circuits are arranged to reduce the crushed rock in two stages from about 190 mm to a Pso of about 53 μηι. The first step typically includes a single semi-autogeneous grinding of the crushed rock to form a first semi-auotgeneous grind. The first semi-autogeneous grind is generally in the form of pebbles. Typically, the pebbles have a size of about 25 by 3 mm. The pebbles of the semi-autogeneous grind are typically crushed in single cone crusher to size of about 6 mm. Following the single cone crusher, the crushed pebbles are further milled in a semi- autogeneous grinding process to form a second semi-autogeneous grind having a Pso of about 3 mm. The second semi-autogeneous grind reports to a ball mill. The ball mill product is classified by a fine screen circuit. The coarse oversize material joins the ball mill feed. Screen undersize, Pso of about 53 μηι, is typically pumped to a paste thickener to increase its solids density of between 45 to 55%. The thickener underflow is of sufficient concentration to be used directly in the leach process (see step 220). The thickener overflow is re-circulated within the coarse and fine grinding circuits. A bleed can be taken to limit salt content of the aqueous solution. The ball mill provides a feed material comprising the valuable metal-containing material to leach circuit. In step 220, the feed material from the ball mill is contacted with the aqueous solution containing the alkali and/or alkaline earth metal halide and the oxidant. The contacting of the feed material from ball mill with the aqueous solution forms a pregnant leach solution and a depleted valuable metal-containing material. It can be appreciated that the pregnant leach solution comprises silver and vary little if any base metals. Moreover, the depleted valuable metal-containing material is substantially depleted of silver and is not substantially depleted of of its base metals. The pregnant leach solution and the depleted valuable metal-containing material are sent to countercurrent decantation circuit (step 230). It some embodiments, lead can be precipitated in step 220. Moreover, the precipitated lead is not sent to the countercurrent decantation circuit (step 230). The countercurrent decantation circuit is operated at about 2.5 wash ratio. Furthermore, the countercurrent decantation circuit can be thicken, wash and concentrate the depleted valuable metal- containing material. The countercurrent decantation step recovers more than about 99wt% of the valuable metal contained in pregnant leach solution as overflow. The overflow is sent to chlorine kill circuit (step 240). The underflow, concentrate the depleted valuable metal-containing material, of the countercurrent decantation circuit is thickened and filtered to recover the aqueous solution, which is returned to the step 220, and provide concentrated solutions to be sent to the tailings pond 290. In step 250, the overflow pregnant leach solution is contacted with hydrogen peroxide. The contacting of the overflow pregnant leach solution with the hydrogen peroxide typically takes place in a series of agitated, vented tanks. Moreover, the contacting of the overflow pregnant leach solution with the hydrogen peroxide decomposes at least most, if not all of the OCr to form a processed aqueous solution. The processed aqueous solution is sent to a sulfide precipitation circuit (step 260). In step 260, the processed aqueous solution is contacted and mixed with NaHS. A silver sulfide precipitate is formed by the contacting of the processed aqueous solution with the HS~precipitates at lest most, if not all, of the silver contained in the processed aqueous solution. The silver sulfide precipitate is dispersed in the processed aqueous solution, the dispersion is sent to a filter circuit (step 270). In step 270, a filter cake of silver sulfide is formed. The filter circuit can comprise a plate-and-frame filter press(es). The filter cake of silver sulfide is one or more of collected and dried. The filter cake of silver sulfide is suitable for further refining to recover the silver as silver metal. A spent brine liquid is also formed during the process of forming the filter cake of silver sulfide. The spent brine can be report to one or more of the tailing pond 290 and to the countercurrent decantation (step 230).

It would be possible to provide for some features of the disclosure without providing others. For example in one alternative embodiment, the brine leach is conducted at an acidic pH to dissolve base metals into solution. In another alternative embodiment, the brine leach is conducted at higher temperature to provide increased leaching kinetics. In another alternative embodiment, base metals are removed from a bleed stream of the barren leach solution but not from the remainder of the barren leach solution. In another alternative embodiment, the valuable metal- containing material is subjected to bio-oxidation to decompose at least most of the sulfides prior to brine leaching. Bio- oxidation requires an energy source, which is chemically reduced iron (Fe ) or chemically reduced sulfur compounds, such as sulfide. When mineral feed is provided as an energy source, Fe3+ generated by microbial oxidation of Fe2+ oxidizes the mineral sulfide (e.g., pyrite). The Fe3+ oxidation of mineral sulfide reduces the iron to Fe2+, produces sulfuric acid, and also releases Fe2+ from the mineral. The reduced iron is then re-oxidized by the microbes as the energy source.
