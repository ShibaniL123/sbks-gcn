Preparation of 2-fluoro-2-methylpropane-1,3-diol
Lithium aluminium hydride (4.50 g, 112.6 mmol) was added portion-wise to a stirred solution of dimethyl 2-fluoro-2-methyl-propanedioate (8.40 g, 51.2 mmol) in THF (205 mL) at 0° C. The reaction was warmed to room temperature and stirred under these conditions for 1 hour. The reaction mixture was then cooled to 0° C. and cautiously quenched by sequential dropwise addition of water (5.85 mL), 15 wt % aqueous NaOH (5.85 mL), and water (18 mL). The resulting gelatinous suspension was stirred rapidly for 1 hour. The precipitate was removed by filtration, and the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was dissolved in a mixture of CHCl3/IPA (3:1), dried over Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure to afford 2-fluoro-2-methylpropane-1,3-diol (3.28 g, 46%) as an orange oil. This oil was used in the next step without further purification.
