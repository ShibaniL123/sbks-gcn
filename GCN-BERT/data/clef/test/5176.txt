Technical Field This invention relates to an inorganic oxide particle having an organic coating. Specifically, the coated particles may be incorporated into a composition, such as an electroconductive composition, to improve printability and aged stability. The invention also relates to processes for preparing the coated particles. Background Solar cells are devices that convert the energy of light into electricity using the photovoltaic effect. Solar power is an attractive green energy source because it is sustainable and produces only non-polluting by-products. In operation, when light hits a solar cell, a fraction of the incident light is reflected by the surface and the remainder is transmitted into the solar cell. The photons of the transmitted light are absorbed by the solar cell, which is usually made of a semiconducting material such as silicon. The energy from the absorbed photons excites electrons of the semiconducting material from their atoms, generating electron-hole pairs. These electron-hole pairs are then separated by p-n junctions and collected by conductive electrodes which are applied on the solar cell surface. In this way, electricity may be conducted between interconnected solar cells. Solar cells typically have electroconductive compositions applied to both their front and back surfaces which, when fired, form electrodes. While any known application methods may be used, these pastes are often applied to the substrate via screen printing. A typical electroconductive composition contains metallic particles, an inorganic component and an organic vehicle. The composition of the organic vehicle may have an impact on the viscosity of the composition, thereby affecting the paste's printability, which in turn affects the performance of the solar cell. One problem associated with known paste compositions is that screen clogging often occurs during screen printing of the composition onto the substrate. Such clogging decreases the amount of paste transfer through the screen, which decreases the printed line uniformity and electrical performance of the solar cell. Another problem associated with known paste compositions is the lack of aged stability, or the ability to maintain a uniform composition over an extended period of time. Paste components sometimes have a tendency to separate out of the composition mixture when shelved for an extended period of time. As such, paste compositions with improved aged stability are desired. Accordingly, there is a need for electroconductive compositions which are more easily screen printed and which reduce screen clogging so as to improve the uniformity of the printed lines and thus improve solar cell performance. Electroconductive compositions with improved aged stability are also desired. Summary The invention provides an inorganic oxide particle having an organic coating. In one embodiment, the coated particles are incorporated into an electroconductive composition. The organic coating improves printability and aged stability of the electroconductive composition. One embodiment of the invention relates to an inorganic oxide particle having an organic coating. The invention also provides a process for preparing an organic coated inorganic oxide particle comprising forming an organic coating on the inorganic oxide particle. The invention further provides a process for preparing an organic coated inorganic oxide particle, comprising obtaining a mixture of at least one inorganic oxide particle and at least one coating agent in at least one solvent, agitating the mixture, and removing the solvent. Detailed Description The organic coated inorganic oxide particles of the invention may be useful as components in any number of applications, including, but not limited to, electroconductive compositions, resistor compositions, dielectric compositions, soldering compositions, decorative compositions, and sealing compositions. Such compositions may be used to form, for example, electric circuits, solar cells, LEDs, displays, capacitors, resistors, other known electronic components, and any combinations thereof. Inorganic Oxide Particles According to one embodiment, the inorganic oxide particles comprise particles of glass frits, ceramics, crystalline phases or compounds, a mixture of amorphous, partially crystalline, and/or crystalline phases or compounds, and/or mixtures thereof, together referred to as the inorganic reaction system (IRS). In one embodiment, the IRS comprises glass frit particles. In another embodiment, the IRS comprises at least one of particles of glass frit(s), oxides, and salts. The particles may be formed of, for example, oxides of magnesium, nickel, tellurium, tungsten, zinc, gadolinium, antimony, cerium, zirconium, titanium, manganese, lead, tin, ruthenium, silicon, cobalt, iron, copper, bismuth, boron, and chromium, or any combination of at least two thereof, compounds which can generate those metal oxides upon firing, or a mixture of at least two of the aforementioned metals, a mixture of at least two of the aforementioned oxides, a mixture of at least two of the aforementioned compounds which can generate those metal oxides on firing, or mixtures of two or more of any of the above mentioned. Other materials which may be used to form the inorganic oxide particles include, but are not limited to, germanium oxide, vanadium oxide, molybdenum oxide, niobium oxide, indium oxide, other alkaline and alkaline earth metal (e.g., potassium, rubidium, caesium, calcium, strontium, and barium) compounds, rare earth oxides (e.g., lanthanum oxide, cerium oxides), and phosphorus oxides. According to one embodiment, the inorganic particles are lead-based and may include lead oxide. In another embodiment, the inorganic component may be lead-free. The lead-free inorganic particles may be formed of any of the above-mentioned oxides or compounds. The term "lead-free" indicates that the inorganic component has less than 0.5 wt% lead, based upon 100% total weight of the glass frit. Other suitable types of glass frit particles and their preparation are disclosed in U.S. Patent Publication Nos. 2013/0269773, 2013/0269772, 2013/0270489, 2012/0270366, 2012/0138142, and 2012/0174974 and U.S. Patent No. 8,309,844. It is well known to the person skilled in the art that inorganic particles can exhibit a variety of shapes, sizes, and surface areas. Some examples of shapes include, but are not limited to, spherical, angular, elongated (rod or needle like) and flat (sheet like). Inorganic particles may also be present as a combination of particles with different shapes. One way to characterize such shapes is through the following parameters: length, width and thickness. In the context of the invention, the length of a particle is given by the length of the longest spatial displacement vector, both endpoints of which are contained within the particle. The width of a particle is given by the length of the longest spatial displacement vector perpendicular to the length vector defined above both endpoints of which are contained within the particle. The thickness of a particle is given by the length of the longest spatial displacement vector perpendicular to both the length vector and the width vector, both defined above, both endpoints of which are contained within the particle. In one embodiment, inorganic particles with shapes as uniform as possible are preferred (i.e. shapes in which the ratios relating any two of the length, the width and the thickness are as close as possible to 1; preferably at least 0.7, more preferably at least 0.8, and most preferably at least 0.9, and preferably no more than about 1.5, preferably no more than about 1.3, and most preferably no more than about 1.2). Examples of preferred shapes for the inorganic particles in this embodiment are spheres and cubes, or combinations thereof, or combinations of one or more thereof with other shapes. In another embodiment, inorganic particles are preferred which have a shape of low uniformity, preferably with at least one of the ratios relating the dimensions of length, width and thickness being above about 1.5, more preferably above about 3 and most preferably above about 5. Preferred shapes according to this embodiment are flake shaped, rod or needle shaped, or a combination of flake shaped, rod or needle shaped with other shapes. Another parameter characterizing the inorganic particles is the median particle diameter d50. The d50 is the median diameter or the medium value of the particle size distribution. It is the value of the particle diameter at 50% in the cumulative distribution. A Horiba LA-910 Laser Diffraction Particle Size Analyzer connected to a computer with the LA-910 software program is used to determine the particle size distribution of the inorganic particles. The relative refractive index of the inorganic particle is chosen from the LA-910 manual and entered into the software program. The test chamber is filled with deionized water to the proper fill line on the tank. The solution is then circulated by using the circulation and agitation functions in the software program. After one minute, the solution is drained. This is repeated an additional time to ensure the chamber is clean of any residual material. The chamber is then filled with deionized water for a third time and allowed to circulate and agitate for one minute. Any background particles in the solution are eliminated by using the blank function in the software. Ultrasonic agitation is then started, and the inorganic particles are slowly added to the solution in the test chamber until the transmittance bars are in the proper zone in the software program. Once the transmittance is at the correct level, the laser diffraction analysis is run and the particle size distribution of the glass is measured and given as d50. It is preferred that the median particle size d50 of the inorganic particles be at least about 0.1 Âµm, and preferably at least about 0.3 Âµm. At the same time, it is preferred that the d50 of the inorganic particles be no more than about 50 Âµm, more preferably no more than about 10 Âµm, more preferably no more than about 4 Âµm, and most preferably no more than about 2 Âµm. Another characteristic of inorganic particles is the specific surface area. Specific surface area is a property of solids equal to the total surface area of the material per unit mass, solid, or bulk volume, or cross sectional area. It is defined either by surface area divided by mass (with units of m2/g) or surface area divided by volume (units of m-1). The lowest value for the specific surface area of a particle is embodied by a sphere with a smooth surface. The less uniform and uneven a shape is, the higher its specific surface area will be. As set forth herein, the higher the specific surface area, the higher the risk of screen clogging. The specific surface area (surface area per unit mass) may be measured by the BET (Brunauer-Emmett-Teller) method, which is known in the art. Specifically, BET measurements are made in accordance with DIN ISO 9277:1995. A Monosorb Model MS-22 instrument (manufactured by Quantachrome Instruments), which operates according to the SMART method (Sorption Method with Adaptive dosing Rate), is used for the measurement. As a reference material, aluminum oxide (available from Quantachrome Instruments as surface area reference material Cat. No. 2003) is used. Samples are prepared for analysis in the built-in degas station. Flowing gas (30% N2 and 70% He) sweeps away impurities, resulting in a clean surface upon which adsorption may occur. The sample can be heated to a user-selectable temperature with the supplied heating mantle. Digital temperature control and display are mounted on the instrument front panel. After degassing is complete, the sample cell is transferred to the analysis station. Quick connect fittings automatically seal the sample cell during transfer, and the system is then activated to commence the analysis. A dewar flask filled with coolant is manually raised, immersing the sample cell and causing adsorption. The instrument detects when adsorption is complete (2-3 minutes), automatically lowers the dewar flask, and gently heats the sample cell back to room temperature using a built-in hot-air blower. As a result, the desorbed gas signal is displayed on a digital meter and the surface area is directly presented on a front panel display. The entire measurement (adsorption and desorption) cycle typically requires less than six minutes. The technique uses a high sensitivity, thermal conductivity detector to measure the change in concentration of an adsorbate/inert carrier gas mixture as adsorption and desorption proceed. When integrated by the on-board electronics and compared to calibration, the detector provides the volume of gas adsorbed or desorbed. For the adsorptive measurement, N2 5.0 with a molecular cross-sectional area of 0.162 nm2 at 77K is used for the calculation. A one-point analysis is performed and a built-in microprocessor ensures linearity and automatically computes the sample's BET surface area in m2/g. In one embodiment, the inorganic particles have a specific surface area of at least about 0.25 m2/g, preferably at least about 0.5 m2/g, and most preferably at least about 1 m2/g. At the same time, it is preferred that the specific surface area be no more than about 100 m2/g, preferably no more than about 20 m2/g, and most preferably no more than about 10 m2/g. Organic Coating The inorganic oxide particles are preferably coated with an organic coating. In one embodiment, the organic coating has the ability to form hydrogen bonds or an organic compound having at least one group containing a heteroatom. For example, the organic coating may be formed of an organic compound that has a moiety that will associate with the inorganic particle, such as, for example, a group containing a heteroatom (e.g., oxygen, nitrogen, sulphur, or phosphorus), a carbon-carbon double bond, or a carbon-carbon triple bond. The organic compound may be a wetting and/or dispersing agent, such as a dispersant having an acid functional group. Suitable organic compounds include, but are not limited to, amines, fatty acids (such as saturated fatty acids including C8-C24 saturated fatty acids (e.g., stearic acid) and unsaturated fatty acids including unsaturated C8-C24 fatty acids (e.g., oleic acid)), copolymers with acidic groups, acrylic acids, phosphoric acid esters, polymer salts having an acid group, carboxylic acid esters having a hydroxyl group, fatty amides, carboxylic acids, phosphonic acids, organic acid anhydrides, acrylic copolymers, phosphates of a copolymer, alkyl ammonium salts of a block copolymer, modified acrylic block copolymers and their salts, and any combination thereof. Suitable phosphoric acid esters include, but are not limited to, a phosphoric acid ester of the formula (OH)3-n-P(=O)-(O-R)n where the ester group R is an aliphatic, cycloaliphatic and/or aromatic moiety having no Zerewitinoff hydrogen, containing at least one ether oxygen atom (-O-) and at least one carboxylic acid ester group (-COO-) and/or urethane group (-NCOO-), and having an average molecular weight Mn of 200 to 10,000, where the hydrogen atoms may be partially replaced by halogens and the ratio of the number of ether oxygen atoms to the number of carboxy acid ester groups and/or urethane groups in the molecule (or in every group R) is in the range from 1:20 to 20:1, and n represents 1 or 2. Such suitable phosphoric acid esters are described in U.S. Patent No. 5,130,463. One preferred organic compound is DISPERBYK-110 commercially available from BYK Additives & Instrument of Louisville, KY. In another preferred embodiment, the organic coating is an acrylic acid. In another embodiment, the organic coating is hydrophobic. Process of Coating Inorganic Oxide Particles To prepare the inorganic oxide particles, the desired coating material (coating agent) is used to form an organic coating on the particles. In one embodiment, at least one coating agent is combined with at least one solvent and the inorganic particles. Any solvent known in the art may be used, including, but not limited to, water, alcohols, ketones, ethers, esters, amides, amines, carboxylic acids, hydrocarbons, and any combination of at least two thereof. This mixture is then agitated so as to sufficiently coat the inorganic particles with the coating (e.g., 15 minutes). The agitation may be performed using a stirred vessel, ball mill or media mill at a temperature of at least about 5Â°C. At the same time, the agitation preferably occurs at a temperature of no more than about 120Â°C. The mixture is then poured onto a tray such that the solvent component may be removed from the mixture. In one embodiment, the mixture is dried at a temperature of at least about 25Â°C so as to evaporate the excess solvent component. At the same time, the mixture is preferably dried at a temperature of no more than about 200Â°C. To determine the amount of organic coating on the inorganic oxide particles, the amount of heteroatoms per unit specific surface area of the inorganic oxide particle is calculated. To determine the amount of heteroatoms, which is provided in units of parts per million on a weight basis (ppm), a means for analyzing the heteroatoms, such as LECO analysis, is utilized. The specific surface area of the inorganic particle in m2/g is determined as set forth above. Preferably, the amount of heteroatoms per unit specific surface area of the inorganic oxide particle is at least 10 ppm/(m2/g), preferably at least 50 ppm (m2/g), and most preferably at least 100 ppm/(m2/g). Electroconductive Composition In one embodiment, the organic coated inorganic oxide particles may be incorporated into an electroconductive composition used to form electrodes on a solar cell. The electrodes provide the path by which conductivity occurs between solar cells. An electroconductive composition preferably includes conductive metallic particles, the coated inorganic particles of the invention, and an organic vehicle. The inorganic component of the electroconductive composition acts as an adhesion media, facilitating bonding between the conductive metallic particles and the silicon substrate, thereby providing reliable electrical contact. Specifically, the inorganic component etches through the surface layers (e.g., antireflective layer) of the silicon substrate, such that effective electrical contact can be made between the electroconductive composition and the silicon wafer. Coarse particles or agglomerates of the inorganic component may have a detrimental effect on printability as they tend to increase the occurrence of screen clogging (clogging of the openings of the screen used during printing). Inorganic particles typically have high specific surface areas (as compared to other particles used in the paste), and therefore require a significant amount of organic vehicle to provide adequate wetting of the particles. Improperly wetted particles may result in screen clogging. When clogging occurs, the paste does not transfer through the screen, printed lines become less uniform, and solar cell efficiency decreases. The electroconductive compositions of the invention have good printability and form uniform, or substantially uniform, printed lines. The printability of an electroconductive composition is determined by a number of variables, as set forth more fully herein, and generally refers to the ability of the composition to be screen printed to form uniform lines. One way to characterize the uniformity of a printed line is by its line definition, which can be determined by calculating the aspect ratio (ratio between height and width) of the printed line. The higher the aspect ratio, the better the line uniformity. Without being bound by any particular theory, the organic coating on the inorganic oxide particles is believed to improve the dispersibility of the inorganic particles in the organic vehicle, thus stabilizing the inorganic particles in the paste so as to reduce the occurrence of clogging and improve printability. According to a preferred embodiment, the inorganic oxide particles used in the electroconductive composition are glass frits. Preferred glass frits are particles of amorphous or partially crystalline solids which exhibit a glass transition. Suitable glass frit materials are set forth more fully herein. The glass transition temperature (Tg) is the temperature at which an amorphous substance transforms from a rigid solid to a partially mobile undercooled melt upon heating. The glass transition temperature Tg may be determined using a DSC apparatus SDT Q600 (commercially available from TA Instruments) which simultaneously records differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) curves. The instrument is equipped with a horizontal balance and furnace with a platinum/platinum-rhodium (type R) thermocouple. The sample holders used are aluminum oxide ceramic crucibles with a capacity of about 40-90 Âµl. For the measurements and data evaluation, the measurement software Q Advantage; Thermal Advantage Release 5.4.0 and Universal Analysis 2000, version 4.5A Build 4.5.0.5 is applied respectively. As pan for reference and sample, aluminum oxide pan having a volume of about 85 Âµl is used. An amount of about 10-50 mg of the sample is weighted into the sample pan with an accuracy of 0.01 mg. The empty reference pan and the sample pan are placed in the apparatus, the oven is closed and the measurement started. A heating rate of 10 K/min is employed from a starting temperature of 25 Â°C to an end temperature of 1000 Â°C. The balance in the instrument is always purged with nitrogen (N2 5.0) and the oven is purged with synthetic air (80% N2 and 20% O2 from Linde) with a flow rate of 50 ml/min. The first step in the DSC signal is evaluated as glass transition using the software described above, and the determined onset value is taken as the temperature for Tg. Preferably, the Tg of the glass frit is below the desired firing temperature of the electroconductive composition. According to the invention, preferred glass frits have a Tg of at least about 200Â°C, and preferably at least about 250Â°C. At the same time, preferred glass frits have a Tg of no more than about 700Â°C, preferably no more than about 650Â°C, and most preferably no more than about 500Â°C. According to one embodiment, the electroconductive composition includes at least about 0.1 wt% inorganic component, preferably at least about 0.5 wt%, and most preferably at least about 0.8 wt%, based upon 100% total weight of the composition. At the same time, the paste preferably includes no more than about 15 wt% inorganic component, preferably no more than about 10 wt%, and most preferably no more than about 5 wt%, based upon 100% total weight of the composition.

At the same time, the organic coating is preferably no more than about 10 wt%, preferably no more than about 7 wt%, and most preferably no more than about 4 wt%, based upon 100% total weight of the composition.

A preferred combination comprising fatty acids in this context is castor oil. Where present, such additives are preferably no more than about 15 wt%, based upon 100% total weight of the organic vehicle. The viscosity of the electroconductive composition typically has an effect on the printability of the composition. If the viscosity is too high, the paste may not transfer well through the screen mesh and clogging may occur. If the viscosity is too low, the paste may be too fluid, causing the printing lines to spread and the aspect ratio to decrease. The viscosity may be measured using a BrookfieldÂ® DV-III HBT Ultra Programmable rheometer at a suitable speed. Specifically, the sample is measured in a 6R utility cup using a SC4-14 spindle, and the measurement is taken after one minute at 1 RPM.

Such steps are useful in forming an electric device such as those described herein. Solar Cells The invention also relates to a solar cell. In one embodiment, the solar cell comprises a semiconductor substrate (e.g., a silicon wafer) and an electroconductive composition according to any of the embodiments described herein. In another aspect, the invention relates to a solar cell prepared by a process which includes applying an electroconductive composition according to any of the embodiments described herein to a semiconductor substrate (e.g., a silicon wafer) and firing the semiconductor substrate. Silicon Wafer Preferred wafers according to the invention have regions, among other regions of the solar cell, capable of absorbing light with high efficiency to yield electron-hole pairs and separating holes and electrons across a boundary with high efficiency, preferably across a p-n junction boundary. Preferred wafers according to the invention are those comprising a single body made up of a front doped layer and a back doped layer. Preferably, the wafer comprises appropriately doped tetravalent elements, binary compounds, tertiary compounds or alloys. Preferred tetravalent elements in this context include, but are not limited to, silicon, germanium, or tin, preferably silicon. Preferred binary compounds include, but are not limited to, combinations of two or more tetravalent elements, binary compounds of a group III element with a group V element, binary compounds of a group II element with a group VI element or binary compounds of a group IV element with a group VI element. Preferred combinations of tetravalent elements include, but are not limited to, combinations of two or more elements selected from silicon, germanium, tin or carbon, preferably SiC. The preferred binary compounds of a group III element with a group V element is GaAs. According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the wafer is silicon. The foregoing description, in which silicon is explicitly mentioned, also applies to other wafer compositions described herein. The p-n junction boundary is located where the front doped layer and back doped layer of the wafer meet. In an n-type solar cell, the back doped layer is doped with an electron donating n-type dopant and the front doped layer is doped with an electron accepting or hole donating p-type dopant. In a p-type solar cell, the back doped layer is doped with p-type dopant and the front doped layer is doped with n-type dopant. According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, a wafer with a p-n junction boundary is prepared by first providing a doped silicon substrate and then applying a doped layer of the opposite type to one face of that substrate. The doped silicon substrate can be prepared by any method known in the art and considered suitable for the invention. Preferred sources of silicon substrates according to the invention include, but are not limited to, mono-crystalline silicon, multi-crystalline silicon, amorphous silicon and upgraded metallurgical silicon, most preferably mono-crystalline silicon or multi-crystalline silicon. Doping to form the doped silicon substrate can be carried out simultaneously by adding the dopant during the preparation of the silicon substrate, or it can be carried out in a subsequent step. Doping subsequent to the preparation of the silicon substrate can be carried out by gas diffusion epitaxy, for example. Doped silicon substrates are also readily commercially available. According to one embodiment, the initial doping of the silicon substrate may be carried out simultaneously to its formation by adding dopant to the silicon mix. According to another embodiment, the application of the front doped layer and the highly doped back layer, if present, may be carried out by gas-phase epitaxy. This gas phase epitaxy is preferably carried out at a temperature of at least about 500 Â°C, preferably at least about 600Â°C, and most preferably at least about 650Â°C. At the same time, the temperature is preferably no more than about 900Â°C, preferably no more than about 800Â°C, and most preferably no more than about 750Â°C. The gas phase epitaxy is preferably carried out at a pressure of at least about 2 kPa, preferably at least about 10 kPa, and most preferably at least about 40 kPa. At the same, the pressure is preferably no more than about 100 kPa, preferably no more than about 80 kPa, and most preferably no more than about 70 kPa. It is known in the art that silicon substrates can exhibit a number of shapes, surface textures and sizes. The shape of the substrate may include cuboid, disc, wafer and irregular polyhedron, to name a few. According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the wafer is a cuboid with two dimensions which are similar, preferably equal, and a third dimension which is significantly smaller than the other two dimensions. The third dimension may be at least 100 times smaller than the first two dimensions. Further, silicon substrates with rough surfaces are preferred. One way to assess the roughness of the substrate is to evaluate the surface roughness parameter for a sub-surface of the substrate, which is small in comparison to the total surface area of the substrate, preferably less than about one hundredth of the total surface area, and which is essentially planar. The value of the surface roughness parameter is given by the ratio of the area of the sub-surface to the area of a theoretical surface formed by projecting that sub-surface onto the flat plane best fitted to the sub-surface by minimizing mean square displacement. A higher value of the surface roughness parameter indicates a rougher, more irregular surface and a lower value of the surface roughness parameter indicates a smoother, more even surface. According to the invention, the surface roughness of the silicon substrate is preferably modified so as to produce an optimum balance between a number of factors including, but not limited to, light absorption and adhesion to the surface. The two larger dimensions of the silicon substrate can be varied to suit the application required of the resultant solar cell. It is preferred according to the invention for the thickness of the silicon wafer to be below about 0.5 mm, more preferably below about 0.3 mm, and most preferably below about 0.2 mm. Some wafers have a minimum thickness of 0.01 mm or more. It is preferred that the front doped layer be thin in comparison to the back doped layer. It is also preferred that the front doped layer have a thickness of at least about 0.1 Âµm, and preferably no more than about 10 Âµm, preferably no more than about 5 Âµm, and most preferably no more than about 2 Âµm. A highly doped layer can be applied to the back face of the silicon substrate between the back doped layer and any further layers. Such a highly doped layer is of the same doping type as the back doped layer and such a layer is commonly denoted with a + (n+-type layers are applied to n-type back doped layers and p+-type layers are applied to p-type back doped layers). This highly doped back layer serves to assist metallization and improve electroconductive properties. It is preferred according to the invention for the highly doped back layer, if present, to have a thickness of at least 1 Âµm, and preferably no more than about 100 Âµm, preferably no more than about 50 Âµm and most preferably no more than about 15 Âµm. Dopants Preferred dopants are those which, when added to the silicon wafer, form a p-n junction boundary by introducing electrons or holes into the band structure. It is preferred that the identity and concentration of these dopants is specifically selected so as to tune the band structure profile of the p-n junction and set the light absorption and conductivity profiles as required. Preferred p-type dopants include, but are not limited to, those which add holes to the silicon wafer band structure. All dopants known in the art and which are considered suitable in the context of the invention can be employed as p-type dopants. Preferred p-type dopants include, but are not limited to, trivalent elements, particularly those of group 13 of the periodic table. Preferred group 13 elements of the periodic table in this context include, but are not limited to, boron, aluminum, gallium, indium, thallium, or a combination of at least two thereof, wherein boron is particularly preferred. Preferred n-type dopants are those which add electrons to the silicon wafer band structure. Preferred n-type dopants are elements of group 15 of the periodic table. Preferred group 15 elements of the periodic table in this context include, but are not limited to, nitrogen, phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, bismuth or a combination of at least two thereof, wherein phosphorus is particularly preferred. As described above, the various doping levels of the p-n junction can be varied so as to tune the desired properties of the resulting solar cell. Doping levels are measured using secondary ion mass spectroscopy. According to certain embodiments, the semiconductor substrate (i.e., silicon wafer) exhibits a sheet resistance above about 60 Î©/â¡, such as above about 65 Î©/â¡, 70 Î©/â¡, 90 Î©/â¡ or 100 Î©/â¡. For measuring the sheet resistance of a doped silicon wafer surface, the device "GP4-Test Pro" equipped with software package "GP-4 Test 1.6.6 Pro" (available from GP Solar GmbH) is used. For the measurement, the four point measuring principle is applied. The two outer probes apply a constant current and two inner probes measure the voltage. The sheet resistance is deduced using the Ohmic law in Î©/â¡. To determine the average sheet resistance, the measurement is performed on 25 equally distributed spots of the wafer. In an air conditioned room with a temperature of 22 Â± 1 Â°C, all equipment and materials are equilibrated before the measurement. To perform the measurement, the "GP-Test.Pro" is equipped with a 4-point measuring head (Part Number 04.01.0018) with sharp tips in order to penetrate the anti-reflection and/or passivation layers. A current of 10 mA is applied. The measuring head is brought into contact with the non metalized wafer material and the measurement is started. After measuring 25 equally distributed spots on the wafer, the average sheet resistance is calculated in Î©/â¡. Solar Cell Structure A contribution to achieving at least one of the above described objects is made by a solar cell obtainable from a process according to the invention. Preferred solar cells according to the invention are those which have a high efficiency, in terms of proportion of total energy of incident light converted into electrical energy output, and those which are light and durable. At a minimum, a solar cell includes: (i) front electrodes, (ii) a front doped layer, (iii) a p-n junction boundary, (iv) a back doped layer, and (v) soldering pads. The solar cell may also include additional layers for chemical/mechanical protection. Antireflective Layer According to the invention, an antireflective layer may be applied as the outer layer before the electrode is applied to the front face of the solar cell. All antireflective layers known in the art and which are considered to be suitable in the context of the invention can be employed. Preferred antireflective layers are those which decrease the proportion of incident light reflected by the front face and increase the proportion of incident light crossing the front face to be absorbed by the wafer. Antireflective layers which give rise to a favorable absorption/reflection ratio, are susceptible to etching by the electroconductive composition, are otherwise resistant to the temperatures required for firing of the electroconductive composition, and do not contribute to increased recombination of electrons and holes in the vicinity of the electrode interface, are preferred. Preferred antireflective layers include, but are not limited to, SiNx, SiO2, Al2O3, TiO2 or mixtures of at least two thereof and/or combinations of at least two layers thereof. According to a preferred embodiment, the antireflective layer is SiNx, in particular where a silicon wafer is employed. The thickness of antireflective layers is suited to the wavelength of the appropriate light. According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the antireflective layers have a thickness of at least 20 nm, preferably at least 40 nm, and most preferably at least 60 nm. At the same time, the thickness is preferably no more than about 300 nm, more preferably no more than about 200 nm, and most preferably no more than about 90 nm. Passivation Layers One or more passivation layers may be applied to the front and/or back side of the silicon wafer as an outer layer. The passivation layer(s) may be applied before the front electrode is formed, or before the antireflective layer is applied (if one is present). Preferred passivation layers are those which reduce the rate of electron/hole recombination in the vicinity of the electrode interface. Any passivation layer which is known in the art and which is considered to be suitable in the context of the invention can be employed. Preferred passivation layers according to the invention include, but are not limited to, silicon nitride, silicon dioxide and titanium dioxide. According to a more preferred embodiment, silicon nitride is used. It is preferred for the passivation layer to have a thickness of at least 0.1 nm, preferably at least 10 nm, and most preferably at least 30 nm. As the same time, the thickness is preferably no more than about 2 Âµm, preferably no more than about 1 Âµm, and most preferably no more than about 200 nm. Additional Protective Layers In addition to the layers described above, further layers can be added for mechanical and chemical protection. The cell can be encapsulated to provide chemical protection. According to a preferred embodiment, transparent polymers, often referred to as transparent thermoplastic resins, are used as the encapsulation material, if such an encapsulation is present. Preferred transparent polymers in this context are silicon rubber and polyethylene vinyl acetate (PVA). A transparent glass sheet may also be added to the front of the solar cell to provide mechanical protection to the front face of the cell. A back protecting material may be added to the back face of the solar cell to provide mechanical protection. Preferred back protecting materials are those having good mechanical properties and weather resistance. The preferred back protection material according to the invention is polyethylene terephthalate with a layer of polyvinyl fluoride. It is preferred for the back protecting material to be present underneath the encapsulation layer (in the event that both a back protection layer and encapsulation are present). A frame material can be added to the outside of the solar cell to give mechanical support. Frame materials are well known in the art and any frame material considered suitable in the context of the invention may be employed. The preferred frame material according to the invention is aluminum. Method of Preparing a Solar Cell A solar cell may be prepared by applying the electroconductive composition of the invention to an antireflection coating, such as silicon nitride, silicon oxide, titanium oxide or aluminum oxide, on the front side of a semiconductor substrate, such as a silicon wafer. A backside electroconductive composition is then applied to the backside of the solar cell to form soldering pads. An aluminum paste is then applied to the backside of the substrate, overlapping the edges of the soldering pads formed from the backside electroconductive composition, to form the BSF. The electroconductive compositions may be applied in any manner known in the art and considered suitable in the context of the invention. Examples include, but are not limited to, impregnation, dipping, pouring, dripping on, injection, spraying, knife coating, curtain coating, brushing, screen printing, printing, or a combination of at least two thereof. Preferred printing techniques are ink-jet printing, screen printing, tampon printing, offset printing, relief printing or stencil printing or a combination of at least two thereof. It is preferred according to the invention that the electroconductive composition is applied by printing, preferably by screen printing. Specifically, the screens preferably have mesh opening with a diameter of at least about 10 Âµm, preferably at least about 20 Âµm. At the same time, the screens preferably have a mesh opening of no more than about 80 Âµm, preferably no more than about 60 Âµm, and most preferably no more than about 50 Âµm. The substrate is then fired according to an appropriate profile. Firing is necessary to sinter the printed electroconductive composition so as to form solid electrodes. Firing is well known in the art and can be effected in any manner considered suitable in the context of the invention. It is preferred that firing be carried out above the Tg of the glass frit materials. According to the invention, the maximum temperature set for firing is below about 900Â°C, preferably below about 860Â°C. Firing temperatures as low as about 770Â°C have been employed for obtaining solar cells. Firing temperatures should also allow for effective sintering of the metallic particles to be achieved. The firing temperature profile is typically set so as to enable the burnout of organic materials from the electroconductive composition. The firing step is typically carried out in air or in an oxygen-containing atmosphere in a belt furnace. It is preferred for firing to be carried out in a fast firing process with a total firing time of at least 30 seconds, and preferably at least 40 seconds. At the same time, the firing time is preferably no more than about 3 minutes, more preferably no more than about 2 minutes, and most preferably no more than about 1 minute. The time above 600Â°C is most preferably in a range from about 3 to 7 seconds. The substrate may reach a peak temperature in the range of about 700 to 900Â°C for a period of about 1 to 5 seconds. The firing may also be conducted at high transport rates, for example, about 100-700 cm/min, with resulting hold-up times of about 0.5 to 3 minutes. Multiple temperature zones, for example 3-12 zones, can be used to control the desired thermal profile. Firing of electroconductive compositions on the front and back faces can be carried out simultaneously or sequentially. Simultaneous firing is appropriate if the electroconductive compositions applied to both faces have similar, preferably identical, optimum firing conditions. Where appropriate, it is preferred for firing to be carried out simultaneously. Where firing is carried out sequentially, it is preferable for the back electroconductive composition to be applied and fired first, followed by application and firing of the electroconductive composition to the front face of the substrate. Measuring Properties of Electroconductive Composition The sample solar cell is characterized using a commercial IV-tester "cetisPV-CTL1" from Halm Elektronik GmbH. All parts of the measurement equipment as well as the solar cell to be tested were maintained at 25Â°C during electrical measurement. This temperature should be measured simultaneously on the cell surface during the actual measurement by a temperature probe. The Xe Arc lamp simulates the sunlight with a known AM1.5 intensity of 1000 W/m2 on the cell surface. To bring the simulator to this intensity, the lamp is flashed several times within a short period of time until it reaches a stable level monitored by the "PVCTControl 4.313.0" software of the IV-tester. The Halm IV tester uses a multi-point contact method to measure current (I) and voltage (V) to determine the solar cell's IV-curve. To do so, the solar cell is placed between the multi-point contact probes in such a way that the probe fingers are in contact with the bus bars (i.e., printed lines) of the solar cell. The numbers of contact probe lines are adjusted to the number of bus bars on the cell surface. All electrical values were determined directly from this curve automatically by the implemented software package. As a reference standard, a calibrated solar cell from ISE Freiburg consisting of the same area dimensions, same wafer material, and processed using the same front side layout, was tested and the data was compared to the certificated values. At least five wafers processed in the very same way were measured and the data was interpreted by calculating the average of each value. The software PVCTControl 4.313.0 provides values for efficiency, fill factor, short circuit current, series resistance and open circuit voltage. Solar Cell Module A plurality of solar cells according to the invention can be arranged spatially and electrically connected to form a collective arrangement called a module. Preferred modules according to the invention can have a number of arrangements, preferably a rectangular arrangement known as a solar panel. A large variety of ways to electrically connect solar cells, as well as a large variety of ways to mechanically arrange and fix such cells to form collective arrangements, are well known in the art. Preferred methods according to the invention are those which result in a low mass to power output ratio, low volume to power output ration, and high durability. Aluminum is the preferred material for mechanical fixing of solar cells according to the invention. In one embodiment, multiple solar cells are connected in series and/or in parallel and the ends of the electrodes of the first cell and the last cell are preferably connected to output wiring. The solar cells are typically encapsulated in a transparent thermal plastic resin, such as silicon rubber or ethylene vinyl acetate. A transparent sheet of glass is placed on the front surface of the encapsulating transparent thermal plastic resin. A back protecting material, for example, a sheet of polyethylene terephthalate coated with a film of polyvinyl fluoride, is placed under the encapsulating thermal plastic resin. These layered materials may be heated in an appropriate vacuum furnace to remove air, and then integrated into one body by heating and pressing. Furthermore, since solar cells are typically left in the open air for a long time, it is desirable to cover the circumference of the solar cell with a frame material consisting of aluminum or the like. The invention will now be described in conjunction with the following, non-limiting examples. Example 1 A set of exemplary coated inorganic particles were prepared. A leaded glass frit having a specific surface area of about 4 m2/g was first coated with various organic coatings. A first glass (G1) was coated with 1.5% oleic acid in 30 grams isopropanol acid (IPA); a second glass (G2) was coated with 1.5% oleic acid as ammonium oleate in 30 grams of a mixture of 33% IPA/67% deionized water; and a third glass (G3) was coated with 2% DisperbykÂ®-110 in 30 grams of IPA, commercially available from BYK Additives & Instrument of Louisville, KY. All percentages are based upon wt% of the electroconductive paste composition. Each of the coating mixtures was first prepared by mixing the above-referenced coating materials in the above-referenced solvents. About 16 grams of the leaded glass frit was then added to the coating mixture and mixed for about 15 minutes. The entire mixture was then poured onto a tray and dried at about 50Â°C to evaporate the solvent. Exemplary electroconductive pastes were then prepared by mixing each of the coated glass frits, silver particles, and organic vehicle. Control pastes were prepared with uncoated glass frits. Two different organic vehicles were used to test the coating compatibility with different vehicle components. Vehicle 1 comprised about 84.4% solvent, 3.4% resin, and 12.2% additives. Vehicle 2 comprised 73.5% solvent, 4.2% resin, and 22.3% additives. Vehicle 2 comprised about 73.5% of a different solvent blend from Vehicle 1, about 4.2% resin, and about 22.3% additives (which also differ from Vehicle 1). The compositions of each exemplary paste and control paste are set forth in Table 1 below, with all percentages given in wt% of the paste composition. Table 1. Exemplary Paste Compositions having Organic Coated Glass FritsControl 1Control 2P1P2P3P4Silver89.489.289.489.289.489.2Uncoated Glass1.71.7----G1--1.7--G2--1.7--G3----1.71.7Vehicle 18.9-8.9-8.9-Vehicle 2-9.1-9.1-9.1 The mixture was then milled using a three-roll mill until it became a dispersed uniform paste. The viscosity of each exemplary and control paste was then measured according to the parameters set forth herein. The results are set forth in Table 2 below. Each exemplary paste and control paste was then screen printed onto multicrystalline silicon wafers having a sheet resistance of 90 Î©/â¡ at a speed of 150 mm/s, using screen 325 (mesh) * 0.9 (mil, wire diameter) * 0.6 (mil, emulsion thickness) * 40 Âµm (finger line opening) (Calendar screen). The pastes were screen printed to form three busbars and 85 finger lines on the surface of the silicon wafer. Each paste was flooded on mylar, and then four wafers were printed. A total of 30 flood cycles were run on mylar, four more wafers were printed, and then flood was assessed by slowing the print speed to 50 mm/s and printing on mylar. This last flood step was performed to assess the ability of the paste to flood under severe conditions. The printed wafers were then dried at about 150Â°C and fired at a profile with a peak temperature at about 770Â°C for a few seconds in a linear multi-zone infrared furnace. The printed lines were then photographed and measured for analysis. As set forth in Table 2 below, the height and width of each finger line was measured along its length using a Zeta-200 Optical Profiler, manufactured by Zeta Instruments of San Jose, California. The aspect ratio was also calculated by dividing the average height by the average width of the lines. As set forth herein, the higher the aspect ratio, the better the electrical performance of the printed line. The flood and transfer performance was visually inspected and rated accordingly. An indication of "full flood" means that 100% of the screen pattern was covered with paste after the flood cycle. A partial flood (e.g., 50%) means that 50% of the screen pattern was covered with paste after the flood cycle. Such values are determined by visual inspection. As set forth in the table below, the sufficiency of the transfer is provided in terms of the following scale: "+" denotes fair transfer; "++" denotes average transfer; "+++" denotes above average transfer; and "++++" denotes well above average transfer. The number of line breaks and low spots in the line (before and after the flood cycle) were counted by visually inspecting the printed line using electroluminescent (EL) imaging. Specifically, when viewing the printed line using EL imaging, complete line breaks appear as black streaks on the image, while low spots (incomplete paste transfer) appear as gray streaks. The exemplary pastes containing coated glass G3 (P3, P4) exhibited improved aspect ratio and transfer. Further, printed lines formed with these pastes had the least amount of low spots before and after the flood cycle. Pastes printed with coated glasses G1 and G2 also had a lesser amount of low spots as compared to the control pastes. Example 2 Exemplary pastes P3 and P4, as well as Control 1 and Control 2, were reevaluated after 14 days aging to ascertain the stability of the exemplary pastes. The printing performance was evaluated according to the same parameters of Example 1. The viscosity measurements were taken initially at the time of preparing the paste, and then after 14 days of aging. The results are set forth in Table 4 below. The electrical performance of solar cells printed with these pastes was also evaluated according to the parameters set forth herein. The software PVCTControl 4.260.0 provides values for efficiency (Eff, %), fill factor (FF, %), short circuit current (Isc, mA/cm2), series resistance under three standard lighting intensities (Rs3, mÎ©), and open circuit voltage (Voc, V). The results are set forth in Table 5 below. Table 5.

As such, the presence of the coated glass had no detrimental effect on the electrical performance of the paste. Example 3 Another exemplary paste (P5), as well as a control paste (Control 3), was prepared according to the parameters set forth in Example 1. Paste P5 contained the same glass coating glass G3 (2% DisperbykÂ®-110 in IPA). In this example, about 0.18 grams of the coating was mixed with about 17 grams IPA. To this, about 9 grams of leaded glass frit was added and the combination was mixed for about 15 minutes. The contents were then poured onto a try and dried at about 50Â°C to evaporate the solvent. The exemplary and control paste contained Vehicle 1 from Example 1. The compositions of each paste are set forth in Table 6 below. Table 6. Exemplary Paste Compositions having DisperbykÂ®-110 Coated Glass FritsControl 3P5Silver89.489.4Uncoated Glass1.7--G3--1.7Vehicle 18.98.9 The viscosity of the exemplary and control pastes was then measured according to the parameters set forth herein. The results are set forth in Table 7 below. The exemplary and control paste were then screen printed onto multicrystalline silicon wafers having a sheet resistance of 90 Î©/â¡ with a more vigorous print method than that of Example 1. The pastes were printed at a speed of 200 mm/s, using screen 325 (mesh) * 0.9 (mil, wire diameter) * 0.6 (mil, emulsion thickness) * 40 Âµm (finger line opening) (Calendar screen). The pastes were screen printed in a pattern which formed three busbars and 85 finger lines on the surface of the silicon wafer. After ten flood cycles, each paste was printed onto two wafers, one at about 75 Newtons and the other at about 85 Newtons of force for each paste. The paste was then removed, a blank screen was installed, the paste was loaded, and the paste was cycled for 300 flood cycles, moving the paste back every 20 flood cycles. The paste was then removed, the screen was reinstalled, and two wafers were printed. The paste was allowed to sit on the screen with the pattern flooded for 15 minutes and two wafers were then printed. The paste was again allowed to sit on the screen with the pattern flooded for an additional 30 minutes and two wafers were then printed. This rigorous screen printing experiment assesses paste stability. The printed wafers were then dried at about 150Â°C and fired at a profile with a peak temperature at about 800Â°C for a few seconds in a linear multi-zone infrared furnace. The printed lines were then photographed and measured for analysis according to the parameters in Example 1. The results are set forth in Table 7 below. Exemplary paste P5 exhibited excellent transfer after 300 flood cycles, as well as after the 15 minute stand and the 30 minute stand. The printed line had no line breaks and less low spots than the control paste. The electrical performance of solar cells printed with the exemplary and control pastes was also evaluated according to the parameters set forth in Example 2. The results are set forth in Table 8 below. Table 8.

As such, the presence of the coated glass had no detrimental effect on the electrical performance of the paste. Example 4 Another set of exemplary pastes may be prepared with the glasses set forth in Table 9 below according to the parameters set forth in Example 3. All values in Table 9 are expressed as mol% of the glass composition. In this example, the glass frits may be coated with about 2% DisperbykÂ®-110 in IPA, available from BYK Additives & Instrument of Louisville, KY. The glass frit particles may be coated with the organic coating according to the parameters set forth in Example 3. Exemplary electroconductive pastes may then prepared by mixing each of the coated glass frits, silver particles, and organic vehicle (Vehicle 1), as set forth in Table 10 below, according to the parameters of Example 3.
