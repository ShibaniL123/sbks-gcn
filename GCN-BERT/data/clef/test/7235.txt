Example 15. Preparation of PAG-5
A 100 mL flask was charged with 1,1-difluoro-2-oxo-2-(phenylamino)ethane-1-sulfonyl fluoride (SM-1) (1.22 g, 4.80 mmol, 1.0 eq.), 2-Hydroxy-2'-methoxyacetophenone (SM-7) (0.80 g, 4.80 mmol, 1.0 eq.) and THF (24 mL) under nitrogen stream and the mixture was stirred for 5 minutes at −30° C. n-BuLi (1.6 M, 3.0 mL, 4.80 mmol, 1.0 eq.) was added dropwise to the mixture over 5 minutes. The mixture was stirred for 3 hours at −30° C. to 10° C. 1N HCl (24 mL) was added to the final reaction mixture and then AcOEt (72 mL) was added. The upper layer was separated and washed with 1N HCl (24 mL), saturated aqueous NaHCO3 (24 mL) and brine (24 mL). The solution was subsequently dried over anhydrous MgSO4 and filtered. Solvents were removed in an evaporator and then hexane (100 mL) was added to the residue and the mixture was stirred for 45 minute at 40° C. and then the hexane was removed by decantation. This procedure was repeated two more times. CH2Cl2 (100 mL) was added to the remaining material and the sodium salt separated was removed by filtration and the filtrate was concentrated in an evaporator. This crude product was purified by recrystallization (hexane/CHCl3, 50° C. to 0° C.) to obtain the target PAG as white solid (0.63 g) in 32.6% yield.
