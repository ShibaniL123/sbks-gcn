The present invention relates to a drill sleeve for a dental drill and to a set or template comprising the drill sleeve. In dental treatment, it is well known to replace a missing tooth by an endosseous dental implant with an artificial crown. Typically, screw-shaped dental implants are used, such as the ones described by Branemark in WO 97/49351. In order to anchor the implant in a patient's jaw-bone, a suitable drill hole is applied to the bone and the dental implant is fixed therein. When the drill hole is applied to the jaw-bone, it is very important that the position, depth, width, and orientation of the drill hole are accurately adjusted to the patient's dental and osseous anatomy. A faulty drilling trajectory is very difficult to correct and can cause damage to nearby structures, such as the inferior alveolar nerve; it can also cause pain to the patient and, in some cases, even implant failure. In order to avoid deviations from the optimal drilling position and orientation, it is known to use a custom-made surgical template having an exact mating region in the mouth of the patient (either on the jaw-bone, the gums or the remaining teeth), which has bore tubes with the predetermined positions and orientations. Into these bore tubes, drill sleeves are inserted, which serve to guide the drills used for creating the implant drill holes in the jaw of the patient. Such a template with drill sleeves is described in US 5,015,183, WO 2006/041430, WO 2005/053566 and WO 97/43981, for example. The drill sleeves are typically of hollow cylindrical shape and made of metal. During the drilling process, the drill sleeve's circular inner surface serves as guidance for the drill. To this end, it is known to place a secondary guiding element inside the drill sleeve, such as a drill spoon or a guiding cylinder, which can be exchanged in the course of the drilling process. The use of a drill sleeve in combination with a secondary guiding element is described in WO 2006/130067 or DE 10 2005 023 028, for instance. This approach is particularly favorable if several drills of increasing diameters are used for preparing the drill hole. Accordingly, several secondary guiding elements may be placed, one after the other, inside the same drill sleeve, each corresponding to a certain drill diameter. Alternatively, it is also possible that the drill is guided directly by the drill sleeve itself. For applying the drill hole to the patient's jaw-bone, the dental drill is inserted into the drill sleeve, optionally containing a secondary guiding element, and then the hole is drilled in the axial direction of the drill sleeve. If the space above the implantation area is limited, especially in the case where a back tooth has to be replaced, it may be difficult to insert the drill axially into the drill sleeve. In order to overcome this problem, drill sleeves having a longitudinal slit have been described in WO 2007/104842. With these slitted drill sleeves, it is possible to insert the drill sideways, which considerably facilitates the insertion of the drill into the drill sleeve. If, however, the space in the implantation area is limited in the lateral direction, especially if several adjacent implants are to be placed within the same tooth gap, there may not be enough space to place all drill sleeves necessary within the gap. In addition, if two adjacent drill sleeves placed into the template are at close quarters, the remaining template between the bore tubes for the drill sleeves may break. Accurate drilling of the drill hole can thus no longer be guaranteed. It is therefore a problem of the present invention to provide a means for guiding a dental drill, which is suitable for use in implantation areas with laterally limited space. The problem is solved by the drill sleeves according to claim 1, the set according to claim 10, and the template according to claim 12. Preferred embodiments are subject to the dependent claims. The drill sleeve of the present invention is essentially hollow cylindrical and comprises a circular inner surface for guiding the dental drill and an outer surface intended to be inserted into a template. The drill sleeve is characterized by the fact that the outer surface of the drill sleeve comprises at least one longitudinal flattened area, whereas the inner surface of the drill sleeve has a circular cross section. Thus, the drill sleeve of the present invention has, in the at least one longitudinal flattened area, a smaller wall thickness than in the other areas of the drill sleeve. The at least one longitudinal flattened area is oriented in the axial direction of the drill sleeve and has a planar outer surface. The drill sleeve of the present invention is suitable for being inserted into a bore tube in a surgical template adjusted to a patient's mouth, thus defining a drilling trajectory. The circular inner of the drill sleeve is suitable for holding a secondary guiding element and/or for guiding a dental drill directly. Thanks to the at least one longitudinal flattened area in the outer surface, the drill sleeve requires less space and may be used in small tooth gaps with limited space. In a preferred embodiment, the outer surface of the drill sleeve comprises exactly one longitudinal flattened area. Such a drill sleeve is especially well suited for gaps, into which two dental implants are to be placed: If each of the drill sleeves is oriented such that the two longitudinal flattened areas are facing each other, the distance between the two drill sleeves can be minimized without risking breakage of the interjacent template. In another preferred embodiment, the outer surface of the drill sleeve comprises two longitudinal flattened areas. A drill sleeve having two flattened areas allows for a further minimization of the space required between one drill sleeve and a vicinal second drill sleeve or tooth. When inserting said drill sleeve into the template, it is particularly preferred to arrange the sleeve such that the two flattened areas are oriented in the direction of the vicinal second drill sleeves or teeth. Depending on the implantation position and the orientation of the surrounding teeth or implants, it may be most preferred that the two longitudinal flattened areas of the outer surface are diametrically opposed or that the two flattened areas are arranged in a certain angle. In a preferred embodiment, the outer surface of the drill sleeve comprises a gripping surface. Such a gripping surface not only allows for save handling of the drill sleeve before it is inserted into the template, but also improves the anchorage of the drill sleeve in the template. The outer surface of the drill sleeve of the present invention comprises several longitudinal projections in addition to the flattened area. These projections inhibit rotation of the drill sleeve during the drilling process, thus improving the accuracy of the drilling and minimizing the stress exerted on the template. The longitudinal projections are interrupted by at least one essentially circular groove. By interaction of such a groove with a corresponding protrusion in the surrounding template, a vertical displacement of the drill sleeve within the template is inhibited. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the drill sleeve comprises a longitudinal slit. Such a slitted drill sleeve allows for inserting the drill sideways, which is particularly favorable if the space above the implantation area is limited and an axial insertion is difficult or even impossible. The longitudinal slit is preferably narrower than one third of the drill sleeve's circumference, in order to guarantee precise guiding of the drill. At the same time, the longitudinal slit is preferably wider than the diameter of the dental drill. For drill sleeves having a longitudinal slit, it is particularly preferable that the rotation of the drill sleeve during the drilling process is inhibited. Therefore, it is preferred that a drill sleeve comprising a longitudinal slit also comprises a gripping surface, and, in particular, that the drill sleeve's outer surface comprises several longitudinal projections. In a preferred embodiment, the drill sleeve comprises a circumferential flange at its coronal end. Thanks to such a circumferential flange, the fixation of the drill sleeve in the template is improved and, in particular, the drill sleeve cannot be pushed further into the template during the drilling process. Therefore, greater stability of the template-drill sleeve assembly is achieved and the accuracy of the drilling can be maximized. Preferably, the drill sleeve of the present invention is made of stainless steel. A drill sleeve of stainless steel is relatively inexpensive and guarantees precise guiding of the dental drill. In addition, it allows for facile sterilization in case the drill sleeve is used more than once. The present invention also relates to a set comprising one or more drill sleeves according to the present invention. Said set preferably comprises several drill sleeves, the drill sleeves' circular inner surfaces having differing diameters and/or differing lengths. Such a set provides a choice of drill sleeves which may be chosen by the dental surgeon according to the patient's anatomy. The present invention also relates to a template comprising one or more drill sleeves according to the present invention. The present invention also relates to the use of a drill sleeve according to the present invention for guiding a dental drill (not part of the claimed invention). The drill sleeve is preferably used in combination with a secondary guiding element inserted into the drill sleeve. Alternatively, the drill may also be guided directly by the inner surface of the drill sleeve. The use of drill sleeve according to the present invention is particularly favorable if, in the lateral direction, the space around the implantation position is limited. Embodiments of the invention will be described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which: Fig. 1shows a schematic representation of a sleeve not forming part of the claimed invention;Fig. 2shows a schematic representation of an embodiment of the drill sleeve of the present invention;Fig. 3shows a schematic representation of a sleeve not forming part of the claimed invention; andFig. 4shows a schematic representation of a template comprising two drill sleeves. The example of the drill sleeve 1 shown in Figure 1 is of essentially hollow cylindrical shape and is entirely made of stainless steel.

The outer surface 15 as shown in Figure 1 comprises one longitudinal flattened area 20. However, it would also be possible that the outer surface 15 comprises more than one longitudinal flattened area 20. At its coronal end 25, the drill sleeve 1 comprises a circumferential flange 30. The embodiment of the drill sleeve 1 shown in Figure 2 also comprises a circular inner surface 10 and an outer surface 15 with a longitudinal flattened area 20. In addition to the flattened area 20, the outer surface 15 also comprises several longitudinal projections 35, which are interrupted by an essentially circular groove 40.
