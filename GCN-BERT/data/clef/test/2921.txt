WO 2011/034727 CA 02772359 2012-02-27 PCT/US2010/047429 INTRAOCULAR PRESSURE SENSOR WITH EXTERNAL PRESSURE COMPENSATION BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This application claims the benefit of priority of U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 12/563,244, filed on September 21, 2009. The present invention relates to a device for monitoring intraocular pressure and more particularly to an implantable pressure sensor with external pressure compensation. Glaucoma, a group of eye diseases affecting the retina and optic nerve, is one of the leading causes of blindness worldwide. Glaucoma results when the intraocular pressure (IOP) increases to pressures above normal for prolonged periods of time. IOP can increase due to an imbalance of the production of aqueous humor and the drainage of the aqueous humor. Left untreated, an elevated lOP causes irreversible damage the optic nerve and retinal fibers resulting in a progressive, permanent loss of vision. The eye's ciliary body epithelium constantly produces aqueous humor, the clear fluid that fills the anterior chamber of the eye (the space between the cornea and iris). The aqueous humor flows out of the anterior chamber through the uveoscleral pathways, a complex drainage system. The delicate balance between the production and drainage of aqueous humor determines the eye's IOP. Open angle (also called chronic open angle or primary open angle) is the most common type of glaucoma. With this type, even though the anterior structures of the eye appear normal, aqueous fluid builds within the anterior chamber, causing the IOP to become elevated. Left untreated, this may result in permanent damage of the optic nerve and retina. Eye drops are generally prescribed to lower the eye pressure. In some cases, surgery is performed if the IOP cannot be adequately controlled with medical therapy. Only about 10% of the population suffers from acute angle closure glaucoma. Acute angle closure occurs because of an abnormality of the structures in the front of the eye. In most of these cases, the space between the iris and cornea is more narrow than normal, leaving a smaller channel for the aqueous to pass through. If the flow of WO 2011/034727 CA 02772359 2012-02-27 PCT/US2010/047429 aqueous becomes completely blocked, the IOP rises sharply, causing a sudden angle closure attack. Secondary glaucoma occurs as a result of another disease or problem within the eye such as: inflammation, trauma, previous surgery, diabetes, tumor, and certain medications. For this type, both the glaucoma and the underlying problem must be treated. Figure 1 is a diagram of the front portion of an eye that helps to explain the processes of glaucoma. In Figure 1, representations of the lens 110, cornea 120, iris 130, ciliary bodies 140, trabecular meshwork 150, and Schlemm's canal 160 are pictured. Anatomically, the anterior chamber of the eye includes the structures that cause glaucoma. Aqueous fluid is produced by the ciliary bodies 140 that lie beneath the iris 130 and adjacent to the lens 110 in the anterior chamber. This aqueous humor washes over the lens 110 and iris 130 and flows to the drainage system located in the angle of the anterior chamber. The angle of the anterior chamber, which extends circumferentially around the eye, contains structures that allow the aqueous humor to drain. The first structure, and the one most commonly implicated in glaucoma, is the trabecular meshwork 150. The trabecular meshwork 150 extends circumferentially around the anterior chamber in the angle. The trabecular meshwork 150 seems to act as a filter, limiting the outflow of aqueous humor and providing a back pressure producing the IOP. Schlemm's canal 160 is located beyond the trabecular meshwork 150. Schlemm's canal 160 has collector channels that allow aqueous humor to flow out of the anterior chamber. The two arrows in the anterior chamber of Figure 1 show the flow of aqueous humor from the ciliary bodies 140, over the lens 110, over the iris 130, through the trabecular meshwork 150, and into Schlemm's canal 160 and its collector channels. In glaucoma patients, lOP can vary widely during a 24 hour period. Generally, IOP is highest in the early morning hours before medication is administered upon waking. Higher pressures damage the optic nerve and can lead to blindness. Accordingly, it would be desirable to measure IOP over time in order to assess the efficacy of various treatments. In addition, continuous IOP data can be used as part of a feedback mechanism to support an implanted active IOP-controlling system (e.g. valve or pump for controlling aqueous humor flow or delivering drugs). The present invention provides an lOP measuring device.

Figure 3 is a diagram of an IOP sensor according to the principles of the present invention. Figure 4 is a diagram of one possible application of the IOP sensor of the present invention.

Figures 6A and 6B are perspective views of an end cap implementation of an lOP sensor consistent with the principles of the present invention. WO 2011/034727 CA 02772359 2012-02-27 PCT/US2010/047429 DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS Reference is now made in detail to the exemplary embodiments of the invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Wherever possible, the same reference numbers are used throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like parts. Figure 2 is a block diagram of an IOP measuring system 200 according to the principles of the present invention. In Figure 2, the IOP measuring system includes power source 205, IOP sensor 210 (which can include P1, P2, and/or P3), processor 215, memory 220, data transmission module 225, and optional speaker 230. Power source 205 is typically a rechargeable battery, such as a lithium ion or lithium polymer battery, although other types of batteries may be employed. In addition, any other type of power cell is appropriate for power source 205. Power source 205 provides power to the system 200, and more particularly to processor 215. Power source can be recharged via an RFID link or other type of magnetic coupling. Processor 215 is typically an integrated circuit with power, input, and output pins capable of performing logic functions. In various embodiments, processor 215 is a targeted device controller. In such a case, processor 215 performs specific control functions targeted to a specific device or component, such as a data transmission module 225, speaker 230, power source 205, or memory 220. In other embodiments, processor 215 is a microprocessor. In such a case, processor 215 is programmable so that it can function to control more than one component of the device. In other cases, processor 215 is not a programmable microprocessor, but instead is a special purpose controller configured to control different components that perform different functions. Memory 220 is typically a semiconductor memory such as NAND flash memory. As the size of semiconductor memory is very small, and the memory needs of the system 200 are small, memory 220 occupies a very small footprint of system 200. Memory 220 interfaces with processor 215. As such, processor 215 can write to and read from memory 220. For example, processor 215 can be configured to read data from the IOP sensor 210 and write that data to memory 220. In this manner, a series of IOP readings can be stored in memory 220. Processor 215 is also capable of performing other basic memory functions, such as erasing or overwriting memory 220, detecting when memory 220 is full, and other common functions associated with managing semiconductor memory. WO 2011/034727 CA 02772359 2012-02-27 PCT/US2010/047429 Data transmission module 225 may employ any of a number of different types of data transmission. For example, data transmission module 225 may be active device such as a radio. Data transmission module 225 may also be a passive device such as the antenna on an RFID tag. In this case, an RFID tag includes memory 220 and data transmission module 225 in the fbrm of an antenna. An RFID reader can then be placed near the system 200 to write data to or read data from memory 220. Since the amount of data typically stored in memory 220 is likely to be small (consisting of IOP readings over a period of time), the speed with which data is transferred is not crucial. Other types of data that can be stored in memory 220 and transmitted by data transmission module 225 include, but are not limited to, power source data (e.g. low battery, battery defect), speaker data (warning tones, voices), lOP sensor data (IOP readings, problem conditions), and the like. Optional speaker 230 provides a warning tone or voice to the patient when a dangerous condition exists. For example, if IOP is at a level that is likely to lead to damage or presents a risk to the patient, speaker 230 may sound a warning tone to alert the patient to seek medical attention or to administer eye drops. Processor 215 reads IOP measurements from lOP sensor 210. If processor 215 reads one or a series of lOP measurements that are above a threshold, then processor 215 can operate speaker 230 to sound a warning. The threshold can be set and stored in memory 220. In this manner, an IOP threshold can be set by a doctor, and when exceeded, a warning can be sounded. Alternatively, data transmission module may be activated to communicate an elevated IOP condition to a secondary device such as a PDA, cell phone, computer, wrist watch, custom device exclusively for this purpose, remote accessible data storage site (e.g. an internet server, email server, text message server), or other electronic device. In one embodiment, a personal electronic device uploads the data to the remote accessible data storage site (e.g. an internet server, email server, text message server). Information may be uploaded to a remote accessible data storage site so that it can be viewed in real time, for example, by medical personnel. In this case, the secondary device may contain the speaker 230. For example, in a hospital setting, after a patient has undergone glaucoma surgery and had system 200 implanted, a secondary device may be located next to the patient's hospital bed. Since IOP fluctuations are common after glaucoma surgery (both on the high side and on the low side which is also a dangerous condition), processor 215 can read lOP measurements made by an implanted IOP sensor 210. If processor 215 reads an WO 2011/034727 CA 02772359 2012-02-27 PCT/US2010/047429 unsafe IOP condition, data transmission module 225 can alert the patient and medical staff via speaker 230 or by transmitting the unsafe readings to a secondary device. Such a system is also suitable for use outside a hospital setting. For example, if an unsafe IOP condition exists, processor 215 can operate speaker 230 to sound an audible warning. The patient is then alerted and can seek medical attention. The warning can be turned off by a medical professional in a number of ways. For example, when data transmission module 225 is an RFID tag, an RFID link can be established between an external device and system 200. This external device can communicate with system 200 to turn off the speaker 230. Alternatively, an optical signal may be read by system 200. In this case, data transmission module 225 has an optical receptor that can receive a series of light pulses that represent a command - such as a command to turn off speaker 230. Figure 3 is a diagram of an IOP sensor according to the principles of the present invention. In Figure 3, the IOP sensor consists of three pressure sensors, P 1, P2, and P3, a drainage tube 430, valve 420, and divider 350. Pressure sensor P1 is located in or is in fluidic communication with the anterior chamber 340, pressure sensor P2 is located at a drainage site in the subconjunctival space, and pressure sensor P3 is located remotely from P1 and P2. Pressure sensor P1 can also be located in a lumen or tube that is in fluid communication with the anterior chamber. As such, pressure sensor P1 measures a pressure in the anterior chamber, pressure sensor P2 measures a pressure at a drainage site, and pressure sensor P3 generally measures or corresponds to atmospheric pressure. In Figure 3, tube 430 drains aqueous from the anterior chamber 340 of the eye. A valve 420 controls the flow of aqueous through the tube 430. Pressure sensor P1 measures the pressure in the tube 430 upstream from the valve 420 and downstream from the anterior chamber 340. In this manner, pressure sensor P1 measures the pressure in the anterior chamber 340. The expected measurement discrepancy between the true anterior chamber pressure and that measured by P1 when located in a tube downstream of the anterior chamber (even when located between the sclera and the conjunctiva) is very minimal. For example, Poiseuilles law for pipe flow predicts a pressure drop of 0.01 mmHg across a 5-millimeter long tube with a 0.300 millimeter inner diameter for a flow rate of 3 microliters per minute of water. A divider 350 separates pressure sensor P2 from pressure sensor P3. Pressure sensor P2 is located at a drainage site (e.g. 410 in Figure 4). As such, pressure sensor WO 2011/034727 CA 02772359 2012-02-27 PCT/US2010/047429 P2 is located in a pocket that generally contains aqueous - it is in a wet location. Pressure sensor P3 is physically separated from pressure sensor P2 by divider 350. Divider 350 is a physical structure that separates the wet location of P2 from the dry location of P3. Divider 350 is included when the system of the present invention is located on a single substrate. In this configuration, all three pressure sensors (P 1, P2, and P3) are located on a substrate that includes tube 430, valve 420, divider 350, and the other components of the system. In one embodiment of the present invention, pressure sensor P3 is located in close proximity to the eye. Pressure sensor P3 may be implanted in the eye under the conjunctiva. In such a case, pressure sensor P3 measures a pressure that can be correlated with atmospheric pressure. For example, true atmospheric pressure can be a function of the pressure reading of pressure sensor P3. P3 may also be located in a dry portion of the subconjunctival space, separate from the drainage location. Regardless of location, pressure sensor P3 is intended to measure atmospheric pressure in the vicinity of the eye or at the eye's surface. Generally, IOP is a gauge pressure reading - the difference between the absolute pressure in the eye (as measured by P1) and atmospheric pressure (as measured by P3). Atmospheric pressure, typically about 760 mm Hg, often varies in magnitude by 10 mmHg or more. For example, atmospheric pressure can vary significantly if a patient goes swimming, hiking, etc. Such a variation in atmospheric pressure is significant since IOP is typically in the range of about 15 mm Hg. Thus, for 24 hour monitoring of IOP, it is desirable to have pressure readings for the anterior chamber (as measured by P1) and atmospheric pressure in the vicinity of the eye (as measured by P3). Therefore, in one embodiment of the present invention, pressure readings are taken by P1 and P3 simultaneously or nearly simultaneously over time so that the actual IOP can be calculated (as P1-P3 or P I-f(P3)). The pressure readings of P1 and P3 can be stored in memory 220 by processor 215. They can later be read from memory so that actual IOP over time can be interpreted by a physician. Pressure sensors P1, P2, and P3 can be any type of pressure sensor suitable for implantation in the eye. They each may be the same type of pressure sensor, or they may be different types of pressure sensors. For example, pressure sensors P 1 and P2 may be the same type of pressure sensor (implanted in the eye), and pressure sensor P3 may be a different type of pressure sensor (in the vicinity of the eye). WO 2011/034727 CA 02772359 2012-02-27 PCT/US2010/047429 In another embodiment of the present invention, pressure readings taken by pressure sensors P1 and P2 can be used to control a device that drains aqueous from the anterior chamber 340. Figure 4 is a diagram of one possible application of the IOP sensor of the present invention that utilizes the readings of pressures sensors P 1 and P2. In Figure 4, pressure sensor P 1 measures the pressure in the anterior chamber 340 of the eye. Pressure sensor P2 measures the pressure at a drainage site 410. Numerous devices have been developed to drain aqueous from the anterior chamber 340 to control glaucoma. Most of these devices are variations of a tube that shunts aqueous from the anterior chamber 340 to a drainage location 410. For example, tubes have been developed that shunt aqueous from the anterior chamber 340 to the subconjunctival space thus forming a bleb under the conjunctiva or to the subscleral space thus forming a bleb under the sclera. (Note that a bleb is a pocket of fluid that forms under the conjunctiva or sclera). Other tube designs shunt aqueous from the anterior chamber to the suprachoroidal space, the supraciliary space, the juxta-uveal space, or to the choroid. In other applications, tubes shunt aqueous from the anterior chamber to Schlemm's canal, a collector channel in Schlemm's canal, or any of a number of different blood vessels like an episcleral vein. Some tubes even shunt aqueous from the anterior chamber to outside the conjunctiva. Finally, in some applications, no tube is used at ail. For example, in a trabeculectomy (or other type of filtering procedure), a small hole is made from the subconjunctival or subscleral space to the anterior chamber. In this manner, aqueous drains from the anterior chamber, through the hole, and to a bleb under the conjunctiva or sclera. Each of these different anatomical locations to which aqueous is shunted is an example of a drainage location 410. In Figure 4, a tube 430 with a valve 420 on one end is located with one end in the anterior chamber 340 and the other end in a drainage location 410. In this manner, the tube 430 drains aqueous from the anterior chamber 340 to the drainage location 410. Valve 420 controls the flow of aqueous from anterior chamber 340 to drainage location 410. Pressure sensor P1 is located in the anterior chamber or in fluid communication with the anterior chamber 340. As shown in the embodiment of Figure 3, pressure sensor P1 is located upstream from valve 420. In this manner, pressure sensor P1 is located in the subconjunctival space but is in fluid communication with the anterior chamber 340. Since pressure sensor P1 measures the pressure in the anterior chamber 340 and pressure sensor P2 measures pressure at the drainage location 410, the difference WO 2011/034727 CA 02772359 2012-02-27 PCT/US2010/047429 between the readings taken by these two pressure sensors (P1-P2) provides an indication of the pressure differential between the anterior chamber 340 and the drainage location 410. In one embodiment, this pressure differential dictates the rate of aqueous flow from the anterior chamber 340 to the drainage location 410. One complication involved with filtering surgery that shunts the anterior chamber 340 to a drainage location 410 is hypotony - a dangerous drop in IOP that can result in severe consequences. It is desirable to control the rate of aqueous outflow from the anterior chamber 340 to the drainage location 410 so as to prevent hypotony. Readings from pressure sensor P1 and pressure sensor P2 can be used to control the flow rate through tube 430 by controlling valve 420. For example, valve 420 can be controlled based on the pressure readings from pressure sensor P1 and pressure sensor P2. In another embodiment of the present invention, IOP (based on readings from pressure sensor P 1 and pressure sensor P3) can be controlled by controlling valve 420. In this manner, IOP is the control parameter. Valve 420 can be adjusted to maintain a particular IOP (like an IOP of 15 mm Hg). Valve 420 may be opened more at night than during the day to maintain a particular IOP. In other embodiments, an IOP drop can be controlled. Immediately after filtering surgery, IOP can drop precipitously. Valve 420 can be adjusted to permit a gradual drop in IOP based on readings from pressure sensors P 1 and P3. In another embodiment of the present invention, readings from pressure sensor P2 (or from the difference between pressure sensor P2 and atmospheric pressure as measured by P3) can be used to control valve 420 so as to control the morphology of a bleb. One of the problems associated with filtering surgery is bleb failure. A bleb can fail due to poor formation or fibrosis. The pressure in the bleb is one factor that determines bleb morphology. Too much pressure can cause a bleb to migrate to an undesirable location or can lead to fibrosis. The pressure of the bleb can be controlled by using the reading from pressure sensor P2 (at drainage location 410 - in this case, a bleb). In one embodiment of the present invention, the difference between the pressure in the bleb (as measured by P2) and atmospheric pressure (as measured by P3) can be used to control valve 420 to maintain a desired bleb pressure. In this manner, the IOP pressure sensor of the present invention can also be used to properly maintain a bleb. WO 2011/034727 CA 02772359 2012-02-27 PCT/US2010/047429 Valve 420 can be controlled by microprocessor 215 or a suitable PID controller. A desired pressure differential (that corresponds to a desired flow rate) can be maintained by controlling the operation of valve 420. Likewise, a desired IOP, lOP change rate, or bleb pressure can be controlled by controlling the operation of valve 420. While valve 420 is depicted as a valve, it can be any of a number of different flow control structures that meter, restrict, or permit the flow of aqueous from the anterior chamber 340 to the drainage location 410. In addition, valve 420 can be located anywhere in or along tube 430. Finally, there are many other similar uses for the present IOP sensor. For example, various pressure readings can be used to determine if tube 420 is occluded or obstructed in some undesirable manner. As such, failure of a drainage device can be detected. In a self clearing lumen that shunts the anterior chamber 340 to a drainage location 410, an undesirable blockage can be cleared based on the pressure readings of P1, P2, and/or P3. Figure 5 is an end cap implementation of an IOP sensor consistent with the principles of the present invention. In Figure 5, pressure sensors P1 and P3 are integrated into an end cap 510. End cap 510 fits in tube 430 so as to form a fluid tight seal. One end of tube 430 resides in the anterior chamber 340, and the other end of tube 430 (where end cap 510 is located) is located outside of the anterior chamber 340. Typically, one end of tube 430 resides in the anterior chamber 340, and the other end resides in the subconjunctival space. In this manner, pressure sensor P 1 is in fluid communication with the anterior chamber 340. Since there is almost no pressure difference between the anterior chamber 340 and the interior of tube 430 that is in fluid contáct with the anterior chamber 340, pressure sensor P1 measures the pressure in the anterior chamber 340. Pressure sensor P3 is external to the anterior chamber 340 and either measures atmospheric pressure or can be correlated to atmospheric pressure. Typically, tube 430 is placed in the eye to bridge the anterior chamber 340 to the subconjunctival space, as in glaucoma filtration surgery. In this case, P3 resides in the subconjunctival space. In this configuration, P3 measures a pressure that is either very close to atmospheric pressure or that can be correlated to atmospheric pressure through the use of a simple function. Since plug 510 provides a fluid tight seal for tube 430, pressure sensor P3 is isolated from pressure sensor Pl. Therefore, ll WO 2011/034727 CA 02772359 2012-02-27 PCT/US2010/047429 an accurate IOP reading can be taken as the difference between the pressure readings of P1 and P3 (P1-P3). In one embodiment, a single, thin membrane 520 resides in the sensor package and is exposed to P1 on one side (tube side) and P3 on the other side (isolation side), and thus the net pressure on the membrane 520 is recorded by the sensor, providing a gauge reading corresponding IOP. Figures 6A and 6B are perspective views of the end cap implementation of Figure 5. In this embodiment, pressure sensor P1 is located on one end of end cap 510 so that it can be located inside tube 430. Pressure sensor P3 is located on the other end of end cap 510 so that it can be located outside of tube 430. A membrane (520) separates P1 from P3. In this manner, pressure sensor P1 is isolated from pressure sensor P3. While pressure sensors P1 and P3 are depicted as being located on opposite surfaces of a membrane 520 in the end cap 510, they can also be located integral with end cap 510 in any suitable position to facilitate the pressure measurements. From the above, it may be appreciated that the present invention provides a system for measuring IOP. The present invention provides an IOP sensor with external pressure compensation. The present invention is illustrated herein by example, and various modifications may be made by a person of ordinary skill in the art. Other embodiments of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art from consideration of the specification and practice of the invention disclosed herein. It is intended that the specification and examples be considered as exemplary only, with a true scope and spirit of the invention being indicated by the following claims.
