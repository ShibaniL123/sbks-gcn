Step 5: 2-(3-amino-4-(thiophen-3-yl)phenyl)-N-cyclopropyl-2,2-difluoroacetamide
To a mixed solution of methanol (40 mL) and water (40 mL) were added N-cyclopropyl-2,2-difluoro-2-(3-nitro-4-(thiophen-3-yl)phenyl)acetamide (153 mg, 0.45 mmol), reduced iron powder (128.4 mg, 2.3 mmol) and ammonium chloride (123.0 mg, 2.3 mmol). The resulting mixture was reacted for 0.5 hour at a temperature of 70 Â°C, and then cooled to room temperature. After filtration, the filter cake was washed with ethyl acetate, and the filtrate was separated. The organic phase was dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate, and the solvent was removed by rotary evaporation to afford 2-(3-amino-4-(thiophen-3-yl)phenyl)-N-cyclopropyl -2,2-difluoroacetamide (140 mg, yield 100%).
