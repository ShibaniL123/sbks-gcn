c) A mixture of 4-t-butylbenzenesulfonyl chloride (0.10 g, 0.43 mmol) and 1-(isoquinolin-4-yl)-3-methyl-1H-pyrazol-5-amine (0.080 g, 0.36 mmol) in pyridine (5 mL) was heated at 80Â° C. for 15 h with stirring. After cooling to room temperature, the reaction mixture was concentrated in vacuo. The crude residue was purified by flash chromatography (SiO2, 50-100% ethyl acetate in hexanes) to give the title compound as a white solid (0.18 g, 0.12 mmol, 27%).
