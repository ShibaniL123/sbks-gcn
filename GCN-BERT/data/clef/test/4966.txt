SIZING COMPOSITIONS FOR WET AND DRY FILAMENT WINDING Cross-Reference to Related Applications This application claims priority to United States Provisional Patent Application Serial No. 61/975,472, filed on April 4, 2014, which is hereby incorporated by reference as though fully set forth herein. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to sizing compositions for glass fibers and to fiber glass strands comprising a plurality of glass fibers at least partially coated with a sizing composition. Background of the Invention Various chemical treatments exist for glass-type surfaces such as glass fibers to aid in their processability and applications. Before bundling the filaments together after formation, a coating composition or sizing composition is applied to at least a portion of the surface of the individual filaments to protect them from abrasion and to assist in processing. As used herein, the terms "sizing composition," "sizing," "binder composition," "binder," or "size" refer to a coating composition applied to the filaments immediately after forming. Sizing compositions can provide protection through subsequent processing steps, such as those where the fibers pass by contact points as in the winding of the fibers and strands onto a forming package, drying the aqueous-based or solvent-based sizing composition to remove the water or solvent, twisting from one package to a bobbin, beaming to place the yarn onto very large packages ordinarily used as the warp in a fabric, chopping in a wet or dry condition, roving into larger bundles or groups of strands, unwinding for use as a reinforcement, weaving, and/or other downstream processes. In addition, sizing compositions can play a dual role when placed on fibers that reinforce polymeric matrices in the production of fiber-reinforced plastics or in the reinforcement of other materials. In the reinforcement of polymeric matrices, the sizing composition can provide protection and also can provide compatibility between the fiber and the matrix polymer or resin. For instance, glass fibers in the forms of rovings, woven fabrics, nonwoven fabric, mats, chopped strands, and other forms have been used with resins, such as thermosetting and thermoplastic resins, for impregnation by, encapsulation by, or reinforcement of the resin. In such applications, it may be desirable to maximize the compatibility between the surface and the polymeric resin while also improving the ease of processability and manufacturability. One exemplary application of glass fibers is in filament winding. In filament winding, continuous glass fibers in the form of rovings are impregnated with a resin and are wound around a steel mandrel until a desired thickness is reached to form a pipe. The resin used can depend on the properties desired in the end product, and certain components of the sizing composition on the glass fibers can be selected based on the resin system which is used. Examples of resins useful in such processes include epoxy resins. It would be desirable to have new sizing compositions for fiber glass that can be used in a variety of applications such as, for example, filament winding applications.

In some embodiments, it may be desirable not to include any reactive modified siloxane polymer. For example, in dry filament winding manufacturing processes, the inclusion of certain reactive modified siloxane polymers in some embodiments of sizing compositions can leave a sticky film on the tensioning bars leading to excessive winding tension in some instances. As to the amount of the reactive modified siloxane polymer in embodiments of sizing compositions of the present invention, the reactive modified siloxane polymer, in some embodiments, comprises at least 1 percent by weight of the sizing composition on a total solids basis. In some embodiments, the sizing compositions comprise about 15 weight percent or less reactive modified siloxane polymer on a total solids basis. The sizing compositions, in some embodiments, comprise about 10 weight percent or less reactive modified siloxane polymer on a total solids basis. In some embodiments, the sizing compositions comprise between about 1 and about 10 weight percent reactive modified siloxane polymer on a total solids basis.

For example, if the glass fibers are to be used in the reinforcement of a particular polymer, the film- former can be selected to be compatible with that polymer (or not to negatively interfere with the reinforcement of that polymer). A number of film formers can used in various embodiments of the present invention. Non-limiting examples of film formers that can be used in various embodiments of the present invention comprise epoxies, polyvinylpyrrolidones, polyesters, polyurethanes, or mixtures, or copolymers, or aqueous dispersions thereof.

Embodiments of the present invention also relate to fiber glass strands and fiber glass rovings comprising at least one glass fiber at least partially coated with an embodiment of a sizing composition of the present invention. Such embodiments of fiber glass strands can include glass fibers at least partially coated with any of the sizing compositions described herein. Glass fibers are produced by flowing molten glass via gravity through a multitude of small openings in a precious metal device, called a bushing. After the fibers have cooled very shortly after their issuance from the bushing and usually in close proximity to the bushing, these fibers are at least partially coated with a sizing composition of the present invention. The sizing composition can be applied by sprayers, rollers, belts, metering devices, or other similar application devices. The sized glass fibers are gathered into strands comprising a plurality of individual fibers, generally from 200 to more than 4000. After their formation and treatment, the strands are typically wound into a "forming package." The strands can be wound onto a paper or plastic tube using a winder. The forming packages are usually dried in either an oven or at room temperature to remove some of the moisture from the fibers. Additional information related to fiberizable glass compositions and methods of making glass filaments are disclosed in K. Loewenstein, The Manufacturing Technology of Glass Fibres, (3d Ed. 1993) at pages 30- 44, 47-60, 115-122 and 126-135, which are hereby incorporated by reference. For some applications, the strands are later wound onto a bobbin via conventional textile twisting techniques such as a twist frame. For other applications, the strands are not twisted and/or wound onto a bobbin. The amount of sizing composition on the strand may be measured as "loss on ignition" or "LOI". As used herein, the term "loss on ignition" or "LOI" means the weight percent of dried sizing composition present on the fiber glass as determined by Equation 1 : LOI = 100 X [(W^ - Wbare)/Wdiy] (Eq. 1) wherein Wdry is the weight of the fiber glass plus the weight of the coating after drying in an oven at 220° F (about 104° C) for 60 minutes, and Wbare is the weight of the bare fiber glass after heating the fiber glass in an oven at 1 150° F (about 621° C) for 20 minutes and cooling to room temperature in a dessicator. In general, although not limiting, the loss on ignition (LOI) of embodiments of fiber glass strands of the present invention may be up to 2 percent. In other non-limiting embodiments, the LOI can be up to 1.5 percent. In further non-limiting embodiments, the LOI can be up to 1 percent. At lower LOI levels, the broken filament levels of a fiber glass product can increase. However, increasing the LOI increases production costs. Thus, in some non-limiting embodiments, the LOI can be between 0.4 and 1 weight percent. In non-limiting embodiments, a fiber glass strand of the present invention can comprise between twenty (20) and ten thousand (10,000) filaments per strand. In other non-limiting embodiments, a fiber glass strand of the present invention can comprise between two hundred (200) and four thousand five hundred (4,500) filaments per strand. The strands, in non-limiting examples, can be from 50 yards per pound to more than 18,000 yards per pound depending on the application. For some applications, such as filament winding, the strands can typically be between 250 yards per pound and 675 yards per pound, although other yields can be used. The diameter of the filaments used in non-limiting embodiments of fiber glass strands of the present invention can be between, in general, between five (5) and eighty (80) microns. In some non-limiting embodiments, the diameter of the filaments can be between seven (7) and twenty-eight (28) microns. The diameter of the filaments, in some non-limiting embodiments, can be between thirteen (13) and twenty- four (24) microns. Fiber glass strands at least partially coated with embodiments of sizing compositions of the present invention can be used in a number of different applications. One example of such an application is filament winding. Filament winding is a technique commonly used to manufacture a fiber-glass reinforced composite, often in the shape of a cylinder. Cylindrical filament wound composites can be used, for example, as pipes. Epoxy resins are commonly used in filament winding applications although persons of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that other resins might also be used. In a typical filament winding operation, a plurality of fiber glass strands are coated with a matrix material (typically, including a thermosetting resin, one or more curing agents, and/or other additives) and then wound on a cylindrical mandrel in a predetermined pattern to a predetermined thickness. After winding, the pipe is then cured by heating for a given period of time. The mandrel is then removed. There are two common types of filament winding processes: wet filament winding and dry filament winding. In wet filament winding, the strands go through a bath holding the matrix material and then pass through an orifice to remove excess matrix material from the strand. The "wet" strands are then wound on a mandrel and cured as described above. In dry filament winding, dry fiber glass strands are wound on a mandrel, and the matrix material is then applied to the strands on the mandrel. Different sizing compositions according to some embodiments of the present invention might be used depending on whether the fiber glass strand is to be used in a dry filament winding operation or a wet filament winding operation. Fiber glass strands of the present invention can be filament wound to form a reinforced pipe or other structure using techniques known to those of skill in the art. In addition, persons of skill in the art can identify other applications for which fiber glass strands according to the present invention can be used. For example, fiber glass strands or rovings of the present invention can be woven into a fabric and then formed into a composite using pultrusion or hand lay-up techniques. Some embodiments of the present invention relate to fiber glass reinforced composites. In some embodiments, a composite comprises a resin and a plurality of glass fibers at least partially coated with a sizing composition of the present invention. In general, any of the sizing compositions of the present invention can be used in such composites. In some embodiments, the resin to be reinforced is a thermosetting resin. In some further embodiments, the thermosetting resin comprises an epoxy. In some embodiments, a composite of the present invention is in the form of a pipe. Some embodiments of the present invention relate to a pipe. In some embodiments, the pipe comprises a thermosetting resin and a plurality of glass fibers at least partially coated with a sizing composition of the present invention. The pipe can be formed by filament winding in some embodiments. In some embodiments, the thermosetting resin can comprise an epoxy. Fiber glass reinforced composites of the present invention, in some embodiments, can have one or more desirable properties including, without limitation, desirable hydrolysis resistance (short and long term), desirable strength, interlaminar shear strength, and other properties relevant to the durability of the composites.

After agitating for at least 15 minutes further, the sizing composition was tested to make sure it met the target percent solids (18.9%) and pH (4.7). Measurement of Inter-Laminar Shear Strength Each of the sizing compositions in Tables 1 and 2 was applied to fiber glass strands. Additionally, two commerically available sizing compositions (rovings) were also applied to fiber glass strands. The sizing compositions were applied to the glass filaments during the fiber glass forming process when the newly formed glass filaments contacted directly a sizing application device. A fiber glass strand containing up to 4,000 filaments was then wound onto the mandrel of a winder to form a roving package. After being removed from the mandrel of the winder and dried in an oven, the roving package can then be used as the reinforcement material in composites fabrication processes including filament winding. The amount of sizing applied on glass fiber strands is measured as LOI (Loss Of Ignition). Typical nominal LOI values are in the range of 0.40% - 0.80%. Typical nominal fiber diameter of a fiber glass roving strand for filament winding is in the range of 10 - 30 μηι. Typical nominal roving linear density for filament winding applications is in the range of 600 - 4,500 TEX. Fiber glass rovings coated with the sizing compositions in Tables 1 and 2 as well as two commercially available sizing compositions were used to fabricate glass fiber reinforced epoxy composite cylinders with filament winding process for Inter-Laminar Shear Strength (ILSS) testing. During filament winding, a single roving strand unwound from a roving package was pulled through a tensioning device and then into a resin bath to saturate with epoxy resin and then wound onto a 6-inch mandrel at a winding angle of 86 - 88 degrees to form a composite cylinder. The epoxy resin (D.E.R. 383) used for the composite cylinder fabrication was mixed with a cycloaliphatic amine hardener (VESTAMIN IPD) at a ratio of 100:22. After curing and post-curing, the composite cylinder was cut into ILSS specimens with dimensions specified in ASTM D2344 ("Standard Test Method for Short-Beam Strength of Polymer Matrix Composite Materials and Their Laminates"). The ILSS testing was conducted at the PPG Fiber Glass Science and Technology Center in Shelby, North Carolina per the procedure specified in ASTM D2344 test method. The results of these tests are provided in Table 3. As is shown in Table 3, ILSS data can be used as an indicator for fiber-matrix interfacial bonding strength and durability. It is important to reach certain level of ILSS value under dry conditions and without ageing to ensure adequate initial fiber-matrix bonding strength. Since a fiber glass reinforced epoxy pipe is typically used in wet conditions under internal pressure, it is equally important to have a durable fiber-matrix interface in this kind of corrosive environment. Higher retained ILSS values after 1 ,000- hour ageing in hot water is an indication of improved interfacial hydrolysis resistance for Sizing Compositions A, B and C over the two commercial sizing compositions as shown in Table 3. Table 3 Desirable characteristics, which can be exhibited by the present invention, include, but are not limited to, the provision of sizing compositions that can be useful on glass fibers to be used in filament winding process (wet and/or dry); the provision of fiber glass strands coated with a sizing composition that are adapted for use in filament 34 Test standard: ASTM D2344 Resin: D.E.R. 383 Epoxy Resin Hardener: VESTAMIN IPD cycloaliphatic diamine winding processes; the provision of fiber glass strands that can be processed with acceptable break levels during downstream processing; the provision of fiber glass strands that can exhibit a desired tensile strength; the provision of fiber glass strands that can be used in the reinforcement of a composite having desirable properties (e.g., strength, hydrolysis resistance, etc.); and others.
