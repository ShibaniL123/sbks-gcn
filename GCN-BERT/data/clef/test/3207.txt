Example 6: Preparation of sodium (2S,5R)-2-((2-methyl-2-azaspiro[3.3]heptan-6-yl)carbamoyl)-7-oxo-1,6-diazabicyclo[3.2.1]octa n-6-yl sulfate (sodium salt of Compound 6) (Method I)
(1) Preparatoin of tert-butyl (2-methyl-2-azaspiro[3.3]heptan-6-yl)carbamate
Tert-butyl 2-azaspiro[3.3]heptan-6-ylcarbamate (1 g, 4.71 mmol) was dissolved in dichloromethane (20 mL), added at 0°C with formaldehyde aqueous solution (mass fraction 40%, 1.9 g, 63.28 mmol), acetic acid (141 mg, 2.35 mmol) and sodium cyanoborohydride (592 mg, 9.42 mmol). After addition of materials, the reaction solution was stirred at room temperature for 2h, diluted by adding dichloromethane (30 mL), washed with water (30 mL×3), dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, concentrated in vacuum, the crude product was purified by silica gel column chromatography (dichloromethane : methanol =50:1 to 10:1) to obtain the title compound as a white solid (900 mg, yield 84.0%).
