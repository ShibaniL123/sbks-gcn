A cooled (5° C.) solution of ethyl 4-(cycloheptylamino)-2-(methylsulfanyl)pyrimidine-5-carboxylate (5a, 21 g, 67.9 mmol) in THF (200 mL) was treated LAH (2.5 M solution in THF, 81.4 mL, 204 mmol) in portions over 1.5 h. The resulting suspension stirred at 5 to 10° C. for an additional hour, then at room temperature for 18 h. The mixture was cooled slightly (15° C.), then water (10 mL) and 2 N NaOH (10 mL) were added dropwise to quench any residual LAH. After stirring for 1 hour at room temperature, the suspension was filtered, and the flask and filter cake were rinsed with THF (300 mL×4). The combined filtrates were concentrated to remove most of the solvent. The residue was partitioned between water (100 mL) and EtOAc (250 mL×2). The combined organic layers were washed with sat. aq NaCl (100 mL), dried over sodium sulfate, and concentrated to dryness. The crude product was recrystallized from petroleum ether/EtOAc (200 mL/50 mL) to give [4-(cycloheptylamino)-2-(methylsulfanyl)pyrimidin-5-yl]methanol (5b, 13.6 g, 75%) as a white solid. MS: 268 [M+H]+.
