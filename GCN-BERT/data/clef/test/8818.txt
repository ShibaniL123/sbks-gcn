BACKGROUND Receptor tyrosine kinases are involved in stimulating the growth of many cancers. In general, receptor tyrosine kinases are glycoproteins which consist of (1) an extracellular domain that is able to bind with a specific ligand, (2) a transmembrane region, (3) a juxtamembrane domain which may regulate the receptor activity by, for instance, protein phosphorylation, (4) a tyrosine kinase domain that is the enzymatic component of the receptor, and (5) a carboxyterminal tail. The ErbB family of type 1 receptor tyrosine kinases constitute one important class of receptors because of their importance in mediating cell growth, differentiation and survival in many solid tumors. Members of this receptor family include ErbB1 (also known as HER1), ErbB2 (HER2/neu), ErbB3 (HER3), and ErbB4 (HER4). More than a dozen ligands interact with the ErbB-family receptors. For example, EGF, Transforming Growth Factor α (TGFα), and amphiregulin all bind to ErbB 1. Isoforms of neuregulin, also known as Heregulin and Neu Differentiation Factor (NDF) have specific affinity for ErbB3 and ErbB4. Ligands such as betacellulin, heparin-binding EGF and epiregulin bind to both ErbB1 and ErbB4. It is becoming clear that over expression of ErbB activating ligands can cause uncontrolled cellular proliferation similar to that of a deregulated receptor. In such cases, interference with the binding of the activating ligand to its receptor may provide an effective therapeutic strategy or that could accentuate current receptor based or other therapies. Therapeutics that interfere with ligand binding to ErbB3 may be particularly effective. ErbB3 differs from the other receptors in the EGFR family because its tyrosine kinase domain is functionally inactive; however, ErbB2/ErbB3 heterodimers transmit the most potent mitogenic signals of any homo- or heterodimer combination of the ErbB family. Therefore, ErbB3 is an important target, yet one that cannot be inhibited through small molecules that target the kinase region. Since ErbB3 requires an activating ligand, such as heregulin or NDF, before activated heterodimers can form, molecules that can interfere with the binding of ErbB3 receptor ligands could be used to block or interfere with the formation of ErbB dimers and heterodimers. One example of such a molecule would be a molecule that has ligand binding affinity and can therefore “trap” ligands and effectively reduce their concentration so that they cannot activate the ErbB3 receptor. In addition to ErbB3 ligands, the other known ErbB receptor ligands, have similar effects to varying degrees. Thus, binding molecules that can trap and sequester the full spectrum of ErbB ligands may be of even more use in the treatment of cancer. Several therapeutics exist that have attempted this trapping or “decoy” strategy. For example, Enbrel™ (etanercept-Amgen) is a soluble, modified version of the TNFR receptor that binds and traps the pro-inflammatory ligand TNFα. In addition, a soluble fusion protein of the VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 receptors, called a VEGF Trap, is currently in clinical trials for the treatment of both macular degeneration and several forms of cancer (Regeneron Pharmaceuticals). An ErbB3 trap has also shown potency in vitro at enhancing the effects of a dual EGFR/ErbB2 inhibitor and reversed GW2974 (a small molecule inhibitor of ErbB1 and ErbB2) resistance in cells treated with NDF. All currently approved ErbB inhibitors target either EGFR, ErbB2, ErbB3, ErbB4 or combinations of all 4 receptors. However, no therapeutic is known that interferes with the binding of ligands to multiple ErbB receptors simultaneously. Clearly, new binding molecules are needed that can be used to sequester receptor ligands, such as ErbB ligands, and thereby block ligand binding to multiple ErbB receptors and subsequent receptor activation. Binding molecules capable of binding all known ErbB ligands would be particularly useful. A number of binding studies have been carried out to determine regions of ErbB3 that are important to the binding of its ligand, heregulin. Singer, et. al. (2001), J. Biol. Chem. 276, 44266-44274. Other studies using chimeric receptors have identified the relative contributions of the extracellular domains of ErbB1 and ErbB4 to ligand-specific signaling. Kim, et. al. (2002), Eur. J. Biochem. 269, 2323-2329. These studies reveal that neuregulin binding to ErbB4 depends much more on domain I than on domain III and that domain III of ErbB1 is primarily important for EGF binding. However, these studies were conducted on full length receptors which span the entire length of the receptors including the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. These large molecules present manufacturing and administration problems potentially leading to lower therapeutic efficacy. SUMMARY Chimeric ErbB ligand binding molecules having detectable binding activity for more ErbB ligands than any one of native ErbB1, ErbB3 or ErbB4 are disclosed. Preferably, the binding molecules bind a broad spectrum and, more preferably, the full spectrum of ErbB ligands. The chimeric ErbB ligand binding molecule generally has a subdomain LI derived from one of ErbB3 or 4 and a subdomain LII derived from another distinct ErbB receptor type, such as ErbB1, which are linked. The sub-domain, SI, can be used to join LI and LII. Subdomain SI can be from either one of the receptor types or can have portions from both. In one embodiment the chimeric ErbB ligand binding molecule can include at least a portion of LI from ErbB4 linked to at least a portion of LII derived from ErbB1. LII can be linked to module 1 of SII from ErbB1. An SI subdomain can be used to link LI and LII subdomains and can be derived from either the ErbB1 or ErbB4 receptor sequences or can be a mixture of both. Optionally, the ErbB chimera can be fused to an aggregant such as IgG2Fc. In one embodiment the chimeric ErbB ligand binding molecule can include at least a portion of LI from ErbB4; an SI region having a portion derived from ErbB4 and a portion derived from ErbB1, wherein the ErbB4 portion switches to the ErbB1 portion in a region having homology between the two sequences; at least a portion of LII can be derived from ErbB1 and module 1 of SII of ErbB1. In one embodiment the chimeric ErbB ligand binding molecule can include at least a portion of a subunit LI from ErbB3 linked to at least a portion of an LII derived from ErbB1 and module 1 of SII from ErbB1. The linking region can be an SI domain from ErbB1, ErbB3 or their mixtures. In one embodiment the chimeric ErbB ligand binding molecule can include at least a portion of a subunit LI from ErbB3, an SI region having a portion is derived from ErbB3 and a portion is derived from ErbB 1, at least a portion of LII derived from ErbB 1 and module 1 of SII derived from ErbB1. In one embodiment the chimeric ErbB ligand binding molecule can include at least a portion of a subunit LI from ErbB4, an SI region having a portion derived from ErbB4 and a portion is derived from ErbB1, at least a portion of LII from ErbB1 and module 1 of SII from ErbB1. In one embodiment the chimeric ErbB ligand binding molecule can include at least a portion of a subunit LI from ErbB3; an SI region having a portion derived from ErbB3 and a portion derived from ErbB1, wherein the ErbB3 portion switches to the ErbB1 portion in a region having homology between the two sequences; at least a portion of LII derived from ErbB1 and module 1 of SII derived from ErbB1. DNA sequences that encode the disclosed chimeric ErbB ligand binding molecules are also contemplated along with sequences that facilitate expression and host cells for the maintenance and expression of such DNA sequences. Pharmaceutical compositions that contain the chimeric ErbB ligand binding molecules and a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient are also contemplated. The chimeric ErbB ligand binding molecule can be used by immobilizing it on a solid support which can in turn be used for binding ErbB ligands such that the ligands can be removed from biological fluids, particularly from patients suffering from diseases associated with over-expression of such ligands. The ErbB ligand depleted biological fluids can then be replaced in those patients. Methods for treating patients having diseases that are associated with overexpression of ErbB ligands are also contemplated that involve administering a pharmaceutical composition that contain therapeutically effective amounts of the chimeric ErbB ligand binding molecule in a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient. FIGURES FIG. 1 illustrates several potential subunit structures of a chimeric ErbB4-ErbB1 chimera. The highlighted sequence shows one specific embodiment of a chimeric ErbB ligand binding molecule starting with the ErbB4 sequence. FIG. 2 illustrates several potential subunit structures of a chimeric ErbB3-ErbB1 chimera. FIG. 3 provides an alignment of ErbB1 (bottom sequence) and ErbB4 (top sequence). The highlighted amino acid sequence shows one specific embodiment of a chimeric ErbB ligand binding molecule starting with the ErbB sequence. DETAILED DESCRIPTION The complete nucleotide sequences of the ErbB1, ErbB2, ErbB3 and ErbB4 are known and can be found in Genbank as accession number NM 005228 for ErbB1, accession number NM 004448 for ErbB2, accession number M29366 or NM 001982 for ErbB3, and accession number NM 005235 for ErbB4. The full length ectodomain, the extracellular domain, for ErbB receptors contains four sub-domains, sometimes referred to as L1, CR1, L2 and CR2, where L and CR stand for large and cysteine rich, respectively. The sub-domains are also sometimes known as domains I-IV or alternatively as LI, SI, LII and SII as they extend from the amino terminus. Amino acid sequences of the receptors have been analyzed and the sequences appear to be homologous and have been aligned. Alignments of the ectodomains of ErbB1, ErbB2, ErbB3 and ErbB4 are provided in US Patent Publication No. 2006/0234343 in FIGS. 1A and 1B. The sub-domains are composed of smaller domains known as subregions. For example, the S1 or CR1 sub-domain contains 8 disulfide bonded subregions sometimes known as modules which are numbered 1-8 as they extend from the amino to carboxy terminal direction. SII contains seven (7) modules numbered 1-7. A large ordered loop has been identified in module 5 that is thought to project directly away from the ligand binding site. The amino acid sequence in this loop is highly conserved. Chimeric ErbB ligand binding molecules are disclosed wherein sub-domains LI, SI, LII and module 1 of SII from at least two different ErbB receptors are combined in a single binding molecule. For purposes of this disclosure, the phrase “chimeric” with respect to the ErbB ligand binding molecule is intended to mean a single ErbB ligand binding molecule made from and containing portions of more than one ErbB receptor ectodomain. The phrases “ErbB chimera” and “chimeric ErbB ligand binding molecule” are used interchangeably in this application and are intended to be synonymous and refer to the protein sequence of a monomer. As can be appreciated in some embodiments the chimera molecules may dimerize through formation of disulfide bonds. Surprisingly, it has been found that portions of the amino acid sequence of ErbB3 or ErbB4 can be combined with portions of ErbB1 through an SI linking domain to create a chimeric binding molecule that binds ligands to both of the combined receptors. Thus, the combination of ErbB1 and ErbB4 domains can be used to produce a chimeric binding molecule that has affinity for both heregulin (ErbB4 specific ligand) and TGFα (ErbB1 specific ligand). The switch in the amino acid sequence from one receptor type to another can be at any suitable location that provides for broad spectrum and high affinity binding of ErbB ligands. In some embodiments the switch can occur in the SI sub-domain which links LI and LII sub-domains. In some embodiments the switch will occur in regions where amino acid sequences are homologous or identical between the receptors being combined, such as in module 5 of the SI sub-domain. For purposes of this disclosure the term “homology” is intended to mean a region of amino acid sequence having identical or conservative amino acid substitutions as that term is generally understood in the art. For example with respect to an ErbB4/ErbB1 chimera, as shown in FIG. 3, a switch from the ErbB4 to the ErbB1 sequence can take place in module 5 of the SI sub-domain such that the sequence ending in VYNP from the ErbB4 sequence is followed by TTYQ from the ErbB1 sequence, as shown by the highlighted sequence in FIG. 3. The sequence can extend as far into the ErbB1 LII domain as is required for ErbB1 ligand binding. The entire ErbB1 LII domain can be included and a portion or all of the subsequent SII region from ErbB1 can also be included. FIG. 3 shows an ectodomain amino acid alignment of the LI, SI, LII and module 1 of the SII domain of ErbB4 and ErbB1, ending at amino acid 501 of ErbB1. With reference to FIG. 3, one chimeric ErbB embodiment is shown in which subdomain LI is derived from ErbB4; the SI region is derived from a portion of the SI region of ErbB4 and switches to a portion of the SI region of the ErbB1 in module 5. This sequence continues on to include the ErbB1 LII subdomain and module 1 of the ErbB1 SII domain. This can be designated as follows: LI (ErbB4)-SI (ErbB4/ErbB1)-LII (ErbB1)-SIIm1 (ErbB1). More specifically: LI (ErbB4 amino acids 1-245)-SI (ErbB1 starting with amino acid 249)-LII (ErbB1)-SIIm1 (ErbB1 ending with amino acid 501 according to the numbering of native ErbB1). All of the amino acid numbering in this application is intended to,be exclusive of the native signal peptide. In certain embodiments the SI domain can be composed of portions of each of the two sub-domains, as indicated previously. Further, it is also possible to introduce substitutions into the amino acid sequence for a variety of purposes. For example, the DNA sequence for the chimeric binding molecule can be changed to remove cysteines so that the formation of aggregates through cysteine-cysteine bonds can be avoided. Substitutions of amino acids in one subdomain can be used to modify ligand binding affinities. For example, an amino acid from ErbB1 can be substituted into the ErbB4 LI subdomain to make that domain's sequence more like that of ErbB1 in order to modify the affinity of the molecule to ErbB ligands. Similarly, amino acid substitutions from ErbB3 or 4 LII subdomains can be included into the ErbB1 subdomain. Such substitutions can also be made in the SI and SII subdomains. Although any number of such substitutions can be considered substitutions of glutamine from ErbB1 for serine in the ErbB4 portion at position 13, tyrosine for serine at position 42, arginine for tyrosine at position 123 are representative examples. Other examples can be identified by one of skill in the art simply by comparing sequences. Substitutions that are not homologous can also be considered. For example, asparagine could be substituted for serine at position 13 rather than the glutamine found in ErbB1 or a residue that has intermediate characteristics of the residues found in both receptors may be used. Any of these chimeric molecules could also be fused to other molecules or portions thereof including: other chimeric receptors (of any growth factor receptor family) or to sequences that facilitate purification of the product. The DNA sequences can be obtained from commercial sources and placed in any suitable expression vector and expressed from suitable hosts of which many are known. In one embodiment the ErbB chimera can be fused with components that cause aggregative conjugate formation or extend protein half-life. For example, the ErbB chimera can be fused to the constant region of immunoglobulin molecule such as the Fc region of IgG. For purposes of this disclosure one suitable Fc region is known as IgG2Fc, although others are also known in the art and can be used. For purposes of this application suitable binding affinities are affinities that are high enough to bind ErbB ligands in a physiological matrix. Preferably, dissociation constants will be no higher than about 10-fold to about 100-fold above the dissociation constants of the native receptors. More preferably, the dissociation constants for the ErbB chimera will be within 10-fold of their native receptor counterparts and more preferably within the same order of magnitude. Most preferably the binding affinities of the chimeric molecules will not be distinguishable from the native counterparts. Any affinity that is sufficient to bind and sequester ErbB ligands to thereby prevent or interfere with ligand binding and activating ErbB receptors is suitable for use and can find use in the disclosed methods. Binding affinity, which is a proxy for inhibitor potency, of the binding molecules can be measured using biosensor technology or by classic binding assays such as ELISA which are well known in the art. DNA that encodes the chimeric ErbB ligand binding molecule sequences is also contemplated. One of skill can appreciate that the genetic code can be used to prepare suitable DNA sequences and codon preferences for specific expression hosts can also be incorporated into such sequences. Also contemplated for use with these sequences are additional DNA sequences that can be used for the expression of these DNA sequences. A variety of these are known. As is well known in the art such sequences can also be introduced into host cells for the maintenance of the DNA and for its expression and such hosts that include these DNA sequences are also contemplated. Pharmaceutical compositions comprising a disclosed chimeric ErbB ligand binding molecule are also contemplated. Such compositions comprise a therapeutically effective amount of a chimeric ErbB ligand binding molecule, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The term “pharmaceutically acceptable” means approved by a regulatory agency of the Federal or a state government or listed in the U.S. Pharmacopeia or other generally recognized pharmacopeia for use in animals, and more particularly, in humans. The term “carrier” refers to a diluent, adjuvant, excipient, or vehicle in which the therapeutic is administered. Such pharmaceutical carriers can be sterile liquids, such as water and oils, including those of petroleum, animal, vegetable or synthetic origin, such as peanut oil, soybean oil, mineral oil, sesame oil and the like. Suitable pharmaceutical excipients include starch, glucose, lactose, sucrose, gelatin, malt, rice, flour, chalk, silica gel, sodium stearate, glycerol monostearate, talc, sodium chloride, dried skim milk, glycerol, propylene, glycol, water, ethanol and the like in which the chimeric ErbB ligand binding molecule is soluble and is chemically stable. The composition can also contain wetting or emulsifying agents, or pH buffering agents. These compositions can take the form of solutions, suspensions, emulsion, tablets, pills, capsules, powders, sustained-release formulations and the like. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include other ingredients for use in formulations such as DPPC, DOPE, DSPC and DOPC. Natural or synthetic surfactants may be used. PEG may be used (even apart from its use in derivatizing the protein or analog). Dextrans, such as cyclodextran, may be used. Cellulose and cellulose derivatives may be used. Amino acids may be used, such as use in a buffered formulation. Pharmaceutically acceptable diluents include buffers having various contents (e.g., Tris-HCl, acetate, phosphate), pH and ionic strength; additives such as detergents and solubilizing agents (e.g., Polysorbate 80), anti-oxidants (e.g., ascorbic acid, sodium metabisulfite), preservatives (e.g., benzyl alcohol) and bulking substances (e.g., lactose, mannitol); incorporation of the material into particulate preparations of polymeric compounds such as polylactic acid, polyglycolic acid, etc. or into liposomes. Hyaluronic acid may also be used, and this may have the effect of promoting sustained duration in the circulation. Such compositions may influence the physical state, stability, rate of in vivo release, and rate of in vivo clearance of the present proteins and derivatives. See, e.g., Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th Ed. (1990, Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa. 18042) pages 1435-1712 which are herein incorporated by reference. The compositions may be prepared in liquid form, or may be in dried powder, such as lyophilized form. Implantable sustained release formulations are also contemplated, as are transdermal formulations. Liposome, microcapsule or microsphere, inclusion complexes, or other types of carriers are also contemplated. The amount of the active chimeric binding molecule that will be effective for its intended therapeutic use can be determined by standard clinical techniques. In addition, in vitro assays may optionally be employed to help identify optimal dosage ranges. Generally, the daily regimen should be in the range of 0.1-1000 micrograms of the active agent (API) kilogram of body weight, preferably 0.1-150 micrograms per kilogram. Effective doses may be extrapolated from dose-response curves derived from in vitro or suitable animal model test systems. Dosage amount and interval may be adjusted individually to provide plasma levels of the compounds that are sufficient to maintain therapeutic effect. In cases of local administration or selective uptake, the effective local concentration of the compounds may not be related to plasma concentration. The dosage regimen involved in a method for treatment can be determined by the attending physician, considering various factors which modify the action of drugs, e.g. the age, condition, body weight, sex and diet of the patient, the severity of disease, time of administration and other clinical factors. The amount of compound administered will, of course, be dependent on the subject being treated, on the subject's weight, the severity of the affliction, the manner of administration, and the judgment of the prescribing physician. The therapy may be repeated intermittently while symptoms are detectable or even when they are not detectable. The therapy may be provided alone or in combination with other drugs. A method for treating a patient in need of treatment is disclosed that includes obtaining a chimeric ErbB ligand binding molecule that binds ErbB ligands and interferes with the interaction and effect of ligands on the ErbB receptor system of cancer cells, and administering a therapeutically effective amount of the molecule to a patient. Administration can be by parenteral routes such as i.v. administration, direct injection into a solid tumor such as through a syringe or catheter or by i.p. injection. In one method of treatment the chimeric ErbB ligand binding molecules can be immobilized to a solid support such as an apheresis or biocore support by standard methods. When the binding molecule is immobilized to a solid support the serum, blood or other biologically relevant fluid of a patient can be placed in contact with the solid support in the apheresis column to remove ErbB ligands from the fluid. The serum, blood or fluid can then be reintroduced into the patient. The binding molecules can also be used in combination therapies. Thus, the chimeric ErbB ligand binding molecule may be administered in combination with one or more additional compounds or therapies, including chemotherapeutic agents, surgery, catheter devices, and radiation. Combination therapy includes administration of a single pharmaceutical dosage formulation which contains a chimeric ErbB ligand binding molecule and one or more additional agents. The chimeric ErbB ligand binding molecule and one or more additional agent(s) can be administered in their own separate pharmaceutical dosage formulations or together in the same formulation. For example, a chimeric ErbB ligand binding molecule and a cytotoxic agent, a chemotherapeutic agent or a growth inhibitory agent can be administered to the patient together in a single dosage composition or each agent can be administered in a separate dosage formulation. More specifically, the chimeric ErbB ligand binding molecule can be used in combination therapies that include therapeutic agents such as Lapatinib®, Herceptin®, Erbitux® and the like. Where separate dosage formulations are used, the chimeric ErbB ligand binding molecules and one or more additional agents can be administered concurrently, or at separately staggered times, i.e., sequentially. One of skill in the art can appreciate that the combination must be such that the chimeric ErbB ligand binding molecule does not interfere, but rather, accentuates the second therapeutic in the combination. The following examples are given by way of illustration only and in no way should be construed as limiting the subject matter of the present application. In the following examples, nucleotide sequences that encode the disclosed amino acid sequences are also contemplated. Many of the following examples disclose the sequence for IgG2Fc fused to the ErbB chimera. It should be appreciated that use of IgGFc is optional. In addition, the conservative replacement of an amino acid with another similar amino acid that does not substantially (about 10-fold) interfere with ligand binding activity is specifically contemplated. Conventional binding studies of the purified products can be used to determine whether substantial differences in binding affinities exist. Many of the structures described below can be better understood by reference to the diagrams of those structures in FIGS. 1 and 2. All sequences include a signal peptide derived from a mouse antibody heavy chain gene. All numbering is exclusive of the signal peptide, and the first amino acid of each ErbB sequence is underlined. EXAMPLE 1 The present example specifically discloses a chimera containing a signal peptide (M E W S W V F L F F L S V T T G V H S) joined to the LI subdomain of the ErbB3 receptor and the SI and LII subdomains of the ErbB1 receptor terminating after residue 501 in module 1 of the ErbB1 SII sub-domain.

Four constructs were tested for binding to HRG1β and TGFα including the construct from Example 19 (Seq ID No. 19), designated for purposes of this example as E1/E4-Fc, and the construct from Example 20 (Seq ID No. 20) which is designated E1/E4-MFc. The controls included amino acids 1-501 of ErbB1 joined to the IgG2Fc portion, designated E1 and amino acids 1-497 of ErbB4 joined to the IgG2Fc portion, designated E4. In some studies another E1 control was used. Trap DNA molecules were synthesized by starting with the desired amino acid sequence and optimizing the DNA sequence for mammalian system expression. Trap DNA sequences were cloned into a suitable mammalian expression vector (pCpGfree-vitroHmcs) that can be selected using hygromycin and contains MAR/SAR sequences (insulator and boundary regions) and promoters and enhancers for trap expression. Vectors containing trap sequences were transfected into CHO cells by standard transfection methods and the cells were selected for vector integration with hygromycin. Traps were purified from stably transfected cell lines by collecting cell culture medium and purifying by standard methods (protein A column binding). Traps were eluted from protein A by standard methods and quantitated using a custom derived IgG-Fc sandwich ELISA assay. Traps were purified using protein A and run on a polyacrylamide gel, under non-reducing (NR) and reducing (R) conditions. Disulfide linked dimers run at approximately 220-240 kDa, while reduced monomers run at 120-130 kDa. The chimeric trap monomer with mutated cysteines that prevent disulfide formation runs at approximately 120-130 kDa under both non-reducing and reducing conditions. The E1-Fc, E4-Fc, E1/E4-Fc appeared to be in the 220-240 kDa range when run under nonreducing conditions and in the range of about 120-130 when run under reducing conditions. The E1/E4-Fc construct appeared to have molecular weight of about 120-130 under both nonreducing and reducing conditions. Purified trap molecules were coated on 96 well plates and incubated with either TGFα or HRG1β. Then detection antibodies against TGFα or HRG1β were used to measure the affinity (Kd) and amount of bound ligand (Bmax). Traps were coated on 96 well plates and incubated with varying concentrations of either TGFα or HRG1β. Detection antibodies against TGFα or HRG1β were used to measure the affinity (Kd) and amount of bound ligand (Bmax). Data obtained in these studies is provided in Tables 1-4 below. As set forth in Tables 1 and 2, the chimeric monomer (E1/E4-Fc) bound TGFα with an affinity in the range of about 400-620 nM and ErbB1-IgGFc (E1-Fc) bound with an affinity (Kd) in the range of about 27-40 nM.

This example demonstrates that ErbB chimeras can be created and purified that have substantial affinity for ligands to both of its receptor subcomponents. Further this example shows that mutations can be introduced into the chimeric receptor binding molecules to change disulfides to prevent the formation of dimers through disulfide bond formation.

The fusion also includes IgG2-Fc as in the sequences above. Also incorporated into this sequence is a substitution of glutamine for serine at position 13 and the two cysteine to serine modifications from example 20 that prevent disulfide based dimerization of the molecule.
