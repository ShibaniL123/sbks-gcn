FIELD OF THE INVENTION Described herein are compounds, including pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates, metabolites, prodrugs thereof, methods of making such compounds, pharmaceutical compositions comprising such compounds, and methods of using such compounds to treat, prevent or diagnose diseases or conditions that are estrogen sensitive, estrogen receptor dependent or estrogen receptor mediated. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The estrogen receptor (“ER”) is a ligand-activated transcriptional regulatory protein that mediates induction of a variety of biological effects through its interaction with endogenous estrogens. Endogenous estrogens include 17β-estradiol and estrones. ER has been found to have two isoforms, ER-α and ER-β. Estrogens and estrogen receptors are implicated in a number of diseases or conditions, such as breast cancer, lung cancer, ovarian cancer, colon cancer, prostate cancer, endometrial cancer, uterine cancer, as well as others diseases or conditions. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In one aspect, presented herein are compounds of Formula (I), (II), (III), (IV), (V), (VI), (VII), and (VIII) that diminish the effects of estrogens with estrogen receptors and/or lower the concentrations of estrogen receptors, and therefore, are useful as agents for the treatment or prevention of diseases or conditions in which the actions of estrogens and/or estrogen receptors are involved in the etiology or pathology of the disease or condition, or contribute to at least one symptom of the disease or condition and wherein such actions of estrogens and/or estrogen receptors are undesirable. In some embodiments, compounds disclosed herein are estrogen receptor degrader compounds. In one aspect, a compound of Formula (I), (II), (III), (IV), (V), (VI), (VII), or (VIII) is useful for the treatment of ER-related diseases or conditions including, but not limited to, ER-α dysfunction associated with cancer (bone cancer, breast cancer, lung cancer, colorectal cancer, endometrial cancer, prostate cancer, ovarian and uterine cancer), central nervous system (CNS) defects (alcoholism, migraine), cardiovascular system defects (aortic aneurysm, susceptibility to myocardial infarction, aortic valve sclerosis, cardiovascular disease, coronary artery disease, hypertension), hematological system defects (deep vein thrombosis), immune and inflammation diseases (Graves' Disease, arthritis, multiple sclerosis, cirrhosis), susceptibility to infection (hepatitis B, chronic liver disease), metabolic defects (bone density, cholestasis, hypospadias, obesity, osteoarthritis, osteopenia, osteoporosis), neurological defects (Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, migraine, vertigo), psychiatric defects (anorexia nervosa, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), dementia, major depressive disorder, psychosis), uterine diseases (e.g. leiomyoma, uterine leiomyoma, endometrial hyperplasia, endometriosis), and reproductive defects (age of menarche, endometriosis, infertility). In one aspect, described herein are compounds of Formula (I), (II), (III), (IV), (V), (VI), (VII), and (VIII), pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates, metabolites and prodrugs thereof. Compounds described herein are estrogen receptor modulators. In some embodiments, the compound of Formula (I), (II), (III), (IV), (V), (VI), (VII), or (VIII) is an estrogen receptor antagonist.

It should be understood, however, that the detailed description and the specific examples, while indicating specific embodiments, are given by way of illustration only, since various changes and modifications within the spirit and scope of the instant disclosure will become apparent to those skilled in the art from this detailed description DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Estrogen receptor alpha (ER-α; NR3A1) and estrogen receptor beta (ER-β; NR3A2) are steroid hormone receptors, which are members of the large nuclear receptor superfamily. Nuclear receptors share a common modular structure, which minimally includes a DNA binding domain (DBD) and a ligand binding domain (LBD). Steroid hormone receptors are soluble, intracellular proteins that act as ligand-regulated transcription factors. Vertebrates contain five closely related steroid hormone receptors (estrogen receptor, androgen receptor, progesterone receptor, glucocorticoid receptor, mineralcorticoid receptor), which regulate a wide spectrum of reproductive, metabolic and developmental activities. The activities of ER are controlled by the binding of endogenous estrogens, including 17β-estradiol and estrones. The ER-α gene is located on 6q25.1 and encodes a 595 AA protein. The ER-β gene resides on chromosome 14q23.3 and produces a 530 AA protein. However, due to alternative splicing and translation start sites, each of these genes can give rise to multiple isoforms. In addition to the DNA binding domain (called C domain) and ligand binding domain (E domain) these receptors contain an N-terminal (A/B) domain, a hinge (D) domain that links the C and E domains, and a C-terminal extension (F domain) (Gronemeyer and Laudet; Protein Profile 2: 1173-1308, 1995). While the C and E domains of ER-α and ER-β are quite conserved (95% and 55% amino acid identity, respectively), conservation of the A/B, D and F domains is poor (below 30% amino acid identity). Both receptors are involved in the regulation and development of the female reproductive tract but also play various roles in the central nervous system, cardiovascular systems and bone metabolism. The ligand binding pocket of steroid hormone receptors is deeply buried within the ligand binding domain. Upon binding, the ligand becomes part of the hydrophobic core of this domain. Consequently most steroid hormone receptors are instable in the absence of hormone and require assistance from chaperones, such as Hsp90, in order to maintain hormone-binding competency. The interaction with Hsp90 also controls nuclear translocation of these receptors. Ligand-binding stabilizes the receptor and initiates sequential conformational changes that release the chaperones, alter the interactions between the various receptor domains and remodel protein interaction surfaces that allow these receptors to translocate into the nucleus, bind DNA and engage in interactions with chromatin remodeling complexes and the transcriptional machinery. Although ER can interact with Hsp90, this interaction is not required for hormone binding and, dependent on the cellular context, apo-ER can be both cytoplasmic and nuclear. Biophysical studies indicated that DNA binding rather than ligand binding contributes to the stability of the receptor (Greenfield et al., Biochemistry 40: 6646-6652, 2001). ER can interact with DNA either directly by binding to a specific DNA sequence motif called estrogen response element (ERE) (classical pathway), or indirectly via protein-protein interactions (nonclassical pathway) (Welboren et al., Endocrine-Related Cancer 16: 1073-1089, 2009). In the nonclassical pathway, ER has been shown to tether to other transcription factors including SP-1, AP-1 and NF-κB. These interactions appear to play critical roles in the ability of ER to regulate cell proliferation and differentiation. Both types of ER DNA interactions can result in gene activation or repression dependent on the transcriptional coregulators that are recruited by the respective ER-ERE complex (Klinge, Steroid 65: 227-251, 2000). The recruitment of coregulators is primarily mediated by two protein interaction surfaces, the AF2 and AF1. AF2 is located in the ER E-domain and its conformation is directly regulated by the ligand (Brzozowski et al., Nature 389: 753-758, 1997). Full agonists appear to promote the recruitment of co-activators, whereas weak agonists and antagonists facilitate the binding of co-repressors. The regulation of protein with the AF1 is less well understood but can be controlled by serine phosphorylation (Ward and Weigel, Biofactors 35: 528-536, 2009). One of the involved phosphorylation sites (S118) appears to control the transcriptional activity of ER in the presence of antagonists such as tamoxifen, which plays an important role in the treatment of breast cancer. While full agonists appear to arrest ER in certain conformation, weak agonists tend to maintain ER in equilibrium between different conformations, allowing cell-dependent differences in co-regulator repertoires to modulate the activity of ER in a cell-dependent manner (Tamrazi et al., Mol. Endocrinol. 17: 2593-2602, 2003). Interactions of ER with DNA are dynamic and include, but are not limited to, the degradation of ER by the proteasome (Reid et al., Mol Cell 11: 695-707, 2003). The degradation of ER with ligands provides an attractive treatment strategy for disease or conditions that estrogen-sensitive and/or resistant to available anti-hormonal treatments. ER signaling is crucial for the development and maintenance of female reproductive organs including breasts, ovulation and thickening of the endometrium. ER signaling also has a role in bone mass, lipid metabolism, cancers, etc. About 70% of breast cancers express ER-α (ER-α positive) and are dependent on estrogens for growth and survival. Other cancers also are thought to be dependent on ER-α signaling for growth and survival, such as for example ovarian and endometrial cancers. The ER-α antagonist tamoxifen has been used to treat early and advanced ER-α positive breast cancer in both pre- and post-menopausal women. Fulvestrant (Faslodex™) a steroid-based ER antagonist is used to treat breast cancer in women which has have progressed despite therapy with tamoxifen. Steroidal and non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors are also used to treat cancers in humans. In some embodiments, the steroidal and non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors block the production of estrogen from androstenedione and testosterone in post-menopausal women, thereby blocking ER dependent growth in the cancers. In addition to these anti-hormonal agents, progressive ER positive breast cancer is treated in some cases with a variety of other chemotherapeutics, such as for example, the anthracylines, platins, taxanes. In some cases, ER positive breast cancers that harbor genetic amplication of the ERB-B/HER2 tyrosine kinase receptor are treated with the monoclonal antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin™) or the small molecule pan-ERB-B inhibitor lapatinib. Despite this battery of anti-hormonal, chemotherapeutic and small-molecule and antibody-based targeted therapies, many women with ER-α positive breast develop progressive metastatic disease and are in need of new therapies. Importantly, the majority of ER positive tumors that progress on existing anti-hormonal, as well as and other therapies, are thought to remain dependent on ER-α for growth and survival. Thus, there is a need for new ER-α targeting agents that have activity in the setting of metastatic disease and acquired resistance. In one aspect, described herein are compounds that are selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs). In specific embodiments, the SERMs described herein are selective estrogen receptor degraders (SERDs). In some embodiments, in cell-based assays the compounds described herein result in a reduction in steady state ER-α levels (i.e. ER degradation) and are useful in the treatment of estrogen sensitive diseases or conditions and/or diseases or conditions that have developed resistant to anti-hormonal therapies.

A detailed description of techniques applicable to the creation of protecting groups and their removal are described in Greene and Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 3rd Ed., John Wiley & Sons, New York, N.Y., 1999, and Kocienski, Protective Groups, Thieme Verlag, New York, N.Y., 1994, which are incorporated herein by reference for such disclosure. Further Forms of Compounds In one aspect, compounds described herein possess one or more stereocenters and each stereocenter exists independently in either the R or S configuration. The compounds presented herein include all diastereomeric, enantiomeric, and epimeric forms as well as the appropriate mixtures thereof. The compounds and methods provided herein include all cis, trans, syn, anti, entgegen (E), and zusammen (Z) isomers as well as the appropriate mixtures thereof. In certain embodiments, compounds described herein are prepared as their individual stereoisomers by reacting a racemic mixture of the compound with an optically active resolving agent to form a pair of diastereoisomeric compounds/salts, separating the diastereomers and recovering the optically pure enantiomers. In some embodiments, resolution of enantiomers is carried out using covalent diastereomeric derivatives of the compounds described herein. In another embodiment, diastereomers are separated by separation/resolution techniques based upon differences in solubility. In other embodiments, separation of steroisomers is performed by chromatography or by the forming diastereomeric salts and separation by recrystallization, or chromatography, or any combination thereof.

The methods and compositions described herein include the use of amorphous forms as well as crystalline forms (also known as polymorphs). In one aspect, compounds described herein are in the form of pharmaceutically acceptable salts. As well, active metabolites of these compounds having the same type of activity are included in the scope of the present disclosure. In addition, the compounds described herein can exist in unsolvated as well as solvated forms with pharmaceutically acceptable solvents such as water, ethanol, and the like. The solvated forms of the compounds presented herein are also considered to be disclosed herein. In some embodiments, compounds described herein are prepared as prodrugs. A “prodrug” refers to an agent that is converted into the parent drug in vivo. Prodrugs are often useful because, in some situations, they may be easier to administer than the parent drug. They may, for instance, be bioavailable by oral administration whereas the parent is not. The prodrug may also have improved solubility in pharmaceutical compositions over the parent drug. In some embodiments, the design of a prodrug increases the effective water solubility. An example, without limitation, of a prodrug is a compound described herein, which is administered as an ester (the “prodrug”) but then is metabolically hydrolyzed to provide the active entity. In some embodiments, the active entity is a phenolic compound as described herein. A further example of a prodrug might be a short peptide (polyaminoacid) bonded to an acid group where the peptide is metabolized to reveal the active moiety. In certain embodiments, upon in vivo administration, a prodrug is chemically converted to the biologically, pharmaceutically or therapeutically active form of the compound. In certain embodiments, a prodrug is enzymatically metabolized by one or more steps or processes to the biologically, pharmaceutically or therapeutically active form of the compound. Prodrugs of the compounds described herein include, but are not limited to, esters, ethers, carbonates, thiocarbonates, N-acyl derivatives, N-acyloxyalkyl derivatives, quaternary derivatives of tertiary amines, N-Mannich bases, Schiff bases, amino acid conjugates, phosphate esters, and sulfonate esters.

Ed., Elseview, 1985 and Method in Enzymology, Widder, K. et al., Ed.; Academic, 1985, vol. 42, p. 309-396; Bundgaard, H. “Design and Application of Prodrugs” in A Textbook of Drug Design and Development, Krosgaard-Larsen and H. Bundgaard, Ed., 1991, Chapter 5, p. 113-191; and Bundgaard, H., Advanced Drug Delivery Review, 1992, 8, 1-38, each of which is incorporated herein by reference. In some embodiments, a hydroxyl group in the compounds disclosed herein is used to form a prodrug, wherein the hydroxyl group is incorporated into an acyloxyalkyl ester, alkoxycarbonyloxyalkyl ester, alkyl ester, aryl ester, phosphate ester, sugar ester, ether, and the like. Prodrug forms of the herein described compounds, wherein the prodrug is metabolized in vivo to produce a compound of Formula (I), (II), (III), (IV), (V), (VI), (VII), or (VIII) as set forth herein are included within the scope of the claims. In some cases, some of the herein-described compounds may be a prodrug for another derivative or active compound. In some embodiments, sites on the aromatic ring portion of compounds described herein are susceptible to various metabolic reactions. Incorporation of appropriate substituents on the aromatic ring structures will reduce, minimize or eliminate this metabolic pathway. In specific embodiments, the appropriate substituent to decrease or eliminate the susceptibility of the aromatic ring to metabolic reactions is, by way of example only, a halogen, deuterium or an alkyl group. In another embodiment, the compounds described herein are labeled isotopically (e.g. with a radioisotope) or by another other means, including, but not limited to, the use of chromophores or fluorescent moieties, bioluminescent labels, or chemiluminescent labels. Compounds described herein include isotopically-labeled compounds, which are identical to those recited in the various formulae and structures presented herein, but for the fact that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature.

In one aspect, isotopically-labeled compounds described herein, for example those into which radioactive isotopes such as 3H and 14C are incorporated, are useful in drug and/or substrate tissue distribution assays. In one aspect, substitution with isotopes such as deuterium affords certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, such as, for example, increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements. In some embodiments, one or more hydrogen atoms that are present in the compounds described herein is replaced with one or more deuterium atoms. In additional or further embodiments, the compounds described herein are metabolized upon administration to an organism in need to produce a metabolite that is then used to produce a desired effect, including a desired therapeutic effect. “Pharmaceutically acceptable,” as used herein, refers a material, such as a carrier or diluent, which does not abrogate the biological activity or properties of the compound, and is relatively nontoxic, i.e., the material may be administered to an individual without causing undesirable biological effects or interacting in a deleterious manner with any of the components of the composition in which it is contained.

The terms “co-administration” or the like, as used herein, are meant to encompass administration of the selected therapeutic agents to a single patient, and are intended to include treatment regimens in which the agents are administered by the same or different route of administration or at the same or different time. The terms “effective amount” or “therapeutically effective amount,” as used herein, refer to a sufficient amount of an agent or a compound being administered which will relieve to some extent one or more of the symptoms of the disease or condition being treated. The result can be reduction and/or alleviation of the signs, symptoms, or causes of a disease, or any other desired alteration of a biological system. For example, an “effective amount” for therapeutic uses is the amount of the composition comprising a compound as disclosed herein required to provide a clinically significant decrease in disease symptoms. An appropriate “effective” amount in any individual case may be determined using techniques, such as a dose escalation study. The terms “enhance” or “enhancing,” as used herein, means to increase or prolong either in potency or duration a desired effect. Thus, in regard to enhancing the effect of therapeutic agents, the term “enhancing” refers to the ability to increase or prolong, either in potency or duration, the effect of other therapeutic agents on a system. An “enhancing-effective amount,” as used herein, refers to an amount adequate to enhance the effect of another therapeutic agent in a desired system. The term “pharmaceutical combination” as used herein, means a product that results from the mixing or combining of more than one active ingredient and includes both fixed and non-fixed combinations of the active ingredients. The term “fixed combination” means that the active ingredients, e.g. a compound of Formula (I), (II), (III), (IV), (V), (VI), (VII), or (VIII), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and a co-agent, are both administered to a patient simultaneously in the form of a single entity or dosage. The term “non-fixed combination” means that the active ingredients, e.g. a compound of Formula (I), (II), (III), (IV), (V), (VI), (VII), or (VIII), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and a co-agent, are administered to a patient as separate entities either simultaneously, concurrently or sequentially with no specific intervening time limits, wherein such administration provides effective levels of the two compounds in the body of the patient. The latter also applies to cocktail therapy, e.g. the administration of three or more active ingredients. The terms “kit” and “article of manufacture” are used as synonyms. A “metabolite” of a compound disclosed herein is a derivative of that compound that is formed when the compound is metabolized. The term “active metabolite” refers to a biologically active derivative of a compound that is formed when the compound is metabolized. The term “metabolized,” as used herein, refers to the sum of the processes (including, but not limited to, hydrolysis reactions and reactions catalyzed by enzymes) by which a particular substance is changed by an organism. Thus, enzymes may produce specific structural alterations to a compound. For example, cytochrome P450 catalyzes a variety of oxidative and reductive reactions while uridine diphosphate glucuronyltransferases catalyze the transfer of an activated glucuronic-acid molecule to aromatic alcohols, aliphatic alcohols, carboxylic acids, amines and free sulphydryl groups. Metabolites of the compounds disclosed herein are optionally identified either by administration of compounds to a host and analysis of tissue samples from the host, or by incubation of compounds with hepatic cells in vitro and analysis of the resulting compounds. The term “subject” or “patient” encompasses mammals. Examples of mammals include, but are not limited to, any member of the Mammalian class: humans, non-human primates such as chimpanzees, and other apes and monkey species; farm animals such as cattle, horses, sheep, goats, swine; domestic animals such as rabbits, dogs, and cats; laboratory animals including rodents, such as rats, mice and guinea pigs, and the like. In one aspect, the mammal is a human. The terms “treat,” “treating” or “treatment,” as used herein, include alleviating, abating or ameliorating at least one symptom of a disease or condition, preventing additional symptoms, inhibiting the disease or condition, e.g., arresting the development of the disease or condition, relieving the disease or condition, causing regression of the disease or condition, relieving a condition caused by the disease or condition, or stopping the symptoms of the disease or condition either prophylactically and/or therapeutically. Routes of Administration Suitable routes of administration include, but are not limited to, oral, intravenous, rectal, aerosol, parenteral, ophthalmic, pulmonary, transmucosal, transdermal, vaginal, otic, nasal, and topical administration. In addition, by way of example only, parenteral delivery includes intramuscular, subcutaneous, intravenous, intramedullary injections, as well as intrathecal, direct intraventricular, intraperitoneal, intralymphatic, and intranasal injections. In certain embodiments, a compound as described herein is administered in a local rather than systemic manner, for example, via injection of the compound directly into an organ, often in a depot preparation or sustained release formulation. In specific embodiments, long acting formulations are administered by implantation (for example subcutaneously or intramuscularly) or by intramuscular injection. Furthermore, in other embodiments, the drug is delivered in a targeted drug delivery system, for example, in a liposome coated with organ-specific antibody. In such embodiments, the liposomes are targeted to and taken up selectively by the organ. In yet other embodiments, the compound as described herein is provided in the form of a rapid release formulation, in the form of an extended release formulation, or in the form of an intermediate release formulation. In yet other embodiments, the compound described herein is administered topically. Pharmaceutical Compositions/Formulations In some embodiments, the compounds described herein are formulated into pharmaceutical compositions. Pharmaceutical compositions are formulated in a conventional manner using one or more pharmaceutically acceptable inactive ingredients that facilitate processing of the active compounds into preparations that can be used pharmaceutically.

The pharmaceutical compositions will include at least one compound of Formula (I), (II), (III), (IV), (V), (VI), (VII), or (VIII) as an active ingredient in free-acid or free-base form, or in a pharmaceutically acceptable salt form. In addition, the methods and pharmaceutical compositions described herein include the use of N-oxides (if appropriate), crystalline forms, amorphous phases, as well as active metabolites of these compounds having the same type of activity. In some embodiments, compounds described herein exist in unsolvated form or in solvated forms with pharmaceutically acceptable solvents such as water, ethanol, and the like. The solvated forms of the compounds presented herein are also considered to be disclosed herein. The pharmaceutical compositions described herein, which include a compound of Formula (I), (II), (III), (IV), (V), (VI), (VII), or (VIII), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, are formulated into any suitable dosage form, including but not limited to, aqueous oral dispersions, liquids, gels, syrups, elixirs, slurries, suspensions, solid oral dosage forms, controlled release formulations, fast melt formulations, effervescent formulations, lyophilized formulations, tablets, powders, pills, dragees, capsules, delayed release formulations, extended release formulations, pulsatile release formulations, multiparticulate formulations, and mixed immediate release and controlled release formulations. Pharmaceutical preparations that are administered orally include push-fit capsules made of gelatin, as well as soft, sealed capsules made of gelatin and a plasticizer, such as glycerol or sorbitol. The push-fit capsules contain the active ingredients in admixture with filler such as lactose, binders such as starches, and/or lubricants such as talc or magnesium stearate and, optionally, stabilizers. In some embodiments, the push-fit capsules do not include any other ingredient besides the capsule shell and the active ingredient. In soft capsules, the active compounds are dissolved or suspended in suitable liquids, such as fatty oils, liquid paraffin, or liquid polyethylene glycols. In some embodiments, stabilizers are added. All formulations for oral administration are in dosages suitable for such administration. In one aspect, solid oral dosage forms are prepared by mixing a compound of Formula (I), (II), (III), (IV), (V), (VI), (VII), or (VIII), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, with one or more of the following: antioxidants, flavoring agents, and carrier materials such as binders, suspending agents, disintegration agents, filling agents, surfactants, solubilizers, stabilizers, lubricants, wetting agents, and diluents. In some embodiments, the solid dosage forms disclosed herein are in the form of a tablet, (including a suspension tablet, a fast-melt tablet, a bite-disintegration tablet, a rapid-disintegration tablet, an effervescent tablet, or a caplet), a pill, a powder, a capsule, solid dispersion, solid solution, bioerodible dosage form, controlled release formulations, pulsatile release dosage forms, multiparticulate dosage forms, beads, pellets, granules. In other embodiments, the pharmaceutical formulation is in the form of a powder. In still other embodiments, the pharmaceutical formulation is in the form of a tablet. In other embodiments, pharmaceutical formulation is in the form of a capsule. In some embodiments, solid dosage forms, e.g., tablets, effervescent tablets, and capsules, are prepared by mixing particles of a compound of Formula (I), (II), (III), (IV), (V), (VI), (VII), or (VIII), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, with one or more pharmaceutical excipients to form a bulk blend composition. The bulk blend is readily subdivided into equally effective unit dosage forms, such as tablets, pills, and capsules. In some embodiments, the individual unit dosages include film coatings. These formulations are manufactured by conventional formulation techniques. Conventional formulation techniques include, e.g., one or a combination of methods: (1) dry mixing, (2) direct compression, (3) milling, (4) dry or non-aqueous granulation, (5) wet granulation, or (6) fusion. Other methods include, e.g., spray drying, pan coating, melt granulation, granulation, fluidized bed spray drying or coating (e.g., wurster coating), tangential coating, top spraying, tableting, extruding and the like. In some embodiments, tablets will include a film surrounding the final compressed tablet. In some embodiments, the film coating can provide a delayed release of the compound of Formula (I), (II), (III), (IV), (V), (VI), (VII), or (VIII), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, from the formulation. In other embodiments, the film coating aids in patient compliance (e.g., Opadry® coatings or sugar coating). Film coatings including Opadry® typically range from about 1% to about 3% of the tablet weight. A capsule may be prepared, for example, by placing the bulk blend of the formulation of the compound described above, inside of a capsule. In some embodiments, the formulations (non-aqueous suspensions and solutions) are placed in a soft gelatin capsule. In other embodiments, the formulations are placed in standard gelatin capsules or non-gelatin capsules such as capsules comprising HPMC. In other embodiments, the formulation is placed in a sprinkle capsule, wherein the capsule is swallowed whole or the capsule is opened and the contents sprinkled on food prior to eating. In various embodiments, the particles of the compound of Formula (I), (II), (III), (IV), (V), (VI), (VII), or (VIII), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and one or more excipients are dry blended and compressed into a mass, such as a tablet, having a hardness sufficient to provide a pharmaceutical composition that substantially disintegrates within less than about 30 minutes, less than about 35 minutes, less than about 40 minutes, less than about 45 minutes, less than about 50 minutes, less than about 55 minutes, or less than about 60 minutes, after oral administration, thereby releasing the formulation into the gastrointestinal fluid. In still other embodiments, effervescent powders are also prepared. Effervescent salts have been used to disperse medicines in water for oral administration. In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical solid oral dosage forms are formulated to provide a controlled release of the active compound. Controlled release refers to the release of the active compound from a dosage form in which it is incorporated according to a desired profile over an extended period of time. Controlled release profiles include, for example, sustained release, prolonged release, pulsatile release, and delayed release profiles. In contrast to immediate release compositions, controlled release compositions allow delivery of an agent to a subject over an extended period of time according to a predetermined profile. Such release rates can provide therapeutically effective levels of agent for an extended period of time and thereby provide a longer period of pharmacologic response while minimizing side effects as compared to conventional rapid release dosage forms. Such longer periods of response provide for many inherent benefits that are not achieved with the corresponding short acting, immediate release preparations. In some embodiments, the solid dosage forms described herein are formulated as enteric coated delayed release oral dosage forms, i.e., as an oral dosage form of a pharmaceutical composition as described herein which utilizes an enteric coating to affect release in the small intestine or large intestine. In one aspect, the enteric coated dosage form is a compressed or molded or extruded tablet/mold (coated or uncoated) containing granules, powder, pellets, beads or particles of the active ingredient and/or other composition components, which are themselves coated or uncoated. In one aspect, the enteric coated oral dosage form is in the form of a capsule containing pellets, beads or granules. Conventional coating techniques such as spray or pan coating are employed to apply coatings. The coating thickness must be sufficient to ensure that the oral dosage form remains intact until the desired site of topical delivery in the intestinal tract is reached. In other embodiments, the formulations described herein are delivered using a pulsatile dosage form. A pulsatile dosage form is capable of providing one or more immediate release pulses at predetermined time points after a controlled lag time or at specific sites. Exemplary pulsatile dosage forms and methods of their manufacture are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,011,692, 5,017,381, 5,229,135, 5,840,329 and 5,837,284. In one embodiment, the pulsatile dosage form includes at least two groups of particles, (i.e. multiparticulate) each containing the formulation described herein. The first group of particles provides a substantially immediate dose of the active compound upon ingestion by a mammal. The first group of particles can be either uncoated or include a coating and/or sealant. In one aspect, the second group of particles comprises coated particles. The coating on the second group of particles provides a delay of from about 2 hours to about 7 hours following ingestion before release of the second dose. Suitable coatings for pharmaceutical compositions are described herein or in the art. In some embodiments, pharmaceutical formulations are provided that include particles of a compound of Formula (I), (II), (III), (IV), (V), (VI), (VII), or (VIII), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and at least one dispersing agent or suspending agent for oral administration to a subject. The formulations may be a powder and/or granules for suspension, and upon admixture with water, a substantially uniform suspension is obtained. In one aspect, liquid formulation dosage forms for oral administration are in the form of aqueous suspensions selected from the group including, but not limited to, pharmaceutically acceptable aqueous oral dispersions, emulsions, solutions, elixirs, gels, and syrups. See, e.g., Singh et al., Encyclopedia of Pharmaceutical Technology, 2nd Ed., pp. 754-757 (2002). In addition to the particles of the compound of Formula (I), the liquid dosage forms include additives, such as: (a) disintegrating agents; (b) dispersing agents; (c) wetting agents; (d) at least one preservative, (e) viscosity enhancing agents, (f) at least one sweetening agent, and (g) at least one flavoring agent. In some embodiments, the aqueous dispersions can further include a crystalline inhibitor. Buccal formulations that include a compound of Formula (I), (II), (III), (IV), (V), (VI), (VII), or (VIII), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, are administered using a variety of formulations known in the art. For example, such formulations include, but are not limited to, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,229,447, 4,596,795, 4,755,386, and 5,739,136. In addition, the buccal dosage forms described herein can further include a bioerodible (hydrolysable) polymeric carrier that also serves to adhere the dosage form to the buccal mucosa. For buccal or sublingual administration, the compositions may take the form of tablets, lozenges, or gels formulated in a conventional manner. In some embodiments, compounds of Formula (I), (II), (III), (IV), (V), (VI), (VII), and (VIII), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, are prepared as transdermal dosage forms. In one embodiment, the transdermal formulations described herein include at least three components: (1) a formulation of a compound of Formula (I), (II), (III), (IV), (V), (VI), (VII), (VIII), (IX), (X), (XI), or (XIII), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof; (2) a penetration enhancer; and (3) an aqueous adjuvant. In some embodiments the transdermal formulations include additional components such as, but not limited to, gelling agents, creams and ointment bases, and the like. In some embodiments, the transdermal formulation further includes a woven or non-woven backing material to enhance absorption and prevent the removal of the transdermal formulation from the skin. In other embodiments, the transdermal formulations described herein can maintain a saturated or supersaturated state to promote diffusion into the skin. In one aspect, formulations suitable for transdermal administration of compounds described herein employ transdermal delivery devices and transdermal delivery patches and can be lipophilic emulsions or buffered, aqueous solutions, dissolved and/or dispersed in a polymer or an adhesive. In one aspect, such patches are constructed for continuous, pulsatile, or on demand delivery of pharmaceutical agents. Still further, transdermal delivery of the compounds described herein can be accomplished by means of iontophoretic patches and the like. In one aspect, transdermal patches provide controlled delivery of the active compound. In one aspect, transdermal devices are in the form of a bandage comprising a backing member, a reservoir containing the compound optionally with carriers, optionally a rate controlling barrier to deliver the compound to the skin of the host at a controlled and predetermined rate over a prolonged period of time, and means to secure the device to the skin. In one aspect, a compound of Formula (I), (II), (III), (IV), (V), (VI), (VII), or (VIII), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, is formulated into a pharmaceutical composition suitable for intramuscular, subcutaneous, or intravenous injection. In one aspect, formulations suitable for intramuscular, subcutaneous, or intravenous injection include physiologically acceptable sterile aqueous or non-aqueous solutions, dispersions, suspensions or emulsions, and sterile powders for reconstitution into sterile injectable solutions or dispersions. Examples of suitable aqueous and non-aqueous carriers, diluents, solvents, or vehicles include water, ethanol, polyols (propyleneglycol, polyethylene-glycol, glycerol, cremophor and the like), vegetable oils and organic esters, such as ethyl oleate. In some embodiments, formulations suitable for subcutaneous injection contain additives such as preserving, wetting, emulsifying, and dispensing agents. Prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form can be brought about by the use of agents delaying absorption, such as aluminum monostearate and gelatin. For intravenous injections, compounds described herein are formulated in aqueous solutions, preferably in physiologically compatible buffers such as Hank's solution, Ringer's solution, or physiological saline buffer. For transmucosal administration, penetrants appropriate to the barrier to be permeated are used in the formulation. Such penetrants are generally known in the art. For other parenteral injections, appropriate formulations include aqueous or nonaqueous solutions, preferably with physiologically compatible buffers or excipients. Such excipients are known. Parenteral injections may involve bolus injection or continuous infusion. Formulations for injection may be presented in unit dosage form, e.g., in ampoules or in multi-dose containers, with an added preservative. The pharmaceutical composition described herein may be in a form suitable for parenteral injection as a sterile suspensions, solutions or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and may contain formulatory agents such as suspending, stabilizing and/or dispersing agents. In one aspect, the active ingredient is in powder form for constitution with a suitable vehicle, e.g., sterile pyrogen-free water, before use. In certain embodiments, delivery systems for pharmaceutical compounds may be employed, such as, for example, liposomes and emulsions. In certain embodiments, compositions provided herein can also include an mucoadhesive polymer, selected from among, for example, carboxymethylcellulose, carbomer (acrylic acid polymer), poly(methylmethacrylate), polyacrylamide, polycarbophil, acrylic acid/butyl acrylate copolymer, sodium alginate and dextran. In some embodiments, the compounds described herein may be administered topically and can be formulated into a variety of topically administrable compositions, such as solutions, suspensions, lotions, gels, pastes, medicated sticks, balms, creams or ointments. Such pharmaceutical compounds can contain solubilizers, stabilizers, tonicity enhancing agents, buffers and preservatives. Methods of Dosing and Treatment Regimens In one embodiment, the compounds of Formula (I), (II), (III), (IV), (V), (VI), (VII), and (VIII), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, are used in the preparation of medicaments for the treatment of diseases or conditions in a mammal that would benefit from a reduction of estrogen receptor activity. Methods for treating any of the diseases or conditions described herein in a mammal in need of such treatment, involves administration of pharmaceutical compositions that include at least one compound of Formula (I), (II), (III), (IV), (V), (VI), (VII), or (VIII), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, active metabolite, prodrug, or pharmaceutically acceptable solvate thereof, in therapeutically effective amounts to said mammal. In certain embodiments, the compositions containing the compound(s) described herein are administered for prophylactic and/or therapeutic treatments. In certain therapeutic applications, the compositions are administered to a patient already suffering from a disease or condition, in an amount sufficient to cure or at least partially arrest at least one of the symptoms of the disease or condition. Amounts effective for this use depend on the severity and course of the disease or condition, previous therapy, the patient's health status, weight, and response to the drugs, and the judgment of the treating physician. Therapeutically effective amounts are optionally determined by methods including, but not limited to, a dose escalation clinical trial. In prophylactic applications, compositions containing the compounds described herein are administered to a patient susceptible to or otherwise at risk of a particular disease, disorder or condition. Such an amount is defined to be a “prophylactically effective amount or dose.” In this use, the precise amounts also depend on the patient's state of health, weight, and the like. When used in a patient, effective amounts for this use will depend on the severity and course of the disease, disorder or condition, previous therapy, the patient's health status and response to the drugs, and the judgment of the treating physician. In one aspect, prophylactic treatments include administering to a mammal, who previously experienced at least one symptom of the disease being treated and is currently in remission, a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of Formula (I), (II), (III), (IV), (V), (VI), (VII), or (VIII), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, in order to prevent a return of the symptoms of the disease or condition. In certain embodiments wherein the patient's condition does not improve, upon the doctor's discretion the administration of the compounds are administered chronically, that is, for an extended period of time, including throughout the duration of the patient's life in order to ameliorate or otherwise control or limit the symptoms of the patient's disease or condition. In certain embodiments wherein a patient's status does improve, the dose of drug being administered may be temporarily reduced or temporarily suspended for a certain length of time (i.e., a “drug holiday”). In specific embodiments, the length of the drug holiday is between 2 days and 1 year, including by way of example only, 2 days, 3 days, 4 days, 5 days, 6 days, 7 days, 10 days, 12 days, 15 days, 20 days, 28 days, or more than 28 days. The dose reduction during a drug holiday is, by way of example only, by 10%-100%, including by way of example only 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, and 100%. Once improvement of the patient's conditions has occurred, a maintenance dose is administered if necessary. Subsequently, in specific embodiments, the dosage or the frequency of administration, or both, is reduced, as a function of the symptoms, to a level at which the improved disease, disorder or condition is retained. In certain embodiments, however, the patient requires intermittent treatment on a long-term basis upon any recurrence of symptoms. The amount of a given agent that corresponds to such an amount varies depending upon factors such as the particular compound, disease condition and its severity, the identity (e.g., weight, sex) of the subject or host in need of treatment, but can nevertheless be determined according to the particular circumstances surrounding the case, including, e.g., the specific agent being administered, the route of administration, the condition being treated, and the subject or host being treated. In general, however, doses employed for adult human treatment are typically in the range of 0.01 mg-5000 mg per day. In one aspect, doses employed for adult human treatment are from about 1 mg to about 1000 mg per day. In one embodiment, the desired dose is conveniently presented in a single dose or in divided doses administered simultaneously or at appropriate intervals, for example as two, three, four or more sub-doses per day. In one embodiment, the daily dosages appropriate for the compound of Formula (I), (II), (III), (IV), (V), (VI), (VII), or (VIII), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, described herein are from about 0.01 to about 10 mg/kg per body weight. In some embodiments, the daily dosage or the amount of active in the dosage form are lower or higher than the ranges indicated herein, based on a number of variables in regard to an individual treatment regime. In various embodiments, the daily and unit dosages are altered depending on a number of variables including, but not limited to, the activity of the compound used, the disease or condition to be treated, the mode of administration, the requirements of the individual subject, the severity of the disease or condition being treated, and the judgment of the practitioner. Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of such therapeutic regimens are determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, including, but not limited to, the determination of the LD50 and the ED50. The dose ratio between the toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it is expressed as the ratio between LD50 and ED50. In certain embodiments, the data obtained from cell culture assays and animal studies are used in formulating the therapeutically effective daily dosage range and/or the therapeutically effective unit dosage amount for use in mammals, including humans. In some embodiments, the daily dosage amount of the compounds described herein lies within a range of circulating concentrations that include the ED50 with minimal toxicity. In certain embodiments, the daily dosage range and/or the unit dosage amount varies within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. Combination Treatments In certain instances, it is appropriate to administer at least one compound of Formula (I), (II), (III), (IV), (V), (VI), (VII), or (VIII), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, in combination with one or more other therapeutic agents. In one embodiment, the therapeutic effectiveness of one of the compounds described herein is enhanced by administration of an adjuvant (i.e., by itself the adjuvant may have minimal therapeutic benefit, but in combination with another therapeutic agent, the overall therapeutic benefit to the patient is enhanced). Or, in some embodiments, the benefit experienced by a patient is increased by administering one of the compounds described herein with another therapeutic agent (which also includes a therapeutic regimen) that also has therapeutic benefit. In one specific embodiment, a compound of Formula (I), (II), (III), (IV), (V), (VI), (VII), or (VIII), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, is co-administered with a second therapeutic agent, wherein the compound of Formula (I), (II), (III), (IV), (V), (VI), (VII), or (VIII), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and the second therapeutic agent modulate different aspects of the disease, disorder or condition being treated, thereby providing a greater overall benefit than administration of either therapeutic agent alone. In any case, regardless of the disease, disorder or condition being treated, the overall benefit experienced by the patient may simply be additive of the two therapeutic agents or the patient may experience a synergistic benefit. In certain embodiments, different therapeutically-effective dosages of the compounds disclosed herein will be utilized in formulating pharmaceutical composition and/or in treatment regimens when the compounds disclosed herein are administered in combination with one or more additional agent, such as an additional therapeutically effective drug, an adjuvant or the like. Therapeutically-effective dosages of drugs and other agents for use in combination treatment regimens can be determined by means similar to those set forth hereinabove for the actives themselves. Furthermore, the methods of prevention/treatment described herein encompasses the use of metronomic dosing, i.e., providing more frequent, lower doses in order to minimize toxic side effects. In some embodiments, a combination treatment regimen encompasses treatment regimens in which administration of a compound of Formula (I), (II), (III), (IV), (V), (VI), (VII), or (VIII), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, is initiated prior to, during, or after treatment with a second agent described herein, and continues until any time during treatment with the second agent or after termination of treatment with the second agent. It also includes treatments in which a compound of Formula (I), (II), (III), (IV), (V), (VI), (VII), or (VIII), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and the second agent being used in combination are administered simultaneously or at different times and/or at decreasing or increasing intervals during the treatment period. Combination treatment further includes periodic treatments that start and stop at various times to assist with the clinical management of the patient. It is understood that the dosage regimen to treat, prevent, or ameliorate the condition(s) for which relief is sought, is modified in accordance with a variety of factors (e.g. the disease, disorder or condition from which the subject suffers; the age, weight, sex, diet, and medical condition of the subject). Thus, in some instances, the dosage regimen actually employed varies and, in some embodiments, deviates from the dosage regimens set forth herein. For combination therapies described herein, dosages of the co-administered compounds vary depending on the type of co-drug employed, on the specific drug employed, on the disease or condition being treated and so forth. In additional embodiments, when co-administered with one or more other therapeutic agents, the compound provided herein is administered either simultaneously with the one or more other therapeutic agents, or sequentially. In combination therapies, the multiple therapeutic agents (one of which is one of the compounds described herein) are administered in any order or even simultaneously. If administration is simultaneous, the multiple therapeutic agents are, by way of example only, provided in a single, unified form, or in multiple forms (e.g., as a single pill or as two separate pills). The compounds of Formula (I), (II), (III), (IV), (V), (VI), (VII), and (VIII), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, as well as combination therapies, are administered before, during or after the occurrence of a disease or condition, and the timing of administering the composition containing a compound varies. Thus, in one embodiment, the compounds described herein are used as a prophylactic and are administered continuously to subjects with a propensity to develop conditions or diseases in order to prevent the occurrence of the disease or condition. In another embodiment, the compounds and compositions are administered to a subject during or as soon as possible after the onset of the symptoms. In specific embodiments, a compound described herein is administered as soon as is practicable after the onset of a disease or condition is detected or suspected, and for a length of time necessary for the treatment of the disease. In some embodiments, the length required for treatment varies, and the treatment length is adjusted to suit the specific needs of each subject. For example, in specific embodiments, a compound described herein or a formulation containing the compound is administered for at least 2 weeks, about 1 month to about 5 years.

A technique for delivering radiation to cancer cells is to place radioactive implants directly in a tumor or body cavity. This is called internal radiotherapy (brachytherapy, interstitial irradiation, and intracavitary irradiation are types of internal radiotherapy.) Using internal radiotherapy, the radiation dose is concentrated in a small area, and the patient stays in the hospital for a few days. Internal radiotherapy is frequently used for cancers of the tongue, uterus, prostate, colon, and cervix. The term “radiotherapy” or “ionizing radiation” include all forms of radiation, including but not limited to α, β, and γ radiation and ultraviolet light.

MCF-7 cells were grown in RPMI containing 10% FBS at 5% CO2, 37° C. Cells were spun down and re-suspended in 50% RPMI (serum free) and 50% Matrigel at 1×107 cells/mL. MCF-7 cells were subcutaneously injected (100 μL/animal) on the right flank 2-3 days post pellet implantation. Tumor volume (length×width2/2) was monitored bi-weekly. When tumors reached an average volume of ˜200 mm3 animals were randomized and treatment was started. Animals were treated with Vehicle or Compound daily for 4 weeks. Tumor volume and body weight were monitored bi-weekly throughout the study. At the conclusion of the treatment period, plasma and tumor samples were taken for pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analyses, respectively. Example 41 Breast Cancer Model; Xenograft Assay (MCF-7 Derivative) Female nu/nu mice (with supplemental 17-β Estradiol pellets; 0.72 mg; 60 day slow release) bearing MCF-7 tumors (mean tumor volume 200 mm3) were treated with Tamoxifen (citrate) by oral gavage. Tumor volume (length×width2/2) and body weight were monitored twice weekly. Following a significant anti-tumor response in which tumor volume remained static, evident tumor growth was first observed at approximately 100 days of treatment. At 120 days of treatment, tamoxifen dose was increased. Rapidly growing tumors were deemed tamoxifen resistant and selected for in vivo passage into new host animals. Tumor Fragments (˜100 mm3/animal) from the tamoxifen resistant tumors were subcutaneously implanted into the right flank of female nu/nu mice (with 17-β Estradiol pellets (0.72 mg; 60 day slow release)). Passaged tumors were maintained under constant Tamoxifen selection, and Tumor volume (length×width2/2) was monitored weekly. When tumor volume reached ˜150-250 mm3, animals were randomized into treatment groups (mean tumor volume 200 mm3) and tamoxifen treatment was terminated (except for a tamoxifen control arm). Animals were treated with Vehicle or Compound daily for 4 weeks. Tumor volume and body weight were monitored twice weekly for the duration of the study.

Example 42 Ovarian Cancer Model; Xenograft Assay (BG-1) Time release pellets (0.72 mg 17-β Estradiol/60 days) were subcutaneously implanted into female nu/nu mice. BG-1 cells were grown in DMEM Ham's F-12 50/50 containing 10% FBS, 10 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 10 mM Non-Essential Amino Acids at 5% CO2, 37° C. Cells were spun down and re-suspended in 50% DMEM Ham's F-12 (serum free) and 50% Matrigel at 5×107 cells/mL. BG-1 cells were subcutaneously injected (100 μL/animal) on the right flank 2-3 days post pellet implantation. Tumor volume (length×width2/2) was monitored bi-weekly. When tumors reached an average volume of ˜250 mm3 animals were randomized and treatment was started. Animals were treated with Vehicle or Compound daily for 4 weeks. Tumor volume and body weight were monitored bi-weekly throughout the study. At the conclusion of the treatment period; plasma and tumor samples were taken for pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analyses, respectively. Example 43 Endometrial Cancer Model; Xenograft Assay (ECC-1) ECC-1 cells were grown in DMEM (phenol red, 4.5 g/L glucose and L-glutamine) containing 10% FBS, 1% Non-Essential Amino Acids and 100 units Penicillin/Streptomycin at 10% CO2, 37° C. Cells were spun down and re-suspended in 50% DMEM (serum free) and 50% Matrigel (BD, high concentration) at 5×107 cells/mL. Time release pellets (0.72 mg 17-β Estradiol/60 days) were subcutaneously implanted into female nu/nu mice. ECC-1 cells were subcutaneously injected (100 μL/animal) on the right flank 2-3 days post pellet implantation. Tumor volume was monitored and when tumors reached a suitable size for transplant they were excised. Excised tumors were cut into small pieces (˜100 mm3) and serially transplanted (10 G trocar, right flank) into female nu/nu containing estradiol pellets (0.72 mg 17-β Estradiol/60 days) for 2-3 days. Tumor volume (length×width×width/2) was monitored and when palpable tumors were observed, animals were randomized and treatment was started. Animals were treated with Vehicle or Compound daily for 4 weeks or until tumor volume reached 2000 mm3 (whichever came first). Tumor volume and body weight were monitored bi-weekly throughout the study. At the conclusion of the treatment period; plasma and tumor samples were taken for pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analyses, respectively. Example 44 Immature Uterine Wet Weight-Antagonist Mode Female immature CD-IGS rats (21 days old upon arrival) were treated for three days. Animals were dosed daily for three days.

On the fourth day 24 hours after dose, plasma was collected for pharmacokinetic analysis. Immediately following plasma collection, the animals were euthanized and the uterus was removed and weighed. Example 46 Adult Uterine Wet Weight-10 Day Female CD-IGS rats (69 days old, Charles River Laboratories) were purchased and split into groups. Group 1 was ovariectomized at the vendor (Charles River Laboratories) at 60 days of age and the study was started 2 weeks after surgery, while groups 2-8 were intact. Vehicle or test compound was administered orally for 10 days. Two hours after the 10th and final dose, cardiac punctures were performed and serum was collected for pharmacokinetic and estradiol analyses. Immediately following serum collection, the animals were euthanized and the uterus and ovaries were removed and weighed. Uteri and ovaries from 2 animals per group were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin and sent out to be paraffin embedded, sectioned and stained for H&E (SDPath). Stained tissues were analyzed in house and then sent out to be read by a board certified pathologist. Uteri and ovaries from 4 animals per group were flash frozen in liquid N2 for transcriptional analysis, examining a select set of genes modulated by the estrogen receptor.
