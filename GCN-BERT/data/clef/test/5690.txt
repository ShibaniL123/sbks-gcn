Intermediate 23: 5-Chloro-2-ethyl-6-(trifluoromethyl)-[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyridine
To a solution of 1,6-diamino-2-chloro-3-(trifluoromethyl)pyridin-1-ium 2,4,6-trimethylbenzenesulfonate (Intermediate 9) (300 mg, 0.73 mmol) in AcOH (5.8 mL) and MeOH (2.85 mL) were added Cu(OAc)2 (66 mg, 0.36 mmol) and propionaldehyde (0.16 mL, 2.19 mmol). The reaction was heated at 70° C. for 5 h, then cooled to rt and diluted with EtOAc. The mixture was carefully neutralized with 4N NaOH (ca. 25 mL), and the aqueous layer then extracted EtOAc (×2). The combined organics were washed with brine, dried over Na2SO4 and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated in vacuo. Purification (FCC, SiO2; 0-50% EtOAc/hexanes) afforded the title compound as a pale yellow solid (90 mg, 49%).
