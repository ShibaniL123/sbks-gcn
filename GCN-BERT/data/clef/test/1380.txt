The present invention relates to nucleic acid fragments encoding amino acid sequences for flavonoid biosynthetic enzymes in plants, and the use thereof for the modification of flavonoid biosynthesis in plants. Flavonoids constitute a relatively diverse family of aromatic molecules that are derived from phenyalanine and malonyl-coenzyme A (CoA, via the fatty acid pathway). These compounds include six major subgroups that are found in most higher plants: the chalcones, flavones, flavonols, flavandiols, anthocyanins and condensed tannins (or proanthocyanidins). A seventh group, the aurones, is widespread, but not ubiquitous. Some plant species also synthesize specialised forms of flavonoids, such as the isoflavonoids that are found in legumes and a small number of non-legume plants. Similarly, sorghum, maize and gloxinia are among the few species known to synthesize 3-deoxyanthocyanins (or phlobaphenes in the polymerised form). The stilbenes, which are closely related to flavonoids, are synthesised by another group of unrelated species that includes grape, peanut and pine. Besides providing pigmentation to flowers, fruits, seeds, and leaves, flavonoids also have key roles in signalling between plants and microbes, in male fertility of some plant species, in defense as antimicrobial agents and feeding deterrants, and in UV protection. Flavonoids also have significant activities when ingested by animals, and there is great interest in their potential health benefits, particularly for compounds such as isoflavonoids, which have been linked to anticancer benefits, and stilbenes that are believed to contribute to reduced heart disease. The major branch pathways of flavonoid biosynthesis start with general phenylpropanoid metabolism and lead to the nine major subgroups: the colorless chalcones, aurones, isoflavonoids, flavones, flavonols, flavandiols, anthocyanins, condensed tannins, and phlobaphene pigments. The enzyme phenylalanine ammonialyase (PAL) of the general phenylpropanoid pathway will lead to the production of cinnamic acid. Cinnamate-4-hydroxylase (C4H) will produce p-coumaric acid which will be converted through the action of 4-coumaroyl:CoA-ligase (4CL) to the production of 4-coumaroyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA. Chalcone synthase (CHS) uses malonyl CoA and 4-coumaryl CoA as substrates. Chalcone reductase (CHR) balances the production of 5-hydroxy- or 5-deoxyflavonoids. The next enzyme, chalcone isomerase (CHI) catalyses ring closure to form a flavanone, but the reaction can also occur spontaneously. Further enzymes in the pathway are: flavanone 3-hydroxylase (F3H), dihydroflavonol 4-reductase (DFR), flavonoid 3'-hydroxylase (F3'H) and flavonoid 3', 5' hydroxylase (F3'5'H). A specific cytochrome b5 may act as an electron donor for F3'5'H enzymes. In the branch of the phenylpropanoid pathway that is specific to condensed tannin and anthocyanin production, leucoanthocyanidins can be reduced to catechins by leucoanthocyanidin reductase (LAR) or to anthocyanidins by leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase (LDOX). Anthocyanidins can be converted to anthocyanins by the addition of sugar groups, or to epicatechins by anthocyanidin reductase (ANR), encoded by the BANYULS gene. Catechins and epicatechins are the subunits of condensed tannins, which in Arabidopsis are thought to be transported into the vacuole by a multidrug secondary transporter-like protein, TRANSPARENT TESTA 12 (TT12), and polymerised by the activity of a laccase. Enzymes in the flavonoid pathway have been found to be controlled by a range of transcription factors in Arabidopsis, maize and petunia. In Arabidopsis, condensed tannin biosynthesis requires the function of TRANSPARENT TESTA 2 (TT2), a R2R3 MYB family factor, TRANSPARENT TESTA 8 (TT8), a MYC/helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family factor and TRANSPARENT TESTA GLABRA 1 (TTG1), a WD40 family factor. These three proteins are thought to form a transcription complex that coordinately activates multiple flavonoid pathway enzymes in order to promote condensed tannin production in Arabidopsis seeds. Other myc and myb family transcription factors regulate distinct parts of the flavonoid pathway in maize, petunia and other plant species. Other transcription factors, including TRANSPARENT TESTA GLABRA 2 (TTG2) a WRKY box family member, TRANSPARENT TESTA 16 (TT16) a MADS box family member and TRANSPARENT TESTA 1 (TT1), a WIP family zinc finger factor, control the differentiation of condensed tannin-producing cells in the Arabidopsis seed coat. It is interesting that TTG2 also controls the development of trichomes in Arabidopsis and that glandular trichomes are the only sites of condensed tannin or monomer accumulation in vegetative organs of white clover. A number of enzymes are involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis in plants. Anthocyanin biosynthesis begins in the cytoplasm with glycosylation and methylation of anthocyanidin molecules by flavonoid glycosyltransferases, rhamnosyltransferases and methyltransferases altering the hydrophilicity of their backbone as well as their stability and chemical properties. Addition of functional groups to flavonoids can also influence their intracellular transport and bioactivity. Expression of genes encoding glucosyltransferases has been shown to be critical for anthocyanin biosynthesis in some pigmented berries and in flower petals of some plants. Other sugar metabolism genes, including UDP glucose 4-epimerases, may be involved in the catabolism of complex carbohydrates to provide the sugar moieties used by glucosyltransferases and rhamnosyltransferases. Although anthocyanin biosynthesis occurs in the cytoplasm, anthocyanins accumulate in the vacuole of pigmented plant cells and there is evidence that specific glutathione-S-transferases and ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters of the multi-drug resistance-associated protein (MRP) family are involved in this subcellular transport. While nucleic acid sequences encoding flavonoid methyltransferase (FMT), UDP glucose-3-epimerase (UG3E), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), O-methyltransferase (OMT), rhamnosyltransferase (RT), cytochrome b5 (CYTb5) and laccase-like enzymes, MADS box, WRKY, MYC, TT1, HLH and MYB transcription factors and ABC transporters, and like polypeptides, have been isolated for certain species of plants, there remains a need for materials useful in modifying flavonoid biosynthesis and metabolism; in modifying protein binding, metal chelation, anti-oxidation, and UV-light absorption; in modifying plant pigment production; in modifying plant defense to biotic stresses such as viruses, microorganisms, insects, fungal pathogens; in modifying forage quality, for example by disrupting protein foam and conferring protection from rumen pasture bloat, particularly in forage legumes, including alfalfa, medics and clovers, and for methods for their use. It is an object of the present invention to overcome, or at least alleviate, one or more of the difficulties or deficiencies associated with the prior art. In one aspect, the present invention provides a substantially purified or isolated nucleic acid or nucleic acid fragment encoding a polypeptide selected from the group consisting of flavonoid biosynthetic enzymes FMT, UG3E, GST, OMT, RT, CYTb5 and laccase, flavonoid biosynthesis-regulating transcription factors MADS box, WRKY, MYC, TT1, HLH and MYB, and an ABC transporter, from a clover (Trifolium) or medic (Medicago) species, complements thereof, sequences antisense thereto, and functionally active fragments and variants thereof. The present invention also provides substantially purified or isolated nucleic acids or nucleic acid fragments encoding amino acid sequences for a class of proteins which are related to FMTs, UG3Es, GSTs, OMTs, RTs, CYTb5s and laccase enzymes, MADS box, WRKY, MYC, TT1, HLH and MYB transcription factors and ABC transporters, or functionally active fragments or variants thereof. Such proteins are referred to herein as FMT-like, UG3E-like, GST-like, OMT-like, RT-like, CYTb5-like and laccase-like, MADS box-like, WRKY-like, MYC-like, TT1-like, HLH-like and MYB-like and ABC transporterlike, respectively. By a -like polypeptide is meant that either one of both of the following criteria apply: (i) the gene which encodes the -like polypeptide is expressed in a similar manner to the polypeptide, and (ii) the -like polypeptide has similar functional activity to the polypeptide. In a preferred embodiment, the -like polypeptide has at least approximately 70%, preferably at least approximately 80%, more preferably at least approximately 90% identity to the polypeptide. Also provided are substantially purified or isolated nucleic acids or nucleic acid fragments complementary or antisense to nucleic acid fragments encoding -like polypeptides. More particularly, the present invention provides a substantially purified or isolated nucleic acid or nucleic acid fragment encoding a polypeptide selected from the group consisting of flavonoid biosynthesis-regulating transcription factors MADS box, MADS box-like, WRKY, WRKY-like, MYC, MYC-like, TT1, TT1-like, HLH, HLH-like, MYB, and MYB -like; flavonoid biosynthetic enzymes FMT, FMT-like UG3E, UG3E-like, GST, GST-like, OMT, OMT-like, RT, RT-like, CYTb5, CYTb5-like, laccase and laccase-like; and flavonoid-related ABC transporter and ABC transporter-like protein; from a clover (Trifolium) or medic (Medicago) species; or a functionally active fragment or variant thereof. The individual or simultaneous enhancement or otherwise manipulation of FMT, UG3E, GST, OMT, RT, CYTb5, laccase, MADS box, WRKY, MYC, TT1, HLH, MYB and ABC-type transporter or like gene activities in plants may enhance, reduce or otherwise alter flavonoid biosynthesis or metabolism; may enhance, reduce or otherwise alter the plant capacity for protein binding, metal chelation, anti-oxidation, and UV-light absorption; may enhance, reduce or otherwise alter plant pigment production. The individual or simultaneous enhancement or otherwise manipulation of FMT, UG3E, GST, OMT, RT, CYTb5, laccase, MADS box, WRKY, MYC, TT1, HLH, MYB and ABC-type transporter or like gene activities in plants has significant consequences for a range of applications in, for example, plant production and plant protection. For example, it has applications in increasing plant tolerance and plant defense to biotic stresses such as viruses, microorganisms, insects and fungal pathogens; in improving plant forage quality, for example by disrupting protein foam and in conferring protection from rumen pasture bloat; in reducing digestion rates in the rumen and reducing parasitic load; in the production of plant compounds leading to health benefits, such as isoflavonoids, which have been linked to anticancer benefits, and stilbenes that are believed to contribute to reduced heart disease. Methods for the manipulation of FMT, UG3E, GST, OMT, RT, CYTb5 and laccase, MADS box, WRKY, MYC, TT1, HLH and MYB and ABC-type transporter or like gene activities in plants, including legumes such as clovers (Trifolium species), lucerne (Medicago sativa) and medics (Medicago species) may facilitate the production of, for example, forage legumes and forage grasses and other crops with enhanced tolerance to biotic stresses such as viruses, microorganisms, insects and fungal pathogens; altered pigmentation in flowers; forage legumes with enhanced herbage quality and bloat-safety; crops with enhanced isoflavonoid content leading to health benefits. The use of transcription factors to modify multiple product-specific enzymes in the flavonoid pathway may be a useful alternative strategy to cloning genes encoding many enzymes and modifying their expression in transgenic plants. While Applicant does not wish to be restricted by theory, the down-regulation of gene(s) encoding proteins involved in the addition of functional groups to anthocyanins and their transport to the vacuole may block the anthocyanin-specific branch of the flavonoid pathway in plants by a negative feedback mechanism. This may upregulate the condensed tannin pathway, which significantly overlaps with anthocyanin biosynthesis until the biosynthesis of leucoanthocyanidins. A metabolic engineering approach that combines the down-regulation of anthocyanin-related genes with over-expression of key genes involved in condensed tannin biosynthesis, such as BAN and LAR and optionally genes involved in the general flavonoid pathway may activate the condensed tannin pathway in anthocyanin-producing cells in the foliage of pasture legumes, conferring bloat-safety. The clover (Trifolium) or medic (Medicago) species may be of any suitable type, including white clover (Trifolium repens), red clover (Trifolium pratense), subterranean clover (Trifolium subterraneum) and alfalfa (Medicago sativa). Preferably, the species is white clover (T. repens) or alfalfa (Medicago sativa). White clover (Trifolium repens L.) and alfalfa (Medicago sativa) are key pasture legumes, in temperate climates throughout the world. The nucleic acid or nucleic acid fragment may be of any suitable type and includes DNA (such as cDNA or genomic DNA) and RNA (such as mRNA) that is single- or double-stranded, optionally containing synthetic, non-natural or altered nucleotide bases, and combinations thereof. Nucleic acids according to the invention may be full-length genes or part thereof, and are also referred to as "nucleic acid fragments" and "nucleotide sequences" in this specification. For convenience, the expression "nucleic acid or nucleic acid fragment" is used to cover all of these. By 'substantially purified' is meant that the nucleic acid is free of the genes, which, in the naturally-occurring genome of the organism from which the nucleic acid of the invention is derived, flank the nucleic acid. The term therefore includes, for example, a nucleic acid which is incorporated into a vector; into an autonomously replicating plasmid or virus; or into the genomic DNA of a prokaryote or eukaryote; or which exists as a separate molecule (eg. a cDNA or a genomic or cDNA fragment produced by PCR or restriction endonuclease digestion) independent of other sequences. It also includes a nucleic acid which is part of a hybrid gene encoding additional polypeptide sequence. Preferably, the substantially purified nucleic acid is 90%, more preferably 95%, even more preferably 98% pure. The term "isolated" means that the material is removed from its original environment (eg. the natural environment if it is naturally occurring). For example, a naturally occurring nucleic acid present in a living plant is not isolated, but the same nucleic acid separated from some or all of the coexisting materials in the natural system, is isolated. Such nucleic acids could be part of a vector and/or such nucleic acids could be part of a composition, and still be isolated in that such a vector or composition is not part of its natural environment. Such nucleic acids or nucleic acid fragments could be assembled to form a consensus contig. As used herein, the term "consensus contig" refers to a nucleotide sequence that is assembled from two or more constituent nucleotide sequences that share common or overlapping regions of sequence homology. For example, the nucleotide sequence of two or more nucleic acids or nucleic acid fragments can be compared and aligned in order to identify common or overlapping sequences. Where common or overlapping sequences exist between two or more nucleic acids or nucleic acid fragments, the sequences (and thus their corresponding nucleic acids or nucleic acid fragments) can be assembled into a single contiguous nucleotide sequence. In a preferred embodiment, the present invention provides a substantially purified or isolated nucleic acid or nucleic acid fragment encoding a polypeptide selected from the group consisting of FMT, UG3E, GST, OMT, RT, CYTb5, laccase, MADS box, WRKY, MYC, TT1, HLH, MYB and ABC-type transporter proteins, or complementary or antisense to a sequence encoding said polypeptide, and including a nucleotide sequence selected from the group consisting of (a) the sequences shown in Figures 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 13, 15, 17, 20, 23, 25, 26, 28, 30, 32, 35, 37, 38, 40, 41, 4345 and 48 hereto; (b) the complements of the sequences recited in (a); (c) the sequences antisense to the sequences recited in (a) and (b); and (d) functionally active fragments and variants of the sequences recited in (a), (b) and (c). By "functionally active" in relation to nucleic acids it is meant that the fragment or variant (such as an analogue, derivative or mutant) encodes a polypeptide which is capable of modifying flavonoid biosynthesis; in a plant. Such variants include naturally occurring allelic variants and non-naturally occurring variants. Additions, deletions, substitutions and derivatizations of one or more of the nucleotides are contemplated so long as the modifications do not result in loss of functional activity of the fragment or variant. Preferably the functionally active fragment or variant has at least approximately 80% identity to the relevant part of the nucleotide sequence upon which the fragment or variant is based, more preferably at least approximately 90% identity, even more preferably at least approximately 95% identity, most preferably at least approximately 98% identity. Such functionally active variants and fragments include, for example, those having conservative nucleic acid changes. By 'conservative nucleic acid changes' is meant nucleic acid substitutions that result in conservation of the same amino acid in the encoded protein, due to the degeneracy of the genetic code. Such functionally active variants and fragments also include, for example, those having nucleic acid changes which result in conservative amino acid substitutions of one or more residues in the corresponding amino acid sequence. By 'conservative amino acid substitutions' is meant the substitution of an amino acid by another one of the same class, the classes being as follows: Nonpolar: Ala, Val, Leu, Ile, Pro, Met Phe, TrpUncharged polar: Gly, Ser, Thr, Cys, Tyr, Asn, GinAcidic: Asp, GluBasic: Lys, Arg, His Other conservative amino acid substitutions may also be made as follows: Aromatic: Phe, Tyr, HisProton Donor: Asn, Gin, Lys, Arg, His, TrpProton Acceptor: Glu, Asp, Thr, Ser, Tyr, Asn, Gin Preferably the fragment has a size of at least 30 nucleotides, more preferably at least 45 nucleotides, more preferably at least 60 nucleotides, more preferably at least 100 nucleotides, even more preferably at least 150 nucleotides.

In a particularly preferred embodiment, the present invention provides a substantially purified or isolated nucleic acid or nucleic acid fragment comprising a nucleotide sequence selected from the group consisting of the sequences shown in Figures 1, 34, 67, 910, 12, 13, 15, 17, 20, 23, 25, 26, 28, 30, 32, 35, 37, 38, 39, 41, 43, 45 and 48 hereto; and the sequences complementary and antisense thereto. Nucleic acids or nucleic acid fragments encoding at least a portion of FMT, UG3E, GST, OMT, RT, CYTb5, laccase, MADS box, WRKY, MYC, TT1, HLH, MYB and ABC-type transporter orthologs have been isolated and identified. The nucleic acids or nucleic acid fragments of the present invention may be used to isolate cDNAs and genes encoding homologous proteins from the same or other plant species. Isolation of homologous genes using sequence-dependent protocols, such as methods of nucleic acid hybridisation, and methods of DNA and RNA amplification as exemplified by various uses of nucleic acid amplification technologies (e.g. polymerase chain reaction, ligase chain reaction), is well known in the art. For example, genes encoding other FMT, UG3E, GST, OMT, RT, CYTb5, laccase, MADS box, WRKY, MYC, TT1, HLH, MYB and ABC-type transporter proteins, either as cDNAs or genomic DNAs, may be isolated directly by using all or a portion of the nucleic acids or nucleic acid fragments of the present invention as hybridisation probes to screen libraries from the desired plant employing the methodology well known to those skilled in the art. Specific oligonucleotide probes based upon the nucleic acid sequences of the present invention may be designed and synthesized by methods known in the art. Moreover, the entire sequences may be used directly to synthesize DNA probes by methods known to the skilled artisan such as random primer DNA labelling, nick translation, or end-labelling techniques, or RNA probes using available in vitro transcription systems. In addition, specific primers may be designed and used to amplify a part or all of the sequences of the present invention. The resulting amplification products may be labelled directly during amplification reactions or labelled after amplification reactions, and used as probes to isolate full-length cDNA or genomic fragments under conditions of appropriate stringency. In addition, short segments of the nucleic acids or nucleic acid fragments of the present invention may be used in protocols to amplify longer nucleic acids or nucleic acid fragments encoding homologous genes from DNA or RNA. For example, polymerase chain reaction may be performed on a library of cloned nucleic acid fragments wherein the sequence of one primer is derived from the nucleic acid sequences of the present invention, and the sequence of the other primer takes advantage of the presence of the polyadenylic acid tracts to the 3' end of the mRNA precursor encoding plant genes. Alternatively, the second primer sequence may be based upon sequences derived from the cloning vector. For example, those skilled in the art can follow the RACE protocol (Frohman et al. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. USA 85:8998, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference) to generate cDNAs by using PCR to amplify copies of the region between a single point in the transcript and the 3' or 5' end. Using commercially available 3' RACE and 5' RACE systems (BRL), specific 3' or 5' cDNA fragments may be isolated (Ohara et al. (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad Sci USA 86:5673; Loh et al. (1989) Science 243:217, the entire disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference). Products generated by the 3' and 5' RACE procedures may be combined to generate full-length cDNAs.

By "functionally active" in relation to polypeptides it is meant that the fragment or variant has one or more of the biological properties of the polypeptide upon which the fragment or variant is based. Additions, deletions, substitutions and derivatizations of one or more of the amino acids are contemplated so long as the modifications do not result in loss of functional activity of the fragment or variant. Preferably the functionally active fragment or variant has at least approximately 80% identity to the relevant part of the amino acid sequence upon which the fragment or variant is based, more preferably at least approximately 90% identity, even more preferably at least approximately 95% identity, most preferably at least approximately 98% identity. Such functionally active variants and fragments include, for example, those having conservative amino acid substitutions of one or more residues in the corresponding amino acid sequence. By 'conservative amino acid substitutions' is meant the substitution of an amino acid by another one of the same class, the classes being as follows: Nonpolar: Ala, Val, Leu, Ile, Pro, Met Phe, TrpUncharged polar: Gly, Ser, Thr, Cys, Tyr, Asn, GinAcidic: Asp, GluBasic: Lys, Arg, His Other conservative amino acid substitutions may also be made as follows: Aromatic: Phe, Tyr, HisProton Donor: Asn, Gin, Lys, Arg, His, TrpProton Acceptor: Glu, Asp, Thr, Ser, Tyr, Asn, Gln Preferably the fragment has a size of at least 10 amino acids, more preferably at least 15 amino acids, more preferably at least 20 amino acids, more preferably at least 50 amino acids.

In a further embodiment of this aspect of the invention, there is provided a polypeptide recombinantly produced from a nucleic acid or nucleic acid fragment according to the present invention. Techniques for recombinantly producing polypeptides are known to those skilled in the art. Availability of the nucleotide sequences of the present invention and deduced amino acid sequences facilitates immunological screening of cDNA expression libraries. Synthetic peptides representing portions of the instant amino acid sequences may be synthesized. These peptides may be used to immunise animals to produce polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies with specificity for peptides and/or proteins including the amino acid sequences. These antibodies may be then used to screen cDNA expression libraries to isolate full-length cDNA clones of interest. In a still further aspect of the present invention there is provided a method of isolating a nucleic acid or nucleic acid fragment of the present invention said method including sequencing nucleic acid fragments from a nucleic acid library. The nucleic acid library may be of any suitable type and is preferably a cDNA library. The nucleic acid or nucleic acid fragment may be isolated from a recombinant plasmid or may be amplified, for example using polymerase chain reaction. The sequencing may be performed by techniques known to those skilled in the art. In a still further aspect of the present invention there is provided use of a nucleic acid or nucleic acid fragment of the present invention, and/or nucleotide sequence information thereof, as a molecular genetic marker. More particularly, nucleic acids or nucleic acid fragments according to the present invention and/or nucleotide sequence information thereof may be used as a molecular genetic marker for quantitative trait loci (QTL) tagging, QTL mapping, DNA fingerprinting and in marker assisted selection, particularly in clovers, alfalfa and medics. Even more particularly, nucleic acids or nucleic acid fragments according to the present invention and/or nucleotide sequence information thereof may be used as molecular genetic markers in plant improvement in relation to plant tolerance to biotic stresses such as viruses, microorganisms, insects, fungal pathogens; in relation to forage quality; in relation to bloat safety; in relation to condensed tannin content; in relation to plant pigmentation. Even more particularly, sequence information revealing SNPs in allelic variants of the nucleic acids or nucleic acid fragments of the present invention and/or nucleotide sequence information thereof may be used as molecular genetic markers for QTL tagging and mapping and in marker assisted selection, particularly in clovers, alfalfa and medics. In a still further aspect of the present invention there is provided a construct including a nucleic acid or nucleic acid fragment according to the present invention. The term "construct" as used herein refers to an artificially assembled or isolated nucleic acid molecule which includes the gene of interest. In general a construct may include the gene or genes of interest, a marker gene which in some cases can also be the gene of interest and appropriate regulatory sequences. It should be appreciated that the inclusion of regulatory sequences in a construct is optional, for example, such sequences may not be required in situations where the regulatory sequences of a host cell are to be used. The term construct includes vectors but should not be seen as being limited thereto. In a still further aspect of the present invention there is provided a vector including a nucleic acid or nucleic acid fragment according to the present invention. The term "vector" as used herein encompasses both cloning and expression vectors. Vectors are often recombinant molecules containing nucleic acid molecules from several sources. In a preferred embodiment of this aspect of the invention, the vector may include a regulatory element such as a promoter, a nucleic acid or nucleic acid fragment according to the present invention and a terminator; said regulatory element, nucleic acid or nucleic acid fragment and terminator being operatively linked. By "operatively linked" is meant that said regulatory element is capable of causing expression of said nucleic acid or nucleic acid fragment in a plant cell and said terminator is capable of terminating expression of said nucleic acid or nucleic acid fragment in a plant cell. Preferably, said regulatory element is upstream of said nucleic acid or nucleic acid fragment and said terminator is downstream of said nucleic acid or nucleic acid fragment. The vector may be of any suitable type and may be viral or non-viral. The vector may be an expression vector. Such vectors include chromosomal, non-chromosomal and synthetic nucleic acid sequences, eg. derivatives of plant viruses; bacterial plasmids; derivatives of the Ti plasmid from Agrobacterium tumefaciens, derivatives of the Ri plasmid from Agrobacterium rhizogenes; phage DNA; yeast artificial chromosomes; bacterial artificial chromosomes; binary bacterial artificial chromosomes; vectors derived from combinations of plasmids and phage DNA. However, any other vector may be used as long as it is replicable, integrative or viable in the plant cell. The regulatory element and terminator may be of any suitable type and may be endogenous to the target plant cell or may be exogenous, provided that they are functional in the target plant cell. Preferably the regulatory element is a promoter. A variety of promoters which may be employed in the vectors of the present invention are well known to those skilled in the art. Factors influencing the choice of promoter include the desired tissue specificity of the vector, and whether constitutive or inducible expression is desired and the nature of the plant cell to be transformed (eg. monocotyledon or dicotyledon). Particularly suitable constitutive promoters include the Cauliflower Mosaic Virus 35S (CaMV 35S) promoter. A variety of terminators which may be employed in the vectors of the present invention are also well known to those skilled in the art. The terminator may be from the same gene as the promoter sequence or a different gene. Particularly suitable terminators are polyadenylation signals, such as the CaMV 35S polyA and other terminators from the nopaline synthase (nos) and the octopine synthase (ocs) genes. The vector, in addition to the regulatory element, the nucleic acid or nucleic acid fragment of the present invention and the terminator, may include further elements necessary for expression of the nucleic acid or nucleic acid fragment, in different combinations, for example vector backbone, origin of replication (ori), multiple cloning sites, spacer sequences, enhancers, introns (such as the maize Ubiquitin Ubi intron), antibiotic resistance genes and other selectable marker genes [such as the neomycin phosphotransferase (npt2) gene, the hygromycin phosphotransferase (hph) gene, the phosphinothricin acetyltransferase (bar or pat) gene], and reporter genes (such as betaglucuronidase (GUS) gene (gusA)]. The vector may also contain a ribosome binding site for translation initiation. The vector may also include appropriate sequences for amplifying expression. As an alternative to use of a selectable marker gene to provide a phenotypic trait for selection of transformed host cells, the presence of the vector in transformed cells may be determined by other techniques well known in the art, such as PCR (polymerase chain reaction), Southern blot hybridisation analysis, histochemical GUS assays, northern and Western blot hybridisation analyses. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the various components of the vector are operatively linked, so as to result in expression of said nucleic acid or nucleic acid fragment. Techniques for operatively linking the components of the vector of the present invention are well known to those skilled in the art. Such techniques include the use of linkers, such as synthetic linkers, for example including one or more restriction enzyme sites. The vectors of the present invention may be incorporated into a variety of plants, including dicotyledons (such as arabidopsis, tobacco, clovers, medics, eucalyptus, potato, sugarbeet, canola, soybean, chickpea), monocotyledons (such as grasses from the genera Lolium, Festuca, Paspalum, Pennisetum, Panicum and other forage and turfgrasses, corn, oat, sugarcane, wheat and barley) and gymnosperms. In a preferred embodiment, the vectors may be used to transform dicotyledons, preferably forage legume species such as clovers (Trifolium species) and medics (Medicago species), more preferably white clover (Trifolium repens), red clover (Trifolium pratense), subterranean clover (Trifolium subterraneum) and alfalfa (Medicago sativa). Clovers, alfalfa and medics are key pasture legumes in temperate climates throughout the world. Techniques for incorporating the vectors of the present invention into plant cells (for example by transduction, transfection or transformation) are well known to those skilled in the art. Such techniques include Agrobacterium mediated introduction, electroporation to tissues, cells and protoplasts, protoplast fusion, injection into reproductive organs, injection into immature embryos and high velocity projectile introduction to cells, tissues, calli, immature and mature embryos. The choice of technique will depend largely on the type of plant to be transformed. Cells incorporating the vectors of the present invention may be selected, as described above, and then cultured in an appropriate medium to regenerate transformed plants, using techniques well known in the art. The culture conditions, such as temperature, pH and the like, will be apparent to the person skilled in the art. The resulting plants may be reproduced, either sexually or asexually, using methods well known in the art, to produce successive generations of transformed plants. In a further aspect of the present invention there is provided a plant cell, plant, plant seed or other plant part, including, e.g. transformed with, a vector or construct, nucleic acid or nucleic acid fragment of the present invention. The plant cell, plant, plant seed or other plant part may be from any suitable species, including dicotyledons, moncotyledons and gymnosperms. In a preferred embodiment the plant cell, plant, plant seed or other plant part may be from a dicotyledon, preferably forage legume species such as clovers (Trifolium species) and medics (Medicago species), more preferably white clover (Trifolium repens), red clover (Trifolium pratense), subterranean clover (Trifolium subterraneum) and alfalfa (Medicago sativa). The present invention also provides a plant, plant seed or other plant part, or a plant extract derived from a plant cell or plant of the present invention and preferably including e.g. transformed with, a vector or construct, nucleic acid or nucleic acid fragment of the present invention. In a further aspect of the present invention there is provided a method of modifying flavonoid biosynthesis or metabolism; of modifying protein binding, metal chelation, anti-oxidation or UV-light absorption; of modifying plant pigment production; of modifying plant defense to biotic stresses such as viruses, microorganisms, insects, fungal pathogens; or of modifying forage quality by disrupting protein foam and conferring protection from rumen pasture bloat; said method including introducing into said plant an effective amount of a nucleic acid or nucleic acid fragment, construct and/or vector according to the present invention. By "an effective amount" it is meant an amount sufficient to result in an identifiable phenotypic trait in said plant, or a plant, plant seed or other plant part derived therefrom. Such amounts can be readily determined by an appropriately skilled person, taking into account the type of plant, the route of administration and other relevant factors. Such a person will readily be able to determine a suitable amount and method of administration. See, for example, Maniatis et al, Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. Using the methods and materials of the present invention, flavonoid biosynthesis or metabolism, protein binding, metal chelation, anti-oxidation, UV-light absorption, tolerance to biotic stresses such as viruses, microorganisms, insects and fungal pathogens; pigmentation in for example flowers and leaves; herbage quality and bloat-safety; isoflavonoid content leading to health benefits, may be increased, decreased or otherwise altered, in a transformed plant relative to an untransformed control plant, for example by incorporating additional copies of a sense nucleic acid or nucleic acid fragment of the present invention, preferably to overexpress the polypeptide or in sense suppression. They may be decreased or otherwise altered, for example by incorporating an antisense nucleic acid or nucleic acid fragment of the present invention. One or more nucleic acids of the present invention may be used in the methods, constructs and vectors of the present invention, optionally in combination with one or more nucleic acids described in Applicant's earlier patent applications AU 2002333038, PCT/AU2006/001020 and PCT/AU2006/001590, the entire disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.

The characteristics of the white clover libraries are described below (Table 1).

For example, total RNA may be isolated using the Trizol method (Gibco-BRL, USA) or the RNeasy Plant Mini kit (Qiagen, Germany), following the manufacturers' instructions. cDNAs may be generated using the SMART PCR cDNA synthesis kit (Clontech, USA), cDNAs may be amplified by long distance polymerase chain reaction using the Advantage 2 PCR Enzyme system (Clontech, USA), cDNAs may be cleaned using the GeneClean spin column (Bio 101, USA), tailed and size fractionated, according to the protocol provided by Clontech. The cDNAs may be introduced into the pGEM-T Easy Vector system 1 (Promega, USA) according to the protocol provided by Promega. The cDNAs in the pGEM-T Easy plasmid vector are transfected into Escherichia coli Epicurian coli XL10-Gold ultra competent cells (Stratagene, USA) according to the protocol provided by Stratagene. Alternatively, the cDNAs may be introduced into plasmid vectors for first preparing the cDNA libraries in Uni-ZAP XR vectors according to the manufacturer's protocol (Stratagene Cloning Systems, La Jolla, CA, USA). The Uni-ZAP XR libraries are converted into plasmid libraries according to the protocol provided by Stratagene. Upon conversion, cDNA inserts will be contained in the plasmid vector pBluescript. In addition, the cDNAs may be introduced directly into precut pBluescript II SK(+) vectors (Stratagene) using T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs), followed by transfection into E. coli DH10B cells according to the manufacturer's protocol (GIBCO BRL Products). Once the cDNA inserts are in plasmid vectors, plasmid DNAs are prepared from randomly picked bacterial colonies containing recombinant plasmids, or the insert cDNA sequences are amplified via polymerase chain reaction using primers specific for vector sequences flanking the inserted cDNA sequences. Plasmid DNA preparation may be performed robotically using the Qiagen QiaPrep Turbo kit (Qiagen, Germany) according to the protocol provided by Qiagen. Amplified insert DNAs are sequenced in dye-terminator sequencing reactions to generate partial cDNA sequences (expressed sequence tags or "ESTs"). The resulting ESTs are analyzed using an Applied Biosystems ABI 3700 sequence analyser. Example 2 DNA sequence analyses cDNA clones encoding FMT, UG3E, GST, OMT, RT, CYTb5, MADS, WRKY, MYC, TT1, HLH, MYB, ABC and -like proteins were identified by conducting a BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool; Altschul et al. (1993) J. Mol. Biol. 215:403-410) search. The DNA sequence was translated in all reading frames and compared for similarity to all publicly available protein sequences contained in the Uniprot protein sequence database using the BLASTx algorithm (v 2.0.1) (Gish and States (1993) Nature Genetics 3:266-272) provided by the NCBI. Example 3 Identification and full-length sequencing of cDNAs encoding white clover FMT, UG3E, GST, OMT, RT, CYTb5, laccase, MADS box, WRKY, MYC, TT1, HLH, MYB and ABC transporter and like proteins To fully characterise for the purposes of the generation of probes for hybridisation experiments and the generation of transformation vectors, a set of cDNAs encoding white clover FMT, UG3E, GST, OMT, RT, CYTb5, laccase, MADS box, WRKY, MYC, TT1, HLH, MYB and ABC transporter and like proteins are identified and fully sequenced by the following method. Full-length or partial cDNAs were identified from our EST sequence database using relevant published sequences (NCBI databank) as queries for BLAST searches. Full-length cDNAs were identified by alignment of the query and hit sequences using Sequencher (Gene Codes Corp., Ann Arbor, MI 48108, USA). The original cDNA in the pGEM-T easy vector is then used to transform chemically competent DH5 alpha cells (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA). At least two colonies per transformation are picked for initial sequencing with M13F and M13R primers. The resulting sequences are aligned with the original EST sequence using Sequencher to confirm identity and one of the two clones is picked for full-length sequencing, usually the one with the best initial sequencing result. Sequencing is completed by primer walking, i.e. oligonucleotide primers are designed to the initial sequence and used for further sequencing from the 5' end. In most instances, an extended poly-A tail necessitates the sequencing of the cDNA to be completed from the 5' end. Contigs are then assembled in Sequencher. The contigs include at least the 5' end of the original EST sequence and extend to at least the poly-A tail at the 3' end of the cDNA. Plasmid maps and the full cDNA sequences of white clover laccase, MYCa and MYB24a were obtained by this method (Figures 19, 20, 31,44, 45 and Table 2). Plasmid maps and full or partial cDNA sequences of white clover FMT, UG3E, GST, OMT, RT, CYTb5, MADS box, WRKY, TT1, HLH and ABC transporter and like genes in the pGEM-T Easy vector are obtained by this method.

The primers used contain attB1 and attB2 GATEWAY® recombination sites for directional cloning into the target vector. After PCR amplification and purification of the products, the cDNA fragments are cloned into the recombination site of the pDONR221™ vector (Figure 50) using BP GATEWAY® technology (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA). The pPZP221 binary vector (Hajdukiewicz et al., 1994, The small versatile pPZP family of Agrobacterium binary vectors for plant transformation. Plant Mol. Biol.25:989-994.) was modified to contain the 35S2 cassette from pKYLX71:35S2 as follows. pKYLX71:35S2 was cut with Clal. The 5' overhang was filled in using Klenow and the blunt end was A-tailed with Taq polymerase. After cutting with EcoRI, the 2kb fragment with an EcoRI-compatible and a 3'-A tail was gel-purified. pPZP221 was cut with HindIII and the resulting 5' overhang filled in and T-tailed with Taq polymerase. The remainder of the original pPZP221 multi-cloning site was removed by digestion with EcoRI, and the expression cassette cloned into the EcoRI site and the 3' T overhang restoring the HindIII site. This binary vector contains between the left and right border the plant selectable marker gene aaaC1 under the control of the 35S promoter and 35S terminator and the pKYLX71:35S2-derived expression cassette with a CaMV 35S promoter with a duplicated enhancer region and an rbcS terminator. This vector was GATEWAY®-enabled by digesting it with Xbal and blunt-ended using Klenow DNA polymerase, allowing the RfA recombination cassette to be cloned in the sense or antisense orientation between the enhanced 35S promoter and the rbcS terminator. The orientation of the constructs (sense or antisense) is checked by restriction enzyme digestion and sequencing. Transformation vectors containing chimeric genes using full-length open reading frame cDNAs in sense and antisense orientations under the control of the CaMV 35S2 promoter are generated (Figures 22, 34 and 47).

Agrobacterium-mediated gene transfer experiments are performed using these transformation vectors. Preparation of white clover cotyledonary explants White clover (cv 'Mink') seeds are rinsed for 5 minutes in running tap water and incubated twice, for 5 minutes in 70% v/v ethanol in a 120 ml tissue culture container with gentle shaking. The same container is used to incubate the seeds for 2 minutes in 1% sodium hypochlorite (1:3 ratio of Domestos™ bleach in water) with gentle shaking. The seeds are then rinsed six times in sterile water in a laminar flow hood and incubated for 18 hours at 4°C in the dark. Cotyledonary explants are extracted using 10 ml syringes attached to 21 G needles (Terumo, Japan) under a dissecting microscope in a laminar flow hood. Both layers of the seed coat are peeled away, the end of the hypocotyl is cut off and the cotyledons with approximately 4 mm of hypocotyl are separated and transferred to a 90 x 90 x 20 mm petri dish containing MGL medium. Preparation of Agrobacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain AGL-1 containing each PZP221-derived binary expression vector is streaked on LB medium containing 50 µg/ml rifampicin and 100 µg/ml spectinomycin and grown at 27 °C for 48 hours. A single colony is used to inoculate 5 ml of LB medium containing 50 µg/ml rifampicin and 100 µg/ml spectinomycin and grown over night at 27 °C and 250 rpm on an orbital shaker. The overnight culture is used as an inoculum for 40 ml of YEP medium containing 100 µg/ml spectinomycin and 40 mg/l acetosyringone. Incubation is over night at 27 °C and 250 rpm on an orbital shaker in a 250 ml Erlenmeyer flask. The overnight cultures are centrifuged for 15 min at 5500 xg and the supernatant discarded. The cells are resuspended in MGL media with 40 mg/l acetosyringone to a volume corresponding to an OD600 reading of 0.4. The cells are then incubated at 27 °C and 250 rpm until the OD600 reading reaches 0.8. Cocultivation and selection of white clover transformants The MGL medium is removed from the petri dish containing white clover cotyledonary explants and replaced with the prepared Agrobacterium suspension using a sterile serological pipette. The petri dish is sealed with laboratory film, covered with aluminium foil and incubated with gentle shaking for 45 min. The dish is opened in the laminar flow hood and the Agrobacterium suspension removed with a pipette. The explants are then transferred to plates containing RM73 media with 40 mg/l acetosyringone (Table 1) and incubated for 3 days in a plant tissue culture room at 22°C with a 16 hour photoperiod. After this, the explants are transferred, with the hypocotyl end in the media, to plates containing RM73 media with 75 mg/l gentamicin and 250 mg/l cefotaxime. The explants are transferred to fresh plates every two weeks for 6-8 weeks. Shoots are then transferred to 120 ml tissue culture vessels containing RIM media (Table 2) with 75 mg/l gentamicin and 250 mg/l cefotaxime. When roots develop, the plantlets are transferred to pots of soil and after 2 weeks of recovery in a misting bench, are grown under standard glasshouse conditions. Preparation of genomic DNA 1-2 leaflets of white clover plants recovered from the transformation process are harvested and freeze-dried. The tissue is homogenised on a Retsch MM300 mixer mill, then centrifuged for 10 min at 1700xg to collect cell debris. Genomic DNA is isolated from the supernatant using Wizard Magnetic 96 DNA Plant System kits (Promega) on a Biomek FX (Beckman Coulter). 5 µl of the sample (50 µl) is then analysed on an agarose gel to check the yield and the quality of the genomic DNA. Analysis of DNA from putative transgenic lines using real-time PCR Genomic DNA is analysed for the presence of the transgene by real-time PCR using SYBR Green chemistry. PCR primer pairs were designed to detect the aacC1 gentamycin resistance gene in the transferred T-DNA region using MacVector (Accelrys). The sequences of these primers are as follows: pPZPaacC1-1f 5'-TCAAGTATGGGCATCATTCGCAC-3' (SEQ ID No: 107)pPZPaacC1-1.r 5'-TGCTCAAACCGGGCAGAACG-3' (SEQ ID No: 108) 2.5 µl of each genomic DNA sample is run in a 25 µl PCR reaction including SYBR Green on an ABI (Applied Biosystems) together with samples containing DNA isolated from wild type white clover plants (cv 'Mink', negative control), samples containing buffer instead of DNA (buffer control) and samples containing the plasmid used for transformation (positive plasmid control).

Two mature leaflets from each plant are decolourised in absolute ethanol in 6-well tissue culture plates for 3 hours with gentle shaking. The ethanol is removed and replaced with a 0.01% w/v solution of DMACA (Fluka), freshly made up in absolute ethanol with 2.4% v/v concentrated hydrochloric acid. After 1 hour of incubation with gentle shaking, the leaflets are rinsed with distilled water and mounted in 50% glycerol for analysis with a dissecting microscope (Figure 52). Wild type white clover plants show blue staining in epidermal cells in the floral organs and in trichomes. Lotus corniculatus (cv 'Draco'), a forage legume with a 'bloat-safe' level of condensed tannins in the leaves, shows blue staining of approximately 50% of mesophyll cells in leaves. Achieving a level of condensed tannins in white clover leaves that is comparable to the level seen in leaves of L. corniculatus by metabolic engineering would be agronomically valuable. DMACA staining can detect economically significant levels of condensed tannins and their monomers in the leaves of established bloat-safe forage legumes. However, the condensation of catechin monomers to form condensed tannins and their transport from the cytoplasm to the vacuole is poorly understood. Hence, modifying the regulation of known enzymes and transcription factors in the flavonoid pathway may up-regulate catechin levels but not increase condensed tannin levels, and therefore, bloat-safety. The PVPP-butanol-HCl assay detects only condensed tannins, relying on the ability of condensed tannins, but not their monomers to bind to PVPP. The detailed method is as follows. Clover leaf and inflorescence (positive control) tissue is snap-frozen and ground to a fine powder in a mortar and pestle under liquid nitrogen. After grinding, 0.75 g of the powder from each sample is transferred to a 14 ml screw-cap centrifuge tube (Falcon), vortex-mixed with 1.5 ml of extraction buffer containing 80% v/v methanol in distilled water with 5.3 mM sodium bisulfite. Samples are mixed for 5 hours on a mixing wheel before centrifugation at 3000 xg for 10 minutes. A 1 ml aliquot of each supernatant is transferred to a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube and reduced to 0.25 ml in a vacuum centrifuge. Equal volumes of the sample are added to each of two 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes containing 25 mg of polyvinyl polypyrrolidone (PVPP). Each mixture is vortex-mixed intermittently for 15 min and centrifuged for 1 min at maximum speed in a microcentrifuge. After removal of the supernatant, the pellet is washed four times with 1 ml of methanol, with a 1 min centrifugation step at maximum speed in a microcentrifuge between each wash. A freshly-made 70:30 (v/v) solution of butanol and concentrated hydrochloric acid is added to each pellet and one tube of the mixture is incubated for 1 hour at 70°C, whereas the other tube is incubated at ambient temperature. The difference in the absorbance (530 nm) between the two tubes from each plant sample is proportional to the level of condensed tannins in the sample. This assay can be quantitated with a condensed tannin of known concentration. Example 7 Analysis of the temporal and spatial pattern of flavonoid-related gene expression. Biochemical, molecular and microscopic analyses suggest that at least two proanthocyanidin (PA) and two anthocyanin (ANT) pathways are active in developing white clover florets. A PA pathway which is developmentally regulated in epidermal cells of IW with accumulation of flavan-3-ol monomers peaking at the stage 3 and sharply down-regulated at the later stages; another PA pathway is active in the trichomes located in sepals at all six developmental stages; an ANT pathway which is developmentally and light-regulated in epidermal cells of IW at the stages 4-6 and ANT pathway that is active at all stages in a small group of cells in sepals (Figure 53). We monitored the expression pattern of 12,000 T. repens genes at six stages of inflorescence development using custom-made CombiMatrix oligonucleotide arrays in order to identify flavonoid genes differentially expressed in developing white clover florets. Each gene was represented by a sequence-specific, 30-40 base pair oligonucleotide. This approach aimed to determine which flavonoid-related genes and isoforms are most likely to be involved in condensed tannin production, or in the production of other flavonoids, and could therefore be targeted for overexpression or downregulation in the metabolic engineering of bloat-safe white clover. The expression of the TrMYB24a gene peaked at stage 3 (50% open inflorescence, upper half) and then declined (Figure 53). Real-time RT-PCR is a recently developed technique that allows more quantitative analyses of gene expression than Northern or conventional RT-PCR experiments. Essentially, real-time RT-PCR with SYBR Green chemistry and gene-specific primers involves the automatic measurement of the level of a fluorescent PCR product generated from a cDNA species over each cycle. The abundance of each template is proportional to the amplification rate. Therefore, a threshold corresponding to the start of the exponential phase of PCR allows the relative abundance of target genes to be standardised against a uniformly expressed 'housekeeping' gene in each tissue and compared to a negative control without a template. Real-time RT-PCR with SYBR Green chemistry has been used successfully by others in the field to quantify the expression of four flavonoid-related genes in Lotus corniculatus plants exposed to different light regimes (Paolocci et al,. 2005, Light and an exogenous transcription factor qualitatively and quantitatively affect the biosynthetic pathway of condensed tannins in Lotus corniculatus leaves. J. Exp. Bot. 56: 1093-1103). A Real-Time RT-PCR strategy involving with SYBR Green chemistry and absolute quantification was used to validate the microarray results. Real-time RT-PCR was also used to test whether expression of the TrMYB24a gene is restricted to the inner whorls (IW) of white clover florets at inflorescence stages 3, 4, 5 and 6, correlating with PA production. The full-length cDNA sequences encoding TrMYB24a and TrEF1α were used as input data for the Primer Express (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, USA) primer design program, using the default settings, no 3' GC clamp and a predicted amplicon size of 50-150 base pairs. Primers close to the 3' ends of the input sequences are preferred, due to the likelihood of a large number of cDNA molecules derived from clover samples being incomplete at the 5' end. The specificity of the primer sets was tested using 1 ul of plasmid DNA (0.01 ng/ul) from the original cDNA cloned into pGEM-T Easy or autoclaved, purified water, 12.5 ul 2x SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), 0.5 ul each of the forward and reverse primers (10 uM) and 10.5 ul of autoclaved, purified water (Sartorius AG, Goettingen, Germany). Real-time PCR was performed in 96-well optical PCR plates (Applied Biosystems) using the Stratagene MX3000P cycler and the following cycling parameters: 95°C for 10 min, 40 cycles of 95°C for 30 sec and 60°C for 1 min, followed by 55°C for 1 min and 95°C for 1 min. Primer sets generally amplified a satisfactory level of products from the corresponding cDNA templates with a cycle threshold cut-off of 24 cycles. The primer sets were generally isoform-specific. Total RNA was extracted from white clover tissues using a CTAB-based method (Chang, S., Puryear, J. and Cairney, J. (1993). A simple and efficient method for isolating RNA from pine trees. Plant Mol Biol Rep 11:113-116) and contaminating genomic DNA was digested on the column using the optional on-column DNAse digestion method from the RNeasy kit (QIAGEN GmbH, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturers' instructions. Complementary DNA (cDNA) is synthesised from 0.5 ug of total RNA using the Quantitect Reverse Transcriptase Kit (QIAGEN GmbH). Real-time RT-PCR reactions are set up and run as described earlier using 1 ul of cDNA, plasmid control DNA or autoclaved, purified water as the template. Real-time RT-PCR results supported the expression profile of TrMYB24a seen in the microarray experiment. TrMYB24a was also found to be expressed at a significantly higher level in inner whorls than in sepals (Figure 53).
