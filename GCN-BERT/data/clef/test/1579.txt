Botanical designation: Rosa hybrid. Variety denomination: ‘Poulpah065’. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention constitutes a new and distinct variety of miniature rose plant which originated from a controlled crossing between the female seed parent, an unnamed seedling, and the male pollen parent, also an unnamed seedling. The two parents were crossed during the summer of 2007 and the resulting seeds were planted in a controlled environment in Fredensborg, Denmark. The new variety, named ‘Poulpah065’, originated as a single seedling from the stated cross. The new variety may be distinguished from its male pollen parent and female seed parent by the following characteristics. The upper surface of the flower petals, on the female seed parent are Orange Red Group 32C while the claimed variety has a petal upper surface which is predominantly Orange-Red Group 31B. The male pollen plant has a flower color general tonality which is in the Yellow-Orange Group while the claimed plant is in the Red Group. The objective of the hybridization of this rose variety for commercial culture was to create a new and distinct variety with unique qualities, such as: 1. Uniform and abundant orange flowers;2. Vigorous and compact growth;3. Year-round flowering under glasshouse conditions;4. Suitability for production from softwood cuttings in pots;5. Durable flowers and foliage which make a variety suitable for distribution in the floral industry. This combination of qualities is not present in previously available commercial cultivars of this type, known to the inventor, and distinguish ‘Poulpah065’ from all other varieties of which we are aware. As part of the rose development program, Mogens N. Olesen germinated the seeds from the aforementioned hybridization and conducted evaluations on the resulting seedlings in a controlled environment in Fredensborg, Denmark. ‘Poulpah065’ was selected by the inventor as a single plant from the progeny of the hybridization in 2007. Asexual reproduction of ‘Poulpah065’ by cuttings was first done by Mogens N. Olesen in the nursery in Fredensborg, Denmark in 2008. This initial and other subsequent propagations conducted in controlled environments have demonstrated that the characteristics of ‘Poulpah065’ are true to type and are transmitted from one generation to the next. DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING The accompanying color illustration shows as true as is reasonably possible to obtain in color photographs of this type, the typical characteristics of the buds, flowers, leaves, and stems, of ‘Poulpah065’. Specifically illustrated in the drawing are flowers at various stages of development, flower in parts, leaves, and stems. Illustrated plants are 3 months of age. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE VARIETY The following is a description of ‘Poulpah065’, as observed in its growth in glasshouses Half Moon Bay, Calif. Observed plants are 3 months of age and were cultivated in 10.5 cm pots. Color references are made using The Royal Horticultural Society (London, England) Colour Chart, 2001, except where common terms of color are used. For a comparison, several physical characteristics of the rose variety ‘Poulfiry’, U.S. Plant Pat. No. 12,484. are compared to ‘Poulpah065’ in Chart 1.
