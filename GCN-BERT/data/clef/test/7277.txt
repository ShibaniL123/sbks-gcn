CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims priority to and the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/477,614 filed Apr. 21, 2011, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein. FIELD OF INVENTION The present invention relates to methods of detecting and monitoring aggregation of beta-amyloid peptides which are associated with neurodegenerative diseases as well as treating and/or preventing the neurodegenerative diseases by using carbazole-based fluorophores. In particular, the present invention provides methods for labeling and imaging the beta-amyloid (Aβ) peptides, oligomers, and fibrils in vitro and/or in vivo, as well as treating and/or preventing Alzheimer's disease by using the carbazole-based fluorophores of the present invention. BACKGROUND OF INVENTION Loss of memory and cognitive functions are often associated with aging. This is the result of neurodegeneration. However, in some cases, this process of neurodegeneration becomes accelerated due to premature cell death in the brain, leading to a variety of cognitive impairments or dementia. Among these neurodegenerative disorders, Alzheimer's disease (AD) is most prevalent in recent years. It has also attracted considerable attention locally because Prof. Charles K. Kao, former president of the Chinese University of Hong Kong and Nobel Laureate in Physics, 2009, was stricken with this devastating disease. More than 26 million people worldwide were estimated to suffer from Alzheimer's disease (AD) in 2006 and the patient number was expected to increase by 4-fold in 2050. The incidence rate of AD is known to increase with age. At age over 65, the incidence rate is about 5% in the general population. At age over 80, the incidence rate increases to about 20%, i.e., one in five. Current drug treatments can only improve symptoms and produce no profound cure. In recent years, several approaches aimed at inhibiting disease progression have advanced to clinical trials. Among them, strategies targeting the production and clearance of the Aβ peptide, which is thought to be a critical protein involved in the pathogenesis of the disease, are the most advanced. Aβ peptide is the principal protein component of the Aβ plaques which are found in the brains of AD patients during autopsy. The occurrence of the Aβ plaques, considered a cardinal feature of AD, provides the only confirmed diagnosis of the disease. Extensive researches in past decades have indicated a central role for the Aβ peptide in the disease process where the Aβ peptides assemble (aggregate) into Aβ fibrils which exert a cytotoxic effect towards the neurons and initiate the pathogenic cascade. Recent studies showed that oligomeric, prefibrillar and diffusible assemblies of Aβ peptides are also deleterious. The ability of this peptide to form Aβ fibrils seems to be largely sequence-independent, and many proteins can form structures with the characteristic cross-β stacking perpendicular to the long axis of the fiber. Although a consensus mechanism for the pathogenic oligomeric assembly has yet to emerge, the idea of finding some brain-penetrating small molecules that can interfere with the interactions among the Aβ peptide monomers and thus inhibit the formation of the neurotoxic oligomers and the resulting Aβ plaques is an attractive approach to treating/preventing the disease. The use of agents that stabilize the monomer, interfere with the aggregation process (amyloidogenesis) and allow for the isolation of the intermediate species will help to elucidate the molecular mechanism of Aβ fibril formation. In addition, imaging agents that can specifically bind Aβ fibrils and plaques in vitro and in vivo are of paramount importance for studying the pathological events of the disease, disease diagnosis and monitoring of therapeutic treatment. We have previously shown that carbazole-based fluorophores are highly sensitive fluorescent light-up probe for double strand DNA and strongly active two-photon absorption dyes for two-photon excited bioimaging (Feng et al, 2010), the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein. Recently, the mono-cyanine fluorophore has also been found to exhibit binding affinity towards beta amyloid (Aβ) peptide concomitant with strong fluorescent enhancement. These findings provide us the lead molecular structure to design and synthesize novel functional carbazole-based fluorophores for imaging and inhibition the aggregation of Aβ peptides.

SUMMARY OF INVENTION The first aspect of the present invention relates to methods of using carbazole-based fluorophores for labelling, imaging and detecting beta amyloid peptides, oligomers, and fibrils that fluoresce strongly upon binding in vitro or in vivo. The fluorophores of the present invention are non-toxic and able to cross the blood brain barrier. The fluorophores could potentially be used as labeling dyes to assist the investigation of beta amyloid peptides, oligomers, and fibrils in vitro and in vivo. Another aspect of the present invention relates to methods of using carbazole-based fluorophores for inhibiting the growth of beta amyloid oligomers and preventing their aggregation upon binding in vitro or in vivo. The fluorophores of the present invention are non-toxic and able to cross the blood brain barrier. The fluorophores could potentially serve as Alzheimer's disease therapeutics and/or preventive agents. A further aspect of the present invention uses carbazole-based fluorophores that bind beta amyloid peptides as a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agent. By conjugating appropriate paramagnetic metal complexes to these carbazole-based fluorophores, these compounds can potentially be developed into beta-amyloid peptide-specific MRI contrast agents.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION The present invention is not to be limited in scope by any of the specific embodiments described herein. The following embodiments are presented for exemplification only. The general chemical structures of carbazole-based fluorophores, including S or V series, are shown as follows: wherein Ar is a heteraromatic ring selected from the group consisting of pyridinyl, substituted pyridinyl, quinolinyl, substituted quinolinyl, acridinyl, substituted acridinyl, benzothiazolyl, substituted benzothiazolyl, benzoxazolyl, and substituted benzoxazolyl; R1 is a radical selected from the group consisting of polyethylene glycol chain, alkyl, substituted alkyl, peptide chain, glycosidyl, and C(O)NHCH((CH2CH2O)2CH3)2; R2 is selected from the group consisting of ethenyl, ethynyl, azo and azomethinyl; R3 is a radical selected from the group consisting of alkyl, HO-alkyl, HS-alkyl, H2N-alkyl, HNalkyl-alkyl, HOOC-alkyl, (alkyl)3N+-alkyl, and (Ph)3P+-alkyl; X is an anion selected from the group consisting of F, Cl, Br, I, HSO4, H2PO4, HCO3, tosylate, and mesylate. In one embodiment, Ar is a quinolinyl or substituted quinolinyl; R1 is a 2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy; R2 is an ethenyl; R3 is a methyl, 2-hydroxyethyl, ethyl or 3-hydroxypropyl; and X is a chloride, bromide or iodide, and the compounds of which are represented by the above formula “SLM”, “SLOH”, “SLE” and “SLOH-Pr”, respectively. In another embodiment, Ar is a quinolinyl or substituted quinolinyl; R1 is a methyl; R2 is an ethenyl; R3 is a methyl; and X is a chloride, bromide or iodide, the compounds of which are represented by the above formula Me-SLM. In a further embodiment, Ar is an acridinyl or substituted acridinyl; R1 is a 2-(2-methoxy-ethoxy)ethoxy; R2 is an ethenyl; R3 is a methyl or 2-hydroxyethyl; and X is selected from a chloride, bromide or iodide, and the fluorophores of which are represented by the above formula SAM and SAOH, respectively, where the difference between the compounds of SAM and SAOH is the substitutent at R3. In other embodiment, Ar is selected from a pyridinyl or substituted pyridinyl, R1 is a 2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy; R2 is an ethenyl; R3 is selected from a methyl or 2-hydroxyethyl; and X is selected from a chloride, bromide or iodide, the compounds of which are represented by the formula SPM and SPOH, respectively. A novel series of water-soluble carbazole-based fluorophores has been designed and developed. These molecules were found to bind to Aβ(1-40) and Aβ(1-42) peptides and, more specifically, their oligomers, and fibrils with strong fluorescence enhancement, therefore allowing direct imaging and detection for the Aβ peptides, oligomers and their fibrils (FIG. 1). Upon binding with Aβ peptides, there is about 8- to about 82-fold increase in fluorescence intensity concomitant with the substantial blue shifts (Δ=14-22 nm) in the emission spectra of the fluorophores (FIG. 2). Interestingly, the fluorescence enhancement is much stronger for fibrils than peptides. (e.g. Ffibril/FSLOH=81.5 vs. Fpeptide/FSLOH=6.3). Because of such strong increase in fluorescence, the signal-to-noise ratio is so high that imaging of single fibrils is possible. (FIG. 3) Compared to common commercial labeling dyes for Aβ such as Thioflavin-T and Congo Red, the carbazole-based fluorophores of the present invention provide an advantage of a wide range of excitation and emission tuning in visible to infra-red region (FIG. 4). Some of these molecules, e.g., SAM and SAOH, even emit at ˜760 nm (FIG. 5), which can potentially be used for near infra-red fluorescence imaging. In addition to fluorescence titration, the binding of Aβ peptide and fibril with the carbazole-based fluorophores of the present invention were further confirmed by circular dichroism spectroscopy (FIG. 6), and electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence Microscope (TIRFM) technique developed by us was used to investigate the inhibition effects of these functional fluorophores on Aβ fibril formation (FIG. 7). Remarkably, some of these molecules, e.g., SLOH, SLE, SLOH-Pr, Me-SLM, SAM, and SAOH, were found to inhibit Aβ peptide aggregation and prevent fibril growth (FIG. 7). Such inhibitory effect was further confirmed by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) study (FIG. 8). The inhibitory effect of the carbazole-based fluorophores of the present invention on Aβ fibril growth was further investigated by measuring the (average) length of the Aβ fibrils formed after incubation of the Aβ monomers for 60 min with additions of SLOH at different time points during this period (FIG. 9). Parallel experiments conducted without any addition of SLOH were used as controls. FIG. 9 shows that an addition of SLOH to the Aβ monomer strongly arrests its fibril growth. These results clearly indicate that the inhibitory effect of these carbazole-based fluorophores on Aβ aggregation is instantaneous. To ascertain its potential clinical application, the cytotoxicities of these carbazole-based molecules, SLOH, SLOH-Pr, Me-SLM, and SAOH towards the neuronal cell, i.e., SH-SY5Y cell line, were investigated by MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] reduction assay. The results obtained (FIG. 10) showed that these molecules were essentially non-toxic (20%) to the neuronal cell particularly at low dosage. Since it is the Aβ oligomers and fibrils that are neurotoxic, further experiments with these carbazole-based molecules conducted in the presence of the Aβ monomer (non-toxic), the neurotoxic Aβ oligomers and fibrils showed that the neuronal cells became protected from the neurotoxic effects of the Aβ oligomers and fibrils when incubated with carbazole-based molecules SLOH and SAOH for 2 and 6 hours (FIG. 11). However, in order for the observed neuroprotective effect to be clinically useful, these molecules need to be able to pass through the blood-brain barrier. The ability of these molecules to penetrate the blood-brain barrier was demonstrated in transgenic mice (FIG. 12). In addition, FIG. 12d-f shows the selectivity of SLOH towards Aβ plaques as confirmed with Aβ antibody which was used to identify the Aβ plaques in transgenic mice's brain. In summary, carbazole-based fluorophores of the present invention have been shown to bind to Aβ(1-40) and Aβ(1-42) as well as Aβ aggregates with dramatic fluorescence enhancement, thus allowing their direct imaging and labeling as well as the use of TIRFM technique to study the effects of these molecules on Aβ aggregation/fibrillation. Some embodiments of the carbazole-based fluorophores, for instance, SLOH and SAOH, have been shown to be a potent inhibitor of Aβ aggregation, non-toxic and exhibiting a protective effect against the neurotoxic activities of the Aβ oligomers and fibrils towards neuronal cells. These properties, together with the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier and target the Aβ plaques, render the fluorophores of the present invention a potential neuroprotective and, perhaps, therapeutic agent for Alzheimer's disease. The following compositions according to the invention were prepared and exemplified as shown in FIG. 13. By adapting the convergent approach established previously, the Knoevenagel reaction of carbazolyl-3-aldehyde and the corresponding 4-methylpyridium or 4-methylquinolinium halide was used as the key step to synthesize various carbazole-based cyanines. Alkylation of carbazole with ethylene glycol chloride and methyl iodide in the presence of NaH in DMF gave alkylated carbazole 1a and 1b respectively. Monobromination of 1a and 1b in the presence of NBS gave alkylated 3-bromocarbazole, 2a and 2b, respectively. Formylation of 2a and 2b via lithiation bromide exchange at low temperature followed by the subsequent quenching with DMF afforded carbazolyl-3-aldehyde, 3a and 3b, respectively, in moderate yield. Alkylation of lepidine or picoline was carried out in methanol or acetonitrile affording the corresponding halide, 4-9 in good to high yield. The Knoevenagel reaction of aldehyde 3a or 3b and the corresponding 4-methylpyridium or 4-methylquinolinium halide in the presence of piperidine in ethanol afforded the corresponding carbazole-based cyanines in a moderate yield. For the acridine-based cyanines dyes, 9-methylacridine was first brominated with NBS affording brominated product 10, which gave phosphonate ester 11 by refluxing with triethyl phosphite. Condensation of phosphonate 11 and aldehyde 3a in the presence of NaH afforded 12, which was alkylated with methyl iodide and 2-iodoethanol to give SAM and SAOH, respectively. All the cyanines were fully characterized with spectroscopic techniques and found to be in good agreement with its structure. All the solvents were dried by the standard methods wherever needed. 1H NMR spectra were recorded using a Bruker-400 NMR spectrometer and referenced to the residue CHCl3 7.26 ppm or DMSO-d6 2.5 ppm. 13C NMR spectra were recorded using a Bruker-400 NMR spectrometer and referenced to the CDCl3 77 ppm or DMSO-d6 39.5 ppm. Mass Spectroscopy (MS) measurements were carried out by using fast atom bombardment on the API ASTER Pulser I Hybrid Mass Spectrometer or matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) technique. Elemental analysis was carried on the CARLO ERBA 1106 Elemental Analyzer. Compound 8 and SPM were synthesized according to previous procedure. Apart from the use in direct imaging or labeling of Aβ aggregates, the carbazole-based fluorophores of the present invention is also useful as a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agent that bind beta amyloid peptides. By conjugating appropriate paramagnetic metal complexes to these carbazole-based fluorophores, these compounds can potentially be developed into beta-amyloid peptide-specific MRI contrast agents. To convert these Aβ fibril-specific carbazole-based fluorophores dyes into MRI contrast agents, we can attach strongly paramagnetic and kinetically inert metal complexes, such as the gadolinium(III), iron(III), and manganese(II) complexes, via the R1 side chain of the carbazole moiety to these fluorophores. Gd(III)-based chelates, such as [Gd(DTPA)(H2O)]2− (DTPA=diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid), approved for clinical use in 1988 and commercially known as Magnevist, are attractive candidates. Recently, further enhancement of the MRI contrast properties of these Gd(III) complexes was achieved by allowing the coordination of a second inner-sphere water molecule, which raised the relaxivity of the conventional Gd(III) contrast agents from 4-5 mM−1s−1 (at 20 MHz field strength) to 10.5 mM−1s−1, in the Gd-TREN-1-Me-3,2-HOPO complex, [1] (where TREN=tris(2-aminoethyl), HOPO=hydroxypyridinone, structure shown below). A slight modification of one of the hydroxypyridinone ligands of the Gd(III) complex, shown in [2], allows flexible attachment to the carbazole moiety of A fibril-specific dyes via, for example, a polyethylene glycol (PEG) linkage. More recently, Parker and coworkers (2010) have designed a series of 1H/19F dual MR imaging agents based on CF3-labeled lanthanide(III) complexes (Ln=Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm) with amide-substituted 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane ligand. An example of this ligand system bearing a CF3 reporter group is shown in [3]. The advantage of 19F MRI is the exquisite sensitivity of the 19F shift of the reporter group to its local chemical environment, thus opening up the possibility of responsive MRI to detect changes in local pH, oxygen stress, etc. The fact that standard MRI instruments can be easily tuned from 1H to 19F nuclei, which have very similar magnetic properties, is an added bonus of this technique. This ligand system is also amenable to coupling (e.g., at the −X or −Y positions indicated) to the carbazole moiety of the carbazole-based fluorophores dyes.
