CA 02753374 2011-09-19 Stackable form This invention relates generally to building blocks and more specifically to a self supporting stackable material block form. The method and apparatus is used to facilitate and improve the creation of structures and shapes out of snow or other formable material. Background of the Invention When building a material structure such as a snow fort or castle it is ideal that the process move forward quickly in order to maintain interest in the project. The easier it is to create and construct the more fun and time the user will have to enjoy it. Traditionally, buckets and storage containers are used to form blocks of snow, however tipping or stacking the containers to empty them in an attempt to gain wall height often results in damaged or broken material blocks. Household containers have a narrow base and a wide top making stacking one block on top of another extremely difficult. In addition the material blocks are often too heavy for children to lift and stack to an adequate building height. Container style material block makers that are currently on the market are much too small and take to much time to complete a decent structure. More importantly kids and adults are often exposed to dangerous situations when creating a snow shelter from a mound of snow, typically a hole is dug in the center of a mound of snow creating a void space to play in. The weight of the roof of the created structure is a safety hazard due to cave-ins. By using a stackable form to build vertical walls of snow the risk of cave-ins is virtually eliminated, in addition the stackable form users no longer have to drag, push or lift blocks of snow or other material instead they can continuously create, in a top loading manner, their own blank canvas of the desired material block or combination of blocks to build, carve or mould to a desired shape or structure. By facilitating the material block making process the users are more inclined to participate, continue, complete and safely enjoy their projects. CA 02753374 2011-09-19 In reference to the secondary function of the invention where a plurality of stackable forms are used to be stacked on top of each other, the invention allows structures to be built safely and efficiently instead of using traditional building blocks or materials that have to be cut, nailed and screwed together such as lumber, wood planks and sh√¨ngles when building structures such as a house, playhouse, shed or fort, Summary of the Invention The present invention is directed to two building systems both are founded on the same design principles. One is a system that allows users to create multiple tiers of material blocks without having to lift, flip and empty heavy containers of material such as snow and sand. In a preferred embodiment of a stackable form, a portable collapsible open ended top and bottom form is provided including a U-shaped bottom support member. The stackable form is opened and placed on a relatively fiat snowy surface forming a geometric volume. The stackable form is filled with snow and compacted level to the upper edges of the vertical wall members. The user then pulls the stackable form up vertically using the carrying handles exposing a snow block. The support member is then placed on top of the stackable forms previously created block members top surface. The stackable form is then placed on top of the support member and secured in place by support openings on two opposing vertical wall members lower edges. The depth of the support openings permit the stackable forms lower edge to overlap on the previously formed block members surface in a downward direction which aligns and secures its position. Once the stackable form is re-filled with the desired material and compacted the stackable form is vertically removed using its carrying handle exposing a second newly created block member, the support member is then horizontally pulled out of the previously created block member, the process is continued as desired. The other building system is when a series of stackable forms can be stacked on top of additional stackable forms with the use of multiple support members. CA 02753374 2011-09-19 In a preferred embodiment of a stackable form structure the stackable forms including upper and lower support openings on a plurality of the stackable forms vertical wall members upper and lower edges. A stackable form is placed on the ground, the support members are then placed in the upper support openings and a second stackable form is then placed on top of the support member and secured in place by the lower support openings of the second stackable forms lower edges. The depth of the upper and lower support openings, each generally one quarter of the vertical wall members' height permits the stackable forms joining perimeter edges to rest on top of each other securing, unifying and solidifying the structure.
