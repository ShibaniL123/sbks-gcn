INSECTICIDAL COMPOSITIONS AND METHODS OF USING THE SAME CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS [0001] This application claims the benefit of priority to co-pending U.S. Provisional Patent Applications Nos. 61/507,557 filed on July 13, 2011, 61/543,180, filed on October 4, 2011, and 61/580,427, filed on December 27, 2011. The entire contents of each of these applications are incorporated into this specification by reference in their entireties. FIELD [0002] This specification relates to compositions and methods useful for insect control. BACKGROUND [0003] Many types of insecticides have been used to kill mosquitoes and other insect pests. Nevertheless, many insecticides have disadvantages. Some insecticides are toxic to humans, are harmful to the environment, or have limited efficacy. Further, there is an increasing demand for compositions containing naturally occurring or so-called organic compounds. Accordingly, there is a continuing need for organic compounds having improved insecticidal properties, while being substantially non-toxic or only mildly toxic to humans. [0004] Certain plant species produce essential oils that serve as natural sources of insect repellents, insecticides, fragrances, or other useful chemicals. For example, perilla oil and certain of its components have been used in a variety of applications, including in varnishes, in the production of inks and linoleums, and in the culinary field as a marinade. [0005] Perilla oil is extracted from annual herbs belonging to the genus Perilla through several methods, including but not limited to cold pressing of the seeds or steam distillation of the leaves. Two types of perilla oil are available, seed and leaf extracts. The major component of perilla seed extract is linolenic acid, and the major components of perilla leaf extract are perillaldehyde, limonene, 3-caryophyllene, and farnesene. SUMMARY [0006] This specification demonstrates the ability of perilla oil and some of its components to act as a synergist of insecticides such as pyrethrum, pyrethrins, pyrethroids, spinosad, neonicotinoids, sulfoxoflor, carbamates, organophosphates, and organochlorines. The disclosure also demonstrates that perilla oil, perilla oil components, and certain periflaidehyde and carvone analogs can be used as synergists for insecticides in certain compositions. The disclosure further demonstrates that certain compounds having a modified cyclohexane ring containing a substituted or unsubstituted methyl group can be used as synergists for insecticides in certain compositions. [0006A] In one aspect, the present invention provides an insecticidal composition comprising an insecticide and an active agent present in an amount of about 1% to 99% by weight of the composition, wherein the active agent is perilia oil, and wherein the insecticide is selected from the group consisting of pyrethrin, sprnosad, pyrethriod and neonicotinoid. [0006BJ In another aspect, the present invention provides a method for controlling insects, the method comprising contacting a population of insects with an effective amount of the composition described above, [00071 in some aspects, an insecticidal composition is provided comprising an insecticide and an active agent present in an amount of about 1% to 99% (by weight) of the composition. The active agent can be perilla oil, a perilla oil component, or a periflaidehyde or carvone analog. For example, the active agent can be selected from the group consisting of farnesene, periflaidehyde, linoienic acid, caryophyliene, fimonene (including D-fimonene), carvone, perillyl alcohol, plnene, Unalool, germacrene, bergamotene, and spathulenol, or the active agent can be selected from the group consisting of fimonene (including D-fimonene), perillyl alcohol (including (SH“)-periflyl alcohol), periilic acid (including (SH-J-periliic acid), myrtenal (including (1R)-{-)~ myrtenai), and 3-methyl-1~cyciohexene~1-carboxaldehyde. The active agent can also be any combination of these perilla oil components and perillaidehyde or carvone analogs. [00081 In some embodiments, the active agent is a compound of Formula (I): 4№2№№ J {ϋ№Μ)ηη) Alt R is selected from the group consisting of ~CH2OH, ~GHG, and -COOR3; R2 is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, alkyl, and alkenyl; R3 is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen and alkyl; R4 is hydrogen, or R4 and R2 are taken together with the atoms to which they are attached to form an optionally substituted ring; and Ra is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen and alkyl. iGwaswsj ρ℮32κΑυ [0009] The insecticide in the compositions can be present at less than about 95% by weight, less than about 60% by weight or in other amounts as described is this specification and can comprise one or more of a pyrethrin, pyrethroid, neonicotinoid, chlofenapyr, ethiprole, sulfoxoflor, carbamate, organophosphate, or organochlorine. Examples of pyrethrin include one or more of jasmolin-l, cinerin-l, pyrethrin-l, jasmolin-ll, cinerin-ll, or pyrethrin-ll.

[0010] In some aspects, the composition includes one or more of mineral oil, glycerol, or a diluent that provides viscosity modifying properties. The composition can be formulated to be suitable for application as an aerosol, fog, mist, spray, vapor, ultra low volume spray (ULV), surface contact treatment, or a combination thereof. [0011] In other aspects, a method for controlling insects is provided, in which a population of insects, such as mosquitoes, is contacted with an effective amount of a composition described in this specification. The population of insects can be controlled by topically applying the composition to the population in an amount sufficient to kill at least 25%, 50%, or any proportion disclosed in this specification of the population. The composition can be applied by aerosol or as a mist, fog, vapor, spray, ULV spray, or surface contact treatment or as a combination of any of these methods. [0012] In other aspects, a method for controlling insect pests on a plant is provided by contacting a transgenic plant with an insecticide or an active agent selected from the group consisting of (i) perilla oil; (ii) a perilla oil component selected from the group consisting of farnesene, perillaldehyde, linolenic acid, caryophyllene, limonene, carvone, perillyl alcohol, pinene, linalool, germacrene, bergamotene, and spathulenol; and (iii) a perillaldehyde or carvone analog.

The active agent has a synergistic effect on insecticidal activity in the plant and controls the insect pests. [0014] Other aspects of the disclosure will become apparent by consideration of the detailed description and accompanying drawings. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS [0015] Figure 1 is a schematic representation of the experimental setup for the field study described in Example 58. [0016] Figure 2 is a chart showing the activity of Ρ450 cytochrome enzyme (Ρ450) in the presence or absence of inhibitors as described in Example 59. The control treatment contained acetone; piperonyl butoxide (ΡΒΟ), a known cytochrome Ρ450 inhibitor, was used as a positive control. The chart shows the inhibition potency of perillaldehyde (perilla) when present at 1% and 10%. DETAILED DESCRIPTION [0017] This specification broadly relates to insecticidal compositions and methods of using the same. The compositions and methods are effective and selective in killing insects. This invention describes the use of perilla oil, its components, or other related compounds to synergize the activity of non-perilla-oil-related insecticides. Accordingly, for the purposes of this specification, an insecticide refers to a compound having insecticidal activity, other than perilla oil, one of its components, a perillaldehyde analog, or the other related synergists described in this specification. [0018] In some embodiments, an active agent comprises perilla oil, one of its components, or a perillaldehyde analog. Perilla oil, perilla oil components, and perillaldehyde analogs can be extracted from plant sources or can be synthesized. Parts of the plant used to extract these compounds include, but are not limited to, at least one of the flower, stem, leaf, seed, fruit, or fruit peel of the plant. [0019] Plant sources may include plants of the genus Perilla, including, but not limited to, green varieties - Perilla frutescens (L.) Britt, var. crispa, var. arguta, var. arcuta, var. stricta, Perilla ocymoides L. and Perilla crispa var. ocymoides - and the purple leaf varieties - Perilla frutescens var. acuta, var. typica, var. stricta, var. crisp, var. atropurpurea, var. crispa, var. nankinensis, var. olifera, var. japonica, var. citriodora, Perilla crispa (Thunb.), and Perilla nankinensis (Lour.). [0020] Perilla oil can be extracted from a plant by any means known in the art, including, but not limited to, at least one of pressing, grinding, mashing, distillation such as steam distillation, cold pressure extraction, chromatography, a suitable solvent extraction such as liquid C02 extraction, and methanol extraction of a part or combination of parts of the plant source. [0021] Perilla oil components and certain perillaldehyde analogs may be derived or isolated (e.g., extracted) from perilla oil or from a plant source, as described above. Perillaldehyde, a component of perilla oil, can also be extracted from other plant sources outside of the genus Perilla including, but not limited to, Sium latifolium, Citrus reticulata (e.g., the peels of the fruit), Limnophila geoffrayi, Laser tribolium, Limnophiliz aromatica, Laserpitium siler, Conyza newii, Cuminum cyminum, and Plectranthus marruboides.

Perillic acid is also a byproduct of limonene metabolism. Limonene is a chiral molecule and is found in biological sources such as citrus fruits as D-limonene (also refered to as (+)-limonene), which is the (R)-enantiomer. Racemic limonene is known as dipentene. Perilla oil components and perillaldehyde analogs can be isolated by any means known in the art including, but not limited to, distillation such as steam distillation, cold pressure extraction, chromatography, solvent extraction such as liquid C02 extraction or methanol extraction, or a combination thereof. Perilla oil components and perillaldehyde analogs can be chemically synthesized by means known in the art. Perilla oil components and perillaldehyde analogs can be purchased from various vendors, for example, Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) or City Chemical (West Haven, CT). [0022] In some embodiments, an active agent comprises at least one isolated or synthesized perilla oil component. Perilla oil components are known in the art and include, but are not limited to, those set forth in Table A. Perilla oil components include, but are not limited to, farnesene, perillaldehyde, linolenic acid, caryophyllene (including 3-caryphyollene), limonene (including D-limonene), perillyl alcohol (including (S)-(-)-perillyl alcohol), perillic acid, carvone (including (R)-carvone and (S)-carvone), pinene (including pinene alpha and pinene beta), linalool, germacrene, bergamotene, and spathulenol.

In particular, for the purposes of this specification, perillaldehyde analogs are limonene (including D-limonene), perillyl alcohol (including (S)-(-)perillyl alcohol), perillic acid (including (S)-(-)-perillic acid), myrtenal (including (IR)-(-)-myrtenal), 3-methyl-1 -cyclohexene-1 -carboxaldehyde, and any other analog of perillaldehyde that includes substituents on the perillaldehyde cyclohexene ring that do not eliminate the ability of the analog to act as a synergist with the insecticides described in this specification. [0024] In some embodiments, an active agent comprises a perillaldehyde analog of Formula (A): wherein: R1 is selected from the group consisting of-CH2OH, -CHO, and -COORa; R2 is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, alkyl, and alkenyl; R3 is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen and alkyl; R4 is hydrogen, or R4 and R2 are taken together with the atoms to which they are attached to form an optionally substituted ring; and Ra is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen and alkyl. [0025] The term "alkyl" refers to a straight or branched saturated hydrocarbon chain. Alkyl groups may include a specified number of carbon atoms. For example, C1-C12 alkyl indicates that the alkyl group may have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, or 12 carbon atoms. An alkyl group may be, e.g., a C1-C12 alkyl group, a C1-C10 alkyl group, a CrC8 alkyl group, a CrC6 alkyl group, or a C-1-C4 alkyl group. For example, exemplary C-1-C4 alkyl groups include methyl, ethyl, ηpropyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, sec-butyl, isobutyl and tert-butyl groups. An alkyl group may be optionally substituted with one or more substituents. [0026] The term "alkenyl" refers to a straight or branched hydrocarbon chain having one or more double bonds. Alkenyl groups may include a specified number of carbon atoms. For example, C2-C12 alkenyl indicates that the alkenyl group may have 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, or 12 carbon atoms. An alkenyl group may be, e.g., a C2-C12 alkenyl group, a C2-C10 alkenyl group, a C2-C8 alkenyl group, a C2-C6 alkenyl group, or a C2-C4 alkenyl group. Examples of alkenyl groups include but are not limited to allyl, propenyl, 2-butenyl, 3-hexenyl, and 3-octenyl groups. One of the double bond carbons may optionally be the point of attachment of the alkenyl substituent. An alkenyl group may be optionally substituted with one or more substituents. [0027] Substituents may include hydroxy, alkoxy (e.g., methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy, butoxy, and pentoxy), aryloxy groups (e.g., phenoxy, chlorophenoxy, tolyloxy, methoxyphenoxy, benzyloxy, alkyloxycarbonylphenoxy, and acyloxyphenoxy), acyloxy groups (e.g., propionyloxy, benzoyloxy, and acetoxy), carbamoyloxy groups, carboxy groups, mercapto groups, alkylthio groups, acylthio groups, arylthio groups (e.g., phenylthio, chlorophenylthio, alkylphenylthio, alkoxyphenylthio, benzylthio, and alkyloxycarbonylphenylthio), halogen atoms, cyano groups, monovalent hydrocarbon groups, substituted monovalent hydrocarbon groups, heterogeneous groups, aromatic groups (e.g., phenyl and tolyl), substituted aromatic groups (e.g., alkoxphenyl, alkoxycarbonylphenyl, and halophenyl), heterocyclic groups, heteroaromatic groups, and amino groups (e.g., amino, mono- and di- alkylamino having 1 to 3 carbon atoms, methylphenylamino, methylbenzylamino, alkanylamido groups of 1 to 3 carbon atoms, carbamamido, ureido, and guanidino), or any combination thereof. [0028] In some embodiments, an active agent comprises at least one of certain carvone analogs that have a structure similar to carvone. These analogs retain at least some of the activity of carvone. It is known in the art that structural modifications can be made to carvone to affect the physical properties of carvone, such as to reduce its volatility. See, e.g., Olof Smitt, Thesis entitled Syntheses of Allelochemicals for Insect Control (2002), Mid Sweden University, ISSN 1100-7974, ISBN 91-7283-277-0, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated into this specification by reference. Indeed, the modifications made to the structure of carvone can in some cases enhance the biological activity of the analog in the composition as compared to carvone. Carvone analogs are shown below in Formulas Β-Κ and include epoxycarvone, hydroxydihydrocarvone, and carvone diols. [0029] In some embodiments, an active agent comprises a synergist which has a modified cyclohexene ring containing a substituted or unsubstituted methyl group and other substituents on the ring. Examples of synergists having such a modified cyclohexene ring include, but are not limited to, isophorone, 1-methyl-1-cyclohexene, 1 -tert-butyl-1 -cyclohexene, 3,5-dimethyl-2-cyclohexen-1-one, 4-methycyclohexene, 7,8-dihydro-a-ionone, 2,4-dimethyl-3-cyclohexenecarboxaldehyde, trivertal, 3-cyclohexene-1-methanol, and terpinolene. [0030] In some embodiments, the insecticide includes, but is not limited to, pyrethrum, pyrethrins, pyrethroids, spinosad, neonicotinoids, sulfoxoflor, carbamates, organophosphates, and organochlorines. [0031] The insecticide can be present in an amount of at least about 0.005%, at least about 0.01%, at least about 0.05%, at least about 0.1%, at least about 0.5%, at least about 1%, at least about 2%, or at least about 3%, at least about 4%, at least about 6%, at least about 8%, at least about 10%, at least about 12%, at least about 15%, at least about 20%, at least about 25%, at least about 30%, at least about 35%, at least about 40%, at least about 50% or at least about 55%, at least about 60%, at least about 65%, at least about 70%, at least about 75%, at least about 80%, at least about 85%, at least about 90%, at least about 95%, and less than about 95%, less than about 90%, less than about 80%, less than about 75%, less than about 70%, less than about 65%, less than about 60%, less than about 55%, less than about 50%, less than about 45%, less than about 35%, less than about 30%, less than about 25%, less than about 20%, less than about 15%, less than about 10%, less than about 5%, less than about 2.5%, less than about 2%, less than about 1%, less than about 0.5%, or less than about 0.1% by weight of the composition. [0032] In some embodiments, the composition comprises an insecticide and active agent as described in this specification, and is substantially free of, or excludes any amount of, any other insecticide synergist such as piperonyl butoxide (ΡΒΟ), N-octyl bicycloheptene dicarboximide (MGK-264), piprotal, propyl isome, sesamex, sesamolin, or sulfoxide. The composition may be substantially free of, or exclude any amount of, one or more of piperonyl butoxide (ΡΒΟ), Νoctyl bicycloheptene dicarboximide (MGK-264), piprotal, propyl isome, sesamex, sesamolin, or sulfoxide in any combination. [0033] As used in this specification, the term “pyrethrum” refers to a crude extract composition that is derived from chrysanthemum-like flowers primarily grown in Kenya, Tanzania, and Australia (e.g., Τ. cinerariaefolium, C. cinerariaefolium, and C. coccineum) and comprises a mixture of the naturally occurring insecticidal ester compounds known as the “pyrethrins,” as further detailed in U.S. Patent Application No. 13/175,405, filed July 1, 2011, which is incorporated into this specification by reference in its entirety. “Pyrethrins” is used in this specification as a collective term given to any combination of the six ester compounds (including refined pyrethrum) having the general Formula L and detailed in Table 1. Table 1. Naturally Occurring Pyrethrin Esters. Common Name CAS Number Ri r2 Pyrethrins I Jasmolin-I 4466-14-2 ch3 ch2ch3 Cinerin-I 25402-06-6 ch3 ch3 Pyrethrin-I 121-21-1 ch3 ch=ch2 Pyrethrins II Jasmolin-ll 1172-63-0 CH3OC(0) ch2ch3 Cinerin-ll 121-20-0 CH3OC(0) ch3 Pyrethrin-I I 121-29-9 CH3OC(0) ch=ch2 [0034] The term “pyrethrin ester” or “pyrethrin” is used in this specification to refer to one or a combination of two or more of the naturally occurring compounds defined in Table 1. [0035] While the terms “pyrethrins” and “pyrethrum” are sometimes used interchangeably, “pyrethrum” should be understood here to encompass crude extracts that contain pyrethrins. The pyrethrins in any given pyrethrum extract vary in relative amount, depending on factors such as the plant variety, where it is grown, and the time of harvest. [0036] Because it is not currently commercially advantageous to separate and isolate individual pyrethrin esters from each other, the pyrethrins content in pyrethrum extract is typically analyzed for total content of pyrethrins. While variable, the current state of the art 12 typically allows for the total pyrethrins (i.e., pyrethrins I and pyrethrins II) to constitute about 45 to 55% (by weight) of a pyrethrum extract. Besides the pesticidially active esters mentioned above, many plant components may be present in the pyrethrum extract. This extract is typically a high boiling, viscous liquid that is prone to oxidation in air, might be difficult to store for extended periods of time, and can be readily diluted in a vegetable-based oil carrier to provide a Manufacturing Use Product (MUP) containing about 20% pyrethrins. This provides for a longer shelf life and has the added advantage of being NOSB (National Organic Standards Board) compliant. Therefore, pyrethrins are approved for use in organic production operations. Pyrethrins are commercially available from several sources throughout the world and, in the United States, are available from several sources including the product sold under the trade name Pyganic® MUP 20 by MGK (Minneapolis, ΜΝ). Pyganic® MUP 20 contains about 20% pyrethrins by weight. When the term “MUP 20” is used in this specification it refers to a MUP comprising about 20% pyrethrins by weight and includes, but is not limited to, Pyganic® MUP 20. [0037] The term “pyrethroid” is understood in the art to mean one or more synthetic compounds that act as an insecticide and are adapted from the chemical structure of Formula L. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (ΕΡΑ) has established two general classes of pyrethroids. Pyrethroids that include an a-cyano group (C-CN) bonded to the ester oxygen (see Formula L) are referred to as Type II pyrethroids, while pyrethroids lacking an a-cyano group are referred to as Type I pyrethroids. See, e.g., ΕΡΑ Office of Pesticide Programs Memorandum “Pyrethroids: Evaluation of Data from Developmental Neurotoxicity Studies and Consideration of Comparison Sensitivity” (January 20, 2010). Non-limiting examples of pyrethroids include acrinathrin, allethrin, benfluthrin, benzylnorthrin, bioallethrin, bioethanomethrin, bioresmethrin, bifenthrin, cyclethin, cycloprothrin, cyfluthrin, beta-cyfluthrin, gamma-cyhalothrin, lamdba-cyhalothrin, cypermethrin, alpha-cypermethrin, beta-cypermethrin, zeta-cypermethrin, cyphenothrin, deltamethrin, empenthrin, esbiothrin, esfenvalerate, etofenprox, fenfluthrin, fenpropathrin, fenvalerate, flucythrinate, flumethrin, imiprothin, isopyrethrin I, kadethrin, metofluthrin, permethrin, 1RS cis-permethrin, phenothrin, prallethrin, resmethrin, silafluofen, sumithrin (d-phenothrin), tau-fluvalinate, tefluthrin, tetramethrin, tralomethrin, transfluthrin, and isomers of these compounds. Etofenprox, a recently registered pyrethroid, contains an ether bond as its central linkage rather than an ester bond. In certain embodiments, the pyrethroid comprises at least one of permethrin, sumithrin, prallethrin, resmethrin, etofenprox, allethrin, alpha-cypermethrin, bifenthrin beta-cypermethrin, cyfluthrin, cypermethrin, deltamethrin, esfenvalerate, etofenprox, lamdba-cyhalothrin, and zeta-cypermethrin, which may be used with, for example, perilla oil, perillaldehyde or carvone.

Quistad (eds.), Oxford University Press, 1995; and “Pyrethrins & Pyrethroids” 1998 Fact Sheet published by the National Pesticide Telecommunications Network (ΝΡΤΝ) at Oregon State University, Corvallis, Oregon. [0039] Spinosad is an insecticide derived from Saccharopolyspora spinosa. S. spinosa occurs in over 20 natural forms, and over 200 synthetic forms (spinosoids). As used in this specification, spinosad includes at least one of Spinosyn A, Spinosyn D, or a combination thereof. [0040] Neonicotinoids are insecticides that act on the central nervous system of insects. Neonicotinoids include, but are not limited to, acetamiprid, clothianidin, dinotefuran, imidacloprid, nitenpyram, thiacloprid, and thiamethoxam.

In some embodiments, compositions may comprise 2% perillaldehyde analog. In some embodiments, compositions may comprise 30% perillaldehyde and 30% permethrin. [0047] In addition to a first active agent that consists of perilla oil or one of its components or a perillaldehyde or carvone analog or other synergist described in this specification in an amount described above, and depending on the amount of the first active agent, compositions may comprise a second active agent, such as a different perilla oil component, perillaldehyde or carvone analog, or synergist in the amounts described in the preceding paragraph.

[0050] Compositions may further comprise a viscosity modifier such as one or more of mineral oil or glycerol. “Mineral oil” as used in this specification relates to the commonly known product of the same name, which is a by-product of the distillation of petroleum (crude oil) to make gasoline and other products. Mineral oil is typically transparent and colorless and comprises complex mixtures of long chain aliphatic compounds often ranging in size from C15-C40. Depending on the refining process and source of crude oil, mineral oils can also include paraffinic, naphthenic, and aromatic compounds in varying weight percentages. Synonymous names for mineral oil can include “paraffin oil” or “white mineral oil” among other common names. Mineral oil is available from any number of commercial distributors (e.g., Brenntag, ProChem, Inc.). Non-limiting examples of “mineral oil” include those identified by CAS registry numbers: 8012-95-1, 8020-83-5, 8042-47-5, 72623-84-8, 72623-86-0, 72623-87-1, 64741-88-4, 64741-89-5, 64742-54-7, 64742-55-8, 64742-56-9, and 64742-65-0. The compositions may comprise a viscosity modifier, such as mineral oil glycerol, or any combination of viscosity modifiers, in an amount of at least about 10%, at least about 15%, at least about 20%, at least about 25%, at least about 30%, at least about 35%, at least about 40%, at least about 45%, at least about 50%, at least about 55%, at least about 60%, at least about 65%, or at least about 70% by weight of the composition. The compositions may comprise a viscosity modifier, such as mineral oil, glycerol, or any combination of viscosity modifiers, in an amount of less than about 99%, less than about 95%, less than about 90%, less than about 85%, or less than about 80% by weight of the composition. The compositions may comprise a viscosity modifier, such as mineral oil, glycerol, or a combination of viscosity modifiers, in an amount of about 10% to about 99%, about 15% to about 99%, about 20% to about 99%, about 25% to about 99%, about 30% to about 99%, about 35% to about 99%, about 40% to about 99%, about 45% to about 99%, about 50% to about 99%, about 55% to about 99%, about 60% to about 99%, about 65% to about 99%, about 70% to about 99%, about 70% to about 95%, about 70% to about 90%, about 60% to about 90%, about 50% to about 90%, about 40% to about 90%, about 30% to about 90%, about 20% to about 90%, about 10% to about 90%, about 70% to about 85%, or about 70% to about 80% by weight of the composition. [0051] In some embodiments, a composition can include one or more carriers and/or diluents such as, for example, any solid or liquid carrier or diluent that is commonly used in pesticidal, agricultural, or horticultural compositions. Suitably, any included additional carrier or diluent will not reduce the insecticidal efficacy of the composition, relative to the efficacy of the composition in the absence of the additional component. Carriers and diluents can include, for example, solvents (e.g., water, alcohols, petroleum distillates, acids, and esters); vegetable (including, but not limited to, methylated vegetable) and/or plant-based oils as well as ester derivatives thereof (e.g., wintergreen oil, cedarwood oil, rosemary oil, peppermint oil, geraniol, rose oil, palmarosa oil, citronella oil, citrus oils (e.g., lemon, lime, and orange), dillweed oil, corn oil, sesame oil, soybean oil, palm oil, vegetable oil, olive oil, peanut oil, and canola oil). The composition can include varying amounts of other components such as, for example, surfactants (e.g., non-ionic, anionic, cationic, and zwitterionic surfactants); fatty acids and fatty acid esters of plant oils (e.g., methyl palmitate/oleate/linoleate); and other auxiliary ingredients such as, for example, emulsifiers, dispersants, stabilizers, suspending agents, penetrants, coloring agents/dyes, UV-absorbing agents, and fragrances, as necessary or desired. The compositions may comprise carrier or diluent in an amount of at least about 5% or at least about 10% by weight of the composition. The compositions may comprise carrier or diluent in an amount of less than about 90% or less than about 80% by weight of the composition. The compositions may comprise carrier or diluent in an amount of about 5% to about 90%, or about 10% to about 80% by weight of the composition. Components other than active agent(s) can be included in the compositions in any amount as long as the composition has some amount of insecticidal efficacy. [0052] Components of a composition can have a synergistic or additive effect on insecticidal activity. Components have an additive effect when the effect of the combination is equal to the sum of the effects of each individual component. In contrast, components have a synergistic effect when the effect of the combination exceeds the sum of the effects of the components when applied individually. The effect (£) of a combination of two compounds may be calculated using the Colby formula (1) (S. R. Colby, "Calculating Synergistic and Antagonistic Responses of Herbicide Combinations", Weeds 1967, 15, 20-22): Ε = Χ + Υ-^^- (1) 100 wherein X is the kill rate, expressed as a percentage of the untreated control, when employing active compound X’ at an application rate of m g/ha or in a concentration of m ppm, pg, or other appropriate unit; wherein Υ is the kill rate, expressed as a percentage of the untreated control, when employing active compound Y’ at an application rate of η g/ha or in a concentration of η ppm, pg, or other appropriate unit; wherein Ε is the kill rate, expressed as a percentage of the untreated control, when employing active compounds X’ and Y’ at application rates of m and η g/ha or in a concentration of m and η ppm. If the actual insecticidal kill rate is the calculated value (Ε), then the action of the combination is additive. If the actual insecticidal kill rate exceeds the calculated value (Ε), then the action of the combination is super-additive, that is, a synergistic effect is present. If the insecticidal kill rate is lower than the calculated value (Ε), then the action of the combination is considered antagonistic. [0053] As shown in the Examples, perilla oil and some of its components, a perillaldehyde or carvone analog, or other synergist can have synergistic activity with insecticides such as pyrethrum, pyrethrins, pyrethroids, spinosad, neonicotinoids, sulfoxoflor, carbamates, organophosphates, and organochlorines. The nature of the synergistic activity is unknown; however, without being limited to theory, it is postulated that perilla oil, its components or a perillaldehyde or carvone analog or other related synergist may be preventing the degradation of insecticides by blocking detoxifying enzymes such as the oxidases (P450’s), esterases (COE’s), and transferases (GST’s), all of which have been implicated in rendering exogenous toxins such as insecticides inactive. [0054] As an example, compositions may comprise a perilla oil component, such as carvone, or a perillaldehyde or carvone analog, and an insecticide, such as a neonicotinoid, wherein the perilla oil component or perillaldehyde or carvone analog acts as a synergist to increase the efficacy or activity of the insecticide. The perilla oil component may be present in the composition with the insecticide. [0055] Embodiments include commercially useful formulations or “ready-to-use” application forms. In such formulations, the composition can be suitably provided as a mixture with other active compounds, for example, various additional insecticides, pesticides, fungicides, antimicrobials, and/or herbicides, as well as plant growth regulators, insect repellents, attractants, fertilizers, and/or fragrances, to expand the applicability of the insecticidal composition described in this specification. Embodiments provide for the compositions manufactured as formulations that are useful for insect control. In some embodiments, the composition can be formulated as an emulsion, a liquid concentrate, a sol (flowable agent), an aerosol (e.g., fogger), a liquid for ultra low volume (ULV) application, a mist, a spray, a vapor, a surface contact treatment, or incorporated into fibers or other materials such as a bednet, or the like, by any standard or conventional methods for mixing and manufacturing such formulations such as, for example, admixing active agent and an amount of mineral oil, glycerol, other viscosity modifier, or combination thereof, and optionally with one or more of any suitable additional inert ingredient that is used as a carrier, solvent, diluent, emulsifier, dispersant, stabilizers, suspending agent, or penetrant. The addition of these materials would depend on the active ingredient and the type of formulation and how it is intended to be applied. Compositions suitable for a particular application type can be formulated by those of skill in the art based on standard and conventional methods using guidance provided in this specification. [0056] In some embodiments, the composition can be formulated for application or delivery as an aerosol or a fog wherein the composition allows for the formation of droplets having an average diameter of about 1 pm to about 30 pm. Suitable compositions for such a formulation typically should have a viscosity that allows for the composition to atomize, but not be so thick as to clog the nozzle. Such viscosities can vary and be readily determined by one of skill in the art; however, a non-limiting common minimum viscosity is about 70 centistokes (cts). [0057] Plants or plant cells that have been modified to produce a perilla oil component, perillaldehyde or carvone analog, or synergist described in this specification are also provided. In certain embodiments, the plants or plant cells are modified to contain or express polynucleotides and/or polypeptides that facilitate the synthesis of, or increase the synthesis of, a perilla oil component or perillaldehyde analog or synergist in the plant. In certain embodiments, the plants are further modified to produce a pesticide in the plant, in addition to a perilla oil component, perillaldehyde analog, or combination thereof. In certain embodiments, the modified plants exhibit enhanced or increased resistance to insect or pest attack when compared with control plants or plant cells. In certain embodiments, the modified plants or plant cells exhibit enhanced growth, yield or a combination thereof relative to control plants. Modified plants may include vegetable, herb, spice, or fruit crops, as well as plants or crops producing cotton, flax, tobacco, hemp, rubber, nuts, and nursery stock and ornamental plant parts. Modified plants may include crops such as soybeans, corn, canola, oilseed rape, cotton, sugar beet, alfalfa, peanuts, wheat, barley, rye, oats, millet, and rice. [0058] Transgenic plants and methods of producing transgenic plants are provided. Such transgenic plants are produced, in certain embodiments, by introducing into a plant or plant cell one or more polynucleotides encoding one or more polypeptides that are involved in the synthesis of a perilla oil component or perillaldehyde analog, such that the polynucleotide is heterologously expressed and the perilla oil component or perillaldehyde analog is produced. In certain embodiments, expression of such polynucleotides or polypeptides may be down regulated, for example, by antisense, RNAi, micro RNAs, or sense suppression. In certain embodiments, the polynucleotide is provided as a construct in which a promoter is operably linked to the polynucleotide. The synthesis pathways and enzymes responsible for producing many perilla oil components and perillaldehyde analogs are known to those of skill in the art. For example, the isoprenyl synthesis pathway is well understood. Polypeptide enzymes that may be modified include, but are not limited to, monoterpene synthase, limonene-6-hydroxylase, (+)-trans-carveol dehydrogenase, mevalonate kinases, acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase, 3-hydroxy 3-methylgluteryl-CoA transferase, prenyl transferases, terpene synthases, transketolases. One of skill in the art would understand how to manipulate de novo, enhanced or reduced expression and activity of such polypeptides, such that production of a perilla oil component or perillaldehyde analog is effected, increased or decreased in the plant. Accordingly, the transgenic plant can be modified to express one or more of farnesene, perillaldehyde, linolenic acid, caryophyllene, limonene, carvone, perillyl alcohol, pinene, linalool, germacrene, bergamotene, and spathulenol wherein the active agent has a synergistic effect on insecticidal activity. In certain embodiments, methods for controlling insect pests on a transgenic plant are provided in which a transgenic plant expressing a perilla oil component or perillaldehyde analog is contacted with an insecticide using one or more methods of application described in this specification for the compositions of the invention. The perilla oil component or perillaldehyde analog is expressed in the plant in an amount effective to have a synergistic effect on the insecticide. [0059] As used in this specification, a “control plant” is a plant that is substantially equivalent to a test plant or modified plant in all parameters with the exception of the test parameters. For example, when referring to a plant into which a polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide involved in the synthesis of a perilla oil component or perillaldehyde analog, in certain embodiments, a control plant is an equivalent plant into which either no such polynucleotide has been introduced. In certain embodiments, a control plant is an equivalent plant into which a control polynucleotide has been introduced. In such instances, the control polynucleotide is one that is expected to result in little or no phenotypic effect on the plant. [0060] The polynucleotides encoding polypeptides involved in the synthesis of a perilla oil component or perillaldehyde analog may be introduced into a plant cell to produce a transgenic plant. As used in this specification, “introduced into a plant” with respect to polynucleotides encompasses the delivery of a polynucleotide into a plant, plant tissue, or plant cell using any suitable polynucleotide delivery method. Methods suitable for introducing polynucleotides into a plant useful in the practice of the present invention include, but are not limited to, freeze-thaw method, microparticle bombardment, direct DNA uptake, whisker-mediated transformation, electroporation, sonication, microinjection, plant virus-mediated, and Agrobacterium-mediated transfer to the plant. Any suitable Agrobacterium strain, vector, or vector system for transforming the plant may be employed according to the present invention. [0061] In some embodiments, a plant may be regenerated or grown from the plant, plant tissue or plant cell. Any suitable methods for regenerating or growing a plant from a plant cell or plant tissue can be used, such as, without limitation, tissue culture or regeneration from protoplasts. Plants may be regenerated by growing transformed plant cells on callus induction media, shoot induction media and/or root induction media. [0062] The polynucleotides to be introduced into the plant can be operably linked to a promoter sequence and can be provided as a construct. As used in this specification, a polynucleotide is “operably linked” when it is placed into a functional relationship with a second polynucleotide sequence. For instance, a promoter is operably linked to a coding sequence if the promoter is connected to the coding sequence such that it may effect transcription of the coding sequence. In various embodiments, the polynucleotides may be operably linked to at least one, at least two, at least three, at least four, at least five, or at least ten promoters. [0063] Promoters useful in the practice of the present invention include, but are not limited to, constitutive, inducible, temporally-regulated, developmental^ regulated, chemically regulated, tissue-preferred and tissue-specific promoters. Suitably, the promoter causes sufficient expression in the plant to produce the phenotypes described in this specification. Suitable promoters include, but are not limited to, the 35S promoter of the cauliflower mosaic virus, ubiquitine, tCUP cryptic constitutive promoter, the Rsyn7 promoter, pathogen-inducible promoters, the maize 1η2-2 promoter, the tobacco PR-1 a promoter, glucocorticoid-inducible promoters, and tetracycline-inducible and tetracycline-repressible promoters. [0064] The modified plant producing the perilla oil component or perillaldehyde analog component may have a composition comprising an insecticide, as described in this specification, applied such that the insecticide contacts the plant. Upon application of the insecticide, the perilla oil component is expressed or produced by the plant in an amount effective to act as a synergist to increase the efficacy or activity of the insecticide against an insect pest, such as those described in this specification. In plants modified to produce a pesticide and a perilla oil component or perillaldehyde, enhanced resistance to insect pests described in this specification may be achieved without application of a pesticide. [0065] Methods for Making Compositions [0066] The compositions can be generally prepared by any appropriate manufacturing processes and using any appropriate manufacturing equipment such as is known in the art. Suitably, the compositions can be prepared by combining the various components in an appropriate vessel (considering vessel size, amount of composition to be made and reactivity of components) with mixing (e.g., stirring) until a uniform or homogeneous composition is achieved. The various composition components can be added sequentially, with stirring between each addition to ensure dissolution and/or dispersion of the previous component. This may be followed by addition of one or more additional components (e.g., solvents, diluents, and carriers) with stirring to provide a homogeneous composition. [0067] Methods [0068] In some aspects, the disclosure provides methods for insect control comprising contacting an insect with an amount of any of the compositions described in this specification. As used in this specification, insects may include, but are not limited to, mosquitoes. “Mosquito” is understood to refer to any species of the approximately 3,500 species of the insect that is commonly associated with and given the common name, “mosquito.” Mosquitoes span 41 insect genera, including the non-limiting examples of Aedes, Culex, Anopheles (carrier of malaria), Coquillettidia, and Ochlerotatus. In embodiments described in this specification, a mosquito can refer to an adult mosquito or a larval mosquito or both. Thus, some embodiments describe methods or compositions wherein the insecticidal activity is referred to as mosquito “adulticide” or alternatively a mosquito “larvacide.” Insects may further include agronomic pests including, but not limited to, insects of the orders Lepidoptera (moths), Coleoptera (beetles), and Hemiptera (sucking insects, true bugs). Contacting an insect with a composition includes, but is not limited to, exposing an insect or a population of insects either by direct contact using any method described in this specification or known in the art, such as by topical application, or by indirect contact such as by inhalation of a vapor, spray, mist, aerosol or fog or by ingestion of the composition by the insect. [0069] Perilla oil, the perilla oil components, the perillaldehyde and carvone analogs, and the synergists having a cyclohexene ring described in this specification also have a synergistic effect with insecticides, such as pyrethrum, pyrethrins, pyrethroids, neonicotinoids, carbamates, organophosphates and organochlorines when used to control agronomonic pests. Agronomic pests include larvae of the order Lepidoptera, such as armyworms, (e.g., beet armyworm (Spodoptera exigua)), cutworms, loopers, (e.g., cabbage looper (Trichoplusia ni)) and heliothines in the family Noctuidae (e.g., fall armyworm (Spodoptera fugiperda J.

Arthropod pests also include spiders in the order Araneae such as the brown recluse spider (Loxosceles reclusa Gertsch & Mulaik) and the black widow spider (Latrodectus mactans Fabricius), and centipedes in the order Scutigeromorpha such as the house centipede (Scutigera coleoptrata Linnaeus). [0071] In some embodiments, the method comprises contacting an insect with an amount of any of the compositions described in this specification effective to control at least about 20%, at least about 30%, at least about 40%, at least about 50%, less than about 100%, less than about 90%, less than about 80%, less than about 70%, or less than about 60% of the contacted adult insect population. In some embodiments, the method comprises contacting an insect with an amount of any of the compositions described here effective to provide about 95% insect mortality. In some embodiments, the compositions provided in this specification comprise an amount (e.g., weight %) of at least one active agent that is suitably in a range that allows for at least some degree of insecticidal efficacy (e.g., more than 0%, but less that 95% insect mortality rate) when the composition is used, while not necessarily meeting the ΕΡΑ requirements for a registered insecticide. For a composition to be registered and marketed as a “pesticide” within the United States for some uses (e.g., public health uses and pest control in residential structures) the ΕΡΑ requires that a composition exhibits a 95% insect mortality at the lowest labeled rate. The ΕΡΑ also regulates the upper limits of active agent(s) that can be used in practice in the environment. [0072] In some embodiments, methods for insect control or controlling insects comprise contacting an insect with an amount of any of the compositions described in this specification. Control or controlling includes killing, knocking down, or a combination thereof, of at least a portion of a population of insects. A population includes at least two insects. Insect knockdown does not necessarily correlate to insect death, as insects can recover after the initial knockdown. In some embodiments, the composition is applied in an amount effective to knockdown at least about 20%, at least about 30%, at least about 40%, at least about 50%, at least about 60%, at least about 70%, at least about 80%, at least about 90%, at least about 95%, or at least about 98% of the contacted insect population. In some embodiments, the composition is applied in an amount effective to kill at least about 20%, at least about 30%, at least about 40%, at least about 50%, at least about 60%, at least about 70%, at least about 80%, at least about 90%, at least about 95%, or at least about 98% of the contacted insect population. [0073] In some embodiments, the methods described here can comprise any known route, apparatus, and/or mechanism for the delivery or application of the compositions and formulations. In some embodiments, compositions may be applied as an aerosol, mist, fog, vapor, or ULV spray. In some embodiments, compositions may be applied as a surface contact treatment. A surface contact treatment includes surfaces that have been contacted with the composition, such as by painting, rolling, coating, dip coating or spraying the surface, or the compositions may be incorporated into fibers or other materials, such as, for example, a bednet to produce a material comprising a surface contact treatment. In some embodiments, the method comprises a sprayer. Traditional pesticide sprayers in the pest control markets are typically operated manually or electrically or are gas-controlled and use maximum pressures ranging from 15 to 500 psi generating flow rates from 5 gpm to 40 gpm. In other embodiments, the methods disclosed here comprise the use of the compositions and/or formulations in combination with any low volume environmental pest control device(s) such as, for example, ultra low volume (ULV) machines. Such combinations are useful in methods for mosquito control as well as other flying insects (e.g., flies, gnats, and flying ants) wherein contacting the insect with a low volume of the composition is possible and/or desirable. ULV machines suitably use low volume of material, for example at rates of about one gallon per hour (or ounces per minute), and typically utilize artificial wind velocities such as from, for example, an air source (e.g., pump or compressor) to break down and distribute the composition/formulation into a cold fog (suitably having average droplet particle sizes of about 1-30 pm). Any standard ground ULV equipment used for insect control such as, for example, a system including a (CETI) Grizzly aerosol generator can be used in the methods described here. A general ULV system includes a tank for the composition (e.g., insecticide), a transport system (e.g., a pump or pressurized tank), a flow control device, and a nozzle that atomizes the composition. Typically, ULV machines do not compress droplets. Rather, they often use a venture siphoning system, and can induce an artificial energizing of the droplets by adding an electrical current to the liquid (e.g., through the use an electrode located at the application tip).

EXAMPLES Example 1: Materials and Methods [0077] Reagents. Pyrethrins were supplied as a 20% Manufacturing Use Product or “MUP” (PyGanic® MUP 20, MGK (Minneapolis, ΜΝ). Mineral oil was supplied by Brenntag Great Lakes, LLC. Diluents were supplied by Stepan Company, Procter & Gamble Chemicals, and Vertec Biosolvents. Insecticides were purchased from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Essential oils or botanicals were purchased from The Good Scents Company, The Lebermuth Company, and Takasago International Corporation. Perilla oil components and insecticides were obtained from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) or City Chemical (West Haven, CT). [0078] Topical Bioassay Method. Adult mosquitoes were reared on 10% sucrose solution in an insectary maintained at 27°C, 45% RH and 12/12 hr light/dark photoperiod. Adult female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes were segregated in 18” χ 18” screen cages based on date of eclosion, therefore the exact age of the mosquitoes were known for bioassays. [0079] Ten female mosquitoes, aged four to six days after eclosion, were aspirated out of their respective cage and into a small glass jar. The mosquitoes were then anesthetized with C02 gas for 30 seconds. After the adults were anesthetized, they were quickly placed on a plastic platform for treatment application. Treatments were serially diluted (using a BrandTech Scientific Transferpette S pipette (100-1000 pL), labeled centrifuge tubes, and a vortex mixer) from stocks of insecticides using reagent grade acetone as the diluent to concentrations as indicated for each treatment solution. A treatment solution may contain additional ingredients as indicated for each study. [0080] Using a Hamilton ΡΒ00-1 Repeating Dispenser with a Hamilton 25 Microliter Syringe, 0.5 pL of each treatment solution was applied to the thorax of each mosquito. Immediately following the application of the treatment, the mosquitoes were gently transferred into a clean paper cup and covered with screen. The mesh screen prevented the mosquitoes from escaping and allowed the specimens to be viewed for ratings. A cotton ball soaked with 10% sucrose solution was inserted into a side hole of each cup for hydration and nourishment. Each treatment variable in the study was replicated three times using separate cups for each replication. [0081] In each study, an untreated control and an acetone treated control was included to ensure that the C02 gas and the acetone diluent had no lethal effect on the mosquitoes. The untreated controls treatments were anesthetized for 30 seconds and gently transferred to the paper cups. The acetone treated control was treated exactly as described above except that the solution applied to each mosquito was undiluted acetone. [0082] The condition of the mosquitoes in each cup was recorded at one hour and 24 hours after initial treatment. The condition classifications used were (1) alive and flying, (2) alive and unable to fly, or (3) dead. The percent mortality for each treatment was calculated by summing the mortalities of each replicate then calculating the percent dead from the total number of mosquitoes. [0083] Statistical Analysis. Where indicated, the mortality data were subjected to probit analysis using the Statistical Analysis System Version 9.1 program PROC PROBIT (SAS Institute (2003) PROC user's manual, version 9.1. SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina). This analysis estimates an LD50 value or the dose necessary to achieve 50% mortality. In all cases the likelihood ratio (L.R.) or Pearson chi-square goodness-of-fit values indicated that the data adequately conformed to the probit model (ibid). [0084] Mosquito stocks for field trials. The Culex and Aedes adult mosquitoes for the field trial were reared from pupae shipped overnight from the Clarke Technical Center Insectary to the Florida Research Laboratory. Mosquitoes were fed a 10% sugar water solution upon emergence and were maintained on 10% sugar water throughout the field trials. For laboratory experiments and assays, the desired number of adult mosquitoes (typically about 3-7 days old) were isolated and maintained on 10% sugar water solution. Example 2 [0085] Perilla leaf oil was tested for efficacy against 3- to 5-day old adult Aedes aegypti. Solutions tested included Perilla oil at 1%, 2%, 4%, 6%, 8%, and 10%. At 1 hour we obtained 0%, 37%, 97%, 93%, 100%, and 100% knockdown, respectively. At 24 hours we obtained 0%, 20%, 83%, 93%, 100%, and 100% mortality, respectively. The C02 control and acetone standard both had 0% knockdown at 1 hour, and 0% mortality at 24 hours. These data suggest that perilla leaf oil exposure by contact leads to Aedes aegypti mortality. Example 3 [0086] Perilla leaf oil at concentrations of 1%, 5%, and 10% was tested for efficacy against 1- to 2-day old adult Culex quinquefasciatus. At 1 hour we obtained 17%, 100%, and 100% knockdown, respectively. At 24 hours we obtained 10%, 100%, and 100% mortality, respectively. The C02 control had 0% knockdown at 1 hour, and 0% mortality at 24 hours. The acetone standard had 17% knockdown at 1 hour, and 20% mean mortality at 24 hours. These data suggest that perilla leaf oil exposure by contact leads to Culex quinquefasciatus mortality. Example 4 [0087] Perilla seed oil at concentrations of 1%, 5%, 10%, and 20% was tested for efficacy against 4- to 6-day old adult Aedes aegypti. At 1 hour we obtained 7%, 77%, 83%, and 87% knockdown, respectively. At 24 hours we obtained 0%, 23%, 30%, and 77% mortality, respectively. The C02 control and acetone standard both had 0% knockdown at 1 hour, and 0% mortality at 24 hours. These data suggest that relatively high rates of perilla seed oil exposure by contact, leads to mosquito mortality. Example 5 [0088] Perilla seed oil at concentrations of 1%, 5%, 10%, and 20% was again tested for efficacy against 4- to 6-day old adult Aedes aegypti. At 1 hour we obtained 0%, 63%, 87%, and 93% knockdown, respectively. At 24 hours we obtained 0%, 20%, 77%, and 90% mortality, respectively. The C02 control had 0% knockdown at 1 hour, and 0% mortality at 24 hours. The acetone standard had 7% knockdown at 1 hour, and 7% mean mortality at 24 hours. These data suggest that relatively high rates of perilla seed oil exposure by contact, leads to mosquito mortality. Example 6 [0089] Linolenic acid at concentrations of 1%, 5%, 10%, and 20% was tested for efficacy against 4- to 6-day old adult Aedes aegypti. At 1 hour we obtained 0%, 27%, 40%, and 93% knockdown, respectively. At 24 hours we obtained 3%, 33%, 83%, and 93% mortality, respectively. The C02 control had 0% knockdown at 1 hour, and 7% mortality at 24 hours. The acetone standard had 0% knockdown at 1 hour, and 0% mortality at 24 hours. These data suggest that relatively high rates of linolenic acid exposure by contact, leads to mosquito mortality. Example 7 [0090] (S)-(-)-Perillaldehyde at concentrations of 1%, 5%, 10%, and 20% was tested for efficacy against 4- to 6-day old adult Aedes aegypti. At 1 hour we obtained 3%, 93%, 100%, and 97% knockdown, respectively. At 24 hours we obtained 7%, 93%, 100%, and 100% mortality, respectively. The C02 control had 0% knockdown at 1 hour, and 7% mortality at 24 hours. The acetone standard had 0% knockdown at 1 hour, and 0% mortality at 24 hours. These data suggest that perillaldehyde exposure by contact leads to mosquito mortality. Example 8 [0091] Farnesene at concentrations of 1%, 5%, 10%, and 20% was tested for efficacy against 4- to 6-day old adult Aedes aegypti. At 1 hour we obtained 0%, 0%, 87%, and 100% knockdown, respectively. At 24 hours we obtained 3%, 13%, 70%, and 100% mortality, respectively. The C02 control had 0% knockdown at 1 hour, and 7% mortality at 24 hours. The acetone standard had 0% knockdown at 1 hour, and 0% mortality at 24 hours. These data suggest that relatively high rates of farnesene exposure by contact leads to mosquito mortality. Example 9 [0092] 3-Caryophyllene at concentrations of 1%, 5%, 10%, and 20% was tested for efficacy against 4- to 6-day old adult Aedes aegypti. At 1 hour we obtained 0%, 10%, 57%, and 93% knockdown, respectively. At 24 hours we obtained 0%, 17%, 40%, and 83% mortality, respectively. The C02 control had 0% knockdown at 1 hour, and 7% mortality at 24 hours. The acetone standard had 0% knockdown at 1 hour, and 0% mortality at 24 hours. These data suggest that 3-caryophyllene exposure by contact, leads to mosquito mortality. Example 10 [0093] Dinotefuran and perilla oil were tested for efficacy against 5- to 7-day old adult Aedes aegypti. Solutions tested included Solution 1 (0.06 pg/mosquito of dinotefuran), Solution 2 (3% perilla oil), and Solution 3 (0.06 pg/mosquito of dinotefuran with 3% perilla oil). At 1 hour we obtained 37%, 83%, and 97% knockdown for Solutions 1, 2, and 3, respectively. At 24 hours we obtained 57%, 73%, and 97% mortality respectively. The C02 control and acetone standard both had 0% knockdown at 1 hour, and 0% mortality at 24 hours. Results are shown in Table 2. Table 2. Efficacy of perilla oil, dinotefuran, and a combination of both against adult, virgin, female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes.

Example 11 [0094] Dinotefuran and perilla oil were tested for efficacy against 4- to 6-day old adult Aedes aegypti. Solutions tested included Solution 1 (2% perilla oil), Solution 2 (0.004 pg/mosquito dinotefuran with 2% perilla oil), Solution 3 (0.006 pg/mosquito dinotefuran with 2% perilla oil), and Solution 4 (0.008 pg/mosquito of dinotefuran with 2% perilla oil). At 1 hour we obtained 13%, 87%, 80%, and 90% knockdown for Solutions 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. At 24 hours we obtained 0%, 77%, 77%, and 90% mortality respectively. The C02 control and acetone standard both had 0% knockdown at 1 hour and 0% mortality at 24 hours. Dinotefuran was tested at discriminating doses 7.5 to 15 times lower that the LD50 of 0.06 pg/mosquito. These data suggest that the application of dinotefuran and perilla oil together leads to an increase in mortality over the application of perilla oil alone. Example 12 [0095] Dinotefuran and perilla oil were tested individually and in combination for efficacy against 3- to 5-day old adult Aedes aegypti where dinotefuran was tested at discriminating doses 7.5 to 15 times lower than the LD50 of 0.06 pg/mosquito.

Example 58: Open field caged mosquito efficacy study [00141] A formulation including 5% pyrethrin, 7% perilla oil, and 67% Mineral oil was tested to determine the potential efficacy against adult female mosquitoes in an open field caged study. Spray cages were placed on 5-foot stakes, 1 cage per stake, and at an angle parallel to the spray line. Stakes were placed at 100, 200 and 300 feet down-wind at a 90 angle from the spray line. Cages were placed in three rows 100 feet apart. See Figure 1. A total of 10 spray cages (9 treated and 1 untreated control) were used in each replicate. 20-25 adult female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes were placed in the cylindrical spray cages. The formulation was applied at an application rate of 0.53 oz/acre to the area. [00142] Two replicate experiments were conducted. For each replicate, Droplet VMDs were 13-15 microns, Drop Densities at all distances were +300/cm2, the air temperature was 79° F, and the winds were consistent from the East at 6-8 mph. After 1 h, 12 h, and 24 h, the knockdown or mortality was calculated as a percent of the total number of mosquitoes for that replicate and distance. Results are shown in Table 217. Table 217. Distance from spray line 1 h 12 h 24 h knockdown knockdown Mortality Replicate 1 100 feet 100% 100% 100% 200 feet 100% 100% 100% 300 feet 100% 100% 100% Replicate 2 100 feet 98% 99% 99.9% 200 feet 100% 100% 99% 300 feet 100% 100% 99.9% [00143] Example 59: Ρ450 Activity Assay [00144] Cytochrome Ρ450 enzyme solution was prepared by homogenizing 15, 3 to 5 day old, A. aegypti females and centrifuging the mixture at 10,000 g for 1 minute. The pellet was discarded, and the supernatant was used as the Ρ450 enzyme stock solution. 10 pL of this Ρ450 enzyme stock and 90 pL of 7- ethoxycoumarin solution (0.526mM of 7-ethoxycoumarin, 1.11mM NADPH, 0.05mM phosphate buffer) was added to each well of the micropipette plate to begin the reaction. During the reaction, the micropipette plate was covered with aluminum foil to prevent photo-bleaching. The reaction was incubated at 30°C for 4 hours. The reaction was stopped by adding 30 pL of stop solution (0.1 mM glycine, pH 10.4, 50% ethanol). The micropipette plate was then analyzed by measuring the fluorescence (Emission = 4δ0ηΜ, Excitation = 360ηΜ) of each well. High fluorescence was directly related to product, and thus Indicated a high level of Ρ450 activity. Conversely, low fluorescence indicated iess product and suggested tow Ρ450 activity (inhibition). [00145] Measurement of cytochrome Ρ450 enzyme (Ρ450) activity with and without inhibitors are shown in Figure 2, The control treatment contained acetone, ΡΒΟ, a known cytochrome ρ450 inhibitor served as a positive control. Both ΡΒΟ and peri!(aldehyde when added to the assay acted as inhibitors. Figure 2 shows that periilaldehyde at 1% is as potent an inhibitor of Ρ450 as ΡΒΟ at 2%. Periilaldehyde at 10% is a more potent inhibitor of Ρ450 than ΡΒΟ at 2%. [00146] Thus, the disclosure provides, among other things, insecticidal compositions.
