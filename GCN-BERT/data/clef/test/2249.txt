Dealing the Game During regular play, the dice are placed in the dice shaker by the Dealer and are shaken in an up and down motion prior to being passed out to the player. Starting with the player furthest to the left, the dice and shaker are passed out to the player to shake the dice at least three times in an up and down motion to ensure a random outcome.

If there is an active Zilch wager and the Shooter rolls Zilch the Dealer places an “On” button in the Zilch circle. Losing Dice Poker wagers are taken, all Zilch wagers are paid and enter the 5 Sixes Bonus Round. When a Shooter qualifies for the 5 Sixes Bonus Round, the Dealer places all 5 dice in the shaker, shakes the dice once in an up and down motion and then passes it to the Shooter to shake. The lid is uncovered and the Dealer removes each six that was rolled and returns the remaining dice and shaker to the Shooter to keep rolling until 5 Sixes is achieved or for 5 rolls, whichever comes first. When a Shooter enters the 5 Sixes Bonus Round, the Dealer places a “Bonus 1” lammer in the 1st Roll area of the layout. When the next combination is rolled the Dealer places the “Bonus 2” lammer on the 2nd Roll area, the “Bonus 3” lammer on the 3rd Roll area and so on until 5 Sixes has been rolled or for 5 rolls, whichever comes first. Completion of a Round of Play Whenever a Pair Only is rolled, all other Dice Poker and Zilch wagers lose. Whenever the Shooter rolls a Dice Poker combination where they have no wager, the dice pass clockwise around the table to the next Shooter, unless Zilch is rolled. Whenever Zilch is rolled, the 5 Sixes Bonus Round is completed and the dice pass clockwise around the table to the next Shooter. A Shooter does not have to have a Zilch wager to roll the dice during the 5 Sixes Bonus Round. A player may elect to forfeit their opportunity to be the Shooter and shake the dice at any time. When this happens, the dice are offered to the next player moving clockwise around the table and the round is completed. If no one elects to shake the dice, the Dealer shakes the dice. Wagers are paid and/or taken in order pursuant with the established Pay Table. Irregularities All irregularities are resolved at the discretion of the Casino Operator.
