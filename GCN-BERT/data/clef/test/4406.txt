Example 7-5 : Preparation of 1-(6-bromo-5-methoxypyridin-2-yl)ethanone (XXXXVIII)
6-Bromo-N,5-dimethoxy-N-methylpicolinamide (XXXXVII) (2.29 g, 8.32 mmol) was dissolved in 30 ml of tetrahydrofuran (THF) and the resulting solution was cooled to -78 °C. To the solution was slowly added methylmagnesium bromide (1.4M) (7.73 ml, 10.82mmol) and the solution was stirred at 0 °C for 1 hr. 60 ml of saturated ammonium chloride solution (Sat.NH4Cl) was added to the solution and the solution was extracted with 60 ml of ethylacetate (EA). The organic layer was treated with magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) and filtered, and the resulting solution was concentrated and purified by silica gel column chromatography (normal hexane : ethylacetate = 3 : 1, v/v) to give the title compound as a white solid (1.88 g, 8.17 mmol, 98 %).
