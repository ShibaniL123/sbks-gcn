STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT This invention was made with Government support under grant number ECCS-0901141, awarded by the U.S. National Science Foundation. The Government has certain rights in this invention. BACKGROUND Recent work on controlling the three-dimensional morphology of nano- and micro-sized objects has included an increasing number of studies on scrolls. The scroll form is attractive because it is a structure with open ends and edges, adjustable interlayer distances, and flexible interior volume that can be used for cargo transport. Some nanostructured heterolayer systems are known to exhibit scrolling behavior, and the major efforts have involved metal and metal oxide (especially semiconductor) multilayers deposited on a sacrificial material layer. Upon etching (removing the sacrificial layer), the released heterostructures spontaneously roll into micrometer-sized scrolls/tubes. However, new materials and new techniques to fabricate such functional nano- and microsized scrolls need to be explored to extend the application and lower the cost. SUMMARY Embodiments of the present disclosure, in one aspect, relate to functionalized nanostructured scrolls and methods of making functionalized nanostructured scrolls. Briefly described, embodiments of the present disclosure include a method of making a functionalized multilayer micron-sized scroll structure comprising depositing an aqueous solution of nanosheets onto a substrate, coating the nanosheet layer with a first layer of a material to form a multilayer structure using vapor deposition, where the first layer comprises a metal containing substance selected from a pure metal, a metal oxide, a metal nitride, a metal oxynitride, a metal carbide, and a combination thereof, adding a solvent, and sonicating the multilayer material so that the multilayer material spontaneously forms a functionalized multilayer micron-sized scroll structure. Embodiments of the present disclosure further include a functionalized multilayer micron-sized scroll structure comprising a first layer, where the first layer comprises a nanosheet where the nanosheet comprises a material selected from graphene oxide (GO), graphene, MoS2, hexagonal boron nitride (BN), and a combination thereof, and a second layer, where the second layer comprises a material selected from Ti, Pt, Fe, Ni, TiO2, Fe2O3, Si, and a combination thereof, where the first layer and the second layer roll spontaneously to form the multilayer micron-sized scroll structure, and where the scroll structure is open at both ends and hollow in the center. Embodiments of the present disclosure include a method of using a functionalized multilayer micron-sized scroll structure selected from surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), batteries, drug loading, drug delivery, hydrogen storage, catalytic reaction, and a combination thereof.

DISCUSSION In accordance with the purpose(s) of the present disclosure, as embodied and broadly described herein, embodiments of the present disclosure, in one aspect, relates to multilayered materials that are designed to roll spontaneously into micron-sized, cylindrical “jelly roll” or scroll structures. In an embodiment, at least one of the layers comprises a nanosheet material, which is defined as being at least a single monolayer thick, preferably no more than 10 nm thick, and at least 100 nm in lateral dimensions. An illustrative example of the present disclosure is shown in FIG. 1. In the initial flat trilayer material, the bottom layer is comprised of graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets, the middle layer is comprised of titanium metal, and the top layer is comprised of platinum metal. When rolled in a scroll-like fashion, the material forms a jelly roll structure that is hollow in the center. The present disclosure includes bilayer, trilayer, and more complex multilayer structures. At least one of these layers is comprised of a nanosheet material; examples include but are not limited to graphene oxide, graphene, MoS2, and hexagonal BN in the nanosheet morphology. The nanosheet layer is about sub-nm to about several nm in thickness. The subsequent layers typically are comprised of various vapor-deposited materials about several nm in thickness; examples include, but are not limited to, metals, such as Ti, Pt, Fe, Ni, etc or nonmetals, such as TiO2, Fe2O3, Si, etc. The thicknesses of each layer can be varied independently. The selection of specific materials for the multilayer scroll structure of the present disclosure is important for at least two reasons. The first reason is that the material properties lead to the creation of interfacial strain and differences in surface energy that promote spontaneous rolling. Another reason is that each material can have a functional contribution as well as a structural contribution. For example, in a graphene oxide/Ti/Pt system, the Pt can act as a catalyst for the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide, which produces bubbles of oxygen gas that can propel the jelly roll forward. Likewise, in a graphene/Ti/Pt system the electrical conductivity function of the graphene layer can be taken advantage of. After fabrication of the multilayer material on a substrate (e.g., Si wafer), multimicron-sized areas are released in solvents (e.g., water, water based solution, organic solvents) from the substrate by the use of sonication. The solvents with different surface tensions can be used to precisely control the diameter and the quality of the rolls (e.g., cylinders, scrolls). These multilayer materials spontaneously roll up into the scroll structure shown in FIG. 1. Embodiments of the present disclosure include a functionalized multilayer micron-sized scroll structure comprising a first layer, where the first layer comprises a nanosheet where the nanosheet comprises a material selected from graphene oxide (GO), graphene, MoS2, hexagonal boron nitride (BN), and a combination thereof, and a second layer, where the second layer comprises a material selected from Ti, Pt, Fe, Ni, TiO2, Fe2O3, Si, and a combination thereof, where the first layer and the second layer roll spontaneously to form the multilayer micron-sized scroll structure, and where the scroll structure is open at both ends and hollow in the center. Embodiments of the present disclosure include a functionalized multilayer micron-sized scroll structure further comprising a third layer, where the third layer comprises a material selected from the Ti, Pt, Fe, Ni, TiO2, Fe2O3, Si, and a combination thereof. In an embodiment, the first layer comprises a graphene oxide (GO) nanosheet, the second layer comprises titanium (Ti), and the third layer comprises platinum (Pt), and the Pt layer comprises the innermost layer located within the interior of the scroll structure, and the GO layer comprises the outermost layer of the scroll structure. In another embodiment, the nanosheet is at least a single monolayer thick, and wherein the nanosheet layer is about 0.5 to 3.0 nm in thickness. In an embodiment, the nanosheet layer is about sub-nm to about several nm in thickness. Prior to spontaneously rolling, the GO nanosheet, Ti layer, and Pt layer form a three-layer sandwich-like structure. Embodiments of the present disclosure include a functionalized multilayer micron-sized scroll structure further comprising at least one additional layer, where the second layer, the third layer, and the at least one additional layer are each at least about 1 nm thick. In another embodiment, the thickness is between about 10 nm to 50 nm, though, depending on the material, it can be greater than about 50 nm. Embodiments of the present disclosure include a functionalized multilayer micron-sized scroll structure where the structure acts as a microjet engine in the presence of H2O2 due to a reaction between the Pt layer and the H2O2 to form O2. In an embodiment, the structure moves at a constant speed of about 85 to 975 μm s−1. Embodiments of the present disclosure include a functionalized multilayer micron-sized cylindrical structure where the structure is about 0.5 to 5 microns in diameter and about 3 to 40 microns in length. However, these values also depend on what material is used to form the scrolls. Embodiments of the present disclosure include a method of making a functionalized multilayer micron-sized scroll structure comprising depositing an aqueous solution of nanosheets onto a substrate (e.g., silicon), coating the nanosheet layer with a first layer of a material to form a multilayer structure using vapor deposition, where the first layer comprises a metal containing substance selected from a pure metal, a metal oxide, a metal nitride, a metal oxynitride, a metal carbide, and a combination thereof, adding a solvent, and sonicating the multilayer material so that the multilayer material spontaneously forms a functionalized multilayer micron-sized scroll structure. In an embodiment, the nanosheet comprises a material selected from graphene oxide (GO), graphene, MoS2, hexagonal boron nitride (BN), and a combination thereof. In another embodiment, the nanosheet comprises GO and the first layer comprises Si. In another embodiment, the first layer comprises a material selected from Ti, Pt, Fe, Ni, TiO2, Fe2O3, Si, and a combination thereof. In an embodiment, the metal can include, but is not limited to, silver, nickel, aluminum, silicon, gold, platinum, palladium, titanium, copper, cobalt, zinc, other transition metals, composites thereof, oxides thereof, nitrides thereof, silicides thereof, phosphides (P3−) thereof, oxynitrides thereof, carbides thereof, and combinations thereof. Embodiments of the present disclosure include a method where the multilayer material spontaneously forms a scroll structure by a detachment mechanism comprising a physical delamination process. Embodiments of the present disclosure include a method further comprising depositing a second layer of material on the first layer of material prior to adding the solvent. In an embodiment, the second layer is comprised of a material selected from Ti, Pt, Fe, Ni, TiO2, Fe2O3, Si, and a combination thereof. In another embodiment, the nanosheet comprises GO, the first layer comprises Ti, and the second layer comprises Pt. In another embodiment, the first layer is about 10 nm thick, and the second layer is about 10 to 25 nm thick. Embodiments of the present disclosure include a method where the multilayer material is sonicated for less than about one minute in 18 MΩ aqueous solution. Embodiments of the present disclosure include a method further comprising depositing at least one additional layer on the second layer prior to adding the solvent. In an embodiment, the method further comprises immersing the functionalized multilayer micron-sized scroll structure in H2O2 to form microjet multilayer micron-sized scroll structures. Embodiments of the present disclosure include a multilayer material where the material exhibits qualities selected from electrical conductivity, strength, flexibility, hydrophobicity, and a combination thereof. In an embodiment, the material is used in catalytic jet engines. Embodiments of the present disclosure include a multilayer material where the second layer comprises Au, and the “jelly roll” is used for surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). In an embodiment, the second layer comprises Si, and the “jelly roll” is used for batteries. EXAMPLES Example 1 Example 1A Graphene Oxide/Si The same strategy shown in Example 1A was followed, but only deposit a 20 nm layer of Si onto the graphene oxide nanosheets. After sonication in water, the two-layer structures also form jelly rolls as shown in FIG. 4. Previous studies have established that nanosheet materials can roll up spontaneously into nanotube or nanoscroll structures (e.g., graphene, titania, kaolinite, hexaniobate). Other studies have established that certain multilayer materials can roll up spontaneously into micron-sized tube or scroll structures (e.g., V2O5, Pt/Au/Fe/Ti, InGaAs/GaAs/Cr/Pt). In addition, manually-rolled multilayer systems have been reported. The nanosheet component of the present disclosure affords several advantages. Because many nanosheet materials can be manipulated as colloidal dispersions, they are easy to deposit via solution-based approaches. In addition, they are convenient starting materials for ultrathin (<about 5 nm), continuous layers down to a single atomic layer. Furthermore, several nanosheet materials have remarkable material properties and/or chemical functionalities that can be incorporated into the jelly roll system (e.g., electrical conductivity, strength, flexibility, hydrophobicity). Last, the deposition of different materials on top of the nanosheets make the sheet structure heterogenous, with different chemical and physical properties on two sides of the surfaces. This allows a great leverage to engineer the sheet materials for different applications. Applications An advantage of the jelly roll/scroll morphology is that the ends of the structure are open, in contrast to closed-tube structures. This feature makes it possible to put additional components inside, or to move components from the inside to the outside or vice versa. Many potential applications could utilize these features, such as gas storage and drug loading/delivery systems. In addition, there is growing interest in nano- and micro-level propulsion (that requires the release of gases), which has been demonstrated with the jelly roll structures in this disclosure. With alternative metal layers, such as gold or silver, the jelly roll structures of the present disclosure may be used for surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). In addition, with alternative nonmetal layers, such as Si, the multilayer structure of the jelly rolls also suggests that they have potential for micron-sized, nano-structured batteries and supercapacitors. Further applications may include water or ion channels and sensor applications and advanced photocatalytic materials for solar energy based applications (solar cells, water splitting, CO2 conversion). Example 1B Graphene Oxide/Titanium/Platinum First an aqueous solution of graphene oxide nanosheets was deposited onto a silicon substrate and then coated with thin layers of Ti and Pt (about 10 nm each) using an electron-beam evaporation system. FIGS. 2A and 2B show SEM images of the graphene oxide nanosheets before and after Ti/Pt coating. Although it is difficult to observe the graphene oxide because of poor image contrast, the folds clearly show the existence of large nanosheets. Notably, there are no rolled structures visible in the uncoated graphene oxide samples, and sonication (about 15 s to 2 min in a bath sonicator) did not produce any rolled structures. After sonication of the coated Si wafer in 18 MΩ water (about 15 s in a bath sonicator), the resulting aqueous dispersion contained micron-sized jelly rolls. The dispersion was deposited onto a clean Si substrate for SEM observation or onto a TEM grid for TEM observation. As seen in FIGS. 2C to 2F, the jelly rolls or scrolls are about 3 microns in diameter and about tens of microns in length (about 80% between about 10-15 μm). Not to be bound by any particular theory, however, it is believed the primary role of sonication is to separate the multilayer material from the Si substrate, at which point it rolls up spontaneously. In this particular system, the Ti layer is used to enhance the adhesion between Pt and graphene oxide. Furthermore, graphene oxide/Ti/Pt jelly rolls can behave as jet engines upon introduction of about 10% aqueous hydrogen peroxide. As illustrated in FIG. 3, which contains excerpts from an optical microscopy video, the Pt-catalyzed decomposition of hydrogen peroxide creates oxygen gas microbubbles that exit from one end of the jelly roll. The expulsion of gas causes the jelly roll to move directionally rather than via Brownian motion. This behavior has been observed for tens of nanoscrolls and found that the bubbles are produced consistently at the end of the nanoscrolls, which strongly suggests that the Pt is located within the jelly roll.

Example 1C Layered heterostructures containing graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets and about 20-35 nm bi-metal coatings can detach easily from a Si substrate upon sonication—spontaneously forming freestanding, micron-sized scrolls with GO on the outside—due to a combination of material stresses and weak bonding between GO layers. Simple procedures can tune the scroll diameters by varying the thicknesses of the metal films, and these results are confirmed by both experiment and modeling. The selection of materials determines the stresses that control the rolling behavior, as well as the functionality of the structures. In the GO/Ti/Pt system of the present disclosure, the Pt is located within the interior of the scrolls, which can become self-propelled microjet engines through O2 bubbling when suspended in aqueous H2O2. Recent work on controlling the three-dimensional morphology of nano- and micro-sized objects has included an increasing number of studies on scrolls. The scroll form is attractive because it is a structure with open ends and edges, adjustable interlayer distances and flexible interior volume that can be used for cargo transport. A variety of nanosheet materials can roll spontaneously into scroll structures; examples include graphene,1,2 vanadium oxide,3 potassium niobate,4,5 titania,6 lead oxide,7 nickel,8 and kaolinite.9 In particular, carbon-based nanoscrolls, which are expected to have future applications as actuators, hydrogen storage materials, and drug delivery platforms,10-12 have been produced by methods ranging from chemical intercalation in graphite,1,2 microexplosion,13 microwave spark assistance,14 and surface strain engineering.15 In addition, several nanostructured heterolayer systems are known to exhibit scrolling behavior. Major efforts have involved metal and metal oxide (especially semiconductor) multilayers deposited on a sacrificial material layer.16-18 Upon etching (removing the sacrificial layer), the released heterostructures spontaneously roll into micron-sized scrolls/tubes, which can be described evocatively as “jelly rolls”.19 For example, InAs/GaAs nanotubes and nanohelices,20 InxGa1-xAs/GaAs rectangular membranes and scrolls,21,22 and multilayer Pt/Au/Fe/Ti microtubes23 have been produced using this approach. The present disclosure describes multilayered heterostructures that contain graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets and exhibit spontaneous rolling behavior. The functions of the GO are to act as a support for the metallic multilayer and to provide an easily cleavable interface between the substrate and the vapor deposited metal layers, which allows the heterostructures to detach from the surface and roll into freestanding scrolls. This design strategy has not been applied to self-rolling nanostructured scrolls, despite the advantages: the fact that it extends the range of material components in such structures, and it is experimentally convenient (because it eliminates the need for an etching step, uses an aqueous dispersion of GO, and does not require epitaxially-grown or lithographically-defined starting materials). An embodiment of the present disclosure includes GO, titanium, and platinum (GO/Ti/Pt). To fabricate this multilayed structure, an aqueous dispersion of GO nanosheets was drop-cast on a silicon wafer, and then electron-beam evaporation was used to coat the GO with titanium (about 10 nm) followed by platinum (about 10 nm). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images before and after coating (FIGS. 5A-5B) show that there are no scrolled structures at these points, only wrinkles originating in the GO layer. Upon sonication of the GO/Ti/Pt-coated wafer in water, the multilayer film fragments into multi-micron-sized pieces that detach from the surface and spontaneously roll into full or partial scrolls (FIGS. 5B-C and FIGS. 9A-9D). A size distribution analysis of more than 100 scrolls reveals that their diameters are typically about 1-2 μm (average diameter: 1.4±0.4 μm) and their lengths are about 10-20 μm (average length: 15±7 μm) (FIGS. 10A-10B). Furthermore, the diameters of the scrolls have been tuned by varying the thickness of the platinum layer from about 10 to 25 nm (FIGS. 11A-11B and FIGS. 12A-12F). For example, FIG. 5E shows an SEM image of a typical scroll containing about 10 nm Ti and about 25 nm Pt. The average diameters of such scrolls are larger than that of scrolls with about 10 nm Pt. In fact, the average scroll diameter (D) as a function of Pt thickness (t) plotted in FIG. 6A shows a monotonic increase of D with t. No obvious dependence of average scroll length (L) on t was observed (FIG. 13). This is expected because the size distribution and shape of GO nanosheets in all experiments are statistically the same, and these parameters should determine the length of the scrolls.24 Thus, the calculated scroll aspect ratio (L/D) versus t shows a decreasing trend (FIG. 6B). GO bilayers in the scrolls relate to the interaction between GO and the metal coatings. In fact, further characterizations using X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and Raman spectroscopy all indicate that the nature of the GO changes after metal deposition. For example, FIG. 7 shows the changing XRD patterns collected along the fabrication process, from (1) graphite starting material to (2) as-prepared GO nanosheets to (3) GO/Ti/Pt multilayers (not yet scrolled). The XRD pattern of the GO nanosheets exhibits a characteristic (002) peak at 12.5° (GO curve), which can be correlated to an interlayer spacing of about 0.807 nm. For comparison, the original graphite flakes exhibit a sharp peak at 31° (graphite flakes curve), corresponding to an interlayer spacing of about 0.335 nm. This change in basal plane d-spacing is typical for graphite vs. GO.31 However, after metal deposition, the (002) peak of GO clearly shifts to 15°, consistent with GO reduction. In this sample, the Pt (111) peak at 46° (GO/Ti/Pt curve) also is visible. To corroborate GO reduction, GO nanosheets on Si were heated to about 120° C. for about 24 hours. This annealing process resulted in a diffraction pattern typically exhibited by partially reduced GO, characterized by broad peaks shifted to higher angles of 2θ, 17.5° and 26° (annealed GO curve in FIG. 7).32 Additional data from XPS and Raman spectroscopy further support a GO reduction mechanism. To summarize, XPS shows a shift in relative intensity from C═O to C—C bonding after metal deposition (FIG. 17), consistent with the observation by Ajayan and co-workers,33 and Raman spectroscopy indicates enhanced localized sp3 defects, which is characteristic of reduction (FIG. 18). It is concluded that metal deposition has a mild reducing effect on the GO nanosheets, causing the loss of predominantly carbonyl-containing functional groups and dissociation of water molecules.32 Thus, the GO in GO/Ti/Pt appears to be intermediate in chemical and crystallographic character between as-prepared GO and fully reduced GO. Such a reduction effect should have two consequences: first, it suggests that the Ti layer interacts strongly with the adjacent GO, which leads to strong adhesion between the Ti and contacted GO monolayer; second, the reduction is a local effect confined to only the Ti-GO interface and immediately adjacent GO layers. Thus, the Ti acts as “glue” to attach approximately two GO monolayers and the Pt layer tightly within this layered structure. In the GO/Ti/Pt structure, each material layer contributes to the overall scrolling behavior. The highly anisotropic dimensions of GO nanosheets (nm×microns×microns) cause them to assemble in parallel stacked arrangements within concentrated dispersions or dried forms.34 The titanium layer enhances the adhesion between GO and Pt, and it induces GO reduction within approximately the first two contacted monolayers. These effects make the bilayer GO/Ti/Pt a tightly-bonded three component system. The residue stresses from the Ti and Pt layers cause this heterostructure to curl due to the relatively weak van der Waals interactions between GO nanosheet layers, which then allows the facile separation of the heterostructure from the substrate and further curling into scrolls. We emphasize that the detachment mechanism in this system is a physical delamination process, where the cleavage plane is within the top few nanometers of a much thicker GO film. Through this process, approximately two monolayers of partially reduced GO are incorporated on the outer surface of the scroll while excess GO remains on the substrate. The additional residue stress introduced by the Pt layer can tune the scroll diameter, and this material also can provide catalytic activity. A stress model predicts that the Pt layer is wrapped inside the scroll, and thus such a structure can act as a “microjet engine” in the presence of H2O2, which reacts with the platinum catalyst to create O2.23,35,36 Gas bubbles of O2 generated by the reaction typically exit from one end of the scroll and drive it to move directionally in the liquid. FIG. 8A shows representative movie frames extracted from a video (50× magnification objective lens). An analysis of the trajectory of this scroll in the horizontal plane reveals circular/spiral type motion (FIG. 8B). By examining the total traveling distance S ( ≡ ∑ i = 2 n ⁢ ( x i - x i - 1 ) 2 + ( y i - y i - 1 ) 2 ) versus time, as shown in FIG. 8C, it is further shown that the scroll moves at a nearly constant speed (v) of about 138 μm s−1, which is about twelve body-lengths s−1. This speed is comparable to flagellated bacteria, which are some of the fastest organisms on Earth.37 In fact, even greater speeds (up to 200 to 350 body-lengths s−1) have been reported for scroll microjets in previous studies.37,38 The motions of tens of scrolls have been examined and it was found that all exhibit similar circular/spiral motion. However, speed and direction depend on many factors, such as the frequency and maximum size of the bubbles generated, the exact location of the bubbles with respect to the central axis of the scroll, and whether the bubbles leave the scroll (eject) or burst without ejecting. Although the bubbles usually were ejected from one end of a scroll, we observed bubbles emerging from both ends in a few cases. It is likely that bubbles often appear at only one end because of the asymmetric, slightly conical geometry of most scrolls (see FIG. 5 and FIG. 19); when the diameter of one end of the scroll is slightly larger than the other, the bubbles emerge from the end with the larger diameter. Other parameters, such as the shape of the scroll end and spontaneous fluctuation (symmetry broken due to noise), also could induce such a phenomenon. Nevertheless, bubbles were generated consistently from the ends, confirming that the platinum layer is located inside the scrolls. It is believed that both the circular/spiral motion and the differences in bubble production are caused by small inhomogeneities in the layers and variations in the nature of the scrolling. In summary, the present disclosure includes a facile method to fabricate multilayered, freestanding nanostructured scrolls, in which each material has been tailored to make both structural and functional contributions. In particular, the GO layer makes a maximum contribution with a minimal thickness that is consistent with miniaturization efforts. Experimental Section Deposition of the Multilayered Heterostructure and Rolling-Up: An aqueous dispersion of GO nanosheets was drop-cast onto clean 1×1 cm2 silicon substrates. These substrates were placed on a hot plate and dried in air at about 100° C. for about ten minutes, and then loaded into the evaporation system (Torr International, New Windsor, N.Y.) for electron-beam evaporation in a vacuum environment (10−6 Torr) at a vapor incidence angle of 0°. Both Ti and Pt were deposited at a rate of about 0.2 Å s−1, read by a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) facing directly toward the incident vapor. Next, the substrates coated with multilayer film were immersed in an 18 MΩ aqueous solution, and fragmented into multi-micron-sized pieces and spontaneously scrolled into scrolls during a sonication (less than about 1 minute). Jet Engine Activity: about 5 μL of an aqueous dispersion containing the scrolls were pipetted onto a clean Si substrate, followed by the introduction of about 5 μL of 10% H2O2 to activate the motion. After a steady reaction rate was reached and observed (about one minute), pictures and videos of jet engine motion were captured by a Mitituya FS110 optical microscope with an Imperx charge-coupled device (CCD) camera (Phantom v9.1) mounted onto the trinocular head, using 10× and 50× magnification objective lens.
