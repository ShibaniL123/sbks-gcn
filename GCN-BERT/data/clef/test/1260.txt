I. BACKGROUND Touch screens are an increasingly common feature on personal computing devices, such as smart phones and tablet computers, where size and user interface advantages accrue from consolidating multiple hardware components (for example keyboard, number pad, and the like) into a single interactive graphic user interface displayed on the touch screen. Conventional touch screens detect the presence and location of a touch within the display area. Generally, a touch includes touching the touch display screen with a finger, hand, or other touching member. Oily residues, or smudges on the touch screen surface may be one side effect of touches which are not only unsightly and can interfere with the performance of the touch screen, but from which frequently used patterns such as a graphical password maybe inferred. In the vast majority of settings, partial or complete patterns can be easily retrieved. There would be advantages in providing a display surface cleaning system made a part of, integral with, or which can be proximate to, the display surface of a computing device which would allow the user to readily clean the display surface directly, or indirectly by cleaning the touching member used to touch the display surface. II. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Accordingly, a broad object of the invention can be to provide a display surface cleaning system which includes a display surface cleaner which can be utilized discrete from, coupled proximate to, or is integral with the interactive display surface or the encasement of a device which includes an interactive display surface. Another broad object of the invention can be to provide a method of cleaning a user interactive display surface to remove contaminants directly from the interactive display surface or indirectly by cleaning the touch member used to touch the display surface to avoid transfer of contaminants from the touch member to the user interactive display surface. Naturally, further objects of the invention are disclosed throughout other areas of the specification, drawings, photographs, and claims. III.

Particular embodiments can further include a cover (6) which can interengage the top edge (12) allowing the container (5) to operate between a container open condition (13) (as shown in the examples of FIGS. 2A, 2B, 2C, 8 and 9) and a container closed condition (14) (as shown in the examples of 2A, 2B, 2C, 8 and 9) in broken line). As shown in the examples of FIGS. 2A, 2B, 8 and 9, particular embodiments of the container (5) can include a bottom panel (10) connected to four interconnected upright side panels (11) which terminate in a top edge (12) which interengages a rectangular cover (6) to enclose a substantially rectangular inside space (9); however, embodiments of the invention can, but need not be, limited to a square or rectangular container (5) and particular embodiments can include a container (5) having a triangular, pentagonal or other polygonal form or other forms which may include side panels (11) which are curved or circular or designed in the appearance of a person or thing (animal, plant, structure, or the like) depending on the application. As shown in the illustrative example of FIGS. 2A, 8 and 9, a hinge element (15) pivotally couples one cover edge (16) to a corresponding top edge (12) of an upright side panel (11) to allow the cover (6) to rotate between the container open condition (13) and the container closed condition (14). The hinge element (15) as to particular embodiments can be a living hinge made from the same material as the two rigid pieces it connects in which the material is sufficiently thinned or cut to allow the rigid pieces to bend along the line of the hinge element (15). Other embodiments of the hinge element (15) can include a hinge of another flexible material such as: leather, plastic, metal, carbon fiber or similar flexible materials and combinations thereof. As shown in the illustrative example of FIG. 2B, the cover (6) slidingly interengages the top edge (12) of the upright side panels (11) to slide between the container open condition (13) and the container closed condition (14). As to particular embodiments, a pair of cover edges (17) can each include a pair of cover grooves (31) which slidely engage the top edge (12) of a pair of upright side panels (11). As shown in the illustrative example of FIG. 2C, the container (5) can include a bottom panel (10) connected to three or more upright side panels (11) which are not otherwise interconnected but define an inside space (9) configured to receive the display surface cleaning medium (7). As to particular embodiments of the above examples, the cover (6) may be absent or configured as discrete element which removably interengages the top edge (12) of the upright side panels (11), or includes a hinge element (15). Now referring primarily to FIGS. 2A, 2B, and 9, as to particular embodiments, the container (5) and the cover (6) can interengage to sufficiently sealably enclose the inside space (9) to prevent or sufficiently reduce evaporation of the cleanser (8) from the display surface cleaning medium (7) to allow use of the display surface cleaning medium (7) containing a cleanser (8) over a useful period of time depending upon the application, configuration of the display surface cleaning medium (7), and the formulation of the cleanser (8). Particular embodiments of the invention can further include a cover seal (18), which can be discrete from or unitary with the container (5) or the cover (6) and configured to be interengaged by the container (5) and the cover (6) in the container closed condition (14) to sealably enclose the inside space (9). The above illustrative examples of the container (5) and the interengagement of the container (5) with the cover (6) are intended to allow a person of ordinary skill in the art to make and use a numerous and wide variety of embodiments of the container (5) or container (5) and cover (6) to receive the display surface cleaning medium (7), whether or not containing a cleanser (8). Understandably, the cover (6) can take any form that can interengage with the container (5) to provide the open condition (13) during periods of use and the closed condition (14) between periods of use. Again referring generally to the Figures, the display surface cleaning medium (7) can be of any material compatible with the display surface (3) of a device (4). As to particular embodiments, the display surface cleaning medium (7) can comprise one layer (19) (as shown in the examples of FIGS. 2A and 2B) or a plurality of layers (20) (as shown in the examples of FIGS. 4D, 4E, 8 and 9). As to particular embodiments, the plurality of layers (20) can take the form of a stack of discrete or interleaved sheets (as shown in the examples of FIGS. 4D, 8 and 9). The display surface cleaning medium (7) can be configured to be received or removably received within the inside space (9) of the container (5). Again referring to the Figures in general, as to particular embodiments, the display surface cleaning medium (7) can contain a cleanser (8). Accordingly, the display surface cleaning medium (7) can be made from a material both compatible with the display surface (3) of a device (4) and further having retentive forces in relation to a particular cleanser (8) which predominate over hydrostatic forces between uses of the display surface cleaning assembly (2) and which further allows transfer of a portion of the cleanser (8) from the display surface cleaning medium (7) to the display surface (3) of the device (4) during use of the display surface cleaning assembly (2), as further described below.

As to particular embodiments, the display surface cleaning medium (7) can further include a display cleaning medium overwrap (45) which encloses the display surface cleaning medium (7). The method can further include separating the cleaning medium overwrap (45) along a separation line (50) to provide an over wrap aperture (49) which allows passage of one or more of said plurality of cleaning medium sheets (48) from said cleaning medium overwrap (45). The method can further include releasing the container (5) from a container securement structure (47) of the encasement (23). As to particular embodiments, releasing the container (5) further includes releasing the container (5) from a container securement structure (47) in the form of an encasement recess (33) configured to releasably receive the container (5). Releasing the container can further include disengaging one or more detents (46) which project outwardly from one more encasement recess panels (11) from a corresponding one or more detent receiving elements (52) disposed in one or more container side panels ( ). The method can further include passing an appendage (38) through a pass through opening (44) to engage the container bottom panel (10), and by forcibly urging the appendage (38) against the container bottom panel (19), releasing the container (5) from said container securement structure (47) of the encasement (23). The method can further include operating a container cover (6) between a container closed condition (14) and a container open condition (13) which allows access to the display surface cleaning medium (7), removing the display cleaning medium (7) from said container (5), and cleaning said display screen (3) the device (3) by engaging said display cleaning medium (7) with the display screen (3) of the device (3). The method further includes sealably engaging the container cover (6) and the container (5) with a container seal (18) in the container closed condition (14). The method can further include releasably securing a mobile device (4) to the encasement. As can be easily understood from the foregoing, the basic concepts of the present invention may be embodied in a variety of ways. The invention involves numerous and varied embodiments of a mountable carrier and methods for making and using such mountable carrier including the best mode. As such, the particular embodiments or elements of the invention disclosed by the description or shown in the figures or tables accompanying this application are not intended to be limiting, but rather exemplary of the numerous and varied embodiments generically encompassed by the invention or equivalents encompassed with respect to any particular element thereof. In addition, the specific description of a single embodiment or element of the invention may not explicitly describe all embodiments or elements possible; many alternatives are implicitly disclosed by the description and figures. It should be understood that each element of an apparatus or each step of a method may be described by an apparatus term or method term. Such terms can be substituted where desired to make explicit the implicitly broad coverage to which this invention is entitled. As but one example, it should be understood that all steps of a method may be disclosed as an action, a means for taking that action, or as an element which causes that action. Similarly, each element of an apparatus may be disclosed as the physical element or the action which that physical element facilitates. As but one example, the disclosure of a “cleanser” should be understood to encompass disclosure of the act of “cleaning”—whether explicitly discussed or not—and, conversely, were there effectively disclosure of the act of “cleaning”, such a disclosure should be understood to encompass disclosure of a “cleanser” and even a “means for cleaning.” Such alternative terms for each element or step are to be understood to be explicitly included in the description. In addition, as to each term used it should be understood that unless its utilization in this application is inconsistent with such interpretation, common dictionary definitions should be understood to be included in the description for each term as contained in the Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary, second edition, each definition hereby incorporated by reference. All numeric values herein are assumed to be modified by the term “about”, whether or not explicitly indicated. For the purposes of the present invention, ranges may be expressed as from “about” one particular value to “about” another particular value. When such a range is expressed, another embodiment includes from the one particular value to the other particular value. The recitation of numerical ranges by endpoints includes all the numeric values subsumed within that range. A numerical range of one to five includes for example the numeric values 1, 1.5, 2, 2.75, 3, 3.80, 4, 5, and so forth. It will be further understood that the endpoints of each of the ranges are significant both in relation to the other endpoint, and independently of the other endpoint. When a value is expressed as an approximation by use of the antecedent “about,” it will be understood that the particular value forms another embodiment. The term “about” generally refers to a range of numeric values that one of skill in the art would consider equivalent to the recited numeric value or having the same function or result. Similarly, the antecedent “substantially” means largely, but not wholly, the same form, manner or degree and the particular element will have a range of configurations as a person of ordinary skill in the art would consider as having the same function or result. When a particular element is expressed as an approximation by use of the antecedent “substantially,” it will be understood that the particular element forms another embodiment. Moreover, for the purposes of the present invention, the term “a” or “an” entity refers to one or more of that entity unless otherwise limited. As such, the terms “a” or “an”, “one or more” and “at least one” can be used interchangeably herein.
