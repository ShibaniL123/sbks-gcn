Le A 32 322-Poreign Countries Du/myW6/V26.01.1998 Fungicidal active compound combinations The present invention relates to novel active compound combinations which consist of the known 2-[2-(l-chlorocyclopropyl)-3-(2-chlorophenyl)-2-hydroxypropyl]-2,4-dihydro-[l,2,4]-triazole-3-thione and further known fungicidally active compounds, and which are highly suitable for controlling phytopathogenic fungi. It is already known that 2-[2-(l-chlorocyclopropyl)-3-(2-chlorophenyl)-2-hydroxypropyl]-2,4-dihydro-[l,2,4]-triazole-3-thione has fungicidal properties (cf. WO 96-16 048). The activity of this compound is good; however, at low application rates it is in some cases not satisfactory. Furthermore, it is already known that a large number of triazole derivatives, aniline derivatives, dicarboximides and other heterocycles can be employed for controlling fungi (cf. ΕΡ-Α 0 040 345, DE-A 2 201 063, DE-A 2 324 0 10, Pesticide Manual, 9th Edition (1991), pages 249 and 827, US-A 3 903 090 and ΕΡ-Α 0 206 999). Likewise, the activity of these compounds is not always satisfactory at low application rates. Finally, it is also known that l-[(6-chloro-3-pyridinyl)-methyl]-N-nitro-2-imidazolidineimine can be used for controlling animal pests such as insects (cf. Pesticide Manual, 9th Edition (1991), page 491). However, fungicidal properties have not hitherto been described for this compound. It has now been found that the novel active compound combinations comprising 2-[2-(l-chlorocyclopropyl)-3-(2-chlorophenyl)-2-hydroxypropyl]-2,4-dihydro-[ 1,2,4]triazole-3-thione of the formula ri _>Z j ^z-iOiCi^a '..uuiui ii.> (1) a triazole derivative of the formula X represents chlorine or phenyl and -c- -CH- II Υ represents 0 or ΟΗ and/or (2) the triazole derivative of the formula OH Cl--ch2- -CH2-C C(CH3)3 CH, (III) ΐ ^ U Ν (tebuconazole) and/or (3) an aniline derivative of the formula R1ft \ S CCI2F (IV) S02-N(CH3) 3/2 in which R1 represents hydrogen or methyl, and/or (4) N-[l-(4-chIoro-phenyl)-ethyl]-2,2-dichloro-l-ethyl-3-methyl-cyclopropane-carboxamide of the formula and/or (5) the zinc propylene-l,2-bis-(dithiocarbamate) of the formula CH, -Zn- S-C-ΝΗ-CHr-CH- ΝΗ - C-S- η > = 1 (propineb) and/or (6) at least one thiocarbamate of the formula Me = Zn or Μη or a mixture of Zn and Μη and/or (8) the compound of the formula (VI) O CH(CH3) 3'2 (CH3)2CH-o-c-NH-CH-C ΝΗ-CH -mm-ruJy vy -CH, (IX) O CH, and/or (9) the benzothiadiazole derivative of the formula and/or (X) (bendicar) (10) the 8-t-butyl-2-(N-ethyl-N-n-propyl-amino)-methyl-1,4-dioxaspiro[5,4]-decane of the formula (11) the compound of the formula (XI) (12) the compound of the formula (kresoxim-methyl) and/or (13) the compound of the formula (XIV) and/or (14) the dicarboximide of the formula (15) a pyrimidine derivative of the formula (XVI) in which R2 represents methyl or cyclopropyl, and/or (16) the phenyl derivative of the formula and/or (17) the morpholine derivative of the formula and/or (XIX) (19) the phosphorus compound of the formula H,C,0 , O 5 2 \ // Ρ / \ Η O Al (XX) (fosetyl-AI) and/or (20) a phenylpyrrole derivative of the formula (XXI) R3 and R4 each represent chlorine or together represent a radical of the formula -O-CF2-O-, and/or (21) the l-[(6-chloro-3-pyridinyl)-methyl]-N-nitro-2-imidazolidineimine of the formula (XXII) (imidacloprid) and/or (22) the phenylurea derivative of the formula and/or (23) the benzamide derivative of the formula (XXIV) and/or (24) a guanidine derivative of the formula R-NH-(CH2) 2'8 R N-(CH2)8-R -N -Η (XXV) m χ (2 + m) CH3COOH in which m represents integers from 0 to 5 and R5 represents hydrogen (17 to 23 %) or the radical of the formula C=NH NH2 (77 to 83 %) have very good fungicidal properties. Surprisingly, the fungicidal activity of the active compound combinations according to the invention is considerably higher than the sum of the activities of the individual active compounds. Thus, an unforeseeable, true synergistic effect is present, and not just an addition of activities. The 2-[2-(l-chlorocyclopropyl)-3-(2-chlorophenyl)-2-hydroxypropyl]-2,4-dihydro[l,2,4]-triazole-3-thione of the formula (I) is known (cf. WO 96-16 048). The compound can be present in the „thiono„ form of the formula or in the tautomeric „mercapto„ form of the formula (la). For simplicity’s sake, only the „thiono„ form is given in each case. The formula (II) includes the compounds l-(4_chloro-phenoxy)-3,3-dimethyl-1-( 1,2,4-triazol-l-yl)-butane-2-one of the formula 1 -(4-chloro-phenoxy)-3,3 ^dimethyl-1 -(1,2,4-triazol-1 -yl)-butan-2-ol of the formula OH 1 -(4-phenyl-phenoxy)-3,3 -dimethyl-1 -(1,2,4-triazol-1 -yl)-butan-2-ol of the formula // V-/ \\ OH O CH-CH-C(CH3) 3'3 if If Ν- (bitertanol) (He) The formula (IV) includes the aniline derivatives of the formulae rv/ s-cci2f Ν =J \ S02-N(CH3)2 (|Va) (dichlofluanid) and (IVb) (tolylfluanid) It is evident from the formula for the active compound of the formula (V) that the compound has three asymmetrically substituted carbon atoms. The product may therefore be present as a mixture of various isomers, or else in the form of a single component. Particular preference is given to the compounds N-(R)-[ 1 -(4-chloro-phenyl)-ethyl]-( 1 S)-2,2-dichloro-1 -ethyl-3 t-methyl-1 r-cyclopropanecarboxamide of the formula j and N-(R)-[ 1 -(4-chloro-phenyl)-ethyl]-( lR)-2,2-dichloro-1 -ethyl-3t-methyl-1 r-cyclopropanecarboxamide of the formula (Vb) The formula (VII) includes the compounds (Vila) Me = Ζη (zineb) (Vllb) Me = Μη (maneb) and (Vile) mixture of (Vila) and (Vllb) (mancozeb). The formula (XVI) includes the compounds (XVIa) R2 = CH3 (pyrimethanil) and (XVTb) R2 <] (cyprodinyl) The formula (ΧΧ3) includes the compounds 4-(2,3-dichlorophenyl)-pyrrole-3-carbonitrile of the formula (XXI a) (fenpiclonil) 4-(2,2-difluoro-l,3-benzodioxol-7-yl)-lH-pyrrole-3-carbonitrile of the formula The guanidine derivative of the formula (XXV) is a mixture of substances of the common name guazatine.

Additionally, they may comprise further fungicidally active components. The synergistic effect is particularly pronounced when the active compounds in the active compound combinations according to the invention are present in certain weight ratios. However, the weight ratios of the active compounds in the active compound combinations can be varied within a relatively wide range. In general, 0.1 to 20 parts by weight, preferably 0.2 to 10 parts by weight, of active compound of group (1), 0.1 to 20 parts by weight, preferably 0.2 to 10 parts by weight, of active compound of group (2), 0.2 to 150 parts by weight, preferably 1 to 100 parts by weight, of active compound of group (3), 0.1 to 10 parts by weight, preferably 0.2 to 5 parts by weight, of active compound of group (4), 1 to 50 parts by weight, preferably 5 to 20 parts by weight, of active compound of group (5), 1 to 50 parts by weight, preferably 2 to 20 parts by weight, of active compound of group (6), 0.1 to 50 parts by weight, preferably 1 to 30 parts by weight, of active compound of group (7), 0.2 to 50 parts by weight, preferably 1 to 20 parts by weight, of active compound of group (8), Le A 32 322-Foreign Countries 0.02 to 50 parts by weight, preferably 0.2parts by weight, of active compound of group (9), 0.1 to 50 parts by weight, preferably 0.2parts by weight, of active compound of group (10), 0.1 to 50 parts by weight, preferably 0.2parts by weight, of active compound of group (11), 0.1 to 50 parts by weight, preferably 0.2parts by weight, of active compound of group (12), 0.1 to 50 parts by weight, preferably 0.2parts by weight, of active compound of group (13), 0.1 to 50 parts by weight, preferably 1 toparts by weight, of active compound of group (14), 0.1 to 50 parts by weight, preferably 0.2parts by weight, of active compound of group (15), 0.1 to 50 parts by weight, preferably 2 toparts by weight, of active compound of group (16), 1 to 20 parts by weight, preferably 2 toparts by weight, of active compound of group (17), 1 to 50 parts by weight, preferably 2 toparts by weight, of active compound of group (18), 1 to 50 parts by weight, preferably 2 toparts by weight, of active compound of group (19), Lc y-y J1 JJ.2 -1 OtUUU VOUliaiuS - 19 - 0.1 to 10 parts by weight, preferably 0.2 to 5 parts by weight, of active compound of group (20), 0.05 to 20 parts by weight, preferably 0.1 to 10 parts by weight, of active compound of group (21), 0.1 to 10 parts by weight, preferably 0.2 to 5 parts by weight, of active compound of group (22), 0.1 to 10 parts by weight, preferably 0.2 to 5 parts by weight, of active compound of group (23), and/or 0.1 to 10 parts by weight, preferably 0.2 to 5 parts by weight, of active compound of group (24) are present per part by weight of active compound of the formula (I). The active compound combinations according to the invention have very good fungicidal properties and can be employed for controlling phytopathogenic fungi, such as Plasmodiophoromycetes, Oomycetes, Chytridiomycetes, Zygomycetes, Ascomycetes, Basidiomycetes, Deuteromycetes, etc. The active compound combinations according to the invention are particularly suitable for controlling cereal diseases, such as Erysiphe, Puccinia and Fusarium, and for controlling diseases encountered in viticulture, such as Uncinula, Plasmopara and Botrytis, and furthermore in dicotylendonous crops for controlling powdery and downy mildew fungi and causative organisms of leaf spot. The fact that the active compound combinations are well tolerated by plants at the concentrations required for controlling plant diseases permits the treatment of above-Le A jj. jj.j.-coi'cmn Loumnes ground parts of plants, of propagation stock and seeds, and of the soil. The active compound combinations according to the invention can be employed for foliar application or else as seed dressings. The active compound combinations according to the invention can be converted to the customary formulations, such as solutions, emulsions, suspensions, powders, foams, pastes, granules, aerosols and microencapsulations in polymeric substances and in coating compositions for seeds, and ULV formulations. These formulations are produced in a known manner, for example by mixing the active compounds or active compound combinations with extenders, that is liquid solvents, liquefied gases under pressure, and/or solid carriers, optionally with the use of surfactants, that is emulsifiers and/or dispersants, and/or foam formers. If the extender used is water, it is also possible to use, for example, organic solvents as auxiliary solvents. Essentially, suitable liquid solvents include: aromatics such as xylene, toluene or alkylnaphthalenes, chlorinated aromatics or chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons such as chlorobenzenes, chloroethylenes or methylene chloride, aliphatic hydrocarbons such as cyclohexane or paraffins, for example petroleum fractions, alcohols such as butanol or glycol and their ethers and esters, ketones such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone or cyclohexanone, strongly polar solvents such as dimethylformamide and dimethyl sulphoxide, or else water. Liquefied gaseous extenders or carriers are to be understood as meaning liquids which are gaseous at ambient temperature and under atmospheric pressure, for example aerosol propellants such as butane, propane, nitrogen and carbon dioxide. Suitable solid carriers are: for example ground natural minerals such as kaolins, clays, talc, chalk, quartz, attapulgite, montmorillonite or diatomaceous earth, and ground synthetic minerals such as finely divided silica, alumina and silicates. Suitable solid carriers for granules are: for example crushed and fractionated natural rocks such as calcite, marble, pumice, sepiolite and dolomite, or else synthetic granules of inorganic and organic meals, and granules of organic material such as sawdust, coconut shells, maize cobs and tobacco stalks. Suitable emulsifiers and/or foam formers are: for example nonionic and anionic emulsifiers, such as polyoxyethylene fatty acid esters, polyoxyethylene fatty alcohol ethers, for example alkylaryl polyglycol ethers, alkylsulphonates, alkyl sulphates, arylsulphonates, or else protein hydrolysates. Suitable dispersants are: for example lignin-sulphite waste liquors and methylcellulose. Tackifiers such as carboxymethylcellulose and natural and synthetic polymers in the form of powders, granules or latices, such as gum arabic, polyvinyl alcohol and polyvinyl acetate, or else natural phospholipids such as cephalins and lecithins and synthetic phospholipids can be used in the formulations. Other additives can be mineral and vegetable oils. It is possible to use colorants such as inorganic pigments, for example iron oxide, titanium oxide and prussian blue, and organic dyestuffs such as alizarin dyestuffs, azo dyestuffs and metal phthalocyanine dyestuffs, and trace nutrients such as salts of iron, manganese, boron, copper, cobalt, molybdenum and zinc. The formulations generally comprise between 0.1 and 95% by weight of active compounds, preferably between 0.5 and 90%. In the formulations, the active compound combinations according to the invention can be present as a mixture with other known active compounds such as fungicides, insecticides, acaricides and herbicides, and as mixtures with fertilizers or plant growth regulators. The active compound combinations can be used as such, in the form of their formulations or as the use forms prepared therefrom, such as ready-to-use solutions, emulsifiable concentrates, emulsions, suspensions, wettable powders, soluble powders and granules. They are used in the customary manner, for example by watering, spraying, atomizing, scattering, spreading, and as a powder for dry seed treatment, a solution for seed treatment, a water-soluble powder for seed treatment, a water-soluble powder for slurry treatment, or by encrusting. When using the active compound combinations according to the invention, the application rates can be varied within a relatively wide range, depending on the kind of application. In the treatment of parts of plants, the application rates of the active Le A 32 322-boreign Countries compound combination are generally between 0.1 and 10,000 g/ha, preferably between 10 and 1000 g/ha. In the treatment of seeds, the application rates of the active compound combination are generally between 0.001 and 50 g per kilogram of seed, preferably between 0.01 and 10 g per kilogram of seed. In the treatment of the soil, the application rates of the active compound combination are generally between 0.1 and 10,000 g/ha, preferably between 1 and 5000 g/ha. The good fungicidal activity of the active compound combinations according to the invention is evident from the examples below. While the individual active compounds exhibit weaknesses with regard to the fungicidal activity, the combinations have an activity which exceeds a simple addition of activities. A synergistic effect of fungicides is always present when the fungicidal activity of the active compound combinations exceeds the total of the activities of the active compounds when applied individually. The expected activity for a given combination of two active compounds can be calculated as follows (cf. Colby, S.R., "Calculating Synergistic and Antagonistic Responses of Herbicide Combinations", Weeds 15, (1967), 20-22): If X is the efficacy when applying active compound A at an application rate of m g/ha, Υ is the efficacy when applying active compound Β at an application rate of η g/ha and Ε is the efficacy when applying the active compounds A and Β at an application rate of m and η g/ha, then Le A 32 322-roremn Loumaes Ε = Χ + Υ- Χ-Υ 100 The efficacy is calculated in %. 0% is an efficacy which corresponds to that of the control, whereas an efficacy of 100% means that no infection is observed. If the actual fungicidal activity exceeds the calculated value, then the activity of the combination is superadditive, i.e. a synergistic effect exists. In this case, the efficacy which was actually observed must be greater than the value for the expected efficacy (Ε) calculated from the abovementioned formula. The examples that follow illustrate the invention. uC L V 3 -1 ' v^OU-liLi Example 1 Sphaerotheca test (cucumber) / protective Solvent: Emulsifier: 47 parts by weight of acetone 3 parts by weight of alkylaryl polyglycol ether To produce a suitable preparation of active compound, 1 part by weight of active compound or active compound combination is mixed with the stated amounts of solvent and emulsifier, and the concentrate is diluted with water to the desired concentration, or a commercial formulation of active compound or active compound combination is diluted with water to the desired concentration.
