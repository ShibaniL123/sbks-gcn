Example 11. Preparation of N-phenyl-N-(3-(4-(4-(prop-2-ynyl)piperazine-1-carbonyl)phenyl)prop-2-ynyl)pentanamide (LMT-833)
The N-phenyl-N-(3-(4-(piperazine-1-carbonyl)phenyl)prop-2-ynyl)pentaneamide (50 mg, 0.124 mmol) obtained in Example 2 and potassium carbonate (51 mg, 0.372 mmol) were dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF; 2 ml), and stirred at room temperature for 5 minutes. Propargyl bromide (12 Âµl, 0.145 mmol) was added to the mixture, and stirred at room temperature for 17 hours. The reaction solution was filtered to remove a solid and concentrated under reduced pressure, and the concentrate was purified by silica gel column chromatography (CH2Cl2:MeOH=100:1), thereby obtaining a final product, N-phenyl-N-(3-(4-(4-(prop-2-ynyl)piperazine-1-carbonyl)phenyl)prop-2-ynyl)pentaneamide (28 mg, 51% yield).
