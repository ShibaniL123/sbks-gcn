16.9: 5-(2,3-difluorophenyl)-3-methyl-1-{2-oxo-2-[4-(2-oxo-1,2,4,5-tetrahydro-benzo[d][1,3]diazepin-3-yl)-piperidin-1-yl]-ethyl}-1H-pyrimidine-2,4-dione (compound 16)
Similarly to example 1.6, starting from 100 mg (0.3 mmol) of [5-(2,3-difluorophenyl)-3-methyl-2,4-dioxo-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrimidin-1-yl]-acetic acid and 100 mg (0.4 mmol) of 3-piperidin-4-yl-1,3,4,5-tetrahydro-benzo[d][1,3]diazepin-2-one (prepared as described in example 16.4) and after crystallization in a heptane/ethyl acetate mixture, 70/30; 120 mg (67%) of 5-(2,3-difluorophenyl)-3-methyl-1-{2-oxo-2-[4-(2-oxo-1,2,4,5-tetrahydro-benzo[d][1,3]diazepin-3-yl)-piperidin-1-yl]-ethyl}-1H-pyrimidine-2,4-dione is obtained in the form of a white solid with a melting point of 160Â° C.
