Example 7
(E)-3-(3,5-difluoro-4-((1S,3R/1R,3S)-2-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-3-methyl-6-((1-meth yl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)ethynyl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-1-yl)phenyl)acrylic acid
Step 1
(E)-methyl 3-(3,5-difluoro-4-((1S,3R/1R,3S)-2-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-3-methyl-6-(((trifluorom ethyl)sulfonyl)oxy)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-1 -yl)phenyl)acrylate
(E)-methyl 3-(3,5-difluoro-4-((1S,3R/1R,3S)-2-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-6-hydroxy-3-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-1-yl)phenyl)acrylate 3c (43 mg, 0.1 mmol) was dissolved in 1 mL of dichloromethane, then 2,6-lutidine (21 mg, 0.2 mmol) was added. Trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride (42 mg, 0.15 mmol) was added dropwise at 0Â°C. The reaction mixture was warmed up to room temperature. After stirring for 2 hours, the reaction was stopped. The reaction solution was concentrated under reduced pressure, and the residue was purified by thin-layer chromatography with elution system B to obtain the title compound (E)-methyl 3-(3,5-difluoro-4-((1S,3R/1R,3S)-2-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-3-methyl-6-(((trifluorom ethyl)sulfonyl)oxy)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-1-yl)phenyl)acrylate 7a (38 mg, yield 68%) as a yellow oil.
