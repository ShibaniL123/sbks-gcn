Preparation of (1S,3R)-1-(4-bromo-2-ethoxyphenyl)-2-((1-fluorocyclopropyl)methyl)-3,5-dimethyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-6-amine
4-Bromo-2-ethoxybenzaldehyde (0.775 g, 3.39 mmol) was added to a solution of (R)-3-(2-(((1-fluorocyclopropyl)methyl)amino)propyl)-2-methylaniline (0.400 g, 1.69 mmol) in AcOH (9 mL) and water (0.152 g, 8.46 mmol). The reaction was heated at 80° C. for 18 hours. After cooling, the reaction was concentrated under reduced pressure, and then the residue was dissolved in EtOAc and washed with saturated aqueous NaHCO3. The layers were separated, and the organic phase was combined with aqueous hydrochloric acid (1N). After stirring the biphasic mixture for 30 minutes, the layers were separated. The organic layer was washed with aqueous HCl (1N), and the combined aqueous layers were extracted with EtOAc (×2). The combined aqueous layers were then basified by addition of solid K2CO3 and extracted with EtOAc (×2). The organic extracts were combined, dried over sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was purified by flash silica chromatography, elution gradient 10 to 60% ethyl acetate in hexanes to afford (1S,3R)-1-(4-bromo-2-ethoxyphenyl)-2-((1-fluorocyclopropyl)methyl)-3,5-dimethyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-6-amine (0.48 g, 63%) as a solid.
