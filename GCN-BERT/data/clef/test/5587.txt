Synthesis of Compound 3-5
Under argon atmosphere, 3.0 g (6.19 mmol) of Intermediate c and 2.64 g (6.85 mmol) of 3-bromo-5″-phenyl-1,1″:3″,1″-terphenyl were mixed with 26 mL of anhydrous xylene. 0.120 g (0.130 mmol) of tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium (Pd2(dba)3), 0.150 g (0.520 mmol) of tri-tert-butylphosphine tetrafluoroborate ((t-Bu)3P/BF4), and 0.90 g (9.37 mmol) of sodium-t-butoxide (t-BuONa) were added, and the mixture was refluxed for 8 hours. The mixture was cooled to room temperature and filtered through celite. The product was then extracted with toluene and saturated saline solution. The resultant obtained therefrom was purified by column chromatography to obtain 2.0 g (yield: 41%) of light yellow Compound 3-5 (the structure thereof was identified by LC-MS).
