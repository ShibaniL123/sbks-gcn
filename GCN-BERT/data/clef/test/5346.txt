A RAPID AND EFFICIENT BIOORTHOGONAL LIGATION REACTION AND BORON-CONTAINING HETEROCYCLES USEFUL IN CONJUNCTION THEREWITH STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST This invention was made with government support under R15 GM-093941 awarded by NIH NIGMS. The government has certain rights in the invention. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Each of the references discussed in this specification are expressly incorporated by reference in their entirety, whether or not specifically mentioned in association therewith. "Click chemistry" is a technology first developed by Sharpless at Scripps Institute, employing a copper (I) catalyzed reaction in which azide moieties are attached via a 1,3- cycloaddition with an alkyne. Copper-free click chemistry reactions are also possible. Methods of using click chemistry are known in the art and include those described by Rostovtsev et al., Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2002, 41, 2596-99 and Sun et al., Bioconjugate Chem., 2006, 17, 52-57, Baskin et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 2007, 104, 16793-16797). Unfortunately, the mandatory copper catalyst is toxic to both bacterial and mammalian cells, thus precluding applications wherein the cells must remain viable. Catalyst-free Huisgen cycloadditions of alkynes activated by electron- withdrawing substituents have been reported to occur at ambient temperatures. However, these compounds undergo Michael reaction with biological nucleophiles. "Click Chemistry" reactions are high yielding, wide in scope, create only byproducts that can be removed without chromatography, simple to perform, and can be conducted in easily removable or benign solvents. This concept was developed in parallel with the interest within the pharmaceutical, materials, and other industries in capabilities for generating large libraries of compounds for screening in discovery research. Several types of reaction have been identified that fulfill these criteria, thermodynamically-favored reactions that lead specifically to one product, such as nucleophilic ring opening reactions of epoxides and aziridines, non-aldol type carbonyl reactions, such as formation of hydrazones and heterocycles, additions to carbon- carbon multiple bonds, such as oxidative formation of epoxides and Michael Additions, and cycloaddition reactions. The azide-alkyne cycloaddition fulfills many of the prerequisites. Many of the starting monosubstituted alkynes and organic azides are available commercially, many others can easily be synthesized with a wide range of functional groups, and their cycloaddition reaction selectively gives 1,2,3-triazoles. See Fig. 45. Unfortunately, the thermal Huisgen 1,3-Dipolar Cycloaddition of alkynes to azides requires elevated temperatures and often produces mixtures of the two regioisomers when using asymmetric alkynes. In this respect, the classic 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition fails as a true "click" reaction. A copper-catalyzed variant that follows a different mechanism can be conducted under aqueous conditions, even at room temperature. Additionally, whereas the classic Huisgen 1,3- dipolar cycloaddition often gives mixtures of regioisomers, the copper-catalyzed reaction allows the synthesis of the 1,4-disubstituted regioisomers specifically. By contrast, a later developed ruthenium-catalyzed reaction gives the opposite regioselectivity with the formation of 1,5- disubstituted triazoles. Thus, these catalyzed reactions comply with the definition of click chemistry and have put a focus on azide-alkyne cycloaddition as a prototype click reaction. See Fig. 46. 1 5 eq 0.2 eq. Cul 0.4 eq.

A biocompatible click reaction must have these characteristics but in addition such reactions need to proceed in dilute aqueous solution at neutral pH, and preferably with rapid kinetics. A bioorthogonal click reaction possesses all the characteristics of a biocompatible reaction with the additional requirement that the reactive functional groups do not form stable covalent bonds with functionalities in the biological system. One of the first types of reaction that was used for bioorthogonal ligations is the reaction of aldehydes and ketones with heteroatom-bonded amines that are sometimes called "a-effect amines" (hydrazine, hydrazide, and other amine-nitrogen compounds, aminooxy reagents, etc.). While an amine- aldehyde/ketone reaction is highly reversible in aqueous solution, an a-effect amine-aldehyde/ketone reaction proceeds readily in mildly acidic aqueous solution to form a product (hydrazone or oxime) that is considerably more stable and less reversible than the product formed with a simple amine. The characteristics of the reaction are sharply dependent on the precise nature of a-effect amine and the carbonyl-containing reactive partner. Such reactions have been well studied. (Jencks, W. P. (1969) Catalysis in Chemistry and Enzymology (McGraw-Hill Series in Advanced Chemistry), McGraw-Hill.) The alpha effect refers to the increased nucleophilicity of a molecule due to the presence of an adjacent (alpha) atom with lone pair electrons. These include hydrazine, hydroxylamine, the hypochlorite ion and the hydroperoxide anion. (Buncel, E., and Um, I.-H. (2004) The a-effect and its modulation by solvent, Tetrahedron 60, 7801-7825.) A major drawback to the use of aldehyde-ketone condensation reactions with a-effect amines is that the optimal pH of the reaction is normally 2-5, which is much lower than physiological pH. (Smith, P. A. S. (1982) Derivatives of Hydrazine and Other Hydronitro gens Having N-N Bonds, The Benjamin/Cummings Publishing Company, London.) Attempts to speed up the reactions at neutral pH include addition of an aromatic amine as a catalyst. Other efforts have focused on changing the structure of the nucleophile (hydrazine) or the substituents on an aromatic aldehyde, including adding an intramolecular proton source for catalysis. (Dirksen, A., Hackeng, T. M., and Dawson, P. E. (2006) Nucleophilic catalysis of oxime ligation, Angewandte Chemie-International Edition 45, 7581-7584. Kool, E. T., Crisalli, P., and Chan, K. M. (2014) Fast Alpha Nucleophiles: Structures that Undergo Rapid Hydrazone/Oxime Formation at Neutral pH, Org. Lett. 16, 1454-1457.) Another drawback of aldehyde-ketone condensation reactions with α-effect amines is the product may not be sufficiently stable under physiological conditions. (Agarwal, P., van der Weijden, J., Sletten, E. M., Rabuka, D., and Bertozzi, C. R. (2013) A Pictet-Spengler ligation for protein chemical modification, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 110, 46-51. However, the vast majority of examples use the hydrazone and oxime-forming reactions mentioned previously because of their bioorthogonality, operational simplicity (i.e., no auxiliary reagents are required), and good yields under mild aqueous conditions. However, the resulting C=N bonds are susceptible to hydrolysis (Mueller BM, Wrasidlo WA, Reisfeld RA. Antibody conjugates with morpholinodoxorubicin and acid-cleavable linkers. Bioconjug Chem. 1990;l(5):325-330.), undermining the use of such conjugates in situations in which long-term stability is required. The oxime has been identified as the most hydrolytically stable C=N linkage, but it is still thermodynamically unstable to hydrolysis under dilute conditions, decomposing via an acid- catalyzed process (Kalia J, Raines RT. Hydrolytic stability of hydrazones and oximes. Angew Chem Int Ed Engl. 2008;47(39):7523-7526). Many researchers have found that oxime conjugates that are kept under ideal storage conditions— low temperature, high concentration, and neutral or high pH— are kinetically stable and are therefore suitable for short-term laboratory studies (Hudak JE, Yu HH, Bertozzi CR. Protein glycoengineering enabled by the versatile synthesis of aminooxy glycans and the genetically encoded aldehyde tag. J Am Chem Soc. 2011;133(40):16127-16135; Shi X, et al. Quantitative fluorescence labeling of aldehyde-tagged proteins for single-molecule imaging. Nat Methods. 2012;9(5):499-503; Yi L, et al. A highly efficient strategy for modification of proteins at the C terminus. Angew Chem Int Ed Engl. 2010;49(49):9417-9421.). However, biological applications requiring extended persistence of the conjugate at physiological temperatures and low concentrations necessitate a significantly more stable covalent linkage than the oxime provides. Bioorthogonal reactions are chemical reactions that can be used in biological systems, coupling one reactive group specifically with another reactive group: without side reactions; in neutral, aqueous solution; and under additional conditions that are compatible with the biological system. Bioorthogonal reactions can be used for conjugating a biomolecule and a reporter; in biotechnology; proteomics; (bio)polymer engineering; sensors and detectors; and drug delivery.

The ideal bioconjugation chemistry has, for example, the following characteristics, some of which are optional or context dependent (adapted from Solulink, Inc. White paper on Bioconjugation Chemistry): a) linkers must be incorporated on biomolecules in a mild, controllable manner b) the inherent biological function of the biomolecules must be unaffected after modification and conjugation c) the conjugation reaction occurs directly upon mixing the two modified biomolecules, preferably not requiring addition of an oxidant, reductant, or metal. d) modified biomolecules are stable over extended periods e) conjugation occurs in buffered aqueous solutions, at a physiological pH f) stoichiometrically efficient (e.g., 1:1) g) fast reaction kinetics h) no undesirable covalent side reactions during modification i) linkers can be incorporated on a variety of biomolecules, including oligonucleotides and peptides. The concept of bioorthogonality means that the technology does not interfere with biological processes in the same medium (unless specifically targeted), and the technology is not interfered with by components of the biological medium. Bioorthogonal processes therefore occur in aqueous medium, without addition of toxic substances (or toxic concentrations of substances), within a physiological pH range (e.g., -6-8), at physiological temperatures (e.g., 0- 42C, depending on species) and pressures (e.g., 1 Atm), are not interactive with physiological thiols or amines, or are sensitive to redox chemistry. Further, the biological environment typically contains a range of enzymes that can degrade certain structures, and therefore bioorthogonal reaction reagents or products should not be sensitive to modification by the various enzymes in the medium.

Generally, direct esterification is carried out in organic solvents and requires either of two methods to shift the equilibrium to afford the product (ester) in good yields: continuous removal of water during the reaction (azeotropically or using dehydrating agents) and use of a large excess of one of the reactants.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present technology provides a bioorthogonal reaction and reagents useful therein, which comprise a boronic acid or ester having an ortho carbonyl or aldehyde on an optionally substituted aryl or aromatic heterocyclic compound, which reacts with an alpha-effect amine under biologically compatible conditions. The result of a reaction is a dehydration reaction, forming a hydrazono or imino arylboronic acid product (A). The product from the dehydration reaction is frequently followed by a second reaction to form a heterocyclic ring that contains a boron atom, e.g., a 3,4-borazaisoquinoline (B) or a related boron-containing heterocycle such as a l,2-dihydrobenzo[d][l,2,3]diazaborinin-l-uide (C). The reaction generally approaches the ideal "click chemistry" profile; it occurs without toxic reagents in aqueous solution at neutral pH, with high reaction yields, rapid and spontaneous initiation, and lack of cross reactivity in a physiological environment. The rate of formation of these products in neutral aqueous solution is considerably greater than the rate of formation of substrates without the boronic acid or ester. Furthermore, the final product is more stable than the corresponding product without the boron atom. See Fig. 1 Fig. 1 shows the reaction of aromatic boronic acid or ester with cc-effect amines. The structure of the final product is a function of the various R groups. Product A may be the final product (especially when X=0) or it may be an intermediate product (especially when X=NH). With many types of substituents, particularly when R2 is alkyl, substituted alkyl, or aryl, molecules with the core structure of Product B will be the final product. The product labeled C is a form of products A or B that may be produced depending on the substituents. The characteristics of the reaction of ortho-carbonyl phenylboronic acid or ester with an a-effect amine are different from those of the reaction of other aromatic aldehydes and ketones with these reagents. The reaction is very fast at neutral pH, and no catalyst is needed. The observed reaction may be faster with hydrazides than hydrazines. This is the opposite of how an a-effect amine behaves with any other known aldehyde or ketone. Under some reaction conditions, a methyl ketone reacts faster than the corresponding aldehyde. This is the opposite of how these reactions normally behave. (a-Effect Amines and Carbonyls: Mechanism and Catalysis for Phenylhydrazone Formation from Aromatic Heterocyclic Aldehydes, J. Org. Chem., Vol. 41, No. 26, 1976; Jencks, W. P. (1964) Mechanism and catalysis of simple carbonyl group reactions, Progr. Phys. Org. Chem. (Saul G. Cohen, Andrew Streitwieser, Jr., and Robert W. Taft, editors. Interscience) 2, 63-128; Jencks, W. P. (1959) Mechanism of oxime and semicarbazone formation, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 81, 475-481.) Boronic esters may hydrolyze to form boronic acids and alcohols in aqueous solution. (Achilli, C, Ciana, A., Fagnoni, M., Balduini, C, and Minetti, G. (2013) Susceptibility to hydrolysis of phenylboronic pinacol esters at physiological pH, Cent. Eur. J. Chem. 11, 137- 139.) Reaction of these solutions with a-effect amines proceeds. Therefore, other forms of boron can be used in the reaction provided that they undergo hydrolysis to form the boronic acid. (For example, pinacol ester-masked boronic acids.) Thus, while the reaction typically involves boronic acids having an ortho carbonyl, the reagent added to the medium may be a precursor of this structure, such as a boronic acid ester or blocked boronate, and an ortho enol or enamine. The boronic acid and carbonyl are typically ortho substituted on an aromatic ring, but may be part of other structures, such as heterocycles or non-aryl compositions. 3,4-Borazaisoquinolines and related heterocycles were originally prepared to study "non- benzenoid" aromaticity (Dewar, M. J. S., and Dougherty, R. C. (1962) Boron-containing analogs of isoquinoline, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 84, 2648-2649; Gronowitz, S., and Namtvedt, J. (1967) Heteroaromatic boron compounds. II. Synthesis, nuclear magnetic resonance- spectra, and hydrolytic stability of some borazarothienopyridines, Acta Chem. Scand. 21, 2151-2166.) The methods by which they were synthesized are typical for synthetic organic chemistry. High concentrations of components, which are in virtually all examples heated in an organic solvent such as ethanol, often containing acid catalysts. The few examples of reactions that were performed in aqueous solution were normally highly concentrated, exposed to acidic pH (pH 6) and/or were boiled or subjected to a long reaction time.

(1997) Planar Boron Heterocycles with Nucleic Acid-Like Hydrogen-Bonding Motifs, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 119, 7817-7826.) The reaction of ortho-carbonyl phenylboronic acid or ester with an a-effect amine is a known reaction; however, it has not previously been applied to coupling under physiological conditions, i.e., aqueous solvent, physiologically compatible temperature, pH, lack of reagents at toxic concentrations, etc. The present technology comprises coupling two molecules to react with quantitative yields under physiological conditions and without harsh conditions or organic solvents, with the possibility of further rearranging to form a boron-containing heterocycle or related product. Many biomolecules are stable in a limited pH range (near neutral pH), temperature (0-37 degrees centigrade, or higher in some organisms, e.g., 40, 43, 45, 50, or 55C, and lower, especially in organisms having antifreeze properties, e.g., -5C) and environment (aqueous). Coupling reactions that can be performed under conditions that preserve the structure and activity of the biomolecule have many potential applications. The pH range is preferably 2-9, more preferably 6-8, and most preferably 6.5 to 7.5. The reaction preferably proceeds to essential completion within 10 minutes under the biocompatible conditions. The product of the reaction may be stable at neutral pH for many months. Stability of the product at various pHs depends on the substitution pattern. This property may be useful for pH- dependent reversal of the coupling reaction. Preliminary cytotoxicity studies do not reveal toxicity, and there is reason to believe that it will not be very toxic to mammals. For example, boronic acids are generally non-toxic. ( Ciaravino, V., Plattner, J., and Chanda, S. (2013) An assessment of the genetic toxicology of novel boron-containing therapeutic agents, Environ. Mol. Mutag. 54, 338-346.) They are not metabolized in humans. Sulfonyl-substituted 3,4-borazaisoquinolines that have been tested for antimicrobial activity are generally not cytotoxic (Future Science 1 1275-1288, 2009). There are a number of reported in vivo (including human) studies of p-borophenylalanine (LaHann, T. R., Sills, C, Hematillake, G., Dymock, T., and Daniell, G. (1993) Cardiovascular toxicities associated with intravenous administration of p-boronophenylalanine formulations, pp 513-517, Plenum; LaHann, T. R., Bauer, W. F., Gavin, P., and Lu, D. R. (1994) Pharmacokinetics and toxicity of a p-boronophenylalanine-cyclodextrin formulation delivered by intravenous infusion to dogs, ACS Symp. Ser. 545, 66-78.) The ortho carbonyl (e.g., aldehyde, ketone) derivatives of p-boronophenylalanine are believed to be useful to provide selective coupling to peptides in which the p-boronophenylalanine derivative substitutes for a naturally occurring amino acid. See Fig. 2. p-boronophenylalanine It is therefore an object to provide a process for preparing a hydrazono or imino arylboronic acid, 3,4-borazaisoquinoline or a l,2-dihydrobenzo[d][l,2,3]diazaborinin-l-uide comprising: contacting a carbonyl-substituted arylboronic acid with an a-effect amine in an aqueous medium for a time sufficient to form the product. The reaction is preferably carried out at ambient temperature, and/or at neutral pH. Equimolar amounts of the carbonyl-substituted arylboronic acid and the a-effect amine may be contacted, and the reaction between these components preferably proceeds essentially to completion, with minimal or no side reactions. The carbonyl substituted arylboronic acid may comprise an ortho formyl phenylboronic acid derivative; or an ortho ketone phenylboronic acid derivative.

The α-effect amine may comprises a hydrazine, a semicarbazide, a thiosemicarbazide, a hydrazide, a thiohydrazide, a hydroxylamine, an O-alkylhydroxylamine or an O- arylhydroxylamine . In some cases, reactions between competing boronic acid esters and/or a- amines may be provided, wherein the ratio of product serves, e.g., as an indicator of process. Likewise, one or more fluorescent reporters or fluorescence quenching molecules may be linked to the boronic acid ester, and/or a-amine. The aqueous medium preferably has a pH between 2 and 9, more preferably between 6 and 8, and most preferably between 7.0 and 7.5. The aqueous medium may have a pH of about 7. The time is preferably less than about 10 minutes at a temperature, between about 0C and 37C, and for example proceeds essentially to completion e.g., >90 yield, within 5 minutes at 25-37C. The hydrazono or imino arylboronic acid, 3,4-borazaisoquinoline or a 1,2- dihydrobenzo[d][l,2,3]diazaborinin-l-uide derivative, carbonyl-substituted arylboronic acid, a- effect amine, and aqueous medium are preferably each bioorthogonal. It is another object to provide a reaction method comprising combining a carbonyl- substituted arylboronic acid and an a-effect amine in aqueous solution at a temperature between about -5C to 55C, and a pH between 2 and 8 to produce an adduct A, which may then proceed to form B or C, see Fig. 1: C Ri may be H or pinacol, or more generally any boronic acid or ester forming compound which readily hydrolyses in aqueous solvent under physiological conditions, e.g., CrC6 alkyl which optionally may incorporate one further heteroatom selected from nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur, formyl or C2-C6 alkanoyl, OCH2Ar or OCH2CH3Ar in which the Ar group may be a phenyl, a substituted phenyl ring, a naphtyl, a heteroaromatic ring or fused ring comprising at least one ring heteroatom selected from nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur.

It is a further object to provide a composition, comprising at least one of (see Figs. 39A- D): wherein R2 is H or CH3; R3 is alkyl or OR (which may be, e.g., alkyl, alkylamine, alkylthiol, alkylbromide aryl, heteroaryl, which optionally may incorporate one further heteroatom selected from nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur, C2-C6 alkanoyl, CH2Ar or CH2CH2Ar in which the Ar group may be a phenyl, a substituted phenyl ring, a naphtyl, a heteroaromatic ring or fused ring comprising at least one ring heteroatom selected from nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur, a 4 to 7 ring optionally incorporating one or more heteroatoms selected from oxygen, nitrogen or sulfur, an aromatic ring optionally substituted with fluorescent groups, sugars and polyethylene glycol chains); and R5 is H, CH3, CH2CH3, CH2Ph, Ph, substituted Ph, NH2, for example. The alpha carbon of the carbonyl may be bonded to an amine (see Figs. 40A-40C): R5 may comprise an aryl group having an ortho nucleophile, 2-hydroxy phenyl, 2-amino phenyl, or a nucleophilic substituent that cyclizes with the boron atom. It is another object to provide a composition as follows (see Fig. 35A-35B): A further object provides a process comprising, contacting a first composition having a boron atom bonded to a sp hybridized carbon, the boron having at least one labile substituent, conjugated with a cis-carbonyl, with a second composition having an cc-effect amine, in an aqueous medium for a time sufficient to form an adduct, which may proceed to further products.

X3 = O or N, X4 = OH, H20, or other heteroatom containing group (usually solvent). See, WO 2013/084198. The aqueous medium preferably has a neutral pH, e.g., pH 6.8-7.5. The process is preferably performed at a temperature between OC and 45C, e.g., 25C-37C.

General: Each component (o-carbonyl-substituted phenylboronic acid, alpha-effect amine-containing molecule) is dissolved in water or in buffer, normally pH 7, at room temperature. The solutions are mixed such that the molar ratio of the components in the mixture is 1:1. The concentration of each reagent is normally 30 μΜ to 5 mM. Normally a single product is formed. Stereoisomers can be formed when the product contains a chirality center. The structure of the product is identified by 1H, 13C and nB NMR. Reactions are followed by absorption difference spectroscopy. EXAMPLE 1 Demonstration of reaction kinetics. Salicylaldehyde (Sal) represents a typical aromatic aldehyde used in a coupling reaction. Ortho-formylphenylboronic acid (2f-PBA) exemplifies the effect of the boronic acid at the ortho position. The a-effect amine is an aromatic hydrazine, e.g., phenylhydrazine. The reaction is shown in Fig. 3. Therefore the boronic acid substituted fPBA produces a stable cyclic product, while the product Sal with phenylhydrazine does not cyclize. EXAMPLE 2 3-Formyltyrosine represents a typical aromatic aldehyde used in a coupling reaction. fPBA exemplifies the effect of the boronic acid at the ortho position. The α-effect amine is an aromatic hydrazide, e.g., 7-diethylamino coumarin 3-carbohydrazide (CHzide), as shown in Fig. 5. Hydrazides react with aldehydes only very slowly at neutral pH. The corresponding reaction with a boronic acid ortho- to the aldehyde is complete in minutes. The 3-formyl-4- boronophenylalanine derivative would be expected to engage in similar reactions, with similar kinetics, to fPBA, in this reaction, and therefore may be used to derivatize peptides for compatibility with the present click reaction. EXAMPLE 3 2-Acetylphenylboronic acid exemplifies a ketone-substituted phenylboronic acid. Acetophenone exemplifies an aromatic ketone. See Fig. 7. No reaction was observed with acetophenone under the general conditions noted above. However, the reaction of 2- acetylphenylboronic acid with 7-(diethylamino) coumarin-3-carbohydrazide does lead to an adduct. Note that this reaction is faster than the reaction in example 2. This is the opposite of the normal trend for hydrazone-forming reactions. EXAMPLE 4 Comparison of Hydrazide vs. Hydrazine. A test was conducted to compare the reaction of fPBA with phenylhydrazide and benzylhydrazine in pH 7 buffer. The hydrazide reagent reacts faster. See Fig. 9. EXAMPLE 5 Reaction of fPBA with a-effect amines in pH 7 buffer. Each component (o-carbonyl- substituted phenylboronic acid, alpha-effect amine-containing molecule) is dissolved in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7, at room temperature. The concentration of each reagent is normally 1-2 mM. The solutions are mixed such that the molar ratio of the components in the mixture is 1:1. Proton NMR spectra are collected within 10 minutes after mixing. Shown are spectra of the results from mixing fPBA with O-methylhydroxylamine, hydroxylamine and hydrazine hydrate. See Fig. 11. EXAMPLE 6 Coupling to Proteins. Hydrazine- and hydrazide-containing bovine serum albumen (BSA) were used as a model to demonstrate the coupling reaction between fPBA and alpha-effect amines on proteins. BSA containing phenylhydrazine functionalities was prepared by allowing the hydroxysuccimidyl ester of 4-(2-(propan-2-ylidene)hydrazinyl)benzoic acid to react with the protein. Hydrazine-BSA or unmodified BSA (final concentration 15 μΜ) was allowed to react with coumarin-2fPBA at room temperature for 5 min. See Figs. 42A, 42B and 42C. The samples were then prepared for SDS PAGE analysis. The gel was visualized using long wave UV light and was then stained for protein, as shown in Fig. 44, in which the left panel is imaged under long wavelength UV (negative of the image is shown for clarity), and the right panel shows a Coomassie stained gel. BSA with hydrazide functionalities was prepared by allowing oxidized BSA to react with adipic dihydrazide. BSA hydrazide (Zide-BSA, final concentration 10 μΜ) or oxidized BSA (O- BSA, final concentration 10 μΜ) was allowed to react with 20 μΜ C-2fPBA for 30 min in 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7) prior to rapid gel filtration. The samples were excited at 320 nm, the absorption maximum of the fluorophore, and emission spectra were collected. Each spectrum was normalized by protein concentration estimated by BCA assay. See Fig. 43A, 43B and 43C. EXAMPLE 7 Bifunctional linkers. Molecules that possess a second reactive functional groups may be used to link the boronic acid or boronic ester conjugated to a carbonyl-containing moiety to the desired partner, as shown in Fig. 16. A boronic acid or boronic ester conjugated to a carbonyl- containing moiety. The ring may be substituted. A reactive functional group (R3) is appended to the ring or part of a substituent attached to the ring. See Fig. 1, left structure. EXAMPLE 8 C terminal protein labeling. Tyrosine hydrazide (Y-zide) is covalently bonded to the carboxyl terminus of alpha-tubulin using the enzyme tubulin tyrosine ligase as described in Mukherjee and Bane. (Mukherjee, K., and Bane, S. L. (2013) Site-specific fluorescent labeling of tubulin, In Microtubules, In Vitro 2nd ed., pp 1-12.) Y-zide-tubulin is equilibrated in PME buffer (0.1 M PIPES, 1 mM MgS04, 2 mM EGTA, pH 6.9) using rapid gel filtration. To the Y- zide-tubulin solution is added fPBA in 10 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7. The final concentration of Y-zide-tubulin and of fPBA is 93 μΜ. The reaction progress is monitored by absorption spectroscopy. The appearance of a shoulder at -310 nm is indicative of product formation. See Fig. 13. C-terminal hydrazide-containing proteins may be synthesized as described by Thorn et al (Jennifer Thorn; David Anderson; Joanne McGregor; Graham Cotton; Bioconjugate Chem. 2011, 22, 1017-1020. The probe or substance of interest (fluorophore, nanoparticle, protein, carbohydrate, surface, etc.) is covalently bonded to the reactive functional group on the probe (such as amine, thiol, azide, alkyne) using standard methods. The hydrazide-containing protein is allowed to react with the probe at neutral pH at microM to millimilar concentration and 1 : 1 stoichiometry at room temperature for 5-60 min. Progress of the reaction may be monitored by a change in the absorption spectrum. See Fig. 15. EXAMPLE 9 In addition to the method shown in Example 6, internal amino acid protein labeling may be performed using unnatural amino acid mutagenesis. Unnatural amino acid mutagenesis is a known method for adding reactive functional groups to proteins. This has been done with boronophenylalanine. (Liu, C. C, and Schultz, P. G. (2010) Adding New Chemistries to the Genetic Code, In Annual Review of Biochemistry, Vol 79 (Kornberg, R. D., Raetz, C. R. H., Rothman, J. E., and Thorner, J. W., Eds.), pp 413-444, US 8,637,306, US 20090148887; Int'l Application PCT/US2008/081868 entitled "A Genetically Encoded Boronate Amino Acid," filed Oct. 30, 2008; US 8,637,306; US 8,632,970; US 8,609,383; US 20110312027; US 20100297693; WO 2013/084198; Miyaura and Suzuki (1995) "Palladium-Catalyzed Cross- Coupling Reactions of Organoboron Compounds," Chemical Reviews 95: 2457 and Suzuki (1999) "Recent advances in the cross-coupling reactions of organoboron derivatives with organic electrophiles, 1995-1998," Journal of Organometallic Chemistry 576:147.) Therefore, the present technology provides that a protein labeled with an ortho-carbonyl substituted boronophenylalanine can be coupled using a click chemistry reaction to a hydrazide molecule as discussed herein for labeling C-termini. Alternatively, protein with an alpha-effect amine - containing unnatural amino acid could be prepared using unnatural amino acid mutagenesis or synthetic chemistry techniques for coupling to an ortho-carbonyl-substituted phenylboronic acid. EXAMPLE 10 Drug- Antibody Conjugates are provided. Procedures for coupling fluorophores to proteins are generally applicable to coupling drugs to targeting proteins such as antibodies. One example of an antibody-drug complex is Trastuzumab emtansine, which has been used for HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. Maytansine can be attached to the antibody through an MCC linker, as shown below. See, Elkins K et al. Mol Cancer Ther 2012;11:2222-2232. See Fig. 20. Likewise, Taxol may be linked through a spacer modified to terminate in a formylboronic acid fPBA or a hydrazide for coupling to targeting proteins such as antibodies. A Taxol derivative with an amine-terminated spacer is known. Altering the spacer to terminate in an alpha-effect amine or an ortho carbonyl-phenylboronic acid allows for the drug to be attached to the appropriately modified antibody. See Figs. 21 and 22. In order to add a hydrazide or ortho-carbonyl phenylboronic acid functionality to an antibody, a standard coupling procedure that uses maleimide reactive groups and Cys residues in the protein can be employed (Shen, B.-Q.; Xu, K.; Liu, L.; Raab, H.; Bhakta, S.; Kenrick, M.; Parsons-Reponte, K. L.; Tien, J.; Yu, S.-F.; Mai, E.; Li, D.; Tibbitts, J.; Baudys, J.; Saadi, O. M.; Scales, S. J.; McDonald, P. J.; Hass, P. E.; Eigenbrot, C; Trung, N.; Solis, W. A.; Fuji, R. N.; Flagella, K. M.; Patel, D.; Spencer, S. D.; Khawlil, L. A.; Ebens, A.; Wong, W. L.; Vandlen, R.; Kaur, S.; Sliwkowski, M. X.; Scheller, R. H.; Polakis, P.; Junutula, J. R., Conjugation site modulates the in vivo stability and therapeutic activity of antibody-drug conjugates. Nat. Biotechnol. 2012, 30 (2), 184-189.) A bifunctional reagent that possesses a maleimide and either a hydrazide or a formylboronic acid can be used to add the linker, as shown in Fig. 23. Alternatively, the antibody may be expressed with unnatural amino acids, as is known with different reactive amino acids. (Axup, J. Y., Bajjuri, K. M., Ritland, M., Hutchins, B. M., Kim, C. H., Kazane, S. A., Haider, R., Forsyth, J. S., Santidrian, A. F., Stafin, K., Lu, Y., Tran, H., Seller, A. J., Biroc, S. L., Szydlik, A., Pinkstaff, J. K., Tian, F., Sinha, S. C, Felding- Habermann, B., Smider, V. V., and Schultz, P. G. (2012) Synthesis of site-specific antibody-drug conjugates using unnatural amino acids, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 109, 16101-16106; Tian, F.; Lu, Y.; Manibusan, A.; Sellers, A.; Tran, H.; Sun, Y.; Phuong, T.; Barnett, R.; Hehli, B.; Song, F.; DeGuzman, M. J.; Ensari, S.; Pinkstaff, J. K.; Sullivan, L. M.; Biroc, S. L.; Cho, H.; Schultz, P. G.; DiJoseph, J.; Dougher, M.; Ma, D.; Dushin, R.; Leal, M.; Tchistiakova, L.; Feyfant, E.; Gerber, H.-P.; Sapra, P., A general approach to site-specific antibody drug conjugates. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 2014, 111 (5), 1766-1771.). See Figs. 24 and 25. A key advantage of this technology is that the drug may be coupled to the antibody quickly, at neutral pH and without excess reagent. Integrating a non-natural amino acid reduces post-production steps for the antibody, and allows the antibody to be labeled after addition to a biological system; the standard coupling procedure is not selective, and will add hydrazine functionality to all exposed cysteine residues. EXAMPLE 11 Nanoparticle-biomolecule conjugates. Gold nanoparticles (1-100 nm), nanospheres and nanorods have applications in photo thermal therapy and optical and contrast imaging techniques. (Algar, W. R., Prasuhn, D. E., Stewart, M. H., Jennings, T. L., Blanco-Canosa, J. B., Dawson, P. E., and Medintz, I. L. (2011) The Controlled Display of Biomolecules on Nanoparticles: A Challenge Suited to Bioorthogonal Chemistry, Bioconj. Chem. 22, 825-858.) Targeting nanoparticles to particular in vivo locations requires conjugation to a biological moiety. The gold nanostructure must first be coated with an appropriate linkers, which is generally accomplished through bifunctional thiol ligands, as shown in Fig. 45. EXAMPLE 12 Biomolecules may be attached to a surface according to the present technology. 96 well plates with hydrazide functional groups are commercially available (for example, Corning Carbo-BIND 96 well plates). Biomolecules that have been covalently modified with the reactive ortho-carbonyl phenylboronic acid can then be attached to these plates by adding the desired molecule to the well. If the modified protein is an antibody, then such plates may be used for ELISA (Brillhart, K. L., and Ngo, T. T. (1991) Use Of Microwell Plates Carrying Hydrazide Groups To Enhance Antibody Immobilization In Enzyme Immunoassays, J. Immunol. Methods 144, 19-25.). Other commercially available products include hydrazide-modified magnetic beads (BcMag®Hydrazide-modified Magnetic Beads; Bioclone Inc), hydrazide containing resins (Affi-Gel Hz hydrazide gel, Bio-Rad), glass slides, membranes, plates, and nanoparticles (Biosynthesis, Inc.) See also Applying Genomic and Proteomic Microarray Technology inDrug Discovery, Second edition. (Robert S. Matson, ed. CRC Press, 2013). See Fig. 26A. A bifunctional ortho-carbonyl phenylboronic acid linker can also be attached to appropriately functionalized solid supports, surfaces or beads. The production is within the ordinary skill in the art, for example, immobilized phenylboronic acids are commercially available (Pierce™ Boronic Acid Resin, Affi-Gel® Boronate Affinity Gel), Such surfaces would be then be available for linking to substances containing alpha-effect amines. See Fig. 26B. EXAMPLE 13 Nucleic acid conjugates are provided. Hydrazides can be appended easily to nucleic acids. (See, for example, Ghosh, S. S., Kao, P. M., and Kwoh, D. Y. (1989) Synthesis Of 5'- Oligonucleotide Hydrazide Derivatives And Their Use In Preparation Of Enzyme Nucleic-Acid Hybridization Probes, Analytical Biochemistry 178, 43-51; Raddatz, S., Mueller-Ibeler, J., Kluge, J., Wass, L., Burdinski, G., Havens, J. R., Onofrey, T. J., Wang, D., and Schweitzer, M. (2002) Hydrazide oligonucleotides: new chemical modification for chip array attachment and conjugation, Nucleic Acids Res. 30, 4793-4802; Zatsepin, T. S., Stetsenko, D. A., Gait, M. J., and Oretskaya, T. S. (2005) Use of carbonyl group addition-elimination reactions for synthesis of nucleic acid conjugates, Bioconj. Chem. 16, 471-489.) These hydrazide modified nucleic acids are then attached to a probe, nanoparticle, surface, etc. using the boronic acid-based linker. See Fig. 27. EXAMPLE 14 Targeting PET Probes. A problem for preparing radiolabeled conjugates for positron emission tomography (PET) use is the short half-life of 18 F, a commonly used emitter. The longer the time required to prepare the conjugate, the less isotope will be available for patient imaging. The present technology can shorten the time to prepare the conjugate, and the reaction is stoichiometric, and the reagents and product are bioorthogonal (to the limits of 18 F radiopharmaceutical pharmacology), so a purification step is not necessary. Click-Chemistry Reactions in Radiopharmaceutical Chemistry: Fast & Easy Introduction of Radiolabels into Biomolecules for In Vivo Imaging. Current Medicinal Chemistry, 2010, 17, 1092-1116. Therefore, 4- 18 F-fluoro-N-(prop-2-ylyl)-benzyamide (Fig. 28) is replaced with 4- 18 F-fluoro- benzoyl hydrazine (Fig. 29). EXAMPLE 15 Carbohydrate labeling Laughlin et al. were able to image glycans in developing zebrafish by the use of click chemistry. Cancer Biother Radiopharm. 2009 June; 24(3): 289-302. In this study, embryonic zebrafish were incubated with an azide-peracetylated N-azidoacetylgalactosamine derivative (Ac4-GalNAz), which was then reacted with a difluorinated cyclooctyne attached to a dye. See Fig. 30. A semicarbazide derivative of galactosamine is used in place of Ac4-GalNAz, as shown in Figs. 31A and 31B.
