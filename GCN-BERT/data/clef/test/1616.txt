CIGARETTE FILTER IMPROVEMENTS FIELD OF THE iNVEMCM This invention relates to tobacco products. More particularly, although, not exclusively, a product and method is disclosed for Roll- Yoiir-C vn (RYO) filter tip cigarettes, BACKGROIIMD TO THE ίΝΥΕΜΤιΟΝ Cigarettes comprise a generally cylindrical tube shaped structure having a core of finely choppe tobacco leaves snrroonded arid eorjtaifted by wrapper paper . Most commercially mass produced cigarettes also include filter dement.. This is attached or incorporated into the inhalation end of the cigarette so that smoke fsom the op osite burning end is sacked is through said filter prior to be inhaled by the smoker. Such filters typically comprise a porous fibrous core such as cellulose acetate or the like which is smT im e b a covefta of 'Tipping paper". Filters are believed by some to reduce the harmf l effects of the inhaled smoke on health. They may also be used to ^fla our" the smoke, R YQ cigarettes are popular in marry cotaitrie due to lowe government taxes and retail cost, Also government regulations, on nicotine and tar levels do not apply to RYO cigarettes in some countries RYO cigarettes are typically handmade as needed by the user from loose shredded tobacco and specially cut and folded wrapper paper. The b sic proeedirfe is to arrange a measured amount of tobacco in a line e venly along the central longitudinal fold of a rectangular wrapper paper, The paper is then roiled into a tube containing th tobacco core and sealed by licking a strip of dr glue or gum n situ along longitudinal edge of th paper, la order to gain the benefit of filterinf suitable cylindrical filter elements can be purchased separately and positioned at one end of the paper before rolling and sealing. While such atraiigemeiii in theory should provide a useable RYO filter cigarette in practice the arrangement often does not work, If for example the cigarette is rolled too loosely or the filter sticks to the smoker's lip it can detach: and pull out from the paper tube. Once detached it is difficult to reassemble back into the cigarette with the result that the cigarette is either discarded or consumed without the benefits of filteration. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is therefore an object of the invention to ameliorate the aforementioned disadvantages and accordingly a cigarette wrapper paper is disclosed for makin a RYO filter cigarette, said wrapper paper having attachment means for securing a filter i place during rollin whereby said filter does not become detached during subsequen smoking of said cigarette. In accordance with another aspect of the in vention a cigarette filter is disclosed having attachment means for seeuremsnt to a cigarette wrapper paper during rolling whereby said filter does not become detached during subsequent smoking of said ci garette In accordance with another aspect of the in venison apparatus for making a RYO filter cigarette is disclosed, said apparatus including a cigarette wrapper paper and a cigarette filter element adapted for use with said wrapper paper arid attachment means associated with said filter and/or wrapper paper whereby during rolling of said cigarette when the filter is placed in contact with said wrapper paper said f lter is secured in place against dislodgemem during subsequent, smoking of the cigarette. In another aspect the invention discloses a method of making a R YO filter cigarette using the aforementioned apparatus, said method including the steps of:- - positiofiiag said filter element at one end of said wrapper paper in a manner whereby said attachment means between the filter and paper is acti vated, » arrang kg a measured line of tobacco along a fold of said cigarette wrapper paper, - rolling the wrapper paper into a tube containi ng a core of said tobacco with said filler at one end thereof, and - sealing said tnbe by activating strip of glue or gum along an edge of said wrapper paper. In another aspect the invention discloses a R .YD filter cigarette made i accordance with the aforesaid method. Preferably but not essentially said attachment means may comprise an area of adhesive applied to. said wrapper paper and/or said filter. in one preferred for of the invention said adhesive may be a self-adhesive contact glue. Alternatively said adhesive may be moisture activated ~ for example by licking. Preferably the adhesive glue area may comprise a strip located along or adjacent the centre fold of the wrapper paper. in another preferred form of the invention the adhesive strip, in addition to or as an alternative to being loeated on said wrapper paper, may be located on the outside surface of said fitter. ϊη another preferred form said attachment means may include a mechanical engagement, means between said wrapper paper and filter element. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Ctirrently preferred forms of the invention will now he described with reference to the attached drawings in which :- Fignre 1 is a schematic perspective view of a wrapper pape for a RYO filter cigarette. Figure 2 is a schematic perspecti ve view of a filter element for us wit the wrapper paper of figure 1 , Figure 3 is a schematic perspective view of the wrapper paper of figure 1 with the tobacco and filter element m place before rolling. Figure 4 is schematic perspective view of a finished RYO filter cigarette rolled in accordance with the invention. Figure 5 shows an additional embodiment of a filter with alternative glue pattern, and Figure 6 sho ws a schematic perspective view of another shape configuration for the glue strip on the wrapper paper. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED BMBODIMgNTS Referring first to figures 1 to 3 there is a R YO cigarette wrapper paper indicated generally as I , The paper is rectangular with a central longitudinal fold line 2 along its length, in accordanc with this described embodiment of the invention a strip 3 of dry or self-adhesive contact glue or gum is located, djacent an end 4 of the paper in the area of the fold line 2. Although the m sition is not so limited with this emb diment the size of the adhesive strip may be of the order of about 3 mm by about 15mm, When manually roll ing a cigarette cylindrical filler element 4A of cellulose acetate or the like is placed against the adhesive glue strip 3 as best shown in figures 2 and 3. A measured amount of shredded tobacco 5 is then arranged in a line along the fold 2 between the igmtshle end 6 of the cigarette paper and the inner end 6 A of the filter before the paper is rolled and sealed in the conventional manner b licking .glue strip 7 along a longitudinal edge 8 of said paper, With the finished cigarette 8A as shown in figure 4 the filter element 4 A is secured in place w thin, the cigarette tube by the adhesive gke 3 and is thereby resistant to inadvertent detachment during smoking, Preferably, although not essentially , the outside surface of the filter itself as shown in figure 2 may have a self-adhesive contact or dry glne strip applied to it This may be in additio to or as an alternative to the adhesive glue strip 3 on the wrapper paper, it is to be noted that invention is not limited to any particular shape> dimensions, conSguration or placement for this glne strip on the filter as these can vary according to design preference, The design of the gl e strip may for example extend to other shapes and configurations such a circumferential band 10 of any suitable width X as shown in figures 5, The invention is also not limited to any particular configuration- shape or placement of the glue strip on the wrapper paper which again can vary according to design preference, It may for example extend the full length of the paper as shown at 1 1 in figure 6. In accordance with a further mbodiment of the invention mechanical engagement means (not shown) suc as tongue and slot engagement, a ta ered or cone shape for the filter or a peel off sticker arrangement may also be used in. addition to or as an alternative to the adhesive or glue strips referred to earlier. it will thus be appreciated that this invention at least in the form of the embodiments disclosed provides a novel and useful improvement in the structure of R YC) filter cigarettes. Clearly however the exam les disclosed are only the currently preferred forms of the invention and a wide range of modifications may be made which would be apparent to a person skilled i the art. For example the size, shape and configuration of the wrapper paper, and filter, the material of which the filter is made and the type, shape, dimensions and placement of the adhesi ve area(s) on the wrapper paper ami/or filter may all be changed according to design preference or following further development work by the inventor.
