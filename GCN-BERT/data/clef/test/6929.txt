EXAMPLE 5
Preparation of (S)-4-((1-(8-chloro-1-oxo-2-phenyl-1,2-dihydroisoquinoline-3-yl)ethyl)amino)pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine-5(8H)-one
Step 1: Preparation of (S)-3-(1-((5-acetyl-6-((4-methoxybenzyl)amino)pyrimidine-4-yl)amino)ethyl)-8-chloro-2-phenylisoquinoline-1(2H)-one
292 mg (1.0 mmol, 1 equivalent) of 1-(4-chloro-6-((4-methoxybenzyl)amino)pyrimidine-5-yl)ethane-1-one prepared in step 4 of Example 1 and (S)-3-(1-aminoethyl)-8-chloro-2-phenylisoquinoline-1(2H)-one (1.1 equivalent) were dissolved in 10 mL of anhydrous dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), to which diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA) (3 equivalent) was added, followed by stirring at 80Â° C. for 10 hours. Ethyl acetate and water was added to the reaction mixture, followed by extraction. The extracted organic layer was dried (Na2SO4), filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was separated by column chromatography (SiO2, eluent: hexane/ethyl acetate, 3/1-hexane/ethyl acetate, 1/1) to give 482 mg of the target compound (S)-3-(1-((5-acetyl-6-((4-methoxybenzyl)amino)pyrimidine-4-yl)amino)ethyl)-8-chloro-2-phenylisoquinoline-1(2H)-one as a white solid (0.87 mmol, yield: 87%).
