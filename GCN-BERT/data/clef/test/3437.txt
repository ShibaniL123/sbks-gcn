Example Compound 54
2-((3,5-dimethyl-1-phenyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)amino)-2-oxoethyl 2-(2-methoxyphenyl)acetate
2-(2-methoxyphenyl)acetic acid (25.3 mg, 0.1 mmol) was dissolved in dry DCM (3 mL), cooled to 0 Â°C and added DCC (30.4 mg, 0.1 mmol) and DMAP (3.7 mg, 0.03 mmol) followed by N-(3,5-dimethyl-1-phenyl-1 H-pyrazol-4-yl)-2-hydroxyacetamide (35.3 mg, 0.1 mmol), synthesized as reported in Example 1. The obtained suspension was filtered over cotton to remove the bulk of DCU and purified by column chromatography (75% EtOAc in PE) to yield 56 mg of the title compound (99%).
