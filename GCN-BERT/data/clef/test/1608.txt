DESCRIPTION MATERIALS AND METHODS FOR THE TREATMENT OF LATENT VIRAL INFECTION CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Serial No. 61/973,995, filed April 2, 2014, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety, including all figures, tables and amino acid or nucleic acid sequences. This invention was made with government support under R01 AI097376 awarded by National Institutes of Health. The government has certain rights in the invention. The Sequence Listing for this application is labeled "Seq-List.txt" which was created on April 2, 2015 and is 13 KB. The entire contents of the sequence listing is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) is a human pathogen that efficiently establishes lifelong infections that can manifest as a variety of disease states that vary depending on the host and the site of infection. These diseases include orolabial herpes, presenting with the recurrence of painful and psychologically distressing cold sores around the lips, and herpes keratitis, in which recurrence in the eye results in inevitable loss of vision, making HSV-1 the leading cause of infectious blindness in the developed world. Between 50-90% of adults in the U.S. are estimated to be infected with HSV-1, with incidence approaching 100% for the subpopulation over the age of 60. While the majority of hosts are asymptomatic, viral shedding occurs spontaneously, resulting in propagation of infection. Similar to HSV-1, HSV-2 also establishes a lifelong infection, with a greater prevalence for recurrence at the genital mucosa. Following local replication at the site of primary infection with either virus, the virus enters into the nervous system via sensory nerve termini. Once in the nuclei of sensory ganglia neurons, the -153 kb HSV-1 double stranded linear DNA genome enters into a closed circular episomal form. The episome rapidly becomes associated with cellular histones that largely bear epigenetic modifications associated with transcriptional repression, resulting in the transcriptional inactivity of lytic genes that is the hallmark of latency. However, in defined regions of the genome, histones are associated with permissive histone modifications, which allow for accessibility to the DNA, and low levels of transcription. This transcription permits the accumulation of the only transcript abundantly expressed during latency, the latency-associated transcript (LAT), as well as a number of HSV-1 encoded microRNAs (miRNAs). Together, these transcripts are thought to play a role in the regulation of viral latency and reactivation. Spontaneously, and/or in response to a multitude of stressors, the HSV-1 episome undergoes reactivation, resulting in a lytic cascade of gene expression, replication of the viral genome, and subsequent egress of infectious virions. Antivirals exist with broad activity against herpesvirus DNA replication, and these present the U.S. with an economic burden of over $500,000,000 annually. Importantly, these antivirals only limit the duration of reactivation events when used reactively, or limit the frequency of reactivation events when used proactively, while neither impacting latent infection nor allowing for a reduction/cure of the viral burden. HSV can develop resistance to commonly used antivirals such as acyclovir, and HSV is also not amenable to traditional vaccination schemes. Alternative chemotherapeutic treatments for latent infection are impeded by the absence of protein targets produced by the quiescent virus. This disclosure seeks to alleviate these issues by providing distinct approaches to treat and/or cure latent viral infections, such as HSV-1 and HSV-2 infections, by significantly reducing or eliminating the latent viral load and thus reducing or eliminating recurrent disease. While these approaches are described using HSV-1 as a model pathogen in this application (owing to its simpler laboratory manipulation), nearly identical methods are adaptable to other viruses, such as HSV-2, other neurotropic herpes viruses (including Varicella zoster virus (VZV), the causative agent of shingles and post-herpetic neuralgia) and other viruses. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION A first aspect of the invention relates to materials and methods of using synthetic Transcription activator-like (TAL) binding domains that include "effector" domains. In the case of TAL effector nucleases (TALENs), the effector domain is the DNA cleavage domain from an endonuclease (such as Fokl), which requires dimerization for activity. To utilize TALEN-mediated DNA cleavage, a pair of TALEN are designed to bind at sequences flanking a chosen target site such that the endonuclease domains (Fokl domains for example) of each TALEN meet, dimerize, and catalyze cleavage at the desired target site. Following cleavage, the resulting double-strand break (DSB) can be repaired via non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). NHEJ is commonly imperfect, resulting in a mutation at the site of cleavage. Alternatively, if NHEJ repairs the DSB perfectly, the product will be reiteratively cleaved by the TALENs until some form of mutation is generated. When such mutations occur in important coding regions of the target genome, the result is a loss-of-function mutation of the relevant gene. In some circumstances, cleavage of episomes can result in destabilization and loss of the DNA. A second aspect of the invention provides materials and methods for the treatment of latent viral infections by fusing TAL to an effector domain comprising a transcriptional activation domain (TALTADs), such as the strongly transactivating domain found in the HSV-1 VP 16 protein. When such domains are fused to TAL DNA-binding components, effectors are targeted to the 5' promoter regions of particular genes. The resulting TAL-VP16 fusion protein acts to drive transcription from that gene. Other viral transactivating domains can also be used in this aspect of the invention for the treatment of different viral diseases. A third aspect of the invention relates to materials and methods for the cleavage of viral nucleic acids, such as HSV-1 episomes in vivo and in vitro) that utilize RNA guided dsDNA endonuclease (RGN), such as a Type II CRISPR/Cas system. As an example, Cas9, a bacterial RNA guided dsDNA endonuclease (RGN), can be directed to bind and cleave specific DNA sequences using a short guide RNA (gRNA) expressed in trans. In this aspect of the invention, the RGN, such as a Type II CRISPR/Cas, is packaged in an AAV vector. RGN, such as a II CRISPR/Cas9, can be expressed by using small promoters to drive expression. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS The patent or application file contains at least one drawing executed in color. Copies of this patent or patent application publication, with color drawing(s), will be provided by the Office upon request and payment of the necessary fee. Fig. 1. Schematic of the HSV-1 genome and targeted regions. The HSV-1 DNA genome is -153 kb in length and consists of terminal repeats (TRs), internal repeats (IRs) and unique long (UL) and unique short (Us) segments (upper panel). The only region that is transcriptionally active, and hence accessible, in latently infected cells is adjacent to the viral LAT gene. LAT is in turn antisense to the ICPO immediate early gene and adjacent to ICPO. The TALENs and NMCas9 RGN constructs designed so far are able to cleave the HSV-1 genome in the exonic region of ICPO and ICP4, and within the miR-H6/miR-Hl microRNA stem- loop. TALE-VP16 fusions are able to bind and activate either the ICPO or ICP4 promoter. Figs. 2A-2C. Cleavage of HSV-1 DNA.

B) Detection of GFP expression in cells co-transfected with an indicator construct (control of HSV-1 based) and a TALEN pair (control or HSV-1 specific). Each TALEN is able to block expression of GFP from the cognate target. C) Western analysis of cells co-transfected with the Rev-GFP indicator and TALENs. The miR-Hl HSV-1 target and both ICPO targets are specifically cleaved by their cognate TALENs, resulting in loss of protein expression. Figs. 3A-3B.

B) Similar to panel A, but measuring virus progeny production. Fig. 4. ChlP-seq analysis for the heterochromatin mark H3K27triMe on the HSV-1 latent genome. Sheared chromatin from mice latently infected with either 17+ (wt) or 17APst (LAT null mutant) was immunoprecipitated with antibody against H3K27triMe. The isolated DNA was enriched for HSV-1 sequences using a custom enrichment bead array (Agilent SureSelect) and a library constructed and amplified for Illumina sequencing. These analyses reveal significant regions that are under-enriched in heterochromatin during latency. These include the promoter and 5' region of the LAT, as well as a large portion of the ICP4 CDS. Figs. 5A-5B. Specific activation of the ICPO or ICP4 promoter by TALE-VP16 fusions. Indicator constructs were generated that place either the HSV-1 ICPO or ICP4 promoter 5 ' to the Firefly luciferase (Flue) indicator gene and these were then co-transfected into 293T cells with ICPO-TALE-VP 16 or ICP4-TALE-VP 16 fusion protein expression plasmids. At 24 hours, Flue activity was determined and normalized to an internal control plasmid encoding Renilla luciferase. Figs. 6A-6B. RGN cleavage results in episome elimination from culture.

The U6 Pol III promoter is used to drive gRNA expression. ITR: Inverted Terminal Repeat. Figs. 9A-9E. NMCas9-specific gRNAs substantially reduce the frequency of GFP positive cells as shown by FACS. Cells were co-transfected with the Rev-target - eGFP reporter construct depicted in Figure 7B with a gRNA specific target. Shown in A is a positive control gRNA, in B and C are candidate gRNAs targeting HSV-1 ICPO and ICP4, showing efficient knockdown of eGFP expression. This assay is quantitative and ideal to screen gRNAs for cleavage efficiency. In panels D and E, Western analysis is used to demonstrate NMCas9 expression by FLAG Western (upper panel) as well as gRNA-specific reductions in the expression level of the episome derived Rev:GFP fusion protein (lower panel), which reflects a reduction in the level of the targeted viral episome. The gRNAs used in panel D are bacterial gRNAs that act here as positive controls. Fig. 10. Map of the HSV-1 Genome with TALEN Targets Marked. HSV-1 repeat regions are shown enlarged, including maps of targeted HSV-1 proteins. Characterized functional domains of ICP4 are labeled. Targets of TALEN s are marked by a red 'X'. Fig. 11. Specificity of TALEN target pairs. In cases where the sequence in the firefly luciferase gene is recognized by the TALEN pair in a given reaction (column identified as "2") for each TALEN pair, successful cleavage and subsequent repair of the firefly luciferase gene results in increased relative luciferase signal (y-axis, arbitrary units) compared to wells transfected with a given reporter alone (column identified as "1") for each TALEN pair. Each ICP4-targeted TALEN pair was also mixed in a reaction containing an ICPO target in the firefly luciferase gene to assay for off-target amplication of luciferase (column identified as "4") for each TALEN pair compared to background levels of the ICPO target reporter (column identified as "3") for each TALEN pair. TALEN pairs used in subsequent assays are labeled; other data sets are for ICP4-targeted TALEN pairs with alternative RVD composition. Fig. 12. Antiviral Action of HSVl-targeted TALENs. Fluorescence microscopy 24 hours after transfection revealed a lower estimate of near 30% transfection efficiency. 48 hours after transfection, cells were infected with HSV-1 strain 17syn+ at an MOI of 1.12 hours after infection, cells and medium were harvested from each well, subjected to two freeze/thaw cycles, and concentration of infectious virus was determined via plaque assay. Numbers of plaques for each triplicate are shown. Relative to control wells, cells containing either GG-TALEN pair produced substantially fewer infectious virions. DETAILED DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION The terms "nucleic acid," "polynucleotide," and "oligonucleotide" (and grammatical variants thereof) are used interchangeably and refer to a deoxyribonucleotide or ribonucleotide polymer, in linear or circular conformation, and in either single- or double- stranded form. For the purposes of the present disclosure, these polymers are not limited in length. Analogs and/or nucleotides that are modified in the base, sugar and/or phosphate moieties (e.g., phosphorothioate backbones) of natural nucleotides may be included in the polymers. Analogs will have the same base-pairing specificity as occurs in nature (an analog of G will base-pair with C). The terms "polypeptide," "peptide" and "protein" (and grammatical variants thereof) are used interchangeably to refer to a polymer of amino acid residues. The term also applies to amino acid polymers in which one or more amino acids are chemical analogues or modified derivatives of corresponding naturally-occurring amino acids. "Binding" and grammatical variants thereof (e.g., bind, binds, bound, etc.) refers to a sequence-specific, non-covalent interaction between macromolecules (e.g., between a protein (e.g., a TAL) and a nucleic acid or an antibody with its cognate antigen/epitope). A "binding protein" (and grammatical variants thereof) is a protein that is able to bind non-covalently to another molecule. A binding protein can bind to, for example, a DNA molecule (a DNA-binding protein), an RNA molecule (an RNA-binding protein) and/or a protein molecule (a protein-binding protein). In the case of a protein-binding protein, it can bind to itself (to form homodimers, homotrimers, etc.) and/or it can bind to one or more molecules of a different protein or proteins. A binding protein can have more than one type of binding activity. For example, zinc finger proteins have DNA-binding, RNA-binding and protein-binding activity. A polypeptide having an activity on nucleic acids is defined as an "effector domain(s)" herein. Effector domains can be modified by being combined with a TAL as described herein in order to cause an effect at a target site within the genome of an organism that is bound by the TAL. Examples of such polypeptides include, and are not limited to, transcription activator (also referred to as transcription activator domain(s); TAD(S)) and repressor proteins, nucleases, topoisomerases, ligases, integrases, recombinases, resolvases, methylases, acetylases, demethylases, deacetylases, and any other polypeptide capable of modifying DNA or R A. In certain preferred embodiments, the polypeptides combined with a TAL are nucleases such as Mmel, Colicin-E7 (CEA7 ECOLX), EndA, Endo I (END1 ECOLI), Human Endo G (NUCG HUMAN), Bovine Endo G (NUCG BOVIN), R.HinPI I, 1-Basl, I- Bmol, 1-Hmul, 1-Tev-l, 1-Tevll, 1-Tevlll, 1-Twol, R.Mspl, R.Mval, NucA, NucM, Vvn, Vvn_CLS, Staphylococcal nuclease (NUC_STAAU), Staphylococcal nuclease (NUC STAHY), Micrococcal nuclease (NUC SHIFL), Endonuclease yncB, Endodeoxyribonuclease I (ENRN BPT7), Metnase, Nb.BsrDI, BsrDI A, Nt.BspD61 (R.BspD61 large subunit), ss.BspD61 (R.BspD61 small subunit), R.PIel, Mlyl, Alwl, Mval2691, Bsrl, Bsml, Nb.BtsCI, Nt.BtsCI, RlBtsl, R2.Btsl, BbvCI subunit 1, BbvCI subunit 2, BpulOI alpha subunit, BpulOI beta subunit, Bmrl, Bfil, 1-Crel, hExol (EX01JHUMAN), Yeast Exol (EX01 YEAST), E.coli Exol, Human TREX2, Mouse TREXl, Human TREX1, Bovine TREXl, Rat TREXl, Human DNA2, Yeast DNA2 (DNA2 YEAST), VP 16, RBBP8 and Type IIS nucleases like Fok-I. In certain preferred embodiments, the nuclease is Fok-I. Trans-activating domains (TAD(S)) include, and are not limited to, polypeptides containing a nine-amino-acid transactivation domain (9aaTAD) that defines a novel domain common to a large superfamily of eukaryotic transcription factors. Non-limiting examples of such eukaryotic transcription factors include p53 (also known as cellular tumor antigen p53, phosphoprotein p53, or tumor suppressor p53 which is encoded by the TP53 gene) or a fragment of p53 comprising amino acids 1-42, NF AT (Nuclear factor of activated T- cells), NF-KB (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells), El A (adenovirus transcriptional activator) and VP 16 (a-TIF (also known as Trans Inducing Factor). Targeting effector molecules (TALENS and TAL TADS). Transcription activatorlike (TAL) binding domains are natively expressed by bacteria of the Xanthomonas genus and utilize a protein-DNA interaction mediated by a unique DNA-binding motif that is an array of highly conserved 34-amino acid repeats, where each of the repeats mediates binding to a single nucleotide base pair. The targeted base pair is determined by the identity of the 12th and 13th amino acid in each repeat. Owing to the relationship between the amino acid sequence of the TAL binding domain and the DNA target sequence, synthetic TAL effectors with permutated repeats have been developed with exquisite specificity towards target genes. TAL binding domains can be "engineered" to bind to a predetermined nucleotide sequence, Non- limiting examples of methods for engineering DNA-binding proteins are design and selection. A designed DNA binding protein is a protein not occurring in nature whose design/composition results principally from rational criteria. Methods of engineering TAL and other nucleic acid binding domains, such as zinc finger proteins, to bind a predetermined nucleic acid sequence are known in the art (see, for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 6,140,081; 6,453,242; and 6,534,261; see also WO 98/53058; WO 98/53059; WO 98/53060; WO 02/016536 and WO 03/016496 and U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 20110301073, each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety for such purposes). TAL binding domains (synthetic or engineered) effectors can include various "effector domains" (as discussed above). In the case where a TAL is associated with an nuclease, the TAL effector is referred to as a TALEN. Thus, the effector domain can be any of the nucleases (e.g., an endonuclease) discussed above. In certain embodiments, the nuclease/endonuclease attached to the TAL can be a nuclease/endonuclease that requires dimerization for activity (e.g., Fok-I) or can be an nuclease/endonuclease that does not require dimerization for activity. To utilize TALEN-mediated DNA cleavage with an endonuclease that requires dimerization for activity, a pair of TALENs are designed to bind at sequences flanking a chosen target site such that the endonuclease domains of each TALEN meet, dimerize, and catalyze cleavage at the desired target site. An exemplary endonuclease in this aspect of the invention is Fok-I. In other embodiments, engineered nucleases can be used to form a TALEN pair. In these embodiments, the nucleases have been modified to form obligate heterodimers with nuclease. Examples of such nucleases can be found in U.S. Patent Publication Nos. 2005/0064474, 2007/0218528, 2008/0131962 and 2011/0201055, each of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Exemplary amino acid sequences that provide binding specificity to target genes within TAL are provided below (in single letter amino acid code). All the coordinates are chosen out of the GenBank genomic sequence of the HSV-1 strain 17syn+ and this sequence can be accessed on GenBank using the accession number NC 001806 (which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety). TAL binding domains can be assembled using the REAL TALEN Assembly Kit or the Voytas Golden Gate Assembly Kit. The target coordinates for each TAL fusion protein are shown in the HSV-1 genome. Since ICPO and ICP4 each occur twice in the viral genome, the genes are coded on one DNA strand in one direction (+, sense) and in the other second gene is coded on the other DNA strand in an opposing direction (-, antisense).

A second possible effector domain for synthetic TAL effectors is a transcriptional activation domain, such as the strongly transactivating domain VP 16 protein. These synthetic TAL effectors are referred to as TALTAD(s). TALTAD(s) are targeted to the 5' promoter regions of a particular target gene and the resulting fusion protein (e.g., TALE-VP16) acts to drive transcription from that gene. Such TAL effectors can be used in combination with antiviral chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of the viral infection. Non-limiting examples of anti-viral agents include trifluordine, docosanol, acyclovir, famciclovir, ganciclovir, penciclovir and valacyclovir. In certain embodiments of methods for targeted alteration of a sequence in a region of interest in viral nucleic acids, either episomal or incorporated into the genome, of the subject to be treated. Any of the methods described herein can be used for partial or complete inactivation of one or more viral target sequences in a cell. In addition these methods may be directed to mutate the target protein such that it may be expressed but is non-functional and could actively interfere with the activity of other non-mutated viral proteins present in that cell (dominant-negative mutation). The term "sequence" (and grammatical variants thereof) refers to a nucleotide sequence of any length, which can be DNA or RNA. The nucleotide sequence can be linear, circular (e.g., episomal) or branched and can be either single-stranded or double stranded. An "episome" is a replicating nucleic acid, nucleoprotein complex or other structure comprising a nucleic acid that is not part of the chromosomal karyotype of a cell. Examples of episomes include plasmids and certain viral genomes. A "target site" or "target sequence" (and grammatical variants thereof) is a nucleic acid sequence that defines a portion of a nucleic acid to which a binding molecule will bind, provided sufficient conditions for binding exist. In various embodiments, the target sequences can be viral genes (also referred to as "a target gene" or "target genes") that are associated with transcriptional activation of latent viruses within a cell. Non-limiting examples of such genes include ICP27, ICPO and ICP4 for HSV-1 and HSV-2. Other target sequences include, and are not limited to, genes associated with replication of the viral genome (e.g., UL5, UL7, etc.), polymerases (e.g., UL30) and genes associated with processing and packaging of viral DNA (e.g., UL25) or producing viral RNAs during latency. Similar target sequences can be identified in other viruses causing latent infections from genomes found in databases such as EMBL or GenBank. An "exogenous" molecule is a molecule that is not normally present in a cell, but can be introduced into a cell by one or more genetic, biochemical or other methods. "Normal presence in the cell" is determined with respect to the particular developmental stage and environmental conditions of the cell. An exogenous molecule can be, among other things, a viral protein produced by a virus in either its latent state or while causing active infection. By contrast, an "endogenous" molecule is one that is normally present in a particular cell at a particular developmental stage under particular environmental conditions. For example, an endogenous nucleic acid can comprise a chromosome, the genome of a mitochondrion, chloroplast or other organelle, or a naturally-occurring episomal nucleic acid. Additional endogenous molecules can include proteins, for example, transcription factors and enzymes. A "fusion molecule" or "fusion protein" (and grammatical variants thereof) is a molecule in which two or more subunit molecules are linked, preferably covalently. The subunit molecules can be the same chemical type of molecule (e.g., two or more proteins) or can be different chemical types of molecules (e.g., a nucleic acid and a protein). Examples of the first type of fusion molecule include, but are not limited to, TALEN or TALTAD fusion proteins. Expression of a fusion protein in a cell can result from delivery of the fusion protein to the cell or by delivery of a polynucleotide encoding the fusion protein to a cell, wherein the polynucleotide is transcribed, and the transcript is translated, to generate the fusion protein. Methods for polynucleotide and polypeptide delivery to cells are presented elsewhere in this disclosure. "Modulation" of gene expression refers to a change in the activity of a gene. Modulation of expression can include, but is not limited to, gene activation and gene repression. "Gene inactivation" refers to any reduction in gene expression as compared to a cell that does not include TALEN, TALTAD or other TAL binding domain fused to an effector domain as described herein. "Gene activation" refers to any increase in gene expression as compared to a cell that does not include TALEN, TALTAD or other TAL binding domain fused to an effector domain as described herein. Thus, gene activation/inactivation may be partial or complete. Gene activation or inactivation can also be modulated by a RGN as described herein. A "region of interest" is any region of cellular chromatin, such as, for example, a gene or a non-coding sequence within or adjacent to a gene, in which it is desirable to bind a TAL binding domain fused to an effector domain as described herein (or a RGN). Binding can be for the purposes of targeted DNA cleavage and/or targeted delivery of an effector domain as described herein. A region of interest can be present in a chromosome, an episome, an organellar genome (e.g., mitochondrial, chloroplast), or an infecting viral genome, for example. A region of interest can be within the coding region of a gene, within transcribed non-coding regions such as, for example, leader sequences, trailer sequences or introns, or within non-transcribed regions, either upstream or downstream of the coding region (e.g., a promoter upstream of a coding region). A region of interest can be as small as a single nucleotide pair or up to 2,000 nucleotide pairs in length, or any integral value of nucleotide pairs. The terms "operatively linked" or "operably linked" can be used interchangeably with reference to a juxtaposition of two or more components (such as sequence elements), in which the components are arranged such that both components function normally and allow the possibility that at least one of the components can mediate a function that is exerted upon at least one of the other components. By way of illustration, a transcriptional regulatory sequence, such as a promoter, is operatively linked to a coding sequence if the transcriptional regulatory sequence controls the level of transcription of the coding sequence in response to the presence or absence of one or more transcriptional regulatory factors. With respect to fusion polypeptides, the term "operatively linked" can refer to the fact that each of the components performs the same function in linkage to the other component as it would if it were not so linked. For example, with respect to a fusion protein comprising a TAL binding domain fused to an effector domain polypeptide the individual elements of the fusion protein are in operative linkage if, in the fusion protein, the TAL binding domain is able to bind its target site and/or its binding site, while the effector domain able to mediate its effect on gene expression (e.g., up-regulation of gene expression by a transcription activation factor, cleavage of a nucleic acid sequence by a nuclease or methylation of a nucleic acid sequence or nucleotide). A "functional fragment" of a protein, polypeptide or nucleic acid is a protein, polypeptide or nucleic acid whose sequence is not identical to the full-length protein, polypeptide or nucleic acid, yet retains the same function as the full-length protein, polypeptide or nucleic acid. A functional fragment can possess more, fewer, or the same number of residues as the corresponding native molecule, and/or can contain one or more amino acid or nucleotide substitutions. Methods for determining the function of a nucleic acid (e.g., coding function, ability to hybridize to another nucleic acid) are well-known in the art. Similarly, methods for determining protein function are well-known. For example, the DNA- binding function of a polypeptide can be determined, for example, by filter-binding, electrophoretic mobility- shift, or immunoprecipitation assays. DNA cleavage can be assayed by gel electrophoresis or other methods known in the art. The CRISPR/Cas System The Type II CRISPR (exemplified by Cas9) is a well characterized system and carries out targeted DNA double-strand break in four sequential steps. First, two non-coding RNA, the pre-crRNA array and tracrRNA, are transcribed from the CRISPR locus. Second, tracrRNA hybridizes to the repeat regions of the pre-crRNA and mediates the processing of pre-crRNA into mature crRNAs containing individual spacer sequences. Third, the mature crRNA:tracrRNA complex directs Cas9 to the target DNA via Watson-Crick base-pairing between the spacer on the crRNA and the protospacer on the target DNA next to the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM), an additional requirement for target recognition. Finally, Cas9 mediates cleavage of target DNA to create a double-stranded break within the protospacer. In type II CRISPR/Cas systems, crRNAs are produced using a different mechanism where a trans-activating RNA (tracrRNA) complementary to repeat sequences in the pre- crRNA, triggers processing by a double strand-specific RNase III in the presence of the Cas9 protein. Cas9 is then able to cleave a target DNA that is complementary to the mature crRNA however cleavage by Cas 9 is dependent both upon base-pairing between the crRNA and the target DNA, and on the presence of a short motif in the crRNA referred to as the PAM sequence (protospacer adjacent motif) (see Qi et al. (2013) Cell 152: 1173). In addition, the tracrRNA must also be present as it base pairs with the crRNA at its 3' end, and this association triggers Cas9 activity. Type II CRISPR/Cas systems can be delivered to target sites using guide RNA. These guide RNA are referred to as "single-guide RNA" (gRNA) that contain the hairpin normally formed by the annealing of the crRNA and the tracrR A. In certain embodiments, Cas protein may be a "functional derivative" of a naturally occurring Cas protein. A "functional derivative" of a native sequence polypeptide is a compound having a qualitative biological property in common with a native sequence polypeptide. "Functional derivatives" include, but are not limited to, fragments of a native sequence and derivatives of a native sequence polypeptide and its fragments, provided that they have a biological activity in common with a corresponding native sequence polypeptide. A biological activity contemplated herein is the ability of the functional derivative to hydrolyze a DNA substrate into fragments. The term "derivative" encompasses both amino acid sequence variants of polypeptide, covalent modifications, and fusions thereof. Examples of guide sequences for HSV-1 are provided below: ICP4-G1 GCGGTGGCCGGCCGCGACGCCACG (SEQ ID NO : 8 ) ; Target (gRNA + PAM) GCGGTGGCCGGCCGCGACGCCACGGGCCGCTT (SEQ ID NO: 9); ICP4-G2 GCCGCGGCCGGAGGGACCCGCGGG (SEQ ID NO:10); Target (gRNA + PAM) CCCGCGGCCGGAGGGACCCGCGGGCCCCGCTT (SEQ ID NO: 11); ICP4-G3 GGGGGGCCCTGCCGCCGGCGCCGC (SEQ ID NO:12); Target (gRNA + PAM) CGGGGGCCCTGCCGCCGGCGCCGCCCGGGATT (SEQ ID NO: 13); ICP0-G1 GGGGTCAGGTACCGCGGGGCGAAC (SEQ ID NO:14); Target (gRNA + PAM) AGGGTCAGGTACCGCGGGGCGAACCGCTGATT (SEQ ID NO: 15); ICP0-G2 GGCGTCACGCCCACTATCAGGTAC (SEQ ID NO: 16); Target (gRNA + PAM) GGCGTCACGCCCACTATCAGGTACACCAGCTT (SEQ ID NO:17) . The term "Cas polypeptide" encompasses a full-length Cas polypeptide, an enzymatically active fragment of a Cas polypeptide, and enzymatically active derivatives of a Cas polypeptide or fragment thereof. Suitable derivatives of a Cas polypeptide or a fragment thereof include but are not limited to mutants, fusions, covalent modifications of Cas protein or a fragment thereof. Cas proteins and Cas polypeptides may be obtainable from a cell or synthesized chemically or by a combination of these two procedures. The cell may be a cell that naturally produces Cas protein, or a cell that naturally produces Cas protein and is genetically engineered to produce the endogenous Cas protein at a higher expression level or to produce a Cas protein from an exogenously introduced nucleic acid, which nucleic acid encodes a Cas that is same or different from the endogenous Cas. In some case, the cell does not naturally produce Cas protein and is genetically engineered to produce a Cas protein. The CRISPR/Cas system can also be used to inhibit gene expression. For example, a catalytically inactive Cas9 (i.e., a Cas9 lacking endonuclease activity) generates a DNA recognition complex that can specifically interfere with transcriptional elongation, RNA polymerase binding, or transcription factor binding when co-expressed with a guide RNA,. This system, called CRISPR interference (CRISPRi), can efficiently repress expression of targeted genes. Additionally, Cas proteins have been developed which comprise mutations in their cleavage domains to render them incapable of inducing a DSB, and instead introduce a nick into the target DNA ("Cas9 nicking enzyme"). A polynucleotide can be introduced into a cell as part of a vector molecule having additional sequences such as, for example, replication origins, promoters and genes encoding antibiotic resistance or other marker genes. Marker genes include, but are not limited to, sequences encoding proteins that mediate antibiotic resistance (e.g., ampicillin resistance, neomycin resistance, G418 resistance, puromycin resistance), sequences encoding colored or fluorescent or luminescent proteins (e.g., green fluorescent protein, enhanced green fluorescent protein, red fluorescent protein, luciferase), and proteins which mediate enhanced cell growth and/or gene amplification (e.g., dihydrofolate reductase). Epitope tags include, for example, one or more copies of FLAG, His, myc, Tap, HA or any detectable amino acid sequence. The fusion proteins and CRISPR/Cas systems disclosed herein can be delivered in vivo or ex vivo by any suitable means. For example, any vector system may be used including, but not limited to, plasmid vectors, retroviral vectors, lentiviral vectors, adenovirus vectors, poxvirus vectors; herpesvirus vectors and adeno-associated virus vectors, etc. (see, for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 6,534,261; 6,607,882; 6,824,978; 6,933,113; 6,979,539; 7,013,219; and 7,163,824, each of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety). Furthermore, it will be apparent that any of these vectors may comprise one or more of the sequences needed for treatment. Thus, when one or more fusion protein or CRISPR/Cas system are introduced into the cell, the fusion proteins and/or CRISPR/Cas system may be carried on the same vector or on different vectors. When multiple vectors are used, each vector may comprise a sequence encoding one or fusion protein or CRISPR/Cas system. Conventional viral and non-viral based gene transfer methods can be used to introduce nucleic acids into cells (e.g., mammalian cells) and target tissues. Non-viral vector delivery systems include DNA plasmids, naked nucleic acid, and nucleic acid complexed with a delivery vehicle such as a liposome or poloxamer. Viral vector delivery systems include DNA and RNA viruses, which have either episomal or integrated genomes after delivery to the cell. Methods of non-viral delivery of nucleic acids include electroporation, lipofection, microinjection, biolistics, virosomes, liposomes, immunoliposomes, polycation or lipid:nucleic acid conjugates, naked DNA, artificial virions, and agent-enhanced uptake of DNA. In situations in which transient expression is preferred, adenoviral based systems can be used. Adenoviral based vectors are capable of very high transduction efficiency in many cell types and do not require cell division. With such vectors, high titer and high levels of expression have been obtained. This vector can be produced in large quantities in a relatively simple system. Adeno-associated virus ("AAV") vectors are also used to transduce cells with target nucleic acids, e.g., in the in vitro production of nucleic acids and peptides, and for in vivo and ex vivo gene therapy procedures. Construction of recombinant AAV vectors are generally known to those skilled in the art. Recombinant adeno-associated virus vectors (rAAV) are a promising alternative gene delivery systems based on the defective and nonpathogenic parvovirus adeno-associated type 2 virus. All vectors are derived from a plasmid that retains only the AAV 145 bp inverted terminal repeats flanking the transgene expression cassette. Efficient gene transfer and stable transgene delivery due to integration into the genomes of the transduced cell are key features for this vector system. Other AAV serotypes, including AAV1, AAV3, AAV4, AAV5, AAV6, AAV8, AAV9 and AAVrhlO, and all variants thereof, can also be used in accordance with the present invention. Gene therapy vectors can be delivered in vivo by administration to an individual subject, typically by systemic administration (e.g., intravenous, intraperitoneal, intramuscular, subdermal, or intracranial infusion) or topical application. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers are determined in part by the particular composition being administered, as well as by the particular method used to administer the composition. Accordingly, there is a wide variety of suitable formulations of pharmaceutical compositions available, as described below (see, e.g., Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 17th ed., 1989). Viruses causing latent infections: The majority of viruses that cause latent infections are of the family Herpesviridae. These include, and are not limited to, herpes simplex virus (HSV)-l, HSV-2, varicella zoster virus (VZV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), CMV, human herpesvirus (HHV)-6, HHV-7 and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV/HHV)-8. Other examples of viruses that cause latent infections include JC and BK virus (from the family Polyomaviridae), adenovirus (Adenoviridae) and parvovirus and adeno-associated virus (AAV; Parvoviridae). Thus, the subject disclosure seeks to provide methods of treating such viral infections comprising the administration of fusion proteins or CRISPR/Cas systems disclosed herein. The terms "treat", "treating", "treatment" and various grammatical variants thereof refer to reducing the frequency of reactivation events for treated subjects/patients. In some embodiments, it may be possible to eliminate the recurrence of reactivation episodes entirely. Thus, a further aspect of the invention relates to the treatment of latent viral infections using TALEN(s) or TALTAD(s). Thus, in this aspect of the invention, TALEN(s) are administered to a subject having a latent viral infection in an amount effective to either bind and mutagenize/inactivate (or cause the degradation) of latent viral episomes or integrated viral genomes within a cell) or TALTAD(s) are administered to a subject having a latent viral infection in an amount effective drive the viral episome or integrated viral genome from a dormant state into one of productive replication. Where TALTAD(s) are administered to drive expression of the viral episome or integrated viral genome into productive replication, the subject is also treated with an antiviral drug, such as acyclovir, that blocks viral replication at the stage of viral DNA synthesis. Latent viral infections suitable for treatment in accordance with this disclosure include, but are not limited to, herpes simplex virus (HSV)-l, HSV-2, varicella zoster virus (VZV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), CMV, human herpesvirus (HHV)-6, HHV-7, Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV/HHV)-8, JC and BK virus (from the family Polyomaviridae), adenovirus {Adenoviridae), parvovirus and adeno-associated virus (AAV; Parvoviridae). Yet another aspect of the invention provides methods for treatment of latent viral infections comprising the administration of a Type II Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)/Cas system to cleave latent viral episomes in vivo or in vitro. There are two distinct elements to the (CRiSPR)/Cas system. These are: (1) a guide RNA (gRNA) and (2) an endomic!ease (e.g., a Cas nuclease such as Cas9). The gRNA''Cas9 complex base-pairs with a target sequence in episomal or genomic DNA. Thus, Cas9 is directed to bind and cleave specific DNA sequences using a short gRNA. In certain embodiments, the guide sequences can bind to any desired nucleic acid sequence found in the genome of a virus causing latent infection. For HSV viruses, preferred genes include AAV is a small ssDNA virus that has been extensively employed as a gene therapy vector, owing to advantages including its broad cellular tropism, prolonged transduction in dividing and non-dividing cells, and lack of pathogenicity or affinity for insertional mutagenesis. We are able to generate AAV viral vector stocks with titers of ~1013 infectious units per mL, and we have established a facile and non-invasive AAV delivery protocol enacted via topical delivery at the peripheral epithelium. Through this method, transduction can be achieved in >98% of all sensory neurons in the dorsal root ganglia of mice, or >80% of trigeminal ganglia neurons of rabbits, demonstrating that AAV vectors can strongly transduce within the latent HSV reservoir in either model. Similarly to HSV, AAV uses fast axonal transport to travel with precision from the epithelia to the ganglia, and thus it is expected that this delivery scheme will sidestep both the neutralization of vector by the humoral immune response as well as the need for high vector doses, both of which are limiting problems for AAV-mediated gene therapy efforts against other conditions. Efficient delivery of a transgene to the sensory neurons from the periphery involves the preparation of the peripheral tissue surface and delivery of the AAV vector in such a way that gives the AAV vector access to the nerve termini that are present just under the surface of the epithelium, mucosal or ocular surface. The specific preparation is directed by the type of epithelial surface where the vector is to be applied. For mucosal epithelial surfaces (including but not limited to oral, ocular, anal and genital) the surface is mildly abraded or scratched. This can be accomplished, for example, with either with: 1) a sharp needle (bevel- side facing up) in a cross-hatched pattern with a minimum of 3 cross hatches in each direction, or 2) an emery board or other sand-paper-like surface. For mucosal epithelial surfaces this treatment only penetrates several cell layers to expose the nerve termini. For cornified epithelial surfaces (including but not limited to the skin of the lips, face, buttocks, and non-mucosal genital surfaces), the cornified layers are removed first by abrasion (e.g., with an emery board or sand-paper), and the exposed epithelial surfaces are subsequently scratched or abraded to expose the underlying nerve termini. Following these treatments, the AAV vector is applied and allowed to adsorb for a period of time (e.g., for 20 - 40 minutes). An alternative method of delivering the AAV vector to the nerve termini is to inject a small volume (0.01 - 0.05 mL) of the concentrated vector stock intradermally under the skin, mucosal epithelium or cornea (intrastromal inoculation). The vector is then able to enter sensory neurons and mediate its effect. The following non-limiting embodiments are also provided: 1.

Following are examples which illustrate procedures for practicing the invention. These examples should not be construed as limiting. All percentages are by weight and all solvent mixture proportions are by volume unless otherwise noted. EXAMPLE 1— TALEN/TALTAD ACTIVITY Our initial validation experiments have focused on cell culture models of HSV-1 infection. To demonstrate that the TALENs are active in live cells, we generated indicator constructs containing the HSV-1 target sites embedded between a fragment of the HIV-1 rev gene and the green fluorescent protein {gfp) gene. The HSV-1 fragment is inserted in frame such that gfp is properly translated from the construct, but such that cleavage should disrupt gfp expression by either destabilizing the indicator plasmid or by generating a frame-shift mutation. As shown in Fig. 2B, a control TALEN targeting a control, cellular DNA target indeed blocks gfp expression from the cognate indicator plasmid but not the HSV-1 -based indicator. Conversely, an ICPO-specific TALEN blocks gfp expression if the vector contains the relevant HSV-1 target but does not affect the control indicator. To extend these data, we also measure expression of the Rev-GFP protein by Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 2C, the HSV-1 miR-Hl/H6-specific TALEN strongly and specifically inhibits expression of a Rev-GFP fusion bearing the miR-Hl/H6 DNA target, whereas both ICPO-specific TALENs specifically block expression of Rev-GFP fusion proteins bearing the cognate HSV-1 derived ICPO DNA target. Therefore, it is shown that the TALENs are able to specifically cleave and inactivate episomal DNA molecules in living cells, but only if these DNA plasmids contain the relevant DNA target. We also investigated the ability of ICPO-specific TALENs to inhibit lytic HSV-1 replication in cell culture. 293T cells were transfected with one of the ICPO-specific TALEN pairs and the cells were then infected with 0.01 pfu per cell of HSV-1. Transfection efficiency was -80%, and we noted a close to 80% inhibition in HSV-1 DNA replication in the transfected cells, with an accompanying significant drop in virus replication (Fig. 3). As lyrically replicating HSV-1 shuts down host cell gene expression, which includes TALEN expression, attaining this level of inhibition is very promising. While our initial TALEN constructs certainly demonstrate proof-of-concept that these can effectively target the HSV genome in vitro, latent genomes in vivo are packaged into nucleosomes, much of which becomes associated with heterochromatin. As other DNA- binding proteins are less effective in acting on heterochromatized template compared to euchromatized template, we expect TALENs to exhibit greater activity on regions of viral DNA associated with lower levels of heterochromatic histone marks. To this end we have successfully profiled latent HSV-1 genomes from sensory ganglia of infected mice and identified key lytic gene regions that are significantly under-enriched in the heterochromatin mark trimethylated H3K27 (H3K27me3). A few such regions occur in the coding region of the major transactivator ICP4 (Fig. 4), and we have chosen targets within these sites in designing our ICP4-targeted TALENs under the expectation that these regions will be more accessible for more efficient cleavage by targeted endonuc leases. Furthermore, these euchromatic regions include substretches of DNA that have been shown to, upon mutation, produce phenotypically modified forms of ICP4 with impaired activity. One such mutation results in an ICP4 protein that retains the ability to dimerize with other ICP4 proteins and to bind to viral DNA, but loses the ability to transactivate. By targeting one TALEN pair to this region, we anticipate that mutagenized genomes may produce dominant negative forms of ICP4, impairing reactivation even from non-mutagenized genomes. To confirm that the TALE-VP16 fusions are functional, we generated indicator constructs bearing either the HSV-1 ICPO promoter or the HSV-1 ICP4 promoter linked to the firefly luciferase (Flue) indicator gene, and then co-transfected these indicators in duplicate with either the ICPO-specific or ICP4-specific TALE-VP16, or alternatively VP 16 without fusion to a TAL effector. As shown in Fig. 5, we observed ~20-fold activation of the ICPO promoter by the cognate ICPO-specific TALE-VP16 fusion and ~60 fold activation of the ICP4 promoter by the cognate ICP4-specific TALE-VP16 fusion. Control vectors gave no activation. Therefore, these TALE-VP16 fusions are fully able to specifically activate their cognate viral promoters in living cells. EXAMPLE 2— CRISPR/Cas SYSTEMS ARE EFFECTIVE AGAINST VIRAL EPISOMES To demonstrate that CRISPR/Cas systems can be effective against viral DNA episomes we employed the prototypic Streptococcus Pyogenes Cas9. SPCas9 cleavage is highly specific and comparable to that shown earlier with TALENs in Fig. 2, and retargeting involves using a distinct gRNA. When the SPCas9 RGNs are targeted to replicating episomes in culture, we observe their complete elimination from cells. In Figure 6, we have targeted viral DNA encoding the essential HSV-1 ICPO protein or the Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reverse transcriptase, with SPCas9 using the reporter assay detailed in Figure 2. In contrast to the expected reduction in GFP expression predicted by the rate of mutagenesis induce by non-homologous end joining, we observed a binary result interpretable as elimination of the episome from culture. This was the case for DNA episomes based on either an SV40 or Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) derived viral origin of replication, as shown again by Western blot using an antibody specific of Rev (Fig. 6B). This episome elimination phenomenon is highly novel and very advantageous, and HSV-1 - specific gRNAs can be combined to target multiple viral genes simultaneously, thus enhancing the desired inhibitory effect. The inhibitory effect of the observed fragmentation of circular viral DNA episomes is potentially further enhanced by the high likelihood of simultaneous mutagenesis of essential viral genes resulting from error prone dsDNA break repair. Because a single Cas9 protein can bind to several specific DNA targets, depending on the presence of appropriate gRNAs, one could also potentially cleave the HSV-1 genome at two or more places simultaneously to generate lethal viral deletion mutants. Moreover, the CRISPR/Cas system uses endonucleases that are active as single polypeptides, rather than as heterodimeric proteins as for the TALENs. As a result, sequences encoding a single Cas9 protein and one or more gRNA cassettes can be packaged into a viral vector, such as an Adeno associated virus (AAV) based vector or a vector based on an attenuated HSV-1 derivative, and subsequently used to transduce cells in vivo leading to the cleavage of one or several specific viral DNA targets in these cells, depending on the identity on the guide RNAs co-expressed by the vector. The SPCas9 gene is too large to package in an AAV vector, so we have selected Type II CRISPR/Cas9 system from Neisseria meningitidis (NMCas9; SEQ ID NO: 1), which is a minimal but complete RNA guided nuclease (RGN), for more intensive analysis in the context of AAV-based vectors. This highly specific and effective dsDNA endonuclease can be employed to destroy HSV-1 episomes and/or mutationally inactivate HSV-1 open reading frames both in culture and in vivo, initially in mice but later potentially in human patients. To further minimize total RGN size for AAV packaging, we have optimized the NMCas9 nuclease and the gRNA expression cassettes by using small but effective promoters (Fig. 8). Published work with SPCas9 describes a fusion of the two S. pyogenes small RNAs that are essential for SPCas9 function, the crRNA and tracrRNA, into a single functional guide RNA "chimera". Guide RNA chimeras consist of two essential portions; a 5' portion that is completely complementary to the sequence of the target DNA and a conserved structured 3' terminus essential for Cas9 protein binding. We have extended this work by developing and characterizing a gRNA chimera that fuses a portion of the N. meningitidis crRNA and tracrRNA. This minimal gRNA can be readily modified to target any DNA locus by altering the sequence overlined in Fig. 7A, and is expressed from a minimal RNA polymerase III (Pol III) based cassette. This gRNA is functional when loaded into NMCas9, as demonstrated by the GFP-based reporter assay, similar to the assay for TALEN activity (Fig. 2A), that is described in Fig. 6A. Expression of the NMCas9 protein together with an appropriate guide RNA results in loss of GFP expression as detected by microscopy (Fig. 7C), and loss of Rev- fusion protein expression, as detected by Western blot using an antibody specific for Rev (Fig. 7B). This assay demonstrates that we have successfully expressed adequate NMCas9 and gRNA levels in culture, and that DNA target cleavage is both highly efficient and specific. Furthermore, this result mirrors the work shown in Fig. 6 using SPCas9 and demonstrates that the smaller NMCas9 protein is also capable of inducing the endonucleolytic destruction of DNA episomes in culture. Control targets from N. Meningitides were then compared to synthetic guides we designed to target the HSV-1 ICPO and ICP4 genes and we have clearly shown that in culture NMCas9 is effective against HSV- 1 targets as measured by quantitative FACs assay (Fig. 9, panels A-C) and by disappearance of the rev-fusion protein (Fig. 9, panels D and E). To facilitate delivery of the NMCas9 payload to cells in vivo, we have designed and constructed the AAV vector that is schematically represented in Fig. 8. The human CMV immediate early promoter drives NMCas9 expression at the 3' end of the vector. 5' of this protein expression cassette we have placed a Pol Ill-driven gRNA expression cassette, to avoid the transcriptional interference known to result from Pol II promoters located 5 ' to Pol III promoters. For our initial analysis of effectiveness in vivo, we have selected several DNA targets in the HSV-1 LAT region, which is the sole transcribed region during neuronal latency, as well as in the essential viral ICP4 gene (Fig. 1). AAV vectors encoding HSV-1 - specific NMCas9-based payloads will be directly compared with non-specific control AAV vectors. Importantly, trigeminal ganglia tissue can be readily quantitatively evaluated for loss of HSV-1 episomes by quantitative PCR and loss of reactivateable HSV-1 can also be measured by neuronal explanation. NMCas9 delivered by AAV represents a novel, and potentially highly effective, mode of elimination of HSV-1 from infected neuronal tissues in vivo.

The "RA-TALEN ICPO" pair, assembled using the Joung Lab Real Assembly TALEN kit, contain RVD arrays targeted to the first exon of the ICPO protein (see 'X' in ICPO gene, Figure 10). RVD compositions are: RA-TALEN ICPO (left): NN HD NN HD NI NI NG NG NN HA NI NG HD HD NI NN NN ( SEQ I D NO : 25 ) ; RA-TALEN ICPO (right): NN HD NI NG NN HD NI HD HD NN HD NG NG HD NG NN HD ( SEQ I D NO : 2 6 ) .

Cleavage Efficiency of a Panel of ICP4-targeted TALENs. 293T cells were seeded in triplicate into a 96-well plate containing a transfection solution composed of Lipofectamine 2000 and a mixture of plasmid DNA composed of a pair of TALEN expression vectors, a reporter containing a TALEN target sequence inserted into the firefly luciferase gene, and a reporter containing the renilla luciferase gene (to allow for normalization between wells with respect to transfection efficiency). 24 hours after transfection, luciferase signal was assayed using the Promega Dual-Glo Luciferase Assay System according to the manufacturer's protocol. In cases where the sequence in the firefly luciferase gene is recognized by the TALEN pair in a given reaction (column identified as "2") for each TALEN pair, successful cleavage and subsequent repair of the firefly luciferase gene results in increased relative luciferase signal (y-axis, arbitrary units) compared to wells transfected with a given reporter alone (column identified as "1") for each TALEN pair. Each ICP4-targeted TALEN pair was also mixed in a reaction containing an ICP0 target in the firefly luciferase gene to assay for off-target amplication of luciferase (column identified as "4") for each TALEN pair compared to background levels of the ICP0 target reporter (column identified as "3") for each TALEN pair. TALEN pairs used in subsequent assays are labeled; other data sets are for ICP4-targeted TALEN pairs with alternative RVD composition. Antiviral Action of HSVl-targeted TALENs. 293T cells seeded into a 24-well plate were transfected in triplicate using a plasmid mixture containing -233 ng left-binding TALEN expression vector, -233 ng right-binding TALEN expression vector, and about -33 ng pIRES-EGFP-puro (enabling visualization of transfection efficiency and puromycin selection of transfected cells) via the TransIT-293 transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol. Fluorescence microscopy 24 hours after transfection revealed a lower estimate of near 30% transfection efficiency. 48 hours after transfection, cells were infected with HSV-1 strain 17syn+ at an MOI of 1. 12 hours after infection, cells and medium were harvested from each well, subjected to two freeze/thaw cycles, and concentration of infectious virus was determined via plaque assay.
