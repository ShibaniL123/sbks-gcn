BACKGROUND OF INVENTION Cancer cells rely primarily on glycolysis to generate cellular energy and biochemical intermediates for biosynthesis of lipids and nucleotides, while the majority of “normal” cells in adult tissues utilize aerobic respiration. This fundamental difference in cellular metabolism between cancer cells and normal cells, termed the Warburg Effect, has been exploited for diagnostic purposes, but has not yet been exploited for therapeutic benefit. Pyruvate kinase (PK) is a metabolic enzyme that converts phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate during glycolysis. Four PK isoforms exist in mammals: the L and R isoforms are expressed in liver and red blood cells, the M1 isoform is expressed in most adult tissues, and the M2 isoform is a splice variant of M1 expressed during embryonic development. All tumor cells exclusively express the embryonic M2 isoform. A well-known difference between the M1 and M2 isoforms of PK is that M2 is a low-activity enzyme that relies on allosteric activation by the upstream glycolytic intermediate, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP), whereas M1 is a constitutively active enzyme. All tumor cells exclusively express the embryonic M2 isoform of pyruvate kinase, suggesting PKM2 as a potential target for cancer therapy. PKM2 is also expressed in adipose tissue and activated T-cells. Thus, the activation of PKM2 may be effective in the treatment of, e.g., obesity, diabetes, autoimmune conditions, and proliferation-dependent diseases, e.g., benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Current inhibitors of pyruvate kinase are not selective, making it difficult to treat disease related to pyruvate kinase function. Furthermore, phosphotyrosine peptide binding to PKM2 leads to a dissociation of FBP from PKM2 and conformational changes of PKM2 from an active, tetrameric form to an inactive form. Compounds that bind to PKM2 and lock the enzyme in the active confirmation will lead to the loss of allosteric control of PKM2 needed for shunting biochemical intermediates from glycolysis into biosynthesis of nucleotides and lipids. Thus, the activation of PKM2 (i.e., activators of PKM2) can also inhibit the growth and proliferation of cancer cells, activated immune cells, and fat cells. There is a continuing need for novel treatments of diseases such as cancer, diabetes, obesity, autoimmune conditions, proliferation-dependent diseases (e.g., BPH), and other diseases related to the function of pyruvate kinase (e.g., PKM2).

Examples of prodrugs include esters and other pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives, which, upon administration to a subject, are capable of providing active compounds. The compounds provided herein may be modified by appending appropriate functionalities to enhance selected biological properties, e.g., targeting to a particular tissue. Such modifications are known in the art and include those which increase biological penetration into a given biological compartment (e.g., blood, lymphatic system, central nervous system), increase oral availability, increase solubility to allow administration by injection, alter metabolism and alter rate of excretion. Methods of Evaluating Compounds The compounds described herein can be evaluated for ability to activate PKM2 by methods known in the art. Exemplary methods include contacting the compound with a cell-based assay which allows assessment of the ability to modulate (e.g., activate) PKM2. E.g., the candidate compound can be contacted with a cell and measuring the consumption of oxygen or production of lactate. A change in cellular phosphoenolpyruvate, a change in glycerol-phosphate, a change in ribose or deoxyribose, a change in lipid synthesis, or a change in glucose conversion to lipid or nucleic acids or amino acids or protein can also be used to evaluate a compound for its ability to modulate PKM2 (e.g., activate PKM2). The evaluation could also include measuring a change in pyruvate or a determination of an alteration in mitochondrial membrane potential, e.g., as measured by fluorescent potentiometric dyes. PKM1 and PKM2 for use in the screening/testing method may be produced by any method known in the art for expression of recombinant proteins. For example, nucleic acids that encode the desired polypeptide may be introduced into various cell types or cell-free systems for expression. Eukaryotic (e.g., COS, HEK293T, CHO, and NIH cell lines) and prokaryotic (e.g., E. coli) expression systems may be generated in which a PKM sequence is introduced into a plasmid or other vector, which is then used to transform living cells. Constructs in which the PKM cDNA contains the entire open reading frame, or biologically active fragment thereof, are inserted in the correct orientation into an expression plasmid and may be used for protein expression. Prokaryotic and eukaryotic expression systems allow for the expression and recovery of fusion proteins in which the PKM protein is covalently linked to a tag molecule on either the amino terminal or carboxy terminal side, which facilitates identification and/or purification. Examples of tags that can be used include hexahistidine, HA, FLAG, and c-myc epitope tags. An enzymatic or chemical cleavage site can be engineered between the PKM protein and the tag molecule so that the tag can be removed following purification. The activity of the PKM enzyme measured in the screening/testing assay may be measured by, e.g., monitoring the concentration of a substrate (e.g., ATP or NADH) present in the reaction mixture. Pyruvate, produced by the enzymatic activity of pyruvate kinase, is converted into lactate by lactate dehydrogenase, which requires the consumption of NADH (NADH→NAD+). Thus, the activity of PKM2 can be indirectly measured by monitoring the consumption of NADH through, e.g., fluorescence assays. Additionally, the activity of the PKM2 enzyme can be directly monitored by measuring the production of ATP, as ATP is produced when phosphoenolpyruvate is converted to pyruvate. Methods for monitoring the amount of substrate in a reaction mixture include, e.g., absorbance, fluorescence, Raman scattering, phosphorescence, luminescence, luciferase assays, and radioactivity. The screening procedure requires the presence of specific components in the reaction mixture. Components utilized in the assay include, e.g., a nucleoside diphosphate (e.g., ADP), phosphoenolpyruvate, NADH, lactate dehydrogenase, FBP, a reducing agent (e.g., dithiothreitol), a detergent (e.g., Brij 35), glycerol, and a solvent (e.g., DMSO). Exemplary reaction conditions are found in Table 2. TABLE 2 Component of Amount in Reaction Condition Activation Assay ADP 0.1-5.0 mM Phosphoenolpyruvate 0.1-5.0 mM NADH 10-1000 μM Lactate dehydrogenase 0.1-10 units Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate 0 DTT 0.1-50 mM Brij 35 0.01-1% Glycerol 0.1-10% Pyruvate Kinase M2 1-100 pg (used for screen) DMSO 1-10% Compounds useful as PKM2 activators are those demonstrate specificity and activation of PKM2 enzyme in the absence of FBP to a level greater than that of 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 99, or 100% in the presence of FBP. Furthermore, compounds can be evaluated in the presence or absence of a phosphotyrosine peptide. Phosphotyrosine peptide binding to PKM2 leads to a dissociation of FBP from PKM2 and conformational changes of PKM2 from an active, tetrameric form to an inactive form. Compounds that bind to PKM2 and lock the enzyme in the active confirmation even in the presence of a phosphotyrosine peptide will lead to the loss of allosteric control of PKM2 needed for shunting the biochemical intermediates from glycolysis into biosynthesis of other intermediates. This, in turn, will lead to inhibition of growth of cancer cells, activated immune cells and fat cells. Other methods for evaluating the present compounds also include an ex vivo assays as described below. A PKM2 Ex-Vivo Assay. Described herein is a method to measure the activity of PKM2 activators in living cells and tissue. One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize and understand that this method can be adapted to high throughput format, and can accommodate a variety of cell lines and growth conditions. In the assay, cells are treated with a compound described herein (i.e., a PKM2 activator). This compound is capable of entering the cell and binding to PKM2, inducing an activated conformation. The excess unbound compound is washed away with PBS, and the cells are lysed by snap-freezing on dry ice, followed by addition of a detergent-containing lysis buffer. The lysate, in which activated PKM2 remains intact, is removed and added to a chemical cocktail including the chemicals necessary to measure pyruvate kinase activity, in an assay that is coupled to the LDHa enzyme. The amount of pyruvate kinase activity that is measured is normalized to the total protein content in the lysate, and related to the concentration of PKM2 activator that was added to the cell. This allows an AC50 (concentration at which PKM2 is activated 50%) value to be derived. The total fold-increase in activity over mock-treated cells can also be calculated, and the “maximum level of activation” can be used to distinguish between compounds that fully activate PKM2 and compounds that can only partially activate PKM2. In the case of measuring PKM2 activity from tissue (for example, in a cell tumor), animals harboring the tissue/tumor of interest are dosed with a compound. After a specified period of time in which exposure has been achieved in the target tissue/tumor of interest, the tissue/tumor is harvested from the animal, snap-frozen, and then lysed and homogenized. The amount of pyruvate kinase activity in this lysate can then be quantitated as described above. Materials: Lysis buffer* 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) 150 mM NaCl 1 mM Na2EDTA 1 mM EGTA 1% Triton 2.5 mM sodium pyrophosphate 1 mM beta-glycerophosphate 1 mM Na3VO4 1 μg/ml leupeptin 1 mM PMSF** * This lysis buffer (without PMSF) is available from Cell Signaling Technology as a 10× stock (#9803)** 1 mM PMSF is added fresh from a 100 mM stock solution made up in isopropanol. The stock solution can be stored at 4 degrees indefinitely. Pyruvate kinase assay master mix (Same for PKM2 Activator Assay): TABLE 3 KCl 100 mM Tris (pH 7.5) 50 mM MgCl2 5.0 mM PEP 0.10 mM NADH 0.18 mM DTT 1.00 mM BSA 0.3 mg/mL LDH 0.5 units H2O to 180 uL ADP solution: ADP 7.0 mM H2O to 20 uL Procedure: On the first day (day 1) cells are normally cultured in RPMI-1640 (Lonza #12-115° F.) (with 25 mM Hepes, L-glutamine)/10% FBS. The cells are subsequently trypsinized and plated in RPMI-1640 (Lonza, #12-918F) (no phenol red, supplemented with L-glutamine @300 mg/L (Sigma, #G8540))/10% FBS at the following densities in 96 well plates: A549: 40 k/well 100 uL final volume of media per well. On the second day (Day 2), the cells should be 70-90% confluent. The cells are then treated with a compound described herein dissolved in media at final assay concentrations in a 96-well assay block (500 uL) (Costar, #3956). The final DMSO concentration is 0.1% (0.5 μL into 500 uL). Compound dilutions in DMSO are prepared so that the final DMSO concentration is constant at all compound concentrations. The media for the assay is RPMI-1640 (no phenol red, with L-glutamine @300 mg/L). The media is then aspirated carefully from the cells using a multi-channel aspirator. 100 μL of media w/compounds is added onto cells with a multichannel pipette. Each compound concentration is then assayed in triplicate (a duplicate assay is also sufficient). The cells are treated for 1-4 hrs (this time is determined empirically compared to DMSO reference treatment). During the cell treatment, PBS (containing calcium and magnesium) and lysis buffer is cooled on ice. The cells are lysed and the pyruvate kinase activity is assayed. The remaining media is aspirated and the cells are washed 2× with 100 uL ice-cold PBS. The PBS is removed, and the cell plate frozen on dry ice for 5 minutes. The cells are lysed in 50 μL cold lysis buffer. Cells are subsequently kept on ice for 5 minutes, and then agitated on a plate shaker for 5 minutes (repeat 3×). Remove 10 μL for protein quantitation (or use OD280 on entire plate). In a fresh plate, 170 uL of pyruvate kinase assay master mix was added to each well (see end for recipe). 10 uL of cell lysate was then transferred into each well. The assay was initiated upon addition of 20 uL of ADP solution. The rates were then calculated against the initial rates to determine pyruvate kinase specific activity. The concentration and type of detergent in the lysis buffer can be varied to accommodate the specific physicochemical properties of the specific PKM2 activator. For instance, the interaction between some PKM2 activators and PKM2 can be disrupted by higher detergent concentrations, but preserved when cells are lysed with lower detergent concentrations. Methods of Treatment In one embodiment, provided is a method for treating or preventing a disease, condition or disorder as described herein (e.g., treating) comprising administering a compound, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of a compound or pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound described herein (e.g., a compound of formula (I), (I-a), (II), in Examples, Table 1 or Table 2). The compounds and compositions described herein can be administered to cells in culture, e.g. in vitro or ex vivo, or to a subject, e.g., in vivo, to treat, prevent, and/or diagnose a variety of disorders, including those described herein below. As used herein, the term “treat” or “treatment” is defined as the application or administration of a compound, alone or in combination with, a second therapeutic agent to a subject, e.g., a patient, or application or administration of the compound to an isolated tissue or cell, e.g., cell line, from a subject, e.g., a patient, who has a disorder (e.g., a disorder as described herein), a symptom of a disorder, with the purpose to cure, heal, alleviate, relieve, alter, remedy, ameliorate, improve or affect the disorder, or one or more symptoms of the disorder. As used herein, an amount of a compound effective to treat a disorder, or a “therapeutically effective amount” refers to an amount of the compound which is effective, upon single or multiple dose administration to a subject, in treating a cell, or in curing, alleviating, relieving or improving a subject with a disorder beyond that expected in the absence of such treatment. As used herein, the term “prevent” is defined as the application or administration of a compound, alone or in combination with, a second therapeutic agent to a subject, e.g., a patient, or application or administration of the compound to an isolated tissue or cell, e.g., cell line, from a subject, e.g., a patient, who has a predisposition toward a disorder, with the purpose to prevent the occurrence of at least one symptom of the disorder or to delay onset of at least one symptom of the disorder). As used herein, an amount of a compound effective to prevent a disorder, or a “a prophylactically effective amount” of the compound refers to an amount effective, upon single- or multiple-dose administration to the subject, in preventing or delaying the occurrence of the onset or recurrence of a disorder or a symptom of the disorder. As used herein, the term “subject” is intended to include human and non-human animals. Exemplary human subjects include a human patient having a disorder, e.g., a disorder described herein or a normal subject. The term “non-human animals” includes all vertebrates, e.g., non-mammals (such as chickens, amphibians, reptiles) and mammals, such as non-human primates, domesticated and/or agriculturally useful animals, e.g., sheep, dog, cat, cow, pig, etc. Neoplastic Disorders A compound or composition described herein can be used to treat a neoplastic disorder. A “neoplastic disorder” is a disease or disorder characterized by cells that have the capacity for autonomous growth or replication, e.g., an abnormal state or condition characterized by proliferative cell growth. Exemplary neoplastic disorders include: carcinoma, sarcoma, metastatic disorders (e.g., tumors arising from prostate, colon, lung, breast and liver origin), hematopoietic neoplastic disorders, e.g., leukemias, metastatic tumors. Prevalent cancers include: breast, prostate, colon, lung, liver, and pancreatic cancers. Treatment with the compound may be in an amount effective to ameliorate at least one symptom of the neoplastic disorder, e.g., reduced cell proliferation, reduced tumor mass, etc. The disclosed methods are useful in the prevention and treatment of cancer, including for example, solid tumors, soft tissue tumors, and metastases thereof. The disclosed methods are also useful in treating non-solid cancers. Exemplary solid tumors include malignancies (e.g., sarcomas, adenocarcinomas, and carcinomas) of the various organ systems, such as those of lung, breast, lymphoid, gastrointestinal (e.g., colon), and genitourinary (e.g., renal, urothelial, or testicular tumors) tracts, pharynx, prostate, and ovary. Exemplary adenocarcinomas include colorectal cancers, renal-cell carcinoma, liver cancer, non-small cell carcinoma of the lung, and cancer of the small intestine. Without being bound by theory, applicants believe that altered PKM2 levels characterize a subset of all types of cancers, without regard to their cellular nature or location in the body. Thus, the compounds and methods of this invention are useful to treat any type of cancer that is characterized by altered PKM2 levels. Chemotherapy In some embodiments, a compound described herein is administered with one or morechemotherapies. Chemotherapy is the treatment of cancer with drugs that can destroy cancer cells. “Chemotherapy” usually refers to cytotoxic drugs which affect rapidly dividing cells in general, in contrast with targeted therapy. Chemotherapy drugs interfere with cell division in various possible ways, e.g., with the duplication of DNA or the separation of newly formed chromosomes. Most forms of chemotherapy target all rapidly dividing cells and are not specific for cancer cells, although some degree of specificity may come from the inability of many cancer cells to repair DNA damage, while normal cells generally can. Examples of chemotherapeutic agents used in cancer therapy include, for example, antimetabolites (e.g., folic acid, purine, and pyrimidine derivatives) and alkylating agents (e.g., nitrogen mustards, nitrosoureas, platinum, alkyl sulfonates, hydrazines, triazenes, aziridines, spindle poison, cytotoxic agents, toposimerase inhibitors and others). Exemplary agents include Aclarubicin, Actinomycin, Alitretinon, Altretamine, Aminopterin, Aminolevulinic acid, Amrubicin, Amsacrine, Anagrelide, Arsenic trioxide, Asparaginase, Atrasentan, Belotecan, Bexarotene, endamustine, Bleomycin, Bortezomib, Busulfan, Camptothecin, Capecitabine, Carboplatin, Carboquone, Carmofur, Carmustine, Celecoxib, Chlorambucil, Chlormethine, Cisplatin, Cladribine, Clofarabine, Crisantaspase, Cyclophosphamide, Cytarabine, Dacarbazine, Dactinomycin, Daunorubicin, Decitabine, Demecolcine, Docetaxel, Doxorubicin, Efaproxiral, Elesclomol, Elsamitrucin, Enocitabine, Epirubicin, Estramustine, Etoglucid, Etoposide, Floxuridine, Fludarabine, Fluorouracil (5FU), Fotemustine, Gemcitabine, Gliadel implants, Hydroxycarbamide, Hydroxyurea, Idarubicin, Ifosfamide, Irinotecan, Irofulven, Ixabepilone, Larotaxel, Leucovorin, Liposomal doxorubicin, Liposomal daunorubicin, Lonidamine, Lomustine, Lucanthone, Mannosulfan, Masoprocol, Melphalan, Mercaptopurine, Mesna, Methotrexate, Methyl aminolevulinate, Mitobronitol, Mitoguazone, Mitotane, Mitomycin, Mitoxantrone, Nedaplatin, Nimustine, Oblimersen, Omacetaxine, Ortataxel, Oxaliplatin, Paclitaxel, Pegaspargase, Pemetrexed, Pentostatin, Pirarubicin, Pixantrone, Plicamycin, Porfimer sodium, Prednimustine, Procarbazine, Raltitrexed, Ranimustine, Rubitecan, Sapacitabine, Semustine, Sitimagene ceradenovec, Satraplatin, Streptozocin, Talaporfin, Tegafur-uracil, Temoporfin, Temozolomide, Teniposide, Tesetaxel, Testolactone, Tetranitrate, Thiotepa, Tiazofurin, Tioguanine, Tipifarnib, Topotecan, Trabectedin, Triaziquone, Triethylenemelamine, Triplatin, Tretinoin, Treosulfan, Trofosfamide, Uramustine, Valrubicin, Verteporfin, Vinblastine, Vincristine, Vindesine, Vinflunine, Vinorelbine, Vorinostat, Zorubicin, and other cytostatic or cytotoxic agents described herein. Because some drugs work better together than alone, two or more drugs are often given at the same time. Often, two or more chemotherapy agents are used as combination chemotherapy. In some embodiments, the chemotherapy agents (including combination chemotherapy) can be used in combination with a compound described herein. Targeted Therapy In some embodiments, a compound described herein is administered with one or more targeted therapies. Targeted therapy constitutes the use of agents specific for the deregulated proteins of cancer cells. Small molecule targeted therapy drugs are generally inhibitors of enzymatic domains on mutated, overexpressed, or otherwise critical proteins within the cancer cell. Prominent examples are the tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as Axitinib, Bosutinib, Cediranib, dasatinib, erlotinib, imatinib, gefitinib, lapatinib, Lestaurtinib, Nilotinib, Semaxanib, Sorafenib, Sunitinib, and Vandetanib, and also cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors such as Alvocidib and Seliciclib. Monoclonal antibody therapy is another strategy in which the therapeutic agent is an antibody which specifically binds to a protein on the surface of the cancer cells. Examples include the anti-HER2/neu antibody trastuzumab (HERCEPTIN®) typically used in breast cancer, and the anti-CD20 antibody rituximab and Tositumomab typically used in a variety of B-cell malignancies. Other exemplary anbibodies include Cetuximab, Panitumumab, Trastuzumab, Alemtuzumab, Bevacizumab, Edrecolomab, and Gemtuzumab. Exemplary fusion proteins include Aflibercept and Denileukin diftitox. In some embodiments, the targeted therapy can be used in combination with a compound described herein. Targeted therapy can also involve small peptides as “homing devices” which can bind to cell surface receptors or affected extracellular matrix surrounding the tumor. Radionuclides which are attached to these peptides (e.g., RGDs) eventually kill the cancer cell if the nuclide decays in the vicinity of the cell. An example of such therapy includes BEXXAR®. Immunotherapy In some embodiments, a compound described herein is administered with one or more immunotherapies. Cancer immunotherapy refers to a diverse set of therapeutic strategies designed to induce the patient's own immune system to fight the tumor. Contemporary methods for generating an immune response against tumors include intravesicular BCG immunotherapy for superficial bladder cancer, and use of interferons and other cytokines to induce an immune response in renal cell carcinoma and melanoma patients. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation can be considered a form of immunotherapy, since the donor's immune cells will often attack the tumor in a graft-versus-tumor effect. In some embodiments, the immunotherapy agents can be used in combination with a compound described herein. Hormonal Therapy In some embodiments, a compound described herein is administered with one or more hormonal therapies. The growth of some cancers can be inhibited by providing or blocking certain hormones. Common examples of hormone-sensitive tumors include certain types of breast and prostate cancers. Removing or blocking estrogen or testosterone is often an important additional treatment. In certain cancers, administration of hormone agonists, such as progestogens may be therapeutically beneficial. In some embodiments, the hormonal therapy agents can be used in combination with a compound described herein. Obesity and Fat Disorders A compound or composition described herein can be used to treat or prevent obesity, e.g., in a human subject, e.g. a child or adult subject. “Obesity” refers to a condition in which a subject has a body mass index of greater than or equal to 30. Many compounds described herein can be used to treat or prevent an over-weight condition. “Over-weight” refers to a condition in which a subject has a body mass index of greater or equal to 25.0. The body mass index (BMI) and other definitions are according to the “NIH Clinical Guidelines on the Identification and Evaluation, and Treatment of Overweight and Obesity in Adults” (1998). Treatment with the compound may be in an amount effective to alter the weight of the subject, e.g., by at least 2, 5, 7, 10, 12, 15, 20, 25, 30, 25, 40, 45, 50, or 55%. Treatment with a compound may be in an amount effective to reduce the body mass index of the subject, e.g., to less than 30, 28, 27, 25, 22, 20, or 18. The compounds can be used to treat or prevent aberrant or inappropriate weight gain, metabolic rate, or fat deposition, e.g., anorexia, bulimia, obesity, diabetes, or hyperlipidemia (e.g., elevated triglycerides and/or elevated cholesterol), as well as disorders of fat or lipid metabolism. A compound or composition described herein can be administered to treat obesity associated with Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS). PWS is a genetic disorder associated with obesity (e.g., morbid obesity). A compound or composition described herein can be used to reduce body fat, prevent increased body fat, reduce cholesterol (e.g., total cholesterol and/or ratios of total cholesterol to HDL cholesterol), and/or reduce appetite in individuals having PWS associated obesity, and/or reduce comorbidities such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and stroke.

Patients may, however, require intermittent treatment on a long-term basis upon any recurrence of disease symptoms. Patient Selection and Monitoring The compounds described herein activate PKM2. Accordingly, a patient and/or subject can be selected for treatment using a compound described herein by first evaluating the patient and/or subject to determine whether the subject is in need of activation of PKM2, and if the subject is determined to be in need of activation of PKM2, then administering to the subject a compound described herein. A subject can be evaluated as being in need of activation of PKM2 using methods known in the art, e.g., by measuring the presence and/or activity of PKM2 in the patient. In some embodiments, the activity and/or level of PKM2 is evaluated in the cancer. A patient receiving a compound described herein can be monitored, for example, for improvement in the condition and/or adverse effects Improvement of a patient's condition can be evaluated, for example, by monitoring the growth, absence of growth, or regression of the cancer (e.g., a tumor). In some embodiments, the patient is evaluated using a radiological assay or evaluation of hemolytic parameters. In one embodiment, the methods of treatment of this invention include a first step of identifying or selecting a patient who would benefit from modulation (e.g., activation) of PKM2 by determining the level of PKM2 activity in a patient or more particularly in an organ or cell of the patient (e.g., as opposed to merely being in need of treatment of the disorder itself, e.g., cancer). The level of PKM2 would be compared to a control (e.g., the PKM2 activity of another patient not suffering from the disorder (e.g., cancer) or the PKM2 activity of the same patient taken at an earlier time) to determine if the current level of PKM2 activity warranted treatment with a compound of this invention. In one aspect, a patient who has a level of PKM2 activity below that of a control would be a candidate for treatment with a compound of this invention. In another embodiment, the methods of treatment of this invention include the subsequent step of monitoring the level of PKM2 activity in a patient or more particularly in an organ or cell of the patient during the course of or following treatment with a compound of this invention to determine the efficacy of the treatment. The level of PKM2 would be compared to a control (e.g., PKM2 activity of the same patient taken just prior to treatment) to determine if the PKM2 activity had been altered by the treatment, thus providing evidence of efficacy of the treatment. In one aspect, an increase in PKM2 activity during the course of or following treatment is indicative that the treatment was effective. EXAMPLES In the synthesis examples set forth below, certain compounds have specified stereochemistry at one of more positions. These compounds were prepared using the indicated scheme either using the appropriate chirally pure reagents or were separated from a racemate produced by the indicated scheme using an appropriate chiral separation column, such as a Chiralpak AD-H column (250×4 6 mm) 5 μM column, eluting with 0.05% diethyl amine in hexane/isopropanol (75:25 v/v) with a flow rate of 2 ml/min with absorbance monitored at 220 nm.

Example 1 Preparation of Compounds of Formula Ic wherein R1 is aryl or cyclopropyl; Re is methyl or CF3; R3 is alkyl and n is 0 or 1. Synthesis of Intermediate IV To a stirred solution of aryl ketones II (17 mmol) in 10 ml of dichloromethane were added optionally substituted tert-butyl piperazine-1-carboxylate I (16 mmol), Et3N (48 mmol) and 1 M TiCl4 (8 mmol) at room temperature, followed by stirring the reaction mixture at room temperature for 18 h. To the reaction mixture was added a solution of NaBH3CN (48 mmol) in MeOH (5 ml) at room temperature, followed by stirring the reaction mixture at room temperature for 6 h. Ethyl acetate and saturated aqueous NaHCO3 solution were added to the reaction mixture. The insoluble material obtained was filtered off using celite. The ethyl acetate layer was separated, washed with brine, dried over anhydrous MgSO4 and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated in vacuum and the crude compound was taken for the next step without purification. The compound obtained from this step was dissolved in 10 ml of Methanolic HCl and stirred the reaction mixture for 2 h at room temperature. The mixture was concentrated under vacuum to leave intermediate IV as solid. The obtained solid was neutralized with base to get a free base which was used for the next step (45-60% over two steps). Synthesis of ethyl 4-(quinoline-8-sulfonamido)benzoate (VII) To a solution of amine V (16 gm, 96.85 mmol) in a mixture (1:1) of DCM and pyridine, sulfonyl chloride VI (27.56 gm, 121.07 mmol) was added at room temperature under N2 atmosphere. The resulting mixture was allowed to stir for 16 hrs. After completion of reaction, the crude mixture was diluted with DCM, washed with water followed by 1N HCl. The organic layer was then dried over Na2SO4 and concentrated under reduced pressure to afford intermediate VII in 98% yields (34 gm). Synthesis of 4-(quinoline-8-sulfonamido)benzoic acid (VIII) To a solution of sulfonamide VII (34 gm, 95.5 mmol) in THF and water (1:1), LiOH (20 gm, 47.66 mmol) was added and the resulting mixture was allowed to stir at 80° C. overnight. After completion of reaction, the crude mixture was washed with EtOAc. The aqueous layer was acidified with citric acid and filtered. Thus obtained solid was washed with Et2O and azeotroped by toluene, under reduced pressure to afford acid VIII (30 gm, 95.8% yield) which was taken forward for the next step without further purification. Synthesis of Compounds of Formula I According to Scheme 1 To a solution of acid VIII (1 mmol) in DMF (2 ml), PyBoP (Benzotriazole-1-yl-oxy-tris-(dimethylamino)-phosphonium hexafluorophosphate) (0.78 gm, 1.5 mmol) was added at 0° C. and allowed to stir for 5 minutes. Then amine IV (1 mmol) was added to the reaction mixture at the same temperature under N2 atmosphere and stirred overnight at room temperature. After completion of reaction, mixture was diluted with water and extracted with EtOAc. The organic layer was washed with water, dried over Na2SO4, and evaporated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by column chromatography (silica gel, 60-120 mesh; MeOH-DCM, 2:8) to afford product IX in 40-66% yield. The above procedure was used to produce the following compounds of Formula Ic using the appropriate aryl ketone II and the appropriate optionally substituted tert-butyl piperazine-1-carboxylate I. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3) δ: 1.3 (d, 3H), 2.2-2.4 (m, 4H), 3.2-3.4 (m, 2H), 3.5 (m, 1H), 3.6-3.8 (m, 2H), 5.3 (s, 1H), 7.0-7.4 (m, 8H), 7.5-7.65 (m, 2H), 8.0 (d, 1H), 8.38 (m, 2H), 8.55 (s, 1H), 9.0 (m, 1H);
