UNITARY STRUT TDRE The wringer unit eomprisés wrlngir apparatus and a power head which is transportable in assembled relation and is adoEwted to be mounted upon a support and movable Io ' i ¸¸. as a unit with respect to the support into various convendent operating positions. The frame of the wringer unit includes a bracket having a hub 21 adapted to be received by the portion 22a of a supporting post 22, and an inverted U-shaped wringer frame 23 which is detachable secured te bracket by means of studs 24 engaging tapped holes 24a in frame 23, and by screws 24b passing through holes 24c in frame l0 23 and threaded into bracket 20 The wringer bracket hub 21 is provided with notches, one shovel at ll8 in Fig. l, which are adapted to receive a lug ll9 carried by post 22 for holding the wringer in a desired operating position. To change the position of the wringer the operator swings the u it causing one notch ll8 to move away from lug ll9 and another notch to be received by lug ll9 te yìeldingly maintain the wringer unit in a new position. POWER HEAD The power head 2õ of the wringer unit will now be described. This power head includes an electric motor 2õ provided with a brush lifting reversing switch operated by a lever 120. The switch is disclosed in the copenoEing application of Ralph L. Lee, Serial No. 2V5,746, filed March 26, 1923. For the understanding of the present invention dt is sufficient to state that the lever 120 is movable to cause the motor to turn in either direction or to stop the motor« The easing of the motor includes a part whic.h is ini ii.I. , V • • ,i • • i!•!• • ï tegral with a gear housing 27 attached to bracket 20 by screws õ6. The armature shaft of the motor is provided f • with a worm 26 which is adapted to extend into a gear housing 27 and to drive a worm gear 28 located therein. ear housing 27 is open at one side and this opening is provided with a cover 29 held in place by screws 30. An cil filler openir4 31 is provided and is closed by filler plug 3 Gear housing 27 is provided with bearing 33 which le adapted to receive operating shaft 34 to which the gear 28 is keyed. The bearing 3 provides a relatively long bearing surface for the shaft 34. lO The shaft 34 extends through the gear housing 27 and a wall of the bracket 20, The opening in the bracket through which the shaft 34 extends is cylindrical and somewhat larger than the shaft and is adapted te receive a cup washer 37 which with the wall of housing 27 provides a lubrecant receiving chamber 38. Inclined passages 39 and connect chamber 38 with the interior of the gear housing. During the opération of the motor some of the cil splashed within the gear housing 27 will enter the passage 39 and flow to the chamber 38 to lubricate the shaft 34. The excess lubricant flows through the passage 40 back into the gear housing; and, since the lubricant level in ousing 27 is below the shaft 34, little if any lubricant in said chamber 38 will tend to flow out around the shaft 34. WRINGING APPARATUS The wringer frame 23 includes inverted U-shaped side frames 50 and 51 held together by bolts 52. Frames 0 nd 51 may be considered half shell portions, and each are provided with downwardly extending side walls 53 which form with the tops of the frames 50 and 51 a channel 53a. Frames 50 and 51 are provided with inwardly extending ribs 54 which :ï ì lO foem guides for the roller shaft bearings 55 and õ6. A spring strip member 57 is secured to each lower bearing and is adapted to bear against the freines 50 and 51 to maintain said bearings 55 in correct positìon (ses Fig. 3), and to prevent accidental dislocation of the bearings 55, such as might occur when the wringer unit is shipped with roller pressure released, or when the pressure ìs suddenly released by means of a quick release device to be described. Pressure or wringer rolls 68 and 69 are carried by shafts 70 and 71, respectively shaft 70 bears down-. warily upon the lower bearing 55 while the upper bearing 56 bears downwardly upon the shaft 71. Pressure between the rolls is supplied by a pressure spring 72 located within the channel 53a. Shaft 70 of tl e lower roll is connected with the operating shaft 34 of the power head by means of a universal eoupllng including sleeve 75 provided with notches 76. Shafts 34 and 70 each carry pins 77 which slide within the notches 76, and wire 78 is wrapped around the sleeve 75 se as to prevent the pin 77 from moving end-user shafts 70 and 71 are connected by gears 79 and 80 which are enclosed by the bracket The side walls 53 of the wringer-frame members 50 and 51 extend dmvnwardly to enclose the bearìngs 55 and 56 and the ends of the rolls and to provide an opening for the introduction of clothes. By enclosîng the gearing, universal coupling, and roll ends, danger to the operator and to the clothes is substantially reduced. It is apparent from the foregoing that the power head device and wringing device are removably mounted on oppoi• - l " • site sides of the bracket 20; that the wringing device can be removed while still assembled without disturbing, the power head device anà that the disconnection of the wringing device automatically interrupts the power transmitting connection from the power head device to the wring- ng device. After the wringer is removed, the power head can be removed as a unit by removing bolts 36. Means are proviåeá in the wringing device for permitting endwise removal of rollers, shafts, bearings, and fO the springs, the wringing device being detached from bracket 20 by the removal of the nuts from studs 24 and by the removal of screws 24b. Referring more in particular to Fig. 5, the inwardly extending ribs 54 which functions as guide members for the bearings 55 a d 56 are notched to lõ provide enlarged openings 121 and 122 through one end of the wringer frame. The opening 121 is large enough that the spring 72 may be removed therethrough. A lower openIng 1 2 is large enough to permit the rollers 69 and and bearings 55 e aà 56 to be removed through it. The tension of spring 72 is released then spring 72 can be withdrawn through the opening l l. The upper wrìnger roll 69 and one bearing 56 are then pushed into the upper part of the wringer frame and in so doing the lower roller 70 can be raised high enough so that it can be removed thriugh the opening 122. One lower bearing 55 can then be removed. The upper roller 69 is then lowered to adjacent the opening B and then removed, and a bearing 56 is removed. The right hand end or branch of the wringer frame 23 is closed by the end walls of the frames 50 and 51 (see Fig. 6), and the ribs 54 adjacent this enå are notched so that the other r l0 bearings 55 ami õ6 in this branch of the frame can be removed from the inside of the wringer frame. The bracket 20 10rovides a closure for the openings in the left end or branch of the wringer frime 23 so that both ends of the frame are enclosed in the unitary structure. The web 20aprovided in bracket 20 prevents the spring 72 moving endwise to the left as viewed in Fig. l o WRINGER RELEASE The center of the top of the frame 50 and 51 is provided with an opening having a hinged cover or latch plate 82 pivoted at 83 and carries an adjusting screw 84 for the tension spring 72. The free end of the plate 82 is provided with a slightly upwardly inclined portion which cooperates with the hook portion 86 of a latch lever 87. Latch lever 87 is pivoted upon frame 23 by pin 88, located substantially directly below the free end of the plate 82. In this manner upward tension of the spring 72 on the adjusting screw 84 and cover 82 tends to hold a hook portion 86 in engagement with the inclined portion of the plate 82. When the lever 87 is pushed downwardly it will cause the hook 86 to move away from the in. clined surface 85 so as to clear member 85 whereby plate 82 will swing about its pivot 83 to release the tension in the spring 72. A spring 90 is coiled about pin 91 carriedby latch lever 86 and engages the under side 92 thereof and the tolo of frame 23. Spring 90 tends to return lever 87 to latching position. To return the cover plate 82 te the position shown in FiE. 1 after the quick release device has been operated, the adJustingsorew 84 is partly unscrewed and the cover 82 is swung te operat- / r YV l0 ing position. The plate 82 will engage the surface 9 of lever 86 thereby forcing it to snap into operating position shown in Fig. l. Means are provided for preventing certain movable wringer parte from striking the frame when the quick release device has been operated. This means includes a b le 1B connected with cover plate 82 and passing under spring 72. When plate 82 is released, the bale 12S limits its movement so that screw 84 cannot strike the frame and be damaged or mar the frame. DRAIN BOARD The lower end of the wringer 2 carries a pivotally mounted drain board 58, mounted between rails or side frames 59 and 60. Each rail carries a trunnion screw 61 rotatably and loosely Journaled in larger holes 61 provided in the branch portions of the wringer frame. Both trunnion screws 61 are removable endwise through the ends of the frame. To remove the drain board, the right hand screw 61 (Fig. l) is not placed in position until the drainboard is memowed, then the board can be tilted with respect to the left hand hole 6la because of the looseness of fit between the screw 61 and hole 6la, smd then the board can oe removed by sidewise movement without disassembling the wringer. Drainboard 58 is provided with a lockìng device for maintaining the board in either of its operating positions. This locking device comprises a sliding pin õ3 carried b the frame 50 (see Fig. 8). Pinç 63 has a notch 64 formed by flattëning off a side of pin 63. A pin 65 inserted from the side of the frame 50 is Il i h. i lO received by the notch 6 and is adapted to cooperate with the ends of the notch te prevent the locking pin 6S from being pulled entirely out of the frame 23, Pin 63 cooperates with holes 66 and 67 in the side rail 60 so as to lock the drain board in either of its tilted positions. The warmonger unit is provided with devices tending to direct water dropping from the wringing apparatus toward the drainboard se as to prevent spattering the floor. Te accomplish this the wringer is provided with water receiving ledges ll3 extending under the ends of the lower roll 68 and over the drain board rails 59 and 60. Each ledge iS provided with a drip flange ll4 located above the drain board 58, the drain board 58 being cut away slightly as at ll6 to provide clearance for said flanges ll4, Water tending to follow the shafts 70 and 71 drips off onto the ledges ll3 and is directed by flanges ll toward the drainbca.rd õS« The flanges ll4a tend to divert water issuing endwise from the rolls toward the dralnboard. The drain board G8 is provided with drip strips 58a tending to prevent water running back under the grain board toward the wringer frame and dripping Upon the floor, 00NVEYOR The drain beard 58 provides a movable support for the movable wringer conveyor now to be described, At opposite end edges Q the board 58 rails 59 and 60 carry rollers 95 and 96 located parallel to the pressure rolls 68 and 69,and adapted to support a conveyor belt 97. interposed between the wringer rolls 68 and 69 and therefore rotated by the movement of these rolls. Rollers 95 and 96 are tapered so as to be larger in diameter at the center than at the end n, l0 l0 in order that, during the movement of the belt, the belt will remain in alignment with the wringer rolls. To prevent gathering or crawling the conveyor belt 97 is preferably made of two thicknesses of fabric, such as canvas, The side edges of the fabric are folle over, as indicated at 97a and 97b in Fig. 7, and are brought together at the center of the belt. A strip of tape 98 is sewed through the side edges of the fabric te make a a two-ply belt. Parallel stitchings 99 are provided lengthwise on the belt to hold the plies together so that said plies will together form a relatively stiff belt, so as to prevent the belt from gathering. A series of spaced loops 101 are sewed to the one end of the conveyor belt 97 while spaced loops 102 are sewed to the other end of the conveyor belt. Loops 101 are adapted to fit within the spaces between the loops 102 while the loops 102 are adapted to fit within the spaces between the loops 101. A stave 103 is inserted into the loops 101 and 102 to thereby lace the belt. Pairs of loops 104 shorter than loops 10 and 102 are located at each side edge of the belt. One of these loops 104 is carried at each corner of the end of the belt fabric se as to engage the notched end 105 of the stffve 103. These small loops 104 provide glans for lacing the belt at the side edges and prevent accidental remova! of the stave. In laeing the belt the stave 103 is first in serted thrash loops 101 and 102 as is shown in l ig. 7. One of the notched ends is then inserted into the small loops 104 at one side of the belt 97. After one side of the belt is connecte the other notched end 10S is inserted ll lO within the loop 104 on the other side of the belt. It is understood that the belt will stretch sidewise so hat the loops 104 can be stretched over a notched end 105. Both ends of the conveyor belt are reenforced by tap 106 and 107 secured by stitching. Means are provided for preventing a large quantity of water accumulating between the plies at any one portion thereof, for example, adjacent the lacing, in order to prevent a relatively large volume of water being squeezed out with considerable force and squirted upon the floor, work bench, or the llke. This means comprises devices for rapping small quantities of water in pockets between the plies of the belt and causing these pockets to be progressively emptied so that the water will be squeezed out progressively and in relatively small amounts. By avoiding an accumulation of water, the water squeezed out in small quantities will rmn down the conveyor belt onto the drain board. To accomplish these aims of the invention the elt 97 is pzovialed with diagonal stltchìngs 108 (See ig,9). These stltchlngs cooperate with stitching 99 to form water disperslng pockets. The belt 9V is generally water soaked during the wringing operation and ter tends to collect between the plies of the canvas. In order that a consldnot erable quantity of water will/be collected adjacent he lacing and theìe be squeezeŒE out with considerable force, the diagonal stitchings 108 cooperate with the lengthwise stitching 99 to form a series of pockets where e water will be trapped and pushed in small quantities from between the plies of canvas. en the belt 97 moves to the rì ht as viewed in Fig. 9 the water between the plies of », ri r st r € »'».J ,i . . :i. . lO 2;6 canvas will be trapped and then pushed out of pockets 109. When the conveyor belt 97 moves so that a portion indicated by the dot and dash llne llO moves under the roll the water between the plies of canvas between the diagonal stitches 108 will be trapped and then pushed out of series of pockets l$1. In this manner small amounts of water are pushed out from between the plies of canvas at a plurality of places with relatively little force instead of collecting at one place and being, squeezed out with relatively great force. The tape 98 makes the belt thicker at the center than elsewhere except at the lacing se that the wringer rolls tend to exert more pressure on the belt along, the tape than along the side edges, The rolls therefore tend to grasp the belt more at the center than at the sìde edges, and, consequently, the belt tends to track readily with the rolls. It is to be understood that faatures of the present invention are adapted not only to clothes wringing, apparatus but also to other apparatus involving a rolling aetlon in the mode of operation, such as mangles having one or more rollers adapted te be driven by a power device. Basile the form of mechanism herein shown and described constitutes a preferred embodiment of one form of the invention, it is to be understood that other forms might be adopted and various changes and alterations made in the shape, size, and proportion of the elements therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. dhat is claimed is as follows: i iï' • i!i ii i!• •IIII ii • • / i • • - i ; j i li• I.
