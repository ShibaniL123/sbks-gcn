The present invention relates to the field of gloves. Are known gloves of the type five fingers (5F), mitten (mitten), two fingers (lobster), three fingers (trigger) to four fingers (rocher), with various types of construction, lightweight gloves, with or without padding with or without breathable waterproof membrane, winter gloves with padding fixed or removable, gloves with over-glove (OVERGLOVE) gloves with double chamber (double chamber) five fingers or five fingers-mitten. These gloves have different characteristics. Depending on the type gloves they are warmer, which offer greater sensitivity, more aerodynamic and more. This invention aims to provide a glove that is streamlined, with stable structure, precise and conformable to any kind of use, improving the functionality of the various applied parts. Another object is to provide a glove that is protective to the fingers. Further object is to provide a glove that confers to the fingers a good sensitivity and precision in use. This object is achieved by a glove and a method of realization of said glove in accordance with the appended claims. The characteristics of the glove of the present invention will be better understood from the following description in which reference is made to the accompanying drawings which illustrate a preferred embodiment and not limiting, in which: Figure 1 shows a cover with associated inserts of a glove, according to the present invention;Figure 2 shows a glove in a first phase of production of the same, according to the present invention;Figure 3 shows a glove in a second phase of production of the same, according to the present invention;Figure 4 shows a glove in a third phase of production of the same, according to the present invention;Figure 5 shows a glove in a fourth phase of production of the same, according to the present invention;Figure 6 shows a glove, according to the present invention;Figure 7 shows a glove including dorsal reinforcement, according to the present invention. Referring to the accompanying drawings, a glove, according to the present invention, comprises a structure 10 of a glove with five fingers, obtained in the traditional way, but lacking the coverage of the back of the hand and the four fingers. The structure 10 can be realized with any type of material, depending on the type and use, with skin, curdled, fabric etc. On the back is placed, by sewing, preferably, a cover 11 that covers the back of the hand and the four fingers, and having three cuts 12 to define the four fingers. The material to make the cover 11 of the back is a lightweight, breathable fabric, which makes both assembly structure that the under glove. Inserts 13 are then applied, by sewing, between the fingers of the structure 10. The inserts 13 have a substantially triangular shape: narrow where the fingers join together and wider toward the ends of the fingers. The inserts 13 have the function of joining the fingers between them, limiting, for greater safety against accidents, their enlargement beyond the width of the inserts 13, which must be of a minimum size used for the fastening (sewing), preferably not more than 15 mm, must arrive at least 5 mm beyond the tip of the fingers (to facilitate subsequent sewing) and have the function of under glove, and as the cover 11 facilitates the realization of the glove. The material of the inserts 13 is equal to that used for the side gussets of the glove with five fingers. It then applies a layer, which is the external portion of the glove that is, the back 14 of the glove 10 having the shape of a mitten for the back, that is a single piece that covers the entire underlying structure, that is, the back and all four fingers. In particular covers the cover 11 and the inserts 13 over their entire surface and length. The back 14 is sewn along its profile and joining the cover 11 and the relevant inserts 13. The spine 14 is made from materials, the type of the glove with five fingers, below, and in any case according to the type and use, such as skin, curdled fabric etc. It is possible to apply on the back 14 any elastic and/or other accessories 15, fetlock and/or systems for improving sliding, before fixing the back 14 to cover 11. The back 14 is applied in reverse over the underlying part of the glove with five fingers, in order to cover all the fingers, this, to obtain that the part sewn of the finished glove result in the inner part to the glove and therefore not visible. The structure of the glove must be assembled and sewn inside out, the rear element is sewn on the outer edge, around the entire perimeter of the structure of the glove, going to fully cover the fingers. When the glove is sewn, the glove is reversed so that the part of the fingers (including thumb) of the five fingers structure are brought out of the outside while the back 14 is positioned externally on the outside and only on the back of the glove, covering over their entire length the four fingers of the glove structure, excluding the thumb, and these seams joining the back mittens are internal and not visible, alternatively, are also possible external sewing. We proceed with the finish of the glove, with possible inclusion of the padding, border or folding. On the back 14, or inside, can be applied in known manner, knuckle 16 for the back of the hand in the area of conjunction of the metacarpus to the first phalanx, and improved sliding systems 16 (rigid plates), preferably in the area of conjunction of third and second phalanx of the fingers, of the type rigid or soft. In an alternative embodiment of the glove according to the present invention is not applied the cover 11 and the inserts 13 but directly the back 14 at the expense of the working precision. The result is a hybrid glove underneath, towards the palm of the hand, is a glove with five fingers and the top, towards the back of the hand, is a glove-type mitten. The glove according to the present invention is a hybrid five-fingered glove but having the back of the mitten type that ioins the four fingers (pinky, ring, middle and index) on the part of the back. This limits the slightest movement of the fingers, to have greater safety against accidents caused by an excessive accidental opening of the fingers in both directions, with respect to a traditional glove with five fingers. The four fingers can move laterally between them as far as it allow the inserts 13 and the back 14, the minimum required for the construction (equipment and / or materials used. The glove has the same time the fit, the sensitivity and accuracy of use of a glove with five fingers traditional but at the same time gives good protection from the cold on the portion of the back like a mitten. The fact of not having the cut of the fingers, for example the use in the practice of skiing, prevents the penetration of air between the fingers and therefore the greater dispersion of heat and then to have a glove with the properties and the heat retention, greater compared to a traditional five fingers. This solution allows to give more protection to the fingers of the hand compared to a traditional glove with five fingers resulting from any accidental trauma from an excessive opening of the single finger, both in lateral direction that overturning. The back as mitten, being a unique part, fixed the four fingers in solidarity, limiting the opening of the single finger and then deleting the dynamics described above. Another very important factor in favor of the said construction is the aerodynamics, which is of fundamental importance in the practice of sports, both in skiing, motorcycling, and in any sports where aerodynamics is critical to gain precious seconds of the race but at the same time the precision and sensitivity of the fit must be guaranteed. This glove also allows to insert any type of shock-absorber system, rigid, semi-rigid or soft fetlock, on the part in the joining region of the metacarpus to the first phalanx, systems of improved smoothness, in the joining region of the third and the second phalanx finger, in any form and/or design and material, tailored for different sports where the gloves are imperative. The materials used, as well as the dimensions, may be any according to the requirements and the state of the art. Although the invention has been described with particular reference to its shape and to the method of realization, is given only by way of example and not limitatative, many modifications and variations will be apparent to a person skilled in the art in light of the above description. This solution of construction may be made on other types of glove, for example on the glove to three fingers trigger) on the glove to two fingers (lobster) on the glove to four fingers (rocher).
