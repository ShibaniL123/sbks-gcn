BACKGROUND Unless otherwise indicated herein, the materials described in this section are not prior art to the claims in this application and are not admitted to be prior art by inclusion in this section. Self-cleaning coatings, such as paints, are of current interest. Many paint finishes display a hydrophobic surface with high surface tension that may cause water to bead up and nm off the coating. Much current literature is focused on the pursuit of materials with increased surface tension such as super-hydrophobic material surfaces. Coatings have also been produced with low surface tension, for example, mediated by the many hydrophilic particulate additives included in various paints. However, high surface tension coatings and low surface tension coatings may not be self-cleaning under all conditions. Some conditions that may tend to clean relatively high surface tension coatings may tend to dirty relatively low surface tension coatings, and vice versa. The present disclosure appreciates that preparing self-cleaning coatings such as paints may be a complex undertaking.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION In the following detailed description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings, which form a part hereof. In the drawings, similar symbols may identify similar components, unless context dictates otherwise. The illustrative embodiments described in the detailed description, drawings, and claims are not meant to be limiting. Other embodiments may be utilized, and other changes may be made, without departing from the spirit or scope of the subject matter presented herein. The aspects of the present disclosure, as generally described herein, and illustrated in the Figures, can be arranged, substituted, combined, separated, and designed in a wide variety of different configurations, all of which are explicitly contemplated herein. The present disclosure generally describes technologies relating to photo-wettable painted coatings, including liquid paints, methods to form painted coatings using liquid paints, methods to manufacture liquid paints, and painted articles. Briefly stated, technologies are generally described for photo-wettable paint coatings. In some examples, a coating may include a charge photo-ejector, a charge transporter; and/or a charge storage material. The charge photo-ejector may absorb light and eject a charge. The charge may be received by the charge transporter and transported to the charge storage material, which may store charge at an air-paint interface. Alternating exposure to light and dark conditions, such as daytime and nighttime, may cycle surface energy states of the photo-wettable paint coating. The photo-wettable paint coating may cycle between a charged, wettable, relatively lower surface energy state when lighted and a relatively hydrophobic, higher surface energy state when in a charge-dissipated and/or unlighted state. Cycling between different states may promote self-cleaning of the photo-wettable paint coatings of contaminants, further in combination with water provided by rain, dew, washing, spraying, or the like. FIG. 1A is a conceptual drawing representative of various examples of liquid paints and photo-wettable paint coatings at surfaces, arranged in accordance with at least some embodiments described herein. FIG. 1 shows a liquid paint coating 100 at a surface 110. The liquid paint coating 100 may include a charge storage material 102, a charge transporter material 104, and a charge photo-ejector material 106, all in a carrier liquid 108. The carrier liquid 108 may include an optional binder 109. The liquid paint coating 100 may dry and/or cure to form a photo-wettable painted coating 101 that may include the charge photo-ejector material 106, the charge transporter material 104, and the charge storage material 102. The photo-wettable painted coating 101 may include the optional binder 109 in a cured state. FIG. 1B is a conceptual drawing representing cycling of surfaces of photo-wettable coatings 101/101′ between less wettable, hydrophobic, higher surface energy states such as 101 and more wettable, hydrophilic, lower energy states such as 101′. Photo-wettable painted coatings 101/101′ are predicted to function as follows. The photo-wettable painted coating 101 may have a less wettable, hydrophobic, higher surface energy state as indicated by the contact angle 114 of the water droplet 112. Incident light, for example, from the sun 116 may be absorbed by the photo-ejector material 106. The photo-ejector material 106 may eject charge 118, depicted in FIG. 1A as a negative charge. The charge 118 may be positive or negative depending on the specific photo-ejector material employed. The ejected charge 118 may be received by the charge transporter material 104 and may be transported to the charge storage material 102. As the charge storage material 102 accumulates more charge, the surface of the photo-wettable coating becomes more wettable, hydrophilic, and lower energy in state 101′, as indicated by the contact angle 122 of the water droplet 120. As depicted in FIG. 1B, the more wettable, hydrophilic, lower energy state 101′ may revert to the less wettable, hydrophobic, higher surface energy state 101 over time. Reversion of state 101′ towards state 101 may occur, for example, by charge dissipation, charge equalization, charge neutralization, or any other technique of reducing the charge 118 at the surface. For example, the photo-wettable coating in the more wettable, hydrophilic, lower energy state 101′ may be subject to a period of relative darkness, such as nighttime. Without a light source such as sun 116 to eject charge from the photo-ejector material 106, the charges 118 may tend to dissipate from the surface. In the presence of alternating periods of light and dark, such as daytime and nighttime, the photo-wettable coating may cycle between the less wettable, hydrophobic, higher surface energy state 101 and the more wettable, hydrophilic, lower energy state 101′. As used herein, a charge storage material, for example, the charge storage material particles 102, may be any material configurable to store charge 118 at the surface of the painted coatings 101/101′. Suitable charge storage materials may include, for example, one or more of: silica; alumina; a fluoropolymer; a fluoroalkyl compound or group; a polyaliphatic, a polyester; or a combination, a compound, a composite, or a copolymer thereof. The charge storage material may be configured as a collection of particles having an average diameter in various examples of about 1 nm to about 100 μm, 10 nm to 100 μm, 100 nm to 100 μn, 1 μm to 100 μm, 10 μm to 100 μm, 10 nm to 10 μm, 100 nm to 10 μm, 1 μm to 10 μm, or any subrange thereof. Specific examples of average diameters are about 1 nm, about 100 nm, about 100 μm, and ranges between any two of these values (including endpoints). The charge storage material may also be configured as a coating or adsorbent on or adsorber of the charge transporter material. As used herein, a charge transporter material, for example, the charge transporter material particles 104, may be any material configurable to transport a charge from the photo-ejector material to the charge storage material. In some examples, the charge transporter material may also be configurable to separate charges at the charge storage material from the photo-ejector material so as to slow recombination or back transport of charge from the charge storage material to the photo-ejector material. In several examples, the charge transporter material may also be configurable to provide a diode functionality that may favor charge transport in a direction from the photo-ejector material to the charge storage material. The ejected charge may be positive or negative depending on the photo-ejector material in question. Suitable charge transporter materials may include, for example, titanium dioxide; zinc oxide; zirconia; copper (I) oxide; or a combination or a composite thereof. The charge transporter material may be configured as a collection of particles having an average diameter in various examples of about 1 nm to about 100 μm, 10 nm to 100 μm, 100 nm to 100 μm, 1 μm to 100 μm, 10 μm to 100 μm, 10 nm to 10 μm, 100 nm to 10 μm, 1 μm to 10 μm, or any subrange thereof. Specific examples of average diameters are about 1 nm, about 100 nm, about 100 μm, and ranges between any two of these values (including endpoints). The charge transporter material may also be configured as a coating or adsorbent on or adsorber of the charge photo-ejector material and/or the charge storage material. As used herein, a photo-ejector material, for example, the photo-ejector material particles 106, may be any material configurable to eject a charge upon absorption of one or more photons. The ejected charge may be positive or negative depending on the photo-ejector material in question. Example photo-ejector materials may include one or more of: a conjugated organic dye; a conjugated conductive or semi-conductive organic polymer; an inorganic quantum dot that includes a II-VI, III-V, or chalcogenide semiconductor; a rare earth organometallic dye; or a combination, a compound, a composite, or a copolymer thereof. In some examples, suitable photo-ejector materials may include photoejector materials employed in solar cells, particularly dye sensitized solar cells. Examples of such dyes may include, but are not limited to, compounds such as triscarboxy-rutheniumn terpyridine [Ru(4,4′,4″-(COOH)3-terpy)(NCS)3], 1-ethyl-3 methylimidazolium tetrocyanoborate [EMIB(CN)4], or copper-diselenium [Cu(In,GA)Se2]. The charge photo-ejector material may be configured as a collection of particles having an average diameter in various examples of about 1 nanometer (nm) to about 100 micrometers (μm), 10 nm to 100 μm, 100 nm to 100 μm, 1 μm to 100 μm, 10 μm to 100 μm, 10 nm to 10 μm, 100 nm to 10 μm, 1 μm to 10 μm, or any sub-range thereof. Specific examples of average diameters are about 1 nm, about 100 nm, about 100 μm, and ranges between any two of these values (including endpoints). The charge photo-ejector material may also be configured as a coating or adsorbent on or adsorber of the charge transporter material. As used herein, the carrier liquid 108 may include any liquid configurable for use in a paint. In various examples, the carrier liquid may include one or more of water, a water-miscible organic solvent, or a curable binder. The carrier liquid may also include other components suitable for use in paints, such as pigments, dyes, surfactants, dispersants, flocculants, drying agents, wetting agents, solubility enhancers, antimicrobial agents, antifungal agents, pesticides, ultraviolet protecting agents, hardeners, plasticizers, or the like. FIG. 2 is a conceptual drawing representing various aspects of techniques 200 of forming photo-wettable painted coatings on surfaces, including painting surfaces with liquid paints, allowing self-segregation, and drying and/or curing to form the photo-wettable painted coatings, all arranged in accordance with at least some embodiments described herein. In FIG. 2, a liquid paint reservoir 201 may include the carrier liquid 108, the optional binder 109, the photo-ejector 106, the charge transporter 104, and the charge storage material 102. The liquid paint may be applied from reservoir 201 by any means suitable for painted coatings, such as by employing brushes, sponges, rollers, spray painting apparatus, dip coaters, spin coaters, or the like. Upon painting on a layer, the respective photo-ejector material 106, the charge transporter material 104, and the charge storage material 102 may be in a relatively mixed or disordered state in the carrier liquid 108. In some examples, the liquid paint may be mixed thoroughly before application, such as in reservoir 201. The respective materials may be characterized by corresponding surface energy values with respect to the carrier liquid 108 that may cause the particles thereof to self-segregate in the liquid paint coating upon standing. For example, the charge storage material 102 may be characterized by a first surface energy differential versus the carrier liquid 108. According to the first surface energy differential, the charge storage material 102 may self-segregate in the carrier liquid 108 on standing. The charge storage material 102 may self-segregate in the carrier liquid 108 at a first average depth 202 from an air-liquid interface 208 of the liquid paint coating 100 to leave at least a portion of the charge storage material located at the air-liquid interface 208. Also, for example, the charge transporter material 104 may be characterized by a second surface energy differential versus the carrier liquid 108. The second surface energy differential may be less than the first surface energy differential. According to the second surface energy differential, the charge transporter material 104 may self-segregate in the carrier liquid 108 at a second average depth 204 from the air-liquid interface 208 of the liquid paint coating 100. According to the lower value of the second surface energy differential and the first surface energy differential, the second average depth 204 may be greater than the first average depth 202. Further, for example, the charge photo-ejector material 106 may be characterized by a third surface energy differential with respect to the carrier liquid 108 that is less than the first surface energy differential. The charge transporter material 106 may self-segregate at a third average depth 206 from the air-liquid interface 208 of the liquid paint coating 100. The third average depth 206 may be greater than the first average depth 202. In some examples, the third average depth 206 may be greater than the second average depth 204 and/or the first average depth 202. In various examples, the carrier liquid 108 and/or the binder 109 in the liquid paint may be configured to dry or cure to form the photo-wettable painted coatings 101. The photo-wettable painted coatings 101 may include an air-coating interface 208′ corresponding to the air-liquid interface 208. The photo-wetted painted coatings 101 may include a first average depth 202′ of the charge storage particles 102, a second average depth 204′ of the charge transporter particles 104, and a third average depth 206′ of the photo-ejector particles 106. In some examples, the first, second, and third average depths 202′, 204′, and 206′ with respect to the air-coating interface 208′ may correspond to or may be different from the first, second, and third average depths 202, 204, and 206 with respect to the air-liquid interface 208. For example, the first, second, and third average depths 202′, 204′, and 206′ may be less than the first, second, and third average depths 202, 204, and 206 due to drying of the carrier liquid 108. In several examples, the first, second, and third average depths 202′, 204′, and 206′ may be greater than the first, second, and third average depths 202, 204, and 206, for example, due to curing of the binder 109. FIG. 3 is a conceptual drawing that represents various example bi-layer and tri-layer particles including two or more of the charge photo-ejector material 106, the charge transporter material 104, and the charge storage material 102, all arranged in accordance with at least some embodiments described herein. For example, bi-layer particle 300 represents a partial layer or coating of charge storage material 102 on charge transporter material 104. Bi-layer particle 302 represents a partial layer or coating of photo-ejector material 106 on charge transporter material 104. Tri-layer particle 304 represents a partial layer or coating of charge storage material 102 and a partial layer or coating of photo-ejector material 106 at least in part located on opposite sides of charge transporter material 104. Such hi-layer and tri-layer particles may be made by well-known techniques for forming partly coated microparticles. For example, particles of charge transporter material 104 may be partly embedded in a soft polymer matrix such as polydimethyl siloxane by roll printing. The exposed surfaces of the charge transporter material 104 may be coated by one or the other of the photo-ejector material 106 or the charge storage material 102 and released to form the bilayer particles 302 or 300, respectively. Alternatively, instead of releasing, the bi-layer particles 302 or 300 may be embedded in a second soft polymer matrix and removed from the first polymer matrix. The newly exposed surfaces of the charge transporter material 104 may then be coated with the other of the photo-ejector material 106 or the charge storage material 102 and released to form the tri-layer particles 304. Such hi-layer 300,302 and/or tri-layer 304 particles may be configured to self-orient to place the corresponding materials in substantially the same relative order versus surfaces such as the air-liquid interface 208 or the air-coating interface 208′ as for the individual material particles shown in FIGS. 1A, 1B, and 2. In some examples, performance of the photo-wetting coatings may be improved versus the individual material particles shown in FIGS. 1A, 1B, and 2 according to the intimate contact of the layered materials in the bi-layer 300,302 and/or tri-layer 304 particles. In several examples, formation of the photo-wetting coatings may be improved where self-orientation of the bi-layer 300,302 and/or tri-layer 304 particles may be simpler or more effective compared to self-segregation of the individual material particles shown in FIGS. 1A, 1B, and 2. FIG. 4 is a conceptual drawing that represents various example processes for coating an oleophilic and/or fluorophilic surface on one or more of the charge photo-ejector material 102, the charge transporter material 104, and the charge storage material 106, all arranged in accordance with at least some embodiments described herein. In particular, FIG. 4 represents covalent attachment of an alkyl or fluoroalkyl chain, represented by R, through well-known silyl ester forming reactions on the surface of silica. The oleophilic or fluorophilic surface may be applied to modify or provide a desired surface energy differential between any desired layer or particle described herein and the carrier liquid 108. For example, suitable charge storage materials 102 as described herein may include silica. Silica may be hydrophilic and may have relatively low surface energy. In many examples, it may be desirable to have a relatively high surface energy differential between the charge storage material 102 and the carrier liquid 108, which may not be achieved if the charge storage material is silica and the carrier liquid 108 includes water. An oleophilic or fluorophilic coating on the silica/charge storage material 102 may provide a greater surface energy differential versus water in the carrier liquid 108. In various examples, the oleophilic or fluorophilic coated silica may tend to self-orient or self-segregate towards the air-liquid interface in liquid paint coatings 100. The oleophilic or fluorophilic coatings may be applied by non-covalent coating, or covalent chemical reaction as depicted in FIG. 4. Advantageously, since charge storage materials may include fluoropolymers and fluoroalkyl groups as described herein, attachment of a fluoroallkyl silyl ester layer to a silica particle may provide an effective composite charge storage material 102. Example embodiments may also include methods of manufacturing the liquid paint as described herein. These techniques may be implemented in any number of ways, including the structures described herein. One such way may be by machine operations, of devices of the type described in the present disclosure. Another optional way may be for one or more of the individual operations of the methods to be performed in conjunction with one or more human operators performing some of the operations while other operations may be performed by machines. The various human operators need not be collocated with each other, and instead each operated cal be located about one or more machines that perform a portion of the operations. In other examples, the human interaction may be automated such as by pre-selected criteria that may be machine automated. FIG. 5 is a block diagram that represents various example automated machines 500 that may be used in the various techniques to manufacture the liquid paint, all arranged in accordance with at least some embodiments described herein. As illustrated in FIG. 5, a manufacturing controller 590 may be coupled to the machines that may be employed to carry out the operations described in FIG. 6, for example: a mixing chamber 592; a particle manipulator 593; a carrier fluid source 594; a photo-ejector material source 595; a charge transporter material source 596; a charge storage material source 597; a reagent source 598; and a particle coating apparatus 599. Manufacturing controller 590 may be operated by human control, by a remote controller 570 via network 510, or by machine executed instructions such as might be found in a computer program. Data associated with controlling the different processes of manufacturing the liquid paint may be stored at and/or received from data stores 580. Further, the individual elements of manufacturing system 500 may be implemented as any suitable device configured in any suitable fashion for carrying out the operations described herein. For example, particle manipulator 593 may be a colloid deposition apparatus which may be stationary or may include a sample stage with one or more moving functions, such as translation in zero, one, two, or three perpendicular axes, rotation in one, two, or three perpendicular axes, or combinations thereof. Such moving functions may be provided by motors, linear actuators, or piezoelectric actuators. Likewise, particle coater 599 may be configured for any approach for depositing a reagent such as an oleophilic or fluorophilic coating precursor from reagent source 598, such as by mixing, spraying, condensing, inkjet printing, or the like. Additionally or alternatively, particle manipulator and/or particle coater 599 may be employed in combination with the respective material sources 595, 596, and 597 to prepare the bi-layer or tri-layer particles by partly coating a collection of core particles of the charge transporter material with a layer of one or both of the photo-ejector material and/or the charge storage material. Similarly, the photo-ejector material source 595; the charge transporter material source 596; and the charge storage material source 597 may be configured to provide the respective materials as particles or as coatable compositions or reagents, depending on the desired particle to be formed, such as the bi-layer and tri-layer particles described herein. Further, the mixing chamber 592 and carrier fluid source 594 may be employed to contact particles of the respective materials with the liquid to form the liquid paint as described herein. FIG. 6 is a flow diagram showing example blocks that may be used in various example techniques to manufacture the liquid paint, all arranged in accordance with at least some embodiments described herein. A process to manufacture liquid paint as described herein may include one or more operations, functions or actions as is illustrated by one or more of operations 622, 624, 626, and/or 628. An example technique to manufacture liquid paint as described herein may be operated by a controller device 610, which may be embodied as computing device 800 in FIG. 8 or a special purpose controller such as manufacturing controller 590 of FIG. 5, or similar devices configured to execute instructions stored in computer-readable medium 620 for controlling the performance of the technique. Example methods may include one or more operations to manufacture liquid paint. The computer-executable instructions may be executed by the controller device 610 in order to perform the operations of FIG. 6. Some example processes may begin with operation 628, “MIX AT LEAST ONE CARRIER LIQUID TOGETHER WITH AT LEAST ONE EACH OF THE CHARGE PHOTO-EJECTOR, THE CHARGE TRANSPORTER, AND THE CHARGE STORAGE MATERIAL TO FORM A LIQUID PAINT.” Operation 628 may be performed, for example, by employing the mixing chamber 592 and carrier fluid source 594 to contact particles of the respective materials with the liquid to form the liquid paint as described herein. Operation 628 may be preceded by any of optional operations 622, 624, and/or 628, or any other technique operations described herein. For example, operation 628 may be preceded by optional operation 626, “APPLY AN OLEOPHILIC AND/OR A FLUOROPHILIC COATING TO THE CHARGE STORAGE MATERIAL.” Optional operation 626 may include contacting a coating of the oleophilic or fluorophilic coating to the respective materials, for example, by providing the coating precursor from the reagent source 598 to the particle coater 599. Optional operation 626 may be applied to the charge storage material alone, or the charge storage material as included in the optional bi-layer or tri-layer particles, prepared in optional operations 622 and/or 624. Optional operation 626 may be preceded by optional operation 622, “FORM BI-LAYER PARTICLES BY CONTACTING A CHARGE TRANSPORTER MATERIAL TO A CHARGE PHOTO-EJECTOR MATERIAL OR A CHARGE STORAGE MATERIAL.” Optional operation 622 may include, for example, providing the charge transporter, charge storage, or charge photo-ejector materials from the respective material sources 595, 596, or 597 to the particle manipulator. Optional operation 622 may include, for example, employing the particle manipulator 593 to partly embed charge transporter particles into a polymeric surface such that each of the particles includes an embedded and an exposed surface. Optional operation 622 may include, for example, employing the particle coater 599 to coat a layer of the charge storage material and/or the charge photo-ejector material on the charge transporter material to provide the bi-layer particles.

In many examples, the painted article may include a collection of bi-layer particles that each may include a layer of the charge transporter material in contact with a layer of the charge photo-ejector material. The collection of bi-layer particles may be characterized by a net orientation such that the layer of the layer of the charge transporter material on the collection of bi-layer particles may be directed towards the air-coating interface to a greater extent compared to the layer of the charge photo-ejector material on the collection of bi-layer particles. The collection of bi-layer particles may be located at a second average depth from the air-coating interface that may be greater than the first average depth.

The terms “a” and “an” as used herein mean “one or more” unless the singular is expressly specified. For example, reference to “a base” may include a mixture of two or more bases, as well as a single base. As used herein, “about” will be understood by persons of ordinary skill in the art and will vary to some extent depending upon the context in which it is used. If there are uses of the term which are not clear to persons of ordinary skill in the art, given the context in which it is used, “about” will mean up to, plus or minus 10% of the particular term. As used herein, the terms “optional” and “optionally” mean that the subsequently described circumstance may or may not occur, so that the description includes instances where the circumstance occurs and instances where it does not. EXAMPLES Example 1 Formation of a Three-Particle Liquid Paint A liquid water base may be combined with 2% by weight of a water soluble epoxy binder. Equal volumes of three particle distributions may be obtained, each having average particle diameters of about 10 micrometers. The particle distributions may include: copper-diselenium [Cu(In,GA)Se2] as a photo-ejector material; titanium dioxide as a charge transporter material, precoated with a light hydrophobic layer; and fluoroalkyl-treated silica as a charge storage material. The titanium dioxide particles may be precoated with a light layer of paraffin by mixing into a 0.01% solution of paraffin in pentane, about 0.01% paraffin by weight versus the titanium dioxide. The particles and solution may be mixed and the pentane evaporated to leave the titanium dioxide particle distribution with a light hydrophobic coating of paraffin. The three particle distributions may be each added at a volume fraction versus the liquid water base of about 1% each by volume. A white latex base and desired pigment may be added. The mixture may be stirred thoroughly to form a liquid paint ready for application. Example 2 Formation of a Tri-Layer Particle Liquid Paint Titanium dioxide-silica particles having average particle diameters of about 10 micrometers may be obtained (JGC Catalysts and Chemicals, Ltd, Kawasaki City, Japan). The particles may be dried in an oven for 2 hours at 100° C., cooled, and suspended in an equal weight of dry tetrahydrofuran. Based on the silica surface area of the titanium dioxide-silica particles, slightly submolar amount of 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorooctyl triethoxysilane (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo.) may be added and the mixture may be stirred for 4 hours to form a suspension of fluoroalkyl-functionalized titanium dioxide-silica particles. An equal mass of triscarboxy-ruthenium terpyridine [Ru(4,4′,4″-(COOH)3-terpy)(NCS)3] may be dissolved in a minimum amount of dry tetrahydrofuran and may be added to the suspension of fluoroalkyl-functionalized titanium dioxide-silica particles. The mixture may be stirred for 1 hour to allow the ruthenium complex to adsorb to the titanium dioxide. The ruthenium complex may adsorb preferentially to the titanium dioxide because the silica portion of the particles may be coated with the fluoroalkyl groups. The solvent may be then removed under reduced pressure to leave a collection of the tri-layer particles. The tri-layer particles may include a layer of the ruthenium dye as a photoejector material adsorbed on titanium dioxide as a charge transport material, capped by the fluoroalkyl-substituted silica as a charge storage layer. The collection of tri-layer particles may be added to a liquid water base that includes 2% of a water soluble epoxy binder. The collection of tri-layer particles may be added at a volume fraction versus the liquid water base of about 2% by volume. A white latex base and desired pigment may be added. The mixture may be stirred thoroughly to form a second liquid paint ready for application. Example 3 Formation of a Photo-Wettable Painted Article Using the Three-Particle Liquid Paint A coupon of exterior grade plywood may be obtained, painted with a primer base and allowed to dry. The three particle liquid paint of Example 1 may be mixed thoroughly and a single coat may be painted on the primer base on the plywood coupon. Upon painting, the three types of particles in the liquid paint may self-segregate. The fluorinated silica may rise to the air-liquid interface of the paint. The titanium dioxide precoated with a light hydrophobic layer may rise, settling below the fluorinated silica layer. The copper-diselenium [Cu(In,GA)Se2] particles may settle below the titanium dioxide layer. The liquid paint may be allowed to dry/cure to form a photo-wettable painted coating on top of the primer-coated plywood coupon. Example 4 Formation of a Photo-Wettable Painted Article Using the Tri-Layer Particle Liquid Paint A coupon of exterior grade plywood may be obtained, painted with a primer base and allowed to dry. The tri-layer particle liquid paint of Example 2 may be mixed thoroughly and a single coat may be painted on the primer base on the plywood coupon. Upon painting, the tri-layer particles may self-orient to place the charge storage fluoroalkyl substituted silica layer at the air-liquid surface of the liquid paint. The photo-ejector ruthenium dye layer may point into the paint, away from the air-liquid surface. The charge transporting titanium dioxide layer may be sandwiched between the fluorinated silica layer and the adsorbed ruthenium dye layer. The liquid paint may be allowed to dry/cure to form a photo-wettable painted coating on top of the primer-coated plywood coupon. Example 5 The Photo-Wettable Painted Article May Display Photo-Wetting Behavior The painted plywood coupon of Example 3 or Example 4 may be placed in low-light, static discharging conditions and allowed to equilibrate. Next, a goniometer may be employed to measure the contact angle of water at the painted surface. The contact angle may be measured at a relatively hydrophobic angle of less than 90 degrees. Next, the painted plywood coupon may be exposed to sunlight for 1 hour. The contact angle of the water may be monitored by the goniometer as a function of time. The contact angle of the water may increase over time with the sunlight illumination until a relatively hydrophobic angle of greater than about 130 degrees may be reached. The painted coupon may then be protected from sunlight. The contact angle of the water may continue to be monitored by the goniometer as a function of time. The goniometer may show that the contact angle of the water decreases over time and may return to the original relatively hydrophobic angle of less than 90 degrees. There is little distinction left between hardware and software implementations of aspects of systems; the use of hardware or software is generally (but not always, in that in certain contexts the choice between hardware and software may become significant) a design choice representing cost vs. efficiency tradeoffs. There are various vehicles by which processes and/or systems and/or other technologies described herein may be effected (for example, hardware, software, and/or firmware), and that the preferred vehicle will vary with the context in which the processes and/or systems and/or other technologies are deployed. For example, if an implementer determines that speed and accuracy are paramount, the implementer may opt for a mainly hardware and/or firmware vehicle; if flexibility is paramount, the implementer may opt for a mainly software implementation; or, yet again alternatively, the implementer may opt for some combination of hardware, software, and/or firmware. The foregoing detailed description has set forth various embodiments of the devices and/or processes via the use of block diagrams, flowcharts, and/or examples. Insofar as such block diagrams, flowcharts, and/or examples contain one or more functions and/or operations, it will be understood by those within the art that each function and/or operation within such block diagrams, flowcharts, or examples may be implemented, individually and/or collectively, by a wide range of hardware, software, firmware, or virtually any combination thereof. In one embodiment, several portions of the subject matter described herein may be implemented via Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), digital signal processors (DSPs), or other integrated formats. However, those skilled in the art will recognize that some aspects of the embodiments disclosed herein, in whole or in part, may be equivalently implemented in integrated circuits, as one or more computer programs running on one or more computers (for example, as one or more programs running on one or more computer systems), as one or more programs running on one or more processors (for example as one or more programs running on one or more microprocessors), as firmware, or as virtually any combination thereof, and that designing the circuitry and/or writing the code for the software and or firmware would be well within the skill of one of skill in the art in light of this disclosure. The present disclosure is not to be limited in terms of the particular embodiments described in this application, which are intended as illustrations of various aspects. Many modifications and variations may be made without departing from its spirit and scope, as will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Functionally equivalent methods and apparatuses within the scope of the disclosure, in addition to those enumerated herein, will be apparent to those skilled in the art from the foregoing descriptions. Such modifications and variations are intended to fall within the scope of the appended claims. The present disclosure is to be limited only by the terms of the appended claims, along with the full scope of equivalents to which such claims are entitled. It is to be understood that this disclosure is not limited to particular methods, systems, or components, which can, of course, vary. It is also to be understood that the terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only, and is not intended to be limiting. In addition, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the mechanisms of the subject matter described herein are capable of being distributed as a program product in a variety of forms, and that an illustrative embodiment of the subject matter described herein applies regardless of the particular type of signal bearing medium used to actually carry out the distribution. Examples of a signal bearing medium include, but are not limited to, the following: a recordable type medium such as a floppy disk, a hard disk drive, a Compact Disc (CD), a Digital Versatile Disk (DVD), a digital tape, a computer memory, etc.; and a transmission type medium such as a digital and/or an analog communication medium (for example, a fiber optic cable, a waveguide, a wired communications link, a wireless communication link, etc.). Those skilled in the art will recognize that it is common within the art to describe devices and/or processes in the fashion set forth herein, and thereafter use engineering practices to integrate such described devices and/or processes into data processing systems. That is, at least a portion of the devices and/or processes described herein may be integrated into a data processing system via a reasonable amount of experimentation. Those having skill in the art will recognize that a typical data processing system generally includes one or more of a system unit housing, a video display device, a memory such as volatile and non-volatile memory, processors such as microprocessors and digital signal processors, computational entities such as operating systems, drivers, graphical user interfaces, and applications programs, one or more interaction devices, such as a touch pad or screen, and/or control systems including feedback loops. A typical manufacturing system may be implemented utilizing any suitable commercially available components, such as those sometimes found in data computing/communication and/or network computing/communication systems. The herein described subject matter sometimes illustrates different components contained within, or coupled together with, different other components. It is to be understood that such depicted architectures are merely exemplary, and that in fact many other architectures may be implemented which achieve the same functionality. In a conceptual sense, any arrangement of components to achieve the same functionality is effectively “associated” such that the desired functionality is achieved. Hence, any two components herein combined to achieve a particular functionality may be seen as “associated with” each other such that the desired functionality is achieved, irrespective of architectures or intermediate components. Likewise, any two components so associated may also be viewed as being “operably connected”, or “operably coupled”, to each other to achieve the desired functionality, and any two components capable of being so associated may also be viewed as being “operably couplable”, to each other to achieve the desired functionality. Specific examples of operably couplable include but are not limited to physically connectable and/or physically interacting components and/or wirelessly interactable and/or wirelessly interacting components and/or logically interacting and/or logically interactable components. With respect to the use of substantially any plural and/or singular terms herein, those having skill in the art can translate from the plural to the singular and/or from the singular to the plural as is appropriate to the context and/or application. The various singular/plural permutations may be expressly set forth herein for sake of clarity. It will be understood by those within the art that, in general, terms used herein, and especially in the appended claims (for example, bodies of the appended claims) are generally intended as “open” terms (for example, the term “including” should be interpreted as “including but not limited to,” the term “having” should be interpreted as “having at least,” the term “includes” should be interpreted as “includes but is not limited to,” etc.). It will be further understood by those within the art that if a specific number of an introduced claim recitation is intended, such an intent will be explicitly recited in the claim, and in the absence of such recitation no such intent is present. For example, as an aid to understanding, the following appended claims may contain usage of the introductory phrases “at least one” and “one or more” to introduce claim recitations. However, the use of such phrases should not be construed to imply that the introduction of a claim recitation by the indefinite articles “a” or “an” limits any particular claim containing such introduced claim recitation to embodiments containing only one such recitation, even when the same claim includes the introductory phrases “one or more” or “at least one” and indefinite articles such as “a” or “an” (for example, “a” and/or “an” should be interpreted to mean “at least one” or “one or more”); the same holds true for the use of definite articles used to introduce claim recitations. In addition, even if a specific number of an introduced claim recitation is explicitly recited, those skilled in the art will recognize that such recitation should be interpreted to mean at least the recited number (for example, the bare recitation of “two recitations,” without other modifiers, means at least two recitations, or two or more recitations). Furthermore, in those instances where a convention analogous to “at least one of A, B, and C, etc.” is used, in general such a construction is intended in the sense one having skill in the art would understand the convention (for example, “a system having at least one of A, B, and C” would include but not be limited to systems that have A alone, B alone, C alone, A and B together, A and C together, B and C together, and/or A, B, and C together, etc.). It will be further understood by those within the art that virtually any disjunctive word and/or phrase presenting two or more alternative terms, whether in the description, claims, or drawings, should be understood to contemplate the possibilities of including one of the terms, either of the terms, or both terms. For example, the phrase “A or B” will be understood to include the possibilities of “A” or “B” or “A and B.” In addition, where features or aspects of the disclosure are described in terms of Markush groups, those skilled in the art will recognize that the disclosure is also thereby described in terms of any individual member or subgroup of members of the Markush group. As will be understood by one skilled in the art, for any and all purposes, such as in terms of providing a written description, all ranges disclosed herein also encompass any and all possible sub-ranges and combinations of sub-ranges thereof. Any listed range can be easily recognized as sufficiently describing and allowing the same range being broken down into at least equal halves, thirds, quarters, fifths, tenths, etc. As a non-limiting example, each range discussed herein can be readily broken down into a lower third, middle third and upper third, etc. As will also be understood by one skilled in the art all language such as “up to,” “at least,” “greater than,” “less than,” and the like include the number recited and refer to ranges which can be subsequently broken down into sub-ranges as discussed above. Finally, as will be understood by one skilled in the art, a range includes each individual member. For example, a group having 1-3 cells refers to groups having 1, 2, or 3 cells. Similarly, a group having 1-5 cells refers to groups having 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 cells, and so forth. While various aspects and embodiments have been disclosed herein, other aspects and embodiments will be apparent to those skilled in the art.
