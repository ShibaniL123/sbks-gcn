PRIORITY CLAIM This application claims priority to and the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61/979,284, filed on Apr. 14, 2014, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. BACKGROUND Hunters, particularly bow hunters, often rely on hunting from a tree stand at an elevated position to gain an advantage on an animal. To access a tree stand, it is necessary for the hunters to climb trees. It is commonplace for hunters to climb a tree to access a tree stand using tree steps that screw into the trunk of the tree and act as footholds (and handholds, in certain cases). Certain existing tree steps must be screwed into the tree trunks by hand. In other words, these existing tree steps require the use of manual force to rotate the tree step and screw it into the tree trunk. This is a repetitive, exhausting routine that must be performed for numerous tree steps as the hunter ascends the tree. This is also a dangerous routine, as it requires the hunters to generate enough force to manually screw the tree steps into the tree trunk at locations that get progressively higher off the ground, all while balancing themselves on existing tree steps and holding onto the tree. This is also a time-consuming routine, as hunters routinely spend hours hanging the requisite number of tree steps and, eventually, a tree stand. There is a continuing need for new and improved tree steps that solve the above-described problems. SUMMARY Various embodiments of the present disclosure provide a tree step including an integrated shank that solves the above-described problems. More specifically, in one embodiment, the tree step includes: a threaded tree attacher having a tapered, threaded free end; a bracing member extending transversely from the tree attacher; a step extending transversely from the bracing member; a support member extending transversely from the step; and a driver attachment member extending transversely from the support member and having a free end terminating in an integrated shank. In this embodiment, the tree attacher and the bracing member are substantially perpendicular, the bracing member and the step are substantially perpendicular, the step and the support member are substantially perpendicular, and the support member and the driver attachment member are substantially perpendicular. In this embodiment, the longitudinal axis of the tree attacher and the longitudinal axis of the driver attachment member are coaxial with one another and coaxial with a rotational axis, which is the axis about which the tree step rotates when being attached to a tree. Additionally, in this embodiment, the longitudinal axis of the step is parallel to, and offset from, the rotational axis. Further, in this embodiment, the longitudinal axis of the bracing member, the longitudinal axis of the support member, the rotational axis, the longitudinal axis of the tree attacher, the longitudinal axis of the step, and the longitudinal axis of the driver attachment member are coplanar. In operation of this embodiment, to attach the tree step to a tree, a user first attaches the tree step to a driver, such as a drill. Thereafter, to attach the tree step to the tree, the user engages the tree with the free end of the tree attacher and, while applying force toward the tree via the driver, activates the driver such that the driver rotates the tree step about the rotational axis and screws the threaded portion of the tree attacher into the tree. The driver screws the threaded portion of the tree attacher into the tree until the bracing member engages or contacts the tree, at which point the user deactivates the driver and detaches the tree step from the driver. If necessary, the user then adjusts (such as by rotating) the tree step such that the bracing member is in a substantially vertical orientation and extending transversely from the tree attacher toward the ground. Once the tree step is attached to the tree, the user may step on the step of the tree step. When the user steps on the step, the bracing member, which engages or contacts the tree, supports or braces the tree step against the tree such that the tree step does not pull out of the tree or sag under the user's weight. The support member prevents the user's foot from slipping outward and off of the tree step. The integrated shank of the tree step of the present disclosure thus enables the user to quickly and easily use a driver to screw the tree step into the tree, which eliminates the need to manually screw the tree step into the tree and speeds installation of tree steps. Additional features and advantages are described herein, and will be apparent from, the following Detailed Description and the Figures.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION Referring now to the drawings, FIGS. 1A, 1B, and 1C illustrate one example embodiment of the tree step of the present disclosure, which is generally indicated by numeral 10. In this example embodiment, the tree step 10 includes: (a) a threaded tree attacher 15 including (i) a tapered free end, and (ii) an opposing second end; (b) a bracing member 20 extending transversely from the tree attacher 15, the bracing member 20 including (i) a first end connected to the second end of the tree attacher 15, and (ii) a second opposing end; (c) a step 25 extending transversely from the bracing member 20, the step 25 including (i) a first end connected to the second end of the bracing member 20, (ii) and a second opposing end; (d) a support member 27 extending transversely from the step 25, the support member 27 including (i) a first end connected to the second end of the step 25, and (ii) an opposing second end; and (e) a driver attachment member 30 extending transversely from the support member 27, the driver attachment member 30 including (i) a first end connected to the second end of the support member 27, and (ii) an opposing free end terminating in an integrated shank. In this example embodiment, the tree attacher 15 and the bracing member 20 are substantially perpendicular, though it should be appreciated that, in other embodiments, the tree attacher 15 and the bracing member 20 are not perpendicular. Further, in this example embodiment, the bracing member 20 and the step 25 are substantially perpendicular, though it should be appreciated that, in other embodiments, the bracing member 20 and the step 25 are not perpendicular. Additionally, in this example embodiment, the step 25 and the support member 27 are substantially perpendicular, though it should be appreciated that, in other embodiments, the step 25 and the support member 27 are not perpendicular. Further, in this example embodiment, the support member 27 and the driver attachment member 30 are substantially perpendicular, though it should be appreciated that, in other embodiments, the support member 27 and the driver attachment member 30 are not perpendicular. In this example embodiment, the components of the tree step are generally cylindrically shaped, though it should be appreciated that such components may take any suitable shape, such as, but not limited to, a rectangular shape, a tubular shape, an oval shape, or a triangular shape. It should also be appreciated that, in this example embodiment, the components of the tree step are integrally formed with one another, though it should be appreciated that the components of the tree step are not integrally formed with one another in other embodiments. In this example embodiment, the longitudinal axis of the tree attacher 15 and the longitudinal axis of the driver attachment member 30 are coaxial with one another and coaxial with a rotational axis 50, which is the axis about which the tree step 10 rotates when being attached to a tree, as described below. Additionally, in this example embodiment, the longitudinal axis of the step 25 is parallel to, and offset from, the rotational axis 50 (and, therefore, the longitudinal axes of the tree attacher 15 and the driver attachment member 30). Further, in this example embodiment, the longitudinal axis of the bracing member 20, the longitudinal axis of the support member 27, the rotational axis 50, the longitudinal axis of the tree attacher 15, the longitudinal axis of the step 25, and the longitudinal axis of the driver attachment member 30 are coplanar. It should be appreciated that the integrated shank may be any suitable type of shank such as, but not limited to: (a) a straight shank, (b) a brace shank, (c) a hex shank, (d) a Special Direct System (SDS) shank, (e) a triangle shank, (f) a Morse taper shank, or (g) a square shank. It should also be appreciated that, in certain embodiments, the shape of the driver attachment member changes due to the particular type of shank that is employed. In other words, the shape of the driver attachment member changes when transitioning to the integrated shank at the free end. It should be appreciated that the tree step may be made of any suitable material that is sufficiently rigid, strong, and durable, such as metal (e.g., steel or aluminum); high-strength plastic (such as that suitable for use by a 3D printer); and the like. In certain embodiments, the outer surface of at least a portion of the step is roughened and/or grooved to enable better traction between a user's footwear and the step. In other embodiments, the outer surface of at least a portion of the step includes a coating (such as a rubber coating or a foam coating) that increases the coefficient of friction of the material of the step to enable better traction between a user's footwear and the step. In operation, to attach the tree step 10 to a tree, a user first attaches the tree step 10 to a driver. In one example embodiment, as shown in FIG. 1C, the driver is a cordless drill 35 including a chuck 40, though it should be appreciated that any other suitable driver may be employed, such as a corded drill, a cordless electric screwdriver, a corded electric screwdriver, and the like. More specifically, to attach the tree step 10 to the drill 35, the user: (1) loosens the chuck 40, (2) inserts a sufficient portion of the integrated shank of the driver attachment member 30 of the tree step 10 into the chuck 40, and (3) tightens the chuck 40 around the integrated shank. It should be appreciated that after the tree step 10 is attached to the drill 35, the drill 35 is configured to rotate the tree step 10 about the rotational axis 50. Thereafter, to attach the tree step 10 to the tree, the user engages the tree with the free end of the tree attacher 15 and, while applying force toward the tree via the drill 35, activates the drill 35 such that the drill 35 rotates the tree step 10 about the rotational axis 50 and screws the threaded portion of the tree attacher 15 into the tree. The drill 35 screws the threaded portion of the tree attacher 15 into the tree until the bracing member 20 engages or contacts the tree, at which point the user deactivates the drill 35 and detaches the tree step 10 from the drill 35. If necessary, the user then adjusts (such as by rotating) the tree step 10 such that the bracing member 20 is in a substantially vertical orientation and extending transversely from the tree attacher 15 toward the ground. FIG. 1D shows the tree step 10 after attachment to the tree. It should be appreciated that the user reverses the above-described process to detach the tree step 10 from the tree. Once the tree step 10 is attached to the tree, the user may step on the step 25 of the tree step 10. When the user steps on the step 25, the bracing member 20, which engages or contacts the tree, supports or braces the tree step 10 against the tree such that the tree step 10 does not pull out of the tree or sag under the user's weight. The support member 27 prevents the user's foot from slipping outward and off of the tree step. FIGS. 2A and 2B illustrate another example embodiment of the tree step of the present disclosure, which is generally indicated by numeral 100. In this example embodiment, the tree step 100 includes: (a) a threaded tree attacher 115 including (i) a tapered free end, and (ii) an opposing second end; (b) a curved bracing member 120 extending transversely from the tree attacher 115, the bracing member 120 including (i) a first end connected to the second end of the tree attacher 15, and (ii) a second opposing end; (c) a step 125 extending transversely from the bracing member 120, the step 125 including (i) a first end connected to the second end of the bracing member 120, (ii) and a second opposing end; (d) a curved support member 127 extending from the step 125, the support member 127 including (i) a first end connected to the second end of the step 125, and (ii) an opposing second end; and (e) a driver attachment member 130 extending from the support member 127, the driver attachment member 130 including (i) a first end connected to the second end of the support member 127, and (ii) an opposing free end terminating in an integrated shank. It should be appreciated that, in this example embodiment, the components of the tree step are integrally formed with one another. In this example embodiment, the longitudinal axis of the tree attacher 115, the longitudinal axis of the step 125, and the longitudinal axis of the driver attachment member 130 are coaxial with one another and coaxial with a rotational axis 150, which is the axis about which the tree step 110 rotates when being attached to a tree, as described below. In operation, to attach the tree step 100 to a tree, a user first attaches the tree step 100 to a driver, as described above, such that the driver is configured to rotate the tree step 100 about the rotational axis 150. Thereafter, to attach the tree step 100 to a tree, the user engages the tree with the free end of the tree attacher 115 and, while applying force toward the tree via the driver, activates the driver such that the driver rotates the tree step 100 about the rotational axis 150 and screws the threaded portion of the tree attacher 115 into the tree. The driver screws the threaded portion of the tree attacher 115 into the tree until the bracing member 120 engages or contacts the tree, at which point the user deactivates the driver and detaches the tree step 100 from the driver. If necessary, the user then adjusts (such as by rotating) the tree step 100 such that the bracing member 120 is in a substantially vertical orientation and extending transversely from the tree attacher 115 toward the ground. It should be appreciated that the user reverses the above-described process to detach the tree step 100 from the tree. Once the tree step 100 is attached to the tree, the user may step on the step 125 of the tree step 100. When the user steps on the step 125, the bracing member 120, which engages or contacts the tree, supports or braces the tree step 100 against the tree such that the tree step 100 does not pull out of the tree or sag under the user's weight. The support member 127 prevents the user's foot from slipping outward and off of the tree step. FIGS. 3A and 3B illustrate another example embodiment of the tree step of the present disclosure, which is generally indicated by numeral 200. In this example embodiment, the tree step 200 includes: (a) a body 201; (b) a bracing member 220 extending transversely from the body 201, the bracing member 220 including (i) a first end connected to the body 201, and (ii) an opposing free end; and (c) a support member 227 extending from the body 201 at an angle, the support member 220 including (i) a first end connected to the body 201, and (ii) an opposing free end. The body 201 includes: (a) a tapered, threaded tree attacher 215 at a first end; (b) an integrated shank 230 at an opposing second end; and (c) a step 225 therebetween. In this example embodiment, the first end of the bracing member 220 connects to the body 201 between the tree attacher 215 and the step 225, and the first end of the support member 227 connects to the body 201 between the step 225 and the integrated shank 230. In this example embodiment, the longitudinal axis of the base 201 (and, therefore, the longitudinal axes of the tree attacher 215, the step 225, and the integrated shank 230) is coaxial with a rotational axis 250, which is the axis about which the tree step 200 rotates when being attached to a tree, as described below. Additionally, in this example embodiment, the longitudinal axis of the bracing member 220 is substantially perpendicular to, and coplanar with, the rotational axis 250 and the longitudinal axis of the body 201. In operation, to attach the tree step 200 to a tree, a user first attaches the tree step 200 to a driver, as described above, such that the driver is configured to rotate the tree step 200 about the rotational axis 250. Thereafter, to attach the tree step 200 to a tree, the user engages the tree with the free end of the tree attacher 215 and, while applying force toward the tree via the driver, activates the driver such that the driver rotates the tree step 200 about the rotational axis 250 and screws the threaded portion of the tree attacher 215 into the tree. The driver screws the threaded portion of the tree attacher 215 into the tree until the bracing member 220 engages or contacts the tree, at which point the user deactivates the driver and detaches the tree step 200 from the driver. If necessary, the user then adjusts (such as by rotating) the tree step 200 such that the bracing member 220 is in a substantially vertical orientation and extending transversely from the tree attacher 215 toward the ground. It should be appreciated that the user reverses the above-described process to detach the tree step 200 from the tree. Once the tree step 200 is attached to the tree, the user may step on the step 225 of the tree step 200. When the user steps on the step 225, the bracing member 220, which engages or contacts the tree, supports or braces the tree step 200 against the tree such that the tree step 200 does not pull out of the tree or sag under the user's weight. The support member 227 prevents the user's foot from slipping outward and off of the tree step. FIGS. 4A and 4B illustrate another example embodiment of the tree step of the present disclosure, which is generally indicated by numeral 300. In this example embodiment, the tree step 300 includes: (a) a body 301; and (b) a bracing member 320 extending transversely from the body 301, the bracing member 320 including (i) a first end connected to the body 301, and (ii) an opposing free end. The body 301 includes: (a) a tapered, threaded tree attacher 315 at a first end; (b) a step 325 extending from and connected to the tree attacher 315; (c) a curved support member 327 extending from and connected to the step 325; and (d) a driver attachment member 330 extending from and connected to the support member 327 and terminating in an integrated shank. In this example embodiment, the first end of the bracing member 320 connects to the body 301 between the tree attacher 315 and the step 325. In this example embodiment, the components of the body 301 are integrally formed. In this example embodiment, the longitudinal axis of the base 301 (and, therefore, the longitudinal axes of the tree attacher 315, the step 325, and the integrated shank 330) is coaxial with a rotational axis 350, which is the axis about which the tree step 300 rotates when being attached to a tree, as described below. Additionally, in this example embodiment, the longitudinal axis of the bracing member 320 is substantially perpendicular to, and coplanar with, the rotational axis 350 and the longitudinal axis of the body 301. In operation, to attach the tree step 300 to a tree, a user first attaches the tree step 300 to a driver, as described above, such that the driver is configured to rotate the tree step 300 about the rotational axis 350. Thereafter, to attach the tree step 300 to a tree, the user engages the tree with the free end of the tree attacher 315 and, while applying force toward the tree via the driver, activates the driver such that the driver rotates the tree step 300 about the rotational axis 350 and screws the threaded portion of the tree attacher 315 into the tree. The driver screws the threaded portion of the tree attacher 315 into the tree until the bracing member 320 engages or contacts the tree, at which point the user deactivates the driver and detaches the tree step 300 from the driver. If necessary, the user then adjusts (such as by rotating) the tree step 300 such that the bracing member 320 is in a substantially vertical orientation and extending downward from the tree attacher 315. It should be appreciated that the user reverses the above-described process to detach the tree step 300 from the tree. Once the tree step 300 is attached to the tree, the user may step on the step 325 of the tree step 300. When the user steps on the step 325, the bracing member 320, which engages or contacts the tree, supports or braces the tree step 300 against the tree such that the tree step 300 does not pull out of the tree or sag under the user's weight. The support member 327 prevents the user's foot from slipping outward and off of the tree step. FIGS. 5A, 5B, and 5C illustrate another example embodiment of the tree step of the present disclosure, which is generally indicated by numeral 400. In this example embodiment, the tree step 400 includes: (a) a body 401; and (b) a disc-shaped bracing member 420 attached to the body 401. The body 401 includes: (a) a threaded tree attacher 415 at a first end, (b) a step 425 extending from and connected to the tree attacher 415, (c) a curved support member 427 extending from and connected to the step 425, and (d) an integrated shank 430 at a second end opposite the first end. In this example embodiment, the bracing member 420 is attached to the body 401 between the tree attacher 415 and the step 425. In this example embodiment, the bracing member 420 is welded to the body 401, though it should be appreciated that the bracing member 420 may be attached to the body 401 in any other suitable manner. It should be appreciated that, in this example embodiment, the components of the body 401 are integrally formed. In this example embodiment, the longitudinal axis of the base 401 (and, therefore, the longitudinal axes of the tree attacher 415, the step 425, and the integrated shank 430) is coaxial with a rotational axis 450, which is the axis about which the tree step 400 rotates when being attached to a tree, as described below. Additionally, in this example embodiment, the bracing member 420 is substantially perpendicular to the rotational axis 450 and the longitudinal axis of the body 401. In operation, to attach the tree step 400 to a tree, a user first attaches the tree step 400 to a driver, as described above, such that the driver is configured to rotate the tree step 400 about the rotational axis 450. Thereafter, to attach the tree step 400 to a tree, the user engages the tree with the free end of the tree attacher 415 and, while applying force toward the tree via the driver, activates the driver such that the driver rotates the tree step 400 about the rotational axis 450 and screws the threaded portion of the tree attacher 415 into the tree. The driver screws the threaded portion of the tree attacher 415 into the tree until the bracing member 420 engages or contacts the tree, at which point the user deactivates the driver and detaches the tree step 400 from the driver. Since the bracing member 420 is disc-shaped in this example embodiment, the user need not adjust the tree step 400 after attachment to ensure that it is in a proper orientation for use. It should be appreciated that the user reverses the above-described process to detach the tree step 400 from the tree. Once the tree step 400 is attached to the tree, the user may step on the step 425 of the tree step 400. When the user steps on the step 425, the bracing member 420, which engages or contacts the tree, supports or braces the tree step 400 against the tree such that the tree step 400 does not pull out of the tree or sag under the user's weight. The support member 427 prevents the user's foot from slipping outward and off of the tree step. FIGS. 6A and 6B illustrate another example embodiment of the tree step of the present disclosure, which is generally indicated by numeral 500. In this example embodiment, the tree step 500 includes: (a) a threaded tree attacher 515 including (i) a tapered free end, and (ii) an opposing second end; (b) a bracing member 520 extending transversely from the tree attacher 515, the bracing member 520 including (i) a first end connected to the second end of the tree attacher 515, and (ii) a second opposing end; (c) a foothold support connected to the bracing member 520; (d) a support member 527 including a first end connected to the foothold support and a second opposing end; and (e) a driver attachment member 530 extending transversely from the support member 527, the driver attachment member 530 including (i) a first end connected to the second end of the support member 527, and (ii) an opposing free end terminating in an integrated shank. The foothold support includes: (a) a first component 521 extending transversely from the bracing member 520 the first component 521 including (i) a first end connected to the second end of the bracing member 520, and (ii) an opposing second end; (b) a second component 525 extending transversely from the first component 521, the second component 525 including (i) a first end connected to the second end of the first component 521, and (ii) a second end; and (c) a third component 526 extending transversely from the second component 525, the third component 526 including (i) a first end connected to the second end of the second component 525, and (ii) a second end connected to the first end of the support member 527. In this example embodiment, the longitudinal axis of the tree attacher 515 and the longitudinal axis of the driver attachment member 530 are coaxial with one another and coaxial with a rotational axis 550, which is the axis about which the tree step 500 rotates when being attached to a tree, as described below. Additionally, in this example embodiment, the longitudinal axis of the second component 525 of the foothold support is parallel to, and offset from, the rotational axis 550 (and, therefore, parallel to and offset from the longitudinal axes of the tree attacher 515 and the driver attachment member 530). Further, in this example embodiment, the longitudinal axis of the bracing member 520, the longitudinal axis of the support member 527, the rotational axis 550, the longitudinal axis of the tree attacher 515, and the longitudinal axis of the driver attachment member 530 are coplanar. Additionally, in this example embodiment, the longitudinal axis of the first component 521 of the foothold support and the longitudinal axis of the third component 526 of the foothold support are substantially perpendicular to, and coplanar with, the longitudinal axis of the second component 525 of the foothold support. Further, the longitudinal axis of the first component 521 of the foothold support is substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the bracing member 520, and the longitudinal axis of the third component 526 of the foothold support is perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the support 527. As shown in FIG. 6B, the tree attacher 515 includes a foothold 540 that is attachable to the tree step 500 via the foothold support. Specifically, in this example embodiment, the foothold 540 is attachable to one or more of the first component 521, the second component 525, and the third component 526 of the foothold support. It should be appreciated the foothold 540 may be attached to the foothold support in any suitable manner such as, but not limited to: (a) via one or more fasteners (such as screws or bolts), (b) via a snap-fit, (c) via a press-fit or an interference-fit, or (d) via a hook-and-loop type fastener. In operation, to attach the tree step 500 to a tree, a user first attaches the tree step 500 to a driver, as described above. Thereafter, to attach the tree step 500 to a tree, the user engages the tree with the free end of the tree attacher 515 and, while applying force toward the tree via the driver, activates the driver such that the driver rotates the tree step 500 about the rotational axis 550 and screws the threaded portion of the tree attacher 515 into the tree. The driver screws the threaded portion of the tree attacher 515 into the tree until the bracing member 520 engages or contacts the tree, at which point the user deactivates the driver and detaches the tree step 500 from the driver. If necessary, the user then adjusts (such as by rotating) the tree step 500 such that the bracing member 520 is in a substantially vertical orientation and extending transversely from the tree attacher 515 toward the ground. It should be appreciated that the user reverses the above-described process to detach the tree step 500 from the tree. Once the tree step 500 is attached to the tree, the user may attach the foothold 540 to the foothold support (if not already attached), and step on the foothold 540 of the tree step 500. When the user steps on the foothold 540, the bracing member 520, which engages or contacts the tree, supports or braces the tree step 500 against the tree such that the tree step 500 does not pull out of the tree or sag under the user's weight. The support 527 prevents the user's foot from slipping outward and off of the tree step. FIGS. 7A and 7B illustrate another example embodiment of the tree step of the present disclosure, which is generally indicated by numeral 600. The tree step 600 is similar to the tree step 500 described above with respect to FIGS. 6A and 6B, but includes a step support extending to either side of the rotational axis, which reduces the likelihood that the tree step 600 will rotate when stepped on by a user. It should be understood that various changes and modifications to the presently preferred embodiments described herein will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Such changes and modifications can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the present subject matter and without diminishing its intended advantages. It is therefore intended that such changes and modifications be covered by the appended claims. 1.
