HETEROCYCLIC COMPOUNDS AS AXL INHIBITORS Field of the Invention [01] The present application is in general in the field of medicinal chemistry and specifically related to compounds that are protein kinase inhibitors, such as AXL inhibitors. These compounds are useful for treating disease and conditions (e.g., cancers) that are mediated by such protein kinases as AXL. Background of the Invention [02] Human genome contains 20 families of 58 receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) that undergo dimerization, autophosphorylation, and activation upon ligand binding, consequently activating downstream intracellular signaling cascades. RTKs regulate diverse cellular processes such as mitogenesis, cell cycle, growth, differentiation and development, survival and apoptosis, cell shape and adhesion, migration, and angiogenesis. Dysregulation or mutations in RTKs can induce aberrant activity and lead to a broad spectrum of human diseases (H ubbard, S. and Till, J., Annu Rev Biochem, 69: 373-398, 2000). TAM is a subfamily of RTKs comprised of the related TYRO-3, AXL, and MER. The TAM RTKs are defined by unique tandem immunoglobin-like repeats and dual fibronectin type II I repeats in the extracellular region, and can be activated by a common ligand of growth arrest-specific 6 (Gas 6). [03] AXL is ubiquitously expressed in a wide variety of organs and cells, including the hippocampus and cerebellum, monocytes, macrophages, platelets, endothelial cells, heart, skeletal muscle, liver, kidney, and testis. Activation of AXL in cells leads to activating the anti- apoptotic/survival PI3K/Akt and the mitogenic Ras/Raf/Mek/Erk cascade signaling pathways that promote cell growth, proliferation, and motility in general (Verma, A., et al, Mol Cancer Ther, 10:1763-1773, 2011). In cells and tissues, these AXL-stimulated intracellular signaling pathways regulate different aspects of physiological functions. Angiogenesis is the formation of new blood vessels by endothelial cells. Gas 6 is widely expressed in human endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells. Activation of AXL by Gas 6 in these cells regulates angiopoietin signaling system and stimulates the proliferation and migration of endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells, thereby controlling the tube formation and vascular regression, vascular homeostasis, and angiogenesis (Fridell, Y, et al, J Biol Chem, 273:7123-6, 1998; Holland, S., et al, Cancer Res, 65:9294-303, 2005). AXL signaling also plays important roles in immunity (Lu, Q. and Lemke, G., Science, 293:306-311, 2001; Scott, R., et al, Nature, 411:207-211, 2001), platelet function (Angelillo-Scherrer, A., et al, Nat Med, 7:215-221, 2001), and kidney functions (Yanagita, M., et al, J Clin Invest, 110:239-246, 2002). [04] Aberrant activation of AXL is associated with many aspects of tumorigenesis. The intracellular signaling pathways activated by AXL are commonly found to be hyper-activated and hijacked by tumors to drive cancer cell survival and proliferation. In addition, by regulating angiogenesis in tumor environment, AXL promotes tumor growth, invasiveness, and metastasis. AXL was originally identified as a protein encoded by a transforming gene that over-expresses in primary human myeloid leukemia cells (O'Bryan, J., et al., Mol Cell Bio, 11:5016-5031, 1991). Subsequently, activation of AXL by over-expression is frequently discovered in numerous types of human cancers and found to play an essential role in cancer development and maintenance. AXL over-expression was observed in 55% ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. These patients are significantly associated with lymph node metastasis and have a shorter median survival of 12 months compared with AXL-negative cancers of 18 months (Koorstra, J., et al, Cancer Biol Ther, 8:618-26, 2009). In glioblastomas, over-expression of AXL changes cellular morphology and increases filopodia by regulating cytoskeleton actin to favor cancer cell motility and invasion (Vajkoczy, P., et al., PNAS, 15:5799-804, 2006). In breast cancer models, ectopic expression of AXL significantly transforms weakly metastatic MCF7 cells into highly invasive ones (Zhang, Y., et al, Cancer Res, 68:1905-15, 2008). Furthermore, in clinical patient samples of non-small cell lung cancer, AXL protein over-expression has been statistically associated with lymph node involvement and advanced clinical stage of disease (Shieh, Y., et al, Neoplasia 7:1058-64, 2005.). [05] There remain tremendously unmet clinical needs in treating human cancers as a result of the limited efficacy, prohibitive toxicities, or in many cases both, of current portfolio of medicines. Due to drug resistance, majority cancer patients are treated with regimens consisting of several lines of drugs with distinct pharmacological mechanism of action. An emerging concept of the targeted anticancer therapy aims to develop specific small molecule chemicals or biologic proteins to inhibit aberrantly-activated kinases in cancer cells. This approach has resulted in enormous success by developing therapies targeting RTKs such as EGFR, HER2, PDGF, IGF, MET, etc., that are being adopted in clinical treatment for various cancers. Like these validated RTK drug targets, AXL has demonstrated a similarly strong link to human cancers. In several preclinical cancer models, inhibition of AXL activity by pharmacological, cellular, or genetic approaches including small molecule compounds, dominant negative protein, or siRNA inhibits cancer cell proliferation, induces cell apoptosis, suppresses tumor angiogenesis, and reduces tumor invasive capacity. These results establish AXL as an attractive and valuable target for the discovery and development of new therapeutic agents in human cancers including lung cancer, myeloid leukemia, astrocytoma, uterine cancer, ovarian cancer, colorectal carcinoma, esophageal adenocarcinoma, glioblastoma, melanoma, prostate cancer, breast cancer, osteosarcoma, renal cell carcinoma, thyroid cancer, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, gastric cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, kaposi sarcoma, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, prostate cancer, and endometrial cancer. [06] In addition, due to AXL's role in regulating angiogenesis, immune cell and platelet functions, etc., AXL inhibition also would be of benefit in the treatment of various complications and diseases such as asthma, chronic bronchitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, adult respiratory distress syndrome, infant respiratory distress syndrome, cough, chronic obstructive pulmonary, adult respiratory distress syndrome, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, hypersecretion of gastric acid, bacterial-, fungal-, or viral-induced sepsis or septic shock, endotoxic shock, spinal cord trauma, head injury, neurogenic inflammation, pain, reperfusion injury of the brain, psoriatic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, alkylosing spondylitis, osteoarthritis, inflammation, cytokine-mediated chronic tissue degeneration, thrombosis and the complications associated with thrombosis, macular degeneration, cataracts, diabetic retinopathy, glomerulonephritis, diabetic nephropathy, and renal plant rejection.

The assay used human AXL (Invitrogen, Cat. PV3971) recombinantly expressed his-tagged catalytic domain (amino acids 473-894) from insect cells. The substrate was fluorescein-labeled Poly GT (Invitrogen, Cat. PV3610). Test compounds were prepared and diluted in DMSO in 3-fold serial dilutions to 100X of the final testing concentrations. The compounds were then further diluted to 4X by the kinase reaction buffer (Invitrogen, Cat. PV3189). The enzymatic reaction for compound testing was performed in a white 384-well polypropylene plate (Packard, Cat. 6005214) with a total reaction volume of 10 μΙ containing 200 ng/ml AXL, 200 nM substrate, and 18 μΜ ATP that is around its Km. The assay started with loading 2.5 μΙ of AXL diluted in kinase reaction buffer to wells, followed by addition of equal volume of 4X compounds for 15-min incubation at the room temperature for pre-treatment. The enzymatic reaction was initiated by addition of 5 μΙ of mixture of the substrate and ATP prepared in kinase reaction buffer. After one hour reaction, 10 μΙ mixture of EDTA (final 10 mM) and terbium-labeled anti-PY20 antibody (final 2 nM) (Invitrogen, Cat. PV3552) prepared in TR-FRET antibody dilution buffer (Invitrogen, Cat. PV3574) was added to stop the enzymatic reaction and produce TR-FRET signals. After 30 minutes of incubation at room temperature, the plate was read in Tecan Infinite F200 Pro with the following settings: Excitation 340 nm (30)/Emissionl 495 nm (10)/Emission2 520 nm (25). The TR-FRET values were dimensionless numbers that were calculated as the ratio of the acceptor (Green Fluorescent Protein) signal to the donor (Terbium) signal. Percent of control was calculated as the percentage of compound-treated vs 1% DMSO vehicle-treated. The dose-response curves were generated and the IC50s were calculated by nonlinear sigmoid curve fitting using GraphPad Prism. [069] The growth inhibition activities of the disclosed compounds are shown in Table 2 below. In this table, the letter "A" represents an IC50 value within the range of 0 to 25 (including 25) nM; the letter "B" represents an IC50 value within the range of 25 to 50 (including 50) nM; the letter "C" represents an IC50 value within the range of 50 to 200 (including 200) nM; the letter "D" represents an IC50 value within the range of 200 to 400 (including 400) nM; the letter "E" represents an IC50 value within the range of 700 to 800 (including 800) nM; and the letter "F" represents an IC50 value within the range of over 1000 Nm.
