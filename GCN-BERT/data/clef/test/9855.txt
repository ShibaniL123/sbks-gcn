Step 9 Synthesis of Compound 41
To Compound 40 (2.19 g, 8.13 mmol) were added dichloromethane (10 mL) and methanol (22 mL), and the reaction mixture was cooled in an ice bath. Trimethylsilyldiazomethane-hexane solution (11.1 mL, 22.2 mmol) was added dropwise thereto, and the reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 30 minutes. Acetic acid was added to the mixture until the yellow mixture became colorless. Then, the reaction mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure, and the obtained residue (2.53 g) was purified by silicagel column chromatography (hexane-ethyl acetate) to give Compound 41 (1.05 g, Yield 46%) as a pale yellow oil.
