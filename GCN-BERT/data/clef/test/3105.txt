BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS [0008] Figure 1A and Figure IB shows the method of the present invention involving the initial injection of a biomaterial covalently attached to TCO. This is followed by a systemic injection of a therapeutic agent coupled to the tetrazine moiety. When the two entities come in close proximity, they react covalently attaching the therapy to the solid carrier and thus localizing the therapeutic agent. A molecular probe was utilized for Tz radioprobe 2 that contains radioactive '"Indium. [0009] Figure 2 shows in-vitro studies, p re-weighed gel discs (experimental or control ) were mixed with a solution of Tz radioprobe 2 for 10 min or 14 hours. During a 10 minute exposure a sample of TCO-Gel 1 bonded 1.78 nmoles/g, while the control gel maintained 0.75 nmoles/g of Tz radioprobe 2. In 14 hours the amount of Tz-radioprobe attached to control gel remained constant at 0.86 nmoles/g. The TCO-Gel 1 bound 2.78 nmoles/g. Error bars represent the standard deviation of the mean for three replicates. Star indicates statistical significance by paired Mest (p-value <0.05). [0010] Figure 3 A and Figure 3B shows Biodistribution results of Tz radioprobe 2. a, Mice (n = 3) bearing subcutaneous TCO-Gel 1 (mean 0.23 g [0.10-0.29 g]) and control gel (Mean 0.23 g [0.16-0.25 g]) were administered Tz radioprobe 2 (mean 44 μθ [39.2 - 48.4μΟ]) via tail vein injection (t = 0). b, Mean difference at specific timepoints between TCO-Gel 1 & control gel. Bars indicate %ID/g per organ at specific timepoint (1, 4, 24, 48 hr). Error bars represent the standard deviation of the mean for three replicates. Star indicates statistical significance by paired t-test (p-value <0.05). [0011] Figure 4 shows a mouse bearing subcutaneous TCO-Gel 1 ( 170 mg, green area) and control gel (230 mg, yellow area). 3 hours after implantation Tz radioprobe 2 (1.05 mCi ) was delivered via tail vein injection and imaged at 4, 24, 48 hour through SPECT. [0012] Figure 5 shows synthetic preparation of the solid support composition Tz-Me-gel. [0013] Figure 6 shows the reaction between the tetrazine solid support and fluorescein linked with TCO through a non-releasable linker. R represents the intact diethyl amine fluorescein moiety, still covalently connected to the solid support. [0014] Figure 7 shows the reaction between the tetrazine solid support and fluorescein linked with TCO through a releasable linker. As expected fluorescein diethyl amine (MW: 418.40) and carbon dioxide are released from the solid support. [0015] Figure 8 provides a sample of the supernatants after removal of the gel used to extrapolate the amount of unreacted TCO-X-Fluorescein and the kinetics of the reaction between TCO-X-Fluorescein and Tz-Me-gel. Briefly, the method involved: forming and weighing the Tz- gel, adding 1 mL of PBS saline containing a predetermined concentration of TCO-X-Fluorescein (10, 20, 50 nmoles), placing the plate at a well-plate mixer (speed 200) for predetermined number of time (10, 50, 100, 180 minutes), transferring the supernatant at the specific timepoint to another plate, and measuring the amount of fluorescence remaining in the supernatant via an IVIS spectrum machine (Fluorescein excitation at 490 nm, emission at 515 nm). [0016] Figure 9 shows a standard curve fit correlating radiance (fluorescence) and amount of fluorophore based on experimental values with a known amount of nmoles of TCO-NR- Fluorescein and the radiance detected with an IVIS Spectrum machine (Fluorescein excitation at 490 nm, emission at 515 nm). [0017] Figure 10 shows the decrease of TCO-NR-Fluorescein in the supernatant over time when the TCO-NR-Fluorescein and Tz-Me-gel are mixed at 37 °C between 0 and 70 minutes. [0018] Figure 11 shows the theoretical reciprocity of TCO-NR-Fluorescein bound to the gel and the amount detected in the supernatant that remains unbound. [0019] Figure 12 shows the calculated amount of bound TCO-NR-Fluorescein molecules to Tz-Me-gel based on the data of figure 10. Based on the data presented when a Tz-Me-gel disc was mixed with 50 nmoles of TCO-NR-Flourescein, 0.66 nmoles of TCO-NR- Fluorescein reacted per 1 mg of Tz-Me-gel after 70 minutes (0.66 nmoles/mg). Even after only 70 minutes this is about 200 times higher that the amount achieved with TCO-gel (2.78 nmoles/g) after 14 hours as shown in Figure 2. [0020] Figure 13 shows the activity of Tz-Me-gel after incubation at 37 °C for a predetermined amount of time (0-3 days). After the allotted incubation, 50 mg gels were challenged with the addition of 50 nmoles of TCO-NR-Fluorescein for 90 minutes and the amount bound was calculated as in the previous figures. [0021] Figure 14 shows the expected versus observed amount of unbound molecules after addition of TCO-R-fluorescein to Tz-Me-gel after multiple time-points. Given the similarities between the TCO-R-Fluorescein and TCO-NR-Fluorescein, similar reactivity patterns are expected. The assumption is that the difference in amount of recovered fluorescence in the supernatant is due to the release of diethylfluorescein as illustrated in figure 7. [0022] Figure 15 shows the total amount of fluorescein released after the addition of a specific amount of TCO-R-fluorescein (10, 20 & 50 nmoles) to Tz-Me-gel. Furthermore, the specific identity of the compounds in the supernatant of time point 60 minutes were analyzed with an LC-MS and revealed the presence of Fluorescein diamine (MW 418.40) as the main compound, further confirming the presence of the elimination product of the Catch & Release reaction of TCO-R-Fluorescein with Tz-Me-gel. [0023] Figure 16A and Figure 16B shows the method of the present invention using the catch-and-release linker. Briefly, the method involves first the localization of a solid carrier modified with click chemistry carrier, in this particular instance tetrazine. Then a cargo modified with a carbamate (green) and a trans-cyclooctene moiety is exposed to the material (either in- vitro or in- vivo). Both reagents react in-situ and depending on the substituents of the tetrazine the cargo is either released from or immobilized to the solid carrier. [0024] Figure 17 shows the release kinetics of TCO-R-Rhodamine after exposure to agarose beads modified with different tetrazines. Briefly, Agarose la with heterocyclic substituents at X & Y as shown in figure 16, leads to a slow release (red line), presumably due to attenuating by electron withdrawing groups. On the other hand, an aromatic substituent at X & an alkyl substituent at Y lead to fast release of Rhodamine diethyl amine. The values are the result of triplicates. [0025] Figure 18 shows radiance values for mice at 70 minutes, 5 hours and 3 days, without a gel impantation or implanted with Tz-gel, or alginate only, and then injected with TCO-R-rhodamine or TCO-NR-rhodamine. [0026] Figure 19A and Figure 19B shows the MIC of TCO-R- vancomycin for luminescent MSSA (Xen 29). [0027] Figure 20 shows the NMR for (R,E)-N-(2-aminoethyl)-2-(cyclooct-4-en- 1 - yloxy)acetamide (5). [0028] Figure 21 shows the NMR for unmodified alginate gel. [0029] Figure 22 shows the NMR for TCO-gel 1. [0030] Figure 23 shows the NMR for Tz-Me-gel. [0031] Figure 24 shows "Catch & Release" strategy, employing bio-orthogonal TCO- tetrazine chemistry. [0032] Figure 25 shows the amount of flourescein released after 180 minutes. This is calculated as the difference between the expected value of bound fluorophore and the actual experimental value obtained. [0033] Figure 26 shows peaks of fluorescein diamine ([M+H] 419.1214 & [M+MeOH] 453.3417) found on supernatant from the mixture of Tz-Me-gel and TCO-R-Fluorescein after 60 minutes, confirming the expected "catch & release" product by Liquid Chromatography - Mass Spectrometry. [0034] Figure 27 shows the release kinetics of TCO-R-Fluorescein ([M+H] is 571.21) after exposure to agarose beads modified with different tetrazines. Briefly, Agarose la with heterocyclic substituents at X & Y as shown in figure 16, leads to a slow release (MX53, red line), presumably due to attenuating by electron withdrawing groups. On the other hand, an aromatic substituent at X & an alkyl substituent at Y lead to fast release of Rhodamine diethyl amine (MX65, blue line). The left hand side shows a dynamic evaluation of the release through mass spectroscopy. [0035] Figure 28 shows setup for the kinetic study of 'Catch & release' of fluorescein- labeled TCO from tetrazine-modified agarose. [0036] Figure 29 shows a dynamic evaluation of the release of TCO-R-Rhodamine ([M+H] 625.31) through mass spectroscopy. The release product is found as expected at 473.22. [0037] Figure 30 shows the increase in fluorescence based on the previous kinetic biodistribution study at each time point comparing negative control (no gel injection) vs the release protocol (Tz-Me-Gel) after injection of TCO-R-Rhodamine. The bar graph extrapolates the data to a presumed total amount achieved in 8 hours. The dose reflected by the area under the curve is almost doubled in the presence of the gel as shown in the "released" column (right) vs the negative control (left). [0038] Figure 31 shows kinetic multiple dose evaluation of mice. Three mice were evaluated after each injection of 50 nmoles of TCO-R-Rhodamine through tail vein injection. The mice were treated as described above their images. The "negative control" subject did not receive any gel injection. The "released" subject received an injection in the subcutaneous back of Tz-Me-gel. The "gel control" subject received an injection in the subcutaneous back of alginate gel. The mice were evaluated with an IVIS Spectrum machine after 5-10 minutes and 110-150 minutes after each dose of fluorophore. [0039] Figure 32 shows the average fluorescence observed at 5-10 minutes vs 110-150 minutes after the second, third & fourth injection with 50 nmoles of TCO-R-Rhodamine to each of the different experimental groups (negative control = no gel; experimental group = Tz-Me-gel; gel control = unmodified alginate gel). The fluorescence is statistically higher in the experimental group than either in the negative or gel control groups. Compared by paired T-test (n=3). DETAILED DESCRIPTION I.

[0073] The biocompatible solid support can be implanted by any means known to one of skill in the art. [0074] The therapeutic or diagnostic agent can be administered in any suitable amount sufficient to treat the disease or condition the patient is suffering from. The dose, frequency and timing of such administering will depend in large part on the selected therapeutic agent, the nature of the condition being treated, the condition of the subject including age, weight and presence of other conditions or disorders, the formulation being administered and the discretion of the attending physician. Generally, the therapeutic or diagnostic agents are administered in dosages ranging from about 2 mg up to about 2,000 mg per day, although variations will necessarily occur depending, as noted above, on the disease target, the patient, and the route of administration. The therapeutic or diagnostic agents of the present invention can be administered as frequently as necessary, including hourly, daily, weekly or monthly. The therapeutic or diagnostic agents utilized in the pharmaceutical method of the invention are administered at the initial dosage of about 0.0001 mg/kg to about 1000 mg/kg daily. A daily dose range of about 0.01 mg/kg to about 500 mg/kg, or about 0.1 mg/kg to about 200 mg/kg, or about 1 mg/kg to about 100 mg/kg, or about 10 mg/kg to about 50 mg/kg, can be used. The dosages, however, can be varied depending upon the requirements of the patient, the severity of the condition being treated, and the compound being employed. For example, dosages can be empirically determined considering the type and stage of disease diagnosed in a particular patient. The dose administered to a patient, in the context of the present invention should be sufficient to effect a beneficial therapeutic response in the patient over time, but is typically lower than the dose required to treat the patient without having implanted the biocompatible solid support that concentrates the therapeutic or diagnostic agent at the organ or tissue requiring treatment. The size of the dose also will be determined by the existence, nature, and extent of any adverse side-effects that accompany the administration of a particular compound in a particular patient. Determination of the proper dosage for a particular situation is within the skill of the practitioner. Generally, treatment is initiated with smaller dosages which are less than the optimum dose of the compound. Thereafter, the dosage is increased by small increments until the optimum effect under circumstances is reached. For convenience, the total daily dosage can be divided and administered in portions during the day, if desired. Doses can be given daily, or on alternate days, as determined by the treating physician. Doses can also be given on a regular or continuous basis over longer periods of time (weeks, months or years). [0075] In some embodiments, the concentration of the therapeutic or diagnostic agent at the first location of the targeted organ or tissue is greater than the concentration elsewhere in the patient. In some embodiments, the therapeutic agent is vancomycin. [0076] In another embodiment, the present invention provides a method for selectively delivering an effective amount of a therapeutic or diagnostic agent to a first location of a targeted organ or tissue in a patient. The method includes implanting in the patient at the first location of the targeted organ or tissue a solid support composition having a biocompatible solid support and a first binding agent linked to the solid support. The method also includes administering to the patient a bioactive composition having a therapeutic or diagnostic agent, a second binding agent complementary to the first binding agent, and a releasable linker linking the therapeutic or diagnostic agent and the second binding agent, such that the first and second binding agent bind to one another upon contact. The method also includes releasing the therapeutic or diagnostic agent, thereby delivering the therapeutic or diagnostic agent to the first location of the targeted organ or tissue. V. FORMULATION [0077] The compositions of the present invention can be prepared in a wide variety of oral, parenteral and topical dosage forms. Oral preparations include tablets, pills, powder, dragees, capsules, liquids, lozenges, cachets, gels, syrups, slurries, suspensions, etc., suitable for ingestion by the patient. The compositions of the present invention can also be administered by injection, that is, intravenously, intramuscularly, intracutaneously, subcutaneous ly, intraduodenally, or intraperitoneally. Also, the compositions described herein can be administered by inhalation, for example, intranasally. Additionally, the compositions of the present invention can be administered transdermally. The compositions of this invention can also be administered by intraocular, intravaginal, and intrarectal routes including suppositories, insufflation, powders and aerosol formulations (for examples of steroid inhalants, see Rohatagi, J. Clin. Pharmacol. 35: 1187-1193, 1995; Tjwa, Ann. Allergy Asthma Immunol. 75: 107-111, 1995). Accordingly, the present invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions including a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient and the compounds of the present invention. [0078] For preparing pharmaceutical compositions from the compounds of the present invention, pharmaceutically acceptable carriers can be either solid or liquid. Solid form preparations include powders, tablets, pills, capsules, cachets, suppositories, and dispersible granules. A solid carrier can be one or more substances, which may also act as diluents, flavoring agents, binders, preservatives, tablet disintegrating agents, or an encapsulating material. Details on techniques for formulation and administration are well described in the scientific and patent literature, see, e.g., the latest edition of Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Maack Publishing Co, Easton PA ("Remington's"). [0079] In powders, the carrier is a finely divided solid, which is in a mixture with the finely divided active component. In tablets, the active component is mixed with the carrier having the necessary binding properties in suitable proportions and compacted in the shape and size desired. The powders and tablets preferably contain from 5% or 10% to 70% of the compounds of the present invention. [0080] Suitable solid excipients include, but are not limited to, magnesium carbonate; magnesium stearate; talc; pectin; dextrin; starch; tragacanth; a low melting wax; cocoa butter; carbohydrates; sugars including, but not limited to, lactose, sucrose, mannitol, or sorbitol, starch from corn, wheat, rice, potato, or other plants; cellulose such as methyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl-cellulose, or sodium carboxymethylcellulose; and gums including arabic and tragacanth; as well as proteins including, but not limited to, gelatin and collagen. If desired, disintegrating or solubilizing agents may be added, such as the cross-linked polyvinyl pyrrolidone, agar, alginic acid, or a salt thereof, such as sodium alginate. [0081] Dragee cores are provided with suitable coatings such as concentrated sugar solutions, which may also contain gum arabic, talc, polyvinylpyrrolidone, carbopol gel, polyethylene glycol, and/or titanium dioxide, lacquer solutions, and suitable organic solvents or solvent mixtures. Dyestuffs or pigments may be added to the tablets or dragee coatings for product identification or to characterize the quantity of active compound (i.e., dosage). Pharmaceutical preparations of the invention can also be used orally using, for example, push-fit capsules made of gelatin, as well as soft, sealed capsules made of gelatin and a coating such as glycerol or sorbitol. Push- fit capsules can contain the compounds of the present invention mixed with a filler or binders such as lactose or starches, lubricants such as talc or magnesium stearate, and, optionally, stabilizers. In soft capsules, the compounds of the present invention may be dissolved or suspended in suitable liquids, such as fatty oils, liquid paraffin, or liquid polyethylene glycol with or without stabilizers. [0082] For preparing suppositories, a low melting wax, such as a mixture of fatty acid glycerides or cocoa butter, is first melted and the compounds of the present invention are dispersed homogeneously therein, as by stirring. The molten homogeneous mixture is then poured into convenient sized molds, allowed to cool, and thereby to solidify. [0083] Liquid form preparations include solutions, suspensions, and emulsions, for example, water or water/propylene glycol solutions. For parenteral injection, liquid preparations can be formulated in solution in aqueous polyethylene glycol solution. [0084] Aqueous solutions suitable for oral use can be prepared by dissolving the compounds of the present invention in water and adding suitable colorants, flavors, stabilizers, and thickening agents as desired. Aqueous suspensions suitable for oral use can be made by dispersing the finely divided active component in water with viscous material, such as natural or synthetic gums, resins, methylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, sodium alginate, polyvinylpyrrolidone, gum tragacanth and gum acacia, and dispersing or wetting agents such as a naturally occurring phosphatide (e.g., lecithin), a condensation product of an alkylene oxide with a fatty acid (e.g., polyoxyethylene stearate), a condensation product of ethylene oxide with a long chain aliphatic alcohol (e.g., heptadecaethylene oxycetanol), a condensation product of ethylene oxide with a partial ester derived from a fatty acid and a hexitol (e.g., polyoxyethylene sorbitol mono-oleate), or a condensation product of ethylene oxide with a partial ester derived from fatty acid and a hexitol anhydride (e.g., polyoxyethylene sorbitan mono-oleate). The aqueous suspension can also contain one or more preservatives such as ethyl or n-propyl p-hydroxybenzoate, one or more coloring agents, one or more flavoring agents and one or more sweetening agents, such as sucrose, aspartame or saccharin. Formulations can be adjusted for osmolality. [0085] Also included are solid form preparations, which are intended to be converted, shortly before use, to liquid form preparations for oral administration. Such liquid forms include solutions, suspensions, and emulsions. These preparations may contain, in addition to the active component, colorants, flavors, stabilizers, buffers, artificial and natural sweeteners, dispersants, thickeners, solubilizing agents, and the like. [0086] In another embodiment, the compositions of the present invention can be formulated for parenteral administration, such as intravenous (IV) administration or administration into a body cavity or lumen of an organ. The formulations for administration will commonly comprise a solution of the compositions of the present invention dissolved in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that can be employed are water and Ringer's solution, an isotonic sodium chloride. In addition, sterile fixed oils can conventionally be employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil can be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid can likewise be used in the preparation of injectables. These solutions are sterile and generally free of undesirable matter. These formulations may be sterilized by conventional, well known sterilization techniques. The formulations may contain pharmaceutically acceptable auxiliary substances as required to approximate physiological conditions such as pH adjusting and buffering agents, toxicity adjusting agents, e.g., sodium acetate, sodium chloride, potassium chloride, calcium chloride, sodium lactate and the like. The concentration of the compositions of the present invention in these formulations can vary widely, and will be selected primarily based on fluid volumes, viscosities, body weight, and the like, in accordance with the particular mode of administration selected and the patient's needs. For IV administration, the formulation can be a sterile injectable preparation, such as a sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspension. This suspension can be formulated according to the known art using those suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation can also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a nontoxic parenterally-acceptable diluent or solvent, such as a solution of 1,3-butanediol. [0087] In another embodiment, the formulations of the compositions of the present invention can be delivered by the use of liposomes which fuse with the cellular membrane or are endocytosed, i.e., by employing ligands attached to the liposome, or attached directly to the oligonucleotide, that bind to surface membrane protein receptors of the cell resulting in endocytosis. By using liposomes, particularly where the liposome surface carries ligands specific for target cells, or are otherwise preferentially directed to a specific organ, one can focus the delivery of the compositions of the present invention into the target cells in vivo. (See, e.g., Al-Muhammed, J. Microencapsul. 13:293-306, 1996; Chonn, Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 6:698-708, 1995; Ostro, ^m. J. Hosp. Pharm. 46: 1576-1587, 1989). VI. ADMINISTRATION [0088] The compositions of the present invention can be delivered by any suitable means, including oral, parenteral and topical methods. Transdermal administration methods, by a topical route, can be formulated as applicator sticks, solutions, suspensions, emulsions, gels, creams, ointments, pastes, jellies, paints, powders, and aerosols. [0089] The pharmaceutical preparation is preferably in unit dosage form. In such form the preparation is subdivided into unit doses containing appropriate quantities of the compounds of the present invention. The unit dosage form can be a packaged preparation, the package containing discrete quantities of preparation, such as packeted tablets, capsules, and powders in vials or ampoules. Also, the unit dosage form can be a capsule, tablet, cachet, or lozenge itself, or it can be the appropriate number of any of these in packaged form. [0090] The compound of the present invention can be present in any suitable amount, and can depend on various factors including, but not limited to, weight and age of the subject, state of the disease, etc. Suitable dosage ranges for the compound of the present invention include from about 0.1 mg to about 10,000 mg, or about 1 mg to about 1000 mg, or about 10 mg to about 750 mg, or about 25 mg to about 500 mg, or about 50 mg to about 250 mg. Suitable dosages for the compound of the present invention include about 1 mg, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900 or 1000 mg. [0091] The compounds of the present invention can be administered at any suitable frequency, interval and duration. For example, the compound of the present invention can be administered once an hour, or two, three or more times an hour, once a day, or two, three, or more times per day, or once every 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 days, so as to provide the preferred dosage level.

[0092] The compounds of the present invention can be co-administered with another active agent. Co-administration includes administering the compound of the present invention and active agent within 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 20, or 24 hours of each other. Coadministration also includes administering the compound of the present invention and active agent simultaneously, approximately simultaneously (e.g., within about 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, or 30 minutes of each other), or sequentially in any order. Moreover, the compound of the present invention and the active agent can each be administered once a day, or two, three, or more times per day so as to provide the preferred dosage level per day. [0093] In some embodiments, co-administration can be accomplished by co-formulation, i.e., preparing a single pharmaceutical composition including both the compound of the present invention and the active agent. In other embodiments, the compound of the present invention and the active agent can be formulated separately. [0094] The compound of the present invention and the active agent can be present in the compositions of the present invention in any suitable weight ratio, such as from about 1 : 100 to about 100: 1 (w/w), or about 1 :50 to about 50: 1, or about 1 :25 to about 25: 1, or about 1 : 10 to about 10: 1, or about 1 :5 to about 5: 1 (w/w).

S 4 5 [0104] (R,E)-N-(2-aminoethyl)-2-(cyclooct-4-en-l-yloxy)acetamide (5). Compound 3 (100 mg, 0.54 mmol), N-hydroxysuccinamide (69 mg, 0.60 mmol) and Ν,Ν'- dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (123 mg, 0.60 mmol) was dissolved in CH2CI2 (2 mL) and stirred at rt for 2 h. The precipitated urea was filtered off through PVDF membrane. The membrane was washed with CH2C12 (1 mL). The mother liquer was added to a sturring solution of ethylenediamine (324 mg, 5.4 mmol) in CH2CI2 (10 mL). The reaction was stirred at rt for 2 h. The reaction mixture was washed with water (2x10 mL). The organic layer was dried with MgS04 and concentrated under reduced pressure. The product was purified on preparative silica TLC using a 4:1 mixture of CH2CI2 and MeOH as a solvent. The yield of compound 5 was 60 mg (49%). 1H NMR (CDC13) δ 7.08 (bs, 1H), 5.61-5.45 (m, 2H), 3.92 (q, J = 11.23 Hz, 2H), 3.64 (dd, Jl = 9.91 Hz, J2 = 4.73 Hz, 1H), 3.36 (q, J = 6.07 Hz, 2H), 2.87 (bs, 2H), 2.31-2.16 (m, 4H), 2.08-2.04 (m, 1H), 1.89-1.49 (m, 5H). 13C NMR (CDC13) δ 170.34, 135.48, 131.37, 75.80, 68.31, 41.28, 40.05, 34.28, 32.53, 29.74, 27.85. HRMS: m/z [M+H]+ calcd. for C12H23N2O2 227.1754, found 227.1791. [0105] Each gram of UP MVG alginate was combined with 176 μιηοΐ of TCO-amine under standard carbodiimide chemistry conditions, as previously described for arginine-glycine- aspartic acid (RGD) and glycine-histidine-lysine (GHK) incorporation. The alginate product was then purified by dialysis against deionized water containing decreasing salt concentrations for 4 days, frozen and lyophilized for 5-10 days until dry. A 2.5% alginate solution was obtained by adding DPBS, and alginate gels were fabricated by the addition of calcium. Covalent modification of alginate was confirmed through 1H-NMR studies (see Figures 20-22). The same protocol without the TCO addition was used for the construction of control gels. The in vitro and in vivo studies were done with TCO-gel from the exact same batch and used on the same day to minimize any variations in loading amount or loading efficiency. [0106] For in vitro experiments, 800 μΐ of 2.5% alginate solution was mixed with 200 μΐ of supersaturated Ca(S04)2 solution (0.21 g of Ca(S04)2 per ml of double-distilled water (ddH20)). The solutions were mixed for 30 s using a three-way stopcock to achieve a final alginate concentration of 2%. The mixture was allowed to gel between two glass plates in a custom-made plastic model and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. The entire volume had a uniform appearance consistent with gelation. The discs were picked up with a spatula and weighed individually. Typically, a premade disc weighed approximately 100 mg and had roughly the following dimensions: 8 mm (diameter) and 2 mm (height). [0107] For in vivo use, the 2.5% alginate gel solution and the super-saturated calcium sulfate solution were mixed rapidly in the same proportions as mentioned above and immediately injected to the animal in the desired amount.

Preparation of Modified Agarose [0114] The NHS-activated agarose spin columns were purchased from Pierce/ Thermo Fisher Scientific (Rockford, IL). The amine precursors to la or lb of Figure 16B were coupled to the agarose beads using the manufacturer's recommended protocol. Briefly, 33 mg of dry agarose was incubated with 4 μιηοΐ of the amine precursor of la or lb in PBS buffer pH 7.4 for 3 h with gentle mixing. The agarose beads were washed several times with PBS. The amount of la or lb bound to the column was estimated by monitoring the absorbance at 520 nm of the supematants obtained from the washes. The unreacted NHS groups on agarose were capped with 1 M Tris, pH 7.4. Example 9. Kinetics of Catch & Release Linker [0115] The agarose beads modified with either la or lb, using the method described above, were treated with 2 μιηοΐ of TCO-R-Rhodamine ((E)-5-((2-(((cyclooct-2-en-l- yloxy)carbonyl)amino)ethyl)carbamoyl)-2-(3-(dimethyl- 4-azanylidene)-6-(dimethylamino)- 3H-xanthen-9-yl)benzoic acid ) for 2 min. The supernatant was collected after a quick centrifugation and the agarose was resuspended in water. The supernatents were collected at regular time intervals and analyzed by ESI-MS. [0116] The samples were analyzed on a Thermo Fisher Scientific (West Palm Beach, CA) LTQ Orbitrap Velos Mass spectrometer, using quartz capillary emitters. To facilitate spray optimization, 10 % isopropyl alcohol was added to each sample prior to MS analysis. The release product, Pvhodamine ethyl diamine (5 -((2-aminoethyl)carbamoyl)-2-(3 -(dimethyl- 4- azanylidene)-6-(dimethylamino)-3H-xanthen-9-yl)benzoic acid ), was analyzed in the positive mode. The release product rhodamine ethyl diamine was independently synthesized for ESI-MS calibration (Figure SX). The calibration curve was used to estimate the amount of rhodamine ethyl diamine in the supernatants of each step. Example 10. Preparation of Modified Tz-Me- Alginate [0117] Each gram of UP MVG alginate was combined with 176 μιηοΐεβ of (4-(6-Methyl- l ,2,4,5-tetrazin-3-yl)phenyl)methanamine (Tz-Me-amine) under standard carbodiimide chemistry conditions as previously described for RGD, GHK and TCO amine incorporation. Then the alginate product was purified by dialysis against deionized water containing decreasing salt concentrations for 4 days, frozen and lyophilized for 5-10 days until dry. A 2.5% alginate solution was obtained by adding ddFbO, and alginate gels were fabricated by the addition of calcium. Covalent modification of alginate was confirmed through 1H-NMR studies (see Figure 23). The same protocol without the TCO addition was used for the construction of control gels. The in- vitro and in- vivo studies were done with TCO-Gel 1 from the exact same batch and used on the same day to minimize any variations in loading amount or loading efficiency. [0118] For in- vivo experiments, 800 μΐ of 2.5% alginate solution were mixed with 200 μΐ of supersaturated Ca(S04)2 solution (0.2 lg Ca(S04)2/ml ddFbO). The solutions were mixed for 30 s using a three-way stopcock to achieve a final alginate concentration of 2%. The mixture was immediately injected to the animal in the desired amount. Example 11. In-vivo Evaluation of Catch & Release Linker [0119] After IACUC approval, in-vivo real-time biodistribution studies of fluorescence were carried out in nu/nu mice (n=2 per condition) by injecting either nothing or a type of alginate (control vs Tz-Gel). Then subjects received a tail-vein injection of TCO-R-F or TCO-NR-F. The negative controls were: 1. No gels with TCO-R-F (Negative control, mouse 1); 2. control alginate with TCO-R-F (Gel control, mouse 4). The two experimental groups were Tz-gel and either TCO-R-F (Released protocol, mouse 2) or TCO-NR-F (Immobilized protocol, mouse 3). Fluorescence was measured with an IVIS Spectrum (Perkin Elmer, MA) and reported in radiance. Example 12. Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of Releasable Vancomycin [0120] We created serial dilutions of vancomycin or TCO-R-Vanco with either a regular alginate gel or Tz-gel overnight in ddffcO. The following day luminescent methicillin sensitive Staph, aureus (MSSA, Xen 29, Perkin Elmer, MA) in 2.2% Mueller Winto broth were added to the mixture. The plates were then placed in the incubator for 24 and allowed to grow for 24 hours (n=3). Then luminescence was measured with an IVIS Spectrum (Perkin Elmer, MA) and reported in radiance.
