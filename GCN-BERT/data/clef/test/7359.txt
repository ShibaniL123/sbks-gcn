Synthesis of Compound 29
Under an argon purge, DMF (15 mL) and TEA (1.00 mL) were added to succinimidyl 4-(azidomethyl)benzoate[1] (823 mg, 3.00 mmol) and ε-aminocaproic acid (472 mg, 3.60 mmol, 1.2 eq). After 3 days, TLC (chloroform:methanol=5:1, detection with UV) was performed to confirm the occurrence of reaction and the disappearance of the raw material. The reaction solution was diluted with ethyl acetate and subjected to extraction with a 1 N aqueous HCl solution. The organic layer was washed with brine once and dehydrated with anhydrous sodium sulfate, and the solvent was distilled off under reduced pressure. The obtained residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (chloroform:methanol=100:1→100:2→100:4). The solvent was distilled off under reduced pressure to obtain a compound 29 (888 mg, 2.99 mmol, 99%) as a white crystal.
