CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION This application is a continuation of co-pending U.S. application Ser. No. 13/606,452, filed Sep. 7, 2012, the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. BACKGROUND Modern vehicle engines generally require a heat transfer fluid (liquid coolant) to provide long-lasting, year-round protection of their cooling systems. The primary requirements of the heat transfer fluids are that they provide efficient heat transfer to control and maintain engine temperature for efficient fuel economy and lubrication, and prevent engine failures due to freeze-up, boiling-over, or over-heating. An additional key requirement of a heat transfer fluid is that it provides corrosion protection of all cooling system metals over a wide range of temperature and operating conditions. Aluminum corrosion protection for engine block, cylinder head, water pump, heat exchangers and other components from aluminum or aluminum alloys is particularly important. Beyond metal protection, corrosion protection helps the heat transfer fluid to fulfill its primary function of transferring excess heat from the engine to the radiator for dissipation. There is an ongoing need for heat transfer fluids having good heat transfer and corrosion protection. BRIEF DESCRIPTION This need is met, at least in part, by a heat transfer fluid concentrate comprising: greater than or equal to 85 weight percent of a freezing point depressant; 16 to 80 ppm of magnesium ions; an azole compound; an inorganic phosphate; a carboxylate; and an acrylate based polymer, wherein the heat transfer fluid concentrate has a pH of 7 to 9.5 and the weight ratio of acrylate based polymer to magnesium ions is 1 to 25. The heat transfer fluid concentrate can be diluted to form a heat transfer fluid coolant comprising: less than 90 weight percent of a freezing point depressant; water; 8 to 60 ppm of magnesium ions; an azole compound; an inorganic phosphate; a carboxylic acid; greater than 0.5 ppm of calcium ions; and an acrylate based polymer, wherein the heat transfer fluid has a pH of 7-9.5 and the weight ratio of acrylate based polymer to magnesium ions is 1 to 25. Also described herein is a heat transfer system comprising a heat transfer fluid concentrate or heat transfer coolant as described herein and a heat transfer apparatus. DETAILED DESCRIPTION Disclosed herein are heat transfer fluid concentrate and heat transfer fluid compositions that demonstrate a synergistic effect between the components of the composition. In a heat transfer fluid comprising ethylene glycol, water, a carboxylate, inorganic phosphate, and an azole compound the synergistic effect is observed between magnesium ions and acrylate based polymer, as shown in the corrosion tests and storage test. The optimal performance is observed when the ratio of acrylate-based polymer to magnesium ion (both in ppm or wt %) in the heat transfer fluid concentrate is 1 to 25. In the case of a heat transfer fluid, the results show that adding 1-15 ppm of calcium ions can ensure storage stability and good corrosion performance. The effect of calcium ions on the solubility of magnesium ions in the phosphate containing heat transfer fluid is particularly surprising. The highly insoluble nature of various calcium phosphate salts in aqueous solutions at pH between 7 and 9.5 would lead one of skill in the art to predict poor solubility due to solution thermodynamic considerations. The heat transfer fluid concentrate and heat transfer fluid can be free of silicate, borate and amines. The nitrate content can be less than 50 ppm by weight based on the total weight of the heat transfer fluid concentrate or heat transfer fluid. The freezing point depressant can be an alcohol or mixture of alcohols. Exemplary alcohols include monohydric or polyhydric alcohols and mixtures thereof. The alcohol can be selected from the group consisting of methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol, furfurol, furfuryl alcohol, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, ethoxylated furfuryl alcohol, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, 1,3-propanediol, glycerol, diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, 1,2-propylene glycol, 1,3-propylene glycol, dipropylene glycol, butylene glycol, glycerol-1,2-dimethyl ether, glycerol-1,3-dimethyl ether, monoethylether of glycerol, sorbitol, 1,2,6-hexanetriol, trimethylopropane, alkoxy alkanols such as methoxyethanol, and combinations of two or more of the foregoing.
