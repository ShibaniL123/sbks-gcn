Step 3
(E)-methyl 3-(3,5-difluoro-4-((6S,8R/6R,8S)-7-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-8-methyl-2-oxo-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-2H-pyrano[2,3-g]isoquinolin-6-yl)phenyl)acrylate
(E)-methyl 3-(4-((1S,3R/1R,3S)-6-acetoxy-2-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-7-formyl-3-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-1-yl)-3,5-difluorophenyl)acrylate 77b (150 mg, 0.3 mmol) and sodium acetate (150 mg, 1.8 mmol) were mixed, warmed up to 180Â°C, and stirred for 8 hours. The reaction solution was cooled to room temperature. The residue was purified by thin layer chromotography with elution system B to obtain the title compound (E)-methyl 3-(3,5-difluoro-4-((6S,8R/6R,8S)-7-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-8-methyl-2-oxo-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-2H-pyrano[2,3-g]isoquinolin-6-yl)ph enyl)acrylate 77c (70 mg, yield 48.1%) as a colorless oil.
