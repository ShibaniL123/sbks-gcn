METHODS AND COMPOSITIONS FOR SLEEP DISORDERS AND OTHER DISORDERS The present application is a divisional from Australian Application No. 2009251816 filed on May 27, 2009, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. Australian Application No. 2009251816 claims the benefit of United States Provisional Application numbers 61/056,433 filed on May 27, 2008 and 61/155,032 filed on February 24, 2009, both of which applications are hereby also incorporated by reference. TECHNICAL FIELD [0001] The present invention relates to use of particular substituted heterocycle fused gamma-carbolines as described herein, in free or pharmaceutically acceptable salt forms, as pharmaceuticals and pharmaceutical compositions, e.g., in the treatment of diseases involving 5-ΗΤ2Α receptor, serotonin transporter (SERT) and/or dopamine D2 receptor protein phosphorylation pathways, such as depression, sleep disorders, and mood disorders associated with psychosis or Parkinson's disease; psychosis such as schizophrenia associated with depression; bipolar disorder; and other psychiatric and neurological conditions such as sleep disorders, as well as to combinations with other agents. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0002] Psychosis such as schizophrenia is a severe and crippling mental disorder that affects about 1% of the population. It is a mental disorder that is characterized by gross impairment in reality, major disturbances in reasoning, often evidenced by delusions and hallucinations, incoherent speech, and/or disorganized and agitated behavior. Several classes of anti-psychotic drugs are available for treatment of schizophrenia, including the prototypical antipsychotic drugs such as chlorpromazine and haloperidol as well as many others such as droperidol, fluphenazine, loxapine, mesoridazine molidone, perphenazine, pimozide, prochlorperazine promazine, thioridazine, thiothixene, and trifluoperazine. While these agents are effective in treating positive symptoms of psychosis such as symptoms of hallucination and delusions, e.g., in schizophrenia, these drugs often cause both short-term and long-term movement disorders and other side effects including acute dystonia (e.g., facial grimacing, torticollis, oculogyric crisis, abnormal contraction of spinal muscles and of muscles involved in breathing), akathisia, bradykinesia, rigidity or short term paralysis, parkinsonism, sedation, dry mouth, sexual dysfunction and sometimes tardive dyskinesia. Tardive dyskinesia may persist after discontinuation of the use of typical antipsychotic agents and there is no effective treatment of such side effects. Because of the severity of the side effects, typical antipsychotic drugs, though effective in treating the mental and emotional aspect of the disorder, do not help patients to function normally in society. [0003] Although another class of antipsychotic agents called atypical antipsychotic agents, which include clozapine, aripiparazole, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone and ziprasidone (atypical antipsychotic agents) are effective in treating positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia with fewer extrapyramidal side effects, these agents can nevertheless cause other serious and at times fatal side effects, including bone marrow suppression, seizure, orthostatic hypotension, insomnia, sedation, somnolence, weight gain, and if administered at higher doses, may again cause extrapyramidal side effects. Therefore, atypical antipsychotic agents, though have improved clinical profiles, are nevertheless undesirable. [0004] In addition to the positive and negative symptoms of psychosis (e.g., schizophrenia), many psychotic patients often at times also suffer from depression. While both typical and atypical antipsychotic agents are effective in treating psychosis, depression is often times neglected or left under-treated. The combination of psychosis and depression poses a particular challenge in their treatment as studies revealed that up to 10% of the patients suffering from schizophrenia end their own lives. Therefore, there is a need for agents that are useful for the treatment of psychosis in depressed patients, and for the treatment of depression as well as other disorders such as sleep and mood disorders in psychotic patients and patients suffering from Parkinson’s disease without exhibiting or exhibiting minimal extrapyramidal and other side effects compared to conventional antipsychotic, hypnotic and anti-depressive agents. [0005] Substituted heterocycle fused gamma-carbolines have previously been described to be agonists or antagonists of 5-ΗΤ2 receptors, particularly 5-ΗΤ2Α and 5-HT2C receptors, in treating central nervous system disorders. These compounds have been disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,548,493; 7,238,690; 6,552,017; 6,713,471; U.S. RE39680, and U.S. RE39679, as novel compounds useful for the treatment of disorders associated with 5-ΗΤ2Α receptor modulation such as obesity, anxiety, depression, psychosis, schizophrenia, sleep disorders, sexual disorders, migraine, conditions associated with cephalic pain, social phobias, and gastrointestinal disorders such as dysfunction of the gastrointestinal tract motility. PCT/US08/03340 and U.S. Application Serial No. 10/786,935 also disclose methods of making substituted heterocycle fused gamma-carbolines and uses of these gamma-carbolines as serotonin agonists and antagonists useful for the control and prevention of central nervous system disorders such as addictive behavior and sleep disorders. Although these references disclose use of substituted heterocycle fused gamma-carbolines to independently treat disorders associated with serotonin pathways such as sleep disorder, depression, psychosis, and schizophrenia associated with the 5-ΗΤ2α pathways, there is no teaching that specific compounds of substituted heterocycle fused gamma-carbolines also exhibit nanomolar binding affinity to serotonin reuptake transporter (SERT) and dopamine D2 receptors and therefore may be used to treat a combination of psychosis and depressive disorders as well as sleep, depressive and/or mood disorders in patients with psychosis or Parkinson’s disease. [0006] In addition to disorders associated with psychosis and/or depression, these references do not disclose use of particular substituted heterocycle fused gamma-carbolines at a low dose to selectively antagonize 5-ΗΤ2α receptors without affecting or minimally affecting dopamine D2 receptors, thereby useful for the treatment of sleep disorders without the side effects of the dopamine D2 pathways or side effects of other pathways (e.g., GABAa receptors) associated with convention sedative-hypnotic agents (e.g., benzodiazepines) including but not limited to the development of drug dependency, muscle hypotonia, weakness, headache, blurred vision, vertigo, nausea, vomiting, epigastric distress, diarrhea, joint pains, and chest pains. The discussion of documents, acts, materials, devices, articles and the like is included in this specification solely for the purpose of providing a context for the present invention. It is not suggested or represented that any or all of these matters formed part of the prior art base or were common general knowledge in the field relevant to the present invention as it existed before the priority date of each claim of this application. Where the terms "comprise", "comprises", "comprised" or "comprising" are used in this specification (including the claims) they are to be interpreted as specifying the presence of the stated features, integers, steps or components, but not precluding the presence of one or more other features, integers, steps or components, or group thereof. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0007] It has been discovered that particular substituted heterocycle fused gamma-carboline compounds (Compounds of Formula I, described hereinbelow) exhibit unique pharmacological characteristics wherein they possess high affinity for serotonin 5-ΗΤ2Α receptors and moderate, yet nanomolar affinity for dopamine receptors and serotonin reuptake transporter (SERT). The compounds moreover demonstrate selectivity between dopamine D1 and D2 receptors. This is a new and unexpected binding profile, which gives the compounds particular utility in certain indications as described below, and in combination therapies. [0008] At low doses, Compounds of Formula I selectively antagonize 5-ΗΤ2Α receptors and increases rapid eye movement (REM) and non-REM sleep in animals. Therefore, at low doses, these compounds may be used to improve sleep maintenance insomnia and insomnia associated with neuropsychiatric and neurologic disorders. [0009] In a clinical trial, low doses (e.g., 1, 5, and 10 mg) of Compounds of Formula I, e.g. Compound A, dose-dependently increase slow wave sleep, consistent with 5-ΗΤ2α receptor antagonism, they dose-dependently decreases wake after sleep onset, consistent with improving sleep maintenance, they increase total sleep time and restore normal sleep architecture to patients with insomnia by increasing slow wave sleep early in the night and increasing stage 2 sleep late in the night, toward morning, they show no early-morning rebound insomnia and did not suppress REM sleep. They do not impair next-day cognitive function. The magnitude of WASO decrease and total sleep time increase at 10 mg suggests the modest D2 (and possibly SERT and Dl) occupancy at this dose contributes favorably to the sleep profile beyond simple 5-ΗΤ2Α receptor antagonism. Dopamine receptor modulation and SERT inhibition improve psychiatric symptoms co-morbid with insomnia. Compounds of Formula 1 represent a new approach for treating sleep maintenance insomnia and sleep disorders associated with neuropsychiatric and neurological diseases, as well as for the treatment of sleep disorders, schizophrenia, and other neuropsychiatric and neurological indications. [0010] At higher doses, when 5-ΗΤ2Α receptors are fully occupied, Compounds of Formula I modulate dopamine receptor protein phosphorylation. Therefore, Compounds of Formula I are particularly useful for the treatment of sleep disorders in patients suffering from psychosis such as schizophrenia, Parkinson’s disease and/or depression. [0011] Unlike dopamine receptor antagonists, Compounds of Formula I normalize brain dopamine activity, particularly in the prefrontal cortex. In addition, Compounds of Formula I also moderately bind to SERT. Therefore, Compounds of Formula I are particularly useful for the treatment of psychosis in patients suffering from depression. Unlike many traditional antipsychotic drugs, Compounds of Formula I show an improved selectivity profile with respect to off-target interactions such as adrenergic alpha-la, serotonin 5-HT2C, and histamine HI associated with many side effects compared to other antipsychotic drugs. Compounds of Formula I are therefore also useful as antipsychotic agents in patients who are unable to tolerate the side effects of convention antipsychotic drugs. [0012] In addition to binding to 5-ΗΤ2Α and dopamine D2 receptors, Compounds of Formula I also exhibit nanomolar binding affinity for SERT compared to known antidepressants. Therefore, Compounds of Formula I are useful for the treatment of depression in patients suffering from psychosis. [0013] Because Compounds of Formula I have a wider separation between 5-ΗΤ2α and D2 receptor affinities than other atypical antipsychotic drugs (~60 fold), they are additionally useful in reduction of dyskinesia. For example, they reduce L-DOPA-induced dyskinetic behavior in a mouse model. Without intending to be bound by theory, it is hypothesized that this is accomplished by virtue of the potent 5-ΗΤ2Α antagonism with minimal interference with L-DOPA-induced motor correction, by virtue of the low relative D2 receptor activity. Parkinson’s disease results from loss of DA neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. The primary motor symptoms of PD are treated by L-DOPA. Activation of medium spiny neurons in the dorsolateral striatum that project to the substantia nigra pars reticulata results in disinhibition of thalamocortical neurons and increased motor activity. Overactivity of this “direct” striatal pathway may contribute to the expression of dyskinesias, such as are commonly seen in PD patients being treated with dopaminergic drugs such as L-dopa. 5-ΗΤ2α receptors are localized in striatal medium spiny neurons. Compounds of Formula I are thus believed to block dyskinesias by blockade of 5-FIT2A receptors. [0014] Therefore, the invention provides methods as follows: [0015] A method (Method 1) for the treatment of one or more disorders involving serotonine 5-ΗΤ2α, dopamine D2 and/or serotonin reuptake transporter (SERT) pathway, comprising administering to a patient in need thereof a Compound of Formula I: wherein X is O, -ΝΗ or -Ν(ΟΤ3); and Υ is -O- or -C(O)-, in free or pharmaceutically acceptable salt form, at a dose which selectively blocks 5-HT2a receptors.

If not commercially available, starting materials for these processes may be made by procedures, which are selected from the chemical art using techniques which are similar or analogous to the synthesis of known compounds. All references cited herein are hereby incorporated in their entirety by reference. [0027] The words "treatment" and "treating" are to be understood accordingly as embracing prophylaxis and treatment or amelioration of symptoms of disease as well as treatment of the cause of the disease. [0028] The term “patient” may include a human or non-human patient. [0029] Compounds of the Invention refer to Compounds of Formula I, which include: in free or pharmaceutically acceptable salt form. Compounds of the invention are useful in anyofMethod I, or 1.1-1.37, particularly useful for the treatment of (1) sleep disorder, e.g., sleep maintenance insomnia; (2) depression in patients suffering from psychosis or Parkinson’s disease; (3) psychosis, e.g., schizophrenia, in a patient suffering from depression; or (4) mood disorder associated with psychosis, e.g., schizophrenia, or Parkinson’s disease. Compounds of the invention are also useful for any of Method II or 2.1-2.19, particularly for the treatment of sleep disorder, e.g., sleep maintenance insomnia. [0030] The phrase “depression in a patient suffering from psychosis” may include depressed patients suffering from a co-morbid psychotic disorder such as schizophrenia or it may include psychotic depressed patients wherein such patients suffer from severe depression wherein such depression accompanies hallucinations and/or delusions. [0031] The term “sleep maintenance insomnia” refers to the inability to stay asleep or to resume sleep after waking in the middle of the sleep cycle. [0032] The terms “Compounds of Formula I” and “Compounds of the Invention” may be used interchangeably and may be used as a sole therapeutic agent, or they may also be used in combination or for co-administration with other active agents. [0033] The discovery of the selective receptor profiles of the Compounds of Formula I not only provides effective treatment of 5-ΗΤ2Α, SERT and/or D2 receptor related disorders without or with minimal extrapyramidal side effects as claimed in the current invention, but also provides insight for the design of a combination therapy for the treatment of related disorders, wherein a Compound of Formula I may be used in combination with second therapeutic agents, particularly at lower dosages than when the individual agents are used as a monotherapy so as to enhance the therapeutic activities of the combined agents without causing the undesirable side effects commonly occur in conventional monotherapy. For example, as Compounds of the Invention bind to 5-ΗΤ2Α, D2 and/or SERT and are useful for treating patients with a combination of disorders, e.g., (a) psychosis with a co-morbid disorder of depression and/or sleep disorder; (b) depression with a co-morbid disorder of psychosis; (c) sleep disorder in patients suffering from psychosis, Parkinson disease, and/or depression; or (d) any combinations thereof, Compounds of Formula I may be simultaneously, sequentially, or contemporaneously administered with other anti-depressant, anti-psychotic, other hypnotic agents, and/or agents use to treat Parkinson’s disease or mood disorders. In another example, side effects may be reduced or minimized by administering a Compound of Formula I in combination with one or more second therapeutic agents in free or salt form, wherein the dosages of the second therapeutic agent(s) or both Compound of Formula I and the second therapeutic agents are lower than if the agents/compounds are administered as a monotherapy. [0034] In a particular embodiment, the Compounds of Formula I are useful to treat dyskinesia in a patient receiving dopaminergic medications, e.g., selected from levodopa and levodopa adjuncts (carbidopa, COMT inhibitors, ΜΑΟ-Β inhibitors), dopamine agonists, and anticholinergics, e.g., such as are used in the treatment of Parkinson’s disease. [0035] As demonstrated above, Compounds of Formula I have a wide separation between 5-HT2a and D2 receptor affinities than other atypical antipsychotic drugs (-60 fold). They reduce L-DOPA-induced dyskinetic behavior. Without intending to be bound by theory, it is hypothesized that this is accomplished by virtue of the potent 5-HT2A antagonism with minimal interference with L-DOPA-induced motor correction, by virtue of the low relative D2 receptor activity. Parkinson’s disease results from loss of DA neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. The primary motor symptoms of PD are treated by L-DOPA. Activation of medium spiny neurons in the dorsolateral striatum that project to the substantia nigra pars reticulata results in disinhibition of thalamocortical neurons and increased motor activity. Overactivity of this “direct” striatal pathway may contribute to the expression of dyskinesias. 5-HT2A receptors are localized in striatal medium spiny neurons. Compounds of Formula I are thus believed to block dyskinesias by blockade of 5-HT2A receptors. [0036] In another aspect of the current invention, Method I, e.g., any of 1.1-1.37, or Method II, e.g., any of 2.1-2.19, further comprises one or more therapeutic agents selected from compounds that modulate GABA activity (e.g., enhances the activity and facilitates GABA transmission), a GABA-B agonist, a 5-HT modulator (e.g., a 5 -HTla agonist, a 5-HT2a antagonist, a 5-HT2a inverse agonist, etc.), a melatonin agonist, an ion channel modulator (e.g., blocker) , a serotonin-2 antagonist/reuptake inhibitor (SARIs), an orexin receptor antagonist, an Η3 agonist, a noradrenergic antagonist, a galanin agonist, a CRH antagonist, human growth hormone, a growth hormone agonist, estrogen, an estrogen agonist, a neurokinin-1 drug, an anti-depressant, and an antipsychotic agent, e.g., an atypical antipsychotic agent, in free or pharmaceutically acceptable salt form (Method I-A and II-A respectively).

[0047] In some preferred embodiments, Method I-A or II-A is a method for the treatment of sleep disorders associated with psychosis, e.g., sleep disorders associated with schizophrenia or Parkinson’s disease. In another preferred embodiment, Method I-A or II-A is a method for the treatment of psychosis, e.g., schizophrenia or Parkinson’s disease in patients suffering from insomnia. In still another preferred embodiments, Method I-A or II-A is a method for the treatment of one or more sleep disorders.

Consequently, such patients would benefit from a monotherapy of a Compound of Formula I (e.g., Method I), wherein Compound of Formula I targets 5ΗΤ2Α receptors without or with minimal interaction with D2 receptors. In addition, these patients would also benefit from a combination therapy comprising a Compound of Formula I and one or more second therapeutic agents (e.g., Method I-A or II-A) wherein the dosages of the second agent(s) or both the second agents and the Compound of Formula I are lower than when they are administered as a monotherapy.

[0065] Membrane receptors: Cell lines stably expressing recombinant human 5-ΗΤ2Α receptors were generated by calcium phosphate mediated transfection with plamids containing receptor cDNAs (Fitzgerald et al., 1999) [0066] Stable expression of 5-ΗΤ2Α and 5-HT2C receptors in human embryonic kidney 293 Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen (ΗΕΚ293Ε) cells. Stable cell lines were generated by transfecting ΗΕΚ293Ε cells with plasmids containing human 5-ΗΤ2Α or 5-HT2C (VNV edited isoform cDNA using calcium phosphate. These plasmids also contained the cytomegalovirus intermediate early promoter to drive receptor expression, Epstein-Bar virus oriP for their maintenance as an extrachromosomal element, and the hph gene from Escherichia coli to yield hygromycin Β resistance (Horlick et al, 1997; Rominger et al., 1998). Transfected cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) containing dialyzed 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 degrees Celsius in a humid environment (5% C02) for 10 days. The 5-ΗΤ2Α cells were adapted to spinner culture for bulk processing, whereas it was necessary to maintain the 5-HT2C line as adherent cultures. On the day of harvest, cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, counted and stored at -80 degrees Celsius. [0067] Membrane preparations On the day of assay, pellets of whole cells (containing 1 χ 108 cells expressing the receptor of interest were thawed on ice and homogenized in 50 mM Tris-HCL (ph 7.7) containing 1.0 mM EDTA using a Brinkmann Polytron (ΡΤ-10; setting of 6 for 10s). The homogenate was centrifuged at 48,000 g for 10 minutes, and the resulting pellet was washed twice by repeated homogenization and centrifugation steps. The final pellet was resuspended in tissue buffer, and protein content was determined by the method of Bradford (1976) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. [0068] Tranfected ΗΕΚ293 cells (adherent) expressing human 5-ΗΤ2Β and 5-ΗΤ1Α receptors provided membrane source for these assays. Cell lines expressing rat D2-short and human D4 receptors were generated by calcium phosphate mediated transfection of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells with plasmids containing receptor cDNAs. Membranes prepared from rat frontal cortex and frozen liver were used for alpha-1A and alpha-IB adrenergic receptor binding. [0069] Measurement of agonist and antagonist radioligand binding to 5-ΗΤ2Α and 5-HT2C receptors [0070] N-[3H] Methylspiperone and [3H] mesulergine were used as the antagonist radioligands for the 5ΗΤ2Α and 5HT2C receptors, respectively, whereas [125]DOI was used as the agonist radioligand for both receptors. The high efficacy partial agonist [125]DOI was chosen over the full agonist [3H] -5ΗΤ because [3HJ-5HT gave inadequate levels of specific binding with the lower density 5-HT2C line. In addition, the relatively weak binding affinity of 5-HT for the 5-ΗΤ2Α receptor precluded its use as a radioligand. Equilibrium binding conditions for each radioligand at each receptor were established and optimized with respect to time, temperature, and protein concentration before saturation and competition experiments were conducted. [0071 ] For the agonist radioligand binding studies, assays were conducted in disposable polypropylene 96-well plates (Costar Corporation, Cambridge, Μ.Α., U.S.A.) and were initiated by addition of membrane homogenate in tissue buffer (10-30 micrograms per well.) to assay buffer (50 mM Tris-HCL, 0.5mM EDTA, lOmM pargyline, lOmM MgS04, and 0.05% ascorbic acid, pH 7.5) containing [125JDOI (final concentration, 0.3-.0.5 ηΜ with or without competing ligand. The reaction mixture was incubated to equilibrium for 45 min at 37 degrees Celsius and terminated by rapid filtration (cell harvester, Inotech Biosystems, Lansing, Michigan, U.S.A.) over GFF glass filter membranes that had been presoaked in 0.3% polyethylenimine. Filters were washed in ice-cold 50mM Tris-HCL buffer (ph 7.5) and then counted for radioactivity in a gamma counter at 80% efficiency. For saturation studies, 14 concentrations of [125IJDOI up to a maximal concentration of 6ηΜ were used. Specific binding at each concentration was determined in the presence of 10 micromolar mianserin. For competition experiments, a fixed concentration of [125]DOI (0.3-5 ηΜ) was competed with duplicate concentrations of ligand (12 concentrations ranging from 10 picomolar to 10 micromolar). [0072] For the antagonist radioligands, saturation experiments for [3H] mesulergine and N-[3H]methylspiperone were conducted to establish the equilibrium binding parameters of these radio-ligands for the 5-HT2C and 5-ΗΤ2Α receptors, respectively. The assay buffer used in the [3H] mesulergine assays was identical to that used in the [1251] DOI assay except for the addition of lOmM CaC12 for lOmM MgS04. The assay buffer used for the Ν[3H]methylspiperone assays was identical to that in the [1251] DOI assay except for the exclusion of 20mM NaCl. 5-HT2C membrane homogenate (40 micrograms of protein per well) was incubated with 14 concentrations of [3H]mesulergine (up to a final concentration of 20 ηΜ for 45 minutes at 37 degrees Celsius. For the 5-ΗΤ2Α assay, membrane homogenate (40 micrograms of protein per well) was incubated with 14 concentrations of N-[3H] methylspiperone for 30 minutes at 37 degrees Celsius. Excess (10 micromolar) mianserin or ketanserin was used to define nonspecific binding in the 5-HT2C and the 5-ΗΤ2Α assays, respectively. Assays were conducted and terminated as described for the agonist radioligand assays except that the filters were counted for radioactivity by liquid scintillation spectroscopy. [0073] Data Analysis [0074] The equilibrium disassociation constants (Kd values) and maximal number of binding sites (Bmax values) from the saturation experiments and apparent dissociation constants (Ki values) from the competition experiments were calculated using an iterative nonlinear regression curve-fitting program (GraphPad Prism, San Diego, C.A., U.S.A.)

[0075] Experimental procedure for Table II: [0076] Two different assays used to characterize affinity for the serotonin transporter were conducted at Caliper Life Sciences (Hopkinton, ΜΑ), a company that acquired NovaScreen. One assay (#100-0056), Transporter SERT, was a radioligand binding assay in rat forebrain using [3H]-N-Methyl-Citalopram as the radioligand at a concentration of 0.7 ηΜ. [3H]-N-Methyl-Citalopram has a Kd (binding affinity) of 1.7 η and a Bmax of 33.1 fmol/mg protein, The assay was validated using the following reference agent, imipramine (IMI) (Ki = 40.9 ηΜ). Other reference agents which may be used include paroxetine (Ki =0.1 ηΜ); fluoxetine (Ki =1.4 ηΜ); clomipramine (Ki = 2.8 ηΜ), serotonin (Ki = 55.6 ηΜ), and zimeldine (Ki= 68.3 ηΜ). [0077] The other assay, Transporter SERT (h) was a radioligand binding assay in human platelets using [3H]-N-Methyl-Citalopram as a radioligand at a concentration of 0.7 ηΜ. In this assay, the Kd for [3H]-N-Methyl-Citalopram was 2.5 ηΜ with a Bmax of 425 fmol/mg protein. The assay was validated using clomipramine (Ki = 0.2 ηΜ), citalopram (Ki = 3.0 ηΜ), and imipramine (Ki= 4.0 ηΜ). [0078] The third assay was conducted at Cerep (Celle L’Evescault, France). The third assay was a radioligand binding assay in human recombinant serotonin transporter in CHO cells using [3H]-imipramine as the radioligand at a concentration of 2 ηΜ. The assay was validated with unlabeled imipramine. (Ki= 2.7 ηΜ). [0079] EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Anti-depressant activity of a Compound of Formula I (Compound A) is measured using the social defeat (resident-intruder) mouse model for depression in which induced social withdrawal in rodents has been shown to be responsive to chronic, but not acute, anti-depressant drug treatment. The social defeat paradigm is based on the observation that psychosocial stress produces long-lasting alterations in the motivation of mice for social contact. Mice are subjected to a 10 day training period in which they are exposed to daily bouts of social stress, i.e., exposure to a different aggressive mouse (‘aggressor’) each day. They are then observed for their social behavior by measuring their tendency to approach an unfamiliar mouse, i.e., to spend time in the “Interaction Zone” which is in close proximity to the unfamiliar intruder. Mice are recorded by videotape and scored for social behavior (i.e., time in the Interaction Zone) and aversive behavior (i.e., time in the Comer Zones). Whereas normal mice display social interactions with unfamiliar mice (i.e., spend more time in the Interaction Zone), those mice exposed to repeated social defeat conditions display aversive reactions (i.e., spend more time in the Comer Zones) and spend less time than normal mice in contact with the unfamiliar test mouse (i.e., resident intruder or TARGET). [0080] The aversive responses of‘socially defeated’ mice are resilient; aversive behavior persists for weeks and can be elicited even 4 weeks after the end of the 10 day social stress exposure. The aberrant behavior of ‘socially defeated’ mice is responsive to chronic anti-depressant medications. Mice treated daily for 30 days with the anti-depressant drugs, fluoxetine or imipramine, display improved social interaction behavior (i.e., spend more time in the Interaction Zone versus the Comer Zones) when once again exposed to an unfamiliar mouse. Notably, chronic, but not acute, fluoxetine treatment improves social behavior. Since social behaviors measured by the social defeat paradigm, like human depression, are differentially responsive to chronic anti-depressant therapy, this paradigm may more accurately reflect beneficial actions of novel anti-depressant therapies, providing an advantage over traditional models (such as, Forced Swim and Tail Suspension models) that respond to acute pharmacological effects of drugs that are not necessarily predictive of chronic antidepressant efficacy. [0081] A representative compound of the present invention, Compound A, is tested in the social defeat paradigm. Normal male mice or mice subjected to social defeat stress once daily for lOd (Ν=8-12 C57B1/6 mice/group) are injected once daily for 29d Compound A (lmg/kg, IP) or vehicle solution (5%DMSO / 5%Tween-20 /15% PEG400/75% water). On day 30, all mice are tested for their social response to an unfamiliar mouse. Normal mice treated with Compound A once daily for 30d are healthy and normal-appearing and gained weight normally. These mice spend comparable time in the Interaction Zone as mice receiving the vehicle injection. As anticipated, mice that are subjected to lOd of social stress showed profound social defeat behavior, spending less than half the amount of time in the vicinity of an unfamiliar mouse than normal un-stressed mice. Socially-defeated mice treated chronically with Compound A, however, exhibited a significant increase in social behavior, spending almost twice as much time in the Interaction Zone when exposed to an unfamiliar mouse compared with socially-defeated mice receiving vehicle injections. Thus, the amount of time spent in the Interaction Zone by socially-defeated mice receiving Compound A is indistinguishable from normal mice receiving vehicle injections. Thus, socially-defeated mice spend significantly more time in the distant Control Zone(s) compared with normal (non-stressed) mice. The administration of a compound of the present invention significantly reverses this behavioral preference. [0082] Taken together, these data demonstrate that daily administration of Compound A induce a behavioral response in socially-stressed mice consistent with antidepressant efficacy and comparable to that elicited by anti-depressant medications such as fluoxetine. Example 3: Effectiveness in alleviating L-dopa induced dyskinesia [0083] Reduction in axial, orolingual and limb abnormal involuntary movements using standard Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) in dyskinesic mice injected daily with the compound in combination with L-DOPA indicates that co-administration of Compounds of Formula I reduces development and expression of AIMS associated with dyskinetic behavior (orolingual, axial, and limb) and locomotor activity (locomotive AIMS). Unilateral 6-OHDA-lesioned mice are administered a Compound of Formula I (Compound A) in accordance with the following schedule: Control: Day 1 - Day 9: Treatment with L-DOPA/benserazide Day 10: Treatment with L-DOPA/benserazide + Evaluation of AIMs (dyskinesia) EXPERIMENT 1 (Chronic): Development of dyskinesia Day 1 - Day 10: Treatment with L-DOPA/benserazide plus ITI-007 ITI-007PD. Day 11: Treatment with L-DOPA/benserazide + Evaluation of AIMs (dyskinesia) EXPERIMENT 2 (Acute): Expression of dyskinesia Day 1 - Day 10: Treatment with L-DOPA/benserazide Day 11: Treatment with L-DOPA/benserazide plus ITI-007 + Evaluation of AIMs (dyskinesia) Compound A (0.3 mg/kg IP) reduces dyskinetic behaviors after chronic co-administration with levodopa (10 mg/kg IP) to unilateral 6-OHDA-lesioned mice. The compound effectively reduces (by -50%) the development of dyskinetic behaviors in PD mice (i.e., Chronic treatment group). It has a less robust but still significant effect (by -25% reduction) on established dyskinetic behaviors (i.e., Acute treatment group). Taken together, these data suggest that Compounds of Formula I have utility for the prevention and treatment of L-DOPA-induced dyskinesias in PD. In addition to reducing L -DOPA-Induced Dyskinesias, as described above, the Compounds of Formula I will also reduce PD psychosis and depression, improve poor night time sleep and reduce excessive daytime sleepiness. Example 4 - Clinical Trial for Low Dose for Sleep Maintenance Insomnia and Sleep Disorders Associated with Psychiatric and Neurological Diseases [0084] As described above, at low doses, Compounds of Formula I are primarily serotonin 5-ΗΤ2Α antagonists. At higher doses, the compounds also act as a pre-synaptic partial agonist, post-synaptic antagonist at D2 dopamine receptors and inhibits the serotonin transporter. The present study evaluates a range of doses of a Compound of Formula I (Compound A) in patients with sleep maintenance insomnia (SMI). The main objectives of this study are to determine if the compound decreases wake time after sleep onset (WASO) as a measure of sleep maintenance efficacy and if the compound increases slow wave sleep (SWS) as a biomarker for 5-ΗΤ2Α brain receptor occupancy. [0085] The study is a randomized, double-blind, complete cross-over design. Eighteen patients experiencing SMI, aged 18 to 65, are included in the efficacy analysis. All subjects receive three single doses of Compound A and placebo, administered in the evening before overnight PSG recordings with one week washout between doses. SWS, WASO, other PSG measures, and safety are analyzed. [0086] Compound A dose-dependently decreases WASO (ρ = 0.032) and increases SWS (ρ = 0.002). Compound A preserves normal sleep architecture over the course of the night. Compound A is safe and well tolerated. Compound A dose-dependently and robustly decreases WASO in patients with SMI, suggesting efficacy for improved sleep maintenance. The magnitude of effect on WASO at the highest tested dose suggests that the unique pharmacological profile of Compounds of Formula I is useful in maintaining sleep above and beyond that provided by 5-ΗΤ2Α antagonism. In addition, increases in SWS sleep suggest that significant occupancy of brain 5-ΗΤ2Α receptors is occurring. Compounds of Formula I are useful for patients with SMI and for the treatment of sleep disorders associated with psychiatric and neurological diseases.

The compound does not impair latency to fall asleep (ρ = 0.455). The compound increases slow wave sleep during the first half of the night (first quarter ρ = 0.022; second quarter ρ ≈ 0.029) and increases stage 2 sleep during the second half of the night (third quarter ρ = 0.048, fourth quarter ρ = 0.004). The compound is safe and well-tolerated in patients with sleep maintenance insomnia. There are no serious adverse events. There are no dose-related adverse events or changes in safety parameters. The compound does not impair cognitive function as measured in the morning after PSG by the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST), the Word Pair Associates Test (WPAT), or the Leeds Psychomotor Test. [0088] Striatal D2 receptor occupancy in healthy volunteers using positron emission tomography is dose dependent.
