(E)-ethyl 2-((2,6-difluorobenzylidene)amino)acetate
A mixture of ethyl 2-aminoacetate hydrochloride (1.85 g, 13.25 mmol) and magnesium sulfate (3.19 g, 26.5 mmol) in CH2Cl2 (22.09 mL) (anhydrous) was treated with triethylamine (1.847 mL, 13.25 mmol), stirred for 10 minutes and treated with the 2,6-difluorobenzaldehyde (1.883 g, 13.25 mmol) as a solution in CH2Cl2 (Ëœ3 mL). The vial was capped and stirred at room temperature overnight. The solid material was filtered and the filtrate was concentrated. Toluene (5 mL) was added and the mixture was filtered again. The filtrate was concentrated to provide (E)-ethyl 2-((2,6-difluorobenzylidene)amino)acetate (2.9 g, 12.76 mmol, 96% yield) which was used directly in the next step.
