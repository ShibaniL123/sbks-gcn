FIELD This application generally relates to medical devices. In particular, the application relates to devices and methods for endoscopic surgery, e.g., for endoscopic trigger release surgery. BACKGROUND Endoscopic surgery is a minimally invasive surgical procedure that is performed through small incisions or natural body openings. An endoscopic procedure typically involves use of specialized devices and remote-control manipulation of instruments with indirect observation of the surgical field through an endoscope or similar device. Comparing to open surgery, endoscopic surgery may result in shorter hospital stays, or allow outpatient treatment. Trigger finger is characterized by catching, snapping or locking of the involved finger flexor tendon, associated with dysfunction and pain. Localized inflammation or nodular swelling of said flexor tendon causes a disparity in size between the flexor tendon and the surrounding retinacular pulley system, most commonly at the level of the first annular (A1) pulley. When the subject extends the involved finger, the tendon will “catch” on the pulley, followed by an abrupt popping of the tendon through the pulley. This results in a difficulty flexing or extending the finger and the “triggering” phenomenon. Typically, a first course of treatment for trigger finger is corticosteroid injections into the tendon sheath to reduce inflammation. When corticosteroid injection is not or no longer effective, surgical division of the A1 pulley is indicated. Conventional surgical techniques for trigger finger release require a fairly large incision over the A1 pulley and spreading of the incision to allow viewing and instrument access. These techniques can require a longer period of recovery than endoscopic methods and have greater levels of post-operative pain due to the incision size and level of manipulation during the procedure. Previous endoscopic techniques for trigger finger release require two incisions, one proximal and one distal to the A1 pulley and the threading of a cannula through the two incisions. An arthroscope is then inserted in the distal end of the cannula, while a cutting tool is inserted in the proximal opening. The cutting tool and arthroscope are then alternately moved forward or backward through the cannula. This does not allow direct visualization of the procedure from the point of view of the cutting tool during the separation of the pulley. Accordingly, the present application fulfils a need in the art for a minimally invasive surgical procedure for the treatment of trigger finger by providing a method for uniportal endoscopic trigger release surgery and a low-profile endoscopic surgical blade with a downward oriented blade having two forward facing cutting surfaces. SUMMARY One aspect of the present application relates to a low-profile blade for an endoscopic knife assembly, comprising an upper cutting surface and a lower cutting surface at its distal end and having a non-cutting radiused surface at the top end of the upper cutting surface, wherein said upper cutting surface and said lower cutting surface meet at a crotch therebetween, wherein the blade is sized to fit at a tip of an endoscope. Another aspect of the present application relates to an endoscopic knife assembly, comprising: a knife tube having a distal end and a proximate end and a low-profile blade comprising an upper cutting surface and a lower cutting surface at its distal end and having a non-cutting radiused surface at the top end of the upper cutting surface, wherein said upper cutting surface and said lower cutting surface meet at a crotch therebetween. Another aspect of the present application relates to an instrument kit for implementing an endoscopic surgical procedure comprising: an endoscopic knife assembly comprising a low-profile blade comprising an upper cutting surface and a lower cutting surface at its distal end and having a non-cutting radiused surface at the top end of the upper cutting surface, wherein said upper cutting surface and said lower cutting surface meet at a crotch therebetween. Another aspect of the present application relates to a method for treating trigger finger, comprising: establishing an entry portal at a location proximal to A1 pulley; inserting a cannula having open proximal and distal ends and an open slot extending along the length of the cannula; inserting an endoscope into the cannula, said endoscope comprising an endoscopic knife assembly having a low-profile blade comprising an upper cutting surface and a lower cutting surface at its distal end and having a non-cutting radiused surface at the top end of the upper cutting surface, wherein said upper cutting surface and said lower cutting surface meet at a crotch therebetween; advancing said endoscope so that the blade moves in contact with the A1 pulley through the slot; operatively engaging the A1 pulley with the blade; and advancing the blade through the cannula to divide the A1 pulley.

Uniportal endoscopic surgery allows the practitioner to visualize a target tissue and its surrounding tissues as well as perform a surgical procedure through a single entry portal. In some instances, the entry portal may be a natural opening, while in other instances the entry portal is an incision. In the case of an incision, generally only a single small incision must be made. In particular embodiments, the incision is less than or equal to about 2 cm in length. In more particular embodiments, the incision is less than or equal to about 1.5 cm in length. In still more particular embodiments, the incision is less than or equal to about 1 cm in length. The single small incision allows the patient to recover more quickly and begin therapy and/or resume normal activity as tolerated sooner. The uniportal endoscopic surgical procedure described herein can be used to implement a number of different surgical procedures. In some embodiments, the uniportal endoscopic surgical procedure is selected from the group consisting of trigger finger release, carpal tunnel release, cubital tunnel release, plantar fascia release, lateral release for patella realignment, release of the extensor tendons, release of the posterior and other compartments of the leg, and forearm fascial release. One embodiment of the present application relates to a method for a performing a uniportal endoscopic surgical procedure a target tissue in a subject. Generally, following the establishment of an entry portal, in some embodiments a blunt instrument, such as an elevator is inserted through the portal to establish an opening in the underlying tissue between the portal and the target tissue. A cannula having open proximal and distal ends and an open slot extending along the length of the cannula is inserted into the entry portal and extended through to the target tissue. In particular embodiments, the cannula is made of a clear plastic material so that the entirety of the surrounding tissue can be viewed with an arthroscope. In order to facilitate insertion of the cannula, the central lumen of the cannula comprises an obturator, which is withdrawn following insertion of the cannula. In some embodiments, the cannula has an inner diameter of between about 2.0 mm to about 3.5 mm. In further embodiments, the cannula has an inner diameter of between about 2.4 mm to about 3.0 mm. In a particular embodiment, the cannula has an inner diameter of about 2.7 mm. In some other embodiments, the cannula has an inner diameter of between about 3.3 mm to about 4.7 mm. In further embodiments, the cannula has an inner diameter of between about 3.7 mm to about 4.3 mm, in a particular embodiment, the cannula has an inner diameter of about 4.0 mm. An arthroscope is inserted into the cannula to view the target tissue and the surrounding tissues, assuring that the slot of the cannula is in proper orientation to the target tissue. The arthroscope is withdrawn and an arthroscope with a mounted endoscopic knife assembly having a low-profile blade that has upper and lower cutting surfaces that is radiused at its upper end is advanced into the cannula, with the knife blade aligned with the slot of the cannula. In some embodiments, the arthroscope used for viewing the target tissue and the surrounding tissues is the same unit as the arthroscope comprising a mounted endoscopic knife assembly. In other embodiments, the arthroscope used for viewing the target tissue and the surrounding tissues is a different unit from the arthroscope comprising a mounted endoscopic knife assembly. The arthroscope comprising a mounted endoscopic knife assembly is advanced further through the cannula so that the blade moves in contact with the target tissue through the slot, operatively engaging the target tissue with the blade. The blade is further advanced through the cannula to divide the target tissue. In one particular embodiment, the operative procedure is trigger finger release. In another particular embodiment, the establishing an entry portal comprises making an incision. In another particular embodiment, the target tissue is the A1 pulley. In another particular embodiment, the inserting of said arthroscope comprising an endoscopic knife assembly having a low-profile blade that has an upper cutting surface and a lower cutting surface is followed by the insertion of an arthroscope comprising a means for visualization of the results of the endoscopic surgical procedure on the target tissue. The present invention is further illustrated by the following examples which should not be construed as limiting. The contents of all references, patents and published patent applications cited throughout this application, as well as the Figures and Tables, are incorporated herein by reference. Example 1 Uniportal Endoscopic Trigger Release In a patient presenting with trigger finger of the middle or ring finger, a 1 cm incision is made just proximal to the A1 pulley on the distal palmar crease proximate to the affected digit. An elevator is introduced into the incision and used to create a plane superficial to the flexor tendon sheath. The elevator is withdrawn. A slotted cannula with an obturator inserted therein is introduced into the incision and advanced through the plane created by the elevator. The slot of the cannula is oriented facing the flexor tendon sheath. The obturator is removed from the cannula. An arthroscope is introduced into the cannula and advanced to visualize the A1 pulley and A2 pulley as shown in FIGS. 5A-B. The arthroscope is withdrawn. An endoscopic knife assembly having a low-profile blade having an upper cutting surface and a lower cutting surface is fastened onto an arthroscope. The scope and blade assembly is advanced into the cannula, dividing the A1 pulley. Having the endoscopic knife assembly mounted directly on the arthroscope allows direct visualization of the procedure from the point-of-view of the blade, allowing visualization of the A2 pulley and avoiding damage to the A2 pulley (FIGS. 6A-B). The scope and blade assembly is withdrawn from the cannula. An arthroscope is again advanced into the cannula to visualize the cut edges of the A1 pulley, as well as visualization of the underlying flexor tendon (FIGS. 7A-B). While visualizing the tendon, release of the tendon is confirmed by passive manipulation of the digit through its range of motion. The absence of triggering is confirmed by having the subject flex and extend the affected digit. The arthroscope is withdrawn and the cannula is removed from the incision. The wound is closed and a soft bandage is applied. The patient is encouraged to begin early finger motion following surgery and to resume daily activities as tolerated.
