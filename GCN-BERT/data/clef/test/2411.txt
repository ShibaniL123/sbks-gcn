Step B: Ethyl 7-chloro-2,6-bis(trifluoromethyl)pyrazolo[1,5-c]pyridine-3-carboxylate. To a cooled solution (0° C.) of 2-chloro-3-(trifluoromethyl)pyridin-1-ium-1-amine 2,4,6-trimethylbenzenesulfonate (1.83 g, 4.61 mmol) in DMF (15 mL) were added ethyl 4,4,4-trifluorobut-2-ynoate (550 μL, 3.85 mmol) and triethylamine (640 μL, 4.59 mmol). The reaction mixture was stirred at rt for 18 h. The mixture was cooled to 0° C. and 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-p-benzoquinone (2.1 g, 9.25 mmol) was added. After stirring at rt for 1 h, the mixture was diluted with EtOAc (300 mL) and washed sequentially with water (2×100 mL), 10% aq. NaHCO3 (50 mL) and water (50 mL). The organic layer was dried over MgSO4, filtered and evaporated. Purification (FCC, SiO2; 40-60% EtOAc/hexanes) afforded the title compound (715 mg, 51%) as a white crystalline solid.
