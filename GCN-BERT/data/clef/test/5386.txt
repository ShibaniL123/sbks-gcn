Acetic acid (6 ml) and water (2 ml) were added to the solution of Compound (19) (603.0 mg, 1.07 mmol) in THF (2 ml). The mixture was stirred for 2.5 hrs at 45°C and then cooled to room temperature. To the reaction mixture, 8N-sodium hydroxide aqueous solution (13 ml), ethyl acetate (20 ml) and water (20 ml) were added. The mixture was stirred vigorously. The aqueous layer was separated from the organic layer and then extracted with ethyl acetate for 3 times. The combined organic layer was washed with water and saturated aqueous sodium chloride. The organic layer was dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and then evaporated. Two times of chromatography on a Silica gel column (1st purification: FL-60D 25g, hexane : 2-propanol = 100:10 / 2nd purification: FL-60D 18g, hexane : 2-propanol = 100:5) gave Compound (20) (336.4 mg, 0.918 mmol, 85.8% yield).
