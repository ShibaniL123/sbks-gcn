Step 8: Preparation of N-(7-(1-(3-(cyanomethyl)-1-(methylsulfonyl)azetidin-3-yl) -1H-pyrazole-4-yl)benzo[d]oxazole-2-yl)cyclopropanecarboxamide(WX30)
To 2-(3-(4-(2-aminobenzo[d]oxazole-7-yl)-1H-pyrazole-1-yl)-1-(methylsulfonyl) azetidin-3-yl)acetonitrile (100 mg, 268.5 umol) and triethylamine (54 mg, 537.1 umol) in acetonitrile (3 mL) was added dropwise cyclopropanecarboxylic acid chloride (30 mg, 287.3 umol) under the protection of nitrogen. The mixture was stirred at 30Â°C for reacting for 12 hours. Low yield for the reaction was detected and showed from LCMS. The reaction mixture was directly spun dry, and the residue was separated and purified through preparative TLC(DCM:MeOH=10:1) to give N-(7-(1-(3-(cyanomethyl)-1-(methylsulfonyl)azetidin-3-yl)-1H-pyrazole-4-yl)benzo[d]oxazole-2-yl) cyclopropanecarboxamide(10 mg, 8.45% yield) as a yellow solid.
