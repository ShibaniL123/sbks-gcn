CASSAVA STARCH BASED BAKED FOOD PRODUCT The present invention relates to a process for preparing a novel cassava starch based baked food product, more specifically to a process for preparing a cassava starch based baked food product having a substantially controlled expansion and unique texture. The present invention also relates to the cassava starch based baked food product having a substantially controlled expansion and unique texture, and obtainable by the process of the invention. Background Art Cassava (Manihot esculenta) is an important subsistence crop in many tropical areas including, for example, Asia, Africa and Latin America. The cassava roots are a major source of carbohydrates such as starch. This starch from the cassava root can be extracted to produce cassava starch also known as tapioca starch or tapioca flour. It is well known in the art that cassava flour is made by cooking, drying and grinding cassava root to a fine powder. This is different to cassava starch which is made from the starch of the cassava plant whereas the cassava flour is the ground root. Various varieties of cassava exist, for example cassava may be categorised by the content of toxic cyanogenic compounds present in the fresh root. These cyanogenic compounds occur naturally in the fresh roots containing cyanogenic glucosides such as linamarin and lotaustralin. The contents of cyanogenic compounds in the cassava root may vary, depending on cassava variety, harvest time, environmental conditions and farm practices. The low cyanide or sweet cassava is typically used for direct consumption as a staple food, whereas the medium toxic cyanide is detoxified by various processes such as cooking, boiling and fermenting for example and then processed to chips, pellets and starch for various industrial applications. Thus, it is commonly known in the art that there are two main types of cassava starch, 'sour cassava starch' wherein the cassava starch requires further processing typically a fermenting step and 'sweet cassava starch' wherein no further processing is needed as aforementioned. The production of cassava starch based food products is highly desirable in many countries, such as Brazil. Wheat flour is typically the mainstay of baked goods, but it contains gluten which can be to a certain extent undesired. Many consumers wish to decrease the amount of gluten in their diets and so there is a growing demand for gluten-free food products. The cassava starch is gluten free which provides additional nutritional benefits to the consumer. For many applications it is desired that gluten- free food products also provide the desired texture, mouth-feel and taste that consumers are accustomed to. For example the 'Biscoito de Polvilho' a popular product made from sour cassava starch, is one of the most commonly consumed snacks in Brazil. This product has a characteristic flavour and crunchy texture. Another popular Brazilian sour cassava starch product is the bread-like 'Pao de Queijo'. Current cassava starch baked products are made from traditional recipes known in the art using conventional processes involving mixing the cassava starch with water and oil, both heated to high temperatures followed by baking using conventional heat treatments. For example, the traditional process for making 'Polvilho' products such as the popular 'Biscoito de Polvilho' involves water heated to very high temperatures, usually 90 degrees Celsius, which is then typically added slowly to the Cassava Starch. In addition to the limitations such process may pose to industrial applicability due to the high temperatures employed, such typical 'Polvilho' products are often associated with an intrinsic fragility which causes them to break or deform when stored or transported when packaged. Furthermore the highly expansive properties of cassava starch when mixed with water results in products baked with uncontrolled expansion, leading to variable and irregular shaped products. GB 484 468 discloses a process wherein a dough consisting of tapioca flour and water is prepared, which is then further cooked using boiling oil to give a product that swells significantly to many times its original size. Furthermore, the aforementioned process requires the use of oil heated to very high temperatures. US 4 923 709 discloses a method for producing a new cassava flour from the starch product and processes for producing products from cassava flour; the aforementioned process does not disclose producing baked products directly from sour cassava starch, nor it describes baking of a mixture between at least two heated baking surfaces. 2006-BR-0003223 discloses a process to make a polvilho cookie involving the use of boiling water and fat. The high expansion capabilities of cassava starch when mixed with water makes its processing difficult. Typical processing conditions include having to heat up the water to a very high temperature, usually up to 90°C or the boiling point of water. In addition the oil used in the traditional recipe is also heated to high temperatures typically 60°C. The processing of the batter thus requires very slow addition of heated water and oil to the cassava starch and long baking times, for example, traditional 'Biscoito de polvilho' recipies require baking times of 20 minutes, which make it commercially not viable. Additionally, the products obtained are of undefined shape which is normally not appealing for a customer. Accordingly there is a need to identify a process which would be able to deliver a cassava starch based baked food product, having substantially controlled expansion and which could be easily and conveniently applied in industry for example by use of standard equipment and avoidance of high temperatures during processing of the batter and long baking times. Furthermore, there is a need to develop a cassava starch based baked food product with unique texture and defined shape which would be appealing for the consumer, the product also resulting in having nutritional advantages for some consumers as it is gluten-free. Summary of invention The present invention provides a process for making a cassava starch based baked food product comprising the steps of a) preparing a mixture comprising at least a cassava starch based ingredient and water and b) baking the mixture between at least two heated baking surfaces. It was surprisingly found that baking a mixture comprising at least one cassava starch based ingredient and water between at least two heated baking surfaces gave cassava starch based baked food products endowed with defined shape given by controlled expansion and endowed with a unique texture and properties. Advantageously, it was also found that according to the present invention water could be added to the mixture at a significantly lower temperature than required in the traditional recipes and in the state of the art, specifically at a temperature much lower than the boiling point of water. The present invention also relates to the products obtainable according to the process of the invention. It was surprisingly found that by carrying out the baking process according to the present invention; a cassava starch based baked food product was formed having, advantageously, a substantially controlled expanded shape with a unique texture and properties. As a consequence, the products according to the present invention are evenly shaped, thicker in appearance and less likely to break and/or deform in the packaging than other products already known in the art. It is further commonly understood in the art for example, in Manley's technology of biscuits and crackers and cookies, Fourth edition' it is described therein that flour with very low protein will give weak and fragile wafers. According to the present invention, it was surprisingly found that the cassava starch baked wafers produced according to the process of the present invention were thicker, and less fragile than standard wafers known in the art.
