METHOD OF REPAIRING AGE AND DISEASE IMMUNE DYSFUNCTION AND CEUUUUAR SENESCENCE WITH UYMPHOID STEM CEUUS AND THEN RE-APPLYING THOSE FOR THERAPEUTIC USE CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS [0001] This application claims benefit of the priority of U.S. Provisional Application Serial No. 61/821,319, filed on May 9, 2013, and of U.S. Provisional Application Serial No. 61/893,444, filed on October 21, 2013, the contents of each of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. HELD OF THE INVENTION [0002] This invention relates to methods for treatment of diseases of ageing including immunosenescence, immune dysfunction, inflammation and impairment of early lymphoid lineage differentiation. The invention more specifically relates to the use of granulocyte colony stimulating factors to assist in stem cell mobilization, optionally in combination with the application of a method of delivering precise magnetic field patterns which agree with the body’s own natural magnetic field patterns, and further in combination with re-infusion of stem cell containing compositions, such as previously collected autologous cells and/or plasma, optionally including allogeneic (healthy donor) cells and blood plasma. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0003] The phenomenon which manifests as growth arrest after a period of apparently normal cell proliferation is known as Replicative Senescence (RS). Replicative Senescence is seen in a) cells from adults of all ages b) embryonic tissues, and c) animals. [0004] Aging is associated with alterations of the immune system including impairments in innate immunity, T-lymphopoiesis and B-lymphopoiesis and these impairments contribute to immunosenescence and immune dysfunction in affected individuals. Multipotent hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) aging contributes to impairments in early lymphoid lineage differentiation. Immunosenescence with immune dysfunction and increased inflammation is a primary cause of aging and diseases such as anemia, chronic diseases, autoimmune disorders, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, infection, metabolic diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, protein energy malnutrition and frailty. [0005] Oscillating magnetic fields have been used for years in the course of administering physical therapy to clinic patients suffering from bone fractures. These devices are typically called bone growth stimulators. Bone growth occurs as a result of stem cell stimulation, activation and differentiation. These device signals, however, are a series of pulses or oscillating waves, which have symmetry typical of electronic-generated signals (see Figure 1 “Common electronic-generated signals”). More recently, researchers have discovered that the body emits its own complex electromagnetic field pattern. Unique patterns are associated with immunosenescence and immune dysfunction, stress, or disease. By capturing these abnormal patterns, re-storing and re-admitting these patterns to the target patient, researchers theorize that the normal “healing process” may be restored more effectively, as the patterns would be natural biologic patterns. [0006] What is unique about the instantly disclosed method described is the confluence of these unique processes to promulgate a therapeutic modality. [0007] The number of Cumulative population doublings (CPDs) cells undergo in culture varies considerably between cell types and species. Early results suggested a relation between CPDs cells could endure and the longevity of the species from which the cells were derived, e.g. cells from the Galapagos tortoise, which can live over a century, divide about 110 times while mouse cells divide roughly 15 times. Cells taken from patients with progeroid syndromes such as Werner syndrome (WS)-exhibit far fewer CPDs than normal humans. Certain “immortal” cell lines can divide indefinitely without reaching RS, e.g. embryonic germ cells and most cell lines derived from tumors, such as HeLa cells. [0008] Biomarkers of cell senescence include: 1) Growth arrest - Senescent cells are growth arrested in the transition from phase G1 to phase S of the cell cycle. The growth arrest in RS is irreversible in the sense that growth factors cannot stimulate the cells to divide even though senescent cells can remain metabolically active for long periods of time; 2) Cellular morphology - Senescent cells are bigger and a senescent population has more diverse morphotypes than cells at earlier CPDs (Note Figure 12 which shows Normal human fibroblasts (left) and fibroblasts showing a senescent morphology (three cells on the right). Notice the common elongated morphology of senescent cells. 3) Senescence-associated P-galactosidase (SA P-gal) activity - In vitro and in vivo, the percentage of cells positive for SA P-gal increases with, respectively, CPDs and age . In immortal cell lines, such as HeLa tumor cells, the percentage of cells positive for SA P-gal does not correlate with CPDs. The increase in SA P-gal also correlates with the appearance of the senescent morphotypes; 4) Polyploid Increase - the percentage of polyploid cells-i.e., cells with three or more copies of chromosomes-has been shown to increase. Deletions in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) have also been observed both during RS and during aging in vivo, at least in some cells; 5) Change in Gene Expression Levels - The expression levels of several genes change during in vitro cellular aging One important type of gene overexpressed in senescent cells are inflammatory regulators like interleukin 6 (IL6); proinflammatory proteins secreted by senescent cells in driving senescence, which may lead to positive feedback loops and to senescence induction in normal cells near senescent cells; 6) Metalloproteinase and Heat Shock Protein Production - Senescent cells also display an increased activity of metalloproteinases which degrade the extracellular matrix and a decreased ability to express heat shock proteins; 7) Telomere shortening - the primary cause of RS in human fibroblasts which have a major role in aging. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0009] The phenomenon which manifests as growth arrest after a period of apparently normal cell proliferation is known as Replicative Senescence (RS). Replicative Senescence is seen in a) cells from adults of all ages b) embryonic tissues, and c) animals. The instant invention discloses treatment modalities for treating a number of maladies which result from the aging process. [0010] Aging is associated with alterations of the immune system including impairments in innate immunity, T-lymphopoiesis and B-lymphopoiesis and these impairments contribute to immunosenescence and immune dysfunction in affected individuals. Multipotent hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) aging contributes to impairments in early lymphoid lineage differentiation. Immunosenescence with immune dysfunction and increased inflammation is a primary cause of aging and diseases such as anemia, chronic diseases, autoimmune disorders, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, infection, metabolic diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, protein energy malnutrition and frailty.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION [0055] Aging is associated with alterations of the immune system including impairments in innate immunity, T-lymphopoiesis and B-lymphopoiesis and these impairments contribute to immunosenescence in affected individuals. [0056] An altered differentiation capacity of Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) has been causally linked to a reduction in lymphopoiesis during aging in mice and in man. Whole genome expression analyses indicated that HSC intrinsic alterations in gene expression contribute to this phenotype. The pool of HSCs comprises different HSC subpopulations that are biased toward myeloid or lymphoid differentiation. There is evidence that upon aging myeloid- biased HSCs are maintained, whereas lymphoid-biased HSCs get lost. These result in the imbalance in myelolymphopoiesis occurring with aging. The molecular causes of this age-associated selection of HSC subpopulations remain to be delineated. [0057] Accumulation of DNA damage has been associated with aging of HSCs in both mice and man. Moreover, studies on telomerase knockout mice (Terc -/-) revealed evidence that chronic DNA damage signaling in response to telomere dysfunction leads to an acceleration of hematopoietic skewing with a strong decrease in lymphopoiesis involving both cell intrinsic checkpoints and alterations in the blood circulatory environment. HSC aging contributes to impairments in early lymphoid lineage differentiation. This process associates with a selective increase of myeloid-competent HSCs and a decrease in lymphoid-competent HSCs during aging. This age-associated skewing in the maintenance of subpopulations of HSCs contributes to defects in lymphopoiesis and decreasing immune function during aging. Molecular mechanisms that can induce stem cell aging include the accumulation of DNA damage and telomere dysfunction and it is possible that stem cell intrinsic checkpoint as well as alteration in the stem cell environment (niche and systemic environment) can contribute to age-dependent selection of HSC subpopulations. The selective survival of distinct subpopulations of HSCs also contributes to the development of malignancies in the hematopoietic system and the selective maintenance of myeloid-competent HSCs enhances the risk of mutation accumulation in the myeloid lineage thereby leading to an increase of myelo-proliferative diseases during aging. The loss of lymphoid-competent HSCs may induce lymphoid lineage derived malignancies by impairing proliferative competition in lymphoid progenitor cell niches. Along these lines it has been shown that age-associated impairments in hematopoietic progenitor cell proliferation select for an outgrowth of malignant clones. In contrast to the possible influences on tumor promotion, it is conceivable that the depletion of HSC subpopulations could serve as a tumor suppressor mechanism involved in the depletion of damaged HSCs. Cell surface marker combinations can subdivide human hematopoietic cells into different subpopulations which can also be subdivided into lymphoid-competent and/or myeloid-competent subpopulations during human aging. The stepwise process of the lymphoid differentiation of multipotent hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in human bone marrow has been assumed to begin with expression of the cell surface antigen CD10 (CALLA or ΜΜΕ) on CD34+ progenitors, based on the finding that CD 10+ progenitors lack myeloid and erythroid potential but are able to generate all lymphoid lineages. However, subsequent studies have shown that CD34+, CD10+ cells, even those without expression of lineage markers (Lin-: CD3-, CD14-, CD15-, CD19-, CD56-, CD235a-), show a strong bias toward Β cell potential with relatively little Τ cell or natural killer (ΝΚ) cell potential. CD34+, Lin-, CD 10+ cells that lack expression of CD24 are precursors of the CD34+, Lin-CD10+CD24+ population but nonetheless show molecular evidence of commitment to the Β cell lineage, with expression of several Β cell-specific genes. L-selectin (CD62L) is expressed on lymphocytes and mediates homing to peripheral lymphoid organs. Studies have reported that upregulation of CD62L expression on c-Kit+Lin-Sca-l+ mouse bone marrow cells correlates with loss of erythroid and megakaryocyte potential and efficient thymic engraftment. In the progenitor hierarchy of the lymphoid commitment of human cells, a stage of lymphoid priming that precedes commitment to the Β lymphoid lineage, either before or independently of CD 10 expression is a CD34+,Lin-, CD 10- progenitor subpopulation in human bone marrow that has high expression of CD62L and that is devoid of clonogenic myeloid or erythroid potential. In stromal cultures, these cells are able to generate Β cells, ΝΚ cells and Τ cells, as well as monocytic and dendritic cells. [0058] Aging is associated with alterations of the immune system including impairments in T-lymphopoiesis and Β-lymphopoiesis and these impairments contribute to immunosenescence in affected individuals. Immunosenescence with immune dysfunction and increased inflammation is a primary cause of aging and diseases such as anemia of chronic diseases, autoimmune disorders, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, infection, metabolic diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, and protein energy malnutrition. [0059] Natural magnetic field waveforms have been discovered associated with biologic processes ever since the discovery and development of the SQUID (Figure 3 “SQUID installation at Vanderbilt University”). These waveforms appear in complex patterns such as shown here in (Figure 4 “Natural complex biologic waveforms found in the body”). [0060] Although there is nothing new about the measurement and recording of these waveform the application of these waveforms in a useful clinic device has just recently been possible through the advance of modern electronics. Thus the method of identification, extraction and isolating and then delivering those magnetic field patterns in a therapeutically effective manner is a primary objective of the invention (Figure 6 “Extract, analyze and derive”). [0061] Researchers have theorized since the late 1960’s that the information content of a magnetic field waveform is received and recognized by the body (if delivered in a specific manner) and is useful for therapeutic effects. The modern bone growth stimulator is one example of such a device, whereby this device has proven useful in medical applications to enhance the repair and growth of bone tissue. The method and device to deliver according to the method should, in theory, prove to be more effective in delivering medical therapy to a patient. [0062] Natural biologic waveforms have been measured for many body processes. The graphic ( Figure 4 “Natural complex biologic waveforms found in the body”) describes several of these processes. More recently, sophisticated and sensitive recording technology has been used to record biologic processes with even greater sensitivity, such as the firing of a single nerve axon. Biologic waveforms have also been associated with specific diseases and inflammatory processes which cause activation of stem cells local to the disease site and being mobilized from the bone marrow into the blood to reach the disease site. These waveforms are speculated to have an association with the body’s natural healing processes. Researchers have also speculated that external electromagnetic signals applied to the body are ignored unless they are: • Damaging signals, such as ionizing signals (e.g. X-Ray) • Benign signals which affect a site of injury (e.g. diseases of ageing and diseases of ageing with immunosenescence and immune dysfunction and inflammation). [0063] The device proposed herein is to deliver natural biologic waveform electromagnetic fields to a site of injury, and so function more effectively than the signals used previously in combination with methods of enhancing the concentration of stem cells at the disease sites. The method is the actual use of these natural biologic waveforms in the generation and delivery of those waveforms suited to a particular injury. Process to capture, store and replicate biologic waveforms [0064] The entire process begins with: • Discovery of the biologic signal • Isolation of the repair signal • Storage of the repair signal • Generation of the repair signal • Delivery of the repair signal • Conformity to a specified protocol Discovery of the biologic signal [0065] The discovery process begins with a known pathologic condition. For example, a cancer has well-understood biologic processes at work which serve to repair the immune dysfunction and immune senescence and inflammation. These processes all involve the generation and emitting of natural biologic waveforms. [0066] The discovery, therefore, begins with a patient who has a known condition and a sensitive measurement device, known as a SQUID (Superconductive QUantum Interference Device), to detect and measure the condition waveforms. This device, or a representative of the device, is shown in Figure 3 “SQUID installation at Vanderbilt University”. The waveforms generated by the body or biologic organisms have certain specific characteristics. Examples of certain waveforms are shown in Figure 5 “Natural complex biologic waveforms of a frog nerve”. [0067] The measurement of the natural biologic waveform caused by the underlying pathologic condition is facilitated by the SQUID apparatus, which is routinely used for measuring those types of waveforms. Conversely, the body may emit certain natural biologic waveforms that are associated with the normal biologic function. That is, those waveforms are captured from a healthy subject. Isolation of the repair signal [0068] The natural biologic waveform of the patient target pathology and the patient injury-free target are expected to differ in certain characteristics. In fact, Romanian researchers have reported in the literature that these signals do indeed exist and can be isolated. The isolation process may take place by digitizing those waveforms, analyzing and then performing certain digital operations on the patterns, using pattern-recognition or other graphical technology. Isolation of the waveforms is a straightforward procedure, by which measurements are taken of: • A healthy subject • A subject with diseases of ageing and diseases of ageing with immunosenescence and immune dysfunction and inflammation [0069] Each measurement is captured and digitized using mechanical or electrical conversion means and placed into a common file format. The procedure to further isolate the suspected natural biologic signal is a process whereby a comparison of the two waveforms yields a “difference” waveform (see “Extract, analyze and derive” on page 10), which is then presented as the suspected biologic waveform contributing to the healing process. [0070] The original source waveforms, e.g. the “Disease” waveform, and The “Normal” waveform are used as reference waveforms, in a study to compare the relative effectiveness of those waveforms against the “difference” waveform. Store of the repair signal [0071] The final selected repair signal is then stored in electronic form, typically in a digitized fashion, or it may be stored in printed graphical form. This may use a common flat-file or relational database for the electronic storage medium. Generation of the repair signal [0072] The stored electrical signal pattern is then re-generated in a device (here called a Modulator) which then powers an external applicator. The re-generation of these electrical patterns may take place in a number of ways: • Using an internal digital look-up table • Using an internal derived equation, which is then solved • Using a series of signals, such as is found in a fourier series Once the basic repair signal is then re- generated, it is then modulated as to: • Frequency • Intensity • Duty Cycle by the generating device. This final signal is then amplified and prepared for delivery to the patient or subject. Delivery of the repair signal [0073] The repair signal, having been captured, stored, processed and modulated, is now ready to be delivered. Magnetic fields are delivered by passing a current through a wire loop assembly of various forms, as is generically illustrated in Figure 7. These types may be: • A solenoid • A toroid • A planar (or flat) coil • A Helmholtz coil [0074] The solenoid magnetic field pattern may be seen in Figure 8 “Use of solenoid design”. The toroid magnetic field patterns may be seen in Figure 9 “Toroidal magnetic field applicator”. The planar coil design may be seen on Figure 11 “Planar field applicator”. The Helmholtz design may be seen on Figure 10 “Helmholtz coil field applicator”. [0075] Prior to delivering the current to the various types of applicators, the Modulator power must amplify the stored signals to the level whereby they may energize the coils. This amplification may require the expenditure of power levels of up to 500 watts in the case of linear amplification, or may be significantly lower in the case of a switching- type (digital) design. Conformity to a specified protocol [0076] The conformity to a specified protocol may require specifying certain types of stage treatment procedures. These procedures typically require: • A certain time of administered exposure • A certain time between exposures • A certain exposure dose • A certain dose design • A certain dose duty cycle [0077] For example, the administered exposure may require stages exposures of 30,60 or 90 minute exposures over the course of several days. The exposures may be staged according to a certain delay between each exposure. The dosage may be adjusted up or down according to the needs of the subject. The dose design itself is specified, according to a selection of one or several types of waveforms which are stored in the machine, and the dose may have to regulated according to a certain duty cycle. [0078] Various embodiments of the invention are illustrated in the following examples. Example 1 [0079] This protocol will assess the efficacy of stem cell activation with stem cell mobilization using a granulocyte colony stimulating factor (g-csf) and autologous stem cell rich plasma to improve the levels of anti-aging bio-markers in the recipients [0080] .They will receive daily G-CSF at a dose of 5 to 15ug/kg intravenously or subcutaneously for 5-7 days monthly for 12 months. Assessments measuring the anti-aging bio-markers and clinical markers of aging as reported via a 13-item Clinical evaluation will be done at baseline before starting treatments and will be repeated every 3 months during the treatment period, and every three months for 12 additional months after the completion of the treatment period. Half of the recipients will be randomly selected to also receive Autologous Stem Cell Rich plasma in aliquots of 50 ml monthly for 12 months in the second 12 month study period. The Autologous plasma donors are also plasma recipients. Autologous Donors will be dosed with G-CSF for three days prior to undergoing plasmapheresis. This will stimulate a significantly increased number of stem cells in the plasma. The yield of stem cell rich plasma expected from the pheresis is about 2 liters. The plasma will be divided into aliquots of about thirty-six 50 ml doses and 5 ml testing aliquots. Samples will be frozen until such time as the same Plasma Recipient is being treated. [0081] There will be eight primary biomarker measurements evaluated at baseline, and after treatment for 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, and 12 months. These same evaluations will continue every three months for an additional year to examine the long-term effect of the treatment. These assessments are: 1. Immunosenescence Panel 2. CCL11 3. TGFBeta 1 growth factor 4. Nuclear Factor kappa beta (NFkB) 5. DHEA-S 6. Plasma Insulin 7. Telomere length 8. Cytokine Multiplex 18 [0082] There will also be clinical markers (group of 13) evaluated at the quarterly visits during physical exam that will provide secondary efficacy data for evaluation. Safety Assessments: [0083] Baseline physical exam, blood chemistry will be done on all recipients at baseline. These will be repeated after 3, 6, 9, and 12 months of treatment, and quarterly for 1 year following the completion of the last treatment. [0084] Safety and tolerability will be monitored through continuous reporting of adverse events. Example 2 [0085] This protocol will assess the efficacy of stem cell activation with stem cell mobilization with granulocyte colony stimulating factor G-CSF) and autologous stem cell rich plasma to improve the levels of anti-aging bio-markers in the recipients [0086] Patients will be treated with G-CSF stem cell mobilization and Autologous Stem Cell Rich Plasma to improve the levels of anti-aging biomarkers in the recipients. Primary Objective: [0087] During treatment, patients will continue to be evaluated for improvement in the levels of anti-aging biomarkers in the recipients during treatment for one year and for one year following the end of treatment. Secondary Objectives: [0088] Improvement of clinical markers of aging as reported via a 13-item Clinical evaluation Study Design: [0089] The study is classified as Phase I/II since it will be using a long-standing safe ‘drug’ (G-CSF; Autologous plasma; ergo Phase II) but in a novel way (ergo Phase I). [0090] They will receive daily G-CSF at a dose of 5 to 15ug/kg intravenously or subcutaneously for 5-7 days monthly for 12 months. On the first of the 5-7 day period they will also receive Autologous Stem Cell Rich plasma in aliquots of 50 ml monthly for 12 months. Assessments measuring the biomarkers will be done at baseline before starting treatments and will be repeated every 3 months during the treatment period, and every three months for 12 additional months after the completion of the treatment period. Additionally, clinical markers will be collected at those same time points. [0091] Autologous Donors will be dosed with G-CSF at a dose of 5 to 15ug/kg intravenously or subcutaneously for 5-7 days for three days prior to undergoing plasma pheresis. This will stimulate a significantly increased number of stem cells in the plasma. The yield of stem cell rich plasma expected from the pheresis is about 2 liters. The plasma will be divided into aliquots of about thirty-six 50 ml doses and 5 ml testing aliquots. Samples will be frozen until such time the same Plasma Recipient is being treated. [0092] There will be eight primary biomarker measurements evaluated at baseline, and after treatment for 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, and 12 months. These same evaluations will continue every three months for an additional year to examine the long-term effect of the treatment. These assessments are: 1) Immunosenescence Panel 2) CCL11 3) TGFBeta 1 growth factor 4) Nuclear Factor kappa beta (NFkB) 5) DHEA-S 6) Plasma Insulin 7) Telomere length 8) Cytokine Multiplex 18 [0093] There will also be clinical markers (group of 13) evaluated at the quarterly visits during physical exam that will provide secondary efficacy data for evaluation. Example 3 [0094] This protocol will assess the efficacy of stem cell activation with stem cell mobilization with granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) and autologous stem cell rich plasma in combination with infusing stem-cell rich plasma from ABO-matched cord blood healthy allogeneic donors to improve the levels of anti-aging bio-markers in the recipients. [0095] Patients will be treated with G-CSF stem cell mobilization and Autologous Stem Cell Rich Plasma in combination with Infusing Stem-Cell Rich Plasma from ABO-matched Healthy Cord Blood Allogeneic donors to improve the levels of anti-aging biomarkers in the recipients. [0096] Adults who are interested in assessing their level of anti-aging biomarkers, and who are willing to receive doses of G-CSF stem cell mobilization as well as Autologous Stem Cell Rich Plasma and Infusions of Stem-Cell Rich Plasma from ABO-matched Healthy Cord Blood Allogeneic Donors will be treated monthly for a one-year period to determine if there is any improvement in those markers. [0097] They will receive daily G-CSF at a dose of 5 to 15ug/kg intravenously or subcutaneously for 5-7 days monthly for 12 months. On the first of the 5-7 day period they will also receive Autologous Stem Cell Rich plasma in aliquots of 50 ml monthly for 12 months. After the end of the daily G-CSF for the 5-7 day period they will also receive Allogeneic Cord Blood Stem Cell Rich plasma in aliquots of 50 ml monthly for 12 months. Assessments measuring the biomarkers will be done at baseline before starting treatments and will be repeated every 3 months during the treatment period, and every three months for 12 additional months after the completion of the treatment period. Additionally, clinical markers will be collected at those same time points. [0098] Autologous Donors will be dosed with G-CSF at a dose of 5 to 15ug/kg intravenously or subcutaneously for three days prior to undergoing plasmapheresis. This will stimulate a significantly increased number of stem cells in the plasma. [0099] The yield of stem cell rich plasma expected from the pheresis is about 2 liters. The plasma will be divided into aliquots of about thirty-six 50 ml doses and 5 ml testing aliquots. Samples will be frozen until such time as the same Plasma Recipient is being treated. Allogeneic Cord Blood Plasma Donors: [00100] All donations of cord blood plasma will be taken from the plasma extracted and normally discarded from healthy babies cord blood collected from the delivered placenta at the time of birth and whose stem cells are to be cryopreserved for the baby’s personal use at a later date. [00101] The yield of plasma expected from the cord blood is about 55 mis. The plasma will be divided into aliquots of 50 ml doses and 5 ml testing aliquots (for cross matching). Samples will be frozen until such time as a Plasma Recipient of the same ABO/Rh type is being treated. [00102] Based on the average prevalence of ABO types, it is anticipated that the number of donors needed will be approximately 12 to 15 per recipient.
