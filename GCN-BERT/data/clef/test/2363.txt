Step 2: Preparation of 2-[(1-benzylpiperidin-4-yl)oxy]ethan-1-ol
In a 250 mL round bottom flask, hydrogen chloride (2 N in water, 10 mL) was added to a solution of 1-benzyl-4-[2-(oxan-2-yloxy)ethoxy] piperidine (8.0 g, 25.04 mmol, 1.00 equiv) in methanol (100 mL) at room temperature. The resulting solution was stirred for 2 hours at 50Â° C. The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and was concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was extracted with methylene chloride and sodium hydroxide solution. The organic layer was dried and solvent was removed. This resulted in 5.5 g (93%) of 2-[(1-benzylpiperidin-4-yl)oxy]ethan-1-ol as yellow oil. LC-MS (ES+): m/z 236.00 [MH+]; tR=0.42 min (1.90 minute run).
