BACKGROUND [0002] Cells normally maintain a balance between protein synthesis, folding, trafficking, aggregation, and degradation, referred to as protein homeostasis, utilizing sensors and networks of pathways (Sitia et al., Nature 426: 891-894, 2003; Ron et al, Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol 8: 519-529, 2007). The cellular maintenance of protein homeostasis, or proteostasis, refers to controlling the conformation, binding interactions, location and concentration of individual proteins making up the proteome. Protein folding in vivo is accomplished through interactions between the folding polypeptide chain and macromolecular cellular components, including multiple classes of chaperones and folding enzymes, which minimize aggregation (Wiseman et al, Cell 131: 809-821, 2007). Whether a given protein folds in a certain cell type depends on the distribution, concentration, and subcellular localization of chaperones, folding enzymes, metabolites and the like (Wiseman et al). Cystic fibrosis and other maladies of protein misfolding arise as a result of an imbalance in the capacity of the protein homeostasis (proteostasis) environment to handle the reduced energetic stability of misfolded, mutated proteins that are critical for normal physiology (Balch et al, Science 319, 916-9 (2008); Powers, et al, Annu Rev Biochem 78, 959-91 (2009); Hutt et al, FEBS Lett 583, 2639-46 (2009)). [0003] Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene which encodes a multi-membrane spanning epithelial chloride channel (Riordan et al, Annu Rev Biochem 77, 701-26 (2008)). Approximately ninety percent of patients have a deletion of phenylalanine (Phe) 508 (AF508) on at least one allele. This mutation results in disruption of the energetics of the protein fold leading to degradation of CFTR in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The AF508 mutation is thus associated with defective folding and trafficking, as well as enhanced degradation of the mutant CFTR protein (Qu et al, J Biol Chem 272, 15739-44 (1997)). The loss of a functional CFTR channel at the plasma membrane disrupts ionic homeostasis (Cl~, Na+, HCO3") and airway surface hydration leading to reduced lung function (Riordan et al.). Reduced periciliary liquid volume and increased mucus viscosity impede mucociliary clearance resulting in chronic infection and inflammation, phenotypic hallmarks of CF disease (Boucher, J Intern Med 261, 5-16 (2007)). In addition to respiratory dysfunction, AF508 CFTR also impacts the normal function of additional organs (pancreas, intestine, gall bladder), suggesting that the loss-of- function impacts multiple downstream pathways that will require correction. [0004] In addition to cystic fibrosis, mutations in the CFTR gene and/or the activity of the CFTR channel has also been implicated in other conditions, including for example, congenital bilateral absence of vas deferens (CBAVD), acute, recurrent, or chronic pancreatitis, disseminated bronchiectasis, asthma, allergic pulmonary aspergillosis, smoking-related lung diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), dry eye disease, Sjogren's syndrome and chronic sinusitis, (Sloane et al. (2012), PLoS ONE 7(6): e39809.doi: 10.1371/journal. pone.0039809; Bombieri et al. (2011), J Cyst Fibros. 2011 Jun; 10 Suppl 2:S86-102; (Albert et al. (2008). Clinical Respiratory Medicine, Third Ed., Mosby Inc.; Levin et al. (2005), Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci., 46(4): 1428-34; Froussard (2007), Pancreas 35(1): 94-5). [0005] There remains a need in the art for compounds, compositions and methods of increasing CFTR activity as well as for methods of treating CF, other CFTR-related diseases, and other maladies of protein misfolding.

The symbol = denotes a bond that may be a single, double or triple bond as described herein. Substituents around a carbon-carbon double bond are designated as being in the "Z" or configuration wherein the terms "Z" and are used in accordance with IUPAC standards. Unless otherwise specified, structures depicting double bonds encompass both the "E" and "Z" isomers. Substituents around a carbon- carbon double bond alternatively can be referred to as "cis" or "trans," where "cis" represents substituents on the same side of the double bond and "trans" represents substituents on opposite sides of the double bond. [0048] Compounds of the disclosure may contain a carbocyclic or heterocyclic ring and therefore, exist as geometric isomers resulting from the arrangement of substituents around the ring. The arrangement of substituents around a carbocyclic or heterocyclic ring are designated as being in the "Z" or "E" configuration wherein the terms "Z" and "E" are used in accordance with IUPAC standards. Unless otherwise specified, structures depicting carbocyclic or heterocyclic rings encompass both "Z" and "E" isomers. Substituents around a carbocyclic or heterocyclic ring may also be referred to as "cis" or "trans", where the term "cis" represents substituents on the same side of the plane of the ring and the term "trans" represents substituents on opposite sides of the plane of the ring. Mixtures of compounds wherein the substituents are disposed on both the same and opposite sides of plane of the ring are designated "cis/trans." [0049] Individual enantiomers and diasteriomers of disclosed compounds can be prepared for example by synthetically from commercially available starting materials that contain asymmetric or stereogenic centers, or by preparation of racemic mixtures followed by resolution methods well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. These methods of resolution are exemplified by (1) attachment of a mixture of enantiomers to a chiral auxiliary, separation of the resulting mixture of diastereomers by recrystallization or chromatography and liberation of the optically pure product from the auxiliary, (2) salt formation employing an optically active resolving agent, (3) direct separation of the mixture of optical enantiomers on chiral liquid chromatographic columns or (4) kinetic resolution using stereoselective chemical or enzymatic reagents. Racemic mixtures can also be resolved into their component enantiomers by well known methods, such as chiral-phase liquid chromatography or crystallizing a disclosed compound in a chiral solvent. Stereoselective syntheses, a chemical or enzymatic reaction in which a single reactant forms an unequal mixture of stereoisomers during the creation of a new stereocenter or during the trans formation of a pre-existing one, are well known in the art. Stereoselective syntheses encompass both enantio- and diastereos elective transformations, and may involve the use of chiral auxiliaries. For examples, see Carreira and Kvaerno, Classics in Stereoselective Synthesis, Wiley-VCH: Weinheim, 2009. Where a particular compound is described or depicted, it is intended to encompass that chemical structure as well as tautomers of that structure. [0050] The term "enantiomerically pure" means a stereomerically pure composition of a compound. For example, a stereochemically pure composition is a composition that is free or substantially free of other stereoisomers of that compound. In another example, for a compound having one chiral center, an enantiomerically pure composition of the compound is free or substantially free of the other enantiomer. In yet another example, for a compound having two chiral centers, an enantiomerically pure composition is free or substantially free of the other diastereomers. [0051] Where a particular stereochemistry is described or depicted it is intended to mean that a particular enantiomer is present in excess relative to the other enantiomer. A compound has an R-configuration at a specific position when it is present in excess compared to the compound having an S-configuration at that position. A compound has an S-configuration at a specific position when it is present in excess compared to the compound having an R-configuration at that position. [0052] Compounds disclosed herein can exist in solvated as well as unsolvated forms with pharmaceutically acceptable solvents such as water, ethanol, and the like, and it is intended that compounds described herein can for example embrace both solvated and unsolvated forms. In one embodiment, a disclosed compound is amorphous. In one embodiment, a disclosed compound is a single polymorph. In another embodiment, a disclosed compound is a mixture of polymorphs. In another embodiment, a disclosed compound is in a crystalline form. [0053] Contemplated herein in certain embodiments are isotopically labeled compounds which are identical to those recited herein, except that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into disclosed compounds include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosph sulfur, fluorine and chlorine, such as 2H, 3H, 13C, 14C, 15N, 180, 170, 31P, 32P, 35S, 18F, and CI, respectively. For example, a disclosed compound may for example have one or more H atom replaced with deuterium. [0054] Certain isotopically-labeled disclosed compounds (e.g., those labeled with 3H and 14C) are useful in compound and/or substrate tissue distribution assays. Tritiated (i.e., 3H) and carbon- 14 (i.e., 14C) isotopes are particularly preferred for their ease of preparation and detectability. Further, substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium (i.e., 2H) may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability (e.g., increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements) and hence may be preferred in some circumstances. Isotopically labeled compounds, for example, can generally be prepared by following procedures analogous to those disclosed in the examples herein by substituting an isotopically labeled reagent for a non-isotopically labeled reagent. Also contemplated herein are compounds wherein one or more of the nitrogen atoms in a disclosed compound is oxidized to N-oxide. [0055] An exemplary synthetic route for the preparation of compound of Formula (I) is shown in the exemplary schemes below. As will be understood by the skilled artisan, diastereomers can be separated from the reaction mixture for example, using column chromatography. [0056] Scheme 1 [0057] Scheme 2 [0058] Disclosed compounds can also be prepared for example, using methods described in the literature, including, but not limited to, J. Med. Chem. 2011, 54(13), 4350-64;; Russian Journal of Organic Chemistry, 201 1, 47(8), 1199-1203; U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2009/0036451 Al ; WO2008/046072 A2, and U.S. Patent No. 4,336,264, the contents of each of which are expressly incorporated by reference herein. [0059] As discussed above, also disclosed herein is a method of increasing CFTR activity in a subject comprising administering a disclosed compound in an effective amount. In an embodiment, a method of treating a patient suffering from a condition associated with CFTR activity comprising administering to said patient an effective amount of a compound described herein [0060] "Treating" or "treatment" includes preventing or delaying the onset of the symptoms, complications, or biochemical indicia of a disease, alleviating or ameliorating the symptoms or arresting or inhibiting further development of the disease, condition, or disorder. A "subject" is an animal to be treated or in need of treatment. A "patient" is a human subject in need of treatment. [0061] An "effective amount" refers to that amount of an agent that is sufficient to achieve a desired and/or recited effect. In the context of a method of treatment, an "effective amount" of the therapeutic agent that is sufficient to ameliorate of one or more symptoms of a disorder and/or prevent advancement of a disorder, cause regression of the disorder and/or to achieve a desired effect. [0062] The term "modulating" encompasses increasing, enhancing, inhibiting, decreasing, suppressing, and the like. The terms "increasing" and "enhancing" mean to cause a net gain by either direct or indirect means. As used herein, the terms "inhibiting" and "decreasing" encompass causing a net decrease by either direct or indirect means. [0063] In some examples, CFTR activity is enhanced after administration of a compound described herein when there is an increase in the CFTR activity as compared to that in the absence of the administration of the compound. CFTR activity encompasses, for example, chloride channel activity of the CFTR, and/or other ion transport activity (for example, HCO3" transport). In certain of these embodiments, the activity of one or more (e.g., one or two) mutant CFTRs (e.g., AF508, S549N, G542X, G551D, R117H, N1303K, W1282X, R553X, 621+1G>T, 1717-lOA, 3849+lOkbOT, 2789+5G>A, 3120+1OA, I507del, R1 162X, 1898+lOA, 3659delC, G85E, D1 152H, R560T, R347P, 2184insA, A455E, R334W, Q493X, and 2184delA CFTR) is enhanced (e.g., increased). Contemplated patients may have a CFTR mutation(s) from one or more classes, such as without limitation, Class I CFTR mutations, Class II CFTR mutations, Class III CFTR mutations, Class IV CFTR mutations, Class V CFTR mutations, and Class VI mutations. Contemplated subject (e.g., human subject) CFTR genotypes include, without limitation, homozygote mutations (e.g., AF508 / AF508 and Rl 17H / Rl 17H) and compound heterozygote mutations (e.g., AF508 / G55 ID; AF508 / A455E; AF508 / G542X; A508F / W1204X; R553X / W1316X; W1282X/N1303K, 591Δ18 / E831X, F508del/Rl 17H/ N1303K/ 3849+lOkbOT; Δ303Κ/ 384; and DF508/G178R). [0064] In certain embodiments, the mutation is a Class I mutation, e.g., a G542X Class I mutation; e.g., a Class II/ 1 mutation, e.g., a AF508 / G542X compound heterozygous mutation. In other embodiments, the mutation is a Class III mutation, e.g., a G551D Class III mutation; e.g., a Class IV Class III mutation, e.g., a AF508 / G551D compound heterozygous mutation. In still other embodiments, the mutation is a Class V mutation, e.g., a A455E Class V mutation; e.g., a Class II/ Class V mutation, e.g., a AF508 / A455E compound heterozygous mutation. Of the more than 1000 known mutations of the CFTR gene, AF508 is the most prevalent mutation of CFTR which results in misfolding of the protein and impaired trafficking from the endoplasmic reticulum to the apical membrane (Dormer et al. (2001). J Cell Sci 1 14, 4073-4081 ; http://www.genet.sickkids.on.ca/app). In certain embodiments, AF508 CFTR activity is enhanced (e.g., increased). In certain embodiments, AF508 CFTR activity and/or G542X CFTR activity and/or G55 ID CFTR activity and/or A455E CFTR activity is enhanced (e.g., increased). An enhancement of CFTR activity can be measured, for example, using literature described methods, including for example, Ussing chamber assays, patch clamp assays, and hBE Ieq assay (Devor et al. (2000), Am J Physiol Cell Physiol 279(2): C461-79; Dousmanis et al. (2002), J Gen Physiol 119(6): 545-59; Bruscia et al. (2005), PNAS 103(8): 2965-2971). [0065] Provided herein is a method of treating cystic fibrosis in a subject or patient in need thereof comprising administering a disclosed compound. Methods of treating other conditions associated with CFTR activity, including conditions associated with deficient CFTR activity is also contemplated. [0066] In some embodiments, a method of treating a condition associated with deficient or decreased CFTR activity comprising administering an effective amount of a compound of Formula (I) that enhances CFTR activity is provided. Non-limiting examples of conditions associated with deficient CFTR activity are cystic fibrosis, congenital bilateral absence of vas deferens (CBAVD), acute, recurrent, or chronic pancreatitis, disseminated bronchiectasis, asthma, allergic pulmonary aspergillosis, smoking-related lung diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic sinusitis, dry eye disease, protein C deficiency, Αβ-lipoproteinemia, lysosomal storage disease, type 1 chylomicronemia, mild pulmonary disease, lipid processing deficiencies, type 1 hereditary angioedema, coagulation-fibrinolyis, hereditary hemochromatosis, CFTR-related metabolic syndrome, chronic bronchitis, constipation, pancreatic insufficiency, hereditary emphysema, and Sjogren's syndrome. [0067] In some embodiments, disclosed methods of treatment further comprise administering an additional therapeutic agent. For example, in an embodiment, provided herein is a method of administering a disclosed compound and at least one additional therapeutic agent. In certain aspects, the invention is directed to a method comprising administering a disclosed compound, and at least two additional therapeutic agents. Additional therapeutic agents include, for example, mucolytic agents, bronchodilators, antibiotics, anti-infective agents, anti-inflammatory agents, ion channel modulating agents, therapeutic agents used in gene therapy, CFTR correctors, and CFTR potentiators, or other agents that modulates CFTR activity. In some embodiments, at least one additional therapeutic agent is selected from the group consisting of a CFTR corrector and a CFTR potentiator. Non-limiting examples of CFTR correctors and potentiators include VX-770 (Ivacaftor), VX-809 (3-(6-(l-(2,2-difluorobenzo[d][l,3]dioxol-5- yl)cyclopropanecarboxamido)-3-methylpyridin-2-yl)benzoic acid, VX-661 (l-(2,2-difluoro- l,3-benzodioxol-5-yl)-N-[l-[(2R)-2,3-dihydroxypropyl]-6-fluoro-2-(2-hydroxy-l,l- dimethylethyl)-lH-indol-5-yl]- cyclopropanecarboxamide), VX-983, and Ataluren (PTC124) (3-[5-(2-fluorophenyl)-l,2,4-oxadiazol-3-yl]benzoic acid), FDL169, GLPG1837/ABBV-974 (for example, a CFTR potentiator), GLPG2222 (for example, a CFTR corrector); and compounds described in, e.g., WO2014/144860 and 2014/176553, hereby incorporated by reference. Non-limiting examples of modulators include QBW-251, QR-010, NB-124, and compounds described in, e.g., WO2014/045283; WO2014/081821, WO2014/081820, WO2014/152213; WO2014/ 160440, WO2014/160478, US2014027933; WO2014/0228376, WO2013/038390, WO201 1/1 13894, WO2013/038386; and WO2014/180562, of which the disclosed modulators in those publications are contemplated as an additional therapeutic agents and incorporated by reference. Non-limiting examples of anti-inflammatory agents include N6022 (3-(5-(4-(lH-imidazol-l-yl) phenyl)-l-(4- carbamoyl-2-methylphenyl)-1H-pyrrol-2-yl) propanoic acid), CTX-4430, N1861, N1785, and N911 15. [0068] In some embodiments, the methods described herein can further include administering an additional therapeutic agent or administering at least two additional CFTR therapeutic agents. In some embodiments, the methods described herein can further include administering an additional CFTR modulator or administering at least two additional CFTR modulators. In certain embodiments, at least one CFTR modulator is a CFTR corrector (e.g., VX-809, VX-661, VX-983 and GLPG2222) or potentiator (e.g., ivacaftor, genistein and GLPG1837). In certain of these embodiments, one of the at least two additional therapeutic agents is a CFTR corrector (e.g., VX-809, VX-661 and VX-983) and the other is a CFTR potentiator (e.g., ivacaftor and genistein). In certain of these embodiments, one of the at least two additional therapeutic agents is a CFTR corrector (e.g., GLPG2222) and the other is a CFTR potentiator (e.g., GLPG1837). In certain of these embodiments, one of the at least two additional therapeutic agents is a CFTR corrector (e.g., VX-809 or VX-661) and the other is a CFTR potentiator (e.g., ivacaftor). In certain of these embodiments, at least one CFTR modulator is an agent that enhances read-through of stop codons (e.g., NB 124 or ataluren). [0069] Accordingly, in another aspect, this disclosure provides a method of treating a condition associated with deficient or decreased CFTR activity (e.g., cystic fibrosis), which includes administering to a subject in need thereof (e.g., a human patient in need thereof) an effective amount of a disclosed compound and at least one or two additional CFTR therapeutic agent(s) (e.g., at least one or two additional CFTR therapeutic agents, e.g., in which one of the at least one or two additional therapeutic agents is optionally a CFTR corrector or modulator (e.g., VX-809, VX-661 , VX-983, GLPG2222, NB 124, ataluren) and/or the other is a CFTR potentiator (e.g., ivacaftor, genistein, and GLPG1837); e.g., one of the at least two additional therapeutic agents is GLPG2222, and the other is GLPG1837; or one of the at least two additional therapeutic agents is VX-809 or VX-661, and the other is a ivacaftor). In certain embodiments, the subject's CFTR genotype includes, without limitation, one or more Class I CFTR mutations, one or more Class II CFTR mutations, one or more Class III CFTR mutations, one or more Class IV CFTR mutations, or one or more Class V CFTR mutations, or one or more Class VI CFTR mutations. In certain embodiments, the subject's CFTR genotype includes, without limitation, one or more homozygote mutations (e.g., AF508 / AF508 or Rl 17H / Rl 17H) and/or one or more compound heterozygote mutations (e.g., AF508 / G551D; AF508 / A455E; AF508 / G542X; A508F / W1204X; R553X / W1316X; W1282X/N 1303K; F508del/R117H; N 1303K/ 3849+lOkbOT; AF508/R334W; DF508/G178R., and 591Δ18 / E831X). In certain embodiments, the subject's CFTR genotype includes a Class I mutation, e.g., a G542X Class I mutation, e.g., a AF508 / G542X compound heterozygous mutation.

In still other embodiments, the subject's CFTR genotype includes a Class V mutation, e.g., a A455E Class V mutation, e.g., a AF508 / A455E compound heterozygous mutation. In certain embodiments, AF508 CFTR activity and/or G542X CFTR activity and/or G551D CFTR activity and/or A455E activity is enhanced (e.g., increased). In certain embodiments, the enhancement in activity (e.g., increase in activity) provided by the combination of the disclosed compound and one or two additional therapeutic agents is greater than additive when compared to the enhancement in activity provided by each therapeutic component individually. Genotype Description Possible Symptoms A508F / A508F homozygote Severe lung disease, pancreatic insufficient R1 17H / R1 17H homozygote Congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens, No lung or pancreas disease WT / A508F heterozygote Unaffected WT / 3120+1 G>A heterozygote Unaffected A508F / W1204X compound pancreatic insufficient heterozygote R553X and W1316X compound Mild lung disease, heterozygote pancreatic insufficient 591 Δ18 / Ε831 Χ compound No lung or pancreas heterozygote disease, nasal polyps [0070] For example, provided herein is a method of treating a patient having one or more of the following mutations in the CFTR gene: G1244E, G1349D, G178R, G551S, S1251N, S1255P, S549N, S549R , G970R, or R117H, and/or e.g., a patient with one or two copies of the F508del mutation, or one copy of the AF508 mutation and a second mutation that results in a gating effect in the CFTR protein (e.g., a patient that is heterozygous for AF508 and G55 ID mutation), a patient with one copy of the AF508 mutation and a second mutation that results in residual CFTR activity , or a patient with one copy of the AF508 mutation and a second mutation that results in residual CFTR activity, comprising administering an effective amount of a disclosed compound. As described herein, such exemplary methods (e.g., of a patient having one or mutations such as those described above) may include, for example, administering to such patient a combination therapy, e.g., administering (simultaneously or sequentially) an effective amount of ivacaftor to said patient and an effective amount of disclosed compound that may act as an amplifier. Such administration may result, for example, in increased chloride transport in human bronchial epithelial cells with e.g., one or two copies of mutations, e.g., AF508 mutation, as compared to administration of ivacaftor alone. Another combination therapy that includes a disclosed compound may also include an effective amount of a read through agent (e.g., ataluren, NB124) and an effective amount of disclosed compound that may act as an amplifier. [0071] The phrase "combination therapy," as used herein, refers to an embodiment where a patient is co-administered a disclosed compound, a CFTR potentiator agent (e.g., ivacaftor ) and optionally, one or more CFTR corrector agent(s) (e.g, VX-661 and/or lumacaftor) as part of a specific treatment regimen intended to provide the beneficial effect from the co- action of these therapeutic agents. For example, a beneficial effect of a combination may include, but is not limited to, pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic co-action resulting from the combination of therapeutic agents. For example, administration of a disclosed compound with ivacaftor alone or with a CFTR corrector agent (e.g., lumacaftor or VX-661) may result in a level of function (e.g., as measured by chloride activity in HBE cells or patients that have a AF508 mutation, that achieves clinical improvement (or better) as compared to the chloride activity level in cells or patients with a G551D mutation receiving ivacaftor alone, or ivacaftor and a corrector agent (lumacaftor or VX-661 ; or for example, administration of a disclosed compound with ivacaftor alone or ivacaftor with a CFTR corrector agent (e.g., lumacaftor or VX-661) may result in a level of function (e.g., as measured by chloride activity in HBE cells or patients that have a A455E mutation, that achieves clinical improvement (or better) as compared to the chloride activity level at e.g., 50% or more of wild type cells; or upon administration of a disclosed compound and ivacaftor to a patient (e.g. having a G55 ID class III mutation) may show e.g., about two times or more improved activity of ivacaftor as compared to administration of ivacaftor alone. Administration of disclosed therapeutic agents in combination typically is carried out over a defined time period (usually a day, days, weeks, months or years depending upon the combination selected). Combination therapy is intended to embrace administration of multiple therapeutic agents in a sequential manner, that is, wherein each therapeutic agent is administered at a different time, as well as administration of these therapeutic agents, or at least two of the therapeutic agents, in a substantially simultaneous manner. Substantially simultaneous administration can be accomplished, for example, by administering to the subject a single tablet or capsule having a fixed ratio of each therapeutic agent or in multiple, single capsules for each of the therapeutic agents. Sequential or substantially simultaneous administration of each therapeutic agent can be effected by any appropriate route including, but not limited to, oral routes, inhalational routes, intravenous routes, intramuscular routes, and direct absorption through mucous membrane tissues. The therapeutic agents can be administered by the same route or by different routes. For example, a first therapeutic agent of the combination selected may be administered by intravenous injection or inhalation or nebulizer while the other therapeutic agents of the combination may be administered orally. Alternatively, for example, all therapeutic agents may be administered orally or all therapeutic agents may be administered by intravenous injection, inhalation or nebulization. [0072] Combination therapy also can embrace the administration of the therapeutic agents as described above in further combination with other biologically active ingredients and non-drug therapies. Where the combination therapy further comprises a non-drug treatment, the non-drug treatment may be conducted at any suitable time so long as a beneficial effect from the co-action of the combination of the therapeutic agents and non-drug treatment is achieved. For example, in appropriate cases, the beneficial effect is still achieved when the non-drug treatment is temporally removed from the administration of the therapeutic agents, perhaps by a day, days or even weeks. [0073] The components of a disclosed combination may be administered to a patient simultaneously or sequentially. It will be appreciated that the components may be present in the same pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and, therefore, are administered simultaneously. Alternatively, the active ingredients may be present in separate pharmaceutical carriers, such as, conventional oral dosage forms, that can be administered either simultaneously or sequentially. [0074] In a further aspect, a method of identifying a candidate agent that increases CFTR activity is provided, which includes: (i) contacting a cell that expresses a CFTR protein with the candidate agent and a disclosed compound; (ii) measuring the CFTR activity in the cell in the presence of the candidate agent and the disclosed compound; and (iii) comparing the CFTR activity to that in the absence of the test agent, wherein an increase in CFTR activity in the presence of the test agent indicates that the agent increases CFTR activity. In certain embodiments, the cell expresses a mutant CFTR protein. In certain embodiments, CFTR activity is measured by measuring chloride channel activity of the CFTR, and/or other ion transport activity. In certain of these embodiments, the method is high-throughput. In certain of these embodiments, the candidate agent is a CFTR corrector or a CFTR potentiator. [0075] The term "pharmaceutically acceptable salt(s)" as used herein refers to salts of acidic or basic groups that may be present in a disclosed compounds used in disclosed compositions. Compounds included in the present compositions that are basic in nature are capable of forming a wide variety of salts with various inorganic and organic acids. The acids that may be used to prepare pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of such basic compounds are those that form non-toxic acid addition salts, i.e., salts containing pharmacologically acceptable anions, including, but not limited to, malate, oxalate, chloride, bromide, iodide, nitrate, sulfate, bisulfate, phosphate, acid phosphate, isonicotinate, acetate, lactate, salicylate, citrate, tartrate, oleate, tannate, pantothenate, bitartrate, ascorbate, succinate, maleate, gentisinate, fumarate, gluconate, glucaronate, saccharate, formate, benzoate, glutamate, methanesulfonate, ethanesulfonate, benzenesulfonate, p- toluenesulfonate and pamoate (i.e., l,l'-methylene-/?«-(2-hydroxy-3-naphthoate)) salts. Compounds included in the present compositions that are acidic in nature are capable of forming base salts with various pharmacologically acceptable cations. Examples of such salts include alkali metal or alkaline earth metal salts, particularly calcium, magnesium, sodium, lithium, zinc, potassium, and iron salts. Compounds included in the present compositions that include a basic or acidic moiety may also form pharmaceutically acceptable salts with various amino acids. The compounds of the disclosure may contain both acidic and basic groups; for example, one amino and one carboxylic acid group. In such a case, the compound can exist as an acid addition salt, a zwitterion, or a base salt. [0076] Also included in the present invention are methods that include administering a prodrug of compound described herein, for example, prodrugs of a compound of Formula (I) or a pharmaceutical composition thereof or method of use of the prodrug. [0077] The term "prodrug" refers to compounds that are transformed in vivo to yield a disclosed compound or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, hydrate or solvate of the compound. The transformation may occur by various mechanisms (such as by esterase, amidase, phosphatase, oxidative and or reductive metabolism) in various locations (such as in the intestinal lumen or upon transit of the intestine, blood or liver). Prodrugs are well known in the art (for example, see Rautio, Kumpulainen, et al, Nature Reviews Drug Discovery 2008, 7, 255). For example, if a compound of the invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, hydrate or solvate of the compound contains a carboxylic acid functional group, a prodrug can comprise an ester formed by the replacement of the hydrogen atom of the acid group with a group such as (Ci_8)alkyl, (C2- 12)alkylcarbonyloxymethyl, 1 -(alkylcarbonyloxy)ethyl having from 4 to 9 carbon atoms, 1- methyl- 1 -(alky lcarbonyloxy)-ethyl having from 5 to 10 carbon atoms, alkoxycarbonyloxymethyl having from 3 to 6 carbon atoms, l-(alkoxycarbonyloxy)ethyl having from 4 to 7 carbon atoms, 1 -methyl- l-(alkoxycarbonyloxy)ethyl having from 5 to 8 carbon atoms, N-(alkoxycarbonyl)aminomethyl having from 3 to 9 carbon atoms, l-(N-(alkoxycarbonyl)amino)ethyl having from 4 to 10 carbon atoms, 3-phthalidyl, 4-crotonolactonyl, gamma-butyrolacton-4-yl, di-N,N-(Ci_2)alkylamino(C2-3)alkyl (such as β- dimethylaminoethyl), carbamoyl-(Ci_2)alkyl, N,N-di(Ci_2)alkylcarbamoyl-(Ci_2)alkyl and piperidino-, pyrrolidino- or morpholino(C2-3)alkyl. [0078] Similarly, if a compound of the invention contains an alcohol functional group, a prodrug can be formed by the replacement of the hydrogen atom of the alcohol group with a group such as (Ci_6)alkylcarbonyloxymethyl, l-((Ci_6)alkylcarbonyloxy)ethyl, 1 -methyl- 1 -((Ci_6)alkylcarbonyloxy)ethyl (Ci_6)alkoxycarbonyloxymethyl, N-(Ci_ 6)alkoxycarbonylaminomethyl, succinoyl, (Ci_6)alkylcarbonyl, a-amino(Ci_4)alkylcarbonyl, arylalkylcarbonyl and a-aminoalkylcarbonyl, or a-aminoalkylcarbonyl-a- aminoalkylcarbonyl, where each a-aminoalkylcarbonyl group is independently selected from the naturally occurring L-amino acids, P(0)(OH)2, -P(0)(0(Ci_6)alkyl)2 or glycosyl (the radical resulting from the removal of a hydroxyl group of the hemiacetal form of a carbohydrate). [0079] If a compound of the invention incorporates an amine functional group, a prodrug can be formed, for example, by creation of an amide or carbamate, an N- alkylcarbonyloxyalkyl derivative, an (oxodioxolenyl)methyl derivative, an N-Mannich base, imine or enamine. In addition, a secondary amine can be metabolically cleaved to generate a bioactive primary amine, or a tertiary amine can metabolically cleaved to generate a bioactive primary or secondary amine. For examples, see Simplicio, et ah, Molecules 2008, 13, 519 and references therein [0080] The invention additionally includes use of clathrates of compounds described herein, pharmaceutical compositions comprising the clathrates, and methods of use of the clathrates. In some embodiments, the invention is directed to clathrates of a compound of Formula (I) or a pharmaceutical composition thereof. [0081] As discussed above, the disclosure contemplates administration of pharmaceutical compositions comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient and a compound described herein. A disclosed compound, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, clathrate or prodrug thereof, can be administered in pharmaceutical compositions comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient. The excipient can be chosen based on the expected route of administration of the composition in therapeutic applications. The route of administration of the composition depends on the condition to be treated. For example, intravenous injection may be preferred for treatment of a systemic disorder and oral administration may be preferred to treat a gastrointestinal disorder. The route of administration and the dosage of the composition to be administered can be determined by the skilled artisan without undue experimentation in conjunction with standard dose- response studies. Relevant circumstances to be considered in making those determinations include the condition or conditions to be treated, the choice of composition to be administered, the age, weight, and response of the individual patient, and the severity of the patient's symptoms. A pharmaceutical composition comprising a disclosed compound or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, clathrate or prodrug, can be administered by a variety of routes including, but not limited to, parenteral, oral, pulmonary, ophthalmic, nasal, rectal, vaginal, aural, topical, buccal, transdermal, intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous, intradermal, intraocular, intracerebral, intralymphatic, intraarticular, intrathecal and intraperitoneal. The compositions can also include, depending on the formulation desired, pharmaceutically-acceptable, non-toxic carriers or diluents, which are defined as vehicles commonly used to formulate pharmaceutical compositions for animal or human administration. The diluent is selected so as not to affect the biological activity of the pharmacologic agent or composition. Examples of such diluents are distilled water, physiological phosphate-buffered saline, Ringer's solutions, dextrose solution, and Hank's solution. In addition, the pharmaceutical composition or formulation may also include other carriers, adjuvants, or nontoxic, nontherapeutic, nonimmunogenic stabilizers and the like. Pharmaceutical compositions can also include large, slowly metabolized macromolecules such as proteins, polysaccharides such as chitosan, polylactic acids, polyglycolic acids and copolymers (such as latex functionalized SEPHAROSE™, agarose, cellulose, and the like), polymeric amino acids, amino acid copolymers, and lipid aggregates (such as oil droplets or liposomes). [0082] The compositions can be administered parenterally such as, for example, by intravenous, intramuscular, intrathecal or subcutaneous injection. Parenteral administration can be accomplished by incorporating a composition into a solution or suspension. Such solutions or suspensions may also include sterile diluents such as water for injection, saline solution, fixed oils, polyethylene glycols, glycerine, propylene glycol or other synthetic solvents. Parenteral formulations may also include antibacterial agents such as, for example, benzyl alcohol or methyl parabens, antioxidants such as, for example, ascorbic acid or sodium bisulfite and chelating agents such as EDTA. Buffers such as acetates, citrates or phosphates and agents for the adjustment of tonicity such as sodium chloride or dextrose may also be added. The parenteral preparation can be enclosed in ampules, disposable syringes or multiple dose vials made of glass or plastic. [0083] Additionally, auxiliary substances, such as wetting or emulsifying agents, surfactants, pH buffering substances and the like can be present in compositions. Other components of pharmaceutical compositions are those of petroleum, animal, vegetable, or synthetic origin, for example, peanut oil, soybean oil, and mineral oil. In general, glycols such as propylene glycol or polyethylene glycol are preferred liquid carriers, particularly for injectable solutions. [0084] Injectable formulations can be prepared either as liquid solutions or suspensions; solid forms suitable for solution in, or suspension in, liquid vehicles prior to injection can also be prepared. The preparation also can also be emulsified or encapsulated in liposomes or micro particles such as polylactide, polyglycolide, or copolymer for enhanced adjuvant effect, as discussed above [Langer, Science 249: 1527, 1990 and Hanes, Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews 28: 97-119, 1997]. The compositions and pharmacologic agents described herein can be administered in the form of a depot injection or implant preparation which can be formulated in such a manner as to permit a sustained or pulsatile release of the active ingredient. [0085] Additional formulations suitable for other modes of administration include oral, intranasal, and pulmonary formulations, suppositories, transdermal applications and ocular delivery. For suppositories, binders and carriers include, for example, polyalkylene glycols or triglycerides; such suppositories can be formed from mixtures containing the active ingredient in the range of about 0.5% to about 10%, preferably about 1% to about 2%. Oral formulations include excipients, such as pharmaceutical grades of mannitol, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, sodium saccharine, cellulose, and magnesium carbonate. Topical application can result in transdermal or intradermal delivery. Transdermal delivery can be achieved using a skin patch or using transferosomes. [Paul et al, Eur. J. Immunol. 25: 3521-24, 1995; Cevc et al, Biochem. Biophys. Acta 1368: 201-15, 1998]. [0086] For the purpose of oral therapeutic administration, the pharmaceutical compositions can be incorporated with excipients and used in the form of tablets, troches, capsules, elixirs, suspensions, syrups, wafers, chewing gums and the like. Tablets, pills, capsules, troches and the like may also contain binders, excipients, disintegrating agent, lubricants, glidants, sweetening agents, and flavoring agents. Some examples of binders include microcrystalline cellulose, gum tragacanth or gelatin. Examples of excipients include starch or lactose. Some examples of disintegrating agents include alginic acid, corn starch and the like. Examples of lubricants include magnesium stearate or potassium stearate. An example of a glidant is colloidal silicon dioxide. Some examples of sweetening agents include sucrose, saccharin and the like. Examples of flavoring agents include peppermint, methyl salicylate, orange flavoring and the like. Materials used in preparing these various compositions should be pharmaceutically pure and non-toxic in the amounts used. In another embodiment, the composition is administered as a tablet or a capsule. [0087] Various other materials may be present as coatings or to modify the physical form of the dosage unit. For instance, tablets may be coated with shellac, sugar or both. A syrup or elixir may contain, in addition to the active ingredient, sucrose as a sweetening agent, methyl and propylparabens as preservatives, a dye and a flavoring such as cherry or orange flavor, and the like. For vaginal administration, a pharmaceutical composition may be presented as pessaries, tampons, creams, gels, pastes, foams or spray. [0088] The pharmaceutical composition can also be administered by nasal administration. As used herein, nasally administering or nasal administration includes administering the composition to the mucus membranes of the nasal passage or nasal cavity of the patient. As used herein, pharmaceutical compositions for nasal administration of a composition include therapeutically effective amounts of the compounds prepared by well-known methods to be administered, for example, as a nasal spray, nasal drop, suspension, gel, ointment, cream or powder. Administration of the composition may also take place using a nasal tampon or nasal sponge. [0089] For topical administration, suitable formulations may include biocompatible oil, wax, gel, powder, polymer, or other liquid or solid carriers. Such formulations may be administered by applying directly to affected tissues, for example, a liquid formulation to treat infection of conjunctival tissue can be administered dropwise to the subject's eye, or a cream formulation can be administered to the skin. [0090] Rectal administration includes administering the pharmaceutical compositions into the rectum or large intestine. This can be accomplished using suppositories or enemas. Suppository formulations can easily be made by methods known in the art. For example, suppository formulations can be prepared by heating glycerin to about 120oC, dissolving the pharmaceutical composition in the glycerin, mixing the heated glycerin after which purified water may be added, and pouring the hot mixture into a suppository mold. [0091] Transdermal administration includes percutaneous absorption of the composition through the skin. Transdermal formulations include patches, ointments, creams, gels, salves and the like. [0092] In addition to the usual meaning of administering the formulations described herein to any part, tissue or organ whose primary function is gas exchange with the external environment, for purposes of the present invention, "pulmonary" will also mean to include a tissue or cavity that is contingent to the respiratory tract, in particular, the sinuses. For pulmonary administration, an aerosol formulation containing the active agent, a manual pump spray, nebulizer or pressurized metered-dose inhaler as well as dry powder formulations are contemplated. Suitable formulations of this type can also include other agents, such as antistatic agents, to maintain the disclosed compounds as effective aerosols. [0093] A drug delivery device for delivering aerosols comprises a suitable aerosol canister with a metering valve containing a pharmaceutical aerosol formulation as described and an actuator housing adapted to hold the canister and allow for drug delivery. The canister in the drug delivery device has a head space representing greater than about 15% of the total volume of the canister. Often, the compound intended for pulmonary administration is dissolved, suspended or emulsified in a mixture of a solvent, surfactant and propellant. The mixture is maintained under pressure in a canister that has been sealed with a metering valve. [0094] The invention also encompasses the treatment of a condition associated with a dysfunction in proteostasis in a subject comprising administering to said subject an effective amount of a disclosed compound that enhances, improves or restores proteostasis of a protein. Proteostasis refers to protein homeostasis. Dysfunction in protein homeostasis is a result of protein misfolding, protein aggregation, defective protein trafficking or protein degradation. For example, the invention encompasses administering a compound of e.g., Formula (I) that corrects protein misfolding, reduces protein aggregation, corrects or restores protein trafficking and/or affects protein degradation for the treatment of a condition associated with a dysfunction in proteostasis. In some aspects of the invention, a compound of e.g., Formula (I) that corrects protein misfolding and/or corrects or restores protein trafficking is administered. In cystic fibrosis, the mutated or defective enzyme is the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). One of the most common mutations of this protein is AF508 which is a deletion (Δ) of three nucleotides resulting in a loss of the amino acid phenylalanine (F) at the 508th (508) position on the protein. As described above, mutated cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator exists in a misfolded state and is characterized by altered trafficking as compared to the wild type CFTR. Additional exemplary proteins of which there can be a dysfunction in proteostasis, for example that can exist in a misfolded state, include, but are not limited to, glucocerebrosidase, hexosamine A, aspartylglucsaminidase, a-galactosidase A, cysteine transporter, acid ceremidase, acid a-L-fucosidase, protective protein, cathepsin A, acid β- glucosidase, acid β-galactosidase, iduronate 2-sulfatase, a-L-iduronidase, galactocerebrosidase, acid a -mannosidase, acid β -mannosidase, arylsulfatase B, arylsulfatase A, N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfate sulfatase, acid β -galactosidase, N- acetylglucosamine-1 -phosphotransferase, acid sphingmyelinase, NPC-1, acid a-glucosidase, β-hexosamine B, heparin N-sulfatase, a -N-acetylglucosaminidase, a -glucosaminide N- acetyltransferase, N-acetylglucosamine-6-sulfate sulfatase, a -N-acetylgalactosaminidase, a -neuramidase, β -glucuronidase, β-hexosamine A and acid lipase, polyglutamine, a - synuclein, TDP-43, superoxide dismutase (SOD), Αβ peptide, tau protein, transthyretin and insulin. Disclosed compounds for example, in some embodiments, may be used to restore proteostasis (e.g., correct folding and/or alter trafficking) of the proteins described above. [0095] Protein conformational diseases encompass gain of function disorders and loss of function disorders. In one embodiment, the protein conformational disease is a gain of function disorder. The terms "gain of function disorder," "gain of function disease," "gain of toxic function disorder" and "gain of toxic function disease" are used interchangeably herein. A gain of function disorder is a disease characterized by increased aggregation- associated proteotoxicity. In these diseases, aggregation exceeds clearance inside and/or outside of the cell. Gain of function diseases include, but are not limited to, neurodegenerative diseases associated with aggregation of polyglutamine, Lewy body diseases, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, transthyretin-associated aggregation diseases, Alzheimer's disease, Machado- Joseph disease, cerebral B-amyloid angiopathy, retinal ganglion cell degeneration, tauopathies (progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, frontotemporal lobar degeneration), cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis, Alexander disease, Serpinopathies, familial amyloidotic neuropathy, senile systemic amyloidosis, ApoAI amyloidosis, ApoAII amyloidosis, ApoAIV amyloidosis, familial amyloidosis of the Finnish type, lysoyzme amyloidosis, fibrinogen amyloidosis, dialysis amyloidosis, inclusion body myositis/myopathy, cataracts, medullary thyroid carcinoma, cardiac atrial amyloidosis, pituitary prolactinoma, hereditary lattice corneal dystrophy, cutaneous lichen amyloidosis, corneal lactoferrin amyloidosis, corneal lactoferrin amyloidosis, pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, odontogenic tumor amyloid, seminal vesical amyloid, sickle cell disease, critical illness myopathy, von Hippel-Lindau disease, spinocerebellar ataxia 1, Angelman syndrome, giant axon neuropathy, inclusion body myopathy with Paget disease of bone, frontotemporal dementia (IBMPFD) and prion diseases.

Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the formation of two types of aggregates: extracellular aggregates of Αβ peptide and intracellular aggregates of the microtubule associated protein tau. Transthyretin-associated aggregation diseases include, for example, senile systemic amyloidoses and familial amyloidotic neuropathy. Lewy body diseases are characterized by an aggregation of a-synuclein protein and include, for example, Parkinson's disease, lewy body dementia (LBD) and multiple system atrophy (SMA). Prion diseases (also known as transmissible spongiform encephalopathies or TSEs) are characterized by aggregation of prion proteins. Exemplary human prion diseases are Creutzfeldt- Jakob Disease (CJD), Variant Creutzfeldt- Jakob Disease, Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker Syndrome, Fatal Familial Insomnia and Kuru. In another embodiment, the misfolded protein is alpha- 1 antitrypsin. [0096] In a further embodiment, the protein conformation disease is a loss of function disorder. The terms "loss of function disease" and "loss of function disorder" are used interchangeably herein. Loss of function diseases are a group of diseases characterized by inefficient folding of a protein resulting in excessive degradation of the protein. Loss of function diseases include, for example, lysosomal storage diseases. Lysosomal storage diseases are a group of diseases characterized by a specific lysosomal enzyme deficiency which may occur in a variety of tissues, resulting in the build-up of molecules normally degraded by the deficient enzyme. The lysosomal enzyme deficiency can be in a lysosomal hydrolase or a protein involved in the lysosomal trafficking. Lysosomal storage diseases include, but are not limited to, aspartylglucosaminuria, Fabry's disease, Batten disease, Cystinosis, Farber, Fucosidosis, Galactasidosialidosis, Gaucher's disease (including Types 1, 2 and 3), Gml gangliosidosis, Hunter's disease, Hurler- Scheie's disease, Krabbe's disease, a-Mannosidosis, β-Mannosidosis, Maroteaux-Lamy's disease, Metachromatic Leukodystrophy, Morquio A syndrome, Morquio B syndrome, Mucolipidosis II, Mucolipidosis III, Neimann-Pick Disease (including Types A, B and C), Pompe's disease, Sandhoff disease, Sanfilippo syndrome (including Types A, B, C and D), Schindler disease, Schindler-Kanzaki disease, Sialidosis, Sly syndrome, Tay-Sach's disease and Wolman disease.

[00101] Additional conditions associated with a dysfunction of proteostasis include hemoglobinopathies, inflammatory diseases, intermediate filament diseases, drug-induced lung damage and hearing loss. Methods for the treatment of hemoglobinopathies (such as sickle cell anemia), an inflammatory disease (such as inflammatory bowel disease, colitis, ankylosing spondylitis), intermediate filament diseases (such as non-alcoholic and alcoholic fatty liver disease) and drug induced lung damage (such as methotrexate-induced lung damage) are also contemplated herein. In other embodiments, methods for treating hearing loss, such as noise-induced hearing loss, aminoglycoside-induced hearing loss, and cisplatin- induced hearing loss comprising administering disclosed compounds are provided herein.

[00103] The disclosure is illustrated by the following examples which are not meant to be limiting in any way. EXEMPLIFICATION [00104] The compounds described herein can be prepared in a number of ways based on the teachings contained herein and synthetic procedures known in the art. In the description of the synthetic methods described below, it is to be understood that all proposed reaction conditions, including choice of solvent, reaction atmosphere, reaction temperature, duration of the experiment and workup procedures, can be chosen to be the conditions standard for that reaction, unless otherwise indicated. It is understood by one skilled in the art of organic synthesis that the functionality present on various portions of the molecule should be compatible with the reagents and reactions proposed. Substituents not compatible with the reaction conditions will be apparent to one skilled in the art, and alternate methods are therefore indicated. The starting materials for the examples are either commercially available or are readily prepared by standard methods from known materials. At least some of the compounds identified as "intermediates" herein are contemplated as compounds of the invention. Example 1.

In this method, primary lung epithelial cells (hBEs) homozygous for the Cystic Fibrosis- causing AF508 mutation are differentiated for a minimum of 4 weeks in an air-liquid interface on SnapWell filter plates prior to the Ussing measurements. Cells are apically mucus-washed for 30 minutes prior to treatment with compounds. The basolateral media is removed and replaced with media containing the compound of interest diluted to its final concentration from DMSO stocks. Treated cells are incubated at 37°C and 5% CO2 for 24 hours. At the end of the treatment period, the cells on filters are transferred to the Ussing chamber and equilibrated for 30 minutes. The short-circuit current is measured in voltage clamp-mode (Vhoid = 0 mV), and the entire assay is conducted at a temperature of 36°C - 36.5°C. Once the voltages stabilized, the chambers are clamped, and data is recorded by pulse readings every 5 seconds. Following baseline current stabilization, the following additions can be applied and the changes in current and resistance of the cells can be monitored: 1. Benzamil to the apical chamber to inhibit ENaC sodium channel. 2. Forskolin to both chambers to activate AF508-CFTR by phosphorylation. 3. Genistein to both chambers to potentiate AF508-CFTR channel opening. 4. CFTRinh-172 to the apical chamber to inhibit AF508-CFTR CI- conductance. [00286] The inhibitable current (that current that is blocked by CFTRinh-172) is measured as the specific activity of the AF508-CFTR channel, and increases in response to compound in this activity over that observed in vehicle-treated samples are identified as the correction of AF508-CFTR function imparted by the compound tested. it hBE Equivalent Current (leq) Assay [00287] Primary lung epithelial cells homozygous for the Cystic Fibrosis-causing AF508 mutation were differentiated for a minimum of 4 weeks in an air-liquid interface on Costar 24 well HTS filter plates prior to the equivalent current (leq) measurements. Cells were apically mucus-washed for 30 minutes 24h prior to treatment with compounds. The basolateral media was removed and replaced with media containing the compound of interest diluted to its final concentration from DMSO stocks. Treated cells were incubated at 37°C and 5% CO2 for 24 hours. At the end of the treatment period, the media was changed to the leq experimental solution for 30 minutes before the experiment and plates are maintained in a C02-free incubator during this period. The plates containing the cells were then placed in pre-warmed heating blocks at 36°C±0.5 for 15 minutes before measurements are taken. The transepithelial voltage (VT) and conductance (GT) were measured using a custom 24 channel current clamp (TECC-24) with 24 well electrode manifold. The leq assay measurements were made following additions with standardized time periods: 1. The baseline VT and GT values were measured for approximately 20 minutes. 2. Benzamil was added to block E aC for 15 minutes. 3. Forskolin plus VX-770 were added to maximally activate AF508-CFTR for 27 minutes. 4. Bumetanide was added to inhibit the NaK^Cl cotransporter and shut-off secretion of chloride. [00288] The activity data captured was the area under the curve (AUC) for the traces of the equivalent chloride current. The AUC was collected from the time of the forskolin/VX-770 addition until the inhibition by bumetanide addition. Correction in response to compound treatment was scored as the increase in the AUC for compound-treated samples over that of vehicle-treated samples. The results are shown below in Table 2 (++ indicates activity >25% run at 10 uM of VX-809 at 1 uM; + indicates activity 10 to < 25% run at 10 uM of VX-809 at 1 uM; ** indicates activity >200% of VX-809 (1 uM) with compound at 10 uM and VX-809 at 1 uM; * indicates activity 100-200% of VX-809 (1 uM) with compound at 10 uM and VX-809 at 1 uM) Table 2 [002891 Example 27 i.
