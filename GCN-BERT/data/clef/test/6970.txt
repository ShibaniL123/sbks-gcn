Step 5: Benzyl 4-((2-hydroxy-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-phenylacetoxy)methyl)piperidine-1-carboxylate
A cooled (0Â° C.) solution of piperidin-4-ylmethyl 2-hydroxy-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-phenylacetate (12.8 g, 37.5 mmol) and triethylamine (21 mL, 150 mmol) in DCM (375 mL) was added with dropwise benzyl chloroformate (10.7 mL, 75 mmol). The reaction mixture was allowed to warm slowly to room temperature over 18 hours. The reaction mixture was washed with saturated aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate and the organic phase was dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered and the filtrate evaporated under reduced pressure. The residue was dissolved in DCM (190 mL) and N-methylpiperazine (42.1 mL, 379 mmol) and the reaction mixture stirred at room temperature for 18 hours. The reaction mixture was washed with saturated aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate and the organic phase was dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered and the filtrate evaporated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by flash column chromatography (eluent-100% DCM to 20:1 DCM/methanol). This reaction was performed twice on the same scale to afford the title compound (28.2 g, 79%).
