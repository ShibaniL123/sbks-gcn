The present invention is directed to a method of photostabilizing photolabile UV absorbers, particularly dibenzoylmethane derivatives, such as Avobenzone, with cyano-containing fused tricyclic compounds. More particularly, it has been found that cyano-containing fused tricyclic compounds (CCFTs) quench the singlet and/or triplet excited energy state of photounstable UV absorbers, e.g., dibenzoylmethane derivatives; and/or accept or donate an electron from or to UV absorbers, thereby returning photolabile UV absorbers, such as dibenzoylmethane derivatives, back to their ground state so that they can absorb more photons, e.g., from ultraviolet light, thereby photostabilizing the dibenzoylmethane derivatives, particularly butylmethoxy dibenzoylmethane (Avobenzone) in photoactive sunscreen, cosmetic and dermatological compositions. When a photolabile UV absorber, such as dibenzoylmethane derivative is excited to a singlet and/or triplet excited state and is contacted with a cyano-containing fused tricyclic compound (CCFT), regardless of the mechanism, the excited dibenzoylmethane derivative is returned to its ground state so that it can absorb more UV radiation, thereby protecting the skin for longer durations. BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART Dibenzoylmethane derivatives are compounds that absorb the full spectrum of UVA radiation. The absorption of UVA radiation (at 320-400 nm) by a dibenzoylmethane derivative causes the excitation of an electron in the dibenzoylmethane derivative molecule from an initially occupied, lower energy orbital to a higher energy, previously unoccupied orbital. The energy of the absorbed photon is used to energize an electron and cause it to “jump” to a higher energy orbital. See Turro, Modern Molecular Photochemistry, 1991. Two excited electronic states derive from the electronic orbital configuration produced by UV light absorption. In one state, the electron spins are paired (antiparallel) and in the other state the electron spins are unpaired (parallel). The state with paired spins has no resultant spin magnetic moment, but the state with unpaired spins possesses a net spin magnetic moment. A state with paired spins remains a single state in the presence of a magnetic field, and is termed a singlet state. A state with unpaired spins interacts with a magnetic field and splits into three quantized states, and is termed a triplet state. In the electronically excited state, the UV absorbing molecule, e.g., dibenzoylmethane derivative, is prone to degrade via a number of known pathways and, therefore, can absorb little or no additional UV light. To photostabilize an electronically excited, chromophore-containing, UV absorbing organic molecule in order to provide sufficient UV protection, it must be returned to the ground state before it undergoes a photochemical reaction destructive to its UV absorbing capability. There are known photostabilizing sunscreen additives, such as Octocrylene, methylbenzylidene camphor, and the esters or polyesters of naphthalene dicarboxylic acid of this assignee's U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,113,931; 6,284,916; 6,518,451; and 6,551,605, all hereby incorporated by reference, that are capable of quenching excited triplet state energy from dibenzoylmethane derivatives. Surprisingly, it has been found that cyano-containing fused tricyclic compounds return chromophore-containing organic molecules, particularly butyl methoxydibenzoylmethane (Avobenzone), octyl methoxycinnamate (Octinoxate), and octyl salicylate (Octisalate), from either an electronically excited singlet state or excited triplet state back to their ground state, thereby photostabilizing the UV-absorbing organic molecules. Deflandre U.S. Pat. No. 5,576,354 generally discloses a cosmetic sunscreen composition containing at least 1% by weight of an α-cyano-β,β-diphenylacrylate that will photostabilize a dibenzoylmethane derivative, e.g., Parsol 1789 (Avobenzone), so long as the composition contains a fatty phase, e.g., glycerol stearates, isopropyl myristate or the like, and so long as the mole ratio of the α-cyano-β,β-diphenylacrylate to the dibenzoylmethane derivative is at least 0.8. Octocrylene is known to quench (accept) the excited triplet state energy of an excited photoactive compound by dissipating the energy kinetically in the form of rapid isomerizations. This process is shown below: wherein the α-cyano-β,β-diphenylacrylate compound (octocrylene shown above as structure A), accepts the triplet excited state energy from a photoactive compound and forms a diradical (shown above as structure A*) at the α and β positions of the acrylate, which converts the double bond into a single bond and allows for the free rotation of the phenyl groups. This rotation occurs rapidly and efficiently to dissipate any excited triplet state energy accepted by the α-cyano-β,β-diphenylacrylate compound from the photoactive compound. While octocrylene is able to quench (accept) the triplet excited state energy from a photoactive compound, thereby photostabilizing, to some degree, dibenzoylmethane derivatives, as shown in examples 1, 4, 6 and 8 of Deflandre et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5,576,354, there exists a need in the photoactive composition art to find one or more compounds that quench (accept) the singlet excited state energy and preferably also the triplet excited state energy from photoactive compounds, which octocrylene does not. Quite surprisingly, it has been found that the cyano-containing fused tricyclic compounds described herein will quench excited state energy of UV-absorbing organic molecules, such as dibenzoylmethane derivatives, particularly Avobenzone, returning the excited UV-absorbing organic molecules to their ground state for additional UV absorption. SUMMARY The electronic excited state energy—singlet state and/or triplet state energy from a UV-absorbing molecule, particularly a dibenzoylmethane derivative, such as Avobenzone, has been found to be readily quenched by contact with a cyano-containing fused tricyclic compound. In one aspect, the disclosure provides a method of quenching excited state energy from a chromophore compound, particularly a dibenzoylmethane derivative, that has been excited by exposure to and absorption of UV radiation comprising quenching the excited state energy of an excited chromophore, UV absorbing compound with a cyano-containing fused tricyclic compound of Formula I: wherein: A is selected from the group consisting of O, S, C═O, and n is selected from the group consisting of 0 and 1; and, R1 and R2 are each independently selected from the group consisting of alkyl, cycloalkyl, ether, aryl, and amino. In another aspect, the invention provides a sunscreen, cosmetic or dermatological composition for coating a skin surface to protect the skin from absorbing damaging amounts of UV radiation when skin is exposed to sunlight, or other UV radiation, said composition containing a compound of Formula Ia, Ib, Ic, Id, Ie, or a combination thereof: wherein R1 and R2 are each independently selected from the group consisting of alkyl, cycloalkyl, ether, aryl, and amino. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIG. 1 is a graph showing the superior ability of cyano-containing fused tricyclic compounds to photostabilize Avobenzone in comparison to the ethylhexyl methoxycrylene of this Assignee's U.S. Pat. Nos. 8,075,808; 7,754,191; 7,173,519; 7,597,825; 7,588,702; and 7,959,834; and U.S. Patent Application No. 2009/0246157. FIG. 2 is a graph showing the superior ability of cyano-containing fused tricyclic compounds to photostabilize a combination of Avobenzone and octylmethoxy cinnamate (OMC) in comparison to the ethylhexyl methoxycrylene of this Assignee's U.S. Pat. Nos. 8,075,808; 7,754,191; 7,173,519; 7,597,825; 7,588,702; and 7,959,834; and U.S. Patent Application No. 2009/0246157. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS Ranges may be expressed herein as from “about” or “approximately” one particular value and/or to “about” or “approximately” another particular value. When such a range is expressed, another embodiment includes from the one particular value and/or to the other particular value. Similarly, when values are expressed as approximations, by use of the antecedent “about,” it will be understood that the particular value forms another embodiment. Quite surprisingly, it has been found that cyano-containing fused tricyclic compounds will quench electronically excited UV-absorbing chromophore molecules, particularly dibenzoylmethane derivatives, caused by the chromophore molecule reaching an excited singlet and/or triplet state when excited by absorption of UV radiation. As a result, the excited state of the chromophore-containing molecules, particularly Avobenzone, is returned to the ground state, thereby photostabilizing the chromophore-containing molecule so that it can absorb additional UV radiation. Accordingly, by applying one or more of the cyano-containing fused tricyclic compounds, in a dermatologically or cosmetically acceptable carrier, onto mammalian skin, e.g., human skin, the skin will not be damaged as a result of the UV absorbing molecule being unable to absorb additional UV radiation. Thus, the compositions and methods described herein advantageously quench the excited states reached by chromophore-containing compounds, particularly dibenzoylmethane derivatives, thereby photostabilizing the UV-absorbing molecules to allow them to absorb additional UV radiation.

In some embodiments, the compounds of Formula I include the compounds of Formula Ia, Ib, Ic, Id, Ie, and If: In some embodiments, R1 is C1-C30 alkyl, C1-C20 alkyl, or C1-C10 alkyl. For example, R1 can include, but is not limited to, methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, or 2-ethylhexyl. In some embodiments, R2 is C1-C30 alkyl, C1-C20 alkyl, or C1-C10 alkyl. For example, R2 can include, but is not limited to, methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, or 2-ethylhexyl. In some exemplary embodiments, the compounds of Formula I are selected from the group consisting of: In accordance with one important embodiment, a cyano-containing fused tricyclic compound of Formula I, Ia, Iai, Ib, Ibi, Ic, Ici, Id, Idi, Ie, Iei, If, Ifi, or a combination thereof is included in a sunscreen, cosmetic or dermatological composition for coating a skin surface to protect the skin from UV damage when exposed to sunlight, or other UV radiation. In preferred embodiments, the sunscreen, cosmetic or dermatological composition includes a UVA filter and/or a UVB filter compound and/or a broad-band filter compound, particularly a dibenzoylmethane derivative UVA filter that is photostabilized by the cyano-containing fused tricyclic compound for protection of the skin from UVA and/or UVB wavelengths. The cyano-containing fused tricyclic compound of Formula I can be included in the sunscreen, cosmetic or dermatological composition in an amount of about 0.01% by weight to about 20% by weight, preferably from about 0.1 to about 20% by weight, more preferably from about 0.1% to about 10% by weight, in each case based on the total weight of the composition. The total amount of one or more water-soluble UV filter substances in the finished sunscreen, cosmetic, or dermatological preparations is advantageously chosen from the range 0.01% by weight to about 20% by weight, preferably from about 0.1 to about 20% by weight, more preferably from about 0.1% to about 10% by weight, in each case based on the total weight of the composition. Preferred UV filter compounds are disclosed in published PCT application WO 2009/020676, hereby incorporated by reference for preferred water-soluble, organic and particulate UV filter compounds. In a preferred embodiment, the sunscreen, cosmetic or dermatological compositions described herein contain one or more of the cyano-containing fused tricyclic compounds as well as one or more UV-absorbing, chromophore-containing compounds. The compositions preferably include both UV-A and UV-B photoactive compounds in a cosmetically acceptable carrier, optionally including additives, such as emollients, stabilizers, emulsifiers, and combinations thereof. These additives can be used in preparing a UV filter composition in an emulsion (oil-in-water or water-in-oil) from a composition that includes one or more photoactive compounds and a solvent or a solvent combination that includes one or more organic solvents and water. When made, preferably the emulsion is an oil-in-water emulsion, wherein the oil phase is primarily formed from a mixture of the UV filter compound(s), preferably including a dibenzoylmethane derivative, such as Avobenzone, and one or more organic solvents. A typical photoactive composition includes one or more photoactive compounds, wherein the photoactive compound(s) act to absorb UV radiation and thereby protect the substrate (e.g., human skin, resins, films, and the like) from the harmful effects of UV radiation. The absorption process causes a photoactive compound to reach an excited state, wherein the excited state is characterized by the presence of excited electronic energy (e.g., singlet state energy or triplet state energy), as compared to the ground state of the photoactive compound. Once a photoactive compound reaches an excited state there exists a number of pathways by which the excited photoactive compound can dissipate its excess energy (e.g., singlet and/or triplet energy), however, many of those pathways adversely affect the ability of the photoactive compound to further absorb UV radiation. The cyano-containing fused tricyclic molecules described herein accept electronic singlet excited state energy from UV-absorbers, particularly Avobenzone, octyl methoxycinnamate (Octinoxate), and octyl salicylate (Octisalate). The cyano-containing fused tricyclic compounds also are very effective UVA absorbers in addition to providing electronic singlet state energy quenching of other UV-absorbing compounds in sunscreen, cosmetic and dermatological compositions. The cyano-containing fused tricyclic molecules described herein are especially effective when combined with one or more additional electronic singlet excited state quenching compounds such as oxybenzone and/or any of the alkoxy crylene disclosed in this assignee's U.S. Pat. Nos. 8,075,808; 7,754,191; 7,173,519; 7,597,825; 7,588,702; and 7,959,834; and U.S. Patent Application No. 2009/0246157, hereby incorporated by reference. Particularly surprising photostabilization is achieved in sunscreen compositions containing the cyano-containing fused tricyclic molecules described herein together with octyl methoxycinnamate and Avobenzone. A photoactive compound is one that responds to light photoelectrically. In the compositions and methods of photostabilization disclosed herein, a photoactive compound is one that responds to UV radiation photoelectrically. For example, all photoactive compound-containing compositions that respond to UV radiation photoelectrically by photoactive compound photodegradation benefit highly by the inclusion of the cyano-containing fused tricyclicmolecules described herein. The cyano-containing fused tricyclic compounds described herein are useful photostabilizers and/or photoactive compounds when combined with any single or combination of photoactive compounds identified in Shaath, Nadim, Encyclopedia of UV filters, © 2007, hereby incorporated by reference. Photostability is a problem with all UV filters because they all reach an electronic singlet excited state upon exposure to UV radiation.

Chemicals Commonly-assigned U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,485,713 and 6,537,529, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference, describe compositions and methods for increasing the photostability of photoactive compounds in a sunscreen composition, e.g., by the addition of polar solvents to the oil phase of a composition. By increasing the polarity of the oil phase of a sunscreen composition including the alkoxy crylenes described herein, e.g., methoxy crylene, the stability of the sunscreen composition is surprisingly increased in comparison to octocrylene. In the sunscreen compositions described herein, preferably, one or more of a highly polar solvent is present in the oil-phase of the composition. Preferably, a sufficient amount of a polar solvent is present in the sunscreen composition to raise the dielectric constant of the oil-phase of the composition to a dielectric constant of at least about 7, preferably at least about 8. With or without the highly polar solvent in the oil phase, the methoxy crylene molecules described herein yield unexpected photostability in comparison to octocrylene. A photoactive compound can be considered stable when, for example, after 30 MED irradiation the photoactive compound has retained at least about 90% of its original absorbance at a wavelength, or over a range of wavelengths of interest (e.g., the wavelength at which a photoactive compound has a peak absorbance, such as 350-370 nm for Avobenzone). Likewise, a sunscreen composition can include a plurality of photoactive compounds and a sunscreen composition, as a whole, can be considered stable when, for example, after 30 MED irradiation the sunscreen composition has retained at least about 90% of its original absorbance at one or more wavelengths of interest (e.g., at or near the peak absorbance wavelength of the primary photoactive compound). In accordance with one important embodiment, a cyano-containing fused tricyclic compound formula (I) is combined in a sunscreen, cosmetic or dermatological formulation with a water soluble UV filter compound and/or a broad-band filter compound and optionally, but preferably, together with a dibenzoylmethane derivative and/or a dialkyl naphthalate. Advantageous water-soluble UV filter substances for the purposes of the present invention are sulfonated UV filters, in particular: phenylene-1,4-bis(2-benzimidazyl)-3,3′-5,5′-tetrasulfonic acid, which has the following structure: and its salts, especially the corresponding sodium, potassium or triethanolammonium salts, in particular phenylene-1,4-bis(2-benzimidazyl)-1-3,3′-5,5′-tetrasulfonic acid bissodium salt with the INCI name disodium phenyl dibenzimidazole tetrasulfonate (CAS No.: 180898-37-7), which is obtainable for example under the proprietary name Neo Heliopan A P from Haarmann & Reimer. Further advantageous sulfonated UV filters for the purposes of the present invention are the salts of 2-phenylbenzimidazole-5-sulfonic acid, such as its sodium, potassium or its triethanolammonium salts, and the sulfonic acid itself with the INCI name phenylbenzimidazole sulfonic acid (CAS No. 27503-81-7), which is obtainable for example under the proprietary name Eusolex 232 from Merck or under Neo Heliopan Hydro from Haarmann & Reimer. Further advantageous water-soluble UV-B and/or broad-band filter substances for the purposes of the present invention are, for example, sulfonic acid derivatives of 3-benzylidenecamphor, such as, for example, 4-(2-oxo-3-bornylidenemethyl)benzene-sulfonic acid, 2-methyl-5-(2-oxo-3-bornylidenemethyl)sulfonic acid and the salts thereof. The total amount of one or more water-soluble UV filter substances in the finished cosmetic or dermatological preparations is advantageously chosen from the range 0.01% by weight to 20% by weight, preferably from 0.1 to 10% by weight, in each case based on the total weight of the preparations.
