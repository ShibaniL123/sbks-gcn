CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS The present application claims the benefit of priority under 35 U.S.C. §119 of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61/551,133 filed Oct. 25, 2011 and entitled “Alkaline Earth Alumino-Silicate Glass Compositions with Improved Chemical And Mechanical Durability,” the entirety of which is incorporated by reference herein. BACKGROUND 1. Field The present specification generally relates to glass compositions and, more specifically, to chemically durable glass compositions which are suitable for use in pharmaceutical packaging. 2. Technical Background Historically, glass has been used as the preferred material for packaging pharmaceuticals because of its hermeticity, optical clarity, and excellent chemical durability relative to other materials. Specifically, the glass used in pharmaceutical packaging must have adequate chemical durability so as to not affect the stability of the pharmaceutical compositions contained therein. Glasses having suitable chemical durability include those glass compositions within the ASTM standard ‘Type 1A’ and ‘Type 1B’ glass compositions which have a proven history of chemical durability. Although Type 1A and Type 1B glass compositions are commonly used in pharmaceutical packages, they do suffer from several deficiencies. Foremost is the tendency of these glasses to phase separate. Specifically, the glass tends to separate on a fine microscopic scale into an alkali borate phase and a silica rich phase. This phase separation may be a precursor to the glass flakes and de-lamination phenomena that have been reported in such glasses. A second deficiency is that the low levels of alkali and alumina in Type 1A and Type 1B glass compositions result in only a minimal ability to ion exchange and strengthen these glasses. As a result, pharmaceutical packages made from Type 1A and 1B pharmaceutical glasses offer poor resistance to damage from mechanical events such as impacts and scratches. Accordingly, a need exists for glass compositions which are chemically durable and susceptible to chemical strengthening by ion exchange for use in glass pharmaceutical packages and similar applications. SUMMARY According to one embodiment, the glass composition may include from about 65 mol. % to about 75 mol. % SiO2; from about 6 mol. % to about 12.5 mol. % Al2O3; and from about 5 mol. % to about 12 mol. % alkali oxide, wherein the alkali oxide comprises Na2O and K2O. The K2O may be present in an amount less than or equal to 0.5 mol. %. The glass composition may also include from about 8.0 mol. % to about 15 mol. % of at least one alkaline earth oxide. The glass composition may be susceptible to strengthening by ion-exchange.

The alkali oxide may include Na2O and K2O. K2O may be present in an amount less than or equal to 0.5 mol. %. The composition may be free from boron and compounds of boron. The glass article may have at least a class S3 acid resistance according to DIN 12116; a class A1 base resistance according to ISO 695; and a type HGA1 hydrolytic resistance according to ISO 720.

It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description describe various embodiments and are intended to provide an overview or framework for understanding the nature and character of the claimed subject matter. The accompanying drawing is included to provide a further understanding of the various embodiments, and is incorporated into and constitutes a part of this specification.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIG. 1 graphically depicts the ion-exchange properties (compressive stress and depth of layer) for an inventive glass composition and, for purposes of comparison, Type 1B glass compositions. DETAILED DESCRIPTION Reference will now be made in detail to various embodiments of glass compositions which exhibit improved chemical and mechanical durability. Such glass compositions are suitable for use in various applications including, without limitation, as pharmaceutical packaging materials. The glass compositions may also be chemically strengthened, thereby imparting increased mechanical durability to the glass. The glass compositions described herein generally comprise silica (SiO2), alumina (Al2O3), alkaline earth oxides, and alkali oxides (such as Na2O and K2O) in amounts which impart chemical durability to the glass composition. Moreover, the alkali oxide present in the glass compositions facilitate chemically strengthening the glass compositions by ion exchange. Various embodiments of the glass compositions will be described herein and further illustrated with reference to specific examples. The term “softening point,” as used herein, refers to the temperature at which the viscosity of the glass composition is 1×107.6 poise. The term “annealing point,” as used herein, refers to the temperature at which the viscosity of the glass composition is 1×1013 poise. The term “CTE,” as used herein, refers to the coefficient of thermal expansion of the glass composition over a temperature range from about room temperature (RT) to about 300° C. The term “chemical durability,” as used herein, refers to the ability of the glass composition to resist degradation upon exposure to specified chemical conditions. Specifically, the chemical durability of the glass compositions described herein was assessed according to three established material testing standards: DIN 12116 dated March 2001 and entitled “Testing of glass—Resistance to attack by a boiling aqueous solution of hydrochloric acid—Method of test and classification;” ISO 695:1991, entitled “Glass—Resistance to attack by a boiling aqueous solution of mixed alkali—Method of test and classification”; and ISO 720:1985 entitled “Glass—Hydrolytic resistance of glass grains at 121 degrees C.—Method of test and classification.” The classifications within each standard are described further herein. The terms “free” and “substantially free,” when used to describe the concentration and/or absence of a particular constituent component in a glass composition, means that the constituent component is not intentionally added to the glass composition. However, the glass composition may contain traces of the constituent component as a contaminant or tramp in amounts of less than 0.01 mol. %. The glass compositions described herein are alkaline earth alumino-silicate glass compositions which generally include a combination of SiO2, Al2O3, at least one alkaline earth oxide, and alkali oxide including at least Na2O and K2O. In some embodiments, the glass compositions may also be free from boron and compounds containing boron. The combination of these components enables a glass composition which is resistant to chemical degradation and is also suitable for chemical strengthening by ion exchange. In some embodiments, the glass compositions may further comprise minor amounts of one or more additional oxides such as, for example, SnO2, ZrO2, ZnO, or the like. These components may be added as fining agents and/or to further enhance the chemical durability of the glass composition. In the embodiments of the glass compositions described herein, SiO2 is the largest constituent of the composition and, as such, is the primary constituent of the glass network. SiO2 enhances the chemical durability of the glass and, in particular, the resistance of the glass composition to decomposition in acid. Accordingly, a high SiO2 concentration is generally desired. However, if the content of SiO2 is too high, the formability of the glass may be diminished as higher concentrations of SiO2 increase the difficulty of melting the glass which, in turn, adversely impacts the formability of the glass. However, additions of alkali oxide assist in offsetting this effect by decreasing the softening point of the glass. In the embodiments described herein, the glass composition generally comprises SiO2 in an amount greater than or equal to about 65 mol. % and less than or equal to about 75 mol. %. In some embodiments SiO2 is present in the glass composition in an amount greater than or equal to about 67 mol. % and less than or equal to about 75 mol. %. In some other embodiments, SiO2 is present in the glass composition in an amount greater than or equal to about 67 mol. % and less than or equal to about 73 mol. %. In each of these embodiments, the amount of SiO2 present in the glass composition may be greater than or equal to about 70 mol. % or even greater than or equal to about 72 mol. %. The glass compositions described herein further include Al2O3. Al2O3, in conjunction with alkali oxides present in the glass compositions such as Na2O or the like, improves the susceptibility of the glass to ion exchange strengthening. Moreover, additions of Al2O3 to the composition reduce the propensity of alkali constituents (such as Na and K) from leaching out of the glass and, as such, additions of Al2O3 increase the resistance of the composition to hydrolytic degradation. Moreover, additions of Al2O3 greater than about 12.5 mol. % may also increase the softening point of the glass thereby reducing the formability of the glass. Accordingly, the glass compositions described herein generally include Al2O3 in an amount greater than or equal to about 6 mol. % and less than or equal to about 12.5 mol. %. In some embodiments, the amount of Al2O3 in the glass composition is greater than or equal to about 6 mol. % and less than or equal to about 10 mol. %. In some other embodiments, the amount of Al2O3 in the glass composition is greater than or equal to about 7 mol. % and less than or equal to about 10 mol. %. The glass compositions also include at least two alkali oxides. The alkali oxides facilitate the ion exchangeability of the glass composition and, as such, facilitate chemically strengthening the glass. The alkali oxides also lower the softening point of the glass, thereby offsetting the increase in the softening point due to higher concentrations of SiO2 in the glass composition. The alkali oxides also assist in improving the chemical durability of the glass composition. The alkali oxides are generally present in the glass composition in an amount greater than or equal to about 5 mol. % and less than or equal to about 12 mol. %. In some of these embodiments, the amount of alkali oxides may be greater than or equal to about 5 mol. % and less than or equal to about 10 mol. %. In some other embodiments, the amount of alkali oxide may be greater than or equal to about 5 mol. % and less than or equal to about 8 mol. %. In all the glass compositions described herein, the alkali oxides comprise at least Na2O and K2O. In some embodiments, the alkali oxides further comprise Li2O. The ion exchangeability of the glass composition is primarily imparted to the glass composition by the amount of the alkali oxide Na2O initially present in the glass composition prior to ion exchange. Specifically, in order to achieve the desired compressive stress and depth of layer in the glass composition upon ion exchange strengthening, the glass compositions include Na2O in an amount greater than or equal to about 2.5 mol. % and less than or equal to about 10 mol. % based on the molecular weight of the glass composition. In some embodiments, the glass composition may include Na2O in an amount greater than or equal to about 3.5 mol. % and less than or equal to about 8 mol. %. In some of these embodiments, the glass composition may include Na2O in an amount greater than or equal to about 6 mol. % and less than or equal to about 8 mol. %. As noted above, the alkali oxides in the glass composition also include K2O. The amount of K2O present in the glass composition also relates to the ion exchangeability of the glass composition. Specifically, as the amount of K2O present in the glass composition increases, the compressive stress obtainable through ion exchange decreases. Accordingly, it is desirable to limit the amount of K2O present in the glass composition. In some embodiments, the amount of K2O is greater than 0 mol. % and less than or equal to about 2.5 mol. % by molecular weight of the glass composition. In some of these embodiments, the amount of K2O present in the glass composition is less than or equal to about 0.5 mol. % by molecular weight of the glass composition. As noted above, in some embodiments, the alkali oxide in the glass composition further comprises Li2O. Including Li2O in the glass composition further decreases the softening point of the glass. In embodiments where the alkali oxide includes Li2O, the Li2O may be present in an amount greater than or equal to about 1 mol. % and less than or equal to about 3 mol. %. In some embodiments, Li2O may be present in the glass composition in an amount which is greater than about 2 mol. % and less than or equal to about 3 mol. %. However, in some other embodiments, the glass composition may be substantially free of lithium and compounds containing lithium. The alkaline earth oxides present in the composition improve the meltability of the glass batch materials and increase the chemical durability of the glass composition. The presence of alkaline earth oxides in the glass composition also reduce the susceptibility of the glass to de-lamination. In the glass compositions described herein, the glass compositions generally include at least one alkaline earth oxide in a concentration greater than or equal to about 8 mol. % or even 8.5 mol. % and less than or equal to about 15 mol. %. In some embodiments, the glass composition may comprise from about 9 mol. % to about 15 mol. % of alkaline earth oxide. In some of these embodiments, the amount of alkaline earth oxide in the glass composition may be from about 10 mol. % to about 14 mol. %. The alkaline earth oxide in the glass composition may include MgO, CaO, SrO, BaO or combinations thereof. For example, in the embodiments described herein the alkaline earth oxide may include MgO. In some embodiments, MgO may be present in the glass composition in an amount which is greater than or equal to about 2 mol. % and less than or equal to about 7 mol. % by molecular weight of the glass composition, or even greater than or equal to about 3 mol. % and less than or equal to about 5 mol. % by molecular weight of the glass composition. In some other embodiments, the concentration of MgO in the glass composition may be reduced in order to lower the liquidus temperature of the glass composition and increase the liquidus viscosity, both of which improve the formability of the glass composition. For example, in some embodiments, the concentration of MgO may be greater than 0 mol. % and less than or equal to 3.5 mol. %. In some other embodiments, the concentration of MgO may be greater than 0 mol. % and less than or equal to 3.0 mol. % or even less than or equal to 2.5 mol. %. In some embodiments, the alkaline earth oxide also includes CaO. In these embodiments, CaO is present in the glass composition in an amount from about 2 mol. % to less than or equal to 7 mol. % by molecular weight of the glass composition. In some embodiments, CaO is present in the glass composition in an amount from about 3 mol. % to less than or equal to 7 mol. % by molecular weight of the glass composition. In some of these embodiments, CaO may be present in the glass composition in an amount greater than or equal to about 4 mol. % and less than or equal to about 7 mol. %. In some other embodiments, CaO may be present in the glass composition in an amount greater than or equal to about 5 mol. % and less than or equal to about 6 mol. %, such as when CaO is substituted for MgO in the alkaline earth oxide to decrease the liquidus temperature and increase the liquidus viscosity. In still other embodiments, CaO may be present in the glass in an amount greater than or equal to about 2 mol. % and less than or equal to about 5 mol. %, such as when SrO is substituted for MgO in the alkaline earth oxide to decrease the liquidus temperature and increase the liquidus viscosity. In some embodiments described herein, the alkaline earth oxide further comprises at least one of SrO or BaO. The inclusion of SrO reduces the liquidus temperature of the glass composition and, as a result, improves the formability of the glass composition. In some embodiments the glass composition may include SrO in an amount greater than 0 mol. % and less than or equal to about 6.0 mol. %. In some other embodiments, the glass composition may include SrO in an amount greater than about 0 mol. % and less than or equal to about 5 mol. %. In some of these embodiments, the glass composition may include greater than or equal to about 2 mol. % and less than or equal to about 4 mol. % SrO, such as when CaO is substituted for MgO in the alkaline earth oxide to decrease the liquidus temperature and increase the liquidus viscosity. In some other embodiments, the glass composition may include from about 1 mol. % to about 2 mol. % SrO. In still other embodiments, SrO may be present in the glass composition in an amount greater than or equal to about 3 mol. % and less than or equal to about 6 mol. %, such as when SrO is substituted for MgO in the alkaline earth oxide to decrease the liquidus temperature and increase the liquidus viscosity. In embodiments where the glass composition includes BaO, the BaO may be present in an amount greater than about 0 mol. % and less than about 2 mol. %. In some of these embodiments, BaO may be present in the glass composition in an amount less than or equal to about 1.5 mol. % or even less than or equal to about 0.5 mol. %. However, in some other embodiments, the glass composition is substantially free from barium and compounds of barium. In the embodiments of the glass compositions described herein, the glass compositions generally contain less than about 1 mol. % of boron or oxides of boron, such as B2O3. For example, in some embodiments the glass compositions may comprise greater than or equal to about 0 mol. % B2O3 and less than or equal to 1 mol. % B2O3. In some other embodiments, the glass compositions may comprise greater than or equal to about 0 mol. % B2O3 and less than or equal to 0.6 mol. % B2O3. In still other embodiments, the glass compositions are substantially free from boron and compounds of boron such as B2O3. Specifically, it has been determined that forming the glass composition with a relatively low amount of boron or compounds of boron (i.e., less than or equal to 1 mol. %) or without boron or compounds of boron significantly increases the chemical durability of the glass composition. In addition, it has also been determined that forming the glass composition with a relatively low amount of boron or compounds of boron or without boron or compounds of boron improves the ion exchangeability of the glass compositions by reducing the process time and/or temperature required to achieve a specific value of compressive stress and/or depth of layer. In some embodiments of the glass compositions described herein, the glass compositions are substantially free from phosphorous and compounds containing phosphorous including, without limitation, P2O5. Specifically, it has been determined that formulating the glass composition without phosphorous or compounds of phosphorous increases the chemical durability of the glass composition. In addition to the SiO2, Al2O3, alkali oxides and alkaline earth oxides, the glass compositions described herein may optionally further comprise one or more fining agents such as, for example, SnO2, As2O3, and/or Cl− (from NaCl or the like). When a fining agent is present in the glass composition, the fining agent may be present in an amount less than or equal to about 1 mol. % or even less than or equal to about 0.5 mol. %. For example, in some embodiments the glass composition may include SnO2 as a fining agent. In these embodiments SnO2 may be present in the glass composition in an amount greater than about 0 mol. % and less than or equal to about 0.30 mol. %. Moreover, the glass compositions described herein may comprise one or more additional metal oxides to further improve the chemical durability of the glass composition. For example, the glass composition may further include ZnO or ZrO2, each of which further improves the resistance of the glass composition to chemical attack. In these embodiments, the additional metal oxide may be present in an amount which is greater than or equal to about 0 mol. % and less than or equal to about 2.0 mol. %. For example, when the additional metal oxide is ZrO2, the ZrO2 may be present in an amount less than or equal to about 1.5 mol. %. Alternatively or additionally, the additional metal oxide may include ZnO in an amount less than or equal to about 2.0 mol. %. In some embodiments, ZnO may be included as a substitute for one or more of the alkaline earth oxides. For example, in embodiments where the glass composition includes the alkaline earth oxides MgO, CaO and SrO, the amount of MgO may be reduced to decrease the liquidus temperature and increase the liquidus viscosity, as described above. In these embodiments, ZnO may be added to the glass composition as a partial substitute for MgO, in addition to or in place of at least one of CaO or SrO.

The alkali metal oxide in the glass composition of this first exemplary embodiment may further comprise Li2O in an amount from about 1 mol. % to about 3 mol. %.

In a third exemplary embodiment, a glass article may be formed from the glass composition of exemplary embodiment one or exemplary embodiment two. In this third exemplary embodiment, the glass article may be ion exchange strengthened such that the glass article has a compressive stress greater than or equal to about 250 MPa and a depth of layer greater than or equal to about 15 μm. The glass article may also have a coefficient of thermal expansion less than or equal to 70×10−7K−1. In a fourth exemplary embodiment, a glass article may include a compressive stress layer with a compressive stress greater than or equal to about 250 MPa and depth of layer greater than or equal to about 15 μm.

The glass article may be formed from a glass composition which is free of boron and compounds of boron and free from phosphorous and compounds of phosphorous. In this fourth exemplary embodiment, the glass article may have a class S1 base resistance according to ISO 695. The glass article may also have least a class S3 acid resistance according to DIN 2116. The glass article of this fourth exemplary embodiment may be formed from a glass composition which includes from about 67 mol. % to about 75 mol. % SiO2; from about 6 mol. % to about 10 mol. % Al2O3; from about 5 mol. % to about 12 mol. % alkali oxide; and from about 8.0 mol. % to about 15 mol. % of alkaline earth oxide. The alkali oxide may include Na2O and K2O. The K2O may be present in an amount less than or equal to 0.5 mol. %. A ratio MgO:ΣRO in the glass composition is less than 0.3. In the embodiments described herein, the glass compositions generally have softening points of less than about 1040° C. or even less than about 950° C. In some embodiments, the softening point of the glass composition is less than about 900° C. These lower softening points improve the ease of formability of the glass composition. In some embodiments described herein, the glass compositions have a liquidus viscosity which is greater than or equal to 85 kP or even greater than or equal to about 90 kP. In some embodiments, the glass compositions have liquidus viscosities of greater than 150 kP or even greater than or equal to 200 kP. Such liquidus viscosities can be obtained by decreasing the concentration of MgO in the glass composition and increasing the concentration of one or more of CaO, SrO and ZnO in substitution. Glass compositions with liquidus viscosities as described above are generally suitable for forming 3-dimensional glass shapes, such as glass tubing. More specifically, in order to provide a glass composition which is readily formable into 3-dimensional shapes, the molten glass formed from the compositions should generally have a liquidus viscosity of greater than or equal to 90 kilopoise (kP). It has been determined that glass compositions with liquidus viscosities of greater than 90 kP can be obtained by controlling the ratio of MgO to the sum of the concentrations of the divalent cations (ΣRO). Divalent cations include the alkaline earth oxides (e.g., MgO, CaO, SrO, BaO), ZnO, and the like. Specifically, it has been determined that when MgO:ΣRO is less than 0.30, the glass compositions generally have a liquidus viscosity of greater than or equal to 90 kP, preferably greater than or equal to 100 kP or even greater than or equal to 115 kP. Accordingly, in some embodiments described herein, the ratio MgO:ΣRO is less than 0.3. In the embodiments described herein the glass compositions have a CTE of less than about 70×10−7K−1 or even less than about 60×10−7K−1. These lower CTE values improve the survivability of the glass to thermal cycling or thermal stress conditions relative to glass compositions with higher CTEs. As noted above, the presence of alkali oxides in the glass composition facilitates chemically strengthening the glass by ion exchange. By varying the concentration of alkali oxides in the glass, specifically the concentration of Na2O in the glass, a wide range of compressive stresses and depth of layer values are possible for various ion-exchange processing conditions. Glass articles formed from the glass compositions described herein may have compressive stresses greater than or equal to about 200 MPa or even 250 MPa following ion-exchange strengthening. For example, in some embodiments the compressive stress may be from about 200 MPa to about 850 MPa. In some other embodiments, the compressive stress may be from about 500 MPa to about 700 MPa. It should be understood that the phrase “compressive stress,” as used herein, refers to the compressive stress in the glass at the surface of the glass. The glass compositions described herein may be ion-exchange strengthened to achieve depth of layers greater than or equal to about 15 μm, such as from about 15 μM to about 50 μm. For example, in some embodiments, the depth of layer may be greater than or equal to about 25 μm and less than or equal to about 30 μm. The above referenced compressive stresses and depth of layers may be obtained in some glass compositions described herein after the glass composition is treated in a salt bath of 100% molten KNO3 at a temperatures from about 400° C. to about 500° C. for a time period of less than about 30 hours or even less than about 20 hours. As graphically illustrated in FIG. 1, the glass compositions described herein can be chemically strengthened by ion exchange. Exemplary depths of layer and the corresponding compressive stress are graphically depicted in FIG. 1. Also, for purposes of comparison, the depth of layer and compressive stress obtainable for Type 1B glass are also depicted. As shown in FIG. 1, the glass compositions described herein may be ion exchanged to achieve a much greater compressive stress and depth of layer than Type 1B glass. Further, as noted hereinabove, the glass compositions are chemically durable and resistant to degradation as determined by the DIN 12116 standard, the ISO 695 standard, and the ISO 720 standard. Specifically, the DIN 12116 standard is a measure of the resistance of the glass to decomposition when placed in an acidic solution. In brief, the DIN 12116 standard utilizes a polished glass sample of a known surface area which is weighed and then positioned in contact with a proportional amount of boiling 6M hydrochloric acid for 6 hours. The sample is then removed from the solution, dried and weighed again. The glass mass lost during exposure to the acidic solution is a measure of the acid durability of the sample with smaller numbers indicative of greater durability. The results of the test are reported in units of mass per surface area, specifically mg/dm2. The DIN 12116 standard is broken into individual classes. Class S1 indicates a half weight loss of up to 0.7 mg/dm2; Class S2 indicates a half weight loss from 0.7 mg/dm2 up to 1.5 mg/dm2; Class S3 indicates a half weight loss from 1.5 mg/dm2 up to 15 mg/dm2; and Class S4 indicates a half weight loss of more than 15 mg/dm2. The ISO 695 standard is a measure of the resistance of the glass to decomposition when placed in a basic solution. In brief, the ISO 695 standard utilizes a polished glass sample which is weighed and then placed in a solution of boiling 1M NaOH+0.5M Na2CO3 for 3 hours. The sample is then removed from the solution, dried and weighed again. The glass mass lost during exposure to the basic solution is a measure of the base durability of the sample with smaller numbers indicative of greater durability. As with the DIN 12116 standard, the results of the ISO 695 standard are reported in units of mass per surface area, specifically mg/dm2. The ISO 695 standard is broken into individual classes. Class A1 indicates weight losses of up to 75 mg/dm2; Class A2 indicates weight losses from 75 mg/dm2 up to 175 mg/dm2; and Class A3 indicates weight losses of more than 175 mg/dm2. The ISO 720 standard is a measure of the resistance of the glass to degradation in distilled water. In brief, the ISO 720 standard protocol utilizes crushed grass grains which are placed in contact with 18 MΩ water under autoclave conditions (121° C., 2 atm) for 30 minutes. The solution is then titrated colorimetrically with dilute HCl to neutral pH. The amount of HCL required to titrate to a neutral solution is then converted to an equivalent of Na2O extracted from the glass and reported in μg of glass with smaller values indicative of greater durability. The ISO 720 standard is broken into individual types. Type HGA1 is indicative of up to 62 μg extracted equivalent of Na2O; Type HGA2 is indicative of more than 62 μg and up to 527 μg extracted equivalent of Na2O; and Type HGA3 is indicative of more than 527 μg and up to 930 μg extracted equivalent of Na2O. The glass compositions described herein have an acid resistance of at least class S3 according to DIN 12116 with some embodiments having an acid resistance of at least class S2 or even class S1. Further, the glass compositions described herein have a base resistance according to ISO 695 of at least class A2 with some embodiments having a class A1 base resistance. The glass compositions described herein also have a ISO 720 type HGA2 hydrolytic resistance with some embodiments having a type HGA1 hydrolytic resistance. It should be understood that, when referring to the above referenced classifications according to DIN 12116, ISO 695 and ISO 720, a glass composition or glass article which has “at least” a specified classification means that the performance of the glass composition is as good as or better than the specified classification. For example, a glass article which has a DIN 12116 acid resistance of “at least class S2” may have a DIN 12116 classification of either S1 or S2. The glass compositions described herein are formed by mixing a batch of glass raw materials (e.g., powders of SiO2, Al2O3, alkali carbonates, alkaline earth carbonates and the like) such that the batch of glass raw materials has the desired composition. Thereafter, the batch of glass raw materials is heated to form a molten glass composition which is subsequently cooled and solidified to form the glass composition. During solidification (i.e., when the glass composition is plastically deformable) the glass composition may be shaped using standard forming techniques to shape the glass composition into a desired final form. Alternatively, the glass article may be shaped into a stock form, such as a sheet, tube or the like, and subsequently reheated and formed into the desired final form. The glass compositions described herein may be shaped into glass articles having various shape forms including, without limitation, sheets, tubes or the like, which can then be reshaped into other glass articles such as bottles, glass containers, etc. Given the chemical durability of the glass composition, the glass compositions described herein are particularly well suited for use in the formation of pharmaceutical packages for containing a pharmaceutical composition, such as liquids, powders and the like. For example, the glass compositions described herein may be used to form vials, ampoules, cartridges, syringe bodies and/or any other glass container for storing pharmaceutical compositions. Moreover, the ability to chemically strengthen the glass compositions through ion exchange can be utilized to improve the mechanical durability of such pharmaceutical packaging. Accordingly, it should be understood that, in at least one embodiment, the glass compositions are incorporated in a pharmaceutical package in order to improve the chemical durability and/or the mechanical durability of the pharmaceutical packaging. Examples The embodiments of glass compositions described herein will be further clarified by the following examples. Table 1 below contains the composition of Comparative Examples 1-3 and Inventive Examples A-D. The softening point, CTE, and chemical durability of each composition are also listed. Specifically, Comparative Examples 1-3 contained B2O3. Removing B2O3 from the glass composition to improve the chemical durability typically results in a corresponding undesirable increase in the softening point of the glass. In order to counteract this trend in the glass compositions listed in Table 1, B2O3 was replaced with alkali oxide, SiO2, ZrO2 or combinations thereof. The SiO2 and ZrO2 improve the chemical durability of the glass. Additions of alkali oxide lowered the softening point of the glass by as much as 80° C.

Specifically, the composition of inventive Examples E-J were used to assess the efficacy of further additions of alkali oxide (Na2O, K2O, Li2O) on chemical durability of the glass as well as ion exchange performance. As shown in Table 2, alkali oxide additions as high as 11.5 mol. % were examined, with slight increases in SiO2 content to maintain acid durability. The softening points of these glass compositions decreased to as low as 870° C. due to the increase in alkali oxide content. Moreover, neither the acid nor base resistances of these glass compositions were adversely impacted by the higher alkali level, with all glasses falling into either the S2 or S3 DIN 12116 classification and the A1 ISO 695 classification.

Specifically, samples of the glass compositions of inventive Examples E-J were ion exchanged in a molten salt bath of 100% KNO3 for 15 hours at temperatures of 430° C., 440° C., and 475° C. Thereafter, the surface compression and depth of layer were determined. In the examples discussed herein, the compressive stress and DOL values are measured values obtained with an FSM instrument, with the compressive stress value based on the measured stress optical coefficient (SOC). The chemical durability of the samples was also determined following ion exchange. The results are reported in Table 3 below. Table 3 shows that the ion exchangeability of the glass compositions is strongly dependent on the amount of alkali oxide in the composition. Compressive stress values of 200-350 MPa were reached in glass compositions with alkali oxide levels of 5 mol. % to 6 mol. %. Compressive stress values of 700-825 MPa were reached in glass compositions with alkali oxide levels of 8.5 mol. % to 11.5 mol. %. Example H had a compressive stress of 817 MPa with a depth of layer of 48 microns after ion exchange for 15 hours at 440° C., values which are comparable to commercially available ion-exchanged damage-tolerant glass. Table 3 also shows that ion exchange treatment has minimal effect on chemical durability with the exception of the acid durability of several of the glasses with higher compressive stress values. In these instances, the glass mass lost following testing increased by a factor of 20 to 200 compared to corresponding non-ion exchanged glass compositions. While not wishing to be bound by theory, this result may be more of a manifestation of chipping of the glass edge during testing due to high compressive stress rather than actual decreased chemical resistance from ion exchange.

While not wishing to be bound by theory, it is believe that the improvement in the hydrolytic resistance, base resistance, and acid resistance following ion-exchange strengthening of the glass substrate is due, at least in part, to the compressive stress imparted to the glass which is believed to limit the removal of ions from the glass network. As noted above, in some embodiments, maintaining the ratio MgO:ΣRO in the glass compositions to be less than 0.3 generally increases the liquidus viscosity of the glass composition to greater than about 90 kP which, in turn, improves the formability of the glass composition. Table 7 below includes several of the inventive glass compositions described above in which the ratio MgO:ΣRO is less than 0.3 and the corresponding liquidus viscosities. Composition FF included 72.3 mol. % SiO2, 7.1 mol. % Al2O3, 2 mol. % Li2O, 6.9 mol. % Na2O, 0.5 mol. % K2O, 2.6 mol. % MgO, 5.3 mol. % CaO, 3.3 mol. % SrO, and 0.3 mol. % SnO2. At high MgO levels (or more precisely, at high activity levels of MgO), the liquidus phase is forsterite (Mg2SiO4), a persistent phase that readily crystallizes at high temperature during cooling of the melt, resulting in low (<50 kP) liquidus viscosities. It has been found that forsterite formation can be delayed to lower temperature/higher liquidus viscosity if MgO activity is minimized. It has also been found that MgO activity can be minimized by maintaining the MgO:ΣRO ratio to <0.30.
