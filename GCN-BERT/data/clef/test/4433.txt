8.01019 v PREPARATION OF AZ0 COMPOUNDS This invention relates to a process for producing azo compounds and more particularly azo compounds corresponding te the formula X X I I (I) R-C-N= -C-R I I R' R' wherein R is a hydrocarbon radical including both aliphatic and cyclic as well as alkoxyhydrocarbon, R' is an alkyl group containing 1-6 carbon atoms with R and R' together in some instances forming a cyclic radical, and X is a nitrile, carboxylase or a carboxylic ester group. The compounds of the above structure are useful as blowing agents for making sponge rubber through %ho evolution of nitrogen. These same compounds are also useful as polymerization catalysts as described in Hunt, U.S. patent 2,471,959, patented May 31, 19 9. Those compounds where X te a nit-rile group, R' is methyl and R is an alkyl group are particularly useful for these purposes. An economical preparation of azo compounds of the type concerned with in this invention has been %ho subject of investiga%ion by various manufactures. One of %ho common industrial methods of preparing the azo compounds employs hydrazine ass a raw material. An example of such a preparation i8 described by Cox in J. Am. Chem. Soc. 7, 1471-1477, 1925. This material is relatively expensive and consequently was a manor factor in the cost er %ho azo product. I1 tas subsequently discovered that the use of hydrazine could be oirewaven%ed by employing a eyanehydrin intermediate and mnenlatlnd If te form an alpha-amlnemltrile as a further in%ermedla%e. The alpha-amlnoni%rile le subsequently oxidized wlth an alkali or alkaline earth metal hypochlorite te form the .desired azo and product. The previously described procedure is outlined Ini U.S. 2,711 05 wherein the patentee states that a condition of the oxidation stop is that if mus% be carried out at a temperature below fO°C. A temperature restriction is also described in U.S. 2,?13,576 wherein the temperature te at all times held at1SOC or below. In addition fo the temperature restrictions during the coupling of the nitrogen atoms to form the azo moiety, another limitation of the previously described prior art process is in the use of a cyanohydrin as an intermediate. The annulation of a cyanohydrin often results in the formation of ammonium hydroxide as well as the desired alphaaminonitrile intermediate, Consequently the alpha-aminonltr!le must be separated from the reaction mixture containing the ammonium hydroxide before oxidation with the alkali or alkaline earth hypohalîte if a commercially acceptable process is to be effected. If will thus be apparent that in following the prior art process outlines above a multÆ-step procedure is nécessiter along with low temperature restrictions during the oxidation step Æn order to commercially produce the desired azo oo pounds. If is therefore an object of this invention to provide an improved process for preparing azo compounds. It is also an object of his invention to provide a commercial process for preparing azo compounds which employs relatively inexpensive starting materials. If is a further object of the present invention to provìde a commercial process for preparing polymerilatien azo catalysts which has a minimum number of steps during the synthesis and does not require the sustenance of low temperature during the formation of the ame melody. The foregoing and other et)Jeots and advantages are aocompltshed in accordance wi h he following outlined syntheœeis which particularly illustrates the use of the hi,rile derivative in the second oxidation steps ï,, (i) R R I t CN C-O + NH4 CN C ÇNH R' + H2 0 (2) R CN ON j ON I 2C < + 2NaOCl R-O-N=N.,C-R + NaCl + H2 0 R-I" NXll j R' R' In %ho above described synthesis R and R0 are previously described in general formula I° The nitriles are the preferred azo compounds° They are the mes% active polymerization catalysts and involve the least number of steps in synthesizing. However, 1o form the azo compounds wherein X is carboxylase or a oarbexyllc ester, the a ineni z, ile may be hydrolyzed in a conventional manner te the acid form prier te exlda%len by the hypehall%e. The acid tan be further treated with lower alipha%io menohydric alcohols te produce he es%er. During %he oxidation of the amineni rile with the alkali metal er alkaline earth metal hypohalite, the earboxyl!e group formed therefrom will be used in the sait form because of the free bSOïe present with the hypehallte in 1; e reaction mixture. The sali will preferably be formed frein the:alkallne and alkaline earth metals. Inaccerdanee with oneoembediment of this invention, the desired azo nitrile can be fe ed-i om he heFetn described keener and ammonium cyanide.

In et%hot event, %he hydrogen cyanide is added slowly %0 %ho ammonia solution. Upon forma%ton of %ho ammonium cyanide, %ho desired ketone is slowly added %here%or and %he temperature should be about10°C. The ketone, like %he ammonia and %he hydrogen cyanide is employed in an equimolar amount. During %he reaction of %he ketone with %he ammonium cyanide %he CorTespondingalpha-aminoni%rile is formed as well as water. With %he nitrile thus formed in an aqueous solution %he amlnoni%rile product is in an ideal state for oxlda%ion by %ho hypohali%e which advantageously is an aqueous solution as will ho apparent in %he following descrlp%ion.

The invention is disclosed in further detail by means of the following examples which are set further fer the purpose of • . i!i ...... ............ - :::.... ' . illustrating the invention, but, in no way, are to be construed as limiting the invention in spirit or scope, Example i illustrates the formation of alpha-aminolsobutyronitrile following the general procedure outlined above for producing the nitrîle intermediate directly from a ketone without the formation of an undesired side reaction product. EXAMPLE I Aqueous ammonia in an amount of 117.6 g (1.794 m) containing 25,9% ammonia is placed in a 250 ml flask equipped wl%h a stirrers thermometer, dropping funnel and dry toe condenser. The ammonia solution is cooled te IO°C and 54 g (2.0 m) of liquid hydrogen cyanide is slowly added with stirring over a 8-10 minute period while maintaining the temperature ai 8-I0 °C, Into the dropping funnel is placed 116 g (2.0 m) of aoetone and the acetone is added te the aqueous ammonia Solution in the flask in a slow stream while holding the reaction temperature between 8-i0°C. About 20 minutes is required te complete the acetone addltlon.- Af%er all %ho acetone is added %ho cooling bath is rsmoved During the subsequent next heur the solution temperature rises gradually from lOeC te 35eC before falling back 1o room temperature. The reaction mixture is stirred overnight for a total of 19 hours. During thls period the solution color %urns from yellow-orange te deep red-brown. Approximately 286 g of liquid assaying 51.5%w/ alpah-aminoisobu%yroni%rile, confirmed by infrared and titration methods, results. The produot yield based on %ho ammonia is 97.7%. The material te sui%able for use directly in the preparing of azobleebu%yroni%rile as illustrated in Examples II-V. The ke%ones used as starting materials correspond te %ho formula (il) o il., R-C K wherein R fs hydrocarbon and alkoxyhydrocarbon and R' is lower alkyl and as described in Formula I, R and R' can form a cyclic radical. They are well known materials. In accordance with the procedure outlined in Example I the described ketones can be converted te the corresponding nitrile. For example t alpha-aminc-alpha-methyl-gamma-methylvaleronitrile can be prepared from 2-methyl-4-pentanone! alphaaminocyclohexane-carbonitrîle from cyclohexanone ! alphaamino-alpha-me thyl-gamma-me%hyl-gamma-me %hoxyvaleroni%rìle from 2-me%hoxy-2-me%hyl- -pentanone ! alpha-amlnc-alpha-phenylpropioni- %file from phenylme%hyl ketone! alpha-amino-alpha-methylbu%yTen. ç i%rile from diethyl ketone! alpha-amino-alpha-cyclopropylpropionl- %Tile from me%hylcyolopropyl ke%onel alpha-amlno-alpha-cyclohexylpropioni%Tile from methylcyclohexyl ketone! alpha-aminoalpha-cycloheptylpropioni%rile from methylcyclohep%yl ketone ! alpha-amino-alpha-isopropyl-beta-methylbutyroni%rile from dlisopropyl ke%one! alpha-amino-alpha mma-dime%hylcaproni%rile from Ç-me%hyl-2-hexanone ! alpha-amino-alpha-n-bu%ylcapronl%rile from di-n-bu%yl ks%one ! alpha-amino-alpha-isobu%yl-ga ma-me%hylvaleroni%rile from 2,5-dimethyl- -hep%anone ! and alpha-aminocycloheptanecaFboni%Tile f a cyolehep%anone. As described previously in a general manner, %ho acids and es%ets of %he azo compounds can in %urn be formed from %he oorTesponding ni%Tiles. For instance, alpha-aminoisobu%yTio acid is produced by complete hydrolysis of the alpha-amlnolsobu%yr - hi%Tile. To form %he methyl and ethyl esters of %he alpha amino isobu%yric acid, %ho acid is merely reacted with methanol and ethanol respectively in a well known manner. Other acids and lower alkyl esters containing 1-6 carbon atoms can be formed in a 8 0 íl 0 1 9 similar manner. Examples II-V illustrate the conversion of the alphaaminonitrile compound to the ate bondage. Into a one liter beaker is placed 465 cc of an aqueous sodium hypochlorite solution containing 0.124 mole of the o hypochlorite. The dilute solution has a temperature of 20 C by virtue of it being at room temperature. Th hypochlorite concentration is about 0.267 mole/liter and %ho solution has a pH of about 10.6. To the hypochlorite solution is added as rapidly as possible 11.6 g (0.0711 m) of the crude alphaaminolsobu%yronltrile prepared in Example I in 51.5% w/w aqueous solution. This corresponds te a 74.4 molecular excess of the hypochlorite. The resulting solution is stirred vigorously for three minutes while holding the temperature ai20°C by means of ice addition. A precipitate forms which is filtered on a Buchner filterï washed thoroughly with tarer and dried in air. The product, alpha, alphaï-az0 bisls0 butyr0 nitri1 e melts ai i02 -103 °C 71eldlng 4.5 g for a 77.2% yield. The following Example illustrates the hypoohlorlte oxidation of the nitrile without the use of any cooling. EXAMPLE III The procedure outlined in Example II is employed utilizing 500 ml of an aqueous solution containing 0.1503 mole of sodium hypochlorite and I0 a of a 58% w/w aqueous solution of the alpha-amlnoisobutyr nitrils (0.060 mole). This is a 120% molecular excess of the hydrochloride. A pH of I0.0 is maintained by means of addition of dilute }{CI solution. The temperature of o the reaotlon mixture is 20 C a% the oe%s %. The entire reaction is oarrled out in three minutes and ai the end of the %h minute period the temperature rises te29°C. A yield of 3.9 0 19 grams of the desired alpha,alpha'-azobislsobutyronitrile is obtained giving a yield of 69.0%. In the following Examples IV and V the alpha-amlnoisobutyronitrile was formed from the well known reaction of acetone, sodium cyanide and ammonium sulfate rather than the procedure outlined in • Example I. It is readily apparent that nitriles formed in accordance with the procedures of Example I can likewise be employed without isolation from the reaction products as is necessary when ammonium sulfate and sodium cyanide are used. E LE IV The same procedure outlined in Example Il is followed employing 430 ce of an aqueous sodium hypochlorite solution containing 0.1503 racle of the hypochlorite and i0 grams of the crude alphaaminoisobu%yTonitrile (0.07 9 mole) in the form of a 62% wfw aqueous solution. A I03,6% molecular excess of the hydrochloride is thereby employed. The pH of the solution is 12.34 adjusted by addition of 70 ml of 1% sodium hydroxide solution te the o hypochlorite solution. A 20 C temperature of the reaction mixture is maintained throughout the reaction which is conducted over a period of three minutes. The desired product alpha,alpha'- azoblsisobutyronîtrile is recovered in a yield of 74.4% weighing 4.5 grams. v The procedure outlined in Example II is' followed exeept %ha% the total volume of aqueous sodium hypochleri%e solution is 6,000 ce containing 1.503 mole of the hypoohlori%e and 100 n of a 62% w/w aqueous solution of alpha-aminolsobutyronltrile (0.739 racle). This is a i03 % molecular excess of the hypochlorite. o The reaction is carried out at a temperature of 35 C for one minute yield of 59 of the alpha,alpha' -azobisisobu%yroni%Tîle is obtained weighing 36 grams end assayÆng 99.5%. 801 019 In accordance with the procedure described in Examples II-V other alpha-amlno compounds, whether formed from ketones by the procedures previously described or by other means, can be directly oxidized to the corresponding azo compounds. For example, alpha-amino-alpha-methyl-gamma-me%hylvaleronîtrile can be converted to alpha,alpha'-azobls (alpha,gamma-dÆmethylvaleronitrîle)! alpha-amlno-methylîsobutyrãte to dimethyl alphapalpha'-azodlîso bu%yrate! alpha-aminocyclohexaneoarbonitrile fo lçl'azodicyclohexanecarboni%rile alpha-amlno-alpha-me%hyl-gamma-me%hyl-gammamethoxyvaleroni%rile to alphas-alpha' -azobls (alpha, ga_mma-dime%hylgamma-me%hoxyvaleronltrile) ! alpha-amino-alpha-phenylpropioni%rile fo alpha, alphas-azobls (alpha°phenylpropîonitrile)i alpha-aminoãlpha-methylbu%yronì%rile fo alphanumeric-azobÆs (alpha-me%hylbu%yToni%rile) ! alpha-amino-alpha-ethylbutyroni%Tile fo alpha, alphas-azobls (alpha-ethylbutyroni%rile) ! alpha-amino-alphacyolopropylprop!oni%rile %o alpha,alphaï-azobis (alpha-oy¢lopropylproploni%rile) ! alpha-amino-alpha-@ycl@hexylpr@pioni%Tile fo a1 pha,a1 phaaz0 bis (alpha-cyclohexylproplcni%rile), alphaamino-alpha-cyolohep%ylpropionî%rîle) ! alpha-amlno-alpha-lsopropyl-be%a-me%hylbu%y:ìoni%rile %0 alpha.alpha'-azcbls (alphaisopropyl-be%a-me%hylbutyroni%ril • ) ! alpha-amino-alpha, gammadime%hylcapronltrile %0 alpha, alpha]-aZobis (alpha, ga,,ea-dlme%hylcaproni%rile) ! alpha-amino-alpha-n-bu%ylcapronl%rile fo alpha, alpha -azobi s (alpha-ne-bu%ylcapronltrile) ! alpha-amlno-alphaisobu%ylm na-me%hylvaleronÆ%l'ile %0 alpha,alpha]-azobls (alphais@bu%yl-6 nma-me %hylvalsr@ni%rils ) ! alpha-aminocyolohsp%ane- @arbon!%rile %o l,l'-asodlcyelohep%anecarboni%rÆle ! alpha-aminoisobu%yrlc acid %0 alpha,alpha'--azodiÆsobu%yTic acid! and ethyl alpha-aminoisobu%yra%e fo diethyl alphabétisme-aïodiisobu%yra%e. Sodium hypochlori%e is %he preferred alkali hypohali%e in carrying ou% %he oxidation of %he alpha-amlno compounds a% a temperature of20°C or above. Any alkali metal or alkaline earth metal hypohalite can be employed but the hypochlorites are preferred. Sodium, potassium, calcium as well as lithium, strontium and barium are representative of %ho alkali and alkaline earth hypohalites. It is readily apparent that the hypohalite can be formed if desired in %ho reaction vessel prior to %ho introduction of the alpha-amino compound by %ho interaction of an alkali or alkali metal hydroxide with the desired halite ion. In %ho instance of the present invention one can control the pH of the reaction mixture more easily during the oxidation of %ho alpha-amino derivative by means of %ho hydroxide but caution mus% be taken not to have a substantial excess of such hydroxide. As shown in Example II a hypochlorite concentration of 0.267 mole/ liter has a pH of about 10.6. No excess caustic is employed whereas in example IV a slight amount of sodium hydroxide te used te adjust the pH. As previously indicated, no excess caustic other than 1o adjust the pH within %ho prescribed limits of 10-13 should be used. Hypohalites readily decompose when heavy metals such as iron and copper are present. The present synthesis is therefore best carried oui in %ho absence of these metals by employing a metallic free reaction vessel as well as reagents and solvents free of heavy metals. If will thus be seen that through the present invention there is provided a commercially feasible process for producing ate compounds involving a mlnlmumnumber of steps and isolation procedures. The process employs relatively inexpensive starting materials and does net require low temperatures during the oxÆdatlon of the amino compounds when employing the procedures described herein. Others may readily adapt the invention for use under various conditions of service by employing one or more of the novel features disclosed or equivalente thereof. All such which do net depart from the spirit of this disclosure are intended te he within ifs scope, which a% present advised is best defined in the appended claims.
