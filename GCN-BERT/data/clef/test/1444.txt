In another particular embodiment, the composition comprises at least 500 of the discrete particles, and the difference in the specific gravity of the thermosetting polymer composition and the specific gravity of the thermoplastic composition is at least 0.13 g/cm3. DETAILED DESCRIPTION Golf ball compositions of the present invention are heterogeneous compositions comprising discrete unmelted thermoplastic particles dispersed within a thermosetting polymer matrix. The thermoplastic particle composition has a melting point above the curing temperature of the matrix composition such that the particles do not melt upon formation of the golf ball component formed from the heterogeneous composition. In a particular embodiment, the difference in the specific gravity of the matrix composition and the specific gravity of the particle composition is at least 0.10 g/cm3, or at least 0.11 g/cm3, or at least 0.12 g/cm3, or at least 0.13 g/cm3, or at least 0.14 g/cm3, or at least 0.15 g/cm3, or at least 0.16 g/cm3, or at least 0.17 g/cm3, or at least 0.18 g/cm3, or at least 0.19 g/cm3, or at least 0.20 g/cm3. The heterogeneous composition is formed by adding the particles to the matrix composition either prior to forming the golf ball layer or during the process of molding or casting the golf ball layer. In a particular embodiment, the heterogeneous composition has a solid sphere coefficient of restitution, “COR,” within a range having a lower limit of 0.450 or 0.500 or 0.550 or 0.600 or 0.650 or 0.700 and an upper limit of 0.710 or 0.730 or 0.750 or 0.770 or 0.800 or 0.820 or 0.850 or 0.870 or 0.900 or 0.910 or 0.950. For purposes of the present disclosure, the “solid sphere COR” of a composition refers to the COR of a cured 1.55 inch diameter sphere of the composition. COR is determined according to a known procedure wherein a sphere is fired from an air cannon at two given velocities and calculated at a velocity of 125 ft/s. Ballistic light screens are located between the air cannon and the steel plate at a fixed distance to measure sphere velocity. As the sphere travels toward the steel plate, it activates each light screen, and the time at each light screen is measured. This provides an incoming transit time period inversely proportional to the sphere's incoming velocity. The sphere impacts the steel plate and rebounds though the light screens, which again measures the time period required to transit between the light screens. This provides an outgoing transit time period inversely proportional to the sphere's outgoing velocity. COR is then calculated as the ratio of the outgoing transit time period to the incoming transit time period, COR=Vout/Vin=Tin/Tout. In a particular embodiment, the heterogeneous composition has a solid sphere compression within a range having a lower limit of −75 or −50 or −20 or 0 or 10 or 15 and an upper limit of 20 or 25 or 30 or 35 or 40 or 50. In another particular embodiment, the heterogeneous composition has a solid sphere compression within a range having a lower limit of 70 or 75 or 80 or 85 or 90 and an upper limit of 90 or 95 or 100 or 105 or 115 or 120 or 125. In another particular embodiment, the heterogeneous composition has a solid sphere compression within a range having a lower limit of 120 or 130 or 140 or 150 or 155 or 160 and an upper limit of 160 or 165 or 170 or 180 or 190 or 200. In another particular embodiment, the heterogeneous composition has a solid sphere compression of 130 or greater, or 140 or greater, or 150 or greater, or 155 or greater, or 160 or greater, or 165 or greater, or 170 or greater. For purposes of the present disclosure, the “solid sphere compression” of a composition refers to the compression of a cured 1.55 inch diameter sphere of the composition. The compression of the sphere is determined according to a known procedure, using a digital Atti compression test device, wherein a piston is used to compress a ball against a spring. Conversion from Atti compression to Riehle (cores), Riehle (balls), 100 kg deflection, 130-10 kg deflection or effective modulus can be carried out according to the formulas given in Jeff Dalton's Compression by Any Other Name, Science and Golf IV, Proceedings of the World Scientific Congress of Golf (Eric Thain ed., Routledge, 2002). In a particular embodiment, the heterogeneous composition has a flexural modulus, as measured according to the method given in the Examples below, of 5 ksi or greater, 6 ksi or greater, or 8 ksi or greater, or 10 ksi or greater, or 15 ksi or greater, or 20 ksi or greater, or 25 ksi or greater, or 30 ksi or greater, or 35 ksi or greater, or 40 ksi or greater, or 45 ksi or greater, or 48 ksi or greater, or 50 ksi or greater, or 52 ksi or greater, or 55 ksi or greater, or 60 ksi or greater, or 63 ksi or greater, or 65 ksi or greater, or 70 ksi or greater, 100 ksi or greater, or 120 ksi or greater, or 150 ksi or greater, or 160 ksi or greater, or 170 ksi or greater, or 180 ksi or greater, or 195 ksi or greater, or a flexural modulus within a range having a lower limit of 5 or 6 or 8 or 10 or 15 or 20 or 25 or 30 or 35 or 40 or 45 or 48 or 50 or 52 or 55 or 55 or 60 or 63 or 65 or 70 ksi and an upper limit of 75 or 80 or 85 or 90 or 95 or 100 or 105 or 110 or 115 ksi, or a flexural modulus within a range having a lower limit of 20 or 25 or 30 or 35 or 40 or 45 or 50 or 55 or 60 ksi and an upper limit of 60 or 65 or 70 or 75 or 80 ksi, or a flexural modulus within a range having a lower limit of 50 or 60 or 70 or 90 or 120 or 130 and an upper limit of 150 or 170 or 200 or 210.
