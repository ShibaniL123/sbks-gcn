Step 6: tert-butyl 4-{{4-[(3-chloro-4-fluorophenyl)(3,4-dimethoxybenzyl)amino]-7-methoxyquinazolin-6-yl}amino}piperidine-1-carboxylate
A solution of N4-(3-chloro-4-fluorophenyl)-N4-(3,4-dimethoxybenzyl)-7-methoxyquinazoline-4,6-diamine (469 mg, 1.0mmol) and tert-butyl 4-oxopiperidine-1-carboxylate (239 mg, 1.2 mmol) in acetic acid (10 mL) was stirred at room temperature for 2 hours, and then sodium triacetoxyborohydride (254 mg, 1.2 mmol) was added thereto in one portion. After reacting for half an hour, the reaction was quenched by slowly adding water, and extracted with ethyl acetate. The resulting organic phase was washed sequentially with water, 5% NaHCO3 aqueous solution and saturated brine, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was separated through silica gel column chromatography to afford the title compound (404 mg, 62%).
