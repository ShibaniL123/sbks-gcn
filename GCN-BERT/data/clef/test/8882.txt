BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The invention is directed to cationic fluorinated alcohols, compositions containing the same, and methods for treating surfaces such as hair and skin. 2. Description of Related Art Hair conditioning refers to the process of imparting attributes such as smoothness, softness, and ease of styling to hair. Conditioning may also reduce a feeling of dryness and impart shine. Both damaged and normal hair require conditioning, however, there is a greater need of conditioning for damaged hair due to the negative attributes it imparts. There is no single sensory attribute that equates with the perception of damage, rather it is associated with a combination of tactile and visual properties. For example, damaged hair in general is more hydrophilic leaving it susceptible to moisture flux which increases its propensity for swelling and breakage leading to a rough texture. Additionally, damaged hair tends to have a duller appearance due to the scattering of light from its rough, non-uniform surface. Hair damage may be caused by environmental factors, such as chemical attack from bleaches, dyes and pollutants, photodamage from the sun, heat damage from a dryer or flat iron, or mechanical damage from styling. However, a perception of damage may also arise when hair has not been subject to these environmental factors, but from the hair being coarse or varied in lipid content and specific lipid composition. Improving upon benefits such as hydrophobicity, shine and tactile properties leads to the perception of healthier, more conditioned hair. Among the best known hair conditioners are long chain quaternary ammonium compounds and fatty alcohols which have been used extensively in the prior art. The positively charged ammonium moiety of long chain quaternary ammonium compounds is attracted to the negatively charged surfaces of the keratin fibers, while the long chain portions of these molecules form a coating on the hair to create a perception of smoothness and increase the manageability of the hair. Silicones are also widely used in hair conditioner products. These products likewise form a coating on the hair shaft, and may be provided with an amino functionality or other chemical functionality to impart charge. Silicones are frequently copolymerized and co-formulated with other polymers to provide a product having a combination of attributes. The principle sensory drawback associated with all of the prior art conditioners is that the hair tends to feel coated and heavy, driving the consumer to wash and re-style their hair more frequently, leading to further damage. In addition to silicones, the oleophilic portions of fatty alcohols and higher molecular weight quatenary compounds may cause hair to feel oily. Additionally, the majority of compounds used to provide shine properties to hair are typically oils and silicones, leading to a somewhat undesirable tactile perception over time. Thus, there is an unmet need in the art for robust conditioning compositions that can be used to condition hair that is perceived as being damaged, without the sensory drawbacks associated with the prior art compositions. Cationic molecules have been used extensively for various applications including hair and skin conditioning, surface modification, as wetting agents, and industrial surfactants. Fluorinated compounds have also been used in cosmetic formulations. For example, GB Application No. 1 598 567 discloses fluorinated surfactants such as Zonyl® used in combination with silicones in a hair conditioner in an effort to render the conditioner more grease resistant, i.e., less oily. U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,763,240 and 7,785,575 (which are assigned to the assignee herein) describe fluorinated compounds useful in hair care products to control moisture penetration into the hair (frizz control). Compositions containing these compounds resist dirt, avoid a feeling of greasiness or oiliness in the hair and leave a low amount of residue (i.e., are “weightless”). It has now been discovered that certain cationic fluorinated alcohols, which can be synthesized by the reaction of a fluorinated epoxide and a tertiary amine, have novel and beneficial effects when applied to hair. These compounds have improved deposition properties, so that they impart an improved feel to damaged, dry and coarse hair, without the sensory drawbacks associated with the prior art. More specifically, certain inventive compounds described herein have demonstrated significant deposit from rinse out formulations, leading to positive attributes such as increasing the contact angle of damaged hair, imparting shine which lasts through shampoo cycles, and reducing friction on damaged ends. In embodiments, the compounds and compositions described herein are capable of modifying or treating surfaces including skin, hair, fabrics, solids, and may be employed as surfactants and/or surface modifying agents for improving chemical reactions. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In one aspect, the invention is a class of novel fluorinated cationic alcohols according to the following formula (I), including cosmetically acceptable salts thereof: wherein, X1 is O or —(CH2)m— (m being an integer between 1 and 20); R11, R12 and R13 are independently C1-6 alkyl or C1-6 hydroxyalkyl; and n is an integer from 1 to 20. These compounds are non-perfluorinated, preferably having a terminal CHF2 group, and thus may be readily distinguished from the perfluorinated surfactants used in the prior art for a variety of purposes. Alternatively, X1 is the residue of a hydroxy-reactive linker used in the synthesis, such as a poly glycol (e.g., polypropylene glycol (PPG) or polyethylene glycol (PEG)). In the case of PEG used as a starting material, X1 is —(CH2—CH2—O)p— (wherein p is an integer from 1 to 10,000, depending on the molecular weight of the PEG starting material).

Additional information about the reaction to form cationic alcohols according to the invention may be found in Zeno W. Wicks, et al., Organic Coatings: Science and Technology, John Wiley (1999), p 278, incorporated by reference. Synthetic Example 1 A cationic fluorinated alcohol according to the invention, (Example 1 in Table 1 below) was made according to the following reaction scheme: To 1 equivalent (0.308 g, 3.042 mmol) of triethylamine in a 7 ml scintillation vial with stirbar, 1 equivalent (0.174 ml) of glacial acetic acid was added and mixed well. 0.28 ml of de-ionized water was added so that the amine was dissolved or well dispersed. 1.01 equivalents (1.5 g, 3.073 mmol) of Glycidyl 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6,7,7,8,8,9,9-hexadecafluorononyl ether were added and the mixture was uniformly stirred at high speed at 95° C. The fluorinated epoxide separated into a different layer. After about 4 to 6 hours, the two layers became homogeneous indicating that the reaction was near completion. The mixture was stirred continuously overnight (about 16 hours). At the end of the reaction, a uniform clear solution was obtained. The water was removed under vacuum and the viscous product was re-dissolved 2-3 times in absolute ethanol to remove any remaining water. The mixture was purified by repeated precipitation (about 3-5 times) from diethyl ether with hexane. Once the last wash, hexane was added to the material to form a slurry. The excess hexane was decanted off and the gel-like material is dried under vacuum overnight, to yield a beige wax. 1H NMR was performed on a Varian Mercury 300 MHz spectrometer. Mass Spectrometry was conducted using a Thermo Finnigan LCQdeca mass spectrometer. 1H NMR δ (CD3OD, 300 MHz): 1.31 (t, 3H, —CH2CH3), 1.92 (t, 3H, CH3COO−), 3.49 (m, 8H, N+(CH2)4), 3.71 (t, 2H, —OCH2CF2—), 4.18 (m, 2H, —CH(OH)CH2O—), 4.27 (m, 1H, —CH(OH)CH2O—), 6.70 (t, 1H, —CF2CHF2). (+)-ESIMS 590.18 [M+]. In an alternative synthesis, hydrochloric acid was used instead of glacial acetic acid: 5.0 ml of water was added to 1.05 equivalent (1.48 g, 10.754 mmol) of triethylamine hydrochloride in a 20 ml scintillation vial with stirbar to dissolve the salt completely and was mixed well. A clear solution was obtained. 1.0 equivalent (5.0 g, 10.242 mmol) of Glycidyl 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6,7,7,8,8,9,9-hexadecafluorononyl ether (HDFE) was added. The HDFE separated into a different layer at the bottom of the vial. The mixture was uniformly stirred at high speed at 95° C. After about 2 hours, the 2 layers became homogeneous and clear indicating that the reaction was near completion. The solution was colorless to pale yellow. The mixture was left stirring overnight for a total of about 16 hours. Acetone was added to the solution and the water was removed under vacuum. This step was repeated 3 times to ensure that most of the water was removed. The product was warmed and dissolved in a minimal volume of diethyl ether. Cold hexane was added dropwise and the vial was cooled in an ice bath. The solid precipitated from the solution. The solvents were removed by decantation. This precipitation step was repeated 3 times until a clear gel-like material was obtained. The product was dried under vacuum to yield a white wax.

To 1 equivalent (41.6 g, 222.3 mmol) of TEMED-HCl salt prepared in step 1, 100 ml of water was added and mixed until a clear solution was obtained. 2.2 equivalents (92.0 g, 489 mmol) of glycidyl 2,2,3,3-tetrafluoropropyl ether was added dropwise using a dropping funnel over a period of 2 hours. The mixture was uniformly stirred at high speed at 95° C. and left stirring for a total of 16 h until a clear homogeneous solution was obtained. The solution was then washed with dichloromethane three times and the aqueous solution was evaporated to dryness under vacuum. The oily residue was then stripped from acetone and evaporated to dryness. The final obtained waxy residue was dried in a vacuum oven at a temperature of 50° C. overnight to give a white powder. The purity of the crystalline final product was analyzed by HPLC and gave a result of 98.1%. The final obtained yield was 75.3 g (60%) of a white crystalline solid. 1H NMR (300 MHz, D2O, 25° C.): δ 3.35 (dd, 12H); 3.60 (m, 4H), 3.72 (d, 4H); 4.10) (m, 8H); 4.45 (m, 2H); 6.25 (tt, 2H).

The fluoro epoxide separated into a different layer at the bottom of the vial. The mixture was uniformly stirred at high speed at 95° C. The cloudy mixture was left stirring overnight. At the end of 16 hours, a homogeneous, clear solution was obtained. The aqueous solution was washed with dichloromethane to remove impurities.

The concentration of the hair waving/hair straightening agent in the final hair care composition may be in a range from about 0.001% to about 20% by weight. Absorbents Certain hair care compositions of the present invention include absorbents. In certain embodiments, the inventive hair care composition with an absorbent is a dry shampoo. Absorbents are typically ingredients with a large surface area which can attract other materials such as lipids. The concentration of the absorbent in the final composition may range from about 1% to about 50% by weight of the cosmetic composition. The methods of treating hair according to the invention require only that the hair be contacted with the composition, and the methods may be the same as, or combined with, conventional methods for hair treatment. For example, and not by way of limitation, the method may include a step of shampooing the hair followed by rinsing, a step of conditioning the hair followed by rinsing, a step of spraying the hair to provide set or other cosmetic advantage, not immediately followed by rinsing, or a step of working a lotion into the hair, not immediately followed by rinsing. In embodiments, a method according to the invention involves a treatment of the hair after a bleaching or dying operation. Other possibilities for providing improved feel and hydrophobicity to hair, in different hair care contexts, would be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art. The compositions are often aqueous. Water, or a mixture of water and a lower alcohol, may be present in an amount of about 50 percent by weight to about 99 percent by weight.

Repeated applications with the compositions according to the invention yield increased deposition of the active compound on hair. Feel Test In order to test the performance of a shampoo and conditioner prepared according to the invention against a prior art formulation, shampoo and conditioner compositions were prepared based on Formulation Examples 2 and 3 above, using 2 wt % the compound of Example 2 above. This was tested against a leading commercial “damage repair” shampoo and conditioner: Plain bleached hair was used as an internal control. To prepare the samples for the feel test, 6 g of virgin medium brown hair was bleached using: 30 g of ultra concentrated bleach powder (Clairol) well mixed with 70 ml of 40V Hydrogen peroxide solution (Pure White, Clairol). The paste was manually worked into the hair fibers to saturate the samples. The samples were sandwiched in aluminum sheets and placed in an oven at 50° C. for 30 minutes for “level 1” damage. A 7.5% solution of sodium lauryl sulfate solution was used to shampoo the tresses and they were blow-dried for a few minutes and allowed to air-dry at room temperature for at least 2 hours. For “level 2” damage, the tress was bleached a second time following the same procedure, but for only 20 minutes and at room temperature. For “level 3” damage, the level 1 damaged tress is bleached using the same amounts as before, but for 20 minutes at 50° C. in an oven. The protocol for shampooing and conditioning was as follows: The hair was wetted for 10 seconds. 350 mg of shampoo was applied to 1.5 g of hair. The hair was lathered for 30 seconds and rinsed for another 30 seconds. The tress was blotted between paper towels and 350 mg of the conditioner was applied to the hair. The conditioner was worked through the hair for 30 seconds, followed by rinsing for another 30 seconds. The tress was then blotted dry and blow-dried straight if necessary. For each feel test, the respective virgin hair is used as the control. The first tress is evaluated with respect to the control and assessed in attributes such as softness, smoothness, and oil residue/grease. Each attribute is rated with respect to the control as shown in Table 2. Between the evaluation of each tress, hands are washed and dried. TABLE 2 Positive Rating for Attribute Negative Rating for Attribute 0 Feels like virgin −1 Slightly worse than hair the control +1 Slightly better, −2 Noticeably not as Barely noticeable good as the control +2 Noticeably better −3 Undesirable +3 Exceptionally better As shown in FIG. 1 through FIG. 6, the scores for each attribute at each level of damage were plotted, as were the scores for combined attributes. The compositions according to the invention showed a better feel performance at every level of damage compared to the prior art. As shown in FIG. 7, the compositions according to the invention show an improvement in feel scores as the level of damage increases. Contact Angle Measurements As described previously, improving upon benefits such as hydrophobicity, shine and tactile properties leads to the perception of healthier, more conditioned hair. Contact angle measurement has proven to be a viable method to measure the degree of hydrophobicity of hair. In principle, it measures the angle at the point of contact of a liquid with a surface. If the surface is highly hydrophobic (such as virgin, untreated hair), the angle of the water droplet at the interface would be greater than 90°. Likewise, a hydrophilic surface would cause the water droplet to fall flat, and the angle would be close to 0°. Virgin black hair tresses (1.5 g each, from International Hair Importers) were bleached once with a homogeneous mixture of Clairol Pure White 20V hydrogen peroxide solution (45 ml) and Clairol bleach powder Ultra Concentrate BW2000 (6.75 g) for 10 min at 50° C. The tresses were shampooed with a 7.5% Sodium Lauryl Sulfate solution twice and air-dried for 24 h. A separate tress was kept aside and used without any further treatment in the contact angle experiment and referred to as: Plain Bleached. Additionally, an untreated virgin black tress was used as hydrophobic control. The hair was shampooed twice with 7.5% Sodium Lauryl Sulfate solution, air-dried for 24 h and labeled as: Virgin. To one of the bleached tresses, 0.2 g of shampoo 51 from Table 3 was applied and lathered for 20 s, followed by a 20 s rinse under running water. The wet tress was blotted in paper towels until the water had stopped dripping and 0.2 g of conditioner Cl from Table 4 was then applied to the hair. It was continuously spread through the fibers for 20 s and was followed by a 20 s rinse. These 2 steps were denoted as one shampoo-conditioner cycle. The cycle was repeated for another 19 times to a total of 20 cycles. The tress was then labeled as: 20× Placebo. An additional bleached tress was shampooed and conditioned 20 times following the procedure as described above using shampoo S1 and conditioner C2 (from Table 5). The tress was labeled as: 20× Active. Contact angle measurements were performed with a Cahn DCA-312 tensiometer. The tensiometer motor and balance were calibrated prior to use. ASTM Type II distilled water (BDH-1168, lot 092409A) was used as the liquid. The water surface tension was determined with a platinum DuNuoy ring (Cat 14-812-5) to be 70.6 mN/m. The water was changed out between each sample. The hair fiber diameter was measured with a precision micrometer (Mitutoyo Cat 293-761-30). Individual hair fibers were mounted in the tensiometer grip and immersed at the top speed range of 20-264 micrometers/sec. The advancing and receding contact angles were measured for each sample, with runs performed in triplicate. The results are shown in Table 6. TABLE 3 Shampoo formula S1 Ingredients (w/w)% Water Q.S.

As observed in Table 6, the use of the placebo conditioner containing standard cationic and conditioning compounds (20× Placebo) did not significantly impact the hydrophilic nature of the bleached hair. However, the addition of 1.5% cationic fluorinated alcohol Example 15 in from Table 1 to conditioner C2 (20× Active) significantly increased the contact angle of the bleached hair nearing that of the Virgin sample, signifying improved hydrophobicity. This data suggests that the 20× Active treated hair may behave more like virgin, undamaged hair in regards to water uptake, swelling, and friction, leading to improved fell, look and manageability of hair.
