FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to cleaning products, and preferably to liquid laundry or dish detergent products. The cleaning products of the present invention contain an alkoxylated polyalkyleneimine, an organomodified silicone and a siloxane-based diluent, which in combination exhibit surprising and unexpected improvements in their ability to reduce suds during the rinse cycle of a cleaning process. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Surfactants in detergent products typically create a significant volume of suds during wash. During subsequent rinsing steps, the suds and excessive surfactants are rinsed off together with soil and other debris. Sudsing profile of a detergent composition is important for the consumer experience, where the appropriate volume and speed of suds formation, retention and disappearance in the wash and rinse cycles are considered key benchmarks of cleaning performance by the consumers. A large volume of suds is initially desirable, especially during a hand washing process where the user is directly involved with the wash, feeling and touching the suds generated by the detergent composition. Copious suds during the wash is viewed by the consumers as the primary and most desirable signal of cleaning, as it indicates to the user that sufficient surfactant is present, working to clean the articles (e.g., fabric or dishes). Paradoxically, while a large volume of suds is desirable during the wash cycle of a cleaning process, it is nevertheless undesirable during the rinse cycle. If a high volume of suds is still present during the rinse cycle, the consumers immediately infer from it that there may still be surfactant residue left on the articles and that the articles are not yet “clean”. As a result, the consumers will feel the need to rinse multiple times until the suds completely disappear. Sometimes, it can take between 3-6 rinses in order to remove such suds to the satisfaction of the consumer. This adds up to a greater consumption of water. Typically, about 5-10 tons of water is consumed per year per household in countries such as India and China, where habits of hand-washing fabric or dishes are more prevalent than machine-washing. Because water is often a limited resource, especially in those hand-washing countries, the excess amount of water consumed by multiple rinses reduces the amount of water available for other possible uses, such as irrigation, drinking, bathing, etc. However, it has been found that fewer rinses can sufficiently remove surfactants, and thus multiple rinses are not necessary. Therefore, if the above-described consumer perception can be successfully overcome, the number of rinsing can be reduced with little or no adverse effects to the end cleaning result. Various foam-control or anti-foaming agents have been added to detergent or cleaning compositions to control and reduce suds volume. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 8,536,109 (Dow Corning) discloses a foam control composition that contains a silicone anti-foam dispersed in an organopolysiloxane resin, wherein the silicone anti-foam includes an organopolysiloxane, an organosilicon resin, and a hydrophobic filler; U.S. Pat. No. 7,566,750 (Wacker) discloses a defoamer composition containing an organopolysiloxane, filler particles and/or an organopolysiloxane resin, and a very minor amount of added water, which is more effective in reducing the foam or suds volume. There is a continuing need for improved foam control or anti-foaming agents that can further reduce suds, especially those that can more effectively suppress or kill suds during the rinse cycle of a cleaning process, to thereby minimize the amount of water needed for rinse, and preferably to enable “single rinse” of the to-be-cleaned article. Cleaning compositions containing such improved foam control or anti-foaming agents are particularly desirable for cost saving and environmental conservation purposes. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention discovers that a cleaning composition, especially a liquid detergent composition, which contains the combination of an alkoxylated polyalkyleneimine with an organomodified silicone having one or more aryl moieties and a siloxane-based diluent having a Solubility Index of from about 0.8 to about 1.25 in the organomodified silicone (measured according to the test method described hereinafter), exhibits surprising and unexpected synergistic effect in reducing rinse suds volume.

In addition to the disclosure below, suitable examples of such other adjunct ingredients and levels of use are found in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,576,282, 6,306,812, and 6,326,348. The precise nature of these adjunct ingredients and the levels thereof in the liquid laundry detergent composition will depend on factors like the specific type of the composition and the nature of the cleaning operation for which it is to be used. Suitable adjunct ingredients for dish detergent products include: builders, chelants, conditioning polymers, cleaning polymers, surface modifying polymers, soil flocculating polymers, structurants, emmolients, humectants, skin rejuvenating actives, enzymes, carboxylic acids, scrubbing particles, bleach and bleach activators, perfumes, malodor control agents, pigments, dyes, opacifiers, beads, pearlescent particles, microcapsules, organic and inorganic cations such as alkaline earth metals such as Ca/Mg-ions and diamines, antibacterial agents, preservatives and pH adjusters and buffering means. If the cleaning composition of the present invention is provided in a powder form, it may also be especially preferred for the powder to comprise low levels, or even be essentially free, of builder. The term “essentially free” means that the composition “comprises no deliberately added” amount of that ingredient. In a preferred embodiment, the cleaning composition of the present invention comprises no builder. Method of Making the Cleaning Composition Incorporation of the above-described components and various other ingredients as described hereinabove into the cleaning compositions of the invention can be done in any suitable manner and can, in general, involve any order of mixing or addition. For example, the alkoxylated polyalkyleneimine(s), the organomodified silicone, the siloxane-based diluent, the hydrophobically modified silica, the silicone resin and the solvent as received from the manufacturer can be mixed first with a surfactant, such as an alkylalkoxy sulfate and preferably an alkylethoxy sulfate having a weight average degree of ethoxylation ranging from about 0.1 to about 5.0, to form a foam control or antifoam composition, which is then mixed with two or more of the other components to form the final detergent or cleaning composition. In another example, the alkoxylated polyalkyleneimine(s), the organomodified silicone, the siloxane-based diluent, the hydrophobically modified silica, the silicone resin, and the solvent can be simultaneously mixed with two or more of the other components to form the final cleaning composition in one mixing step. In yet another example, the alkoxylated polyalkyleneimine(s) can be premixed with an emulsifier, a dispersing agent or a suspension agent to form an emulsion, a latex, a dispersion, a suspension, and the like, which is then mixed with a foam control composition formed by premixing the organomodified silicone, the siloxane-based diluent, the hydrophobically modified silica, the silicone resin, and the solvent, followed by yet another mixing step with other components to form the final cleaning composition. These components can be added in any order and at any point in the process of preparing the final composition. Methods of Using the Cleaning Composition The present invention in one aspect is directed to a method of using the above-described cleaning composition to clean fabric, the method comprising the steps of: (i) providing a cleaning composition as described above; (ii) forming a laundry liquor by diluting the cleaning composition with water; (iii) washing fabric in the laundry liquor; and (iv) rinsing the fabric in water, wherein after 2 or less rinses, preferably after 1 rinse, the laundry liquor is substantially free of suds, or at least about 75%, preferably at least about 85%, more preferably about 95%, and even more preferably at least about 99% of a surface area of the laundry liquor is free from suds. The method of cleaning fabric may be carried out in a top-loading or front-loading automatic washing machine, or can be used in a hand-wash laundry application, which is particularly preferred in the present invention. The present invention in another aspect is directed to a method of using the above-described cleaning composition to clean dishes. Said method comprises the step of applying the cleaning composition, preferably in liquid form, onto a dish surface, either in diluted form or neat form, followed by rinsing. By “neat form,” it is meant that the cleaning composition is applied directly onto the dish surface to be treated and/or onto a cleaning device such as a dish cloth, a sponge or brush, without undergoing any dilution immediately prior to the application. By “diluted form,” it is meant that the cleaning composition is diluted by the user with an appropriate solvent, typically water. Test Methods Various techniques are known in the art to determine the properties of the compositions of the present invention comprising the cationic polymer. However, the following assays must be used in order that the invention described and claimed herein may be fully understood. Test 1: Solubility Index Test—Measuring the Miscibility or Solubility of Materials in Organomodified Silicones Via UV-Vis % Transmittance The Solubility Index is determined by measuring the percentage of light transmittance through samples using a UV-Vis Spectrophotometer operated in transmission mode, at 480 nm, using 1 cm path length cuvettes, in accordance with the following procedure. Suitable instruments include the Beckman Coulter model DU 800 UV-Vis Spectrophotometer (Beckman Coulter Inc., Brea, Calif., USA). All sample preparations and analyses are conducted in a laboratory with air temperature of 22° C.+/−2° C. In a glass scintillation vial combine the predominant organocompatible silicone present in the composition, along with the material to be tested (for example, a polydimethyl siloxane polymer), at the ratio of 80:20 vol/vol. Cap the vial, and mix the materials thoroughly for 5 minutes using a benchtop vortex mixer set to its highest speed. If two or more distinct layers of materials are clearly visible by eye in the vial after mixing, then the Solubility Index of the test material is considered to be indeterminate via this method. If distinct layers are not clearly visible by eye, then continue with the analysis. Turn on the spectrophotometer lamps and allow them to warm up for 30 minutes prior to commencing measurements. Set the instrument to collect the measurement in Percentage Transmission (% T) mode, at a wavelength of 480 nm. Load all samples into 1 cm path length plastic cuvettes. If air bubbles are visible in the cuvettes, use a pipette to remove the bubbles, or let the bubbles settle out of the cuvette prior to measurement. Zero the baseline for a neat sample of the organocompatible silicone by using a cuvette loaded with deionized (DI) water along with a cuvette loaded with the neat silicone. Measure the % T of the neat organocompatible silicone. Measure the % T of the mixture of organocompatible silicone and test sample, as prepared under the previous instructions. Compare the % T of the mixture of organocompatible silicone and test sample, to the % T of the neat organomodified silicone (which was measured using a DI water blank as a baseline). The Solubility Index is reported as a decimal number, and is calculated as the % T of the mixture of organocompatible silicone and test sample, divided by the % T of the neat organocompatible silicone. For example, Solubility Index of a specific Test Sample A=% T of ABC in Organocompatible Silicone/% T of the Organocompatible Silicone=85%/98%=0.867 EXAMPLES Example 1 Silicone Antifoam Agent A1 Silicone antifoam agent A1 is prepared by charging a 250 ml container equipped with a stirrer with 71.14 g of a polymer having a molecular weight of approximately 65,000 and comprising 71-75 mole % dimethylsiloxane groups, 20-24 mole % 2-phenylpropylmethylsiloxane groups, 3-7 mole % octylmethylsiloxane groups and terminated with a trimethylsilyl group1, and 3.8 g of an organosiloxane resin2 having trimethyl siloxane units and SiO2 units in a M/Q ratio of about 0.65/1 to 0.67/1 dissolved in 20.06 g of 10 cSt. polydimethylsiloxane3.

For each sample composition, the following hand washing test protocols are followed: First, a red plastic basin of 40 cm in diameter and 19 cm in depth is filled with 5 liters of water at room temperature that has a water hardness of 12 gpg and a Ca/Mg ratio of 4:1. Twenty five (25) grams of the sample liquid detergent composition is weighed and poured into the basin. The wash solution is stirred by hand in a circular motion for 10 times to ensure full dissolution. The fabrics load to be washed by each sample liquid detergent composition include: (1) 4 pieces of knitted cotton of 40 cm×40 cm in size and 125 g in weight, (2) a soiled cotton swatch with the desired size of 10.5 cm×10.5 cm carrying 0.4 gram of clay particulates, and (3) a dirty white cotton shirt of 190 grams in weight collected from a consumer panel. The shirts tested are all of the same brand and size and are worn by consumer panels during the same period of time. Dirty shirts are selected with similar soil level on collars to minimize variation. Each knitted cotton piece, the soiled cotton swatch are washed by hands with 10 times of scrubbing. The dirty shirt is washed by hand with 20 times of scrubbing on the collar, and 10 times of scrubbing on the torso section of the shirt. At the end of the wash, the height of suds on the wash liquor surface is measured with a ruler. Subsequently, the 4 pieces of knitted cotton, the cotton swatch and the shirt are removed from the wash liquor and squeezed to reach a carry-over liquid weight of 990 g (i.e. 1440 g for total wet fabrics). To start the first rinse, the squeezed fabric load is placed into a rinse basin containing 7 L of water having the same hardness as described hereinabove. Three times of scrubbing are applied onto each piece of fabric. After removal of the fabric, a picture is taken from the top of the rinse basin. Suds floating on the surface of the rinsing liquor can be classified into three different suds coverage categories: (i) dense layer (opaque white, the red basin bottom is blocked from sight); (ii) thin layer (translucent white, the red basin bottom is vaguely visible), (iii) water layer (clear water, the basin bottom is clearly visible). These three categories of suds coverage render distinct intensity in grayscale imaging. The denser the suds, the lighter the imaging intensity. The rinse suds image is processed by an imaging analyzing software to calculate the surface area of the dense suds layer (i), by counting the number of pixels lighter than a defined threshold which corresponds to the area where dense suds is present on the rinsing liquor surface. The smaller the calculated surface area of the dense suds layer, the more efficient is the sample composition in reducing suds during the rinse. Following Table II contains the calculated surface area (% over the entire basin surface area) of the dense suds layer after rinse for each of the four (4) sample liquid laundry detergent compositions tested. Further, the measured results of the comparative samples (B) and (C) as well as the inventive sample (D) are normalized over that of the control sample (A) to provide a relative rinse suds reduction index (ΔE), which is calculated as the dense rinse suds surface area of the sample composition minus the dense rinse suds surface area of the control composition. TABLE II (C) (D) (A) (B) Control + Control + Control Control + PEI SA PEI + SA Dense Rinse Suds 45 19 41 2 Surface Area (%) ΔE (%) 0 26% 4% 43% It is clear from the above results that the alkoxylated polyalkyleneimine of the present invention and the silicone antifoam agent containing the organomodified silicone and the siloxane-based diluent act together to reduce rinse suds of the control liquid laundry detergent composition in a synergistic manner.
