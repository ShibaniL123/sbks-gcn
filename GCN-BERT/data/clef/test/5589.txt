The present invention relates to a composition in particular useful for care, hygiene and/or makeup of keratin materials comprising microcapsules containing at least one silicone elastomer. A composition according to the invention may be any type of cosmetic composition such as a foundation, a face powder, an eye shadow, a concealer product, a blusher, a lipstick, a lip balm, a lip gloss, a lip pencil, an eye pencil, an eyeliner, a mascara, a body makeup product, a skin colouring product, a care product such as a care cream, a 'BB' product (Blemish Balm product able to cover imperfections), a tinted cream or an antisun product, preferably a foundation or 'BB' product. The composition according to the invention may be liquid, solid or a powder. A composition of the invention is especially a composition intended to be applied to a keratin material, in particular the skin and more particularly facial skin, such as a skin care or make-up product for face. There is a growing interest in imparting care properties in cosmetic products especially in make-up compositions. These care properties are often associated with a smooth, creamy, rich appearance of the compositions. Such creamy compositions are also supposed to impart benefits like nourishing properties to the treated keratinous material, especially the skin. Nevertheless, in particular, the introduction of some ingredients in cosmetic compositions may be detrimental towards the texture of the composition. In particular, the introduction of some ingredients in cosmetic compositions may be detrimental towards the stability and especially the rheology of the composition. As representative of this kind of ingredients may be in particular mentioned some silicone elastomers which undesirably may act as rheology modifiers, when used in too important amounts. Indeed some of them absorb a significant part of the composition in which they are introduced, this absorption leading to a thickening of the composition which may be undesirable. Accordingly, there is a need for compositions containing such silicone elastomer but which rheologic properties are not modified by the presence of such silicone elastomers. There is also a need for compositions allowing to provide to the user, the benefit of high amounts of silicone elastomer but in contrast being free from the undesirable effect with respect to their rheologic properties especially not presenting a gritty feeling. Finally, the introduction of some ingredients in cosmetic compositions may be detrimental towards the general appareance and confort of use of the composition, in particular for skin-care products for which it is generally sought some codes which are an aesthetical purity of the composition associated with a good sensoriality when the composition is picked up and applied onto the skin. Surprisingly and advantageously, the compositions according to the invention meet these needs. Thus, according to one of its aspects, the invention is directed to a composition for caring for and/or making up keratin materials comprising, in a physiologically acceptable medium, at least one microcapsule containing at least one encapsulated releasable material(s) said microcapsule comprising at least one core and at least one layered coating surrounding said core, and said encapsulated material(s) being at least one silicone elastomer and being only released from said microcapsule(s) when said composition is applied onto a keratin material, such as keratin fibers or skin. The microcapsules according to the invention are particularly interesting for the following reasons. The encapsulated silicone elastomers are kept in the microcapsules during the storage of the composition and only released upon application of said composition on the keratin material. By this way, the microcapsules according to the invention allow to permanently retain the silicone elastomer in the microcapsule during the storage of the composition, and thus to efficiently prevent any undesirable modification of the stability of the composition and to keep a same long-term visual effect to said composition. By using said microcapsules, it is possible to achieve cosmetic compositions containing greater amount of silicone elastomer(s). By this way, the microcapsules according to the invention allow to overcome incompatibility issues due to the use of silicone elastomer(s) with other ingredient(s) of the composition. The microcapsules according to the invention are also advantageously stable with a large panel of solvent/ingredient associated. They are also stable into the compositions according to the present invention, preferably at high temperatures, for instance greater than or equal to 40°C, for example for one month, better two months and still better three months in an oven at 45°C or for 15 days in an oven at 60°C. In a preferred embodiment, the microcapsules according to the present invention present an appropriate softening kinetics. That is preferably, at least three hours after being in contact with the other compounds of the formula, the hardness of the microcapsules is advantageously from 5 to 50 grams, more preferably from 6 to 20 grams and still more preferably from 7 to 10 grams. Such hardness is in conformity with an industrial process for preparing the cosmetic compositions including such microcapsules. Such values of softening kinetics and hardness allow to provide not only aesthetic microcapsules but also overall aesthetic compositions. The microcapsules are not visible inside the bulk of the composition depending on the desired appearance. Advantageously, they have the ability of swelling or softening in contact of a liquid medium such as water and optionally at least one compound chosen from polyols, glycols and C2-C8 monoalcohols, and mixtures thereof or alternatively in a liquid fatty phase preferably an oily phase. By this way, they are advantageously deformable when applied on a keratin material and consequently provide a soft feeling to the user. Furthermore, their size contributes to not create any discomfort or unfavourable, grainy feeling when applied. In particular, they are soft enough to rupture upon very slight rubbing or pressing on the skin in order to release their content. They disintegrate rapidly immediately when applied, with a liquid feeling on the skin and leading to compositions devoid of any granular aspect. However, they are durable enough to avoid destruction of the coating during manufacture, even during an industrial process, and storage of corresponding composition. Thus, they exhibit a hardness sufficient to be compounded in an industrial process without alteration. Advantageously the hardness of the microcapsules does not significantly decrease during the preparation process. Thus, they allow the use of regular equipment for the preparation of the compositions of the invention. Accordingly, the microcapsules of the present invention are particularly interesting since they increase the stability of the silicone elastomer against degradation, and prevent undesirable release of the encapsulated actives into the composition during the manufacturing process and prolonged storage. A composition according to the invention may comprise from 0.1% to 20% by weight and preferably from 0.5% to 15% by weight of microcapsules relative to the total weight of the said composition. In particular for a skin care composition according to the invention, the amount of microcapsules will range from 0.1% to 5%, preferably from 0.2% to 3% by weight relative to the total weight of composition. In particular for a make-up composition according to the invention, the amount of microcapsules will range from 0.5% to 20%, preferably from 1% to 15%, more preferably from 2% to 10% by weight relative to the total weight of composition.

Ic) Silicone Elastomer In the present text, the expressions "silicone elastomer" and "organopolysiloxane elastomer" have the same meaning. The term "elastomer" means a supple, deformable material with viscoelastic properties and especially the consistency of a sponge or a supple sphere. This elastomer is formed from polymer chains of high molecular weight, the mobility of which is limited by a uniform network of crosslinking points. The organopolysiloxane elastomers according to the invention are under particles form. These organopolysiloxane elastomers used in the present invention may be in dry form or in the form of aqueous dispersions, advantageously those in the form of aqueous dispersion are preferred. The organopolysiloxane elastomers used in the composition according to the invention are partially or totally crosslinked and of three-dimensional structure. They may be chosen especially from the crosslinked polymers described in US 5 928 660 from Dow Corning. According to that patent, the crosslinked organopolysiloxane elastomer is obtained via addition and crosslinking reaction, in the presence of a catalyst in particular of platinum type, of at least: (a) an organopolysiloxane (i) containing at least two vinyl groups in the α-ω position of the silicone chain per molecule; and(b) an organosiloxane (ii) containing at least one hydrogen atom linked to a silicon atom per molecule. The aqueous dispersion may especially be obtained as follows: (a) mixing of an organopolysiloxane (i) containing at least two vinyl groups in the α-ω position of the silicone chain per molecule and of an organosiloxane (ii) containing at least one hydrogen atom linked to a silicon atom per molecule;(b) adding a catalyst, in particular of platinum type;(c) adding an aqueous phase containing an emulsifier to form an emulsion;(d) polymerization of the organopolysiloxane (i) and of the organosiloxane (ii) in emulsion in the presence of a catalyst. In particular, the organopolysiloxane (i) is chosen from n α,ω-dimethylvinylpo lydimethylsilo xanes. Reference may be made, for example, to L'Oréal patent application FR 2 800 605 for a detailed description of the process for manufacturing these aqueous suspensions of silicone elastomers. The organopolysiloxane elastomer particles have a size ranging from 0.1 to 500 µm and better still from 3 to 200 µm. These particles may be spherical, flat or amorphous, and are preferably of spherical form. These organosiloxane elastomer particles may be associated, in the aqueous suspension, with fatty substances, especially oils. In addition, these organopolysiloxane elastomer particles are stably dispersed in water by means of one or more nonionic, cationic or anionic emulsifiers with an HLB of greater than or equal to 8. The proportion of emulsifiers in the aqueous suspension preferably ranges from 0.1 to 20 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the aqueous suspension of organopolysiloxane elastomer and better still from 0.5 to 10 parts by weight. For example, the association of said silicone elastomer with its surfactant(s) may be represented by a kind of entrapped form between silicone elastomer and surfactant(s), like the one that can be obtained at the end of an emulsion polymerization process for forming the silicone elastomer and that associate the so-formed silicone elastomer particles and the surfactant used for conducting the polymerization reaction. Such associations of the silicone elastomer with its surfactant(s) exist also in some silicone elastomers that are commercialized in the form of an aqueous suspension or in a dry form (powder). The aqueous suspensions of organopolysiloxane particles that can be used for the preparation of the microcapsules according to the invention are, for example, those sold under the names BY 29-119, BY 29-122, BY 29-129 and DC 9509 by the company Dow Corning, the US INCI name of which is Dimethicone/vinyl dimethicone crosspolymer and C12-C14 pareth-12.

II- METHODS FOR PREPARING MICROCAPSULES The microcapsules may be produced by several methods known to the man skilled in the art within the coating or encapsulation domain, including spray drying, pelletization, granulation, coating, etc. Spray drying processes may be carried out by any method e.g. tangential, bottom or top spray drying. It may also be combined with a drying in a fluidized bed process. These alternatives may further be combined in order to obtain microcapsules having the required properties. Preferably at least one outer layer, more preferably all outer layers are obtained by a combination of one or several of these alternatives : tangential, bottom or top spray drying optionally combined with a fluidized bed process. For example, the microcapsules may be obtained by a method comprising mixture of the compounds (silicone elastomers, other optional actives, polymers, solvents) and drying to form capsules as disclosed in WO01/359 and WO2011/027960, or a method comprising granulation and coating by spray drying as disclosed in FR2841155, or by fluidized bed technology, which has been used in the food and pharmaceutical industry for a long time for coating and encapsulating ingredients. As an example may be cited WO2008/139053, which concerns the preparation of spheroid multilayer capsules comprising a core of sugar and concentric layers of pharmaceutical actives. Fixation of pharmaceutical actives on the core is achieved by impregnation, pulverization or projection, and then the 1st layer is dried before application of a second one. IIa) Fluid bed process Fluid bed process is disclosed for example in Teunou et al. (Fluid-Bed Coating, Poncelet, 2005, D. Food Science and Technology (Boca Raton, FL, United States), Volume 146 Issue Encapsulated and Powdered Foods, Pages 197-212). A specific feature of the fluid bed process is that it leads to coated particles wherein the core is well encapsulated, compared to spray drying, which leads to a matrix with the core material randomly dispersed in a polymer. In a preferred embodiment, the microcapsules are obtained by fluid bed process. According to this embodiment, preferably at least one layer of the microcapsules is obtained by fluid bed process. In a particular embodiment, the outer layer is obtained by fluid bed process. In another particular embodiment at least one inner layer is obtained by fluid process. At least one layer, most preferably, all layers are obtained by fluid bed process. The man skilled in the art knows how to adjust air quantity, liquid quantity and temperature allowing to reproduce a microcapsule according to the invention. Preferably a fluid bed process implemented according to the invention includes Würster process and/or tangential spray process. Such a process allows, contrary to a pelletization process, to prepare spherical capsules with a core surrounded by one or more circumferential layers. When the whole process for preparing the layers surrounding the core of the microcapsules according to the invention is carried out by fluid bed process, the microcapsule layers are advantageously regular, concentric and present a homogenous thickness. Advantageously this water acts as a swelling agent or as a softening agent towards these microcapsules without breaking them. The microcapsules are not inert when placed in water either they swell : their diameter significantly increases with an optional softening of the microcapsules, or the microcapsules significantly soften without increasing of the diameter, they become more malleable and easier to break when applied onto the skin. Water is able to act on the softening kinetics of the microcapsules and more particularly it allows to obtain a good balance between softening kinetics and hardness. As a consequence, water is particularly advantageous for softening these microcapsules suitable for the present invention, in an appropriate way, since it plays a role on softening kinetics of said microcapsules. Said microcapsules are preferably deformable in the presence of an aqueous phase, notably in the presence of water. According to this embodiment of the invention, composition comprise water in a content ranging from 30% to 99% by weight, preferably from 40% to 95% more preferably from 50% to 90% by weight relative to the total weight of the said composition. Optionally it also comprise at least one compound chosen from polyols, glycols and C2-C8 monoalcohols, and mixtures thereof. Said polyol is preferably selected from the group consisting in glycerol, glycols, preferably propylene glycol, butylene glycol, pentylene glycol, hexylene glycol, dipropylene glycol, diethylene glycol, glycol ethers, preferably mono-, di- or tripropylene glycol of alkyl(C1-C4)ether or mono-, di- or triethylene glycol of alkyl(C1-C4)ether, and mixtures thereof. Compositions according to this embodiment are advantageously in the form of an oil-in-water emulsion. Two major alternative processes for preparing the microcapsules according to the invention may also be mentioned: microencapsulation and coacervation. IIb) Microencapsulation Any suitable microencapsulation method can be used according to the present invention. In most preferred embodiments, the microencapsulation method is based on the solvent removal method as described in U.S. Patent No. 6,932,984 and U.S. Patent Application No. 11/208,007 (Publication US 2006/0051425). According to a preferred embodiment at least one layer, preferably all layers of the microcapsules is/are obtained by a microencapsulation process comprising a solvent removal step. Thus, microcapsules for use in the compositions of the present invention, encapsulating in their core one or more elastomer silicone, and comprising one or more layers of the same or different wall-forming polymer, are produced by a method comprising the steps of: (a) preparing an organic solution comprising: (i) a elastomer silicone dissolved or dispersed therein; (ii) a wall-forming polymer selected from the group consisting of a polyacrylate, a polymethacrylate preferably of low molecular weight about 15,000 D, poly(methyl methacrylate)-co-(methacrylic acid), poly(ethyl acrylate)-co-(methyl methacrylate)-co-(trimethylammonium-ethyl methacrylate chloride), poly(butyl methacrylate)-co-(2-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate)-co-(methyl methacrylate) , poly(styrene)-co-(maleic anhydride), copolymer of octylacrylamide, cellulose ethers, cellulose esters and poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(propylene glycol)-block-poly(ethylene glycol); (iii) an organic solvent of a kind that is partially miscible with water and is capable of dissolving or dispersing the substances of (i) and (ii); and, optionally, (iv) an antioxidant, a plasticizer or both;(b) preparing an aqueous continuous phase saturated with said organic solvent and comprising an emulsifier;(c) while agitating, pouring the organic solution or dispersion of (a) into the aqueous continuous phase of (b) to form an emulsion;(d) adding an excess amount of water to the emulsion obtained in (c) to initiate extraction of the organic solvent from the emulsion, and continuing the extraction by incubating the solvent, thus promoting the formation of solid single-layer microcapsules (hereinafter "the core microcapsules");(e) isolating the core microcapsules, washing with water or an aqueous solution of alcohol and drying them, thus obtaining single-layer microcapsules; and, optionally(f) forming multi-layer microcapsules by treating the surface of the dried core single-layer microcapsules of (e) with a material that modifies the morphology of the core surface, increases its specific surface area and facilitates the adhesion of an additional polymeric shell, and either repeating steps (a) to (e) to form double layer microcapsules, or repeating steps (a) to (f) followed by steps (a) to (e) one or more times to add two or more additional layers surrounding the core microcapsule. Preferably the so-obtained microcapsules comprise a core comprising at least one silicone elastomer,at least one layered coating surrounding said core, the layered coating comprising at least one hydrophilic polymer. Preferably, the hydrophilic polymer(s) is selected from (poly)(alkyl)(meth)acrylic acid and derivatives, notably (poly)(alkyl)(meth)acrylate and derivatives, preferably from alkylacrylic /alkylmethacrylic acid copolymers and their derivatives, and most preferably is a copolymer of ethyl acrylate, methyl methacrylate and low content of methacrylic acid ester with quaternary ammonium groups. According to a particular embodiment, at least one layer, preferably all layers of the microcapsules is/are obtained by a microencapsulation process. IIc) Coacervation Another preferred method for preparing the microcapsules is the technique of coacervation. Under this method, a liquid dispersion is emulsified in a continuous, external aqueous phase to form micro-sized droplets and a complex of colloidal material added to the external phase is reacted upon in such a way to form a deposit on and around each droplet thereby forming an outer wall or shell. After the formation of the outer shells, the temperature of the aqueous coacervating solution is lowered causing gelation and hardening of the shell wall material. The hardening may be accomplished by applying a condensate polymer and a cross-linking agent like glutaraldehyde. The hardening should be sufficient so that the microencapsules may be removed from the continuous external phase and dehydrated to form a stable, dry, free flowing powder capable of being handled easily and further processed to make cosmetic products without undue rupture of the microcapsules. When the preferred coacervation method is used to form the microcapsules, the size of the cores, as well as the wall thickness and strength of the outer walls or shells, may be controlled precisely by altering such factors as the pH of the aqueous phase, the relative concentration of the colloids in the aqueous phase, the degree of agitation of the coacervation solution, the temperature and duration of the reaction, the degree of cross-linking, and so on, all as is fully known and understood in the art. Preferably the so-obtained microcapsules comprise: a core comprising at least one silicone elastomer dispersed in water,at least one layered coating surrounding said core, the layered coating comprising at least one colloidal material and a crosslinking agent of said colloidal material. Advantageously, the colloidal material is selected from gelatin, gum arabic, carboxy methylcellulose and polyphosphate. The condensate polymer may be selected from urea formaldehyde polymer, melamine formaldehyde (MF), poly-vinyl Alcohol (PVA). According to a particular embodiment at least one layer, preferably all layers of the microcapsules is/are obtained by a coacervation process. The microcapsules obtained according to these processes of microencapsulation and coacervation may be deformable in the presence of a liquid fatty phase preferably an oily phase and/or in the presence of an aqueous phase. The microcapsules obtained according to these processes of microencapsulation are advantageously deformable in the presence of a liquid fatty phase preferably an oily phase. Advantageously this liquid fatty phase acts as a swelling agent or as a softening agent towards these microcapsules without breaking them. The microcapsules are not inert when placed in this liquid fatty phase either they swell : their diameter significantly increases with an optional softening of the microcapsules, or the microcapsules significantly soften without increasing of the diameter, they become more malleable and easier to break when applied onto the skin. The liquid fatty phase is able to act on the softening kinetics of the microcapsules and more particularly it allows to obtain a good balance between softening kinetics and hardness. As a consequence, the liquid fatty phase is particularly advantageous for softening these microcapsules suitable for the present invention, in an appropriate way, since it plays a role on softening kinetics of said microcapsules. Said microcapsules are deformable in the presence of the liquid fatty phase. According to this embodiment of the invention, composition comprise a liquid fatty phase in a content ranging from 30% to 99% by weight, preferably from 40% to 95% more preferably from 50% to 90% by weight relative to the total weight of the said composition. Compositions according to this embodiment are advantageously in the form of an water-in -oil emulsion. The so-prepared microcapsules will be integrated in the cosmetic formula generally at the latest stages of the formulation and after filtering stages if any, to avoid the microcapsules being broken. Preferably, the microcapsules according to the inventions are added and mixed uniformly at temperatures under 50°C. They are mixed gently with a paddle rather than a homogenizer. III- COMPOSITION A composition according to the invention is cosmetically acceptable that is it contains a physiologically acceptable medium which is non toxic and appropriate to be applied on the keratin material of human beings. "Cosmetically acceptable" in the sense of the present invention means a composition with pleasant appearance, odor or feeling. The "physiologically acceptable medium" is generally adapted to the form of under which the composition is intended to be conditioned. Particularly the nature and the amount of the ingredients are adapted for example depending on whether the composition is formulated as a solid, a fluid or a powder. Depending upon the form and the aim of the skin care or make-up preparation, the composition of the invention may comprise, in addition to the microcapsules , further additional cosmetic ingredient(s) such as the ones selected from volatile and non-volatile silicon or hydrocarbon oils, surfactants, fillers, thickening agents, film forming agents, polymers, preservatives, silicone elastomer, self-tanning agents, colorants, actives, UV filters, perfumes, pH regulators and mixtures thereof. The pH of the cosmetic composition according to the present invention ranges preferably from 6.5 to 7.5. A preferred base to modify the pH is triethanolamine. It is a matter of routine operations for a person skilled in the art to adjust the nature and amount of the additives present in the compositions in accordance with the invention such that the desired cosmetic properties thereof are not thereby affected. Some of these conventional ingredients are detailed here-after. AQUEOUS PHASE As previously stated, an aqueous phase may be particularly advantageous for imparting and/or improving deformability to the microcapsules of the invention. The aqueous phase comprises water and, where appropriate, a water-soluble solvent. In the present invention, the term "water-soluble solvent" denotes a compound that is liquid at room temperature and water-miscible (miscibility with water of greater than 50% by weight at 25°C and atmospheric pressure). The water-soluble solvents that may be used in the composition of the invention may also be volatile. As said, the compositions of the invention may advantageously contain an aqueous phase comprising water and at least one compound chosen among polyols, glycols, C2-C8 monoalcohols and mixtures thereof. It also may contain C4 ketones and C2-C4 aldehydes. The aqueous phase is preferably present in an amount of at least 3% by weight, preferably at least 5% by weight, more preferably at least 8% by weight and advantageously at least 10 % by weight relative to the weight of the composition. Advantageously, the aqueous phase is present in an amount of at least 30% by weight, preferably at least 40% by weight, more preferably at least 50% by weight relative to the weight of the composition. Generally water is present in an amount ranging from 30% to 90% by weight, preferably 40% to 85% by weight and more preferably from 50 to 80% by weight, relative to the weight of the composition. Advantageously, the aqueous phase may be present in a content ranging from 30% to 99 % by weight, preferably from 40% to 95% more preferably from 50% to 90% by weight relative to the total weight of the said composition. The composition of the invention will generally comprise at least one compound chosen from polyols, glycols, C2-C8 monoalcohols, and mixtures thereof in amount ranging from 3% to 50% by weight, preferably from 5% to 45% by weight and more preferably from 10% to 45% by weight relative to the total weight of the composition. In a preferred embodiment, the aqueous phase suitable for the present invention comprises at least one C2-C8 monoalcohols. In another preferred embodiment, the aqueous phase suitable for the present invention comprises at least one polyol or glycol. In another preferred embodiment, the aqueous phase suitable for the present invention comprises at least one C2-C8 monoalcohols and at least one polyol or glycol. Monoalcohols or Lower alcohols Monoalcohol or lower alcohol that is suitable for use in the invention may be a compound of linear, branched or cyclic, saturated or unsaturated alkyl type, bearing only one -OH function. Advantageously, C2-C8 monoalcohols are non cyclic monoalcohols, still preferably they are C2-C5 monoalcohols and preferably C2-C3 monoalcohols. The lower monoalcohols that are advantageously suitable for formulating a composition according to the present invention are those especially containing from 2 to 5 carbon atoms such as ethanol, propanol, butanol, isopropanol, isobutanol preferably ethanol and/or isopropanol and more preferably at least ethanol. A composition of the invention may comprise at least 1% by weight, preferably at least 2%, more preferably from 2% to 15%, advantageously from 3% to 10%, by weight and better still from 3% to 8% by weight, preferably from 4% to 6% by weight of mono-alcohol(s) relative to the total weight of said composition. In a preferred embodiment, a composition of the invention comprises ethanol and/or isopropanol and more preferably at least ethanol, in a total concentration of 2 to 15% by weight and more preferably of 3 to 10% by weight relative to the total weight of said composition. Lower monoalcohols such as ethanol can be advantageous used in many ways in the field of makeup and/or care of keratin material(s). Such compounds are particularly useful for providing a fresh feeling to the user when he applied on the skin, a composition of the invention. Furthermore, such a feeling of freshness, pleasant as such to the user, may also advantageously allow to activate blood circulation in the skin where it is felt, especially in the skin surrounding the eyes which forms a particularly well vascularized area. The fresh feeling accompanying the application of these lower monoalcohols thus reduces puffiness and dark circles present in this part of the face due to the high vascularity and thinness in this part of the face. The application of lower monoalcohols can also advantageously avoid the need to apply other cooling agents such as menthol, ethyl menthane carboxamide, menthyl lactate, menthoxypropanediol around the eyes, which are generally raw material irritating to the eyes. There is also a need to have at disposal compositions containing microcapsules in a physiological medium comprising a lower alcohol because some cosmetic ingredients are particularly soluble in hydroalcoholic media. Furthermore, the lower monoalcohols such as ethanol allow to dissolve active agents, especially keratolytic agents, such as, for example, salicylic acid and its derivatives. Some microcapsules of the prior art rapidly disintegrate in hydroalcoholic media, as a consequence there was a need to have at disposal compositions comprising microcapsules stable in hydroalcoholic media. Polyols and glycols For the purposes of the present invention, the term "polyol" should be understood as meaning any organic molecule comprising at least two free hydroxyl groups. The term "polyol" according to the invention does not encompass monosaccharide-alcohol disclosed above. Preferably, a polyol in accordance with the present invention is present in liquid form at room temperature. The polyols/glycols are moisturizers or humectants. They may have an effect towards the stability of other ingredients of the composition particularly towards microcapsules of the prior art. There is thus a need to have at disposal stable compositions containing microcapsules in a physiological medium comprising a polyol and/or a glycol because these compositions present a noticeable moisturizing or humecting effect. This technical problem is solved by the compositions according to the invention. A polyol that is suitable for use in the invention may be a compound of linear, branched or cyclic, saturated or unsaturated alkyl type, bearing on each alkyl chain at least two -OH functions, in particular at least three -OH functions and more particularly at least four -OH functions.

To measure this evaporation rate, 15 g of oil or oil mixture to be tested are placed in a crystallizing dish 7 cm in diameter, placed on a balance that is in a large chamber of about 0.3 m3 which is temperature-regulated, at a temperature of 25°C, and hygrometry-regulated, at a relative humidity of 50%. The liquid is allowed to evaporate freely, without stirring it, while providing ventilation by means of a fan (Papst-Motoren, reference 8550 N, rotating at 2700 rpm) placed in a vertical position above the crystallizing dish containing said oil or said mixture, the blades being directed towards the crystallizing dish, 20 cm away from the bottom of the crystallizing dish. The mass of oil remaining in the crystallizing dish is measured at regular intervals. The evaporation rates are expressed in mg of oil evaporated per unit of area (cm2) and per unit of time (minutes).

Thus, the polyamide containing silicone units may be grafted and optionally crosslinked with silicone chains containing amide groups. Such polymers may be synthesized with trifunctional amines. According to one advantageous embodiment of the invention, the groups capable of establishing hydrogen interactions are amide groups of formulae -C(O)NH- and -HN-C(O)-. In this case, the structuring agent may be a polymer comprising at least one unit of formula (III) or (IV): or in which R4, R5, R6, R7, X, Y, m and n are as defined above.

In this case, the polymer may correspond to formula VI: in which R4 to R7, X, Y, m1, m2, n and p have the meanings given above and Y1 is different from Y but chosen from the groups defined for Y. As previously, the various units may be structured to form either a block copolymer, or a random copolymer or an alternating copolymer. In this first embodiment of the invention, the structuring agent may also consist of a grafted copolymer. Thus, the polyamide containing silicone units may be grafted and optionally crosslinked with silicone chains containing amide groups. Such polymers may be synthesized with trifunctional amines. In this case, the polymer may comprise at least one unit of formula (VII): in which X1 and X2, which are identical or different, have the meaning given for X in formula (I), n is as defined in formula (I), Y and T are as defined in formula (I), R14 to R21 are groups chosen from the same group as R4 to R7, m1 and m2 are numbers in the range from 1 to 1000, and p is an integer ranging from 2 to 500.

These polyamides containing a grafted silicone unit of formula (VII) may be copolymerized with polyamide-silicones of formula (II) to form block copolymers, alternating copolymers or random copolymers. The weight percentage of grafted silicone units (VII) in the copolymer may range from 0.5% to 30% by weight. According to the invention, as has been seen previously, the siloxane units may be in the main chain or backbone of the polymer, but they may also be present in grafted or pendent chains. In the main chain, the siloxane units may be in the form of segments as described above. In the pendent or grafted chains, the siloxane units may appear individually or in segments. According to one embodiment variant of the invention, a copolymer of silicone polyamide and of hydrocarbon-based polyamide, or a copolymer comprising units of formula (III) or (IV) and hydrocarbon-based polyamide units, may be used. In this case, the polyamide-silicone units may be located at the ends of the hydrocarbon-based polyamide. According to one preferred embodiment, the silicone polyamide comprises units of formula III, preferably in which the groups R4, R5, R6 and R7 represent methyl groups, one from among X and Y represents an alkylene group of 6 carbon atoms and the other represents an alkylene group of 11 carbon atoms, n representing the degree of polymerization DP of the polymer.

According to another embodiment, the silicone resins are propylphenylsilsesquioxane resins. Silsesquioxane resins are a specific form of film forming silicone resins. Silicone resins are crosslinked organopolysiloxanes which are solid at room temperature and generally soluble in organic solvents. When they are soluble in volatile solvents, silicone resins are capable of forming a film once the solvent has evaporated. Furthermore, if the solvent dissolving the silicone resin is absorbed on the substrate onto which it is applied, the silicone resin which remains on the substrate may also form a film. The compositions of the present invention may comprise propylphenylsilsesquioxane resins, which have been disclosed in patent publications WO2005/090444, published on September 29, 2005; US20040180011, published on September 16, 2004; and US20040156806, published on August 12, 2004. The propylphenylsilsesquioxane resin comprises at least about 70 mole % of propyl siloxy units (C3H7SiO3/2), based on the total mole % siloxy units of the resin, and at most about 30 mole % of phenyl siloxy units (C6H5SiO3/2), based on the total mole % siloxy units of the resin. The mole % of propyl siloxy units to phenyl siloxy units can be adjusted depending on an intended application. As such, it is possible to have propylphenylsilsesquioxane resins having a mole % propyl siloxy units: phenyl siloxy units ranging from about 70:30 to about 100:0, such as 70:30; 80:20; 90:10; and 100:0; and subranges therebetween. When the mole % of the propyl siloxy units is about 100 mole %, the propylphenylsilsesquioxane resin is referred to as a propylsilsesquioxane resin. A suitable example of a propylphenylsilsesquioxane resin for use in cosmetic compositions of the present invention includes, but is not limited to, a propylsilsesquioxane resin commercially available from Dow-Corning under the tradename DC 670 Fluid.

The microcapsules release material during application without any particle feeling. Makeup results are perfectly and evenly provided after application. However, a transparent gel could also by slightly colored. In this case, a transparent gel comprises at least one colorant, preferably in an amount of less than 1% by weight based on the total weight of the total composition. The composition may also be in a form of a gelly cream, or emulsionated gel, comprising oils and surfactants. According to another embodiment, the composition according to the invention is in the form of a foam comprising from 1 to 30% by weight relative to the weight of the composition of microcapsules. The term "composition in (the) foam form" and the term "foam type formulation" have the same meaning and are understood to mean a composition comprising a gas phase (for example air) in the form of bubbles; another equivalent term is "composition expanded in volume". In one embodiment, a foam composition is obtained without any propellant (non aerosol foam). In another preferred embodiment, a foam composition is obtained with a propellant (aerosol foam) The composition in the foam form according to the invention may be obtained from a composition of the invention used as "base composition" packaged in a product. This product may contain, besides the base composition, a propellant. Thus, the present invention further relates to a product comprising: a. a container defining at least one compartment;b. a composition of the invention contained in said compartment,c. a propellant to pressurize said composition inside said compartment; andd. a dispensing head having an opening to be selectively put in fluid communication with said compartment in order to deliver said pressurized composition in the form of a foam. According to yet another embodiment, the present invention relates to a kit comprising one of the product defined above and an applicator. The compositions in the foam form according to the invention are formed stably in the form of mousse using a composition of the invention and air or an inert gas. The air or the inert gas may represent especially from 10% to 500% and preferably from 20% to 200%, for example from 30% to 100% of the volume of the composition in the foam form. This volume may be calculated by comparing the density of the base composition and of the in the foam form composition. Besides air, gases that allow the composition in the foam form to be obtained are in particular inert gases, for example nitrogen, carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, noble gases or a mixture of the said gases. When the composition comprises an oxidation-sensitive compound, it is preferable to use an oxygen-free gas such as nitrogen or carbon dioxide. The amount of gas introduced into the base composition contributes towards adjusting the density of the composition in the foam form to the desired value, for example less than or equal to 0.12 g/cm3. The composition in the foam form of the invention may have for example a density of less than or equal to 0.12 g/cm3, for example ranging from 0.02 to 0.11 g/cm3 and preferably from 0.06 to 0.10 g/cm3, this density being measured at a temperature of about 20°C and at atmospheric pressure according to the following protocol. Density measurement The test is performed on 50 ml of composition introduced into a 50 ml polished Plexiglas® goblet (V1) defining a cylindrical filling space 30 mm high having a base with a diameter of 46 mm. The goblet has a bottom wall 10 mm thick and a side wall 12 mm thick. Before measurement, the composition to be characterized and the goblet are maintained at a temperature of about 20°C. The goblet is tared and the weight value (M1) is recorded. The composition in the foam form is then introduced into the goblet so as to occupy the total volume, while avoiding the formation of air bubbles during the filling of the goblet. The assembly is left to stand for 10 seconds to allow the mousse to expand fully. The top of the goblet is then skimmed before weighing (M2). The density is assessed according to the convention ρ = (M2-M1)/50. Stability measurement The composition in the foam form according to the invention shows satisfactory stability, which may be calculated by measuring the volume of mousse (V2) remaining in the goblet after 10 minutes according to the protocol described above for the density measurement. The ratio V2/V1 corresponds to the ratio between the volume of the composition in the foam form after 10 minutes and the volume of the composition in the foam form after 10 seconds. The expression "satisfactory stability" applies especially to compositions in the foam form with a ratio V2V1 of greater than 0.85 and especially greater than 0.90, for example greater than 0.95. For a given weight of composition in the foam form, the volume of the composition in the foam form is inversely proportional to the density of the composition in the foam form. Thus, the ratio between the density of the composition in the foam form measured after 10 seconds and the density of the composition in the foam form measured after 10 minutes may be greater than 0.85 and especially greater than 0.90, for example greater than 0.95. Within the composition in the foam form according to the invention, the air pause may advantageously have a number-average size ranging from 20 µm to 500 µm and preferably ranging from 100 µm to 300 µm. The composition in the foam form may be obtained from a composition of the invention in a distributor. This distributor may be an aerosol containing, besides the base composition, a propellant. This propellant may represent less than 20% by weight of the base composition and in particular may represent from 1% to 10% by weight, for example from 2 to 8% by weight, for example at least 5% by weight of the total weight of the base composition. The propellant that may be used may be chosen from carbon dioxide, nitrogen, nitrous oxide and volatile hydrocarbons such as butane, isobutane, propane, ethane, pentane, isododecane or isohexadecane, and mixtures thereof. It may especially be a propane/butane mixture (Liquified Petroleum Gas or LPG) in a weight ratio [propane/butane] ranging from 0.1 to 1, especially of 0.31. The pressure of the propellant, and for example of said propane/butane mixture, in the aerosol may range from 0.20 to 0.50 MPa, for example from 0.20 to 0.40, and especially from 0.25 to 0.35 MPa. The compositions in the foam form employed in the invention can be prepared by processes for mixing, stirring or dispersing compressed gases, such as air, chlorofluorocarbon-based compounds, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, oxygen or helium, a process for mixing and stirring in the presence of a foaming agent, such as a surfactant. In particular, the composition in the foam form is prepared by mixing the ingredients with stirring, generally under hot conditions, and by then expanding in volume under the action of a gas, it being possible for the gas to be introduced during the stage of cooling the composition or after preparation of the composition, for example using a device for expanding in volume of Mondomix type, a beater of Kenwood type, a scraped-surface exchanger or a dynamic mixer (of IMT type, for example). The gas is preferably air or nitrogen. The composition according to the invention can be packaged in a container delimiting at least one compartment which comprises the composition, the container being closed by a closure part. The container can be equipped with a means for the dispensing of the product. The container can be a pot. The container can be at least partly made of thermoplastic. Mention may be made, as examples of thermoplastics, of polypropylene or polyethylene. Alternatively, the container is made of nonthermoplastic material, in particular of glass or metal (or alloy). The composition can be applied, e.g., by finger or using an applicator. The container is preferably used in combination with an applicator comprising at least one application component configured in order to apply the composition to keratinous substances. According to another advantageous embodiment, the applicator comprises an application nozzle. The foam composition according to the invention comprises from 1 to 30%, preferably from 3 to 10% by weight relative to the weight of the composition of microcapsules. The obtained foam is fine (small bubbles) and contains The foam composition may also comprise calcium carbonate (CaCO3) in order to avoid coloration of the water phase. The foam composition according to the invention comprises from 1 to 10%, preferably from 3 to 8% by weight relative to the weight of the composition of fillers and/or pigments advantageously TiO2. The foam composition according to the invention comprises from 0.5 to 5%, preferably from 1 to 3% by weight relative to the weight of the composition of calcium carbonate. According to another embodiment, a composition according to the invention is an oil in water (O/W) emulsion. This make up composition, which is preferably a makeup BB product for face or a foundation, provides very strong moisturizing sensation, creamy texture with very comfortable feeling during application, and sheer natural makeup result after application. After application, all these features help to deliver a very good balance of skincare efficacy perception (creamy and moisturization) as well as makeup efficacy (proper coverage and natural radiance). Advantageously, an appropriate sunscreen agent may be added. This composition mainly comprises water, at least one non-volatile oil at least one O/W emulsifier and microcapsules. The non-volatile oil(s) used in this preferred embodiment are the ones previously cited. Advantageously the O/W emulsion contains a swelling agent, this agent allow a better swelling of the microcapsules thus rendering the microcapsules easier to break during application. Water, alcohols, glycols, polyols may be used as swelling agent. Preferably the O/W emulsion also contains a co-emulsifier and/ or a solubilizer. Cetyl alcohol and stearyl alcohol may be cited as co-emulsifiers. The solubilizer may be added in order to keep the properties of the O/W emulsion on storage, in particular to solubilize the ingredients of the water phase, to make and keep the composition stable in shelf lives. Polysorbate 20, PEG-60 hydrogenated castor oil may be mentioned as examples of solubilizers. An O/W emulsion with perfect stable capsules in storage, with pigments releasing during application without any particle feeling is obtained. Makeup results are perfectly and evenly provided after application.

Figure 1 typically represents the microcapsule of example 12 wherein A represents the core comprising lecithin , mannitol, a corn starch binder and silcone elastomer, B represents the inner layer comprising lecithin , mannitol, a corn starch binder and silcone elastomer and C represents the outer layer comprising lecithin and a corn starch binder. EXAMPLES I. Microcapsules Different examples of preparation of microcapsules according to the invention are here below described for illustrating the invention. The following particles according to the invention are implemented in the examples: BY 29-119 from Dow Corning, entitled "A" in the following examples,KSP100 from Shin Etsu, entitled "B" in the following examples. Example 1: Mannitol (spray dried mannitol: Pearitol 100SD) is used as core. To a mixed solution of 1,600.0 g of methylene chloride and 1,600.0 g of ethanol, 120.0 g of ceramide (Ceramide PC 104) and 120.0 g of hydrogenated lecithin (Lipoid S 100-3) are added and completely dissolved at 40°C. To the resulting mixture, 2,000 g of silicone elastomer A is added and well dispersed with a homogenizer to prepare an inner charged coating solution. 347.70 g of Mannitol is introduced into a fluidized bed coating system (Glatt GPOG 1, bottom spray) as a seed and subjected to a coating at 500 mℓ/h of feeding rate of the inner charged solution to obtain particles having a mannitol core coated with an inner charged layer. Thereafter, to a mixed solution of 720.0 g of methylene chloride and 720.0 g of ethanol, 36.0 g of ceramide and 36.0 g of hydrogenated lecithin are added and dissolved at 40°C. To the resulting mixture, 600.0 g of titanium dioxide particles are added and well dispersed with a homogenizer to prepare a titanium dioxide particle coating solution. A coating with the resulting titanium dioxide particle coating solution is realized by a fluidized bed process to obtain particles having an inner charged layer coated with a titanium dioxide particle layer. Then, 300.0 g of shellac is dissolved in 3,000 g of ethanol to prepare an outer layer coating solution, which is coated onto the above titanium dioxide particle layer to obtain a microcapsule encapsulating in its inner layer, surrounding the core in mannitol, the silicone elastomer, and also having a titanium dioxide particle layer coated with an outer layer. Example 2: The same procedure as in Example 1 is repeated to the step for forming a titanium dioxide particles layer. Thereafter, to a mixed solution of 400.0 g of methylene chloride and 400.0 g of ethanol, 20.0 g of ceramide and 20.0 g of hydrogenated lecithin are added and dissolved at 40°C. To the resulting reaction mixture, 500 g of silicone elastomer B is added and well dispersed with a homogenizer. A coating with the resulting charged coating solution is realized by a fluidized bed process at 500 mℓ/h of feeding rate of the coating solution to obtain particles having a titanium dioxide particle layer coated with a silicone elastomer charged layer. Then, 200.0 g of polymethacrylate (Eudragit RSPO) is dissolved in 4,000 g of ethanol to prepare an outer layer coating solution. A coating with the resulting outer layer coating solution is realized by a fluidized bed process at 100 mℓ/h of feeding rate of the coating solution to obtain a microcapsule having an innerr layer encapsulating a silicone elastomer and being coated with a polymeric outer layer.
