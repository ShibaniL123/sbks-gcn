(3) Preparation of 5-bromo-6-methylbenzo[d][1,3]dioxol-4-amine
5-Bromo-6-methyl-4-nitrobenzo[d][1,3]dioxole (5.0 g, 19.2 mmol) was dissolved in ethanol (100 mL), and acetic acid (20 mL)and iron powder (5.4 g, 96.7 mmol) were added. The resultant mixture was heated to80°C and reacted under stirring for 16h. After the reaction, the resultant mixture was cooled to room temperature, and filtrated. 200 mL water was added to the filtrate. After extraction with ethyl acetate (200 mL × 3), the organic phases were combined, washed with saturated NaCl aqueous solution, dried with anhydrous sodium sulphate, filtrated, and concentrated. The crude product was purified by silica gel column chromatography (petroleum ether: ethyl acetate=20:1) to obtain the product (2.9 g, yield: 66%).
