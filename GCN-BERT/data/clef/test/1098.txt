Preparation of (R)-3-(2-(((3-(fluoromethyl)oxetan-3-yl)methyl)amino)propyl)-2-methylaniline
(3-(Fluoromethyl)oxetan-3-yl)methyl trifluoromethanesulfonate (1.92 g, 7.61 mmol) was added to a solution of (R)-3-(2-aminopropyl)-2-methylaniline (1.00 g, 6.09 mmol) and DIPEA (1.58 ml, 9.13 mmol) in 1,4-dioxane (18.7 mL) and the reaction was heated to 70Â° C. for 5 hours. After cooling, the reaction was diluted with EtOAc and washed with water. The aqueous phase was extracted with EtOAc, then the combined organics were dried over Na2SO4, filtered and evaporated. The crude product was purified by flash silica chromatography, elution gradient 0 to 10% MeOH in EtOAc. Pure fractions were evaporated to dryness to afford (R)-3-(2-(((3-(fluoromethyl)oxetan-3-yl)methyl)amino)propyl)-2-methylaniline (0.673 g, 42%) as a pale yellow gum.
