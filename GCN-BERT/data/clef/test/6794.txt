Step 2: 2-(bromomethyl)-5-methylpyrimidine
To a solution of (5-methylpyrimidin-2-yl)methanol [Example 12, Step 1] (1.3 g, 10.5 mmol, 1.00 equiv) in DCM (30 mL) was added PPh3 (2.75 g, 10.5 mmol, 1.00 equiv) and NBS (1.87 mg, 10.5 mmol, 1.00 equiv) at 0° C. The resulting solution was stirred for 1 h at 0° C. The reaction was then quenched by the addition of H2O (30 mL). The resulting solution was extracted with DCM (3×30 mL). The organic layers were dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and concentrated under vacuum. The residue was applied onto a silica gel column with ethyl acetate/petroleum ether (1:2) to afford 700 mg (35.8%) of 2-(bromomethyl)-5-methylpyrimidine as a yellow oil.
