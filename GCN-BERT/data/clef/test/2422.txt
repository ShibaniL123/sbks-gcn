CONTINUOUS SYNTHESIS OF ISOOCTYL NITRATE IN A FLOW REACTOR CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION [0001] This application claims the benefit of priority under 35 U.S.C. § 119 of Chinese Patent Application Serial No. 201410082963.0 filed on March 7, 2014, the content of which is relied upon and incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. BACKGROUND [0002] The disclosure relates to the continuous synthesis of isooctyl nitrate in flow reactors, and more particularly to the continuous synthesis of isooctyl nitrate in a flow reactor with residence time of at least 5 seconds utilizing 90% H2S04. [0003] Isooctyl nitrate, also known as 2-ethyl hexyl nitrate, is an important additive to improve cetane number (CN) of diesel. Higher CN decreases the ignition point, speeding up ignition, improving engine power while reducing fuel consumption. Efficient, safe and environmentally friendly production of isoocytl nitrate is accordingly desirable. SUMMARY [0004] A process for synthesizing isooctyl nitrate in a continuous flow reactor comprises flowing an H2S04— HN03 mixture within a flow reactor and flowing isooctyl alcohol into said flow reactor so as to mix the isooctyl alcohol with the H2S04— HN03 mixture and produce a reaction mixture stream in said flow reactor at a reaction temperature within in the range -10° to 35°C inclusive. Further, the residence time of the reaction mixture stream in the flow reactor is within the range of 5 to 40 seconds, inclusive, and the H2S04 of the H2S04— HN03 mixture has a concentration within the range of 85 to 95% inclusive H2S04. In additional or alternative embodiments, the H2S04 of the H2S04— HN03 mixture has a concentration within the range of 88 to 92% inclusive H2S04, or a concentration of 90% H2S04. [0005] A further alternative or additional aspect (in the form of additional steps that may desirably be included with steps of any or all other embodiments) comprises capturing post- reaction H2S04 and reusing the captured H2S04 in the H2S04— HN03 mixture. [0006] The present disclosure provides a method for synthesizing isooctyl nitrate in a continuous flow reactor in which very high conversion (of at least 99.5% and up to 100%) and yield (of at least 99% and up to 100%) may be achieved using less-concentrated H2S04 in place of the typical 98% H2S04, such as H2S04 in the range of 85 to 95% inclusive, desirably 88 to 92% inclusive, most desirably 90% (to within typical industrial tolerances). This allows for recovery and re-use of H2S04, thus decreasing the cost of the process and lessening the environmental effects thereof. [0007] Additional features and advantages will be set forth in the detailed description which follows, and in part will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art from that description or recognized by practicing the embodiments as described herein, including the detailed description which follows, the claims, as well as the appended drawings.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION [0013] The present disclosure provides a continuous process for production of isooctyl nitrate from isooctyl alcohol and an FTN03— H2S04 acid mixture in a flow reactor. A diagram of the reaction is shown in Figure 1, and a process diagram 200 is shown in Figure 2, including a flow reactor 100 and additional process components. Three chemicals, H2S04 (feed Al), HN03 (feed A2) and isooctyl alcohol (feed A3), are desirably dosed separately by the use of pulsation- free pumps. In that case, the HN03— H2S04 acid mixture is prepared in the flow reactor 100 by flowing the feeds Al and A2 together so as to mix the acids in reactor module 1 10. Alternatively, the HN03— H2S04 acid mixture may be prepared in an upstream batch, and then dosed with one pump, in which case module 1 10 may represent a batch processing source 110 for the acid mixture (and thus not a part of the flow reactor 100), which mixture is flowed into (pumped by the single pump represented in dashed outline) into the flow reactor 100, at module 120, and the pumps shown on feeds Al and A2 may be unnecessary. In either case, lower-concentration H2S04 is used, rather than the typical high strength 98% H2S04, as a component of the acid mixture. The H2S04 used may have a concentration in the range of 85 to 95% inclusive, desirably 88 to 92% inclusive, most desirably 90%, to within typical industrial tolerances. In either case (whether acid mixing takes place in the flow reactor 100 or not) the acid mixture is flowed within the flow reactor 100 in this embodiment, in (and into) module 120. [0014] Isoocytl alcohol is also flowed into the flow reactor 100, as feed A3 into module 120 in this embodiment, so as to mix the isooctyl alcohol with the H2S04— FTN03 mixture and produce a reaction mixture stream flowing in the reactor 100, beginning within module 120 in the embodiment shown. [0015] The reaction time in the flow reactor (the "dwell time" or "residence time" after first contact of the alcohol and the acid mixture) is controlled to be in the range of from 5 to 40 seconds, inclusive, desirably in the range of from 10 to 20 seconds, inclusive. If additional volume (length) of flow path is needed within the flow reactor 100 in order to achieve such residence time simultaneously with adequate flow rates for desirable rates of production and mixing, one or more additional modules 130 (shown in dashed outline because it is optional) may be used downstream of module 120. The reaction mixture stream is desirably flowed within a passage shaped to induce mixing throughout the duration of the residence time. In other words, in the embodiment shown, downstream of the contact point of the acid mixture and the alcohol within module 120, the flow passage is desirably shaped to induce mixing along its whole length, both within module 120 and within subsequent flow reactor module(s) 130, if any. [0016] While the acid mixture and the alcohol are mixing and then flowing together in the reactor 100, the temperature range of the process is maintained at a temperature within the range of from -10 to 35° C, inclusive, desirably within 5° to 15° C, inclusive. This may be achieved by the use of chilled thermal control fluid circulated around or within the reactor 100, desirably around or within the module 120 and around or within subsequent flow reactor module(s) 130, if any, in parallel. [0017] Flow rate ranges may extend from 0.25 mol/minute for the alcohol reactant (such as in an Advanced-Flow™ reactor from Corning Incorporated assembled from "Gl" flow modules) to 16 mol/minute for the alcohol reactant (such as in an Advanced-Flow™ reactor from Corning Incorporated assembled from larger "G4" flow modules). As mentioned above, the reactor is desirably of such design that the reaction mixture stream is flowed within a passage shaped to induce mixing throughout the duration of the residence time. System pressure under these conditions and in the "Gl " and "G4" flow reactors (as described in the examples below) ranges from 0.2 MPa to 1 MPa, and a safe and stable process is achieved, as evidenced by a lack of variation in system pressure, product temperature, or product color. [0018] After the reaction, the crude reacted solution is then separated in separator/separation process 140 to obtain the organic phase, which may be washed and neutralized with aqueous NaHC03. After drying, and filtration, pure product may then be obtained. Greater than 99.5% of conversion was achieved (and as much as 100%), and the yield better than 99% (and as much as 100%) was achieved by the disclosed method. [0019] Because the reaction temperature is limited to temperatures of 35° C and below, and because the reaction time (residence time) is long (from 5 to 40 seconds, desirably 10 to 20), the reaction is slower and easier to control, and thermal runaway is prevented. Given that such excellent conversion and yield are achieved with lower-concentration H2S04, such as only 90% H2S04 (rather than 98%), post-reaction H2S04 may optionally be captured in capture device/process 150. Captured H2S04 may then be reused in the H2S04— H 03 mixture as a part of the disclosed process, as indicated by the dashed path from capture device/process 150 to feed Al , such as by purifying the captured H2S04 (which will generally be at weaker strength than that used at the start of the process) or by mixing some of the captured H2S04 with higher strength H2S04 to provide the desired starting strength. Such reuse can reduce the cost and improve the environmental performance of the process. [0020] Note that processes and/or steps not performed within the flow reactor 100, such as separation process/device 140 and (optional) capture process/device 150, as well as the acid mixing in device 1 10, may be either flow-type devices/processes or batch-type, as desired or as appropriate. [0021] As a further option flowing the H2S04— HN03 mixture within a flow reactor 100 may also include bringing the H2S04— HN03 mixture to, or maintaining the H2S04— HN03 mixture at, a temperature within the range of - 10 to 35° C inclusive, while flowing the H2S04— HN03 mixture within the flow reactor. If, as is desirable, the H2S04— HN03 mixture is prepared upstream in a part of the flow reactor 100 (namely, in module 110), then modules 1 10 may also be provided with thermal control fluid circulated around or within the module 1 10. Similarly, the isooctyl alcohol may be brought to and/or maintained at a temperature within the range of -10 to 35° C inclusive, before or while it is flowed within the flow reactor 100. [0022] The flow rates of the acid mixture and alcohol are desirably chosen to result in a molar ratio of H2S04 to isooctyl alcohol, in the reaction mixture stream, within the range of 1.5: 1 to 2: 1 inclusive. The flow rates of the acid mixture and alcohol are also desirably chosen to result in a molar ratio of HN03 to isooctyl alcohol, in the reaction mixture stream, of 1 : 1. [0023] In addition to allowing use of less-concentrated H2S04, which allows for economically feasible recovery and recycling of H2S04, the present process can and desirably does achieve conversion of 100% and yield of greater than 99.5%, desirably 100%. Examples [0024] Various embodiments will be further illustrated in or by the following examples. The reactors 100 used in the examples below are shown diagrammatically in Figures 3 and 4. [0025] Figure 3 shows a flow reactor 100 comprised, in this embodiment, of modules 11, 12, 13, and 16 of the "Gl" size and type available from Corning Incorporated. As shown in Figure 3, feeds Al and A2, 90% H2S04 and 98% HN03 respectively, are flowed into a flow reactor 100, in this case comprised of "Gl" modules from Corning Incorporated. Module 11 mixes the acids as they flow therein, and is actively cooled. A module 16 is employed to receive feed A3, the isooctyl alcohol, and is desirably also cooled to provide "precooling" of the alcohol. The H2S04— HN03 mixture from module 11 , along with the optionally pre- cooled alcohol from module 16, is flowed into the module 12 which serves to mix the isooctyl alcohol and the acid mixture together. Additional residence volume/residence time is provided by module 13. As seen in the flow paths shown in modules 12 and 13, the reaction mixture stream flows within a passage shaped to induce mixing throughout the duration of the residence time. Crude product then emerges at the outlet Bl . [0026] Figure 4 is a diagrammatic representation of a flow reactor 100 comprised, in this embodiment, of modules 1 1, 12, 13a, 13b, and 13c of the "G4" size and type available from Corning Incorporated. As shown in Figure 4, heat exchange structures 20a-20f are layered around in in-between the modules 1 1, 12, 13a, 13b, and 13c to provide the desired thermal control for the reaction. A chiller 18 may be used to provide chilled thermal control fluid to the heat exchange structures 20a-20f, as shown. Feeds Al and A2, 90% H2S04 and 98% HN03 respectively, are flowed into the flow reactor 100 comprised of "G4" modules. Module 11 mixes the acids as they flow therein. Feed A3, the isooctyl alcohol, is passed more or less directly through the module 1 1, without contacting the H2S04— HN03 mixture therein. The H2S04— HN03 mixture from module 11 and the alcohol are flowed into the module 12 which serves to mix the isooctyl alcohol and the acid mixture together. Additional residence volume/residence time is provided by modules 13a, 13b, and 13c. Crude product then emerges at the outlet Bl . COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE [0027] A Gl Advanced-Flow™ reactor from Corning was configured and set up according to the description of Figure 3. A pump for 98% HN03 was set to to 13.3g/min (9.4mL/min, 0.21mol/min), and a pump for 98% H2S04 was set to 39.9g/min (21.7mL/min, 0.40mol/min). A pump for the alcohol was set to 27.4g/min (33mL/min, 0.21mol/min), and the temperature of a chiller for the cooling fluid was set to 0° C. Samples were collected periodically after the system stabilized (at about 2 minutes). Gas Chromatography (GC) analysis showed a full conversion of the starting material, and the yield was 100%. With the an internal volume of 16mL (2 modules), the retention time was (16mL)/(64.1mL/min)*60 = 15s (or liquid space velocity of 240h_1). EXAMPLE 1 [0028] A Gl Advanced-Flow™ reactor from Corning was configured and set up according to the description of Figure 3. A pump for 98% HN03 was set to 15.7g/min (1 1.2mL/min, 0.25mol/min), and a pump for 90% H2S04 was set to 47.1g/min (26.2mL/min, 0.43mol/min). A pump for alcohol was set to 33.2g/min (40mL/min, 0.25mol/min), and the temperature of a chiller for the cooling fluid was set to 10° C. Samples were collected after the system stabilized (at about 2 minutes). GC analysis showed a full conversion of the starting material, and the yield was 100%. With internal volume of 16mL (2 modules), the retention time was (16mL)/(77.4mL/min)*60=12s (or liquid space velocity of 290h_1). EXAMPLE 2 [0029] A G4 Advanced-Flow™ reactor from Corning was configured and set up according to the description of Figure 4. A pump for 98% HN03 was set to l .OlKg/min (0.72L/min, 16mol/min), and a pump for 90% H2S04 was set to 3.03Kg/min (1.67L/min, 27.8mol/min), while a pump for alcohol was set to 2.08Kg/min (2.5L/min, 16mol/min), with a the chiller temperature set to 10° C. Samples were collected after the system stabilized (at about 2 minutes). GC analysis showed a full conversion of the starting material, and the yield was 100%. With total internal volume of 1.0L (4 modules), the retention time was (1.0L)/(4.89L/min)*60=12s (or liquid space velocity of 290h_1). [0030] As will be understood from the foregoing, the present disclosure provides a method for synthesizing isooctyl nitrate in a continuous flow reactor in which very high conversion and yield may be achieved using less concentrated H2S04 in place of the typical 98% H2S04, such as H2S04 in the range of 85 to 95% inclusive, desirably 88 to 92% inclusive, most desirably 90% inclusive (within typical industrial tolerances). This allows for recovery and re-use of the H2S04, thus decreasing the overall cost of the process and lessening the environmental effects thereof. Further advantages will be understood from the description. It will also be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the claims. 1.
