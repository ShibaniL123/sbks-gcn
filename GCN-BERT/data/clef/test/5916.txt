Step 5: Tert-butyl 1'-(1-((R)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)ethyl)-3-methyl-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-b]pyrazin-6-yl)-3'-methyl-[3,4'-bipiperidine]-1-carboxylate
A mixture of tert-butyl 3'-methyl-[3,4'-bipiperidine]-1-carboxylate (105.9 mg, 0.37 mmol) and diisopropylethylamine (193.8 mg, 1.5 mmol) in DMF (2 mL) was added (R)-6-chloro-1-(1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)ethyl)-3-methyl-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-b]pyrazine (120 mg, 0.35 mmol). The reaction was heated at 80Â° C. for 12 h. After cooling down to room temperature, the reaction was quenched with water and extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic phases were dried over sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated. The residue was purified by silica gel chromatography to afford tert-butyl 1'-(1-((R)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)ethyl)-3-methyl-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-b]pyrazin-6-yl)-3'-methyl-[3,4'-bipiperidine]-1-carboxylate (86.6 mg, 42%).
