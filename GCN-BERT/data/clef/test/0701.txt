CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. §119 to provisional application Ser. No. 61/699,892 filed Sep. 12, 2012, herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. FIELD OF INVENTION This invention is in the field of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) breeding, specifically relating to a wheat variety designated W020016C1. BACKGROUND OF INVENTION Wheat is grown worldwide and is the most widely adapted cereal. There are five main wheat market classes. They include the four common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) classes: hard red winter, hard red spring, soft red winter, and white. The fifth class is durum (Triticum turgidum L.). Common wheats are used in a variety of food products such as bread, cookies, cakes, crackers, and noodles. In general the hard wheat classes are milled into flour used for breads and the soft wheat classes are milled into flour used for pastries and crackers. Wheat starch is used in the food and paper industries, as laundry starches, and in other products. Because of its use in baking, the grain quality of wheat is very important. To test the grain quality of wheat for use as flour, milling properties are analyzed. Important milling properties are relative hardness or softness, weight per bushel of wheat (test weight), siftability of the flour, break flour yield, middlings flour yield, total flour yield, flour ash content, and wheat-to-flour protein conversion. Good processing quality for flour is also important. Good quality characteristics for flour from soft wheats include low to medium-low protein content, a low water absorption, production of large-diameter test cookies and large volume cakes. Wheat glutenins and gliadins, which together confer the properties of elasticity and extensibility, play an important role in the grain quality. Changes in quality and quantity of these proteins change the end product for which the wheat can be used. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a new and distinctive wheat variety, designated W020016C1 which has been the result of years of careful breeding and selection as part of a wheat breeding program. There are numerous steps in the development of any novel, desirable plant germplasm. Plant breeding begins with the analysis and definition of problems and weaknesses of the current germplasm, the establishment of program goals, and the definition of specific breeding objectives. The next step is selection of germplasm that possess the traits to meet the program goals. The goal is to combine in a single variety an improved combination of desirable traits from the parental germplasm. These important traits may include higher seed yield, resistance to diseases and insects, tolerance to drought and heat, improved grain quality, and better agronomic qualities. Field crops are bred through techniques that take advantage of the plant's method of pollination. A plant is self-pollinated if pollen from one flower is transferred to the same or another flower of the same plant. A plant is sib-pollinated when individuals within the same family or line are used for pollination. A plant is cross-pollinated if the pollen comes from a flower on a different plant from a different family or line. The term cross-pollination herein does not include self-pollination or sib-pollination. Wheat plants (Triticum aestivum L.), are recognized to be naturally self-pollinated plants which, while capable of undergoing cross-pollination, rarely do so in nature. Thus intervention for control of pollination is critical to the establishment of superior varieties. A cross between two different homozygous lines produces a uniform population of hybrid plants that may be heterozygous for many gene loci. A cross of two heterozygous plants each that differ at a number of gene loci will produce a population of plants that differ genetically and will not be uniform. Regardless of parentage, plants that have been self-pollinated and selected for type for many generations become homozygous at almost all gene loci and produce a uniform population of true breeding progeny. The term “homozygous plant” is hereby defined as a plant with homozygous genes at 95% or more of its loci. Choice of breeding or selection methods depends on the mode of plant reproduction, the heritability of the trait(s) being improved, and the type of variety used commercially (e.g., F1 hybrid variety, pureline variety, etc.). For highly heritable traits, a choice of superior individual plants evaluated at a single location will be effective, whereas for traits with low heritability, selection should be based on mean values obtained from replicated evaluations of families of related plants. Popular selection methods commonly include pedigree selection, modified pedigree selection, mass selection, and recurrent selection. The complexity of inheritance influences choice of the breeding method. In general breeding starts with the crossing of two genotypes (a “breeding cross”), each of which may have one or more desirable characteristics that is lacking in the other or which complements the other. If the two original parents do not provide all the desired characteristics, other sources can be included by making more crosses. In each successive filial generation, F1→F2; F2→F3; F3→F4; F4→F5, etc., plants are selfed to increase the homozygosity of the line. Typically in a breeding program five or more generations of selection and selfing are practiced to obtain a homozygous plant. Pedigree breeding is commonly used for the improvement of self-pollinating crops. Two parents that possess favorable, complementary traits are crossed to produce an F1. An F2 population is produced by selfing or sibbing one or several Fts. Selection of the best individuals may begin in the F2 population; then, beginning in the F3, the best individuals in the best families are selected. Replicated testing of families can begin in the F4 generation to improve the effectiveness of selection for traits with low heritability. At an advanced stage of inbreeding (i.e., F5, F6 and F7), the best lines or mixtures of phenotypically similar lines are tested for potential release as new varieties. Backcross breeding has been used to transfer genes for simply inherited, qualitative, traits from a donor parent into a desirable homozygous variety that is utilized as the recurrent parent. The source of the traits to be transferred is called the donor parent. After the initial cross, individuals possessing the desired trait or traits of the donor parent are selected and then repeatedly crossed (backcrossed) to the recurrent parent. The resulting plant is expected to have the attributes of the recurrent parent (e.g., variety) plus the desirable trait or traits transferred from the donor parent. This approach has been used extensively for breeding disease resistant varieties. Each wheat breeding program should include a periodic, objective evaluation of the efficiency of the breeding procedure. Evaluation criteria vary depending on the goal and objectives, but should include gain from selection per year based on comparisons to an appropriate standard, overall value of the advanced breeding lines, and number of successful varieties produced per unit of input (e.g., per year, per dollar expended, etc.). Various recurrent selection techniques are used to improve quantitatively inherited traits controlled by numerous genes. The use of recurrent selection in self-pollinating crops depends on the ease of pollination and the number of hybrid offspring from each successful cross. Recurrent selection can be used to improve populations of either self- or cross-pollinated crops. A genetically variable population of heterozygous individuals is either identified or created by intercrossing several different parents. The best plants are selected based on individual superiority, outstanding progeny, or excellent combining ability. The selected plants are intercrossed to produce a new population in which further cycles of selection are continued. Plants from the populations can be selected and selfed to create new varieties. Another breeding method is single-seed descent. This procedure in the strict sense refers to planting a segregating population, harvesting a sample of one seed per plant, and using the one-seed sample to plant the next generation. When the population has been advanced from the F2 to the desired level of inbreeding, the plants from which lines are derived will each trace to different F2 individuals. The number of plants in a population declines each generation due to failure of some seeds to germinate or some plants to produce at least one seed. As a result, not all of the F2 plants originally sampled in the population will be represented by a progeny when generation advance is completed. In a multiple-seed procedure, wheat breeders commonly harvest one or more spikes (heads) from each plant in a population and thresh them together to form a bulk. Part of the bulk is used to plant the next generation and part is put in reserve. The procedure has been referred to as modified single-seed descent. The multiple-seed procedure has been used to save labor at harvest. It is considerably faster to thresh spikes with a machine than to remove one seed from each by hand for the single-seed procedure. The multiple-seed procedure also makes it possible to plant the same number of seeds of a population each generation of inbreeding. Enough seeds are harvested to make up for those plants that did not germinate or produce seed. Bulk breeding can also be used. In the bulk breeding method an F2 population is grown. The seed from the populations is harvested in bulk and a sample of the seed is used to make a planting the next season. This cycle can be repeated several times. In general when individual plants are expected to have a high degree of homozygosity, individual plants are selected, tested, and increased for possible use as a variety. Molecular markers including techniques such as Starch Gel Electrophoresis, Isozyme Eletrophoresis, Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphisms (RFLPs), Randomly Amplified Polymorphic DNAs (RAPDs), Arbitrarily Primed Polymerase Chain Reaction (AP-PCR), DNA Amplification Fingerprinting (DAF), Sequence Characterized Amplified Regions (SCARs), Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphisms (AFLPs), Simple Sequence Repeats (SSRs), and Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) may be used in plant breeding methods. One use of molecular markers is Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) mapping. QTL mapping is the use of markers, which are known to be closely linked to alleles that have measurable effects on a quantitative trait. Selection in the breeding process is based upon the accumulation of markers linked to the positive effecting alleles and/or the elimination of the markers linked to the negative effecting alleles from the plant's genome. Molecular markers can also be used during the breeding process for the selection of qualitative traits. For example, markers closely linked to alleles or markers containing sequences within the actual alleles of interest can be used to select plants that contain the alleles of interest during a backcrossing breeding program. The markers can also be used to select for the genome of the recurrent parent and against the markers of the donor parent. Using this procedure can minimize the amount of genome from the donor parent that remains in the selected plants. It can also be used to reduce the number of crosses back to the recurrent parent needed in a backcrossing program (Openshaw et al. Marker-assisted Selection in Backcross Breeding. In: Proceedings Symposium of the Analysis of Molecular Marker Data, 5-6 Aug. 1994, pp. 41-43. Crop Science Society of America, Corvallis, Oreg.). The use of molecular markers in the selection process is often called Genetic Marker Enhanced Selection. The production of double haploids can also be used for the development of homozygous lines in the breeding program. Double haploids are produced by the doubling of a set of chromosomes (1 N) from a heterozygous plant to produce a completely homozygous individual. This can be advantageous because the process omits the generations of selfing needed to obtain a homozygous plant from a heterozygous source. Various methodologies of making double haploid plants in wheat have been developed (Laurie, D. A. and S. Reymondie, Plant Breeding, 1991, v. 106:182-189. Singh, N. et al., Cereal Research Communications, 2001, v. 29:289-296; Redha, A. et al., Plant Cell Tissue and Organ Culture, 2000, v. 63:167-172; U.S. Pat. No. 6,362,393) Though pure-line varieties are the predominate form of wheat grown for commercial wheat production hybrid wheat is also used. Hybrid wheats are produced with the help of cytoplasmic male sterility, nuclear genetic male sterility, or chemicals. Various combinations of these three male sterility systems have been used in the production of hybrid wheat. Descriptions of other breeding methods that are commonly used for different traits and crops can be found in one of several reference books (e.g., Allard, Principles of Plant Breeding, 1960; Simmonds, Principles of Crop Improvement, 1979; editor Heyne, Wheat and Wheat Improvement, 1987; Allan, “Wheat”, Chapter 18, Principles of Crop Development, vol. 2, Fehr editor, 1987). Promising advanced breeding lines are thoroughly tested and compared to appropriate standards in environments representative of the commercial target area(s). The best lines are candidates for new commercial varieties; those still deficient in a few traits may be used as parents to produce new populations for further selection. A most difficult task is the identification of individuals that are genetically superior, because for most traits the true genotypic value is masked by other confounding plant traits or environmental factors. One method of identifying a superior genotype is to observe its performance relative to other experimental genotypes and to a widely grown standard variety. Generally a single observation is inconclusive, so replicated observations are required to provide a better estimate of its genetic worth. A breeder uses various methods to help determine which plants should be selected from the segregating populations and ultimately which lines will be used for commercialization. In addition to the knowledge of the germplasm and other skills the breeder uses, a part of the selection process is dependent on experimental design coupled with the use of statistical analysis. Experimental design and statistical analysis are used to help determine which plants, which family of plants, and finally which lines are significantly better or different for one or more traits of interest. Experimental design methods are used to control error so that differences between two lines can be more accurately determined. Statistical analysis includes the calculation of mean values, determination of the statistical significance of the sources of variation, and the calculation of the appropriate variance components. Five and one percent significance levels are customarily used to determine whether a difference that occurs for a given trait is real or due to the environment or experimental error. Plant breeding is the genetic manipulation of plants. The goal of wheat breeding is to develop new, unique and superior wheat varieties. In practical application of a wheat breeding program, the breeder initially selects and crosses two or more parental lines, followed by repeated selfing and selection, producing many new genetic combinations. The breeder can theoretically generate billions of different genetic combinations via crossing, selfing and mutations. The breeder has no direct control at the cellular level. Therefore, two breeders will never develop exactly the same line. Each year, the plant breeder selects the germplasm to advance to the next generation. This germplasm is grown under unique and different geographical, climatic and soil conditions, and further selections are then made during and at the end of the growing season. Proper testing should detect major faults and establish the level of superiority or improvement over current varieties. In addition to showing superior performance, there must be a demand for a new variety. The new variety must be compatible with industry standards, or must create a new market. The introduction of a new variety may incur additional costs to the seed producer, the grower, processor and consumer, for special advertising and marketing, altered seed and commercial production practices, and new product utilization. The testing preceding release of a new variety should take into consideration research and development costs as well as technical superiority of the final variety. It must also be feasible to produce seed easily and economically. These processes, which lead to the final step of marketing and distribution, can take from six to twelve years from the time the first cross is made. Therefore, development of new varieties is a time-consuming process that requires precise forward planning, efficient use of resources, and a minimum of changes in direction. Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), is an important and valuable field crop. Thus, a continuing goal of wheat breeders is to develop stable, high yielding wheat varieties that are agronomically sound and have good grain quality for its intended use. To accomplish this goal, the wheat breeder must select and develop wheat plants that have the traits that result in superior varieties. According to the invention, there is provided a novel wheat variety, designated W020016C1 and processes for making W020016C1. This invention relates to seed of wheat variety W020016C1, to the plants of wheat variety W020016C1, to plant parts of wheat variety W020016C1, and to processes for making a wheat plant that comprise crossing wheat variety W020016C1 with another wheat plant. This invention also relates to processes for making a wheat plant containing in its genetic material one or more traits introgressed into W020016C1 through backcross conversion and/or transformation, and to the wheat seed, plant and plant parts produced thereby. This invention also relates to the creation of variants by mutagenesis or transformation of wheat W020016C1. This invention further relates to a hybrid wheat seed, plant or plant part produced by crossing the variety W020016C1 or a locus conversion of W020016C1 with another wheat variety. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION A wheat variety needs to be highly homogeneous, homozygous and reproducible to be useful as a commercial variety. There are many analytical methods available to determine the homozygotic stability, phenotypic stability, and identity of these varieties. The oldest and most traditional method of analysis is the observation of phenotypic traits. The data is usually collected in field experiments over the life of the wheat plants to be examined. Phenotypic characteristics most often observed are for traits such as seed yield, head configuration, glume configuration, seed configuration, lodging resistance, disease resistance, maturity, etc. In addition to phenotypic observations, the genotype of a plant can also be examined. There are many laboratory-based techniques available for the analysis, comparison and characterization of plant genotype; among these are Gel Electrophoresis, Isozyme Electrophoresis, Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphisms (RFLPs), Randomly Amplified Polymorphic DNAs (RAPDs), Arbitrarily Primed Polymerase Chain Reaction (AP-PCR), DNA Amplification Fingerprinting (DAF), Sequence Characterized Amplified Regions (SCARs), Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphisms (AFLPs), Simple Sequence Repeats (SSRs) which are also referred to as Microsatellites, and Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs). Gel electrophoresis is particularly useful in wheat. Wheat variety identification is possible through electrophoresis of gliadin, glutenin, albumin and globulin, and total protein extracts (Bietz, J. A., pp. 216-228, “Genetic and Biochemical Studies of Nonenzymatic Endosperm Proteins” In Wheat and Wheat Improvement, ed. E. G. Heyne, 1987). The variety of the invention has shown uniformity and stability for all traits, as described in the following variety description information. It has been self-pollinated a sufficient number of generations, with careful attention to uniformity of plant type to ensure homozygosity and phenotypic stability. The line has been increased with continued observation for uniformity. No variant traits have been observed or are expected in W020016C1, as described in Table 1 (Variety Description Information). Wheat variety W020016C1 is a common, soft red winter wheat. Variety W020016C1 demonstrates excellent yield potential and very good test weight. It demonstrates strong resistance to soil borne mosaic virus and strong leaf rust resistance. It also demonstrates below average resistance to leaf blight. Variety W020016C1 has medium maturity relative to other varieties in the primary region of adaptation. It has shown adaptation to the northern soft wheat regions based on tests conducted in Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, and Ontario, Canada. Wheat variety W020016C1 was developed by from a cross between three homozygous lines: 25R37, W941022B1, and 25R47. First, 25R37 was crossed to W941022B1 to produce F1 seed. Then the F1 plant was crossed to 25R47. Wheat variety W020016C1, being substantially homozygous, can be reproduced by planting seeds of the line, growing the resulting wheat plants under self-pollinating or sib-pollinating conditions, and harvesting the resulting seed, using techniques familiar to the agricultural arts. Year Generation 2001 Final cross Final cross made in Windfall, IN. 2002 F1 F1 grown in transplant nursery at Windfall, IN. 2002-03 F2 Bulk population grown and selected at Chatham, Ontario, Canada. Random heads were selected in bulk and advanced to the next generation. 2003-04 F3 Bulk population grown and selected at Chatham, Ontario, Canada. Individual spike selections made and threshed. 2004-05 F4 Headrows from F3 selections grown at Windfall, IN. Individual rows were selected, harvested and threshed individually. 2005-06 F5 A seven row × 3-meter plot was planted at Windfall, IN and Chatham, Ontario, Canada. Spikes were harvested from the selected plot in Windfall, IN and threshed individually. 2006-07 F6 Twenty headrows each of the F5 selection were grown at Windfall, IN and Princeton, IN. Selected rows were cut and threshed individually. This selection was made at Princeton, IN. 2007-08 F7 Preliminary yield testing of an F5 selection from an F6 headrow. This selection designated W020016C1. 2008-09 F8 Advanced yield testing of W020016C1. Seed purification and increase. 2009-10 F9 Performance testing, purification and seed increase of W020016C1 continued. Seed was increased in isolated 5′ × 48′ plots which were rogued for off-type plants. This constituted breeders seed. 2010-11 F10 Performance testing, purification and increase continued. 2011-12 F11 Performance testing, purification and increase continued. 2012-13 F12 Performance testing, purification and increase continued. The experimental cultivar W020016C1 was bred and selected using a modified pedigree selection method for any and all of the following characteristics in the field environment: disease resistance, plant type, plant height, head type, straw strength, maturity, grain yield, test weight, and milling and baking characteristics. W020016C1 has been shown to be uniform and stable since the 7th generation, or for the last 5 generations. W020016C1 has shown no variants other than what would normally be expected due to environment. DEFINITIONS FOR AREA OF ADAPTABILITY When referring to area of adaptability, such term is used to describe the location with the environmental conditions that would be well suited for this wheat variety. Area of adaptability is based on a number of factors, for example: days to heading, winter hardiness, insect resistance, disease resistance, and drought resistance. Area of adaptability does not indicate that the wheat variety will grow in every location within the area of adaptability or that it will not grow outside the area.

All colors are defined using Munsell Color Charts for Plant Tissues. Further Embodiments of the Invention Further reproduction of the wheat variety W020016C1 can occur by tissue culture and regeneration. Tissue culture of various tissues of wheat and regeneration of plants therefrom is well known and widely published. A review of various wheat tissue culture protocols can be found in “In Vitro Culture of Wheat and Genetic Transformation-Retrospect and Prospect” by Maheshwari et al. (Critical Reviews in Plant Sciences, 14(2): pp 149-178, 1995). Thus, another aspect of this invention is to provide cells which upon growth and differentiation produce wheat plants capable of having the physiological and morphological characteristics of wheat variety W020016C1. As used herein, the term plant parts includes plant protoplasts, plant cell tissue cultures from which wheat plants can be regenerated, plant calli, plant clumps, and plant cells that are intact in plants or parts of plants, such as embryos, pollen, ovules, pericarp, seed, flowers, florets, heads, spikes, leaves, roots, root tips, anthers, and the like. The term “plant” includes plant parts. When indicating that a plant is crossed or selfed this indicates that any plant part of the plant can be used. For instance the plant part does not need to be attached to the plant during the crossing or selfing, only the pollen might be used. The advent of new molecular biological techniques has allowed the isolation and characterization of genetic elements with specific functions, such as encoding specific protein products. Scientists in the field of plant biology developed a strong interest in engineering the genome of plants to contain and express foreign genetic elements, or additional, or modified versions of native or endogenous genetic elements in order to alter the traits of a plant in a specific manner. Any DNA sequences, whether from a different species or from the same species that are inserted into the genome using transformation are referred to herein collectively as “transgenes”. Over the last fifteen to twenty years several methods for producing transgenic plants have been developed, and the present invention, in particular embodiments, also relates to transformed versions of the wheat variety W020016C1. Numerous methods for plant transformation have been developed, including biological and physical, plant transformation protocols. See, for example, Miki et al., “Procedures for Introducing Foreign DNA into Plants” in Methods in Plant Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, Glick, B. R. and Thompson, J. E. Eds. (CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, 1993) pages 67-88. In addition, expression vectors and in vitro culture methods for plant cell or tissue transformation and regeneration of plants are available. See, for example, Gruber et al., “Vectors for Plant Transformation” in Methods in Plant Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, Glick, B. R. and Thompson, J. E. Eds. (CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, 1993) pages 89-119. The most prevalent types of plant transformation involve the construction of an expression vector. Such a vector comprises a DNA sequence that contains a gene under the control of or operatively linked to a regulatory element, for example a promoter. The vector may contain one or more genes and one or more regulatory elements. Various genetic elements can be introduced into the plant genome using transformation. These elements include but are not limited to genes; coding sequences; inducible, constitutive, and tissue specific promoters; enhancing sequences; and signal and targeting sequences. A genetic trait which has been engineered into a particular wheat plant using transformation techniques, could be moved into another line using traditional breeding techniques that are well known in the plant breeding arts. For example, a backcrossing approach could be used to move a transgene from a transformed wheat plant to an elite wheat variety and the resulting progeny would comprise a transgene. As used herein, “crossing” can refer to a simple X by Y cross, or the process of backcrossing, depending on the context. The term “breeding cross” excludes the processes of selfing or sibbing. With transgenic plants according to the present invention, a foreign protein can be produced in commercial quantities. Thus, techniques for the selection and propagation of transformed plants, which are well understood in the art, yield a plurality of transgenic plants which are harvested in a conventional manner, and a foreign protein then can be extracted from a tissue of interest or from total biomass. Protein extraction from plant biomass can be accomplished by known methods which are discussed, for example, by Heney and Orr, Anal. Biochem. 114: 92-6 (1981). According to a preferred embodiment, the transgenic plant provided for commercial production of foreign protein is a wheat plant. In another preferred embodiment, the biomass of interest is seed. A genetic map can be generated, primarily via conventional RFLP, PCR, and SSR analysis, which identifies the approximate chromosomal location of the integrated DNA molecule. For exemplary methodologies in this regard, see Glick and Thompson, METHODS IN PLANT MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY 269-284 (CRC Press, Boca Raton, 1993). Map information concerning chromosomal location is useful for proprietary protection of a subject transgenic plant. If unauthorized propagation is undertaken and crosses made with other germplasm, the map of the integration region can be compared to similar maps for suspect plants, to determine if the latter have a common parentage with the subject plant. Map comparisons would involve hybridizations, RFLP, PCR, SSR, SNPS and sequencing, all of which are conventional techniques. Likewise, by means of the present invention, agronomic genes can be expressed in transformed plants. More particularly, plants can be genetically engineered to express various phenotypes of agronomic interest. Through the transformation of wheat the expression of genes can be modulated to enhance disease resistance, insect resistance, herbicide resistance, water stress tolerance and agronomic traits as well as grain quality traits. Transformation can also be used to insert DNA sequences which control or help control male-sterility. DNA sequences native to wheat as well as non-native DNA sequences can be transformed into wheat and used to modulate levels of native or non-native proteins. Anti-sense technology, various promoters, targeting sequences, enhancing sequences, and other DNA sequences can be inserted into the wheat genome for the purpose of modulating the expression of proteins. Exemplary genes implicated in this regard include, but are not limited to, those categorized below. 1. Genes that Confer Resistance to Pests or Disease and that Encode: (A) Plant disease resistance genes. Plant defenses are often activated by specific interaction between the product of a disease resistance gene (R) in the plant and the product of a corresponding avirulence (Avr) gene in the pathogen. A plant variety can be transformed with cloned resistance gene to engineer plants that are resistant to specific pathogen strains. See, for example Jones et al., Science 266: 789 (1994) (cloning of the tomato Cf-9 gene for resistance to Cladosporium fulvum); Martin et al., Science 262: 1432 (1993) (tomato Pto gene for resistance to Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato encodes a protein kinase); Mindrinos et al., Cell 78: 1089 (1994) (Arabidopsis RSP2 gene for resistance to Pseudomonas syringae); McDowell & Woffenden, (2003) Trends Biotechnol. 21(4): 178-83 and Toyoda et al., (2002) Transgenic Res. 11(6):567-82. A plant resistant to a disease is one that is more resistant to a pathogen as compared to the wild type plant. Fusarium head blight along with deoxynivalenol both produced by the pathogen Fusarium graminearum Schwabe have caused devastating losses in wheat production. Genes expressing proteins with antifungal action can be used as transgenes to prevent Fusarium head blight. Various classes of proteins have been identified. Examples include endochitinases, exochitinases, glucanases, thionins, thaumatin-like proteins, osmotins, ribosome inactivating proteins, flavoniods, lactoferricin. During infection with Fusarium graminearum deoxynivalenol is produced. There is evidence that production of deoxynivalenol increases the virulence of the disease. Genes with properties for detoxification of deoxynivalenol (Adam and Lemmens, In International Congress on Molecular Plant-Microbe Interactions, 1996; McCormick et al. Appl. Environ. Micro. 65:5252-5256, 1999) have been engineered for use in wheat. A synthetic peptide that competes with deoxynivalenol has been identified (Yuan et al., Appl. Environ. Micro. 65:3279-3286, 1999). Changing the ribosomes of the host so that they have reduced affinity for deoxynivalenol has also been used to reduce the virulence of the Fusarium graminearum. Genes used to help reduce Fusarium head blight include but are not limited to Tri101(Fusarium), PDR5 (yeast), tip-1(oat), tip-2(oat), leaf tlp-1 (wheat), tlp (rice), tlp-4 (oat), endochitinase, exochitinase, glucanase (Fusarium), permatin (oat), seed hordothionin (barley), alpha-thionin (wheat), acid glucanase (alfalfa), chitinase (barley and rice), class beta II-1,3-glucanase (barley), PR5/tlp (arabidopsis), zeamatin (maize), type 1 RIP (barley), NPR1 (arabidopsis), lactoferrin (mammal), oxalyl-CoA-decarboxylase (bacterium), IAP (baculovirus), ced-9 (C. elegans), and glucanase (rice and barley). (B) A gene conferring resistance to a pest, such as Hessian fly, wheat, stem soft fly, cereal leaf beetle, and/or green bug. For example the H9, H10, and H21 genes. (C) A gene conferring resistance to disease, including wheat rusts, septoria tritici, septoria nodorum, powdery mildew, helminthosporium diseases, smuts, bunts, fusarium diseases, bacterial diseases, and viral diseases. (D) A Bacillus thuringiensis protein, a derivative thereof or a synthetic polypeptide modeled thereon. See, for example, Geiser et al., Gene 48: 109 (1986), who disclose the cloning and nucleotide sequence of a Bt delta-endotoxin gene. Moreover, DNA molecules encoding delta-endotoxin genes can be purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, Md.), for example, under ATCC Accession Nos. 40098, 67136, 31995 and 31998. Other examples of Bacillus thuringiensis transgenes encoding a endotoxin and being genetically engineered are given in the following patents and patent applications and hereby are incorporated by reference for this purpose: U.S. Pat.

(L) A viral-invasive protein or a complex toxin derived therefrom. For example, the accumulation of viral coat proteins in transformed plant cells imparts resistance to viral infection and/or disease development effected by the virus from which the coat protein gene is derived, as well as by related viruses. See Beachy et al., Ann. Rev. Phytopathol. 28: 451 (1990). Coat protein-mediated resistance has been conferred upon transformed plants against alfalfa mosaic virus, cucumber mosaic virus, tobacco streak virus, potato virus X, potato virus Y, tobacco etch virus, tobacco rattle virus and tobacco mosaic virus. Id. (M) An insect-specific antibody or an immunotoxin derived therefrom. Thus, an antibody targeted to a critical metabolic function in the insect gut would inactivate an affected enzyme, killing the insect. Cf.

(O) A developmental-arrestive protein produced in nature by a pathogen or a parasite. Thus, fungal endo alpha-1,4-D-polygalacturonases facilitate fungal colonization and plant nutrient release by solubilizing plant cell wall homo-alpha-1,4-D-galacturonase. See Lamb et al., Bio/Technology 10: 1436 (1992).

Genes that Confer Resistance to a Herbicide, for Example: (A) Acetohydroxy acid synthase, which has been found to make plants that express this enzyme resistant to multiple types of herbicides, has been introduced into a variety of plants (see, e.g., Hattori et al. (1995) Mol Gen Genet 246:419). Other genes that confer tolerance to herbicides include: a gene encoding a chimeric protein of rat cytochrome P4507A1 and yeast NADPH-cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase (Shiota et al.

Glyphosate resistance is also imparted to plants that express a gene that encodes a glyphosate oxido-reductase enzyme as described more fully in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,776,760 and 5,463,175, which are incorporated herein by reference for this purpose.

No. 4,810,648 to Stalker, and DNA molecules containing these genes are available under ATCC Accession Nos. 53435, 67441 and 67442. Cloning and expression of DNA coding for a glutathione S-transferase is described by Hayes et al., Biochem. J. 285: 173 (1992). (E) Protoporphyrinogen oxidase (protox) is necessary for the production of chlorophyll, which is necessary for all plant survival.

The development of plants containing altered protox activity which are resistant to these herbicides are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,288,306 B1; 6,282,837 B1; and 5,767,373; and international publication WO 01/12825. 3.

See Knultzon et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

(B) Altered phosphorus content, for example, by the (1) Introduction of a phytase-encoding gene would enhance breakdown of phytate, adding more free phosphate to the transformed plant. For example, see Van Hartingsveldt et al., Gene 127: 87 (1993), for a disclosure of the nucleotide sequence of an Aspergillus niger phytase gene.(2) Up-regulation of a gene that reduces phytate content. In maize, this, for example, could be accomplished, by cloning and then re-introducing DNA associated with one or more of the alleles, such as the LPA alleles, identified in maize mutants characterized by low levels of phytic acid, such as in Raboy et al., Maydica 35: 383 (1990) and/or by altering inositol kinase activity as in WO 02/059324, US2003/0009011, WO 03/027243, US2003/0079247, WO 99/05298, U.S. Pat.

Genes that Control Male-Sterility There are several methods of conferring genetic male sterility available, such as multiple mutant genes at separate locations within the genome that confer male sterility, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,654,465 and 4,727,219 to Brar et al. and chromosomal translocations as described by Patterson in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,861,709 and 3,710,511. In addition to these methods, Albertsen et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,432,068, describe a system of nuclear male sterility which includes: identifying a gene which is critical to male fertility; silencing this native gene which is critical to male fertility; removing the native promoter from the essential male fertility gene and replacing it with an inducible promoter; inserting this genetically engineered gene back into the plant; and thus creating a plant that is male sterile because the inducible promoter is not “on” resulting in the male fertility gene not being transcribed. Fertility is restored by inducing, or turning “on”, the promoter, which in turn allows the gene that confers male fertility to be transcribed. (A) Introduction of a deacetylase gene under the control of a tapetum-specific promoter and with the application of the chemical N-Ac-PPT (WO 01/29237). (B) Introduction of various stamen-specific promoters (WO 92/13956, WO 92/13957). (C) Introduction of the barnase and the barstar gene (Paul et al. Plant Mol. Biol. 19:611-622, 1992). For additional examples of nuclear male and female sterility systems and genes, see also, U.S. Pat. No. 5,859,341; U.S. Pat. No. 6,297,426; U.S. Pat. No. 5,478,369; U.S. Pat. No. 5,824,524; U.S. Pat.

Genes that Confer Agronomic Enhancements, Nutritional Enhancements, or Industrial Enhancements. (A) Improved tolerance to water stress from drought or high salt water condition. The HVA1 protein belongs to the group 3 LEA proteins that include other members such as wheat pMA2005 (Curry et al., 1991; Curry and Walker-Simmons, 1993), cotton D-7 (Baker et al., 1988), carrot Dc3 (Seffens et al., 1990), and rape pLEA76 (Harada et al., 1989). These proteins are characterized by 11-mer tandem repeats of amino acid domains which may form a probable amphophilic alpha-helical structure that presents a hydrophilic surface with a hydrophobic stripe (Baker et al., 1988; Dure et al., 1988; Dure, 1993). The barley HVA1 gene and the wheat pMA2005 gene (Curry et al., 1991; Curry and Walker-Simmons, 1993) are highly similar at both the nucleotide level and predicted amino acid level. These two monocot genes are closely related to the cotton D-7 gene (Baker et al., 1988) and carrot Dc3 gene (Seffens et al., 1990) with which they share a similar structural gene organization (Straub et al., 1994). There is, therefore, a correlation between LEA gene expression or LEA protein accumulation with stress tolerance in a number of plants. For example, in severely dehydrated wheat seedlings, the accumulation of high levels of group 3 LEA proteins was correlated with tissue dehydration tolerance (Ried and Walker-Simmons, 1993). Studies on several Indica varieties of rice showed that the levels of group 2 LEA proteins (also known as dehydrins) and group 3 LEA proteins in roots were significantly higher in salt-tolerant varieties compared with sensitive varieties (Moons et al., 1995). The barley HVA1 gene was transformed into wheat. Transformed wheat plants showed increased tolerance to water stress, (Sivamani, E. et al. Plant Science 2000, V.155 p 1-9 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,981,842.) (B) Another example of improved water stress tolerance is through increased mannitol levels via the bacterial mannitol-1-phosphate dehydrogenase gene. To produce a plant with a genetic basis for coping with water deficit, Tarczynski et al. (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 89, 2600 (1992); WO 92/19731, published No. 12, 1992; Science, 259, 508 (1993)) introduced the bacterial mannitol-1-phosphate dehydrogenase gene, mtlD, into tobacco cells via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Root and leaf tissues from transgenic plants regenerated from these transformed tobacco cells contained up to 100 mM mannitol. Control plants contained no detectable mannitol. To determine whether the transgenic tobacco plants exhibited increased tolerance to water deficit, Tarczynski et al. compared the growth of transgenic plants to that of untransformed control plants in the presence of 250 mM NaCl. After 30 days of exposure to 250 mM NaCl, transgenic plants had decreased weight loss and increased height relative to their untransformed counterparts. The authors concluded that the presence of mannitol in these transformed tobacco plants contributed to water deficit tolerance at the cellular level. See also U.S. Pat. No. 5,780,709 and international publication WO 92/19731 which are incorporated herein by reference for this purpose. Numerous methods for plant transformation have been developed, including biological and physical, plant transformation protocols. See, for example, Miki et al., “Procedures for Introducing Foreign DNA into Plants” in Methods in Plant Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, Glick, B. R. and Thompson, J. E. Eds. (CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, 1993) pages 67-88. In addition, expression vectors and in vitro culture methods for plant cell or tissue transformation and regeneration of plants are available. See, for example, Gruber et al., “Vectors for Plant Transformation” in Methods in Plant Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, Glick, B. R. and Thompson, J. E. Eds. (CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, 1993) pages 89-119. Further embodiments of the invention are the treatment of W020016C1 with a mutagen and the plant produced by mutagenesis of W020016C1. Information about mutagens and mutagenizing seeds or pollen are presented in the IAEA's Manual on Mutation Breeding (IAEA, 1977) other information about mutation breeding in wheat can be found in C. F. Konzak, “Mutations and Mutation Breeding” chapter 7B, of Wheat and Wheat Improvement, 2nd edition, ed. Heyne, 1987. A further embodiment of the invention is a backcross conversion of wheat variety W020016C1. A backcross conversion occurs when DNA sequences are introduced through traditional (non-transformation) breeding techniques, such as backcrossing. DNA sequences, whether naturally occurring or transgenes, may be introduced using these traditional breeding techniques. Desired traits transferred through this process include, but are not limited to nutritional enhancements, industrial enhancements, disease resistance, insect resistance, herbicide resistance, agronomic enhancements, grain quality enhancement, waxy starch, breeding enhancements, seed production enhancements, and male steriltiy. Descriptions of some of the cytoplasmic male sterility genes, nuclear male sterility genes, chemical hybridizing agents, male fertility restoration genes, and methods of using the aforementioned are discussed in “Hybrid Wheat by K. A. Lucken (pp. 444-452 In Wheat and Wheat Improvement, ed. Heyne, 1987). Examples of genes for other traits include: Leaf rust resistance genes (Lr series such as Lr1, Lr10, Lr21, Lr22, Lr22a, Lr32, Lr37, Lr41, Lr42, and Lr43), Fusarium head blight-resistance genes (QFhs.ndsu-3B and QFhs.ndsu-2A), Powdery Mildew resistance genes (Pm21), common bunt resistance genes (Bt-10), and wheat streak mosaic virus resistance gene (Wsm1), Russian wheat aphid resistance genes (Dn series such as Dn1, Dn2, Dn4, Dn5), Black stem rust resistance genes (Sr38), Yellow rust resistance genes (Yr series such as Yr1, YrSD, Yrsu, Yr17, Yr15, YrH52), Aluminum tolerance genes (Alt(BH)), dwarf genes (Rht), vernalization genes (Vrn), Hessian fly resistance genes (H9, H10, H21, H29), grain color genes (R/r), glyphosate resistance genes (EPSPS), glufosinate genes (bar, pat) and water stress tolerance genes (Hva1, mtlD). The trait of interest is transferred from the donor parent to the recurrent parent, in this case, the wheat plant disclosed herein. Single gene traits may result from either the transfer of a dominant allele or a recessive allele. Selection of progeny containing the trait of interest is done by direct selection for a trait associated with a dominant allele. Selection of progeny for a trait that is transferred via a recessive allele requires growing and selfing the first backcross to determine which plants carry the recessive alleles. Recessive traits may require additional progeny testing in successive backcross generations to determine the presence of the gene of interest. Another embodiment of this invention is a method of developing a backcross conversion W020016C1 wheat plant that involves the repeated backcrossing to wheat variety W020016C1. The number of backcrosses made may be 2,3,4,5,6 or greater, and the specific number of backcrosses used will depend upon the genetics of the donor parent and whether molecular markers are utilized in the backcrossing program. See, for example, R. E. Allan, “Wheat” in Principles of Cultivar Development, Fehr, W. R. Ed. (Macmillan Publishing Company, New York, 1987) pages 722-723, incorporated herein by reference. Using backcrossing methods, one of ordinary skill in the art can develop individual plants and populations of plants that retain at least 70%, 75%, 79%, 80%, 81%, 82%, 83%, 84%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% of the genetic profile of wheat variety W020016C1. The percentage of the genetics retained in the backcross conversion may be measured by either pedigree analysis or through the use of genetic techniques such as molecular markers or electrophoresis. In pedigree analysis, on average 50% of the starting germplasm would be passed to the progeny line after one cross to another line, 75% after backcrossing once, 87.5% after backcrossing twice, and so on. These percentages are averages and each individual progeny plant may have a different percentage of the parental genome after each cross and/or backcross. And using molecular markers one could determine individuals and select individuals that have a much higher percentage of the recurrent parent at each stage of the backcross process. Molecular markers could also be used to confirm and/or determine the recurrent parent used. Molecular marker assisted breeding or selection may be utilized to reduce the number of backcrosses necessary to achieve the backcross conversion. For example, see Openshaw, S. J. et al., Marker-assisted Selection in Backcross Breeding, In: Proceedings Symposium of the Analysis of Molecular Data, August 1994, Crop Science Society of America, Corvallis, Oreg., where it is demonstrated that a locus conversion can be made in as few as two backcrosses. The backcross conversion or locus conversion developed from this method may be similar to W020016C1 for the results listed in Table 1. Such similarity may be measured by a side by side phenotypic comparison, with differences and similarities determined at a 5% significance level. Any such comparison should be made in environmental conditions that account for the trait being transferred. For example, herbicide should not be applied in the phenotypic comparison of herbicide resistant backcross conversion of W020016C1 when compared back to W020016C1. Another embodiment of the invention is an essentially derived variety of W020016C1 or a locus conversion of W020016C1. As determined by the UPOV Convention, essentially derived varieties may be obtained for example by the selection of a natural or induced mutant, or of a somaclonal variant, the selection of a variant individual from plants of the initial variety, backcrossing, or transformation by genetic engineering. An essentially derived variety of W020016C1 is further defined as one whose production requires the repeated use of variety W020016C1 or is predominately derived from variety W020016C1. International Convention for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants, as amended on Mar. 19, 1991, Chapter V, Article 14, Section 5(c). A locus conversion refers to plants within a variety that have been modified in a manner that retains the overall genetics of the variety and further comprises one or more loci with a specific desired trait, such as male sterility, insect, disease or herbicide resistance. Examples of single locus conversions include mutant genes, transgenes and native traits finely mapped to a single locus. One or more locus conversion traits may be introduced into a single wheat variety. As used herein, the phrase ‘comprising a’ transgene, transgenic event or locus conversion means one or more transgenes, transgenic events or locus conversions. This invention also is directed to methods for using wheat variety W020016C1 in plant breeding. One such embodiment is the method of crossing wheat variety W020016C1 with another variety of wheat to form a first generation population of F1 plants. The population of first generation F1 plants produced by this method is also an embodiment of the invention. This first generation population of F1 plants will comprise an essentially complete set of the alleles of wheat variety W020016C1. One of ordinary skill in the art can utilize either breeder books or molecular methods to identify a particular F1 plant produced using wheat variety W020016C1, and any such individual plant is also encompassed by this invention. These embodiments also cover use of transgenic or backcross conversions of wheat variety W020016C1 to produce first generation F1 plants. A method of developing a W020016C1-progeny wheat plant comprising crossing W020016C1 with a second wheat plant and performing a breeding method is also an embodiment of the invention. A specific method for producing a line derived from wheat variety W020016C1 is as follows. One of ordinary skill in the art would cross wheat variety W020016C1 with another variety of wheat, such as an elite variety. The F1 seed derived from this cross would be grown to form a homogeneous population. The F1 seed would contain one set of the alleles from variety W020016C1 and one set of the alleles from the other wheat variety. The F1 genome would be made-up of 50% variety W020016C1 and 50% of the other elite variety. The F1 seed would be grown and allowed to self, thereby forming F2 seed. On average the F2 seed would have derived 50% of its alleles from variety W020016C1 and 50% from the other wheat variety, but various individual plants from the population would have a much greater percentage of their alleles derived from W020016C1 (Wang J. and R. Bernardo, 2000, Crop Sci. 40:659-665 and Bernardo, R. and A. L. Kahler, 2001, Theor. Appl. Genet 102:986-992). The F2 seed would be grown and selection of plants would be made based on visual observation and/or measurement of traits. The W020016C1-derived progeny that exhibit one or more of the desired W020016C1-derived traits would be selected and each plant would be harvested separately. This F3 seed from each plant would be grown in individual rows and allowed to self. Then selected rows or plants from the rows would be harvested and threshed individually. The selections would again be based on visual observation and/or measurements for desirable traits of the plants, such as one or more of the desirable W020016C1-derived traits. The process of growing and selection would be repeated any number of times until a homozygous W020016C1-derived wheat plant is obtained. The homozygous W020016C1-derived wheat plant would contain desirable traits derived from wheat variety W020016C1, some of which may not have been expressed by the other original wheat variety to which wheat variety W020016C1 was crossed and some of which may have been expressed by both wheat varieties but now would be at a level equal to or greater than the level expressed in wheat variety W020016C1. The homozygous W020016C1-derived wheat plants would have, on average, 50% of their genes derived from wheat variety W020016C1, but various individual plants from the population would have a much greater percentage of their alleles derived from W020016C1. The breeding process, of crossing, selfing, and selection may be repeated to produce another population of W020016C1-derived wheat plants with, on average, 25% of their genes derived from wheat variety W020016C1, but various individual plants from the population would have a much greater percentage of their alleles derived from W020016C1. Another embodiment of the invention is a homozygous W020016C1-derived wheat plant that has received W020016C1-derived traits. The modified pedigree selection method of breeding was used to derive this line from elite germplasm. The first cross was made in 1996 and breeding continued until August 2008. W020016C1 represents a significant advancement in elite germplasm adapted to the United States. The previous example can be modified in numerous ways, for instance selection may or may not occur at every selfing generation, selection may occur before or after the actual self-pollination process occurs, or individual selections may be made by harvesting individual spikes, plants, rows or plots at any point during the breeding process described. In addition, double haploid breeding methods may be used at any step in the process. The population of plants produced at each and any generation of selfing is also an embodiment of the invention, and each such population would consist of plants containing approximately 50% of its genes from wheat variety W020016C1, 25% of its genes from wheat variety W020016C1 in the second cycle of crossing, selfing, and selection, 12.5% of its genes from wheat variety W020016C1 in the third cycle of crossing, selfing, and selection, and so on. Another embodiment of this invention is the method of obtaining a homozygous W020016C1-derived wheat plant by crossing wheat variety W020016C1 with another variety of wheat and applying double haploid methods to the F1 seed or F1 plant or to any generation of W020016C1-derived wheat obtained by the selfing of this cross. Still further, this invention also is directed to methods for producing W020016C1-derived wheat plants by crossing wheat variety W020016C1 with a wheat plant and growing the progeny seed, and repeating the crossing or selfing along with the growing steps with the W020016C1-derived wheat plant from 1 to 2 times, 1 to 3 times, 1 to 4 times, or 1 to 5 times. Thus, any and all methods using wheat variety W020016C1 in breeding are part of this invention, including selfing, pedigree breeding, backcrossing, hybrid production and crosses to populations. Unique starch profiles, molecular marker profiles and/or breeding records can be used by those of ordinary skill in the art to identify the progeny lines or populations derived from these breeding methods. Another embodiment of this invention is the method of harvesting the grain of variety wheat variety W020016C1 and using the grain as seed for planting. Embodiments include cleaning the seed, treating the seed, and/or conditioning the seed. Cleaning the seed includes removing foreign debris such as weed seed and removing chaff, plant matter, from the seed. Conditioning the seed can include controlling the temperature and rate of dry down and storing seed in a controlled temperature environment. Seed treatment is the application of a composition to the seed such as a coating or powder. Some examples of compositions are insecticides, fungicides, pesticides, antimicrobials, germination inhibitors, germination promoters, cytokinins, and nutrients.
