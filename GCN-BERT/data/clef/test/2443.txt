INORGANIC COMPOSITE COATINGS COMPRISING NOVEL FUNCTIONALIZED ACRYLICS Related Applications [0001] NONE. Statement Regarding Federally Sponsored Research [0002] NONE Field of the Invention [0003] This invention relates generally to anti-corrosion protective coatings and, more particularly, to anti-corrosion protective coating compositions that are sol-gel compositions comprising one or more silanol precursors, a silane hydrolysis promoting acid and an acrylic-based co-polymer comprising nitrogen-containing organic functional groups and methods of making and using same, as well as metals coated using the compositions. Background of the Invention [0004] Untreated metal surfaces are subject to corrosion which can lead to rust development, weakening, discoloration and failure of the surface. Thus metal substrates are typically treated by a variety of methods to make the surface less reactive and more corrosion resistant. In addition, metal surfaces are often subsequently coated with decorative or additional protective coatings such as resin coatings, primers, paints and other surface treatments. [0005] One common mechanism of corrosion occurs galvanically when atmospheric oxygen oxidizes the metal of a metal substrate. The transfer of electrons from the metal to the oxygen at electrocatalytic sites leads to formation of various metal oxide corrosion products. A variety of treatments can be used to prevent corrosion of metal surfaces such as cold rolled steel, hot rolled steel, zinc, aluminum, and alloys thereof, zinc- and zinc alloy-coated steel, as well as aluminum- and aluminum alloy-coated steel. These treatments include temporary oil-based rust preventatives, phosphate conversion coatings, inorganic and organic passivates, paints, and combinations thereof. [0006] Temporary oil-based rust preventatives are used to provide short-term corrosion protection with ease of removal. They are not desirable for medium- or long-term corrosion protection alone, and when combined with other coatings make the surfaces unpaintable and by the nature of their handling are not suitable for a final consumer product. [0007] Phosphate conversion coatings provide better corrosion protection and paintability, but require quite acidic conditions to operate, which is not desirable due to difficulty in handling the application chemicals, more troublesome waste treatment due to sludge generation, and extra wear on equipment. Such conversion coatings typically require subsequent treatments for maximum benefit. [0008] Inorganic and organic passivates, such as those commonly applied to metal coil stock, provide a high degree of corrosion protection but possess several drawbacks. Many such products either contain chromium, are highly acidic, or both. Chromiumcontaining coatings and passivates are not desirable due to negative environmental considerations and more troublesome waste treatment. Highly acidic treatments also tend to degrade processing equipment and pose concerns with worker exposure. [0009] Another issue for coatings is the development of yellowing or a yellow hue in the coating after heat treatment of a coated substrate or other common treatments including exposure to alkaline cleaners, phosphating solutions or solvents. [00010] It is highly desirable to create compositions that are effective corrosion protective coatings without these negative issues. Applicants have developed a sol-gel coating composition that reduces or eliminates one or more of the foregoing draw backs.

[00017] In one embodiment the nitrogen-containing organic functional groups are generally present on the acrylic-based co-polymer in an amount of preferably 1-10% by weight based on total weight of the nitrogen-containing organic functional group relative to total weight of the acrylic-based co-polymer on a dry solids basis.

Desirably the contacting step may immediately follow a galvanizing treatment and the metal surface contacted comprises galvanized metal. [00021] In one embodiment during at least a portion of drying step c., the metal surface has a peak metal temperature ranging from about 40 °C to about 150 °C. [00022] In one embodiment the present invention includes a coated metal substrate comprising: a. at least one metal surface; b. deposited on and chemically adhered to said at least one metal surface an organic-inorganic composite coating comprising reaction products of the sol-gel composition with the metal surface and products of condensation of the sol-gel, optionally comprising vanadium.

Detailed Description [00028] A sol-gel coating composition according to the invention comprises at least one silanol precursor component; an acrylic-based co-polymer comprising nitrogen-containing organic functional groups; at least one hydrolysis promoting acid capable of causing hydrolysis of the silanol precursor component; and optionally one or more other components such as corrosion inhibitors, surfactants and additives which find use in sol-gel coatings in general. “Silanol precursor component” as used herein is intended to describe precursor compositions which hydrolyze to fonn silanols in the sol-gel forming reaction, which compositions are be further described below. [00029] The sol-gel compositions of the present invention can provide electrically conductive dried-in-place coatings and are especially useful for electronics applications. The inventive compositions are also useful for coating metal substrates used for appliances, architectural and other uses, especially for fonning coatings over zinc and zinc alloy coated substrates. [00030] Coating formulations described herein are sol-gel based coatings as the term is widely understood in the art. Such coatings can be prepared by combining silanol precursors, such as silanes, for example organosilanes, in water in the presence of a catalyst, such as acid, to produce silanols via a hydrolysis reaction. Silanols are subject to condensation to form oligomeric constituents, thereby generating a sol-gel. [00031] As noted above, one component of the sol-gel is an acrylic-based co-polymer that includes nitrogen-containing organic functional groups. The acrylic-based co-polymer may' be present in an amount of from 10 to 35% by weight based on the total weight of the sol-gel composition excluding the weight of water and solvents. The excluded weights include any water or solvents brought in with any of the other components. [00032] ’’Acrylic" refers to a variety of ethylenically unsaturated monomers and co-monomers that may be co-polymerized to form the acrylic-based co-polymer. The resulting co-polymer may comprise a variety of methacrylate ester monomers, acrylate ester monomers, styrene and alpha-methylstyrene, acrylonitrile and methacrylonitrile monomers. Other co-monomers such as methylenebutyrolactone, vinylpyrrolidinone, chloroprene, vinyl acetate may also be incorporated in lesser amounts. [00033] The acrylic-based co-polymer can include any polymerizable ethylenically unsaturated monomers such as acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, acrylate and (meth)acrylate monomers and often also includes vinyl monomers such as styrene. The term (meth)acrylate will be understood by those of skill in the art to be a generic term referring to acrylate and/or methacrylate. Examples of (meth)acrylate monomers that can be used, without limitation, include methacrylate, methyl methacrylate, 2 ethylhexyl acrylate, n-butyl methacrylate, hydroxyethyl methacrylate, acetoacetoxyethyl methacrylate, butyl acrylate, and other esters of acrylic acid and methacrylic acid. The co-monomers can also include acrylamide and derivatives such as acrylonitrile. Acrylamide and Acrylonitrile are not included within the group defined as monomers bearing nitrogen-containing organic functional groups. Nitrogens of these monomers are not included in any calculation of quantity of nitrogen-containing organic functional groups on the acrylic-based co-polymer according to the invention. [00034] Nitrogen-containing organic functional groups may be imparted to an acrylic-based co-polymer in a number of ways. A monomer bearing a nitrogen-containing organic functional group may be polymerized directly. Especially preferred functional monomers are N-allyl-thiourea, 4-methyl-5-vinylthiazole and 1-vinyl-imidazole. Alternatively a nitrogen-containing organic functional group may result from a derivative reaction of a precursor functional group Ζ and the derivation can be carried out before, during, or after polymerization. Functional group Ζ can be introduced as an endgroup on a polymerizable monomer, or it can be introduced as an endgroup or pendant group on an oligomer such as a hydrophobe within a mini-emulsion polymerization. [00035] In one embodiment, Ζ is either a substituted 1,2-dicarbonyl compound, or a primary amine and the nitrogen-containing organic functional group is an imidazole formed by reaction of the 1,2-dicarbonyl compound with ammonia and aldehyde to form an unsubstituted imidazole or reaction of a 1,2 dicarbonyl compound with a primary amine and ammonia, which is an adaptation of the Debus-Radziszewski imidazole synthesis, to form a substituted imidazole. In one embodiment an acrylic-based co-polymer comprising group Ζ is first prepared after which Ζ is converted to a nitrogen-containing organic functional in a subsequent derivation reaction. [00036] The nitrogen-containing organic functional groups on the acrylic-based co-polymer may be any combination comprising carbon atoms and nitrogen atoms which provides improved corrosion resistance to the sol-gel coating. In one embodiment, the nitrogen-containing organic functional groups comprise a nitrogen atom and at least one additional heteroatom selected from a second nitrogen atom, an oxygen atom and a sulfur atom. [00037] Particular improvements in performance were noted in sol-gel coating wherein the nitrogen-containing organic functional groups were selected from thioureas, thiazoles, and imidazoles. As used herein “thioureas”, “thiazoles” and “imidazoles” will be understood by those of skill in the art to mean functional groups based on one of the chemical compounds thiourea, thiazole and imidazole and bonded to the acrylic-based polymer. Functional groups based on substituted thiourea, thiazole and imidazole compounds are also included in the meaning of these tenns provided that these substituted functional groups do not unduly interfere with the objects of the invention. [00038] The nitrogen-containing organic functional groups are generally present on the acrylic-based co-polymer in an amount of about 0.5 to 15%, preferably 1-10% and more preferably 2 to 6% by weight based on total weight of the nitrogen-containing organic functional group relative to total weight of the acrylic-based co-polymer on a dry solids basis. The combination of styrene, if included, acrylic monomer and nitrogen-containing organic functional groups may be chosen to form a co-polymer with a theoretical glass transition temperature (Tg) of from 0 to 50° C, more preferably from 20 to 40° C, and most preferably from 25 to 35° C. [00039] Additional optional functional monomers that can be used in the co-polymer include components that are either reactive during drying of the coating or that promote adhesion to overcoats within multi-layered coating applications. Non-limiting examples of these components include monomers having silanol functional groups such as methacryloxypropyl-tris-(2-propoxy)silane; monomers having carboxyl groups bearing ethylenic unsaturation such as unsaturated di-acids like maleic acid, and itaconic acid and mono-esters of unsaturated di-acids like mono-butylitaconate. Methods for polymerization of acrylic-based co-polymers are well known in the art. [00040] Polymerization initiators include conventional free radical initiators such as hydrogen peroxide; organic hydroperoxides such as t-butyl hydroperoxide, cumene hydroperoxide, t-amyl hydroperoxide; ammonium and/or alkali persulfates; organic peroxides such as t-butyl perpivalate, t-butyl perbenzoate, benzoyl peroxide, di(n-propyl) peroxydicarbonate, acetyl cyclo-hexylsulfonyl peroxide, and the like; typically these are used at levels of from 0.05 to 3.0% by weight based on the weight of total monomer. Redox systems using the same initiators coupled with a suitable reductant, for example: reducing sugars such as isoascorbic acid, sodium bisulfite, sodium thiosulfate, hydroxyl- amine, hydrazine, sodium hydrosulfite, and sodium formaldehyde sulfoxylate, can be used at similar levels. Often these are used in conjunction with a metal catalyst such as salts of transition metals, examples of which are iron sulfate, copper sulfate, vanadium sulfate, and the like. Additionally, non-oxidizing thermal initiators such as 2,2'-Azo-bis-isobutyronitrile, 4,4'-Azo-bis(4-cyanopentanoic acid), 2,2’-Azo-bis(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride, and the like can be used. [00041] The sol-gel composition according to the present invention further includes use of a mixture of silanol precursors. A variety of silanes are useful in the present invention, as silanol precursors, suitable examples include alkoxysilanes such as silicic acid esters, alkylalkoxysilanes and organoftinctional silanes. Organofunctional silanes can include epoxysilanes, mercaptosilanes and aminosilanes and the like. [00042] Examples of silicic acid esters include tetramethoxysilane, tetraethoxysilane and tetrapropoxysilane and the like.

[00047] Desirably the silanol precursors include tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS), methyltriethoxysilane (MTES), 3-glycidyloxypiOpyltriethoxysilane, and additional alkoxysi lanes. [00048] The silanol precursors are preferably presenf in an amount of from 55 to 85% by weight based on the total weight of the sol-gel composition excluding the weight of water and solvents. The excluded weights include any water or solvents brought in with any of the other components. The sol-gel is formed by combining the silanol precursors with a silane hydrolysis promoting acid. In making sol-gel coating compositions according to the invention it is desirable to combine the acrylic-based co-polymer, described above, with at least one silanol precursor in the presence of a silane hydrolysis promoting acid with stirring to form the final sol-gel coating composition. [00049] At least one hydrolysis promoting acid capable of causing hydrolysis of the silanol precursor component is desirable for forming the sol-gel coating composition. Hydrolysis promoting acids include any organic or inorganic acid capable of hydrolyzing the aforedescribed silanes to form silanols which do not interfere with the formation or performance of the coating. Examples of preferred acids include acetic acid, phosphoric acid, fluoroacids such as fluorzirconic acid and fluorotitanic acid. [00050] The other components forming the sol-gel include acids used to promote hydrolysis of the silanol precursors and optionally surfactants and/or corrosion inhibitors. Preferably these other components comprise from 5 to 20% by weight based on the total weight of the sol-gel composition excluding the weight of water and solvents. The excluded weights include any water or solvents brought in with any of the other components. [00051] Other materials which can be incorporated during formation of the sol-gel include inorganic nanoparticles, such as Si02 based nanoparticles, additional polymer dispersions or emulsions, surfactants, co-solvents, and other additives. [00052] The surfactants can include anionic, nonionic, amphoteric surfactants and mixtures thereof. Non-limiting representative classes of anionic surfactants include alkyl sulfates, alkyl and alkylaryl ether sulfates, sulfonates, and phosphate esters. Nonionic surfactants include but are not limited to ethoxylated alcohols and ethoxylated amides. Representative non-limiting examples of amphoteric surfactants include imidazoline based surfactants with di-sodium cocoamphodipriopionate as one preferred example. Preferred levels of active nonionic surfactants are from 1 to 6% by weight based on total monomer weight. Preferred levels of active anionic surfactants are from 0.25 to 2.0% by weight based on the total monomer weight. Preferred levels of active amphoteric surfactant are from 1 to 4% by weight based on total monomer weight. [00053] Other additives may include corrosion inhibitors such as vanadium containing compounds such as vanadium sulfate, molybdates, or chromium compounds, preferably in the absence of hexavalent chromium, in the sol-gel composition. When used the corrosion inhibitors are added to the mixture of silanol precursors and acrylic-based co-polymer. [00054] The present invention provides a high level of corrosion resistance and yellowing resistance when deposited on bare metal surfaces. “Bare metal” means a metal surface in the absence of pre-treatment chemicals, such as metal phosphating solutions, chromium-containing rinses, or other passivating treatments or reaction products of the pre-treatment chemicals with other substances or each other. Typical bare metal surfaces comprise metals of the substrate in a zero oxidation state, and sometimes these zero oxidation state metals are covered at least partially by native oxides of metals from the substrate that have been oxidized, often by oxygen from the air. [00055] Alternatively sol-gel compositions may also be used over conventional pretreatments. In one embodiment, the sol-gel is applied over an electrolytically deposited oxide coating, for example titanium dioxide or zirconium oxide, chemically adhered to an underlying metal surface, for example aluminum or aluminum alloys. [00056] The sol-gel coating composition is suitable for application to a variety of substrates including ferrous metal, for example steels including cold rolled steel, hot rolled steel, and stainless steel; aluminum and alloys thereof; zinc and alloys thereof; steel coated with zinc, aluminum, zinc alloys or aluminum alloys, for example electrogalvanized steel, GALVALUME®, GALVANNEAL®, hot-dipped galvanized steel. The present invention is preferred for use on steel coated with zinc, aluminum, zinc alloys or aluminum alloys, for example hot dipped galvanized steel and electrogalvanized steels. [00057] The metal surface may be cleaned prior to application of a sol-gel coating composition according to the invention. In some applications, such as a galvanizing line within a mill, the sol-gel coating may be applied in a continuous fashion following the galvanizing step such that no separate cleaning operation is required. In other applications, a cleaning step prior to application of a sol-gel coating composition may be used to remove contaminants such as soils or oils. Cleaning of metal surfaces is known in the art and can include mild or strongly alkaline and/or acidic cleaners. Examples of cleaners include PARCO® CLEANER ZX-1 and PARCO® CLEANER 315, both commercially available from Henkel Corporation. Following any cleaning step, the cleaned metal surface may be rinsed with water prior to treatment according to the present invention. The compositions of the invention are then applied to metal surfaces and dried in place to form thin, adherent protective coatings. [00058] Methods for applying dry in place sol-gel coating compositions of the present invention include dry in place coating methods, spray application, roll coating, dip or bath coating, drawbar coating and the like. Drying may be achieved under any number of conditions including room temperature of 10-30°C. Application of heat is generally preferred to reduce drying time. Heat may be provided at least partially by a warm substrate or by passing through heating zones, such as ovens. In one embodiment, the composition is applied by roll coating or draw bar coating. [00059] The sol-gel coating compositions of the present invention are preferably applied to provide a dried in place amount of from 70 to 600 milligrams per square foot; more preferably at a level of from 80 to 300 milligrams per square foot; and most preferably at a level of from 80 to 200 milligrams per square foot. The applied coatings can be dried in place using a peak metal temperature of from 43° C to 150° C; more preferably from 70° C to 130° C; and most preferably from 90° C to 110° C. One of the issues facing use of coating compositions is that often the coatings show yellowing especially after heat treatments. The present coating compositions reduce this tendency for yellowing. Examples [00060] Three functionalized acrylic-based co-polymer emulsions were prepared in accordance with the present invention, in addition a non-functionalized aery lie-based co-polymer emulsion was created as a control. The formulas are provided below in Table 1 in terms of grams of component added. [00061] Parts A and Α1 were added to a 1 liter flask equipped with stirrer and nitrogen inlet and heated to 70° C. Pre-emulsion Β was prepared as follows. Part Β1 components were mixed to a clear solution. Part Β2 components were combined and mixed. Part Β1 was added to part Β2 with mixing to form a uniform pre-emulsion Β. The components of parts Cl, C2, Dl, and D2 were all mixed separately to form uniform solutions. At 70°C, 5% of pre-emulsion Β, 25% of part Cl and 25% of part C2 were added to the flask. After 20 minutes, the remainder of pre-emulsion Β, the remainder of part C1 and the remainder of part C2 were added at a uniform rate over 3 hours to the flask. Upon completion of these additions, the deionized water flush was run through the pre-emulsion pump into the flask. Then, parts Dl and D2 were added at a unifonn rate over 30 minutes to the flask. Upon completion of the additions, the flask was maintained at 70° C for one additional hour and then cooled to room temperature.

Vanadium sulfate was subsequently added to four of the compositions. The formulas for the sol-gel coating compositions without vanadium sulfate are provided below in Table 2, and the sol-gel coating compositions with vanadium sulfate are provided below in Table 3, all amounts are in grams of component added. [00063] The coating compositions without vanadium sulfate were formed as follows: Mixture 1 components were combined and stirred at 750 rpm for 20 minutes. Components of Mixture 2 were combined and swirled together to mix them. Mixture 2 was then added to Mixture 1, stirring rate was increased to 900 rpm and mixing was continued for 6 hours. After the 6 hours, Mixture 3 was added to the Mixture 1/Mixture 2 combination with continued stirring. The coating compositions with vanadium sulfate were made in the same manner with Mixture 4 added after Mixture 3.

The sample panels were first hand wash cleaned with the metal cleaner RIDOLINE® 1559 at a level of 5% at room temperature followed by two tap water rinses. The cleaner is available from Henkel Corporation. The coating compositions were dried in place using a peak metal temperature of 93.3° C. The coated panels were then subjected to a variety of tests. [00065] In a first testing protocol, duplicate panels were subjected to a neutral salt spray (NSS) test according to ASTM Β117-03. Two panels of each composition were tested and were visually rated for visible face-rust (expressed as a percentage of coated surface) at 24 hour intervals. Ratings were made until the extent of race-rust for all panels within the set exceeded 10%. The results for an average of the two panels of each condition are presented below in Table 5 in terms of % facerust at the selected time points for the panels. The results clearly show the advantage of the functionalized acrylic-based co-polymers over the control acrylic-based co-polymer in terms of extending the corrosion protection time in the test. The results also show that the addition of vanadium sulfate causes a large increase in the corrosion protection of the coating composition, even in non-functionalized acrylic-based co-polymer tests. In the coating compositions prepared according to the present invention the addition of vanadium sulfate dramatically increases the life of the panels in the NSS test.

One of the issues that often arises with coating compositions for metal substrates is that exposure of a coated substrate to heat, phosphates, alkaline solutions or solvents such as methyl ethyl ketone (ΜΕΚ) or ethanol can lead to a yellowing in the color of the coating. Often coated substrates are exposed to these conditions during handling, thus it is desirable to create coatings that either do not show yellowing or wherein the yellowing is reduced. [00067] For evaluating color values of coatings, a typical color scale used in the industry is the three dimensional Hunter L, a, b color scale. This scale can be determined for a sample using a color analyzer such as the Chroma Meter CR-300 from Minolta. The value L is the lightness axis with a value of 0 equal to black and a value of 100 equal to white. The value a is the red-green axis with positive values being red, negative values being green and 0 being neutral. The value b is the yellow-blue axis with positive values being yellow, negative values being blue and 0 being neutral. Thus, in evaluating the color values of a sample before and after a test protocol if the AL is positive the sample is lighter than before the test protocol. If the Aa is positive the sample is more red, if negative then more green. If the Ab is positive then the sample is more yellow, if negative then more blue. [00068] The Τ, a, b color difference can also be expressed as a single value, AE. This value defines the size of the total color difference, but does not give information about how the colors differ. The larger the AE the larger the color difference, it is given by the following equation: AE = v(AL)2 + (Aa)2 + (Ab)2 . [00069] For each of the below color tests, a fresh set of sol-gel coated panels were used. [00070] Rebake Color Testing: In a first color testing protocol, panels prepared as described above were subjected to a rebake cycle of 1 hour at 240° C for four cycles. The color values L, a, and b were measured from the panels before and after the rebake cycle testing. This test is designed to simulate conditions that can occur during processing of metal substrates. The color values were measured using a color analyzer Chroma Meter CR-300 from Minolta. The color value from the panels before and after the rebake cycle testing and the difference are presented below in Table 6.

Across all coatings it can be seen that the treatment causes a shift toward yellow in the color, all of the b values are positive after treatment. There are not large differences in the effect across the various coating compositions. The presence of vanadium sulfate causes a larger yellow shift to occur across the coating compositions prepared according to the present invention with less of a shift in the control coating composition. Thus, the presence of vanadium, while it positively increases the corrosion resistance, this comes at the cost of an increase in color change associated with rebaking cycles. There is also a green shift associated with the treatment and the presence of vanadium sulfate also increases this shift. Finally, there is a darkening effect following treatment and vanadium sulfate makes this effect greater. [00072] Alkaline Color Test: In a second color test, the test panels were subjected to the alkaline cleaner Ridoline® 336 at a 3% concentration for 3 minutes at 50° C. The cleaner is an alkaline borate cleaner available from Henkel Corporation. The color values before testing were determined and then the panels were exposed to the cleaner, rinsed and dried. Then the color values were again determined. The results are presented below in Table 7.

The control sol-gel coating composition and the thiazole functionalized acrylic-based co-polymer comprising sol-gel coating compositions are the least affected. In the presence of vanadium sulfate there is a general shift toward yellow except for the thiourea coating composition which still has a shift toward blue although less than in the absence of vanadium sulfate. The treatment also generally causes a lightening of the overall color except in the control composition in the absence of vanadium sulfate. There is also some tendency toward a red shift in the treated samples. [00074J Zinc Phosphating Color Testing: In a next color test, the panels were exposed to a zinc phosphating conversion coating solution at 40° C for 3.5 minutes, then rinsed and dried. The color values before and after treatment were measured and the values are reported in Table 8 below Table 8: Zinc Phosphating Color Test Coating Composition Initial L Initial a Initial b Final L Final a Final b AL Aa Ab AE Thiourea 77.43 -1.77 -2.40 75.86 -2.24 -1.36 -5.00 -0.06 2.56 5.62 Thiourea plus VOS04 78.55 -1.42 -2.30 76.82 -1.12 0.12 -1.73 0.30 2.42 2.99 Thiazole 77.89 -2.93 -1.60 74.21 -3.24 0.89 -3.68 -0.31 2.49 4.45 Thiazole plus VOSO4 78.72 -1.41 -1.92 78.46 -1.20 -2.75 -0.26 ' 0.21 0.83 0.89 Imidazole 77.50 -2.58 -1.90 74.30 -2.96 0.29 -3.20 -0.38 2.19 3.90 Imidazole plus VOSO4 77.06 -2.09 -1.51 75.11 -1.74 -0.04 -1.95 0.35 1.47 2.47 Control 78.36 -2.85 -1.23 73.79 -3.06 1.96 -4.57 -0.21 3.19 5.58 Control plus VOSO4 78.03 -2.74 -1.95 74.25 -3.68 0.40 -3.78 -0.94 2.35 4.55 [00075] The results of this treatment are more mixed and do not follow the previous trends. In the absence of vanadium sulfate there was a shift toward yellow in all the coating compositions except the thiourea functionalized acrylic-based co-polymer comprising sol-gel coating composition. The effect was greatest in the control coating composition. In this test the vanadium sulfate actually reduced the yellow color shift compared to coatings without vanadium. Again the coating compositions according to the present invention cause less yellow color shift that the control sol-gel coatings. [00076] ΜΕΚ Color Testing: In a next color test, the effect of the solvent methyl ethyl ketone (ΜΕΚ) on the color was tested. The panels were initially color measured and then subjected to 20 forward and backward rubs with a cloth saturated with ΜΕΚ at a 1 kilogram load of pressure on the cloth. The samples were rinsed, dried and the color changes measured. The results are presented below in Table 9.

The overall color changes were small. [00078] Ethanol Color Testing: In a next color test the effect of a 80% solution of ethanol in deionized water on the color was tested. The panels were initially color measured and then subjected to 20 forward and backward rubs with a cloth saturated with a 80% ethanol solution at a 1 kilogram load of pressure on the cloth.

The overall color changes were small. [00080] Overall, color performance testing showed sufficient resistance to yellowing of the coatings, compared to the control despite addition of the acrylic-based co-polymer comprising nitrogen-containing functional groups to improve corrosion resistance. [00081] The present invention provides a new series of sol-gel compositions containing an acrylic-based co-polymer comprising nitrogen-containing functional groups that find use as anti-corrosion protection coatings. The sol-gel comprises a mixture of silanol precursors in addition to a co-polymer that is acrylic-based and includes a nitrogen-containing organic functional group, preferably selected from thioureas, thiazoles, and imidazoles. The preferred functional groups are N-allyl-thiourea. 4-methyl-5-vinylthiazole and 1-vinyl-imidazole. The sol-gel also can include vanadium sulfate or other corrosion inhibitors to enhance corrosion protection in addition to surfactants. [00082] The foregoing invention has been described in accordance with the relevant legal standards, thus the description is exemplary rather than limiting in nature.
