FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides a process for preparing amorphous Cabazitaxel from the solvate form of Cabazitaxel selected from diisopropyl ether solvate, ethyl acetate solvate, acetone solvate, ethanol solvate, monohydrate or dihydrate form of Cabazitaxel. The present invention further relates to diisopropyl ether solvate form of Cabazitaxel (I), and process for preparation thereof. Also this application presents pharmaceutical composition comprising crystalline diisopropyl ether solvate of Cabazitaxel or amorphous Cabazitaxel as an active pharmaceutical ingredient, wherein the pharmaceutical composition is having anti-cancer activity. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION (2α,5β,7β,10β,13α)-4-acetoxy-13-({(2R,3S)-3[(tert-butoxycarbonyl)amino]-2-hydroxy-3-phenylpropanoyl}oxy)-1-hydroxy-7,10-dimethoxy-9-oxo-5,20-epoxytax-11-en-2-yl benzoate is the chemical name of Cabazitaxel (Ia)— Cabazitaxel as its acetone solvate was approved by USFDA as JEVTANA™ and is chemically mentioned in the label as (2α,5β,7β,10β,13α)-4-acetoxy-13-({(2R,3S)-3[(tert-butoxy-carbonyl)amino]-2-hydroxy-3-phenylpropanoyl}oxy)-1-hydroxy-7,10-dimethoxy-9-oxo-5,20-epoxytax-11-en-2-yl benzoate-propan-2-one (1:1) solvatomorph (Cabazitaxel:acetone). Cabazitaxel is a white to off-white powder and is lipophilic in nature, practically insoluble in water. Bouchard et al in U.S. Pat. No. 5,847,170 provided the first disclosure of (2α,5β,7β,10β,13α)-4-acetoxy-13-({(2R,3S)-3 [(tertbutoxycarbonyl)amino]-2-hydroxy-3-phenylpropanoyl}oxy)-1-hydroxy-7,10-dimethoxy-9-oxo-5,20-epoxytax-11-en-2-yl benzoate (also known as Cabazitaxel), also describing the process for preparing Cabazitaxel. Kung Liang-Rern et al in US2012149925A1 disclosed a process for preparing Cabazitaxel by reacting beta-lactam side chain with a protected baccatin derivative in the presence of one or more Lewis acids and a base agent, wherein Lewis acid may be selected from LiBr, MgBr2, CsBr, ZnBr2, ZnCl2, CuBr, Cu(CF3SO4)2, BF3.OEt2, KBr, TiCl4, SnCl2, ScCl3, VCl3, AlCl3, InCl3, Al2CO3, CeCl3, Ag2O, ZnClO4, LiClO4, Ti{OCH(CH3)2}4 or any combination thereof. The Cabazitaxel form mentioned in the USFDA label as (2α,5β,7β,10β,13α)-4-acetoxy-13-({(2R,3S)-3 [(tert-butoxy-carbonyl)amino]-2-hydroxy-3-phenylpropanoyl}oxy)-1-hydroxy-7,10-dimethoxy-9-oxo-5,20-epoxytax-11-en-2-yl benzoate-propan-2-one (1:1) solvatomorph (Cabazitaxel:acetone) is designated as Form-A in EMEA scientific discussion as well as in the subsequent patent U.S. Pat. No. 7,241,907, which also describes its process for preparation by crystallization from an aqueous/acetone solution. It appears from the literature that in order to achieve therapeutic role, it is Cabazitaxel base molecule that plays the active role and not necessarily its solvates as long as stable solvate or base form is known to exist. In line with this, US 20120301425A1 (Eq. WO 2011051894A1) on page 2 mentions that—‘Cabazitaxel may be administered in base form, or in the form of a hydrate. It may also be a solvate, i.e. a molecular complex characterized by the incorporation of the crystallization solvent into the crystal of the molecule of the active principle (see in this respect page 1276 of J. Pharm. Sci. 1975, 64(8), 1269-1288). In particular, it may be an acetone solvate, and, more particularly, may be the solvate described in WO 2005/02846. It may be an acetone solvate of Cabazitaxel containing between 5% and 8% and preferably between 5% and 7% by weight of acetone (% means content of acetone/content of acetone+cabazitaxelχ100). An average value of the acetone content is 7%, which approximately represents the acetone stoichiometry, which is 6.5% for a solvate containing one molecule of acetone.’ Billot Pascal et al in U.S. Pat. No. 8,378,128 appear to cover many crystalline forms, which includes crystalline forms as anhydrides, solvates and ethanol hetero-solvates and hydrates forms of Cabazitaxel. The disclosure in this application provides nearly 11 new polymorphic forms-which include five (5) new crystal forms of Cabazitaxel anhydrous material designated as Form B, C, D, E, F, which are characterized by—Form B-DSC MP. 150° C., Form C-DSC MP. 146° C., Form D-DSC MP. 175° C., Form E-DSC MP. 157° C. and Form F-DSC MP. 148° C. along with their characteristic XRPD pattern. It also disclosed four new crystal forms of ethanolate and heterosolvate of Cabazitaxel designated as Form B Ethanolate, Form D Ethanolate, Form E Ethanolate, and Form F Ethanolate/Water heterosolvate. Two hydrate forms of Cabazitaxel i.e. Form C as Monohydrate and Form C as Dihydrate are also part of the disclosure. This patent specification also mentioned that only Form D anhydrous is highly stable even more stable that acetone solvate form (Form A). Simo et al in WO2012142117 A1 also disclosed different polymorphic forms of Cabazitaxel-Form I i.e. toluene solvate, Form II i.e. methyl tert-butyl ether (“MTBE”) solvate, Form III i.e. 2-propanol solvate, Form IV i.e. n-butanol solvate and Form V i.e. 1-propanol solvate. Recently Henschke et al in US2013065955 A1 provided several crystalline forms of Cabazitaxel designated as Form C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, C6, C7, C8, C9, C8b and C9p. This patent application also disclosed that crystalline Form C1 is an anhydrous isopropanol solvate of Cabazitaxel, Form C8b is a monohydrate DMSO solvate and crystalline Form C9p is a monohydrate acetic acid solvate of Cabazitaxel. Further, crystalline polymorphs of Cabazitaxel have been disclosed by Lahiri et al in WO2013080217 A2. The different polymorphs disclosed have been referred to as Form-1, Form-2, Form-3, Form-4, Form-5, Form-6, Form-7, Form-8, Form-9, Form-10, Form-11, Form-12, and Form-13. Didier et al in WO2013088335 A1 have provided crystalline ethyl acetate solvate form of the 4α-acetoxy-2α-benzoyloxy-5β, 20-epoxy-1β-hydroxy-7β,10β-dimethoxy-9-oxo-11-taxen-13α-yl(2R,3S)-3-tert-butoxycarbonylamino-2-hydroxy-3-phenylpropionate, which is defined as Form A. Also amorphous form of Cabazitaxel has been disclosed in some recent applications for e.g. WO2012142117 A1 which provides a powdery, non-foamy form of Cabazitaxel, WO2013111157 A1 which provides a non-solvated amorphous form of Cabazitaxel and WO2013065070 A1. Existence of polymorphism is known to be a unique phenomenon in solid materials, wherein existence of different physical forms including shape, size, and arrangement of molecules in the physical state or polymorphs of same compound are known in the nature. A single compound, or a salt complex, may give rise to a variety of solids having distinct physical properties, which may result in substantial differences in bioavailability, stability, and other differences between production lots of formulated pharmaceutical products. Due to this reason, since polymorphic forms can vary in their chemical and physical properties, Regulatory Authorities often require that efforts to be made to identify all stable polymorphic forms e.g., hydrate or anhydrate, crystalline or amorphous, solvated or un-solvated forms, etc. of the drug substances. However, the existence and possible numbers of polymorphic forms for a given compound cannot be predicted. It is imperative that—adequate scientific diligence/efforts are required to explore new salts/solvates and other polymorphs for the same compound already known to exist in nature. There are no “standard” procedures known to exists that can be used to prepare polymorphic forms of a substance. Hence, besides identification of the different polymorphic forms of a compound, concern has always remained for the process of preparation of these polymorphic forms. Inventors of the present application thus provide a process for preparing amorphous Cabazitaxel from the solvate forms of Cabazitaxel, wherein the process appears to be highly efficient, cost-effective, industrially amenable to scale up, solves purity/compliance related issues and overcomes the drawbacks of various prior disclosed processes, e.g., multiple solvent combinations as well as multiple steps. Exploring novel solvate/polymorphic forms of pharmaceutically active/useful compounds always provide a further opportunity to improve the drug performance characteristics of such product. In continuation of our endeavor to find new solvate/polymorphic forms of Cabazitaxel, inventors of the present application provide a new stable solvate form of Cabazitaxel, which is diisopropyl ether solvate of Cabazitaxel. Diisopropyl ether solvate of Cabazitaxel is very stable and retains its characteristic properties on long term storage also, wherein the physicochemical properties remain substantially the same. This stable form further offers various advantages in terms of favorable impurity profile, flowability, solubility, morphology, crystal habit, minimal polymorphic conversion, low hygroscopicity, low content of residual solvents and ease of formulation.

A solution of crystalline Cabazitaxel solvate form in solvent methanol or 2-methoxyethanol is provided at temperature ranging between 20-30° C. The reaction mixture obtained is maintained under stirring at a temperature ranging from 10-35° C. In one of the particular embodiment, stirring of the reaction mass was done at temperature of 25-30° C. Stirring of the reaction mass is done for the time duration ranging between 10 to 60 minutes; however, depending upon the progress of the reaction—it may extend in order to achieve the complete dissolution. The temperature of the reaction solution obtained above is raised to 40-60° C. In a particular embodiment, the temperature of reaction solution obtained was raised to 50-55° C. The solution is optionally maintained for time duration of 20-60 minutes at the raised temperature of 40-60° C. The time duration of stirring depends upon the progress of the reaction, which is checked intermittently during the reaction. The reaction mixture is optionally filtered and then the solvent is recovered at a temperature above 40° C., till dryness is achieved in the reaction material. This is followed by isolation of amorphous Cabazitaxel. In a preferred embodiment solvent recovery is performed by distillation. In certain observations by inventors of the present application, it was also found that removing the solvent incompletely (i.e. removing at least 60-90% of the total solvent used) followed by adding an anti-solvent having higher boiling point at temperature above 40° C. may also result in amorphous form of Cabazitaxel, which may have composition of amorphous up to at least 95%. The amorphous Cabazitaxel obtained is characterized by X-ray powder diffraction pattern as per FIG. 1 indicating a solid form that lacks the long-range order (a characteristic of crystal) and having no pattern or structure. The process parameters illustrated above, may be suitably utilized for conversion of various Cabazitaxel solvate forms to amorphous form of Cabazitaxel, employing variations to the process as per requirements. The said solvate form of Cabazitaxel may be selected from diisopropyl ether solvate, ethyl acetate solvate, acetone solvate, ethanol solvate, monohydrate or dihydrate form of Cabazitaxel. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention solvate form of Cabazitaxel used to prepare amorphous Cabazitaxel is diisopropyl ether solvate form of Cabazitaxel. In one embodiment of the present application, it provides diisopropyl ether solvate of Cabazitaxel (I), wherein the diisopropyl ether solvate of Cabazitaxel exists as a crystalline form designated as Form-SD, which is characterized by X-ray powder diffraction pattern comprising at least 8 characteristic diffraction angle peaks selected from the XRPD peak set of 7.5, 7.7, 8.6, 13.5, 14.2, 15.0, 17.5, 19.9, 21.7, 21.8, 22.9 and 23.4±0.2 2θ° and DSC isotherm comprising at least one endothermic peak ranging between 145 to 160° C. In another embodiment of the present application, diisopropyl ether solvate of Cabazitaxel (I) obtained as crystalline Form-SD is further characterized by IR absorption spectrum having characteristic peaks expressed in cm−1 at approximately 3542 cm−1, 3376 cm−1, 2977 cm−1, 2823 cm−1, 1721 cm−1, 1601 cm−1, 1520 cm−1, 1169 cm−1 and 848 cm−1. In a further embodiment of the present application, the diisopropyl ether solvate of Cabazitaxel (I) obtained as crystalline Form-SD according to the process of the present invention is characterized by— i. X-ray powder diffraction pattern comprising at least 8 characteristic diffraction angle peaks selected from the XRPD peak set of 7.5, 7.7, 8.6, 13.5, 14.2, 15.0, 17.5, 19.9, 21.7, 21.8, 22.9 and 23.4±0.2 2θ°.ii. DSC isotherm comprising the endothermic peak ranging between 145 to 160° C.iii. IR absorption characteristic peaks at approximately 3542 cm−1, 3376 cm−1, 2977 cm−1, 2823 cm−1, 1721 cm−1, 1601 cm−1, 1520 cm−1, 1169 cm−1 and 848 cm−1. In another embodiment of the present application, substantially pure diisopropyl ether solvate of Cabazitaxel (I) obtained as crystalline Form-SD exhibits an X-ray powder diffraction pattern as shown in FIG. 2, DSC isothermal pattern as shown in FIG. 3 and IR absorption spectrum as shown in FIG. 4. The characteristic peaks and their d-spacing values of the new crystalline Form-SD are tabulated in the Table-1. S.

Further possible variations may also be expected for the relative peak intensities, which may be largely affected by the non-uniformity of the particle size of the sample. Hence, identification of the exact crystalline form of a compound should be based primarily on observed 2 theta angles with lesser importance attributed to relative peak intensities. The 2 theta diffraction angles and corresponding d-spacing values account for positions of various peaks in the X-ray powder diffraction pattern. D-spacing values are calculated with observed 2 theta angles and copper K α wavelength using the Bragg equation well known to those of having skill in the art of XRPD diffractometry science. In view of possibility of marginal error in the assigning 2 theta angles and d-spacing, the preferred method of comparing X-ray powder diffraction patterns in order to identify a particular crystalline form is to overlay the X-ray powder diffraction pattern of the unknown form over the X-ray powder diffraction pattern of a known form. For example, one skilled in the art can overlay an X-ray powder diffraction pattern of an unidentified crystalline form of Cabazitaxel over FIG. 2 and readily determine whether the X-ray diffraction pattern of the unidentified form is substantially the same as the X-ray powder diffraction pattern of the crystalline Form-SD of this invention. If the X-ray powder diffraction pattern is substantially the same as FIG. 2, the previously unknown crystalline form of Cabazitaxel can be readily and accurately identified as the crystalline Form-SD of this invention. The new stable crystalline form of Cabazitaxel designated as Form-SD which is characterized by X-ray powder diffraction pattern as shown in FIG. 2, DSC isothermal pattern as shown in FIG. 3 and IR absorption spectrum as shown in FIG. 4, is diisopropyl ether Solvate of Cabazitaxel (I), wherein diisopropyl ether content ranges from 8-12% w/w. As an illustrative example, 10% w/w diisopropyl ether content shall be construed as 10 g of diisopropyl ether in 100 g of final API i.e. diisopropyl ether Solvate of Cabazitaxel (I). The diisopropyl ether content in the final API form can be estimated by analytical techniques well known in the art for e.g. by TGA, Gas Chromatography etc. Diisopropyl ether Solvate of Cabazitaxel (I) has been found to be quite stable and easy to handle and store for longer time without any measurable change in its morphology and physicochemical characteristics, while retaining its characteristics within the defined limits. This offers advantages for large scale manufacturing in terms of handling, storage, shelf life and favorable impurity profile. In another embodiment of the present application, it provides process for preparing diisopropyl ether Solvate of Cabazitaxel (Form-SD), comprising the steps of: a) Providing a solution of Cabazitaxel in an organic solvent;b) Adding diisopropyl ether to the reaction mixture;c) Subjecting the reaction mixture to continuous stirring at temperature ranging between 25 to 55° C.;d) Filtering the solid material from reaction mass and washing it with diisopropyl ether;e) Optionally repeating the steps a) to d);f) Isolating crystalline diisopropyl ether Solvate of Cabazitaxel (Form-SD). The individual steps of the process according to the present invention for preparing diisopropyl ether Solvate of Cabazitaxel (Form-SD) are detailed separately herein below: Step a) comprises providing a solution of Cabazitaxel in an organic solvent; Solution of Cabazitaxel is provided in an organic solvent at an ambient temperature of ˜25° C. Cabazitaxel used as starting material in this reaction may be of any form or purity level, solvated or non-solvated, crystalline or amorphous and may be obtained from any source/method known in the prior art. Organic solvent used this reaction may be selected from C1-C4 alcohol, DMSO or DMF. Amount of organic solvent used to provide the solution of Cabazitaxel ranges from 2 to 8 times in volume (in mL) w.r.t. the amount of Cabazitaxel used (in g). The solution of Cabazitaxel in the organic solvent is obtained by stirring for time duration ranging from 5 mins to 1 hr depending upon the dissolution obtained. Optionally the temperature of the reaction mixture may be increased to a temperature above 35° C. to somewhat concentrate the reaction mixture, by distillation. Step b) comprises adding diisopropyl ether to the reaction mixture; To the reaction mixture obtained in step a) addition of diisopropyl ether is performed. Amount of diisopropyl ether added to the reaction mixture may vary from 2 to 40 times in volume (in mL) w.r.t. the amount of Cabazitaxel initially used (in g). Addition of diisopropyl ether to the reaction mixture may be performed at ambient temperature of ˜25° C. or at a raised temperature of more than 35° C. Addition of diisopropyl ether to the reaction mixture may be performed in a single lot or in more no. of batches. Rate of addition of diisopropyl ether to the reaction mixture may be controlled as per requirement to achieve final end product characteristics. In a preferred embodiment addition of diisopropyl ether to the reaction mixture was performed slowly over a period of 40 mins. Step c) comprises subjecting the reaction mixture to continuous stirring at temperature ranging between 25 to 55° C.; The reaction mixture obtained in step b) is subjected to continuous stirring for a period of 30 mins to 2 hrs. Temperature of the reaction mixture while being stirred may be maintained at an ambient temperature of ˜25° C. or at a raised temperature of up to 55° C. Speed of stirring of the reaction mixture may be controlled as per requirement to achieve final end product characteristics. When the reaction mass is stirred at temperature of more than 35° C., after completion of the reaction as is checked intermittently on regular intervals, the reaction mixture is allowed to cool to an ambient temperature of ˜25° C. Cooling is performed slowly and may span over time duration of 45 mins to 2 hrs. The reaction mixture obtained after cooling may optionally be again subjected to continuous stirring for a period of 30 mins to 2 hrs. Step d) comprises filtering the solid material from reaction mass and washing it with diisopropyl ether Solid material obtained in the reaction mass achieved in step c) is filtered. Filtration may be performed by using any conventional method which is known to the person skilled in art. The solid material obtained after filtration is washed with diisopropyl ether. Optionally washing of the filtered solid material by diisopropyl ether, may be preceded by another washing with mixture of diisopropyl ether and an organic solvent. Organic solvent used in this reaction may be same or different from the organic solvent used in step a). Step e) comprises optionally repeating the steps a) to d) The reaction steps a) to d) may be optionally repeated so as to achieve the final end product characteristics and purity levels. Thus, the solid Cabazitaxel material obtained in step d) may be re-dissolved to get a solution of Cabazitaxel in an organic solvent, followed by raising the temperature of the reaction mixture above 35° C., slowly adding diisopropyl ether to the reaction mixture, subjecting the reaction mixture to continuous stirring; cooling of the reaction mixture and again filtering the solid material from reaction mass and washing it with diisopropyl ether. In view of maintaining the equilibrium to the impurity profile compliance, the process may require in-process quality checks to avoid unnecessary repetitions of the same process steps. Step f) comprises isolating crystalline diisopropyl ether Solvate of Cabazitaxel (I). The solid material obtained from step d) or e) is subjected to drying for a time duration ranging between 30 mins to 6 hrs. Drying may be performed at RT or at a raised temperature of 35° C. or above. Other parameters of drying may be suitably controlled for e.g. if required drying may also be carried out under reduced pressure conditions which may be suitably utilized by a person skilled in the art. Process of isolating diisopropyl ether Solvate of Cabazitaxel (Form-SD) comprise processes but not limited to conventional processes including scrapping, if required filtering from slurry, use of anti-solvents, and optional drying which may be carried out at room temperature for the suitable durations. The end-product obtained after drying in step f) is directly obtained as diisopropyl ether solvate of Cabazitaxel (I) in the form of a crystalline material. This crystalline diisopropyl ether solvate of Cabazitaxel (I) is designated as Form-SD, which is having purity of greater than 99% by HPLC. The process related impurities, including unreacted intermediates, side products, degradation products and other medium dependent impurities, that appear in the impurity profile of the Cabazitaxel may be substantially removed by the process of the present invention resulting in the formation of pure crystalline Cabazitaxel diisopropyl ether solvate (Form-SD). Diisopropyl ether solvate of Cabazitaxel (I) is found to be a very stable crystal lattice which is adequately stable to handle and store for longer time without any significant or measurable change in its morphology and physicochemical characteristics. This stable form thus, offers various advantages in terms of storage, shelf life and favorable impurity profile. Also the process of the present invention is industrially or commercially suitable and amenable for up scaling and formulation development. The amorphous form of Cabazitaxel and crystalline Form-SD of Cabazitaxel described herein may be characterized by X-ray powder diffraction pattern (XRPD) and Thermal techniques such as differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis. The said samples of Cabazitaxel were analyzed by XRPD on a Bruker AXS D8 Advance Diffractometer using X-ray source—Cu Kα radiation using the wavelength 1.5418 Å and lynx Eye detector. DSC was done on a Perkin Elmer Pyris 7.0 instrument. Illustrative examples of analytical data for the amorphous form of Cabazitaxel obtained from a solvate form of Cabazitaxel and the diisopropyl ether Solvate of Cabazitaxel (Form-SD) are set forth in the FIGS. 1-7. In a further embodiment according to the specification, the invention also relates to a composition containing diisopropyl ether Solvate of Cabazitaxel (I) or amorphous Cabazitaxel. In yet another embodiment of the invention, the composition may be substantially free of any other known forms of Cabazitaxel. Composition containing diisopropyl ether Solvate of Cabazitaxel (I) or amorphous Cabazitaxel may offer a better pharmacological profile as compared to the prior art known forms. The diisopropyl ether Solvate of Cabazitaxel (I) or amorphous Cabazitaxel obtained by the process of the present application may be formulated as solid compositions for oral administration in the form of capsules, tablets, pills, powders or granules.
