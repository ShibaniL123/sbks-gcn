Step 4. 3-Bromo-8-chloro-6-(trifluoromethyl)imidazo[1,2-a]pyrazine
To a solution of 8-chloro-6-(trifluoromethyl)imidazo[1,2-a]pyrazine (0.37 g, 1.7 mmol) in DMF (11 mL) was added N-bromosuccinimide (0.30 g, 1.7 mmol). The reaction mixture was heated at 60° C. for 2 h. The reaction mixture was cooled to rt and poured into 40% sat. Na2S2O3 (50 mL). The aqueous mixture was then extracted with DCM (3×40 mL). The combined organic layers were washed with brine (75 mL), dried over Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated. Purification via silica gel chromatography (10-40% EtOAc/hexanes) afforded the title compound as a white solid (0.41 g, 82%). LCMS for C7H3BrClF3N3 (M+H)+: calculated m/z=299.9, 301.9; found 299.9, 301.8.
