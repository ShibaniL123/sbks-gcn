Preparation of tert-butyl (2,6-difluoro-3-nitrophenyl)carbamate (C377)
To a solution of tert-butyl-N-((tert-butoxy)carbonyl)-N-(2,6-difluoro-3-nitrophenyl)carbamate (C190) (2.60 g, 6.60 mmol) in ethyl acetate (66 mL) was added trifluoroacetic acid (7.60 g, 66.0 mmol). The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 5 days. Additional trifluoroacetic acid (6.02 g, 52.3 mmol) was added, and the reaction mixture was stirred for an additional 5 days. The reaction mixture was transferred to a separatory funnel and washed successively with saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution until the pH of the organic layer was 3. The organic layer was then washed with brine, passed through a phase separator to dry and concentrated. Purification by column chromatography using 0 to 20% ethyl acetate/hexanes as eluent afforded the title compound as a light yellow solid (1.32 g, 73%):
