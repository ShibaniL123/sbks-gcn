Technical Field The present invention relates to an ionic liquid comprised of a Bronsted acid and a Bronsted base, a lubricating agent containing the ionic liquid, and a magnetic recording medium using the lubricating agent. Background Art Conventionally, in a thin film magnetic recording medium, a lubricating agent is applied onto a surface of a magnetic layer in order to reduce friction and wear between a magnetic head and a surface of the medium. An actual film thickness of the lubricating agent is at the molecular level in order to avoid adhesion such as stiction. Therefore, it's no exaggeration to say that the most important thing in the thin film magnetic recording medium is to select a lubricating agent having excellent wear resistance under every environment. It is important to allow the lubricating agent remain on the surface of the medium without detachment, spin-off, or chemical deterioration throughout a service life of the magnetic recording medium. The more difficult it is to allow the lubricating agent remain on the surface of the medium, the smoother the surface of the thin film magnetic recording medium is. This is because the thin film magnetic recording medium has no ability for replenishing the lubricating agent, unlike a coating type magnetic recording medium. In the case where the lubricating agent is only weakly adhered to a protecting film on the surface of the magnetic layer, a large quantity of lubricating agent is required because the film thickness of the lubricating agent is decreased upon heating or sliding to thereby accelerate wear. The large quantity of lubricating agent results in a migrating lubricating agent which can have the ability for replenishing the lubricating agent removed through wear. However, there is a dilemma that an excess of lubricating agent causes the film thickness of the lubricating agent to be greater than surface roughness to thereby cause a problem related to adhesion, and eventually the stiction contributing to drive failure, which is fatal. The problem related to friction has not been satisfyingly solved by conventional perfluoropolyether (PFPE) based lubricating agents. Particularly, in a thin film magnetic recording medium having high surface smoothness, a novel lubricating agent has been molecularly designed and synthesized in order to solve the trade-off. Many reports on a lubricating property of PFPE have been submitted. Thus, the lubricating agent is very important for the magnetic recording medium. Table 1 shows chemical structures of representative PFPE based lubricating agents. Table 1Fomblin based lubricating agentsX-CF2(OCF2CF2)n(OCF2)mOCF2-X (0.5<n/m<1)ZX=-OCF3Z-DOLX=-CH2OHZ-DIACX=-COOHZ-TetraolAM2001Other lubricating agentsA20HMonoF-(CF2CF2C2)1-CF2CF2CH2-N(C3H7)2 Z-DOL in Table 1 is one of commonly used lubricating agents for thin film magnetic recording media. Z-tetraol (ZTMD) is those in which a functional hydroxyl group is additionally introduced in a main chain of PFPE, which has been reported to enhance reliability of the drive while reducing gap of a head-media interface. A20H has been reported to prevent the main chain of PFPE from being decomposed by a Lewis acid or a Lewis base, and improve tribological characteristics. Meanwhile, Mono has a different polymeric main chain and polar group from the above described PFPE, that is, polynormal propyloxy and amine, respectively; and has been reported to decrease adhesive interactions in near contact. However, a common solid lubricating agent which is believed to have a high melting point and thermal stability interferes with highly sensitive electromagnetic conversion process and deteriorates wear characteristics due to wear debris produced in a running track when the agent is scraped by the head. The liquid lubricating agent as described above has a migrating property which is an ability in which a lubricating agent removed through wear is replenished with a lubricating agent migrated from the adjacent lubricating layer. However, due to the migrating property, the lubricating agent is decreased by spin-off from the surface of the disk during disk operation especially under a high temperature, so that a protective function is lost. Therefore, a lubricating agent having high viscosity and low volatility has been suitably used, which allows for low evaporation rate and long service life of the disk drive. In view of these lubricating mechanisms, a low friction and low wear lubricating agent used in the thin film magnetic recording medium is required to have the following requirements: (1) low volatility;(2) low surface tension for surface replenishing ability;(3) interaction between a terminal polar group and a surface of a disk;(4) high thermal and oxidative stability to prevent decomposition or a decrease during use;(5) chemically inert to metal, glass, and polymer, and no wear debris produced by a head or a guide;(6) no toxicity or flammability;(7) excellent boundary lubricating property; and(8) solubility in organic solvents. Recently, an ionic liquid has been attracting attention as one of environmental friendly solvents for synthesizing organic or inorganic materials in electricity storage materials, separation technologies, and catalyst technologies. The ionic liquid is broadly categorized into a molten salt having a low melting point, and generally refers to the molten salt having the melting point of 100°C or lower. Important properties of the ionic liquid used as the lubricating agent include low volatility, no flammability, thermal stability, and excellent solubility. Therefore, the ionic liquid is expected to be applied as a novel lubricating agent under an extreme environment such as in vacuum or in a high temperature due to its characteristic. It has also been known that use of the ionic liquid in a gate of a single self-assembled quantum dot transistor improves the controllability of the transistor by a factor of one hundred over a conventional one. In this technique, the ionic liquid forms an electric double layer and serves as an about 1 nm-thick insulating film to thereby obtain a large electric capacity. For example, use of a certain ionic liquid may reduce friction and wear on a metal or ceramic surface in comparison to a conventional hydrocarbon based lubricating agent. For example, it has been reported that, in the case where an imidazole cation based ionic liquid is synthesized by replacing with a fluoroalkyl group, and alkylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate or hexafluorophosphate is used on steel, aluminium, copper, single crystal SiO2, silicon, or sialon ceramics (Si-Al-O-N), it shows more excellent tribological characteristics than cyclic phosphazene (X-1P) or PFPE. It has also been reported that an ammonium based ionic liquid reduces friction in from elastohydrodynamic to boundary lubrication region compared with a base oil. In addition, an ionic liquid has examined for an effect as an additive for the base oil, or researched on a chemical and tribological chemical reaction in order to understand its lubricating mechanism. However, there are few application examples as the magnetic recording medium. Among ionic liquids, a protic ionic liquid is a generic designation of compounds formed through a chemical reaction between a Bronsted acid and a Bronsted base in equal amounts. Research by Kohler et al. related to an interaction between carboxylic acid and amine has been reported a 1:1 complex of carboxylic acid and amine in chemically equal amounts can be formed (e.g., see NPLs 1 and 2). Perfluorooctanoic acid alkyl ammonium salt is the protic ionic liquid (PIL), and has been reported to have an effect of reducing friction in the magnetic recording medium significantly higher than the above described Z-DOL (see, PTLs 1 and 2, and NPLs 3 to 5). However, these perfluorocarboxylic acid ammonium salts have a weak interaction between a cation and an anion in the reaction shown by the following Reaction scheme (A). Therefore, the equilibrium is shifted towards left side under a high temperature in accordance with Le Chatelier's law to thereby produce dissociated neutral compounds, leading to thermal instability. That is, proton transfer occurs under the high temperature and the equilibrium is shifted towards the neutral substance to thereby dissociate (e.g., see NPL 6). The limit of a surface recording density of a hard disk is said to be 1 Tb/in2 to 2.5 Tb/in2. At present, the limit is being approached, but energetic development has been continued for increasing a capacity on the assumption of refining magnetic particles. The technologies for increasing the capacity include decreasing effective flying height or introducing Shingle Write (BMP). Additionally, "Heat Assisted Magnetic Recording" is known as a next-generation recording technology. FIG. 3 is a schematic view illustrating the heat assisted magnetic recording. In the technology, a recording portion is heated with laser upon recording/reproduction, and therefore, there is a problem that durability is deteriorated due to evaporation or decomposition of the lubricating agent on a surface of the magnetic layer. In the heat assisted magnetic recording, the magnetic recording medium may be exposed to a high temperature which is said to be 400°C or higher even in a short time. Therefore, commonly used lubricating agents for the thin film magnetic recording media, Z-DOL and a carboxylic acid ammonium salt based lubricating agent, are concerned about their thermal stability. The ionic liquid is generally a substance having high thermal stability because it forms ions as described above. The equilibrium thereof is shown in the following Scheme 1. In the above Scheme, HA denotes a Bronsted acid, and B denotes a Bronsted base. The acid (HA) and the base (B) react with each other as shown in Scheme 1 to thereby form a salt (A-HB+). Herein, the dissociation constants Ka1 and Kb2 of the acid and the base can be shown by the following Scheme 2 using concentrations thereof. The Ka1 and the Kb2 vary widely depending on substances, and, in some cases, they have the large number of digits. However, the large number of digits is inconvenient for handling, so that it is often expressed as the negative common logarithm. That is, as shown in the following Scheme 3, it is defined that -log10 Ka1 is equal to pka1. Obviously, the smaller pKa1 is, the stronger the acidity is. Next, the difference between the dissociation constants of the acid and the base, ΔpKa, will be discussed. A reaction between an acid and a base is influenced by their acidity or basicity (or acidity of a conjugate acid), and the difference of acidity ΔpKa can be shown by the following Scheme 3. As can be seen from the above Scheme, the ΔpKa becomes larger as the salt concentration [A-HB+] becomes larger relative to the acid and base concentrations. In particular, Yoshizawa et al. have been reported that, when the difference between the pKa value of the acid and the pKa value of the base (ΔpKa) is 10 or more, the proton transfer is more likely to occur, and [AH] + [B] ↔ [A-HB+] the equilibrium is shifted towards an ion side (right side) to thereby enhance stability (e.g., see NPL 6). However, MacFarlane et al. have been reported that the proton transfer occur and an ionized PIL can be obtained as long as the ΔpKa is at least 4 (e.g., see NPL 7). Dai et al. have been described that, based on an energy level diagram, thermal stability of the protic ionic liquid can be greatly improved by combining a strong acid with a strong base (e.g., see NPL 8). Watanabe et al. have reported that proton transferability and thermal stability of the protic ionic liquid greatly depend on ΔpKa, and, therefore, when DBU (1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene) is used as the base, the ionic liquid is greatly improved in the thermal stability by using an acid having a pKa value so as to give the ΔpKa of 15 or more (e.g., see NPL 9). However, it has not been sufficiently discussed what level of ΔpKa is required for a certain application.

Description of Embodiments Hereinafter, embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to figures in the following order. 1. Lubricating agent and ionic liquid2. Magnetic recording medium3. Examples <1. Lubricating agent and ionic liquid> A lubricating agent given as one embodiment of the present invention contains an ionic liquid represented by the general formula X-B+, and uses, as a Bronsted base (B), a compound containing a linear hydrocarbon group preferably having 10 or more carbon atoms (e.g., ammonium salt). An ionic liquid in embodiments of the present invention is a protic ionic liquid synthesized through neutralization between a Bronsted acid (HX) and a Bronsted base (B). This ionic liquid can exert an excellent thermal stability resulting from a difference between a pKa value of the Bronsted acid in water and a pKa value of the Bronsted base in water (ΔpKa: pKa value of Bronsted base minus pKa value of Bronsted acid) of 12 or more. The ionic liquid can also exert an excellent thermal stability resulting from a difference between a pKa value of the Bronsted acid in acetonitrile and a pKa value of the Bronsted base in acetonitrile (ΔpKa: pKa value of Bronsted base minus pKa value of Bronsted acid) of 6 or more. Note that, the pKa values in acetonitrile is described in, for example, Blackwell Scintific Publications, Oxford, 1990, and J. Org. Chem. 2011, Vol. 76, pp. 391-395. Watanabe et al. have reported that proton transferability and thermal stability of a protic ionic liquid greatly depend on ΔpKa, and, therefore, when DBU (1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene) is used as a base, the ionic liquid is greatly improved in the thermal stability by using an acid having a pKa value so as to give the ΔpKa of 15 or more (Miran, M.S., Kinoshita, H., Yasuda, T., Susan, M.A.B.H., Watanabe, M., Physicochemical Properties Determined by ΔpKa for Protic Ionic Liquids Based on an Organic Super-strong Base with Various Bronsted Acids, Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., Vol 14, pp. 5178-5186 (2012)). However, it has not been sufficiently discussed what level of ΔpKa is required for a certain application. The present inventors conducted extensive studies and have found that thermal stability mechanisms are different depending on the numerical values of ΔpKa. It has been confirmed by TG/DTA analysis that, in the case of small ΔpKa, weight loss of the ionic liquid is endothermic and due to evaporation, while, in the case of large ΔpKa, weight loss of the ionic liquid is exothermic and predominantly due to thermal decomposition. Accordingly, the present inventors found that an ionic liquid having a difference between a pKa value of a Bronsted acid in water and a pKa value of a Bronsted base in water (ΔpKa: pKa value of Bronsted base minus pKa value of Bronsted acid) of 12 or more exerts an excellent thermal stability and is useful as a lubricating agent. The present inventors also found that an ionic liquid having a difference between a pKa value of a Bronsted acid in acetonitrile and a pKa value of a Bronsted base in acetonitrile (ΔpKa: pKa value of Bronsted base minus pKa value of Bronsted acid) of 6 or more exerts an excellent thermal stability and is useful as a lubricating agent. As used herein, pKa refers to an acid dissociation constant, i.e., an acid dissociation constant in water or an acid dissociation constant in acetonitrile. The acid dissociation constant in water can be measured, for example, with reference to the method described in J. Chem. Res., Synop. 1994, 212-213. Specifically, it can be measured by a combination of a spectrometer with potentiometry. Although the acid dissociation constant in acetonitrile is not described herein because it is described in J. Org. Chem. 1998, 63, p. 7868 or J. Org. Chem. 1997, 62, p. 8479, it can be obtained by dissolving an acid in acetonitrile, titrating the resultant with a base, and measuring a spectrum by means of a UV-vis spectrometer. The ionic liquid has an excellent solubility in a highly volatile solvent such as lower alcohols (alcohols containing 1 to 3 carbon atoms) and ethers. Therefore, the ionic liquid can be easily formed into a solution when it is used. Also, the solvent can be easily removed when the solution is applied and used. A compound of the present invention has a long chain alkyl group. Therefore, it has a relatively high melting point, can be produced through recrystallization, and can be very easily produced. An exothermic peak temperature of the ionic liquid determined by a differential thermal analysis (DTA) measurement is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose, but is preferably 370°C or higher, more preferably 400°C to 500°C from the viewpoint of exerting excellent thermal stability. The differential thermal analysis can be performed, for example, as follows. The measurement is performed in a temperature range of 30°C to 600°C at a heating rate of 10°C/min while introducing air at a flow rate of 200 mL/min using EXSTAR 6000 (manufactured by Seiko Instruments Inc.). As a gas chromatography mass spectrometer, 6890/5975 MSD (manufactured by Agilent Technologies, Inc.) was used. The following measurement conditions are used: column: DB-1 (15 m, diameter: 0.25 mm, membrane thickness: 0.1 µm); injection temperature: 280°C; column temperature: initial temperature of 40°C, hold for 5 min, heated to 340°C at the heating rate of 20°C/min, and hold at the same temperature; mass spectrometric unit: 5975MSD; MS detection mode: EI+; quadrupole temperature: 150°C; ion source temperature: 300°C; mass scanning range: m/z 33-700; and calibration: PFTBA. The upper limit of the ΔpKa in water is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose, but the ΔpKa in water is preferably 25 or less, more preferably 21 or less. The upper limit of the ΔpKa in acetonitrile is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected depending on the intended purpose, but the ΔpKa in acetonitrile is preferably 40 or less, more preferably 35 or less. The Bronsted acid satisfying the following condition is used: the difference between the pKa value of the Bronsted acid (HX) in water and the pKa value of the Bronsted base (B) in water is 12 or more. Also, the Bronsted acid satisfying the following condition is used: the difference between the pKa value of the Bronsted acid (HX) in acetonitrile and the pKa value of the Bronsted base (B) in acetonitrile is 6 or more. Such Bronsted acid may be a super acid described in J. Org. Chem. 2005, Vol. 70, p. 1019.

Chem. 2005, Vol. 70, pp. 1019-1028.

It is needless to say that the structure of the amines are not limited thereto. For example, the amines may be those in which a hydrocarbon chain is introduced into a heterocyclic compound, an alicyclic compound, or an aromatic compound. Additionally, a compound represented by the following Structural Formula (1), a compound represented by the following Structural Formula (2), and a compound represented by the following Structural Formula (3) are also preferably used. An ionic liquid containing the aliphatic amine as the Bronsted base is represented by the following General Formula (1): In General Formula (1), at least of R1, R2, R3, and R4 is a hydrogen atom, and at least one of R1, R2, R3, and R4 is a group which contains a linear hydrocarbon group having 10 or more carbon atoms.

In the General Formula (3-1), R21 denotes a linear hydrocarbon group having 10 or more carbon atoms. Hereinafter, one exemplary synthetic method of the ionic liquid will be described. The ionic liquid is synthesized from the Bronsted acid and the Bronsted base. Specifically, the ionic liquid is obtained by mixing, for example, sulfonic acid with an equal amount of an organic base compound to neutralize them. Alternatively, the ionic liquid can be obtained by neutralizing an aliphatic amine with nitric acid to produce an ammonium nitrate salt, followed by anion exchange. For example, the ionic liquid can be obtained by anion exchange of ammonium nitrate salt with an equal amount of bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)amide lithium salt (Li[(CF3SO2)2N]), as represented by the following Reaction Scheme (2). The lubricating agent in the present embodiment may contain the aforementioned ionic liquid alone or in combination with conventionally known lubricating agents. For example, the ionic liquid may be combined with a long chain carboxylic acid, a long chain carboxylic acid ester, perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acid ester, carboxylic acid perfluoroalkyl ester, perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acid perfluoroalkyl ester, or a perfluoropolyether derivative. In order to keep a lubricating effect under a harsh condition, an extreme pressure agent may be used in combination in a compounding ratio of 30:70 to 70:30 by mass. When partial metal-to-metal contact occurs in a boundary-lubrication area, the extreme pressure agent reacts with a metal surface by the action of frictional heat generated accompanying the contact to thereby form a reaction product film. Thus, the extreme pressure agent exerts an abrasion and wear prevention effect. The extreme pressure agent may be any of, for example, a phosphorus-based extreme pressure agent, a sulfur-based extreme pressure agent, a halogen-based extreme pressure agent, an organic metal-based extreme pressure agent, and a complex type extreme pressure agent. An anti-rust agent may be used in combination, if necessary. The anti-rust agent may be those being commonly available as an anti-rust agent for this type of magnetic recording medium. Examples thereof include phenols, naphthols, quinones, a nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compound, an oxygen-containing heterocyclic compound, and a sulfur-containing heterocyclic compound. The anti-rust agent may be mixed with the lubricating agent. Alternatively, the anti-rust agent and the lubricating agent may be deposited separately in two or more layer by, for example, forming a magnetic layer on a non-magnetic support, applying an anti-rust agent layer thereon, followed by applying a lubricating agent layer thereon. A solvent for the lubricating agent may be alcohol-based solvents such as isopropyl alcohol (IPA) and ethanol, which may be used alone or in combination. For example, hydrocarbon-based solvents such as n-hexane or fluorosolvents may be used in combination therewith. <2. Magnetic recording medium> Next, a magnetic recording medium containing the aforementioned lubricating agent will now be described. A magnetic recording medium given as one embodiment of the present invention includes a non-magnetic support and a magnetic layer thereon, and the magnetic layer contains the aforementioned lubricating agent. The lubricating agent in the present embodiment can be applied to a magnetic recording medium formed by depositing the magnetic layer on a surface of the non-magnetic support by a technique such as vapor deposition and sputtering, which is the so-called metallic thin film type magnetic recording medium. Additionally, the lubricating agent can be applied to a magnetic recording medium having a configuration in which an under layer is interposed between the non-magnetic support and the magnetic layer. Examples of such magnetic recording medium include a magnetic disk and a magnetic tape. FIG. 1 is a cross-sectional view illustrating one exemplary hard disk. This hard disk has a configuration in which a substrate 11, an under layer 12, a magnetic layer 13, a carbon protecting layer 14, and a lubricating agent layer 15 are sequentially laminated. FIG. 2 is a cross-sectional view illustrating one exemplary magnetic tape. This magnetic tape has a configuration in which a back coat layer 25, a substrate 21, a magnetic layer 22, a carbon protecting layer 23, and a lubricating agent layer 24 are sequentially laminated. In the magnetic disk illustrated in FIG. 1, the non-magnetic support corresponds to the substrate 11 and the under layer 12. In the magnetic tape illustrated in FIG. 2, the non-magnetic support corresponds to the substrate 21. In the case where a rigid substrate such as an A1 alloy plate and a glass plate is used as the non-magnetic support, a surface of the substrate may be made hard by forming an oxide film (for example, through an alumite treatment) or a Ni-P film thereon. The magnetic layers 13 and 22 are formed as continuous films by a technique such as plating, sputtering, vacuum deposition, and plasma CVD. Examples of the magnetic layers 13 and 22 include an in-plane magnetization recording metallic magnetic film consisting of, for example, a metal (e.g., Fe, Co, or Ni), a Co-Ni based alloy, a Co-Pt based alloy, a Co-Ni-Pt based alloy, a Fe-Co based alloy, a Fe-Ni based alloy, a Fe-Co-Ni based alloy, a Fe-Ni-B based alloy, a Fe-Co-B based alloy, and a Fe-Co-Ni-B based alloy; and a perpendicular magnetization recording metallic magnetic film such as a Co-Cr based alloy film and a Co-O based film. In particular, in the case where the in-plane magnetization recording metallic magnetic film is formed, orientation may be eliminated, planar isotropy may be ensured, and coercive force may be improved as follows. A non-magnetic material (e.g., Bi, Sb, Pb, Sn, Ga, In, Ge, Si, and Tl) is formed as the under layer 12 on the non-magnetic support in advance, and a metallic magnetic material is vertically vapor-deposited or sputtered thereon to thereby disperse the non-magnetic material into the magnetic metallic thin film. Hard protecting layers 14 and 23 (e.g., a carbon film, a diamond-like carbon film, a chromium oxide film, or SiO2 film) may be formed on surfaces of the magnetic layers 13 and 22. Example of a method for allowing the aforementioned lubricating agent to be contained in such metallic thin film type magnetic recording medium includes a method in which the lubricating agent is applied, as a top coat, onto surfaces of the magnetic layers 13 and 22 or surfaces of the protecting layers 14 and 23, as illustrated in FIGs. 1 and 2. An amount of the lubricating agent to be applied is preferably 0.1 mg/m2~100 mg/m2, more preferably 0.5 mg/m2~30 mg/m2, particularly preferably 0.5 mg/m2~20 mg/m2. As illustrated in FIG. 2, the metallic thin film type magnetic tape may contain a back coat layer 25, if necessary, in addition to the magnetic layer 22 serving as the metallic magnetic thin film. The back coat layer 25 is formed by adding carbon-based powder for imparting electroconductivity and an inorganic pigment for controlling surface roughness to a resin binder, followed by applying. In the present embodiment, the aforementioned lubricating agent may be internally added or contained as the top coat in the back coat layer 25. Alternatively, the aforementioned lubricating agent may be internally added or contained as the top coat in the magnetic layer 22 and the back coat layer 25. In another embodiment, the lubricating agent can be applied to a magnetic recording medium in which magnetic paint is applied onto a surface of the non-magnetic support to thereby form a magnetic coating film serving as the magnetic layer, which is the so-called coating type magnetic recording medium. In the coating type magnetic recording medium, any conventionally known resin binder and magnetic powder constituting the non-magnetic support or the magnetic coating film can be used. Examples of the non-magnetic support include a polymeric support formed of, for example, a polymeric material such as polyesters, polyolefins, cellulose derivatives, vinyl-based resins, polyimides, polyamides, and polycarbonates; a metallic substrate formed of, for example, aluminium alloy or titanium alloy; a ceramic substrate formed of, for example, alumina glass; and a glass substrate. The shape thereof is not particularly limited, and may be any shape such as a tape-like shape, a sheet-like shape, or a drum-like shape. In addition, the non-magnetic support may be surface-treated to form fine unevenness in order to control its surface nature. Examples of the magnetic powder include ferromagnetic iron oxide-based particles (e.g., γ-Fe2O3 and cobalt-coated γ-Fe2O3), ferromagnetic chromium dioxide-based particles, ferromagnetic metal-based particles consisting of a metal (e.g., Fe, Co, and Ni) or alloy containing it, and hexagonal crystal-based ferrite particles having a hexagonal-plate-like shape. Examples of the resin binder include a polymer such as vinyl chloride, vinyl acetate, vinyl alcohol, vinylidene chloride, acrylic ester, methacrylic ester, styrene, butadiene, and acrylonitrile; a copolymer of any two or more of these polymers; a polyurethane resin, a polyester resin, and an epoxy resin. In order to improve dispersibility of the magnetic powder, a hydrophilic polar group such as a carboxylic acid group, a carboxyl group, or a phosphate group may be introduced into the binder. The magnetic coating film may contain an additive such as a dispersing agent, an abrasive agent, an antistatic agent, and an anti-rust agent, in addition to the magnetic powder and the resin binder. Examples of a method for allowing the aforementioned lubricating agent to be contained in such coating type magnetic recording medium includes a method in which the lubricating agent is internally added to the magnetic layer constituting the magnetic coating film formed on the non-magnetic support, a method in which the lubricating agent is deposited onto a surface of the magnetic layer as the top coat, and a combination thereof. In the case where the lubricating agent is internally added to the magnetic coating film, the lubricating agent is added in the amount of 0.2 parts by mass to 20 parts by mass relative to 100 parts by mass of the resin binder. In the case where the lubricating agent is deposited onto a surface of the magnetic layer as the top coat, the lubricating agent is preferably applied in the amount of 0.1 mg/m2 to 100 mg/m2, more preferably 0.5 mg/m2 to 20 mg/m2. Note that, a method for depositing the lubricating agent as the top coat may be a method in which the ionic liquid is dissolved in a solvent, and then the resultant solution is applied or sprayed, or a magnetic recording medium is immersed into the solution. In the present embodiment, a lubricating agent containing an ionic liquid which is formed from a Bronsted acid and a Bronsted base containing a linear hydrocarbon group preferably having 10 or more carbon atoms and which has a difference of pKa values thereof (ΔpKa) in water is 12 or more can exert a good lubricating effect to thereby reduce a coefficient of friction and achieve thermally high stability. The lubricating effect is not impaired even under a harsh condition such as high temperature, low temperature, high humidity, or low humidity. In the present embodiment, a lubricating agent containing an ionic liquid which is formed from a Bronsted acid and a Bronsted base containing a linear hydrocarbon group preferably having 10 or more carbon atoms and which has a difference of pKa values thereof (ΔpKa) in acetonitrile is 6 or more can exert a good lubricating effect to thereby reduce a coefficient of friction and achieve thermally high stability. The lubricating effect is not impaired even under a harsh condition such as high temperature, low temperature, high humidity, or low humidity. Thus, the magnetic recording medium to which the lubricating agent in the present embodiment is applied can exert excellent runnability, wear resistance, and durability and can improve thermal stability due to its lubricating effect. Examples <3. Example> Hereinafter, specific examples of the present invention will now be described. In Examples, ionic liquids were synthesized, and lubrication agents containing the ionic liquids were produced. Then, magnetic disks and magnetic tapes were produced using the lubrication agents, each of which was evaluated for disk durability and tape durability. Production of the magnetic disks, a disk durability test, production of the magnetic tapes, and a tape durability test were performed as follows. Note that, the present invention is not limited to Examples. <Production of magnetic disk> A magnetic disk illustrated in FIG. 1 was produced by forming a magnetic thin film on a glass substrate according to, for example, International Publication No. WO2005/068589. Specifically, a chemically strengthened glass disk consisting of aluminosilicate glass (external diameter: 65 mm, internal diameter: 20 mm, disk thickness: 0.635 mm) was prepared. A surface of the disk was polished so as to have Rmax of 4.8 nm and Ra of 0.43 nm. The glass substrate was subjected to ultrasonic cleaning in pure water and isopropyl alcohol (IPA) (purity: 99.9% or higher) for 5 min each, and then left to stand in IPA saturated vapor for 1.5 min, followed by drying, which was determined as a substrate 11. On this substrate 11, 30 nm of a NiAl alloy (Ni: 50 mol%, Al: 50 mol%) thin film serving as a seed layer, 8 nm of a CrMo alloy (Cr: 80 mol%, Mo: 20 mol%) thin film serving as a under layer 12, and 15 nm of a CoCrPtB alloy (Co: 62 mol%, Cr: 20 mol%, Pt: 12 mol%, and B: 6 mol%) serving as a magnetic layer 13 were sequentially formed by a DC magnetron sputtering method. Next, a 5 nm of carbon protecting layer 14 consisting of amorphous diamond-like carbon was formed by a plasma CVD method. The thus formed disk sample was subjected to ultrasonic cleaning in isopropyl alcohol (IPA) (purity: 99.9% or higher) contained in a cleaning vessel for 10 min to thereby remove contaminants on a surface of the disk, followed by drying. Then, a solution of an ionic liquid in IPA was applied onto the surface of the disk by a dip coating method under an environment of 25°C and 50% relative humidity (RH) to thereby form an about 1 nm of a lubricating agent layer 15. <Disk durability test> A CSS durability test was performed using a commercially available strain gauge type disk friction and wear tester as follows. A hard disk was mounted on a rotary spindle with tightening torque of 14.7 Ncm, and then, a head slider was mounted on the hard disk so that the center of an air bearing surface of the head slider in an inner peripheral side was 17.5 mm apart from the center of the hard disk. The head used in this measurement was IBM 3370 type in-line head, the slider was made of Al2O3-TiC, and a head load was 63.7 mN. In this test, the maximum value of friction force was monitored every CSS (Contact, Start, Stop) under an environment of 25°C, 60%RH, and cleanliness of 100. The number of times in which a coefficient of friction exceeds 1.0 was determined as a result of the CSS durability test. In the result of the CSS durability test, when the number of times was greater than 50,000, the result was displayed as ">50,000." To examine thermal resistance, the CSS durability test was performed again in the same manner after a heating test at a temperature of 300°C for 3 min. <Production of magnetic tape> A magnetic tape having a cross-sectional configuration as shown in FIG. 2 was produced. Firstly, Co was deposited onto a substrate 21 consisting of a MICTRON (aromatic polyamide) film having a thickness of 5 µm (manufactured by Toray Industries, Inc.) by an oblique deposition method to thereby form a magnetic layer 22 consisting of a 100 nm thick ferromagnetic metal thin film. Next, a 10 nm of carbon protecting layer 23 consisting of carbon-like carbon was formed on a surface of the ferromagnetic metal thin film by the plasma CVD method, followed by cutting to 6 mm width. The ionic liquid dissolved in IPA was applied onto the magnetic layer 22 so as to have a film thickness of about 1 nm to thereby form a lubricating agent layer 24. Thus, a sample tape was produced. <Tape durability test> For each sample tape, still durability under an environment of a temperature of -5°C and an environment of a temperature of 40°C and 30%RH, and a coefficient of friction and shuttle durability under an environment of a temperature of -5°C and an environment of a temperature of 40°C and 90%RH were measured. The still durability was evaluated as attenuation time for which the output in the pause state was decreased by -3 dB. The shuttle durability was evaluated as the number of shuttle runs before the output was decreased by 3 dB when the sample tape was subjected to repeated shuttle running operations for 2 min per run. Additionally, in order to examine thermal resistance, the durability test was performed again in the same manner after a heating test at a temperature of 100°C for 10 min. <3.1 Effect of difference between pKa value of Bronsted acid and pKa value of Bronsted base (ΔpKa)> Ionic liquids were synthesized having different differences between pKa values of Bronsted acids and pKa values of Bronsted bases (ΔpKa). Lubricating agents containing the ionic liquids were used in magnetic recording media to examine an effect of the difference between a pKa value of a Bronsted acid and a pKa value of a Bronsted base (ΔpKa). Note that, pKa values in Examples 1 to 35 and Comparative Examples 1 to 26 refer to pKa values in water, and pKa values in Examples 36 to 56 and Comparative Examples 27 to 32 refer to pKa values in acetonitrile.

Ionic liquid 1 was synthesized by neutralizing octadecylamine with nitric acid to produce an ammonium nitrate salt, followed by anion exchange of the ammonium nitrate salt with an equal amount of bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide lithium salt (Li[(CF3SO2)2N]). Note that, Ionic liquid 1 was the same compound as Ionic liquid 12 described below, and the detailed synthetic method thereof was as described in the synthetic method of Ionic liquid 12. (Example 2) [Ionic liquid 2] As described in Table 2, trifluoromethane sulfonic acid (CF3SO3H, pKa = -7) was used as the Bronsted acid, and octadecylamine containing a linear hydrocarbon group having 18 carbon atoms (pKa = 10.7) was used as the Bronsted base.

Ionic liquid 3 was synthesized by mixing octadecylamine with an equal amount of sulfuric acid to thereby neutralize it. (Example 4) [Ionic liquid 4] As described in Table 2, methane sulfonic acid (CH3SO3H, pKa = -2) was used as the Bronsted acid, and octadecylamine containing a linear hydrocarbon group having 18 carbon atoms (pKa = 10.7) was used as the Bronsted base. The difference between a pKa value of a Bronsted acid and a pKa value of a Bronsted base (ΔpKa) was 12.7. Ionic liquid 4 was synthesized by mixing octadecylamine with an equal amount of trifluoromethane sulfonic acid to thereby neutralize it. (Comparative Example 1) [Comparative ionic liquid 1] As described in Table 2, trifluoroacetic acid (CF3COOH, pKa = 0.5) was used as the Bronsted acid, and octadecylamine containing a linear hydrocarbon group having 18 carbon atoms (pKa = 10.7) was used as the Bronsted base. The difference between a pKa value of a Bronsted acid and a pKa value of a Bronsted base (ΔpKa) was 10.2. Comparative ionic liquid 1 was synthesized by mixing octadecylamine with an equal amount of trifluoroacetic acid to thereby neutralize it. (Comparative Example 2) [Comparative ionic liquid 2] As described in Table 2, perfluorooctanoic acid (C7F15COOH, pKa = 2.5) was used as the Bronsted acid, and octadecylamine containing a linear hydrocarbon group having 18 carbon atoms (pKa = 10.7) was used as the Bronsted base. The difference between a pKa value of a Bronsted acid and a pKa value of a Bronsted base (ΔpKa) was 8.2. Comparative ionic liquid 2 was synthesized by mixing octadecylamine with an equal amount of perfluorooctanoic acid to thereby neutralize it. (Comparative Example 3) [Comparative ionic liquid 3] As described in Table 2, stearic acid (C17F35COOH, pKa = 5.0) was used as the Bronsted acid, and octadecylamine containing a linear hydrocarbon group having 18 carbon atoms (pKa = 10.7) was used as the Bronsted base. The difference between a pKa value of a Bronsted acid and a pKa value of a Bronsted base (ΔpKa) was 5.7. Comparative ionic liquid 3 was synthesized by mixing octadecylamine with an equal amount of stearic acid to thereby neutralize it.

As described in Table 3, the CSS measurement result of the magnetic disk was greater than 50,000, the CSS measurement result after the heating test was also greater than 50,000, indicating excellent durability. (Example 6) A magnetic disk was produced as described above using a lubricating agent containing Ionic liquid 2. As described in Table 3, the CSS measurement result of the magnetic disk was greater than 50,000, the CSS measurement result after the heating test was also greater than 50,000, indicating excellent durability. (Example 7) A magnetic disk was produced as described above using a lubricating agent containing Ionic liquid 3. As described in Table 3, the CSS measurement result of the magnetic disk was greater than 50,000, the CSS measurement result after the heating test was also greater than 50,000, indicating excellent durability. (Example 8) A magnetic disk was produced as described above using a lubricating agent containing Ionic liquid 4. As described in Table 3, the CSS measurement result of the magnetic disk was greater than 50,000, the CSS measurement result after the heating test was also greater than 50,000, indicating excellent durability. (Comparative Example 4) A magnetic disk was produced as described above using a lubricating agent containing Comparative ionic liquid 1. As described in Table 3, the CSS measurement result of the magnetic disk was greater than 50,000, but the CSS measurement result after the heating test was 1,230, indicating that the heating test deteriorated durability. It is believed that this is because high temperature allowed ionic dissociation to proceed to thereby deteriorate thermal stability. (Comparative Example 5) A magnetic disk was produced as described above using a lubricating agent containing Comparative ionic liquid 2. As described in Table 3, the CSS measurement result of the magnetic disk was greater than 50,000, but the CSS measurement result after the heating test was 891, indicating that the heating test deteriorated durability.

Matsumura, H. Nishiguchi, M. Okada, and S. Yoneda, J. Heterocyclic Chem. pp. 885-887, Vol/23. Issue 3 (1986)). <Synthesis of Ionic liquid 11> The compound represented by the Structural Formula (1) which had been obtained using the above method was dissolved in a mixed solvent of 85% by mass of n-hexane and 15% by mass of ethanol. Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid dissolved in ethanol was added thereto [95 mol% relative to the compound represented by the Structural Formula (1)]. After removing the solvent, the resultant was washed with n-hexane to remove an excess of compounds represented by the Structural Formula (1) to thereby obtain Ionic liquid 11. (Comparative Example 16) <Synthesis of C7F15COO-H3N+C18H37 (Comparative ionic liquid 6)> It was synthesized according to Tribology Trans, Vol. 37, No. 1 (Jan. 1994), pp. 99-105. (Comparative Example 17) < Synthesis of C7F15CH2O-H3N+C18H37 (Comparative ionic liquid 7)> Stearylamine and an equimolar amount of pentadecafluorooctanol were dissolved in a mixed solvent n-hexane and a small amount of ethanol, followed by heating at 60°C for 30 min. The resultant was filtered to remove contaminants, followed by recrystallization to thereby obtain colorless crystals.

(Examples 30 and 31, and Comparative Examples 18 and 19). Z-DOL was also subjected to the TG measurement (Comparative Example 20). Weight loss was measured while purging air in a temperature range of 30°C to 600°C at a heating rate of 10°C/min. Results are shown in FIG. 4. Also, 10% weight loss temperatures are summarized in Table 9. Note that, exothermic peak temperatures in a differential thermal analysis (DTA) measurement of Ionic liquid 2 were 374°C and 380°C, and exothermic peak temperatures in the differential thermal analysis (DTA) measurement of Ionic liquid 10 were 383°C and 402°C.

In particular, the latter has been found to have the 10% weight loss temperature 200°C or more higher than that of Z-DOL. In Ionic liquid 11, a DBU derivative having high basic strength was used as the Bronsted base instead of stearylamine, so that the ΔpKa was increased and the 10% weight loss temperature was increased by 45°C. In contrast, Comparative ionic liquid 6 having the ΔpKa of 6.9 had the 10% weight loss temperature of 205°C, and Comparative ionic liquid 7 having the ΔpKa of 4 or less had the 10% weight loss temperature of 62°C, indicating poor thermal resistance. (Examples 32 and 33, and Comparative Examples 21 to 23) Next, Examples applied to metallic thin film type magnetic recording media (magnetic disks) will now be described. Magnetic disks were produced as described above using lubricating agents containing ionic liquids described in Table 10. The thus produced magnetic disks were subjected to the CSS durability test and the CSS durability test after the heating. Results are shown in Table 10.

When the ΔpKa is less than 10, the durability after the heating is deteriorated. It is believed that this is because ionic dissociation and decomposition proceed at the high temperature to thereby deteriorate thermal stability. (Examples 34 and 35, Comparative Examples 24 to 26) Next, Examples applied to magnetic tapes will now be described. Magnetic tapes were produced as described above using the lubricating agents containing ionic liquids described in Table 11. The thus produced magnetic tapes were examined for the coefficient of friction after 100 times of shuttle runs, the still durability, the shuttle durability, the still durability after the heating, and the shuttle durability after the heating.

However, those having the ΔpKa of 7 or less, which were presented as Comparative Examples, were greatly deteriorated in durability as with the aforementioned disks. (Example 36) [Ionic liquid 12] <Synthesis of n-octadecylamine-bistrifluoromethane sulfonylimide salt> The synthetic scheme is shown below.

When reaching the point of neutralization, the addition was terminated. After cooling, precipitated crystals were filtered, followed by drying to thereby obtain n-octadecylamine nitrate. Next, 6.80 g of n-octadecylamine nitrate was dissolved in ethanol, and 5.91 g of bistrifluoromethane sulfoimide lithium salt dissolved in ethanol was added dropwise thereto. After the completion of titration, the resultant was stirred for 1 hour and heated under reflux for 1 hour. The resultant was cooled, followed by removing the solvent therefrom, adding water and diethyl ether thereto, separating an organic layer, and washing the organic layer with water. The organic layer was dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, followed by removing the solvent therefrom, and recrystallizing from n-hexane to thereby obtain n-octadecylamine-bistrifluoromethanesulfonylimide salt (colorless crystals, melting point: 67°C).

As a gas chromatography mass spectrometer, 6890/5975 MSD (manufactured by Agilent Technologies, Inc.) was used.
