A storage box transformable into a frame Field of the invention The invention relates to a storage box transformable into a frame consisting of four elongated corner profiles having an L-form whose free ends adapted for connection to form a closed right-angled quadrangle, one side of the corner profiles constituting longitudinal supporting surfaces, the frame further consisting of a base board mounted inside the frame and connected to the frame. State of the art There are many different varieties of right-angled peripheral frames with a baseboard, which consist of more parts and can be folded to form a storage box. With regard to game plans for the Puzzle, document DE20303236 describes an folding frame with a base board for assembling the Puzzle pieces. The base board which may consist of two or more parts is provided with elongated recesses produced by pressing, milling or casting. Parts of the base board can be assembled and connected together by means of U-shaped clamps, whose free ends have a length that extends to roughly one half of a piece of the Puzzle. The peripheral frame can be hung on a wall. From another document EP2545968 a box for an folding board game puzzle is known, comprising a box with a flat bottom whose peripheral edges, when it is disassembled, change into lateral flat right-angled segments, which constitute the walls of the box after assembly. On lateral edges the right-angled segments are provided with square recesses and projections and in parallel with peripheral edges, bend lines are created in lateral segments. From another document US4890839 an adjustable right-angled peripheral frame for a folding board Puzzle game is known, whose each side is made up of two or more longitudinal members connected to each other by clamps that allow mutual linear sliding of the members of each one side so as to allow to adjust the total length and width of the frame as required. A bottom is attached to lower sides of the longitudinal members, the bottom creating a surface for placing the Puzzle pieces. Not all parts of the storage box are utilized in the assembled frame. Known folding and adjustable frames and disassemblable boxes do not allow therefore to fold the frame together with the bottom into one closed box which consists of assembled parts only, without any remaining parts. The aim of the invention is to remedy the shortcomings of the known folding frames and storage boxes. Another aim of the invention is to provide a storage box which can be unfolded into a frame with a base board for assembly of all pieces of the board game puzzle kept in the storage box. Another aim of the invention is to provide a storage box for the stated purpose which allows seeing through the top of the box a part of the scene of the board game Puzzle Another aim of the invention is to provide a storage box for the stated purpose which will be simple, sturdy and light. Summary of the invention Disadvantages of the folding frames and storage boxes known from the state of art are overcome and the aim of the invention is accomplished by a storage box transformable into a frame consisting of four elongated corner profiles having an L-form whose free ends adapted for connection to form a closed right-angled quadrangle, one side of the corner profiles constituting longitudinal supporting surfaces, the frame further consisting of a base board mounted inside the frame and connected to the frame according to the invention consisting in that the base board is bent along weakened bend lines into a closed right-angled shape of a casing of the storage box, the bend lines arranged in parallel with opposite edges of the base board and dividing the base board into alternating first bands forming a bottom and a top and second bands forming two opposite side walls of the casing, one edge of the base board is provided with connecting means arranged along the edge for a right-angled disconnectable joint of the edge with the opposite edge of the base board, the adjacent corner profiles are put together by longitudinal supporting surfaces into pairs and the pairs of the profiles are inserted in inner space of the casing whereas the height of the pairs of the corner profiles in the direction perpendicular to the bottom of the casing is equal or lower than the inner distance between the bottom and the top of the casing of the storage box. With advantage the connecting means consist of a supporting band projection arranged in parallel with the edge and perpendicularly to the base board at a distance from the edge, which corresponds to the thickness of the base board along the opposite edge, whereas the opposite edge is provided with pin projections for penetration into openings arranged between the supporting band projection and the edge of the base board. With advantage the base board consists of two parts comprising always one first, wider band forming bottom or top connected by bend line with one second, narrower band forming one of opposite side walls of the casing, whereas the first bands forming bottom or top are substantially thicker than the second bands forming lateral walls. With advantage each of the corner profiles is provided on its free end with a weakened projection and on its second free end with an opening for interconnection with the adjacent corner profiles. With advantage the corner profiles are provided on inner side of the frame with a longitudinal recess for insertion of the edge of the base board or with a longitudinal surface with needle pins extending with overlap to the openings created along the circumference of the base board. With advantage the top and/or the bottom are perforated at least in part or made from transparent plastic material. The main advantage of the storage box according to the invention is the possibility of dismantling the storage box into a frame to be hanged on the wall or used on the table as a desk game for a puzzle. The advantage of the storage box according to the invention consists further in that all parts of the storage box are used to assemble and create the frame and the base board and vice versa. Another advantage of the storage box according to the invention is its sturdy construction usable without wrappers for transport and sale, allowing presentation of its content, in particular presentation of part of the motif of the pieces of the board game puzzle. Finally the advantage of the storage box according to the invention is the possibility for the shopper to see the content of the storage box without opening the casing. Brief description of the drawings The storage box according to the invention is shown in drawings depicting: Fig. 1 assembly of a frame with base board, disassembled Fig. 2 corner profiles, assembled Fig. 3 base board bent into shape of box casing, disassembled Fig. 4 storage box before final assembly Fig. 5 detail of free ends of corner profiles Fig. 6 connection of base board to corner profile Fig. 7 another connection of base board to corner profile Example of execution according to the invention Upper part of Fig. 1 shows a frame 1, which consists of four elongated corner profiles 2, 3, 4, 5 in an L-form. The corner profiles 2, 3, 4, 5 are hollow and so shaped that they show rear or bottom elongated supporting surface 8, with which the frame 1 rests against a wall, when assembled, or lies on a table. Upper or frontal side of the corner profiles 2, 3, 4, 5 is visible and therefore shaped to good advantage. Bottom or rear side of the corner profiles 2, 3, 4, 5 is flat, at least in part, to good advantage. The corner profiles 2, 3, 4, 5 have on each end a projection 6, which can be inserted into opening 7 of adjacent corner profile 2, 3, 4, 5. By insertion of the projections 6 into the openings 7 of all hollow comer profiles 2, 3, 4, 5 the frame 1 is assembled. Adjacent corner profiles 2, 5 and 3, 4 can be mated on elongated supporting surface 8, so that they make up two pairs of mated corner profiles 2, 5 and 3, 4. Lower part of Fig. 1 shows a base board 11, which is placed after assembly inside the frame 1 and connected to the frame 1 by disconnectable joints. The shown base board 1 1 comprises two first bands for the bottom (not shown) storage box and two second bands for the lateral side wall (not shown) of the storage box, which are regularly alternated and constitute one piece. With advantage the first bands can be wider than the second bands. The first bands of base board 11 may be much thicker, to good advantage, than the second bands. Bend lines 15 are between the first bands and second bands of the base board 11 and the second bands can be adjusted by 90Â° to a position perpendicular to the first bands of the base board 1 1. The bend lines 15 are arranged in parallel with the uttermost opposite edges 12, 14 of the right-angled base board 11. The bend lines 15 can be formed to good advantage as linear weakening of base board 1 1 having the constant thickness or as transitions between two parts of the base board 11 having different thickness . Along one edge 12 of base board 11 are arranged connecting means 16 for right-angled disassemblable connection with the opposite second edge 14 of the base board 1 1. Connecting means 16 comprises a support band opening perpendicular to the surface of the second band of the base board 11 and parallel with edge 12 at distance (a) from edge 12, which equals the thickness of the base board 11 along the opposite edge 14. Along the edge 12 are openings 19 in the narrower band in the middle of the border (a) in width. From opposite edge 14 pin projections 18 jut out protrude from the wider band of base board 11 in direction parallel with surface of base board 11. After assembly of base board 11 do right-angled shape of the casing (not shown) of the storage box pin projections 18 fit in openings 19. In Fig. 2, each of the corner profiles 2, 3, 4, 5 has on its one free end weakened projection 6 and on its second free end opening 7 for mutual connection with adjacent corner profiles. Adjacent corner profiles 2, 5 and 3, 4 are put together by elongated supporting surfaces 8 and form two pairs arranged for placement in the right-angled casing of the (not shown) storage box. On the free ends the pairs have corner profiles 2, 5 and 3, 4, always alternating one weakened projection 6 and one opening 7, so it is possible to attach the free ends of two adjacent pairs together with overlapping weakened projections 6. The pairs of corner profiles 2, 5 and 3, 4 will thus form a closed right-angled quadrangle inside the casing 21 as depicted in the Fig. 4. Upper part of Fig. 3 shows disassembled base board 1 1 before it is placed in the (not shown) frame. Base board 1 1 consists of two identical parts, each of which comprises one wider band for forming bottom 23 or top 24 and one narrower band for forming one of the opposite lateral walls 25, 26 of the storage box, which are separated by bend line 15 for turning and fixing the narrower band by 90Â° as against the wider band. The wider bands for forming bottom 23 or top 24 are much thicker than the narrower band for forming lateral walls 25, 26. Both parts of base board 1 1 are oriented by connecting means 16 in the same direction and attached to each other by the wider bands to mirror each other. Shifting the first, wider bands to each other and inserting pin projections 18 to openings 17 forms a solid base board 1 1 in a size for mounting in the (not shown) frame. Each part of base board 1 1 has one edge 12 of the narrower band and opposite edge 14 of the first, wider band. On edges 14 of both parts of the base board 1 1 are alternating pin projections 18 and openings 17 for insertion of pin projections 18. Both parts of the base board 1 1 are turned to each other by edges 14 for interconnection using pin projections 18 and openings 17. Alongside edges 12 of the second, narrower bands of base board 11 are connecting means 16 consisting of band projections arranged in parallel with edges 12 at a distance 'a' from edges 12, which corresponds to the thickness of base board 1 1 alongside opposite edge 14. To good advantage, on the axis of the border in width formed between edge 12 and the band projection there are openings for insertion of pin projections 18 formed on opposite edge 14 of the wider band of the second part of base board 1 1. Lower part of Fig. 3 depicts both parts of base board 1 1 before assembly in the casing of storage box 21, after turning the narrower bands of base board 1 1 by 90Â° to a position perpendicular to the wider bands of base board 1 1. The narrower bands of base board 1 1 form sides 25, 26 and the wider bands of base board 1 1 form bottom 23 and top 24 of storage box 21. To assemble the casing 2 lof the storage box one of the parts of the base board shown in upper part of Fig. 3 is turned over to a position in which connecting means 16 are oriented in the opposite direction. Both parts of the base board 1 1 are ready for attachment of edges 14 to edges 12 and for insertion of pin projections 18 of the wider bands into openings 19 of the narrower bands of base board 1 1. In the final position, when the casing 21 is assembled, the distance between the bottom 23 and the top 24 is marked as "K". Parts of base board 1 1 may have a shape different from that shown in Fig. 3 or parts of base board 1 1 may be formed by each of the wider bands, which is connected in one piece by a weakened bend line with two narrower bands, which after tilting by 90Â° form with the wider band the U-shaped part of the casing. Both U-shaped parts are then connected by pin projections 18 and openings 19 formed in the opposite edges of both parts of base board 1 1. In Fig. 4 the storage box is presented before final assembly. Both parts of the base board 11 as shown in lower part of Fig. 3 will be connected together in order to create the closed right-angled shape of the casing 21. One part of the base board 1 1 consists of bottom 23 and side wall 25 and the other part of the base board consists of top 24 and side wall 26. Side walls 25, 26 are provided with openings 19 situated alongside the edges 12. The pin projections 18 arranged on the edges 14 of the bottom 23 and top 24 shall be inserted into the. openings 19. Both pairs of corner profiles 2, 5 and 3, 4 as shown in Fig. 2 are put on the bottom 23 of the casing 21. Height V of each pair of corner profiles 2, 5 and 3, 4 in direction perpendicular to the bottom 23 of the casing 21 i.e. across the longitudinal support surfaces of the corner profiles 2, 5 and 3, 4 is equal or lower than the inner distance 'K' between the top 24 and the bottom 23 of the casing 21 of the storage box as per the Fig. 3. If height V is equal to distance 'K', the pairs of corner profiles 2, 5 and 3, 4 fit together with the top 24 and the bottom 23. The adjacent corner profiles 2, 5 and 3, 4 are put together by longitudinal supporting surfaces 8 into pairs and the pairs of the profiles 2, 5 and 3, 4 are inserted in inner space of the casing 21. The space between the top 24 and the bottom 23 may be lowered by the connecting means 16 when consisting of a support band projection arranged in parallel with the edge 12 and perpendicularly to the side walls 25, 26. The space for placement of the pairs of corner profiles 2, 5 and 3, 4 is lowered to "Î'" along the edges 14. In such a case the pairs of the corner profiles 3, 4 and 2, 5, if they shall fit into the space between the top 24 or the bottom 23, the pairs of the corner profiles 3, 4 and 2, 5 shall be adequately pushed together in the inner space of the casing 21 , between the opposite support band projections. Or the support band projection can be embedded along the edge 14 into the material of the bottom 23 or top 24. Height V of two corner profiles 2, 5 and 3, 4 may be lower than the distance 'K'. In such a case the pairs of the corner profiles 2, 5 and 3, 4 are kept inside the casing 21 of the storage box freely without fitting to the bottom 23 and top 24, which is less advantageous, however. In part of the top 24 may be an opening 27 for viewing the internal space of storage box 21. Alternatively, the opening 27 may be covered or executed as a transparent part made from plastic material. In Fig. 5, detail A from Fig. 4 shows an exemplary shape of the weakened projection 6 of the corner profile 5, which during the assembly of the (not shown) frame is inserted into opening 7 of the adjacent corner profile 2. The weakened projection 6 must not fill up the whole extent but only a part of the cross section of the opening 7 and may be appropriately shaped for the purpose of mutual fitting with the opening 7 of the corner profile 5. In Fig. 6, of the exemplary execution the corner profile 5 is provided with longitudinal surface 10 with needle pins 20 extending with overlap to the openings 19 made along the circumference of the base board 1 1. To good advantage, the base board 11 may be oriented by connecting means 16 downwards or towards a wall on which the frame with corner profile 5 is hung. In Fig. 7, corner profiles 2, 3, 4, 5 in the exemplary execution are provided on the inner side of the frame with longitudinal recess 9 for insertion of the edge of the base board 11. Connecting means 16 fits with the walls of the longitudinal recess 9 of corner profile 5. 1.
