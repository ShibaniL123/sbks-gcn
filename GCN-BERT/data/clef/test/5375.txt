High Avidity Antigen Recognizing Constructs FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention pertains to novel high avidity antigen recognizing constructs, such as antibodies or Τ cell receptors, which specifically bind to the melanoma associated antigen (MAGE) Al. The constructs of the invention are particularly useful for the diagnosis, prevention or therapy of tumorous diseases which are characterized by the specific expression of the MAGE-A1 antigen. Furthermore provided are nucleic acids, vectors and host cells - such as CD4 or CD8 positive Τ cells - which encode, comprise or present the antigen recognizing constructs of the invention. The invention thus provides new means for immune therapy, specifically adoptive Τ cell therapy, for treating cancer. DESCRIPTION Despite remarkable technological advancements in the diagnosis and treatment options available to patients diagnosed with cancer, the prognosis still often remains poor and many patients cannot be cured. Immunotherapy holds the promise of offering a potent, yet targeted, treatment to patients diagnosed with various tumors, with the potential to eradicate the malignant tumor cells without damaging normal tissues. In theory the Τ cells of the immune system are capable of recognizing protein patterns specific for tumor cells and to mediate their destruction through a variety of effector mechanisms. Adoptive T-cell therapy is an attempt to harness and amplify the tumor-eradicating capacity of a patient's own Τ cells and then return these effectors to the patient in such a state that they effectively eliminate residual tumor, however without damaging healthy tissue. Although this approach is not new to the field of tumor immunology, still many drawbacks in the clinical use of adoptive Τ cell therapy impair the full use of this approach in cancer treatments. A TCR is a heterodimeric cell surface protein of the immunoglobulin super-family which is associated with invariant proteins of the CD3 complex involved in mediating signal transduction. TCRs exist in αβ and γδ forms, which are structurally similar but have quite distinct anatomical locations and probably functions. The extracellular portion of native heterodimeric a.pTCR consists of two polypeptides, each of which has a membrane-proximal constant domain, and a membrane-distal variable domain. Each of the constant and variable domains includes an intra-chain disulfide bond. The variable domains contain the highly polymorphic loops analogous to the complementarity determining regions (CDRs) of antibodies. The use of TCR gene therapy overcomes a number of current hurdles. It allows equipping patients’ own Τ cells with desired specificities and generation of sufficient numbers of Τ cells in a short period of time, avoiding their exhaustion. The TCR will be transduced into central memory Τ cells or Τ cells with stem cell characteristics, which may ensure better persistence and function upon transfer. TCR-engineered Τ cells will be infused into cancer patients rendered lymphopenic by chemotherapy or irradiation, allowing efficient engraftment but inhibiting immune suppression. Transgenic mice expressing human MHC molecules and a diverse human TCR repertoire serve as a tool to rapidly analyze whether peptide antigens are immunogenic, i.e. are they efficiently processed and presented by MHC molecules, do they efficiently induce Τ cell responses following immunization (Li et al. 2010 Nat Med). The concept of adoptive Τ cell therapy using the ABabDII mouse published by Li et al is shown in Ligure 1. In brief, CD8+ Τ cells in ABabDII mice harbor human Τ cell receptors (TCRs) which recognize antigens presented by human MHC class I molecules. As opposed to humans, ABabDII mice are not tolerant to human tumor associated antigens (TAAs). Therefore, when vaccinated with a human ΤΑΑ, ABabDII mice generate an efficient adaptive immune response against those foreign antigens including the expansion of high avidity antigen specific Τ cells (Ligure 1, right side). After immunization with a suitable human ΤΑΑ the genetic information coding for the high avidity TCRs of the ABabDII mice can be extracted (Ligure 1, center). These TCRs can subsequently be re-expressed in Τ cells from tumor patients through retroviral transduction. Those re-targeted Τ cells can be transferred back into the patient fighting the tumor (Ligure 1, left side). Using the human TCR transgenic mouse, any human peptide sequence not encoded by the mouse genome is thus suitable for immunization and will yield TCRs with optimal affinity. Optimal affinity means that the Τ cells are restricted to human self-MHC molecules and recognize the peptide antigen as foreign, e.g. represent the non-tolerant repertoire. By using ρ℮ρtide/MHC multimers, specific Τ cells of the transgenic mice can be sorted, human TCRs isolated, e.g. by single cell PCR, the TCRs optimized for efficient expression while avoiding mispairing with endogenous TCR and used for transduction of patients’ Τ cells with viral vectors (Uckert et al. 2008 Cancer Immunol Immunother; Kammertoens Τ et al. 2009 Eur J Immunol). The melanoma antigen genes (MAGE-A) were found to be expressed in a variety of tumors of different histological origin. Proteins encoded by the MAGE genes are tumor rejection antigens, which can induce specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTL) having the ability to recognize and kill cancerous cells. MAGE genes and proteins are thus a preferential target for the development of novel drugs to fight cancer by immunotherapy. MAGE-A proteins constitute a sub-family of Cancer-Testis Antigens which are expressed mainly, but not exclusively, in the germ line. They are however also expressed in various human cancers where they are associated with, and may drive, malignancy. This specific expression of MAGE antigens in tumors and not the normal surrounding healthy tissue makes this family of antigens very interesting for targeted adoptive Τ cell transfer. However, to date no satisfactory immune therapy is known due to the lack of specific and highly avid antibodies or Τ cell receptors targeting the MAGE antigen. In view of the above described major drawbacks in the background art, it is the objective of the present invention to provide new antigen recognizing constructs with high avidity and specificity against the MAGE-A antigen. Furthermore, the present invention intends to provide novel methods that allow for the production of such constructs. In more general terms the invention seeks to provide novel means for immuno cancer therapy. The above problem is solved in a first aspect by an antigen recognizing construct comprising an amino acid sequence having at least 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 98%, 99% or 100% sequence identity to an amino acid sequence selected from SEQ ID Nos. 1 to 6. SEQ ID No 1 to 6 corresponds to CDR3 regions shown in figure 4 of this application. It was surprisingly discovered that the TCRs provided in the examples of the present invention are highly avid compared to state of the art TCRs directed at MAGE antigens. In one preferred embodiment of the present invention the antigen recognizing construct comprises a complementary determining region 3 (CDR3) having at least 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 98%, 99% or 100% sequence identity to an amino acid sequence selected from SEQ ID Nos. 1 to 6. Preferred in the context of the invention is also that the antigen recognizing construct further comprises a V element selected from TRAV5, TRAV13-1, TRAV12-3, TRBV28, TRBV29-1, TRBV13, TRBV20, TRBV12, and/or a J element selected from TRAJ41, TRAJ29, TRAJ31, TRAJ49, TRAJ34, TRBJ2-7, TRBJ2-2, TRBJ2-6, TRBJ7, TRBJ1-2; preferably in the combination as depicted in table 1. The antigen recognizing construct in accordance with the invention is specific for and/or binds specifically to an antigen of the melanoma associated antigen MAGE family. Various proteins are known to be part of the MAGE family which includes also some pseudo genes. One region of homology shared by all of the members of the MAGE family is a stretch of about 200 amino acids which has been named the MAGE conserved domain. The MAGE conserved domain is usually located close to the C-terminal, although it can also be found in a more central position in some proteins. The MAGE conserved domain is generally present as a single copy but it is duplicated in some proteins. MAGE genes which are detectable by the antigen recognizing constructs of the invention are selected from MAGE-B1, MAGE-A1, MAGE-A10, MAGE-A11, MAGE-A12, MAGE-A2B, MAGE-A3, MAGE-A4, MAGE-A6, MAGE-A8, MAGE-A9, MAGE-B1, MAGE-BIO, MAGE-B16, MAGE-B18, MAGE-B2, MAGE-B3, MAGE-B4, MAGE-B5, MAGE-B6, MAGE-B6B, MAGE-C1, MAGE-C2, MAGE-C3, MAGE-D1, MAGE-D2, MAGE-D4, MAGE-E1, MAGE-E2, MAGE-F1, MAGE-H1, MAGE-L2, NDN, NDNL2. Preferred in the context of the present invention are the 12 homologous MAGE proteins selected from MAGE-A1, MAGE-A2, MAGE-A3, MAGE-A4, MAGE-A5, MAGE-A6, MAGE-A7, MAGE-A8, MAGE-A9, MAGE-A10, MAGE-A11, or MAGE-A12. Most preferred is an antigen recognizing construct having specificity for MAGE-A1. The term “specificity” or “antigen specificity” or “specific for” a given antigen, as used herein means that the antigen recognizing construct can specifically bind to and immunologically recognize said antigen, preferably MAGE-A1, more preferably with high avidity. For example, a TCR may be considered to have “antigenic specificity” for MAGE-A1 if Τ cells expressing the TCR secrete at least about 200 pg/ml or more (e.g., 250 pg/ml or more, 300 pg/ml or more, 400 pg/ml or more, 500 pg/ml or more, 600 pg/ml or more, 700 pg/ml or more, 1000 pg ml or more, 2,000 pg/ml or more, 2,500 pg/ml or more, 5,000 pg/ml or more) of interferon γ (IFN-y) upon co-culture with target cells pulsed with a low concentration of a MAGE peptide, such as the MAGE-A1 HLA-A02 restricted MAGE-Α1278-286 peptide (e.g., about 10"11 mol/1, 10"10 mol/1, 10"9 mol/1, 10"8 mol/1, 10"7 mol/1, 10"6 mol/1, 10"5 mol/1). Alternatively or additionally, a TCR may be considered to have “antigenic specificity” for MAGE-Α1 if Τ cells expressing the TCR secrete at least twice as much IFN-y as the untransduced background level of 1ΕΝ-γ upon co-culture with target cells pulsed with a low concentration of HLA-A02 restricted MAGE-A1. Such a “specificity” as described above can - for example - be analyzed with an ELISA. Preferred embodiments of the present invention disclose antigen recognizing constructs which are in the form of an antibody, or derivative or fragment thereof, or a Τ cell receptor (TCR), or derivative or fragment thereof. Fragments or derivatives of the herein disclosed antibodies or TCRs preferably still harbor the antigenic specificity (the binding function with respect to the antigen) as the original antibody or TCR, respectively. Native alpha-beta heterodimeric TCRs have an alpha chain and a beta chain. Each chain comprises variable, joining and constant regions, and the beta chain also usually contains a short diversity region between the variable and joining regions, but this diversity region is often considered as part of the joining region. Each variable region comprises three CDRs (Complementarity Determining Regions) embedded in a framework sequence, one being the hypervariable region named CDR3. There are several types of alpha chain variable (Va) regions and several types of beta chain variable (νβ) regions distinguished by their framework, CDR1 and CDR2 sequences, and by a partly defined CDR3 sequence. The Va types are referred to in IMGT nomenclature by a unique TRAV number. Thus, a further embodiment of the present invention pertains to an ARC comprising an alpha chain variable region, wherein said alpha chain variable region comprises a CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3 that comprise an amino acid sequence that is at least 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 98%, 99% or preferably 100% identical to the amino acid sequence of the corresponding CDR1 and CDR2 of the Va-type TRAV5 (according to IMGT nomenclature) and CDR3: CAESIGSNSGYALNF; or a CDR1 and CDR2 of the Va-type TRAV13-1 and CDR3: CAARPNSGNTPLVF; or a CDR1 and CDR2 of the Va-type TRAV 12-3 and CAMSDTGNQFYF. Another embodiment of the present invention pertains to an ARC comprising a beta chain variable region, wherein said beta chain variable region comprises a CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3 that comprise an amino acid sequence that is at least 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 98%, 99% or preferably 100% identical to the respective amino acid sequence of a CDR1 and CDR2 of the νβ-ΐγρ℮ TRBV28 (according to IMGT nomenclature) and CDR3: CASRGLAGYEQYF; or a CDR1 and CDR2 of the VP-type TRBV29-1 and CDR3: CSVEQDTNTGELFF; or a CDR1 and CDR2 of the VP-type TRBV13 and the CDR3: C AS SFRGGG AN VLTF. In one preferred embodiment the aforementioned ARC comprises an alpha chain and beta chain with the above referenced variable regions, preferably in the combination as indicated in table 1 below. Preferred are ARCs of the invention which comprise at least one, preferably all three CDR sequences CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3.

The ARC is in preferred embodiments selected from an antibody or a TCR, but TCRs are preferred. For the purposes of the present invention, a TCR is a moiety having at least one TCR alpha and/or TCR beta variable domain. Generally they comprise both a TCR alpha variable domain and a TCR beta variable domain. They may be αβ heterodimers or may be single chain format. For use in adoptive therapy, an αβ heterodimeric TCR may, for example, be transfected as full length chains having both cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains. If desired, an introduced disulfide bond between residues of the respective constant domains may be present. In one preferred embodiment of the first aspect of the invention, the antigen recognizing construct is as described above a TCR. The TCR preferably comprises at least one alpha and/or beta TCR chain, wherein said TCR chain is encoded by at least one nucleic acid, the nucleic acid comprising a nucleotide sequence selected from (i) the TCR chain encoding sequences comprised in SEQ ID No. 13 to 21, or (ii) a sequence having at least 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 98%, 99% or 100% identity to a TCR encoding sequence comprised in SEQ ID No. 13 to 21, or (iii) a sequence that due to the degeneracy of the genetic code encodes for an identical TCR as any one of the TCR en-coding sequences comprised in SEQ ID No. 13 to 21, but has a different sequence. SEQ ID Nos. 13 to 21 depict the nucleotide sequences of the vector maps of figures 8 to 16. Each of these vectors comprise an alpha and a beta chain of a TCR of the present invention. In the figures the beta chain is located upstream of the alpha chain sequence. As also described below, the invention exemplary describes three isolated TCRs, which were to different degrees optimized by murinization of the original sequence of the constant domain of the TCR chains. The abbreviation in the vector designation “he” stands for the complete human variant of the TCR, “me” for a complete murinized constant domain in the TCR chain, whereas “mmc” depicts minimal murinization in the constant domain of the TCR chain. The exact location of the alpha and beta chains in the vector maps (and thus in the corresponding sequences) can be derived from the figure legend. In one preferred embodiment of alternative (i) as described before, the TCR comprises the alpha and beta chain sequence as comprised together in any one of SEQ ID No. 13 to 21. In one additional preferred embodiment of the first aspect of the invention, the antigen recognizing construct is as described above a TCR.

An scTCR can comprise a polypeptide of a variable region of a first TCR chain (e.g., an alpha chain) and a polypeptide of an entire (full-length) second TCR chain (e.g., a beta chain), or vice versa. Furthermore, the scTCR can optionally comprise one or more linkers which join the two or more polypeptides together. The linker can be, for instance, a peptide which joins together two single chains, as described herein. Also provided is such a scTCR of the invention, which is fused to a human cytokine, such as IL-2, IL-7 or IL-15. The antigen recognizing construct according to the invention can also be provided in the form of a multimeric complex, comprising at least two scTCR molecules, wherein said scTCR molecules are each fused to at least one biotin moiety, and wherein said scTCRs are interconnected by biotin-strepavidin interaction to allow the formation of said multimeric complex. Also provided are multimeric complexes of a higher order, comprising more than two scTCR of the invention. In one embodiment the antigen recognizing construct according to the invention is an antibody, or a fragment thereof. The term “antibody” in its various grammatical forms is used herein to refer to immunoglobulin molecules and immunologically active portions of immunoglobulin molecules, i.e., molecules that contain an antibody combining site or a paratope. Such molecules are also referred to as "antigen binding fragments" of immunoglobulin molecules. The invention further provides an antibody, or antigen binding portion thereof, which specifically binds to the antigens described herein. The antibody can be any type of immunoglobulin that is known in the art. For instance, the antibody can be of any isotype, e.g., IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, IgM, etc. The antibody can be monoclonal or polyclonal. The antibody can be a naturally-occurring antibody, e.g., an antibody isolated and/or purified from a mammal, e.g., mouse, rabbit, goat, horse, chicken, hamster, human, etc. Alternatively, the antibody can be a genetically-engineered antibody, e.g., a humanized antibody or a chimeric antibody. The antibody can be in monomeric or polymeric form. The invention also provides antigen binding portions of any of the antibodies described herein. The antigen binding portion can be any portion that has at least one antigen binding site, such as Fab, F(ab')2, dsFv, sFv, diabodies, and triabodies. A single-chain variable region fragment (sFv) antibody fragment, which consists of a truncated Fab fragment comprising the variable (V) domain of an antibody heavy chain linked to a V domain of a light antibody chain via a synthetic peptide, can be generated using routine recombinant DNA technology techniques. Similarly, disulfide-stabilized variable region fragments (dsFv) can be prepared by recombinant DNA technology, antibody fragments of the invention, however, are not limited to these exemplary types of antibody fragments. Also, the antibody, or antigen binding portion thereof, can be modified to comprise a detectable label, such as, for instance, a radioisotope, a fluorophore (e.g., fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), phycocrythrin (ΡΕ)), an enzyme (e.g., alkaline phosphatase, horseradish peroxidase), and element particles (e.g., gold particles). In an embodiment of the invention the antigen recognizing construct binds to a human leucocyte antigen (HLA) presented peptide, preferably by HLA-A02, of MAGE. In a preferred embodiment the antigen recognizing construct specifically binds to the human MAGE-Α1278-286 epitope. In a preferred embodiment the antigen recognizing construct is a human TCR, or fragment or derivative thereof. A human TCR or fragment or derivative thereof is a TCR which comprises over 50% of the corresponding human TCR sequence. Preferably only a small part of the TCR sequence is of artificial origin or derived from other species. It is known however, that chimeric TCRs e.g. from human origin with murine sequences in the constant domains, are advantageous. Particularly preferred are therefore TCRs in accordance with the present invention, which contain murine sequences in the extracellular part of their constant domains. Thus, it is also preferred that the inventive antigen recognizing construct is able to recognize its antigen in a human leucocyte antigen (HLA) dependent manner, preferably in a HLA-A02 dependent manner. The term “HLA dependent manner” in the context of the present invention means that the antigen recognizing construct binds to the antigen only in the event that the antigenic peptide is presented by HLA. The antigen recognizing construct in accordance with the invention in one embodiment preferably induces an immune response, preferably wherein the immune response is characterized by the increase in interferon (IFN) γ levels. A preferred embodiment of the invention pertains to the antigen recognizing construct which is a Τ cell receptor, and which comprises in its alpha chain a CDR3 having at least 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 98%, 99% or 100% sequence identity to an amino acid sequence selected from SEQ ID Nos. 1 to 3, and/or comprises in its beta chain an CDR3 having at least 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 98%, 99% or 100% sequence identity to an amino acid sequence selected from SEQ ID Nos. 4 to 6.

The nucleic acid used can be contained in a vector suitable for allowing expression of the nucleic acid sequence corresponding to the peptide in a cell. However, the nucleic acids can also be used to transform a presenting cell, which shall not be restricted to classical antigen-presenting cells such as dendritic cells, in such a way that they themselves produce the corresponding proteins on their cellular surface. By “nucleic acid” as used herein includes “polynucleotide,” “oligonucleotide,” and “nucleic acid molecule,” and generally means a polymer of DNA or RNA, which can be singlestranded or double-stranded, synthesized or obtained (e.g., isolated and/or purified) from natural sources, which can contain natural, non-natural or altered nucleotides, and which can contain a natural, non-natural or altered intemucleotide linkage, such as a phosphoroamidate linkage or a phosphorothioate linkage, instead of the phosphodiester found between the nucleotides of an unmodified oligonucleotide. Preferably, the nucleic acids of the invention are recombinant. As used herein, the term “recombinant” refers to (i) molecules that are constructed outside living cells by joining natural or synthetic nucleic acid segments to nucleic acid molecules that can replicate in a living cell, or (ii) molecules that result from the replication of those described in (i) above.

Figure 17: Τ2 cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of MAGE-Α1278 and cocultured with human Τ cells that had been transduced with different TCRs as indicated.

Functional response was assessed based on IFNy production. Figure 19: Τ2 cells were loaded with one of 114 different HLA-A2 restricted self-peptides at a concentration of 10-5 mo 1/1 and co-cultured with Τ cells from 2 different donors that were transduced with TCR 1367.

EXAMPLES Example 1: Generation of T-cells with a MAGE epitope using the ABahDII mouse Figure 2 shows the location of the HLA-A2 restricted epitope MAGE-Α1278-286 is shown in relation to the full-length MAGE-A1 protein (top). The human MAGE-Α1278-286 epitope is sufficiently different from its mouse homologue to prevent tolerance against human MAGE-AI278-286 in ABahDII mice (bottom). MAGE-A1 is expressed in a variety of human tumors, whereas its expression on normal human tissue is believed to be restricted to the testes. Therefore, specific targeting of MAGE-A1 expressing cells should limit toxicity to a minimum. ABabDII mice were immunized with a 30mer peptide encompassing the nonamer MAGE-Α1278-286 plus CpG in incomplete Freund’s adjuvant. Boosts were performed with the nonamer MAGE-Ai278-286 plus CpG in incomplete Freund’s adjuvant. On the day of analysis, blood was taken and stained with a MAGE-A1/HLA-A2 specific tetramer and with antibodies for certain TRBV chains (IMGT nomenclature). After several boosts a monoclonal population of MAGE-AI specific Τ cells is detectable in the blood of ABabDII mice. Figure 3 shows the immune response of the immunized animal and the immunization scheme. A significant shift in FACS analysis of the immunized cells is observed with the tetramer staining indicating that MAGE specific Τ cells were generated. Example 2: Isolation and characterization of Τ cell receptors The cDNA from MAGE-AI specific Τ cell clones as generated in Example 1 was amplified by 5’-RACE and sequenced. The table 1 shows the amino acid sequences of complementary determining region 3 (CDR3) of the alpha and beta chains for three different TCRs from ABabDII mice and two TCRs obtained from healthy humans (Ottaviani, S., Zhang, Υ., Boon, Τ., & van der Bruggen, Ρ. (2005). A MAGE-1 antigenic peptide recognized by human cytolytic Τ lymphocytes on HLA-Α2 tumor cells. Cancer Immunology, Immunotherapy: CII, 54(12), 1214-1220.).

(2005). Cancer Immunology, Immunotherapy, 54(12), 1214-1220 The isolated TCR which comprise the above CDR3 sequences were then cloned. The retroviral vector ΜΡ71 is used for transduction of primary human peripheral blood lymphocytes (hPBLs). The alpha and beta genes of each TCR are linked with a Ρ2Α element which is cut by a cellular protease during translation of the transduced TCR ensuring equimolar expression of both chains (Figure 4). All genes are codon optimized for optimal expression. In order to further optimize expression in hPBLs additional modifications were introduced into the wild-type TCR constant regions. Complete (A) and minimal (Β) murinization of the constant regions of the TCR chains usually result in higher expression levels in hPBLs than the unmodified human constant region (C). Then hCD8+ Jurkat 76 cells were transduced with different TCRs derived from ABabDII mice and human volunteers. Transduced cells stain positive for CD3. All transduced cells specifically bind the MAGE-A1/HLA-A2 tetramer (Figure 5). Surprisingly, the TCRs of the present invention provide an unusually high avidity compared to the TCRs of the state of the art. hPBLs were transduced with different MAGE-A1 specific TCRs. The transduced PBLs were then incubated with Τ2 cells, which had been pulsed with different concentrations of MAGE-A1278-286 peptide. After overnight incubation 1ΕΝγproduction was measured by ELISA. In response to stimulation with peptide pulsed Τ2 cells the TCRs from ABabDII mice (Figure 6, closed circles) show a response at lower peptide concentrations and a higher amount of IFNy-production than the TCRs derived from the tolerant human system (Figure 6, open circles). This was further confirmed by testing tumor cell recognition using the TCRs of the invention (Figure 7). Transduced hBLs were incubated with different tumor cell lines. After overnight incubation IFNy-production was measured by ELISA. The transduced hPBLs specifically recognize MAGE-A1 in the context of HLA-A2 restricted presentation. PBLs transduced with TCRs from ABabDII mice (full bars) produce higher amounts of IFNy than those transduced with TCRs from the human repertoire (shaded bars) when incubated with MAGE-A1 expressing tumor cell lines. Example 3: Sensitivity and Specificity of the TCR of the Invention MAGE-A1278 antigen was presented on Τ2 cells. The antigen presenting Τ2 cells were co-cultured with T-cells expressing the TCR of the invention or a control TCR (CTL27). As shown in figure 17 Τ cells modified with inventive TCRs from ABabDII mice (solid lines) respond to lower amounts of antigen than those modified with a human TCR (dash-dotted line). (One representative example out of 3 independent experiments is shown). These results indicate the surprisingly improved (by at least one order of magnitude) sensitivity of the TCR of the invention compared to state of the art TCR. In order to test the specificity of the TCR of the invention over closely related MAGE antigenic epitopes, the TCRs were brought into contact with the MAGE antigens KVLEFVAKV (MAGE-B16) and KVLEYLAKV (MAGE-B5). The antigens were presented by Τ2 cells which were then co-cultured with T-cells expressing the TCR of the invention and a control. Intcrfcron-y release was measured. As can be seen from figure 18, the TCR of the invention significantly recognized the MAGE-A 1 278 antigen and not the varients of the epitope. The specificity was much better compared to the control TCR. The high specificity of the TCR of the invention was confirmed in an experiment testing 144 human HLA-A2 restricted self-antigens. Figure 19 shows that donor Τ cells transfected with TCR 1367 specifically detected MAGE-A1 and not any other tested self-antigen, demonstrating the surprisingly high degree of specificity of the TCR of the invention. Furthermore 106 murine MAGE-A1 expressing fibrosarcoma cells were injected into immunodeficient mice and grown to a clinically relevant size of approximately 500 mm3 tumor volume. To treat the tumors 106 MAGE-A1 specific Τ cells bearing the either one of 2 TCRs from ABabDII mice (1367, 1405) or a human TCR (CTL27) were injected. In the control group, 106 Τ cells bearing an irrelevant TCR were injected. Treatment response was assessed 14 days after T-cell injection based on tumor volume. The results are provided in table 2 below. In the groups treated with ABabDII TCRs 100% and 67% of the animals responded to treatment. On the contrary, none of the animals treated with Τ cells transduced with a human TCR or an irrelevant TCR responded.
