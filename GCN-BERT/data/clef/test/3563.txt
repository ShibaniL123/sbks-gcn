This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/708,383, filed Dec. 7, 2012, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/568,133, filed Dec. 7, 2011, and U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/623,274, filed Apr. 12, 2012, each of which is hereby incorporated by reference. TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to biodegradable lipids and to their use for the delivery of active agents such as nucleic acids. BACKGROUND Therapeutic nucleic acids include, e.g., small interfering RNA (siRNA), micro RNA (miRNA), antisense oligonucleotides, ribozymes, plasmids, immune stimulating nucleic acids, antisense, antagomir, antimir, microRNA mimic, supermir, U1 adaptor, and aptamer. In the case of siRNA or miRNA, these nucleic acids can down-regulate intracellular levels of specific proteins through a process termed RNA interference (RNAi). The therapeutic applications of RNAi are extremely broad, since siRNA and miRNA constructs can be synthesized with any nucleotide sequence directed against a target protein. To date, siRNA constructs have shown the ability to specifically down-regulate target proteins in both in vitro and in vivo models. In addition, siRNA constructs are currently being evaluated in clinical studies. However, two problems currently faced by siRNA or miRNA constructs are, first, their susceptibility to nuclease digestion in plasma and, second, their limited ability to gain access to the intracellular compartment where they can bind the protein RISC when administered systemically as the free siRNA or miRNA. Lipid nanoparticles formed from cationic lipids with other lipid components, such as cholesterol and PEG lipids, and oligonucleotides (such as siRNA and miRNA) have been used to facilitate the cellular uptake of the oligonucleotides. There remains a need for improved cationic lipids and lipid nanoparticles for the delivery of oligonucleotides. Preferably, these lipid nanoparticles would provide high drug:lipid ratios, protect the nucleic acid from degradation and clearance in serum, be suitable for systemic delivery, and provide intracellular delivery of the nucleic acid. In addition, these lipid-nucleic acid particles should be well-tolerated and provide an adequate therapeutic index, such that patient treatment at an effective dose of the nucleic acid is not associated with significant toxicity and/or risk to the patient. SUMMARY The present invention relates to a cationic lipid and PEG lipid suitable for forming nucleic acid-lipid particles. Each of the cationic and PEG lipids of the present invention includes one or more biodegradable groups. The biodegradable groups are located in a lipidic moiety (e.g., a hydrophobic chain) of the cationic or PEG lipid. These cationic and PEG lipids may be incorporated into a lipid particle for delivering an active agent, such as a nucleic acid (e.g., an siRNA). The incorporation of the biodegradable group(s) into the lipid results in faster metabolism and removal of the lipid from the body following delivery of the active agent to a target area. As a result, these lipids have lower toxicity than similar lipids without the biodegradable groups. In one embodiment, the cationic lipid is a compound of formula (I), which has a branched alkyl at the alpha position adjacent to the biodegradable group (between the biodegradable group and the tertiary carbon): or a salt thereof (e.g., a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof), wherein R′ is absent, hydrogen, or alkyl (e.g., C1-C4 alkyl); with respect to R1 and R2, (i) R1 and R2 are each, independently, optionally substituted alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkylalkyl, heterocycle, or R10;(ii) R1 and R2, together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached, form an optionally substituted heterocylic ring; or(iii) one of R1 and R2 is optionally substituted alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkylalkyl, or heterocycle, and the other forms a 4-10 member heterocyclic ring or heteroaryl (e.g., a 6-member ring) with (a) the adjacent nitrogen atom and (b) the (R)a group adjacent to the nitrogen atom; each occurrence of R is, independently, —(CR3R4)—; each occurrence of R3 and R4 are, independently H, halogen, OH, alkyl, alkoxy, —NH2, R10, alkylamino, or dialkylamino (in one preferred embodiment, each occurrence of R3 and R4 are, independently H or C1-C4 alkyl); each occurrence of R10 is independently selected from PEG and polymers based on poly(oxazoline), poly(ethylene oxide), poly(vinyl alcohol), poly(glycerol), poly(N-vinylpyrrolidone), poly[N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide] and poly(amino acid)s, wherein (i) the PEG or polymer is linear or branched, (ii) the PEG or polymer is polymerized by n subunits, (iii) n is a number-averaged degree of polymerization between 10 and 200 units, and (iv) wherein the compound of formula has at most two R10 groups (preferably at most one R10 group); the dashed line to Q is absent or a bond; when the dashed line to Q is absent then Q is absent or is —O—, —NH—, —S—, —C(O)—, —C(O)O—, —OC(O)—, —C(O)N(R4)—, —N(R5)C(O)—, —S—S—, —OC(O)O—, —O—N═C(R5)—, —C(R5)═N—O—, —OC(O)N(R5)—, —N(R5)C(O)N(R5)—, —N(R5)C(O)O—, —C(O)S—, —C(S)O— or —C(R5)═N—O—C(O)—; or when the dashed line to Q is a bond then (i) b is 0 and (ii) Q and the tertiary carbon adjacent to it (C*) form a substituted or unsubstituted, mono- or bi-cyclic heterocyclic group having from 5 to 10 ring atoms (e.g., the heteroatoms in the heterocyclic group are selected from O and S, preferably O); each occurrence of R5 is, independently, H or alkyl (e.g. C1-C4 alkyl); X and Y are each, independently, alkylene or alkenylene (e.g., C4 to C20 alkylene or C4 to C20 alkenylene); M1 and M2 are each, independently, a biodegradable group (e.g., —OC(O)—, —C(O)O—, —SC(O)—, —C(O)S—, —OC(S)—, —C(S)O—, —S—S—, —C(R5)═N—, —N═C(R5)—, —C(R5)═N—O—, —O—N═C(R5)—, —C(O)(NR5)—, —N(R5)C(O)—, —C(S)(NR5)—, —N(R5)C(O)—, —N(R5)C(O)N(R5)—, —OC(O)O—, —OSi(R5)2O—, —C(O)(CR3R4)C(O)O—, —OC(O)(CR3R4)C(O)—, or (wherein R11 is a C2-C8 alkyl or alkenyl)); each occurrence of Rz is, independently, C1-C8 alkyl (e.g., methyl, ethyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, n-pentyl, or n-hexyl); a is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6; b is 0, 1, 2, or 3; and Z1 and Z2 are each, independently, C8-C14 alkyl or C8-C14 alkenyl, wherein the alkenyl group may optionally be substituted with one or two fluorine atoms at the alpha position to a double bond which is between the double bond and the terminus of Z1 or Z2 (e.g., The R′R1R2N—(R)a-Q-(R)b— group can be any of the head groups described herein, including those shown in Table 1 below, and salts thereof.

In certain embodiments, the biodegradable group present in the cationic lipid is selected from an ester (e.g., —C(O)O— or —OC(O)—), disulfide (—S—S—), oxime (e.g., —C(H)═N—O— or —O—N═C(H)—), —C(O)—O—, —OC(O)—, —C(R5)═N—, —N═C(R5)—, —C(R5)═N—O—, —O—N═C(R5)—, —O—C(O)O—, —C(O)N(R5), —N(R5)C(O)—, —C(S)(NR5)—, (NR5)C(S)—, —N(R5)C(O)N(R5)—, —C(O)S—, —SC(O)—, —C(S)O—, —OC(S)—, —OSi(R5)2O—, —C(O)(CR3R4)C(O)O—, or —OC(O)(CR3R4)C(O)—. A suitable cholesterol moiety for the cationic lipids of the present invention (including compounds of formulas I-VI) has the formula: Additional embodiments include a cationic lipid having a head group, one or more hydrophobic tails, and a central moiety between the head group and the one or more tails. The head group can include an amine; for example an amine having a desired pKa. The pKa can be influenced by the structure of the lipid, particularly the nature of head group; e.g., the presence, absence, and location of functional groups such as anionic functional groups, hydrogen bond donor functional groups, hydrogen bond acceptor groups, hydrophobic groups (e.g., aliphatic groups), hydrophilic groups (e.g., hydroxyl or methoxy), or aryl groups. The head group amine can be a cationic amine; a primary, secondary, or tertiary amine; the head group can include one amine group (monoamine), two amine groups (diamine), three amine groups (triamine), or a larger number of amine groups, as in an oligoamine or polyamine. The head group can include a functional group that is less strongly basic than an amine, such as, for example, an imidazole, a pyridine, or a guanidinium group. The head group can be zwitterionic. Other head groups are suitable as well. Representative central moieties include, but are not limited to, a central carbon atom, a central nitrogen atom, a central carbocyclic group, a central aryl group, a central hetrocyclic group (e.g., central tetrahydrofuranyl group or central pyrrolidinyl group) and a central heteroaryl group. Additionally, the central moiety can include, for example, a glyceride linker, an acyclic glyceride analog linker, or a cyclic linker (including a spiro linker, a bicyclic linker, and a polycyclic linker). The central moiety can include functional groups such as an ether, an ester, a phosphate, a phosphonate, a phosphorothioate, a sulfonate, a disulfide, an acetal, a ketal, an imine, a hydrazone, or an oxime. Other central moieties and functional groups are suitable as well. In one embodiment, the cationic lipid is a racemic mixture. In another embodiment, the cationic lipid is enriched in one diastereomer, e.g. the cationic lipid has at least 95%, at least 90%, at least 80% or at least 70% diastereomeric excess. In yet another embodiment, the cationic lipid is enriched in one enantiomer, e.g. the lipid has at least 95%, at least 90%, at least 80% or at least 70% enantiomer excess. In yet another embodiment, the cationic lipid is chirally pure, e.g. is a single optical isomer. In yet another embodiment, the cationic lipid is enriched for one optical isomer. Where a double bond is present (e.g., a carbon-carbon double bond or carbon-nitrogen double bond), there can be isomerism in the configuration about the double bond (i.e. cis/trans or E/Z isomerism). Where the configuration of a double bond is illustrated in a chemical structure, it is understood that the corresponding isomer can also be present. The amount of isomer present can vary, depending on the relative stabilities of the isomers and the energy required to convert between the isomers. Accordingly, some double bonds are, for practical purposes, present in only a single configuration, whereas others (e.g., where the relative stabilities are similar and the energy of conversion low) may be present as inseparable equilibrium mixture of configurations. In some cases, a double-bonded unsaturation is replaced by a cyclic unsaturation. The cyclic unsaturation can be a cycloaliphatic unsaturation, e.g., a cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, cycloheptyl, or cyclooctyl group. In some cases, the cyclic group can be a polycyclic group, e.g., a bicyclic group or tricyclic group. A bicyclic group can be bridged, fused, or have a spiro structure. In some cases, a double bond moiety can be replaced by a cyclopropyl moiety, e.g., can be replaced by The cationic lipid includes one or more biodegradable groups. The biodegradable group(s) include one or more bonds that may undergo bond breaking reactions in a biological environment, e.g., in an organism, organ, tissue, cell, or organelle. Functional groups that contain a biodegradable bond include, for example, esters, dithiols, and oximes. Biodegradation can be a factor that influences the clearance of the compound from the body when administered to a subject. Biodegredation can be measured in a cell based assay, where a formulation including a cationic lipid is exposed to cells, and samples are taken at various time points. The lipid fractions can be extracted from the cells and separated and analyzed by LC-MS. From the LC-MS data, rates of biodegradation (e.g., as t1/2 values) can be measured. For example, the compound includes an ester linkage in each aliphatic chain, which can undergo hydrolysis in a biological environment, for example, when exposed to, e.g., a lipase or an esterase. The structure of the compound, of course, influences the rate at which the compound undergoes biodegradation. Thus, a compound where the methyl substituent is on the other side of the biodegradable group such as would be expected to exhibit a different rate of biodegradation. Greater effects on that rate would be expected from changes in the structure of the compound at the site of hydrolysis. One modification that can influence the rate of hydrolysis, and thereby influence the rate of biodegradation and clearance from a subject's body, is to make the leaving group of the hydrolysis reaction have a secondary, rather than primary, alcohol. For example, without wishing to be bound by theory, Compound 1 shown above may be metabolized as shown in the scheme below: In one embodiment, a cationic lipid of any of the embodiments described herein has an in vivo half life (t1/2) (e.g., in the liver, spleen or plasma) of less than about 3 hours, such as less than about 2.5 hours, less than about 2 hours, less than about 1.5 hours, less than about 1 hour, less than about 0.5 hour or less than about 0.25 hours. The cationic lipid preferably remains intact, or has a half-life sufficient to form a stable lipid nanoparticle which effectively delivers the desired active pharmaceutical ingredient (e.g., a nucleic acid) to its target but thereafter rapidly degrades to minimize any side effects to the subject. For instance, in mice, the cationic lipid preferably has a t1/2 in the spleen of from about 1 to about 7 hours. In another embodiment, a cationic lipid of any of the embodiments described herein containing a biodegradable group or groups has an in vivo half life (t1/2) (e.g., in the liver, spleen or plasma) of less than about 10% (e.g., less than about 7.5%, less than about 5%, less than about 2.5%) of that for the same cationic lipid without the biodegradable group or groups. Some cationic lipids can be conveniently represented as a hydrophobic group combined via a central moiety (such as a carbon atom) with a headgroup. By way of example, the compound: can be thought of as a combination of a headgroup, a central moiety, and two hydrophobic groups as follows: The present invention includes compounds composed of any combination of the head and hydrophobic groups listed below (in combination with a central moiety (such as a central carbon atom).

Other suitable primary groups include those in table 1B below: TABLE 1B Some suitable hydrophobic tail groups include those depicted in Table 1C: TABLE 1C Other suitable tail groups includes those of the formula —R12-M1-R13 where R12 is a C4-C14 alkyl or C4-C14 alkenyl, M1 is a biodegradable group as defined above, and R13 is a branched alkyl or alkenyl (e.g., a C10-C20 alkyl or C10-C20 alkenyl), such that (i) the chain length of —R12-M1-R13 is at most 21 atoms (i.e., the total length of the tail from the first carbon after the tertiary carbon (marked with an asterisk) to a terminus of the tail is at most 21), and (ii) the group —R12-M1-R13 has at least 20 carbon atoms (e.g., at least 21 or 22 carbon atoms). In one preferred embodiment, the chain length of —R12-M1-R13 is at most 21 (e.g., at most 20). For example, the chain length can be from about 17 to about 24 or from about 18 to about 20. In one embodiment, the total carbon atom content of each tail (—R12-M1-R13) is from about 17 to about 26. For example, the total carbon atom content can be from about 19 to about 26 or from about 21 to about 26. In one embodiment, the tail has the formula: where R13 is an alkyl or alkenyl group having from about 13 to about 17 carbon atoms, and the total carbon length of the tail from the first carbon (the leftmost carbon atom above) to a terminus of the tail is at most 20. Preferably, the tail has from about 22 to about 26 carbon atoms. In one embodiment, the maximum length of R13 from its attachment point to the ester group of the compound is 12 carbon atoms (e.g., the maximum length can be 11 carbon atoms). In one preferred embodiment, the branch in the alkyl or alkenyl group is at the δ-position or later from the point of attachment of R13 to the ester group. Suitable R13 groups include, but are not limited to For example, the cationic lipid can be or a salt thereof (e.g., a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof), where R13 is selected from the groups mentioned above. Another example is a tail of the formula where R13 is an alkyl or alkenyl group having from about 13 to about 15 carbon atoms, and the total carbon length of the tail from the first carbon (i.e., the leftmost carbon atom, which is attached to a tertiary carbon) to a terminus of the tail is at most 20. Preferably, the tail has from about 24 to about 26 carbon atoms. In one embodiment, the maximum length of R13 from its attachment point to the ester group of the compound is 10 carbon atoms (e.g., the maximum length can be 9 carbon atoms). In one preferred embodiment, the branch in the alkyl or alkenyl group is at the δ-position or later from the point of attachment of R13 to the ester group. Suitable R13 groups include, but are not limited to For example, the cationic lipid can be or a salt thereof (e.g., a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof), where R13 is selected from the groups above. The R13 group may be derived from a natural product, such as dihydrocitgronellol, lavandulol, phytol, or dihydrophytol. In one embodiment, the R13 group in the tails above is a dihydrocitronellol group (either as a racemic group or a chirally pure group): For example, the cationic lipid having a dihydroitronellol group can be or a salt thereof.

Each asymmetric carbon atom in the compounds below can be either chirally pure (R or S) or racemic. These cationic lipids as well as those in the working examples (such as Examples 36 and 37) are suitable for forming nucleic acid-lipid particles. In another aspect, the present invention relates to a method of preparing a compound of Formula I-VII. Suitable exemplary synthetic methods are illustrated in Schemes 1-27 shown in the Examples section below. In one embodiment, the cationic lipid of the present invention is selected from the following compounds, and salts thereof (including pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof). These cationic lipids are suitable for forming nucleic acid-lipid particles. In another embodiment, the cationic lipid of the present invention is selected from the following compounds, and salts thereof (including pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof): In another embodiment, the cationic lipid of the present invention is selected from the following compounds, and salts thereof (including pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof): Additional representative cationic lipids include, but are not limited to: Alternatively, for the compounds above having a head of the formula (where X can be, for example, —C(O)O—), the head can have one methylene unit between the X group (or other functional group) and nitrogen atom. For example, the head can be: Cationic lipids include those having alternative fatty acid groups and other dialkylamino groups than those shown, including those in which the alkyl substituents are different (e.g., N-ethyl-N-methylamino-, and N-propyl-N-ethylamino-). In certain embodiments, the cationic lipids have at least one protonatable or deprotonatable group, such that the lipid is positively charged at a pH at or below physiological pH (e.g. pH 7.4), and neutral at a second pH, preferably at or above physiological pH. Such lipids are also referred to as cationic lipids. It will, of course, be understood that the addition or removal of protons as a function of pH is an equilibrium process, and that the reference to a charged or a neutral lipid refers to the nature of the predominant species and does not require that all of the lipid be present in the charged or neutral form. The lipids can have more than one protonatable or deprotonatable group, or can be zwiterrionic. In certain embodiments, protonatable lipids (i.e., cationic lipids) have a pKa of the protonatable group in the range of about 4 to about 11. For example, the lipids can have a pKa of about 4 to about 7, e.g., from about 5 to about 7, such as from about 5.5 to about 6.8, when incorporated into lipid particles. Such lipids may be cationic at a lower pH formulation stage, while particles will be largely (though not completely) surface neutralized at physiological pH around pH 7.4. In particular embodiments, the lipids are charged lipids. As used herein, the term “charged lipid” includes, but is not limited to, those lipids having one or two fatty acyl or fatty alkyl chains and a quaternary amino head group. The quaternary amine carries a permanent positive charge. The head group can optionally include an ionizable group, such as a primary, secondary, or tertiary amine that may be protonated at physiological pH. The presence of the quaternary amine can alter the pKa of the ionizable group relative to the pKa of the group in a structurally similar compound that lacks the quaternary amine (e.g., the quaternary amine is replaced by a tertiary amine). Included in the instant invention is the free form of the cationic lipids described herein, as well as pharmaceutically acceptable salts and stereoisomers thereof. The cationic lipid can be a protonated salt of the amine cationic lipid. The term “free form” refers to the amine cationic lipids in non-salt form. The free form may be regenerated by treating the salt with a suitable dilute aqueous base solution such as dilute aqueous NaOH, potassium carbonate, ammonia and sodium bicarbonate. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the instant cationic lipids can be synthesized from the cationic lipids of this invention which contain a basic or acidic moiety by conventional chemical methods. Generally, the salts of the basic cationic lipids are prepared either by ion exchange chromatography or by reacting the free base with stoichiometric amounts or with an excess of the desired salt-forming inorganic or organic acid in a suitable solvent or various combinations of solvents. Similarly, the salts of the acidic compounds are formed by reactions with the appropriate inorganic or organic base. Thus, pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the cationic lipids of this invention include non-toxic salts of the cationic lipids of this invention as formed by reacting a basic instant cationic lipids with an inorganic or organic acid. For example, non-toxic salts include those derived from inorganic acids such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, sulfamic, phosphoric, nitric and the like, as well as salts prepared from organic acids such as acetic, propionic, succinic, glycolic, stearic, lactic, malic, tartaric, citric, ascorbic, pamoic, maleic, hydroxymaleic, phenylacetic, glutamic, benzoic, salicylic, sulfanilic, 2-acetoxy-benzoic, fumaric, toluenesulfonic, methanesulfonic, ethane disulfonic, oxalic, isethionic, and trifluoroacetic (TFA). When the cationic lipids of the present invention are acidic, suitable “pharmaceutically acceptable salts” refers to salts prepared form pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic bases including inorganic bases and organic bases. Salts derived from inorganic bases include aluminum, ammonium, calcium, copper, ferric, ferrous, lithium, magnesium, manganic salts, manganous, potassium, sodium, and zinc. In one embodiment, the base is selected from ammonium, calcium, magnesium, potassium and sodium. Salts derived from pharmaceutically acceptable organic non-toxic bases include salts of primary, secondary and tertiary amines, substituted amines including naturally occurring substituted amines, cyclic amines and basic ion exchange resins, such as arginine, betaine caffeine, choline, N,N1-dibenzylethylenediamine, diethylamin, 2-diethylaminoethanol, 2-dimethylaminoethanol, ethanolamine, ethylenediamine, N-ethylmorpholine, N-ethylpiperidine, glucamine, glucosamine, histidine, hydrabamine, isopropylamine, lysine, methylglucamine, morpholine, piperazine, piperidine, polyamine resins, procaine, purines, theobromine, triethylamine, trimethylamine tripropylamine, and tromethamine. It will also be noted that the cationic lipids of the present invention may potentially be internal salts or zwitterions, since under physiological conditions a deprotonated acidic moiety in the compound, such as a carboxyl group, may be anionic, and this electronic charge might then be balanced off internally against the cationic charge of a protonated or alkylated basic moiety, such as a quaternary nitrogen atom. One or more additional cationic lipids, which carry a net positive charge at about physiological pH, in addition to those specifically described above, may also be included in the lipid particles and compositions described herein. Such cationic lipids include, but are not limited to N,N-dioleyl-N,N-dimethylammonium chloride (“DODAC”); N-(2,3-dioleyloxyl)propyl-N,N—N-triethylammonium chloride (“DOTMA”); N,N-distearyl-N,N-dimethylammonium bromide (“DDAB”); N-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl)-N,N,N-trimethylammonium chloride (“DOTAP”); 1,2-Dioleyloxy-3-trimethylaminopropane chloride salt (“DOTAP.Cl”); 3β-(N—(N′,N′-dimethylaminoethane)-carbamoyl)cholesterol (“DC-Chol”), N-(1-(2,3-dioleyloxyl)propyl)-N-2-(sperminecarboxamido)ethyl)-N,N-dimethylammonium trifluoracetate (“DOSPA”), dioctadecylamidoglycyl carboxyspermine (“DOGS”), 1,2-dileoyl-sn-3-phosphoethanolamine (“DOPE”), 1,2-dioleoyl-3-dimethylammonium propane (“DODAP”), N,N-dimethyl-2,3-dioleyloxy)propylamine (“DODMA”), and N-(1,2-dimyristyloxyprop-3-yl)-N,N-dimethyl-N-hydroxyethyl ammonium bromide (“DMRIE”). Additionally, a number of commercial preparations of cationic lipids can be used, such as, e.g., LIPOFECTIN (including DOTMA and DOPE, available from GIBCO/BRL), and LIPOFECTAMINE (comprising DOSPA and DOPE, available from GIBCO/BRL). PEG Lipids Suitable head groups for the PEG lipids include, but are not limited to those shown in Table 3 below. TABLE 3 Representative PEG lipids include, but are not limited to: wherein n is an integer from 10 to 100 (e.g. 20-50 or 40-50); s, s′, t and t′ are independently 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or 7; and m is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. Other representative PEG lipids include, but are not limited to: The Other Lipid Components The lipid particles and compositions described herein may also include one or more neutral lipids. Neutral lipids, when present, can be any of a number of lipid species which exist either in an uncharged or neutral zwitterionic form at physiological pH. Such lipids include, for example, diacylphosphatidylcholine, diacylphosphatidylethanolamine, ceramide, sphingomyelin, dihydrosphingomyelin, cephalin, and cerebrosides. In one embodiment, the neutral lipid component is a lipid having two acyl groups (e.g., diacylphosphatidylcholine and diacylphosphatidylethanolamine). In one embodiment, the neutral lipid contains saturated fatty acids with carbon chain lengths in the range of C10 to C20. In another embodiment, the neutral lipid includes mono or diunsaturated fatty acids with carbon chain lengths in the range of C10 to C20. Suitable neutral lipids include, but are not limited to, DSPC, DPPC, POPC, DOPE, DSPC, and SM. The lipid particles and compositions described herein may also include one or more lipids capable of reducing aggregation. Examples of lipids that reduce aggregation of particles during formation include polyethylene glycol (PEG)-modified lipids (PEG lipids, such as PEG-DMG and PEG-DMA), monosialoganglioside Gm1, and polyamide oligomers (“PAO”) such as (described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,320,017, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety). Suitable PEG lipids include, but are not limited to, PEG-modified phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidic acid, PEG-ceramide conjugates (e.g., PEG-CerC14 or PEG-CerC20) (such as those described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,820,873, incorporated herein by reference), PEG-modified dialkylamines and PEG-modified 1,2-diacyloxypropan-3-amines, PEG-modified diacylglycerols and dialkylglycerols, mPEG (mw2000)-diastearoylphosphatidylethanolamine (PEG-DSPE). The lipid particles and compositions may include a sterol, such as cholesterol. Lipid Particles In a further aspect, the present invent relates to lipid particles that include one or more of the cationic lipids described herein. In one embodiment, the lipid particle includes one or more compounds of formula I-VII. Lipid particles include, but are not limited to, liposomes. As used herein, a liposome is a structure having lipid-containing membranes enclosing an aqueous interior. Another embodiment is a nucleic acid-lipid particle (e.g., a SNALP) comprising a cationic lipid of the present invention, a non-cationic lipid (such as a neutral lipid), optionally a PEG-lipid conjugate (such as the lipids for reducing aggregation of lipid particles discussed herein), optionally a sterol (e.g., cholesterol), and a nucleic acid. As used herein, the term “SNALP” refers to a stable nucleic acid-lipid particle. A SNALP represents a particle made from lipids, wherein the nucleic acid (e.g., an interfering RNA) is encapsulated within the lipids. In certain instances, SNALPs are useful for systemic applications, as they can exhibit extended circulation lifetimes following intravenous (i.v.) injection, they can accumulate at distal sites (e.g., sites physically separated from the administration site), and they can mediate silencing of target gene expression at these distal sites. The nucleic acid may be complexed with a condensing agent and encapsulated within a SNALP as set forth in International Publication No. WO 00/03683, the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. For example, the lipid particle may include a cationic lipid, a fusion-promoting lipid (e.g., DPPC), a neutral lipid, cholesterol, and a PEG-modified lipid. In one embodiment, the lipid particle includes the above lipid mixture in molar ratios of about 20-70% cationic lipid: 0.1-50% fusion promoting lipid: 5-45% neutral lipid: 20-55% cholesterol: 0.5-15% PEG-modified lipid (based upon 100% total moles of lipid in the lipid particle). In another embodiment of the lipid particle, the cationic lipid is present in a mole percentage of about 20% and about 60%; the neutral lipid is present in a mole percentage of about 5% to about 25%; the sterol is present in a mole percentage of about 25% to about 55%; and the PEG lipid is PEG-DMA, PEG-DMG, or a combination thereof, and is present in a mole percentage of about 0.5% to about 15% (based upon 100% total moles of lipid in the lipid particle). In particular embodiments, the molar lipid ratio, with regard to mol % cationic lipid/DSPC/Chol/PEG-DMG or PEG-DMA) is approximately 40/10/40/10, 35/15/40/10 or 52/13/30/5. This mixture may be further combined with a fusion-promoting lipid in a molar ratio of 0.1-50%, 0.1-50%, 0.5-50%, 1-50%, 5%-45%, 10%-40%, or 15%-35%. In other words, when a 40/10/40/10 mixture of lipid/DSPC/Chol/PEG-DMG or PEG-DMA is combined with a fusion-promoting peptide in a molar ratio of 50%, the resulting lipid particles can have a total molar ratio of (mol % cationic lipid/DSPC/Chol/PEG-DMG or PEG-DMA/fusion-promoting peptide) 20/5/20/5/50. In another embodiment, the neutral lipid, DSPC, in these compositions is replaced with POPC, DPPC, DOPE or SM.

In another embodiment, the lipid particles or compositions contain the antioxidant EDTA (or a salt thereof), the antioxidant citrate (or a salt thereof), or EDTA (or a salt thereof) in combination with one or more (e.g., a mixture of) primary and/or secondary antioxidants such as α-tocopherol (or a salt thereof) and/or ascorbyl palmitate (or a salt thereof). In one embodiment, the antioxidant is present in an amount sufficient to prevent, inhibit, or reduce the degradation of the cationic lipid present in the lipid particle. For example, the antioxidant may be present at a concentration of at least about or about 0.1 mM, 0.5 mM, 1 mM, 10 mM, 100 mM, 500 mM, 1 M, 2 M, or 5M, or from about 0.1 mM to about 1 M, from about 0.1 mM to about 500 mM, from about 0.1 mM to about 250 mM, or from about 0.1 mM to about 100 mM. The lipid particles and compositions described herein can further include an apolipoprotein. As used herein, the term “apolipoprotein” or “lipoprotein” refers to apolipoproteins known to those of skill in the art and variants and fragments thereof and to apolipoprotein agonists, analogues or fragments thereof described below. In a preferred embodiment, the active agent is a nucleic acid, such as a siRNA. For example, the active agent can be a nucleic acid encoded with a product of interest, including but not limited to, RNA, antisense oligonucleotide, an antagomir, a DNA, a plasmid, a ribosomal RNA (rRNA), a micro RNA (miRNA) (e.g., a miRNA which is single stranded and 17-25 nucleotides in length), transfer RNA (tRNA), a small interfering RNA (siRNA), small nuclear RNA (snRNA), antigens, fragments thereof, proteins, peptides, vaccines and small molecules or mixtures thereof. In one more preferred embodiment, the nucleic acid is an oligonucleotide (e.g., 15-50 nucleotides in length (or 15-30 or 20-30 nucleotides in length)). An siRNA can have, for instance, a duplex region that is 16-30 nucleotides long. In another embodiment, the nucleic acid is an immunostimulatory oligonucleotide, decoy oligonucleotide, supermir, miRNA mimic, or miRNA inhibitor. A supermir refers to a single stranded, double stranded or partially double stranded oligomer or polymer of ribonucleic acid (RNA) or deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) or both or modifications thereof, which has a nucleotide sequence that is substantially identical to an miRNA and that is antisense with respect to its target. miRNA mimics represent a class of molecules that can be used to imitate the gene silencing ability of one or more miRNAs. Thus, the term “microRNA mimic” refers to synthetic non-coding RNAs (i.e. the miRNA is not obtained by purification from a source of the endogenous miRNA) that are capable of entering the RNAi pathway and regulating gene expression. The nucleic acid that is present in a lipid-nucleic acid particle can be in any form. The nucleic acid can, for example, be single-stranded DNA or RNA, or double-stranded DNA or RNA, or DNA-RNA hybrids. Non-limiting examples of double-stranded RNA include siRNA. Single-stranded nucleic acids include, e.g., antisense oligonucleotides, ribozymes, microRNA, and triplex-forming oligonucleotides. The lipid particles of the present invention can also deliver nucleic acids which are conjugated to one or more ligands. Pharmaceutical Compositions The lipid particles, particularly when associated with a therapeutic agent, may be formulated as a pharmaceutical composition, e.g., which further comprises a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent, excipient, or carrier, such as physiological saline or phosphate buffer. The resulting pharmaceutical preparations may be sterilized by conventional, well known sterilization techniques. The aqueous solutions can then be packaged for use or filtered under aseptic conditions and lyophilized, the lyophilized preparation being combined with a sterile aqueous solution prior to administration. The compositions may contain pharmaceutically acceptable auxiliary substances as required to approximate physiological conditions, such as pH adjusting and buffering agents, and tonicity adjusting agents, for example, sodium acetate, sodium lactate, sodium chloride, potassium chloride, and calcium chloride. Additionally, the lipidic suspension may include lipid-protective agents which protect lipids against free-radical and lipid-peroxidative damages on storage. Lipophilic free-radical quenchers, such as α-tocopherol and water-soluble iron-specific chelators, such as ferrioxamine, are suitable. The concentration of lipid particle or lipid-nucleic acid particle in the pharmaceutical formulations can vary, for example, from less than about 0.01%, to at or at least about 0.05-5% to as much as 10 to 30% by weight. Methods of Manufacture Methods of making cationic lipids, lipid particles containing them, and pharmaceutical compositions containing the cationic lipids and/or lipid particles are described in, for example, International Publication Nos. WO 2010/054406, WO 2010/054401, WO 2010/054405, WO 2010/054384, WO 2010/042877, WO 2010/129709, WO 2009/086558, and WO 2008/042973, and U.S. Patent Publication Nos. 2004/0142025, 2006/0051405 and 2007/0042031, each of which is incorporated by reference in its entirety. For example, in one embodiment, a solution of one or more lipids (including a cationic lipid of any of the embodiments described herein) in an organic solution (e.g., ethanol) is prepared. Similarly, a solution of one or more active (therapeutic) agents (such as, for example an siRNA molecule or a 1:1 molar mixture of two siRNA molecules) in an aqueous buffered (e.g., citrate buffer) solution is prepared. The two solutions are mixed and diluted to form a colloidal suspension of siRNA lipid particles. In one embodiment, the siRNA lipid particles have an average particle size of about 80-90 nm. In further embodiments, the dispersion may be filtered through 0.45/2 micron filters, concentrated and diafiltered by tangential flow filtration. DEFINITIONS As used herein, the term “cationic lipid” inlcudes those lipids having one or two fatty acid or fatty aliphatic chains and an amino acid containing head group that may be protonated to form a cationic lipid at physiological pH. In some embodiments, a cationic lipid is referred to as an “amino acid conjugate cationic lipid.” A subject or patient in whom administration of the complex is an effective therapeutic regimen for a disease or disorder is preferably a human, but can be any animal, including a laboratory animal in the context of a clinical trial or screening or activity experiment. Thus, as can be readily appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art, the methods, compounds and compositions of the present invention are particularly suited to administration to any animal, particularly a mammal, and including, but by no means limited to, humans, domestic animals, such as feline or canine subjects, farm animals, such as but not limited to bovine, equine, caprine, ovine, and porcine subjects, wild animals (whether in the wild or in a zoological garden), research animals, such as mice, rats, rabbits, goats, sheep, pigs, dogs, and cats, avian species, such as chickens, turkeys, and songbirds, i.e., for veterinary medical use. Many of the chemical groups recited in the generic formulas above are written in a particular order (for example, —OC(O)—). It is intended that the chemical group is to be incorporated into the generic formula in the order presented unless indicated otherwise. For example, a generic formula of the form —(R)i-(M1)k-(R)m— where M1 is —C(O)O— and k is 1 refers to —(R)i—C(O)O—(R)m— unless specified otherwise. It is to be understood that when a chemical group is written in a particular order, the reverse order is also contemplated unless otherwise specified. For example, in a generic formula —(R)i—(M1)k-(R)m— where M1 is defined as —C(O)NH— (i.e., —(R)i—C(O)—NH—(R)m—), the compound where M1 is —NHC(O)— (i.e., —(R)i—NHC(O)—(R)m—) is also contemplated unless otherwise specified. The term “biodegradable cationic lipid” refers to a cationic lipid having one or more biodegradable groups located in the mid- or distal section of a lipidic moiety (e.g., a hydrophobic chain) of the cationic lipid. The incorporation of the biodegradable group(s) into the cationic lipid results in faster metabolism and removal of the cationic lipid from the body following delivery of the active pharmaceutical ingredient to a target area. As used herein, the term “biodegradable group” refers to a group that include one or more bonds that may undergo bond breaking reactions in a biological environment, e.g., in an organism, organ, tissue, cell, or organelle. For example, the biodegradable group may be metabolizable by the body of a mammal, such as a human (e.g., by hydrolysis). Some groups that contain a biodegradable bond include, for example, but are not limited to esters, dithiols, and oximes. Non-limiting examples of biodegradable groups are —OC(O)—, —C(O)O—, —SC(O)—, —C(O)S—, —OC(S)—, —C(S)O—, —S—S—, —C(R5)═N—, —N═C(R5)—, —C(R5)═N—O—, —O—N═C(R5)—, —C(O)(NR5)—, —N(R5)C(O)—, —C(S)(NR5)—, —N(R5)C(O)—, —N(R5)C(O)N(R5)—, —OC(O)O—, —OSi(R5)2O—, —C(O)(CR3R4)C(O)O—, or —OC(O)(CR3R4)C(O)—.

For example, a spirocyclic group in an alkyl, alkenyl, or alkynyl group is not considered a point of branching. Unless otherwise specified, the term “acyl” refers to a carbonyl group substituted with hydrogen, alkyl, partially saturated or fully saturated cycloalkyl, partially saturated or fully saturated heterocycle, aryl, or heteroaryl. For example, acyl groups include groups such as (C1-C20)alkanoyl (e.g., formyl, acetyl, propionyl, butyryl, valeryl, caproyl, and t-butylacetyl), (C3-C20)cycloalkylcarbonyl (e.g., cyclopropylcarbonyl, cyclobutylcarbonyl, cyclopentylcarbonyl, and cyclohexylcarbonyl), heterocyclic carbonyl (e.g., pyrrolidinylcarbonyl, pyrrolid-2-one-5-carbonyl, piperidinylcarbonyl, piperazinylcarbonyl, and tetrahydrofuranylcarbonyl), aroyl (e.g., benzoyl) and heteroaroyl (e.g., thiophenyl-2-carbonyl, thiophenyl-3-carbonyl, furanyl-2-carbonyl, furanyl-3-carbonyl, 1H-pyrroyl-2-carbonyl, 1H-pyrroyl-3-carbonyl, and benzo[b]thiophenyl-2-carbonyl).

Example 35 Preparation of Lipid Nanoparticles The cationic lipids described herein are used to formulate liposomes containing the AD-1661 duplex (shown in the table below) using an in-line mixing method as described in International Publication No. WO 2010/088537, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety. The lipid nanoparticles had the formulation shown in the table below. Mole Percentage (Based on 100% of the lipid Component components in the LNP) Cationic lipid 50% Distearoylphosphatidylcholine (DSPC) 10% Cholesterol 38.5% 1-(monomethoxy-polyethyleneglycol)- 1.5% 2,3-dimyristoylglycerol (PEG-DMG) (with an average PEG molecular weight of 2000) siRNA (AD-1661) — The siRNA AD-1661 duplex has the sequence shown below. SEQ ID Duplex Sequence 5′-3′ NO: Target AD-1661 GGAfUfCAfUfCfUfCAAGfUfCf 1 FVII UfUAfCdTsdT GfUAAGAfCfUfUGAGAfUGAfUf 2 CfCdTsdT Lower case is 2′OMe modification and Nf is a 2′F modified nucleobase, dT is deoxythymidine, s is phosphothioate The lipid nanoparticles was prepared as follows. Cationic lipid, DSPC, cholesterol, and PEG-DMG in the ratio recited in the table above were solubilized in ethanol at a total lipid concentration of 25 mg/mL. A siRNA stock solution was prepared by solubilizing the siRNA AD-1661 in a low pH acetate or citrate buffer (pH=4) at 0.8 mg/mL. The stock solutions should be completely clear and the lipids should be completely solubilized before combining with the siRNA. Therefore, if it was determined appropriate, the stock solutions were heated to completely solubilize the lipids. The individual stock solutions were combined by pumping each solution to a T-junction (i.e., by in-line mixing). Specifically, the ethanol solution (at 5 ml/min, via 0.01 in. PEEK tube) and aqueous buffer solution (at 15 mL/min, via 0.02 in. PEEK tube) were mixed through a T-junction (PEEK Tee body, IDEX). After the T-junction a single tubing is placed where the combined stream will emit. Ethanol is removed and exchanged for PBS by dialysis. The lipid formulations are then concentrated using centrifugation or diafiltration to an appropriate working concentration. Lipid nanoparticles containing the cationic lipids listed in the table in Example 36 were prepared as described above. Example 36 Efficacy of Lipid Nanoparticles Factor VII (FVII), a prominent protein in the coagulation cascade, is synthesized in the liver (hepatocytes) and secreted into the plasma. FVII levels in plasma can be determined by a simple, plate-based colorimetric assay. As such, FVII represents a convenient model for determining siRNA-mediated downregulation of hepatocyte-derived proteins. Test formulations of the lipid nanoparticles prepared in Example 35 were initially assessed for their FVII knockdown in female 7-9 week old, 15-25 g, female C57Bl/6 mice at 0.1, 0.3, 1.0 and 5.0 mg/kg with 3 mice per treatment group. All studies included animals receiving either phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, control group) or a benchmark formulation. Formulations were diluted to the appropriate concentration in PBS immediately prior to testing. Mice were weighed and the appropriate dosing volumes calculated (10 μl/g body weight). Test and benchmark formulations as well as PBS (for control animals) were administered intravenously via the lateral tail vein. Animals were anesthetised 24 hours later with an intraperitoneal injection of ketamine/xylazine and 500-700 μl of blood was collected by cardiac puncture into serum separator tubes (BD Microtainer). Blood was centrifuged at 2,000×g for 10 minutes at 15° C. and serum was collected and stored at −70° C. until analysis. Serum samples were thawed at 37° C. for 30 minutes, diluted in PBS and aliquoted into 96-well assay plates. Factor VII levels were assessed using a chromogenic assay (Biophen FVII kit, Hyphen BioMed) according to the manufacturer's instructions and absorbance was measured in a microplate reader equipped with a 405 nm wavelength filter. Plasma FVII levels were quantified and ED50 values (dose resulting in a 50% reduction in plasma FVII levels compared to control animals) were calculated using a standard curve generated from a pooled sample of serum from control animals. Those formulations of interest showing high levels of FVII knockdown (ED50<<0.1 mg/kg) were re-tested in independent studies at a lower dose range to confirm potency and establish ED50 levels. The following table shows ED50 values for some of the cationic lipids described herein. Two asterisks (**) indicates an ED50 value between 0.001 and 0.10. One asterisk (*) indicates an ED50 value greater than 0.10. ED50 Cationic Lipid ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** * ** * ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** Example 37 Hydrophobicity and Stability The log P values for the biodegrabable cationic lipids listed in the table below were calculated using the software available at http://www.molinspiration.com/services/logp.html from Molinspiration Cheminformatics of Slovensky Grob, Slovak Republic. Furthermore, the HPLC retention time for each biodegradable cationic lipid was measured in lipid nanoparticles prepared from them. The lipid nanoparticles were prepared as described in Example 35 using AD-1661 as the payload. The retention times are reported in the table below relative to the retention time for cholesterol. The HPLC buffer used was a mixture of two solutions (Solution #1 and Solution #2). Solution #1: 80% methanol/20% 10 mM NH4HCO3 Solution #2: 80% methanol/20% isopropanol The ratios of the two solutions in the mixture changed over time as indicated in the table below. Time Solution #1 Solution #2 (min) (vol %) (vol %) 0 70 30 4 10 90 6 10 90 6.1 70 30 8 70 30 The size of the lipid nanoparticles was measured before and after undergoing dialysis overnight. In general, greater changes in lipid nanoparticle size are indicative of lesser stability. Dynamic laser light scattering was used to determine the lipid nanoparticle size (expressed as the intensity weighted diameter) with a Zetasizer (Malvern Instruments, Inc. of Westborough, Mass.). All measurements were made at 532 nm wavelength at the scattering angle of 173° using normal resolution mode as the analysis model.
