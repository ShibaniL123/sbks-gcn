The present invention relates to an electron transport material and an organic electroluminescent device comprising the same. An electroluminescent (EL) device is a self-light-emitting device with the advantages of providing a wider viewing angle, a greater contrast ratio, and a faster response time. The first organic EL device was developed by Eastman Kodak, by using small aromatic diamine molecules and aluminum complexes as materials for forming a light-emitting layer (see Appl. Phys. Lett. 51, 913, 1987). An organic EL device changes electric energy into light by the injection of a charge into an organic light-emitting material, and commonly comprises an anode, a cathode, and an organic layer formed between the two electrodes. The organic layer of the organic EL device may be composed of a hole injection layer (HIL), a hole transport layer (HTL), an electron blocking layer (EBL), a light-emitting layer (EML) (containing host and dopant materials), an electron buffer layer, a hole blocking layer (HBL), an electron transport layer (ETL), an electron injection layer (EIL), etc.; the materials used in the organic layer can be classified into a hole injection material, a hole transport material, an electron blocking material, a light-emitting material, an electron buffer material, a hole blocking material, an electron transport material, an electron injection material, etc., depending on functions. In the organic EL device, holes from an anode and electrons from a cathode are injected into a light-emitting layer by electric voltage, and an exciton having high energy is produced by the recombination of holes and electrons. The organic light-emitting compound moves into an excited state by the energy and emits light from energy when the organic light-emitting compound returns to the ground state from the excited state. The most important factor determining luminous efficiency in an organic EL device is light-emitting materials. The light-emitting materials are required to have the following features: high quantum efficiency, high movement degree of an electron and a hole, and formability of a uniform and stable layer. The light-emitting material is classified into blue light-emitting materials, green light-emitting materials, and red light-emitting materials according to the light-emitting color, and further includes yellow light-emitting materials or orange light-emitting materials. Furthermore, the light-emitting material is classified into a host material and a dopant material in a functional aspect. Recently, an urgent task is the development of an organic EL device having high efficacy and long operating lifespan. In particular, the development of highly excellent light-emitting material over conventional light-emitting materials is urgently required, considering the EL properties necessary for medium- and large-sized OLED panels. For this, preferably, as a solvent in a solid state and an energy transmitter, a host material should have high purity, and a suitable molecular weight in order to be deposited under vacuum. Furthermore, a host material is required to have high glass transition temperature and pyrolysis temperature for guaranteeing thermal stability, high electrochemical stability for long lifespan, easy formability of an amorphous thin film, good adhesion with adjacent layers, and no movement between layers. Meanwhile, in an organic EL device, an electron transport material actively transports electrons from a cathode to a light-emitting layer and inhibits transport of holes which are not recombined in the light-emitting layer to increase recombination opportunity of holes and electrons in the light-emitting layer. Thus, electron-affinitive materials are used as an electron transport material. Organic metal complexes having light-emitting function such as Alq3 are excellent in transporting electrons, and thus have been conventionally used as an electron transport material. However, Alq3 has problems in that it moves to other layers and shows reduction of color purity when used in blue light-emitting devices. Therefore, new electron transport materials have been required, which do not have the above problems, are highly electron-affinitive, and quickly transport electrons in organic EL devices to provide organic EL devices having high luminous efficiency. Korean Patent Nos. 10-0957288 and 10-0948700 disclose compounds in which a nitrogen-containing heterocyclic group is bonded to a carbazolyl group, and compounds in which a nitrogen-containing heterocyclic group is bonded to an arylcarbazolyl group or a carbazolylalkylene group, respectively. However, the above patents disclose the above compounds as materials used in a light-emitting layer, and merely recite conventional metal complex compounds, and oxazole, thiazole, oxadiazole, or thiadiazole derivatives as electron transport materials. The present inventors have found that an organic EL device comprising compounds having a carbazole-fluorene skeleton, wherein a nitrogen-containing heterocyclic group is bonded to a nitrogen atom of the carbazole, which were conventionally used in a light-emitting layer, as an electron transport material in an electron transport layer has high efficiency and improved lifespan.

An electron transport material can be comprised of the compound of formula 1 alone, or can be a mixture or composition for an electron transport layer which further comprises a conventional material generally included in electron transport materials. The present invention provides an organic EL device comprising an anode, a cathode, and at least one organic layer between the two electrodes, wherein the organic layer comprises a light-emitting layer which contains host and dopant compounds. A light-emitting layer emitting light may be a single layer or multi-layers having two or more layers.

In the organic EL device of the present invention, an organic layer may further comprise at least one metal selected from the group consisting of metals of Group 1, metals of Group 2, transition metals of the 4th period, transition metals of the 5th period, lanthanides, and organic metals of d-transition elements of the Periodic Table, or at least one complex compound comprising the metal. Preferably, in the organic EL device of the present invention, at least one layer (hereinafter, "a surface layer”) selected from a chalcogenide layer, a metal halide layer, and a metal oxide layer may be placed on an inner surface(s) of one or both electrode(s). Specifically, it is preferred that a chalcogenide (including oxides) layer of silicon or aluminum is placed on an anode surface of a light-emitting medium layer, and a metal halide layer or metal oxide layer is placed on a cathode surface of an electroluminescent medium layer. The surface layer provides operating stability for the organic EL device. Preferably, the chalcogenide includes SiOX(1≤X≤2), AlOX(1≤X≤1.5), SiON, SiAlON, etc.; the metal halide includes LiF, MgF2, CaF2, a rare earth metal fluoride, etc.; and the metal oxide includes Cs2O, Li2O, MgO, SrO, BaO, CaO, etc. A hole injection layer (HIL), a hole transport layer (HTL), an electron blocking layer (EBL), or their combinations can be used between an anode and a light-emitting layer. A hole injection layer may be multi-layers in order to lower a hole injection barrier (or hole injection voltage) from an anode to a hole transport layer or electron blocking layer, wherein each of the multi-layers simultaneously may use two compounds. A hole transport layer or an electron blocking layer may also be multi-layers. An electron buffer layer, a hole blocking layer (HBL), an electron transport layer (ETL), an electron injection layer (EIL), or their combinations can be used between a light-emitting layer and a cathode. An electron buffer layer may be multi-layers in order to control the injection of an electron and improve interface properties between a light-emitting layer and an electron injection layer, wherein each of the multi-layers simultaneously may use two compounds. A hole blocking layer or a electron transport layer may also be multi-layers, wherein each of the multi-layers may use a multi-component of compounds. Preferably, in the organic EL device of the present invention, a mixed region of an electron transport compound and a reductive dopant, or a mixed region of a hole transport compound and an oxidative dopant may be placed on at least one surface of a pair of electrodes. In this case, an electron transport compound is reduced to an anion, and thus it becomes easier to inject and transport electrons from the mixed region to a light-emitting medium. Furthermore, a hole transport compound is oxidized to a cation, and thus it becomes easier to inject and transport holes from the mixed region to a light-emitting medium. Preferably, an oxidative dopant includes various Lewis acids and acceptor compounds; and a reductive dopant includes alkali metals, alkali metal compounds, alkaline earth metals, rare-earth metals, and mixtures thereof. A reductive dopant layer may be employed as a charge-generating layer to prepare an organic EL device having two or more light-emitting layers and emitting white light. In order to form each layer constituting the organic EL device of the present invention, dry film-forming methods, such as vacuum deposition, sputtering, plasma, ion plating methods, etc., or wet film-forming methods, such as spin coating, dip coating, flow coating methods, etc., can be used. When using a wet film-forming method, a thin film is formed by dissolving or dispersing the material constituting each layer in suitable solvents, such as ethanol, chloroform, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, etc. The solvents are not specifically limited as long as the material constituting each layer is soluble or dispersible in the solvents, which do not cause any problems in forming a layer.

Next, the ITO substrate was mounted on a substrate holder of a vacuum vapor depositing apparatus. N4,N4’-diphenyl-N4,N4’-bis(9-phenyl-9H-carbazol-3-yl)-[1,1’-biphenyl]-4,4’-diamine was introduced into a cell of the vacuum vapor depositing apparatus, and the pressure in the chamber of the apparatus was then controlled to 10-6 torr. Thereafter, an electric current was applied to the cell to evaporate the introduced material, thereby forming a hole injection layer 1 having a thickness of 60 nm on the ITO substrate. 1,4,5,8,9,12-hexaazatriphenylene-hexacarbonitrile was then introduced into another cell of the vacuum vapor depositing apparatus, and an electric current was applied to the cell to evaporate the introduced material, thereby forming a hole injection layer 2 having a thickness of 5 nm on hole injection layer 1. N-([1,1’-biphenyl]-4-yl)-9,9-dimethyl-N-(4-(9-phenyl-9H-carbazol-3-yl)phenyl)-9H-fluorene-2-amine was introduced into one cell of the vacuum vapor depositing apparatus. Thereafter, an electric current was applied to the cell to evaporate the introduced material, thereby forming a hole transport layer 1 having a thickness of 20 nm on hole injection layer 2. N,N-di([1,1’-biphenyl]-4-yl)-4’-(9H-carbazol-9-yl)-[1,1’-biphenyl]-4-amine was then introduced into another cell of the vacuum vapor depositing apparatus, and an electric current was applied to the cell to evaporate the introduced material, thereby forming a hole transport layer 2 having a thickness of 5 nm on hole transport layer 1. Thereafter, BH-1 as a host compound was introduced into one cell of the vacuum vapor depositing apparatus and BD-1 as a dopant was introduced into another cell. The two materials were evaporated at a different rate and the dopant was deposited in a doping amount of 2 wt%, based on the total weight of the host and dopant, to form a light-emitting layer having a thickness of 20 nm on the hole transport layer. Next, compound ETL-132 was evaporated on one cell to form an electron transport layer having a thickness of 35 nm on the light-emitting layer. After depositing lithium quinolate having a thickness of 4 nm as an electron injection layer on the electron transport layer, an Al cathode having a thickness of 80 nm was then deposited by another vacuum vapor deposition apparatus on the electron injection layer. Thus, an OLED device was produced. All the materials used for producing the OLED device were purified by vacuum sublimation at 10-6 torr prior to use. Device Example 2: Production of an OLED device by using an organic compound for an electron transport material according to the present invention An OLED device was produced in the same manner as in Device Example 1, except that compound ETL-57 was used in an electron transport layer. Device Example 3: Production of an OLED device by using an organic compound for an electron transport material according to the present invention An OLED device was produced in the same manner as in Device Example 1, except that compound ETL-50 was used in an electron transport layer. Device Example 4: Production of an OLED device by using an organic compound for an electron transport material according to the present invention An OLED device was produced in the same manner as in Device Example 1, except that compound ETL-137 was used in an electron transport layer. Comparative Example 1: Production of an OLED device by using a conventional organic compound for an electron transport material An OLED device was produced in the same manner as in Device Example 1, except that the following comparative compound was used in an electron transport layer. The current efficiency vs. luminance values of the OLED devices produced above are shown in a graph in Fig. 2. Furthermore, driving voltage at a luminance of 1,000 nit, luminous efficiency, and CIE color coordinate of the OLED devices produced in Device Examples 1 to 4 and Comparative Example 1 are provided in Table 1 below. The above data were determined under the condition that electron affinity of an electron transport layer (Ab) is higher than electron affinity of a host (Ah, LUMO=1.6 eV), and electron transport layers of Device Examples according to the present invention have higher electron affinity than that of Comparative Example 1. LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) energy value and HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital) energy value have inherently negative number, but LUMO energy value (A) and HOMO energy value in the present invention are conveniently expressed in their absolute values. Furthermore, the comparison between LUMO energy values is based on their absolute values. LUMO energy value and HOMO energy value in the present invention are calculated by Density Functional Theory. As depicted in Fig. 3, the devices according to the present invention have a big barrier between a light-emitting layer and an electron transport layer in the process of transporting electrons compared with the device of Comparative Example 1 (see LUMO energy value). However, the devices of the present invention have fast electron current property, and thus have lower driving voltage and higher efficiency than the device of Comparative Example 1. Furthermore, the compound of the present invention has higher HOMO energy value than the comparative compound of Comparative Example 1, and thus restricts efficiently movement of excitons produced in a light-emitting layer and hole carriers as shown in Fig. 3. According to this, the compound of the present invention is regarded as showing color coordinate having the nearest to pure blue compared with the comparative compound of Comparative Example 1. Comparison of electron current property of the comparative compound of Comparative Example 1 and the compound of present invention In order to demonstrate fast electron current property of an electron transport layer in the devices according to the present invention, voltage property was compared by preparing an Electron Only Device (EOD). The device was produced as follows: Barium, 2,9-dimethyl-4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline (BCP) were introduced into cells in a vacuum vapor depositing apparatus. Thereafter, an electric current was applied to the cells to evaporate the introduced materials, thereby forming a hole blocking layer (HBL) having a thickness of 10 nm on the ITO substrate. Thereafter, BH-1 as a host compound was introduced into one cell of the vacuum vapor depositing apparatus and BD-1 as a dopant was introduced into another cell. The two materials were evaporated at a different rate and the dopant was deposited in a doping amount of 2 wt%, based on the total weight of the host and dopant, to form a light-emitting layer having a thickness of 20 nm on a hole transport layer. Next, the compounds in the table below were evaporated to form an electron transport layer having a thickness of 33 nm on the light-emitting layer. After depositing lithium quinolate having a thickness of 4 nm as an electron injection layer on the electron transport layer, an Al cathode having a thickness of 80 nm was then deposited by another vacuum vapor deposition apparatus on the electron injection layer. Thus, an OLED device was produced. All the materials used for producing the OLED device were purified by vacuum sublimation at 10-6 torr prior to use. Voltages at 10 and 50 mA/cm2 according to each material of an electron transport layer are provided in Table 2 below. As shown in Table 2 above, the compounds of the present invention have faster electron current property at both voltages (10 and 50 mA/cm2) than the comparative compound of Comparative Example 1.
