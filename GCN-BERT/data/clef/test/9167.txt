Example 7. Preparation of SM-7: 2,2'-(hexane-1,6-diylbis(azanediyl)bis(1,1-difluoro-2-oxoethane-1-sulfonyl fluoride)
A 100 mL flask was charged with CH2Cl2 (10 mL) under nitrogen stream at 0° C. and then 2-(fluorosulfonyl)difluoroacetyl fluoride (5.82 g, 32.3 mmol, 2.5 eq.) was added and the mixture was stirred for 10 minutes at 0° C. A CH2Cl2 (15 mL) solution of hexamethylenediamine (1.50 g, 12.9 mmol, 1.0 eq.) and Pyridine (2.04 g, 25.8 mmol, 2.0 eq.) was added drop-wise to the mixture over 10 minutes and the mixture was allowed to warm to RT and stirred for an hour at RT. Et2O (100 mL) and 1N HCl (20 mL) were added to the final reaction mixture and then the upper layer was separated and washed with 1N HCl (20 mL) and brine (2×20 mL). The solution was dried over anhydrous MgSO4 and filtrated and then solvents were removed in an evaporator. The crude material was purified by recrystallization (3× hexane/Et2O). The target compound as white solid (3.88 g) in 68.9% yield was obtained.
