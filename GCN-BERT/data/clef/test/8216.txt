LUBRICANT COMPOSITION FIELD OF THE INVENTION The invention relates to a lubricant composition, and particularly to a lubricant composition comprising glycerol, water and carboxymethyl cellulose. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Document WO 01 /98441 discloses a conveyor lubricant composition comprising water, glycerol and carboxymethyl cellulose. Carboxymethyl cellulose may be used in a lubricant as thickener and tackiefier. A problem with the known lubricant comprising carboxymethyl cellulose is that the viscosity of carboxymethyl cellulose drops when the lubricant is in contact with iron, calcium, aluminum and/or oxygen. Lubricant is often stored in a stainless steel container or in some other container where it is in contact with air, which reduces the storage time of the lubricant significantly. When the viscosity drops, the thickening and tackifying effect of carboxymethyl cellulose is lost. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION An object of the present invention is to provide a lubricant composition so as to overcome the above problem. The objects of the invention are achieved by a lubricant composition and use thereof which are characterized by what is stated in the independent claims. The preferred embodiments of the invention are disclosed in the dependent claims. The invention is based on the idea of providing a lubricant composition comprising glycerol, water and carboxymethyl cellulose, wherein the composition further comprises sodium polyphosphate. An advantage of the lubricant composition of the invention is that sodium poly- phosphate surprisingly inhibits the reduction of the viscosity of the composition when the lubricant composition is in contact with iron, calcium, aluminum and/or oxygen. An advantage of the lubricant composition of the invention is also that sodium polyphosphate surprisingly lowers the pour point of the lubricant composition, which allows using the lubricant composition in lower temperatures. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The invention relates to a lubricant composition comprising glycerol, water and carboxymethyl cellulose, wherein the composition further comprises sodium polyphosphate. In the lubricant composition, the purpose of the carboxymethyl cellulose is to increase the viscosity of the lubricant and the adhesion of the lubricant to the surface to be lubricated. In addition to inhibiting the reduction of the viscosity when the lubricant composition is in contact with iron, calcium, aluminum and/or oxygen, sodium poly- phosphate also acts as a corrosion preventer. Theoretical pour point for a mixture of 66.7 % by weight of glycerol and 33.3 % by weight of water is -46.5 째 C. Using sodium polyphosphate also lowers the pour point. According to an embodiment the composition further comprises sodium benzo- ate for inhibiting activity of microorganisms. Preferably the composition comprises sodium benzoate between 0.1 to 0.3 % by weight of the composition. According to an embodiment the composition comprises sodium polyphosphate at least 0.2 % by weight of the composition, preferably between 0.2 to 1 .2 % by weight of the composition, more preferably between 0.4 to 1 % by weight of the composition. The composition comprises carboxymethyl cellulose between 0.1 to 0.7 % by weight of the composition, preferably between 0.1 to 0.6 % by weight of the composition. According to an embodiment the composition comprises glycerol 55 to 90 % by weight of the composition. According to an embodiment the composition comprises glycerol 55 to 90 % by weight of the composition, water 8.5 to 44 % by weight of the composition, and sodium polyphosphate at least 0.2 % by weight of the composition. The invention also relates to use of the lubricant composition of the invention as chain oil, transport chain lubricant, cutting fluid or lubricant for a test driving track. For example the lubricant composition is used as chain oil in a saw chain of stone saw, concrete saw, wood saw, or metal saw. The lubricant composition can also be used as chain oil in a handheld chain saw, or in a chain saw of forestry equipment or a forest harvester. The lubricant composition can also be used for lubricating transport chain in machine industry, construction industry, wood processing industry, paper indus- try, food industry, steel industry, car industry, agricultural industry, or in the production of isolation materials. When the lubricant composition is used as chain oil, preferably the composition comprises glycerol 55 to 75 % by weight of the composition, water 23 to 44 % by weight of the composition, and sodium polyphosphate 0.2 to 1 .2 % by weight of the composition. When the lubricant composition is used as transport chain lubricant, preferably the composition comprises glycerol 60 to 68 % by weight of the composition, water 31 to 39.5 % by weight of the composition, carboxymethyl cellulose 0.25 to 0.5 % by weight of the composition, and sodium polyphosphate 0.3 to 0.5 % by weight of the composition. When the lubricant composition is used as cutting fluid, preferably the composition comprises glycerol 60 to 90 % by weight of the composition, water 8.4 to 39.1 % by weight of the composition, carboxymethyl cellulose 0.1 to 0.6 % by weight of the composition, and sodium polyphosphate 0.3 to 1 % by weight of the composition. When the lubricant composition is used as cutting fluid for drilling or threading, preferably the composition comprises glycerol 60 to 65 % by weight of the composition, water 33.5 to 39.1 % by weight of the composition, carboxymethyl cellulose 0.32 to 0.6 % by weight of the composition, and sodium polyphosphate 0.3 to 0.5 % by weight of the composition. When the lubricant composition is used as lubricant for a test driving track, preferably the composition comprises glycerol 60 to 70 % by weight of the composition, water 29 to 39 % by weight of the composition, carboxymethyl cellulose 0.3 to 0.7 % by weight of the composition, and sodium polyphosphate 0.3 to 0.5 % by weight of the composition. EXAMPLE 1 A lubricant composition for use as chain oil comprising glycerol 66.7 % by weight of the composition, water 32.35 % by weight of the composition, carboxymethyl cellulose 0.35 % by weight of the composition and sodium polyphosphate 0.4 % by weight of the composition was made. Pour point of the composition was measured according to ASTM D5950 as being -51 째 C. Kinematic viscosity of the composition at 20 째 C was measured ac- cording to ISO 3104 as being 738.1 mm2/s. Kinematic viscosity of the composition at 80 째C was measured according to ISO 3104 asbeing 45 mm2/s. EXAMPLE 2 Two lubricant compositions were made. Composition 1 comprised glycerol 66.7 % by weight of the composition, water 32.35 % by weight of the composition, carboxymethyl cellulose 0.35 % by weight of the composition, sodium polyphosphate 0.4 % by weight of the composition and sodium benzoate 0.2 % by weight of the composition. Composition 2 comprised glycerol 67.0 % by weight of the composition, water 32.48 % by weight of the composition, carboxymethyl cellulose 0.35 % by weight of the composition and sodium benzoate 0.2 % by weight of the composition. The lubricant compositions were held in an open laboratory beaker. The viscosity of the compositions were measured after half an hour, two and half hours, 24 hours and 32 hours using Fungilab Alpha H viscometer and spindle L1 . The measured viscosities are shown in Table 1 . Table 1 The results show that the viscosity change over time of Composition 1 stabilizes, whereas the viscosity of Composition 2 keeps decreasing.
