Description Chair with balancing mechanism Technical Field [0001] This technical solution relates to a chair which is equipped with balancing mechanism located between a seat and a chair leg. Background Art [0002] Nowadays there are known various technical solutions which solve the one-side spinal load and hip bone load issue when sitting, especially longtime sitting, on chairs which have been equipped with balancing mechanism between the seat and the chair leg. [0003] Document SK 5675 Y1 describes a chair with stabilizing seating mechanism. This chair is equipped with adjustment unit which is on one side assembled to the chair chassis while it is dismountable from the chair, and on the other side it is assembled to the beam of stable back support. The beam is installed with rotating hinge unit which is from the other side placed in a socket. This socket is fixed to unstable base or unstable seat. [0004] This technical solution has a disadvantage that it is not possible to regulate the balance and instability of the seat. While seating down or standing up of the chair; the seat is quite unstable resulting in user comfort level decrease. Users having health issues are exposed to the risk of accident or injury. Although with this solution it is possible to lock the seat; usage of seat locking mechanism decreases the user's comfort because it is necessary to repeat the locking operation every time when seating down or standing up off the chair. [0005] Further disadvantage of this solution is its construction complexity which has a negative impact to manufacturing costs. [0006] Another document, SI 20508 A describes active orthopedic chair whose construction enables seat flexibility in all directions. This arangement imitates sitting on ball style, and it is able to substitute conventional office chairs. The seat of this active orthopedic chair is connected to the chair chassis via a flexible device which enables full seat flexibility in all directions. This device which secures movement flexibility is usually a wound spring, spring device or sliding mechanism. [0007] Disadvantage of this solution is as well the fact that it is not possible to anyhow regulate or eliminate balance and instability of the seat. When sitting down or standing up off the chair; the seat is permanently loose and unstable causing dangerous risks for users with good medical condition as well as for those users suffering from serious medical issues; for whom this type of chair is primary designed. Disclosure of Invention [0008] Object of this technical solution is to fully eliminate or greatly reduce limitations of current technical state which consist in inability to regulate balance and instability of the seat especially when sitting down or standing up off the seat. Moreover, along with limitation of mentioned disadvantages, this solution aims to minimize manufacturing costs, i.e. to simplify construction of the chair. [0009] Mentioned objects can be achieved by a chair with balancing mechanism according to this technical solution, where the balancing mechanism is composed of flexible device located between the seat and the chair leg, where the basis of this technical solution is that the flexible device is progressive wound spring and stabilizing mechanism is arranged on the outside of or around the flexible device between the seat and the chair leg. [0010] The most advantageous embodiment of the stabilizing mechanism in regard of construction simplicity and manufacturing costs is the wound spring. [0011] It is also advantageous if the wound spring has conical shape because its narrow end will perfectly fit to usually narrow end of the chair leg and wider end of the spring is then peripherally leaned against the seat in sufficient distance from balancer rod, what helps to stabilize the seat even better. [0012] Mentioned objects can also be achieved with a chair with balancing mechanism according to this technical solution where balancing mechanism between the seat and chair leg comprises fixed balancer rod, to which a stabilizing mechanism is composed of flexible device located between the seat and chair leg characterized in that the flexible device consists of at least three pistons chosen from the group comprising hydraulic, pneumatic, or spring pistons or their combinations. [0013] Chair with the balancing mechanism according to this technical solution provides an advantage of having the seat always moved to centered position; practically same as any other standard fixed chair, even during sitting down or standing up off the chair when an entire weight of a user is not affecting the seat. This greatly eliminates undesired tilting or change of position of the seat when sitting down or standing up off the chair which makes the user more confident when using the chair. Brief Description of Drawings [0014] Technical solution is for better understanding depicted in the attached drawings where: [0015] Figure 1 shows full front view of the chair according to this technical solution with balancing mechanism composed of flexible device located between the seat and chair leg, where flexible device is a progressive wound spring and conical spring of stabilizing mechanism is arranged around the progressive wound spring. [0016] Figure 2 shows detail of balancing mechanism and stabilizing mechanism from the figure 1 in released position, while the stabilizing spring is partially not shown for unobstructed view in the area of the spring of the flexible device. [0017] Figure 3 shows view of balancing and stabilizing mechanism from the figure 1 , in loaded position, while the figure is showing the stabilizing spring only partially for better transparent view. [0018] Figure 4 shows full side view of the chair from the figure 1. [0019] Figure 5 shows full front view of the chair according to this technical solution with balancing mechanism located between the seat and chair leg, with fixed balancer rod, to which the stabilizing mechanism consisting of pistons is fitted. [0020] Figure 6 shows detail of balancing mechanism and stabilizing mechanism from the figure 5. Mode(s) for Carrying Out the Invention [0021] Chair with balancing mechanism according to figures 1 to 3 is composed of a leg in this case chassis 1_, upon which height adjustment device 2 with regulation 3 is attached in dismountable manner. The support 4 is placed on the height adjustment device 2. [0022] In this case, support 4 carries chair backrest 6 of the chair; armrests 7, and balancing mechanism 9 with flexible balancer rod consisting of flexible device, in this case in the form of progressive wound spring. [0023] On the outside of balancing mechanism 9 the stabilizing mechanism 10 is arranged. The stabilizing mechanism ^0 comprises the flexible device, which is in this case composed of wound spring, which is arranged around the spring forming the flexible balancer rod of balancing mechanism 9. The seat 8 is placed on the balancing mechanism 9 and stabilizing mechanism ^0 . [0024] In this case, the spring of the stabilizing mechanism 10 is conical spring, which widens in direction from the support 4 to the seat 8. [0025] The seat is stabilized during sitting down on the chair with the stabilizing mechanism 10. Arrangement of the stabilizing mechanism 10 reduces instability of the seat 8. After settling down on the seat and loading the seat, the balancing mechanism 9 composed of progressive wound spring, is pressed down, stiffness of spring of the balancing mechanism 9 is increased and balancing rod is thus created. Seat 8 becomes loose and enables movement in all directions, thus imitating sitting on a fitness ball, strengthens back muscles, eliminates muscle misbalance, and prevents incorrect body position. [0026] Then during standing off the chair, stiffness of the progressive spring is decreasing while spring of the stabilizing mechanism is actuating, thus bringing the seat into stabilized position. [0027] It is possible to manufacture the balancing mechanism 9 and stabilizing mechanism 10 in various load combinations, what makes the chair possible to adapt to customer needs, or eventually to doctor's recommendations. [0028] Chair with balancing mechanism according to figures 5 and 6 has basically the same construction as the chair from previous example of embodiment, except that the balancing mechanism 9 comprises fixed balancer rod. Fixed balancer rod protrudes from the support 4 or can be a continuation of the height adjustment device 2. Upon this fixed balancer rod of the balancing mechanism 9 the seat 8 is placed. Balancing arrangement of the seat 8 on fixed balancer rod is known and it is possible to produce it in any know manner. In this case, the stabilizing mechanism comprises flexible device composed of at least three pistons L Pistons V_ are at one end attached to the seat 8 and at the other end to the leg of the chair, in this case to the height adjustment device 2. [0029] Using pistons 1_1 of different length, stiffness, and rate of piston resistance; it is possible to adjust chair characteristics according to customer needs. It is possible to achieve fluent movement in all sides directions in initial phases of tilting, what provides for increase in safety. In case, when pistons with adjustable characteristics are used, it is then possible to adjust characteristics of the balancing mechanism 9 according to customer needs or doctor's recommendations.
