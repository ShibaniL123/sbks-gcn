TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to pharmaceuticals comprising as an active ingredient a hydantoin derivative that has high metabolic stability and exhibits a potent PTH-like effect. BACKGROUND ART Parathyroid hormone (PTH) binds to the PTH1 receptor (PTH1R), which is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), to activate the G protein, and then causes activation of at least one signaling cascade such as the cyclic AMP (cAMP)/protein kinase A cascade. PTH is known as a hormone that acts on target cells in the kidney and bone to regulate calcium (Ca) and phosphorus (Pi) homeostasis (Non-Patent Document 1). Serum Ca concentration level is maintained by PTH mainly through direct or indirect actions on the gastrointestinal tract, bone, and kidney. PTH promotes resorption of Ca from the renal tubules and thereby suppresses excretion of Ca in the body to the outside. It also increases the synthesis of an enzyme that converts vitamin D to active vitamin D in the kidney, and thereby contributes to the facilitation of active vitamin D-mediated Ca absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. Furthermore, PTH enhances the differentiation of osteoclasts indirectly via osteoblasts and promote Ca release from the bone. These actions of PTH are thought to occur mainly via the cyclic adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate (cAMP) elevation and/or phospholipase C (PLC) activation that occurs when PTH binds to the PTH1R. In humans, PTH preparations [PTH (1-34) and PTH (1-84)] have a powerful osteogenic effect, and induce significant increases in bone mineral density (BMD) and bone strength. Currently, most of the osteoporosis drugs available for humans are inhibitors of bone resorption, and the only type of osteogenic drug that actively increases BMD is PTH preparations. PTH preparation is regarded as one of the most effective treatments for osteoporosis (Non-Patent Document 2); however, since it is a peptide, it needs to be administered by an invasive method. Therefore, there is an expectation for production of a pharmaceutical agent that has PTH-like effects and which can be administered non-invasively. Hypoparathyroidism is a metabolic disease that exhibits hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia caused by insufficiency of PTH secreted from the parathyroid gland, and a variety of associated symptoms. Active vitamin D preparations and Ca agents are being used for the treatment of hypoparathyroidism; however, since the PTH-mediated regulatory mechanism does not work, a sufficient therapeutic effect is not obtained. Furthermore, since active vitamin D formulations enhance urinary Ca excretion, long-term therapy suggests an increased risk of nephropathy. In order to solve these problems, there is an ongoing investigation of replacement therapy that uses PTH preparations against this disease; and an attempt was made to carry out several invasive administrations per day or a continuous administration using a pump to obtain sufficient efficacy (Non-Patent Document 3). Therefore, for hypoparathyroidism treatment, generation of a pharmaceutical agent that has PTH-like effects and which can also be administered non-invasively is desirable. Also, a pharmaceutical agent having PTH-like effects that can also be administered non-invasively is desired for treatment of diseases such as fracture, adynamic bone disease, achondroplasia, hypochondroplasia, osteomalacia, osteoarthritis, arthritis, thrombocytopenia, hyperphosphatemia, and tumoral calcinosis. Under such circumstances, the present inventors submitted a patent application in advance based on their discovery that the compound represented by formula (A): [Patent Document 1 may be referred to for W, X, Y, m, n, R1, R2, R33, and R34 in the formula] and pharmacologically acceptable salts thereof are useful as compounds having PTH-like effects, or more preferably, as a PTH1R agonist, and are useful for prevention and/or treatment of osteoporosis, fracture, osteomalacia, arthritis, thrombocytopenia, hypoparathyroidism, hyperphosphatemia, or tumoral calcinosis, or stem cell mobilization (Patent Document 1). To produce pharmaceutical agents that have high clinical value and can be administered invasively, it is necessary to consider the in vivo kinetics such as absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of the drug in addition to its direct actions on the target. To enable oral administration in particular, it is desirable to have a pharmaceutical agent having PTH-like effects which are high metabolic stability against human liver microsomes and strong human PTH1R-mediated ability of producing cAMP. To provide a pharmaceutical agent that can be administered orally to humans, generally a method of confirming the effects of oral administration by in vivo testing that involves use of a model animal. For example, a thyroparathyroidectomized (TPTX) rat is known as an animal model for hypoparathyroidism. To find a therapeutic agent that has strong PTH-like effects and high metabolic stability, and works against hypoparathyroidism when administered orally, it is effective to use a method of finding a compound that acts on rat PTH1R and is stable to the rat's metabolic enzymes, and then examining its actions when orally administered to a TPTX rat model. In current therapy for hypoparathyroidism, the therapeutic target range for serum Ca concentration is set to a slightly lower range than the lower limit of the normal range at 7.6 to 8.8 mg/dL (Non-Patent Document 4). Since the normal range for rat serum Ca concentration is the same level as for humans at 10 mg/dL or so, to verify the therapeutic effect, it is important to attain a serum Ca concentration in the rat model of the disease within the range from the therapeutic target range in humans (7.6-8.8 mg/dL) to the lower limit for hypercalcemia in humans (approximately 11.2 mg/dL).

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIG. 1 depicts a graph showing the average change of level in serum Ca concentration for each compound up to 24 hours after administration, when the compound is orally administered at a dose of 30 mg/kg to a TPTX rat model. MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION The present invention relates to hydantoin derivatives and use thereof. The present inventors have synthesized a compound represented by the above formula (1) or a pharmacologically acceptable salt thereof for the first time and have found that the compound or a salt thereof is a compound having a strong parathyroid hormone (PTH)-like effect and high metabolic stability. The “alkyl” herein refers to a monovalent group derived by removing any one hydrogen atom from an aliphatic hydrocarbon, and covers a subset of hydrocarbyl or hydrocarbon group structures not containing a heteroatom or an unsaturated carbon-carbon bond and containing hydrogen and carbon atoms in the backbone. Examples of the alkyl group include those of linear or branched structures. The alkyl group is preferably an alkyl group comprising one or two carbon atoms. The alkyl group is specifically, for example, a methyl group or an ethyl group, and is preferably a methyl group. The term “alkoxy” as used herein refers to an oxy group to which the above-defined “alkyl” is bound, and preferably refers to an alkoxy group comprising one or two carbon atoms. Specific examples include methoxy and ethoxy groups, and a preferred example is methoxy group. The “B optionally substituted with A” herein denotes that any hydrogen atom(s) in B may be substituted with any number of As. In the present invention, the number of substituents is not limited unless otherwise indicated. For example, the number of substituents may be 1 to 5, 1 to 4, 1 to 3, 1 to 2, or 1. The “halogen atom” herein refers to a fluorine atom, a chlorine atom, a bromine atom or an iodine atom. Herein, the symbol “*” in the chemical formula refers to the position of bonding. Compounds of the present invention represented by formula (1) has strong PTH-like effects and high metabolic stability. The “PTH-like effect” herein refers to activity of generating intracellular cAMP (cAMP: cyclic adenosine monophosphate) by action on the PTH receptor or action on the signal transduction pathway through the PTH receptor. In the present invention, whether there is a “strong PTH-like effect” or whether “a PTH-like effect is strong” can be confirmed by measuring the cAMP signaling activity by analyzing cAMP signaling, for example, according to the method described in J. Bone. Miner. Res. 14:11-20, 1999. Specifically, for example, according to the method described in Test Example 1, the amount of cAMP produced in cells forced to express human PTH1R is determined using a commercially available cAMP EIA kit (for example, Biotrack cAMP EIA system, GE health care) to measure the concentration of each compound at 20% cAMP signaling activity (EC20) or their concentration at 50% cAMP signaling activity (EC50), with the cAMP signaling activity obtained upon administration of 100 nM of human PTH (1-34) being defined as 100%. In the present invention, for a “strong PTH-like effect” or “a PTH-like effect is strong”, for example, the EC20 value (μM) measured by the above-mentioned method is preferably 5.0 or less, more preferably 3.0 or less, and even more preferably 2.0 or less. For EC50, the value (μM) measured by the above-mentioned method is, for example, preferably 25.0 or less, more preferably 15.0 or less, and even more preferably 10.0 or less. Whether there is “high metabolic stability” or whether the “metabolic stability is high” can be confirmed using a general measurement method. For example, liver cells, small intestinal cells, liver microsomes, small intestinal microsomes, liver S9, and such may be used for the confirmation. Specifically, for example, the stability of a compound in liver microsomes can be confirmed by taking measurements according to description in T. Kronbach et al. (Oxidation of midazolam and triazolam by human liver cytochrome P450IIIA4. Mol. Pharmacol, 1989, 36(1), 89-96). More specifically, the stability can be confirmed by following the method described in Test Example 3. In the present invention, “high metabolic stability” or “metabolic stability is high” are when the clearance (μL/min/mg) value in the metabolic stability test using human liver microsomes described in the above-mentioned Test Example is preferably 60 or less, more preferably 40 or less, and even more preferably 35 or less. Specifically, high metabolic stability can be obtained in the aforementioned formula (1), except where the combination of R1 and R2 is a trifluoromethyl group and a hydrogen atom, and R3 and R4, together with a bound carbon atom, form a cyclopentyl ring. The compounds according to the present invention, whether free forms or pharmacologically acceptable salts, are included in the present invention. Examples of such “salts” include inorganic acid salts, organic acid salts, inorganic base salts, organic base salts and acidic or basic amino acid salts. Preferred examples of the inorganic acid salts include hydrochlorides, hydrobromides, sulfates, nitrates and phosphates. Preferred examples of the organic acid salts include acetates, succinates, fumarates, maleates, tartrates, citrates, lactates, stearates, benzoates, methanesulfonates, benzenesulfonates, and p-toluenesulfonates.

Preferred examples of the organic base salts include diethylamine salts, diethanolamine salts, meglumine salts and N,N-dibenzylethylenediamine salts. Preferred examples of the acidic amino acid salts include aspartates and glutamates. Preferred examples of the basic amino acid salts include arginine salts, lysine salts and ornithine salts. The compounds of the present invention may absorb moisture, have adsorbed water or form hydrates when left in the air. Such hydrates are also included in the salts of the present invention. Further, the compounds of the present invention may absorb certain other solvents to form solvates. Such salts are also encompassed in the present invention as salts of the compounds of the formula (1). Herein, a structural formula of a compound may represent a certain isomer for the sake of convenience. However, the compounds of the present invention include all isomers such as geometric isomers, optical isomers based on asymmetric carbons, stereoisomers and tautomers as well as mixtures of these isomers which occur due to the structures of the compounds, without being limited to the formulas described for the sake of convenience, and may be either one of isomers or a mixture thereof. Thus, the compounds of the present invention may have an asymmetric carbon atom in the molecule and may be present as optically active forms and racemates, but the present invention is not limited to either of them and includes both of them. The present invention includes all isotopes of the compounds represented by the formula (1).

In particular, radioisotopes that decay by emitting radioactivity such as 3H and 14C are useful in body tissue distribution tests for pharmaceuticals or compounds. Stable isotopes do not decay, are almost equal in abundance and do not emit radioactivity, and thus they can be used safely. The isotopes of the compounds of the present invention can be converted according to conventional methods by substituting a reagent containing a corresponding isotope for a reagent used for synthesis.

A synthetic method for the hydantoin-arylbromide derivative (8) is shown in Scheme 5. Step 11 is Strecker synthesis which directs the ketone derivative (15) to become an arylamino-nitrile derivative (16).

(Osaka, Japan), dissolved in 10 mM acetic acid to 1 mM and stored in a −80° C. freezer. (Cell Culture) Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), 100 units/ml penicillin G and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate (Invitrogen Corp) at 37° C. in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. cAMP signal transduction analysis utilized LLC-PK1 cells not expressing the PTH1R, and HKRK-B7 cells, that is, LLC-PK1 cells overexpressing the human PTH1R at 9.5×105 receptors/cell (Takasu et al., J. Bone. Miner. Res. 14:11-20, 1999). (cAMP Stimulation) HKRK-B7 or LLC-PK1 cells were seeded into a 96-well plate at 1×105 cells/well and incubated overnight. On the following day, 50 μl of cAMP assay buffer (DMEM, 2 mM IBMX, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 35 mM Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.4) containing human PTH(1-34) or each compound was added and the plate was placed in a 37° C. incubator. The cells were incubated for 20 minutes. After removing the medium, the cells were washed with 100 μl of cAMP assay buffer once. The plate was placed on dry ice powder to freeze the cells and then removed from the dry ice. The cells were lysed with 40 μl of 50 mM HCl and frozen again on dry ice. The amount of intracellular cAMP produced was measured using a commercially available cAMP EIA kit (Biotrack cAMP EIA system, GE health care). (Calculation of 20% Effective Concentration (EC20) and 50% Effective Concentration (EC50) in the Measurement of In Vitro cAMP-Inducing Ability) Analyses were performed using a variable gradient S-shaped dose-response curve equation. The cAMP signaling activity of human PTH(1-34) at 100 nM was defined as 100%, and the concentration at which each compound shows 20% or 50% cAMP signaling activity was calculated as EC20 or EC50. The results obtained with HKRK-B7 cells are shown in Table 3. The degree of cAMP response in LLC-PK1 cells was lower than the degree in HKRK-B7 cells.

The rats were given tap water and were fed ad libitum with standard rodent chow (CE-2) (CLEA Japan, Inc.) containing 1.1% calcium, 1.0% phosphoric acid, and 250 IU/100 g of vitamin D3. TPTX was performed on five-week old rats. Some of the individuals were subjected to sham operation (Sham). Individuals whose serum Ca concentration was less than 8 mg/dL on four days after the operation were selected for use as TPTX rats. On five days after the operation, the rats were assigned to eight TPTX groups and one Sham group (n=5, each group) based on their body weight and serum Ca concentration measured on four days after the operation. The solvent alone was orally administered to the Sham group and the TPTX-Vehicle group at a volume of 10 mL/kg. Each test article was orally administered individually to each TPTX test article group by dissolving it in a solvent at a dose of 30 mg/10 mL/kg. The solvent composition was 10% dimethylsulfoxide (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.), 10% Cremophor EL (Sigma-Aldrich Japan LLC), 20% hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (Nihon Shokuhin Kako Co., Ltd.), glycine (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.); and the pH was adjusted to 10. Immediately before administration of each sample, Pre-blood collection was performed, and blood collection was carried out at 2, 6, 10, and 24 hours after administration to measure the serum Ca concentration. Each blood collection was carried out from the jugular vein under isoflurane inhalation anesthesia. Serum Ca measurement: Serum obtained by centrifugation from the collected blood was measured by using an automatic analyzer TBA-120FR (Toshiba Medical Systems Corporation). For statistical analysis of the animal studies, data are shown as mean±standard error (SE). Statistical analysis were performed by unpaired test of the SAS Preclinical Package (Ver. 5.00.010720, SAS Institute Japan, Tokyo, Japan). A p-value of <0.05 was regarded as statistically significant. Statistically significant of each test article group comparing to the TPTX-Vehicle group, the Comparative Example 1 group, and the Comparative Example 2 group was shown as #, *, and ∫ respectively. The Pre-value for the serum Ca concentration was 9.9 mg/dL for the Sham group, and 5.3-6.2 mg/dL for each of the TPTX groups. The serum Ca concentrations for each compound up to 24 hours after administration are shown in FIG. 1 as the average amount of change from the Pre-value. Furthermore, for all of the compounds, the serum Ca concentration peaked at six hours after administration or ten hours after administration of each compound. Compounds 6, 7, and 8 which have high rat hepatocyte metabolic stability showed large positive changes from the Pre-value, and their oral administration showed strong effects on calcemic action. On the other hand, Compound 1, and Comparative Examples 1 and 2 which have low rat hepatocyte metabolic stability showed smaller positive changes from the Pre-value compared to Compounds 6, 7, and 8. In particular, Compounds 7 and 8 were statistically significant compared to Comparative Examples 1 and 2. Furthermore, Compounds 6, 7, and 8 which have high rat hepatocyte metabolic stability showed individual maximum values of 7.8 to 8.5 mg/dL at six or ten hours after administration, and achieved the therapeutic target range of serum Ca concentration of 7.6 to 8.8 mg/dL in hypoparathyroidism patients. On the other hand, this therapeutic target range could not be achieved at any of the measurement times for Compound 1, and Comparative Examples 1 and 2 which have low rat hepatocyte metabolic stability. From the above-mentioned test results, Compounds 6, 7, and 8, which have strong cAMP-signaling activities in cells forced to express rat PTH1R and high stability against metabolic breakdown in rat hepatocytes were found to show strong effects on calcemic action in rats when administered orally. These compounds also have cAMP-signaling activity in cells forced to express human PTH1R and high metabolic stability against human liver microsomes compared to the Comparative Compounds; and they are expected to have high therapeutic effects when administered orally to hypoparathyroidism patients. Furthermore, compounds represented by Formula (1), which have cAMP-signaling activity in cells forced to express human PTH1R and show metabolic stability against human liver microsomes to the same degree as Compounds 6, 7, and 8, are also expected to have high therapeutic effects in hypoparathyroidism patients.
