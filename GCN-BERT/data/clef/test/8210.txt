Therefore, where a compound is chiral, the separate enantiomers, substantially free of the other, are included within the scope of the invention. Further included are all mixtures of the two enantiomers. Also included within the scope of the invention are polymorphs and hydrates of the compounds of the instant invention. The present invention includes within its scope prodrugs of the compounds 1 and 2. In general, such prodrugs will be functional derivatives of the compounds of this invention which are readily convertible in vivo into the required compound. The term “therapeutically effective amount” shall mean that amount of a drug or pharmaceutical agent that will elicit the biological or medical response of a tissue, system, animal or human that is being sought by a researcher or clinician. As used herein, the term “composition” is intended to encompass a product comprising the specified ingredients in the specified amounts, as well as any product which results, directly or indirectly, from combination of the specified ingredients in the specified amounts. In the combination of the present invention, the components 1 and 2 may be administered separately or together in one pharmaceutical composition. In addition, the administration of one element of the combination of the present invention may be prior to, concurrent to, or subsequent to the administration of the other element of the combination. The elements of the combination of 1 and 2 may be administered by oral, parenteral (e.g., intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intravenous or subcutaneous injection, or implant), buccal, nasal, vaginal, rectal, sublingual, or topical (e.g. ocular eyedrop) routes of administration and may be formulated, alone or together, in suitable dosage unit formulations containing conventional non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, adjuvants and vehicles appropriate for each route of administration. The pharmaceutical compositions for the administration of the components 1 and 2 of this invention may conveniently be presented in dosage unit form and may be prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. All methods include the step of bringing the active ingredient into association with the carrier which is constituted of one or more accessory ingredients. In general, the pharmaceutical compositions are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing the active ingredients into association with a liquid carrier or a finely divided solid carrier or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product into the desired dosage form. In the pharmaceutical compositions the active compounds are included in an amount sufficient to produce the desired pharmacologic effect. The pharmaceutical compositions containing the active ingredients 1 and 2, separately or together, that are suitable for oral administration may be in the form of discrete units such as hard or soft capsules, tablets, troches or lozenges, each containing a predetermined amount of the active ingredients; in the form of a dispersible powder or granules; in the form of a solution or a suspension in an aqueous liquid or non-aqueous liquid; in the form of syrups or elixirs; or in the form of an oil-in-water emulsion or a water-in-oil emulsion. Dosage forms intended for oral use may be prepared according to any method known in the art for the manufacture of pharmaceutical formulations and such compositions. The excipients used may be for example, (a) inert diluents such as mannitol, sorbitol, calcium carbonate, pregelatinized starch, lactose, calcium phosphate or sodium phosphate; (b) granulating and disintegrating agents, such as povidone, copovidone, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, corn starch, alginic acid, crospovidone, sodiumstarchglycolate, croscarmellose, or polacrilin potassium; (c) binding agents such as microcrystalline cellulose or acacia; and (d) lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate, stearic acid, fumaric acid or talc. In some cases, formulations for oral use may be in the form of hard gelatin or HPMC capsules wherein the active ingredient 1 or 2, separately or together, is mixed with an inert solid diluent, for example pregelatinized starch, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate or kaolin, or dispensed via a pellet formulation. They may also be in the form of soft gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with water or an oil medium, for example peanut oil, liquid paraffin, medium chain triglycerides or olive oil. The tablets, capsules or pellets may be uncoated or they may be coated by known techniques to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a delayed action or sustained action over a longer period. For example, a time delay material such as celluloseacetate phtalate or hydroxypropylcellulose acetate succinate or sustained release material such as ethylcellulose or ammoniomethacrylate copolymer (type B) may be employed. Liquid dosage forms for oral administration include pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups, and elixirs containing inert diluents commonly used in the art, such as water. Besides such inert diluents, compositions can also include adjuvants, such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, and sweetening, flavoring, perfuming and preserving agents. Aqueous suspensions normally contain the active materials 1 and 2, separately or together, in admixture with excipients suitable for the manufacture of aqueous suspensions. Such excipients may be (a) suspending agents such as hydroxy ethylcellulose, sodium carboxymethyicellulose, methylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, sodium alginate, polyvinylpyrrolidone, gum tragacanth and gum acacia; (b) dispersing or wetting agents which may be (b.1) a naturally-occurring phosphatide such as lecithin, (b.2) a condensation product of an alkylene oxide with a fatty acid, for example, polyoxyethylene stearate, (b.3) a condensation product of ethylene oxide with a long chain aliphatic alcohol, for example heptadecaethyleneoxycetanol, (b.4) a condensation product of ethylene oxide with a partial ester derived from a fatty acid and a hexitol such as polyoxyethylene sorbitol monooleate, or (b.5) a condensation product of ethylene oxide with a partial ester derived from a fatty acid and a hexitol anhydride, for example polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate. The aqueous suspensions may also contain one or more preservatives, for example, ethyl or n-propyl p-hydroxybenzoate; one or more coloring agents; one or more flavoring agents; and one or more sweetening agents, such as sucrose or saccharin. Oily suspensions may be formulated by suspending the active ingredients 1 and 2, separately or together, in a vegetable oil, for example arachis oil, olive oil, sesame oil or coconut oil, or in a mineral oil such as liquid paraffin. The oily suspensions may contain a thickening agent, for example beeswax, hard paraffin or cetyl alcohol. Sweetening agents and flavoring agents may be added to provide a palatable oral preparation. These compositions may be prepared by the addition of an antioxidant such as ascorbic acid. Dispersible powders and granules are suitable for the preparation of an aqueous suspension. They provide the active ingredients 1 and 2 separately or together, in admixture with a dispersing or wetting agent, a suspending agent and one or more preservatives. Suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents are exemplified by those already mentioned above. Additional excipients, for example, those sweetening, flavoring and coloring agents described above may also be present. The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may also be in the form of oil-in-water emulsions. The oily phase may be a vegetable oil such as olive oil or arachis oils, or a mineral oil such as liquid paraffin or a mixture thereof. Suitable emulsifying agents may be (a) naturally-occurring gums such as gum acacia and gum tragacanth, (b) naturally-occurring phosphatides such as soybean and lecithin, (c) esters or partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, for example, sorbitan monooleate, (d) condensation products of said partial esters with ethylene oxide, for example polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate. The emulsions may also contain sweetening and flavoring agents. Syrups and elixirs may be formulated with sweetening agents, for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, sorbitol or sucrose. Such formulations may also contain a preservative and flavoring and coloring agents. The pharmaceutical compositions containing 1 and 2, separately or together, may be in the form of a sterile injectable aqueous or oleagenous suspension or solution. The suspension may be formulated according to known methods using those suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents which have been mentioned above. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally-acceptable diluent or solvent, for example as a solution in 1,3-butane-diol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid find use in the preparation of injectables. Preparations according to this invention containing 1 and 2 separately or together, for parenteral administration include sterile aqueous or non-aqueous solutions, suspension, or emulsions. Examples of non-aqueous solvents or vehicles are propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, vegetable oils, such as olive oil and corn oil, gelatin, and injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate. Such dosage forms may also contain adjuvants such as preserving, wetting, emulsifying, and dispersing agents. They may be sterilized by, for example, filtration through a bacteria-retaining filter, by incorporating sterilizing agents into the compositions, by irradiating the compositions, or by heating the compositions. They can also be manufactured in the form of sterile solid compositions which can be reconstituted in sterile water, or some other sterile injectable medium immediately before use. The combination of this invention may also be administered in the form of suppositories for rectal administration. This composition can be prepared by mixing the drugs with a suitable non-irritating excipient which is solid at ordinary temperatures, e.g., room temperature, but liquid at the rectal temperature and will therefore melt in the rectum to release the drug. Such materials are cocoa butter, hard fat, and polyethylene glycols. Compositions for buccal, nasal or sublingual administration are also prepared with standard excipients well known in the art. For topical administration the combinations of this invention containing 1 and 2, separately or together, may be formulated in liquid or semi-liquid preparations such as liniments, lotions, applications; oil-in-water or water-in-oil emulsions such as creams, ointments, jellies or pastes, including tooth-pastes; or solutions or suspensions such as drops, and the like. The dosage of the active ingredients in the compositions of this invention may be varied. However, it is necessary that the amount of the active ingredients 1 and 2 be such that a suitable dosage form is obtained. The selected dosage and the dosage form depend upon the desired therapeutic effect, on the route of administration and on the duration of the treatment. Dosage ranges in the combination are approximately one tenth to one times the clinically effective ranges required to induce the desired therapeutic effect, respectively when the compounds are used singly.
