BOTTLE KIT The invention relates to assemblies of feeding bottles and containers for infants and toddlers. More particularly, the invention relates to a bottle kit comprising at least a first and a second bottle, each of said bottles having a container bottom portion and a closure portion, the container bottom portion extending along an extension direction from a closed end to an open end, the closure portion having an open end adapted to be removably attached to the open end of the container bottom portion. For feeding to an infant or toddler, it is generally necessary to have multiple bottles (bottles for example three) inter alia to reduce the number of times of cleaning and/or sterilizing. Such packages of feeding bottles have unfortunately considerable space which may be annoying, especially during travel or during storage in the home. To solve these problems, the document FR 2,816 499 for example, provides a set of disposable bottle having a flared shape to be stacked and arranged in a small package. This solution has however several disadvantages. The bottles are cut from one another during transport. Sealing bottles is further not guaranteed because the nipples are attached to the bodies of the bottles without locking means. Finally, the size of the package is not sufficiently reduced to allow ease of transport. The present invention is to improve the situation. To this end, according to the invention, a kit for baby bottles of the kind in question is characterized in that the open end of the container bottom portion of the first bottle has a larger cross section than the largest cross-section bottom portions of other container bottles, said sections are taken perpendicular to the direction of extension, and in that the first bottle integrally engages the bottom portions of the other container bottles when the closing part of the first bottle is attached to the open end of the container bottom portion of the first bottle. By these arrangements, the first bottles bottle kit can trap the other bottles of the kit to allow ease of transport and the space saving when stored at home. A kit for bottles according to the invention also has the advantage of feeding bottles of different size, which are advantageous for monitoring the growth of the child and/or adapt the amounts of food provided according to the circumstances (time of day, day, ...) . Each bottle has good sealability. The shape of the parts of container bottom is also provided to facilitate cleaning of the interior of the bottles which may be achieved without washing brush or in a dishwasher. Finally, the number of feeding bottles included in the kit makes it possible to reduce the number of times of cleaning and/or sterilizing. In preferred embodiments of the invention, optionally in addition to one and/or the other of the following arrangements: the closed ends of the container base portions are in contact with each other when the first bottle traps the other bottles and is placed vertically, the closed end of the container bottom portion of the first bottle downward relative to an axis of gravity, -the first closure portion of the bottle has an annular flank with a diameter substantially equal to the inner diameter of the second closure portion of the bottle, the closure part of the second bottle can be detachably secured to said flange by elastic deformation, the sealing portion of each of the bottle comprises an upper container portion extending in a second direction extending from a first open end to a second open end, the second open end being adapted to be removably attached to the open end of the container bottom portion of said bottle, the bottle kit further comprises at least one locking ring, said locking ring being adapted to be detachably secured to each of the first ends of the upper portions of container bottles, the sealing portion of each of the bottle has a locking collar adapted to be detachably secured to the container bottom portion of said bottle, the closure part at least one baby bottle includes a nipple adapted to be mounted on each of the bottles, the attachment of the locking ring tightly engages a nipple flange between said clamping ring and a member selected from the said clamping ring and a member selected from the portion bottom container and part upper of container the bottle - the kit bottle comprises in addition a third bottle part of bACKGROUND of container i and a portion of closure, the portion of container bottom extending in an extending direction from a closed end to an open end, the closure portion having an open end adapted to be removably attached to the open end of the container bottom portion, the container bottom portion of the third bottle has a body portion extending from the open end, the open end of the container bottom portion of the third bottle being similar in size to the open end of the container bottom portion of the second bottle, the largest cross-section of the third body portion of the bottle being of dimensions smaller than the largest cross-section of the container bottom portion of the second bottle, the height of the container bottom portion of the third bottle being greater than the height of the container bottom portion of the second bottle. Some embodiments also have the following advantages. The locking rings are interchangeable between the bottles bottle of the kit. The teats are interchangeable between the bottles bottle of the kit. Some bottle kit bottles are of different shapes to reduce the footprint of the bottles kit but same volume to reduce the number of times of cleaning and/or sterilizing. Each bottle is completely autonomous with respect to other bottles, said bottles do not share any work and therefore may be used independently of each other. The invention also relates to a locking ring for use with a baby bottle having an upper end and a lower end, said ends being each provided with an opening, the ring having, at its upper end, an annular flank of a diameter substantially equal to the diameter of the opening in its lower end, so that a locking ring identical, detachably secured to said flange by elastic deformation.
