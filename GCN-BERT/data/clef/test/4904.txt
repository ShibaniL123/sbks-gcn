CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION This application claims priority under 35 USC Section 119 to and the benefit of Korean Patent Application 10-2014-0052797, filed on Apr. 30, 2014, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a method for preparing a carbonic ester using an organometallic compound. BACKGROUND A carbonic ester is a monomer useful in preparation of polycarbonates, and many studies have been made on preparation of the carbonic ester. Conventionally, a carbonic ester has been prepared through reaction of an alcohol with phosgene as a carbonyl source. However, this method has a problem of use of phosgene, which is a very toxic compound, and also brings problems with use of a chlorinated solvent and disposal of neutral by-product salts. To overcome these problems, a method for preparing a carbonic ester using carbon monoxide as a carbonyl source has been developed. However, when carbon monoxide is used as a carbonyl source, there are problems of reduction in reaction speed and yield, a high risk of explosion due to use of toxic carbon monoxide at high pressure, and costs for securing safety. In addition, there is a concern of side reactions, such as generation of carbon dioxide caused by oxidation of carbon monoxide. There has also been developed a method wherein carbon dioxide is reacted with ethylene oxide and the like to prepare a cyclic carbonic ester, followed by reacting the cyclic carbonic ester with methanol, producing dimethyl carbonate. This method has advantages in that harmless carbon dioxide is used as a carbonyl source, and corrosive materials are hardly generated. However, this method can cause side reactions such as generation of ethylene glycol, and has a limitation relating to plant location due to difficulty in safe transport of ethylene oxide or ethylene, which is a source of ethylene oxide. Recently, a method for preparing a carbonic ester by reacting carbon dioxide with an organometallic compound has been studied. It has also been found that, after separation of a carbonic ester from a mixture produced by the method, the organometallic compound can be reproduced by reaction of a residual liquid with an alcohol. In other words, the used organometallic compound can be recycled to be reused in formation of the carbonic ester, thereby eliminating transport-related problems. As such an organometallic compound, there are disclosed compounds in the form of Sn(R)2(OR′)2 (R and R′ being two different alkyl groups) which includes tin as a center metal and contains two alkyl groups and an alkoxy group (Japanese Patent Publication No. 2010-523783 A, No. 2006-548937 A, No. 2006-513613 A, No. 2007-269653 A, No. 2005-511122 A, No. 2003-556375 A, and the like). However, these known organometallic compounds have a problem of low reactivity and reduction in production yield of a carbonic ester. Therefore, there is a need for a method which can overcome these problems. SUMMARY Embodiments of the present invention provide a method for preparing a carbonic ester using an organometallic compound, in which a carbonic ester can be prepared in high yield using a specific organometallic compound, carbon dioxide, and an alcohol and/or without requiring a process of recycling the organometallic compound.

[in-line-formulae]R3OCOOR4 [Formula 3][/in-line-formulae] wherein R3 and R4 are the same or different and may each independently be a C1 to C10 hydrocarbon group, for example, a C1 to C8 alkyl group and/or a C6 to C10 aryl group, and as another example a methyl group, an ethyl group, an n-propyl group, an isopropyl group, an n-butyl group, an isobutyl group, a tert-butyl group, an n-pentyl group, an isopentyl group, an n-hexyl group, and/or a phenyl group. R3 and R4 may be derived from R1 of the organometallic compound and R2 of the alcohol. In exemplary embodiments, the method for preparing a carbonic ester may be carried out by a batch reaction, a continuous reaction, and the like. In the method for preparing a carbonic ester according to exemplary embodiments of the invention, the reaction may be performed by typical batch reaction. For example, reaction may be performed at a temperature of about 130° C. to about 230° C., for example, at about 140° C. to about 190° C., and at a carbon dioxide pressure of about 10 bar to about 300 bar, for example, about 40 bar to about 290 bar. Within this range, it is possible to secure rapid reaction and to prepare a carbonic ester in high yield. Typically, batch reaction is performed in consideration of a conversion rate and a volume of a reactor, and is a solution process avoiding overheating. In addition, the reaction is performed using a C1 to C10 alcohol, which is a liquid reactant, carbon dioxide which is a gaseous reactant, and a solid organometallic compound, and thus does not require a separate solvent. In other words, the reaction may be homogeneous reaction wherein carbon dioxide and the organometallic compound are dissolved in the alcohol to react with one another. Mixing in a reactor may be performed using a magnetic bar, a mechanical mixer, and the like, and may be performed at a mixing speed of about 300 rpm to about 1,000 rpm, for example, about 400 rpm to about 500 rpm for a reaction time of about 0.5 hours to about 24 hours, for example, about 1 hour to about 3 hours. The reaction can be performed in a region where mass transfer at an interface between carbon dioxide and the alcohol has a maximum value in view of a state of the organometallic compound and viscosity of a solvent. Such batch reaction can be easily performed by those skilled in the art. For example, in this method, the carbonic ester can be produced by reaction represented by Reaction Formula 1. wherein each R may be the same or different and may be a C1 to C10 hydrocarbon group, for example, a C1 to C8 alkyl group and/or a C6 to C10 aryl group, and as another example a methyl group, an ethyl group, an n-propyl group, an isopropyl group, an n-butyl group, an isobutyl group, a tert-butyl group, an n-pentyl group, an isopentyl group, an n-hexyl group, and/or a phenyl group. In exemplary embodiments, the organometallic compound may be added in an amount of about 1 part by mole to about 100 parts by mole, for example, about 3 parts by mole to about 60 parts by mole, based on about 100 parts by mole of the alcohol. Within this range, the carbonic ester can be produced in high yield. In the method for preparing a carbonic ester according to the invention, the organometallic compound is reacted with carbon dioxide and the C1 to C10 alcohol at the same time, whereby the carbonic ester can be obtained in high yield. In addition, in the method for preparing a carbonic ester, the organometallic compound can be reused without a process of recycling the organometallic compound. Specifically, the organometallic compound may be contained in a residual liquid after separation of the carbonic ester, the C1 to C10 alcohol, and impurities such as water from a product obtained by the method for preparing a carbonic ester.

However, it should be understood that these examples are provided for illustration only and are not to be construed in any way as limiting the present invention.
