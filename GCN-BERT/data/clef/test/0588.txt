No. 13/822,406, filed on Mar. 12, 2013, which was filed as PCT International Application No. PCT/EP2011/070736 on Nov. 23, 2011, which claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. §119(a) to Patent Application No. 1059634, filed in France on Nov. 23, 2010, all of which are hereby expressly incorporated by reference into the present application. The present invention concerns derivatives of heteroarylsulfonamides, their preparation and their applications in human therapy, as blockers of Kv potassium channels and specifically channels Kv1.5, Kv4.3 and Kv11.1. Potassium channels represent the largest family of ion channels in the human genome, with approximately 80 genes (Tamargo et al., Cardiovasc. Res. 2004, 62: 9-33). These potassium channels can be subdivided into 3 sub-families: channels activated by potential or voltage (4 channels) and calcium (KCa channels), inward rectifier channels (Kir) and two-pore potassium channels (K2p). The sub-family of voltage-activated channels is the one most represented in the human organism, with an almost ubiquitous distribution in excitable cells (cardiac cells, neurons, striated or smooth muscle cells) and non-excitable cells such as pancreatic, prostatic, parathyroid cells, etc. (for review, Gutman G et al., Pharmacol. Rev. 2005, 57:473-508). The main function of the Kv potassium channels in excitable cells is the control of the resting membrane potential and of the action potential duration (Nerbonne and Kass, Physiol. Rev. 2005, 85:1205-1253). As such, several Kv channels are involved in this control, in both the heart auricles and ventricles. The Kv4.3 channels associated with the KChIP 2 sub-units form the current Ito which is involved in the premature repolarisation phase of the action potential (PA), the KVLQT1/MinK and hERG channels which are involved in the late repolarisation phase of the PA (generating respectively currents IKs and IKr). The abovementioned channels are distributed uniformly between the heart auricles and ventricles. However, two other types of potassium channels show a distribution only in the auricles. The potential-dependent potassium channels (Kv1.5) responsible for the current IKur and the acetylcholine-activated inward rectifier channels (Kir3.1 and Kir3.4 responsible for current IK-Ach). Modifications of the membranous electrical activity are observed in many pathologies, notably heart rhythm disorder pathologies. Among the latter, atrial fibrillation (FA) is a serious rhythm disorder which corresponds to totally desynchronised activity of the atrial myocytes resulting in interrupted, rapid and irregular electrical activity. FA is caused by the appearance of electrical reentry circuits in the atrial tissue (Miyasaka Y et al., Circulation 2006, 114:119-125). There is currently no specific anti-arhythmic treatment of the atrial stage to reduce the incidence of FA, which therefore constitutes an important medical need (Page and Roden, Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2005, 4:899-910). The presence of many simultaneously activated micro-reentry circuits explains the anarchic character of the electrical activity observed either by intracavitary means or in electrocardiograms. This rhythmic disorder generally develops on a pathological atrial myocardium in electrophysiological terms, the refractory periods of which are too short and too unequal, and therefore very vulnerable to the smallest extrasystole. These anomalies form part of a phenomenon of myocardial remodelling, following a pressure overload or a stretching causing morphological alterations (hypertrophy, dilatation, fibrosis), as well as modifications in the regulation of the trans-membranous ionic currents, modifying the electrophysiological characteristics of the atrial myocytes. Given that each FA access maintains, or aggravates, this mechanical and electrophysiological remodelling process, it will be understood that FA has a great potential risk of recurrence, and that its natural development is towards chronicity. Conversely, focal-type FAs have recently been identified, originating in a precise point, which is almost always found to be an extension of the atrial myocardium in the pulmonary veins. These quite rare cases of FA have a quite monomorphous character, and in any event one which is comparable to that of atrial extrasystoles initiating access, or observed intermittently between crises. In all cases, the consequence of the loss of the atrial systole is a reduction in the heart rate of between 20 and 30%, and higher the more the rate is reduced to the basal state. Simultaneously, the existence of blood stasis in the atrial cavities, notably in certain pockets such as the auricles, accounts for the thromboembolic risk. However, the embolic risk is only partially conditional on the presence of the FA alone, since atrial stasis is also related to the increase of intracavitary pressures (systolic or diastolic left ventricular dysfunction, valvular heart disease or valve replacement). Electrical remodelling therefore constitutes the major substrate of the genesis of the FA; it results from a diminution of the activity of the L-type calcic channels allowing the Kv1.5 potassium channels to play fully their repolarising role through the ultra-rapid potassium current (Bhakta and Miller, Expert Opin. Ther. Targets 2007, 11:1161-1178). Its consequence is a dramatic shortening of the refractory period, which constitutes the triggering factor of micro-reentries. Bearing in mind that the Kv1.5 potassium channels are not expressed functionally in the ventricular stage, a blocker of these channels will therefore constitute a selected anti-arhythmic of the atrial stage without affecting the ventricular electrophysiology. Its pharmacological effect takes the form of a lengthening of the refractory period, and therefore a lesser incidence of micro-reentry circuits. A quantity of experimental data obtained with reference products confirms the interest of the blockage of Kv1.5 as a therapeutic target (Gögelein et al., Naunyn Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 2004, 370:183-192; Regan et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2008, 324:322-330). Rapid changes of membrane potential are well-known in excitable cells, but slow variations of potential are observed in all the cells and are associated with the control of the cell cycle. The cell cycle is a key parameter in cell behaviour, which must be regulated and coordinated for development, tissue regeneration and cell proliferation (Pardo, Physiology, 2004, 19:285-292; Blackistion et al., Cell Cycle, 2009, 8-21:3527-3536). Generally speaking, the blockage of the potassium channels leads to reduced proliferation in physiological models (as in lymphocytes) and pathological models (cancer). The role of the potassium channels in regulating the cell cycle has been demonstrated in many cell types, whether physiological or pathological (cancer cell lines or tumours) originating from human melanoma, lung cancer, lymphoma, mesothelioma, hepatocellular carcinoma, lymphocytes, monocytes (for review Pardo et al., J. Membr. Biol, 2005, 205:115-124). As used previously, the term “Kv” indicates the family of voltage-dependent potassium channels, and includes various sub-families (Kv1, Kv2, Kv3, etc.) among which are the Kv1.1, Kv1.2, Kv1.3 channels, . . . “A blacker of the Kv channels” denotes a molecule which reduces or blocks the K+ ion flow through the channel. As used here, the term “salts” designates acid or base addition salts, notably mineral ones, of the compounds of the present invention, and notably base addition salts using bases such as LION, KOH or NaOH or acid addition salts using acids such as HCl. The salts are preferably pharmaceutically acceptable, i.e. they are non-toxic for the patient to whom they are administered. The term “pharmaceutically acceptable” refers to molecular entities and compositions producing no adverse or allergic effect, or other undesirable reaction when administered to an animal or a human. When used here, the term “pharmaceutically acceptable excipient” includes all diluents, additives or excipients, such as preservative agents, fillers, disintegrating agents, wetting agents, emulsifiers, dispersants, anti-bacterials or antifungals, or also agents allowing intestinal and digestive absorption and resorption to be slowed. The use of these media or vectors is well-known in the art. Unless the agent is chemically incompatible with a derivative of heteroarylsulfonamides its use in pharmaceutical compositions with the compounds according to the invention is envisaged. In the context of the invention, the term “treatment”, as used here, means inhibiting the occurrence or progress of the affection to which the term applies, or one or more symptoms of this affection.

The sulfonamide group (—NH—SO2HetAr) can be located on the phenyl core Y in ortho, meta or para of the position occupied by group D. “Linear or branched C1-C4 alkyl” means, in the sense of the present invention, a linear or branched hydrocarbon chain, including 1 to 4 carbon atoms, such as the methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, sec-butyl, isobutyl and tert-butyl groups. “Linear or branched C1-C4 alkoxy”, means, in the sense of the present invention, a linear or branched C1-C4 alkyl group as defined above linked to the remainder of the molecule through an oxygen atom, such as the methoxy, ethoxy, n-propoxy, isopropoxy, n-butoxy, sec-butoxy, isobutoxy and tert-butoxy groups.

The present invention also extends to the methods of chemical preparation of the compounds of general formula I as notably defined below. Synthesis The compounds of the present invention can be synthesised by using the methods of synthesis described below, or by using methods of synthesis known to the skilled man in the art. Method 1 (when B═N) This method of synthesis of the compounds of general formula I with B═N (diagram 1) is characterised by the following successive steps: (a1) A derivative of general formula II for which R1, A and n are as defined in general formula I is condensed, with a derivative of isatoic anhydride XV for which R2 is as defined in general formula I, in the presence of a base such as DMAP, notably in a blend of solvents such as THE and DMF. (a2) The intermediate III obtained is then condensed with a sulfonyl chloride of general formula IV for which HetAr is as defined in general formula I in the presence of a base such as pyridine, notably in a solvent such as dichloromethane. (a3) The compound of formula I obtained in the previous step (a2) may be salified in the presence of a pharmaceutically acceptable base or acid in order to give a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the compound of formula I. Method 2 (when B═N) This method of synthesis of the compounds of general formula I with B═N (diagram 2) is characterised by the following successive steps: (b1) A derivative of general formula V for which R3 represents a linear or branched C1-C4 alkyl such as a methyl or ethyl and R2 is such as defined in general formula I is condensed, with a sulfonyl chloride of general formula IV for which HetAr is as defined in general formula I. in the presence of a base such as pyridine, notably in a solvent such as dichloromethane. (b2) The compound VI obtained in this manner is saponified, notably in the presence of a base such as potash, in particular in a solvent such as ethanol, to give the compound VII. (b3) The latter is coupled with the previously defined intermediate II to give the compound of formula I, notably under process conditions such as in the presence of TBTU and Et3N in a solvent such as acetonitrile. (b4) The compound of formula I obtained in the previous step (b3) may be converted into a salt in the presence of a pharmaceutically acceptable base or acid in order to give a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the compound of formula I. Method 3 (when B═CH) This method of synthesis of the compounds of general formula I with B═CH (diagram 3) is characterised by the following successive steps: (c1) A derivative of general formula VIII for which R2 is as defined in general formula I is condensed, with a derivative of general formula IX for which D and n are as defined in general formula I when B represents CH. notably under process conditions such as those of Mitsunobu coupling in the presence of triphenylphosphine, of diethylazodicarboxylate in THF. (c2) The intermediate X obtained in this manner is then reduced, notably by using process conditions such as palladium on carbon in an atmosphere of hydrogen in a solvent such as ethanol, which enables intermediate XI to be isolated. (c3) The latter is coupled with a sulfonyl chloride of general formula IV for which HetAr is as defined in general formula I, in the presence of a base such as pyridine, notably in a solvent such as dichloromethane, leading to intermediate XII. (c4) The amide group of the latter is hydrolysed, notably in the presence of trifluoroacetic acid, notably in a solvent such as dichloromethane to give intermediate XIII. (c5) The compound XIII is then coupled with intermediate XIV for which R1 and A are as defined in general formula I, notably under process conditions such as in the presence of bicarbonate of soda in a blend of solvents such as ethanol and water, to give the compound of general formula I. (c6) The compound of formula I obtained in the previous step (c5) may be salified in the presence of a pharmaceutically acceptable base or acid in order to give a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the compound of formula I. The intermediate and final compounds may if desired be purified using one or more methods of purification chosen from among extraction, filtration, chromatography on silica gel, preparatory HPLC in the normal or reverse phase, or crystallisation.

MS (+ESI) m/z 558 (MH+) C) Pharmacological Evaluation The pharmacological evaluation of the compounds on potassium channel Kv1.5 was undertaken using a 96-well plate and FLIPR technology by thallium ion measurement. The HEK293 cells, transfected in a stable manner with the human isoform of the Kv1.5 channels, are seeded 24 h before the experiment in 96-well plates (15 108 cells/plate, 200 μl/well) with polylysine applied in the following culture medium: DMEM, 10% SVF, Penicillin/Streptomycin, G418 as the selection antibiotic. The FLIPR experiment is undertaken using “FLIPR Potassium Ion Channel Assay Kit”, as indicated by the manufacturer (Molecular Devices). Briefly, the culture medium is replaced by the solution containing the thallium marker for 90 min at 37° C. On conclusion of this step the compounds for testing are added to a final concentration of 10 μM in the well for 15 min at 37° C. The basic fluorescence is then read for 60 sec. The addition of depolarising medium (20 mM of potassium and 3 mM of final thallium) opens the potassium channels and causes an increase of the fluorescence of the thallium fluorophore corresponding to an influx of thallium ions through the hKv1.5 channels. The measurement is made 30 sec after the injection of the depolarising solution. The application of 10 μM DPO (Tocris, blocker of the Kv1.5 channels) enables the fluorescence to be normalised.
