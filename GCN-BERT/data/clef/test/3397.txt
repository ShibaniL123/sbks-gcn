FIELD OF THE INVENTION Presently disclosed embodiments are related to pharmaceutical compositions of piperazine compounds and P450 inhibitors and processes for the preparation thereof. Presently disclosed embodiments particularly relate to pharmaceutical compositions that include piperazine compounds and at least one P450 inhibitor in combination with one or more diluents, disintegrants, binders and/or lubricants. BACKGROUND Vanoxerine (1-[2-[bis(4-fluorophenyl)methoxy]ethyl]-4-(3-phenylpropyl)piperazine), its manufacture and/or certain pharmaceutical uses thereof are described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,202,896, U.S. Pat. No. 4,476,129, U.S. Pat. No. 4,874,765, U.S. Pat. No. 6,743,797 and U.S. Pat. No. 7,700,600, as well as European Patent EP 243,903 and PCT International Application WO 91/01732, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Vanoxerine has been used for treating cocaine addiction, acute effects of cocaine, and cocaine cravings in mammals, as well as dopamine agonists for the treatment of Parkinsonism, acromegaly, hyperprolactinemia and diseases arising from a hypofunction of the dopaminergic system. (See U.S. Pat. No. 4,202,896 and WO 91/01732.) Vanoxerine has also been used for treating and preventing cardiac arrhythmia in mammals. (See U.S. Pat. No. 6,743,797 and U.S. Pat. No. 7,700,600.) It is desirable to identify piperazine compounds and to optimize the piperazine compounds in a novel composition comprising the piperazine compounds in combination with CYP3A4 inhibitors to maintain a pre-determined plasma level of vanoxerine, particularly for human use. Atrial flutter and/or atrial fibrillation (AF) are the most commonly sustained cardiac arrhythmias in clinical practice, and are likely to increase in prevalence with the aging of the population. Currently, AF affects more than 1 million Americans annually, represents over 5% of all admissions for cardiovascular diseases and causes more than 80,000 strokes each year in the United States. While AF is rarely a lethal arrhythmia, it is responsible for substantial morbidity and can lead to complications such as the development of congestive heart failure or thromboembolism. Currently available Class I and Class III anti-arrhythmic drugs reduce the rate of recurrence of AF, but are of limited use because of a variety of potentially adverse effects, including ventricular proarrhythmia. Because current therapy is inadequate and fraught with side effects, there is a clear need to develop new therapeutic approaches. Ventricular fibrillation (VF) is the most common cause associated with acute myocardial infarction, ischemic coronary artery disease and congestive heart failure. As with AF, current therapy is inadequate and there is a need to develop new therapeutic approaches. Although various anti-arrhythmic agents are now available on the market, those having both satisfactory efficacy and a high margin of safety have not been obtained. For example, anti-arrhythmic agents of Class I, according to the classification scheme of Vaughan-Williams (“Classification of antiarrhythmic drugs,” Cardiac Arrhythmias, edited by: E. Sandoe, E. Flensted-Jensen, K. Olesen; Sweden, Astra, Sodertalje, pp 449-472 (1981)), which cause a selective inhibition of the maximum velocity of the upstroke of the action potential (Vmax) are inadequate for preventing ventricular fibrillation because they shorten the wave length of the cardiac action potential, thereby favoring re-entry. In addition, they have problems regarding safety, i.e. they cause a depression of myocardial contractility and have a tendency to induce arrhythmias due to an inhibition of impulse conduction. The CAST (coronary artery suppression trial) study was terminated while in progress because the Class I antagonists had a higher mortality than placebo controls. β-adrenergenic receptor blockers and calcium channel (ICa) antagonists, which belong to Class II and Class IV, respectively, have a defect in that their effects are either limited to a certain type of arrhythmia or are contraindicated because of their cardiac depressant properties in certain patients with cardiovascular disease. Their safety, however, is higher than that of the anti-arrhythmic agents of Class I. Anti-arrhythmic agents of Class III are drugs that cause a selective prolongation of the action potential duration (APD) without a significant depression of the maximum upstroke velocity (Vmax). They therefore lengthen the save length of the cardiac action potential increasing refractories, thereby antagonizing re-entry. Available drugs in this class are limited in number. Examples such as sotalol and amiodarone have been shown to possess interesting Class III properties (Singh B. N., Vaughan Williams E. M., “A third class of anti-arrhythmic action: effects on atrial and ventricular intracellular potentials and other pharmacological actions on cardiac muscle of MJ 1999 and AH 3747,” Br. J. Pharmacol 39:675-689 (1970), and Singh B. N., Vaughan Williams E. M., “The effect of amiodarone, a new anti-anginal drug, on cardiac muscle,” Br. J. Pharmacol 39:657-667 (1970)), but these are not selective Class III agents. Sotalol also possesses Class II (β-adrenergic blocking) effects which may cause cardiac depression and is contraindicated in certain susceptible patients. Amiodarone also is not a selective Class III antiarrhythmic agent because it possesses multiple electrophysiological actions and is severely limited by side effects. (Nademanee, K., “The Amiodarone Odyssey,” J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 20:1063-1065 (1992)) Drugs of this class are expected to be effective in preventing ventricular fibrillation. Selective Class III agents, by definition, are not considered to cause myocardial depression or an induction of arrhythmias due to inhibition of conduction of the action potential as seen with Class I antiarrhythmic agents. Class III agents increase myocardial refractoriness via a prolongation of cardiac action potential duration (APD). Theoretically, prolongation of the cardiac action potential can be achieved by enhancing inward currents (i.e. Na+ or Ca2+ currents; hereinafter INa and ICa, respectively) or by reducing outward repolarizing potassium K+ currents. The delayed rectifier (IK) K+ current is the main outward current involved in the overall repolarization process during the action potential plateau, whereas the transient outward (Ito) and inward rectifier (TKI) K+ currents are responsible for the rapid initial and terminal phases of repolarization, respectively. Cellular electrophysiologic studies have demonstrated that IK consists of two pharmacologically and kinetically distinct K+ current subtypes, IKr (rapidly activating and deactivating) and IKs (slowly activating and deactivating). (Sanguinetti and Jurkiewicz, “Two components of cardiac delayed rectifier K+ current. Differential sensitivity to block by Class III anti-arrhythmic agents,” J Gen Physiol 96:195-215 (1990)). IKr is also the product of the human ether-a-go-go gene (hERG). Expression of hERG cDNA in cell lines leads to production of the hERG current which is almost identical to IKr (Curran et al., “A molecular basis for cardiac arrhythmia: hERG mutations cause long QT syndrome,” Cell 80(5):795-803 (1995)). Class III anti-arrhythmic agents currently in development, including d-sotalol, dofetilide (UK-68,798), almokalant (H234/09), E-4031 and methanesulfonamide-N-[1′-6-cyano-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-2-naphthalenyl)-3,4-dihydro-4-hydroxyspiro[2H-1-benzopyran-2,4′-piperidin]-6yl], (+)-, monochloride (MK-499) predominantly, if not exclusively, block IKr. Although, amiodarone is a blocker of IKs (Balser J. R. Bennett, P. B., Hondeghem, L. M. and Roden, D. M. “Suppression of time-dependent outward current in guinea pig ventricular myocytes: Actions of quinidine and amiodarone,” Circ. Res. 69:519-529 (1991)), it also blocks INa and ICa, effects thyroid function, is as a nonspecific adrenergic blocker, acts as an inhibitor of the enzyme phospholipase, and causes pulmonary fibrosis (Nademanee, K. “The Amiodarone Odessey”. J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 20:1063-1065 (1992)). Reentrant excitation (reentry) has been shown to be a prominent mechanism underlying supraventricular arrhythmias in man. Reentrant excitation requires a critical balance between slow conduction velocity and sufficiently brief refractory periods to allow for the initiation and maintenance of multiple reentry circuits to coexist simultaneously and sustain AF. Increasing myocardial refractoriness by prolonging APD, prevents and/or terminates reentrant arrhythmias. Most selective, Class III antiarrhythmic agents currently in development, such as d-sotalol and dofetilide predominantly, if not exclusively, block IKr, the rapidly activating component of IK found both in atrium and ventricle in man. Since these IKr blockers increase APD and refractoriness both in atria and ventricle without affecting conduction per se, theoretically they represent potential useful agents for the treatment of arrhythmias like AF and VF. These agents have a liability in that they have an enhanced risk of proarrhythmia at slow heart rates. For example, torsade de pointes, a specific type of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia which is commonly associated with excessive prolongation of the electrocardigraphic QT interval, hence termed “acquired long QT syndrome,” has been observed when these compounds are utilized (Roden, D. M. “Current Status of Class III Antiarrhythmic Drug Therapy,” Am J. Cardiol, 72:44B-49B (1993)). The exaggerated effect at slow heart rates has been termed “reverse frequency-dependence” and is in contrast to frequency-independent or frequency-dependent actions. (Hondeghem, L. M., “Development of Class III Antiarrhythmic Agents,” J. Cardiovasc. Cardiol. 20 (Suppl. 2):S17-S22). The pro-arrhythmic tendency led to suspension of the SWORD trial when d-sotalol had a higher mortality than placebo controls. The slowly activating component of the delayed rectifier (IKs) potentially overcomes some of the limitations of IKr blockers associated with ventricular arrhythmias. Because of its slow activation kinetics, however, the role of IKs in atrial repolarization may be limited due to the relatively short APD of the atrium. Consequently, although IKs blockers may provide distinct advantage in the case of ventricular arrhythmias, their ability to affect supra-ventricular tachyarrhythmias (SVT) is considered to be minimal. Another major defect or limitation of most currently available Class III anti-arrhythmic agents is that their effect increases or becomes more manifest at or during bradycardia or slow heart rates, and this contributes to their potential for proarrhythmia. On the other hand, during tachycardia or the conditions for which these agents or drugs are intended and most needed, they lose most of their effect. This loss or diminishment of effect at fast heart rates has been termed “reverse use-dependence” (Hondeghem and Snyders, “Class III antiarrhythmic agents have a lot of potential but a long way to go: Reduced effectiveness and dangers of reverse use dependence,” Circulation, 81:686-690 (1990); Sadanaga et al., “Clinical evaluation of the use-dependent QRS prolongation and the reverse use-dependent QT prolongation of class III anti-arrhythmic agents and their value in predicting efficacy,” Amer. Heart Journal 126:114-121 (1993)), or “reverse rate-dependence” (Bretano, “Rate dependence of class III actions in the heart,” Fundam. Clin. Pharmacol. 7:51-59 (1993); Jurkiewicz and Sanguinetti, “Rate-dependent prolongation of cardiac action potentials by a methanesulfonanilide class III anti-arrhythmic agent: Specific block of rapidly activating delayed rectifier K+ current by dofetilide,” Circ. Res. 72:75-83 (1993)). Thus, an agent that has a use-dependent or rate-dependent profile, opposite that possessed by most current class III anti-arrhythmic agents, should provide not only improved safety but also enhanced efficacy. In view of the problems associated with current anti-arrhythmic agents, there remains a need for an effective treatment of cardiac arrhythmias in mammals with new piperazine compounds and novel formulations comprising at least one piperazine compound and at least one CYP3A4 inhibitor to maintain therapeutic plasma level of vanoxerine. The newly discovered formulations preferably use a minimal number of excipients and use pharmaceutical grade excipients that are inexpensive, readily available, and that facilitate cost-effective manufacture on a commercial scale for the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias. SUMMARY Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide compounds and pharmaceutical compositions for preventing or treating cardiac arrhythmia in mammals, particularly humans. In accordance with these and other objects, a first embodiment of the present invention comprises compositions comprising piperazine compounds having the structure: wherein each of R1, R2, and R3 is independently a hydrogen atom or a hydroxyl group, provided that not all of R1, R2 and R3 are the same, and further provided that R1 and R2 are not both a hydroxyl group and that R2 and R3 are not both a hydroxyl group, in combination with at least one P450 inhibitor.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS All references cited herein are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. As used herein, the term “about” is intended to encompass a range of values±10% of the specified value(s). For example, the phrase “about 20” is intended to encompass ±10% of 20, i.e. from 18 to 22, inclusive. As used herein “a piperazine compound” and variations thereof refers to the piperazine compounds having the structure: wherein each of R1, R2, and R3 is independently a hydrogen atom or a hydroxyl group, provided that not all of R1, R2 and R3 are the same, and further provided that R1 and R2 are not both a hydroxyl group and that R2 and R3 are not both a hydroxyl group.

As used herein, the term “subject” refers to a warm blooded animal such as a mammal, preferably a human or a human child, which is afflicted with, or has the potential to be afflicted with one or more diseases and conditions described herein. As used herein, “therapeutically effective amount” refers to an amount which is effective in reducing, eliminating, treating, preventing or controlling the symptoms of the herein-described diseases and conditions. The term “controlling” is intended to refer to all processes wherein there may be a slowing, interrupting, arresting, or stopping of the progression of the diseases and conditions described herein, but does not necessarily indicate a total elimination of all disease and condition symptoms, and is intended to include prophylactic treatment. As used herein, “unit dose” means a single dose which is capable of being administered to a subject, and which can be readily handled and packaged, remaining as a physically and chemically stable unit dose comprising either a piperazine compound or a pharmaceutically acceptable composition comprising a piperazine compound. As used herein, “CYP3A4” means the cytochrome P450 3A4 protein, which is a monooxygenase that is known for its involvement in drug metabolism. As used herein, “CYP2C8” means the cytochrome P450 2C8 protein. As used herein, “CYP2E1” means the cytochrome P450 2E1 protein. As used herein, “P450” means cytochrome P450 superfamily, which a diverse group of enzymes facilitating oxidation of organics within the body. As used herein, “inhibitor” is typically used with P450 inhibitor, meaning a compound that works as a substrate inhibitor and inhibits the production of the particular P450 protein. Preferred embodiments include pharmaceutical compositions of at least one piperazine compound and at least one CYP3A4 inhibitor, with one or more excipients, such as those pharmaceutically acceptable diluents, disintegrants, binders and lubricants known and available to those skilled in the art. Preferably, the excipients meet the standards of the National Formulary (“NF”) and/or United States Pharmacopoeia (“USP”). In a particular preferred embodiment, there is provided a pharmaceutical composition comprising at least one piperazine compound with one or more diluents, disintegrants, binders and/or lubricants. Vanoxerine and other piperazine compounds, like many pharmaceutical compounds are susceptible to metabolism by P450's including CYP3A4, CYP2C8, and CYP2E1, among other known P450 cytochromes. Certain advantages exist by eliminating first pass metabolism by enzymatic catalysts and increasing the bioavailability with regard to a given dose of the piperazine compound. Accordingly, the bioavailability of a given dose of a piperazine compound can be increased by blocking and/or having a P450 antagonist to prevent the metabolism of the piperazine compound before it has the ability to act on its intended target. This provides for either purely increased bioavailability per a given dose, or the opportunity to minimize a dose of the piperazine compound and still provide an efficacious dose of the drug compound. One suitable P450 inhibitor includes grapefruit juice and/or other citrus juices. Studies have shown that grapefruit juice, taken in conjunction with certain medications, significantly increases the bioavailability of the drug as it acts as an inhibitor on the metabolism of the CYP3A4 enzyme to prevent the metabolism of the drug compound. Studies have shown that 6′,7′-dihydroxybergamottin, a furanocoumarin, may be responsible for the inhibition of the CYP3A4 enzyme, in particular. See Edwards, Clinical Pharma & Thera. 65:237-244, 1999. However, other studies have postulated that it is the grapefruit flavonoids, furanocoumarins and/or related compounds from grapefruit that provide the P450 inhibition properties, and that the effect may be seen from more than one component as found in the grapefruit juice. See Ho and Saville, J. Pharm Pharmaceut. Sci. 4(3):217-227, 2001. There are other suitable compounds that also show P450 inhibitory properties. For example, ritonavir, an antiretroviral drug originally used to treat HIV infection, has shown to inhibit CYP3A4, among other known P450's when in use as a concomitant therapy. The drug is now sporadically used for antiviral activity, but is administered for its use as a concomitant inhibitor of certain cytochrome P450 isoforms, including CYP3A4. Dexamethasone is another drug that is known to have certain P450 activity, and its concomitant use may be utilized to inhibit the CYP3A4 enzyme, among others, to prevent the initial breakdown of a piperazine compound indicated herein. Similarly, erythromycin, a macrolide antibiotic with a wide antimicrobial spectrum is known to be taken concomitantly with certain statin drugs where the statin has an increased activity. Concomitant use of erythromycin with a piperazine compound provides for a mechanism to increase the bioavailability of the piperazine compound, where the erythromycin serves as a CYP3A4 antagonist allowing for the increased bioavailability of the piperazine compound. Accordingly, use of the grapefruit or other citrus juice, flavonoids, furanocoumarins, ritonavir, dexamethasone, and or erythromycin and combinations thereof, being used in combination with a piperazine compound, can serve to provide for increased bioavailability of a piperazine compound and serve to maintain pre-determined plasma levels of a piperazine compound. Suitable methods for the use of a composition comprising a piperazine compound and a P450 inhibitor include combination therapies, taking a piperazine compound and independently taking a P450 inhibitor, formulating a drug product comprising both a piperazine compound and a P450 inhibitor. Accordingly, the use of the concomitant therapy is used to modify the effects of a piperazine compound where such compound is given in an effective amount to impact certain conditions having dopaminergic activity. In certain preferred embodiments, the composition comprises a piperazine compound; a P450 inhibitor; a diluent such as lactose; a binder such as microcrystalline cellulose; a disintegrant such as croscarmellose sodium; a flowing agent such as colloidal silicon dioxide; and a lubricant such as magnesium stearate. In certain preferred embodiments, the composition comprises a piperazine compound; a P450 inhibitor selected from the group consisting of CYP3A4, CYP3C8, CYP3E1, and combinations thereof; a diluent such as lactose; a binder such as microcrystalline cellulose; a disintegrant such as croscarmellose sodium; a flowing agent such as colloidal silicon dioxide; and a lubricant such as magnesium stearate. Furthermore suitable compositions may comprise a piperazine compound, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and a P450 inhibitor. The combination of a piperazine compound and the active compound(s) making up the P450 inhibitor may be combined into a single dose form, i.e. a single composition administered as a single drug, or are given in two doses, a piperazine compound and a P450 inhibitor. The excipients are selected to ensure the delivery of a consistent amount of a piperazine compound and to maintain plasma levels of the piperazine compound through the co-administration of the P450 inhibitor, in a convenient unit dosage form and to optimize the cost, ease and reliability of the manufacturing process. All excipients must be inert, organoleptically acceptable, and compatible with a piperazine compound. The excipients used in a solid oral formulation commonly include fillers or diluents, binders, disintegrants, lubricants, antiadherents, glidants, wetting and surface active agents, colors and pigments, flavoring agents, sweeteners, adsorbents, and taste-maskers. Diluents are typically added to a small amount of the active drug to increase the size of the tablet. A suitable diluent for use in the inventive compositions is lactose, which exists in two isomeric forms, alpha-lactose or beta-lactose, and can be either crystalline or amorphous. Various types of lactose include spray dried lactose monohydrate (such as Super-Tab™), alpha-lactose monohydrate (such as Fast Flo®), anhydrous alpha-lactose, anhydrous beta-lactose, and agglomerated lactose. Other diluents include sugars, such as compressible sugar NF, dextrose excipient NF, and dextrates NF. A preferred diluent is lactose monohydrate (such as Fast Flo®). Other preferred diluents include microcrystalline cellulose (such as Avicel® PH, and Ceolus™) and microfine cellulose (such as Elcema®). Suitable diluents also include starch and starch derivatives. Starches include native starches obtained from wheat, corn, rice and potatoes. Other starches include pregelatinized starch NF, and sodium starch glycolate NF. Starches and starch derivatives can also function as disintegrants. Other diluents include inorganic salts, including, but not limited to, dibasic calcium phosphate USP (such as Di-Tab® and Emcompress®), tribasic calcium phosphate NF (such as Tri-Tab® and Tri-Cafos®), and calcium sulfate NF (such as Compactrol®). Polyols such as mannitol, sorbitol, and xylitol may also serve as diluents. Many diluents can also function both as disintegrants and as binders, and these additional properties should be taken into account when developing particular formulations. Disintegrants may be included to break larger particles, such as tablets, granules, beads, nonpareils and/or dragees, into smaller particles comprising the active pharmaceutical ingredient and, optionally, other excipients which may facilitate dissolution of the active ingredient and/or enhance bioavailability of the active ingredient. Starch and starch derivatives, including cross-linked sodium salt of a carboxymethyl ether of starch (such as sodium starch glycolate NF, Explotab®, and Primogel®) are useful disintegrants. A preferred disintegrant is cross-linked sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (such as Croscarmellose Sodium NF, Ac-Di-Sol®). Other suitable disintegrants include, but are not limited to, cross-linked polyvinylpyrrolidone (such as Crospovidone NF) and microcrystalline cellulose (such as Avicel® PH). Binders may also be used as an excipient, particularly during wet granulation processes, to agglomerate the active pharmaceutical ingredient and the other excipients. In all formulation, whether prepared by wet or dry granulation, a particular binder is generally selected to improve powder flow and/or to improve compactibility. Suitable binders include, but are not limited to, cellulose derivatives, such as microcrystalline cellulose NF, methylcellulose USP, carboxymethycellulose sodium USP, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose USP, hydroxyethyl cellulose NF, and hydroxypropyl cellulose NF. Other suitable binders include polyvidone, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, gelatin NF, natural gums (such as acacia, tragacanth, guar, and pectin), starch paste, pregelatinized starch NF, sucrose NF, corn syrup, polyethylene glycols, sodium alginate, ammonium calcium alginate, magnesium aluminum silicate and polyethylene glycols. Lubricants may be used, particularly in tablet formulations, to prevent sticking of the ingredients and/or dosage form to the punch faces and to reduce friction during the compression stages. Suitable lubricants include, but are not limited to, vegetable oils (such as corn oil), mineral oils, polyethylene glycols (such as PEG-4000 and PEG-6000), salts of stearic acid (such as calcium stearate and sodium stearyl fumarate), mineral salts (such as talc), inorganic salts (such as sodium chloride), organic salts (such as sodium benzoate, sodium acetate, and sodium oleate) and polyvinyl alcohols. A preferred lubricant is magnesium stearate. In preferred embodiments, a piperazine compound generally comprises from about 20-50% by weight of the pharmaceutical composition, more preferably from about 25-40% and most preferably from about 30-35%. In preferred embodiments, a P450 inhibitor generally comprises from about 1-50% by weight of the pharmaceutical composition, more preferably from about 1-20% and from about 1-10% by weight when formulated in a solid oral formulation or liquid capsule, or the like. The P450 inhibitor may also be taken as a separate dose in a separate dosage form, such as a volume of citrus juice taken concomitantly with a solid oral dosage form of a piperazine compound. Such amounts include about 1-16 ounces of a juice, more preferably about 2-8 ounces and most preferably about 4-8 ounces of juice. Preferably, the inventive composition also comprises a diluent which is lactose monohydrate, a binder which is microcrystalline cellulose; a disintegrant which is a cross-linked sodium carboxymethyl cellulose; a flowing agent which is colloidal silicon dioxide, and a lubricant which is magnesium stearate. Suitable amounts of each excipient may be determined empirically by one skilled in the art considering such factors as the particular mode of administration (e.g. oral, sublingual, buccal, etc.), amount of active ingredient (e.g. 50 mg, 60 mg, 80 mg, 100 mg, 150 mg, etc.), particular patient (e.g. adult human, human child, etc.) and dosing regimen (e.g. once a day, twice a day, etc.). In certain preferred embodiments, the inventive compositions may contain lactose monohydrate (e.g. Fast Flo® #316) from about 30-60% of the composition by weight, more preferably from about 35-50% and most preferably from about 40-45%. In certain preferred embodiments, the inventive compositions may contain microcrystalline cellulose (e.g. Avicel® PH 102) from about 5-30% by weight of the composition, more preferably from about 10-25% and most preferably from about 15-20% by weight. In certain preferred embodiments, the inventive compositions may contain cross-linked sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (e.g. Ac-Di-Sol®) from about 0.1-10% by weight of the composition, more preferably from about 0.5-5% and most preferably from about 1-3% by weight. In certain preferred embodiments, the inventive compositions may contain colloidal silicon dioxide (e.g. Aerosil® A-200) from about 0.02 to about 1% by weight of the composition, more preferably form about 0.1 to about 0.6% and most preferably from about 0.2-0.4% by weight. In certain preferred embodiments, the inventive compositions may contain magnesium stearate from about 0.02 to about 1% by weight of the composition, more preferably form about 0.1 to about 0.6% and most preferably from about 0.2-0.4% by weight. Solid dosage forms of a piperazine compound can be prepared using any of the methods and techniques known and available to those skilled in the art. For example, a solid dosage form of a piperazine compound and a CYP3A4 inhibitor can be prepared by wet mixing a piperazine compound, a CYP3A4 inhibitor, and excipients with water, drying and milling the granulated mixture. In certain embodiments, the final mixture is compressed into a tablet. In other embodiments, the final mixture is encapsulated. In particular, the process comprises the steps of: (a) dry blending of a piperazine compound, a P450 inhibitor, and one or more excipients to form a dry mixture; (b) wetting the dry mixture with water, preferably with purified water, to form a wet granulation mixture; (c) drying the wet granulation mixture to form a dried granulation mixture; (d) milling the dried granulation mixture to form a milled granulation mixture; (e) mixing a lubricant in the milled granulation mixture to give a final blended mixture; (f) preparing the final blended mixture in a solid dosage form suitable for oral administration. In certain preferred embodiments, the final blended mixture is compressed into tablets. In other preferred embodiments, the final blended mixture is enclosed in a capsule. Specifically, in step (a), a piperazine compound and the P450 inhibitor are blended with all excipients in the final formulation, other than the lubricant. In particular, a piperazine compound and the P450 inhibitor are thoroughly dry blended with the diluent(s), disintegrant(s) and binder to form a uniform dry mixture. Blenders appropriate for large scale dry blending include twin shell blenders, double cone blenders, and ribbon blenders. Ribbon blenders have the advantage of being used in continuous-production procedures. High-speed, high shear mixers may also be used and offer the advantage of shorter mixing times. The dry mixture may also be granulated, milled into a fine powder, passed through a mesh screen, or micronized, if necessary. Preferably, the dry blending was performed in high shear granulators. The resulting dry mixture is then wetted with a wetting agent to form a wet granulation mixture in step (b). The wetting agent is typically added over time, usually from about 1 to about 15 minutes, with continuous mixing. Typically, the wetting agent is added to the blender used in the dry blending step. Preferably the wet granulation is carried out in a high shear granulator. In certain embodiments, the wetting agent is an aqueous-based solution. Preferably, the wetting agent is water without any additional solvents, and in particular, without organic solvents. More preferably, the water is purified water. The type and amount of wetting agent, rate of addition of wetting agent, and the mixing time influences the structure of the granules. The different types of granules, such as pendular, funicular, capillary, etc., can be manipulated to achieve the desired density, porosity, texture and dissolution pattern of the granules, which in turn, determines the compressibility, hardness, disintegration and consolidation characteristics of the dried mixture. The wet granulation mixture is then dried in step (c) to form a dried granulation mixture with an appropriate moisture content. In certain embodiments, the drying means include a fluid bed or tray dryers. Fluid bed drying yield shorter drying times, in the range from 1 to 3 hours, while tray drying averages 10 to 13 hours. Preferably, the wet granulation mixture is dried in a fluid bed, for preferably about 1-3 hours. Fluid bed drying has the added advantages of better temperature control and decreased costs. The method of drying, drying time, and moisture content are critical to avoid decomposition, chemical migration, and other adverse physical characteristics of dried mixture which can affect the dosage form performance. The dried granulation mixture is subsequently milled in step (d) to form a milled granulation mixture. The particle size of the dried granulation mixture is reduced to achieve an appropriate particle size distribution for the subsequent processes. In certain embodiments, milling is achieved using a high shear impact mill (such as Fitzpatrick) or a low shear screening mill (such as Comil). The dried granulation mixture may also be screened to select the desired granule size. In the next step (e), the lubricant was blended with the dried granulation mixture to give a final blended mixture. In certain embodiments, a V blender or bin blenders are used. A preferred blender is a V-shell PK blender. A gentle blending is preferred, such that each granule covered with the lubricant, while minimizing the breaking up of the granules. Increased breaking of the granules results in fine powder, or “fines”. A high fine content results in variations of weight and density during compression into a tablet, as well as increases the need for cleaning of the compression machinery. The final blended mixture is then prepared in a solid dosage form suitable for oral administration. Solid dosage forms include tablets, capsules, pills, troches, cachets, and the like. In one embodiment, the final blended mixture is compressed into a tablet. The compression machinery typically contains two steel punches within a steel die cavity. The tablet is formed when pressure is exerted on the dried granulation mixture by the punches in the cavity, or cell. Tableting machines include single-punch machines, rotary tablet machines, gravity feed, and powder assisted machines. Preferably, gravity feed or powder assisted machines are used. Rotary machines operating at high speeds suitable for large-scale production include double rotary machines and single rotary machines. Tablets can also include sugar-coated tablets, film-coated tablets, enteric-coated tablets, multiple-compressed tablets, controlled-release tablets, tablets for solution, effervescent tablets or buccal and sublingual tablets. Compressed tablets may be characterized by a number of specifications, including diameter size, shape, thickness, weight, hardness, friability, disintegration time, and dissolution characteristics. The tablets preferably have weights, friability and dissolution rates in accordance with USP standards. In other embodiments, the final blended mixture is enclosed in capsules, preferably hard gelatin capsules. The hard gelatin capsules are commercially available, and are generally made from gelatin, colorants, optionally an opacifying agent such as titanium dioxide, and typically contain 12-16% water. The hard capsules can be prepared by filling the longer end of the capsule with the final blended mixture, and slipping a cap over the top using mG2, Zanasi, or Hofliger and Karg (H&K) machines. In an alternative embodiment, the present invention provides for a process of preparing a solid dose form of a piperazine compound and a P450 inhibitor by dry mixing a piperazine compound and the P450 inhibitor with the excipients. In certain embodiments, the mixture is compressed into a tablet. In other embodiments, the mixture is encapsulated. In particular, the process comprises the steps of: (a) dry blending of a piperazine compound, a P450 inhibitor and one or more excipients to form a dry mixture; (b) mixing a lubricant in the dry mixture to give a final blended mixture; (c) preparing the final blended mixture in a solid dosage form suitable for oral administration. In certain preferred embodiments, the final blended mixture is compressed into tablets. In other preferred embodiments, the final blended mixture is enclosed in a capsule. Specifically, in step (a), a piperazine compound and a P450 inhibitor are blended with all excipients in the final formulation, other than the lubricant. Preferably, a piperazine compound and the P450 inhibitor are thoroughly dry blended with the diluent(s), disintegrant(s) and a binder to form a uniform dry mixture. Blenders appropriate for large scale dry blending include twin shell blenders, double cone blenders, V blenders or bin blenders. A preferred blender is a V-shell PK blender. High-speed, high shear mixers may also be used. The dry mixture may also be granulated, milled into a fine powder, passed through a mesh screen, or micronized, if necessary. In the next step (b), the lubricant was blended with the dry mixture to give a final blended mixture. In certain embodiments, a V blender or bin blenders are used. A preferred blender is a V-shell PK blender. The final blended mixture is then prepared in a solid dosage form suitable for oral administration. Solid dosage forms include tablets, capsules, pills, troches, cachets, and the like. In one embodiment, the final blended mixture is compressed into a tablet. In another embodiment, the final blended mixture is enclosed in capsules, preferably hard gelatin capsules. Other aspects of the invention also include use of these compositions for the treatment of a disease or disorder in a subject in need thereof comprising administering to the subject a therapeutically effective amount of the compositions of the present invention. In particular, the present compositions are useful in the treatment of cocaine addiction, acute effects of cocaine, cocaine cravings, Parkinsonism, acromegaly, hyperprolactinemia and diseases arising from a hypofunction of the dopaminergic system, and cardiac arrhythmia. Other aspects of the invention also include the use of these compositions in a method for maintaining a pre-determined plasma level of a piperazine compound comprising ingesting a piperazine compound and a P450 inhibitor. The P450 inhibitor and a piperazine compound may be taken as a single dosage form, or taken as separate dosage forms, such as a solid dose of a piperazine compound and a separate liquid P450 inhibitor.
