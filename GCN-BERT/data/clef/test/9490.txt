Step 7. tert-Butyl 4-bromo-3-fluoro-5-methylbenzyl(methyl)carbamate
To a solution of 1-(4-bromo-3-fluoro-5-methylphenyl)-N-methylmethanamine (1.32 g, 5.67 mmol) and triethylamine (1.58 mL, 11.34 mmol) in THF (18.9 mL) was added di-tert-butyl dicarbonate (1.58 mL, 6.80 mmol). The reaction mixture was then stirred at ambient temperature for 1 hour. The reaction mixture was then diluted with water and extracted with ethyl acetate. The combined organic layers were then dried with magnesium sulfate and concentrated under reduced pressure. The crude product was purified by Biotage Isoleraâ„¢ (1.42 g, 78%).
