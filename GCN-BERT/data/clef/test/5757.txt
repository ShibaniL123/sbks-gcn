The first step The synthesis of Compound 87
To a solution of Compound 86 (460mg, 1.084mmol) in DMF (4.6mL) were added pota ssium carbonate (300mg, 2.167mmol) and methyl iodide (60µL, 2.167mmol), and the mi xture was stirred at 60 °C for 20 minutes. Methyl iodide (60µL, 2.167mmol) was adde d thereto, and the mixture was stirred for 20 minutes at 60 °C. The reaction mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate after addition of water. The organic layer was washed with water and saturated brine successively, and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulf ate. The solvent was concentrated under reduced pressure, the resulting residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (hexane-ethyl acetate) to yield Compound 87 (433 mg, yield 91%).
