Be it known that I I". Bait is burteok, a citizen of the United States of America, and a resident of Lewiston, in the county of Uez Peroe and State of Idaho, have inyented new and use improvements, in "HUMIBIKaBS" for which I have obtained a Patent in the United States of imeriea. Patent Eo.l,395,778, dated Bov. 1, 1921, do hereby declare that the following is a full, olaar and exact descrip¬ tion of the same» This invention related to improvements in humidifiers, an object of the invention being to î-rovide a humidifier which may be usaft in an ordinary cigar box ana which will impart the same «mount of moisture to all of the cigars in the box. A further object is to provide an humidifieyWherein the moist absorbent material used is in direct contact with all of the cigars in the box and to provide a humidifier with a reservoi* therein which supplies moisture to the absorbent material. Another object is to provide a device of this, type which may be manufactured and sold at relatively small cost. With these and other objects in view, the invention con¬ sists in certain novel features of construction and combinations and arrangements of parts which will be more fully hereinafter described and pointed out in the claims. In the accompanying drawings— Figure 1 is a view in transverse section through a box of cigars showing my improved humidifier positioned in the box; and Pig. 2 is a perspective view of the humidifier with parts broken away. 1 represents a sheet or plate of metal having its side adges 2 turneô. inv/arôly and its lower edge 3 turned upwardly, forming a holder. The ends of the upturned lower edge are sol¬ dered to the ends of the aid.e edges, as shown at 4, thus form¬ ing a trough 5. A sheet of asbestos or similar absorbent materialj'is inserted through the open side of the holder thus formed, and preferably at its lower edge located just below the edge of the trough 5. Part of the trough wall is broken away in Pig. E to show the position of the asbestos 6 in the trough. A laterally offset tapering water inlet 7 is formed in the metal back of the holder so that water may be inserted behind the asbeatos sheet 6 ana enter the trough 5. Fig. 1 shows my improved humidifier in position in the cigar bo» 8. ïhe ends of the cigars 9 rest against the asbes¬ tos sheet or pad 6 so that the cigars absorb moisture directly from the pad, and as every cigar in the box touches the pad they will all absorb an equal amount of moisture. Pig. 1 also shows a trough 5 and water inlet passage 7 filled with water 10, so that the pad 6 will be kept moist by capillary attraction. The humidifier may be made to conform to any siza or shape of cigar box and, obviously i£s use need not necessa¬ rily be limited to humidifying cigars but the device mftUr be utilized in any of the various receptacles which require hu- midifiars* While I have illustrated one of the preferred em¬ bodiments of my invention, it is apparent that various slight changea and alterations might be made in the general form of tho parts desoribed without departing from my invention and hence, I do not limit myself to the precise details sat forth but consider mysslf at liberty to make such slight changes and alterations as fairly fall within the spirit and scope of the appended claims. < - "t. . » I CLAIM: 1. A humidifier comprising a sheet havintt its side edges turned inwardly and its lower edge turned upwardly forming a holder, the ends of the lower upturned efige teing soldered to the side edges forming a trough, an absorbent pad fit¬ ting snugly between the side edges and the tack of the holder and having its lower edge located in the trough. 2. A humidifier comprising a sheet having its side edges turned inwardly and its lower edge turned upwardly forming a holder, the ends of the lower upturned edge being soldered to the side edge» foiming a trough, an absorbent pad fitting snugly between the side edges and the back of the holder and spaced from the bottom of the trough, and s»ia plate having a laterally offset tapering water inlet formed therein for the introduotion of water into the trough.
