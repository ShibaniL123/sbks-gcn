(2S,3S,4S,5S)-3-tert-butyl-4-(5-tert-butyl-2-methoxy-benzylamino)-5-(2-isopropyl-phenyl)-pyrrolidine-1,2-dicarboxylic acid 2-ethyl ester 1-isopropyl ester
To a stirred solution of (2S,3S,4S,5S)-3-tert-butyl-4-(5-tert-butyl-2-methoxy-benzylamino)-5-(2-isopropyl-phenyl)-pyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid ethyl ester (45 mg, 0.08 mmol, 1.0 eq) and triethylamine (22 μL, 0.16 mmol, 2.0 eq) in dichloromethane (2 mL) was added at room temperature isopropyl chloroformate (CAS#108-23-6, 90 μL, 0.09 mmol, 1.1 eq). The reaction mixture was stirred for 1 hour, then washed with water and the organic phase was concentrated to dryness. The residue was purified by flash chromatography (heptane/ethyl acetate 100/0 to 85/15) to give the title compound (52 mg, 100%); LC/MS (ESI+) m/z 596.0 (M+H)+.
