Field of the Invention. The present invention relates to enclosures and particularly enclosures suitable for use as raised garden beds and the like. Background Art. Enclosures of many types are conventionally available. In the context of the present invention which will normally be used on a domestic basis and outside a building, an enclosure can be used as a garden bed or pen for animals. The enclosure could be used indoors in certain situations. In this context, enclosures of this type are typically assembled or erected by the home owner who normally has little experience and quite often does not have access to expensive tools for assembly. Still further, whilst there may be a variety of enclosures available that can be used for these purposes, they are generally difficult to assembly, require more than one person to assemble or require the use of fasteners or tools. One type of enclosure is disclosed in United States Patent number 7303358. This enclosure includes a plurality of support posts spaced from one another with each support post having at least one engagement section defining an elongate channel. At least one wall is provided that is substantially impervious to liquid and is supported to extend between a pair of support posts. Each of the walls is formed with a pair of opposed engagement slots which slightly engage with respective flanges on the support posts. An alternative type of enclosure is disclosed in United States Patent number 5901526. This document discloses a landscape timber connecting system. A number of brackets are provided that are shaped to engage in the end of a piece of landscape timber and which also includes the ability to hinge to adjust the angle provided between the landscape timbers. Another type of enclosure is known from US2005/0144859 A1 wherein a modular pet enclosure is disclosed. It will be clearly understood that, if a prior art publication is referred to herein, this reference does not constitute an admission that the publication forms part of the common general knowledge in the art in Australia or in any other country. Summary of the Invention. The present invention is directed to an enclosure and method of forming same, which may at least partially overcome at least one of the abovementioned disadvantages or provide the consumer with a useful or commercial choice. Therefore, it is an object of the invention to provide an enclosure that was robust enough for use outside and in taxing circumstances as well as being simple to construct, with a small number of components and without the need for tools, fasteners or expertise. With the foregoing in view, the present invention in one form, resides broadly in an enclosure including at least one elongate, substantially planar wall member and at least one post member having at least one edge channel, each at least one wall member having an edge which fits into at least one edge channel, the edge of the wall member having a plurality of spaced apart projections which extend from each side of the wall member, the edge channel having a pair of spaced apart, substantially parallel flanges between which the edge of a wall member is received and an abutment shoulder on at least one of the substantially parallel flanges in order to engage the projections on the wall member to allow passage thereof in a first direction but prevent passage in a second, opposite direction. The first direction will typically be orthogonal to the height of the post as will the second direction. The wall member and post can also be moved relative to one another in both directions parallel to the height of the post, by sliding. The enclosure of the present invention can be easily and economically mass produced, packaged and distributed. The preferred embodiment typically includes only two (or three if an end cap is included) different components that can be easily assembled or disassembled, without the need for tools, fasteners or a high level of expertise. The enclosure of the present invention will preferably be modular. It is particularly preferred that the enclosure could be capable of packaging in what has come to be known as a "flat pack" with assembly by the user required. Although the components of the present invention can typically be assembled by sliding the wall member relative to the edge channel, and/or a snapfit assembly with both physical and audible feedback of the engagement. Generally, the wall members will run between spaced apart posts. The wall members may overlap with one another but this will typically be limited to a vertical overlap rather than a horizontal overlap in order to eliminate the use of fasteners between wall members. The components of the present invention allow formation of a variety of different shapes for example rectangular, triangular or an enclosure having more than four sides. The enclosure may also be circular with one wall member and one post being provided. The enclosure of the present invention is not intended to be limited by the use to which it is put. Generally, the enclosure of the present invention is for use in an outside environment such as for storage, as a garden bed, pet enclosure or the like but could be used inside in certain situations. The wall members of the enclosure of the present invention are not required to be of the same dimension. For example, the height of some of the wall panels may be greater than that of others in order to offer shade, function as a windbreak or to provide privacy in a particular direction. The enclosure of the present invention may be sold with accessories (or the accessories may be sold separately and simply used with the enclosure). Accessories can be used to attach to wall panels or to posts in order to support shade cloth, workbenches, or for tool storage or the like as examples only. More than one enclosure can be used together. The enclosures may simply be placed to abut one another but more than one enclosure can also be connected together. For example, one or more post members can be used to attach a wall member defining one enclosure and one or more additional walls to define part of a second (or more) enclosure. In this way, multiple enclosures can be formed together increasing the stability and functionality of all enclosures. The height of any one or more enclosure can be increased by placing one enclosure on top of another. Post members of greater height can be used in order to form an increased height enclosure or alternatively post members may be offset over the height of the enclosure. In this embodiment, the wall members may be partially overlapped vertically. The enclosure of the present invention includes at least one elongate, substantially planar wall member. Each at least one wall member preferably has an end edge which is received into at least one edge channel on the at least one post member. The end edge of the wall member preferably has a plurality of spaced apart projections which extend from at least one, and typically each, side of the wall member. The wall members may be panel members. Typically, the wall members are substantially planar. The term "substantially planar" does not require that the wall members be flat and includes corrugated wall members which typically provide enhanced strength. The wall members or panel members will typically be generally rectangular with a pair of end edges and a top and bottom edge. Typically, the end edges will be at least partially received into the edge channel in the post member. The panel member can be a continuous panel member such as a steel sheet. The steel sheet is usually profiled or corrugated to provide strength and rigidity. The steel sheet can be treated to prevent corrosion and can be painted, profiled, and the like. Any profile may be used. Typically, the wall members will be either roll formed or extruded. Other materials may be used to form the wall panels such as aluminium, plastic, fibreglass or timber as examples. The panel can comprise a non-continuous panel and this could include wire grid panels, panels with openings in them, or perforated panels. The panel can comprise one or more sheets and can include double thickness panels, triple thickness panels, strengthened panels, and the like. Panels can have varying sizes and shapes and vary in thickness and profile depending on the use of the panel. The edges of the wall panels will preferably have a safety edge provided. Typically, the safety edge will be provided to the top and bottom edges. The end edges are normally received into the edge channel, and therefore, a safety edge is not normally provided on these edges. Forming a safety edge typically involves folding of the edge of the wall panel back on itself to leave an arcuate fold exposed. For an edge of the panel member where it is desired to attach an edge channel, there is provided a plurality of spaced apart projections. As mentioned above, this will typically be on or adjacent the end edges of the wall panel although, capping may be provided on the top and/or bottom edges and therefore, these edges may also include a plurality of spaced apart projections. In one form, these projections comprise lugs which can be punched out from the panel member. Other types of projections are also envisaged but punched out lugs at this stage are considered to be the most convenient and cost-effective way to form the projections. The projections are spaced apart and the distance between projections, the size of the projections, the shape of the projections, can be varied to suit the type of attachment required. That is, if the attachment is meant to be very secure, more projections than usual can be used. Alternatively, the size of the projections can be increased to provide a better locking action. It is preferred that projections extend from each side of the panel member such that the panel member can lock to each side of the edge channel which can provide a more secure locking action. To improve the locking strength between the edge channel and the panel member, it is preferred that the plurality of spaced apart projections on the panel member are spaced somewhat from the edge of the panel member. That is, the more metal there is between the projection and the edge of the panel member, the lower will be the chance of the projections becoming torn away. The enclosure of the present invention also includes at least one post member having at least one each channel. Each edge channel has a pair of spaced apart, substantially parallel flanges between which the edge of a wall member is received and an abutment shoulder on at least one of the substantially parallel flanges in order to engage the projections on the wall member to allow passage thereof in a first direction but prevent passage in a second, opposite direction. It can clearly be seen that the wall member can be slidingly engaged with the edge channel and/or a snapfit engagement could be used. The post member of the present invention is typically elongate with a constant cross-section over its length/height. An extrusion process is preferred for forming the post member. The post member can be formed from any material including metal, but a plastic, particularly an impact modified, UV stabilised plastic is preferred. A particularly preferred plastic is unplasticised polyvinylchloride (uPVC) also known as rigid PVC. The post member may be provided with an end cap and/or a foot. Where provided, the end cap or foot will preferably be a push fit component with a portion adapted to be received in the or each edge channel in order to retain the end cap or foot relative to the post. The end cap or foot will preferably be manufactured from plastic. A friction or interference fit is preferred in order to allow for the end cap or foot to be removed relatively easily from the post member. Typically, each post member will include at least a pair of edge channels. The edge channels may be at any angle relative to one another with the angle between the edge channels chosen in order to provide walls or partitions at particular angles relative to one another to form the enclosure or partitions within the enclosure. For example, a post may be provided with three edge channels approximately 60° apart, four each channels approximately 90° apart, three edge channels 90° apart, two edge channels 180° apart, two each channels 150° apart, two edge channels 120° apart or two edge channels at 90° apart. A typical channel shape is one which is substantially U-shaped having a pair of spaced apart substantially parallel side flanges and a connecting member (this can be a bottom wall or top wall or edge wall depending on how the channel is used). The channel length, cross-section size and thickness can vary to suit and the channel can also be coated or otherwise treated to prevent corrosion (dependent on material used) or provide a decorative appearance. The channel can be provided with drainage slots or apertures, if desired. The ends of the side flanges may be tapered in order to guide the wall or panel member thereinto. The edge channel has at least one abutment shoulder against which the projections on the panel member can lock. The at least one abutment shoulder can comprise a return lip on the periphery of at least one and preferably both of the side walls of the edge channel. The return lip can be readily roll-formed or otherwise formed into the edge channel. It is possible for the edge channel to contain a separate projection which can be attached by spot-welding, adhesives or fasteners. This separate projection can be installed at the factory, if desired. To provide a secure locking action, the abutment shoulder may be or include a projection on each side wall of the edge channel such that the panel member can be locked against both side walls of the edge channel. The projection in the edge channel will need to be correspondingly positioned to allow it to engage with the projections on the panel member. For this reason, it is preferred that the projections on the edge channel are adjacent the outer most portion of the edge channel which in turn allows the projections on the panel member to be somewhat spaced from the edge of the panel member. Alternatively, the edge channel may have a receiving opening on each side wall of edge channel such that the projections or protrusions of the wall panel can be at least partially received therein. In a particular form, the receiving opening may be substantially U-shaped and extend perpendicularly to be playing of the wall member. In this configuration, one wall of the U-shaped receiving opening will typically form the abutment shoulder. Movement of the wall panel laterally into the opening between the flanges is possible with some small temporary deformation of either the projections on the wall member or the flanges of the edge channel required to allow the projections to pass. Once the projections are aligned with the receiving openings, the deformation typically ceases allowing the natural bias of the materials used to prevent removal of the projections from the receiving openings in a lateral direction. The wall panel can be removed from the post member by sliding the wall panel or the post upwardly or downwardly relative to one another. Stop means may also be provided within the edge channel in order to prevent insertion of the wall member into the edge channel too far. In order to allow the edge channel and the panel member to push-lock together, it is preferred that the edge channel has a degree of resiliency to allow it to expand somewhat to accommodate the projections. Alternatively, the projections can have a degree of resiliency and it is envisaged that in a further alternative both the edge channel and the panel member can be resilient to some extent. The wall member can be inserted into the edge channel in any direction, for example horizontally, vertically or at an angle thereto with one end of the post engaging the wall member initially and working towards the other end. The enclosure of the present invention can also include one or more partitions. In general, partitions are simply wall members which extend within the enclosure between one or more of the side walls and any other side wall or another point within the enclosure. Typically, partitions and their location are defined by one or more posts. Any number of partitions and any configuration of partitions that may be useful can be created. Using different combinations of posts can form different shapes not only of the enclosure itself, but also the partitions within an enclosure. Using the posts described above, it is clear that one or more partitioning walls can be provided within an enclosure to divide the volume of the enclosure into different segregated areas. For example, a post may be provided with three edge channels approximately 60° apart, for each channels approximately 90° apart, three edge channels 90° apart, to edge channels 180° apart, to each channels 150° apart, to edge channels 120° apart or to edge channels at 90° apart. These allow partitioning wall members to be provided within the enclosure. Any of the features described herein can be combined in any combination with any one or more of the other features described herein within the scope of the invention.

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiment. According to a particularly preferred embodiment of the present invention, an enclosure 10 is provided. The enclosure 10 of the preferred embodiment is formed from a number of elongate, substantially planar wall members 11 and a number of post members 12, each having at least two edge channels 13 into which an edge of a wall member 11 can be inserted and retained by a snap fit engagement, a particularly preferred embodiment of which is illustrated in Figure 1. Each of the wall members 11 has a pair of end edges (only one edge illustrated in Figure 1) which fits into an edge channel 13, with the end edges of the wall member 11 having a plurality of projections 14 spaced over the height of the wall 11 and which extend from each side of the wall member 11. The edge channel 13 is defined by a pair of spaced apart, substantially parallel flanges 15 between which the edge of a wall member 11 is received. An abutment shoulder 17 is provided on each of the substantially parallel flanges 15 in order to engage the projections 14 on the wall member 11 to allow passage thereof in a first direction but prevent passage in a second, opposite direction. The first direction will typically be orthogonal to the height of the post as will the second direction. The wall member and post can also be moved relative to one another in both directions parallel to the height of the post, by sliding. The enclosure 10 of the present invention can be easily and economically mass produced, packaged and distributed. Generally, the wall members will run between spaced apart posts. Although the components of the present invention allow formation of a variety of different shapes for example rectangular, triangular or an enclosure having more than four sides, a hexagonal enclosure as illustrated in Figure 9 is preferred. As illustrated in Figures 6A to 6H, more than one enclosure can be used together. The enclosures 10 may simply be placed to abut one another but more than one enclosure can also be connected together. For example, one or more post-members 12 can be used to attach not only a wall member defining one enclosure 10 but also to define part of a second (or more) enclosure. In this way, multiple enclosures can be formed together increasing the stability and functionality of all enclosures. The enclosure of the present invention includes at least one elongate, substantially planar wall member 11. Each wall member 11 preferably has an end edge which is received into an edge channel 13 on a post member 12. As illustrated particularly in Figure 3, the wall member 11 is a continuous panel member such as a steel sheet. The steel sheet is usually profiled or corrugated to provide strength and rigidity. The steel sheet can be treated to prevent corrosion and can be painted, profiled, and the like. Any profile may be used. Typically, the wall members will be either roll formed or extruded. On an edge of the panel member where it is desired to attach an edge channel, there is provided a plurality of spaced apart projections. As mentioned above, this will typically be adjacent the end edges of the wall panel. In the preferred form, these projections comprise lugs which can be punched out from the panel member. It is preferred that projections 14 extend from each side of the wall member 11 as illustrated in Figure 1 such that the wall member 11 can lock to each side of the edge channel 14 which can provide a more secure locking action. To improve the locking strength between the edge channel 13 and the wall member 11, it is preferred that the plurality of spaced apart projections 14 on the wall member are spaced somewhat from the edge of the panel member as illustrated in Figure 1. That is, the more metal there is between the projection and the edge of the panel member, the less will be the chance of the projections becoming torn away. On the top and bottom edges of the wall member, a safety edge 50 may be provided, one preferred form of which is illustrated in Figure 3A. This safety edge 50 is formed by bending the edge of the wall member 11 over on itself to form a teardrop shaped edge which will preferably minimise injury. The wall members 11 may be overlapped as illustrated in Figure 4. It can clearly be seen that the wall member 11 can be slidingly engaged with the edge channel 13 and/or a snapfit engagement may be used. The post member can be formed from any material, but a plastic, particularly an impact modified, UV stabilised plastic is preferred. A particularly preferred plastic is unplasticised polyvinylchloride (uPVC) also known as rigid PVC. The edge channels 13 may be at any angle relative to one another with the angle between the edge channels 13 chosen in order to provide walls or partitions at particular angles relative to one another to form the enclosure. For example, a post 12 may be provided with two edge channels 90° apart (also illustrated in Figure 5B) three edge channels 13 approximately 60° apart (also illustrated in Figure 5C), four edge channels approximately 90° apart, three edge channels 90° apart (also illustrated in Figure 5A), two edge channels 180° apart (also illustrated in Figures 5E and 5F), two each channels 150° apart, two edge channels 120° apart (also illustrated in Figure 5D) or two edge channels at 90° apart as are illustrated in Figure 8. A typical channel shape is one which is substantially U-shaped having a pair of spaced apart substantially parallel side flanges 15 and a connecting member 20 (this can be a bottom wall or top wall or edge wall depending on how the channel is used and there may be more than one as illustrated in Figure 5E). The channel length, cross-section size and thickness can vary to suit and the channel can also be coloured, coated or otherwise treated to prevent corrosion (if metal) or provide a decorative appearance. The channel can be provided with drainage slots or apertures, if desired. The free ends 16 of the side flanges 15 may be tapered in order to guide the wall member 11 thereinto. The edge channel 13 has an abutment shoulder 17 against which the projections 14 on the panel member can lock. According to the illustrated embodiment, each edge channel 13 has a receiving opening 18 on each flange 15 forming the edge channel 13 such that the projections 14 of the wall panel 11 can be at least partially received therein. In the particular form illustrated in Figures 1 and 2, the receiving opening 18 is substantially U-shaped and extends perpendicularly to the plane of the wall member 11. In this configuration, one wall of the U-shaped receiving opening 18 forms the abutment shoulder 17. Movement of the wall panel 11 laterally into the channel 13 between the flanges 15 is possible with some small temporary deformation of either the protrusions 14 on the wall member 11 or the flanges 15 of the edge channel 13 required to allow the protrusions 14 to pass. Once the protrusions 14 are aligned with the receiving openings 18, the deformation ceases allowing the natural bias of the materials used to prevent removal of the protrusions 14 from the receiving openings 18 in a lateral direction. The wall panel 11 can be removed from the post member 12 by sliding the wall panel 11 or the post 12 upwardly or downwardly relative to one another. A stop member 19 is also be provided within the edge channel 13 in order to prevent insertion of the wall member 11 into the edge channel 13 too far. In order to allow the edge channel and the panel member to push-lock together, it is preferred that the edge channel has a degree of resiliency to allow it to expand somewhat to accommodate the projections. Alternatively, the projections can have a degree of resiliency and it is envisaged that in a further alternative both the edge channel and the panel member can be resilient to some extent. During assembly, the wall member 11 can be inserted into the edge channel 13 in any direction, for example horizontally, vertically or at an angle thereto with one end of the post 12 engaging the wall member 11 initially and working towards the other end. The enclosure of the present invention can also include one or more partitions 21 as illustrated in Figures 7A to 7D. In general, partitions 21 are simply wall members which extend within the enclosure 10 between one or more of the side walls and any other side wall or another point within the enclosure. The partitions illustrated, particularly in Figure 7C and 7D may be a single wall but preferably, a central post is provided to which the partition wall members are attached. Typically, partitions and their location are defined by one or more posts. Any number of partitions and any configuration of partitions that may be useful can be created. Using different combinations of posts conform different shapes not only of the enclosure themselves, but also the partitions within enclosure. Using the posts described above, it is clear that one or more partitioning walls can be provided within enclosure to divide the volume of the enclosure into different segregated areas. For example, a post may be provided with three edge channels approximately 60° apart, for each channels approximately 90° apart, three edge channels 90° apart, to edge channels 180° apart, to each channels 150° apart, to edge channels 120° apart or to edge channels at 90° apart. These allow partitioning wall members to be provided within the enclosure. Summarizing, herein an enclosure is disclosed including at least one elongate, substantially planar wall member and at least one post member having at least one each channel, each at least one wall member having an edge which fits into at least one edge channel, the edge of the wall member having a plurality of spaced apart projections which extend from each side of the wall member, the edge channel having a pair of spaced apart, substantially parallel flanges between which the edge of a wall member is received and an abutment shoulder on at least one of the substantially parallel flanges in order to engage the projections on the wall member to allow passage thereof in a first direction but prevent passage in a second, opposite direction. In the present specification and claims (if any), the word "comprising" and its derivatives including "comprises" and "comprise" include each of the stated integers but does not exclude the inclusion of one or more further integers. Reference throughout this specification to "one embodiment" or "an embodiment" means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the present invention. Thus, the appearance of the phrases "in one embodiment" or "in an embodiment" in various places throughout this specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment. Furthermore, the particular features, structures, or characteristics may be combined in any suitable manner in one or more combinations. In compliance with the statute, the invention has been described in language more or less specific to structural or methodical features.
