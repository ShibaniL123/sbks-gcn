FIELD OF INVENTION The invention provides a lubricating composition containing a co-polymer comprising units derived from monomers (i) an α-olefin and (ii) an ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid or derivatives thereof esterified and amidated with an alcohol and an aromatic amine respectively, and an oil of lubricating viscosity. The invention further relates to the use of the lubricating composition in an internal combustion engine. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Engine manufacturers have focused on improving engine design in order to minimise emissions of particulates and pollutants, and improve cleanliness and fuel economy. One of the improvements in engine design is the use of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) engines. Heavy duty diesel vehicles may use exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) engines in efforts to reduce environmental emissions. Whilst improvements in engine design and operation have contributed to reducing emissions, some engine design advances are believed to have generated other challenges for the lubricant. For example, EGR is believed to have led to increased formation and/or accumulation of soot and sludge. Among the consequences of recirculating the exhaust gas through the engine are different soot structures and increased viscosity of the oil at lower soot levels, compared with engines without EGR. Increased soot-mediated oil thickening is common in heavy duty diesel engines. Some diesel engines employ EGR. The soot formed in an EGR engine has different structures and causes increased viscosity of engine lubricant at lower soot levels than formation of soot in the engine without an EGR. Viscosity improvers are often used to reduce the extent of the decrease in viscosity as the temperature is raised or to reduce the extent of the increase in viscosity as the temperature is lowered, or both. Thus, a viscosity improver ameliorates the change of viscosity of an oil containing it with changes in temperature. Dispersant viscosity modifiers (DVMs) made from ethylene-propylene copolymers that have been radically grafted with maleic anhydride and reacted with various amines have shown desirable performance to prevent oil thickening in diesel engines. Aromatic amines are said to show good performance in this regard. DVMs of this type are disclosed in, for instance, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,863,623, 5,264,139, 5,264,140, 5,620,486, 6,107,257, 6,107,258, and 6,117,825. U.S. Pat. No. 5,409,623 discloses functionalized graft copolymers as viscosity index improvers, comprising an ethylene alpha-monoolefin copolymer grafted with an ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid material and derivatized with an azo-containing aromatic amine compound. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,264,139 and 5,264,140 disclose polymers derivatized with a sulphonyl-containing aromatic amine and an amide-containing aromatic amine material, respectively. Other dispersant viscosity modifiers have been contemplated in a variety of applications including U.S. patent application Ser. Nos. 11/568,051 and 61/118,012; and International Application WO publication WO 2010/014655 A1. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/568,051 discloses soot dispersants derived from esterified maleic anhydride-styrene interpolymers functionalized with nitrogen-containing moieties. International publication WO 2010/014655 A1 discloses alpha olefin maleic anhydride (AOMA) interpolymers which may be esterified and further functionalized with amines having at least one condensable N—H group. International publication WO 2005/103093 discloses an esterified, nitrogen-functionalized interpolymer composition derived from monomers comprising (i) at least one monomer selected from (a) vinyl aromatic monomers and (b) aliphatic olefins containing 2 to about 30 carbon atoms, and (ii) at least one α,β-unsaturated acylating agent, wherein a portion of said acylating agentderived units is esterified, and wherein a portion of said acylating agent-derived units is condensed with at least one aromatic amine containing at least one >N—H group capable of condensing with said acylating agent monomer-derived unit. The interpolymer explicitly disclosed is derivable from monomer units styrene and maleic anhydride. U.S. application 61/118,012 (also relating to International Patent Application WO2010/062842) discloses olefin polymers functionalized by grafting with an unsaturated carboxylic acid material and derivatized with aromatic amines having three or more non-contiguous aromatic groups. Other publications disclose the possibility of dispersants with aromatic groups. U.S. Pat. No. 5,182,041 discloses polyolefin based dispersants functionalized with an ethylenically unsaturated acylating agent and reacted with an amino-aromatic polyamines to produce antioxidant dispersants. U.S. Pat. No. 6,051,537 discloses hydrocarbyl dispersants made from polyolefins functionalized with monounsaturated mono acid materials selected from acrylic acid, methacrylic acid and cinnamic acid reacted with amines, alcohols and/or aminoalcohols. These polyolefins have number average molecular weight in the range 1500 to 5000. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION An objective of the present invention is to provide a lubricating composition capable of providing at least one of (i) a lubricating composition capable of reducing viscosity increase (often having a viscosity of less than 12 mm2/sec (cSt) at 100° C. at a soot loading of 6 weight % or more), and/or (ii) a lubricating oil composition that maintains a relatively stable viscosity over a wide range of temperatures, which could be desirable because viscosity index improvers or DVMs may be employed to control viscosity over a wide temperature range and to control soot, and/or (iii) oxidation control. It may also be desirable if a viscosity index improver were capable of achieving (i) and (ii).

Copolymer The copolymer of the invention may be prepared by the reaction of monomers (i) an α-olefin and (ii) an ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid or derivatives thereof. The α-olefin may be a linear or branched olefin, or mixtures thereof. If the α-olefin is linear, the number of carbon atoms of the α-olefin may range from 2 to 20, or 4 to 16, or 8 to 12. If the α-olefin is branched, the number of carbon atoms of the α-olefin may range from 4 to 32, or 6 to 20, or 8 to 16. Examples of an α-olefin include 1-decene, 1-undecene, 1-dodecene, 1-tridecene, 1-tetradecene, 1-pentadecene, 1-hexadecene, 1-heptadecene 1-octadecene, or mixtures thereof. An example of a useful α-olefin is 1-dodecene. The ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid or derivatives thereof may be an acid or anhydride or derivatives thereof that may be partially esterified. When partially esterified, other functional groups include acids, salts, imides, and amides, or mixtures thereof. Suitable salts include alkali metals, alkaline earth metals or mixtures thereof. The salts include lithium, sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium or mixtures thereof. The unsaturated carboxylic acid or derivatives thereof includes cis-cinnamic acid, trans-cinnamic acid, acrylic acid, methyl acrylate, methacrylic acid, maleic acid or anhydride, fumaric acid, itaconic acid or anhydride or mixtures thereof, or substituted equivalents thereof. Examples of the ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid or derivatives thereof include itaconic anhydride, maleic anhydride, methyl maleic anhydride, ethyl maleic anhydride, dimethyl maleic anhydride, (meth)acrylic acid, or mixtures thereof. In one embodiment the ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid or derivatives thereof includes maleic anhydride or derivatives thereof. The copolymer may be prepared as is described in International publication WO2010/014655 A. For example, the copolymer of the invention prepared by the reaction of monomers (i) an α-olefin and (ii) an ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid or derivatives thereof are described in paragraph [0140] to [0141] of WO2010/014655 A. The copolymer may, in one embodiment, be a copolymer derived from 1-dodecene and maleic anhydride. Exemplified copolymers include those prepared below. The copolymer may also be prepared by processes similar to those described in International publication WO2005/103093, except the styrene is replaced with the α-olefin. The copolymer may also be obtained/obtainable by a process comprising: (1) reacting monomers (i) an α-olefin and (ii) an ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid or derivatives thereof to form a copolymer;(2) reacting the copolymer of (i) with an alcohol to form an esterified copolymer; and(3) reacting the product of step (2) with an aromatic amine, and optionally a non-aromatic amine, to form a copolymer that is amidated and esterified. The copolymer may also be obtained/obtainable by a process comprising: (1) reacting monomers (i) an α-olefin and (ii) an ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid or derivatives thereof to form a copolymer;(2) reacting the product of step (1) with an aromatic amine and optionally a non-aromatic amine; and(3) reacting the copolymer of step (2) with an alcohol, to form a copolymer that is amidated and esterified. In one embodiment the processes above process further comprise reacting a non-aromatic amine in step (3) and (2) respectively, or optionally after step (3) in either case. In one embodiment the aromatic amine (and optionally non-aromatic amine) is present in an amount sufficient to provide the copolymer of the invention with 0.01 wt % to 2 wt % (or 0.05 wt % to 0.1 wt %, or 0.075 wt % to 0.75 wt %) of nitrogen. In one embodiment the aromatic amine may be present in an amount such that there are 1 mol % to 20 mol %, or 3 mol % to 10 mol % of aromatic amine per unsaturated acid monomers. The polymerisation process to form the product of step (1) may be through solution free-radical polymerisation. The product of step (1) may be formed by processes known in the art. For example the mole ratio of α-olefin and (ii) an ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid or derivatives thereof may be 1:2 to 3:1, or 1:1. Prior to amidation or esterification the copolymer may have a reduced specific viscosity (RSV) of up to 0.15, or up to 0.12, or up to 0.1 or up to 0.08. Examples of RSV ranges may include 0.01 to 0.15, or 0.015 top 0.12, 0.02 to 0.1, or 0.02 to 0.08, or 0.02 to 0.07, 0.03 to 0.07 or 0.04 to 0.06. Typically the RSV ranges described herein are based on the mean of three measurements made on the copolymer. The copolymer may instead of RSV be defined in terms of weight average molecular weight. Typically the weight average molecular weight is measured on the final esterified and amidated copolymer. The weight average molecular weight may be 5000 to 30,000, or 8000 to 21,000. The copolymer reduced specific viscosity (RSV) is measured by the formula RSV=(Relative Viscosity−1)/Concentration, wherein the relative viscosity is determined by measuring, by means of a dilution viscometer, the viscosity of a solution of 1.6 g of the copolymer in 100 cm3 of acetone and the viscosity of acetone at 30° C. A more detailed description of RSV is provided below. The RSV is determined for the copolymer of an α-olefin and (ii) an ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid or derivatives thereof before esterification. Copolymer Backbone Preparation: A copolymer is prepared by reacting in a 3 litre flask 1 mole of maleic anhydride, and Y moles (defined below) of 1-dodecene in the presence of 60 wt % of toluene solvent. The flask is fitted with a flange lid and clip, PTFE stirrer gland, rod and overhead stirrer, thermocouple, nitrogen inlet port and water-cooled condenser. Nitrogen is blown through the flask at 0.028 m3/hr (or 1 SCFH or 28 L/hr). A separate 500 ml flask with a side arm is charged with 0.05 moles of tert-butyl peroxy-2-ethylhexanoate initiator (a commercially available initiator from Akzo Nobel, known as Trigonox®21S), optionally n-dodecyl mercaptan (chain transfer agent, CTA) and additional toluene. A nitrogen line is fitted to the arm and nitrogen is applied at 0.0085 m3/hr (or 0.3 SCFH) for 30 minutes. The 3 litre flask is heated to 105° C. The Trigonox 21S initiator/toluene mixture is pumped from the 500 mL flask into the 3 litre flask via a Masterflex™ pump (flow rate set at 0.8 ml/min) over a period of 5 hours. The contents of the 3 litre flask are stirred for 1 hour before cooling to 95° C. The contents of the 3 litre flask are stirred overnight. Typically a clear colourless gel is obtained. The amount of each reagent is shown in the table below. The copolymers prepared are characterised by RSV method described in the description above. The RSV data is presented in the table.

The esterification reaction of the alcohol with the ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid or derivatives thereof is outlined below. Esterified Copolymer: A linear alcohol and a primary alcohol branched at the β- or higher position. The esterified copolymer is prepared in a flask fitted with a Dean-Stark trap capped with a condenser. An amount of copolymer containing 1 mole of carboxy groups is heated in the flask to 110° C. and stirred for 30 minutes. One mole of alcohol is added. If the amount of the primary alcohol branched at the β- or higher position is greater than one mole, only one mole is added at this point. Conversely if less than one mole of the primary alcohol branched at the β- or higher position is present, sufficient linear alcohol is used to provide a total of one mole equivalent of alcohol. The alcohol is pumped into the flask via peristaltic pump over a period of 35 minutes. Catalytic amounts of methane sulphonic acid along with the remaining moles of alcohol are then pumped into the flask over a period of 5 hours whilst heating to and holding at 145° C. and removing water in the Dean-Stark trap. The reaction temperature is reduced to 135° C., and sufficient butanol is added sequentially to the flask until the total acid number (TAN) is not higher than 4 mg KOH/g. The flask is heated to 150° C. and sufficient sodium hydroxyide is added to quench the methanesulphonic acid. The flask is cooled to ambient temperature resulting in an esterified copolymer. The procedure may employ the materials listed in the table below.

No. 7,407,919). The predominantly linear alkylbenzene sulphonate detergent may be particularly useful for assisting in improving fuel economy. Typically the overbased metal-containing detergent may be a calcium or magnesium overbased detergent. Overbased detergents are known in the art. Overbased materials, otherwise referred to as overbased or superbased salts, are generally single phase, homogeneous Newtonian systems characterized by a metal content in excess of that which would be present for neutralization according to the stoichiometry of the metal and the particular acidic organic compound reacted with the metal. The overbased materials are prepared by reacting an acidic material (typically an inorganic acid or lower carboxylic acid, preferably carbon dioxide) with a mixture comprising an acidic organic compound, a reaction medium comprising at least one inert, organic solvent (mineral oil, naphtha, toluene, xylene, etc.) for said acidic organic material, a stoichiometric excess of a metal base, and a promoter such as a phenol or alcohol. The acidic organic material will normally have a sufficient number of carbon atoms to provide a degree of solubility in oil. The amount of excess metal is commonly expressed in terms of metal ratio. The term “metal ratio” is the ratio of the total equivalents of the metal to the equivalents of the acidic organic compound. A neutral metal salt has a metal ratio of one. A salt having 4.5 times as much metal as present in a normal salt will have metal excess of 3.5 equivalents, or a ratio of 4.5. The term “metal ratio is also explained in standard textbook entitled “Chemistry and Technology of Lubricants”, Second Edition, Edited by R. M. Mortier and S. T. Orszulik, Copyright 1997.

The hindered phenol antioxidant often contains a secondary butyl and/or a tertiary butyl group as a sterically hindering group. The phenol group may be further substituted with a hydrocarbyl group (typically linear or branched alkyl) and/or a bridging group linking to a second aromatic group. Examples of suitable hindered phenol antioxidants include 2,6-di-tert-butylphenol, 4-methyl-2,6-di-tert-butylphenol, 4-ethyl-2,6-di-tert-butylphenol, 4-propyl-2,6-di-tert-butylphenol or 4-butyl-2,6-di-tert-butylphenol, or 4-dodecyl-2,6-di-tert-butylphenol. In one embodiment the hindered phenol antioxidant may be an ester and may include, e.g., Irganox™ L-135 from Ciba.

The following examples provide illustrations of the invention. These examples are non-exhaustive and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention. EXAMPLES Preparative Example 1 (EX1) 1611 g of Esc10 (as described above) is charged into a 3 L flask with a catalytic amount of methane sulphonic acid. The flask is fitted with a flange lid and clip, PTFE stirrer gland, rod and overhead stirrer, thermocouple with Eurotherm™ heating system, nitrogen inlet and a Dean and Stark trap capped with a condenser. Nitrogen was applied 472 cm3 min−1 (or about 1 SCFH) and the flask was heated to 150° C. with stirring at 310 rpm. Butanol (37.6 g) is charged subsurface and stirred for 2 hours. Further butanol (37.6 g) is charged to the flask subsurface and the mixture is stirred for 2 hours. Further butanol was charged (37 g) and the flask is maintained at 150° C. A sodium hydroxide solution (40.6 mol % NaOH in H2O) is added to quench the methane sulphonic acid and stirred for one hour. 4-aminodiphenylamine is added in an amount to deliver to the final copolymer 0.1 wt % of nitrogen. The flask was then cooled to 105° C. The resultant copolymer is then vacuum distilled using a water-cooled condenser, vacuum receiver adapter and 1 L receiving flask. Vacuum is applied and the temperature was increased to 150° C. and held for 3.5 hours. The flask is then cooled to 100° C., vacuum removed and the product is filtered twice through a FAX5 filter. The resultant product is a brown viscous liquid. Preparative Example 2 (EX2) is similar to EX1, except 4-aminodiphenylamine and 4-(3-aminopropyl)morpholine are both added in an amount sufficient to provide 0.68 wt % of nitrogen to the copolymer. It is known that some of the materials described above may interact in the final formulation, so that the components of the final formulation may be different from those that are initially added. The products formed thereby, including the products formed upon employing lubricant composition of the present invention in its intended use, may not be susceptible of easy description. Nevertheless, all such modifications and reaction products are included within the scope of the present invention; the present invention encompasses lubricant composition prepared by admixing the components described above. Each of the documents referred to above is incorporated herein by reference. Except in the Examples, or where otherwise explicitly indicated, all numerical quantities in this description specifying amounts of materials, reaction conditions, molecular weights, number of carbon atoms, and the like, are to be understood as modified by the word “about.” It is to be understood that the upper and lower amount, range, and ratio limits set forth herein may be independently combined. Similarly, the ranges and amounts for each element of the invention may be used together with ranges or amounts for any of the other elements. As used herein, the term “hydrocarbyl substituent” or “hydrocarbyl group” is used in its ordinary sense, which is well-known to those skilled in the art. Specifically, it refers to a group having a carbon atom directly attached to the remainder of the molecule and having predominantly hydrocarbon character. Examples of hydrocarbyl groups include: hydrocarbon substituents, including aliphatic, alicyclic, and aromatic substituents; substituted hydrocarbon substituents, that is, substituents containing non-hydrocarbon groups which, in the context of this invention, do not alter the predominantly hydrocarbon nature of the substituent; and hetero substituents, that is, substituents which similarly have a predominantly hydrocarbon character but contain other than carbon in a ring or chain. A more detailed definition of the term “hydrocarbyl substituent” or “hydrocarbyl group” is described in paragraphs [0118] to [0119] of International Publication WO2008147704. While the invention has been explained in relation to its preferred embodiments, it is to be understood that various modifications thereof will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon reading the specification.
