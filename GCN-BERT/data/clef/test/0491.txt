A solution of isopentyl 9-fluorenone-4-carboxylate (1.2607 g, 4.28 mmol) as obtained above, malononitrile (0.8488 g, 12.85 mmol), and 1 drop of morpholine in 15 mL methanol was magnetically stirred and refluxed in a 50-mL round-bottomed flask for 24 h. After cooling to room temperature, the solid precipitate was filtered, washed twice with methanol, once with water, and dried in vacuo at 50° C. for 10 h. The crude product was recrystallized from acetone and methanol to yield [4-iso-pentoxycarbonyl-9-fluorenylidene]malononitrile (VIII) as an orange solid, m.p., 126 ˜127° C. (1.31 g, 89.3%).
