CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application is a continuation of copending U.S. patent application Ser.

STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY-SPONSORED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT Not applicable. LATIN NAME OF THE GENUS AND SPECIES OF THE PLANT CLAIMED Rhododendron obtusum. CULTIVAR DENOMINATION Stewla#1. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a new and distinct cultivar of Azalea, botanically known as Rhododendron obtusum, hereinafter referred to as ‘Stewla#1.’ Stewla#1 is an evergreen greenhouse-forcing type Azalea and may be used for outside landscape planting. The new Azalea was discovered by the inventor in Charlottesville, Va. in a controlled, landscape planting of Delaware Valley White Azaleas in 1974. The exact parentage of Stewla#1 is unknown. Compared to plants of the white, single-flowered commercial cultivar ‘Delaware Valley White’ that is not patented, the new Azalea has white hose-in-hose flowers borne in trusses with some yellow-green flecking in the throat of the petals and green-yellow emerging buds. Asexual reproduction of the new Azalea by hardwood, semi-hardwood and softwood vegetative cuttings taken in a controlled environment in Charlottesville, Va. since 1975 and in Wooster, Ohio since 1998 have shown that the unique features of this new Azalea are stable and reproduced true to type in successive generations. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The following traits have been repeatedly observed and are determined to be the most outstanding and distinguishing characteristics of ‘Stewla#1.’ These traits distinguish ‘Stewla#1’ as a new and distinct cultivar: 1. Globe to broad columnar plant form. 2. Freely branching habit. 3. Terminal truss flower arrangement. 4. Pure white hose-in-hose flowers with some yellow-green flecking in the throat of the petals. 5. Green-yellow flower buds. 6. Subtle fruity scent. 7. Hardy in USDA zone 6a. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS The new Azalea is illustrated by the accompanying photographic prints in which: 1. The photograph on the first sheet displays a view of a typical flowering plant of ‘Stewla#1.’ 2. The photograph on the second sheet displays a close-up view of typical flowers of “Stewla#1.” 3. The photograph on the third sheet displays a close-up view of typical flowers of ‘Stewla#1’ and includes a view of a typical green-yellow flower bud in the lower righthand area of the photograph. Colors in the photographs may differ slightly from the color values cited in the detailed botanical description, which accurately describes the colors of the new Azalea. DETAILED BOTANICAL DESCRIPTION The following observations, measurements, values, and comparisons are based on observations made of a plant found in an established landscape planting in Charlottesville, Va. between 1975 and 2010 and plants asexually reproduced in commercial production practices at Wooster, Ohio between 1998 and 2010. The plant found in an established landscape planting in Charlottesville, Va. was exposed to temperatures ranging from 39.4° C. in 1977 to −23.3° C. in 1994. In the following description, color references are made to The Royal Horticultural Society Colour Chart, 1995 Edition, except where general terms of ordinary dictionary significance are used.
