VARIABLE BOUNCE HEIGHT CLUB HEADS AND RELATED METHODS TECHNICAL FIELD [0001] This disclosure relates generally to sports equipment, and relates more particularly to club heads and related methods. BACKGROUND [0002] The bounce angle of a golf club can impact the flight distance and/or accuracy of the golf ball, but the bounce height (i.e., the rise in the bounce angle) can have an even greater impact on the flight distance and/or accuracy of the golf ball. Specifically, the bounce angle and/or bounce height can determine how easily a golf club head can penetrate the ground under the golf ball during a golf club swing. However, ground conditions are subject to change such that the ground may be harder or softer at certain times due to weather, grooming, etc. Accordingly, a club head with a particular bounce angle and/or bounce height configuration may be better in certain circumstances than in other circumstances.

[0037] First club head body 108 is configured to be coupled (e.g., removably, seamlessly, and/or at different times) with each of first club head attachment members 109. For example, first club head body 108 can be coupled with first club head attachment members 109 at first club head body interface 225 (FIG. 2) and first club head attachment member interfaces 126 (e.g., first club head first attachment member interface 127, first club head second attachment member interface 128, etc.). [0038] First club head body 108 and first club head attachment members 109 can be coupled together by any suitable coupling mechanism(s) (e.g., a fastener, a joint, and or an adhesive, etc.). An exemplary fastener can comprise a screw, a nut and bolt, etc. An exemplary joint can comprise a mortise and tenon joint, a dovetail joint, etc. Further, where multiple coupling mechanisms are implemented, the coupling mechanisms can be the same or different from each other. The apparatus, methods, and articles of manufactured described herein are not limited in this regard. [0039] Further, first club head 101 can comprise an alignment aid. The alignment aid can comprise any pair of a body alignment aid and one of two or more attachment member alignment aids. The alignment aid, the body alignment aid, and/or the attachment member alignment aid(s) can be configured to facilitate coupling together first club head body 108 and first club head attachment members 109. For example, the alignment aid, the body alignment aid, and/or the attachment member alignment aid(s) can operate as a guide for coupling together first club head body 108 and first club head attachment members 109. In many examples, first club head body 108 can comprise the body alignment aid, and/or each of first club head attachment members 109 can comprise one of the attachment member alignment aids. In other examples, the alignment aid can be omitted. In some embodiments, one or more of the coupling mechanism(s) implemented to couple together first club head body 108 and first club head attachment members 109 can comprise the alignment aid. That is, one or more of the coupling mechanism(s) can also facilitate coupling together first club head body 108 and first club head attachment members 109, and/or the alignment aid can also couple together first club head body 108 and first club head attachment members 109. [0040] When the alignment aid is implemented, the alignment aid can comprise any suitable mechanism(s) to facilitate coupling together first club head body 108 and first club head attachment members 109.

[0042] Referring now back to FIG. 1 , in some embodiments, first club head 101 can comprise one or more optional dampening members 147. Dampening member(s) 147 can dampen vibrations between first club head body 108 and first club head attachment members 109, such as, for example, when first club head body 108 and any one of first club head attachment members 109 are coupled together. In some embodiments, first club head body 108 can comprise dampening member 248 (FIG. 2), such as, for example, at first club head body interface 125. hi these or other embodiments, first club head attachment members 109 can each comprise a dampening member, such as, for example, at each of first club head attachment member interfaces 126 (e.g., dampening member 149 at first club head attachment member interface 127, dampening member 150 at first club head attachment member interface 128. In other embodiments, one or more of dampening member(s) 147 can be separate from first club head body 108 and first club head attachment members 109. Accordingly, although FIGs. 1 & 2 illustrate dampening member(s) 147 as being part of first club head body 108 and first club head attachment members 109, in other embodiments, one or more of dampening member(s) 147 (e.g., dampening member 248 (FIG. 2), dampening member 149, and/or dampening member 150) can be separate from first club head body 108 and/or first club head attachment members 109, as applicable. In still other embodiments, one or more of dampening member(s) 147 (e.g., dampening member 248 (FIG. 2), dampening member 149, and/or dampening member 150) can be omitted. Dampening member(s) 147 can comprise any suitable material(s) (e.g., an elastomeric or elastic material, such as, for example, rubber, etc.) configured to dampen vibrations. [0043] Front surface 1 11 can refer to a strike face and/or strike plate of first club head 101, and can be configured to impact a golf ball (not shown). Front surface 1 11 can be substantially planar, and/or can comprise one or more scoring lines (e.g., grooves). The scoring line(s) can extend between toe end 106 and heel end 107. When front surface 111 comprises multiple scoring lines, the scoring lines can be parallel to each other. [0044] Hosel 1 10 can be located at or proximate to heel end 107, and hosel 110 can extend from first club head 101 via a hosel transition portion. Hosel 110 can be configured to receive a shaft (not shown). In a different embodiment, club head 100 can comprise a bore (not shown) configured to receive the shaft. When hosel 1 10 (or the bore) receives the shaft, first club head 101 and the shaft can substantially provide a golf club, as described above. [0045] Skipping ahead in the drawings, FIG. 4 illustrates a heel side view of first club head 101 when first club head body 108 is coupled to first club head attachment member 129, according to the embodiment of FIGs. 1 & 2. [0046] First club head 101 comprises loft plane 433 and ground plane 434. Further, first club head 101 can also comprise leading edge 435, trailing edge 436, ground contact 437, edge line 438, contact line 439, and/or height plane 440. Loft plane 433, ground plane 434, edge plane 438, contact plane 439, and heiglit plane 440 can refer to reference planes of first club head 101 , and leading edge 435, trailing edge 436, and ground contact 437 can refer to reference points of first club head 101. Meanwhile, first club head 101 further comprises loft angle 441, effective bounce angle 442, traditional bounce angle 443, bounce height 444, and sole width 445. [0047] Loft plane 433 intersects the foremost point or points (e.g., nearest front end 104 (FIGs. 1 & 2)) of front surface 11 1 (FIG. 1). In some examples, the foremost point can be leading edge 435. Further, loft plane 433 can be approximately parallel with front surface 111 (FIG. 1) when first club head 101 is positioned both to address a golf ball and in a resting state. When front surface 1 11 (FIG. 1) is planar and/or substantially planar, front surface 1 1 1 and loft plane 433 can be approximately co-planar. Meanwhile, when front surface 11 1 (FIG. 1) is curved (e.g., non-planar), as can frequently be implemented with wood-type club heads, loft plane 433 can refer to a reference plane intersecting an inflection point in the curvature of front surface 11 1. Accordingly, in these embodiments, at least part of front surface 1 1 1 (FIG. 1) can be located behind loft plane 433. [0048] Leading edge 435 can refer to a foremost point of sole surface 213 (FIG. 2) when first club head 101 is positioned both to address a golf ball and in a resting state; trailing edge 436 can refer to a rearmost point of sole surface 213 (FIG. 2) when first club head 101 is positioned both to address a golf ball and in a resting state; and ground contact 437 can refer to a lowest point of sole surface 213 (FIG. 2) when first club head 101 is positioned both to address a golf ball and in a resting state. [0049] Ground plane 434 refers to the plane generally formed by the ground below club head 101 when first club head 101 is positioned to address a golf ball. Ground plane 434 can intersect ground contact 437 when first club head 101 is positioned to address a golf ball. Meanwhile, edge line 438 refers to the line intersecting leading edge 435 and trailing edge 436; and contact line 439 refers to the line intersecting leading edge 435 and ground contact 437. Further, height plane 440 refers to a plane approximately parallel to ground plane 434 and intersecting leading edge 435. [0050] Bounce height 444 can refer to a distance betwreen ground plane 434 and height plane 440. Meanwhile, sole width 445 can refer to a distance between leading edge 435 and trailing edge 436. [0051] Loft angle 441 can refer to an angle formed between loft plane 433 and normal line 446, which refers to a reference line orthogonal to ground plane 434 and intersecting leading edge 435 when first club head 101 is positioned to address a golf ball. Effective bounce angle 442 can refer to an angle formed between edge line 438 and ground plane 434, and traditional bounce angle 443 can refer to an angle formed between contact line 439 and ground plane 434. [0052] First club head 101 can be configured such that loft angle 441, effective bounce angle 442, and/or traditional bounce angle 443 remain constant for first club head 101 while bounce height 444 and/or sole width 445 can be varied for first club head 101 as first club head body 108 is coupled with different ones of first club head attachment members 109. As a result, bounce height 444 and/or sole width 445 can be tailored as desired for first club head 101. That is, first club head 101 can be adjustable so that coupling different ones of first club head attachment members 109 to first club head body 108 can provide differing configurations of bounce height 444 and/or sole width 445. Further, when effective bounce angle 442 and/or traditional bounce angle 443 are held constant, bounce height 444 can be varied as a function of sole width 445, and vice versa. [0053] As a general matter, bounce height (e.g., bounce height 444) can have more impact on how first club head 101 moves through turf than bounce angle (e.g., effective bounce angle 442 and/or traditional bounce angle 443). Increasing bounce height (e.g., bounce height 444) can cause first club head 101 to dig less into the turf while decreasing bounce height can cause first club head 101 to dig more into the turf. Accordingly, for softer ground conditions, it can be desirable to increase bounce height (e.g., bounce height 444), while for harder ground conditions, it can be desirable to decrease bounce height (e.g., bounce height 444). Advantageously, as indicated previously, bounce height 444 and/or sole width 445 of first club head 101 can be adjustable, such as, for example, according to the particular ground conditions before the round of golf begins or during the round of golf. [0054] In some embodiments, loft angle 441 can be greater than or equal to approximately 15 degrees and less than or equal to approximately 65 degrees. In further embodiments, loft angle 441 can be greater than or equal to approximately 47 degrees and less than or equal to approximately 64 degrees, such as, for example, where first club head 101 comprises a wedge- type iron-type golf club head, hi more specific examples, loft angle 441 can be one of approximately 56 degrees or approximately 60 degrees. Effective bounce angle 442 and/or traditional bounce angle 443 can be greater than or equal to approximately 0 degrees or less than or equal to approximately 20 degrees. [0055] In some embodiments, bounce height 444 can be greater than or equal to approximately 0.500 centimeters or less than or equal to approximately 0.635 centimeters. Further, sole width 445 can be greater than or equal to approximately 0.6 centimeters or less than or equal to approximately 3.5 centimeters. The apparatus, methods, and articles of manufacture described herein are not limited in this regard. [0056] In addition to varying bounce height 444 and/or sole width 445, first club head attachment members 109 can also vary by shape, density, weight, and/or mass distribution. By varying the density, weight, and/or mass distribution of first club head attachment member 109, the wreight and mass distribution of first club head 101 can also be varied. In turn, a center of gravity of first club head 101 can be selectively varied, as desired, to selectively alter one or more moment of inertia parameters of first club head 101. [0057] In these embodiments, first club head attachment members 109 can further comprise two or more first club head attachment members providing the same bounce height 444 and/or sole width 445 of first club head 101, but having different density, weight, and/or mass distribution configurations so that the location of the center of gravity of first club head 101 can be selectively varied. For example, first club head attachment members 109 can comprise a first set of two or more first club head attachment members (e.g., first club head first attachment member 129, first club head second attachment member 130, etc.) varying according to bounce height and/or sole width, and a second set of two or more first club head attachment members corresponding to the first set and having the approximately equal bounce heights and/or sole widths to the first set, but varying according to density, weight, and/or mass distribution configuration. [0058] In many examples, first club head body 108 can comprise any suitable material(s), such as, for example, any suitable metal (e.g., aluminum, stainless steel, carbon steel, titanium, magnesium, etc.), any suitable non-metal (e.g., carbon fiber composite, polymer, fiber reinforced polymer, etc.), and/or any suitable alloys thereof. Further, first club head attachment members 109 can also comprise any suitable material(s), such as, for example, any suitable metal (e.g., aluminum, stainless steel, carbon steel, titanium, magnesium, lead, tungsten, gold, silver, etc.), any suitable non-metal (e.g., carbon fiber composite, polymer, fiber reinforced polymer, etc.), and/or any suitable alloys thereof. The first club head body 108 and first club head attachment members 109 can comprise the same or different materials. Further, each of first club head attachment members 109 can comprise the same or different materials. These materials can be varied appropriately to affect the density, weight, and/or mass distributions of first club head attachment members 109. [0059] In other embodiments, first club head 101 can be configured such that loft angle 441 and one or more of effective bounce angle 442, traditional bounce angle 443, bounce height 444, and sole width 445 remain constant for first club head 101 as first club head body 108 is coupled with different ones of first club head attachment members 109. Meanwhile, in these or other embodiments, one or more of effective bounce angle 442, traditional bounce angle 443, bounce height 444, and sole width 445 can be varied for first club head 101 as first club head body 108 is coupled with different ones of first club head attachment members 109. [0060] Meanwhile, as indicated previously, in many embodiments, club head(s) 100 can also comprise one or more additional club heads, such as, for example, second club head 501 (FIGs. 5-7). FIG. 5 illustrates a top, front, heel side view of second club head body 508 of second club head 501 of club head(s) 100 next to second club head attachment members 509 of second club head 501, according to the embodiment of FIGs. 1 , 2, & 4. Meanwhile, FIG. 6 illustrates a bottom, rear, toe side view of second club head body 508 of second club head 501 of club head(s) 100 next to second club head attachment member(s) 509, according to the embodiment of FIGs. 1 , 2, 4, & 5. Further, FIG. 7 illustrates a bottom side view of second club head 501 when second club head body 508 is coupled to second club head attachment member 529, according to the embodiment of FIGs. 1, 2, & 4-6. [0061] In general, second club head 501 can be similar or identical to first club head 101 (FIGs. 1, 2, & 4) and/or club head 301 (FIG. 3). For example, elements of first club head 101 and/or club head 301 and second club head 501 referenced with reference numbers having the same last two digits can be similar or identical to each other. However, second club head 501 can differ in that the loft angle of second club head 501 can be different than the loft angle of one or more other ones of club head(s) 100 (e.g., first club head 101 (FIGs. 1, 2, & 4)). For example, loft angle 441 (FIG. 4) can be less than or greater than loft angle 741 (FIG. 7). Accordingly, club head(s) 100 can each comprise a different loft angle (e.g., loft angle 441 , loft angle 741, etc.). Meanwhile, in some examples, the bounce angle (e.g., effective bounce angles 442 and 742, and/or traditional bounce angles 443 and 743, etc.) can be less than, greater than, or equal from club head to club head within club head(s) 100. In further examples, the bounce height (e.g., bounce height 444 and bounce height 744, etc.) and/or sole width (e.g., sole width 445 and sole width 745, etc.) can be less than, greater than, or equal from club head to club head within club head(s) 100, but can also be variable depending on the club head attachment members (e.g., first club head attachment members 109, second club head attachment members 509, etc.) being used. [0062] Further, in other embodiments, second club head 501 can be configured such that loft angle 741 and one or more of effective bounce angle 742, traditional bounce angle 743, bounce height 744, and sole width 745 remain constant for second club head 501 as second club head body 508 is coupled with different ones of second club head attachment members 509. Meanwhile, in these or other embodiments, one or more of effective bounce angle 742, traditional bounce angle 743, bounce height 744, and sole width 745 can be varied for second club head 501 as second club head body 508 is coupled with different ones of second club head attachment members 509. [0063] Meanwhile, in some embodiments, the club head bodies (e.g., first club head body 108, second club head body 508, etc.) and/or club head attachment members (first club head attachment members 109, second club head attachment members 509, etc.) of each club head of club head(s) 100 can be configured to prevent club head attachment members of one club head (e.g., first club head 101) of club head(s) 100 from being coupled to another club head (e.g., second club head 501) of club head(s) 100. [0064] Advantageously, club head(s) 100 can be implemented to provide the attributes of multiple fixed sole club heads in a single club head. Accordingly, a user of club head(s) 100 need not buy, maintain, and/or carry multiple fixed sole club heads of each loft angle. [0065] FIG. 8 illustrates a flow chart for an embodiment of method 800.
