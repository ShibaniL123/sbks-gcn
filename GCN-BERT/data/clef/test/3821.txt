Cycloalkyl-Linked Diheterocycle Derivatives Field of the Invention The present invention relates to novel cycloalkyl-linked diheterocycle derivatives that are useful in the treatment of abnormal cell growth, such as cancer, in mammals. The present invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions containing the compounds and to methods of using the compounds and compositions in the treatment of abnormal cell growth in mammals. Background of the Invention Tumor cells require nutrients to generate ATP and macromolecules to sustain survival and proliferation. (Ward P.S., et al., "Metabolic Reprogramming: a Cancer Hallmark even Warburg did not Anticipate", Cancer Cell. 21(3) (2012), pp. 297-308.) Glucose and glutamine are two major sources of nutrients that tumor cells depend on. Tumor cells prefer to use glycolysis pathways, even under aerobic conditions, to metabolize glucose to produce lactic acid and ATP, the so-called Warburg's effect. In addition to glucose, many tumor cells are addicted to glutamine ("Gin") for survival (DeBerardinis R.J., et al., "Q's Next: The Diverse Functions of Glutamine in Metabolism, Cell Biology and Cancer", Oncogene. 29(3) (2010), pp. 313-24; Shanware N.P., et al., "Glutamine: Pleiotropic Roles in Tumor Growth and Stress Resistance", J Mol Med (Berl). 89(3) (201 1 ), pp. 229-36.). This amino acid can be metabolized to generate intermediates of tricarboxylic acid cycle for ATP production, as well as building blocks such as lipids and nucleotides to sustain the cell proliferation. Gin metabolism in cancer cells is regulated and cross-talks with multiple oncogenic pathways (Gao P, et al., "c-Myc Suppression of miR-23a/b Enhances Mitochondrial Glutaminase Expression and Glutamine Metabolism", Nature. 458(7239) (2009), pp. 762-5; Duran RV, et al. "Glutaminolysis Activates Rag-mTORC1 Signaling" , Mol Cell. 47(3) (2012), pp. 349-58; Thangavelu K, et al., "Structural Basis for the Allosteric Inhibitory mechanism of Human Kidney-Type Glutaminase (KGA) and its Regulation by Raf-Mek-Erk Signaling in Cancer Cell Metabolism", J. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 109(20) (2012), pp. 7705-10; Son J, et al., "Glutamine supports pancreatic cancer growth through a KRAS-regulated metabolic pathway", 496(7443) Nature. (2013), pp. 101 -5.). (GLS1 ) is an essential enzyme that catalyzes the first step in glutamine metabolism, leading to the generation of glutamate and ammonia. Glutamate is also the critical substrate for glutathione synthesis, which plays important role in redox homeostasis. GLS1 is overexpressed across many tumor types, and myc up-regulates GLS1 protein level through transcriptional repression of miR-23a and miR-23b. Suppression of GLS1 with selective small molecule inhibitors may be valuable to treat different types of cancers (Wise D.R., et al., "Glutamine Addiction: a New Therapeutic Target in Cancer", Trends Biochem Sci. 35(8) 2010, pp.427-33; Shukla K, et al., "Design, Synthesis, and Pharmacological Evaluation of Bis-2-(5-phenylacetamido-1 ,2,4-thiadiazol-2-yl)ethyl sulfide 3 (BPTES) Analogs as Glutaminase Inhibitors", J Med Chem. 55(23) (2012), pp. 10551 -63.). Thus, there is a need for compounds that inhibit GLS1 .

The compounds described herein may also exist in unsolvated and solvated forms. Accordingly, some embodiments relate to the hydrates and solvates of the compounds described herein. Compounds described herein containing one or more asymmetric carbon atoms can exist as two or more stereoisomers. Where a compound described herein contains an alkenyl or alkenylene group, geometric cis/trans (or Z/E) isomers are possible. Where structural isomers are interconvertible via a low energy barrier, tautomeric isomerism ('tautomerism') can occur. This can take the form of proton tautomerism in compounds described herein containing, for example, an imino, keto, or oxime group, or so-called valence tautomerism in compounds which contain an aromatic moiety. A single compound may exhibit more than one type of isomerism. Included within the scope of the present embodiments are all stereoisomers, geometric isomers and tautomeric forms of the compounds described herein, including compounds exhibiting more than one type of isomerism, and mixtures of one or more thereof. Also included are acid addition or base salts wherein the counterion is optically active, for example, d-lactate or l-lysine, or racemic, for example, dl-tartrate or dl- arginine. Cis/trans isomers may be separated by conventional techniques well known to those skilled in the art, for example, chromatography and fractional crystallisation. Conventional techniques for the preparation/isolation of individual enantiomers include chiral synthesis from a suitable optically pure precursor or resolution of the racemate (or the racemate of a salt or derivative) using, for example, chiral high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) or SFC. Alternatively, the racemate (or a racemic precursor) may be reacted with a suitable optically active compound, for example, an alcohol, or, in the case where a compound described herein contains an acidic or basic moiety, a base or acid such as 1 -phenylethylamine or tartaric acid. The resulting diastereomeric mixture may be separated by chromatography and/or fractional crystallization and one or both of the diastereoisomers converted to the corresponding pure enantiomer(s) by means well known to a skilled person. "Abnormal cell growth", as used herein, unless otherwise indicated, refers to cell growth that is independent of normal regulatory mechanisms (e.g., loss of contact inhibition). This includes the abnormal growth of: (1 ) tumor cells (tumors) that proliferate by expressing a mutated tyrosine kinase or overexpression of a receptor tyrosine kinase; (2) benign and malignant cells of other proliferative diseases in which aberrant tyrosine kinase activation occurs; (3) any tumors that proliferate by receptor tyrosine kinases; (4) any tumors that proliferate by aberrant serine/threonine kinase activation; (5) benign and malignant cells of other proliferative diseases in which aberrant serine/threonine kinase activation occurs; (6) any tumors that proliferate by aberrant signaling, metabolic, epigenetic and transcriptional mechanism; and (7) benign and malignant cells of other proliferative diseases in which aberrant signaling, metabolic, epigenetic and transcriptional mechanism. .Further embodiments relate to methods of treating abnormal cell growth in a mammal.

In general, the compounds described herein may be prepared by processes known in the chemical arts, particularly in light of the description contained herein. Certain processes for the manufacture of the compounds described herein are provided as further features of the embodiments and are illustrated in the reaction schemes provided below and in the experimental section. Unless stated otherwise, the variables in Schemes A-H have the same meanings as defined herein. Scheme A: As exemplified in Scheme A, the mono-ester mono-acid A-1 , which may be obtained either from commercial sources, or from selective ester hydrolysis or desymmetrization of symmetrical anhydrides under standard literature conditions (see for example, J. Am. Chem. Soc, 2000, 122, 9542 and Helv. Chim. Acta., 1983, 66, 2501 ), is subjected to selective reduction of the carboxylic acid moiety using a reducing agent such as borane.dimethylsulfide to afford A-2. The alcohol in A-2 may be halogenated to form an alkyl halide such as an iodide or a bromide using reagents such as iodine/triphenylphosphine in the presence of a base such as imidazole or carbon tetrabromide to afford A-3. The coupling partner A-5 is obtained from the acylation of a commercially available 2-amino-6-halogenated heterocycle, A-4, using an acid in the presence of a standard coupling reagent such as HATU or HBTU in the presence of a base such as Hunig's base or triethylamine. The reaction between A-5 and A-3 takes place through a palladium-mediated process such as a Negishi reaction. For example, the halogenated compound A-3 may be activated as an organometallic species such as an organozincate by treatment with species such as zinc dust in the presence of an activating agent such a 1 ,2-dibromoethane and TMSCI in a solvent such as DMF, or without activation by using diethyl zinc for the metallation process.

The ester in A-6 is hydrolyzed by an inorganic base such as lithium hydroxide or sodium hydroxide in a solvent such as methanol and water to afford the carboxylic acid A-7. Condensation of A-7 with thiosemicarbazide in the presence of phosphorus oxychloride as both an activating and dehydrating agent provides the aminothiadiazole A-8.

Acylation of C-1 is carried out under standard conditions such as condensation with acetyl chloride or acetic anhydride in the presence of a base such as triethylamine in a solvent such as DMF to afford C-2. Ester hydrolysis of C-2 is carried out under basic conditions using a base such as NaOH or LiOH in a solvent such as methanol to afford C-3. Condensation of C-3 with hydrazine in the presence of a suitable coupling agent (such as T3P, HBTU or HATU) and a base (such as pyridine, TEA or DIPEA) in a suitable solvent such as DMF affords C-4. Reaction with C-4 with an isothiocyanate in a suitable solvent such as ethyl acetate, THF or methylene chloride affords C-5. Isothiocyanates are either commercially available or may be prepared by direct reaction of an acid chloride with sodium isothiocyanate under conditions, which are well established in the literature. C-5 is cyclized by dehydration under acidic conditions in the presence of a suitable acid such as sulfuric acid to afford C-8. Alternatively, C-3 is condensed with thiosemicarbazide in the presence of a suitable coupling agent (such as HBTU or HATU) and a base (such as TEA or DIPEA) in a suitable solvent such as DMF to afford C-6. C-6 is cyclized by dehydration under acidic conditions in the presence of a suitable acid such as sulfuric acid to afford C-7. Acylation of C-7 either using by reaction with an acid chloride or by using a suitable amide coupling agent (such as T3P, HATU or HBTU) and an appropriate carboxylic acid in the presence of a base such as pyridine, TEA or Hunig's base in a solvent such as DMF or DMA affords C-8. Separation of the enantiomers may be carried out under standard methods known in the art such as chiral SFC or HPLC to afford single enantiomer C-8. Scheme D: D-6 As exemplified in Scheme D, the mono-ester mono-acid (A-1 in Scheme A) is converted into the mono-thiadiazole under standard conditions known in the art such as condensation with thiosemicarbazide in the presence of an activating/dehydrating agent such as phosphorus oxychloride to provide D-1.

D-4 is cyclized by dehydration under acidic conditions in the presence of a suitable acid such as sulfuric acid to afford D-5. Acylation of D-5 is carried out under standard conditions using an acylation agent such as acetic anhydride in a solvent such as acetic acid to afford D-6. Separation of the enantiomers may be carried out under standard methods known in the art such as chiral SFC or HPLC to afford single enantiomer D-6. As exemplified in Scheme E, the cyclic keto-acid E-1 may be either obtained from commercial sources, or prepared by methods, which are established in the literature or reported herein. Reaction of the ketone function with an organophosphorane in the presence of a base such as sodium hydride in a solvent such as THF in a Horner-Wittig-Emmons reaction gives the unsaturated ester, E-2. Reduction of the olefin under hydrogen pressure in the presence of a heterogeneous catalyst such as palladium on carbon or platinum oxide in a solvent such as methanol or dichloromethane gives E-3 as a mixture of diastereomers in which reduction from the less hindered face will be preferred. Condensation of E-3 with thiosemicarbazide in the presence of phosphorus oxychloride as both an activating and dehydrating agent provides the Jb/s-aminothiadiazole E-4. Acylation of E-4 either using by reaction with an acid chloride or by using a suitable amide coupling agent (such as T3P, HATU or HBTU) and an appropriate carboxylic acid in the presence of a base such as pyridine, TEA or Hunig's base in a solvent such as DMF or DMA affords the symmetrically substituted Jb/s-aminothidiazole, E-5. Separation of the diastereomers and enantiomers may be carried out under standard methods known in the art such as flash chromatography, chiral SFC or HPLC to afford a single diastereomer or enantiomer E-5. Scheme F: A-1 F-3 F-2 -N=.=S >1 a F-1 R1a = C C3 alkyl, C3-C6 a cycloalkyl, or 5-6 membered heteroaryl F-6 As exemplified in Scheme F, the mono-ester mono-acid A-1 is condensed with the alkyl or aryl-substituted thiosemicarbazide, F-2, in the presence of phosphorus oxychloride as both an activating and dehydrating agent to provide the alkyl or aryl- substituted aminothiadiazole F-3. The alkyl-substituted thiosemicarbazide F-2 is obtained either from commercial sources or by the action of hydrazine on a commercial alkyl or aryl isothiocyanide, F-1 or by using alternative methods which are well established in the literature (Phosphorus, Sulfur, and Silicon and the Related Elements, 1991 , 60 (1 -2), 15-19). Hydrolysis of the ester F-3 using an inorganic base such as lithium hydroxide or sodium hydroxide in a solvent such as methanol and water gives the carboxylic acid, F-4. Condensation of F-4 with thiosemicarbazide in the presence of phosphorus oxychloride as both an activating and dehydrating agent provides the bis- aminothiadiazole E-5. Acylation of F-5 either using by reaction with an acid chloride or by using a suitable amide coupling agent (such as T3P, HATU or HBTU) and an appropriate carboxylic acid in the presence of a base such as pyridine, TEA or Hunig's base in a solvent such as DMF or DMA affords the symmetrically substituted bis- aminothidiazole, F-6. Separation of the enantiomers may be carried out under standard methods known in the art such as chiral SFC or HPLC to afford single enantiomers of F- 6 Scheme G: G-1 B-1 G-2 As exemplified in Scheme G, the di-acid B-1 may be either obtained from commercial sources, or prepared by methods, which are established in the literature or reported herein. B-1 may be converted to the dihalide G-1 through a decarboxylation- halogenation type sequence typically referred to as a Hunsdiecker reaction, which may take place under photochemical conditions in the presence of a suitable halogen source, such as diiodohydantoin in a solvent such as 1 ,2-dichloroethane. The coupling partner A-5 is obtained from the acylation of a commercially available 2-amino-6- halogenated heterocycle, A-4, using an acid in the presence of a standard coupling reagent such as T3P, HATU or HBTU in the presence of a base such as pyridine, Hunig's base or TEA. The reaction between A-5 and B-1 takes place through a palladium-mediated process such as a Negishi reaction. For example, the di- halogenated compound B-1 may be activated as an organometallic species such as an organozincate by treatment with species such as zinc dust in the presence of an activating agent such a 1 ,2-dibromoethane and TMS-CI in a solvent such as DMF, or without activation by using diethyl zinc for the metallation process. The zincate obtained may be coupled with the halogenated heterocycle A-5 through a Negishi reaction using a palladium catalyst such as Pd2(dba)3 in the presence of a suitable ligand such as tri(o- tolylphoshine) in a solvent such as DMF to afford G-2. If necessary, separation of the enantiomers of G-2 may be carried out under standard methods known in the art such as chiral SFC or HPLC to afford the single enantiomers of G-2. Scheme H: As exemplified in Scheme H, coupling partner A-5 is obtained from the acylation of a commercially available 2-amino-6-halogenated heterocycle, A-4, using an acid in the presence of a standard coupling reagent such as T3P, HATU or HBTU in the presence of a base such as pyridine, Hunig's base or TEA. Vinyl boronate H-1 may be obtained from an established literature procedure involving borylation of the corresponding halogenated α,β-unsaturated cyclic ketone (US 2012/0077814). The reaction between A-5 and H-1 takes place through a palladium-mediated process such as a Suzuki reaction to give H-2. For example, A-5 and H-1 may be reacted together at elevated temperature in the presence of a palladium catalyst, such as Pd(dppf)Cl2 in the presence of suitable base (such as K3P04 or CsF) in a mixed solvent system comprising of an organic solvent (for example, THF, DME or toluene) and water. Reduction of the endocyclic olefin of H-2 under hydrogen pressure in the presence of a heterogeneous catalyst such as palladium on carbon or platinum oxide in a solvent such as methanol or dichloromethane gives H-3. H-3 may be elaborated to H-4 through a Horner-Wittig-Emmons type olefination involving treatment of with a phosphonate reagent such as diethyl(cyanomethyl)phosphonate in the presence of a strong base such as NaH in a suitable solvent (for example, THF). Reduction of the exocyclic olefin of H-4 to give H-5 may be achieved through utilization of a hydride-based reagent. For example, L-Selectride may be employed as the reductant in a solvent such as THF at depressed temperature to provide H-5 as a mixture of diastereomers. Condensation of H-5 with thiosemicarbazide in the presence of an acid such as TFA at elevated temperature provides the aminothiadiazole H-6. Acylation of H-6 either using by reaction with an acid chloride or by using a suitable amide coupling agent (such as T3P, HATU or HBTU) and an appropriate carboxylic acid in the presence of a base such as pyridine, TEA or Hunig's base in a solvent such as DMF or DMA affords H-7. Separation of the diastereomers and enantiomers may be carried out under standard methods known in the art such as chiral SFC or HPLC to afford the single enantiomers of H-7. For some of the steps of the here above described process of preparation of the compounds of the invention, it may be necessary to protect potential reactive functions that are not wished to react, and to cleave said protecting groups in consequence. In such a case, any compatible protecting radical may be used. In particular methods of protection and deprotection such as those described by T.W. Greene (Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, A. Wiley-lnterscience Publication, 1981 ) or by P. J. Kocienski (Protecting groups, Georg Thieme Verlag, 1994), may be used.

Cancer Cell Lysate Total L-Glutamate Assay Cancer cell lines (BT20, HCT1 16, SKOV3, HCC70, SUM149, MDA-MB-231 , etc.) were plated in 96 well plates and were used for the total L-glutamate assay when the monolayer was ca. 80% confluent. The media was changed and fresh media containing L-glutamine was added to the 96 well plates, just before incubation of the cells with test compound. The test compound was diluted in 100% DMSO using a two- fold or three-fold serial dilution. Small volumes of the dilutions of test compound were added to the 96 well plates so the final DMSO concentration was 0.5% v/v in the cell culture medium. The cells were incubated at 37°C, 5% CO2, and 95% air for 2 hours. Following the 2 hour incubation, the cells were washed with water 2 times. After the last water wash, 100 μΙ_ of 50 mM Tris-HCI pH 7.4 and 0.01 % Tween-20 was added to each well and the plate was frozen at -80°C. The 96 well plate was frozen and thawed a total of 3 times and then sonicated for 5 min at 4°C in a bath sonicator. Following sonication, the 96 well plate was centrifuged for 5 min at 1000 rpm and 10 μί of the supernatant was transferred to a 384 well assay plate. Total L-glutamate (L-glutamic acid) in the cell lysis supernatant was detected using glutamate oxidase, horseradish peroxidase and Amplex Red reagent (10-acetyl- 3,7-dihydroxy phenoxazine, Invitrogen # A22177). In this assay, L-glutamate was oxidized by glutamate oxidase to produce alpha-ketoglutarate (2-oxopentane dioic acid), NH3 and H2O2. The H2O2 (hydrogen peroxide) was used by horseradish peroxidase (HRP) to oxidize the Amplex Red Reagent to resorufin which is a fluorescent molecule. When resorufin is excited with light with a wavelength 530-560 nm, it emits light at approximately 585 nm. For detection of total L-glutamate in 10 μί of lysate, 15 μί of an enzyme mixture was added to each well of the 384 well assay plate. The enzyme mixture consisted of 50 mM Tris-HCI pH 7.4, 0.01 % Tween-20, 50 μΜ Amplex Red reagent (final concentration), 0.04U/mL L-glutamate oxidase (final concentration), and 0.125U/mL HRP (final concentration). The 384 well assay plate was incubated at room temperature for 5 min and then the fluorescence intensity of each well was measured at 585 nm using a 530-560 nm excitation wavelength in a plate based fluorimeter such as an LJL Analyst or a Tecan Infinite plate reader. Standard curves were constructed for this assay using dilutions of a L-glutamate standard. IC50 were calculated by plotting the relative fluorescent units vs log of the inhibitor concentration and fitting the data to the four parameter logistic equation. Reference: Chapman J. and Zhou M.
