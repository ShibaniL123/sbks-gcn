TECHNICAL FIELD This disclosure relates to a thiol group-containing polymer. In particular, the disclosure relates to a thiol group-containing polymer useful for polysulfide-based sealants, adhesives and paints having a low specific gravity, a low glass transition temperature, a high heat resistance and improved elastic recovery. BACKGROUND Liquid polysulfide polymers have thiol groups at the terminals, and thus are easily oxidized and cured by an oxidizing agent such as lead dioxide and manganese dioxide. Rubber-like cured products obtained by curing polysulfide polymers contain sulfur in the main chain of the molecule, and do not contain double bonds, and thus have excellent features in oil resistance, weather resistance, water tightness and air tightness, and also have fine adhesibility, and thus are widely used as sealants, adhesives and paints. The most common method of producing a polysulfide polymer is a method of obtaining a liquid polymer through a solid polysulfide described in U.S. Pat. No. 2,466,963. Furthermore, a production method using a phase transfer catalyst has been reported (see U.S. Pat. No. 6,939,941). The thioether described in WO 2009/131796 is a thioether that does not substantially contain polysulfide bonds, and the reference describes that the thioether is formed into a sealant that is excellent in fuel resistance and the like. The polythioether polymer described in WO 1998/039365 is a polythioether that does not contain polysulfide bonds and shows excellent low temperature flexibility and fuel oil resistance when it is cured, and thus is used as a sealant as in conventional polysulfide polymers. A sealant composition that utilizes both of the properties of a polysulfide polymer and a polythioether polymer by blending these polymers is known (see WO 2006/029144). Conventional polysulfide polymers are excellent in oil resistance, weather resistance, stabilities at low temperatures and high temperatures, and the like, and thus are used in various sealants and adhesives. In addition to those properties, especially in sealants for aircraft, further heat resistance, cold resistance and low specific gravity are required. Furthermore, lowering of viscosity is also desired to decrease solvents in sealants. On the other hand, in construction sealants, excellent weather resistance is required, and elastic recovery for following the motion of a joint is required in the case of application for a sealant on movable part. SUMMARY We provide a thiol group-containing polymer having a lower viscosity, a lower specific gravity, a lower glass transition temperature and higher heat resistance than those of conventional polysulfide polymers. Furthermore, we provide a curable composition formed into a sealant, an adhesive or a paint that has a lower specific gravity, a lower glass transition temperature, higher heat resistance, higher elastic recovery and more improved weather resistance than those of curable compositions using conventional polysulfide polymers. In particular, we provide a thiol group-containing polymer represented by the formula: [in-line-formulae]HS—(R—Sr)n—R—SH[/in-line-formulae] wherein R is an organic group including a —O—CH2—O— bond and/or a branched alkylene group, n is an integer of from 1 to 200, r is an integer of from 1 to 5, and the average value of r is 1.1 or more and 1.8 or less. The curable composition is a curable composition comprises the above-mentioned thiol group-containing polymer as a base polymer. The thiol group-containing polymer has a lower specific gravity, a lower viscosity and a lower glass transition temperature, and higher heat resistance compared to those of conventional polysulfide polymers, by decreasing the repeat number of the sulfur in the polysulfide bonds. The curable composition has a low specific gravity, a low viscosity and a low glass transition temperature, and the heat resistance, elastic recovery and weather resistance are improved. The curable composition using the thiol group-containing polymer can be used in sealants, adhesives, paints and the like. DETAILED DESCRIPTION Our polymers and compositions will be explained below in detail. We provide a thiol group-containing polymer represented by the formula: [in-line-formulae]HS—(R—Sr)n—R—SH[/in-line-formulae] wherein R is an organic group including a —O—CH2—O— bond and/or a branched alkylene group, n is an integer of from 1 to 200, r is an integer of from 1 to 5, and the average value of r is 1.1 or more and 1.8 or less. R is preferably an organic group including a —O—CH2—O— bond and a branched alkylene group. The branched alkylene group is preferably from 0 to 70 mol % with respect to the molar number of the —O—CH2—O— bond. R preferably includes 50 mol % or more of —C2H4—O—CH2—O—C2H4—. More preferably, R includes 70 mol % or more of —C2H4—O—CH2—O—C2H4—. The branched alkylene group is preferably a multifunctional component derived from a trihaloorganic compound, and is an organic group represented by Preferable branched trihaloorganic compounds are trihaloalkyl compounds, and more preferable branched trihaloorganic compounds are trihalopropanes. Preferable halogen atoms for the trihalopropanes are chlorine, bromine and iodine, and a more preferable halogen atom is a chlorine atom. The r in the thiol group-containing polymer HS—(R—Sr)n—R—SH is an integer of from 1 to 5, and is preferably an integer of 1 to 3. The average value of r is 1.1 or more and 1.8 or less. When the average value of r is lower than 1.1, the ultraviolet absorbability due to the polysulfide bonds is lowered and, thus, the weather resistance and hardness after curing become poor. When the average value of r exceeds 1.8, significant effects of a low viscosity, a low specific gravity, a low glass transition temperature, high heat resistance and the like cannot be obtained. The preferable range of the average value of r differs depending on the use and purpose for which the polysulfide polymer is used. For example, when a low Tg, a low specific gravity, a low viscosity and heat resistance are required more in use in an aircraft sealant, the average value of r is preferably 1.1 or more and 1.5 or less, and further preferably, when the average value is 1.1 or more and 1.3 or less, the intended effect is high. Even in use in an aircraft sealant, when a low Tg, a low specific gravity and a low viscosity, as well as a high hardness after curing are considered to be important, the average value of r is preferably 1.3 or more and 1.8 or less and, more preferably, when the average value is 1.3 or more and 1.5 or less, the balance among the required performances is good. In use in a construction sealant, when elastic recovery and heat resistance are required more, the average value of r is preferably 1.1 or more and 1.5 or less, and more preferably, when the average value is 1.1 or more and 1.3 or less, the intended effect is high. Even in use in an architectural sealant, when elastic recovery and heat resistance, as well as weather resistance are considered to be important, the average value of r is preferably 1.3 or more and 1.8 or less and, more preferably, when the average value is 1.3 or more and 1.5 or less, the balance among the required performances is good. In the thiol group-containing polymer, n is an integer of from 1 to 200, n is preferably an integer of from 1 to 50, more preferably from 5 to 50.

The sulfur in the thioether described in WO 2009/131796 correspond to only thioether (—S—) bonds, i.e., the average value of r is 1.0, whereas the polymer has an average value r of the sulfur in HS—(R—Sr)n—R—SH of 1.1 or more and 1.8 or less.

The polymers of Nos. 2 to 4 and 7 to 12 are our polymers. When the polymers of Nos. 1 to 5, which had approximately the same SH contents, were compared, the polymers of Examples 1 to 3 and Comparative Example 2, which had the average values of the repeating numbers of sulfur r of 1.8 or less, had lower viscosities, lower glass transition temperatures and lower specific gravities, more increased temperatures of 50% weight loss and better heat resistances than those of the polymer of Comparative Example 1, which had an average value of r of 2.0. Furthermore, when the polymers of Nos. 6 to 10, which had approximately the same SH contents, were compared, the polymers of Examples 5 to 8, which had the average values of the repeating numbers of sulfur r of 1.1 or more and 1.8 or less, had lower viscosities, lower glass transition temperatures and lower specific gravities, more increased temperatures at 50% weight loss and better heat resistances than those of the polymer of Comparative Example 3, which had an average value of r of 2.0. When the polymers having approximately the same SH contents were compared, the polymers having lower average values of r had lower viscosities, and thus when the polymers are to be incorporated as sealants, it is possible to decrease the additional amount of a solvent for ensuring workability.

The obtained sheet was left under an atmosphere at 23° C., 50% RH for 1 hour to remove the heat. The specific gravity, glass transition temperature, temperature of 50% weight loss, elastic recovery, hardness and dumbbell physical characteristic value were measured with the cured product that had been cut out into about 20 mm square. The specific gravity is shown in Table 2, and the other physical properties are shown in Table 3. Comparative Example 4 A curable composition was prepared in a similar manner to that in Examples 10 to 12 by using No. 1 (a polymer obtained by blending Thiokol “LP-3” and “LP-23” manufactured by Toray Fine Chemicals Co., Ltd. at a ratio of 6:4) as a polymer, and the specific gravity was measured, and the result of the measurement is shown in Table 2. Furthermore, the glass transition temperature, temperature of 50% weight loss, elastic recovery, hardness and dumbbell physical characteristic values of a sheet-like cured product having a thickness of 2 mm were obtained. The obtained results are shown in Table 3. Examples 13 to 16 9 parts by weight of manganese dioxide (TYPE-FA manufactured by Honeywell), and 35 parts by weight of SRF carbon, 9 parts by weight of butyl benzyl phthalate and 0.45 parts by weight of tetrabutylthiuram disulfide (Ouchi Shinko Chemical Industrial Co., Ltd., Nocceller TBT) as additives were added to 100 parts by weight of each of the polymers of Examples 4 to 7 (Nos. 7 to 10), and the mixture was kneaded by using a triple roll mill. 34 g of the mixture in total was put between iron plates that had been adjusted to give a gap of 2 mm and cured by heating at 70° C. for 2 hours to prepare a sheet-like cured composition having a thickness of 2 mm. The obtained sheet was left under an atmosphere at 23° C., 50% RH for 1 hour to remove the heat. The specific gravity of the cured product that had been cut out into about 20 mm square was measured. The result is shown in Table 2. Comparative Example 5 A curable composition was prepared in a similar manner to that in Examples 13 to 16 by using No. 6 (a polymer obtained by blending Thiokol “LP-3” and “LP-2” manufactured by Toray Fine Chemicals Co., Ltd. at a ratio of 1:9) as a polymer, and the specific gravity was measured, the result of the measurement is shown in Table 2.

The curable compositions using the polysulfide polymers each having an average value of r in the range of from 1.1 to 1.8 are suitable for purposes of use for which further weight saving is required. Comparative Example 6 A sheet-like curable composition having a thickness of 2 mm was prepared by using No. 5 (the polymer of Comparative Example 2) as a polymer in a similar manner to that in Examples 10 to 12, and the glass transition temperature, temperature of 50% weight loss, elastic recovery, hardness and dumbbell physical characteristic values were obtained.

The curable composition of Comparative Example 6, which had an average value of repeating numbers of sulfur r of 1.0, had a low glass transition temperature and high heat resistance, but had a very low hardness as 4, and also had low M100 and Tmax in the dumbbell tensile test, and thus the cured product was not suitable for practical use. From the results in Tables 2 and 3, the curable compositions using the thiol group-containing polymers having an average value of r from 1.1 to 1.8 are suitable for sealants for aircraft for which further weight saving and adaptation in broader temperature ranges are required. Example 17 A base component was prepared by adding the compounding agents shown in Table 4 to 100 parts by weight of the polymer of Example 3 (No. 4, the average value of r was 1.1) and by using a planetary mixer, and 134 parts by weight of hexamethylene diisocyanate (Duranate 50M-HDI manufactured by Asahi Kasei Corporation, NCO content 5.0%) was further added thereto, and the mixture was thoroughly kneaded by manual kneading. The mixture was formed into a sheet-like shape of 50 mm×12 mm×3 mm thickness on an aluminum plate and cured at 23° C. for 3 days then at 50° C. for 3 days, whereby a cured product was obtained. The obtained cured product was subjected to evaluation of accelerated weather resistance by using S. W. O. M. The obtained result is shown in Table 4. Comparative Example 7 A cured product having a thickness of 3 mm using the polymer of Comparative Example 2 (No. 5, the average value of r was 1.0) was prepared in a similar manner to Example 17, and the accelerated weather resistance was evaluated by using S.

It is understood from the results of the dumbbell tensile physical properties in Table 3 and the weather resistance in Table 4 that the curable composition using the polysulfide polymer having an average value of r of 1.1 was different in properties from when the polymer having an average value of r of 1.0 was used. Example 18 100 parts by weight of “Epicoat 828,” which is an epoxy resin manufactured by Japan Epoxy Resin, and 5 parts by weight of “ADEKA Hardener EHC30,” which is an aromatic tertiary amine manufactured by ADEKA Corporation, were thoroughly kneaded by manual kneading with respect to 100 parts by weight of the polymer of Example 3 (No. 4, the average value of r was 1.1), and the mixture was cured at 23° C. for 7 days, whereby a test piece having a thickness of 1 cm was prepared. The glass transition temperature and temperature of 50% weight loss of the obtained curable composition were measured. The obtained results are shown in Table 5. Comparative Example 8 A curable composition was prepared in a similar manner to Example 18 by using Sample 1 (a polymer obtained by blending Thiokol “LP-3” and “LP-23” manufactured by Toray Fine Chemical Co., Ltd. at a ratio of 6:4) instead of the polymer of Example 3, and the glass transition temperature and temperature of 50% weight loss were measured.

INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY The thiol group-containing polymer has a lower specific gravity, a lower viscosity, a lower glass transition temperature and higher heat resistance than those of conventional polysulfide polymers, by decreasing the repeating number of sulfur in the polysulfide bonds and, thus, can be used in sealants, adhesives, paints and the like for which properties of a low specific gravity, a low viscosity and a low glass transition temperature are required. Furthermore, since our curable composition has improved elastic recovery and improved weather resistance, it can be used in sealants, adhesives, paints and the like for which elastic recovery and weather resistance are required. 1-9.
