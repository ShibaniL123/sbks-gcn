Structured block copolymers Field of the invention The invention relates to a structured block copolymer. More particularly, the invention relates to a structured block copolymer based on the block copolymerization of N-vinyl formamide (NVF) with other monomers by using a bifunctional initiator. Further, the present invention concerns a method of preparing the structured block copolymer. The invention also relates to the use of the structured block copolymer in sludge dewatering and in papermaking processes. Background of the invention Various flocculants including polymeric flocculants have been used in order to flocculate and dewater sludge generated from municipal sewage and industrial wastewater. A method for flocculating and precipitating solid contents by addi ng a polymer flocculant to waste water has been widely adopted. I n these methods, a process of adding a dilute aqueous solution of the polymer flocculant to waste water or sludge is typical. Flocculants are added to facilitate the settli ng of suspended particles in a solution . Flocculants facilitate the agglomeration and, therefore, make larger floccules. These tend to settle down due to gravitational force. Flocculants try to bridge the molecules formi ng clu mps. For example, an anionic flocculant will react with a positively charge polymer and will adsorb those particles. I n recent years, sludge generated f rom municipal sewage and industrial wastewater has been increasing because of changes i n the recent livi ng envi ronment. Fu rthermore, the properties of the sludge are becoming worse. Due to i ncreasing demand of cationic polymer flocculants in these application there is a need to develop new cationic block copolymers designed for cost-effective solids/liquid separation processes. I n addition to the use as polymeric flocculants, water-soluble polymers, in particular, high-molecular weight water-soluble polymers are used i n various technical fields such as retention aids, paper strength agents, and thickeners. Such water-soluble polymers include homopolymers prepared by polymerizi ng an anionic monomer such as an acrylate or a methacrylate, a cationic monomer such as dimethylami noethyl(meth)acrylate quaternary salt, or a nonionic monomer such as (meth)acrylamide and also i nclude ionic polymers such as copolymers of an anionic monomer and a nonionic monomer; copolymers of a cationic monomer and a nonionic monomer; and copolymers of a cationic monomer, an anionic monomer, and a nonionic monomer. Conventionally, a cationic polymer flocculant is used for dewatering sewage sludge and the like, and also as a retention aid in paper making. On the market there exists quite a broad range of polyacrylamide flocculants used i n the water treatment and as sludge dewatering polymers. However, the known flocculants consisting of acrylamide-cationic monomers based copolymers have li mited performance at high pH due to low resistance to hydrolysis and low stability under high shear conditions. With traditional polyacrylamide flocculants, u nder certain circumstances (high pH value), the amide group present i n the polymer backbone can react with thei r neighboring cationic ester groups. A cationic copolymer is then transformed to a non-ionic or even anionic copolymer with inexistent or poor dewatering activities. Therefore there is a need to find more stable acrylamide-based copolymers. The cationic polymers are also widely used in the paper industry. They are often referred to as fixatives, drai nage aids, and/or retention aids, and they are added to the pulp before or du ring paper production. The term "fixing" generally i mplies the binding of small particles to pulp fibers. Fixatives build up agglomerates with colloidal material i n the water phase and attach them onto fibers so that they end up i n the final paper sheet. It is known that the existing cationic polymers do not work well under all circumstances. Therefore there is a constant need to find better performi ng polymers for use in the paper making processes or at least fi nd new alternatives for the existing ones. Brief description of the invention An object of the present invention is thus to provide a new block copolymer, which could be used in sludge dewatering or in paper making processes. The objects of the invention are achieved by a structured block copolymer which is characterized by what is stated in the independent claim 1 . The preferred embodiments of the invention are disclosed in the dependent claims. The structured block copolymer of the present invention contains two different homopolymer blocks. These two different homopolymer blocks are made up of different polymerized monomers, wherein the monomers are (i) N-vinylformamide (NVF), and (ii) acrylic acid, acrylamide or water-soluble derivative thereof, and the two different homopolymer blocks are linked together with a molecular spacer derived from a bifu notional initiator used for the polymerization of said homopolymer blocks. Polymerization of NVF gives an NVF-based homopolymer, which is herein referred to as P(NVF). The structured block copolymer containing P(NVF) provides the opportunity to hydrolyze them to polyvinylamines (PVAm). Polyvinylamines are more environmentally friendly polymers than acrylamide polymers, and thus, the resulting structured block copolymer containing a block, wherein at least part of the P(NVF) is hydrolyzed to PVAm is "greener" polymer, which is an additional advantage of the present invention. Thus, the invention provides new structured copolymers containing polyvinylamines, which are prepared from the monomer NVF as a replacement to conventionally used acrylamide. Such new NVF-based polyvinylamines are more "acrylamide free", and consequently greener polymer compared to traditional products on the market. Further, the structured block copolymers of the present invention can be made more stable in high pH conditions than conventional random copolymers of the same monomers. For example, some traditional flocculants based on acrylamide and cationic monomer have displayed limited activities in water treatment and as sludge dewatering polymers. This is due to their low stability in high shear conditions such as highly alkaline conditions. In these polymers the amide group present in the polymer backbone acts as a catalyst and can therefore react with the neighbouring cationic ester groups. This intramolecular reaction results i n dramatic modification of the copolymer backbone, with possibly complete losses of cationic groups in the polymer. A cationic copolymer is then consequently transformed to a non-ionic or even anionic copolymer with nonexistent dewateri ng activity. As a result, such acrylamide-based copolymers are not suitable to be used as flocculants, because of i ntolerance to high alkaline conditions. These i ntramolecular reactions can be avoided by using a bifunctional initiator (initiator bearing two functionalities) for the polymerization. This bifunctional initiator works as a molecular spacer between the acrylamide and the cationic groups in the copolymer backbone. The bifunctional initiator can be used to polymerize the two homopolymer blocks of the copolymer. With such a molecular spacer between the two blocks, under highly basic conditions, the acrylamide group of the poly(acrylamide) block in the copolymer cannot react anymore with the cationic group of the other homopolymer. Random copolymers of an acrylamide and a cationic monomer have also the disadvantage that the charges of the cationic monomer are randomly spread over the copolymer backbone. In the present invention the structured block copolymer contains two homopolymers, wherefrom the other one is the partially (or completely) hydrolysed poly(NVF-PVAm) cationic homopolymer and the other block is for example poly(acrylamide) homopolymer. In the cationic homopolymer all the charges are concentrated into one block, which makes the polymer more efficient in the suggested end uses, such as flocculant, sludge dewateri ng polymer, fixative, drainage aid, or retention aid. Accordingly the present invention provides as a first aspect a structured block copolymer, which contains two different homopolymer blocks, which are made up of different polymerized monomers, wherein the monomers are (i) N-vinylformamide (NVF), and (ii) acrylic acid, acrylamide or water-soluble derivatives thereof. In a second aspect the invention provides a method for preparing a structured block copolymer, wherein two different monomers are polymerized via a two-step copolymerization. In said method a compound having the formula (I) wherein R is H, or Ci-5-alkyl, and n is from 1 to 10, is used as a bifunctional initiator during the polymerization. One step of the copolymerization consists of preparing the NVF-based homopolymer. The other step is the formation of homopolymer block of acrylic acid, acrylamide or water soluble derivatives thereof. In a third aspect the invention provides an intermediate product characterized in that it contains N-vinylformamide (NVF) homopolymer block, which is polymerized by using a bifunctional initiator having the formula (I), wherein R is H, or Ci-5-alkyl, and n = 1 to 10. In another aspect, the invention provides a product characterized by containing a partially hydrolyzed poly(NVF-PVAm) cationic homopolymer block, prepared after a selective hydrolysis step. In a still another aspect the invention provides the use of the structured block copolymer according to the invention in paper making processes and/or in sludge dewatering. Brief description of the drawings In the following the invention will be described in greater detail by means of preferred embodiments with reference to the attached [accompany-ing] drawings, in which Figure 1 illustrates a schematic representation of the selective hydrolysis of NVF- acrylamide based structured block copolymer using acidic conditions; Figure 2 illustrates a schematic representation of the selective hydrolysis of Q9-NVF based structured block copolymer using acidic conditions; Figure 3 illustrates a schematic representation of the hydrolysis of NVF-acrylamide based structured block copolymer using alkaline conditions; Figure 4 shows 1 H NMR spectra of the structured block copolymer before hydrolysis; Figure 5 shows 1 H NMR spectra of the structured block copolymer after hydrolysis; Figure 6 shows 13C NMR spectra of the structured block copolymer before hydrolysis; and Figure 7 shows 13C NMR spectra of the structured block copolymer after hydrolysis. Detailed description of the invention The present i nvention relates to a structured block copolymer based on the block copolymerization of N-vi nyl formamide (NVF) with other monomers by usi ng a bifunctional initiator, which also later acts as a molecular spacer in polymer backbone. The bifunctional initiator used is known and it has been used to form copolymers, but not from N-vinyl formamide. Thus, the preparation of a block copolymer with a homopolymer unit derived from N-vi nyl formamide connected by a molecular spacer to another homopolymer unit provides new copolymers havi ng structured block structu re. These new structured block copolymers contain two different homopolymer blocks, which are made up of different polymerized monomers, wherein the monomers are (i) N-vinylformamide (NVF), and (ii) acrylic acid, acrylamide or water-soluble derivatives thereof. The general structure of the new structured block copolymers is the following: [first block] - [spacer] - [second block] The first block is a homopolymer made of NVF monomers and the second block is a homopolymer made of a monomer selected from a group comprising acrylic acid, acrylamide and water-soluble derivatives thereof. Polymerization of NVF gives an NVF homopolymer, which is herein referred to as P(NVF) or NVF-based block. The structured block copolymer containing P(NVF) may be hydrolyzed to polyvinylamine (PVAm). Polyvinylamines are environmentally friendly polymers, and thus, also the resulting structured block copolymer containing a block, wherein at least part of the P(NVF) is hydrolysed to PVAm is more environmentally friendly polymer than for example a block copolymer, where acryl amide is used as a monomer instead of NVF. The water-soluble derivatives of acrylic acid and acrylamide can be selected from a group comprising methacrylamide, N-methylolacrylamide, N-methylolmethacrylamide, methacrylic acid, methyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate, butyl acrylate, 2-ethylhexyl acrylate, lauryl acrylate, stearyl acrylate, 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate, 2-hydroxypropyl acrylate, methyl methacrylate, ethyl methacrylate, butyl methacrylate, 2-ethylhexyl methacrylate, lauryl methacrylate, stearyl methacrylate, 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate, 2-hydroxypropyl methacrylate, glycidyl methacrylate, 2-acrylamide-2-methylpropanesulfonic acid, dimethylaminoethyl acrylate, diethylaminoethyl acrylate, dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate, diethylaminoethyl methacrylate, N,N-dimethylaminopropylacrylamide, Ν,Ν-dimethylaminopropylmethacrylamide, 2-N-morpholinoethyl methacrylate, 2- diisopropylaminoethyl methacrylate, 1 -(2-methacryloyloxyethyl) imidazole, 2-(tert- butylamino)ethyl methacrylate, Ν,Ν-dimethylaminoethyl acrylamide, N-[2-(dimethyl- amino)-1 , 1 -dimethylethyl] acrylamide, and their methyl chloride or methyl sulfate quaternaries or mixtures thereof ; or methacrylamidopropyltrimethylammonium chloride (MAPTAC), dimethylaminoethylacrylate methyl chloride (Q9), diallyldimethylammonium chloride (DADMAC). According to one embodiment of the present invention the structured block copolymers are polymerized by using a bifu nctional initiator having the formula (I) wherei n R is H , or Ci-5-alkyl, and n is from 1 to 1 0. Typical monomer ratio (in mol) between the fi rst and second blocks is from 1 :1 to 9 :1 , preferably from 1 :1 to 4: 1 . The molecular weight of the fi rst block is typically from 1 000 to 21 000, whereas the molecular weight of the final copolymer might be f rom 48 000 to several millions, but preferably f rom 1 00 000 to 1 200 000. As an example of the polymerization method accordi ng to the i nvention, the NVF- acrylamide based structu red block copolymers may be prepared i n a two-step synthetic procedure using a bifunctional initiator. A schematic description of the polymerization process is described below (Scheme A). I n the fi rst step of the process, NVF (1 ) is reacted with the bifu nctional i nitiator at low temperature (T = 0-5 °C) i n presence of Na2S20s givi ng the intermediate 2. At this temperature, only the peroxide groups of the initiator react, while the azo group remains i ntact for the second step of the reaction. Then, acrylamide (3) can be added to the reaction mixture, which was warmed at higher temperatu re (about 65 °C). The azo group of the i nitiator decomposed and was reacted with the double bond of acrylamide, yieldi ng the targeted structu red block copolymer (4). The details regarding a typical procedu re are presented i n the examples. Scheme A: preparation of a NVF-acrylamide based structu red block copolymer I n an embodi ment, the structured block copolymer of the present invention contains an P(NVF) block, wherein at least part of the formamide groups have been hydrolyzed to ami no groups. The degree of hydrolysis of the formamide groups may vary between 0.5% and 1 00%. I n an embodiment of the present invention the degree of hydrolysis of the formamide groups is at least 1 0%, but it may as well be at least 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80% or 90% depending on the application where the polymer is used. Preferably the degree of hydrolysis is between 50-1 00%. The present invention also provides a new intermediate product for the preparation of structured block copolymers. This intermediate product contains N-vi nylformamide (NVF) homopolymer block, which is polymerized by usi ng a bifunctional initiator having the formula (I) (I) wherei n R is H , or Ci-5-alkyl, and n = 1 to 1 0. Another aspect of the present i nvention is the method for preparing a structu red block copolymer. I n this method two different monomers are polymerized via a two-step copolymerization, and a compound havi ng the above formula (I), wherei n R is H , or Ci-5-alkyl, and n is from 1 to 1 0, is used as a bifunctional initiator duri ng the polymerization. From the two steps of the copolymerization one step is for forming homopolymer blocks of N-vinylformamide (NVF), and it the other step is for forming homopolymer blocks of acrylic acid, acrylamide or water-soluble derivatives thereof. Possible water-soluble derivatives of acrylic acid and acrylamide are the ones listed above. As mentioned, one of the advantages of the present invention is the possibility to hydrolyze the formamide groups (secondary amide -like group) of the P(NVF) block. The challenge of this hydrolysis step consists of reacting only one group (secondary amide) without affecting the other groups (primary amides and esters). The NVF-based structured block copolymers according to the invention may contain different reactive chemical groups: secondary amide from the NVF-based block, primary amide from for example an acrylamide-based block or ester from for example a Q9-based block (depending on which monomer is used as the second monomer), and also an ester from the bifunctional initiator. It has now been discovered that the selectively hydrolysis of the NVF-based structured block copolymers can be done by an acidic hydrolysis of such a block copolymer (e.g. a structured block copolymer of NVF-spacer-acrylamide). Based on both NMR spectroscopy and GPC measurements, the hydrolysis provides amino groups to the P(NVF) block without hydrolyzing the primary amide and ester moieties. Accordingly, i n an embodiment of the invention , the method fu rther contains a step wherein the vi nylformamide groups of the formed structured block copolymer are at least partially selectively hydrolyzed to vinylami ne groups. In an embodi ment the selective hydrolysis is made by using a strong acid and havi ng pH between 0.5 and 6, preferably pH is between 1 and 2.5. The strong acid used for the hydrolysis is preferably hydrochloric acid (HCI) and it may be optionally used together with sodiu m dithionite or a as buffer solution . The buffer solution used may be a hydrochloric acid / potassium chloride buffer solution (pH = 1 at T = 20 °C). A schematic representation of selective hydrolysis of NVF-acrylamide based structured block copolymer using acidic conditions is shown in Scheme 1 , which in illustrated in Figure 1 . In one embodiment, the second homopolymer is polymerized using dimethylaminoethylacrylate methyl chloride (Q9) as the monomer. Q9 contains an ester group. As mentioned above also the hydrolysis of a NVF-Q9 based block copolymer provides amino groups to the P(NVF) block without hydrolyzing the ester groups, which are present in the Q9-based block and in the spacer. A schematic representation of selective hydrolysis of Q9-NVF based structured block copolymer using acidic conditions is shown in Scheme 2, which is illustrated in Figure 2. In addition to selective hydrolysis under acidic conditions, it has been discovered that the selectively hydrolysis of the NVF-based structured block copolymers can also be done by caustic hydrolysis i.e. under alkaline conditions. Also caustic hydrolysis provides primary amino groups to the P(NVF) block without hydrolyzing the primary amides and esters. I n an embodi ment the hydrolysis is made by usi ng a strong base and havi ng pH between 8 and 1 4, preferably pH is between 1 0 and 1 2. The strong base is preferably sodium hydroxide (NaOH). A schematic representation of hydrolysis of NVF-acrylamide based structured block copolymer using alkaline conditions is shown in Scheme 3, which in illustrated in Figure 3. The structu red block copolymers obtai ned after the polymerization and after the possible hydrolysis are in the form of a water solution . After the polymerization the solid content of the solution may vary depending on reaction conditions used. The solid content may be for example from 1 to 20 %, and is typically between 5 to 1 5 %. The obtained water solution may be dried so that final polymer may be in solid form or as concentrated solution . The polymer may be also formulated in the form of emulsion or dispersion . The structu red block copolymer accordi ng to the present i nvention may be used in many applications, but it is especially designed to be used in paper maki ng processes and i n sludge dewatering. Wastewater discharged f rom industrial waste treatment plants must be low in suspended solids, COD, BOD and TOC. Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) is the total measurement of all chemicals in the water that can be oxidized ; Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) measures the amou nt of food (or organic carbons) that bacteria can oxidize ; and Total Organic Carbon (TOC) is the measu rement of organic carbons. The structu red block copolymers according to the present invention work to i ncrease the particle size and settli ng rate of suspended material in wastewater. Removal of suspended solids, while benefit in itself, can also cause a decrease i n BOD, TOC, and COD. Likewise, industrial sludges must be treated to remove as much water as possible in preparation for transportation and/or final disposal. The structured block copolymer according to the present invention will modify the sludges duri ng the dewatering operation and provide high water release from the sludge at low usage rate and cost. Since liquid sludges can not typically be safely and inexpensively disposed, the structured block copolymer according to the present invention helps in envi ronmental compliance by properly and consistently aidi ng in water removal. Accordingly, an aspect of the i nvention is the use of the structu red block copolymer of the present i nvention in sludge dewatering. The structured block copolymer can be used as a sludge dewatering polymer or as a flocculant. Another aspect of the invention is the use of the structured block copolymer of the present invention i n paper making processes. I n these processes the structured block copolymer of the present i nvention may act as a fixative or retention agent. It is apparent to a person skilled in the art that as technology advanced, the basic idea of the i nvention can be implemented in various ways. The invention and its embodiments are therefore not restricted to the above examples, but they may vary within the scope of the claims. EXAMPLES Example 1 - polymerization of NVF and acrylamide based block copolymer, and hydrolysis under acidic conditions A 200 mL multi-necks reactor was equipped with a thermometer, a reflux condenser and a nitrogen inlet. The apparatus was purged constantly with nitrogen. In the reactor, a N- vinylformamide solution (30.7 g of 50% water solution) was mixed with deionized water (100 g), Versenex 80 (2 g; 80% solution). The solution was mixed very well and pH was adjusted to 4.5 with concentrated sulfuric acid. The bifunctional initiator (0.01 g, dissolved in a minimum amount of THF) was added to the previous reaction mixture. After mixing for 10-15 minutes, the reaction mixture was cooled to T = 0 °C and Na2S20s (0.2 g in 20 g of water) was added slowly to the reaction mixture. The temperature was carefully monitored below T = 10 °C during addition of Na2S20s. After completion of the addition, the reaction mixture was stirred at T = 0 °C overnight (about 16 hours). In the morning, a small amount of acrylamide (2 g in 50 % water solution), which was previously acidified to pH = 4.5 with concentrated sulfuric acid, was added slowly to the reactor. The reaction mixture was then warmed to T = 65 °C. Then, the rest of acrylamide (8.2 g, 50% water solution) was pumped slowly to the reaction mixture. When the addition was completed, the reaction mixture was stirred at T = 65 °C for additional 24h. The formed structured block copolymer was then analyzed by 1H and 13C NMR, GPC, solid content and viscosity (Brookfield) before the hydrolysis step. The analysis results of the structured block copolymer are shown in Table 1 , and the NMR spectras are shown in Figures 4 and 6, which are the "before the hydrolysis" spectras. Solid content (SC): the amount of polymer in solution (%) was determined using a halogen moisture analyzer HR 73 from Metier Todelo and corresponding standard method (T = 150 °C). Viscosity: the viscosity (cP) was determined using a Brookfield Digital Viscometer following the standard instructions (manual M/92-021 -P405). NMR spectra were recorded on spectrometers Bruker Ultra ShieldTM 400 (400 MHz for 1 H and 100 MHz for 13C). D2O was used as solvent and the signal of the solvent as internal standards. Chemical shifts are expressed in ppm and number of protons. Molecular weight distribution: Mw, Mn and PD were measured using an agilent 1 100 series SEC apparatus equipped with a Rl detector. Polymers were dissolved in THF before injection. The standards used for the determination of the molecular weight were a series of PEO (polyethylene glycol) with molecular mass (Mw) varying from 430 to 1 015 000. Table 1 . Analysis results of the intermediate structured block copolymer Under inert atmosphere, HCI solution (0.1 N, 375 ml_) was put in a 1 L 3 necks round bottom flask equipped with a reflux condenser. The previous block copolymer to hydrolyze (50 ml_ aqueous solution) was then added slowly to the HCI solution at room temperature. After completion of the addition, the reaction mixture was homogeneous. Then, the reaction mixture was stirred at T = 65 °C for 5h. Then, the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and the final copolymer was analyzed by 1H NMR and 13C NMR, GPC, solid content, pH, and viscosity (Brookfield). The analysis results of the final structured block copolymer are shown in Table 2, and the NMR spectras are shown in Figures 5 and 7, which are the "after the hydrolysis" spectras. Table 2. Analysis results of the final structured block copolymer Comparison of the NMR spectras before and after hydrolysis shows that the amount of NHCOH groups (NVF-based block) is decreasing after hydrolysis, while the amount of CONH2 groups (acrylamide-based block) is remaining the same. The presence of formic acid after hydrolysis is also noticed, which confirms hydrolysis of NHCOH groups from NVF-based block. By comparing NMR spectra, it can also be noticed that the residual NVF monomer has disappeared after hydrolysis, while residual acrylamide monomer is still present and thus not affecting the hydrolysis conditions. The copolymer obtained was suitable for use as a fixative as shown in the following Example. Example 2 - Fixative The structured block copolymer according to Example 1 was tested as fixatives for a coated broke (Test 1 ). Another structured block copolymer was also prepared according to Example 1 , but the amount of acid used for the hydrolysis was half of the amount used in the Example 1 , and thus resulted in lower degree of hydrolysis of the final polymer (Test 2). Turbidity was used as a parameter to estimate the fixative properties of these NVF-based structured block copolymers. Turbidity was measured using a Turb 555IR WTW. Measurements were expressed in NTU (nephelometric turbidity units, 90° scattered light measurement).The copolymer of Test 1 significantly decreased the turbidity from 9014.8 NTU to 7487 NTU (dosage 1 10 g/t, as active contents) and to 6974 NTU (dosage 220 g/t, as active contents). The analogue copolymer (Test 2), which has a lower degree of hydrolysis, decreased the turbidity from 9014.8 NTU to 7130 NTU (dosage 160 g/t, as active contents) and to 5804 NTU (dosage 320 g/t, as active contents). Another comparison test was made with corresponding non-hydrolyzed block copolymer, but it did not show as significant change in turbidity after chemical addition. From these tests it could be concluded that the copolymer obtained was suitable for use as a fixative and the higher degree of hydrolysis improved the fixative properties. Example 3 - polymerization of dimethylaminoethylacrylate methyl chloride (Q9) and NVF based block copolymer, and hydrolysis under acidic conditions A 200 mL multi-necks reactor was equipped with a thermometer, a reflux condenser and a nitrogen inlet. The apparatus was purged constantly with nitrogen. In the reactor, dimethylaminoethylacrylate methyl chloride solution (56 g of 50% water solution) was mixed with deionized water (75 g), Versenex 80 (2 g; 80% solution). The solution was mixed very well and pH was adjusted to 4.5 with concentrated sulfuric acid. The bifunctional initiator (0.075 g, dissolved in a minimum amount of THF) was added to the previous reaction mixture. After mixing for 10-15 minutes, the reaction mixture was cooled to T = 0 °C and Na2S20s (0.2 g in 20 g of water) was added slowly to the reaction mixture. The temperature was carefully monitored below T = 10 °C during addition of Na2S20s. After completion of the addition, the reaction mixture was stirred at T = 0 °C overnight (about 16 hours). In the morning, a small amount of N-vinylformamide (4 g in 50 % water solution), which was previously acidified to pH = 4.5 with concentrated sulfuric acid, was added slowly to the reactor. The reaction mixture was then warmed to T = 65 °C. Then, the rest of N- vinylformamide (16.4 g, 50% water solution) was pumped slowly to the reaction mixture. When the addition was completed, the reaction mixture was stirred at T = 65 °C for additional 24h. The intermediate structured block copolymer was then analyzed by 1 H and 13C NMR, GPC, solid content and viscosity (Brookfield) before the hydrolysis step. Under inert atmosphere, HCI solution (0.1 N, 230 mL) was put in a 500 mL 3 necks round bottom flask equipped with a reflux condenser. The previous block copolymer to hydrolyze (30 mL aqueous solution) was then added slowly to the HCI solution at room temperature. After completion of the addition, the reaction mixture was homogeneous. Then, the reaction mixture was stirred at T = 65 °C for 5h. Then, the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and the final copolymer was analyzed by 1H and 13C NMR, GPC, solid content, viscosity (Brookfield) and charge density. Example 4 - Flocculant The NVF-Q9-based structured block copolymer obtained from Example 3 was tested as flocculant with a DIP sludge (dry substance 3.9 %). The sludge dewatering tests (Poly Test) have been conducted in order to study the performance of new polymers. Filtrate turbidity has been measured as a response parameter. The tested copolymer shows significant decreasing of the filtrate turbidity. Without treatment, the filtrate turbidity was found to be 9999 NTU. After treatment with a NVF-Q9-based structured block copolymer (dosage of 2.5 kg / 1), the filtrate turbidity decreased to 1 131 NTU, which shows that the copolymer obtained was suitable for use as a flocculant. Example 5 - fixative, hydrolysis under caustic conditions A 200 mL multi-necks reactor was equipped with a thermometer, a reflux condenser and a nitrogen inlet. The apparatus was purged constantly with nitrogen. In the reactor, N- vinylformamide solution (30.7 g of 50% water solution) was mixed with deionized water (100 g), Versenex 80 (2 g; 80% solution). The solution was mixed very well and pH was adjusted to 4.5 with concentrated sulfuric acid. The bifunctional initiator (0.01 g, dissolved in a minimum amount of THF) was added to the previous reaction mixture. After mixing for 10-15 minutes, the reaction mixture was cooled to T = 0 °C and Na2S20s (0.2 g in 20 g of water) was added slowly to the reaction mixture. The temperature was carefully monitored below T = 10 °C during addition of Na2S20s. After completion of the addition, the reaction mixture was stirred at T = 0 °C overnight (about 16 hours). In the morning, a few amount of acrylamide (2 g in 50 % water solution), which was previously acidified to pH = 4.5 with concentrated sulfuric acid, was added slowly to the reactor. The reaction mixture was then warmed to T = 65 °C. Then, the rest of acrylamide (8.2 g, 50% water solution) was pumped slowly to the reaction mixture. When the addition was completed, the reaction mixture was stirred at T = 65 °C for additional 24h. The final polymer was then analyzed by solid content and viscosity (Brookfield) and charge density. Under inert atmosphere, NaOH solution (0.1 N, 100 ml_) was put in a 250 ml_ 3 necks round bottom flask equipped with a reflux condenser. The previous block copolymer to hydrolyze (20 ml_ aqueous solution) was then added slowly to the NaOH solution at room temperature. After completion of the addition, the reaction mixture was homogeneous. Then, the reaction mixture was stirred at T = 65 °C for 5h. Then, the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and the final copolymer was analyzed by 1 H and 13C NMR, GPC, solid content, viscosity (Brookfield) and charge density. The copolymer obtained was suitable for use as a fixative. 1 .
