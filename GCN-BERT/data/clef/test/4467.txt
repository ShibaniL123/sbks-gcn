TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a triazine ring-containing polymer compound. More particularly, the invention relates to an electron transport triazine ring-containing polymer compound preferably used for an organic light-emitting element. BACKGROUND ART As an organic light-emitting element, an element having a multi-layer structure wherein one or plural organic layers are provided between an anode and a cathode is known. In a patent document 1, an organic light-emitting element containing a triazine derivative that is a low-molecular compound in an organic layer is disclosed. When a layer is formed using a low-molecular compound, a vacuum deposition method is generally used. In this method, however, there is a problem such that vacuum equipment is necessary or the film thickness of the layer is liable to become ununiform. In contrast with this, use of a polymer compound has an advantage that the layer can be formed by a coating method suchasspincoating. For example, in a patent document 2, a fluorescent conjugated polymer compound comprising a repeating unit containing a triazine ring is disclosed. In a non-patent document 1, a non-conjugated polymer compound having a triazine skeleton, which can be utilized for organic light-emitting elements or field effect transistors, is disclosed. This polymer compound is specifically a polymer compound obtained by copolymerizing an electron transport triphenyltriazine derivative monomer and a hole transport triphenylamine derivative monomer. In a non-patent document 2, a non-conjugated polymer compound comprising a constitutional unit derived from a triphenyltriazine derivative, a constitutional unit derived from a perylene derivative and a constitutional unit derived from an iridium complex, and an organic light-emitting element using the polymer compound are disclosed.

In the present specification, the "electron transport property" and the "hole transport property" are together referred to also as "carrier transport property". Embodiment 1 The polymer compound (1) (embodiment 1) of the invention contains a constitutional unit derived from an electron transport polymerizable compound represented by the aforesaid formula (1), and is obtained by polymerizing an electron transport polymerizable compound represented by the formula (1). In the electron transport moiety of the polymer compound, a structure wherein a triazine ring, a divalent aromatic group (A2) and a monovalent aromatic group (A1) are aligned in series is contained, and hence, an organic light-emitting element having high luminous efficiency is obtained. In the aforesaid formula (1), A1, A3 and A5 are each independently a monovalent aromatic group which may have a hetero atom as a ring-constituting atom, e.g., a monovalent aromatic group of a 5-memberd ring or a 6-membered ring (which may have a hetero atom as a ring-constituting atom) or a monovalent condensed polycyclic aromatic group (which may have a hetero atom as a ring-constituting atom). Of these, the aromatic group of a 6-membered ring is preferable, and as the aromatic group, a phenyl group, a pyridyl group or a pyrimidyl group can be mentioned. Of these, a phenyl group is preferable from the viewpoint of carrier transport ability. A2, A4 and A6 are each independently a divalent aromatic group which may have a hetero atom as a ring-constituting atom, e. g. , a divalent aromatic group of a 5-memberd ring or a 6-membered ring (which may have a hetero atom as a ring-constituting atom) or a divalent condensed polycyclic aromatic group (which may have a hetero atom as a ring-constituting atom). Of these, the aromatic group of a 6-membered ring is preferable, and as the aromatic group, a phenylene group, a pyridylene group or a pyrimidylene group can be mentioned. Of these, a phenylene group is preferable from the viewpoint of carrier transport ability. At least one of A1 to A6 has a substituent having a polymerizable functional group. When A1 of them has a substituent having a polymerizable functional group, an organic light-emitting element having higher luminous efficiency is obtained. The above polymerizable functional group may be any of radical polymerizable, cationic polymerizable, anionic polymerizable, addition polymerizable and condensation polymerizable functional groups. Of these, the radical polymerizable functional group is preferable because preparation of a polymer is easy. As the substituent having a polymerizable functional group, specifically, a substituent represented by the following formula (7) is preferable. In the formula (7), R701 is a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group of 1 to 12 carbon atoms.

Of these, a hydrogen atom is preferable as R701 from the viewpoint of carrier transport ability. X7 is a single bond or a group represented by any one of the following formulas (X71) to (X74). -RX71-CH2-RX72- (X71) -RX71-O-RX72- (X72) -RX71-S-RX72- (X73) In the above formulas, RX71 is a single bond or an alkylene group of 1 to 12 carbon atoms, and RX72 is a single bond, an alkylene group of 1 to 12 carbon atoms or a phenylene group.

Of these, a single bond or an alkylene group of 1 to 20 carbon atoms is preferable as X7, and a single bond is more preferable. When no hetero atom is contained in X7 as above, an organic light-emitting element having higher luminous efficiency is obtained. A1 to A6 may have a substituent other than a substituent having a polymerizable functional group. As such a substituent, a cyano group, an amino group, an alkyl group of 1 to 12 carbon atoms or an alkoxy group of 1 to 12 carbon atoms can be mentioned. Examples of the alkyl groups of 1 to 12 carbon atoms include methyl group, ethyl group, propyl group, isopropyl group, butyl group, isobutyl group, t-butyl group, amyl group, hexyl group, octyl group, decyl group, 2-ethylhexyl group and dodecyl group.
