SUMMARY This invention relates to a new medical use for certain chemical compounds and pharmaceutical compositions containing them. The invention relates to compounds which are mGlu2/3 negative allosteric modulators for use in the treatment of ASD, in particular autism. In another aspect, the invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition for use in the treatment of ASD comprising a compound according to the invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. BACKGROUND ART L-glutamic acid, the most commonly occurring neurotransmitter in the CNS, plays a critical role in a large number of physiological processes. The glutamate-dependent stimulus receptors are divided into two main groups. The first main group forms ligand-controlled ion channels. The metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR) form the second main group and, furthermore, belong to the family of G-protein-coupled receptors. At present, eight different members of these mGluR are known and of these some even have sub-types. On the basis of structural parameters, the different influences on the synthesis of intracellular signaling molecules and the different affinity to low-molecular weight chemical compounds, these eight receptors can be sub-divided into three sub-groups: mGlu1 and mGlu5 belong to group I, mGlu2 and mGlu3 belong to group II and mGlu4, mGlu6, mGlu7 and mGlu8 belong to group III. Ligands of metabotropic glutamate receptors belonging to the group II have been known for the treatment or prevention of acute and/or chronic neurological disorders such as psychosis, schizophrenia, major depression and Alzheimer's disease. Preferred compounds for use according to the invention are those compounds which act as mGlu2/3 negative allosteric modulators are described in WO 01/290111, WO 01/290122, WO 02/0836523, WO 02/0836654, WO 03/0666235, WO 2005/0140026, WO 2005/0401717, WO 2005/1237388, WO 2006/0846349, WO 2006/09997210, WO 2007/03943911, WO 2007/11033712 and WO 2008/11968913. Autistic Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are a clinically heterogeneous condition characterized by defects in socialization and language. ASD include a wide range of abnormalities including a genuine incapacity to organise affective relations, behavioural anomalies in reciprocal social interactions, verbal and non verbal communication, limited interest in the surrounding environment associated with stereotyped movements and repetitive plays (Bourreau et al, 2009)14. Research to date indicates that a genetic predisposition may be involved, but also environmental factors have to be taken into consideration (Bourgeron, 2009)15. There is at present no efficient biological/pharmaceutical treatment to ASD.

Pharmaceutical Composition A compound of formula I-III as well as their pharmaceutically acceptable salts can be used as medicaments, e.g. in the form of pharmaceutical preparations. The pharmaceutical preparations can be administered orally, e.g. in the form of tablets, coated tablets, dragées, hard and soft gelatin capsules, solutions, emulsions or suspensions. The administration can, however, also be effected rectally, e.g. in the form of suppositories, or parenterally, e.g. in the form of injection solutions. A compound of formulae I-III and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts can be processed with pharmaceutically inert, inorganic or organic excipients for the production of tablets, coated tablets, dragées and hard gelatin capsules. Lactose, corn starch or derivatives thereof, talc, stearic acid or its salts etc. can be used as such excipients e.g. for tablets, dragées and hard gelatin capsules. Suitable excipients for soft gelatin capsules are e.g. vegetable oils, waxes, fats, semisolid and liquid polyols etc. Suitable excipients for the manufacture of solutions and syrups are e.g. water, polyols, saccharose, invert sugar, glucose etc. Suitable excipients for injection solutions are e.g. water, alcohols, polyols, glycerol, vegetable oils etc. Suitable excipients for suppositories are e.g. natural or hardened oils, waxes, fats, semi-liquid or liquid polyols etc. Moreover, the pharmaceutical preparations can contain preservatives, solubilizers, stabilizers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, sweeteners, colorants, flavorants, salts for varying the osmotic pressure, buffers, masking agents or antioxidants. They can also contain still other therapeutically valuable substances. The dosage can vary within wide limits and will, of course, be fitted to the individual requirements in each particular case. In general, in the case of oral administration a daily dosage of about 10 to 1000 mg per person of a compound of formulae I-III should be appropriate, although the above upper limit can also be exceeded when necessary.

EXAMPLES Example 1 BTBR T+tf/J (BTBR)19 is an inbred mouse strain demonstrating a robust behavioral phenotype and is known in the art as a model with possible analogies to the diagnostic symptoms of ASD, in particular autism. Deficits in social interactions and social approach, unusual patterns of ultrasonic vocalization, and high levels of repetitive self-grooming are included.20 3-Chambered Social Test The 3-Chambered Social Test is used to assess autistic-like behaviors. Shortly after a period of habituation a mouse's sociability is determined by evaluating the amount of time the test mouse spends approaching a wire cage (holding cup) containing an unfamiliar mouse. Procedure 48 male mice BTBR-T+/tfj, 8-9 weeks old, were used in the experiments described herein in 4 groups n=12/group. Further, 6 male stimulus mice (unfamiliar BTBR T+tf/J mice) of similar age and weight were used. Low light of 20 Lux was used. With the doorways into the two side chambers closed, the test mouse was placed in the middle chamber and allowed to explore the apparatus for 10 min. Thereafter, the doorways were opened and the test mouse was allowed to explore the entire test box for 10 min. The cages were empty. The sociability test was conducted immediately following the habituation phase. While the test mouse was enclosed in the center compartment of the test box a stimulus mouse was enclosed in a wire cage (holding cup) in one side chamber. The location of the stimulus mouse alternated between the left and right sides of the social test box across subjects. Following placement of the stimulus mouse, the doors were re-opened and the subject mouse was again allowed to explore the entire test box for another 10 minutes. The amount of time spent and the number of entries into each chamber was measured, as was the time spent in a small perimeter around the cup holding the stimulus mouse. Treatment (3 Hours Before Habituation) Vehicle p.o.—0.3% tween80 in 0.9% NaCl mglu 2/3 (IIb) 3-10-30 mg/kg p.o.—0.3% tween80 in 0.9% NaCl Results Mice treated with the mglu 2/3 modulator (IIb) showed an increased social preference, especially observed in the first 5 minutes when dosed at 10 mg/kg. (FIG. 2/3). Example 2 [3H]LY354740 ((+)-2-Aminobicyclo[3.1.0]hexane-2,6-dicarboxylic acid) has been synthesized according to methods known in the art (Malherbe et al.21, Richards et al.22). Materials. [3H]LY354740 (1 S,2S,5R,6S)-2-aminobicyclo[3.1.0]hexane-2,6-dicarboxylate monohydrate (s.a 35 Ci/mmol) was synthesized at F. Hoffmann-La Roche. The selective group II agonist DCG IV ((2S,2′R,3′R)-2-(2′,3′-dicarboxycyclopropyl)glycine) was synthesized at F. Hoffmann-La Roche. For the cross-sectional study, approximately 3 male C57BL/6J and BTBR mice of similar age (C57B1/6 mice were 9w (#8661, sagittal), 4m (#6246, saggital) and 16.5m (#8670, horizontal).) Radioligand Binding to Tissue Sections. Brains were rapidly dissected from anaesthetized mice (5% fluothane for 30 seconds) and immediately frozen in dry-ice. Parasagittal and horizontal cryostat-cut sections (˜12 μm thick) were mounted on pre-cleaned slides and stored at −20° C. until used. [3H]LY354740 binding in vitro. For regional distribution studies, sections were pre-incubated at room temperature (22° C.; 10 min) in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer pH 7.0+EDTA (final volume 130 ml), followed by a further incubation without EDTA and then incubated with 50 nM [3H]LY354740 in the same volume of buffer+2 mM CaCl2 and MgCl2 for 60 minutes at 22° C. This was followed by three washes in 130 ml buffer alone at 4° C. (2×30 sec.+1 min.; optimal rinse time producing the maximal relative specific binding); non-specific binding was determined in the presence of 10 μM DCG IV ((2S,2′R,3′)-2-(2′,3′-dicarboxycyclopropyl)glycine), a group II metabotropic Glutamate Receptor agonist. Quantitative receptor radioautography. Radiolabelled sections were exposed, together with tritium microscales (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, UK), to tritium-sensitive imaging plates (BAS-TR2025) for 4 days and subsequently to Hyperfilm TritiumR (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, UK) for 4 weeks at 4° C. The plates were scanned in a Fujifilm BAS-5000 high resolution phosphor imager and measured with an MCID M2 image analysis system (InterFocus Ltd, Haverhill, UK).
