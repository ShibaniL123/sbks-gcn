EXAMPLES The present invention will be further illustrated in detail by the following examples, which are not intended to restrict the present invention. Example 1 Preparation of Genomic DNA of Penicillium coprobium PF1169 Strain Sterilized NB medium (500 ml) was placed in an Erlenmeyer flask (1 L). Penicillium coprobium PF1169 strain (Journal of Technical Disclosure No. 500997/2008 (Patent Document 3)) precultured in Â½ CMMY agar medium at 28Â° C. for 4 days was added to the above-mentioned medium and subjected to liquid culture at 28Â° C. for 4 days. Filtration was carried out with Miracloth to obtain 5 g of fungal cells. From these fungal cells, 30 Î¼g of genomic DNA was obtained in accordance with the manual attached to genomic DNA purification kit Genomic-tip 100/G (manufactured by Qiagen K.K.). Example 2 Degenerate primers for Amplification of Polyketide Synthase (PKS) and Amplified Fragment Thereof Based on an amino acid sequence conserved among various filamentous fungus polyketide synthases, the following primers were designed and synthesized as degenerate primers for amplification: LC1: GAYCCIMGITTYTTYAAYATG (SEQ ID NO: 1) LC2c: GTICCIGTICCRTGCATYTC (SEQ ID NO: 2) (wherein R=A/G, YâC/T, M=A/C, I=inosine). Using these degenerate primers, the genomic DNA prepared in Example 1 and ExTaq polymerase (manufactured by Takara Bio Inc.) were allowed to react in accordance with the attached manual. An amplified fragment of about 700 bp was detected (FIG. 1). Further then, the above-mentioned amplified fragment was analyzed to specify the sequence of its internal 500 bp (SEQ ID NO:3). Example 3 Large-scale Sequencing of Genomic DNA and Amino Acid Sequence Homology Search The genomic DNA of Penicillium coprobium PF1169 strain obtained in Example 1 was subjected to large-scale sequencing and homology search for amino acid sequences. Specifically, part of 50 Î¼g of genomic DNA was pretreated and thereafter subjected to Roche 454FLX DNA sequencer to obtain about 250 bp, 103 thousands of fragment sequences (in total, 49 Mb of sequence). For these sequences, as known sequences among polyketide synthases and prenyltransferases, the following five sequences (sequences derived from polyketide synthases: Aspergillus (A.) fumigatus PKS 2146 a.a. and Penicillium (P.) griseofluvum 6-methylsalycilic acid synthase 1744 a.a.; as well as prenyltransferases: Aspergillus (A.) fumigatus Prenyltransferase, Aspergillus (A.) fumigatus Prenyltransferase (4-hydroxybezoate octaprenyltransferase) and Penicillium (P.) marneffei Prenyltransferase) were selected and search by homology sequence search software blastx was carried out, thereby obtaining 89, 86, 2, 1 and 3 of homology sequences, respectively (see Table 2). Further, from the homology sequences of A. fumigatus PKS 2146a.a. and P. griseofluvum 6-methylsalycilic acid synthase 1744 a.a., 19 and 23 of contig sequences were respectively obtained (the contig sequences of A. fumigatus PKS 2146 a.a.: SEQ ID NOs:179 to 197; the contig sequences of P. griseofluvum 6-methylsalycilic acid synthase 1744 a.a.: SEQ ID NOs:198 to 220) (see Table 2).

Similarly, for prenyltransferases, 5 types of primer pairs shown in SEQ ID NOs:253 to 262 were synthesized. When PCR was carried out for the genomic DNA using these primers, amplified fragments with the expected size were seen for all of the primer pairs (see FIG. 1 and FIG. 2). Example 5 Construction of Phage Genomic Library A Î» phage genomic library of Penicillium coprobium PF1169 strain was constructed using Î»BlueSTAR Xho I Half-site Arms Kit (manufactured by Takara Bio Inc., Cat. No. 69242-3) in accordance with the attached manual. That is, genomic DNA was partially digested using a restriction enzyme, Sau3A1. The DNA fragment with about 20 kb (0.5 Î¼g) was ligated to 0.5 Î¼g of Î»BlueSTAR DNA attached to the kit. This ligation solution was subjected to in vitro packaging using Lambda INN Packaging kit (manufactured by Nippon Gene Co., Ltd.) based on the manual attached to the kit to obtain 1 ml of a solution. This solution with packaged phages (10 Î¼l) was infected into 100 Î¼l of E. coli ER1647 strain and cultured on a plaque-forming medium at 37Â° C. overnight, thereby obtaining about 500 clones of plaques. Thus, the genomic library composed of about 50000 clones of phages in which 10 to 20 kb genomic DNA of Penicillium coprobium PF1169 strain were introduced by clone infection was constructed. Example 6 Screening from Phage Library For 10000 clones of the phage library prepared in Example 5, the primary screening was carried out by plaque hybridization using, as a probe, the PCR product amplified by LC1-LC2c primer pair prepared above. For labeling and detection of the probe, AlkPhos Direct Labelling and Detection System with CDP-Star (manufactured by GE Healthcare, Cat. No. RPN3690) was used. The above-mentioned hybridization was carried out in accordance with the attached manual. By the primary screening, 6 clones remained as candidates. Further, as the result of the secondary screening by plaque hybridization, 4 clones were obtained. These positive clones were infected into E. coli BM25.8 strain and the phages were converted to plasmids in accordance with the attached manual, thereby obtaining 4 types of plasmids containing a desired region. Example 7 Preparation of Fosmid Genome Library A genomic library of Penicillium coprobium PF1169 strain was constructed in accordance with the manual attached to CopyControl Fosmid Library Production Kit (manufactured by EPICENTRE, Cat. No. CCFOS110). That is, 0.25 Î¼g of DNA fragment of about 40 kb genomic DNA was blunt-ended and then incorporated into fosmid vector pCCFOS (manufactured by Epicentre). This ligation solution was subjected to in vitro packaging using MaxPlax Lambda Packaging Extract attached to the kit based on the manual attached to the kit. This solution with packaged virus (10 Î¼l) was infected into 100 Î¼l of E. coli EPI300â¢-T1Â® strain and cultured on a medium containing chloramphenicol at 37Â° C. overnight and selected, thereby obtaining about 300 clones of colonies. Thus, about 30000 clones of the fosmids in which 40 kb the genomic DNA of Penicillium coprobium PF1169 strain were introduced by infection were obtained. They were aliquoted in a 96 well plate so as to be about 50 clones per well. Thus, the genomic library composed of 96 pools, about 4800 clones was constructed. Example 8 Fosmid Library Screening In accordance with the manual attached to the fosmid, plasmid DNAs were individually prepared from 96 pools of the library prepared in Example 7. Using the degenerate primers for polyketide synthase amplification synthesized in Example 2, PCR was carried out for 96 pools of these plasmid DNA samples. As a result, DNA fragments of about 700 bp were amplified from 9 pools. Further, a petri dish containing colonies of about 300 clones or more was prepared from the positive pools and re-screening was carried out by colony hybridization. As a result, using by LC1-LC2c primer pair, 9 types of fosmids were obtained from about 4800 clones. Example 9 Large-Scale Sequencing of Genomic DNA and Amino Acid Sequence Homology Search Genomic DNA of Penicillium coprobium PF1169 strain obtained in Example 1 was subjected to large-scale sequencing and homology search for amino acid sequences. Specifically, part of 50 Î¼g of genomic DNA was pretreated and then subjected to Roche 454FLX DNA sequencer to obtain 1405 fragment sequences with an average contig length of 19.621 kb (sequence of a total base length of 27.568160 Mb). For these sequences, as known sequences among polyketide synthases and prenyltransferases, the following five sequence (sequences derived from polyketide synthases: Penicillium (P.) griseofluvum 6-methylsalycilic acid synthase 1744 a.a. (P22367) and Aspergillus (A.) fumigatus PKS 2146a.a. (Q4WZA8); as well as prenyltransferases: Penicillium (P.) marneffei Prenyltransferase (Q0MRO8), Aspergillus (A.) fumigatus Prenyltransferase (Q4WBI5) and Aspergillus (A.) fumigatus Prenyltransferase (4-hydroxybezoate octaprenyltransferase) (Q4WLD0)) were selected and search by homology sequence search software blastx was carried out, thereby obtaining 22 (P22367), 21 (Q4WZA8), 2 (Q0MRO8), 3 (Q4WBI5) and 3 (Q4WLD0) of the homologous sequences, respectively. Example 10 Fosmid Library Screening and Sequence Analysis of Cluster Genes In accordance with the manual attached to a fosmid kit (manufactured by EPICENTRE, CopyControl Fosmid Library Production Kit), plasmid DNAs were individually prepared from 96 pools of the library prepared in Example 7. Based on base sequences determined by Roche 454FLX DNA sequencer, homology search for amino acid sequences was carried out to search regions adjacent to polyketide synthase and prenyltransferase. Based on the base sequence of prenyltransferase of the obtained region, a primer pair (No. 27) capable of amplifying 400 bp DNA fragment was synthesized. Using the primers, PCR was carried out for these 48 pools of plasmid DNA samples. As a result, expected DNA fragments of about 400 bp (SEQ ID NO:263) were amplified from 11 pools (see FIG. 3). Further, a petri dish containing colonies of about 300 clones or more was prepared from 6 pools of the positive pools and re-screening was carried out by colony hybridization. As a result, using by 27F+27R primer pair (27F primer: SEQ ID NO:264, 27R primer: SEQ ID NO:265), 4 types of fosmids were obtained from about 4800 clones. One of them was named pCC1-PP1 and the entire sequence of the inserted fragment was determined (SEQ ID NO:266). The obtained pCC1-PP1 was transformed into Escherichia coli EPI300â¢-T1Â® strain (attached to the fosmid kit), thereby obtaining Escherichia coli EPI300â¢-T1Â® strain/pCC1-PP1. When a homology search was carried out between the above-mentioned sequence of SEQ ID NO:266 and each of CoA ligase; LovB-like polyketide synthase (PKS); Cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, Cyclase (IMP: Integral membrane protein), FAD-dependent monooxygenase (FMO), which are hydroxylases; UbiA-like prenyltransferase (UbiAPT); Acetyltransferase (AT), Acetyltransferase-2 (AT-2), which are acetyltransferases; and Cation transporting ATPase (the above-mentioned enzymes are all derived from Aspergillus fumigatus Af293 strain), a high homology of 70% or more was seen in any search.

From this petri dish, conidia (>108) were collected and seeded in 100 ml of YPD liquid medium in a 500 ml-flask. After 20-hour culturing (30Â° C., 180 rpm), fungal cells having a moss ball shape were obtained. The fungal cells were collected with a 3G-1 glass filter, washed with 0.8 M NaCl, and water was removed well.
