(104-2) Synthesis of tert-butyl {3-[(tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy]-1-oxo-1-{2-[4-(trifluoromethoxy)benzoyl]hydrazinyl}propan-2-yl}carbamate (Compound 104-2)
To a solution of tert-butyl (3-hydroxy-1-oxo-1-{2-[4-(trifluoromethoxy)benzoyl]hydrazinyl}propan-2-yl)carbamate (1 g) and imidazole (836 mg) in dichloromethane (50 mL) was added tert-butyldimethylsilyl chloride (740 mg) with stirring at room temperature and the mixture was stirred for 18 hours. After completion of the reaction, the reaction solution was washed with saturated brine (30 mL Ã— 2), and the organic layer was dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate. The solvent was evaporated off under reduced pressure, and the resulting residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (hexane-ethyl acetate) to obtain the title compound (1.2 g, yield 94%).
