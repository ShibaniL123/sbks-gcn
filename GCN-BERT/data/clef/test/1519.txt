Synthesis of compound 50-d
85% Hydrazine hydrate (2mL) was added to a solution of compound 50-e (1.60g, 7mmol) in isopropyl alcohol (40mL). The mixture was heated to reflux for 2hrs, cooled to room temperature, white solid was precipitated and filtered out. The solid was washed with water (20mLÃ—3), dried under vacuum to give compound 50-d (1.2g, yield 76%). The product was used directly for the next step without further purification.
