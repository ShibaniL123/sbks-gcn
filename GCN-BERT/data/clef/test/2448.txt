(104-3) Synthesis of tert-butyl {2-[(tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy]-1-{5-[4[(trifluoromethoxy)phenyl]-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl]ethyl}carbamate (Compound 104-3)
The Burgess reagent (1.1 g) was added to a solution of tert-butyl {3-[(tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy]-1-oxo-1- {2-[4-(trifluoromethoxy)benzoyl]hydrazinyl}propan-2-yl}carbamate (1.2 g) in dehydrated dichloromethane (15 mL) with stirring at room temperature and the mixture was stirred for 4 hours. After the reaction completed, water was added to the reaction solution to stop the reaction. The reaction solution was diluted with dichloromethane (30 mL) and washed with saturated brine (30 mL Ã— 2). The organic layer was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and evaporated under reduced pressure, and the obtained residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (hexane-acetone) to obtain the title compound 700 mg (yield 60%).
