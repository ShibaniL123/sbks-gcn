PROCESSES FOR MAKING MACNOLOL DERIVATIVES BACKGROUND [00011 There is a need for safe, effective antibacterial and anti-inflammatory agents for use in oral care compositions. Magnolia extract is known to contain compounds having antibacterial and/or anti-inflammatory properties, and such, compounds have been the focus of considerable interest for use- in 'oral care compositions. The use of such compounds in oral care compositi ons is: described, for example, in WOTOOl/085116, WO 2011/106492 and WO 1011/106493, the contents of which application are incorporated herein by reference. Methods of synthesizing magneto! are disclosed, e,g, in WO 2011/106003, Synthetic non-natural, analogs of various components of magnoli a extract are also known, to have antibacterial activity, but the compounds are in some cases expensive to synthesize, (0Θ02); Isomagnoiol (3,3'-diallyl-:biph:enyl~2,2'-dioi) and tetrahydro-isomagnoiol, (3,3vdipropyibiphenyS-2,2 vdiol), are broad spectrum antibacterial: and anti-inflammatory agents with potential applications in oral care and: personal care products. Existing synthetie methods involve costly reagents and poor yields. There is a need for simple, high yield synthetie procedures to make such compounds, [llOOlAj Any discussion of documents, acts, materials, devices*, articles or the like which has been included in the present specification is not to he taken as an admission that any or all of these matters form part of the prior art base or were common general knowledge in the field relevant to the present disclosure as it existed before the priority date of each claim of this application, [0002Β] Throughout this specification the word ’'comprise", or variations such as "comprises" or '’comprising", will be understood to: imply the inclusion of a stated element, integer or step, or group of elements, integers or steps, but not the exclusion of any other element, integer or step, or group of elements, integers or steps.
