HAY FEEDER FOR LARGE SQUARE BALES BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention. This invention relates to the field of hay feeders for livestock such as horses and cattle and more particularly to the field of such feeders for handling large square bales. 2. Discussion of the Background. Hay bales for livestock such as horses and cattle have evolved over the years from relatively small bales (e.g., 16 inches by 18 inches by 3 feet weighing 40-60 pounds) that could easily be lifted manually by one person to very large round bales (e.g., 6 foot diameter by 5 feet wide weighing on the order of 1500 pounds) and large square bales (e.g., 3x3x8 feet weighing about 700-800 pounds) that require loaders and other equipment to lift and manipulate. The trend to larger bales was mostly a result of rising labor costs but other factors were also involved. Although large round bales have been and remain in widespread use because they can be left uncovered if desired in the field without significant deterioration, large square bales are becoming more popular. In this last regard, the price of hay has risen dramatically over the recent years to the extent that even though round bales were previously considered not to significantly deteriorate (e.g., the outer few inches would weather and form somewhat of a protective layer), even such relatively small deterioration still could represent 10 percent or more of the total dry matter of the bale. Consequently and although large square bales normally need to be stacked and covered, the waste is usually then limited and much less in comparison to round bales left uncovered in the field. Handling large square bales on the order of 3x3x8 feet and 700-800 pounds still does require equipment to lift and manipulate the bales but there is need for a hay feeder for large square bales that can be easily loaded and operated by one person with very little hay waste. With this and other things in mind, the present invention was developed. In it, a hay feeder is provided that can handle large square bales and can be easily loaded and operated to feed livestock by one person. In one mode of operation, the small and usually busy rancher or horse owner can have an individual bale loaded onto the bed of a truck at the hay seller's site after which the rancher or owner can return to his or her ranch and unload the bale from the truck bed into the feeder by himself or herself saving both time and money. In another mode and if the rancher or owner has a loader, he or she can still easily manipulate the large square bale without anyone else's help into the feeder where it is supported in a vertical position for feeding to the livestock from the lower end section of the vertical bale. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION This invention involves a hay feeder for large square bales (e.g., 3'x3'x8' ones weighting on the order of 700-800 pounds). The feeder is designed to be operable by one person to load the bale into the feeder. The feeder has an elongated chute with four, vertical side members. In use, one of the side members can be pivoted downwardly to a substantially horizontal position and the elongated hay bale positioned on it. The side member can then be raised back to its vertical position to lift the hay bale with it to a vertical position within the elongated chute. The chute and bale have respective upper and lower end sections and the chute has openings at its lower end section to provide access through them to the lower end section of the hay bale. Cover members are also provided to selectively cover and uncover the openings to selectively permit and prevent access through them by the livestock.

Figure 7 is a front perspective view of the hay feeder similar to Figure 3 with the cover member for the one side member pivoted downwardly. Figures 8-10 together with Figure 7 sequentially show the one side member being pivotally lowered from its vertical closed position of Figure 7 to its horizontal open position of Figure 10. Figure 11 is a perspective view from the right side of Figure 10. Figure 12 illustrates a manner in which a large square bale can be loaded onto the lowered side member of the hay feeder. Figures 13-18 sequentially show how the hay bale of Figure 12 can be drawn toward and lifted up into the hay feeder. Figures 19-24 sequentially show how a hay bale can be loaded onto the lowered side member of the chute of the hay feeder directly from the bed of a pickup truck. Figures 25-29 illustrate another manner in which the hay bale can be loaded onto the lowered side member of the chute when the bed of the pickup truck is significantly lower than the horizontal position of the side member. Figure 30 is a view of the cover members for selectively permitting and preventing access to the lower end section of the chute and the grate in the lower section of the chute in which the cover members are slidingly rather than pivotally mounted as in Figure 5. Figure 31 illustrates another embodiment of the lifting arrangement for the pivoting side member in which it is motor driven and can be directly or remotely controlled if desired. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Figure 1 is a rear perspective view of the hay feeder 1 of the present invention. Figure 2 is a side view of the hay feeder 1 and Figure 3 is a front perspective view. As shown, the hay feeder 1 preferably has four side members 3,5,7,9 extending substantially vertically to form the upper section of an elongated chute 11. The lower section of the chute 11 as illustrated has a grate 13 of inwardly and downwardly inclined bars 15 positioned therein (see also Figure 4). In operation as explained in more detail below and with the cover members 21 pivoted upwardly and held in place (e.g., by the hooks at 23 - see also Figure 5), lower openings are then created below each side member 3,5,7,9 to provide access to the lower end section of the chute 11 and grate 13. Each of the four openings as illustrated in Figures 4 and 5 is essentially defined by frame members 25 (Figure 4) but could be defined by other structure including the sets of inclined bars 15 on each of the four sides of the grate 13. The elongated chute 11 of the hay feeder 1 of Figures 1-3 extends along and about a substantially vertical axis 31 (see also Figure 6a which is a plan view taken along line 6a-6a of Figure 2). The side members 3,5,7,9 in turn have respective substantially flat or planar interior surfaces 3', 5', 7', 9' (Figure 6a). The interior surfaces 3', 5', 7', 9' as shown extend along and face inwardly toward the vertical axis 31 and together form the interior of the elongated chute 11. At least one of the side members (e.g., 7 in Figures 7-10) is mounted for pivotal movement about a substantially horizontal axis 33 as illustrated from a closed position (Figure 7) with the interior surface T of Figure 6a extending substantially vertically to a substantially horizontal or open position (Figure 10) with the interior surface 7' facing upwardly. To assist in lowering the side member 7, the winch or ratchet 35 of Figures 1 and 6a is provided on the opposite side member 3 from the pivoting side member 7 of the chute 11 (see Figure 1). As shown, a cable 37 then runs up from the ratchet 35 in Figure 1 over the pulley 39 and is attached at its cable end sections 37' (see Figures 6a) to opposite corner sections 41 of the side member 7 at locations spaced from the pivotal axis 33 (see Figures 8-10). ln one mode of operation and with the side member 7 in its lowered, open position of Figures 10-11 with the leg 51 supporting the side member 7 in this open position, the cable 37 and its end sections 37' can be moved or draped to the side of member 7 as in Figure 12. A large square bale 2 (e.g., 3'x3'x8' weighing on the order of 700-800 pounds) can then be loaded onto the side member 7, the cable 37 and end sections 37' manually positioned about the outer end section 2' of the bale 2 (Figure 13), and the ratchet 35 operated to draw the bale 2 inwardly along the upper surface 7' of the side member 7 toward the chute 11 to the position of Figure 14a. In doing so, the cable end sections 37' are positioned as in Figure 14b over the end section 2' of the bale 2. Continued operation of the ratchet 35 as in Figures 15-18 will then lift the side member 7 and bale 2 to place the bale 2 in a substantially vertical position within the elongated chute 11 (Figure 18). The hay bale 2 in this regard is a large, elongated one (3'χ3'χ8') with a substantially "square" cross section and extending along an axis 53 (Figures 13 and 14a). The cross section substantially perpendicular to the axis 53 can actually vary from a perfect square (e.g., 3'x3' to 3'x4') and still be referred to in the industry as a "square" bale primarily to distinguish it from a round bale. It could also have a larger square cross section (e.g., 4'x4'). In any event and in the position of Figures 13 and 14a, the axis 53 of the bale 2 extends substantially horizontally to intersect the substantially vertical axis 31 of the chute 11 wherein the bale 2 is then raised by the lifting arrangement including the ratchet 35 and cable members 37,37' to the vertical position of Figure 18 within the chute 11. In this position, the upper and lower end sections of the bale 2 are vertically spaced from each other and the chute axis 31 and bale axis 53 both extend substantially vertically (Figure 18) to be preferably substantially aligned (e.g., parallel or even collinear) with each other. Also, in this position of Figure 18 and with the baling wire 12 cut and removed, the lower cover member 21 below the side member 7 can then be pivoted upwardly (see Figure 5) to provide openings and access by the livestock to all four sides of the lower end section of the chute 11 and lower end section of the bale 2. Alternatively, one or more of the cover members 21 can be lowered to prevent access by the livestock to one or more or all of the sides of the chute 11 and bale 2. The four chute openings and bale side portions in this regard are preferably orthogonal to each other about the respective axes 31 ,53 in Figure 18. Consequently, the cover members 21 can be raised or lowered as desired to control whether the livestock have access for example to adjacent (i.e., perpendicular) or opposite (i.e., parallel) sides of the bale 2 or any combination thereof. An advantage of the hay feeder 1 of the present invention is that it supports the bale 2 vertically as in Figure 18. The flakes or slices 55 (e.g., 3'x3'x2") of the bale 2 of Figure 14a with their substantially flat, short sides 57 are then stacked atop one another (Figure 18) like slices in a loaf of bread. The flakes 55 of Figure 18 thus extend with their cross sections (e.g., 3'x3') substantially perpendicular to the bale axis 53. Additionally, the substantially flat, short sides 57 (e.g., 2"-4") of the flakes 55 of the lower end section of the bale 2 in Figure 18 then extend laterally across one or more of the axes 17 of the grate bars 15. In this manner, the livestock cannot wastefully pull out large chucks or complete flakes 55 of the hay at a time and must work somewhat to remove the hay from the lower end section of the bale 2. This is the case whether the bars 15 are spaced (e.g., 9-10 inches apart) as shown for horses or spaced farther apart for cattle. Also, the lower end section of the chute 11 and grate 13 are supported on the upper surface 61 of the table 63 (see Figures 1 , 4, and 11). Excess hay pulled out by the livestock will then fall onto the upper table surface 61 (Figure 11) and not fall onto the ground and be wasted (i.e., not eaten). The surrounding, raised guard rail 65 of the table 63 also enhances this capturing of the excess hay pulled out by the livestock. The table 63 could be on the order of 7'x7' and 30 inches high off the ground with the guard rail 65 about six inches high. Additionally, the vertical positioning of the bale 2 (Figure 18) within the elongated chute 11 in combination with the inwardly inclined bars 15 of the grate 13 (Figures 4 and 18) serve to inwardly compress the hay which further increases the work the livestock need to do to pull out hay from the exposed, lower end section of the bale 2. This is the case as the livestock initially feed and as the lower end section of the bale 2 is continually being eaten away by them and the bale 2 continually slides downwardly presenting a new lower end section within the grate 3. The side members 3,5,7,9 forming the upper section of the chute 11 in this regard are preferably about six feet high and four feet wide. Consequently, the 4'x4' cross section of the elongated chute 11 formed by the side members is substantially the same size and shape as the cross section of the bale 2 and will substantially support and maintain the bale 2 substantially vertically initially (Figure 18) and as it is eaten away and slides downwardly. The bars 15 of the grate 13 are downwardly and inwardly inclined in the lower section of the chute 11 from a cross section of about 4'x4' to 2'x2' and in part support the lower end section of the vertical bale 2 within the chute 11. The cross section is shown as being square but could be rectangular or substantially circular. The table top 61 also preferably extends across the lower end section of the chute 11 below the grate 13 (see Figure 4) and can at least also partially support the lower end section of the bale 2 if necessary. The lower end section of the chute 11 at the grate 13 and the lowered cover members 21 are about two feet high wherein the total height of the chute 11 is then about 8 feet. The side members 3,5,7,9 are shown as being supported within exterior frame members but could be supported in other manners or additional frame members could be added and used to form the side members 3,5,7,9 of the chute 11 although solid side members are preferred in order to keep out the weather including rain and wind. In a second mode of operation that is particularly advantageous to a small and usually busy rancher or horse owner, the hay feeder 1 of the present invention can be loaded without the need of the lifter 4 of Figure 12. In this mode, the rancher or horse owner can have an individual bale 2 (e.g., 3'x3'x8' weighing on the order of 700-800 pounds) loaded onto the bed 8 of his or her truck 10 at the hay seller's site. The rancher or horse owner can then return to his or her ranch and align the truck 10 as in Figure 19 with the truck bed 8 substantially even with the lowered side member 7 of the hay feeder 1. The cable end sections 37' can subsequently be unhooked at 45 (see Figure 20) from the lowered side member 7 and respectively attached to the baling wire 12 of the bale 2 (Figure 21). Thereafter, the rancher or horse owner can operate the ratchet 35 to pull the bale 2 onto the upper surface 7' of the lowered side member 7 (Figure 22) toward and into the elongated chute 11 (Figure 23). The cable end sections 37' can subsequently be unhooked from the baling wire 12 and re-hooked over the end section of the bale 2 to the side member 7 at 45 as in Figure 24. From this position, the sequence of Figures 14a-18 can then be repeated to lift and load the elongated bale 2 into the chute 11. In yet another mode of operation and should it not be possible to horizontally align the truck bed 8 with the horizontally extending side member 7 (see Figure 25), the support leg 51 (which is preferably telescoping with segments 51 ',51") can be vertically collapsed as shown to further lower the side member 7 below the horizontal. Thereafter and with the cable end sections 37' respectively attached to the baling wire 12 of the bale 2 as in Figure 21 , the ratchet 35 can be operated to pull the bale 2 onto and up the inclined side member 7 (Figures 25-29). From there, the cable end sections 37' can be detached or unhooked from the baling wire and re-hooked over the end section 2' of the bale 2 to the side member 7 as in Figure 24 and the ratchet 35 operated as in Figures 14a-18 to load the bale 2 into the chute 11. To assist in this mode of operation and prevent the bale 2 from sliding downwardly on the inclined side member 7 of Figure 29 as the cable end sections 37' are unhooked from the bailing wire and re-hooked over the bale 2 to the side member 7, one or more one-way, spring-biased catches 71 (Figures 25-27) can be provided on the surface 7' of the side member 7. The support leg 51 of Figures 25-29 could be telescoping in the earlier embodiments as well to aid in the operation of the hay feeder 1 on uneven ground or where the truck bed 8 and lowered side member 7 do not quite align horizontally. Regardless, the leg 51 will pivot outwardly of the side member 7 (Figures 7-10) about a substantially horizontal axis 73 (Figures 7-8) as side member 7 is lowered and upwardly to substantially abut the exterior surface of the side member 7 (Figure 7) when the side member 7 is raised back to its vertical position. Also, the member 37 with its end sections 37' is described for convenience as being a cable but it could be any elongated member that was strong enough to raise the side member 7 with the bale 2 on it into the chute 11. The cover members 21 are also illustrated as being pivotally mounted but could be mounted to be slide up and down as in Figure 30. Further, the ratchet 35 of the hay feeder 1 is shown as being manually operated but it could be motor driven as in Figure 31 with the motor 67 controlled at 69 adjacent the motor 67 and/or by a removable and wireless remote 75.
