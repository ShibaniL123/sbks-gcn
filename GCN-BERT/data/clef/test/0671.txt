(E)-3-(3,5-difluoro-4-((5S,7R/5R,7S)-6-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-2,7-dimethyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrooxazolo[5,4-g]isoquinolin-5-yl)phenyl)acrylic acid
Step 1
(E)-methyl3-(3,5-difluoro-4-((1S,3R/1R,3S)-2-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-6-hydroxy-3-methyl-7-nitro-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-1-yl)phenyl)acrylate
(E)-methyl 3-(3,5-difluoro-4-((1S,3R/1R,3S)-2-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-6-hydroxy-3-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-1-yl)phenyl)acrylate 3c (1.3 g, 3 mmol) was dissolved in 13 mL of acetic acid, then nitric acid (189 mg, 3.6 mmol) was added. The reaction solution was stirred for 30 minutes at room temperature. Ice water was added into the reaction solution, and ammonia was added until the pH is alkaline. The reaction solution was extracted with dichloromethane. The organic phase was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure, and the resulting residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography with elution system B to obtain the title compound (E)-methyl 3-(3,5-difluoro-4-((1S,3R/1R,3S)-2-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-6-hydroxy-3-methyl-7-ni tro-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-1-yl)phenyl)acrylate 80a (460 mg, yield 32%) as a yellow oil.
