Third Step: Synthesis of Compound 5
4.0 g (8.98 mol) of Intermediate 7, 3.58 g (8.98 mol) of Intermediate 8, 3.10 g (22.45 mol) of potassium carbonate, and 0.31 g (0.27 mmol) of tetrakis(triphenylphosphine) palladium (0) were added to 30 mL of 1,4-dioxane and 15 mL of water in a 100 mL flask, and the mixture was heated under a nitrogen flow for 12 hours at 80Â° C. When a reaction was complete, a mixture obtained by removing an organic layer therefrom was added to 100 mL of methanol, and a solid crystallized therein was filtered, dissolved in toluene, filtered with silica gel/Celite, and after removing an appropriate amount of an organic solvent, recrystallized with methanol to obtain Compound 5 (4.03 g, a yield of 70%).
