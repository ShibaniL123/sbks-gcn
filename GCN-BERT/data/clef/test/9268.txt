The fourth step
To a solution of Compound 4 (25 mg, 0.056 mmol) in ethanol (2 mL) and THF (2 mL) was added 2 mol / L aqueous sodium hydroxide solution (0.279mL, 0.58mmol), and the mixture was heated under reflux and stirred for 4.5 hours. The reaction mixture was extracted with chloroform after addition of 2 mol / L hydrochloric acid. The organic layer was washed with water, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (chloroform - methanol) to yield Compound I-6 (20 mg, yield 83%).
