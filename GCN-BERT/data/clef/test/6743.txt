COMBINATIONS OF AN FGFR INHIBITOR AND AN IGF1 R INHIBITOR Field of the invention The invention relates to a combination of a FGFR inhibitor and an IGFIR inhibitor. The combination is for use in the treatment of a proliferative disorder, in particular for use in the treatment of cancer. The FGFR inhibitor and the IGFR inhibitor can be administered simultaneously, separately or sequentially. The invention further relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and a combination according to the invention. Summary of the invention The present invention relates to a combination of a first compound which is a FGFR inhibitor, and a second compound which is an IGFIR inhibitor. It was found that a combination of a first compound which is a FGFR inhibitor, and a second compound which is an IGFIR inhibitor is useful for the prevention of resistance of a tumour or a cancer to the FGFR inhibitor of the combination, or for the delay of resistance of a tumour or a cancer to the FGFR inhibitor of the combination. Background of the invention FGFR The fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family of protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) receptors regulates a diverse array of physiologic functions including mitogenesis, wound healing, cell differentiation and angiogenesis, and development. Both normal and malignant cell growth as well as proliferation are affected by changes in local concentration of FGFs, extracellular signalling molecules which act as autocrine as well as paracrine factors. Autocrine FGF signalling may be particularly important in the progression of steroid hormone-dependent cancers to a hormone independent state. FGFs and their receptors are expressed at increased levels in several tissues and cell lines and overexpression is believed to contribute to the malignant phenotype. Furthermore, a number of oncogenes are homologues of genes encoding growth factor receptors, and there is a potential for aberrant activation of FGF-dependent signalling in human pancreatic cancer (Knights et al, Pharmacology and Therapeutics 2010 125: 1 (105-117); Korc M. et al Current Cancer Drug Targets 2009 9:5 (639-651)). The two prototypic members are acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF or FGF1) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF or FGF2), and to date, at least twenty distinct FGF family members have been identified. The cellular response to FGFs is transmitted via four types of high affinity transmembrane protein tyrosine-kinase fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFR) numbered 1 to 4 (FGFR1 to FGFR4). Disruption of the FGFR1 pathway should affect tumor cell proliferation since this kinase is activated in many tumor types in addition to proliferating endothelial cells. The over-expression and activation of FGFR1 in tumor- associated vasculature has suggested a role for these molecules in tumor angiogenesis. A recent study has shown a link between FGFR1 expression and tumorigenicity in Classic Lobular Carcinomas (CLC). CLCs account for 10-15% of all breast cancers and, in general, lack p53 and Her2 expression whilst retaining expression of the oestrogen receptor. A gene amplification of 8pl2-pl 1.2 was demonstrated in -50% of CLC cases and this was shown to be linked with an increased expression of FGFR1. Preliminary studies with siRNA directed against FGFR1, or a small molecule inhibitor of the receptor, showed cell lines harbouring this amplification to be particularly sensitive to inhibition of this signalling pathway. Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is the most common pediatric soft tissue sarcoma likely results from abnormal proliferation and differentiation during skeletal myogenesis. FGFR1 is over-expressed in primary rhabdomyosarcoma tumors and is associated with hypomethylation of a 5' CpG island and abnormal expression of the AKT1, NOG, and BMP4 genes. FGFR1 has also been linked to squamous lung cancer, colorectal cancer, glioblastoma, astrocytomas, prostate cancer, small cell lung cancer, melanoma, head and neck cancer, thyroid cancer, uterine cancer. Fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 has high affinity for the acidic and/or basic fibroblast growth factors, as well as the keratinocyte growth factor ligands. Fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 also propagates the potent osteogenic effects of FGFs during osteoblast growth and differentiation. Mutations in fibroblast growth factor receptor 2, leading to complex functional alterations, were shown to induce abnormal ossification of cranial sutures (craniosynostosis), implying a major role of FGFR signalling in intramembranous bone formation. For example, in Apert (AP) syndrome, characterized by premature cranial suture ossification, most cases are associated with point mutations engendering gain-of- function in fibroblast growth factor receptor 2. In addition, mutation screening in patients with syndromic craniosynostoses indicates that a number of recurrent FGFR2 mutations accounts for severe forms of Pfeiffer syndrome. Particular mutations of FGFR2 include W290C, D321A, Y340C, C342R, C342S, C342W, N549H, K641R in FGFR2. Several severe abnormalities in human skeletal development, including Apert, Crouzon, Jackson- Weiss, Beare-Stevenson cutis gyrata, and Pfeiffer syndromes are associated with the occurrence of mutations in fibroblast growth factor receptor 2. Most, if not all, cases of Pfeiffer Syndrome (PS) are also caused by de novo mutation of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 gene, and it was recently shown that mutations in fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 break one of the cardinal rules governing ligand specificity. Namely, two mutant splice forms of fibroblast growth factor receptor, FGFR2c and FGFPv2b, have acquired the ability to bind to and be activated by atypical FGF ligands. This loss of ligand specificity leads to aberrant signalling and suggests that the severe phenotypes of these disease syndromes result from ectopic ligand-dependent activation of fibroblast growth factor receptor 2. Genetic aberrations of the FGFR3 receptor tyrosine kinase such as chromosomal translocations or point mutations result in ectopically expressed or deregulated, constitutively active, FGFR3 receptors. Such abnormalities are linked to a subset of multiple myelomas and in bladder, hepatocellular, oral squamous cell carcinoma and cervical carcinomas. Accordingly, FGFR3 inhibitors would be useful in the treatment of multiple myeloma, bladder and cervical carcinomas. FGFR3 is also over-expressed in bladder cancer, in particular invasive bladder cancer. FGFR3 is frequently activated by mutation in urothelial carcinoma (UC). Increased expression was associated with mutation (85% of mutant tumors showed high-level expression) but also 42% of tumors with no detectable mutation showed over-expression, including many muscle-invasive tumors. FGFR3 is also linked to endometrial and thyroid cancer. Over expression of FGFR4 has been linked to poor prognosis in both prostate and thyroid carcinomas. In addition a germline polymorphism (Gly388Arg) is associated with increased incidence of lung, breast, colon, liver (HCC) and prostate cancers. In addition, a truncated form of FGFR4 (including the kinase domain) has also been found to be present in 40% of pituitary tumours but not present in normal tissue. FGFR4 overexpression has been observed in liver, colon and lung tumours. FGFR4 has been implicated in colorectal and liver cancer where expression of its ligand FGF 19 is frequently elevated. FGFR4 is also linked to astrocytomas, rhabdomyosarcoma. Fibrotic conditions are a major medical problem resulting from abnormal or excessive deposition of fibrous tissue. This occurs in many diseases, including liver cirrhosis, glomerulonephritis, pulmonary fibrosis, systemic fibrosis, rheumatoid arthritis, as well as the natural process of wound healing. The mechanisms of pathological fibrosis are not fully understood but are thought to result from the actions of various cytokines (including tumor necrosis factor (TNF), fibroblast growth factors (FGF's), platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) and transforming growth factor beta. (TGF ) involved in the proliferation of fibroblasts and the deposition of extracellular matrix proteins (including collagen and fibronectin). This results in alteration of tissue structure and function and subsequent pathology. A number of preclinical studies have demonstrated the up-regulation of fibroblast growth factors in preclinical models of lung fibrosis. TGF i and PDGF have been reported to be involved in the fibrogenic process and further published work suggests the elevation of FGF's and consequent increase in fibroblast proliferation, may be in response to elevated TGF 1. The potential therapeutic benefit of targeting the fibrotic mechanism in conditions such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is suggested by the reported clinical effect of the anti- fibrotic agent pirfenidone . Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (also referred to as Cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis) is a progressive condition involving scarring of the lung. Gradually, the air sacs of the lungs become replaced by fibrotic tissue, which becomes thicker, causing an irreversible loss of the tissue's ability to transfer oxygen into the bloodstream. The symptoms of the condition include shortness of breath, chronic dry coughing, fatigue, chest pain and loss of appetite resulting in rapid weight loss. The condition is extremely serious with approximately 50% mortality after 5 years. As such, the compounds which inhibit FGFR will be useful in providing a means of preventing the growth or inducing apoptosis in tumours, particularly by inhibiting angiogenesis. It is therefore anticipated that the compounds will prove useful in treating or preventing proliferative disorders such as cancers. In particular tumours with activating mutants of receptor tyrosine kinases or upregulation of receptor tyrosine kinases may be particularly sensitive to the inhibitors. Patients with activating mutants of any of the iso forms of the specific RTKs (receptor tyrosine kinases) discussed herein may also find treatment with RTK inhibitors particularly beneficial.

They are described as inhibitors or modulators of the activity of certain protein tyrosine kinases, in particular FGFR, and thus the compounds are useful in the treatment or prophylaxis, in particular the treatment, of disease states or conditions mediated by those tyrosine kinases, in particular FGFR. The compounds are useful in the treatment or prophylaxis, in particular the treatment, of cancer. In WO2011/135376 present compound A is also exemplified as a hydrochloride salt. In WO2013/061080 present compound B is also exemplified as a sulfate salt, as a hydrochloride salt, as a phosphate salt, as a lactate salt, as a fumarate salt. The FGFR kinase inhibitors compound A and B described herein have a differentiated selectivity profile which provides a new opportunity to use these targeted agents in patient sub-groups whose disease is driven by FGFR deregulation. The FGFR kinase inhibitors compound A and B described herein exhibit reduced inhibitory action on additional kinases, particularly VEGFR, more in particular VEGFR2, and PDGFR, in particular PDGFR-beta, and offer the opportunity to have a differentiated side-effect or toxicity profile and as such allow for a more effective treatment of these indications. Inhibitors of VEGFR2 and PDGFR-beta are associated with toxicities such as hypertension or oedema respectively. In the case of VEGFR2 inhibitors this hypertensive effect is often dose limiting, may be contraindicated in certain patient populations and requires clinical management. The FGFR kinase inhibitors compound A and B described herein are FGFR1, 2, 3 and 4 inhibitors. Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor (VEGFR) Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a polypeptide, is mitogenic for endothelial cells in vitro and stimulates angiogenic responses in vivo. VEGF has also been linked to inappropriate angiogenesis. VEGFR(s) are protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs). PTKs catalyze the phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues in proteins involved in cell function thus regulating cell growth, survival and differentiation. Three PTK receptors for VEGF have been identified: VEGFR- 1 (Flt-1) ; VEGFR-2 (Flk-1 or KDR) and VEGFR-3 (Flt-4). These receptors are involved in angiogenesis and participate in signal transduction. Of particular interest is VEGFR-2, which is a transmembrane receptor PTK expressed primarily in endothelial cells. Activation of VEGFR-2 by VEGF is a critical step in the signal transduction pathway that initiates tumour angiogenesis. VEGF expression may be constitutive to tumour cells and can also be upregulated in response to certain stimuli. One such stimuli is hypoxia, where VEGF expression is upregulated in both tumour and associated host tissues. The VEGF ligand activates VEGFR-2 by binding with its extracellular VEGF binding site. This leads to receptor dimerization of VEGFRs and autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues at the intracellular kinase domain of VEGFR- 2. The kinase domain operates to transfer a phosphate from ATP to the tyrosine residues, thus providing binding sites for signalling proteins downstream of VEGFR-2 leading ultimately to initiation of angiogenesis. PDGFR A malignant tumour is the product of uncontrolled cell proliferation. Cell growth is controlled by a delicate balance between growth-promoting and growth- inhibiting factors. In normal tissue the production and activity of these factors results in differentiated cells growing in a controlled and regulated manner that maintains the normal integrity and functioning of the organ. The malignant cell has evaded this control; the natural balance is disturbed (via a variety of mechanisms) and unregulated, aberrant cell growth occurs. A growth factor of importance in tumour development is the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) that comprises a family of peptide growth factors that signal through cell surface tyrosine kinase receptors (PDGFR) and stimulate various cellular functions including growth, proliferation, and differentiation. *) BGJ398 (3-(2,6-dichloro-3, 5-dimethoxyphenyl)-l-[6-[4-(4-ethylpiperazin-l- yl)anilino]pyrimidin-4- yl]-l-methylurea) having the following formula *) AZD-4547 (N-(5-(3,5-dimethoxyphenethyl)-lH-pyrazol-3-yl)-4-((3S,5R)-3,5- dimethylpiperazin-l-yl)benzamide) having the following formula *) PD 173074 (N-[2-[[4-(Diethylamino)butyl]amino]-6-(3,5- dimethoxyphenyl)pyrido[2,3-(i]pyrimidin-7-yl]-N'-(l , l-dimethylethyl)urea) having the following formula *) LY-2874455 ((R,E)-2-(4-(2-(5-(l-(3,5-dichloropyridin-4-yl)ethoxy)-lH-indazol- 3-yl)vinyl)-lH-pyrazol-l-yl)ethanol) having the following formula *) Brivanib (alaninate) (S)-(R)-l-((4-((4-fluoro-2-methyl-lH-indol-5-yl)oxy)-5- methylpyrrolo[2, 1 -fj [ 1 ,2,4]triazin-6-yl)oxy)propan-2-yl 2-aminopropanoate. *) Intedanib *) Cediranib *) Orantinib *) Ponatinib (AP24534) *) E-7080 (lenvatinib) *) BAY1163877, TAS-120, ARQ087, ASP5878, FF284, *) Antibodies or related compounds, such as for example HGS1036/FP-1039; MFGR1877S; AV-370; GP369/AV-396b; HuGAL-FR21; monoclonal antibodies (BAY1179470, RG-7444). IGFIR The insulin-like growth factors, also known as somatomedins, include insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and insulin-like growth factor-II (IGF-II). These growth factors exert mitogenic activity on various cell types, including tumor cells, by binding to a common receptor named the insulin-like growth factor receptor-1 (IGFIR). IGFIR belongs to the large class of tyrosine kinase receptors. Interaction of IGFs with IGFIR activates the receptor by triggering autophosphorylation of the receptor on tyrosine residues. Once activated, IGFIR, in turn, phosphorylates intracellular targets to activate cellular signaling pathways. This receptor activation is critical for stimulation of tumor cell growth and survival. Therefore, inhibition of IGFIR activity represents a valuable potential method to treat or prevent growth of human cancers and other proliferative diseases. Several lines of evidence indicate that IGF-I, IGF-II and their receptor IGFIR are important mediators of the malignant phenotype. Plasma levels of IGF-I have been found to be the strongest predictor of prostate cancer risk and similar epidemiological studies strongly link plasma IGF-I levels with breast, colon and lung cancer risk. Overexpression of Insulin- like Growth Factor Receptor-1 has also been demonstrated in several cancer cell lines and tumor tissues. IGFIR is overexpressed in 40% of all breast cancer cell lines and in 15% of lung cancer cell lines. In breast cancer tumor tissue, IGFIR is overexpressed 6-14 fold and IGFIR exhibits 2-4 fold higher kinase activity as compared to normal tissue. Colorectal cancer tissue biopsies exhibit elevated IGFIR levels wherein the extent of IGFIR expression is correlated with the severity of the disease. Analysis of primary cervical cancer cell cultures and cervical cancer cell lines revealed 3- and 5-fold overexpression of IGFIR, respectively, as compared to normal ectocervical cells. Expression of IGFIR in synovial sarcoma cells also correlated with an aggressive phenotype (i.e., metastasis and high rate of proliferation). Furthermore, acromegaly, a slowly developing disease, is caused by hypersecretion of growth hormone and IGF-I. Antagonism of IGFIR function may be helpful in treating the disease. IGF/IGF1R inhibitors mainly belong to three main classes: (1) monoclonal antibodies against IGFIR, (2) monoclonal antibodies against IGFIR ligands (IGF-1 and IGF-2), and (3) IGFIR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. These IGFlR-targeting agents share common effects on IGFIR signaling but differ in mechanisms of action, spectrum of target inhibition, and pharmacological features. Receptor blockade with the use of monoclonal antibody therapies against the IGFIR have been the most clinically investigated approach to date.

The combinations or pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention also have therapeutic applications in sensitising tumour cells for radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Hence the combinations or pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention can be used as "radio sensitizer" and/or "chemosensitizer" or can be given in combination with another "radiosensitizer" compound and/or "chemosensitizer" compound. The term "radiosensitizer" or "radiosensitizer" compound, as used herein, is defined as a combination or pharmaceutical formulation of the present invention, or a molecule, preferably a low molecular weight molecule, that when administered to animals in therapeutically effective amounts increase the sensitivity of the cells to ionizing radiation and/or promote the treatment of diseases which are treatable with ionizing radiation. The term "chemosensitizer" or "chemosensitizer" compound, as used herein, is defined as a combination or pharmaceutical composition of the present invention, or a molecule, preferably a low molecular weight molecule, that when administered to animals in therapeutically effective amounts increase the sensitivity of cells to chemotherapy and/or promote the treatment of diseases which are treatable with chemotherapeutics. Several mechanisms for the mode of action of radiosensitizers have been suggested in the literature including: hypoxic cell radiosensitizers ( e.g., 2- nitroimidazole compounds, and benzotriazine dioxide compounds) mimicking oxygen or alternatively behave like bioreductive agents under hypoxia; non-hypoxic cell radiosensitizers (e.g., halogenated pyrimidines) can be analogoues of DNA bases and preferentially incorporate into the DNA of cancer cells and thereby promote the radiation- induced breaking of DNA molecules and/or prevent the normal DNA repair mechanisms; and various other potential mechanisms of action have been hypothesized for radiosensitizers in the treatment of disease. Many cancer treatment protocols currently employ radiosensitizers in conjunction with radiation of x-rays. Examples of x-ray activated radiosensitizers include, but are not limited to, the following: metronidazole, misonidazole, desmethylmisonidazole, pimonidazole, etanidazole, nimorazole, mitomycin C, RSU 1069, SR 4233, E09, RB 6145, nicotinamide, 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BUdR), 5- iododeoxyuridine (IUdR), bromodeoxycytidine, fluorodeoxyuridine (FudR), hydroxyurea, cisplatin, and therapeutically effective analogs and derivatives of the same. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) of cancers employs visible light as the radiation activator of the sensitizing agent. Examples of photodynamic radiosensitizers include the following, but are not limited to: hematoporphyrin derivatives, Photo frin, benzoporphyrin derivatives, tin etioporphyrin, pheoborbide-a, bacteriochlorophyll-a, naphthalocyanines, phthalocyanines, zinc phthalocyanine, and therapeutically effective analogs and derivatives of the same. Radiosensitizers may be administered in conjunction with a therapeutically effective amount of one or more other compounds, including but not limited to: compounds which promote the incorporation of radiosensitizers to the target cells; compounds which control the flow of therapeutics, nutrients, and/or oxygen to the target cells; chemotherapeutic agents which act on the tumour with or without additional radiation; or other therapeutically effective compounds for treating cancer or other diseases. Chemosensitizers may be administered in conjunction with a therapeutically effective amount of one or more other compounds, including but not limited to: compounds which promote the incorporation of chemosensitizers to the target cells; compounds which control the flow of therapeutics, nutrients, and/or oxygen to the target cells; chemotherapeutic agents which act on the tumour or other therapeutically effective compounds for treating cancer or other disease. Calcium antagonists, for example verapamil, are found useful in combination with antineoplastic agents to establish chemo sensitivity in tumor cells resistant to accepted chemotherapeutic agents and to potentiate the efficacy of such compounds in drug- sensitive malignancies The present invention also relates to the use of a combination of the present invention for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of a FGFR mediated disorder, in particular cancer. The present invention also relates to the use of a pharmaceutical composition of the present invention for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of a FGFR mediated disorder, in particular cancer.

The salt forms of the compounds of the combinations or pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention are typically pharmaceutically acceptable salts, and examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts are discussed in Berge et al. (1977) "Pharmaceutically Acceptable Salts," J. Pharm. Sci., Vol. 66, pp. 1-19. However, salts that are not pharmaceutically acceptable may also be prepared as intermediate forms which may then be converted into pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Such non- pharmaceutically acceptable salts forms, which may be useful, for example, in the purification or separation of the compounds of the invention, also form part of the invention. The salts of the present invention can be synthesized from the parent compound that contains a basic or acidic moiety by conventional chemical methods such as methods described in Pharmaceutical Salts: Properties, Selection, and Use, P. Heinrich Stahl (Editor), Camille G. Wermuth (Editor), ISBN: 3-90639-026-8, Hardcover, 388 pages, August 2002. Generally, such salts can be prepared by reacting the free acid or base forms of these compounds with the appropriate base or acid in water or in an organic solvent, or in a mixture of the two; generally, nonaqueous media such as ether, ethyl acetate, ethanol, isopropanol, or acetonitrile are used. The compounds of the invention may exist as mono- or di-salts depending upon the pKa of the acid from which the salt is formed. Acid addition salts may be formed with a wide variety of acids, both inorganic and organic. Examples of acid addition salts include salts formed with an acid selected from the group consisting of acetic, 2,2-dichloroacetic, adipic, alginic, ascorbic (e.g. L-ascorbic), L-aspartic, benzenesulphonic, benzoic, 4-acetamidobenzoic, butanoic, (+) camphoric, camphor-sulphonic, (+)-(15)-camphor-10-sulphonic, capric, caproic, caprylic, cinnamic, citric, cyclamic, dodecylsulphuric, ethane- 1 ,2-disulphonic, ethanesulphonic, 2-hydroxyethanesulphonic, formic, fumaric, galactaric, gentisic, glucoheptonic, D-gluconic, glucuronic (e.g. D-glucuronic), glutamic (e.g. L-glutamic), a-oxoglutaric, glycolic, hippuric, hydrobromic, hydrochloric, hydriodic, isethionic, lactic (e.g. (+)-L-lactic, (±)-DL-lactic), lactobionic, maleic, malic, (-)-L-malic, malonic, (±)-DL-mandelic, methanesulphonic, naphthalenesulphonic (e.g.naphthalene-2- sulphonic), naphthalene- 1,5-disulphonic, l-hydroxy-2-naphthoic, nicotinic, nitric, oleic, orotic, oxalic, palmitic, pamoic, phosphoric, propionic, L-pyroglutamic, pyruvic, salicylic, 4-amino-salicylic, sebacic, stearic, succinic, sulphuric, tannic, (+)-L-tartaric, thiocyanic, toluenesulphonic (e.g. /^-toluenesulphonic), undecylenic and valeric acids, as well as acylated amino acids and cation exchange resins. One particular group of salts consists of salts formed from acetic, hydrochloric, hydriodic, phosphoric, nitric, sulphuric, citric, lactic, succinic, maleic, malic, isethionic, fumaric, benzenesulphonic, toluenesulphonic, methanesulphonic (mesylate), ethanesulphonic, naphthalenesulphonic, valeric, acetic, propanoic, butanoic, malonic, glucuronic and lactobionic acids. Another group of acid addition salts includes salts formed from acetic, adipic, ascorbic, aspartic, citric, DL-Lactic, fumaric, gluconic, glucuronic, hippuric, hydrochloric, glutamic, DL-malic, methanesulphonic, sebacic, stearic, succinic and tartaric acids. If the compound is anionic, or has a functional group which may be anionic, then a salt may be formed with a suitable cation. Examples of suitable inorganic cations include, but are not limited to, alkali metal ions such as Na+ and K+, alkaline earth metal cations such as Ca2+ and Mg2+, and other cations such as Al3+. Examples of suitable organic cations include, but are not limited to, ammonium ion (i.e., NH4 ) and substituted ammonium ions (e.g., NH3R+, NH2R2+, NHR3+, NR4+). Examples of some suitable substituted ammonium ions are those derived from: ethylamine, diethylamine, dicyclohexylamine, triethylamine, butylamine, ethylenediamine, ethanolamine, diethanolamine, piperazine, benzylamine, phenylbenzylamine, choline, meglumine, and tromethamine, as well as amino acids, such as lysine and arginine. An example of a common quaternary ammonium ion is N(CH3)4+. In one embodiment, the pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the FGFR inhibitors compound A and compound B of the combinations or the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention are acid addition salts. In one embodiment, wherein the combinations or the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention, comprise as FGFR inhibitor compound A or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof or a solvate thereof, or compound B or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof or a solvate thereof, said compound A or compound B are present in salt form, especially those salts of compound A and compound B as described hereinabove in the background of the invention section. In one embodiment, the combinations or the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention comprise the FGFR inhibitor in free base form. In one embodiment, the combinations or the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention comprise the IGF1R inhibitor in free base form. In one embodiment, the combinations or the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention comprise the FGFR inhibitor and the IGF1R inhibitor in free base form. The compounds of the combinations or pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may form solvates, for example with water (i.e., hydrates) or common organic solvents. As used herein, the term "solvate" means a physical association of the compounds of the present invention with one or more solvent molecules. This physical association involves varying degrees of ionic and covalent bonding, including hydrogen bonding. In certain instances the solvate will be capable of isolation, for example when one or more solvent molecules are incorporated in the crystal lattice of the crystalline solid. The term "solvate" is intended to encompass both solution-phase and isolatable solvates. Non-limiting examples of suitable solvates include compounds of the invention in combination with water, isopropanol, ethanol, methanol, DMSO, ethyl acetate, acetic acid or ethanolamine and the like. The compounds of the invention may exert their biological effects whilst they are in solution. Solvates of the pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of the combinations or pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention are also encompassed in the term "solvate". Solvates are well known in pharmaceutical chemistry. They can be important to the processes for the preparation of a substance (e.g. in relation to their purification, the storage of the substance (e.g. its stability) and the ease of handling of the substance and are often formed as part of the isolation or purification stages of a chemical synthesis. A person skilled in the art can determine by means of standard and long used techniques whether a hydrate or other solvate has formed by the isolation conditions or purification conditions used to prepare a given compound. Examples of such techniques include thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X-ray crystallography (e.g. single crystal X-ray crystallography or X-ray powder diffraction) and Solid State NMR (SS-NMR, also known as Magic Angle Spinning NMR or MAS-NMR). Such techniques are as much a part of the standard analytical toolkit of the skilled chemist as NMR, IR, HPLC and MS. Alternatively the skilled person can deliberately form a solvate using crystallisation conditions that include an amount of the solvent required for the particular solvate. Thereafter the standard methods described above, can be used to establish whether solvates had formed. Also encompassed by the compounds as described herein are any complexes (e.g. inclusion complexes or clathrates with compounds such as cyclodextrins, or complexes with metals) of the compounds. Furthermore, the compounds of combinations or pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may have one or more polymorph (crystalline) or amorphous forms and as such are intended to be included in the scope of the invention. As used herein, the term "modulation", as applied to the activity of a kinase, is intended to define a change in the level of biological activity of the protein kinase. Thus, modulation encompasses physiological changes which effect an increase or decrease in the relevant protein kinase activity. In the latter case, the modulation may be described as "inhibition". The modulation may arise directly or indirectly, and may be mediated by any mechanism and at any physiological level, including for example at the level of gene expression (including for example transcription, translation and/or post- trans lational modification), at the level of expression of genes encoding regulatory elements which act directly or indirectly on the levels of kinase activity. Thus, modulation may imply elevated/suppressed expression or over- or under-expression of a kinase, including gene amplification (i.e. multiple gene copies) and/or increased or decreased expression by a transcriptional effect, as well as hyper- (or hypo-)activity and (de)activation of the protein kinase(s) (including (de)activation) by mutation(s). The terms "modulated", "modulating" and "modulate" are to be interpreted accordingly. As used herein, the term "mediated", as used e.g. in conjunction with a kinase as described herein (and applied for example to various physiological processes, diseases, states, conditions, therapies, treatments or interventions) is intended to operate limitatively so that the various processes, diseases, states, conditions, treatments and interventions to which the term is applied are those in which the kinase plays a biological role. In cases where the term is applied to a disease, state or condition, the biological role played by a kinase may be direct or indirect and may be necessary and/or sufficient for the manifestation of the symptoms of the disease, state or condition (or its aetiology or progression). Thus, kinase activity (and in particular aberrant levels of kinase activity, e.g. kinase over-expression) need not necessarily be the proximal cause of the disease, state or condition: rather, it is contemplated that the kinase mediated diseases, states or conditions include those having multifactorial aetiologies and complex progressions in which the kinase in question is only partially involved. In cases where the term is applied to treatment, prophylaxis or intervention, the role played by the kinase may be direct or indirect and may be necessary and/or sufficient for the operation of the treatment, prophylaxis or outcome of the intervention. Thus, a disease state or condition mediated by a kinase includes the development of resistance to any particular cancer drug or treatment. Thus, for example, the combinations or the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be useful in alleviating or reducing the incidence of cancer. The FGFR inhibitors compound A and compound B of the combinations and pharmaceutical compositions have activity against FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3, and/or FGFR4, and in particular against FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3 and FGFR4. As a consequence of their activity in modulating or inhibiting FGFR, the combinations or pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention will be useful in providing a means of preventing the growth or inducing apoptosis of neoplasias, particularly by inhibiting angiogenesis. It is therefore anticipated that the combinations or pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention will prove useful in treating or preventing proliferative disorders such as cancers. In addition, the combinations or pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention could be useful in the treatment of diseases in which there is a disorder of proliferation, apoptosis or differentiation. Examples of cancers which may be treated (or inhibited) by the combinations or pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention include, but are not limited to, a carcinoma, for example a carcinoma of the bladder, breast, colon (e.g. colorectal carcinomas such as colon adenocarcinoma and colon adenoma), kidney, urothelial, uterus, epidermis, liver, lung (for example adenocarcinoma, small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung carcinomas, squamous lung cancer), oesophagus, head and neck, gall bladder, ovary, pancreas (e.g. exocrine pancreatic carcinoma), stomach, gastrointestinal (also known as gastric) cancer (e.g. gastrointestinal stromal tumours), cervix, endometrium, thyroid, prostate, or skin (for example squamous cell carcinoma or dermato fibrosarcoma protuberans); pituitary cancer, a hematopoietic tumour of lymphoid lineage, for example leukemia, acute lymphocytic leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, B-cell lymphoma (e.g. diffuse large B-cell lymphoma), T-cell lymphoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, hairy cell lymphoma, or Burkett's lymphoma; a hematopoietic tumour of myeloid lineage, for example leukemias, acute and chronic myelogenous leukemias, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), myeloproliferative disorder, myeloproliferative syndrome, myelodysplasia syndrome, or promyelocytic leukemia; multiple myeloma; thyroid follicular cancer; hepatocellular cancer, a tumour of mesenchymal origin (e.g. Ewing's sarcoma), for example fibrosarcoma or rhabdomyosarcoma; a tumour of the central or peripheral nervous system, for example astrocytoma, neuroblastoma, glioma (such as glioblastoma multiforme) or schwannoma; melanoma; seminoma; teratocarcinoma; osteosarcoma; xeroderma pigmentosum; keratoctanthoma; thyroid follicular cancer; or Kaposi's sarcoma.

Certain cancers are resistant to treatment with particular drugs. This can be due to the type of the tumour or can arise due to treatment with the compound. In this regard, references to multiple myeloma includes bortezomib sensitive multiple myeloma or refractory multiple myeloma. Similarly, references to chronic myelogenous leukemia includes imitanib sensitive chronic myelogenous leukemia and refractory chronic myelogenous leukemia. Chronic myelogenous leukemia is also known as chronic myeloid leukemia, chronic granulocytic leukemia or CML. Likewise, acute myelogenous leukemia, is also called acute myeloblasts leukemia, acute granulocytic leukemia, acute nonlymphocytic leukaemia or AML. The combinations or pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention can also be used in the treatment of hematopoetic diseases of abnormal cell proliferation whether pre-malignant or stable such as myeloproliferative diseases. Myeloproliferative diseases ("MPD"s) are a group of diseases of the bone marrow in which excess cells are produced. They are related to, and may evolve into, myelodysplasia syndrome. Myeloproliferative diseases include polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia and primary myelofibrosis. A further haematological disorder is hypereosinophilic syndrome. T-cell lymphoproliferative diseases include those derived from natural Killer cells. In addition the combinations or pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention can be used to treat gastrointestinal (also known as gastric) cancer e.g. gastrointestinal stromal tumours. Gastrointestinal cancer refers to malignant conditions of the gastrointestinal tract, including the esophagus, stomach, liver, biliary system, pancreas, bowels, and anus. Thus, in the combinations, pharmaceutical compositions, uses or methods of this invention for treating a disease or condition comprising abnormal cell growth, the disease or condition comprising abnormal cell growth in one embodiment is a cancer. Particular subsets of cancers include multiple myeloma, bladder, cervical, prostate and thyroid carcinomas, lung, breast, and colon cancers. A further subset of cancers includes multiple myeloma, bladder, hepatocellular, oral squamous cell carcinoma and cervical carcinomas. A further subset of cancers includes bladder, lung, breast, gastric, hepatocellular, colon, hematological malignancies, ovarian, glioblastoma. A further subset of cancers includes bladder, lung, breast, gastric and hepatocellular. The combinations or pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention, having FGFR such as FGFRl inhibitory activity, may be particularly useful in the treatment or prevention of breast cancer in particular Classic Lobular Carcinomas (CLC). As the combinations or pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention have FGFR4 activity they will also be useful in the treatment of prostate or pituitary cancers, or they will be useful in the treatment of breast cancer, lung cancer, prostate cancer, liver cancer (HCC) or lung cancer. In particular the combinations or pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention comprising FGFR inhibitors, are useful in the treatment of multiple myeloma, myeloproliferatoive disorders, endometrial cancer, prostate cancer, bladder cancer, lung cancer, ovarian cancer, breast cancer, gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, and oral squamous cell carcinoma. Further subsets of cancer are multiple myeloma, endometrial cancer, bladder cancer, cervical cancer, prostate cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer, colorectal cancer and thyroid carcinomas. In particular the combinations or pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention are useful in the treatment of multiple myeloma (in particular multiple myeloma with t(4;14) translocation or overexpressing FGFR3), prostate cancer (hormone refractory prostrate carcinomas), endometrial cancer (in particular endometrial tumours with activating mutations in FGFR2) and breast cancer (in particular lobular breast cancer). In particular the combinations or pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention are useful in the treatment of lobular carcinomas such as CLC (Classic lobular carcinoma). As the combinations or pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention have activity against FGFR3 they will be useful in the treatment of multiple myeloma and bladder cancer. In particular, the compounds have activity against tumours with FGFR3-TACC3 translocation, in particular bladder or brain tumours with FGFR3-TACC3 translocation. In particular the combinations or pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention are useful for the treatment of t(4;14) translocation positive multiple myeloma. In one embodiment the combinations or pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be useful for the treatment of sarcoma. In one embodiment the combinations or pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be useful for the treatment of lung cancer, e.g. squamous cell carcinoma. As the combinations or pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention have activity against FGFR2 they will be useful in the treatment of endometrial, ovarian, gastric, hepatocellular, uterine, cervix and colorectal cancers. FGFR2 is also overexpressed in epithelial ovarian cancer, therefore the combinations or pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be specifically useful in treating ovarian cancer such as epithelial ovarian cancer. In one embodiment, the combinations or pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be useful for the treatment of lung cancer, in particular NSCLC (non small cell lung cancer), squamous cell carcinoma, liver cancer, kidney cancer, breast cancer, colon cancer, colorectal cancer, prostate cancer. Combinations or pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may also be useful in the treatment of tumours pre-treated with VEGFR2 inhibitor or VEGFR2 antibody (e.g. Avastin). In particular the combinations or pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be useful in the treatment of VEGFR2 -resistant tumours.

One sub-group of disease states and conditions wherein the combinations or pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be useful consists of inflammatory diseases, cardiovascular diseases and wound healing. FGFR are also known to play a role in apoptosis, angiogenesis, proliferation, differentiation and transcription and therefore the compounds, combinations, pharmaceutical compositions of the invention could also be useful in the treatment of the following diseases other than cancer; chronic inflammatory diseases, for example systemic lupus erythematosus, autoimmune mediated glomerulonephritis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease, autoimmune diabetes mellitus, Eczema hypersensitivity reactions, asthma, COPD, rhinitis, and upper respiratory tract disease; cardiovascular diseases for example cardiac hypertrophy, restenosis, atherosclerosis; neurodegenerative disorders, for example Alzheimer's disease, AIDS-related dementia, Parkinson's disease, amyotropic lateral sclerosis, retinitis pigmentosa, spinal muscular atropy and cerebellar degeneration; glomerulonephritis; myelodysplastic syndromes, ischemic injury associated myocardial infarctions, stroke and reperfusion injury, arrhythmia, atherosclerosis, toxin-induced or alcohol related liver diseases, haematological diseases, for example, chronic anemia and aplastic anemia; degenerative diseases of the musculoskeletal system, for example, osteoporosis and arthritis, aspirin- sensitive rhino sinusitis, cystic fibrosis, multiple sclerosis, kidney diseases and cancer pain. In addition, mutations of FGFR2 are associated with several severe abnormalities in human skeletal development and thus the compounds of invention could be useful in the treatment of abnormalities in human skeletal development, including abnormal ossification of cranial sutures (craniosynostosis), Apert (AP) syndrome, Crouzon syndrome, Jackson- Weiss syndrome, Beare- Stevenson cutis gyrate syndrome, and Pfeiffer syndrome. The combinations or pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention, having FGFR such as FGFR2 or FGFR3 inhibitory activity, may be particularly useful in the treatment or prevention of the skeletal diseases. Particular skeletal diseases are achondroplasia or thanatophoric dwarfism (also known as thanatophoric dysplasia). The combinations or pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention, having FGFR such as FGFRl, FGFR2 or FGFR3 inhibitory activity, may be particularly useful in the treatment or prevention in pathologies in which progressive fibrosis is a symptom. Fibrotic conditions in which the compounds of the inventions may be useful in the treatment of include diseases exhibiting abnormal or excessive deposition of fibrous tissue for example in liver cirrhosis, glomerulonephritis, pulmonary fibrosis, systemic fibrosis, rheumatoid arthritis, as well as the natural process of wound healing. In particular the compounds, combinations, pharmaceutical compositions of the inventions may also be useful in the treatment of lung fibrosis in particular in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. The over-expression and activation of FGFR in tumor- associated vasculature has also suggested a role for the combinations or pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention in preventing and disrupting initiation of tumor angiogenesis. In particular the combinations or pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be useful in the treatment of cancer, metastasis, leukemia's such as CLL, ocular diseases such as age-related macular degeneration in particular wet form of age-related macular degeneration, ischemic proliferative retinopathies such as retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) and diabetic retinopathy, rheumatoid arthritis and hemangioma.

In one embodiment, the disease mediated by FGFR kinases is a oncology related disease (e.g. cancer). In one embodiment, the disease mediated by FGFR kinases is a non-oncology related disease (e.g. any disease disclosed herein excluding cancer). In one embodiment the disease mediated by FGFR kinases is a condition described herein. In one embodiment the disease mediated by FGFR kinases is a skeletal condition described herein. Particular abnormalities in human skeletal development, include abnormal ossification of cranial sutures (craniosynostosis), Apert (AP) syndrome, Crouzon syndrome, Jackson- Weiss syndrome, Beare-Stevenson cutis gyrate syndrome, Pfeiffer syndrome, achondroplasia and thanatophoric dwarfism (also known as thanatophoric dysplasia). Mutated Kinases Drug resistant kinase mutations can arise in patient populations treated with kinase inhibitors. These occur, in part, in the regions of the protein that bind to or interact with the particular inhibitor used in therapy. Such mutations reduce or increase the capacity of the inhibitor to bind to and inhibit the kinase in question. This can occur at any of the amino acid residues which interact with the inhibitor or are important for supporting the binding of said inhibitor to the target. An inhibitor that binds to a target kinase without requiring the interaction with the mutated amino acid residue will likely be unaffected by the mutation and will remain an effective inhibitor of the enzyme. A study in gastric cancer patient samples showed the presence of two mutations in FGFR2, Serl67Pro in exon Ilia and a splice site mutation 940-2A-G in exon IIIc. These mutations are identical to the germline activating mutations that cause craniosynotosis syndromes and were observed in 13% of primary gastric cancer tissues studied. In addition activating mutations in FGFR3 were observed in 5% of the patient samples tested and overexpression of FGFRs has been correlated with a poor prognosis in this patient group. In addition there are chromosomal translocations or point mutations that have been observed in FGFR which give rise to gain-of-function, over-expressed, or constitutively active biological states. The compounds, the combinations or the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention would therefore find particular application in relation to cancers which express a mutated molecular target such as FGFR. Diagnosis of tumours with such mutations could be performed using techniques known to a person skilled in the art and as described herein such as RTPCR and FISH. It has been suggested that mutations of a conserved threonine residue at the ATP binding site of FGFR would result in inhibitor resistance. The amino acid valine 561 has been mutated to a methionine in FGFR1 which corresponds to previously reported mutations found in Abl (T315) and EGFR (T766) that have been shown to confer resistance to selective inhibitors. Assay data for FGFR1 V561M showed that this mutation conferred resistance to a tyrosine kinase inhibitor compared to that of the wild type. Methods of Diagnosis Prior to administration of a combination or pharmaceutical composition as described herein, a patient may be screened to determine whether a disease or condition from which the patient is or may be suffering is one which would be susceptible to treatment with a compound having activity against FGFR. For example, a biological sample taken from a patient may be analysed to determine whether a condition or disease, such as cancer, that the patient is or may be suffering from is one which is characterised by a genetic abnormality or abnormal protein expression which leads to up-regulation of the levels or activity of FGFR, or to sensitisation of a pathway to normal FGFR activity, or to upregulation of these growth factor signalling pathways such as growth factor ligand levels or growth factor ligand activity or to upregulation of a biochemical pathway downstream of FGFR activation. Examples of such abnormalities that result in activation or sensitisation of the FGFR signal include loss of, or inhibition of apoptotic pathways, up-regulation of the receptors or ligands, or presence of mutant variants of the receptors or ligands e.g PTK variants. Tumours with mutants of FGFR1, FGFR2 or FGFR3 or FGFR4 or up- regulation, in particular over-expression of FGFR1 , or gain-of- function mutants of FGFR2 or FGFR3 may be particularly sensitive to FGFR inhibitors. For example, point mutations engendering gain-of- function in FGFR2 have been identified in a number of conditions. In particular activating mutations in FGFR2 have been identified in 10% of endometrial tumours. In addition, genetic aberrations of the FGFR3 receptor tyrosine kinase such as chromosomal translocations or point mutations resulting in ectopically expressed or deregulated, constitutively active, FGFR3 receptors have been identified and are linked to a subset of multiple myelomas, bladder and cervical carcinomas. A particular mutation T674I of the PDGF receptor has been identified in imatinib-treated patients. In addition, a gene amplification of 8pl2-pl 1.2 was demonstrated in -50% of lobular breast cancer (CLC) cases and this was shown to be linked with an increased expression of FGFR1. Preliminary studies with siRNA directed against FGFR1, or a small molecule inhibitor of the receptor, showed cell lines harbouring this amplification to be particularly sensitive to inhibition of this signalling pathway. Alternatively, a biological sample taken from a patient may be analysed for loss of a negative regulator or suppressor of FGFR. In the present context, the term "loss" embraces the deletion of a gene encoding the regulator or suppressor, the truncation of the gene (for example by mutation), the truncation of the transcribed product of the gene, or the inactivation of the transcribed product (e.g. by point mutation) or sequestration by another gene product. The term up-regulation includes elevated expression or over-expression, including gene amplification (i.e. multiple gene copies) and increased expression by a transcriptional effect, and hyperactivity and activation, including activation by mutations. Thus, the patient may be subjected to a diagnostic test to detect a marker characteristic of up- regulation of FGFR. The term diagnosis includes screening. By marker we include genetic markers including, for example, the measurement of DNA composition to identify mutations of FGFR. The term marker also includes markers which are characteristic of up regulation of FGFR, including enzyme activity, enzyme levels, enzyme state (e.g. phosphorylated or not) and mRNA levels of the aforementioned proteins. The diagnostic tests and screens are typically conducted on a biological sample selected from tumour biopsy samples, blood samples (isolation and enrichment of shed tumour cells), stool biopsies, sputum, chromosome analysis, pleural fluid, peritoneal fluid, buccal spears, biopsy or urine. Methods of identification and analysis of mutations and up-regulation of proteins are known to a person skilled in the art. Screening methods could include, but are not limited to, standard methods such as reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or in-situ hybridization such as fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Identification of an individual carrying a mutation in FGFR may mean that the patient would be particularly suitable for treatment with a FGFR inhibitor. Tumours may preferentially be screened for presence of a FGFR variant prior to treatment. The screening process will typically involve direct sequencing, oligonucleotide microarray analysis, or a mutant specific antibody. In addition, diagnosis of tumours with such mutations could be performed using techniques known to a person skilled in the art and as described herein such as RT-PCR and FISH. In addition, mutant forms of, for example FGFR, can be identified by direct sequencing of, for example, tumour biopsies using PCR and methods to sequence PCR products directly as hereinbefore described. The skilled artisan will recognize that all such well- known techniques for detection of the over expression, activation or mutations of the aforementioned proteins could be applicable in the present case. In screening by RT-PCR, the level of mRNA in the tumour is assessed by creating a cDNA copy of the mRNA followed by amplification of the cDNA by PCR. Methods of PCR amplification, the selection of primers, and conditions for amplification, are known to a person skilled in the art. Nucleic acid manipulations and PCR are carried out by standard methods, as described for example in Ausubel, F.M. et al., eds. (2004) Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley & Sons Inc., or Innis, M.A. et al., eds. (1990) PCR Protocols: a guide to methods and applications, Academic Press, San Diego. Reactions and manipulations involving nucleic acid techniques are also described in Sambrook et al., (2001), 3rd Ed, Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press. Alternatively a commercially available kit for RT-PCR (for example Roche Molecular Biochemicals) may be used, or methodology as set forth in United States patents 4,666,828; 4,683,202; 4,801,531; 5,192,659, 5,272,057, 5,882,864, and 6,218,529 and incorporated herein by reference. An example of an in-situ hybridisation technique for assessing mRNA expression would be fluorescence in-situ hybridisation (FISH) (see Angerer (1987) Meth. Enzymol, 152: 649). Generally, in situ hybridization comprises the following major steps: (1) fixation of tissue to be analyzed; (2) prehybridization treatment of the sample to increase accessibility of target nucleic acid, and to reduce nonspecific binding; (3) hybridization of the mixture of nucleic acids to the nucleic acid in the biological structure or tissue; (4) post-hybridization washes to remove nucleic acid fragments not bound in the hybridization, and (5) detection of the hybridized nucleic acid fragments. The probes used in such applications are typically labelled, for example, with radioisotopes or fluorescent reporters. Preferred probes are sufficiently long, for example, from about 50, 100, or 200 nucleotides to about 1000 or more nucleotides, to enable specific hybridization with the target nucleic acid(s) under stringent conditions. Standard methods for carrying out FISH are described in Ausubel, F.M. et al., eds. (2004) Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley & Sons Inc and Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization: Technical Overview by John M. S. Bartlett in Molecular Diagnosis of Cancer, Methods and Protocols, 2nd ed.; ISBN: 1-59259-760-2; March 2004, pps. 077-088; Series: Methods in Molecular Medicine. Methods for gene expression profiling are described by (DePrimo et al. (2003), BMC Cancer, 3:3). Briefly, the protocol is as follows: double-stranded cDNA is synthesized from total RNA Using a (dT)24 oligomer for priming first-strand cDNA synthesis, followed by second strand cDNA synthesis with random hexamer primers. The double-stranded cDNA is used as a template for in vitro transcription of cRNA using biotinylated ribonucleotides. cRNA is chemically fragmented according to protocols described by Affymetrix (Santa Clara, CA, USA), and then hybridized overnight on Human Genome Arrays. Alternatively, the protein products expressed from the mRNAs may be assayed by immunohistochemistry of tumour samples, solid phase immunoassay with microtitre plates, Western blotting, 2-dimensional SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, ELISA, flow cytometry and other methods known in the art for detection of specific proteins. Detection methods would include the use of site specific antibodies. The skilled person will recognize that all such well-known techniques for detection of upregulation of FGFR, or detection of FGFR variants or mutants could be applicable in the present case. Abnormal levels of proteins such as FGFR can be measured using standard enzyme assays, for example, those assays described herein. Activation or overexpression could also be detected in a tissue sample, for example, a tumour tissue. By measuring the tyrosine kinase activity with an assay such as that from Chemicon International. The tyrosine kinase of interest would be immunoprecipitated from the sample lysate and its activity measured. Alternative methods for the measurement of the over expression or activation of FGFR including the iso forms thereof, include the measurement of micro vessel density. This can for example be measured using methods described by Orre and Rogers (Int J Cancer (1999), 84(2) 101-8). Therefore all of these techniques could also be used to identify tumours particularly suitable for treatment with the combinations or pharmaceutical compositions of the invention. The combinations or pharmaceutical compositions of the invention are particular useful in treatment of a patient having a mutated FGFR. The G697C mutation in FGFR3 is observed in 62% of oral squamous cell carcmonas and causes constitutive activation of the kinase activity. Activating mutations of FGFR3 have also been identified in bladder carcinoma cases. These mutations were of 6 kinds with varying degrees of prevelence: R248C, S249C, G372C, S373C, Y375C, K652Q. In addition, a Gly388Arg polymorphism in FGFR4 has been found to be associated with increased incidence and aggressiveness of prostate, colon, lung, liver (HCC) and breast cancer. Therefore in a further aspect the invention includes use of a combination or pharmaceutical composition according to the invention for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment or prophylaxis of a disease state or condition in a patient who has been screened and has been determined as suffering from, or being at risk of suffering from, a disease or condition which would be susceptible to treatment with a compound having activity against FGFR. Particular mutations a patient is screened for include G697C, R248C, S249C, G372C, S373C, Y375C, K652Q mutations in FGFR3 and Gly388Arg polymorphism in FGFR4. In another aspect the invention includes a compound, a combination or a pharmaceutical composition of the invention for use in the prophylaxis or treatment of cancer in a patient selected from a sub-population possessing a variant of the FGFR gene (for example G697C mutation in FGFR3 and Gly388Arg polymorphism in FGFR4). In view of their useful pharmacological properties, the FGFR inhibitors and IGF1R inhibitors may be formulated into various pharmaceutical forms for administration purposes. In one embodiment the pharmaceutical composition (e.g. formulation) comprises at least one FGFR inhibitor, or at least one IGF1R inhibitor or at least one FGFR inhibitor and one IGF1R inhibitor of the invention together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, adjuvants, excipients, diluents, fillers, buffers, stabilisers, preservatives, lubricants, or other materials well known to those skilled in the art and optionally other therapeutic or prophylactic agents. To prepare the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention, an effective amount of a compound of the present invention, as the active ingredient is combined in intimate admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, which carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration. The pharmaceutical compositions can be in any form suitable for oral, parenteral, topical, intranasal, ophthalmic, otic, rectal, intra- vaginal, or transdermal administration. These pharmaceutical compositions are desirably in unitary dosage form suitable, preferably, for administration orally, rectally, percutaneously, or by parenteral injection. For example, in preparing the compositions in oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed, such as, for example, water, glycols, oils, alcohols and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations such as suspensions, syrups, elixirs and solutions; or solid carriers such as starches, sugars, kaolin, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like in the case of powders, pills, capsules and tablets. Because of their ease in administration, tablets and capsules represent the most advantageous oral dosage unit form, in which case solid pharmaceutical carriers are obviously employed. For parenteral compositions, the carrier will usually comprise sterile water, at least in large part, though other ingredients, to aid solubility for example, may be included. Injectable solutions, for example, may be prepared in which the carrier comprises saline solution, glucose solution or a mixture of saline and glucose solution. Injectable suspensions may also be prepared in which case appropriate liquid carriers, suspending agents and the like may be employed. In the compositions suitable for percutaneous administration, the carrier optionally comprises a penetration enhancing agent and/or a suitable wetting agent, optionally combined with suitable additives of any nature in minor proportions, which additives do not cause a significant deleterious effect to the skin. Said additives may facilitate the administration to the skin and/or may be helpful for preparing the desired compositions. These compositions may be administered in various ways, e.g., as a transdermal patch, as a spot-on, as an ointment. It is especially advantageous to formulate the aforementioned pharmaceutical compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used in the specification and claims herein refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active ingredient calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. Examples of such dosage unit forms are tablets (including scored or coated tablets), capsules, pills, powder packets, wafers, injectable solutions or suspensions, teaspoonfuls, tablespoonfuls and the like, and segregated multiples thereof. It is especially advantageous to formulate the aforementioned pharmaceutical compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage.

Examples of such dosage unit forms are tablets (including scored or coated tablets), capsules, pills, powder packets, wafers, injectable solutions or suspensions, teaspoonfuls, tablespoonfuls and the like, and segregated multiples thereof. The combination or pharmaceutical composition of the invention is administered in an amount sufficient to exert its anti-tumour activity. Those skilled in the art could easily determine the effective amount of the FGFR inhibitor and IGF1R inhibitor as described herein. In general it is contemplated that a therapeutically effective amount would be from 0.005 mg/kg to 100 mg/kg body weight, and in particular from 0.005 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg body weight. It may be appropriate to administer the required dose as single, two, three, four or more sub- doses at appropriate intervals throughout the day. Said sub-doses may be formulated as unit dosage forms, for example, containing 0.5 to 500 mg, in particular 1 mg to 500 mg, more in particular 10 mg to 500 mg of active ingredient per unit dosage form. Depending on the mode of administration, the pharmaceutical composition will preferably comprise from 0.05 to 99 % by weight, more preferably from 0.1 to 70 % by weight, even more preferably from 0.1 to 50 % by weight of the FGFR inhibitor, the IGF1R inhibitor or the combination of the FGFR inhibitor and IGF1R inhibitor as described herein, and, from 1 to 99.95 % by weight, more preferably from 30 to 99.9 % by weight, even more preferably from 50 to 99.9 % by weight of a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, all percentages being based on the total weight of the composition. For the treatment of the above conditions, the combinations or pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may be advantageously employed, as indicated above, in combination with one or more other medicinal agents, more particularly, with other anti-cancer agents or adjuvants in cancer therapy. The present invention therefore also relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising the one or more other medicinal agent and the combination according to the present invention together with a pharmaceutical carrier. The present invention further relates to the use of a combination according to the invention in the manufacture of a pharmaceutical composition for inhibiting the growth of tumour cells. The present invention further relates to a product containing as first active ingredient a FGFR inhibitor, in particular a FFGR inhibitor as described herein, more in particular compound A or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof or a solvate thereof or compound B or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof or a solvate thereof, as second active ingredient a IGF1R inhibitor, in particular a IGF1R inhibitor as defined herein, and as further active ingredient one or more anticancer agent, as a combined preparation for simultaneous, separate or sequential use in the treatment of patients suffering from cancer. The one or more other medicinal agents and the combination according to the present invention may be administered simultaneously (e.g. in separate or unitary compositions) or sequentially in either order. In the latter case, the three or more compounds will be administered within a period and in an amount and manner that is sufficient to ensure that an advantageous or synergistic effect is achieved. It will be appreciated that the preferred method and order of administration and the respective dosage amounts and regimes for each component of the combination will depend on the particular other medicinal agent and compounds of the combinations of the present invention being administered, their route of administration, the particular tumour being treated and the particular host being treated. The optimum method and order of administration and the dosage amounts and regime can be readily determined by those skilled in the art using conventional methods and in view of the information set out herein. The weight ratio of the compounds of the combinations according to the present invention and the one or more other anticancer agent(s) when given as a combination may be determined by the person skilled in the art. Said ratio and the exact dosage and frequency of administration depends on the particular compounds of the combinations according to the invention and the other anticancer agent(s) used, the particular condition being treated, the severity of the condition being treated, the age, weight, gender, diet, time of administration and general physical condition of the particular patient, the mode of administration as well as other medication the individual may be taking, as is well known to those skilled in the art. Furthermore, it is evident that the effective daily amount may be lowered or increased depending on the response of the treated subject and/or depending on the evaluation of the physician prescribing the combinations of the instant invention. A particular weight ratio for each couple of the FGFR inhibitor, the IGF1R inhibitor and the other anticancer agent may range from 1/10 to 10/1, more in particular from 1/5 to 5/1, even more in particular from 1/3 to 3/1. The platinum coordination compound is advantageously administered in a dosage of 1 to 500mg per square meter (mg/m2) of body surface area, for example 50 to 400 mg/m2, particularly for cisplatin in a dosage of about 75 mg/m2 and for carboplatin in about 300mg/m2 per course of treatment.

Experimental Part During evaluation of the above described compounds A and B as FGFR inhibitors, when testing the compounds in a cell based proliferation assay (alamar blue assay, see herein below), it was found that even the most sensitive cancer cell lines (IC50 < 10 nM), have subpopulation of cells that are not sensitive to the compounds. This was for instance observed by a plateau in the proliferation curve around -10-20% of DMSO control (value observed in the assay for DMSO is taken as 100%, and values observed for the dose treatments with compound are calculated as % of 100% DMSO). For example, when DMSl 14 cells, a small cell lung cancer cell line with FGFRl amplification, were treated in the proliferation assay with N-(3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-N'- ( 1 -methylethyl)-N- [3 -( 1 -methyl- 1 H-pyrazo l-4-yl)quinoxalin-6-yl]ethane- 1 ,2-diamine the curve showed to plateau at ~ 10-20%) of DMSO control, suggesting there are ~ 10-20%) of cells that are insensitive to the treatment with the compound. The insensitive cells were isolated and profiled with the aim to determine the active signaling pathways that act as drivers for their survival and/or proliferation. Therefore, DMSl 14 cells, a small cell lung cancer cell line with FGFRl amplification were plated onto 10 cm culture plates and placed in an incubator at 37 °C, 5% C02. The cells were grown in growth medium (see below), for the parental cells with or without DMSO control, or in growth medium supplemented with high dose of compound A (1 microM final concentration of compound A in the medium, compound A was added as a sample diluted from a stock solution in DMSO), for the resistant cells, over a prolonged period of time. During the time of growing out the compound insensitive cells, medium supplemented with compound A [1 microM], was changed twice weekly. In the case of the parental cells with or without DMSO control, when the cells reached the confluence close to 100% they were trypsinized and re-plated back on the plate. In the compound treated plates outgrowth of resistant clones were observed. After about 2-3 weeks from the initial treatment, cells were taken out of the plate by trypsinization and passaged on new plate for further expanding. Resistant cells, same as the parental cells were passaged twice weekly, but the medium of the resistant cells was always supplemented with compound A [1 microM]. (test 1) Growth medium RRMI-1640 (Gibco, 31870-025) 500 ml; 10% FCS (Hyclone, SV30160.03) 57 ml; lmM Sodium Pyruvate (Gibco, 11360) 5.7 ml; 2mM L-Glutamine (Gibco, 25030) 5.7 ml; 50μg/ml Gentamicin (Gibco, 15750) 5.7 ml. The resistant cells were profiled for genes that are differentially expressed compared to the parental cells using microarray technology. Two microarray experiments were done. In the first experiment, parental and resistant cells were profiled in order to define genes and pathways different between the two populations and to understand the pathways that drive the resistance to compound A. In the second microarray experiment, the changes in gene expression over time after treatment with compound A were profiled. For that purpose DMS114 cells were treated with DSMO or 1 microM of compound A or left untreated during the time course of 1 day, 1 week, 2 weeks, 6 weeks and 7 weeks. In both microarray analyses, minor elevation in the expression of IGFIR in the resistant cells was identified. Further to these experiments parental and resistant cells were profiled on phosphoRTK (receptor tyrosine kinase) arrays. It was found that only IGFIR is strongly phosphorylated in the resistant DMS114 cells compared to the parental DMS114 cells where IGFIR was not found to be phosphorylated. In order to evaluate whether IGFIR plays a role in the survival and proliferation of DMS114 resistant cells, a Alamar blue proliferation assay was performed with the parental and resistant cells in the presence of the IGFIR inhibitors GSK1838705A and BMS-754807. It was found that both IGFIR inhibitors strongly inhibited the proliferation of the resistant DMS114 cells, but not the parental cells, suggesting that the DMS114 cells resistant to the FGFR inhibitor compound A, have IGFIR activated and are dependent on the IGFIR signaling pathway for their proliferation, (see Table below). The finding of IGFIR signaling activation as a driver of resistance to the tested FGFR inhibitor in DMSl 14 supports combination treatment with both a FGFR and a IGFIR inhibitor to overcome the emerging of the resistance to a FGFR inhibitor in the DMSl 14 cells. An experiment was performed where the two agents (FGFR inhibitor: 1 microM compound A, and IGFIR inhibitor: 300nM BMS-754807; or FGFR inhibitor: 1 microM compound A, and IGFIR inhibitor: 1 microM GSK1838705A) were combined from the beginning. There were also treatments of the cells with single agents with or without DMSO or treatments with DMSO alone to serve as vehicle control. The proliferation of the cells was followed using the Incucyt machine, measuring the % of confluence of the cells over time. In this experiment that was performed in an analogous way as described above for test 1 , it was observed that treatment with the IGFIR inhibitors alone, as well as DMSO treatment did not impact the proliferation of the DMSl 14 cells. The treatment of the cells with the FGFR inhibitor (1 microM compound A) initially blocked the proliferation, but after two- three weeks emerging outgrowth of compound insensitive cells was observed, so the cells gained capacity to proliferate again, which matches with the above indicated finding that after about two- three week of the continuous inhibition of the FGFR pathway with compound A the insensitive resistant subpopulation of cells in DMSl 14 cells gained capacity to grow out. Importantly, the combined treatment of FGFR inhibitor (compound A 1 microM) and IGFIR inhibitor (BMS-754807 or GSK1838705A) completely prevented emergence of resistance. See Figure 1 and 2. An additional experiment was run wherein the resistant DMSl 14 cells were exposed to 1 microM of GSK1838705A and the growth/proliferation of the cells was monitored on the Incucyte machine. Cells were kept under this condition for over 33 days, and the medium was replaced twice a week. It was found that the proliferation of the resistant cells kept in the presence of compound A, when treated with an IGFIR inhibitor completely blocked and over the long term treatment (>30 days) did not gain ability to grow out. See Figure 3. It was hence found that FGFR inhibitor compound A inhibits the proliferation of DMSl 14 cells (IC50 8.54E-09 M). However, there is an instrinsic resistance that leads to outgrowth of compound insensitive cells in about two to three weeks after initial and continuous exposure to the FGFR inhibitor. IGFIR activation was identified as a mechanism of resistance to FGFR inhibition in DMSl 14 cells. Upfront treatment with a FGFR inhibitor and a IGFIR inhibitor was found to be a potent and effective approach to block emergence of the intrinsic resistance.
