The present invention relates to a polyolefin composition with improved electrical breakdown strength, to a wire or cable, in particular a medium, high or extra high voltage cable, comprising such a composition, and to the use of such a composition for the production of a wire or cable, in particular a medium, high or extra high voltage cable. A typical medium voltage power cable, usually used for voltages from 6 to 36 kV, a typical high voltage cable used for voltages higher than 36 kV, and a typical extra high voltage cable used for voltages higher than 220 kV, comprises one or more conductors in a cable core that is surrounded by several layers of polymeric materials, including an inner semiconducting layer, followed by an insulating layer, and then an outer semiconducting layer. These layers are normally cross-linked. To these layers, further layers may be added, such as a metallic tape or wire shield, screens, and, finally, outermost jacketing layer(s). The layers of the cable are based on different types of polymer compositions. As insulating materials, today cross-linked polyolefins like cross-linked low density polyethylene are predominantly used. It is a constant aim of cable manufacturers to increase the electrical breakdown strength of cable materials, in particular cable insulation materials, in order to achieve greater reliability or to develop new cable constructions where the insulation is subjected to higher stress. Defects in the insulation set a limit on the minimum insulation thickness and thereby maximum electrical design stress applied to the cable. To secure high reliability on high stress cable constructions it is known to reduce the amount of contaminants in the insulation material. However, nowadays already super clean materials are used for insulation, and improvements in electrical breakdown strength by further reduction of contaminants are associated with a significant increase in cost. It is furthermore known to use active additives, namely so called voltage stabilisers, in order to increase the electrical breakdown strength of cable insulation materials. For example, in U.S. Pat. No. 3,482,033 it is disclosed to use a blend of non-volatile hydrocarbon oil of high aromatic content or a highly aromatic, low melting hydrocarbon together with active voltage stabilisers such as polyhalopolyphenyls or nitro-group containing aromatics. Furthermore, voltage stabilisers are known from WO 01/08166. In this document, voltage stabilisers based on benzophenone as core molecule substituted with alkyl, aryl, alkoxy and aryloxy groups are disclosed. However, there is still the need for voltage stabilisers which improve the electrical breakdown strength of polyolefin compositions used for medium/high/extra high voltage cable isolation. Such voltage stabiliser compounds should usually have a low ionisation potential to decrease the energy of high energy electrons and hence increase the electrical breakdown strength efficiently (see e.g. A. C. Ashcraft, R. M. Eichhorn, and S. R. G., “Laboratory Studies of Treeing in Solid Dielectrics and Voltage Stabilization of Polyethylene” presented as I.E.E.E. International Symposium on Electrical Insulation, Montreal, Canada, 1978). At the same time, the compounds must be soluble in the polyolefin, usually cross-linked polyethylene, used as a matrix polymer in the composition, and, furthermore, must show low migration tendency, so that the loss of the compound in the insulation material with time is as low as possible. Still further, as usually insulating compositions are cross-linked polyolefins, the voltage stabiliser must as far as possible be compatible to commonly used cross-linking agents, such as organic peroxides, so that, on the one hand, the cross-linking process is not negatively affected, and, on the other hand, the voltage stabiliser is not reacting or decomposing which would reduce its efficiency or even, in the worst case, render it inactive. Of course, the voltage stabiliser should also be compatible in this sense with regard to all other components of the polyolefin composition. It is thus an object, to provide a polyolefin composition comprising a voltage stabiliser for improving the electrical breakdown strength of a polyolefin composition, especially for the use as an insulating composition in a medium/high/extra high voltage cable, which has the above-mentioned properties. In particular the voltage stabiliser provides a significant improvement in electrical breakdown, has preferably also a good solubility in the polyolefin matrix and a low migration tendency, and more preferably is compatible with regard to other components of the polyolefin composition, in particular to cross-linking agents. It has now surprisingly been found that the above objects can be achieved by a polyolefin composition, a masterbatch both comprising a benzil derivative as well as the use of said benzil derivative, which comprises one or more substituents at the phenyl groups of the benzil molecule comprising a hydrocarbyl group, as a voltage stabiliser compound. The present invention therefore provides a polyolefin composition comprising (i) a polyolefin (A),(ii) a benzil derivative (B) comprising the, preferably consisting of the, structural unit according to the following formula (I): wherein one or more of the carbon atoms in the phenyl rings to which residue R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7, R8, R9 or R10 is attached may also be a heteroatom, such as N, in which case the respective residue R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7, R8, R9 or R10 is not present; R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7, R8, R9 and R10 independently are hydrogen, or a hydrocarbyl group which may contain heteroatoms; or at least two of said R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7, R8, R9 and R10 together with the ring atoms of the ring system of formula (I) they are attached to, form a further aromatic or non-aromatic ring fused to the ring system of formula (I), and wherein the ring system of formula (I) with said at least one fused further ring may further bear one to eight substituents, R1′ to R8′, each of which are independently selected from said same groups as R1 to R10; and n=2 to 9; with the proviso that (i) at least one of said R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7, R8, R9 or R10, or if present, at least one of said R1′ to R8′, is a hydrocarbyl group which may contain one or more heteroatoms. The term “hydrocarbyl group” denotes any substituent which is composed of carbon and hydrogen atoms regardless of the degree of saturation, e.g. alkyl groups, alkenyl groups, alkinyl groups and aromatic groups composed of C and H. Where it is indicated that a hydrocarbyl group may contain heteroatoms these are atoms different from C and H, such as Si, N, P, O or S, typically N or O. It has been found that the use of the above compounds as voltage stabiliser yields insulating polyolefin compositions with significantly improved electrical breakdown strength. The improvement in electrical breakdown strength can be seen from the high values of the molal voltage stabilisation as measured hereinafter. Furthermore, the compounds have a good solubility in the polyolefin matrix and a low migration tendency, and are compatible with the other components of the polyolefin composition, in particular with cross-linking agents. If any of said R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7 or R8, and, if present, any of said R1′ to R8′ is a hydrocarbyl group which may contain one or more heteroatoms, is attached to an aromatic ring of the compound according to formula (I), it is preferred that said hydrocarbyl group is free of H atoms in the alpha-position.

However, cross-linking may also be achieved by hydrolysable silane groups which may be present in polyolefin (A). Thus, polyolefin (A) may also comprise or consist of a cross-linkable polyolefin containing hydrolysable silane groups. Hydrolysable silane groups are typically crosslinked by a condensation catalyst in the presence of water. The hydrolysable silane groups may be introduced into the polyolefin by copolymerisation of e.g. ethylene monomers with silane group containing comonomers or by grafting, i.e. by chemical modification of the polymer by addition of silane groups mostly in a radical reaction. Both techniques are well known in the art.

The amount of each type of double bond is measured as indicated in the experimental part. The incorporation of the total amount of carbon-carbon double bonds within the polyolefin component enables to accomplish improved cross-linking properties.

It is also possible to use polar comonomers, optionally in combination with the non polar alpha olefin comonomer(s). Preferably, as polar monomer units, compounds containing hydroxyl groups, alkoxy groups, carbonyl groups, carboxyl groups, ether, and ester groups are used. Still more preferably, the polar monomer units are selected from the group of alkyl acrylates, alkyl methacrylates, and vinyl acetates or mixtures therefrom. Further preferred, the comonomers are selected from C1- to C6-alkyl acrylates, C1- to C6-alkyl methacrylates, and vinyl acetate. Still more preferably, the polar copolymer comprises a copolymer of ethylene with C1- to C4-alkyl, such as methyl, ethyl, propyl or butyl acrylates or vinyl acetate, or any mixture thereof. If polar comonomer units are present in polyolefin (A) it is preferred that the amount is as defined above. When preparing the unsaturated polyolefin such as an unsaturated polyethylene in a high pressure process, the polymerisation is generally performed at pressures in the range of 120 to 350 MPa and at temperatures in the range of 150 to 350° C.

The upper limit of the total amount of the vinyl groups present in the polymer composition is typically, in the given preference order, of up to 4.0/1000 carbon atoms, of up to 3.0/1000 carbon atoms, up to 2.5/1000 carbon atoms, or of up to 2.0/1000 carbon atoms. Accordingly, the total amount the vinyl groups, if present, contributes to the total amount of C—C double bonds present in the polymer composition. The total amount of vinyl groups can e.g. consist of any the above mentioned vinyl groups from the polymer and, if present, added other additives such as boosters, scorch retarders or other further additive(s). From the polymer composition described above, a cross-linked composition can be prepared by blending with a cross-linking agent, followed by treatment under cross-linking conditions, thereby increasing the cross-linking level. Cross-linking can be effected by treatment at increased temperature, e.g. at a temperature of at least in the range of 150-160° C. When peroxides are used, cross-linking is generally initiated by increasing the temperature to the decomposition temperature of the corresponding peroxide. When the peroxide decomposes, radicals are generated from the peroxide. These radicals then initiate the cross-linking reaction. The total amount of additive(s) in the polyolefin composition according to the invention is generally 0.05 to 15 wt. %, preferably 0.1 to 12 wt. %, more preferably 0.1 to 10 wt. %. From the polymer composition of the present invention, a multilayered is article can be prepared wherein at least one layer comprises said polymer composition. When cross-linking is initiated, a cross-linked multilayered article is obtained. Preferably, the multilayered article (either cross-linked or not) is a cable, preferably a power cable. In the context of the present invention, a power cable is defined to be a cable transferring energy operating at any voltage. The voltage applied to the power cable can be alternating (AC), direct (DC), or transient (impulse). In a preferred embodiment, the multilayered article is a power cable operating at voltages higher than 1 kV. In other preferred embodiments, the power cable prepared according to the present invention is operating at 6 kV or higher. The power cable can be prepared in a process wherein the composition of the present invention, optionally in combination with a cross-linking agent, is applied onto a substrate by extrusion. In such an extrusion process, the sequence of mixing the components of the composition can be varied, as explained below. According to a preferred embodiment, the polyolefin (A), optionally in combination with other polymer component(s), and the compound (B) are mixed with each other and possibly with further additive(s), either on solid pellets or powder of the different polymer components or by melt mixing, followed by forming pellets from the melt. Subsequently, if used, the cross-linking agent, preferably a peroxide, and optionally a scorch retarder and/or a cross-linking booster are added to the pellets or powder in a second step. Alternatively, the scorch retarder and/or cross-linking booster could already be added in the first step, together with the additives. The final pellets are fed to the extruder, e.g. a cable extruder. According to another preferred embodiment, instead of a two-step process, the polyolefin (A) and any further polymeric component(s) of the composition, preferably in the form of pellets or powder, compound (B) and, optionally, the further additives, cross-linking agent, and/or scorch retarder, are added to a compounding extruder, single or twin screw. Preferably, the compounding extruder is operated under careful temperature control. According to another preferred embodiment, a mix of component (B) with all other additives, i.e. including antioxidant (s) and cross-linking agent and optionally a scorch retarder and/or further additives such as a cross-linking booster, are added onto the pellets or powder made of the polyolefin (A) and optionally other polymer component(s). According to another preferred embodiment, pellets made of the polyolefin (A) and compound (B), optionally further containing further polymeric components and additional further additive(s), are prepared in a first step, e.g. by melt mixing. These pellets, obtained from the melt mixing, are then fed into the cable extruder. Optionally, subsequently, cross-linking agent and optionally a scorch retarder and/or a cross-linking booster are either fed prior to the hopper, in the hopper or directly into the cable extruder and optionally together with further polymeric components if they have not been added in the first step. Alternatively, cross-linking agent and/or scorch retarder and/or cross-linking booster are already added to the pellets before feeding these pellets into the cable extruder or only the crosslinking agent is added prior to the hopper, in the hopper or directly in the cable extruder if all other components already have been added in earlier step(s). According to another preferred embodiment, pellets made of the polyolefin (A) and any further polymeric component(s) without any additional further component(s) are fed to the extruder. Subsequently, component (B) and optionally antioxidant(s), cross-linking agent(s) and optionally a scorch retarder, optionally in combination further additive(s) such as a cross-linking booster, are either fed in the hopper or directly fed into the polymeric melt within the cable extruder. The compound (B) could be added in this step instead, together with the antioxidant(s), cross-linking agent, scorch retarder and the other optional additives used. Alternatively, one or more of these components, i.e. cross-linking agent, scorch retarder, cross-linking booster, antioxidant(s), compound (B) or a mixture of these components is already added to the pellets before feeding these pellets into the cable extruder, e.g. the components not already present in the fed pellets that should be present in the cable needs to be added at any position in the cable extrusion step. According to another preferred embodiment, the compound (B) can also be provided in a master batch which comprises at least a matrix polymer and the compound (B). Compound (B) could also be present in the pellets and antioxidant (s), crosslinking agent etc could be added in one or more masterbatches. The master batch is then added to or mixed with the polyolefin (A) and possibly further polymer components and further processed in a known manner to produce an article, such as power cable. When producing a power cable by extrusion, the polymer composition can be applied onto the metallic conductor and/or at least one coating layer thereof, e.g. a semiconductive layer or insulating layer. Typical extrusion conditions are mentioned in WO 93/08222. Compounding may be performed by any known compounding process, including extruding the final product with a screw extruder or a kneader. The present invention furthermore relates to a wire or cable, comprising the polyolefin composition in any of the above described embodiments. In a preferred embodiment, the invention relates to a medium, high or extra high voltage cable comprising one or more conductors in a cable core, an inner semiconducting layer, followed by an insulating layer, and then an outer semiconducting layer, wherein at least one of these layers, preferably the insulating layer, comprises the polyolefin composition as described above. The term “conductor” means herein above and below that the conductor comprises one or more wires. Moreover, the cable may comprise one or more such conductors. Preferably the conductor is an electrical conductor. One or more of those layers may also be cross-linked. In addition to the semiconductive and insulating layers, further layers may be present in medium, high or extra high voltage cables, such as a metallic tape or wire shield, screen(s) and, finally, outermost jacketing layer(s). The invention relates furthermore to the use of the polyolefin composition in any of the above described embodiments for the production of a layer of a wire or cable, preferably of a layer, more preferably an insulating layer, of a medium, high or extra high voltage cable. The polyolefin composition according to the present invention comprising the above voltage stabiliser compound is improved especially in electrical breakdown strength and thus achieving an excellent molal voltage stabilisation, measured in the electrical tree testing method described below. This behaviour renders the polyolefin compositions of the present invention highly suitable for the use as a medium/high/extra high voltage cable isolation. Preferred embodiments of this polyolefin composition are those comprising the above described components (A), polyolefin (A) and (B) in any of their above-described embodiments and amounts. Finally, the invention relates to the use of a benzil derivative (B) as a voltage stabiliser in a polyolefin composition, said benzil derivative (B) comprising the, preferably consisting of the, structural unit according to the following formula (I): wherein one or more of the carbon atoms in the phenyl rings to which residue R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7, R8, R9 or R10 is attached may also be a heteroatom, such as N, in which case the respective residue R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7, R8, R9 or R10 is not present; R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7, R8, R9 and R10 independently are hydrogen, or a hydrocarbyl group which may contain heteroatoms; or at least two of said R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7, R8, R9 and R10 together with the ring atoms of the ring system of formula (I) they are attached to, form a further aromatic or non-aromatic ring fused to the ring system of formula (I), and wherein the ring system of formula (I) with said at least one fused further ring may further bear one to eight substituents, R1′ to R8′, each of which are independently selected from said same groups as R1 to R10; and n=2 to 9; with the proviso that (i) at least one of said R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7, R8, R9 or R10, or if present, at least one of said R1′ to R8′, is a hydrocarbyl group which may contain heteroatoms. The following examples serve to further illustrate the present invention. EXAMPLES 1. Measurement Methods a) Melt Flow Rate The melt flow rate (MFR) is determined according to ISO 1133 and is indicated in g/10 min. The MFR is an indication of the flowability, and hence the processability, of the polymer. The higher the melt flow rate, the lower the viscosity of the polymer. The MFR is determined at 190° C. for polyethylenes and may be determined at different loadings such as 2.16 kg (MFR2) or 21.6 kg (MFR21). The MFR is determined at 230° C. for polypropylenes. b) Determination of the Amount of Double Bonds The procedure for the determination of the amount of double bonds/1000 Carbon atoms is based upon the ASTM D3124-72 method. In that method, a detailed description for the determination of vinylidene groups/1000 Carbon atoms is given based on 2,3-dimethyl-1,3-butadiene. The described sample preparation procedure has also been applied for the determination of vinyl groups/1000 Carbon atoms, vinylidene groups/1000 Carbon atoms and trans-vinylene groups/1000 Carbon atoms in the present invention. However, for the determination of the extinction coefficient for these three types of double bonds, the following three compounds have been used: 1-decene for vinyl, 2-methyl-1-heptene for vinylidene and trans-4-decene for trans-vinylene, and the procedure as described in ASTM-D3124 section 9 was followed. The total amount of double bonds was analysed by means of IR is spectrometry and given as the amount of vinyl bonds/1000 carbon atoms, vinylidene bonds/1000 carbon atoms and trans-vinylene bonds/1000 carbon atoms, respectively. Thin films were pressed with a thickness of 0.5-1.0 mm. The actual thickness was measured. FT-IR analysis was performed on a Perkin Elmer 2000. Four scans were recorded with a resolution of 4 cm−1. A base line was drawn from 980 cm−1 to around 840 cm−1. The peak heights were determined at around 888 cm−1 for vinylidene, around 910 cm−1 for vinyl and around 965 cm−1 for trans-vinylene. The amount of double bonds/1000 carbon atoms was calculated using the following formulas: [in-line-formulae]vinylidene/1000 Carbon atoms=(14×A)/(18.24×L×D)[/in-line-formulae][in-line-formulae]vinyl/1000 Carbon atoms=(14×A)/(13.13×L×D)[/in-line-formulae][in-line-formulae]trans-vinylene/1000 Carbon atoms=(14×A)/(15.14×L×D)[/in-line-formulae] wherein A: absorbance (peak height)L: film thickness in mmD: density of the material (g/cm3) c) Determination of the Vinyl Content Originating from the Polyunsaturated Compound The amount of vinyl groups originating from the polyunsaturated comonomer per 1000 carbon atoms was determined and calculated as follows: The polymer to be analysed and a reference polymer have been produced on the same reactor, basically using the same conditions, i.e. similar peak temperatures, pressure and production rate, but with the only difference that the polyunsaturated comonomer is added to polymer to be analysed and not added to reference polymer. The total amount of vinyl groups of is each polymer was determined by FT-IR measurements, as described above. Then, it is assumed that the base level of vinyl groups, i.e. the ones formed by the process and from chain transfer agents resulting in vinyl groups (if present), is the same for the reference polymer and the polymer to be analysed with the only exception that in the polymer to be analysed also a polyunsaturated comonomer is added to the reactor. This base level is then subtracted from the measured amount of vinyl groups in the polymer to be analysed, thereby resulting in the amount of vinyl groups/1000 carbon atoms, which result from the polyunsaturated comonomer. d) Density Density of the polymer was measured according to ISO 1183/D. 2.

After three cycles of vacuum/N2 flushing it was left under nitrogen while 15 ml toluene and 4.5 ml of deionized water, both degassed with nitrogen, was added. During stirring, 5.8 ml of dioctylamine was added dropwise after which the solution was heated to reflux for 20 h. The reaction mixture was then quenched with deionized water, extracted with dichloromethane three times, washed with brine (saturated aqueous NaCl solution) two times and dried over magnesium sulfate.

A yield of 14.4 mol % was obtained. b) Production and Testing of Compositions Several compositions including voltage stabilisers for the preparation of insulating layers were prepared and tested together with a reference polymer without voltage stabiliser according to the following procedures: Material and Test Set Up for Electrical Tree Testing In each test for general definitions and for the examples of this application the test arrangement was the same for the reference polymer, i.e. the polymer without the voltage stabilizing compounds to be tested, and for is the tested compositions, i.e. the reference polymer containing the voltage stabilizing compounds. A commercially available cross-linkable low density polyethylene (LDPE) with a grade name, Supercure™ LS4201S, supplied by Borealis, Sweden, which was prepared by high pressure polymerization and had a density of 0.922 g/cm3 (ISO1872-2/ISO1183-2), MFR2 (ISO 1133, load 2.16 kg, at 190° C.) of 2 g/10 min was used as the polymer for preparing the compositions and the reference polymer to be tested. The reference polymer was in a form of pellets which contained dicumyl peroxide as a cross-linking agent. Sample Preparation for Electrical Tree Testing Impregnation The reference polymer pellets for electrical tree testing was ground to a fine powder in a Retsch grinder with a 500 micrometer sieve. For the preparation of the compositions according to the invention and the preparation of the comparative compositions, the obtained powder was impregnated with the respective test voltage stabiliser dissolved in appropriate organic solvent for one hour while agitated every 15 minutes. The solvent was then removed by means of rotary evaporation and to vacuum oven to obtain a dry powder with a homogeneously distributed voltage stabiliser. The following compounds were used in the tested compositions as voltage stabilisers: Example 3 4,4′-di(dodecyloxy)benzil Example 4 4,4′-di(undec-10-enyloxy)benzil Example 5 N,N,N′,N′-tetraoctylbenzil-4,4′-diamine Preparation of Test Objects The impregnated powder is then moulded into plaques with a thickness of 6 mm according to the below stated molding and cross-linking procedure. The molding and cross-linking cycle of the plaques starts at 2 kN for 3 minutes and ranges from 2 kN to 200 kN over 18 minutes with a load increase rate of 11 kN/min and is withheld at 200 kN for the rest of the duration of the molding and cross-linking cycle. During the molding cycle the temperature is set at 130° C. at the beginning of the cycle and is set at this temperature for the first six minutes after which it increases to 180° C. during 15 minutes with a temperature increase rate of 3.3° C./min and is maintained at 180° C. for 15 minutes for completing the cross-linking of the plaques before descending to room temperature over a period of approximately 30 minutes. The pressed plaques are degassed at 1 atm at 90° C. during 4 days. The samples are then cut to a size of 25.5 mm×21 mm×6 mm (+/−0.5 mm). To generate the electrical field needed for electrical treeing one sharp, tip radius 3 μm and one dull needle, tip radius 5 mm, are used. Before use the needles are examined and washed with isopropanol. The needles are then inserted into the plaque from opposite sides on each of the 21 mm×6 mm surfaces with the help of a fixture to ensure the centricity of the needles, as detailed in “ASTM D3756-97 (2004) “Standard Test Method for Evaluation of Resistance to Electrical Breakdown by Treeing in Solid Dielectric Materials Using Diverging Fields,” E. Series, Ed., ed: ASTM International, 2004. The sharp needle has a radius of 3 μm and the dull needle has a radius of 0.5 mm. Before the insertion of the needles into the plaques the fixture with plaques are placed in an oven at 120° C. for 90 minutes after which the needles are inserted slowly until they are 3.5 mm apart. The samples are left in the oven at 120° C. for another 30 minutes before the oven is turned off and the samples are left to reach room temperature inside the oven during 10 h. The samples are then stored under constant conditions 23° C. and 50% RH until they are put in the test cell. The electrical tree testing is also done at 23° C. and 50% RH. c) Results 1. Electrical Treeing Evaluation The electrical field at which the insulation material starts to exhibit electrical treeing, also called electrical tree inception, is evaluated with a conventional double needle approach. The needle configuration is explained in detail in A. C. Ashcraft, et al., “Labarotory Studies of Treeing in Solid Dielectrics and Voltage Stabilization of Polyethylene,” Montreal, Canada, 1978, pp. 213-218 and in ASTM D3756-97 (2004) “Standard Test Method for Evaluation of Resistance to Electrical Breakdown by Treeing in Solid Dielectric Materials Using Diverging Fields,” E. Series, Ed., ed: ASTM International, 2004. Instead of applying constant AC voltage the voltage is increased with a rate of 10V/min, starting at 8 kV and with a highest level of 22 kV. The electrode system is connected to a partial discharge detector which will shut off the high voltage upon detecting discharges. The samples are then cut into thin slices and examined under microscope to establish whether an electrical tree is responsible for generating the partial discharges at which the equipment has shut off. If a tree is located the sample is counted as a breakdown, if no tree is seen the sample is counted as a flash over and will be suspended/censored in the statistic evaluation. 2. Analysis of Results The tree initiation voltage for the material was determined by applying 2 parameter Weibull statistics according to the IEC standard “Guide for the Statistical Analysis of Electrical Insulation Breakdown Data, Vol. IEC 62539:2007(E), ed. Geneva: The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), 2007” to the breakdowns recorded. From the Weibull statistics a scale parameter was obtained from the commercial software WinSmith Weibull 4.0 by Fulton Findings and this was reported as the electrical tree inception voltage. For comparison of the efficiency of the different additives, the efficiency factor MVS (Molal Voltage Stabilisation) which is based on a molal basis was used (A. C. Ashcraft, et al., “Labarotory Studies of Treeing in Solid Dielectrics and Voltage Stabilization of Polyethylene,” Montreal, Canada, 1978, pp. 213-218). The MVS is defined as the difference between the reference material with and without stabiliser divided by the molal amount of stabiliser added.
