Example 1
This example describes the synthesis of a photoacid-generating (PAG) compound designated PAG A. PAG A was synthesized in two steps as depicted in FIG. 1. The procedure for first step was adapted from the procedure reported by Aoyama et al., Synthesis, 2008, volume 13, pages 2089-2099. Thus, a mixture of 3-chlorobutan-2-one (1, 10.0 grams, 93.3 millimoles), naphthalene-2-thiol (2, 15.0 grams, 93.8 millimoles), 5.0 grams of silica gel supported sodium carbonate (Na2CO3/SiO2, 1.0:5.3 weight/weight) and 5.0 grams of silica gel-supported polyphosphoric acid (PPA/SiO2, 1:9 weight/weight) in 60 milliliters of chlorobenzene was stirred at 120Â° C. for 16 hours. The silica supported reagents were removed by filtration and the filtrate was evaporated to produce crude product 1,2-dimethylnaphtho[2,1-b]thiophene (3), which was purified by flash column chromatography using CH2Cl2 as a solvent. To the resulting CH2Cl2 solution was added 5.0 g of activated carbon and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 15 minutes. The activated carbon was removed by filtration and the CH2Cl2 was completely removed under reduced pressure to produce the pure product 3. Yield 16.9 grams (85%).
