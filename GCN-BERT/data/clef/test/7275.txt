FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention is generally related to co-crystal compositions containing nutraceuticals. Such compositions may be used in the preparation of (or even as) pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, nutritional supplements, food compositions and the like. BACKGROUND ART Nutraceuticals are a class of natural product that is attracting increasing attention. Nutraceuticals refer to a food or food component claimed to human health benefits. Nutraceuticals more specifically relate to individual chemicals present in foods and are commonly marketed as dietary supplements. Examples of nutraceuticals include amino acids and amino acid derivatives such as sarcosine, nicotinic acid, pantothenic acid, and gamma-linoleic acid; and purine derivatives, such as xanthines. Dietary polyphenols are one category of nutraceuticals and represent a wide variety of compounds that occur in fruits, vegetables, wine, tea, extra virgin olive oil, chocolate and other cocoa products. They are mostly derivatives and/or isomers of flavones, isoflavones, flavonols, catechins, and phenolic acids, and exhibit many biologically significant functions, such as protection against oxidative stress, and degenerative diseases. Experimental data indicate that most of these biological actions can be attributed to their intrinsic antioxidant capabilities, and dietary polyphenols are the most abundant antioxidants in human diets. Dietary polyphenols may offer an indirect protection by activating endogenous defense systems and by modulating cellular signaling processes such as nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) activation, activator protein-1 (AP-1) DNA binding, glutathione biosynthesis, phosphoinositide 3 (PI3)-kinase/protein kinase B (Akt) pathway, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) proteins [extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK), c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and P38] activation, and the translocation into the nucleus of nuclear factor erythroid 2 related factor 2 (Nrf2) (Han et al. 2007). Additionally, certain nutraceuticals, namely EGCG and caffeine, have been shown to reduce beta-amyloid levels and plaque formation in transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD is a devastating neurodegenerative disease that currently affects an estimated 4.5 million Americans, costing the United States more than $100 billion annually. Finding a treatment that could delay onset by five years could reduce the number of individuals with AD by nearly 50 percent after 50 years. The nutraceutical quercetin has been reported to have therapeutic effects against neurodegenerative disease in various animal models. The widespread distribution of flavonoid and other nutraceuticals means that they are ingested in significant quantities by animals. Furthermore, their variety, their relatively low toxicity compared to, for example, alkaloids, and their biological activity means that consumers, food manufacturers, nutraceutical manufacturers, and pharmaceutical companies have become interested in flavonoids for their medicinal properties. Nutraceuticals can be prepared so as to have a variety of different chemical forms including chemical derivatives or salts. Such nutraceuticals can also be prepared to have different physical forms. For example, the nutraceuticals may be amorphous, may have different crystalline polymorphs, or may exist in different solvation or hydration states. By varying the form of a nutraceutical, it is possible to vary the physical properties thereof. For example, crystalline polymorphs typically have different solubilities from one another, such that a more thermodynamically stable polymorph is less soluble than a less thermodynamically stable polymorph. Pharmaceutical polymorphs can also differ in properties such as shelf-life, bioavailability, morphology, vapour pressure, density, colour, and compressibility. Accordingly, variation of the crystalline state of a nutraceutical is one of many ways in which to modulate the physical properties thereof. A co-crystal is a multiple component crystal containing two or more non-identical molecules in which all components are solid under ambient conditions (i.e. 22° Celsius, 1 atmosphere of pressure) when in their pure form. The components comprise a target molecule (i.e., a nutraceutical) and a molecular co-crystal former that coexist in the co-crystal at the molecular level within a single crystal. Co-crystals that comprise two or more molecules (co-crystal formers) (Almarsson et al., 2004) that are solids under ambient conditions represent a long-known class of compounds (see Wohler, 1844). However, co-crystals remain relatively unexplored. A Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) (Allen et al., 1993) survey reveals that co-crystals represent less than 0.5% of published crystal structures. Nevertheless, their potential impact upon pharmaceutical (e.g., nutraceutical) formulation (Vishweshwar et al., 2006; Li et al., 2006; Remenar et al., 2003; and Childs et al., 2004) and green chemistry (Anastas et al., 1998) is of topical and growing interest. In particular, the fact that all co-crystal components are solids under ambient conditions has important practical considerations because synthesis of co-crystals can be achieved via solid-state techniques (mechanochemistry)(Shan et al., 2002), and chemists can execute a degree of control over the composition of a co-crystal since they can invoke molecular recognition, especially hydrogen bonding, during the selection of co-crystal formation. Those features distinguish co-crystals from solvates which are another broad and well-known group of multiple component compounds. Solvates are much more widely characterized than co-crystals (e.g., 1652 co-crystals are reported in the CSD versus 10,575 solvates; version 5.27 (May 2006) 3D coordinates, R<0.075, no ions, organics only). Whereas solid-state organic synthesis represents a well-established area of research (Tanaka et al., 2003; Tanaka et al., 2000; Kaupp et al., 2005), co-crystal controlled solid-state synthesis has been limited to photodimerizations or photopolymerizations (MacGillivray et al., 2000; Fowler et al., 2000) and nucleophilic substitution (Etter et al., 1989). In the case of photodimerizations or photopolymerizations, one co-crystal former typically serves to align or “template” the reactant, which is the other co-crystal former. In the case of the nucleophilic substitution, both co-crystal formers are reactants; although there are examples of solid-state reactions in which the reactive moieties are in the same molecule and therefore generate polymeric structures (Foxman et al., 2000). It would be advantageous to have new forms of nutraceuticals that have improved properties, in particular, as oral formulations. Specifically, it is desirable to identify improved forms of nutraceuticals that exhibit significantly improved properties including increased aqueous solubility and stability. Further, it is desirable to improve the processability, or preparation of pharmaceutical formulations. For example, needle-like crystal forms or habits of nutraceuticals can cause aggregation, even in compositions where the nutraceutical is mixed with other substances, such that a non-uniform mixture is obtained. It is also desirable to increase or decrease the dissolution rate of nutraceutical-containing pharmaceutical compositions in water, increase or decrease the bioavailability of orally-administered compositions, and provide a more rapid or more delayed onset to therapeutic effect. It is also desirable to have a form of the nutraceutical which, when administered to a subject, reaches a peak plasma level faster or slower, has a longer lasting therapeutic plasma concentration, and higher or lower overall exposure when compared to equivalent amounts of the nutraceutical in its presently-known form. The improved properties discussed above can be altered in a way which is most beneficial to a specific nutraceutical for a specific therapeutic effect. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Among the various aspects of the invention is the provision of nutraceutical co-crystals, a process for the preparation of such co-crystals, and methods for improving animal health or nutrition by administering such co-crystals (alone or in combination with other compositions or as a component thereof) to a human or other animal. Advantageously, the nutraceutical co-crystals provide improved properties, in particular, as oral formulations. Such properties may include one or more of increased aqueous solubility and stability, improved processability, improved biological activity, improved biological availability, improved dissolution, and improved plasma profile. In addition, the properties may be altered in a way which is most beneficial to a specific nutraceutical for a specific therapeutic effect. These crystalline forms possess a range of desirable properties and may be used as a nutraceutical, as part of a pharmaceutical composition, nutritional supplements, foodstuffs, and the like.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The present invention is generally directed to co-crystals comprising at least one nutraceutical compound and at least one co-crystal former. These co-crystals may be included in compositions (optionally also including other components such as pharmaceutically acceptable excipients, other nutritional supplements, etc.) having utility as pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, nutritional supplements, and foodstuffs. The co-crystals of the present invention, referred to herein as nutraceutical co-crystals, are co-crystals that are formed between a molecular or ionic nutraceutical and a stoichiometric amount of a second molecule (the co-crystal former) that is a solid under ambient conditions (i.e. 22° C., 1 atmosphere of pressure). Although a number of nutraceutical co-crystals are within the ambit of this invention, an example of such nutraceutical co-crystals are co-crystals of flavonoids and xanthines (wherein the flavonoid is the nutraceutical and the xanthine is the co-crystal former). The nutraceutical co-crystals of the present invention are crystalline material comprised of two or more unique (non-identical) solids at room temperature (i.e. 22° C.) in generally about a stoichiometric ratio, each co-existing in the co-crystal at the molecular level within the single crystal and each containing distinctive physical characteristics, such as structure, melting point and heats of fusion. The co-crystal can be constructed through several modes of molecular recognition including hydrogen-bonding, π(pi)-stacking, guest-host complexation and Van-der-Waals interactions. The co-crystals may include one or more solvate or water molecules in the crystalline lattice. That is, solvates or hydrates of co-crystals, or a co-crystal further comprising a solvent, or water or compound that is a liquid at room temperature, is included in the present invention, but crystalline material comprised of only one solid and one or more liquids (at room temperature) are not included in the present invention. The co-crystals may also be a co-crystal between a co-crystal former (such as L-ascorbic acid) and a salt of a nutraceutical, but the nutraceutical and the co-crystal former (such as L-ascorbic acid) of the present invention are constructed or bonded together through hydrogen bonds. Of the interactions listed above, hydrogen-bonding is believed to be the dominant interaction in the formation of the co-crystal, whereby a non-covalent bond is formed between a hydrogen bond donor of one of the moieties and a hydrogen bond acceptor of the other. Hydrogen bonding can result in several different intermolecular configurations. For example, hydrogen bonds can result in the formation of dimers, linear chains, or cyclic structures. These configurations can further include extended (two-dimensional) hydrogen bond networks and isolated triads. Accordingly, in a first aspect, the present invention provides a nutraceutical composition comprising a co-crystal of a nutraceutical and a co-crystal former, such that the nutraceutical and co-crystal former are capable of co-crystallizing from a solution phase under crystallization conditions or from the solid-state, for example, through grinding, heating, or through vapor transfer (e.g., co-sublimation). Thus, the nutraceutical co-crystals of the present invention are formed where the nutraceutical and co-crystal former are bonded together through hydrogen bonds. Other non-covalent interactions, including pi-stacking and van der Waals interactions, may also be present. In an embodiment, non-aqueous, non-solvent impurities may be present in the co-crystal composition. In general, it is preferred that the co-crystal composition contains less than 1% by weight impurities but impurities can represent up to 25% by weight. In certain embodiments, greater degree of purity may be desired; in such instances, it may be preferred that the crystalline material contain less than 0.5% by weight impurities; less than 0.1% by weight impurities; or even less than 0.01% by weight impurities. In one embodiment, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical co-crystal composition, comprising: a nutraceutical and a co-crystal former, wherein the nutraceutical is a liquid or a solid at room temperature and the co-crystal former is a solid at room temperature, and wherein the nutraceutical and co-crystal former are hydrogen bonded to each other. It has surprisingly been found that when a nutraceutical and a selected co-crystal former are allowed to form co-crystals, the resulting co-crystals often give rise to improved properties of the nutraceutical, as compared to the nutraceutical in a free form (including free acids, free bases, and zwitterions, hydrates, solvates, etc.), or an acid or base salt thereof particularly with respect to: solubility, dissolution, bioavailability, stability, Cmax, Tmax, processability (including compressibility), longer lasting therapeutic plasma concentration, hygroscopicity, crystallization of amorphous compounds, decrease in form diversity (including polymorphism and crystal habit), change in morphology or crystal habit, etc. For example, a co-crystal form of a nutraceutical is particularly advantageous where the original nutraceutical is practically insoluble or of low solublility in water. Additionally, the co-crystal properties conferred upon the nutraceutical are also useful because the bioavailability of the nutraceutical can be improved and the plasma concentration and/or serum concentration of the nutraceutical can be improved. This is particularly advantageous for orally-administrable formulations. Moreover, the dose response of the nutraceutical can be improved, for example by increasing the maximum attainable response and/or increasing the potency of the nutraceutical by increasing the biological activity per dosing equivalent. In one embodiment, co-crystal forms comprising nutraceuticals and the co-crystal former L-ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) are prepared and isolated. Particularly, it has been discovered that the hydrogen bonding capabilities of L-ascorbic acid can be used for the crystal engineering of co-crystals with compounds that are zwitterionic and/or have one or more carboxyl (or carboxylate) groups. Nutraceuticals In one embodiment, nutraceuticals comprised by the co-crystals of the present invention are zwitterions and/or contain at least one carboxylate (carboxyl) group and include, but are not limited to, vitamins, amino acids and derivative thereof, alkaloids, peptides, flavonoids, steroidals, terpenoids, pharmaceuticals, and hormones or prohormones. The nutraceutical may be provided as a salt or an anion of a salt. In one embodiment, for example, the nutraceutical is nicotinic acid or sarcosine. Flavonoids are a long and well-known class of natural product that is attracting increasing attention as nutraceuticals and pharmaceuticals. Flavonoids are based upon a group of compounds called chalcones and typically contain a 3-ring structure called flavone. The metabolic pathway in plants affords many derivatives including flavonols, flavan-3-ols, tannins and other polyphenolics. Flavonoids are synthesized and widely distributed in plants and fulfill many functions including pigmentation in flowers, and protection from attack by microbes and insects. The widespread distribution of flavonoids means that they are ingested in significant quantities by animals. Furthermore, their variety, their relatively low toxicity compared to, for example, alkaloids, and their biological activity (they can be anti-allergic, anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial, anti-cancer and they can improve cognitive functions) means that consumers, food manufacturers and pharmaceutical companies have become interested in flavonoids for their medicinal properties. Indeed, the beneficial effects of fruit, vegetables, and tea or even red wine have been attributed to flavonoid compounds. Although many flavonoids are abundant and commercially available they can be hard to purify and crystallize and their solubility can be low. In one preferred embodiment, therefore, the present invention is directed to nutraceutical co-crystals comprising a flavonoid as the nutraceutical. In this embodiment, for example, the nutraceutical co-crystal may comprise a flavonoid selected from the group consisting of resveratrol, epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), quercetin, ferulic acid, ellagic acid, hesperitin, and protocatechuic acid. By way of further example, the nutraceutical may be a flavonoid selected from the group consisting of EGCG, ferulic acid, ellagic acid, hesperitin, and protocatechuic acid.

In another embodiment, the nutraceutical co-crystal comprises L-ascorbic acid and nicotinic acid. In another embodiment, the nutraceutical co-crystal is a hemihydrate of a co-crystal comprising ferulic acid and baclofen. In another embodiment, the nutraceutical co-crystal is a hemihydrate of a co-crystal comprising gallic acid and caffeine. In another embodiment, the nutraceutical co-crystal is a co-crystal comprising gallic acid and caffeine. In another embodiment, the nutraceutical co-crystal is a trihydrate of a co-crystal comprising gallic acid and nicotinic acid. In another embodiment, the nutraceutical co-crystal is a hydrate of a co-crystal comprising gallic acid and theobromine. In another embodiment, the present invention provides a co-crystal of L-ascorbic acid and nicotinamide. In another embodiment, the nutraceutical co-crystal is a co-crystal of L-ascorbic acid and iso-nicotinamide. In another embodiment, the nutraceutical co-crystal is an ethanol solvate of a co-crystal of L-ascorbic acid and nictoinamide. In another embodiment, the nutraceutical co-crystal is a hydrate of a co-crystal comprising EGCG and iso-nicotinamide. In another embodiment, the nutraceutical co-crystal is a hydrate of a co-crystal comprising ellagic acid and theophylline. In another embodiment, the nutraceutical co-crystal is a co-crystal comprising citric acid and iso-nicotinamide. In another embodiment, the nutraceutical co-crystal is a co-crystal of protocatechuic acid and ε-caprolactam. In another embodiment, the nutraceutical co-crystal is a co-crystal of protocatechuic acid and iso-nicotinamide. Although it is generally preferred that the nutraceutical co-crystal comprise a single nutraceutical and a single co-crystal former, the nutraceutical co-crystals may comprise more than one nutraceutical and/or more than one co-crystal former. For example, two, three, four, five, or more co-crystal formers can be incorporated in a co-crystal with a single nutraceutical. Alternatively, two or more nutraceuticals can be incorporated in a co-crystal with a single co-crystal former. Alternatively, two or more co-crystal formers can be incorporated into a co-crystal with two or more nutraceuticals. In each such instance, however, the nutraceutical(s) and the co-crystal former(s) are bound together via hydrogen bonds. Some of the nutraceuticals and co-crystal formers of the present invention have one or more chiral centers and may exist in a variety of stereoisomeric configurations. As a consequence of these chiral centers, several nutraceuticals and co-crystal formers of the present invention occur as racemates, mixtures of enantiomers and as individual enantiomers, as well as diastereomers and mixtures of diastereomers. All such racemates, enantiomers, and diastereomers are within the scope of the present invention including, for example, cis- and trans-isomers, R- and S-enantiomers, and (D)- and (L)-isomers. Co-crystals of the present invention can include isomeric forms of either the nutraceutical or the co-crystal former or both. Isomeric forms of nutraceuticals and co-crystal formers include, but are not limited to, stereoisomers such as enantiomers and diastereomers. In one embodiment, a co-crystal can comprise a racemic nutraceutical and/or co-crystal former. In another embodiment, a co-crystal can comprise an enantiomerically pure nutraceutical and/or co-crystal former. In another embodiment, a co-crystal can comprise a nutraceutical or a co-crystal former with an enantiomeric excess of about 50 percent, 55 percent, 60 percent, 65 percent, 70 percent, 75 percent, 80 percent, 85 percent, 90 percent, 95 percent, 96 percent, 97 percent, 98 percent, 99 percent, greater than 99 percent, or any intermediate value. Several non-limiting examples of stereoisomeric co-crystal formers include tartaric acid and malic acid. Co-crystals, solvates, and polymorphs comprising enantiomerically pure components (e.g., nutraceutical or co-crystal former) can give rise to chemical and/or physical properties which are modulated with respect to those of the corresponding co-crystal comprising a racemic component. A co-crystal comprising an enantiomerically pure component can give rise to a modulation of, for example, activity, bioavailability, or solubility, with respect to the corresponding co-crystal comprising a racemic component. In one embodiment, a composition of the present invention comprises a nutraceutical co-crystal in combination with one or more additional components selected from the EAFUS list, the GRAS list, a pharmaceutically active ingredient, and/or a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient. Thus, for example, the composition may comprise an enantiomerically pure nutraceutical and/or co-crystal former wherein the bioavailability is modulated with respect to the racemic co-crystal. In another embodiment, the composition comprises an enantiomerically pure nutraceutical and/or co-crystal former wherein the activity is modulated with respect to the racemic co-crystal. In another embodiment, the composition comprises an enantiomerically pure nutraceutical and/or co-crystal former wherein the solubility is modulated with respect to the racemic co-crystal. In another embodiment, a composition can be formulated to contain the nutraceutical in co-crystal form as micronized or nano-sized particles. More specifically, another embodiment couples the processing of the nutraceutical, e.g., resveratrol, quercetin, EGCG ferulic acid, ellagic acid, hesperitin, or protocatechuic acid to a co-crystal form with the process of making a controlled particle size for manipulation into a pharmaceutical dosage form. This embodiment combines two processing steps into a single step via techniques such as, but not limited to, grinding, alloying, or sintering (i.e., heating a powder mix). The coupling of these processes overcomes a serious limitation of having to isolate and store the bulk nutraceutical that is required for a formulation, which in some cases can be difficult to isolate (e.g., amorphous, chemically or physically unstable). In addition, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical, foodstuff, and nutraceutical compositions comprising the nutraceutical co-crystals, as described above, as an active ingredient. Such compositions can be used for prevention or therapy of various diseases. For example, such compositions containing EGCG may be based on its antioxidant effects. It is useful for treatment or prevention of diseases including, but not limited to: a neurodegenerative disease or condition such as Alzheimer's disease; an upper respiratory disease, such as one caused by an infection; a dementia, such as AIDS-dementia; an oncological disorder, such as cancer; inflammatory or auto-immune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis or diabetic neuropathies; or a disease or condition caused by an infection by virus or bacteria. The active agent prepared according to the present invention may thus be formulated into any suitable composition form for administration to a human or non-human animal patient. The composition may consist of the active agent alone or may include the active agent and any suitable additional component, such as one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, diluents, adjuvants, excipients, or vehicles, such as preserving agents, fillers, disintegrating agents, wetting agents, emulsifying agents, suspending agents, sweetening agents, flavoring agents, perfuming agents, antibacterial agents, antifungal agents, lubricating agents and dispensing agents, depending on the nature of the mode of administration and dosage forms. Each carrier must be acceptable in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not injurious to the patient. Excipients employed in the compositions of the present invention can be solids, semi-solids, liquids or combinations thereof. Preferably, the excipients are solids. Compositions of the invention containing excipients can be prepared by any known technique that comprises, for example, admixing an excipient with the nutraceutical co-crystal. A pharmaceutical, foodstuff or nutraceutical composition of the invention contains a desired amount of the nutraceutical co-crystal and, optionally, an active pharmaceutical ingredient (“API”) per dose unit and, if intended for oral administration, can be in the form, for example, of a tablet, a caplet, a pill, a hard or soft capsule, a lozenge, a cachet, a dispensable powder, granules, a suspension, an elixir, a dispersion, or any other form reasonably adapted for such administration. If intended for parenteral administration, it can be in the form, for example, of a suspension or transdermal patch. If intended for rectal administration, it can be in the form, for example, of a suppository. Presently preferred are oral dosage forms that are discrete dose units each containing a predetermined amount of the nutraceutical co-crystal, such as tablets or capsules.

Such carriers or diluents, if present, constitute in total about 5% to about 99%, preferably about 10% to about 85%, and more preferably about 20% to about 80%, of the total weight of the composition. The carrier, carriers, diluent, or diluents selected preferably exhibit suitable flow properties and, where tablets are desired, compressibility. Compositions of the invention optionally comprise one or more pharmaceutically acceptable disintegrants as excipients, particularly for tablet formulations. Suitable disintegrants include, but are not limited to, either individually or in combination, starches, including sodium starch glycolate (e.g., Explotab™ of PenWest) and pregelatinized corn starches (e.g., National™ 1551 of National Starch and Chemical Company, National™ 1550, and Colorcon™ 1500), clays (e.g., Veegum™ HV of R.T. Vanderbilt), celluloses such as purified cellulose, microcrystalline cellulose, methylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose and sodium carboxymethylcellulose, croscarmellose sodium (e.g., Ac-Di-Sol™ of FMC), alginates, crospovidone, and gums such as agar, guar, locust bean, karaya, pectin and tragacanth gums. Disintegrants may be added at any suitable step during the preparation of the composition, particularly prior to granulation or during a lubrication step prior to compression. Such disintegrants, if present, constitute in total about 0.2% to about 30%, preferably about 0.2% to about 10%, and more preferably about 0.2% to about 5%, of the total weight of the composition. Compositions of the invention optionally comprise one or more pharmaceutically acceptable binding agents or adhesives as excipients, particularly for tablet formulations. Such binding agents and adhesives preferably impart sufficient cohesion to the powder being tableted to allow for normal processing operations such as sizing, lubrication, compression and packaging, but still allow the tablet to disintegrate and the composition to be absorbed upon ingestion. Such binding agents may also prevent or inhibit crystallization or recrystallization of a co-crystal of the present invention once the salt has been dissolved in a solution. Suitable binding agents and adhesives include, but are not limited to, either individually or in combination, acacia; tragacanth; sucrose; gelatin; glucose; starches such as, but not limited to, pregelatinized starches (e.g., National™ 1511 and National™ 1500); celluloses such as, but not limited to, methylcellulose and carmellose sodium (e.g., Tylose™); alginic acid and salts of alginic acid; magnesium aluminum silicate; PEG; guar gum; polysaccharide acids; bentonites; povidone, for example povidone K-15, K-30 and K-29/32; polymethacrylates; HPMC; hydroxypropylcellulose (e.g., Klucel™ of Aqualon); and ethylcellulose (e.g., Ethocel™ of the Dow Chemical Company). Such binding agents and/or adhesives, if present, constitute in total about 0.5% to about 25%, preferably about 0.75% to about 15%, and more preferably about 1% to about 10%, of the total weight of the pharmaceutical composition. Many of the binding agents are polymers comprising amide, ester, ether, alcohol or ketone groups and, as such, are preferably included in pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention. Polyvinylpyrrolidones such as povidone K-30 are especially preferred. Polymeric binding agents can have varying molecular weight, degrees of crosslinking, and grades of polymer. Polymeric binding agents can also be copolymers, such as block co-polymers that contain mixtures of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide units. Variation in these units' ratios in a given polymer affects properties and performance. Examples of block co-polymers with varying compositions of block units are Poloxamer 188 and Poloxamer 237 (BASF Corporation). Compositions of the invention optionally comprise one or more pharmaceutically acceptable wetting agents as excipients. Such wetting agents are preferably selected to maintain the crystal in close association with water, a condition that is believed to improve bioavailability of the composition. Such wetting agents can also be useful in solubilizing or increasing the solubility of crystals. Non-limiting examples of surfactants that can be used as wetting agents in compositions of the invention include quaternary ammonium compounds, for example benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride and cetylpyridinium chloride, dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate, polyoxyethylene alkylphenyl ethers, for example nonoxynol 9, nonoxynol 10, and degrees Ctoxynol 9, poloxamers (polyoxyethylene and polyoxypropylene block copolymers), polyoxyethylene fatty acid glycerides and oils, for example polyoxyethylene (8) caprylic/capric mono- and diglycerides (e.g., Labrasol™ of Gattefosse), polyoxyethylene (35) castor oil and polyoxyethylene (40) hydrogenated castor oil; polyoxyethylene alkyl ethers, for example polyoxyethylene (20) cetostearyl ether, polyoxyethylene fatty acid esters, for example polyoxyethylene (40) stearate, polyoxyethylene sorbitan esters, for example polysorbate 20 and polysorbate 80 (e.g., Tween™ 80 of ICI), propylene glycol fatty acid esters, for example propylene glycol laurate (e.g., Lauroglycol™ of Gattefosse), sodium lauryl sulfate, fatty acids and salts thereof, for example oleic acid, sodium oleate and triethanolamine oleate, glyceryl fatty acid esters, for example glyceryl monostearate, sorbitan esters, for example sorbitan monolaurate, sorbitan monooleate, sorbitan monopalmitate and sorbitan monostearate, tyloxapol, and mixtures thereof. Such wetting agents, if present, constitute in total about 0.25% to about 15%, preferably about 0.4% to about 10%, and more preferably about 0.5% to about 5%, of the total weight of the pharmaceutical composition. Compositions of the invention optionally comprise one or more pharmaceutically acceptable lubricants (including anti-adherents and/or glidants) as excipients. Suitable lubricants include, but are not limited to, either individually or in combination, glyceryl behapate (e.g., Compritol™ 888 of Gattefosse); stearic acid and salts thereof, including magnesium, calcium and sodium stearates; hydrogenated vegetable oils (e.g., Sterotex™ of Abitec); colloidal silica; talc; waxes; boric acid; sodium benzoate; sodium acetate; sodium fumarate; sodium chloride; DL-leucine; PEG (e.g., Carbowax™ 4000 and Carbowax™ 6000 of the Dow Chemical Company); sodium oleate; sodium lauryl sulfate; and magnesium lauryl sulfate.

The appropriate pharmaceutical or edible grade of ingredients will be used, according to the desired composition form. Pharmaceutical compositions according to the present invention include formulations suitable for oral, rectal, intranasal, topical (including transdermal, buccal and sublingual), vaginal, parental (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous and intradermal) and pulmonary administration. The formulations can conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and can be prepared by any methods well known in the art of pharmacy. Such methods include the step of bringing into association the active ingredient with the carrier which constitutes one or more accessory ingredients. In general, the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active ingredient with a suitable carrier, such as liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then if necessary shaping the product. Formulations of the subject invention suitable for oral administration can be presented as discrete units such as capsules, cachets or tablets, each containing a predetermined amount of the active ingredient; or as an oil-in-water liquid emulsion, water-in-oil liquid emulsion, or as a supplement within an aqueous solution, for example, a tea. The active ingredient can also be presented as bolus, electuary, or paste. Formulations suitable for topical administration in the mouth include lozenges comprising the active ingredient in a flavored basis, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth; pastilles comprising the active ingredient in an inert basis such as gelatin and glycerin, or sucrose and acacia; mouthwashes comprising the active ingredient in a suitable liquid carrier; and chocolate comprising the active ingredients. Formulations suitable for topical administration according to the subject invention can be formulated as an ointment, cream, suspension, lotion, powder, solution, paste, gel, spray, aerosol or oil. Alternatively, a formulation can comprise a patch or a dressing such as a bandage or adhesive plaster impregnated with active ingredients, and optionally one or more excipients or diluents. Topical formulations preferably comprise compounds that facilitate absorption of the active ingredients through the skin and into the bloodstream. Formulations suitable for intranasal administration, wherein the carrier is a solid, include a coarse powder having a particle size, for example, in the range of about 20 to about 500 microns, which is administered in the manner in which snuff is taken, i.e., by rapid inhalation through the nasal passage from a container of the powder held close up to the nose. Suitable formulations wherein the carrier is a liquid for administration by nebulizer, include aqueous or oily solutions of the agent. Formulations preferably comprise compounds that facilitate absorption of the active ingredients through the skin and into the bloodstream. Formulations suitable for parenteral administration include aqueous and non-aqueous isotonic sterile injection solutions which can contain antioxidants, buffers, bacteriostats and solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient; and aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions which can include suspending agents and thickening agents, and liposomes or other microparticulate systems which are designed to target the compound to blood components or one or more organs. The formulations can be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose or multi-dose sealed containers, such as for example, ampoules and vials, and can be stored in a freeze-dried (lyophilized) condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example, water for injections, immediately prior to use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions can be prepared from sterile powders, granules and tablets of the kind previously described. It should be understood that in addition to the ingredients particularly mentioned above, the formulations useful in the present invention can include other agents conventional in the art regarding the type of formulation in question. For example, formulations suitable for oral administration can include such further agents as sweeteners, thickeners, and flavoring agents. It also is intended that the agents, compositions, and methods of this invention be combined with other suitable compositions and therapies. Various delivery systems are known in the art and can be used to administer a therapeutic agent or composition of the invention, e.g., encapsulation in liposomes, microparticles, microcapsules, receptor-mediated endocytosis and the like. Methods of administration include, but are not limited to, parenteral, intra-arterial, intramuscular, intravenous, intranasal, and oral routes. The pharmaceutical compositions can be provided in the form of tablets, lozenges, granules, capsules, pills, ampoule, suppositories or aerosol form. The pharmaceutical compositions can also be provided in the form of suspensions, solutions, and emulsions of the active ingredient in aqueous or non-aqueous diluents, syrups, granulates or powders. In one embodiment, the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention can be administered locally to the area in need of treatment; such local administration can be achieved, for example, by local infusion during surgery, by injection, or by means of a catheter. In another embodiment, a compound or composition of the invention is administered in a manner so as to achieve peak concentrations of the active compound at sites of the disease. Peak concentrations at disease sites can be achieved, for example, by intravenously injecting of the agent, optionally in saline, or orally administering, for example, a tablet, capsule or syrup containing the active ingredient. Pharmaceutical formulations of the invention can be administered simultaneously or sequentially with other drugs or biologically active agents. Examples include, but are not limited to, antioxidants, free radical scavenging agents, peptides, growth factors, antibiotics, bacteriostatic agents, immunosuppressives, anticoagulants, buffering agents, anti-inflammatory agents, anti-pyretics, time-release binders, anestetics, steroids and corticosteroids. Preferred unit dosage formulations are those containing a daily dose or unit, daily subdose, or an appropriate fraction thereof, of an agent. Therapeutic amounts can be empirically determined and will vary with the pathology being treated, the subject being treated, and the efficacy and toxicity of the agent. Similarly, suitable dosage formulations and methods of administering the agents can be readily determined by those of ordinary skill in the art. Nutraceutical Co-Crystal Preparation In general, the nutraceutical co-crystal is formed by intimate contact of the nutraceutical and the co-crystal former. This may involve grinding or milling the two solids together or melting one or both components and allowing them to recrystallize. The use of a granulating liquid may improve or may impede co-crystal formation. Non-limiting examples of tools useful for the formation of co-crystals may include, for example, an extruder or a mortar and pestle. Further, contacting the nutraceutical with the co-crystal former may also involve either solubilizing the nutraceutical and adding the co-crystal former, or solubilizing the co-crystal former and adding the nutraceutical. Crystallization conditions are applied to the nutraceutical and co-crystal former. This may entail altering a property of the solution, such as pH or temperature and may require concentration of the solute, usually by removal of the solvent, typically by drying the solution. Solvent removal results in the concentration of both nutraceutical and co-crystal former increasing over time so as to facilitate crystallization. For example, evaporation, cooling, co-sublimation, or the addition of an antisolvent may be used to crystallize co-crystals. In another embodiment, a slurry comprising a nutraceutical and a co-crystal former is used to form co-crystals. Once the solid phase comprising any crystals is formed, this may be tested as described herein. In one embodiment, the use of an excess (more than 1 molar equivalent for a 1:1 co-crystal) of a co-crystal former has been shown to drive the formation of stoichiometric co-crystals. For example, co-crystals with stoichiometries of 1:1, 2:1, or 1:2 can be produced by adding co-crystal former in an amount that is 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 20, 25, 50, 75, 100 times or more than the stoichiometric amount for a given co-crystal. Such an excessive use of a co-crystal former to form a co-crystal can be employed in solution or when grinding a nutraceutical and a co-crystal former to drive co-crystal formation. In another alternative embodiment, an ionic liquid may be employed as a medium to form the co-crystal, and to crystallize other forms in addition to co-crystals (e.g., salts, solvates, free acid, free base, zwitterions, etc.). This medium is useful, for example, where the above methods do not work or are difficult or impossible to control. Several non-limiting examples of ionic liquids useful in co-crystal formation are: 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium lactate, 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium lactate, and 1-butylpyridinium hexafluorophosphate. In another embodiment, the nucleation and crystallization behavior of the nutraceutical, the co-crystal former (e.g. L-ascorbic acid), or both, may be affected by the solvent. One factor that may affect nucleation and crystallization includes the ability of the solvent to accept or donate hydrogen bonds. Another factor involved in selecting a solvent is the temperature at which dissolution occurs. High temperature dissolution can cause nutraceutical and/or co-crystal former degredation, can release toxic fumes, and is energy intensive. It is generally preferred for dissolution to occur at a temperature less than about 200° C., 150° C., 100° C., 50° C., 40° C., or even 30° C. Other factors to consider when selecting a solvent is the ability of the nutraceutical and/or co-crystal former to nucleate in that solvent, nutraceutical stability in the solvent, the co-crystal growth rate in the solvent, and the quality of co-crystals that grow in the solvent. Thus, in one embodiment, a number of solvents may be tested in a co-crystal screening procedure in order to determine solvents that promote the preferred crystallization behavior, purity, and yield of the co-crystals. In general, any solvent into which the nutraceutical and co-crystal former (e.g. L-ascorbic acid) are soluble and stable are suitable for use in the present invention. Typical solvents and cosolvents include water, alcohols, and mixtures thereof. Preferred alcohols have between about 1 and about 10 carbon atoms, may be cyclic or aliphatic, may be saturated or unsaturated, and may be branched or straight-chained. Typical alcohols suitable for use in the present invention include methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, n-butanol, sec-butanol, tert-butanol, n-pentanol, 2-pentanol, 1-hepten-3-ol and 1-octen-3-ol. Examples of other solvents include methylene chloride, acetonitrile, acetone, cyclohexane, toluene, iso-octane, and mixtures thereof optionally in combination with water and/or alcohol. In one embodiment, a single solvent system is used for nutraceutical and L-ascorbic acid dissolution. Such a system facilitates solvent recovery and reuse because a recovered solvent purification step is typically not required. In a second embodiment a miscible mixed solvent system could be used with the solvents selected to maximize crystallization rate, yield and purity. For example, L-ascorbic acid could be dissolved in water into which it is freely soluble. Nicotinic acid could be dissolved in ethanol into which it is freely soluble, but L-ascorbic acid has limited solubility in ethanol. L-ascorbic acid solubility in the combined ethanol-water solvent should be reduced thereby promoting crystallization. In another embodiment, an immiscible mixed solvent system could be used. For example, a nutraceutical solvent could be selected that is immiscible with the L-ascorbic acid solvent. Upon combining, the boundaries of the two solutions would come in contact with one another at the interface region between the two solutions. Mixing would occur in the interface region but not outside of it. Thus, on the nutraceutical side of the interface, there would be substantially no L-ascorbic acid beyond the interface and, likewise, on the L-ascorbic acid side of the interface, there would be substantially no nutraceutical beyond the interface. Where the solutions mix in the interface region, there would be a gradient of concentrations ranging from pure nutraceutical in solution to pure L-ascorbic acid in solution with a range of concentrations in between. It is believed that high purity co-crystals could be prepared with this embodiment. The prepared co-crystals can be isolated by solid-liquid separation means known in the art including filtration and centrifugation. In one embodiment, the crystals can be optionally purified by washing with a solvent. The collected co-crystals can further be dried by means known in the art such as fluidized bed dryers and tray dryers. The crystals can be further subjected to size reduction operations (such as milling) and/or size classification operations (such as sieving) to yield co-crystals having a desired particle size profile and distribution. It is further believed that the dissolution rate of a co-crystal as measured in simulated gastric fluid (SGF) or simulated intestinal fluid (SIF) (see Dressman J B, et al., Pharm Res. (1998) January; 15(1): 11-22) would be increased by as much as 10, 50, or even 100%, or by an even greater amount, e.g. 2, 5, 10, 50, or even 200 fold greater as compared to the free form or salt form in the same solution. It is still further believed that the co-crystals of the present invention would be stable such that when evaluated using standard stability or accelerated stability protocols at temperatures of up to about 40° C. for up to 2 years or at about 60° C. for 4 weeks, nutraceutical purity is 99.8%, 99.9% or greater. The nutraceutical co-crystals obtained as a result of one or more of the above processes or techniques may be readily incorporated into a pharmaceutical composition by conventional means. Pharmaceutical compositions in general are discussed in further detail elsewhere in this application and may further comprise a pharmaceutically-acceptable diluent, excipient or carrier. Assaying the solid phase for the presence of co-crystals of the nutraceutical and the co-crystal former may be carried out by conventional methods known in the art. For example, it is convenient and routine to use powder X-ray diffraction techniques to assess the presence of co-crystals. This may be effected by comparing the diffractograms of the nutraceutical, the crystal former and putative co-crystals in order to establish whether or not true co-crystals have been formed. Other techniques, used in an analogous fashion, include differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Fourier Transform infrared spectrophotometry analysis (FT-IR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and Raman spectroscopy. Single crystal X-ray diffraction is especially useful in identifying co-crystal structures. DEFINITIONS The term “co-crystal” as used herein means a crystalline material comprised of two or more unique solids at room temperature (22° C.), each containing distinctive physical characteristics, such as structure, melting point and heats of fusion, with the exception that, if specifically stated, the nutraceutical may be a liquid at room temperature. The co-crystals of the present invention comprise a co-crystal former hydrogen-bonded (H-bonded) to a nutraceutical. The co-crystal former may be H-bonded directly to the nutraceutical or may be H-bonded to an additional molecule which is bound to the nutraceutical. The additional molecule may be H-bonded to the nutraceutical or bound ionically or covalently to the nutraceutical. The additional molecule could also be a different nutraceutical. Solvates or hydrates of nutraceutical compounds that do not further comprise a co-crystal former are not co-crystals according to the present invention. The co-crystals may however, include one or more solvate or water molecules in the crystalline lattice. That is, a solvate or hydrate of a co-crystal, or a co-crystal further comprising a solvent or water or compound that is a liquid at room temperature, is a co-crystal according to the present invention, but crystalline material comprised of only one solid and one or more liquids (at room temperature) are not co-crystals for purposes of the present invention, with the previously noted exception of specifically stated liquid nutraceuticals. The co-crystals may also be a co-crystal between a co-crystal former and a salt of a nutraceutical, but the nutraceutical and the co-crystal former of the present invention are constructed or bonded together through hydrogen bonds. Other modes of molecular recognition may also be present including, pi-stacking, guest-host complexation and van der Waals interactions. Of the interactions listed above, hydrogen bonding is the dominant interaction in the formation of the co-crystal, (and a required interaction according to the present invention) whereby a non-covalent bond is formed between a hydrogen bond donor of one of the moieties and a hydrogen bond acceptor of the other. Hydrogen bonding can result in several different intermolecular configurations. For example, hydrogen bonds can result in the formation of dimers, linear chains, or cyclic structures. These configurations can further include extended (two-dimensional) hydrogen bond networks and isolated triads. The term “nutraceutical co-crystal” as used herein means a multiple component crystalline solid in which all components are solid under ambient conditions (i.e. 22° Celsius, 1 atmosphere of pressure) when in their pure form. These components co-exist as a stoichiometric ratio of a molecule or ion (the co-crystal former) and a nutraceutical, and the co-crystal former and the nutraceutical are bonded together through supramolecular synthons such as a hydrogen bond. For purposes of the present invention, the chemical and physical properties of a nutraceutical in the form of a co-crystal may be compared to a reference compound that is the same nutraceutical in a different form. The reference compound may be specified as a free form, or more specifically, a free acid, free base, or zwitterion; a salt, or more specifically for example, an inorganic base addition salt such as sodium, potassium, lithium, calcium, magnesium, ammonium, aluminum salts or organic base addition salts, or an inorganic acid addition salts such as HBr, HCl, sulfuric, nitric, or phosphoric acid addition salts or an organic acid addition salt such as acetic, propionic, pyruvic, malanic, succinic, malic, maleic acid, fumaric, tartaric, citric, benzoic, methanesulfonic, ethanesulforic, stearic or lactic acid addition salt; an anhydrate or hydrate of a free form or salt, or more specifically, for example, a hemihydrate, monohydrate, dihydrate, trihydrate, quadrahydrate, pentahydrate, sesquihydrate; or a solvate of a free form or salt. For example, the reference compound for a nutraceutical in salt form co-crystallized with a co-crystal former can be the nutraceutical salt form. Similarly, the reference compound for a free acid nutraceutical co-crystallized with a co-crystal former can be the free acid nutraceutical. The reference compound may also be specified as crystalline or amorphous. The reference compound may also be specified as the most stable polymorph known of the specified form of the reference compound. As used herein and unless otherwise noted, the term “racemic co-crystal” refers to a co-crystal which is comprised of an equimolar mixture of two enantiomers of the nutraceutical, the co-crystal former, or both. For example, a co-crystal comprising a stereoisomeric nutraceutical and a non-stereoisomeric co-crystal former is a “racemic co-crystal” when there is present an equimolar mixture of the nutraceutical enantiomers. Similarly, a co-crystal comprising a non-stereoisomeric nutraceutical and a stereoisomeric co-crystal former is a “racemic co-crystal” when there is present an equimolar mixture of the co-crystal former enantiomers. In addition, a co-crystal comprising a stereoisomeric nutraceutical and a stereoisomeric co-crystal former is a “racemic co-crystal” when there is present an equimolar mixture of the nutraceutical enantiomers and of the co-crystal former enantiomers. As used herein and unless otherwise noted, the term “enantiomerically pure co-crystal” refers to a co-crystal which is comprised of a stereoisomeric nutraceutical or a stereoisomeric co-crystal former or both where the enantiomeric excess of the stereoisomeric species is greater than or equal to about 90 percent. EXAMPLES A. General Methods for the Preparation of Co-Crystals a) High Throughput Crystallization High throughput crystallization may be used, comprising a sequence of automated, integrated high throughput robotic stations capable of rapid generation, identification and characterization of polymorphs, salts, and co-crystals of nutraceuticals and nutraceutical candidates. Worksheet generation and combinatorial mixture design is carried out using proprietary design software. Typically, a nutraceutical or a nutraceutical candidate is dispensed from an organic solvent into tubes and dried under a stream of nitrogen. Salts and/or co-crystal formers may also be dispensed and dried in the same fashion. Water and organic solvents may be combinatorially dispensed into the tubes using a multi-channel dispenser. Each tube in a 96-tube array is then sealed within 15 seconds of combinatorial dispensing to avoid solvent evaporation. The mixtures are then rendered supersaturated by heating to 70° C. for 2 hours followed by a 1° C./minute cooling ramp to 5° C. Optical checks are then conducted to detect crystals and/or solid material. Once a solid has been identified in a tube, it is isolated through aspiration and drying. Raman spectra are then obtained on the solids and cluster classification of the spectral patterns is performed using proprietary software (QForm™). b) Crystallization from Solution Co-crystals may be obtained by dissolving the separate components in a solvent and adding one to the other. The co-crystal may then precipitate or crystallize as the solvent mixture is evaporated slowly or if the solution is cooled. The co-crystal may also be obtained by dissolving the two components in the same solvent or a mixture of solvents. The ratio of the co-crystal formers in solution will not necessarily correspond to the ratio of the co-crystal formers in the resulting co-crystal. c) Crystallization from the Melt A co-crystal may be obtained by melting the two components together and allowing recrystallization to occur. In some cases, an anti-solvent may be added to facilitate crystallization. d) Thermal Microscopy A co-crystal may be obtained by melting the higher melting component on a glass slide and allowing it to recrystallize. The second component is then melted and is also allowed to recrystallize. The co-crystal may form as a separated phase/band in between the eutectic bands of the two original components. e) Mixing and/or Grinding A co-crystal may be obtained by mixing or grinding two components together in the solid state with our without the presence of a liquid or solvent. B. Analytical Methods A. X-ray Powder Diffraction A powder X-ray diffraction pattern for the samples was obtained using a Bruker AXS D8 diffractometer. For the PXRD analysis, the acquisition parameters were as follows: source was Cu with a K line at 1.5406.ANG.; x-y stage was manual; collimator size was 0.3 or 0.8 mm; capillary tube (Charles Supper Company, Natick, Mass., U.S.A.) was 0.3 mm ID; reflection mode was used; the power to the X-ray tube was 46 kV; the current to the X-ray tube was 40 mA; the omega-axis was oscillating in a range of 0-5 degrees at a speed of 1 degree/minute; the phi-axis was spinning at an angle of 360 degrees at a speed of 2 degrees/second; 0.3 or 0.8 mm collimator; the collection time was 60 minutes; the temperature was room temperature; and the heater was not used. The sample was presented to the X-ray source on a rotating disc. In addition, the analysis parameters were as follows: the integration 2-theta range was 2-40 or 60 degrees; the integration chi range was 0-360 degrees; the number of chi segments was 1; the step size used was 0.02; the integration utility was cylint; normalization was used; dark counts were 8; omega offset was 180; and chi and phi offsets were 0. The relative intensity of peaks in a diffractogram is not necessarily a limitation of the PXRD pattern because peak intensity can vary from sample to sample, e.g., due to crystalline impurities. Further, the angles of each peak can vary by about +/−0.1 degrees, preferably +/−0.05. The entire pattern or most of the pattern peaks may also shift by about +/−0.1 degree due to differences in calibration, settings, and other variations from instrument to instrument and from operator to operator. For PXRD data herein, each composition of the present invention may be characterized by any one, any two, any three, any four, any five, any six, any seven, or any eight or more of the 2θ angle peaks. B. DSC Analysis DSC analysis of the samples was performed using a 2920 Differential Scanning calorimeter (TA Instruments, New Castle, Del., U.S.A.), which uses Advantage for QW-Series, version 1.0.0.78, Thermal Advantage Release 2.0 (82001 TA Instruments-Water LLC). In addition, the analysis software used was Universal Analysis 2000 for Windows 95/95/2000/NT, version 3.1 E; Build 3.1.0.40 (82001 TA Instruments-Water LLC). For the DSC analysis, the purge gas used was dry nitrogen, the reference material was an empty aluminum pan that was crimped, and the sample purge was 50 mL/minute. SC analysis of the sample was performed by placing <5 mg of sample in an aluminum pan with a crimped pan closure. The starting temperature was typically 20° C. with a heating rate of 10° C./minute, and the ending temperature was 300° C. Unless otherwise indicated, all reported transitions are as stated +/−10 degrees C. For DSC data herein, each composition of the present invention may be characterized by any one, any two, or any three DSC transitions. The different combinations of the PXRD peaks and the DSC transitions can also be used to characterize the compositions. C. TGA Analysis TGA analysis of samples was performed using a High Resolution Thermogravimetric Analyzer 2950 (TA Instruments, New Castle, Del., U.S.A.), which uses Advantage for QW-Series, version 1.0.0.78, Thermal Advantage Release 2.0 (82001 TA Instruments-Water LLC). In addition, the analysis software used was Universal Analysis 2000 for Windows 95/95/2000/NT, version 3.1E; Build 3.1.0.40 (82001 TA Instruments-Water LLC). For all of the TGA experiments, the purge gas used was dry nitrogen, the balance purge was 40 mL/minute N2, and the sample purge was 60 mL/minute N2. TGA of the sample was performed by placing 5 mg to 20 mg of sample in a platinum pan. The starting temperature was typically 20° C. with a heating rate of 10° C./minute, and the ending temperature was 400° C. D. Single Crystal X-Ray Diffraction Single crystal x-ray data were collected on a Bruker AXS SMART-APEX CCD diffractometer (M. J. Zawarotko, Department of Chemistry, University of South Florida). Lattice parameters were determined from least squares analysis. Reflection data was integrated using the program SAINT. The structure was solved by direct methods and refined by full matrix least squares using the program SHELXTL (Sheldrick, G. M. SHELXTL, Release 5.03; Siemans Analytical X-ray Instruments Inc.: Madison, Wis.). Procedure for Determining Dissolution Profiles Solubility profiles for co-crystals were determined by UV-vis spectroscopy (Perkin Elmer-Lambda 25 UV-vis spectrometer, 400 nm). Dissolution profiles of co-crystals of the present invention may be compared to the corresponding nutraceutical reference forms to find the increase in the solubility of the co-crystal form when compared to the reference form of the nutraceutical. CONCLUSION The co-crystals of the present invention can be characterized by any one, any two, any three, any four, any five, any six, any seven, any eight, any nine, any ten, or any single integer number of PXRD 2-theta angle peaks listed herein or disclosed in a figure, or by single crystal x-ray diffraction data.

The resulting solution was cooled in a refrigerator and allowed to stand for two days. Slow evaporation yielded golden yellow crystals of 1:1 quercetin:iso-nicotinamide co-crystal (hereinafter “KP10”).

There are two types of nicotinic acid zwitterions that hydrogen bond with each other in a head-to-tail fashion and thereby form chains that are sandwiched between the chains of hesperetin molecules. Both the enantiomers of hesperetin are present in the crystals, however the crystal is polar as the head-to-tail chains of nicotinic acid zwitterions are parallel throughout the crystal structure. The three chains are linked by lateral hydrogen bonds and therefore form a network that could be described as a supramolecular tape. The molecular structure of hesperetin as it exists in KP22 reveals that one of the three phenolic —OH moieties engages in an intramolecular hydrogen bond with the carbonyl moiety. The intermolecular interactions in KP22 are shown in FIG. 23 of the accompanying drawings.
