NOVEL 3-INDOL SUBSTITUED DERIVATIVES, PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS AND METHODS FOR USE FIELD OF INVENTION The present invention relates to novel 3-(indol-3-yl)-pyridine derivatives, including pharmaceutically acceptable enantiomers, salts and solvates thereof. Compounds of the invention are inhibitors of TDO2 (tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase) and are useful as therapeutic compounds, particularly in the treatment and/or prevention of cancers. BACKGROUND OF INVENTION Two decades after the importance of tryptophan catabolism for maintaining the immune privilege of the placenta was discovered (Munn, D.H. et al., Science, 1998, 281 , 1 191 - 1 193), increasing evidence is extending its biological relevance beyond immune tolerance to non-self. According to the generally accepted concept, tryptophan, an essential amino acid, is catabolized in the local microenvironment of tumors, immune- privileged sites, or sites of inflammation (Mellor AL and Munn DH., Nat Rev Immunol, 2008, 8, 74-80). In these tissues, cancer cells, immune cells, or specialized epithelial cells (e.g., syncytiotrophoblasts in the placenta) create an immunosuppressive environment in tumors that shuts down antitumor immune responses in tumors and in tumor-draining lymph nodes by inducing T-cell anergy and apoptosis through depletion of tryptophan and accumulation of immunosuppressive tryptophan catabolites (Munn DH et al., J Exp Med., 1999, 189, 1363-1372; Fallarino F et al., Cell Death Differ., 2002, 9, 1069-1077). It has recently been discovered that a key enzyme in tryptophan catabolism, tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO2), which is considered responsible for regulating systemic tryptophan levels in the liver, is constitutively expressed in a wide variety of cancers, such as for example in bladder carcinoma, hepatocarcinoma, melanoma, mesothelioma, neuroblastoma, sarcoma, breast carcinoma, leukemia, renal cell carcinoma, colorectal carcinoma, head and neck carcinoma, lung carcinoma, brain tumor, glioblastoma, astrocytoma, myeloma, and pancreatic carcinoma (Pilotte L et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A, 2012, 109(7), 2497-502). TDO2 expression in tumor cells prevents tumor surveillance by the immune system and thus prevents tumor rejection by locally degrading tryptophan (Opitz CA et al., Nature, 201 1 , 478(7368), 197-203). The first evidence for this was provided through inhibition of TDO2 by a small molecule which inhibited tumor growth in a P815 mastocytoma tumor model with a prophylactic vaccination approach (Pilotte L et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A, 2012, 109(7), 2497- 502). P815mTDO2 expressing tumors were rejected less in comparison to P815 tumors transfected with an empty vector, clearly demonstrating a growth benefit for TDO2 expressing tumors. Inhibition with a TDO2 inhibitor strongly decreased tumor growth in P815mTDO2 implanted tumors. Anti-tumor activity with the TDO2 inhibitor was equally observed in the P815 control implanted tumors negative for TDO2, thus providing evidence for an effect of TDO2 expressed in the immune system of the animal. These experiments for the first time provided clear evidence for a role of TDO2 in regulating tumor growth through expression in the cancer cell as well as immune compartment. In line with its expression profile in liver, TDO2 was found predominantly in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (Pilotte L et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A, 2012, 109(7), 2497-502). Inhibition of tryptophan catabolism and thus restoration of tryptophan concentration and decreased production of downstream metabolites could prove beneficial in the context of liver disease progressing to the stage of liver carcinoma. More particularly: (i) several reports have shown evidence that increased availability of tryptophan through supplementation is beneficial for example, cirrhotic livers, allowing the direct use of tryptophan for protein synthesis (Ohta et al., Amino Acids, 1996, 10(4), 369-78); (ii) there is a correlation between increased downstream serum tryptophan metabolites, such as quinolinic acid, and hepatic dysfunction in patients with liver cirrhosis (Lahdou et al., Hum Immunol, 2013, 74(1 ), 60-6) and (iii) increased secretion of another tryptophan metabolite, indole-3-lactic acid, has been associated with alcohol- induced liver disease in mice (Manna et al., J Proteome Res, 201 1 , 10(9), 4120-33). In the context of liver carcinoma itself, very high RNA expression is a good indication for therapeutic evaluation of TDO2 inhibitors (Pilotte L et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A, 2012, 109(7), 2497-502). The above thus provides a clear rationale for TDO2 activity modulation in the control of liver tumor development. In addition to expression in liver, TDO2 is expressed in neurons, microglia and astrocytes and the potential benefit of TDO2 inhibition in the context of glioma was shown in another animal model. Platten and collaborators demonstrated that the tryptophan catabolite kynurenine produced by TDO expressed in the tumor cells suppresses antitumour immune responses and promotes tumor-cell survival and motility through the AHR in an autocrine/paracrine fashion (Opitz CA et al., Nature, 201 1 , 478(7368), 197-203). The TDO-AHR pathway is active in human brain tumors and is associated with malignant progression and poor survival. Further evidence came from the accumulation of a downstream metabolite, quinolinic acid which accumulates in human gliomas and was associated with a malignant phenotype (Sahm et al., Cancer Res, 2013, 73(1 1 ), 3225-34). Here tryptophan catabolism was shown to occur in microglia cells as well. The above data thus provides evidence for TDO2 targeting in glioma with brain-penetrant small molecules. Other tumor types in which TDO2 imRNA was found are breast carcinoma, bladder, renal cell, pancreatic, colorectal, head & neck carcinoma and lung carcinoma as well as melanoma thus broadening the scope of TDO2 targeting beyond HCC and glioma (Pilotte L et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A, 2012, 109(7), 2497-502). The enhanced Tryptophan degradation observed in patients with gynecological cancers (ovarian carcinoma, cervical cancer, endometrial cancer) provides additional rationale for TDO2 targeting in those cancers (Sperner-Unterweger B et al, Immunology, 201 1 , 216 (3); 296-301 ). The tryptophan catabolism in some cancers might be also increased by the expression of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO1 ) by tumor cells (Uyttenhove, C. et al., Nat. Med., 2003, 9, 1269-1274). Because tryptophan catabolism is induced by inflammatory mediators, notably IFN- gamma, it is thought to represent an endogenous mechanism that restricts excessive immune responses, thereby preventing immunopathology. However in the context of cancer, there is strong evidence that suppression of antitumor immune responses in precancerous lesions and established cancers by tryptophan catabolism promotes tumor growth, which would make such catabolism an attractive target for therapeutic intervention (Dolusic E and Frederick R., Expert Opin Ther Pat., 2013, 23(10), 1367-81 ). Hence, a considerable effort is being made to identify selective and efficient inhibitors of tryptophan catabolism to enhance the efficacy of conventional chemotherapy, immune checkpoints (Holmgaard RB et al., J Exp Med., 2013, 210(7), 1389-402) or therapeutic vaccines. In the context of neurological brain disorders, TDO2 expression has been demonstrated in neurons, brain vasculature and additionally in the case of schizophrenia in astroglial cells (Miller C et al., 2004, Neurobiology Dis, 15(3):618-29). The kynurenine pathway is now considered as a therapeutic target in cognitive diseases like bipolar disorder or Tourette syndrome and neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer, motor neuron disease like Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Multiple sclerosis, Huntington or Parkinson's disease (Stone TW, 2013, Br J of Pharmacol, 169(6): 121 1 -27; Wu et al, 2013, Plos One, 8(4):e59749; Fuvesi et al, 2012, J Neural Transm, 1 19(2):225-34; Widner et al, 2002, J Neural Transm, 109(2):181 -9; Comings et al, 1996, Pharmacogenetics, 6(4):307-18; Forrest 2010, J Neurochem, 1 12(1 ):1 12-22). Cognitive changes related to Tryptophan catabolism have also been shown in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV), called HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) (Davies et al, 2010, Int J of Tryptophan Res, 3:121 -40). In addition, T cell hyporesponsiveness has been recently associated with the Tryptophan catabolic pathway in HIV-infected patients with possibly extension to other chronic infectious diseases like e.g. Hepatitis C. Some TDO2 inhibitors were proposed in WO2010/008427 and by Dolusic, E. et al. (Dolusic et al., J. Med. Chem., 201 1 , 54, 5320-5334), however either their affinity for the target is limited, or their pharmacokinetic properties are not suitable for development as a drug for human use. Therefore, there is a need for new TDO2 inhibitors with improved efficacy for cancer treatment and/or prevention.

In Table 1 , the term "Cpd" means compound. The compounds of Table 1 were named using ChemBioDraw® Ultra version 12.0 (PerkinElmer). The compounds of Formula I and subformulae thereof may contain an asymmetric center and thus may exist as different stereoisomeric forms. Accordingly, the present invention includes all possible stereoisomers and includes not only racemic compounds but the individual enantiomers and their non-racemic mixtures as well. When a compound is desired as a single enantiomer, such may be obtained by stereospecific synthesis, by resolution of the final product or any convenient intermediate, or by chiral chromatographic methods as each are known in the art. Resolution of the final product, an intermediate, or a starting material may be performed by any suitable method known in the art. The compounds of the invention may be in the form of "pharmaceutically acceptable salts". Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of Formula I include the acid addition and base salts thereof. Suitable acid addition salts are formed from acids which form non-toxic salts.

Hemisalts of acids and bases may also be formed, for example, hemisulphate and hemicalcium salts. Preferred, pharmaceutically acceptable salts include hydrochloride/chloride, hydrobromide/bromide, bisulphate/sulphate, nitrate, citrate, and acetate. When the compounds of the invention contain an acidic group as well as a basic group the compounds of the invention may also form internal salts, and such compounds are within the scope of the invention. When the compounds of the invention contain a hydrogen-donating heteroatom (e.g. NH), the invention also covers salts and/or isomers formed by transfer of said hydrogen atom to a basic group or atom within the molecule. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of compounds of Formula I may be prepared by one or more of these methods: (i) by reacting the compound of Formula I with the desired acid; (ii) by reacting the compound of Formula I with the desired base; (iii) by removing an acid- or base-labile protecting group from a suitable precursor of the compound of Formula I or by ring-opening a suitable cyclic precursor, for example, a lactone or lactam, using the desired acid; or (iv) by converting one salt of the compound of Formula I to another by reaction with an appropriate acid or by means of a suitable ion exchange column. All these reactions are typically carried out in solution. The salt, may precipitate from solution and be collected by filtration or may be recovered by evaporation of the solvent. The degree of ionization in the salt may vary from completely ionized to almost non- ionized. The compounds of the present invention may be administered in the form of pharmaceutically acceptable salts, which are as defined above. These salts may be prepared by standard procedures, e.g. by reacting a free acid with a suitable organic or inorganic base.

According to one embodiment, the deprotection step (b4) may be performed in conditions described above for deprotection (b1 ). In general, the synthesis pathways for any individual compound of Formula (I) will depend on the specific substituents of each molecule and upon the ready availability of intermediates necessary; again such factors being appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art. According to a further general process, compounds of Formula I can be converted to alternative compounds of Formula I, employing suitable interconversion techniques well known by a person skilled in the art. Compounds of the Formula I and related formulae can furthermore be obtained by liberating compounds of the Formula I from one of their functional derivatives by treatment with a solvolysing or hydrogenolysing agent. Preferred starting materials for the solvolysis or hydrogenolysis are those which conform to the Formula I and related formulae, but contain corresponding protected amino and/or hydroxyl groups instead of one or more free amino and/or hydroxyl groups, preferably those which carry an amino-protecting group instead of an H atom bonded to an N atom, in particular those which carry an R*-N group, in which R* denotes an amino- protecting group, instead of an HN group, and/or those which carry a hydroxyl-protecting group instead of the H atom of a hydroxyl group, for example those which conform to the Formula I, but carry a -COOR** group, in which R** denotes a hydroxyl-protecting group, instead of a -COOH group. It is also possible for a plurality of - identical or different - protected amino and/or hydroxyl groups to be present in the molecule of the starting material. If the protecting groups present are different from one another, they can in many cases be cleaved off selectively. The term "amino-protecting group" is known in general terms and relates to groups which are suitable for protecting (blocking) an amino group against chemical reactions, but which are easy to remove after the desired chemical reaction has been carried out elsewhere in the molecule. Typical of such groups are, in particular, unsubstituted or substituted acyl, aryl, aralkoxymethyl or aralkyl groups. Since the amino-protecting groups are removed after the desired reaction (or reaction sequence), their type and size are furthermore not crucial; however, preference is given to those having 1 -20, in particular 1 -8, carbon atoms. The term "acyl group" is to be understood in the broadest sense in connection with the present process. It includes acyl groups derived from aliphatic, araliphatic, aromatic or heterocyclic carboxylic acids or sulfonic acids, and, in particular, alkoxy-icarbonyl, aryloxycarbonyl and especially aralkoxycarbonyl groups. Examples of such acyl groups are alkanoyl, such as acetyl, propionyl and butyryl; aralkanoyl, such as phenylacetyl; aroyl, such as benzoyl and tolyl; aryloxyalkanoyl, such as POA; alkoxycarbonyl, such as methoxy-icarbonyl, ethoxycarbonyl, 2,2,2- trichloroethoxycarbonyl, BOC (terf-butoxycarbonyl) and 2-iodoethoxycarbonyl; aralkoxycarbonyl, such as CBZ ("carbobenzoxy"), 4-methoxybenzyloxycarbonyl and FMOC; and arylsulfonyl, such as Mtr. Preferred amino-protecting groups are BOC and Mtr, further-iimore CBZ, Fmoc, benzyl and acetyl. The term "hydroxyl-protecting group" is likewise known in general terms and relates to groups which are suitable for protecting a hydroxyl group against chemical reactions, but are easy to remove after the desired chemical reaction has been carried out elsewhere in the molecule. Typical of such groups are the above-mentioned unsubstituted or substituted aryl, aralkyl or acyl groups, furthermore also alkyl groups. The nature and size of the hydroxyl-protecting groups are not crucial since they are removed again after the desired chemical reaction or reaction sequence; preference is given to groups having 1 -20, in particular 1 -10, carbon atoms. Examples of hydroxyl- protecting groups are, inter alia, benzyl, 4-methoxybenzyl, p-nitrobenzoyl, p- toluenesulfonyl, terf-butyl and acetyl, where benzyl and terf-butyl are particularly preferred. The compounds of the Formula I and related formulae are liberated from their functional derivatives - depending on the protecting group used - for example strong inorganic acids, such as hydrochloric acid, perchloric acid or sulfuric acid, strong organic carboxylic acids, such as trichloroacetic acid, TFA or sulfonic acids, such as benzene- or p-toluenesulfonic acid. The presence of an additional inert solvent is possible, but is not always necessary. Suitable inert solvents are preferably organic, for example carboxylic acids, such as acetic acid, ethers, such as tetrahydrofuran or dioxane, amides, such as DMF, halogenated hydrocarbons, such as dichloromethane, furthermore also alcohols, such as methanol, ethanol or isopropanol, and water. Mixtures of the above-mentioned solvents are furthermore suitable. TFA is preferably used in excess without addition of a further solvent, and perchloric acid is preferably used in the form of a mixture of acetic acid and 70% perchloric acid in the ratio 9:1 . The reaction temperatures for the cleavage are advantageously between about 0 and about 50°C, preferably between 15 and 30°C (room temperature). The BOC, OtBu and Mtr groups can, for example, preferably be cleaved off using TFA in dichloromethane or using approximately 3 to 5N HCI in dioxane at 15-30°C, and the FMOC group can be cleaved off using an approximately 5 to 50% solution of dimethylamine, diethylamine or piperidine in DMF at 15-30°C. Protecting groups which can be removed hydrogenolytically (for example CBZ, benzyl or the liberation of the amidino group from the oxadiazole derivative thereof) can be cleaved off, for example, by treatment with hydrogen in the presence of a catalyst (for example a noble-metal catalyst, such as palladium, advantageously on a support, such as carbon). Suitable solvents here are those indicated above, in particular, for example, alcohols, such as methanol or ethanol, or amides, such as DMF. The hydrogenolysis is generally carried out at temperatures between about 0 and 100°C and pressures between about 1 and 200 bar, preferably at 20-30°C and 1 -10 bar. Hydrogenolysis of the CBZ group succeeds well, for example, on 5 to 10% Pd/C in methanol or using ammonium formate (instead of hydrogen) on Pd/C in methanol/DMF at 20-30°C. Examples of suitable inert solvents are hydrocarbons, such as hexane, petroleum ether, benzene, toluene or xylene; chlorinated hydrocarbons, such as trichloroethylene, 1 ,2- dichloroethane, tetrachloromethane, trifluoromethylbenzene, chloroform or dichloromethane; alcohols, such as methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, n-propanol, n- butanol or terf-butanol; ethers, such as diethyl ether, diisopropyl ether, tetrahydrofuran (THF) or dioxane; glycol ethers, such as ethylene glycol monomethyl or monoethyl ether or ethylene glycol dimethyl ether (diglyme); ketones, such as acetone or butanone; amides, such as acetamide, dimethylacetamide, A/-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) or dimethyhformamide (DMF); nitriles, such as acetonitrile; sulfoxides, such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO); carbon disulfide; carboxylic acids, such as formic acid or acetic acid; nitro compounds, such as nitromethane or nitrobenzene; esters, such as ethyl acetate, or mixtures of the said solvents. Esters can be hydrolysed, for example, using HCI, H2SO4, or using LiOH, NaOH or KOH in water, water/THF, water/THF/ethanol or water/dioxane, at temperatures between 0 and 100°C. Free amino groups can furthermore be acylated in a conventional manner using an acyl chloride or anhydride or alkylated using an unsubstituted or substituted alkyl halide, advantageously in an inert solvent, such as dichloromethane or THF and/or in the presence of a base, such as triethylamine or pyridine, at temperatures between -60°C and +30°C.
