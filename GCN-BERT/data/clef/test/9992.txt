TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a novel organopolysiloxane compound having an ethynyl group, a method for preparing a linear organopolysiloxane compound having ethynyl groups at both terminals of a molecular chain, a method for preparing an organosiloxane polymer having an alkoxysilyl-ethylene group at its terminal, a room temperature curable composition and a molded product obtained by curing the same. BACKGROUND ART An organopolysiloxane compound having an unsaturated hydrocarbon onto the terminal silicon is useful as a base polymer of an addition curable silicone composition. The addition curable silicone composition forms a silicone gel or a silicone rubber each excellent in electric characteristics, cold resistance, etc., after curing, so that it has been utilized as a sealing agent, a filler or a coating agent of electric and electronic parts or a semiconductor device, and a photosemiconductor insulation-coating protective material, etc. As a silicon compound having ethynyl groups at the both terminals, a low molecular weight monomer such as a low molecular weight silicon compound having ethynyl groups at the terminals, 1,3-diethynyl-1,1,3,3-tetramethyldisiloxane (CAS Registry Number: 4180-02-3), 1,5-diethynyl-1,1,3,3,5,5-hexamethyltrisiloxane (CAS Registry Number: 39490-70-5), 1,7-diethynyl-1,1,3,3,5,5,7,7-octamethyltetrasiloxane (CAS Registry Number: 40392-68-5), 1,9-diethynyl-1,1,3,3,5,5,7,7,9,9-decamethylpentasiloxane (CAS Registry Number: 40392-69-6) and 1,11-diethynyl-1,1,3,3,5,5,7,7,9,9,11,11-dodecamethylhexasiloxane (CAS Registry Number: 40392-70-9), etc., have been described, and there is disclosed a method for preparing an organopolysiloxane compound having an acetylene portion at the main chain which comprises subjecting these silicon compounds and a divalent halogenated arylene compound to polycondensation reaction in the presence of a transition metal catalyst (Patent Literatures 1 and 2). It has also been reported about a synthetic example of an acetylene-containing high molecular weight silicon compound (Non-Patent Literature 1). However, the organopolysiloxane compound which is either a linear or a branched, and having at least one unit of the following formula (a) as a partial structure is limited to an organopolysiloxane compound where N=0 and M=0 to 20 in the following formula (a), and there is no reported example about an organopolysiloxane compound having a higher polymerization degree and having an ethynyl group at its polymer terminal. Also, an organopolysiloxane compound having terminal ethynyl groups represented by the following formula (b) is limited only to an organopolysiloxane compound wherein N=0 and M=0 to 20 in the following formula (b), and it has not been reported about a method for preparing an organopolysiloxane compound having ethynyl groups at the polymer terminals with a higher polymerization degree. For example, when an organopolysiloxane compound having an ethynyl group at its terminal is to be synthesized by an alkali equilibration, an alkali metal forms a metal acetylide such as C-M (M is an alkali metal) by substituting with H of the C-H bond at the acetylene portion, so that it is difficult to synthesize an organopolysiloxane compound having an ethynyl group at its terminal having a higher polymerization degree. Also, a room temperature curable composition which cures to an elastomer state at a room temperature by contacting with a moisture in the air has conventionally been known various types of materials, and above all, a material of the type which cures by discharging an alcohol is preferably used for sealing, adhesion or coating of an electric and electronic devices, etc., due to its characteristics that there is no unpleasant smell and it does not corrode metals. Representative examples of such a type may be mentioned those disclosed in Patent Literature 3, and a composition comprising an organopolysiloxane the terminal of which has been blocked by a hydroxyl group, an alkoxysilane and an organotitanium compound has been disclosed therein. Also, in Patent Literature 4, there is disclosed a composition comprising an organopolysiloxane the terminal of which has been blocked by an alkoxysilyl, an alkoxysilane and an alkoxytitanium. In Patent Literature 5, there is disclosed a composition comprising a linear organopolysiloxane having an alkoxysilyl-ethane group, an alkoxysilane and an alkoxytitanium. Further, in Patent Literature 6, there is disclosed a composition comprising an organopolysiloxane the terminal of which has been blocked by a hydroxyl group or an organopolysiloxane the terminal of which has been blocked by an alkoxy group, and an alkoxy-α-silyl ester compound. These compositions gave good characteristics in storage stability and durability (water resistance and humidity resistance), but they were insufficient with regard to rapid curability. An organosiloxane polymer having a reactive alkoxysilyl group at its terminal has conventionally been known. The terminal group of the organosiloxane polymer has previously been blocked by an alkoxysilyl group so that curability of the polymer difficultly change (lower) with a lapse of time, and a composition excellent in storage stability can be obtained. Also, workability (viscosity and thixotropic property) thereof can be optionally adjustable, and it reacts with a moisture in the air to form an elastomer by crosslinking, whereby excellent characteristics (hardness, tensile strength and elongation at break) can be also obtained. However, a dealcoholation type room temperature curable organopolysiloxane composition comprising an organosiloxane polymer having such a reactive alkoxysilyl group at its terminal as a main agent (a base polymer) was insufficient in curability as compared to the other conventionally known curing types such as a deoximation type, a deacetylation type, a deacetone type, etc., since reactivity with a moisture in the air is low. As a measure thereof, researches focused on a functional group (a bonding group) adjacent to the reactive alkoxy group have been promoted, and it has been reported that an α-alkoxysilylmethyl terminal group has particularly high reactivity with a moisture in the air (Patent Literature 7). However, curability thereof is yet insufficient, and there are defects that the adjacent functional group (bonding group) exerts bad effect to durability, and a restoring force of the cured product is low.

For example, it may be carried out at 10°C to 180°C without using a solvent, and polymerization may be carried out by the equilibration reaction using a suitable solvent. The acidic catalyst may be mentioned sulfuric acid or trifluoromethanesulfonic acid, etc. In general, when sulfuric acid or trifluoromethanesulfonic acid is used as the catalyst, the equilibration reaction is carried out at a relatively low temperature, for example, 10°C to 150°C, preferably 20°C to 100°C, and the acidic catalyst is used in an amount of 0.1 to 10% by weight, preferably 1 to 5% by weight based on the organosiloxane compound of the whole starting materials. An amount of the organodisiloxane compound having ethynyl groups at its terminals to be used as the starting material may vary depending on the polymerization degree (i.e., "m" in the formula (2)) of the linear organopolysiloxane compound having ethynyl groups at the both terminals of the molecular chain to be obtained, and the amount can be obtained by the content of the ethynyl groups bonded to the silicon of the organodisiloxane compound having ethynyl groups at its terminals. After completion of the reaction, neutralization and filtration of the catalyst are carried out, then, the filtrate is applied to purification such as distillation, etc., to obtain an objective organopolysiloxane compound having ethynyl groups at both terminals. According to the method for preparing a linear organopolysiloxane compound having ethynyl groups at the both terminals of the molecular chain of the present invention, as a typical example thereof, a linear organopolysiloxane compound having ethynyl groups at the both terminals of the molecular chain having such a molecular composition can be obtained by selecting the amounts of the cyclic organosiloxane compound and the organodisiloxane compound having ethynyl groups at its terminals that the molecular composition of the formed linear organopolysiloxane compound having ethynyl groups at the both terminals of the molecular chain comprises 75.0 to 99.5 mole% of an R2SiO2/2 unit which is a repeating unit of the diorganosiloxane unit which constitutes the main chain, and 0.5 to 15.0 mole% of a HC≡C-[CH2]n-(R)2SiO1/2 unit (wherein R is a methyl group, an ethyl group, a phenyl group, etc.) which is a silyl group (a siloxy unit) constituting the terminal of the molecular chain, and the total being 100 mole% with these siloxane units. Also, the viscosity of the linear organopolysiloxane compound having ethynyl groups at the both terminals of the molecular chain is not particularly limited, and a viscosity at 25°C is preferably 10 to 100,000 mP·s, more preferably 1,000 to 10,000 mP·s.

In addition, the linear organopolysiloxane compound having ethynyl groups at the both terminals of the molecular chain is useful in the points that it can be expected to use as a nonvolatile controller, etc. Also, the preparation method is useful in the point that the linear organopolysiloxane compound having ethynyl groups at the both terminals of the molecular chain having an objective polymerization degree can be prepared easily.

Also, the composition is particularly excellent in storage stability and curability, and even after storage of, for example, 6 months, it rapidly cures when it is exposed to the air and provides a cured product having excellent physical properties as mentioned above. In particular, it does not discharge any poisonous or corrosive gas at the time of curing, so that no patina is formed at the surface onto which the composition has been applied. In particular, the composition never causes contact fault of electric and electronic parts, so that it is useful not only as an insulating material or an adhesive for electric and electronic parts, but also widely used as a sealing agent, a coating agent, a covering agent, a releasing agent to the various kinds of substrates and as a fiber treatment agent. Further, various molded products can be obtained by curing and molding the composition, and the molded products are materials excellent in heat resistance, weather resistance, etc. EXAMPLES In the following, the present invention is explained more specifically by referring to Examples and Comparative Examples, but the present invention is not limited by the following Examples.
