2.00 g of 4-amino-1-benzylpiperidine was added to a 100-mL round-bottomed flask, and then 20.0 mL of deionized water and 20.0 mL of saturated sodium hydrogen carbonate (NaHCO3) were added thereto. After 2.41 g of di-tert-butyl dicarbamate (Boc2O) was added thereto, the reaction mixture was vigorously stirred for about 4 hours and then concentrated under reduced pressure. The aqueous phase was extracted with 20.0 mL of ethyl acetate (EtOAc) obtain an organic phase. The organic phase was washed with 15.0 mL of deionized water and 5.00 mL of saturated brine. The organic phase was filtered with sodium sulfate (Na2SO4). The resulting filtrate was distilled under reduced pressure. As a result, 3.04 g of tert-butyl (1-benzylpiperidine-4-yl)carbamate was obtained with a yield of about 99.7%.
3.04 g of tert-butyl (1-benzylpiperidine-4-yl)carbamate was added to a 100-mL round-bottomed flask, and then 45.0 mL of tetrahydrofuran was added thereto. After 2.50 g of lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH4) was added thereto, the reaction mixture was refluxed for about 4 hour and then cooled at room temperature. 4.50 mL of deionized water was slowly added thereto while cooling. After the reaction mixture was stirred for about 5 minutes, 4.50 mL of a 15% sodium hydroxide (NaOH) aqueous solution was added thereto. The reaction mixture was further stirred for about 5 minutes, and then 13.5 mL of deionized water was added thereto to terminate the reaction. The reaction mixture was filtered through a Celite™ 545 filter agent. The resulting filtrate was distilled under reduced pressure. As a result, 2.22 g of 1-benzyl-N-methylpiperidine-4-amine was obtained with a quantitative yield.
1.00 g of 1-benzyl-N-methylpiperidine-4-amine was added to a 50-mL round-bottomed flask, and then 20.0 mL of deionized water was added thereto. After 790 mg of 6-chloro-7-deazapurine was added thereto, 1.35 g of potassium carbonate (K2CO3) was added into the reaction mixture. The reaction mixture was refluxed for about 24 hours and then cooled at room temperature. The reaction mixture was then extracted three times with 10.0 mL of dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) to collect an organic phase. The collected organic phase was concentrated under reduced pressure, and then the resulting residue was purified by flash column chromatography (MeOH:CH2Cl2=2:98). As a result, 607 mg of N-(1-benzylpiperidine-4-yl)-N-methyl-7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine-4-amine was obtained with a yield of about 38.7%.
350 mg of N-(1-benzylpiperidine-4-yl)-N-methyl-7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine-4-amine was added to a 50-mL round-bottomed flask, and then dissolved with 7.00 mL of methanol and 1.00 mL of dichloromethane (CH2Cl2). After 350 mg of a 10w/w% palladium/carbon (Pd/C) was added thereto, a hydrogen-containing balloon was installed on the reaction flask. The reaction mixture was vigorously stirred for about 24 hours and then filtered through a Celite™ 545 filter agent. The resulting filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting fraction was concentrated under reduced pressure and then further under vacuum. As a result, 220 mg of N-methyl-N-(piperidine-4-yl)-7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine-4-amine was obtained with a yield of about 87.7%.
150 mg of N-methyl-N-(piperidine-4-yl)-7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine-4-amine was added to a 5-mL round-bottomed flask and then dissolved with 1.50 mL of n-butanol. After 0.690 mL of ethyl cyanoacetate was added into the solution, the reaction mixture was treated with 0.0485 mL of 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU) and then heated at about 80°C for about 24 hours. After termination of the reaction, the reaction solution was distilled under reduced pressure to remove the solvent. The resulting residue was purified by flash column chromatography (MeOH:CH2Cl2=2:98). The resulting fraction was concentrated under reduced pressure and then further under vacuum. As a result, 6.20 mg of 3-(4-(methyl(7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine-4-yl)amino)piperidine-1-yl)-3-oxopropanenitrile was obtained with a yield of about 3.20%.
