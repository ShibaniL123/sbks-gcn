[Reaction Scheme 1-3] Synthesis of [Intermediate 1-c]
In a 2-L reactor, Intermediate 1-a (42 g, 185 mmol), Intermediate 1-b (49 g, 185 mmol), tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium (4.3 g, 3.7 mmol), potassium carbonate (76.7 g, 555 mmol), toluene (600 mL), and distilled water (200 mL) were placed and stirred together at 100Â° C. for 12 hours. The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature. Then the organic layer was extracted and concentrated at a reduced pressure. Purification by column chromatography afforded Intermediate 1-c (47 g): yield 69%
