NOVEL 6-ARYLAMINO PYRIDONE CARBOXAMIDE AS ΜΕΚ INHIBITORS FIELD OF THE INVENTION [001] This invention relates to a series of substituted 6-arylamino pyridonc carboxamides which are inhibitors of ΜΕΚ and are useful in the treatment of inflammatory diseases, cancer and other hyperproliferative diseases. This invention also relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising the compound of the invention, use of the compound in the preparation of a medicament, and method of treatment for hyperproliferative diseases in mammals, especially humans by administering the compound thereof. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [002] Protein kinases constitute a large family of structurally related enzymes that effect the transfer of a phosphate group from a nucleoside triphosphate to a Ser, Thr or Tyr residue on a protein acceptor. A vast array of cellular functions, including DNA replication, cell cycle progression, energy metabolism and cell growth and differentiation, are regulated by reversible protein phosphorylation events mediated by protein kinases. Additionally, protein kinase activity has been implicated in a number of diseases, including cancers. Of the >100 dominant oncogenes known to date, many encode receptor and cytoplasmic protein kinases known to be mutated and/or over expressed in human cancers (Blume-Jensen and Hunter, Nature, 411:355-365 (2001)). Accordingly, protein kinase targets have attracted substantial drug discovery efforts in recent years, with several protein kinase inhibitors achieving regulatory approval (reviewed in Fischer, Curr.’s Med. Chem., 11:1563 (2004); Dancey and Sausville, Nature Rev. Drug Disc., 2:296 (2003)). [003] The Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway is a central signal transduction pathway, which transmits signals from multiple cell surface receptors to transcription factors in the nucleus which regulate gene expression. This pathway is frequently referred to as the MAP kinase pathway as ΜΑΡΚ stands for mitogen-activated protein kinase indicating that this pathway can be stimulated by mitogens, cytokines and growth factors (Steelman et al., Leukemia 2004, 18, 189-218). Depending upon the stimulus and cell type, this pathway can transmit signals, which result in the prevention or induction of apoptosis or cell cycle progression. The Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway has been shown to play important roles in cell proliferation and the prevention of apoptosis. Aberrant activation of this pathway is commonly observed in malignantly transformed cells. Amplification of ras proto-oncogenes and activating mutations that lead to the expression of constitutively active Ras proteins are observed in approximately 30% of all human cancers (Stirewalt et al., Blood 2001, 97, 3589-95). Mutated, oncogenic forms of Ras are found in 50% of colon and >90% pancreatic cancers as well as many other types of cancers (Kohl et al., Science 1993, 260, 1834-1837). The effects of Ras on proliferation and tumorigenesis have been documented in immortal cell lines (McCubrey et al., hit J Oncol 1995, 7, 295-310). bRaf mutations have been identified in more than 60% of malignant melanoma (Davies, Η et al., Nature 2002, 417, 949954). Given the high level of mutations that have been detected at Ras, this pathway has always been considered a key target for therapeutic intervention (Chang et al., Leukemia 2003,17, 1263-93). [004] As constitutive or overactivation of MAP kinase cascade plays a pivotal role in cell proliferation and differentiation, inhibition of this pathway is believed is to be beneficial in hyperproliferative diseases. ΜΕΚ is a key player in this pathway as it is downstream of Ras and Raf. Additionally, it is an attractive therapeutic target because the only disclosed substrates of ΜΕΚ phosphorylation are the MAP kinases, ERK1 and ERK2. Inhibition of ΜΕΚ has been shown to have potential therapeutic benefit in several studies. For example, small molecule ΜΕΚ inhibitors have been shown to inhibit human tumor growth in mouse xenografts, (Seebolt-Leopold et. al., Nature-Medicine, 1999 5(7), 810-816; Trachet et al. AACR April 6-10, 2002, Poster # 5426) and inhibit growth of acute myeloid leukemia cells (Milella et. al., J. Clin. Invest., 2001, 108 (6) 851-859). [005] Compounds suitable as ΜΕΚ inhibitors are also disclosed in WO 00/41994; WO 00/42022; WO 00/42029; WO 00/68201; WO 01/68619; WO 02/06213, WO 03/077914, WO 05/023251, WO 05/121142, WO 07/014011, WO 07/044084, WO 07/071951, WO 07/121481, WO 07/123939, WO 08/ 021389, WO 08/078086, WO 08/120004, WO 08/124085, WO 09/018233, WO 09/018238, WO 09/013462, WO 09/021887, WO 09/080523, WO 09/082687, WO 09/085983, WO 09/093008, WO 09/093009, WO 09/093013, WO 09/129938, WO 09/153554, US 09/0124595, US 09/0246198, US 09/0275606, WO 10/003022, WO 10/003025, WO 10/051933 and WO 10/051935.

Likewise, the compounds presented herein may possess one or more double bonds and each may exist in the Ε (trans) or Ζ (cis) configuration, or combinations thereof. Presentation of one particular stereoisomer, regioisomer, diastereomer, enantiomer or epimer should be understood to include all possible stereoisomers, regioisomers, diastereomers, enantiomers or epimers and mixtures thereof. Thus, the compounds presented herein include all separate configurational stereoisomeric, regioisomeric, diastereomeric, enantiomeric, and epimeric forms as well as the corresponding mixtures thereof. Techniques for inverting or leaving unchanged a particular stereocenter, and those for resolving mixtures of stereoisomers are well known in the art and it is well within the ability of one of skill in the art to choose an appropriate method for a particular situation. See, for example, Fumiss et al. (eds.), VOGEL'S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 5.sup.TH ED., Longman Scientific and Technical Ltd., Essex, 1991, 809-816; and Heller, Acc. Chern. Res. 1990, 23, 128. [078] The terms "moiety", "chemical moiety", "group" and "chemical group", as used herein refer to a specific segment or functional group of a molecule. Chemical moieties are often recognized chemical entities embedded in or appended to a molecule. [079] The term "bond" or "single bond" refers to a chemical bond between two atoms, or two moieties when the atoms joined by the bond are considered to be part of larger substructure. [080] The term "catalytic group" refers to a chemical functional group that assists catalysis by acting to lower the activation barrier to reaction. [081] The term "optional" or "optionally" means that the subsequently described event or circumstance may or may not occur, and that the description includes instances where said event or circumstance occurs and instances in which it does not. For example, "optionally substituted alkyl" means either "alkyl" or "substituted alkyl" as defined below. Further, an optionally substituted group may be un-substituted (e.g.,CH2CH3), fully substituted (e.g.,CF2CF3),mono-substituted (e.g.,CH2CH2F) or substituted at a level anywhere in-between fully substituted and monosubstituted (e.g.,CH2CHF2j CF2CH3,CFHCHF2, etc). It will be understood by those skilled in the art with respect to any group containing one or more substituents that such groups are not intended to introduce any substitution or substitution patterns (e.g., substituted alkyl includes optionally substituted cycloalkyl groups, which in turn are defined as including optionally substituted alkyl groups, potentially ad infinitum) that are sterically impractical and/or synthetically non-feasible. Thus, any substituents described should generally be understood as having a maximum molecular weight of about 1,000 daltons, and more typically, up to about 500 daltons (except in those instances where macromolecular substituents are clearly intended, e.g., polypeptides, polysaccharides, polyethylene glycols, DNA, RNA and the like). [082] As used herein, Ci-Cn, includes Ci-C2, C1-C3 ... Ci-Cn. By way of example only, a group designated as "C1-C4" indicates that there are one to four carbon atoms in the moiety, i.e. groups containing 1 carbon atom, 2 carbon atoms, 3 carbon atoms or 4 carbon atoms, as well as the ranges Ci-C2 and C1-C3. Thus, by way of example only, "C1-C4 alkyl" indicates that there are one to four carbon atoms in the alkyl group, i.e., the alkyl group is selected from among methyl, ethyl, propyl, iso-propyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, and t-butyl. Whenever it appears herein, a numerical range such as "1 to 10" refers to each integer in the given range; e.g., "1 to 10 carbon atoms" means that the group may have 1 carbon atom, 2 carbon atoms, 3 carbon atoms, 4 carbon atoms, 5 carbon atoms, 6 carbon atoms, 7 carbon atoms, 8 carbon atoms, 9 carbon atoms, or 10 carbon atoms.

[093] The terms "haloalkyl", "haloalkenyl" and "haloalkynyl" as used herein, alone or in combination, refer to optionally substituted alkyl, alkenyl and alkynyl groups respectively, as defined above, in which one or more hydrogen atoms is replaced by fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine atoms, or combinations thereof. In some embodiments two or more hydrogen atoms may be replaced with halogen atoms that are the same as each another (e.g. difluoromethyl); in other embodiments two or more hydrogen atoms may be replaced with halogen atoms that are not all the same as each other (e.g. 1-chloro-l-fluoro- 1 -iodoethyl).

If the chain is part of a linker and that linker comprises one or more rings as part of the core backbone, for purposes of calculating chain length, the "chain" only includes those carbon atoms that compose the bottom or top of a given ring and not both, and where the top and bottom of the ring(s) are not equivalent in length, the shorter distance shall be used in determining the chain length. If the chain contains heteroatoms as part of the backbone, those atoms are not calculated as part of the carbon chain length. [096] The terms "cycle", "cyclic", "ring" and "membered ring" as used herein, alone or in combination, refer to any covalently closed structure, including alicyclic, heterocyclic, aromatic, heteroaromatic and polycyclic fused or non-fused ring systems as described herein. Rings can be optionally substituted. Rings can form part of a fused ring system. The term "membered" is meant to denote the number of skeletal atoms that constitute the ring. Thus, by way of example only, cyclohexane, pyridine, pyran and pyrimidine are six-membered rings and cyclopentane, pyrrole, tetrahydrofuran and thiophene are five-membered rings.
