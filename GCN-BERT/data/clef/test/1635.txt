STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH The U.S. government has certain rights in this invention, pursuant to TSTAR Grant No. 00093296 awarded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Latin name of the genus and species of the plant claimed: Ruellia simplex. Variety denomination: ‘R10-105-Q54’. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a new and distinct variety of Ruellia, botanically known as Ruellia simplex, and hereinafter referred to by the name ‘R10-105-Q54’. ‘R10-105-Q54’ is an individual obtained from open-pollination of ‘R10-105’ grown in Citra, Fla. (North Central Florida, 29.4° N, 82.2° W, AHS heat zone 8b) in September 2012. ‘R10-105’ is a pink tetraploid hybrid obtained in Gainesville, Fla., which resulted from a cross between ‘RU25-1’×‘Chi Chi’ made in September 2010. ‘RU25-1’ is a pink tetraploid plant, obtained as a vegetative propagule of ‘RU3-25’. ‘RU3-25’ is a diploid-tetraploid chimeric plant obtained by treating the apical meristem of a seedling of pink R. simplex ‘Chi Chi’ with three applications, every 12 hours, of a 50 μM oryzalin solution in December 2008. ‘R10-105-Q54’ was first asexually reproduced in Gainesville, Fla. and has been reproduced asexually for 1 year through vegetative cuttings. The reproduced plants have been shown to retain their distinctive characteristics through successive asexual propagations. ‘R10-105-Q54’ has not been made publicly available more than one year prior to the filing date of this application. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The following are the most outstanding and distinguishing characteristics of ‘R10-105-Q54’ when grown under normal horticultural practices in North Central and Southeastern Florida, USA: 1. Excellent performance in both full sun and partial shade environments.2. Compact growth habit.3. Good flowering throughout the flowering season.4. Medium-sized red-purple flowers.5. No fruit production from selfing.6. Low fruit production when grown in close proximity of other Ruellia plants that are fertile, or when hand-pollinated with fertile Ruellia pollen. Fruits abort before maturity (within 14 days after pollination). Seeds are abnormal and non-viable (no germination).

The detailed description was taken on Oct. 17, 2013, which was 27 weeks after vegetative propagation from greenhouse-grown stock plants. Measurements are the means from three individual clones propagated on Apr. 10, 2013 and potted in 11.4-L pots on May 30, 2013. FAFARD® 2P mix (Agawam, Mass.; 60% Canadian peat moss, 40% perlite) was used with fertigation at 150 ppm nitrogen. Pots were placed on mesh benches in a 25% shade poly house in Gainesville, Fla. (North Central Florida, 29.7° N 82.3° W, AHS heat zone 8b). Color references are to The R.H.S. Colour Chart of The Royal Horticultural Society of London (R.H.S.), 2001 Edition.

Comparison with Parental Lines and Known Variety Compared to the female parent ‘R10-105’, ‘R10-105-Q54’ has less fruit formation when grown in close proximity to other fertile Ruellia. Twenty-one-week old ‘R10-105-Q54’ plants were compared to ‘Chi Chi’ in Citra (North Central) and Fort Pierce (South Eastern), Fla. ‘R10-105-Q54’ had an average height of 50 cm and width of 50 cm, while ‘Chi Chi’ had an average height of 62 cm width of 60 cm. Average internode lengths for ‘R10-105-Q54’ and ‘Chi Chi’ were 6 cm and 9.5 cm, respectively. Average landscape performance rating at Citra, Fort Pierce and Gainesville, Fla. was 4.4 for ‘R10-105-Q54’ and 3.8 for ‘Chi Chi’. Landscape performance was rated with a scale from 1-5, with 1 indicating very poor quality, not acceptable, severe leaf necrosis or chlorosis, poor form; 2 indicating poor quality, not acceptable, large areas of necrosis or chlorosis, poor form; 3 indicating acceptable quality, somewhat desirable form and color; 4 indicating very good quality, very acceptable and desirable color and form; and 5 indicating excellent quality, perfect condition, premium color and form. Average flowering rating at Citra, Fort Pierce and Gainesville, Fla. was 3.1 for ‘R10-105-Q54’ and 4 for ‘Chi Chi’. Flowering was rated on a 1-5 scale, with 1 indicating no flowers or buds; 2 indicating buds but no open flowers; 3 indicating 1-10 open flowers; 4 indicating 11-20 open flowers; and 5 indicating more than 20 open flowers. Corolla diameter was 4.5 to 5.2 cm for ‘R10-105-Q54’ and 4.8 to 5.4 for ‘Chi Chi’. Colors of the upper surface of the corolla and the corolla tube were RHS 66D and RHS 74A for ‘R10-105-Q54’ and RHS 68D and RHS 64C for ‘Chi Chi’. Average fruiting rating at Citra, Fort Pierce and Gainesville, Fla. was 4.8 for ‘R10-105-Q54’ and 3 for ‘Chi Chi’. Fruiting was rated on a 1-5 scale, with 1 indicating more than 50 fruits; 2 indicating 20-50 fruits; 3 indicating 10-19 fruits; 4 indicating 1-9 fruits; and 5 indicating no fruits. Fruits produced by ‘Chi Chi’ during 60 days in the poly house in Gainesville, Fla. were counted (120), the average number of seeds per fruit was determined (18), and the seed germination rate was calculated (82%). It was estimated that ‘Chi Chi’ could produce 1,766 seedlings, while ‘R10-105-Q54’ did not produce any fruits or seeds from selfing. When ‘R10-105-Q54’ was hand-pollinated with pollen from wild, purple-flowered R. simplex, 35% of the crosses resulted in fruit formation, and when pollinated with pink-flowered cultivar ‘Chi Chi’, 50% of the crosses resulted in fruit formation. However, all fruits aborted before maturation (within 14 days after pollination), and the seeds were not viable. 1. A new and distinct variety of Ruellia plant as shown and described herein.
