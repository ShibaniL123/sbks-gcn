2.1 2-Iodo-5-trifluoromethyl-isonicotonitrile
2-Chloro-5-trifluoromethyl-isonicotonitrile (3.30 g, 16.0 mmol) is dissolved in 20 ml dichloromethane and cooled to 0Â° C. Hydriodic acid (57% in water, 1.58 mL, 12.0 mmol) is added and the mixture is stirred for 48 hours. The mixture is washed with half saturated aqueous potassium carbonate and sodium thiosulfate solutions and then washed with concentrated aqueous sodium chloride solution. The organic layer is dried, concentrated under reduced pressure and purified by RP-HPLC.
Yield: 2.82 g (28% of theory)
