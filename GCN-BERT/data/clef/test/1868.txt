Increasing the breaking load of ceramic socket inserts for hip joint prostheses by defined back-side collision of the socket insert and the hip socket The invention relates to a hip socket and a socket insert for a hip joint prosthesis, wherein the socket insert is coupled to the hip socket by means of a clamping cone of a conical clamping connection in the equatorial region of the two components, and beneath the clamping cone a gap is situated between the two components up to the pole, the gap being delimited by the radial contours of the two components. Various materials are used for achieving a biocompatible, low-wear bearing for modern hip joint prostheses. The so-called hard-hard pairings according to the prior art are best suited for long-term reliable care of the patient. In these pairings, the ball head mounted on the hip stem as well as the socket insert mounted in the hip socket are made of a hard material in the technical sense. Ceramic-ceramic and metal-metal pairings are presently in use. Current studies are also investigating the clinical effects of the ceramic-metal pairing. To provide the surgeon with the opportunity to intra-operatively select the optimal slide pairing for the patient, modern hip joint prostheses have a modular design (see Figure 1). The implants are generally composed of a shank 1 which is coupled to a ball head 2, and a hip socket 4 which is coupled to a socket insert 3. The shank and the hip socket are generally made of metal alloys, and are joined to the body by ingrowth into the femur and the pelvic bone, respectively. The shank and the hip socket are supports for the ball head and the socket insert, respectively. The ball head is rotatably supported in the spherical recess of the socket insert with a degree of freedom of one. The coupling between the socket insert and the hip socket is achieved with a direct coupling without the insertion of an adapter material such as plastic, and as a rule, by means of a conical clamping connection. Approaches in this regard are described in ΕΡ 0 649 641, ΕΡ 0 826 347, and DE 196 54 409, for example. The components are usually coupled by a clamping cone situated in the so-called equatorial region of the hip socket. For an illustration of the term "equatorial," see Figure 2, reference numeral 5. There is no contact in the so-called polar region of the components; instead, a significant gap is provided to avoid contact of the components in this region (see ΕΡ 0 649 641, Figure 1, and ΕΡ 0 826 347, Figures 1 through 4). For an illustration of the term "polar," see Figure 2, reference numeral 6. The need for avoiding contact of the components in the back-side region of the socket insert (the geometric area beneath the clamping cone up to the pole) is based on the following: 1. Load on the socket insert causes slight load-dependent sinking of the socket insert into the hip socket. If contact occurs prematurely between the components in the back-side region, this results in relief of load on the clamping cone. As a result, the clamping force of the coupling does not further increase, but, rather, remains at the lowest possible level. If tensile forces are then transmitted to the socket insert due to adhesion between the ball head and the socket insert, the socket insert may be lifted from the hip socket. This malfunction of the coupling may ultimately lead to failure of the prosthetic system in vivo. On the other hand, if there is a sufficient gap between the components, the clamping force increases unhindered with increasing load on the socket insert, thus ensuring adequate clamping of the components. 2. If contact between the components occurs in the back-side region, it must be ensured that the contact takes place not at specific points, but, rather, over the surface area. Point contact results in localized increases in stress which lead to overload and premature failure. However, surface contact cannot be ensured for the indicated geometries. Minor geometric deviations, which are always possible within the scope of allowable tolerances, as well as slight tilting in the hip socket due to asymmetrical loads, etc., result in point contacts, and thus, premature failure. Some studies have shown that a controlled surface contact in the back-side region is not possible with the present geometries. It is assumed that a controlled back-side contact of the components, while avoiding or solving the described problems, results in a reduction in the tensile stresses in the socket insert, which has a positive effect in particular when ceramic socket inserts are used. The breaking load of the socket inserts would thus be significantly increased. When socket inserts made of metal alloy are used, it is expected that the reduction in the stresses results in less deformation. This may result in a reduction in the load-induced shape deviation of the sliding surfaces and a decrease in the wear of the sliding partners. Some studies emphasize the need for the back-side gap between components having this or a similar geometry. The object of the invention is to at least attempt to address one or more of these and other limitations of the art - thereby to provide an improved hip socket and a socket insert for a hip joint prosthesis. According to the present invention there is provided a hip socket prosthesis, comprising a metal hip socket and a ceramic socket insert, wherein the socket insert is anchored to the hip socket by means of a conical clamping connection formed and present in an equatorial region of the socket insert and the hip socket, wherein a gap is present in an unloaded state of the socket insert between the insert-facing inside of the socket and a socket-facing backside of the insert, the gap extending from below the conical clamping connection region to a pole region of the insert and the socket, respectively, and wherein the metal hip socket is thin walled such that (a) the equatorial region of the hip socket may expand and allow the socket insert to slide into the hip socket and decrease the size of the gap when a load is applied to the socket insert, and (b) complementarily contoured portions of the inside of the socket and the backside of the insert may come into surface engagement and the gap is at least partially closed when the load applied is above a certain value whereby load transfer from the socket insert into the hip socket is effected via the conical clamping connection region and the backside of the socket insert. The above described shaping and contouring of the backside of the socket insert and the inside of the hip socket may be described alternatively by noting that as a result of the radial contours of the two components (that is, the socket insert and hip socket) having identical geometric elements (ie shapes) at the same sequential locations (or zones) starting below the conical clamping equatorial region towards the pole regions of the components, and providing tangential transitions between the geometric elements of adjacent zones, a reduction in tensile stresses in the socket insert is achieved. The gap between the inside of the hip socket and the backside of the socket insert decreases when load is applied to the socket insert. This gap is at least partially closed above a certain load, so that contact of the components also 4a occurs beneath the conical clamping connection. The breaking load of the socket insert is thus significantly increased by a controlled back-side contact. Preferably, when the socket insert of the hip joint prosthesis is in an unloaded state, the gap between the socket insert and the hip socket continuously increases from the equatorial region towards the pole region which is located opposite the equatorial region. The hip socket is preferably made of metal and has thin walls, and thus has a particularly flexible design. As a result, when load is applied to the socket insert the hip socket may expand, and the socket insert on the clamping cone may slide into the interior of the hip socket until, above a certain load, contact of the components also occurs beneath the clamping cone. The socket insert is advantageously made of ceramic, and is preferably made of an aluminum oxide ceramic or mixed ceramics based on aluminum oxide or zirconium oxide, or a silicon-nitride ceramic. In one embodiment of the invention, the back side of the socket insert, exactly the same as the internal geometry of the hip socket, has the design of a portion of a ball sphere. In one embodiment, except for on the clamping cone, the radius Rinsert back side (Rer) of the back side of the socket insert is greater than or equal to the radius Rsocket pole (Rpp) of the internal geometry of the hip socket. At the transition between the clamping cone and the ball sphere, the rounding radius (Rinsert rounding) of the back side of the socket insert is preferably equal to the rounding radius (Rsocket rounding) of the internal geometry of the hip socket. One preferred embodiment is characterized in that, at the transition between the clamping cone and the ball sphere, in each case a rounding radius is present, and Rinsert back side (Rer) is approximately the same as RSOcket pole (Rpp), and Rinsert rounding (Rev) is larger than Rsocket rounding (Rpv), the socket insert is made of aluminum oxide-mixed ceramic, and the hip socket is a thin-walled metal socket. The following approach is proposed to avoid the above-described problems and to achieve a so-called controlled back-side contact, or also a "controlled base contact": The back-side geometry of the socket insert and the internal geometry of the hip socket are coordinated with one another in such a way that • on a radial contour, starting from the lower cone end to the pole of the particular component, only tangential or substantially tangential transitions occur between geometric elements • the radial contours of the associated components, starting from the lower cone end to the pole, have only identical geometric elements, wherein the dimensions do not have to be the same • the initial gap between the components, i.e., in the unloaded state, in the region near the cone is less than or equal to the gap in the region of the pole. The invention is explained in greater detail below with reference to three figures. Figure 1 shows a hip joint prosthesis 12 according to the prior art, having a modular design. The hip joint prosthesis 12 is composed of a shank 1 which is coupled to a ball head 2, and a hip socket 4 which is coupled to a socket insert 3. The shank 1 and the hip socket 4 are generally made of metal alloys, and are joined to the body by ingrowth into the femur and the pelvic bone, respectively. The shank and the hip socket are supports for the ball head 2 and the socket insert 3, respectively. The ball head 2 is rotatably supported in the spherical recess of the socket insert 3 with a degree of freedom of one. Figures 2 and 3 illustrate one preferred embodiment of a socket insert and a hip socket according to the invention for a hip joint prosthesis 12 (see Figure 1). The socket insert 3 is anchored in the hip socket 4 by means of a clamping cone 5. The equatorial region is denoted by reference numeral 7, and the pole is denoted by reference numeral 6. In this embodiment, the back-side geometry of the socket insert 3 and the internal geometry of the hip socket 4 are designed as ball spheres or portions of ball spheres. At the transition to the clamping cone 5, in each case there is a rounding Rev and RpV. The radius Rinsert back side Rer of the ball sphere of the back side 11 of the socket insert 3 is slightly larger than the radius RSOcket pole Rpp of the internal geometry of the hip socket 4. The rounding radius Rinsert rounding Rev at the socket insert 4 is equal to the rounding radius Rsocket rounding Rpv of the internal geometry of the hip socket 4. The resulting gap 8 between the components 3, 4 increases, starting from the region close to the lower cone end 9, to the pole 6 of the components 3, 4. The width of the gap 8 is denoted by reference numeral 10. 1.
