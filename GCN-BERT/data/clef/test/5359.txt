FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a fungicidal method employing fungicidal compositions comprising anhydrous milk fat (AMF). BACKGROUND Powdery mildew (PM) is one of the most serious global diseases of cucurbit, apple, rose, grape and cereal crops. The ubiquitous disease creates considerable problems because it reduces the photosynthetic area of leaves, which in turn diminishes yield (50-100% in the absence of control) and product quality. Worldwide costs associated with this disease are estimated by Dow AgroSciences to exceed US$100 million. Serious limitations with existing controls, namely DMI (demethylation-inhibiting) fungicide resistance, restrictions on the use of sulphur and sodium bicarbonate in organic systems, the lack of eradicant activity, and the lack efficacious organic alternatives, drive the need to find new control alternatives. Brazilian (1) and Australian (2) researchers have reported that milk is as effective as conventional fungicides in the control of PM in squash and grape crops respectively. While the Brazilian research was conducted using fresh whole-milk, the Australians have reported that full-fat and skim milk powders, and whey and whey protein powders are effective. Neither group of researchers have reported the compound(s) responsible for the fungicidal activity or the mode of action. A wide range of milk components including salts, proteins, fats, calcium, and free radicals, are postulated to contribute to antifungal activity and/or stimulate biological control. Fatty acids are reported to be toxic to diverse fungi and bacteria (3-5). The anti-fungal activity of plant oils (olive oil, canola oil, corn oil, grape seed oil, peanut oil, safflower oil, soya bean oil and sunflower oil) and mineral oils (JMS stylet oil) against powdery mildew has been reported (6-8). Problems associated with using whole- or skim-milk products as fungicides include milk spoilage, development of unpleasant odours, handling difficulties, application problems, poor durability of control, and unwanted growth of other non-target organisms, e.g. sooty mould. Fungicides containing free fatty acids and/or plant or animal oils/fats can be expensive, clog agricultural spray equipment, provide only variable disease control, have phyto-toxic effects and may be restricted products in organic systems. In the prior art, Bettiol, Crop Protection 18 (1999); 489-492 discloses the use of fresh cow's milk to control powdery mildew on zucchini squash. CZ9300350 discloses a fungicidal composition that contains lecithin and dried cow's milk. It is therefore an object of the invention to provide a fungicide that overcomes or ameliorates one or more of the problems with prior art fungicides, or that at least provides the public with a useful choice. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The invention provides a method of (a) preventing or controlling a fungal infection or (b) inhibiting germination of fungal spores, comprising application of a fungicidal composition to a plant in need thereof, wherein the fungicidal composition comprises (a) anhydrous milk fat (AMF), and(b) one or more of an agriculturally acceptable carrier, an emulsifier and an antioxidant.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION As discussed above, the present invention relates to a method of (a) preventing or controlling a fungal infection or (b) inhibiting germination of fungal spores, comprising application of a fungicidal composition to a plant in need thereof, wherein the fungicidal composition comprises anhydrous milk fat (AMF) and optionally one or more of soybean oil, olive oil and coconut fat; and one or more of an agriculturally acceptable carrier, an emulsifier and an antioxidant. The term "anhydrous milk fat" (AMF) as used herein is intended to mean a substantially anhydrous composition comprising at least 99, 99.1, 99.2, 99.3, 99.4, 99.5, 99.6, 99.7, 99.8 or 99.9% milk fat by weight, and useful ranges may be selected between any of the foregoing values. In one embodiment AMF is produced by separation and phase-inversion of cream. In one embodiment AMF is produced by concentrating cream to 70 to 80 % milk fat by subjecting cream to centrifugal separation. The resulting oil-in-water emulsion is then subjected to phase inversion. Phase inversion is carried out to produce a water-in-oil emulsion using a device able to mechanically shear fat membranes. In one embodiment the water-in-oil emulsion is subjected to a centrifugation step to produce a composition comprising 95 to 99 % milk fat. In one embodiment the 95 to 99 % milk fat composition is subjected to a centrifugation step to produce a composition comprising 99 to 99.5 % milk fat. In one embodiment the 99 to 99.5 % milk fat composition is dehydrated under vacuum to produce an AMF composition comprising about 99.8 % fat. Accordingly, reference to "anhydrous milk fat" (AMF) herein is intended to include milk fat compositions produced during the course of AMF production ("AMF precursors"). The compositions useful in the invention, in various embodiments, are sprayable and may be sprayed onto a subject in need thereof, or formulated as a concentrate that is sprayable on addition of agriculturally acceptable carriers and/or spray adjuvants. Preferred compositions are shelf stable. The term "shelf stable" is intended to mean that a composition does not separate out into separate phases, develop offensive odours and/or develop microbial growth. The term "agriculturally acceptable carrier" intended to include any material that facilitates application of a composition of the invention to the intended subject, which may for example be a plant, plant material or equipment, or that facilitates storage, transport or handling. Carriers used in compositions for application to plants and plant material are preferably non-phytotoxic or only mildly phytotoxic.

EXAMPLES TRIAL 1 - Materials and Methods Squash (Cucurbita maxima) cv 'Delica' and Zucchini (Cucurbita pepo) cv 'Black Jack' were potted in 80% bark 20% pumice media, were maintained for 8 weeks in glasshouses, with temperature ranging from 15°C (night) to 25°C (day), and a natural photo-period. Plants were watered twice daily for 3 min intervals using drip-feed irrigation. The media contained a complex mix of fertilisers (2 kg/m3 dolomite, 1 kg/m3 gypsum, 1 kg/m3 hydraflo, 2 kg/m3 lime, 5 kg/m3 Osmocote Plus, 1.5 kg/m3 Osmoform Pre-mix, 1 kg/m3 Super). Flowers, fruit and secondary shoots were removed throughout the course of the experiments, as were growing tips once the plants had reached an adequate size (11+ true leaves). Squash plants were trained up taut strings suspended from the glasshouse roof. Plants were randomly assigned to treatment groups (8 replicates per group) with one replicate plant from each treatment being randomly positioned on a separate table (block) in the glasshouse. Treatment applications were at 7-day intervals and involved spraying all leaves to run-off (approximately 5 ml per leaf) using hand-held mister-bottles. The first two spray applications to disease-free plants commenced 7 and 2 days before artificial inoculation, when the plants had at least 8 true leaves (i.e. were 5-6 weeks old), with the third application 2 days after inoculation, and five weekly applications thereafter. All milk ingredients tested were supplied by NZMP (NZ) Ltd, and solutions of these ingredients were prepared the day before application and stored overnight at 4°C. The first 2 true leaves on each plant were artificially inoculated with PM conidia from the cucurbit PM pathogen Sphaerotheca fuliginea. These were obtained from naturally infected glasshouse-grown squash plants. Spores from a detached source leaf were tapped onto the adaxial surface of each true leaf that was to be inoculated. Spores were applied in the same manner to Petri dishes with a known surface area (56.75 cm2) and volume (10 ml) of sterile water containing 0.01% (v/v) Tween 20. Following 15 replicate counts of the Petri dishes, using a Hausser Scientific hemacytometer, it was possible to ascertain that the inoculation process applied 2.7 x 103 ± 4.7 x 102 spores/cm2 (mean ± standard error). All remaining leaves on each plant were left to develop infection naturally. Disease severity on true leaves 3-8 was rated fortnightly using percent leaf area infection diagrams (see Figure 1) and a disease rating scale described by Spencer (9) and shown in Table 1: Table 1: Powdery Mildew leaf disease rating scale from Spencer (9).RatingPercent Leaf Area Infected0no infection10-1% infection22-5% infection36-20% infection421-40% infection5>40% infection6100% infection The first assessment was made 2 weeks after the initial treatment application, and then at 4 and 6 weeks. These data were analysed as a repeated measures design (RMD) to determine the treatment effect on disease severity over time. Treatment differences at 6 weeks only were also assessed as a randomised block design (RBD), by analysis of variance (ANOVA), with means separation by Fisher's Least Significant Difference (LSD) (P < 0.05), using SAS software, version 8.01 TS (SAS Institute, Cary, NC.). Qualitative assessments of leaf health/condition were made at the same time as disease severity assessments, using the arbitrary scale described below. Table 2: Arbitrary scale used to describe leaf condition for Trial 1.RatingLeaf ConditionAPerfect condition - no abiotic or biotic blemishes.BSmall blemishes e.g. chlorotic patches, rubbing, insect damageCSevere/advanced chlorosis, necrosis or leaf distortionDLeaf deadNote: a rating of A/B indicates a leaf condition intermediate between states A and B.

The solution was cooled to at least 30-40°C before application. Grindox 122™ is an antioxidant, compatible with fats and oils and required prior dissolution in liquefied AMF (> 40°C). Treatments 1 and 4-6 were produced by adding the components to water and mixing. TRIAL 1 - Results The data required a square root (SQRT) transformation to satisfy the assumptions required for ANOVA (normal distribution and homogeneity of variances). The corresponding untransformed values for each data point are given in parentheses in Figures 2 and 3. Figure 2 shows the effects of Table 3 treatments on PM disease severity on non-inoculated 'Delica' squash leaves, six weeks after initial treatment application. Whitefly proliferated in the glasshouse during this trial, leading to the co-appearance of sooty mould. Qualitative observations on the degree of sooty mould present in each treatment were made during PM disease assessments. Sooty mould was abundant in all treatments except sulphur, AMF and AMF+antiox. Sooty mould incidence was mild to non-existent on AMF-treated plants and was most severe for the whole milk and cream 55 treatments. Six weeks after the initial treatment application, squash plants sprayed with the sulphur, AMF, AMF+antioxidant, and milk+AO treatments had a median leaf heath rating of B, plants sprayed with milk had a B/C rating, and those sprayed with cream 55 had a C rating. Figure 3 shows the effects of treatment application on PM disease severity on non-inoculated 'Black Jack' zucchini leaves, six weeks after initial treatment application. Whitefly and sooty mould were present as described for the squash plants. Median leaf health ratings for the zucchini plants were B for the sulphur, AMF, AMF+antiox, and milk + AO treatments, and C for the whole milk, and cream 55 treatments. TRIALS 2 AND 3 - General Materials and Methods Squash (Cucurbita maxima) cv 'Delica' were raised and the first true leaf on each plant was artificially inoculated as in Trial 1. Treatment applications were normally at 7-day intervals (although 14 and 21 day intervals were also used in Trial 3) and involved spraying all leaves to run-off (approximately 5 ml per leaf) using hand-held mister-bottles. The first application commenced 3-4 days after artificial inoculation (except for elicitor treatments in Trial 3), when the non-inoculated leaves on plants were still largely disease-free, and plants had up to 8 true leaves (i.e. were 5-6 weeks old). All milk ingredients tested were supplied by NZMP (NZ) Ltd, and solutions of these ingredients were prepared the day before application and stored overnight at 4°C. Disease severity on true leaves 1-8 was rated weekly or fortnightly as discussed above. Data were analysed as a repeated measures design (RMD) to determine the treatment effect on disease severity over time. Treatment differences at final disease assessment were also assessed as a randomised block design (RBD), by analysis of variance (ANOVA), with means separation by Fisher's Least Significant Difference (LSD) (P < 0.05), using SAS software, version 8.01 TS (SAS Institute, Cary, NC.). Qualitative assessments of leaf health/condition were made at the same time as disease severity assessments, using the arbitrary scale described below.

The ability of a treatment to control PM infection was tested for by comparing final levels of infection (after 6 weeks of treatment application) against original infection levels. TRIAL 2 - Main Treatments A randomised block design was used comprising 8 blocks (tables in the glasshouse) and 15 treatments (including water sprayed and fungicide treated control plants), with one replicate plant per treatment per block. Treatments were first applied 4 days after artificial inoculation of the first true leaf, and weekly thereafter. There were 6 treatment applications in total. The treatments used are summarised in Table 5.

TRIAL 2 - Main Treatment Results - Randomised Block Design Figure 4 shows the effects of the Trial 2 Main Treatments on PM disease severity on non-inoculated leaves after six weeks of treatment application. "AMF+Dat+Coc", "Soya+Dat", "Oli+Dat", "Kumulus", "AMF+Dat", "Fish", "AMF+Dat+Syn", "Coc+Dat" and "AMF+Dat+Fish" were the most effective treatments in preventing PM infection. All these treatments were equally efficacious, limiting infections to less than 1% of the leaf surface area (PM disease rating <1). "AMF+191", "Synertrol" and "AMF+191+Natamax" produced intermediate levels of infection (1-5% of the leaf surface area). "H2O" was the worst treatment, followed by "Buttermilk", and then by "Cream 70". Leaf health ratings were assessed using the criteria described in Table 4 and are recorded in Table 6. Each value presented in Table 6 is a median value rather than an arithmetic mean.

Natural infections increased significantly over time for all treatments except "Kumulus", "AMF+Dat", "Fish", "Soya+Dat", "Coc+Dat", "Oli+Dat", "AMF+Dat+Fish", "AMF+Dat+Syn" and "AMF+Dat+Coc", where PM disease ratings remained the same over time or decreased, due to elimination of infections in the latter case. For inoculated leaves, disease severity was greater than in naturally infected leaves because of artificial introduction of the pathogen before the first treatment application (compare Tables 7 and 8).

All plants were naturally infected at the start of this experiment, so the first true leaves were not artificially inoculated. The first disease assessment coincided with the first treatment application and weekly thereafter for a further four treatment applications. TRIAL 2 - Additional Treatment Results For the additional treatments in Trial 2, all plants were naturally infected at the time of the first treatment application so there was no need for artificial inoculation. Disease assessments were made at 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 weeks after the first treatment application, as shown in Table 10.

Ltd, Tokyo, Japan.). The first true leaf of each plant was artificially inoculated with PM, while all other leaves on the plant were allowed to infect naturally. Elicitors (treatments 13-15) were first applied 5 days before artificial inoculation, to allow time for induction of host defences prior to advent of the PM fungus, and every three weeks thereafter. Repeat applications of Bion™ caused phyto-toxicity so this elicitor was only included in treatment 13 at the first application, and subsequent applications comprised just AMF+DATEM+Grindox 122. All other treatments were first applied 3 days after artificial inoculation and at weekly (treatments 1-4, 7-8, 10-12, 16-20), fortnightly (treatment 5), or 3 weekly intervals (treatments 6 and 9) thereafter. The effect of selected treatments on the germination of three other important horticultural fungi, Botrytis cinerea (causal agent of grey mould on grapes, kiwifruit, tomatoes, strawberries, etc), Monilinia fructicola (causal agent of brown rot on stonefruit), and Cladosporium cladosporiodes (one of the fungi that can cause sooty mould) were also assessed using the 96-multiwell assay of Wilson et al (10). TRIAL 3 - Main Treatment Results - Randomised Block Design Figure 6 shows the effects of the Trial 3 Main Treatments on disease severity in non-inoculated plants after 7 weeks of treatment. Figure 6 does not present any value for the "Capry+CA+LA" treatment because all non-inoculated leaves were dead due to severe phyto-toxicity. Leaf health ratings of non-inoculated leaves from Trial 3 after 7 weeks of treatment application are shown in Table 12. Leaf health ratings were assessed using the criteria described in Table 4. Each value presented in Table 12 is a median value rather than an arithmetic mean.

At the start of this trial (0 weeks after inoculation of the first true leaf), natural PM infections on the non-inoculated leaves (leaves 2-8) covered less than 1% of the leaf surface area, and there were no significant treatment differences at this stage except for plants from the three elicitor treatments containing BTH, BABA and Chitosan (Table 13). These elicited plants were virtually infection-free at 0 weeks, and were the only plants to receive a spray application 5 days before artificial inoculation (Table 13). Five days before artificial inoculation, all plants i.e. not only those treated with elicitors, were largely free of natural infection. Treatment effects were highly significant (p<0.0001) just two weeks after artificial inoculation, with a rapid breakdown in protective activity occurring in the "H2O", "BTH+AMF+Dat", "BABA+AMF+Dat", "1.25 J-2021", "CA+LA" and "Linol" treatments (Table 13). After 4 weeks of treatment application, all non-inoculated leaves had died in the "Capry+CA+LA" treatment so disease assessments were not possible after this time. For most treatments, the greatest increases in natural infections took place between 4 and 6 weeks, but disease severity in the "Kumulus", "1.4AMF+Dat", "0.7AMF+Dat", "AMF+Soy+Dat" and "AMF+Coc+Dat" treatments remained at or below the 0 week level throughout the course of the experiment (Table 13).

However, disease increased steadily throughout the trial on plants sprayed with "H2O", "CA+LA" and "Linol". It was not possible to measure disease rating of leaves receiving the "Capry+CA+LA" treatment from week 2 onwards, because they had died from severe phyto-toxicity.

TRIAL 3 - Additional Treatment Results Disease severity increased significantly over time on non-inoculated leaves treated with "DGML", but natural infections remained the same as the original levels through the course of the experiment for "AMF+Oli+Dat" (Figure 7). After 7 weeks, leaf health rating for non-inoculated "DGML" and "AMF+Oli+Dat" leaves were E and D, respectively. The decrease in the PM disease rating from 0 to 2 wks for inoculated leaves in the "AMF+Oli+Dat" treatment was significant (Figure 8). Health ratings for the first true leaf in both treatments were F/G due to natural senescence.

TRIAL 4 - Stability/Storage Three AMF emulsions were subjected to an ACVM (Agricultural Compounds and Veterinary Medicines) accelerated storage test to quantify their stability. The accelerated storage test (http://www.nzfsa.govt.nz/acvm/publications/standards-suidelines/chem-pc.pdf - last accessed 11 July 2005, see also 23 ACVM 06/05) comprised storing 3 batches of each product for 2 weeks at 54°C, conditions thought to approximate 2 years storage at ambient temperature. Immediately before and after accelerated storage, peroxide value (PV), p-anisidine value (AV), and free fatty acids (FFA) were measured by AgriQuality New Zealand Ltd, Auckland. These measurements provide an indication of the extent of lipid oxidation that releases flavour compounds responsible for unpleasant odours and flavours. Since analysis of the end products of lipid auto-oxidation is problematic, indicative measures of oxidation are: Peroxide valuemeasures hydroperoxides, intermediate compounds of lipid oxidation that can be further oxidised to produce powerful aroma compounds.Anisidine valuemeasures α/β unsaturated aldehydes, which are by-products of lipid oxidationFree fatty acidsthese tend to increase as complex lipids are degraded. Short chain fatty acids also contribute to odours, but are difficult to detect by this assay. The TOTOX number (AV + (2x PV)) was also calculated for all samples tested. This number provides a single estimate of both intermediate and end products resulting from lipid oxidation. The three emulsions tested are set out in Table 17.

TRIAL 5 - Materials and Methods Mature (11 year old) grapevines (Vitis vinifera) cv. Chardonnay were allowed to infect naturally. There were five treatments as shown in Table 19. Nine sprays were applied between capfall and harvest as detailed in Table 20, using a motorised, moderate pressure handgun, at an application rate of 500 L/ha during capfall and thereafter at 800 L/ha. The milk fat fungicide was prepared as an emulsifiable concentrate, diluted 35-fold with water immediately prior to use. Botrytis cinerea, sour rot and powdery mildew disease incidences (percentage of bunches/leaves infected) and severities (percentage of leaf/bunch area covered by disease) were assessed using 50 leaves/bunches per plot. Percentage of total fruit crop/leaf canopy infected was calculated as the product of disease incidence and mean severity. PM infections on fruit were assessed at veraison. PM infections on leaves, B. cinerea and sour rot infections on fruit and yield (kg fruit/vine) were assessed at harvest. The experiment was analysed as a randomised block design with 4 replicate vines per treatment, with each replicate vine in a separate row (plot). ANOVA and means separation by LSD (P < 0.05) were performed using SAS software, version 8.02 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). TRIAL 5 -Treatments Table 19: Trial 5 treatments.

TRIAL 5 - Results "AMF" provided control of PM on grapevine leaves that equaled that of the sulphur ("Kumulus"), copper ("Kocide"), and full fungicide ("Full fungic") spray programmes (Figure 9). On grape berries, "Kumulus" and "AMF" provided control that was significantly greater than that on "Unsprayed" berries, but not quite as good as that demonstrated by "Kocide" and the "Full fungic" treatments. Table 21 shows the effects of Trial 5 treatments on the percentage of total fruit crop infected by PM, assessed at veraison. Total crop infected was calculated as a product of disease incidence and mean severity, using data collected from fifty randomly selected bunches per vine.

None of the treatments had any significant effect on yield (Figure 10). TRIAL 6 - Materials and Methods Wheat (Triticum aestivum) plants, cultivar Endeavour, were sown at a density of four plants per 12 cm diam. pot, with two pots per treatment. Plants were maintained in two blocks (1 pot/treatment/block) in a C.E. room at 20°C with a 16-hour photoperiod. After one week, the experimental plants were artificially inoculated by brushing them against inoculum wheat plants infected with Erysiphe graminis f. sp. tritici (wheat PM). Treatment application commenced when the plants were two weeks old and at plant growth stage (PGS) 1, as defined by James (11). Leaves were sprayed to run-off using a hand-held spray bottle, with a total of 9 spray applications being made over a course of 7 weeks (2 sprays/week for the first fortnight, and 1 spray/week thereafter). The first disease assessment (designated Time 0) was made immediately before the first treatment application, followed by assessments at two weeks (PGS=3-4), 3 weeks (PGS=4-5), 5 weeks (PGS=8), and 7 weeks (PGS=8-10). Disease severity on the 3 most basal leaves of each plant was assessed using percent leaf area infection diagrams (Figure 11), and the rating scale shown in Table 24. Disease ratings for the three leaves were averaged to give one value per plant. Since disease assessments were made on different leaves on each assessment date, data from each assessment date was analysed separately, using a nested design, with treatments nested within pots and plants within treatments and pots.

At all disease assessments, there were no obvious signs of phyto-toxicity associated with the treatments. At 0 weeks, there are no consistent treatment differences evident (Figure 12), but by 7 weeks, "Amistar", "AMF" and "Soy" all provided significantly greater control of PM than "Unsprayed" and "Water" treated controls (Figure 13). TRIAL 7 - Materials and Methods Materials and methods were the same as for Trials 2 and 3, except that 'Delica' squash plants were allowed to develop natural infection, rather than having their first true leaf artificially inoculated. Six spray applications were made at 7-day intervals with approximately 1% of the leaf area naturally infected with PM at the time of the first treatment application. Disease severity on true leaves 1-8 was ranked fortnightly using the scale in Table 1 and qualitative assessments of leaf health/condition were made at the same time using the arbitrary scale described in Table 4. Data were analysed as a repeated measures design (RMD) to determine the treatment effect on disease severity over time. Treatment differences at 6 weeks only were also assessed as a randomised block design (RBD), by analysis of variance (ANOVA), with means separation by Fisher's Least Significant Difference (LSD) (P < 0.05), using SAS software, version 8.01 TS (SAS Institute, Cary, NC.).

Treatments were sourced as follows: AMF (NZMP (NZ) Ltd); all Grinsted emulsifiers, Grindox antioxidants and DATEM Panodan™ AL 10 emulsifier (Danisco Ltd, Brabrand, Denmark); and lecithin (Hawkins Watts Ltd, Auckland, NZ). TRIAL 7 - Results - Randomised Block Design Figure 14 shows the effects of Table 26 treatments on PM disease severity on 'Delica' squash leaves, after 6 weeks of treatment application. The best treatments in order of efficaciousness were "AMF+Dat+Toco", "AMF+Dat+AP", "AMF+Dat+204", "AMF+CSL+122", "AMF+Dat+122" and "AMF+PGE+122" which limited PM severity to <5% of the leaf surface area, and performed significantly better than "AMF+PGPR+122" and "AMF+Lecit+122" which were in turn significantly more effective than "AMF+Citrem+122". "Water" treated plants had significantly more infections than all other treatments. All of the treatments reduced PM infection relative to the water control, but they had variable effects on plant health (Table 27).

With assessment of treatment effect over time (0, 2, 4 and 6 week data), highly significant treatment differences in the PM disease ratings were detectable after just 2 weeks of treatment application (p<0.0001 and Table 28). Natural infections increased significantly over time up until 4 weeks for all treatments. After this time, PM disease ratings remained the same over time or decreased, due to elimination of infections in the latter case, for all treatments except for "H2O" where disease severity continued to increase significantly until the end of the experiment.

Plants were maintained in a controlled environment (CE) room set at a constant temperature of 20°C and a 16 h photoperiod. Pots were hand-watered with tap water every two to three days. The plants were left for three weeks to establish, form new leaf growth, and infect naturally with PM before commencement of the trial. Roses buds and flowers were removed throughout the course of the trial. There were five treatment applications at weekly intervals. All treatments were applied using hand-held mister bottles to the adaxial and abaxial leaf surfaces until runoff to ensure full coverage. There were six replicates (pots) per treatment. The pots were randomised within blocks on a single bench within the CE room, with one replicate plant from each treatment in each block. Disease assessments were carried out immediately prior to each spray application and one week after the last spray. Assessments of PM were based on the disease rating scale in Table 1, except that assessments were not carried out on individual leaves as in Trials 1-3 and 7, because roses have relatively rapid growth and turnover of leaves. Rather, the disease rating was given as an overall average for the mature portion of the plant, excluding all the fresh unexpanded juvenile leaves. Data from the final assessment were analysed as a randomised block design (RBD), by analysis of variance (ANOVA), with means separation by Fisher's Least Significant Difference (LSD) (P < 0.05), using SAS software, version 8.01 TS (SAS Institute, Cary, NC.).

TRIAL 9 - Materials and Methods 'Royal Gala' apple seedlings with approximately 8 true leaves were potted into 10 cm diam. plastic pots using Butlers' potting mix, and were maintained in a controlled environment (CE) room set at a constant temperature of 20°C and a 16 h photoperiod. Pots were hand-watered with tap water every two to three days. Plants were already showing initial signs of natural PM infection (<1% of the leaf surface area infected) at the time of the first treatment application. All treatments were applied weekly over the course of 7 weeks to adaxial and abaxial leaf surfaces until runoff to ensure full coverage. There were eight replicates (pots) per treatment. One replicate from each treatment was randomised with each block on a single bench within the CE room. Leaf assessments were carried out immediately prior to each spray application and one week after the last spray. Assessments of PM disease severity were based on the disease rating scale in Table 1. At each assessment, the number of leaves on each apple seedling was determined, excluding all the fresh unexpanded juvenile leaves, and ratings were given for every individual leaf and the mean leaf disease rating was calculated for each plant. Disease incidence was determined as the percentage of leaves expressing PM out of the total number of leaves on each plant At the conclusion of the experiment, two harvest parameters were measured. The plants were excised at ground level, and plant height (cm) was measured from ground level to the tip of the stem. Excised plants were oven-dried at 80°C and dry weights of the above ground plant parts were determined. PM disease severity ratings and disease incidence from the final assessment, and harvest parameters were each analysed using a randomised block design (RBD), by analysis of variance (ANOVA), with means separation by Fisher's Least Significant Difference (LSD) (P < 0.05), using SAS software, version 8.01 TS (SAS Institute, Cary, NC.).

Disease control efficacy was the greatest in these two treatments followed by "Soy" which was significantly better than "H2O and "Unsprayed" treatments (Figure 16). Disease incidence treatment rankings shown in Figure 17 were the same as the disease severity rankings in Figure 16, i.e. "Kumulus" and "AMF" treatments resulted in the lowest disease incidence, followed by "Soy" which in turn had significantly lower disease incidence than the "H2O and "Unsprayed" treatments (Figure 17). Figure 18 shows that dry weights were greatest in the "AMF" treatment, intermediate in the "Kumulus" and "Soy" treatments and lowest in the "H2O" and "Unsprayed" treatments. Shoot height data in Figure 19 required a loge transformation to satisfy the assumptions required for ANOVA (normal distribution and homogeneity of variances). The corresponding untransformed values for each data point are given in parentheses. "Unsprayed" and "H2O" treated plants were significantly more stunted than those in the "Soy", "Kumulus" and "AMF" treatments (Figure 19). TRIAL 10 - Materials and Methods Suspensions of a mixture of spores and mycelial fragments of Strain 298 of Mycosphaerella fijiensis were spread over the following growth media. 1) Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) unamended2) PDA amended with single strength AMF (10ml of x10 concentration /100ml medium).3) PDA amended with double strength AMF (20 ml of x10 concentration /100 ml medium). There were three replicate plates of each concentration. Plates were inoculated, incubated at 23 to 24°C with a 12 hour photoperiod and assessed after 25 days growth. TRIAL 10 - Results ANOVA analysis of the colony number data in Figure 20 necessitated a square root (SQRT) data transformation. The corresponding untransformed values for each data point are given in parentheses. Single strength AMF significantly reduced the number of colonies growing on PDA and doubling the strength of AMF caused a further significant reduction in colony number (Figure 20). Single strength AMF significantly reduced the mean colony diameter on PDA and doubling the strength of AMF caused a further significant reduction in colony diameter (Figure 21). TRIAL 11 - Materials and Methods Mature grapevines (Vitis vinifera) cv. Chardonnay were allowed to infect naturally. There were six treatments as shown in Table 31. Nine sprays were applied between capfall and harvest as detailed in Table 32, at an application rate of 500 L/ha during capfall and thereafter at 800 L/ha. The milk fat and soy fungicides were prepared as emulsifiable concentrates, diluted 25-fold with water immediately prior to use. Percentage of total fruit crop infected by Botrytis cinerea and powdery mildew was calculated as the product of disease incidence (percentage of bunches infected) and mean disease severity (percentage of bunch area covered by disease), using a sample size of 50 bunches per plot. PM infections on fruit were assessed at veraison. B. cinerea infections on fruit, yield (kg fruit/m)and percent canopy leaf burn were assessed at harvest. The experiment was analysed as a randomised block design with 5 blocks and one plot of two vines per treatment per block. The outermost 1.5 m of each plot was disregarded when sampling bunches. ANOVA and means separation by LSD (P < 0.05) were performed using SAS software, version 8.02 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). TRIAL 11 - Treatments Table 31: Trial 11 treatments.

The most effective treatments in preventing PM were "Soy", "AMF/Late Fung" and "PM Fung Only". Use AMF during the early/mid season and standard fungicides late season provided better disease control than if AMF or standard fungicides were used on their own throughout the whole season (Table 33). "AMF/Late Fung" provided significantly better Botrytis control than "AMF only", which in turn gave significantly better control than "Unsprayed" and "PM Fung Only" (Figure 22). Botrytis control efficacy on the "Std Fung" and "NP2 only" treatments was intermediate between "AMF/Late Fung" and "AMF Only" (Figure 22). Use of either Soy or AMF throughout the entire grape season caused significant phyto-toxicity, but this problem was eliminated by restricting AMF application to the early/mid season and using standard fungicides late season (Figure 23). Crop yield were highest in the "AMF/Late Fung" treatment, followed by "Std Fung" (Figure 24). The yields of these 2 treatments were significantly greater than the "PM Fung Only" treatment, with all other treatment yields intermediate between these upper and lower values (Figure 24).
