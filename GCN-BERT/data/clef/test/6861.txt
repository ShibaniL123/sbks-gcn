CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 62/144,487, filed Apr. 8, 2015, the contents of which are incorporated herein. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a cosmetic brush, and more particularly, to a cosmetic brush wherein an application portion includes twisted bristles for applying a cosmetic liquid to the eyelashes and a comb for arranging the eyelashes are simultaneously formed on a single brush rod so that the application of the cosmetic liquid to the eyelashes and the arrangement of the eyelashes can be performed at one time. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Mascara is a cosmetic used by women to apply mascara liquids of various colors to their eyelashes so that their eyes can look better in an esthetic sense. Generally, as shown in FIG. 1, a mascara brush 100 comprises a container 150 for containing a mascara liquid, a grip 160 for opening and closing the container 150, a brush rod 120 extending downwardly from the grip 160, and a brush part 130 formed at the brush rod 120. The mascara liquid is used in such a manner that the brush part 130 is smeared with the mascara liquid through engagement or disengagement of the grip 160 to or from the container 150. Particularly, depending on the length and configuration of the bristles, the mascara brush 100 constructed as above is manufactured to be adapted to various functions such as volume-up (effect of allowing the eyelashes to be seen abundantly), curling (effect of upwardly curling the distal ends of the eyelashes), long lash (effect of the allowing eyelashes to appear longer) and clean (effect of preventing the eyelashes from being entangled) for eyelashes. As shown in FIGS. 1A and 1B, the conventional mascara brush that has been typically used is manufactured in such a manner that bristles 131 of the brush part 130 with a generally constant length are disposed between two stands of wires (FIG. 1B) and the wires are then twisted several times so that the brush part 130 can have a cross section in the form of any of various shapes, including circular, triangular, and sectorial shapes about a wire shaft 121. The effects of volume-up, curling, long lash and clean can be obtained with respect to the respective shapes of the cross section of the brush part 130. The basic function of the mascara brush is to evenly apply a viscous mascara liquid to the eyelashes and to appropriately comb the eyelashes by means of the brush part so that the eyelashes are not entangled. Since the bristles 131 extend radially along a helical path due to the twisting of the wires in the conventional mascara brush 100, a great deal of mascara liquid can be accommodated between the respective bristles 131. Thus, the conventional mascara brush can make the eyelashes appear voluminous. However, eyelashes often become entangled due to the viscosity of the mascara liquid. Accordingly, there is an inconvenience in that the eyelashes must be arranged using an additional arranging instrument, or because make-up application must be performed again after the excess mascara liquid is removed. A mascara brush 200 for solving the entanglement phenomenon of eyelashes of the previous mascara brush, as shown in FIG. 2, comprises a brush rod 220 of which the lower end has a diameter smaller than that of the upper end thereof, and a brush part 230 that is formed at a side surface of the lower end of the brush rod and has bristles 231 formed by a separate manufacturing apparatus from the same synthetic resin material as the brush rod 220 and then fixed to the brush rod 220. The bristles 231 are arranged longitudinally in a line on the side surface of the lower end of the brush rod 220 to take the shape of a linear comb. Thus, when a mascara liquid is applied to the eyelashes, it is applied while permeating through the eyelashes due to the combing of the linear brush part 230. Accordingly, the effects of clean and long lash can be obtained. Meanwhile, the bristles 231 of the mascara brush 200 are formed of a material similar to a material for the brush rod 220, which is made of a synthetic resin such as polyamide. The bristles 231 are completed by slitting a mass of the synthetic resin constructing the brush part 230 into fine strands. In view of properties of the synthetic resin, however, the bristles 231 cannot be formed finely to such an extent as the bristles 131 of the conventional mascara brush 100 shown in FIG. 1A. Further, since the wide spacing of the respective bristles 231 deteriorates their capability to accommodate a mascara liquid, it is difficult to apply the mascara liquid in case of tufty or long eyelashes. Moreover, although the linearly arranged bristles 231 apply the mascara liquid to the eyelashes in such a manner that they comb the eyelashes upon application of the mascara liquid, thereby preventing the entanglement phenomenon of the eyelashes, there is a problem in that the effects of volume-up and curling of the eyelashes are deteriorated. Mascara brushes have been developed with brush bristles and comb bristles. Traditionally, the comb mascara brush combination was produced by employing one of the following techniques: bi-injection molding a separate comb attached over a brush, and/or by changing a single or multiple line of bristles to be a different size in length or thickness to serve as a comb after being twisted. When the comb is made by altering the length or thickness of single or multiple lines of bristle then by twisting it, it often loses effectiveness as a comb as the comb bristles are separated in a helical shape. None of the prior methods provides an efficient means of producing a twisted cosmetic brush with a comb. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In at least one embodiment, the present invention provides a cosmetic brush including a rod extending from a grip and a brush part defined proximate the opposite end of the rod. The brush part defines a plurality of brush bristles positioned in a twisted configuration and a plurality of comb bristles positioned in at least one non-twisted comb line. In at least one embodiment, the brush part is formed by twisting a pair of opposed wires with the brush and comb bristles positioned therebtween. In at least one embodiment, the brush part is formed by twisting a molded rod and bristle assembly. In at least one embodiment, the brush part is formed by stacking a plurality of discs along the rod.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION In the drawings, like numerals indicate like elements throughout. Certain terminology is used herein for convenience only and is not to be taken as a limitation on the present invention. The following describes preferred embodiments of the present invention. However, it should be understood, based on this disclosure, that the invention is not limited by the preferred embodiments described herein. Referring to FIGS. 3-5, an exemplary embodiment of a cosmetic brush part 30 in accordance with an embodiment of the invention will be described. The cosmetic brush part 30 includes a rod 36 defined by a pair of twisted wires 32a and 32b. The wires 32a, 32b may be separate wires or a single wire folded upon itself in a u-shape. Prior to twisting, as illustrated in FIG. 3, the wires 32a and 32b extend generally parallel to one another with a gap 35 therebetween. A plurality of brush bristles 34 are positioned within the gap 35, extending generally perpendicular to the wires 32a, 32b. A plurality of comb bristles 38 are also positioned within the gap 35 generally perpendicular thereto. The comb bristles 38 may be made with a different length, thickness, or material than the brush bristles 34. Each comb bristle 38 is positioned between a subset 37 of brush bristles 34. The number of brush bristles 34 in each subset 37 may vary between subsets. The space between the comb bristles 38, and the corresponding number of brush bristles 34 in the subsets 37, is selected to correspond to the degree of twisting of the wires 32a and 32b. The spacing of the comb bristles 38 is determined by the degree of twisting that will be applied to the wires 32a, 32b. Spacing between the comb bristles 38 and the degree of twisting is related due to the fact that if the degree of twist is not enough to reach an integer multiple of minimal angle to the next rotational symmetry, the arrangement will not form a single straight line of comb. A simple mathematical calculation governs the relationship between the desired comb bristle interval, the amount of twisting per set length, and the minimal angle to reach rotational symmetry. Below is an example equation that could be used to figure out degree of twisting needed for the brush. This equation is shown only as an example of one of possible equations and by no means does it describe all possible combinations. θ=(n*θ—s*1)/x—c Where θ stands for total degree of twist needed for desired outcome, n represents integer multiple of n̂th symmetry, θ_s stands for minimal angle to next rotational symmetry, l stands for total length of wire used in brush, and finally, x_c stands for the desired comb bristle distance. As illustrated in FIG. 4, the wires 32a and 32b are twisted in the direction indicated by arrow A. As the wires 32a, 32b are twisted, the bristles 34 and 38 are retained between the wires and also twisted thereby, i.e. moved from the original plane as illustrated in FIG. 3. The wires 32a, 32b are twisted a desired amount such that the brush bristles 34 are sufficiently retained and extend in a helical path 40 or other twisted configuration, as illustrated in FIG. 5. By twisted configuration, it is meant that the adjacent brush bristles 34 do not extend in planar rows parallel to the axis of the rod 36. The comb bristles 38 on the other hand are positioned such that once twisting is complete, the comb bristles 38 extend in a planar row 42 generally parallel to the axis of the rod 36. While a single planar row 42, with the comb bristles 38 extending on both sides of the rod 36, is illustrated, other configurations may be utilized. For example, the comb bristles 38 may form multiple lines which are circumferentially offset from one another or the single or multiple lines may be at an angle relative to the rod axis. Additionally, the comb lines may be segmented or staggered. Various other configurations may also be achieved by varying the spacing of the comb bristles 38 in relation to the amount of twist to be applied to the wires 32a, 32b. Referring to FIG. 6, a cosmetic brush part 30′ in accordance with another embodiment will be described. The cosmetic brush part 30′ will have a configuration similar to that illustrated in FIG. 5, except that the brush part 30′ includes brush bristles 34′ and comb bristles 38′ extending from a molded rod 36′. FIG. 6 shows the molded brush part 30′ in a flattened, non-twisted illustration so that the position of the comb bristles 38′ may be illustrated. It is understood that the rod 36′ will be formed in a generally cylindrical configuration with the bristles 34′, 38′ extending radially therefrom. In the present embodiment, the comb bristles 38′ are positioned along the molded rod 36′ in select positions prior to twisting. The comb bristle location is determined by placing them in an opposite direction of the twist following a mathematically calculated spiral path such that the comb bristles 38′ line up to form one or more lines as a comb after being twisted. The brush bristles 34′ will extend in a helical or twisted configuration similar to the previous embodiment. Referring to FIGS. 7-9, a cosmetic brush 50 in accordance with another embodiment of the invention will be described. The cosmetic brush 50 includes a rod 36″ extending from a grip 51 with a plurality of discs 52a to 52n positioned on the rod 36″ to define the brush part. Each disc 52a, 52n includes a disc body 54 with an opening 55 defining at least one keying surface 57 configured to engage the rod 36″ such that the disc body 54 is oriented relative to the rod 36″. In the illustrated embodiment, the rod 36″ and opening 55 have complementary octagonal configurations, with the keying surface 57 being one of the octagonal sides. At least one comb bristle 58a . . . n and a plurality of brush bristles 56a . . . n extend from each disc body 54. Each of the comb bristles 58a . . . n which are at a given relationship relative to the keying surface 57 such that when the discs 52a . . . n are stacked, the comb bristles 58a . . . n define a desired comb line configuration. In the illustrated embodiment, the comb bristles 58a . . . n define a single comb line. Similarly, the brush bristles 56a . . . n are at a given relationship relative to the keying surface 57 such that when the discs 52a . . . n are stacked, the brush bristles 56a . . . n define a desired helical or twisted configuration. The number and variation in configuration of the discs 52a . . . n may be selected as desired and the discs 52a . . . n may repeat within the brush part. Upon assembly, the cosmetic brush 50 will have a configuration similar to that illustrated in FIG. 5.
