Example 11. Preparation of PAG-2
A 25 mL flask was charged with 2-hydroxy-2-trifluoromethylacetophenone (SM-9, 0.57 g, 2.38 mmol, 1.0 eq.) and THF (6 mL) under nitrogen stream, and the mixture was stirred for 15 minutes at −40° C. nBuLi (1.6 M, 1.5 mL, 2.38 mmol, 1.0 eq.) was added drop-wise to the mixture over 10 minutes and the mixture was stirred for 45 minutes at −40° C. This solution was then added drop-wise to a cold (−40° C.) solution of 2-(chlorosulfonyl)-2,2-difluoroethyl pivalate (SM-3, 0.74 g, 2.38 mmol, 1.0 eq.) in THF (6 mL) over 10 minutes. The resulting mixture was stirred for 3 hours while warming from −40° C. to 10° C. 1N HCl (12 mL) was added to the final reaction mixture and then AcOEt (36 mL) was added. The upper layer was separated and the lower layer was extracted with AcOEt (24 mL). The organic layers were combined and washed with 1N HCl (12 mL) and brine (12 mL), and the solution was subsequently dried over anhydrous MgSO4 and filtered. The solvents were removed in an evaporator and the crude product was purified by column chromatography (Hexane/AcOEt) to obtain the target PAG as a white solid (0.15 g, 14.6% yield).
