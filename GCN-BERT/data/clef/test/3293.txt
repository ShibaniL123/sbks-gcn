MAGNETIC SELF-ALIGNING MANUFACTURING FIXTURE FIELD OF THE INVENTION Efficiencies in a manufacturing process may be enhanced by limiting motions and confirmation steps to achieve proper alignment and securing of fixture portions on a fixture. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Traditional manufacturing fixtures hold portions of an article for a manufacturing process to be performed. When performing a subsequent manufacturing operation on the article, the article may be removed from the first fixture and positioned in a second fixture to perform the second operation. The transferring of the article between multiple fixtures increases potential manufacturing errors and reduces efficiencies. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Aspects are directed to a magnetic self- aligning manufacturing fixture having magnetic members aiding in the self-alignment of fixture portions. The magnetic members are secured to different portions of the fixture such that the alignment of the magnetic members causes the fixture portions to be placed into a magnetically coupled and aligned arrangement. In an exemplary aspect, the geometric configuration of the magnetic members further aid in the self-alignment. Further, it is contemplated that the magnetic field configuration of the magnetic members also aid in the self-alignment.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Aspects hereof provide a magnetic self- aligning manufacturing fixture having magnetic members aiding in the self-alignment of portions forming the fixture. The magnetic members are secured to different portions of the fixture such that the alignment of the magnetic members causes the fixture portions to be placed into a magnetically coupled and aligned arrangement. In an exemplary aspect, the geometric configuration of the magnetic members further aid in the self-alignment. Further, it is contemplated that the magnetic field configuration of the magnetic members also aid in the self-alignment. An exemplary aspect provides a magnetic self-aligning manufacturing fixture. The fixture is comprised of a support plate having a top surface and an opposite bottom surface. The support plate comprises a first alignment socket having a first configuration adapted to receive a magnetic convex member. The fixture is also comprised of a compression plate having a top surface and an opposite bottom surface. The compression plate comprises a second alignment socket having a second configuration to receive a magnetic concave member. An additional exemplary aspect provides a magnetic self-aligning manufacturing fixture. The fixture is comprised of a non-magnetic support plate having a top surface and an opposite bottom surface with a first alignment socket extend through at least a portion of the support plate. The fixture is also comprised of a magnetic convex member. The magnetic convex member is maintained in the first alignment socket such that a spherical cap portion of the magnetic convex member extends beyond the support plate top surface. The fixture is further comprised of a compression plate having a top surface and an opposite bottom surface. The compression plate comprising a second alignment socket. The fixture is further comprised of a magnetic concave member. The magnetic concave member is maintained in the second alignment socket and has a spherical cap receiving portion extending between the compression plate top surface and the compression plate bottom surface. Turning briefly to FIG. 1, which depicts an exemplary magnetic self-aligning fixture, in accordance with aspects hereof. Similar to the elements of FIG. 2 discussed in more detail hereinafter, FIG. 1 is comprised of a support plate 102, a compression plate 104, and a plurality of magnetic member 112. Each of the support plate, the compression plate, and the magnetic members will be discussed in more detail with respect to subsequent figures. The support plate 102 represents a support plate that may be of any size, shape, and/or configuration. The compression plate 104 represents a compression plate that may be of any size, shape, and/or configuration. Similarly, it is understood that any number of compression plates maybe used in conjunction with a support plate. For example, FIG. 2 depicts three compression plates while FIG. 1 depicts a single compression plate. This exemplifies that any number of plates, compression and/or support, may be used in any combination. Also depicted is a manufacturing void 114 extending through the compression plate 104. The manufacturing void may be of any shape, size, location and//or configuration in exemplary aspects. Similarly, two magnetic members 112 are depicted, similar to the magnetic member 212 of FIG. 2. It is contemplated that any number of magnetic members of any size, shape, and/or configuration may be used. Further, it is contemplated that a magnetic member may be positioned in any location of any plate suitable for aspects provided herein. FIG. 1, therefore, exemplifies a magnetic self-aligning fixture that may have a variety of configurations. As will be discussed hereinafter, the used of one or more magnetic members provides a number of contemplated benefits. For example, a magnetic member may aid with or cause the self-alignment of two or more components, such as a support plate and a compression plate. This self-aligning characteristic is enhanced by the geometric configuration of the magnetic members, and/or the magnetic field alignment of the magnetic members, as will be discussed hereinafter. The magnetic members are also contemplated as providing a compressive force for maintaining one or more portions in a desired relationship. For example, the compressive force generated as a result of the magnetic attraction between magnetic members may be effective for maintaining a compression plate in a desired orientation/position relative to a support plate and/or an article. Further, it is contemplated that the compressive force generated by magnetic members may be useable for maintaining an article in a fixed orientation/position relative to one or more plates during and for a manufacturing operation. It is contemplated that the amount of compressive force generated by magnetic members may be adjusted by changing the number of magnetic member (e.g., adding magnetic members to increase a compressive force experienced by a self-aligning magnetic fixture), by changing the location of the magnetic members (e.g., position closer to manufacturing voids for a greater transfer of compression to the article), and/or hanging the size/configuration of the magnetic members. The use of magnetic member may allow for the omission of one or more traditional fasteners because of the compressive force able to be generated by the magnetic members. Therefore, it is contemplated that any number of magnetic members may be used in any location and in any configuration to achieve a desired compressive force that may allow for the omission of one or more mechanical fasteners, in an exemplary aspect. Referring now to FIG. 2, an exemplary magnetic self-aligning fixture 200 is depicted, in accordance with aspects hereof. The fixture 200 is comprised of a support plate 202, a first compression plate 208, a second compression plate 206, a third compression plate 204, a hinge 210, a magnetic member 212, and a manufacturing void 214. The fixture 200 maintains and aligns one or more articles during a manufacturing process. For example, it is contemplated that the fixture 200 is useable for securing flexible material in a desired location within the fixture 200 for a manufacturing process, such as sewing, embroidering, cutting, painting, bonding, welding, printing, embossing, and the like. In an exemplary aspect, it is contemplated that the fixture 200 is configured to maintain one or more portions of an article of footwear, such as a shoe upper, for a manufacturing process to be performed on the one or more portions. For example, a material that is intended to provide additional structural integrity to a forefoot opening of a shoe upper may be maintained in a desired position relative to the shoe upper by the fixture 200 for a stitching or bonding technique to be performed by an automated mechanism, such as a sewing machine. Additional implementation of the fixture 200 are contemplated to be within the scope of aspects provided hereof. For example, the fixture 200 may be used in the manufacturing of apparel, equipment, automotive applications, aeronautical applications, and other industrial applications. As such, while aspects will be described in relation to the manufacture of an article of footwear, it is understood that additional applications are contemplated and suited for the use of the fixture 200. The support plate 202 may be formed from any material and of any configuration. However, in an exemplary aspect, the support plate 202 is formed from a material having a non-magnetic characteristic. A non-magnetic characteristic is a material that is minimally affected by magnetic fields, such that the non-magnetic material exhibits a minimal attraction or repulsion from a magnetic member, such as the magnetic member 212. In an exemplary aspect the significance of a non-magnetic material forming the support plate may include a minimized interference between the self-aligning properties formed between the attraction of components (e.g., a male and a female) forming the magnetic member 212. Stated differently, it is contemplated that the support plate being formed from a non-magnetic material may minimally affect the alignment and the attraction of the magnetic member 212 allowing for a magnetic coupling of the support plate 202 with one or more compression plates. Exemplary non-magnetic materials include, but are not limited to, copper, aluminum, polymers, and other materials (e.g., phenolic resin laminates). The support plate 202, in an exemplary aspect, includes one or more alignment sockets that will be discussed hereinafter in more detail at FIG. 4. An alignment socket is a socket or cavity that is formed to extend between or through a top surface and/or a bottom surface of the support plate 202. The alignment socket is configured to maintain and secure a magnetic member to the support plate 202 for alignment and magnetic coupling with a compression plate having a complimentary portion of the magnetic member. It is this interaction between complimentary magnetic members that provide, in part, an effective self- aligning magnetic coupling of two portion of the fixture 200 for use in a manufacturing process. The support plate 202 may also comprise one or more manufacturing features. Examples of manufacturing features include, but are not limited to, recessed portions intended to receive and hold one or more articles to which a manufacturing process is to be performed (e.g., portions used in the construction of an article of footwear). In an exemplary aspect, the manufacturing feature may be formed from a subtractive process (e.g., milling) and/or from an additive process (e.g., material deposition, lamination). Therefore, in an exemplary aspect, the support plate 202 is formed from a material that is conducive for forming one or more manufacturing features. The support plate 202, in an exemplary aspect, is formed have a specific thickness extending between the top surface and the bottom surface. As will be discussed in FIG. 3 hereinafter, the thickness of the support plate 202 may relate to or affect the configuration of an alignment socket configuration and/or a magnetic member. For example, the support plate 202 may have a thickness between the top surface and the bottom surface that is greater than a thickness of a portion of a magnetic member maintained in an alignment socket extending through at least a portion of the support plate 202 thickness. A relationship may be formed between the support plate 202, the configuration of the alignment socket configuration, and the magnetic member configuration to achieve an effective self-alignment between the support plate 202 and a compression plate. In addition to the support plate having a thickness, the support plate may have a specified length and width, in an exemplary aspect. The length and/or the width may be established to allow for a universal application on a production line or on a particular manufacturing apparatus. For example, a jig or other alignment mechanism used by a manufacturing apparatus may be configured to receive a particular sized support plate regardless of the manufacturing feature configuration of the support plate. Stated differently, a first support plate that is configured for the manufacture of a particular article may have a common length and/or width with a second support plate that is configured for the manufacture of a different article. This standardization may allow for the universal application of the support plate and increased manufacturing efficiencies, in an exemplary aspect. Turning to the compression plates 204, 206, and 208 generally. A compression plate is contemplated as being configured for magnetically (and/or mechanically) coupling with another plate portion, such as the support plate 202 and/or another compression plate. The compression plate 208 is a compression plate that is coupled, when in use, to the support plate 202 by magnetic attraction between complimentary portions of magnetic members 212. This is in contrast to the compression plate 204 that is coupled with the support plate 202 by both the hinge 210 pivo tally and the magnetic members 212 releasably. Use of a magnetic coupling mechanism to the exclusion of other techniques (e.g., absent a hinge or other mechanical fastener) provides greater flexibility and interchangeability of compression plates, in an exemplary aspect. As stated previously and as will be depicted in FIG. 3 representing a cross sectional view of the fixture 200 along cutline 3-3 hereinafter, the support plate 202 and the compression plate 208 (or any compression plate provided in FIG. 2) is effective to maintain a portion of an article there between such that the portion of the article may be processed in a manufacturing process. The use of at least the magnetic attraction between the complimentary portions of the magnetic members provides a compressive force between the support plate 202 and the compression plate 208 that is effective to secure and maintain the article, in an exemplary aspect. As will be discussed hereinafter, it is contemplated that any number of magnetic members 212 may be used in any combination at any location to accomplish advantages provided herein. For example, it is contemplated that any size of magnetic member formed from any suitable material may be position in any number at any location to effectively align and magnetically couple a support plate with a compression plate without the aid of additional mechanical fasteners or guides, in an exemplary aspect. Magnetic members, such as magnetic member 212, may be formed from any suitable material. For example, it is contemplated that the magnetic members are formed from a material exhibiting characteristics of a permanent magnet that creates a persistent magnetic field. FIG. 3 depicts a cross section of fixture 200 of FIG. 2 along cut line 3-3, in accordance with aspects hereof. As depicted, the support plate 202 may be formed having multiple layers, such as a bottom layer 203. However, while depicted as being formed from multiple layers to represent the concept of additive formation of the support plate, it is contemplated that instead the support plate is formed from a single material, a single layer, or other configuration in alternative aspects. Also depicted are the magnetic members 212 extending above the top surface of the compression plate 208, such that a flange portion of the magnetic members 212 is presented and resistive to a downward force toward the bottom surface. Also depicted is an exemplary article portion 302 for illustration purposes. While the article portion 302 is depicted, it is not limiting as to the scope contemplated. Similarly, the size and shape of features depicted with respect to the support plate 202 and the compression plate 208 are not intended as being limiting on to the scope. The article portion 302 is maintained between the bottom surface of the compression plate 208 and a top formed surface of the support plate, which in this case is represented as a top surface of portion 203. However, as previously discussed, it is contemplated that the support plate 202 is formed from a single material layer and therefore the material portion 302 may be compressed against a feature surface of the support plate 202. Further, while a single layer of the article portion 302 is depicted for illustrative purposes, it is contemplated that multiple layers and materials may be maintained within a working cavity formed between the support plate 202 and the compression plate(s), in exemplary aspects. Also depicted is the manufacturing void 214. The manufacturing void 214 extends through the compression plate 208 from the top surface to the bottom surface. The manufacturing void 214 may provide access to the article portion 302 allowing for a manufacturing process to be performed. For example, it is contemplated that a marking agent (e.g., painting apparatus) may apply a marking to a surface of the article portion 302 through the manufacturing void 214, in an exemplary aspect. As previously discussed, any manufacturing process may be performed within the manufacturing void and the manufacturing void may be configured to facilitate the desired manufacturing process. To this end, while a particular manufacturing void is depicted for exemplary purposes, it is contemplated that any number, configuration and position of a manufacturing void may be incorporated in exemplary aspects. For example, while not depicted, it is contemplated that the support plate 202 may also incorporate a coordinated manufacturing void to facilitate some manufacturing processes (e.g., stitching that requires a bottom finish from a bobbin). Stated differently, it is contemplated that a manufacturing void may be incorporated in any portion of a magnetic self-aligning fixture, such as the support plate. As previously discussed, while a particular configuration is illustrated in FIG. 3 for illustration purposes, it is contemplated that any configuration, number, and arrangement of components may be used to achieve a magnetic self-aligning manufacturing fixture. For example, different thicknesses of material at different locations forming different manufacturing cavities accessible from different manufacturing voids are contemplated. Therefore, the components depicted in FIG. 3 are representative to illustrate a potential relationship of components forming a magnetic self- aligning manufacturing fixture and are not intended to be limiting. FIG. 4 depicts a cross-section view 400 of a magnetic member as integrated into a support plate and a compression plate, in accordance with aspects hereof. The magnetic member is comprised of a magnetic concave member 402 and a complimentary magnetic convex member 404. The concave member 402 is securely maintained in the compression plate as the concave member 402 extends from a top surface 418 to a bottom surface 422 through an alignment socket. The convex member 404 is securely maintained in the support plate as the convex member extends through an alignment socket to extend beyond a top surface 416. In this example, the convex member 404 does not extend through the support plate to a bottom surface 420, but instead only extends from the top surface 416 towards the bottom surface 420 a depth provided by the alignment socket. The concave member 402 is comprised of a flange portion 412 and a spherical cap receiving portion 406. The flange portion 412 is optional in exemplary aspects. Instead, it is contemplated that a cross sectional in a plane defined by the top surface 418 may be consistent along a length of the concave member 402, in an exemplary aspect. However, in the presently illustrated aspect, the flange 412 is functional to prevent the movement of the concave member 402 through the compression plate toward the complimentary convex member 404. Stated differently, the flange 412 is configured to not extend through the alignment socket formed within the compression plate, which prevents the concave member 402 from becoming unsecured from the compression plate in the direction of the complimentary convex member 404. The convex member 404 is comprised of a spherical cap portion 408. A spherical cap may also be referred to as a spherical dome, a bullet nose, or defined as a spherical portion that lies above a plane. However, while the term "spherical" is used, it is contemplated that the term "spherical" cap portion includes geometrical formations that do not have a constant radius, such as an ellipsoid. As depicted, the spherical cap portion 408 extends from the support plate above the top surface 416. This portion that extends above the top surface 416 is configured to be received within the concave member 402 at the spherical cap receiving portion 406. Therefore, the spherical cap receiving portion 406 has a configuration (e.g., size, shape, position) that is suitable to receive the spherical cap portion 408 and to facilitate an effective magnetic coupling between the concave member 402 and the convex member 404. The configuration of the convex member 404 and the concave member 402 will be discussed in greater detail hereinafter at FIGs. 5-7. While structural configurations have been discussed for maintaining a member within an alignment socket (e.g., the flange 412), it is contemplated that one or more additional maintaining means may be implemented. For example, it is contemplated that an adhesive (e.g., cyanoacrylate) may be applied to one or more portions of an alignment socket and/or the magnetic member to secure the magnetic member within the alignment socket. Alternatively, it is contemplated that a magnetic member may be desired to be replaced or removed from a plate, such as the support plate. As a result, it is contemplated that an access aperture may be incorporated for those alignment sockets that fail to extend through the entire thickness of a plate. An exemplary aperture 424 is depicted as extending from the bottom surface 420 into the alignment socket configured for and maintaining the convex member 404. The aperture 424 is effective for a ram to be inserted into the alignment socket to aid in the dislodgment of the convex member 402. While the aperture 424 is depicted in association with the support plate and the convex member 404, it is contemplated that any combination of features may be implemented. The shape of the spherical cap 408 and the complimentary spherical cap receiving portion 406 aid in aligning the magnetic members in a desired relative position. This combination of geometries allows for a mechanical alignment that further enhances a magnetic alignment achieved through complimentary magnetic fields produced by the concave member 402 and the convex member 404. Therefore, the configuration from both a physical and a magnetic perspective both facilitate a self-aligning characteristic of the magnetic member which result in alignment of plate portions to which each of the magnetic members are securely coupled. Further, it is contemplated that the concave member 402 may have a flush surface 410 that coordinates with a flush surface 414 of the convex member 404 to further enhance the magnetic bonding and alignment through an increased surface area and geometry of the magnetic member contacting surfaces. FIG. 5 depicts a perspective of a magnetic member 500 comprised of a concave member 502 and a complimentary convex member 504, in accordance with aspects hereof. The magnetic member 500 may represent the magnetic member 212 of FIGs. 2 and 3 and/or the magnetic member of FIG. 4 in exemplary aspects hereof. The magnetic member 500 is configured both physically and magnetically to provide a self-aligning mating between the concave member 502 and the convex member 504. Self-alignment in this context relates to the relative position between the concave member 502 and the convex member 504 is repeatedly consistent when mating such that a reproducible mated position is achieved by the magnetic member 500 independent of additional outside forces or components. At least two factors allow for the self-alignment characteristic of the magnetic member 500. First, the physical configuration of the concave member 502 and the convex member 504 allow for self-alignment. In particular, the concave member 502 is comprised of a receiving portion (e.g., a female receptacle) that is configured to receive and coordinate physically with a protrusion (e.g., male protrusion) of the convex member 504. The protrusion of the convex member 504 is configured to extend into and coordinate physically with the receiving portion of the concave member 502. The receiving portion as depicted is a spherical cap receiving portion 506 and the protrusion is depicted as a spherical cap 508. In an exemplary aspect, the curved nature of the surfaces (either a constant surface curvature or a variable surface curvature) aids in ensuring a self-alignment as the concave member 502 and the convex member 504 are magnetically attracted and bonded to one another. Stated differently, the geometric coordination between the concave member 502 and the convex member 504 create a self-aligning mechanism as the magnetic attraction forces are translated into lateral position changes by the physical interaction of the members into a desired aligned position. While a generally curved geometry (e.g., spherical cap and spherical cap receiving portion) are depicted in exemplary aspects, additional configurations are contemplated. For example, it is contemplated that a pyramid shape may alternatively be implemented as a physical geometry that facilitates self-alignment. For example, it is contemplated that a magnetic concave member is comprised of a pyramid-like shape extending toward a magnetic concave member configured to receive the pyramid portion. In this example, the apex of the pyramid would be received in the convex receiving portion that has a coordinated pyramidal receiving shape, in an exemplary aspect. However, it is contemplated that a rounded apex portion may provide greater durability and longevity to the magnetic member, in exemplary aspects. As previously discussed, there are at least two factors that allow for the self- alignment characteristic of the magnetic member 500, the first discussed is the geometric configuration between the magnetic member portions. A second factor is the arrangement of magnetic fields in the concave member 502 and the convex member 504, which is generally depicted in FIGs. 6 and 7, respectively. In general, the magnetic polarity of the magnetic member portions are axially aligned with each other in an opposite polarity configuration that results in an attraction between the concave member 502 and the convex member 504. Axial alignment may be defined by axis that extends through the convex member 504 through an apex of the spherical cap 508 at a perpendicular angle to the spherical cap apex, in an exemplary aspect. Similarly, the axial alignment may be defined by an axis that extends through the concave member 502 through an apex of the spherical cap receiving portion 506 at a perpendicular angle to the spherical cap receiving portion 506, in an exemplary aspect. Axial alignment of the magnetic fields generated by the concave member 502 and the convex member 504 function to self-align the magnetic member 500 when in a magnetically coupled configuration. This self-alignment provides for a lateral alignment (e.g., alignment in a plane orthogonal to the axis). It is contemplated that in exemplary aspects that the use of geometric structures alone may be sufficient to achieve self-alignment. Further, it is contemplated that the use of axially aligned magnetic fields may alone be sufficient to achieve self-alignment, in an exemplary aspect. Therefore, any combination or individual configuration is contemplated as allowing for a self-aligning magnetic member, in exemplary aspects. FIG. 6 depicts a planar view of the concave member 502 from FIG. 5, in accordance with aspects hereof. An exemplary magnetic polarity of the concave member 502 is depicted by the "N" and the "S" indications indicating a north magnetic pole and a south magnetic pole, respectively. While a particular magnetic field orientation is depicted for illustration purposes, it is contemplated that any orientation may be implemented in exemplary aspects. The concave member 502 is comprised of a first portion 602 and a second portion 604. The first portion 602 may serve as a flange to aid in securing and preventing the passing of the concave member 502 through an alignment socket in an unintended direction. The second portion 604 is configured to be maintained securely within an alignment socket. As such as the first portion has a diameter 608 that mechanically is maintained within an alignment socket having a similar diameter with appropriate tolerance ranges. The second portion 604 also has a length 612 that is equivalent to the thickness of a plate from a top surface to a bottom surface, in an exemplary aspect. For example, it is contemplated that an alignment socket extending through a compression plate has a circular cross-section in a plane defined by a top surface of the compression plate, where the circular cross-section of the alignment socket has a diameter equivalent to diameter 608. In this same example, the alignment socket has a depth of the compression plate thickness that is equivalent to the length 612. The first portion 602 has a diameter 606. As the diameter 606 is greater than the diameter 608, which is configured to be equivalent to the alignment socket, the first portion 602 is sized so that it will not pass through the alignment socket, in an exemplary aspect. Stated differently, by having a larger diameter in the first portion 602, the concave member 502 is able to resist dislodgement from the alignment socket as a result of the magnetic attraction force applying a force through the alignment socket, in an exemplary aspect. The first portion 602 has a length 610, which may be altered depending on a desired amount of magnetic material and structural characteristics. FIG. 7 depicts a planar view of the convex member 504 from FIG. 5, in accordance with aspects hereof. An exemplary magnetic polarity of the convex member 504 is depicted by the "N" and the "S" indications indicating a north magnetic pole and a south magnetic pole, respectively. While a particular magnetic field orientation is depicted for illustration purposes, it is contemplated that any orientation may be implemented in exemplary aspects. The convex member 504 is comprised of a first portion 702 and the spherical cap 508 introduced in FIG. 5. The first portion 702 is configured to be received and securely maintained within an alignment socket of a plate. For example, the first portion may have a circular cross section in a plane defined by the plate top surface. The circular cross section has a diameter 704. The first portion also has a length 708. In an exemplary aspect, the alignment socket into which the convex portion 404 is securely maintained is configured to have a depth equivalent to length 708 extending from a first surface toward a second surface and a circular diameter equivalent to the diameter 704. By coordinating the alignment socket dimensions and the first portion 702, the convex member 504 is configured for the alignment socket to securely maintain the convex member 504. In an exemplary aspect, it is contemplated that the support plate has a thickness extending between the top surface and the bottom surface that is greater than the length 708 such that the convex member 504 does not extend through to the bottom surface. The greater thickness than length 708 may prevent the convex member 504 from contacting a working surface onto which the support plate is positioned, which may be magnetic and therefore interfere with manufacturing operations, in an exemplary aspect. The spherical cap 508 is formed having a spherical cap portion extending a length 710 above the first portion 702. As previously illustrated in FIG. 4, it is contemplated that the first portion 702 is maintained in a support plate flush with a top surface of the support plate. Therefore, the convex member 504 in general extends above the support plate top surface a height equivalent to the length 710, in an exemplary aspect. A total length 706 of the convex member 504 is formed by the first portion 702 and the spherical cap 508, in an exemplary aspect. FIGs. 8-10 depict a sequence of compression plate applications to a support plate using the self-aligning characteristics of universal magnetic members to achieve efficiencies in the sequence, in accordance with aspects hereof. FIG. 8 depicts a first configuration 800 comprised of a support plate 802 and a first compression plate 804 maintained by both a mechanical mechanism and a magnetic member 812, in accordance with aspects hereof. The support plate 802 is comprised of a manufacturing feature 806. The manufacturing feature 806 is a recessed cavity sized to receive and maintain an article portion 808, such as a portion of a shoe upper. The support plate 802 is further comprised of a plurality of alignment sockets each maintaining a magnetic member, such as a convex member 810. While a convex member 810 is depicted as being maintained within the support plate 802, it is contemplated that a concave member may alternatively (or additionally) be maintained in one or more alignment sockets of the support plate 802, in an exemplary aspect. The position of the alignment sockets within the support plate 802 are determined to allow the support plate 802 to magnetically couple with a variety of compression plates (as will be depicted in FIGs. 9 and 10) such that the support plate 802 and article portion 808 may be pared through a sequence of manufacturing processes while switching out compression plates to aid in each of the subsequent manufacturing processes. Therefore, the position of the alignment sockets maintaining magnetic members is universal, in an exemplary aspect, to allow for the interchanging of different compression plates to further achieve efficiencies in the manufacturing process. The compression plate 804 is depicted in this exemplary aspect as having a combination of a mechanical fastener, a hinge, and a magnetic member 812 to secure the compression plate 804 with the support plate 802. The compression plate 804 may be configured to remain magnetically coupled with the support plate 802 during a sequence of manufacturing processes that involve the exchanging of other compression plates (as will be illustrated in FIGs. 9 and 10). In this example, the compression plate 804 may be functional to maintain the article 808 within the manufacturing feature 806 while other compression plates are exchanged between different manufacturing processes. It is contemplated that the compression plate 804 is shaped to also universally coordinate with subsequently interchanged compression plates, in an exemplary aspect. This shaping may further aid in the alignment of a subsequently positioned compression plate. For example the edge or portion to which a subsequently positioned compression plate is proximate may be shaped, such as a male/female relationship to aid in the alignment of the subsequently positioned compression plate. While a specific configuration of various components are depicted in FIG. 8 for illustrative purposes, any combination of features having any number or configuration of features/components may be implemented within the scope of the aspects presented herein. FIG. 9 depicts a second configuration 900 of the support plate 802 having a second compression plate 902 magnetically coupled thereto, in accordance with aspects of the present invention. As depicted, the second compression plate 902 is coupled with the support plate 802 solely by a series of complimentary magnetic members, such as a magnetic member 912, that magnetically attract to a counterpart magnetic member of the support plate 802, such as the magnetic member 812 of FIG. 8. The second compression plate 902 self- aligns with the support plate 802 in this example by leveraging the magnetic configuration and geometric configuration of the magnetic member 912 (and magnetic member 812 of FIG. 8). Therefore, a human (or a machine) needs only to position the compression plate 902 in an approximately desired position relative to the support plate 802 in order for the magnetic member to self-align and magnetically secure the second compression plate 902 with the support plate 802. The second compression plate 902 is configured such that the magnetic member 912 is positioned in a location on the second compression plate 902 such that when the magnetic member 912 is attracted with the magnetic member 812 of FIG. 8, a manufacturing void through which the article 808 is accessible is positioned in an appropriate location on the article 808. As will be seen in FIG. 10, the manufacturing void, which provides access to the article for a manufacturing process through a plate, such as a compression plate, may be changed by switching out the compression plates magnetically coupled with the support plate, in an exemplary aspect. FIG. 10 depicts a third configuration 1000 with the support plate 802 magnetically coupled with a third compression plate 1002, in accordance with aspects hereof. The third compression plate 1002 is configured with magnetic members arranged to coordinate with complimentary magnetic members secured in the support plate 802. The magnetic member of the third compression plate 1002 are further arranged such that a manufacturing void is positioned in a desired location relative to the article 808 to facilitate an appropriate manufacturing process on the article 808. In this example, a magnetic member 1012 is configured to self- align with a complimentary magnetic member, such as the magnetic member 812 of FIG. 8. In the example of FIGs. 9 and 10, the first compression plate 804 remains magnetically coupled with the support plate 802 when both the second compression plate 902 and the third compression plate 1002 are magnetically coupled with the support plate 802. It is contemplated that the first compression plate 804 is effective for maintaining the article 808 in a desired position relative to the support plate 802 during the transition from the second compression plate 902 to the third compression plate 1002. The various configurations depicted in FIGs. 8-10 are illustrative in nature and not intended to be limiting. It is contemplated that any number of magnetic members may be positioned in an arrangement and having any characteristic that achieves aspects provided herein. Further, it is contemplated that the manufacturing voids through the compression plate which the article is accessible may be of any size, shape, and location that is suitable for performing a desired manufacturing process. The size, shape, and features of the support plate may be of any size, shape and combination of features that facilitate aspects provided herein. FIG. 11 depicts a block diagram illustrating a method 1100 for using a magnetic self-aligning fixture in a manufacturing process, in accordance with aspects hereof. At a block 1102, a step of positioning an article in a manufacturing feature of a support plate is represented. For example, it is contemplated that a portion of an article of footwear is placed in a recessed portion of a support plate, such that the recessed portion is configured to have a depth and size for securing the portion of the article of footwear. The support plate is comprised of one or more magnetic members, such as a convex magnetic member. The magnetic member having a particular magnetic field configuration that facilitates self- aligning of a complimentary magnetic member that is secured within a compression plate to be secured thereto the support plate. At a block 1104, a step of magnetically securing a first compression plate to the support plate is represented. The support plate and the first compression plate secure the article there between. The first compression plate has a magnetic member that is configured to self-align and attract to the magnetic member of the support plate. Further, the magnetic member is positioned within the first compression plate such that a manufacturing void of the first compression plate is positioned at a location of the article that is intended for a manufacturing operation to be performed. At a block 1106, a step of performing a manufacturing process on the article as secured by the support plate and the first compression plate is represented. As previously discussed, the manufacturing process may be any process, such as sewing, embroidering, painting, spraying, printing, welding, bonding, tacking, cutting, punching, embossing, and the like. This manufacturing process may leverage an opening in the compression plate that allows a manufacturing apparatus (or human) to access the desired portion of the article for performing the manufacturing process. At a block 1108, a step of removing the first compression plate from the support plate is represented. In this step, the first compression plate is physically separated from the support plate by a sufficient distance to overcome the magnetic attraction between the complimentary magnetic members. It is contemplated that the article remains positioned in the manufacturing feature of the support plate following the removal of the first compression plate. At a block 1110, a step of magnetically securing a second compression plate to the support plate is represented. The second compression plate is comprised of one or more magnetic members that correspond with and compliment one or more magnetic members of the support plate such that the second compression plate self-aligns and magnetically couples with the support plate. The position of the magnetic members in the second compression plate are arranged such that a manufacturing void is positioned at a desired location on the article as maintained between the support plate and the compression plate. It is contemplated that additional portions of the article (e.g., additional piece of upper material) may be placed on the article prior to securing the second compression plate to the support plate. In this example, the second article material may be process in combination (or independently) of the article positioned in block 1102. At a block 1112, a step of performing a second manufacturing process on the article is represented. The second manufacturing process may be the same as performed at block 1106; however, it may be performed at a different location or on a different material combination. In this example, the article is maintained in a common support plate having defined magnetic member configurations and multiple operations are performed on the article using different compression plates. The method 1100 is exemplary in nature and not intended to be limited as to the scope provided herein. For example, one or more steps may be omitted or rearranged in ordering. Further, it is contemplated that additional steps may be inserted in exemplary aspect.
