IMPROVED PROCESSES FOR THE PREPARATION OF DABIGATRAN ETEXILATE USING NOVEL INTERMEDIATES FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to novel, commercially viable and industrially advantageous processes for the preparation of Dabigatran or a salt thereof, in high yield and purity, using novel intermediates. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION U.S. Patent No. 6,087,380 (hereinafter referred to as the US'380 patent) discloses a variety of disubstituted bicyclic heterocycle derivatives and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, processes for their preparation, pharmaceutical compositions comprising the derivatives, and methods of use thereof. These compounds have valuable pharmacological properties, particularly a thrombin-inhibiting activity and the effect of extending thrombin time, and are useful for the prophylaxis or treatment of venous and arterial thrombotic diseases such as deep leg vein thrombosis, reocclusion after a bypass operation or angioplasty, occlusion in peripheral arterial disease, pulmonary embolism, disseminated intravascular coagulation, coronary thrombosis, stroke, and the occlusion of a shunt or stent. Among them, Dabigatran etexilate mesylate, chemically named ethyl 3-[[[2- [ [ [4- [[ [(hexyloxy)carbonyl] amino] iminomethyljphenyl] aminojmethyl] - 1 -methyl- 1 H- benzimidazol-5-yl]carbonyl](pyridin-2-yl)amino]propanoate mesylate salt, is a direct thrombin inhibitor indicated to reduce the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF). Dabigatran etexilate mesylate is represented by the following structural formula: Dabigatran etexilate mesylate is marketed by Boehringer Ingelheim under the brand name PRADAXA®, and it is orally administered as capsules containing 75 mg and 150 mg of Dabigatran etexilate mesylate. The synthesis of Dabigatran etexilate was first described in the US 6087380. Various processes for the preparation of Dabigatran etexilate, its intermediates, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof are apparently described in U.S. Patent Nos. US 7202368, US 7932273, US 81 19810, US 8394961, US8394962, US 8399678, US 8471033; U.S. Patent Application Publications US 2006/0276513, US 2009/0042948, US2010/0087488, US 2013/1 16440 and US 2013/1 16441 ; PCT Patent Publications WO 2008/059029, WO 2009/1 1 1997, WO 2010/045900, WO 201 1/1 10876, WO 201 1/061080, WO 2012/004396, WO 2012/004397, WO 2012/044595, WO 2012/077136, WO 2012/152855, WO 2012/153158 and WO 2013/144903; and Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, 2002, 45(9), 1757-1766. As per the process exemplified in Example 59, in an analogous manner to examples 25 & 26, of the US '380 patent, Dabigatran, chemically named l-methyl-2-[N-(4- amidinophenyl)-aminomethyl]-benzimidazol-5-yl-carboxylic acid-N-(2-pyridyl)-N-(2- ethoxycarbonylethyl)-amide is prepared by the following sequence of reaction steps: a) 4-methylamino-3-nitro-benzoic acid chloride is reacted with N-(2- ethoxycarbonylethyl)-2-pyridylamine in the presence of triethylamine in tetrahydrofuran solvent to produce 4-methylamino-3-nitro-benzoic acid-N-(2-pyridyl)- N-(2-ethoxycarbonylethyl)-amide intermediate; b) the nitro-compound obtained in step-(a) is then hydrogenated in ethanol and dichloromethane in the presence of palladium/charcoal to produce 3-amino-4- methylamino-benzoic acid-N-(2-pyridyl)-N-(2-ethoxycarbonylethyl)-amide; c) the amino-compound obtained in step-(b) is then condensed with N-(4-cyanophenyl)- glycine in the presence of Ν,Ν'-carbonyldiimidazole in tetrahydrofuran to produce a reaction mass, followed by treating with glacial acetic acid and then subjecting to usual work up methods and column chromatographic purifications to produce 1 -methyl -2- [N-(4-cyanophenyl)-aminomethyl]-benzimidazole-5-yl-carboxylic acid-N-(2-pyridyl)- N-(2-ethoxycarbonylethyl)-amide (hereinafter referred to as the cyano-benzimidazole intermediate); d) the cyano-benzimidazole intermediate obtained in step-(c) is then reacted with saturated ethanolic hydrochloric acid and subsequently with ammonium carbonate followed by usual work up and column chromatographic purifications to produce Dabigatran hydrochloride, which is then treated with sodium hydroxide to produce Dabigatran. The synthetic route of Dabigatran as described in the US '380 patent is shown in the below scheme- 1 : Scheme-1 : N-(2-Ethoxycarbonylethyt)- 4-Methylamino-3-nitro- 2-pyridylamine benzoic acid chloride 4- ethylamino-3-nitro benzoic acid-N-(2- Tetrahydrofuran 3-Amino-4-methylamino-benzoic acid- Acetic acid 1-Methyl-2-[N-(4-cyanophenyl)-aminomethyl]- N-(2-pyridyl)-N-(2-ethoxycarbonylethyl) benzimidazol-5-yl-carboxylic acid-N-(2-pyridyl)- -amide N-(2-ethoxycarbonylethyl)-amide Ethanolic HCI (NH4)2C0, Dabigatran Dabigatran Hydrochloride n-Hexylchloroformate Potassium carbonate Dabigatran etexilate As per the process exemplified in Example 113 of the US '380 patent, l-methyl-2- [N-(4-(N-n-hexyloxycarbonylamidino)phenyl)-aminomethyl]-benzimidazol-5-yl- carboxylic acid-N-(2-pyridyl)-N-(2-ethoxycarbonylethyl)-amide (Dabigatran Etexilate) is prepared, analogously to the example 90, by reacting l-methyl-2-[N-(4-amidinophenyl)- aminomethyl]-benzimidazol-5-yl-carboxylic acid-N-(2-pyridyl)-N-(2-ethoxycarbonyl ethyl)-amide hydrochloride salt (Dabigatran hydrochloride) with n-hexyl chloroformate in the presence of potassium carbonate in a solvent medium comprising tetrahydrofuran and water, followed by isolation using column chromatography to produce Dabigatran etexilate. The processes for the preparation of Dabigatran, pharmaceutically acceptable salts and derivatives thereof as described in the aforementioned prior art suffer from several disadvantages such as the use of highly flammable solvents like tetrahydrofuran; use of expensive column chromatographic purifications; use' of excessive amounts of corrosive organic acids like acetic acid; use of multiple solvents and in excess amounts; and use of tedious and cumbersome procedures like prolonged reaction time periods, multiple distillations and extractions, multiple isolations/re-crystallizations, and thus resulting in a poor product yield and quality. Methods involving column chromatographic purifications are generally undesirable for large-scale operations, thereby making the process commercially unfeasible. For example, the preparation of l-methyl-2-[N-(4-cyanophenyl)-aminomethyl]- benzimidazole-5-yl-carboxylic acid-N-(2-pyridyl)-N-(2-ethoxycarbonylethyl)-amide as described in the prior art involves the use of 15 volumes of acetic acid with respect to 3- amino-4-methylamino-benzoic acid-N-(2-pyridyl)-N-(2-ethoxycarbonylethyl)-amide, whereas the process of the present invention requires the use of 0.25 to 0.3 volumes of acetic acid. The most important reaction step in the synthesis of Dabigatran as reported in the aforesaid prior art is the condensation reaction between 3-amino-4-methylamino-benzoic acid-N-(2-pyridyl)-N-(2-ethoxycarbonylethyl)-amide and N-(4-cyanophenyl)-glycine in the presence of Ν,Ν'-carbonyldiimidazole to produce the corresponding cyano- benzimidazole intermediate "l-methyl-2-[N-(4-cyanophenyl)-aminomethyl]- benzimidazole-5-yl-carboxylic acid-N-(2-pyridyl)-N-(2-ethoxycarbonylethyl)-amide". The major drawback of this condensation step is that the purity of the resulting cyano- benzimidazole intermediate obtained by the prior art process is below 50% (measured by HPLC), which intern requires multiple purification steps thereby leading to the poor product yields (i.e. below about 30%). The cyano-benzimidazole intermediate obtained by the processes described in the prior art does not have satisfactory purity (Purity by HPLC: 50%) since unacceptable amounts of impurities are formed during the condensation reaction between 3-amino-4- methylamino-benzoic acid-N-(2-pyridyl)-N-(2-ethoxycarbonylethyl)-amide and N-(4- cyanophenyl)-glycine in the presence of Ν,Ν'-carbonyldiimidazole, which are persistent impurities and cannot be removed completely. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present inventors have surprisingly and unexpectedly found that l-methyl-2- [N-(4-cyanophenyl)-aminomethyl]-benzimidazole-5-yl-carboxylic acid-N-(2-pyridyl)-N- (2-ethoxycarbonylethyl)-amide, which is a key intermediate in the synthesis of Dabigatran, can be prepared advantageously with high purity and with high yield, by reacting N-(4- Cyanophenyl)- glycine with Carbonyldiimidazole to produce a novel intermediate compound 4-(2-imidazol-l-yl-2-oxo-ethylamino)-benzonitrile, which is then reacted with 3-Amino-4-methylamino-benzoic acid-N-(2-pyridyl)-N-(2-ethoxycarbonylethyl)-amide to produce a novel intermediate compound 3-Amino-4-[N-[2-(4-cyano-phenylamino)acetyl]- N-methyl] amino] -benzoic acid-N-(2-pyridyl)-N-(2-ethoxycarbonylethyl)-amide, followed by treating with a suitable reagent to produce l-methyl-2-[N-(4-cyanophenyl)- aminomethyl] -benzimidazole-5 -yl-carboxylic acid-N-(2-pyridyl)-N-(2-ethoxycarbonyl ethyl)-amide. The novel process solves the drawbacks associated with the prior processes and is commercially viable for preparing Dabigatran and its salts or derivatives thereof. The present inventors have further surprisingly and unexpectedly found that Dabigatran or a salt or a derivative thereof can be prepared, in high purity and with high yield, by reacting N-(4-Cyanophenyl)-glycine with Carbonyldiimidazole to produce a novel intermediate compound 4-(2-imidazol-l-yl-2-oxo-ethylamino)-benzonitrile, which is then reacted with 3-Amino-4-methylamino-benzoic acid-N-(2-pyridyl)-N-(2- ethoxycarbonylethyl)-amide to produce a novel intermediate compound 3-Amino-4-[N-[2- (4-cyano-phenylamino)acetyl]-N-methyl]amino]-benzoic acid-N-(2-pyridyl)-N-(2- ethoxycarbonylethyl)-amide, followed by converting it into Dabigatran or salt or a derivative thereof. In one aspect, provided herein are efficient, industrially advantageous and environmentally friendly processes for the preparation of Dabigatran and its key intermediates l-methyl-2-[N-(4-cyanophenyl)-aminomethyl]-benzimidazole-5-yl- carboxylic acid-N-(2-pyridyl)-N-(2-ethoxycarbonylethyl)-amide, in high yield and with high purity using novel intermediate compounds.

In another aspect, provided herein is a novel intermediate compound, 3-Amino-4- [ -[2-(4-ethoxyimidoyl-phenylamino)acetyl]-N-methyl] amino] -benzoic acid-N-(2- pyridyl)-N-(2-ethoxycarbonylethyl)-amide hydrochloride salt of formula IV: In another aspect, provided herein is a novel intermediate compound, 3-Amino-4- [N-[2-(4-amidino-phenylamino)acetyl]-N-methyl]amino]-benzoic acid-N-(2-pyridyl)-N- (2-ethoxycarbonylethyl)-amide, of formula Va: or an acid addition salt thereof. In another aspect, provided herein is a novel intermediate compound, 3-Amino-4- [N- [2- [(4-N-n-hexyloxycarbonylamidino) phenylamino] acetyl] -N-methyl] amino] -benzoic acid-N-(2-pyridyl)-N-(2-ethoxycarbonylethyl)-amide, of formula VI: or an acid addition salt thereof. The processes for the preparation of Dabigatran and its intermediates disclosed herein have the following advantages over the processes described in the prior art: i) the process involves the use of novel intermediate compounds; ii) the overall yield of the Dabigatran and its intermediates is increased and the purity of the product is increased without additional purifications such as multiple isolations and column chromatographic purifications; iii) the process avoids the use of highly flammable solvents like tetrahydrofuran; iv) the process avoids the use of excessive amounts of corrosive organic acids like acetic acid and toluenesulfonic acid; v) the process avoids the use of additional and excess amounts of solvents, multiple isolation steps, column chromatographic purifications; vi) the processes involve easy work-up methods and simple isolation processes, and there is a reduction in chemical waste.

The resulting solid was dissolved in dichloromethane (1000 ml) and the resulting organic layer was washed two times with 10% potassium carbonate solution (500 ml x 2). The resulting organic layer was then washed with 20% sodium chloride solution, followed by distillation under vacuum to produce 3-Amino-4-[N-[2-[(4-N-n-hexyloxycarbonylamidino) phenylamino] acetyl] -N-methyl] amino] -benzoic acid-N-(2-pyridyl)-N-(2-ethoxy carbonylethyl)-amide. Step-2: Dabigatran Etexilate Dichloromethane (550 ml) was added to 3-Amino-4-[N-[2-[(4-N-n-hexyloxycarbonyl amidino)phenylamino]acetyl]-N-methyl]amino]-benzoic acid-N-(2-pyridyl)-N-(2- ethoxycarbonylethyl)-amide (obtained in step-1) at 25-30°C. The resulting mass was heated to reflux and then stirred for 10-15 minutes at reflux while removing the collected water through Dean-Stark apparatus. Acetic acid (15 ml) was added to the reaction mass at reflux and then stirred for 4 to 5 hours at reflux. After completion of the reaction the reaction mass was cooled to room temperature and then water (250 ml) was added to the mass at the same temperature. The resulting mass was further cooled to 10-15°C, followed by adjusting the pH of the mass to 8-9 with potassium carbonate. The aqueous layer was separated and the organic layer was washed with water (200 ml), followed by distillation of dichloromethane solvent under vacuum at 50°C to produce 50 gm of Dabigatran Etexilate.
