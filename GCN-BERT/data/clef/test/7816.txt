The present invention relates to a composition comprising (A) an isocyanate of formula (I) OCN-A-SiR1R2R3 (I), wherein A is straight-chain, branched, substituted and/or unsubstituted aliphatic hydrocarbyl of 1 to 12 carbon atoms or substituted or unsubstituted cycloaliphatic hydrocarbyl of 4 to 18 carbon atoms, wherein R1 is selected from the group comprising —O—Ralk, wherein R2 and R3 are each independently selected from the group of substituents comprising —Ralk and —O—Ralk, and wherein —Ralk is hydrocarbyl of 1 to 6 carbon atoms, and B) a Bronstedt or Lewis acid or a compound which releases a Bronstedt or Lewis acid at room temperature; and also to a process for producing a stabilized alkoxysilane-containing isocyanate comprising the step of adding a Lewis or Bronstedt acid or a compound which releases a Bronstedt or Lewis acid at room temperature to an alkoxysilane-containing isocyanate. Alkoxysilane-containing isocyanates are useful chemical compounds which facilitate the goal-directed construction of polymers which in the form of silane-containing polycarbamates or silane-containing polyureas, find diverse industrial use in foams, elastomers, thermoplastics, fibres, photostable polycarbamate coatings or adhesives. The synthesis of isocyanates can take a number of different routes. The oldest and still predominant process for producing isocyanates on a large industrial scale involves phosgenation of the corresponding amines by use of phosgene, which is corrosive, highly toxic and contains a high proportion of chlorine and so is very costly and inconvenient to handle on an industrial scale. A series of unwanted chlorinated by-products are formed in this process in addition to the target products. There are several processes which can be used to avoid the use of phosgene in the production of isocyanates on the industrial scale. The term “phosgene-free process” is frequently used in connection with the conversion of amines into isocyanates by use of alternative carbonylating agents, for example urea or dialkyl carbonate (EP 18 586, EP 355 443, U.S. Pat. No. 4,268,683, EP 990 644). The so-called urea route is based on the urea-mediated conversion of amines into isocyanates via a two-step process. In the first step of the process, an amine is reacted with alcohol in the presence of urea or urea equivalents (e.g. alkyl carbonates, alkyl carbamates) to form a biscarbamate which is typically subjected to an intervening purification before being thermally cracked into isocyanate and alcohol in the second step of the process (EP 126 299, EP 126,300, EP 355 443, U.S. Pat. No. 4,713,476, U.S. Pat. No. 5,386,053). Alternatively, the actual process of carbamate formation can also be preceded by the separate production of a urea by deliberately reacting the amine with urea (EP 568 782). A two-step sequence comprising a partial reaction of urea with alcohol in the first and subsequent metered addition and carbamatization of the amine in the second step is also conceivable (EP 657 420). The thermal cracking of carbamates can take place in the gas phase or in the liquid phase, with or without solvents and with or without catalysts. EP 126 299 and EP 126 300 describe processes for preparing hexamethylene diisocyanate and isophorone diisocyanate, respectively, by cracking the corresponding biscarbamates in the gas phase in a tubular reactor in the presence of metallic packing elements at 410° C. The preparation of carbamates from an amine, urea and alcohol in a one-pot reaction with concurrent removal of ammonia is known from EP 18 568. The teaching of EP 18 568 was further developed and is described in EP 126 299, EP 126 300, EP 355 443, EP 566 925 and EP 568 782. Newer processes for preparing isocyanates are known from EP1512681, EP1512682, EP1512680, EP1593669, EP1602643, EP1634868, EP 2091911. The reaction via the urea route, both in the synthesis of carbamates in one, two or else alternatively more steps and in the subsequent thermal cracking of the carbamates into isocyanates, leads to the formation of unwanted by-products, for example tertiary amines. It transpires that the by-products from the urea route affect the storage stability of the resultant alkoxy-silane-containing isocyanates to a considerable degree. In particular, the NCO content of the alkoxysilane-containing isocyanates shows a relative decline of up to 75° 15 in the course of 4 weeks of storage at 50° C. U.S. Pat. No. 7,060,849 B1 discloses the cracking of alkoxy-containing carbamates into alkoxy-containing isocyanates by neutralizing the catalyst with halogen-containing substances in order that unwanted trimerizates during the process may be avoided. However, there is nothing therein to suggest that these or other substances be added to the end product. Nor is the storage stability of the end product either tested or mentioned therein. The problem addressed by the invention is that of using a phosgene-free process to provide novel compositions which avoid the abovementioned disadvantages and, more particularly, incur a relative NCO content loss of less than 25% in the course of four weeks of storage at 50° C. The problem addressed by the present invention is further that of providing a process for phosgene-free preparation of stabilized compositions comprising alkoxysilane-containing isocyanates, especially to the effect that the loss of reactive NCO groups and/or the formation of disruptive by-products such as oligomers of the isocyanates is minimized.

The inventors of the present invention found that acidic stabilizers surprisingly increase the storage stability of alkoxysilane-containing isocyanates obtained by a phosgene-free process in that the concentration of the reactive NCO groups of the isocyanates decreases distinctly more slowly in the presence of said stabilizers.

The polyesters are obtainable in a conventional manner by condensation in an inert gas atmosphere at temperatures of 100 to 260° C., preferably 130 to 220° C., in the melt or in azeotropic mode, as described for example in Methoden der Organischen Chemie (Houben-Weyl); volume 14/2, pages 1 to 5, 21 to 23, 40 to 44, Georg Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart, 1963, or in C. R. Martens, Alkyd Resins, pages 51 to 59, Reinhold Plastics Appl. Series, Reinhold Publishing Comp., New York, 1961. It is likewise possible to use OH-containing (meth)acrylates and poly(meth)acrylates with preference. They are prepared by the co-polymerization of (meth)acrylates, wherein some components bear OH groups, others do not. This produces a random OH-containing polymer bearing no, one or many OH groups. Polymers of this type are described in High solids hydroxy acrylics with tightly controlled molecular weight. van Leeuwen, Ben. SC Johnson Polymer, Neth.

Any desired combinations of compounds C) can be used. The present invention is further illustrated by the following figures and non-limiting examples whence further features, embodiments, aspects and advantages of the present invention are derivable. EXAMPLES Example 1 Preparation of Alkoxysilane-Containing Isocyanates by the Urea Route Preparation of isocyanatopropyltrimethoxysilane (IPMS) from aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (AMMO) and urea in the presence of methanol. The uppermost tray of a pressure distillation reactor had applied to it an hourly feed of 360.2 g of AMMO, 127.9 g of urea melt and 386.2 g of methanol and the reaction mixture was boiled at 11-14 bar, 180° C. for an average residence time of 12.5 h with continuous removal of freed ammonia. The reactor effluent was freed of excess alcohol, low boilers and medium boilers in a flash container, together with the stream from the reurethanization stage, at 120° C. and 300 mbar and subsequent thin-film evaporation at 130° C. and 10 mbar. The crude IPMU thus obtained was subsequently separated in a short-path evaporator at 180° C. and a pressure of 0.1 mbar into a useful-product stream (IPMU) and a high-boiler stream. 407 g/h of IPMU were fed continuously into the circulation system of the falling film evaporator of the cracker and rectifier column, and the deblocking reaction was performed at a temperature of 195° C. and a pot pressure of 75 mbar in the presence of a steady-state concentration of tin dichloride at 50 ppm. The cracker gases IPMS and methanol were condensed out in two serially connected condensers at 85° C. and −25° C. The crude approximately 93% strength IPMS obtained was fed into a final distillation stage where 330 g/h of IPMS having a purity of >98.5% were obtained, which corresponds to a yield of 92%. 44 g/h of methanol were obtained as head product of the cracker and rectifier column. To maintain constant mass within the cracker and rectifier column and prevent deposits in and blockages of the cracker apparatus, a purge stream was continuously exported out of the circulation system and combined with 33.1 g/h of bottom product from the final IPMS distillation and the head product of the cracker and rectifier column, and the reurethanized stream was fed into the flash evaporation of the first step. Example 2 Production of Storage-Stable Compositions and Measurements of Storage Stability The product of Example 1 (NCO content: 20.16 wt %) was stored at 50° C. for four weeks. Thereafter, the NCO content was 14.30 wt %. This corresponds to a relative NCO loss of 29%. When 0.1 wt % of benzoyl chloride was added to the product of Example 1, by contrast, the NCO content only dropped to 19.25 wt % in the course of the four weeks at 50° C. This corresponds to a relative NCO loss of 4.5%. When instead of the benzoyl chloride the same amount of succinic acid was used, the NCO content dropped to 18.34 wt % in the course of storage (relative loss, 9.0%). The stabilizer-containing compositions are thus significantly more stable in storage than the initial product. 1.
