FIELD OF THE INVENTION The invention herein resides generally in the art of balloon inflation devices. More particularly, the present invention relates to a balloon inflation device that avoids over inflation problems of the prior art. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The prior art has provided balloon inflation devices for filling balloons using pressurized gas sources, the gas typically being air or, if it is desired that the balloon float, lighter-than-air gases, like helium. These devices have been provided not only to facilitate the production of filled balloons but also to avoid some of the inherent dangers involved in using a pressurized gas to inflate balloons. Typically, trained personnel are required to operate balloon inflation devices that employ pressurized gas. Employing such personnel is an added expense of providing inflated balloons, and it is therefore desirable to provide a balloon inflation device that can be safely used by the average consumer. U.S. Pat. No. 5,653,272 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,651,402 disclosed devices that prevent access to the pressurized gas supply by retaining a majority of the inflation device components inside a cabinet, and by assuring that a balloon placed on the inflation nozzle of the device is not inflated (i.e., pressurized gas is not released) until the cabinet is closed. These prior art inflation devices also divert a portion of the pressurized gas supply to activate a clamping mechanism for clamping the neck of the balloon over the inflation nozzle. These utilitarian aspects, while overcoming some of the inherent problems in balloon inflation as mentioned above, are not time efficient in use, and are more complicated in construction than is necessary. The consumers perceive these devices as being complicated and are thus less likely to desire to use them. U.S. Pat. No. 6,634,394 teaches an improved design for a balloon inflation device wherein a consumer physically manipulates a slide valve that is associated with an inflation nozzle, sealing the balloon neck around the inflation nozzle by squeezing the neck against a collar with his fingers, and pushing on the collar to open the slide valve to the flow of pressurized gas. U.S. Pat. No. 7,147,016 provides a balloon inflation device building upon the device disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,634,394 by including a keying system to ensure proper use of the device and by including a clamp mechanism to squeeze the neck of the balloon against the inflation nozzle. Other advancements are made as well regarding the gas flow. The above balloon inflation devices are useful and have served the industry well, but they are based on there is a need in the art for inflation devices that use the pressurized gas more efficiently, with significantly decreased opportunity for wasting the gas. This is especially important in the area of helium balloons. Helium is very expensive, and is likely to become more expensive as other industries, such as the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) industry, compete for the limited supply. The balloon industry is significantly affected, and the need is significant. The prior art in balloon inflators rely upon low pressure regulators to avoid overfilling of balloons. Current “Low Pressure Regulators” (LPR) are often said to be auto-shut-off devices, but this is only true in a fashion. A traditional LPR consists of a spring and diaphragm assembly. It functions by using the back pressure in the balloon to compress the spring and stop the flow of gas. The caveat to this is that the pressure to which the inflator fills the balloon by use of a LPR is often sufficient to stretch the film that forms the balloon. This stretching causes the pressure to drop, restarting the flow of gas through the LPR. When stretched, the balloon receives more gas, which is wasteful, and, depending on the balloon shape, size and material this can continue to the point of catastrophic failure, resulting a popped balloon. It takes an experienced and attentive operator to visually recognize the limits of the balloon and stop the filling process before stretching occurs. It also requires an operator that is knowledgeable enough to recognize the overfilling/stretching problem. There is a need in the art for precise control of balloon inflation, the avoidance of waste and overfilling and bursting of balloons, and the need is particularly hard felt in the helium or lighter-than-air balloon filling arts. The present invention fills this need, building upon the inflation devices in U.S. Pat. No. 7,147,016 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,634,394.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS The present invention is disclosed by focusing on the specific advances made by the present invention. Specific structures and options with respect to implementing the present invention in a finished inflation device will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art. Specific structures and options can also be taken from disclosures provided by U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,653,272, 5,651,402, 7,147,016 and 6,634,394, such disclosures having been provided by one or more of the present inventors. With reference to FIG. 1, it can be seen that an embodiment of a balloon inflation device according to the present invention is designated generally by the numeral 10. The balloon inflation device 10 is used to fill a balloon B with gas from a pressurized gas source 12. An on/off valve 14 controls the flow of gas G within the pressurized gas source 12 through a gas feed line 16. The on/off valve 14 has an “on” state and an “off” state, wherein gas G from the pressurized gas source 12 flows through the gas feed line 16 to an inflation nozzle 18 when in the “on” state and is prevented from flowing through the gas feed line in the “off” state. In particular embodiments, a low-pressure regulator 20 may be employed at some point along the gas feed line to reduce the pressure of the gas, as generally known. The inflation nozzle 18 includes a fill nozzle 22 that receives gas G from the gas feed line 16, as generally appreciated from the passage at the elbow in the inflation nozzle 18. A pressure sensor nozzle 24 is positioned inside the fill nozzle 22. The fill nozzle 22 has an outlet end 26 and is of a length suitable for receiving the neck N of a balloon B such that the outlet end 26 is positioned to introduce gas into the balloon B. in some embodiments, the fill nozzle 22 will be of a length suitable to pass any sealing valve 28 in the neck N of the balloon B. The pressure sensor nozzle 24 has an inlet end 30 is positioned proximate the outlet end 26 of the fill nozzle 22. The pressure sensor nozzle 24 provides fluid communication between the interior of the balloon and a pressure sensor 32 such that the back pressure within the balloon B impacts the pressure sensor 32. When the pressure impacting the pressure sensor hits a desired threshold, the on/off valve 14 is switched to its “off” state. In some embodiments, the pressure sensor 32 can be selected from pneumatic and electronic components. An exemplary pneumatic component would be an air logic circuit. An exemplary electronic component would be a pressure transducer, which is the focus of the particular embodiments described herein. In a particular embodiment, the pressure sensor 32 is a pressure transducer that converts the pressure to an analog electrical signal. This signal is output to a processor 34, as indicated at a line of communication 36. The processor communicates with the on/off valve 14, as indicated at a line of communication 38. As the pressure transducer is affected by the pressure of the gas within the balloon, as received at the inlet end 30 of the pressure sensor nozzle 24, it outputs a signal ultimately received by the processor 34, and, when a threshold pressure is reached, the processor 34 turns the on/off valve 14 to its “off” state. A fill switch 36 also communicates with the processor 34 such that, when the fill switch 36 is actuated, the processor places the on/off valve in the “on” state. Thus, to fill a balloon, the neck N of a balloon B is fitted over the fill nozzle 22 and the fill switch 36 is actuated. This opens the communication between the pressurized gas source 12 and the inflation nozzle 18 (more particularly fill nozzle 22) by placing the on/off valve 14 in the “on” state. Gas flows into the balloon B as at arrow A, and the balloon is filled. As the pressure builds in the balloon, the pressure sensor nozzle 24 communicates with the pressure sensor 32 (in this case a pressure transducer), and, as noted above, when a threshold pressure is established in the balloon B, the processor 34 serves to immediately place the on/off valve 14 in the “off” state, thus preventing further gas flow into the balloon B. In some embodiments, at this stage, where the processor 34 has placed the on/off valve in the “off” state in light of the pressure indicated by the pressure transducer, the gas G cannot be caused to flow again without actuating the fill switch 40. In some embodiments, the “on” and “off” state of the on/off valve 14 is a solenoid valve. It will be appreciated that the pressure transducer works quickly to provide the signal to the processor 34 as a result of the air pressure experienced. Thus, stretching of the balloon, as noted in the Background section above, is prevented or at least significantly reduced inasmuch as the system shuts off when a desired pressure is reached. Additionally, the switch is fast enough that the flow rate of the gas through the gas feed line 16 can be increased over prior systems. The present invention provides a balloon inflation device that is much more accurate and efficient than prior systems based on low pressure regulators and experienced operators. The prior art relies on the operator to fully terminate the flow of gas. A low pressure regulator will continue to deliver gas if the internal pressure lowers for any reason, film stretch, leakage around the nozzle, etc. Where the prior art low pressure regulators regulate the flow by being set to only permit flow at a desired low pressure, and hence their pressure and flow rate is very low, the present invention can allow flow at much higher pressures and flow rates because, instead of regulating the flow, the present invention simply shuts off flow when a desired pressure is reached. The present invention can be used to inflate balloons with air (or lighter than air gas such as helium) at rates faster than the prior art systems. In some embodiments, the present invention allows inflation at pressures only regulated down to 90 psi, and can yet stop inflation at a desired pressure, even as low as 0.5 to 2 psi. In other instances, the present invention allows inflation at pressures only regulated down to 90 psi, and can yet stop inflation at a desired pressure, even as low as 0.8 to 1.5 psi. The target pressure for a balloon, particularly foil-type helium filled balloons, has traditionally been about 1 psi. There are instances with small balloon and/or high altitudes where it's desirable to over inflate them in order to stretch the balloon, increase the internal volume and get more lift. The present invention can operate efficiently and safely within suitable pressure ranges. In some embodiments, the signal generated by the pressure transducer is biased by a digitally controlled potentiometer that is controlled by the processor 34. In some embodiments, a printed circuit board of the processor 34 has a 10-position rotary DIP switch to select one of 10 pressure settings. Thus, depending on altitude, balloon size, balloon material, and the like, the pressure can be selected with an operator-selectable device. In some embodiments, there is a built-in calibration routine. First, upon activating the calibration routine, the processor 34 reads a zero pressure and stores that value to EPROM. Next, the operator applies a 1 psi pressure to the unit and presses a button so that the processor 34 calculates the factors and offsets and stores that value in EPROM as well. In some embodiments, the balloon inflation device is capable of being calibrated. To do so, the processor is provided with a calibration mode. The operator places the balloon inflation device in calibration mode and pushes a start button. The processor continually adjusts the digital potentiometer (biases one half of the strain gauge output until the processor reads a voltage value of about 200 mV on the analog-digital converter. The processor stores the current digital pot setting to EEPROM, and sets this to correlate to 0 psi. An LED on the printed circuit board of the processor starts flashing to indicate that 0 psi is set. The operator introduces a 1 psi reference pressure to the inflation nozzle. The operator pushes start button. analog-digital converter is read establishing the analog-digital converter value for 1 psi. Using the 0 psi and 1 psi values the analog-digital converter to psi conversion factor is calculated. The conversion factor is stored in EEPROM. The operator takes the unit out of calibration mode and the device is ready to inflate balloons. These values are retained until recalibrated at some time in the future. In some embodiments, the pressure sensor nozzle 24 is positioned to eliminate or minimize any choked flow artifacts such as Venturi and back pressure that will artificially and adversely affects the transducer value. In particular embodiments, the fill nozzle 22 is defined by a sidewall 42 and the pressure sensor nozzle 24 is positioned up closely adjacent the interior surface 44 of the sidewall 42. This is particularly appreciated in the specific embodiment of FIG. 1, wherein the pressure sensor nozzle 24 is positioned very close to the internal sidewall of the fill nozzle 22. In some embodiments, this positioning helps to shelter the pressure sensor nozzle 24. For example, the fill nozzle 22 has an overhanging portion 46 proximate the outlet end 26, and this overhanging portion 46 shelters the pressure sensor nozzle 24 so as to prevent balloon and/or balloon valve material from reaching and covering the inlet end 28 of the pressure sensor nozzle 24 (it will be generally appreciated that many balloons, particularly foil type balloons often filled with helium, have valves in the neck). Notably, if the inlet end were to be covered, that would affect the gas feed to the pressure sensor 32, perhaps preventing shutoff at the appropriate time and leading to an overfilled or popped balloon. In the particular embodiments shown, an exit face 48 of the outlet end 26 of the fill nozzle 22 defines a first plane, and an inlet face 50 of the inlet end 30 of the pressure sensor nozzle 24 defines a second plane that intersects the first plane. Planes are shown in dashed lines in FIG. 2 In some embodiments, these planes intersect at an interior angle of from 30 degrees or more to 170 degrees or less. In other embodiments, these planes intersect at an interior angle of from 45 degrees or more to 120 degrees or less. The interior angle is to be understood as the angle of the planes in the direction of the overhanging portion 46, shown at angle C in FIG. 2. In embodiments employing a pressure transducer for pressure sensor 32, the use of a pressure transducer and its communication with a processor can be achieved in multiple ways and units might be purchased providing all necessary components. In some embodiments, as seen in FIG. 3, the pressure sensor 32 is a pressure transducer communicating with an amplifier 52 that amplifies the voltage output of the pressure transducer to be read by a comparator 54. The comparator 54 produces an output (e.g. a 0 or 1) to the processor 34 based on whether the amplified output relates to a pressure below a desired inflation pressure (i.e., an established threshold pressure) or a pressure equal to or greater than a desired inflation pressure. Once the pressure indicated by the voltage is above the desired inflation pressure, the output of the comparator 54 to the processor 34 causes the processor 34 to immediately place the on/off valve 14 in the “off” state, thus preventing further gas flow into the balloon B. In some embodiments, as seen in FIG. 4, the pressure sensor 32 is a pressure transducer that communicates with an amplifier 52 that amplifies an analog voltage output of the pressure transducer to and analog-digital converter 56 that outputs a converted digital signal to the processor 34. The processor determines whether the digital signal relates to a pressure below a desired inflation pressure (i.e., an established threshold pressure) or a pressure equal to or greater than a desired inflation pressure. Once the pressure indicated by the voltage is above the desired inflation pressure, the output of the comparator 54 to the processor 34 causes the processor 34 to immediately place the on/off valve 14 in the “off” state, thus preventing further gas flow into the balloon.
