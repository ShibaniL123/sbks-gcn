Step 2: 2-hydroxy(3,4,5-d3)benzoate
To a solution of 2-hydroxy(3,4,5-d3)benzoic acid [Example 7, Step 1] (6 g, 42.51 mmol, 1.00 equiv) in methanol (100 mL) was added thionyl chloride (15.06 g, 3.00 equiv). The resulting solution was stirred for 3 h at 65Â° C. The resulting solution was concentrated under vacuum to afford 5 g (76%) of methyl 2-hydroxy(3,4,5-d3)benzoate as colorless oil.
