EXAMPLE 74
3-(3-isopropyl-2,4-dioxo-1-{2-oxo-2-[4-(2-oxo-1,2,4,5-tetrahydro-benzo[d][1,3]diazepin-3-yl)-piperidin-1-yl]-ethyl}-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-pyrimidin-5-yl)-methyl benzoic acetate (reaction scheme No. 3, compound 74)
74.1: (5-bromo-3-isopropyl-2,4-dioxo-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrimidin-1-yl)-acetic acid
Similarly to example 16.8, starting from 1.9 g (10 mmol) of (5-bromo-3-isopropyl-2,4-dioxo-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrimidin-1-yl)-methyl acetate (prepared as described in example 59.1), 1.8 g (100%) of (5-bromo-3-isopropyl-2,4-dioxo-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrimidin-1-yl)-acetic acid is obtained in the form of a white solid.
