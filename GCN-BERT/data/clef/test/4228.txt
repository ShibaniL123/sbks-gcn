Preparation of (2R)-1-(3-bromo-2-methyl-phenyl)-N-(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)propan-2-amine
DIPEA (2.99 mL, 17.10 mmol) was added to (R)-1-(3-bromo-2-methylphenyl)propan-2-amine (1.30 g, 5.70 mmol), and 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl trifluoromethanesulfonate (0.23 M in DCM, 29.7 mL, 6.84 mmol) in 1,4-dioxane (25 mL) at room temperature under nitrogen. The resulting mixture was stirred at 85Â° C. for 16 hours. The reaction mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure and the crude product was purified by flash silica chromatography, elution gradient 0 to 50% EtOAc in heptane. Product containing fractions were concentrated under reduced pressure to afford (R)-1-(3-bromo-2-methylphenyl)-N-(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)propan-2-amine (0.56 g, 32%) as an oil.
