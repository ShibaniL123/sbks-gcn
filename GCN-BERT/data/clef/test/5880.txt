Description of the Related Art Cardiometabolic Syndrome Cardiometabolic syndrome (CMS) describes a constellation of maladaptive cardiovascular, renal, metabolic, prothrombotic, and inflammatory abnormalities. CMS is recognized as a disease entity by the American Society of Endocrinology, National Cholesterol Education Program, and World Health Organization, and is characterized by various salient features such as obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, impaired glucose tolerance, increase in inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP), cytokines, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), interleukins 6 and 10 (IL-6 and IL-10), changes in cell adhesion molecules, prothrombotic and fibrinolytic changes, increase in oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction. Juturu, 2006 DPG Medical Nutrition Therapy. Several of the conditions associated with CMS, e.g., obesity, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes, play a causal role in atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases, which currently account for a considerable proportion of mortality and morbidity in developed, developing and underdeveloped societies. Atherosclerosis Atherosclerosis is a slowly progressive disease characterized by the accumulation of cholesterol within the arterial wall. Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory and solely for the purposes of expanding knowledge in the field, it is thought that lipids deposited in atherosclerotic lesions are derived primarily from plasma apolipoprotein B (apo B)-containing lipoproteins, which include chylomicrons, very low density lipoproteins (VLDL), intermediate-density lipoproteins (IDL), and LDL. Apo B-containing lipoproteins, and in particular LDL, are associated with adverse health outcomes. By contrast, HDL serum levels correlate inversely with coronary heart disease. Indeed, high serum levels of HDL are regarded as a negative risk factor for CHD, and studies suggest that high levels of plasma HDL are not only protective against coronary artery disease, but may actually induce regression of atherosclerotic plaque. See, e.g., Badimon et al., 1992 Circulation 86:(Suppl. III) 86 94; Dansky and Fisher, 1999, Circulation 100:1762 3. Data also suggest that non-HDL cholesterol (non HDL-C) might be a better predictive risk factor of CVD than LDL-C. The Adult Treatment Panel (ATP-III) recommended using non-HDL-C in assessing CVD risk in patients with Type II Diabetes Mellitus. Cholesterol As discussed above, elevated serum cholesterol is linked to coronary heart disease. Circulating cholesterol is carried by plasma lipoproteins, which are particles of complex lipid and protein composition that transport lipids in the blood. Low density lipoprotein (LDL) and high density lipoprotein (HDL) are the major cholesterol-carrier proteins. LDL is believed to be responsible for the delivery of cholesterol from the liver, where it is synthesized or obtained from dietary sources, to extrahepatic tissues in the body. “Reverse cholesterol transport” refers to the transport of cholesterol from extrahepatic tissues to the liver, where it is catabolized and eliminated. It is believed that plasma HDL particles play a major role in the reverse transport process, acting as scavengers of tissue cholesterol. HDL is also responsible for the removal of non-cholesterol lipid, oxidized cholesterol and other oxidized products from the bloodstream. The atherogenic index of plasma (ATP), defined as logarithm [log] of the ratio of plasma concentration of triglycerides (TG) to HDL-cholesterol (TG/HDL-C), has recently been proposed as a predictive marker for plasma atherogenicity and is positively correlated with cardiovascular disease (CVD). Lipoprotein subclass abnormalities that accompany insulin resistance are characterized by large, triglyceride-enriched very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles; small, cholesterol-depleted LDL particles; and small HDL particles. In addition, more severe states of insulin resistance have been associated with progressively higher numbers of VLDL particles, intermediate-density lipoprotein particles and, most importantly, LDL particles. The strong correlation of atherogenic index in plasma with lipoprotein particle size may explain its association with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Atherogenic dyslipidemia results in increased atherosclerotic plaque formation because of an imbalance between an increased number of small, dense LDL particles, which carry cholesterol to the vascular endothelium, and a decreased number of HDL particles, which remove cholesterol from atherosclerotic vessels. Insulin resistance is the initial physiological defect in the pathogenesis of diabetes, such as Type II diabetes mellitus (“T2DM”); the associated atherogenic lipoprotein phenotype considerably enhances the risk of CVD. The combination of these factors may lead to cardiometabolic syndrome which is different from metabolic syndrome. Hyperinsulinemia is often clustered with other cardiovascular risk factors; the presence of endogenous hyperinsulinemia combined with hypertriglyceridemia (HTG), increased body mass index, and a decreased HDL-C increase the risk of CHD death in patients with T2DM. Castro et al, 2003, Curr Hypertens Rep. 5(5):393-401; Lastra et al. 2006, Curr Diab Rep. 6(3):207-12. Cholesterol Transport The fat-transport system can be divided into two pathways: an exogenous one for cholesterol and triglycerides absorbed from the intestine and an endogenous one for cholesterol and triglycerides entering the bloodstream from the liver and other non-hepatic tissue. In the exogenous pathway, dietary fats are packaged into lipoprotein particles called chylomicrons, which enter the bloodstream and deliver their triglycerides to adipose tissue for storage and to muscle for oxidation to supply energy. The remnant of the chylomicron, which contains cholesteryl esters, is removed from the circulation by a specific receptor found only on liver cells. This cholesterol then becomes available again for cellular metabolism or for recycling to extrahepatic tissues as plasma lipoproteins. In the endogenous pathway, the liver secretes a large, very-low-density lipoprotein particle (VLDL) into the bloodstream. The core of VLDL consists mostly of triglycerides synthesized in the liver, with a smaller amount of cholesteryl esters either synthesized in the liver or recycled from chylomicrons. Two predominant proteins are displayed on the surface of VLDL, apolipoprotein B-100 (apo B-100) and apolipoprotein E (apo E), although other apolipoproteins are present, such as apolipoprotein CIII (apo CIII) and apolipoprotein CII (apo CII). When VLDL reaches the capillaries of adipose tissue or of muscle, its triglyceride is extracted. This results in the formation of a new kind of particle called intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL) or VLDL remnant, decreased in size and enriched in cholesteryl esters relative to a VLDL, but retaining its two apoproteins. In human beings, about half of the IDL particles are removed from the circulation quickly, generally within two to six hours of their formation. This is because IDL particles bind tightly to liver cells, which extract IDL cholesterol to make new VLDL and bile acids. The IDL not taken up by the liver is catabolized by the hepatic lipase, an enzyme bound to the proteoglycan on liver cells. Apo E dissociates from IDL as it is transformed to LDL. Apo B-100 is the sole protein of LDL. Primarily, the liver takes up and degrades circulating cholesterol to bile acids, which are the end products of cholesterol metabolism. The uptake of cholesterol-containing particles is mediated by LDL receptors, which are present in high concentrations on hepatocytes. The LDL receptor binds both apo E and apo B-100 and is responsible for binding and removing both IDL and LDL from the circulation. In addition, remnant receptors are responsible for clearing chylomicrons and VLDL remnants, i.e., IDL. However, the affinity of apo E for the LDL receptor is greater than that of apo B-100. As a result, the LDL particles have a much longer circulating life span than IDL particles; LDL circulates for an average of two and a half days before binding to the LDL receptors in the liver and other tissues. High serum levels of LDL are positively associated with coronary heart disease. For example, in atherosclerosis, cholesterol derived from circulating LDL accumulates in the walls of arteries. This accumulation forms bulky plaques that inhibit the flow of blood until a clot eventually forms, obstructing an artery which may ultimately lead to heart attack or stroke. Ultimately, the amount of intracellular cholesterol liberated from the LDL controls cellular cholesterol metabolism. The accumulation of cellular cholesterol derived from VLDL and LDL controls three processes. First, it reduces the ability of the cell to make its own cholesterol by turning off the synthesis of HMGCoA reductase, a key enzyme in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway. Second, the incoming LDL-derived cholesterol promotes storage of cholesterol by the action of cholesterol acyltransferase (“ACAT”), the cellular enzyme that converts cholesterol into cholesteryl esters that are deposited in storage droplets. Third, the accumulation of cholesterol within the cell drives a feedback mechanism that inhibits cellular synthesis of new LDL receptors. Cells, therefore, adjust their complement of LDL receptors so that enough cholesterol is brought in to meet their metabolic needs, without overloading. High levels of apo B-containing lipoproteins can be trapped in the subendothelial space of an artery and undergo oxidation. The oxidized lipoprotein is recognized by scavenger receptors on macrophages. Binding of oxidized lipoprotein to the scavenger receptors can enrich the macrophages with cholesterol and cholesteryl esters independently of the LDL receptor. Macrophages can also produce cholesteryl esters by the action of ACAT. LDL can also be complexed to a high molecular weight glycoprotein called apolipoprotein(a), also known as apo(a), through a disulfide bridge. The LDL-apo(a) complex is known as Lipoprotein(a) or Lp(a). Elevated levels of Lp(a) are detrimental, having been associated with atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction, stroke, cerebral infarction, and restenosis following angioplasty. Wang et al. 2006, J Lipid Res. 5. Reverse Cholesterol Transport Peripheral (non-hepatic) cells predominantly obtain their cholesterol from a combination of local synthesis and uptake of preformed sterol from VLDL and LDL. Cells expressing scavenger receptors, such as macrophages and smooth muscle cells, can also obtain cholesterol from oxidized apo B-containing lipoproteins. In contrast, reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) is the pathway by which peripheral cell cholesterol can be returned to the liver for recycling to extrahepatic tissues, hepatic storage, or excretion into the intestine in bile. The RCT pathway represents the only means of eliminating cholesterol from most extrahepatic tissues and is crucial to the maintenance of the structure and function of most cells in the body. The enzyme in blood involved in the RCT pathway, lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), converts cell-derived cholesterol to cholesteryl esters, which are sequestered in HDL destined for removal. LCAT is produced mainly in the liver and circulates in plasma associated with the HDL fraction. Cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP) and another lipid transfer protein, phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP), contribute to further remodeling the circulating HDL population. PLTP supplies lecithin to HDL, and CETP can move cholesteryl esters made by LCAT to other lipoproteins, particularly apoB-containing lipoproteins, such as VLDL. HDL triglycerides can be catabolized by the extracellular hepatic triglyceride lipase and lipoprotein cholesterol is removed by the liver via several mechanisms. Each HDL particle contains at least one molecule, and usually two to four molecules, of apolipoprotein A I (apo A I). Apo A I is synthesized by the liver and small intestine as preproapolipoprotein, which is secreted as a proprotein that is rapidly cleaved to generate a mature polypeptide having 243 amino acid residues. Apo A I consists mainly of a 22 amino acid repeating segment, spaced with helix-breaking proline residues. Apo A I forms three types of stable structures with lipids: small, lipid-poor complexes referred to as pre-beta-1 HDL; flattened discoidal particles, referred to as pre-beta-2 HDL, which contain only polar lipids (e.g., phospholipid and cholesterol); and spherical particles containing both polar and nonpolar lipids, referred to as spherical or mature HDL (HDL3 and HDL2). Most HDL in the circulating population contains both apo A I and apo A II, a second major HDL protein. The apo A I- and apo A II-containing fraction is referred to herein as the AI/AII-HDL fraction of HDL. The fraction of HDL containing only apo A I, referred to herein as the AI HDL fraction, appears to be more effective in RCT. Certain epidemiologic studies support the hypothesis that the Al-HDL fraction is antiartherogenic. Spady et al. 1999, Circulation. 100:576-578; Fielding C J, Fielding P E 1995, J Lipid Res. 36:211-228. The LCAT reaction requires an apolipoprotein such as apo A I or apo A-IV as an activator. ApoA-I is one of the natural cofactors for LCAT. The conversion of cholesterol to its HDL-sequestered ester prevents re-entry of cholesterol into the cell, resulting in the ultimate removal of cellular cholesterol. HDL is not only involved in the reverse transport of cholesterol, but also plays a role in the reverse transport of other lipids, e.g., the transport of lipids from cells, organs, and tissues to the liver for catabolism and excretion. Such lipids include sphingomyelin, oxidized lipids, and lysophophatidylcholine. For example, Robins and Fasulo have shown that HDL stimulates the transport of plant sterol by the liver into bile secretions. Robins and Fasulo (1997, J Clin. Invest. 99:380 384. Cardiometabolic Syndrome Available data suggest that insulin resistance is responsible for more than 40% of heart attacks and is the underlying cause for various risk factors, which lead to cardiometabolic syndrome (CMS). In cardiovascular tissues there are two pathways of insulin receptor signaling: one that is predominant in metabolic tissues (mediated by phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase); and a growth factor-like pathway (mediated by MAPK). The first pathway can lead to atherosclerosis. Patients presenting with multiple cardiometabolic risk factors have triple the risk of experiencing a myocardial infarction and/or stroke and double the risk of mortality. In addition, the risk for developing type 2 diabetes, if not already present, is fivefold above the risk in patients without CMS. In addition to the risks discussed above, hyperinsulinemia and hypertension, two conditions associated with CMS, can also contribute significantly to progressive renal disease. Other mechanisms that potentially lead to progressive renal disease and CMS can include endothelial dysfunction, left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), cardiac hyperreactivity, dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia, enhanced renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) activity, altered renal structure and function with impaired pressure natriuresis leading to sodium retention, volume expansion, progressive renal disease, and eventually end-stage renal disease (ESRD). It has also been suggested that the impact of the CMS is largely independent from glycaemic control, and is associated with several neglected modifiable and non modifable risk factors, such as abdominal obesity, especially visceral obesity. A common pathophysiologic process, such as endothelial dysfunction, chronic low-grade inflammation, or increased transvascular leakage of macromolecules, can underlie the association between microalbuminuria and cardiovascular disease. Microalbuminuria has been implicated as an independent risk factor for CVD and premature cardiovascular mortality for patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus, as well as for patients with essential hypertension. The combination of diabetes and CHD risk factors could be explained by metabolic abnormalities that are not currently assessed in daily clinical practice. It is therefore suggested that in order to optimally manage these risk factors, attention should be given not only to reduce risk factors, but also to the improvement of features of the CMS Juturu, 2006 DPGMNT. Insulin resistance is a condition that is characterized by decreased insulin function and hyperinsulinemia. Individuals who have insulin resistance also have an increased risk of developing diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, hypertension, atherosclerosis, endothelial dysfunction, microalbuminuria, obesity, depression, Syndrome X, and polycystic ovary syndrome, among other conditions. In addition, all of the aforementioned conditions carry the risk of developing associated diseases. For example, diabetes increases the risk of developing associated diseases such as diabetic nephropathy, neuropathy, and retinopathy. Insulin resistance may result from taking certain drug therapies such as statins, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), steroids, oral contraceptives, hormone replacement therapy (HRT), beta blockers, potassium channel openers, diuretics, immunosuppressive drugs, etc. For example, A. Jula et al. report that fasting serum insulin levels increased 13% and insulin resistance increased by 14% in 120 nondiabetic hypercholesterolemic male patients taking statin drugs to reduce their cholesterol levels. A. Jula et al., 2002, JAMA 287:598-605, 604. Furthermore, it has also been reported that beta blockers and diuretics worsen insulin resistance and that patients taking beta blockers had a 28% higher incidence of diabetes than untreated patients with hypertension. S. Julius et al., 2001, Am. J Hypertens. 14:310S-316S, 313S. Insulin resistance has also been described as a side effect of a variety of oral contraceptives. In a study of the metabolic effects of implantable steroid contraceptives, altered glucose tolerance characterized by decreased insulin sensitivity following glucose administration was seen in individuals with implantable contraceptives, such as NORPLANT®, JADELLE®, and IMPLANON® was observed. Dorfgliner, L. J., 2002, Contraception 65:47-62, Peterson, K. R., 2002, Danish Medical Bulletin 49:43-60. Similarly, oral contraceptives and hormone replacement therapy (“HRT”) have been linked to the onset of microalbuminuria. Monster, T. B. M et al., 2001, Arch Intern Med. 161:2000-2005. Often, physicians will prescribe a hypoglycemic drug such as metformin, which the patient must continue to take for the rest of the patient's life, for individuals presenting with insulin resistance. The Role of Chromium Dietary supplementation of chromium to normal individuals has been reported to lead to improvements in glucose tolerance, serum lipid concentrations, including high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, insulin and insulin binding. Anderson, 1986 Clin. Psychol. Biochem. 4:31-41. Supplemental chromium in the trivalent form, e.g. chromic chloride, is associated with improvements of risk factors associated with adult-onset (Type 2) diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Chromium is a nutritionally essential trace element. The necessity of dietary chromium was established in 1959 by Schwartz. Schwartz, “Present Knowledge in Nutrition,” page 571, fifth edition (1984, the Nutrition Foundation, Washington, D.C.). Chromium depletion is characterized by the disturbance of glucose, lipid and protein metabolism and by a shortened lifespan. Chromium is essential for optimal insulin activity in all known insulin-dependent systems. Boyle et al., 1977 Southern Med. J. 70:1449-1453. Insufficient dietary chromium has been linked to both maturity-onset diabetes and to cardiovascular disease. The principal energy sources for the body are glucose and fatty acids. Chromium depletion results in biologically ineffective insulin and compromised glucose metabolism. Under these conditions, the body relies primarily upon lipid metabolism to meet its energy requirements, which can lead to the production of elevated amounts of acetyl-CoA and ketone bodies. In some cases, some of the acetyl-CoA can be diverted to increased cholesterol biosynthesis, resulting in hypercholesterolemia. As such, glycosuria, hypercholesterolemia, and often ketoacidosis are often associated with diabetes mellitus. The accelerated atherosclerotic process seen in diabetics is associated with hypercholesterolemia Boyle et al., supra. Chromium functions as a cofactor for insulin. It binds to the insulin receptor and potentiates many, and perhaps all, of its functions. Boyle et al., supra. These functions include, but are not limited to, the regulation of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. Present Knowledge in Nutrition, supra, at p. 573-577. The introduction of inorganic chromium compounds per se into individuals is not particularly beneficial. Chromium must be converted endogenously into an organic complex or must be consumed as a biologically active molecule. Only about 0.5% of ingested inorganic chromium, however, is assimilated into the body. Only 1-2% of most organic chromium compounds are assimilated into the body. Recommended Daily Allowances, Ninth Revised Edition, The National Academy of Sciences, page 160, 1980. U.S. Pat. No. Re. 33,988 discloses that when selected essential metals, including chromium, are administered to mammals as exogenously synthesized coordination complexes of picolinic acid, they are directly available for absorption without competition from other metals. U.S. Pat. No. Re. 33,988 describes a composition and method for selectively supplementing the essential metals in the human diet and for facilitating absorption of these metals by intestinal cells. These complexes are safe, inexpensive, biocompatible, and easy to produce. These exogenously synthesized essential metal coordination complexes of picolinic acid (pyridine-2-carboxylic acid) have the following structural formula: wherein M represents the metallic cation and n is equal to the cation's valence. For example, when M is Cr and n=3, then the compound is chromic tripicolinate. Other chromium picolinates disclosed include chromic monopicolinate and chromic dipicolinate. The U.S. Recommended Daily Intake (RDI) of chromium is 120 μs. U.S. Pat. No. 5,087,623, the entire contents of which are hereby expressly incorporated herein by reference, describes the administration of chromic tripicolinate for the treatment of adult-onset diabetes in doses ranging from 50 to 500 μs. U.S. Pat. No. 6,329,361, the entire contents of which are hereby expressly incorporated herein by reference, discloses the use of high doses of chromic tripicolinate (providing 1,000-10,000 μg chromium/day) for reducing hyperglycemia and stabilizing the level of serum glucose in humans with Type 2 diabetes. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,789,401 and 5,929,066, the entire contents of which are hereby expressly incorporated herein by reference, disclose a chromic tripicolinate-biotin composition and its use in lowering blood glucose levels in humans with Type 2 diabetes. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,087,623; 5,087,624; and 5,175,156, the entire contents of which are hereby expressly incorporated herein by reference, disclose the use of chromium tripicolinate for supplementing dietary chromium, reducing hyperglycemia and stabilizing serum glucose, increasing lean body mass and reducing body fat, and controlling serum lipid levels, including the lowering of undesirably high serum LDL-cholesterol levels and the raising of serum High Density Lipid (HDL)-cholesterol levels. U.S. patent application Ser. Nos. 10/090,038 and 11/136,794, the entire contents of which are hereby expressly incorporated by reference in their entireties, disclose the use of high doses of chromium complexes (providing between 1,000 and 10,000 μg/day) and biotin for treating dyslipidemia, and increasing serum HDL levels. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,954,492 and 5,194,615, the entire contents of which are hereby expressly incorporated by reference, describe a related complex, chromic nicotinate, which is also used for supplementing dietary chromium and lowering serum lipid levels. Picolinic acid and nicotinic acid are position isomers having the following structures: Nicotinic acid and picolinic acid form coordination complexes with monovalent, divalent and trivalent metal ions and facilitate the absorption of these metals by transporting them across intestinal cells and into the bloodstream. Other compounds such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspirin and indomethachin have also been shown to facilitate chromium absorption. For Example, Davis et al. demonstrated that orally administered CrCl3 is facilitated by the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) aspirin and indomethacin. Davis et al., 1995, J. Nutrition Res. 15:202-210 (1995); Kamath et al., 1997, J. Nutrition 127:478-482. These drugs inhibit the enzyme cyclooxygenase which converts arachidonic acid to various prostaglandins, resulting in inhibition of intestinal mucus formation and lowering of intestinal pH which facilitates chromium absorption. U.S. Pat. No. 4,315,927 teaches that when selected essential metals are administered to mammals as exogenously synthesized coordination complexes of picolinic acid, they are directly available for absorption without competition from other metals. These complexes are safe, inexpensive, biocompatible and easy to produce. There remains a need for sources of chromium that exhibit favorable absorption profiles, and also that provide for the release of chromium from the coordination complex once within the cell. Further, there remains a need for compositions that provide sources of chromium with differing absorption profiles to provide a fast and slow-acting source of chromium. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Provided herein are improved compositions for supplementing chromium in individuals. Some embodiments provide compositions for the administration of chromium over a period of time.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT The present invention is based, in part, on the novel and unexpected discovery that the combination of a slow-acting, lipophilic chromium complex with a fast-acting, hydrophilic chromium complex provides unexpected and improved properties when compared to either a fast-acting or a slow-acting chromium complex alone. Accordingly, described herein are compositions that provide for improved administration of chromium to an individual, and methods of uses thereof, that include at least one slow-acting, lipophilic chromium complex and at least one fast-acting, hydrophilic chromium complex. In some embodiments, the compositions can comprise, consist essentially of, or consist of at least two components: a hydrophilic chromium complex and a lipophilic chromium complex. In other embodiments, the compositions can include a first chromium complex and a second chromium complex, wherein the first chromium complex is absorbed more quickly (“fast-acting”) than the second chromium complex (“slow-acting”). As used herein, the phrase “over a period of time,” can refer to a period of minutes, hours or days. For example, over a period of time can refer to at least 10 minutes, at least 15 minutes, at least 30 minutes, at least 60 minutes, at least 75 minutes, at least 90 minutes, at least 105 minutes, at least 120 minutes, at least 3 hours, at least 4 hours, at least 5 hours, at least 6 hours, at least 7 hours, at least 8 hours, at least 9 hours, at least 10 hours, at least 12 hours, at least 14 hours, at least 16, hours, at least 18 hours, at least 20 hours, at least 22 hours, at least one day, at least two days, at least three days, at least 4 days, at least 5 days, at least 6 days, at least a week, or any interval of time in between. In other words, the chromium from the composition can be absorbed by the individual to whom it is administered over a period of at least 10 minutes, at least 15 minutes, at least 30 minutes, at least 60 minutes, at least 75 minutes, at least 90 minutes, at least 105 minutes, at least 120 minutes, at least 3 hours, at least 4 hours, at least 5 hours, at least 6 hours, at least 7 hours, at least 8 hours, at least 9 hours, at least 10 hours, at least 12 hours, at least 14 hours, at least 16, hours, at least 18 hours, at least 20 hours, at least 22 hours, at least one day, at least two days, at least three days, at least 4 days, at least 5 days, at least 6 days, at least a week, or any interval of time in between. In some embodiments, the compositions provide bioavailable chromium for a period of time that is about the same as the period of time that a “slow-acting” chromium complex alone provides bioavailable chromium. The term “bioavailable,” in reference to chromium as used herein is meant to refer to the amount of chromium that is absorbed by an individual. In preferred embodiments, the compositions provide bioavailable chromium over a total period of time that is greater than the period of time as that of the “slow-acting” chromium complex alone provides bioavailable chromium. For example, the compositions described herein can provide bioavailable chromium for a period of time that is at least 10 minutes, at least 15 minutes, at least 30 minutes, at least 60 minutes, at least 75 minutes, at least 90 minutes, at least 105 minutes, at least 120 minutes, at least 3 hours, at least 4 hours, at least 5 hours, at least 6 hours, at least 7 hours, at least 8 hours, at least 9 hours, at least 10 hours, at least 12 hours, at least 14 hours, at least 16, hours, at least 18 hours, at least 20 hours, at least 22 hours, at least one day, at least two days, at least three days, at least 4 days, at least 5 days, at least 6 days, at least a week, or any interval of time in between, greater than the “slow-acting” chromium complex alone. By administrating a slow-acting chromium complex together with a fast-acting chromium complex, we have been able to achieve a sustained release and absorption of chromium over a period of time. As used herein, the term “hydrophilic chromium complex” or “fast acting chromium complex” refers to a chromium complex that is charged at physiological pH, or has polar properties. Non-limiting examples of hydrophilic, fast-acting chromium complexes include chromium acetate, chromium chloride, chromium histidinate and chromium nicotinate, and the like, or any pharmaceutically acceptable salts, hydrates, solvates, or mixtures thereof. The term “lipophilic chromium complex” or “slow-acting chromium complex” refers to a chromium complex that is not charged at physiological pH, and that does not have polar properties. Chromium picolinate, and any pharmaceutically acceptable salts, hydrates, or solvates thereof, is a non limiting example of a lipophilic, slow-acting chromium complex. In preferred embodiments, the hydrophilic chromium complex or the “fast-acting” chromium complex is chromium histidinate, chromium trihistidinate, or chromium polyhistidinate, or any combination thereof. Preferably, the lipophilic chromium complex or the “slow-acting” chromium complex is chromium picolinate. The terminology used in the description presented herein is not intended to be interpreted in any limited or restrictive manner, simply because it is being utilized in conjunction with a detailed description of certain specific embodiments described herein. Furthermore, embodiments described herein can include several novel features, no single one of which is solely responsible for its desirable attributes or which is essential to practicing the invention herein described. As used herein, the term “slow-acting chromium complexes” or “slow-acting chromium complex” includes trivalent chromium complexes, such as chromium picolinate, chromic tripicolinate, and other lipophilic chromium complexes, whether now known or developed in the future. The present invention is based, in part, on the novel and unexpected discovery that when a subject is administered a fast-acting chromium complex and a slow-acting chromium complex, the symptoms and incidence of insulin resistance are lowered. Accordingly, some embodiments provide a method for the inhibition or reduction of insulin resistance, or lowering the risk of developing insulin resistance or related symptoms by lowering glucose and lipids and improving insulin sensitivity by administering a fast-acting and a slow-acting chromium complex, e.g., chromium histidinate and chromium picolinate. As used herein, the term “altering lipid metabolism” indicates an observable (measurable) change in at least one aspect of lipid metabolism, including but not limited to total blood lipid content, blood HDL cholesterol, blood LDL cholesterol, blood VLDL cholesterol, blood triglyceride, blood Lp(a), blood apo A-I, blood apo E and blood non-esterified fatty acids, esters of fatty acids, isomers, isoforms and ratios and improving ratios for reducing chronic disease risk but not limited to diabetes, obesity, hypertension, coronary heart disease and cardiovascular disease.

The above list is provided for example purposes only and it is understood that the definition of “drug which induces insulin resistance” includes those drugs which induce insulin resistance that are not specifically listed above, as well as those drugs which are found to induce insulin resistance, whether in existence today or developed in the future. Examples of diet which induce insulin resistance include diets high in fats, carbohydrates, low dietary fiber, high glycemic index foods, high fructose in the functional foods, beverages, and bars. Other embodiments relate to the use of compositions comprising, consisting essentially of, or consisting of chromium and histidine, chromium histidinate complex, chromium trihistidinate, or chromium poly histidinate complex, or combinations thereof, including pharmaceutically acceptable salts, hydrates, solvates, or mixtures thereof in combination with a second slow-acting chromium complex for the treatment or prevention of cardiometabolic syndrome and related conditions, diseases, and disorders. The term “treating” or “treatment” does not necessarily mean total cure. Any alleviation of any undesired signs or symptoms of the disease to any extent or the slowing down of the progress, or even prevention of the disease or condition can be considered treatment. Other embodiments relate to the use of compositions comprising, consisting essentially of, or consisting of chromium and histidine, chromium histidinate complex, chromium trihistidinate, or chromium poly histidinate complex, or combinations thereof, including pharmaceutically acceptable salts, hydrates, solvates, or mixtures thereof in combination with a second slow-acting chromium complex for the maintenance of healthy or normal serum glucose levels, serum cholesterol levels, serum triglyceride levels, or free fatty acid levels and/or the prevention of the development of hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, high cholesterol, high triglycerides, or high free fatty acid levels. In some embodiments, the subject may have normal blood glucose, cholesterol, triglyceride, or free fatty acid levels. Accordingly, some embodiments relate to maintenance of fasting plasma glucose levels at less than about 100 mg/dL (5.55 mmol per liter) in a subject, for example, in a healthy subject. Some embodiments relate to maintenance of total serum cholesterol levels below about 200 mg/dL, maintenance of serum HDL levels above about 40-50 mg/dL; maintenance of serum LDL levels below about 100 mg/dL, maintenance of serum triglycerides at below about 150 mg/dL, or the like. The Role of Histidine/Histidinate Histidine is one of the 20 most common natural amino acids present in proteins. In the nutritional sense, in humans, histidine is considered an essential amino acid for normal healthy function. The imidazole side chains and the relatively neutral pKa of histidine (ca 6.0) mean that relatively small shifts in cellular pH will change its charge. For this reason, this amino acid side chain finds its way into considerable use as a coordinating ligand in metalloproteins, and also as a catalytic site in certain enzymes. The imidazole side chain has two nitrogens with different properties: one is bound to hydrogen and donates its lone pair to the aromatic ring and as such is slightly acidic; the other one donates only one electron to the ring so it has a free lone pair and is basic. These properties are exploited in different ways in proteins. In catalytic triads, the basic nitrogen of histidine is used to abstract a proton from serine, threonine or cysteine to activate it as a nucleophile. In a histidine proton shuttle, histidine is used to quickly shuttle protons, it can do this by abstracting a proton with its basic nitrogen to make a positively-charged intermediate and then use another molecule, a buffer, to extract the proton from its acidic nitrogen. In carbonic anhydrases, a histidine proton shuttle is utilized to rapidly shuttle protons away from a zinc-bound water molecule to quickly regenerate the active form of the enzyme. The amino acid is a precursor for histamine and carnosine biosynthesis. Histidine has two enantiomeric forms: D-histidine and L-histidine. The structure of histidine is shown below. Histidine is a basic, essential amino acid that is also a precursor of histamine, a compound released by immune system cells during an allergic reaction. Histamine is needed for growth and for the repair of tissue, as well as the maintenance of the myelin sheaths that act as protector for nerve cells. It is further required for the manufacture of both red and white blood cells, and helps to protect the body from damage caused by radiation and in removing heavy metals from the body. In the stomach, histidine is also helpful in producing gastric juices, and people with a shortage of gastric juices or suffering from indigestion, may also benefit from this nutrient. Histidine is also used for sexual arousal, functioning and enjoyment. Histidinemia is an inborn error of the metabolism of histidine due to a deficiency of the enzyme histidase, where high levels of histidine are found in the blood and urine, and may manifest in speech disorders and mental retardation. The compositions described herein that comprise chromium and histidine, or chromium histidinate complexes, such as chromium histidinate chromium trihistidinate, and chromium polyhistidinate, or combinations thereof, e.g., including components of some of the compositions disclosed herein for the administration of chromium over a period of time, exhibit improved absorption in mammals over other known chromium complexes. In particular, the compositions described herein show superior absorption and intracellular release of chromium from the histidinate complex.

In accordance with the methods disclosed herein, the amount of chromium provided by the compositions that comprise fast-acting and slow-acting complexes disclosed herein can be at least 50 μg per day, for example at least 60 μg, at least 70 μg, at least 80 μg, at least 90 μg, at least 100 μg, at least 125 μg, at least 150 μg, at least 200 μg, at least 250 μg, at least 300 μg, at least 350 μg, at least 400 μg, at least 450 μg, at least 500 μg, at least 550 μg, at least 600 μg, at least 650 μg, at least 700 μg, at least 750 μg, at least 800 μg, at least 850 μg, at least 900 μg, at least 950 μg, at least 1,000 μg, at least 1500 μg, at least 2,000 μg, at least 2500 μg, at least 3000 μg, at least 3500 μg, at least 4000 μg, at least 4500 μg or at least 5000 μg chromium complex/day. The fast-acting and the slow-acting chromium complexes can be provided to a subject such that the ratio of chromium in the form of a “fast-acting” chromium complex to the chromium in the form of a “slow-acting” chromium complex is anywhere from 10:1 to 1:10, e.g., 9:1, 8:1, 7:1, 6:1, 5:1, 4:1, 3:1, 2:1, 1:1, 1:2, 1:3, 1:4, 1:5, 1:6, 1:7, 1;8, 1:9, 1:10, or any fraction in between. In some embodiments, the ratio of chromium provided in the form of a fast-acting chromium complex to the slow-acting chromium complex is 1:1. By way of example, the level of chromium used for supplementation in order to inhibit the onset of insulin resistance is at least about 50 μg/day. Chromium picolinate and chromium chloride have been administered to rats at levels several thousand times the upper limit of the estimated safe and adequate daily dietary intake (ESADDI) for chromium for humans (based on body weight) without toxic effects. R. Anderson et al., Lack of Toxicity of Chromium Chloride and Picolinate, 16 J. Am. Coll. Nutr. 273-279 (1997). While the level of chromium, in the form of fast-acting and slow-acting chromium complexes, used for supplementation may be within several thousand times the upper limit of the ESADDI, preferably, the total amount of chromium provided by the fast-acting and slow-acting complexes is between about 50 and 2,000 μg/day. More preferably, the amount of total chromium provided by the fast-acting and slow-acting complexes is between about 300 and 1,000 μg/day. Most preferably, the amount of total chromium is between about 400 and 1,000 μg/day. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the amount of total chromium is between about 600 and 1,000 μg/day. These doses are based on a 70 kg adult human, and that the dose can be applied on a per-kilogram basis to humans or animals of different weights. In some embodiments, the amount of fast-acting chromium complex and the amount of slow-acting chromium complex in a composition provide a greater than additive effect in lowering serum glucose levels than either complex alone. In some embodiments, the amount of fast-acting chromium complex and the amount of slow-acting chromium complex in a composition provide a synergistic or greater than additive effect in improving insulin sensitivity. In some embodiments, the amount of fast-acting chromium complex and the amount of slow-acting chromium complex in a composition provide a greater than additive effect in treating dyslipidemia.

In some embodiments, the amount of fast-acting chromium complex and the amount of slow-acting chromium complex in a composition provide a greater than additive effect in increasing lean muscle mass. In some embodiments, the compositions disclosed herein are provided in an amount effective for the prevention of insulin resistance. As used herein, the term “insulin resistance (IR)” refers to a physiologically abnormal state in which cells do not respond appropriately to insulin, such that glucose in the blood cannot efficiently enter cells and, therefore, leads to hyperglycemia. Insulin resistance is believed to affect one in three adult Americans which amounts to approximately 99.3 million Americans with some degree of insulin resistance. The cardiovascular and metabolic disturbances associated with IR can individually and interdependently lead to a substantial increase in cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbidity and mortality, making the cardiometabolic syndrome an established and strong risk factor for premature and severe CVD and stroke. For example, in some embodiments, a subject is provided a composition comprising a fast-acting chromium complex chromium such as histidinate in combination with a sufficient amount of a slow-acting chromium complex to inhibit or reduce the risk of the onset of insulin resistance are provided. The fast-acting chromium complex can be formulated together with the slow-acting chromium complex or the fast-acting chromium complex can be administered separately before, substantially contemporaneously with or after the slow-acting chromium complex. The assessment of the affects of the compositions on insulin resistance can readily be determined using routine techniques known to those skilled in the art, and described, for example, in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/090,038, herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. Preferably, the sufficient amount of chromium provided by the fast-acting and slow-acting chromium complexes and contained in the composition is between about 50 μg and 2000 μg. Advantageously, an individual is administered a pharmaceutically effective dose of a hydrophilic chromium complex such as chromium histidinate in combination with at least one other lipophilic chromium complex. In some embodiments, a composition the fast-acting and a slow-acting chromium complexes are administered substantially simultaneously. In an alternative embodiment, the fast-acting, hydrophilic and slow-acting, lipohilic chromium complexes are provided to the subject sequentially in either order. If administered separately, the fast-acting and slow-acting chromium complex should be given in a temporally proximate manner, e.g., within a twenty-four hour period. More particularly, the a fast-acting and a slow-acting chromium complex) can be given within one hour of each other. One of skill in the art will appreciate that other components may be added separately or incorporated into a single formulation to enhance the effects of chromium. In some embodiments, the compositions disclosed herein can be provided prior to or concomitantly with an insulin resistance-inducing food. Insulin resistance-inducing foods generally have high glycemic indexes, e.g., over 50. In other embodiments, the compositions are provided after the insulin resistance inducing food. In embodiments wherein the compositions and the insulin resistance-inducing foods are not provided concomitantly, the composition and the food are preferably provided in a temporally proximate manner, e.g., within twenty four hours, and more preferably within one hour.

As used herein, the term “treatment” or “treating” refers to an amelioration of a disease or disorder, or at least one discernible symptom thereof. The term “treatment” or “treating” refers to inhibiting the progression of a disease or disorder, either physically, e.g., stabilization of a discernible symptom, or physiologically, e.g., stabilization of a physical parameter, or both. In certain embodiments, the compositions disclosed herein are provided to a subject, such as a mammal, as a preventative measure against such diseases. As used herein, “prevention” or “preventing” refers to a reduction of the risk of acquiring a given disease or disorder alone or in combination with other clinical condition. In some embodiments, the compositions disclosed herein are provided as a preventative measure to a patient, preferably a human having a genetic predisposition to a aging, Alzheimer's Disease, cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetic nephropathy, diabetic retinopathy, a disorder of glucose metabolism, dyslipidemia, dyslipoproteinemia, enhancing bile production, enhancing reverse lipid transport, hypertension, impotence, inflammation, insulin resistance, lipid elimination in bile, modulating C-reactive protein, obesity, oxysterol elimination in bile, pancreatitis, Parkinson's disease, a peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-associated disorder, phospholipid elimination in bile, renal disease, septicemia, metabolic syndrome disorders (e.g., Syndrome X), a thrombotic disorder, inflammatory processes and diseases like gastrointestinal disease, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), inflammatory bowel disease (e.g., Crohn's Disease, ulcerative colitis), arthritis (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis), autoimmune disease (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus), scleroderma, ankylosing spondylitis, gout and pseudogout, muscle pain: polymyositis/polymyalgia rheumatica/fibrositis; infection and arthritis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, tendonitis, bursitis and other soft tissue rheumatism. Examples of such genetic predispositions include but are not limited to the di-electcons 4 allele of apolipoprotein E, which increases the likelihood of Alzheimer's Disease; a loss of function or null mutation in the lipoprotein lipase gene coding region or promoter (e.g., mutations in the coding regions resulting in the substitutions D9N and N291S; for a review of genetic mutations in the lipoprotein lipase gene that increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases, dyslipidemias and dyslipoproteinemias (Hayden and Ma, 1992, Mol. Cell Biochem. 113:171 176); and familial combined hyperlipidemia and familial hypercholesterolemia. In some embodiments, the compositions disclosed herein are provided to a subject as a preventative measure to a mammal having a non-genetic predisposition to cardiometabolic syndrome, in aging, Alzheimer's Disease, cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetic nephropathy, diabetic retinopathy, a disorder of glucose metabolism, dyslipidemia, dyslipoproteinemia, enhancing bile production, enhancing reverse lipid transport, hypertension, impotence, inflammation, insulin resistance, lipid elimination in bile, modulating C-reactive protein, obesity, oxysterol elimination in bile, pancreatitis, Parkinson's disease, a peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-associated disorder, phospholipid elimination in bile, renal disease, septicemia, metabolic syndrome disorders (e.g., Syndrome X), a thrombotic disorder, inflammatory processes and diseases like gastrointestinal disease, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), inflammatory bowel disease (e.g., Crohn's Disease, ulcerative colitis), arthritis (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis), autoimmune disease (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus), scleroderma, ankylosing spondylitis, gout and pseudogout, muscle pain: polymyositis/polymyalgia rheumatica/fibrositis; infection and arthritis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, tendonitis, bursitis and other soft tissue rheumatism. Examples of such non-genetic predispositions include but are not limited to cardiac bypass surgery and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, which often lead to restenosis, an accelerated form of atherosclerosis; diabetes in women, which often leads to polycystic ovarian disease; and cardiovascular disease, which often leads to impotence. Accordingly, the compositions described herein can be used for the prevention of one disease or disorder and concurrently treating another disease (e.g., prevention of polycystic ovarian disease while treating diabetes; prevention of impotence while treating a cardiovascular disease). In some embodiments, the compositions disclosed herein are provided to a subject to inhibit the onset of insulin resistance in a subject based on criteria including but not limited to family history, diet and drug use. In some embodiments, for example, an individual at risk for developing insulin resistance may believe it is in need or may self-identify or be identified based on family history, obesity, diabetes, CVD and other associated disease conditions including depression, mental health diseases or disorders, glucose and lipid metabolism disturbances, a diet high in fats, carbohydrates, low dietary fiber, deficiency of essential nutrients and not limited to drugs such as a statin drug, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, steroid, oral contraceptive, hormone replacement therapy drug, beta blocker, potassium channel opener, or diuretic and depression drugs. Accordingly, some embodiments provide a method for inhibiting the development of drug-induced insulin resistance including administering a fast-acting, hydrophilic and a slow-acting, lipophilic chromium complex to an individual receiving a contemporaneous dose of a drug that induces insulin resistance. Advantageously, the amount of chromium complex administered is an amount effective to inhibit the development of insulin resistance. The administration of an effective dose of a composition described herein (e.g., chromium histidinate and chromium picolinate), to subjects who have a diet or take drugs which have been linked with the onset of insulin resistance actually inhibits or attenuates the onset of insulin resistance. The supplementation with a fast-acting chromium and slow-acting complex, inhibits the induction of insulin resistance. By not developing insulin resistance in the first place, the patient is not exposed to the associated diseases and risks. The patient also does not need to take additional, and sometimes costly, medications to treat the insulin resistance and associated diseases. Without being limited to a particular theory, we propose that combination chromium supplementation with fast and slow-acting chromium complex inhibits insulin resistance from developing by improving insulin sensitivity and lipid profile levels and lowering blood sugar. Accordingly, in one embodiment, a method of inhibiting or reducing the risk of insulin resistance through combination chromium supplementation is provided. Chromium supplementation includes the administration of a fast-acting chromium complex such as histidinate in combination with at least one other slow-acting chromium complex to an individual. Advantageously, the fast and slow-acting chromium complexes are synthetic. The synthesis and use of chromium picolinates, for example, is described in U.S. Pat. Nos. Re 33,988 and 5,087,623, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. Chromic tripicolinate is available from health food stores, drug stores and other commercial sources. The synthesis and use of chromic polynicotinate is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,194,615. Inhibition of insulin resistance is accomplished by administering an effective dose of fast-acting chromium complex such as a chromium histidinate complex with a slow-acting chromium complex such as chromium picolinate to an individual separately or as a single composition. A subject can begin chromium supplementation at the beginning of their treatment with insulin-resistance. Alternatively, the subject can begin supplementation with a chromium complex after the subject's treatment with insulin-resistance has begun, but before developing insulin resistance. Insulin resistance is a key pathogenic parameter of Type 2 diabetes, and clinical interventions that improve insulin sensitivity are considered cornerstones in the management of the disease. In addition, the relationship of insulin resistance to cardiovascular disease and its associated risk factors has been well established over the past few years. Therefore, in a preferred embodiment, methods and compositions for thwarting the development of insulin resistance are provided comprising the administration of a fast-acting and slow-acting chromium complexes with a hypoglycemic drug such as metformin, which inhibits insulin resistance from developing. Combinations of pharmacologic agents (such as sulfonylureas/metformin, sulfonylureas/glitazones, and metformin/glitazones) are highly effective pharmacologic interventions that appear to lower both glucose and insulin levels. Further, there is evidence that triple drug therapy (e.g. sulfonylureas/metformin/glitazones) can lower clinical glycemia in addition to lowering insulin levels. Hence, in some embodiments, compositions comprising a hydrophobic chromium complex and a hydrophilic chromium complex with metformin, sulfonylureas, and glitazones or combinations thereof are administered to a subject taking drugs which induce insulin resistance to inhibit the onset of such insulin resistance. The disclosure represents the present technology in that the subject has a chance of developing insulin resistance or diabetes or associated conditions but not limited to cardiovascular disease, obesity, diabetes, combination one or two disease conditions based on ATPIII guidelines and or due to mental health conditions such as depression, schizophrenia, alzheimers disease and other conditions such HIV and HIV lipodystrophy and polycystic ovary syndrome. The insulin resistance might be due to family history, body weight, diet and drugs. Treatment of Cardiovascular Diseases The present invention provides methods for the treatment or prevention of a cardiovascular disease, comprising administering to a patient a therapeutically effective amount of a composition comprising, consisting essentially of, or consisting of chromium and histidine, or a chromium histidinate complex with a slow-acting chromium and a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle. As used herein, the term “cardiovascular diseases” refers to diseases of the heart and circulatory system. These diseases are often associated with dyslipoproteinemias and/or dyslipidemias and/or familial hyperlipoproteinemias, hyper cholesterolemia and hyper lipidemia. Cardiovascular diseases which the compositions of the present invention are useful for preventing or treating include but are not limited to arteriosclerosis; atherosclerosis; stroke; ischemia; endothelium dysfunctions, in particular those dysfunctions affecting blood vessel elasticity; peripheral vascular disease; coronary heart disease; myocardial infarction; cerebral infarction and restenosis.

Example 1 Combination Chromium Picolinate/Chromium Histidinate Improves Glucose Uptake In Vitro The following example describes experiments that compared the effects of chromium supplementation in the form of chromium picolinate versus a combination of chromium picolinate:chormium histidinate (1:1 elemental chromium) on glucose uptake in skeletal muscle cells. The amounts of chromium picolinate and the combination were adjusted so as to provide equimolar amounts of elemental chromium. For the combination, 50% of the elemental chromium was provided in the form of chromium picolinate, and 50% was provided in the form of chromium histidinate. To assess glucose uptake, [3H]C-deoxyglucose was added to cultures of skeletal muscle, in media with or without insulin and with or without the indicated chromium supplementation. Uptake of the labeled glucose by the cells was calculated. FIG. 1 shows the percent increase in glucose uptake in cultures receiving chromium supplementation over cultures without chromium supplementation, in the presence and absence of insulin. Both chromium picolinate and the combination chromium picolinate/chromium histidinate stimulated glucose uptake in insulin-stimulated cells. The combination enhanced glucose uptake in both basal and insulin-stimulated cultures to a greater extent than chromium picolinate, even though the cultures were treated with equivalent amounts of elemental chromium.

TABLE 1 Normal Rats High Fat Diet Rats Body weight (g) 277 317 Serum glucose (mg/dL) 100 130 CISI (mg/dL) 2.7 1.6 Serum cholesterol (mg/dL) 58 112 Serum triglycerides (mg/dL) 46 107 Free fatty acids (mmol/L) 1.4 3.1 Serum glucose levels, serum cholesterol levels, serum triglyceride levels, and free fatty acid levels were measured in all groups after twelve weeks. The data are presented in FIGS. 2A-5B. Chromium histidinate decreased serum glucose levels in both normal and high-fat fed rats to a significantly greater degree than chromium picolinate. Surprisingly, the treatment group that received chromium picolinate/chromium histidinate (in the same total amount of elemental chromium as provided by chromium picolinate or chromium histidinate alone) exhibited a significantly greater reduction in serum glucose levels than the treatment groups that received chromium supplementation in the form of chromium as chromium picolinate or chromium histidinate alone. FIGS. 2A and 2B. The synergistic effect of the combination could not have been predicted. Chromium picolinate, chromium histidinate and the combination of chromium picolinate/chromium histidinate resulted in a significant decrease in total serum cholesterol levels in rats fed a normal diet. FIG. 3A. Surprisingly, the treatment group that received chromium picolinate/chromium histidinate (in the same total amount of elemental chromium as provided by chromium picolinate or chromium histidinate alone) had significantly lower serum cholesterol levels than the treatment groups that received chromium supplementation in the form of chromium as chromium picolinate or chromium histidinate alone. FIG. 3B. The synergistic effect of the combination could not have been predicted. Chromium picolinate, chromium histidinate and the combination of chromium picolinate/chromium histidinate resulted in a significant decrease in serum triglyceride levels in rats fed a normal or high fat diet. FIGS. 4A and 4B. Surprisingly, the treatment group that received chromium picolinate/chromium histidinate (in the same total amount of elemental chromium as provided by chromium picolinate or chromium histidinate alone) had significantly lower serum triglyceride levels than the treatment groups that received chromium supplementation in the form of chromium as chromium picolinate or chromium histidinate alone. FIG. 4B. The synergistic effect of the combination could not have been predicted. Chromium picolinate, chromium histidinate and the combination of chromium picolinate/chromium histidinate resulted in a significant decrease in free fatty acid levels in rats fed a normal or high fat diet. FIGS. 5A and 5B. Surprisingly, the treatment group that received chromium picolinate/chromium histidinate (in the same total amount of elemental chromium as provided by chromium picolinate or chromium histidinate alone) had significantly lower free fatty acid levels than the treatment groups that received chromium supplementation in the form of chromium as chromium picolinate or chromium histidinate alone. FIG. 5B. The synergistic effect of the combination could not have been predicted. Example 3 Combination Chromium Supplementation to Achieve Sustained Release of Chromium Combination supplementation with a fast-acting chromium complex and a slow-acting chromium complex results in a sustained release of chromium over a period of time. More specifically, the combination chromium supplementation is useful in achieving prolonged, sustained chromium absorption to an individual in need thereof. Chromium supplementation has many therapeutic indications. For example, chromium has been associated with the improvement of glucose metabolism, mitigation of insulin resistance, improvement of symptoms associated with hyperglycemia, improvement of lipid profiles, promotion of lean body mass, and the reduction of obesity. One of the surprising aspects of the present invention is the discovery that the combination chromium supplementation with a hydrophilic chromium complex and lipophilic chromium complex results in a greater than additive effect in ameliorating some of the diseases, conditions, and associated symptoms disclosed above. Without being bound to a particular theory, it is believed that the synergistic effects observed with combination chromium therapy can be attributed to the achievement of rapid chromium absorption via the hydrophilic chromium complex supplementation and sustained, long-term absorption via the lipophilic chromium complex supplementation. By combining a fast-acting chromium complex with a slow-acting chromium complex, prolonged, sustained absorption of chromium by an individual in need thereof is accomplished. An individual presenting with poor glucose metabolism is identified (e.g., either self-identified or identified by other means). The individual is administered a nutritional supplement comprising an effective dose of chromium histidinate and an effective dose of chromium picolinate. Glucose metabolism is monitored and an improvement in glucose metabolism is observed. An individual with high LDL cholesterol and low HDL cholesterol is identified (e.g., either self-identified or identified by other means). The individual is administered an effective dose of chromium acetate and an effective dose of chromium picolinate. An improvement of the individual's lipid profile is observed. LDL cholesterol is lowered and HDL cholesterol is raised. An individual with insulin resistance is identified (e.g., either self-identified or identified by other means). The individual is administered a dietary beverage comprising an effective dose of chromium histidinate and an effective dose of chromium picolinate. The individual's response to insulin is monitored. The supplementation with chromium histidinate and chromium picolinate results in an improvement in insulin sensitivity.
