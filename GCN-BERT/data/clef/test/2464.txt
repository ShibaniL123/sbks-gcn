The present invention relates to a makeup method of a nail and/or false nail by applying photocrosslinkable varnish compositions. Nail varnish compositions may be used as a base for the varnish (or base-coat), as a nail makeup product, or as a finishing composition (or top-coat) to be applied on the nail makeup product, or as a cosmetic nail care product. These compositions may be applied onto natural nails as well as onto false nails. In the field of nail varnishes, liquid cosmetic compositions are known, which are used by first applying a coat onto the nail and then subjecting said coat to the action of light radiation, inducing in situ polymerization and/or crosslinking reactions within said coat, resulting in generally crosslinked polymeric networks. Such photocrosslinkable compositions, commonly referred to as “UV gels” and generally based on (meth)acrylate monomer type crosslinkable compounds, are suitable for obtaining a satisfactory stability of the coat applied on the nail, and are described for example in CA 1 306 954, U.S. Pat. No. 5,456,905, U.S. Pat. No. 7,375,144 and FR 2 823 105. Some products substantially free from (meth)acrylate monomers are also on the market. However, these products pose performance problems particularly in respect of makeup quality and varnish stability over time. The aim of the present invention is to provide a novel method using photocrosslinkable compositions which do not have the drawbacks of the aforementioned alternative compositions. In particular, the aim of the present invention is to provide a novel makeup method using photocrosslinkable compositions, preferably substantially free from (meth)acrylate monomers, which have a satisfactory stability and a high gloss in relation to the photocrosslinkable compositions currently available, notably those substantially free from (meth)acrylate monomers. The aim of the present invention is to provide a novel makeup method using photocrosslinkable compositions, preferably substantially free from (meth)acrylate monomers, which are easy to use. Another aim of the invention is to obtain photocrosslinkable compositions suitable for providing coats having the following properties: stability over time (with a mild etching or without any etching of the nail or false nail before applying the composition), easy makeup removal, high cosmeticity, outstanding makeup result (homogeneous deposition, easy to apply, comfortable to wear) and/or high gloss. The present invention relates to a makeup and/or care method of a nail and/or false nail, comprising the following steps: a) applying, onto a nail or false nail, a photocrosslinkable cosmetic composition C1 preferably comprising less than 10% by weight of (meth)acrylate monomer in relation to said composition C1, whereby a coat consisting of at least one layer of said composition C1 is deposited; the composition C1 comprising in a physiologically acceptable medium: at least one photocrosslinkable (meth)acrylate compound,at least one film-forming polymer P1 in a proportion greater than or equal to 10% by weight in relation to the dry extract weight of the composition C1,at least one volatile solvent S in a proportion greater than or equal to 30% in relation to the total weight of the composition C1, andat least one photoinitiator, b) exposing the coated nail or false nail obtained following step a) to UV or visible light radiation, whereby photocrosslinking is carried out to obtain a crosslinked layer C′1 c) applying, onto the nail or false nail coated with the crosslinked layer C′1, obtained following step b), a photocrosslinkable cosmetic composition C2 preferably comprising less than 10% by weight of (meth)acrylate monomer in relation to said composition C2, whereby a coat consisting of at least one layer of said composition C2 is deposited; the composition C2 comprising in a physiologically acceptable medium: at least one photocrosslinkable urethane di(meth)acrylate compound at a content by weight greater than or equal to 65% in relation to the total dry extract weight of C2, andat least one volatile solvent S′; d) exposing the coated nail or false nail obtained following step c) to UV or visible light radiation, whereby photocrosslinking is carried out to obtain a crosslinked layer C′2.

Advantageously, the mean number of (meth)acrylate functions borne by the photocrosslinkable urethane (meth)acrylate compound intended to form, after crosslinking, a crosslinked polymeric network, is greater than 1.

According to one preferred embodiment, the solvent S is ethyl acetate. Photoinitiator The composition C1 comprises at least one photoinitiator. It may comprise a single photoinitiator or a mixture of a plurality of photoinitiators. According to one embodiment, the composition C1 comprises two photoinitiators. The photoinitiators suitable for use according to the present invention are known in the art and are described, for example in “Les photoinitiateurs dans la réticulation des revêtements”, G. Li Bassi, Double Liaison —Chimie des Peintures, No. 361, November 1985, p. 34-41; “Applications industrielles de la polymerisation photoinduite”, Henri Strub, L'Actualité Chimique, February 2000, p. 5-13; and “Photopolymères: considerations théoriques et réaction de prise”, Marc, J. M. Abadie, Double Liaison —Chimie des Peintures, No. 435-436, 1992, p. 28-34. These photoinitiators include: α-hydroxyketones, marketed for example under the names DAROCUR® 1173 and 4265, IRGACURE® 184, 2959, and 500 by BASF, and ADDITOL® CPK by CYTEC,α-aminoketones, marketed for example under the names IRGACURE® 907 and 369 by BASF,aromatic ketones marketed for example under the name ESACURE® TZT by LAMBERTI. Mention may also be made of thioxanthones marketed for example under the name ESACURE® ITX by LAMBERTI, and quinones. These aromatic ketones generally require the presence of a hydrogen donor compound such as tertiary amines and particularly alkanolamines. Mention may particularly be made of the tertiary amine ESACURE® EDB marketed by LAMBERTI.α-dicarbonyl derivatives of which the most common is benzyl dimethyl ketal marketed under the name IRGACURE® 651 by BASF. Further commercial products are marketed by LAMBERTI under the name ESACURE® KB1, andacylphosphine oxides, such as for example bis-acylphosphine oxides (BAPO) marketed for example under the names IRGACURE® 819, 1700, and 1800, DAROCUR® 4265, LUCIRIN® TPO, and LUCIRIN® TPO-L by BASF. Preferably, the photoinitiator is chosen from the group consisting of α-hydroxyketones, α-aminoketones, aromatic ketones preferably associated with a hydrogen donor compound, aromatic α-diketones and acylphosphine oxides, and mixtures thereof. A mixture of photoinitiators absorbing light radiation at various wavelengths is preferably used in C1. The absorption spectrum of the photocrosslinkable composition can thus be adapted to the emission spectrum of the light sources used. Preferably, the composition C1 comprises a mixture of two different photoinitiators, such as for example a mixture of an α-hydroxyketone and an acylphosphine oxide. As a photoinitiator mixture, mention may be made of a mixture of IRGACURE® 184 (BASF) and LUCIRIN® TPO-L (BASF). A particular group of photoinitiators suitable for use in the composition C1 according to the present invention is that of copolymerizable photoinitiators. It consists of molecules comprising both a photoinitiator group capable of photoinduced radical splitting and at least one double ethylene bond. The photoinitiators in this group offer the advantage, in relation to the conventional photoinitiators listed above, of being suitable for being incorporated, via the double bond, into the macromolecular system. This possibility reduces the content of free residual photoinitiators not having undergone photoinduced radical splitting and thus enhances the safety of the layer of varnish. As examples of such copolymerizable photoinitiators, mention may be made of benzophenone acrylate derivatives marketed by CYTEC under the names EBECRYL® P36, EBECRYL® P37. In one preferred embodiment of the invention, polymer photoinitiators or photoinitiators bound onto a high molar mass molecule are used. The choice of such a high mass photoinitiator offers the same advantage as selecting only polymeric copolymerizable compounds, i.e. enhanced safety of the photocrosslinkable cosmetic compositions due to the absence of very reactive molecules liable to diffuse to neighboring biological substrates. The mean molar mass by weight of the photoinitiator is preferably at least equal to 500 g/mol. For example, mention may be made of an α-hydroxyketone oligomer corresponding to the following formula: and which is marketed under the name ESACURE® KIP 150 by LAMBERTI. The polymer on which the photoinitiator group is bound may optionally comprise one or a plurality of double ethylene bonds for optionally incorporating, into the macromolecular network, photoinitiator molecules not having undergone photoinduced splitting. As examples of such high molar mass photoinitiators bearing double ethylene bonds, mention may be made of those corresponding to the following formulae: These structures are described in the following articles: S. Knaus, Pure Appl. Chem., A33(7), 869 (1996); S. Knaus, J. Polym. Sci, Part A=Polym. Chem., 33, 929 (1995); and R. Liska, Rad'Tech Europe 97, Lyon, F, 1997, Conference Proceedings. The photoinitiator content is dependent on a large number of factors such as the reactivity of the various constituents of the mixture, the presence of pigments or dyes, the crosslinking density sought, the intensity of the light source or the exposure time. In order to obtain satisfactory mechanical properties, the photoinitiator(s) is (or are) preferably present in a total content greater than or equal to 0.1% by weight in relation to the total weight of the composition C1, preferably ranging from 1 to 5% by weight in relation to the total weight of the composition C1. Photocrosslinkable Urethane (Meth)Acrylate Compound The composition C2 comprises at least one photocrosslinkable urethane di(meth)acrylate compound.

The urethane di(meth)acrylate compounds of C2 are as defined above in relation to the composition C1.

The mass solvent S′ content is preferably between 10% and 30%, preferably between 15% and 25%. Preferably, S′ chosen from polar solvents. Preferably, this polar volatile solvent is chosen from the group consisting of C3-C6 esters and ketones and mixtures thereof.

Obviously, those skilled in the art will take care to choose these optional adjuvants or additives such that the advantageous properties of the composition according to the invention are not, or are practically not, altered by the envisaged addition. If the composition comprises pigments and/or dyes, it is particularly advisable to adapt the absorption spectrum of the pigments and/or dyes used to that of the photoinitiators, or conversely the absorption spectrum of the photoinitiators to that of the pigments and/or dyes used, so as to prevent both types of compounds from absorbing light at the same wavelengths. Indeed, the absorption of light by the pigments and/or dyes would render the photoinitiators present beyond a specific depth of the coat almost completely ineffective. The compositions C1 and C2 according to the invention may further comprise one or a plurality of plasticizers. According to one embodiment, these compositions comprise less than 15% by weight of plasticizer in relation to the total weight of said composition.

The radiation suitable for the crosslinking of the compositions C1 and C2 (steps b) and d) of the method according to the invention) have a wavelength between 210 nm and 600 nm, preferably between 250 nm and 420 nm, preferably between 350 nm and 410 nm. The use of lasers may also be envisaged. In one preferred embodiment of the invention, a LED lamp or an UV lamp and particularly a mercury vapor lamp, optionally doped with further elements, such as gallium, suitable for modifying the emission spectrum of the light source, is used. The exposure time of the deposited coat to radiation is dependent on various factors such as the chemical nature and content of the reactive compounds or the crosslinking density sought. For nail varnishes, it would generally be sought to obtain satisfactory results for an exposure time between 10 seconds and 10 minutes, preferably between 30 seconds and 5 minutes. Such a method may use a UV lamp having a power of approximately 36 W. Preferably, the thickness after drying the coat of photocrosslinkable composition deposited in step a) is less than or equal to 100 μm, preferably less than or equal to 50 μm. Preferably, the thickness of the coat of photocrosslinkable composition deposited in step c) ranges from 50 μm to 500 μm. Following the final crosslinking step, the coat deposited on the nail or false nail may have a tacky layer on the surface thereof requiring cleaning of the crosslinked coat using for example a solvent such as isopropanol. According to one embodiment, the method according to the invention further comprises, before steps b) and d), a period for drying the coat deposited following the respective steps a) and c), the duration whereof may vary from 10 seconds to 10 minutes, typically from 30 seconds to 5 minutes. Said drying is generally performed in air and at ambient temperature. A particular method according to the invention solely consists of steps a), b), c) and d) as defined above, optionally at an interval of a drying period as defined above. The crosslinked coats obtained from the crosslinking in steps b) and d) exhibit a significant stability over time, in terms of chipping resistance and gloss, particularly over the course of at least one week. They thus prove to be resistant to water, friction and shocks, and do not exhibit significant wear or chipping in this interval. These coats are also capable of being solubilized or increasing in volume and thus weight when placed in contact with a standard makeup removal solvent. This ability to be solubilized or swell, displayed by the crosslinked coat, is specifically advantageous for the removal thereof when applied onto the surface of a nail or false nail. Indeed, the coat may be removed readily merely by means of makeup removal using a conventional solvent. In this way, the compositions C1 and C2 are advantageously suitable for being removed using standard solvents used in the field of nail varnish, and particularly using acetone and ethyl acetate, and mixtures thereof. According to one embodiment, the method according to the invention may comprise intermediate steps between step b) and c). Step b) may be followed by a step for applying an optionally photocrosslinkable varnish composition, particularly a colored composition, onto the coated nail obtained following step b), followed if applicable by a step for exposing the nail obtained to UV or visible light radiation. Similarly, according to one embodiment, after the crosslinking step d), the coat deposited on the nail is coated with at least one colored composition and/or a finishing composition, also known as a “top-coat”, these compositions being optionally photocrosslinkable. In the way, step d) of the method according to the invention may be followed by application and UV or visible light radiation exposure steps. According to this embodiment, step d) may be followed by a step (or a plurality of steps) for applying an optionally photocrosslinkable composition, particularly a colored composition and/or a finishing composition, onto the coated nail obtained following step d), followed if applicable by a step for exposing the nail obtained to UV or visible light radiation. Step d) may thus be followed by application/exposure cycles. Similarly, such cycles may take place between steps b) and c). The present invention also relates to a kit comprising: a photocrosslinkable cosmetic composition C1 according to the invention,a photocrosslinkable cosmetic composition C2 according to the invention,an abrasive material having a granulometry greater than or equal to 200 μm, preferably less than 300 μm, advantageously comprised from 220 μm to 280 μm, anda LED lamp or an UV lamp. The present invention also relates to a makeup and/or care method of a nail and/or false nail, comprising the following steps: i) rubbing the surface of a nail or false nail with an abrasive material having a granulometry greater than or equal to 200 μm, preferably less than 300 μm, advantageously comprised from 220 μm to 280 μm,ii) applying a photocrosslinkable composition C1 according to the invention onto the surface of the nail or false nail which has been rubbed following step i), whereby a coat consisting of at least one layer of said photocrosslinkable composition C1 is deposited,iii) exposing the coated nail or false nail obtained following step ii) to a LED lamp or an UV lamp, whereby photocrosslinking is carried out to obtain a crosslinked layer C′1,iv) applying onto the nail or false nail coated with the crosslinked layer C′1, obtained following step iii), a photocrosslinkable composition C2 according to the invention, whereby a coat consisting of at least one layer of said photocrosslinkable composition C2 is deposited, andv) exposing the coated nail or false nail obtained following step iv) to a LED lamp or an UV lamp, whereby photocrosslinking is carried out to obtain a crosslinked layer C′2. Usually, the rubbing step is performed for less than 10 seconds, preferably less than 5 seconds, for example for approximately 3 seconds. Throughout the application, the term “comprising a” or “including a” means “comprising at least one” or “including at least one”, unless otherwise specified. The weight percentages given in this application can be considered equivalent to the dry weight percentage of the compounds used. The invention will be understood more clearly on reading the following description, given merely as an example.
