Step 1
3-((3-Methylisoxazol-5-yl)methyl)cyclohex-2-enone
3,5-Dimethylisoxazole (5.00 g, 51.5 mmol) was dissolved in anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (100 mL), n-butyllithium (62 mL, 3M n-hexane solution, 155 mmol) was added dropwise slowly at -78°C under nitrogen atmosphere, and the reaction solution was stirred at -78°C for 2 hours. 3-ethoxy-2-cyclohexen-1-one (7.22 g, 51.5 mmol) was slowly added and the stirring was continued for 1 hour. The reaction was quenched by the additon of water (100mL), and extracted with ethyl acetate (30 mL x 3). The organic phases were combined, washed successively with water (30 mL) and saturated sodium chloride solution (50 mL), dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered and the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure, and purified by silica gel column chromatography (5:1 petroleum ether / ethyl acetate, Rf = 0.4) to give 3-((3-methylisoxazol-5-yl)methyl)cyclohex-2-enone (5.10 g, as a yellow oil) with a yield of 52%.
