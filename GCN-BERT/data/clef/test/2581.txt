DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION [0030] FIG. 1A, IB and 1C show a "before' actuation and 'after' actuation side view of an embodiment (100) of an apparatus to assist paraplegics with getting dressed. [0031] Shown in FIG. 1A ("before' actuation) and in FIG. IB ('after' actuation) are at least one armpit rest (105), at least one lateral support (110), at least one vertical support (115), a rotational support (120), a rotational support affixment (125), a pivot support (130), a vertical adjustment device (135) and an armpit rest thickness (140). Shown additionally in FIG. IB are an armpit rest lobe (145), at least one approximately flat lateral side (150), an armpit rest edge (155) and an armpit rest lobe height (160). [0032] Embodiment (100) comprises at least one armpit rest (105) which has an armpit rest thickness (140), an armpit rest lobe (145), at least one approximately flat lateral side (150) and an armpit rest edge (155), and an armpit rest lobe height (160), with the armpit rest lobe height (160) being greater than the armpit rest thickness (140). [0033] Embodiment (100) also comprises at least one lateral support (110), a rotational support (120), a rotational support affixment (125). The at least one armpit rest (105) is securely attached to at least one lateral support (110), and which is securely attached to at least one vertical support (115). The rotational support (120) is securely attached to the at least one lateral support (110), with a portion of the rotational support (120) securely affixed to the rotational support affixment (125). Details of the rotational support (120) are shown in FIG. 2. [0034] The at least one armpit rest (105) is the focal point for the user. For one, at least one armpit rest (105) provides a secure place for the user to rest an armpit on the armrest while tending to dressing. More importantly, as described below, the at least one armpit rest (105) actively assists paraplegics with getting dressed. [0035] The at least one armpit rest (105) is typically a soft padding covered with a pliable yet durable material, with a strong support piece inside. The soft padding of the at least one armpit rest (105) may comprise open cell foam, closed foam or both. The pliable yet durable covering may be vinyl, leather or other pliable yet durable material. The strong support piece inside may be made of metal, wood, a plastic, or a composite. Other materials may suffice. The strong support piece inside may be fabricated into the soft padding as part of the at least one lateral support (110), as with injection molding, or if the strong support piece was sewn inside the at least one armpit rest (105). The at least one armpit rest (105) may be made of multiple materials assembled in layers. [0036] The at least one lateral support (110) secures the at least one armpit rest (105) relative to the user, to the rest of the apparatus and to the environment. Depending on structural needs, the at least one lateral support (110) may be made of metal, wood, a plastic, or a composite. Other materials may suffice. The at least one lateral support (110) may be hollow or, solid. The at least one lateral support (110) may be round, square, rectangular, or an any shape, including or channel-shaped as with "U" and "V" brackets or I-beams. As the primary function of the at least one lateral support (110) is to secure the at least one armpit rest (105) relative to the user, the material and shape of the at least one lateral support (110) may be any material or shape fulfilling this function. For comfort, ease or cost of manufacture or assembly, the at least one lateral support (110) may have one or more materials or shapes at some portion, and one or more same or different materials or shapes at other portions of the at least one lateral support (110). In some embodiments, the at least one lateral support (110) is a rod or tube affixed at one end (as with a strong support piece inside) to the at least one armpit rest (105) and is affixed at the other end to the at least one vertical support (115). [0037] Some embodiments may include at least one vertical support (115). The at least one vertical support (115) secures the at least one lateral support (110) relative to the user, the rest of the apparatus and to the environment. Representative forms of the embodiments are shown in FIG. 3, 4, 5 and 6. [0038] The at least one vertical support (115) may be made of metal, wood, a plastic, or a composite. Other materials may suffice. The at least one vertical support (115) may be may be a wall. The at least one vertical support (115) may be one or more of a hollow or solid material, a plate, or one or more channel-shaped brackets, including "U" and "V" brackets, or I-beams. As the primary function of the at least one vertical support (115) is to secure the at least one lateral support (110) relative to the user, the material and shape of the at least one vertical support (115) may be any material or shape fulfilling this function. For comfort, ease or cost of manufacture or assembly, the at least one vertical support (115) may have one or more materials or shapes at some portion, and one or more same or different materials or shapes at other portions of the at least one vertical support (115). [0039] Embodiment (100) may be positioned to allow a user to sit on a seating fixture as shown in FIG. 3, 4 or 6. embodiment (100) also may be positioned relative to existing fixtures in a home, office, restroom, care facility, or other locations. Representative forms of the embodiments are shown in FIG. 3, 4, 5 and 6. [0040] The apparatus also comprises a rotational support (120). The rotational support (120) is capable of allowing the at least one armpit rest (105) to rotate radially (clockwise and counter-clockwise), and storing energy from the rotation. The rotational support (120) comprises at least one energy storage device (220) affixed to the at least one lateral support (110) and the at least one energy storage device (220) is capable of storing and releasing energy sufficient to rotate the at least one armpit rest (105) from the approximately vertical position to the approximately horizontal position. The rotational support (120) may be any mechanism capable of capable of allowing the at least one armpit rest (105) to rotate relative to the environment, which may be the at least one vertical support (115). FIG. 2 shows the rotational support (120) in detail. [0041] The rotational support (120) is attached at least at one location to the at least one lateral support (110), and is secured at another location relative to the at least one lateral support (110). In some embodiments, the rotational support (120) is secured to or within the at least one vertical support (115). FIG. 2A, 2B and FIG. 6 show examples of how the rotational support (120) may be secured. [0042] Comparing FIG. 1 A and FIG IB, FIG. 1 A represents the apparatus in a default position in which the at least one armpit rest (105) is horizontal with the armpit rest lobe (145) of the at least one armpit rest (105) horizontal, and at least one approximately flat lateral side (150) of the at least one armpit rest (105) facing the vertical. The at least one approximately flat lateral side (150) should be approximately flat or even substantially flat so the user is both comfortable, and not affected by differences on height caused by a surface that is not approximately flat. The limitation of approximately flat does not, however, exclude uneven surfaces which may have one or more pillow-like rises or ridges. Rather, the at least one approximately flat lateral side (150) should have a surface characteristic so that the user's armpit is higher above a seating fixture when on the armpit rest lobe (145) then when the user is supported on the at least one approximately flat lateral side (150). [0043] As shown in FIG. IB, the at least one lateral support (110) separates the at least one approximately flat lateral side (150) into two virtual halves. One half comprises an armpit rest lobe (145), and a half comprising an armpit rest edge (155). As shown in FIG. 1A, a downward force applied to the armpit rest edge (155) of the at least one approximately flat lateral side (150) causes the at least one armpit rest (105) to rotate, which being successful, moves the armpit rest lobe (145) of the at least one armpit rest (105) to vertical. The at least one approximately flat lateral side (150) of the at least one armpit rest (105) then faces the horizontal, as shown in FIG. IB. [0044] As the armpit rest lobe height (160) of the armpit rest lobe (145) of the at least one armpit rest (105) is dimensionally greater than the armpit rest thickness (140) of the at least one approximately flat lateral side (150), the at least one armpit rest (105) effectively raises the user upwards by the difference between armpit rest thickness (140) and armpit rest lobe height (160). FIG. 3 and 4 also show the differences in height. In some embodiments, the armpit rest lobe (145) is concave. In some embodiments, the armpit rest lobe (145) comprises an armpit cavity (545) approximately sized for a human armpit. In some embodiments, the armpit rest lobe (145) is approximately flat. In some embodiments, the armpit rest edge (155) is convex. [0045] As the at least one armpit rest (105) rotates, it also transfers the rotational forces to the at least one lateral support (110), which transfers the rotational forces to the rotational support (120), which stores those forces as energy in the rotational support (120). [0046] When the user releases the downward force on the armpit rest edge (155), the stored energy in the rotational support (120) is transferred back through the at least one lateral support (110). The at least one armpit rest (105) rotates to the default position, and lowers the user down to the seating fixture. [0047] Some embodiments may comprise a pivot support (130) capable of allowing the at least one lateral support (110) to pivot relative to the at least one vertical support (115). In some embodiments, the pivot support (130) is part of the at least one vertical support (115). In some embodiments, the pivot support (130) may be a hinge. [0048] Some embodiments may comprise a vertical adjustment device (135) capable of vertically adjusting the at least one armpit rest (105). In some embodiments, the vertical adjustment device (135) may comprise the at least one vertical support (115) having inter- sliding channels, i.e., square, U or V shapes are typical, which may be un-affixed and affixed to adjust the vertical position of the at least one armpit rest (105). [0049] In some embodiments, the vertical adjustment device (135) may comprise a thumb screw through a hollow penetration of a plate, channel, bracket or tube affixed to the at least one vertical support (115) for adjusting the vertical position of the at least one armpit rest (105). [0050] In some embodiments, the vertical adjustment device (135) may comprise a pin, split pin, cotter pin, non-threaded bolt, etc., removed from a hollow penetration of a plate, channel, bracket or tube affixed to the at least one vertical support (115) for adjusting the vertical position of the at least one armpit rest (105). [0051] In some embodiments, the vertical adjustment device (135) may comprise a bracket affixed to the at least one lateral support (110) so that an adjustment of the vertical position of the at least one lateral support (110) adjusts the vertical position of the at least one armpit rest (105). [0052] In some embodiments, the vertical adjustment device (135) may comprise a jack screw affixed to the at least one vertical support (115) or to the at least one lateral support (110). One or more jack screws may be used. [0053] An embodiment with one of the at least one lateral support (110) could have one vertical adjustment device (135), while an embodiment with a plurality of the at least one lateral support (110) might have more than one vertical adjustment device (135), though, an interconnected set of the at least one lateral support (110) could have one vertical adjustment device (135) securely attached to the plurality of the at least one lateral support (110). [0054] FIG. 1C shows a reduced detail "before' actuation and 'after' actuation front view of an embodiment (100) of an apparatus to assist paraplegics with getting dressed. Shown in FIG. 1C are the at least one armpit rest (105), the at least one lateral support (110), the armpit rest thickness (140), the armpit rest lobe (145), at least one approximately flat lateral side (150), the armpit rest edge (155) and the armpit rest lobe height (160). [0055] As shown and described in FIG 1 A, the default position of the at least one armpit rest (105) is in an approximately horizontal position, 'before' actuation, with the at least one approximately flat lateral side (150) facing upwards in an approximately vertical position. In this configuration, a user may place an arm over the at least one approximately flat lateral side (150) of the at least one armpit rest (105) with the armpit adjacent to the armpit rest lobe (145). As indicated by the armpit rest thickness (140), the user's armpit, and thus the arm, is just that distance above the centerline of the at least one lateral support (110). [0056] The user then presses the arm down over the armpit rest edge (155). This force causes the at least one armpit rest (105) to rotate approximately ninety degrees, clockwise in this view. The user's arm and armpit are then raised as the at least one armpit rest (105) rotates. The user's arm and armpit are then elevated to the height of the armpit rest lobe (145), which is represented by the armpit rest lobe height (160). [0057] The at least one approximately flat lateral side (150) now faces an approximately horizontal position, and the armpit rest lobe (145) faces an approximately vertical position. More importantly, the user is lifted the distance from a line at the armpit rest thickness (140) to a line at the armpit rest lobe height (160), and thus up off of whatever the user was sitting on. [0058] FIG. 2A and 2B show a detail view of the rotational support (120) for an embodiment (200) of an apparatus to assist paraplegics with getting dressed. FIG. 2A shows the rotational support (120) secured to the at least one vertical support (115). FIG. 2B shows the rotational support (120) secured within the at least one vertical support (115). [0059] Shown in FIG. 2A and 2B are the at least one lateral support (110, for reference), a rotational support body (205), a first at least one lateral support constraint (210), a lateral support affixment (215), at least one energy storage device (220), a rotational support first end (225), a rotational support second end (230), and as described below, a second at least one lateral support constraint (235). [0060] The rotational support body (205) secures the components of the rotational support (120) in relative position within the rotational support body (205). The rotational support body (205) may be made of metal, wood, a plastic, or a composite. Other materials may suffice. Though shown as cylindrical, the rotational support body (205) may be any shape. In some embodiments, the rotational support body (205) is triangular and may also serve as a diagonal support for the at least one lateral support (110). See FIG. 5. [0061] The first at least one lateral support constraint (210) serves as a stability point for the at least one lateral support (110) within the rotational support body (205). The first at least one lateral support constraint (210) reduces wobble to provide rotational stability to the at least one lateral support (110). While some embodiments may suffice with one lateral support constraint, the risk of injury because of wobble suggests that two lateral support constraints are safer. The first at least one lateral support constraint (210) may be made of metal, wood, a plastic, or a composite, so long as the first at least one lateral support constraint (210) allows the at least one lateral support (110) to rotate and to have stability with respect to the other components during use. Other materials may suffice. In some embodiments, the at least one lateral support (110) is securely affixed to the rotational support (120). In some embodiments, the at least one lateral support (110) is securely affixed within the rotational support (120). In some embodiments, the at least one lateral support constraint is a bushing. In some embodiments, the at least one lateral support constraint is a bearing. [0062] The lateral support affixment (215) constrains the at least one energy storage device (220) to the at least one lateral support (110) at which to transfer the rotational energy from the at least one armpit rest (105) to the at least one energy storage device (220). The lateral support affixment (215) is mated by form and specific function to transfer the rotational energy from the at least one armpit rest (105). In some embodiments, the lateral support affixment (215) comprises a hollow penetration on the at least one lateral support (110) for accepting the a rotational support first end (225). In some embodiments, the lateral support affixment (215) may a clamp, weldment, or other affixment on the at least one lateral support (110) at which to affix the at least one lateral support (110) to the at least one energy storage device (220). [0063] The at least one energy storage device (220) functions to accept, store, and return the energy from the rotation of the at least one lateral support (110) by the rotation of the at least one armpit rest (105). The at least one energy storage device (220) typically has an elastic property capable of accepting, storing, and returning the energy from the rotation of the at least one lateral support (110). In some embodiments, the at least one energy storage device (220) is a spring. In some embodiments, the at least one energy storage device (220) is a torsion bar. In some embodiments, the at least one energy storage device (220) is a ratchet. In some embodiments, the at least one energy storage device (220) is a cam and detent. The detent may be released manually or automatically. [0064] In some embodiments, the at least one energy storage device (220) has a rotational support first end (225) on one end for affixing the at least one energy storage device (220) to the at least one lateral support (110). In some embodiments, the at least one energy storage device (220) has a rotational support second end (230) at an opposing end for affixing the at least one energy storage device (220) in relative position within the rotational support body (205). Though the rotational support first end (225) and the rotational support second end (230) could be closer than on opposing ends of at least one energy storage device (220), the amount of energy a spring is capable of receiving and delivering is a function of the number of energy absorbing parts (typically coils) between the rotational support first end (225) and the rotational support second end (230). The at least one energy storage device (220) may be made of any material capable of receiving, storing, and delivering the energy of rotation from the at least one lateral support (110). Typical materials include metals, i.e., steel or aluminum and their alloys. The at least one energy storage device (220) may also be made of other elastic materials, including a plastic. [0065] The rotational support first end (225) constrains the at least one energy storage device (220) within the rotational support body (205) during rotation of at least one lateral support (110), and transfers the energy of the rotation to the at least one energy storage device (220). The rotational support first end (225) is typically an integral portion of the at least one energy storage device (220), and made of the same material. Typical materials for the rotational support first end (225) include metals, i.e., steel or aluminum and their alloys. The rotational support first end (225) may also be made of other elastic materials, including a plastic. [0066] In some embodiments, the rotational support first end (225) may be made of another material and attached to the at least one energy storage device (220) via an alternate technology. The attachment may be mechanical, including via a clamp, thermal as by welding, or chemical, as generated by a solvent. [0067] The rotational support second end (230) constrains the at least one energy storage device (220) relative to the rotational support body (205) so that at least one energy storage device (220) does not rotate with the at least one lateral support (110) when the at least one lateral support (110) is rotated by the at least one armpit rest (105). The rotational support second end (230) constrains the at least one energy storage device (220) from rotation relative to the rotational support body (205) by being constrained relative to the rotational support body (205) by the rotational support affixment (125). In some embodiments, the rotational support second end (230) may be constrained by the rotational support affixment (125) through a hollow penetration in the rotational support affixment (125). In some embodiments, the rotational support second end (230) may be clamped to the rotational support affixment (125). In some embodiments, the rotational support second end (230) may be welded to the rotational support affixment (125). In some embodiments, the rotational support second end (230) may be secured through a hollow penetration through the at least one vertical support (115). See FIG. 2B. [0068] The rotational support second end (230) is typically an integral portion of the at least one energy storage device (220), and made of the same material. Typical materials for the rotational support second end (230) include metals, i.e., steel or aluminum and their alloys. The rotational support second end (230) may also be made of other elastic materials, including a plastic. [0069] In some embodiments, rotational support second end (230) may be made of another material and attached to the at least one energy storage device (220) to or the rotational support affixment (125) via an alternate technology. The attachment may be mechanical, including via a clamp, thermal as by welding, or chemical, as generated by a solvent. [0070] In some embodiments, a second at least one lateral support constraint (235) may be used to serve as an additional stability point for the at least one lateral support (110) within the rotational support body (205). The second at least one lateral support constraint (235) provides additional wobble-less rotational stability to the at least one lateral support (110). The second at least one lateral support constraint (235) may be made of metal, wood, a plastic, or a composite, so long as the second at least one lateral support constraint (235) allows the at least one lateral support (110) to rotate and to have stability with respect to the other component user during use. Other materials may suffice. [0071] FIG. 3 shows a side view of an embodiment (300) of an apparatus about to assist paraplegics with getting dressed. FIG. 3 represents FIG. 1 A, with an addition of user Ά', a relatively immovably support (305), which is relatively immovably in this embodiment due to an attachment to a floor (310), a seating fixture (315), and a first height (320) of A's armpit above a seating fixture (315). [0072] As with FIG. 1A, at least one armpit rest (105) is securely attached to at least one lateral support (110), which is attached to a rotational support (120) as shown FIG. 2A, which is secured relative to user A', here by being attached to the at least one vertical support (115). [0073] To use the apparatus, a user gets into position beside the at least one lateral support (110), with the arms out horizontally, and puts the user's armpit over the at least one armpit rest (105). With the at least one armpit rest (105) under the arm pit, the user's armpit is at a first height (320) of A's armpit with respect to the seating fixture (315), i.e., to A's buttocks on the seating fixture (315). [0074] The arm is then lowered. As the arm(s) lower, the arm(s) press on the armpit rest edge (155) (shown in FIG. 1A) of the at least one approximately flat lateral side (150) (shown in FIG. IB) on the upper side of the at least one armpit rest (105), which turns from a horizontal position to a vertical position, as shown in FIG. 4. [0075] FIG. 4 shows a perspective view of an embodiment (400) of the apparatus assisting a paraplegic with getting dressed. While FIG. 3 represents FIG. 1A with additions, FIG. 4 represents FIG. IB, with the FIG. 3 additions of user A', the relatively immovably support (305), and showing the first height (320) of A's armpit above the seating fixture (315) as in FIG. 3. [0076] Shown in FIG. 4 in addition to the structure shown in FIG. IB and FIG. 3, are a second height (405) of A's armpit above the seating fixture (315), and a lift distance (410). [0077] Continuing the discussion from FIG. 3, pressing on the armpit rest edge (155) causes a rotation of the at least one armpit rest (105), which turns the armpit rest lobe (145) to an approximately vertical position, and the at least one approximately flat lateral side (150) to an approximately horizontal position. [0078] Consequently, instead of user 'A's armpit being at the first height (320) of A's armpit above the seating fixture (315), user A's armpit has been raised to the second height (405) of A's armpit above the seating fixture (315). The difference between the armpit rest thickness (140) and the armpit rest lobe height (160) results in a lift distance (410), which is the difference in height between the first height (320)of A's armpit above the seating fixture (315) and the second height (405) of A's armpit above the seating fixture (315). [0079] By raising A' by the lift distance (410) above the seating fixture (315), A' is freed from contact with the seating fixture (315), A' may now put on or remove pants, or both. [0080] FIG. 5 shows a perspective view of an embodiment (500) of an apparatus to assist paraplegics with getting dressed. [0081] Shown in FIG. 5 are at least one armpit rest (505), at least one lateral support (510), at least one vertical support (515), a rotational support (520), a rotational support affixment (525), a pivot support (530), a vertical adjustment device (535), an armpit rest lobe (e.g., 145) approximately sized as an armpit cavity (545) for a human armpit, at least one approximately flat lateral side (550), a relatively immovably support (565), at least one diagonal support (570), a horizontal frame (575), a movable base (580), a plurality of wheels (585), and a horizontal frame pivot (590).
