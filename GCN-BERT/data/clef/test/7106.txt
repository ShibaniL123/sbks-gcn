BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a novel form contouring garment, more specifically, a body contouring lingerie which is easily put on, has elastic and nonelastic portions to correct body forms and color contrasted from each other to correct body forms and provide an illusion of slimness. 2. Related Background Art Girdles made of elastic materials have been worn as undergarments for use in figure-correcting. Using a girdle corrects a wearer's figure by compressing each part of his/her body. Also, as part of the growing figure-correcting industry, products which further comprise materials such as a reinforced cloth, and the like, having strong elasticity intensively at a specific part, are sold on the market. However, girdles are undergarments and are very inconvenient to wear for a long time. Moreover, keeping body parts intensively compressed can be harmful to the body. Many obese or out of shape people of the opposite sex need a garment that can augment their sex appeal without necessarily compressing their bodies beyond their comfort zones. Excessive compression of the body for shape appeal presents numerous problems. It can put the wearer under mental stress, raise their blood pressure, cause shoulder stiffness, affect blood circulation, and could disfigure internal organs among many drawbacks. Unfortunately, many out of shape people would rather deal with the risk of excessive body compression than the loss of sex appeal and self esteem in being seen to be out of shape. Many obese and out of shape ladies have a morbid fear of being seen in their natural form by potential partners until the relationship has deepened for fear their figures might be a game changer. Girdles of many sizes and compression levels are sold in the market. Usually, a wearer can adjust a compression level of the girdle by pulling both ends of the elastic strip with his/her desired strength and fixing the strip on an elastic cloth sewn on an inside surface of a front side of the girdle body, and thus a figure-correcting effect is achieved regardless of figures or demands. Typically, girdles are geared towards correcting the size of the abdominal region, leaving the rest of the body uncorrected. In other words, while girdles can correct certain regions of the body, they typically do not contour the whole body. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION One purpose of the present invention is to overcome the above-described problems and to provide a comfortable, whole-body form contouring lingerie which can be worn as an outer garment or inner garment and usable for whole body contouring without excessive compression of body parts. Another purpose of the present invention is to provide a whole body form contouring lingerie in which the size of the form contouring lingerie is freely adjustable to fit a wearer's figure. Another purpose of the invention is to create an augmented appearance of slimness in addition to body contouring by providing bilateral color contrasts between the elastic and nonelastic portions of the lingerie when the form contouring lingerie is disposed about the wearer. Furthermore, another purpose of the present invention is to provide a form contouring lingerie that has neither tightness nor air-tightness at a wearer's crotch area and can be worn as a body suit.

These portions each comprise the laterally and medially disposed elastic and nonelastic members having contrasting colors. These members are preferably formed integral and continuous from a single cut of cloth or may be integrally sewn together from different pieces of cloth of the same color having different elasticities. These portions each comprise the laterally and medially disposed elastic and nonelastic members having contrasting colors. The form contouring lingerie according to the present invention comprises a left 30 and a right 32 laterally disposed members having a front medially disposed member 34 and a rear medially disposed member that are releasably connected to each other by the front and rear medially disposed members, wherein the laterally disposed members have a different color from the medially disposed members and wherein the laterally disposed members and the medially disposed members form a one piece shape forming inner or outer garment. In another embodiment, the laterally disposed members 30 and 32 are elastic while the medially disposed members 34 and 36 are inelastic. In another embodiment, the laterally disposed members 30 and 32 are inelastic and the medially disposed members 34 and 36 are inelastic. In yet another embodiment, the laterally disposed members 30 and 32 have different elasticities from the medially disposed members 34 and 36. A fastenerner (not shown) is disposed on any portion of the form contouring lingerie in order to facilitate wearing of the lingerie. In a strapless embodiment of the lingerie, a fastener need not be used depending on the cut of the neck encircling portion 12. In a fully sleeved embodiment of the lingerie (FIG. 1), a fastener running from the back of the neck encircling portion towards the hips may be used. In yet another embodiment, a fastener may be placed on any one of the laterally disposed members. The placement of the fastener is left to the discretion of the designer and this invention is not limited by such placement. Preferably, the fastener is placed when necessary on portions of the lingerie making it easy for the wearer to remove or wear it without help from someone else. In another embodiment of the form contouring lingerie according to the present invention, the lateral members have a different shade of color from the medially disposed members. Preferably, the laterally disposed members have the same color and the medially disposed members have the same color but the laterally disposed members have a different shade of color from the medially disposed members. Most preferably, the laterally disposed members have colors akin to human skin colors and are preferably made of materials that mimic human skin in color and texture. The medially disposed members have contrasting colors from the laterally disposed members. Most preferably the medially disposed members have a lighter shade of the colors of the laterally disposed members. In one embodiment, the medially disposed members is a translucent material having a lighter shade of color from the laterally disposed members. The length of the sleeves and the leg encircling portion are left to the discretion of the designer but it is understood that the invention is not limited to the sleeve length or the length of the leg encircling portions. It is also up to the designer's discretion to chose the cut of the neck; and in the case of women, to have an insewn or integral breast cups as part of the breast encircling portion 16. In other words, a form contouring lingerie and a brassiere can be formed of one piece to provide an all-in-one style garment. In another embodiment, the front medially disposed member 34 is made of translucent material. In yet another embodiment, the hip encircling portion 20 may be provided with an insewn or integral crotch covers. Preferably, whenever provided the breast cups or the crotch covers have the same shade of color as the medially disposed members. It is also understood that figure enhancement can be produced by cutting the materials to vary the tension in the different portions, and the tension or elasticity of the lateral members or the medial members need not be the same across the entire body. Such variable tension and shape enhancement can be sewn into the different portions using extra elastic materials disposed at any other positions of the front sides, the back side, and the thigh portions of the form contouring lingerie according to the present invention. Clothing materials for figure contouring having a tension and elasticity, and the effect of separately contouring individual parts of a body of a wearer may include the same material with different elasticities, or may include textiles or fabrics made of fibers containing rubber or spandex. The fastening member can be any material able to control tension or relaxation, and a fixed position after fastening must be held unless the wearer detaches the member. Materials that meet these qualifications include a hook, a snap, a button, a zipper, a surface fastener, and the like, for instance. A fastening member is not always necessary if the wearer can easily slide in and out of the neck encircling region. In another embodiment, a haunch lifting material (not shown) is disposed in the shoulder encircling and breast encircling portions and is effective in use to lift up a wearer's haunch. Preferably, reinforcing members may also be sewn into the inside surfaces of the encircling portion. Materials of the reinforcing members are not limited as long as the material produces differentially more tension than the underlying material in order to firm up the portion being contoured. It is preferred that the laterally disposed members and the medially disposed members are symmetrically positioned with respect to a central vertical line of an abdomen part of a wearer so that burdens to the body of the wearer produced by elasticity of material and compression of the form contouring lingerie according to the present invention are evenly loaded to the left and right sides of the body of the wearer. The elasticity and cut of the elastic members bring out their figure-correcting functions, with optional insewn tensioners or stretch fabrics for reinforcement made of clothing with different degree of elasticities sewn into the abdominal and hips portions. Materials used for the form contouring lingerie according to the present invention, with the form contouring lingerie being constructed by the left and right lateral members and the front and rear medial members include fabrics that are elastic in one horizontal direction from side to side of the form contouring lingerie , or two directions, or rather multi-directions. Also, non-elastic fabrics can be used in accordance with the invention. For example, the materials can include a satin-type power net, a satin-type tricot, a raschel textile containing elastic fabric, a power net containing elastic fabric, a tricot containing elastic fabric, and the like. The foregoing descriptions are about embodiments of the form contouring lingerie according to the present invention, but the present invention is not limited to these embodiments. Still other variety of improvements, modifications and corrections can be made by a person skilled in the art without departing from a purpose of the present invention. Furthermore, the form contouring lingerie according to the present invention can independently correct each body part of a wearer by disposing a cloth, constructed from a textile containing an elastic fabric, on a prescribed portion of the laterally disposed and medially disposed members. Moreover, although the foregoing descriptions aim at figure-correcting functions, the form contouring lingerie according to the present invention can effectively decrease and prevent muscular exhaustion because a muscle supporting function is also effectively brought out by disposing a textile containing an elastic fiber along fibers of the muscle. Furthermore, the form contouring lingerie can effectively prevent and ease back pains. An effect of preventing and easing back pains is achieved by disposing a textile containing an elastic fiber having a support function, on the back side and/or on a part of the hips encircling region on a strip of the form contouring lingerie according to the present invention, or by further combining a board, made of a resin as a supporting member, with the textile. 1.
