(6S,8R)-6-(5-bromopyridin-2-yl)-1-fluoro-8-methyl-7-(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-3H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]isoquinoline
Trifluroacetic acid (87 μL) was added to a solution of (R)-1-(3-fluoro-1H-indazol-4-yl)-N-(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)propan-2-amine (100 mg, 0.36 mmol) and 5-bromopicolinaldehyde (67.6 mg, 0.36 mmol) in toluene (0.87 mL) and the resulting mixture was stirred at 90° C. for 1 hour. The reaction was allowed to cool to room temperature and partitioned between DCM (5 mL) and saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate (5 mL). The layers were separated and the organic layer was concentrated in vacuo. Purification was by silica gel column chromatography eluting with 0-50% ethyl acetate in heptane to give (6S,8R)-6-(5-bromopyridin-2-yl)-1-fluoro-8-methyl-7-(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-3H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]isoquinoline (89 mg, 55%) as a white solid.
