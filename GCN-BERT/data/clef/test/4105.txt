Preparation of N-allyl-2-chloro-N-(2-cyano-4-fluorophenyl)-5-nitrobenzamide (C139)
To a solution of 2-chloro-N-(2-cyano-4-fluorophenyl)-5-nitrobenzamide (C152) (0.200 g, 0.626 mmol) in tetrahydrofuran (6.3 mL) cooled in an ice bath was added sodium hydride (60% oil immersion, 0.030 g, 0.75 mmol). The slurry was stirred for 30 minutes, and allyl bromide (0.081 mL, 0.94 mmol) was added. The reaction mixture was stirred for 18 hours. The reaction was quenched by the slow addition of water (10 mL) and diluted with ethyl acetate (10 mL). The organic layer was dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated. Purification by flash column chromatography using 0-25% ethyl acetate/hexanes as eluent provided the title compound as a mixture of amide rotamers as an off-white solid (0.162 g, 68%): Major isomer-1H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3) δ 8.31 (d, J=2.7 Hz, 1H), 8.05 (dd, J=8.8, 2.7 Hz, 1H), 7.42 (d, J=8.8 Hz, 1H), 7.40 (s, 1H), 7.30 (dd, J=7.4, 2.9 Hz, 1H), 7.20 (ddd, J=8.9, 7.5, 3.0 Hz, 1H), 5.99 (ddt, J=17.0, 10.1, 6.7 Hz, 1H), 5.30-5.17 (m, 2H), 4.89 (dd, J=14.6, 6.0 Hz, 1H), 4.29 (dd, J=14.6, 7.5 Hz, 1H); 19F NMR (471 MHz, CDCl3) δ −108.13 (q, J=6.9 Hz); ESIMS m/z 360 ([M+H]+).
