NOVEL ANTIVIRAL COMPOUNDS AND METHODS USING SAME CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS The present application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. § 1 19(e) to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/972,842, filed March 31, 2014, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety herein. STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT This invention was made with government support under grant numbers All 02104 and AI057168 awarded by National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (National Institutes of Health). The government has certain rights in the invention. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Filoviruses, such as Ebola (EBOV) and Marburg (MARV), arenaviruses, such as Lassa fever (LFV) and Junin (JUNV), and rhabdoviruses, such as vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and rabies virus (RABV), are enveloped RNA viruses that can cause severe disease in humans and animals. For example, filovirus and arenavirus infections can result in hemorrhagic syndromes with high mortality rates in humans, and as such, these viruses are classified as NIAID Category A priority pathogens (Feldmann et al, 1996. Filoviruses. In Baron S (ed.), Medical Microbiology, 4th Ed, Galveston (TX); Feldmann et al, 1996, Adv. Virus Res. 47: 1-52; Grant et al, 2012, Viruses 4:2317-2339; Peters et al, 1989, Rev. Infect. Dis. 1 1 Suppl 4:S743-749). There are currently no FDA-approved vaccines or therapeutics to control infection and transmission of EBOV, MARV and JUNV, and the FDA-approved drug to treat LVF (ribavirin) has low efficacy in treating the disease. The matrix proteins of filoviruses (VP 40), arenaviruses (Z), and rhabdoviruses (M) are highly abundant and play key roles in promoting virus assembly and egress (Hartlieb et al, 2006, Virol. 344:64-70; Jasenosky et al, 2004, Virus Res. 106: 181-188; Liu et al, 2010, Future Virol. 5:481-491). For example, independent expression of EBOV or MARV VP 40 leads to the production of virus-like particles (VLPs) that accurately mimic the morphology and budding characteristics of live infectious virus (Hartlieb et al, 2006, Virol. 344:64-70; Jasenosky et al, 2004, Virus Res. 106: 181-188; Liu et al, 2010, Future Virol. 5:481-491). A common feature of these various viral matrix proteins is the presence of one or more motifs referred to as Late (L) budding domains. The conservation of L-domains within the matrix proteins of filoviruses, arenaviruses, rhabdoviruses, paramyxoviruses, and retroviruses suggests that they are generally important and required for efficient RNA virus budding (8). Viral L-domains recruit host ESCRT (endosomal sorting complex required for transport) complexes to mediate efficient virus-cell separation (or "pinching-off '), and consist of core consensus amino acid motifs such as PPxY, P(T/S)AP (PTAP), YxxL, or FPIV (x is any amino acid). Viral L-domain/host interactions are important for efficient virus egress and spread. For example, the PPxY motif mediates interactions with WW-domains within mammalian E3 ubiquitin ligase neural precursor cell expressed developmentally down- regulated protein 4 ("Nedd4") to facilitate virus egress. Nedd4 is associated with the ESCRT machinery and mono-ubiquitinates ESCRT proteins as well as viral matrix proteins (Liu et ah, 2010, Future Virol. 5:481-491). A functional PPxY motif is present in the matrix proteins of EBOV, MARV, VSV, RABV, LFV, and others. Thus, recruitment of host proteins such as Nedd4 by viral L-domains represents a broad-spectrum target for the identification and advancement of antiviral drugs hypothesized to dampen virus egress from infected cells, thereby reducing virus dissemination and disease progression. There is an unmet need for the identification and development of potent, broad-spectrum antiviral agents, particularly those that can target high priority pathogens for which no current treatments are available. In particular, there is an unmet need for the development of safe and effective therapeutics against biodefense and high priority viral pathogens, including filoviruses (e.g., Ebola and Marburg) and arenaviruses (e.g., Lassa fever and Junin), which cause severe hemorrhagic fever syndromes with high mortality rates. The present invention addresses and meets these needs. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The invention provides compounds, or salts or solvates thereof.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS For the purpose of illustrating the invention, there are depicted in the drawings certain embodiments of the invention. However, the invention is not limited to the precise arrangements and instrumentalities of the embodiments depicted in the drawings. Fig. 1 is a non-limiting illustration of a strategy contemplated within the invention for identifying PPxY budding inhibitors. The flow chart illustrates an in silico screen and SAR analysis to identify inhibitors of the viral PPxY-host Nedd4 interaction and PPxY-mediated budding. The in silico screen involved computational docking with AutoDock 4.0, energy minimization using CHARMM with the MMFF force field, and ranking with Accelrys LigScore2 of 4.8 million drug-like compounds from the ZINC database. The top 20 scoring compounds were tested as indicated leading to the identification of the lead 1. The lead 1 was dissected into two fragments and twenty commercially available compounds having these two fragment substructures (ten compounds from each) were evaluated. Two compounds (2 and 3), one from each substructure search, were found to be more potent than 1. Compound 4 showed improved potency over SAR analog 2, and 5 showed improved potency over SAR analog 3. Compound 6 is a control compound. Figs. 2A-2B illustrate the effect of 1 on PPxY-dependent budding of MARV VP40 VLPs and live VSV.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to the unexpected discovery that the compounds of the invention are antiviral agents. In one aspect, the compounds of the invention interfere with viral budding. In certain embodiments, the compounds of the invention interfere with the interaction of the host Nedd4 E3 ubiquitin ligase and at least one viral budding domain. In other embodiments, the compounds of the invention disrupt or hamper virus budding. In yet other embodiments, the compounds of the invention prevent or hamper virus dissemination. In yet other embodiments, the compounds of the invention block viral disease progression and/or transmission. In certain embodiments, the compounds of the invention treat or prevent a viral infection in a subject. In other embodiments, the viral infection is caused by at least one single strand RNA virus. In yet other embodiments, the infection is caused by at least one virus selected from the group consisting of a filovirus (such as, but not limited to, Ebola or Marburg virus), arenavirus (such as, but not limited to, Lassas fever virus), rhaddovirus (such as, but not limited to, rabies, vesicular stomatitis, or emerging lyssavirus), paramyxovirus (such as, but not limited to, Nipah or Hendra virus), retrovirus (such as, but not limited to, HIV-1, HrV-2, or human T-cell leukemia virus, also known as HTLV-1), and any combinations thereof. In other embodiments, the subject is a mammal. As described herein, budding of filoviruses, arenaviruses, and rhabdoviruses is facilitated by subversion of host proteins, such as Nedd4 E3 ubiquitin ligase, by viral PPxY late (L) budding domains expressed within the matrix proteins of these RNA viruses. As L domains are important for budding and are highly conserved in a wide array of RNA viruses, they represent potential broad-spectrum targets for the development of antiviral drugs. Without wishing to be limited by any theory, the Nedd4 WW-domain/PPxY interaction interface was used as the basis of an in silico screen for inhibitors. Using PPxY-dependent budding of Marburg (MARV) VP40 virus-like particles (VLPs) as the model system, compound 1, which inhibited Nedd4-PPxY interaction and PPxY-dependent budding, was identified. Optimization of this compound, with enhancement of anti-budding activity, allowed for the identification of compounds 4 and 5. These compounds exhibit on-target effects by specifically blocking the MARV VP40 PPxY-host Nedd4 interaction and subsequent PPxY-dependent egress of MARV VP40 VLPs. In addition, compounds 4 and 5 exhibited anti-budding activity against Ebola and Lassa fever VLPs, as well as live vesicular stomatitis (VSV) and rabies (RABV) viruses. These data indicate that inhibition of the PPxY-Nedd4 interaction can serve as the basis for the development of a novel class of broad- spectrum, host-oriented antiviral compounds targeting viruses that depend on a functional PPxY L domain for efficient egress.

The aforementioned listing of heterocyclyl and heteroaryl moieties is intended to be representative and not limiting. As used herein, the term "substituted" means that an atom or group of atoms has replaced hydrogen as the substituent attached to another group. For aryl, aryl-(Ci-C3)alkyl and heterocyclyl groups, the term "substituted" as applied to the rings of these groups refers to any level of substitution, namely mono-, di-, tri-, terra-, or penta-substitution, where such substitution is permitted. The substituents are independently selected, and substitution may be at any chemically accessible position. In certain embodiments, the substituents vary in number between one and four. In other embodiments, the substituents vary in number between one and three. In yet other embodiments, the substituents vary in number between one and two. In yet other embodiments, the substituents are independently selected from the group consisting of C1-C6 alkyl, -OH, C1-C6 alkoxy, halo, amino, acetamido and nitro. As used herein, where a substituent is an alkyl or alkoxy group, the carbon chain may be branched, straight or cyclic. Disclosure The present invention relates in part to the identification of potent, broad- spectrum antiviral compounds. In certain embodiments, the compounds of the invention target high-priority pathogens for which no current treatments are available. As described herein, an in silico approach combined with functional VLP and live virus budding assays was used to identify small molecules possessing potent antiviral activity. The viral PPxY/host Nedd4 interaction was targeted to identify broad-spectrum inhibitors that diminish the frequency of drug resistance-conferring mutations readily induced by most RNA containing viruses. As demonstrated herein, administration of such an antiviral compound during an outbreak inhibits virus dissemination and spread in infected individuals (Figs. 9A-9B), thus slowing disease progression and allowing an individual's immune system time to mount a robust response to effectively combat and clear the infection. By inhibiting PPxY-dependent recruitment of host Nedd4, a percentage of mature virions remain tethered to the plasma membrane, unable to bud and spread efficiently to infect new cells (Figs. 9A- 9B). Using iterative rounds of analog selection, potent compounds were identified, such as compounds 4 and 5. Compounds 4 and 5 exhibited broad-spectrum anti-budding activity against filoviruses, arenavirus, and rhabdovirus VLPs and/or virions with virtually no cytotoxicity by MTT assay at the concentrations tested. Without wishing to be limited by any theory, in certain embodiments, 4 and 5 competitively disrupt the viral PPxY /host Nedd4 interaction. Compound 4 significantly inhibited egress of live VSV-WT (a PPxY-dependent virus) by more than 1 log at a concentration of 0.5 μΜ, yet had no significant effect on egress of VSV-PY>A4 at the same concentration (Fig. 7A). The finding that 4 inhibited budding of VSV-WT to levels comparable to those of VSV-PY>A4 in the absence of drug suggest that 4 specially targets the function of the PPxY motif. The use of VSV recombinant M40 as a surrogate virus allowed for the assessment of the antiviral activity of 4 and 5 against a BSL-2 virus possessing the PPxY- type L-domain motif originating from a BSL-4 pathogen (EBOV). Compounds 4 and 5 also inhibited egress of live RABV by >1 log at 72 hours post- infection, without any apparent cytotoxicity or inhibitory effect on viral protein synthesis (Figs. 8A-8C). Interestingly, the replicative cycles and pathogenesis of VSV and RABV are distinct, yet both viruses depend on a PPxY L-domain for efficient egress. BiMC analyses indicated that both 4 and 5, but not 6, can inhibit PPxY-dependent binding of MARV VP40 and Nedd4 in live mammalian cells in a dose-dependent manner (Figs. 4-5). Indeed, the fraction of positively fluorescing cells, as well as the overall signal intensity, decreased from about 20% in the absence of drug to approximately 3% in the presence of a 1.0 μΜ concentration of 4 (Figs. 4A-4C). The present studies validate the concept of host-oriented therapeutics. As these virus L-domain/host interactions are conserved in a range of emerging RNA viruses, they may represent an Achilles heel in the life cycle of these pathogens. Without wishing to be limited by any theory, RNA viruses may contain one or more L-domains, and a combination of both PTAP and PPxY inhibitors may have a synergistic effect, resulting in enhanced antiviral potency.

In certain embodiments, the compound of the invention and the additional agent are co- formulated in the composition. Salts The compounds described herein may form salts with acids or bases, and such salts are included in the present invention. In certain embodiments, the salts are pharmaceutically acceptable salts. The term "salts" embraces addition salts of free acids or bases that are useful within the methods of the invention. The term "pharmaceutically acceptable salt" refers to salts that possess toxicity profiles within a range that affords utility in pharmaceutical applications. Pharmaceutically unacceptable salts may nonetheless possess properties such as high crystallinity, which have utility in the practice of the present invention, such as for example utility in process of synthesis, purification or formulation of compounds useful within the methods of the invention. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts may be prepared from an inorganic acid or from an organic acid. Examples of inorganic acids include hydrochloric, hydrobromic, hydriodic, nitric, carbonic, sulfuric (including sulfate and hydrogen sulfate), and phosphoric acids (including hydrogen phosphate and dihydrogen phosphate). Appropriate organic acids may be selected from aliphatic, cycloaliphatic, aromatic, araliphatic, heterocyclic, carboxylic and sulfonic classes of organic acids, examples of which include formic, acetic, propionic, succinic, glycolic, gluconic, lactic, malic, tartaric, citric, ascorbic, glucuronic, maleic, malonic, saccharin, fumaric, pyruvic, aspartic, glutamic, benzoic, anthranilic, 4-hydroxybenzoic, phenylacetic, mandelic, embonic (pamoic), methanesulfonic, ethanesulfonic, benzenesulfonic, pantothenic, trifluoromethanesulfonic, 2- hydroxyethanesulfonic, p-toluenesulfonic, sulfanilic, cyclohexylaminosulfonic, stearic, alginic, β-hydroxybutyric, salicylic, galactaric and galacturonic acid.

All of these salts may be prepared from the corresponding compound by reacting, for example, the appropriate acid or base with the compound. Combination Therapies In certain embodiments, the compounds of the invention are useful in the methods of the invention in combination with at least one additional compound useful for treating or preventing a disease or disorder contemplated within the invention. This additional compound may comprise compounds identified herein or compounds, e.g., commercially available compounds, known to treat, prevent or reduce the symptoms of a viral infection. In certain embodiments, the at least one additional compound is an antiviral agent. Non-limiting examples of antiviral agents include, but are not limited to, compound 0013 (2-((l, l-dioxidobenzo[d]isothiazol-3-yl)amino)phenyl 2-chlorobenzoate, or a salt or solvate thereof), as recited in Lu et al, 2014, J. Virol, doi: 10.1128/JVL03757-13 : A synergistic effect may be calculated, for example, using suitable methods such as, for example, the Sigmoid-Emax equation (Holford & Scheiner, 19981, Clin. Pharmacokinet. 6: 429-453), the equation of Loewe additivity (Loewe & Muischnek, 1926, Arch. Exp. Pathol Pharmacol. 114: 313-326) and the median-effect equation (Chou & Talalay, 1984, Adv. Enzyme Regul. 22:27-55). Each equation referred to above may be applied to experimental data to generate a corresponding graph to aid in assessing the effects of the drug combination. The corresponding graphs associated with the equations referred to above are the concentration-effect curve, isobologram curve and combination index curve, respectively. Methods In one aspect, the invention includes a method of treating or preventing viral infection in a subject in need thereof. In certain embodiments, the method comprises administering to the subject a therapeutically effective amount of a pharmaceutically acceptable composition comprising at least one compound of the invention. In other embodiments, the viral infection is caused by at least one virus selected from the group consisting of a filovirus, arenavirus, rhabdovirus, paramyxovirus, retrovirus, and any combinations thereof. In certain embodiments, the composition is administered to the subject by at least one route selected from oral, rectal, mucosal (e.g., by oral or nasal inhalation), transmucosal, topical (transdermal), or by intravenous, intradermal, intramuscular, subcutaneous, intracutaneous, intrauterine, epidural or intracerebroventricular injection. In other embodiments, the subject is further administered at least one additional compound useful for treating or preventing a viral infection. In yet other embodiments, the subject is a mammal. In yet other embodiments, the mammal is human. In yet other embodiments, the subject is not responsive to one or more commercially available antivirals. Formulations/Administration The compositions of the present invention may contain a pharmaceutical acceptable carrier, excipient and/or diluent, and may be administered by a suitable method to a subject. The compositions of the present invention may be formulated in various forms, including oral dosage forms or sterile injectable solutions, according to any conventional method known in the art. In other embodiments, the compositions may also be used as an inhalation-type drug delivery system. In yet other embodiments, the compositions of the invention may be formulated for injectable solutions. The compositions may be formulated as powders, granules, tablets, capsules, suspensions, emulsions, syrup, aerosol, preparations for external application, suppositories and sterile injectable solutions. Suitable formulations known in the art are disclosed in, for example, Remington's Pharmaceutical Science (Mack Publishing Company, Easton PA). Carriers, excipients and diluents that may be contained in the composition of the present invention include lactose, dextrose, sucrose, sorbitol, mannitol, xylitol, erythritol, maltitol, starch, acacia gum, alginate, gelatin, calcium phosphate, calcium silicate, cellulose, methyl cellulose, microcrystalline cellulose, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, water, methylhydroxybenzoate, propyl hydroxylbenzoate, talc, magnesium stearate or mineral oil. Tablets may also contain such standard ingredients as binding and granulating agents such as polyvinylpyrrolidone, disintegrants (e.g. swellable crosslinked polymers such as crosslinked carboxymethylcellulose), lubricating agents (e.g. stearates), preservatives (e.g. parabens), antioxidants (e.g. BHT), buffering agents (for example phosphate or citrate buffers), and effervescent agents such as citrate/bicarbonate mixtures. Such excipients are well known and do not need to be discussed in detail here. Capsule formulations may be of the hard gelatin or soft gelatin variety and can contain the active component in solid, semisolid, or liquid form. Gelatin capsules can be formed from animal gelatin or synthetic or plant derived equivalents thereof. The solid dosage forms (e.g. ; tablets, capsules etc.) can be coated or un-coated, but typically have a coating, for example a protective film coating (e.g. a wax or varnish) or a release controlling coating. The coating (e.g. a Eudragit™ type polymer) can be designed to release the active component at a desired location within the gastro-intestinal tract. Thus, the coating can be selected so as to degrade under certain pH conditions within the gastrointestinal tract, thereby selectively release the compound in the stomach or in the ileum or duodenum. Alternatively or additionally, the coating can be used as a taste masking agent to mask unpleasant tastes such as bitter tasting drugs. The coating may contain sugar or other agents that assist in masking unpleasant tastes. Instead of, or in addition to, a coating, the antibiotic can be presented in a solid matrix comprising a release controlling agent, for example a release delaying agent which may be adapted to selectively release the compound under conditions of varying acidity or alkalinity in the gastrointestinal tract. Alternatively, the matrix material or release retarding coating can take the form of an erodible polymer (e.g., a maleic anhydride polymer) which is substantially continuously eroded as the dosage form passes through the gastrointestinal tract. As a further alternative, the active compound can be formulated in a delivery system that provides osmotic control of the release of the compound. Osmotic release and other delayed release or sustained release formulations may be prepared in accordance with methods well known to those skilled in the art. The pharmaceutical formulations may be presented to a patient in "patient packs" containing an entire course of treatment in a single package, usually a blister pack. Patient packs have an advantage over traditional prescriptions, where a pharmacist divides a patient's supply of a pharmaceutical from a bulk supply, in that the patient always has access to the package insert contained in the patient pack, normally missing in patient prescriptions. The inclusion of a package insert has been shown to improve patient compliance with the physician's instructions. Each tablet, capsule, caplet, pill, etc. can be a single dose, with a dose, for example, as herein discussed, or a dose can be two or more tablets, capsules, caplets, pills, etc; for example if a tablet, capsule etc is 125 mg and the dose is 250 mg, the patient may take two tablets, capsules and the like, at each interval there is to administration. The compositions of the present invention may be formulated with commonly used diluents or excipients, such as fillers, extenders, binders, wetting agents, disintegrants, or surfactants. Solid formulations for oral administration include tablets, pills, powders, granules, or capsules, and such solid formulations comprise, in addition to the composition, at least one excipient, for example, starch, calcium carbonate, sucrose, lactose or gelatin. In addition to simple excipients, lubricants such as magnesium stearate or talc may also be used. Liquid formulations for oral administration include suspensions, solutions, emulsions and syrup, and may contain various excipients, for example, wetting agents, flavoring agents, aromatics and preservatives, in addition to water and liquid paraffin, which are frequently used simple diluents. Formulations for parenteral administration include sterilized aqueous solutions, non-aqueous solutions, suspensions, emulsions, freeze-dried preparations, and suppositories. As non-aqueous solvents or suspending agents, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, plant oils such as olive oil, or injectable esters such as ethyl oleate may be used. As the base of the suppositories, witepsol, Macrogol, Tween 61, cacao butter, laurin fat, or glycerogelatin may be used. The compounds for use in the method of the invention may be formulated in unit dosage form. The term "unit dosage form" refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosage for patients undergoing treatment, with each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active material calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect, optionally in association with a suitable pharmaceutical carrier. The unit dosage form may be for a single daily dose or one of multiple daily doses (e.g., about 1 to 4 or more times per day). When multiple daily doses are used, the unit dosage form may be the same or different for each dose. The compositions of the present invention may be administered to a subject by various routes. All modes of administration are contemplated, for example, orally, rectally, mucosally (e.g., by oral or nasal inhalation), transmucosally, topically (transdermal), or by intravenous, intradermal, intramuscular, subcutaneous, intracutaneous, intrauterine, epidural or intracerebro ventricular injection. Dosing The contemplated dose of the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention varies depending on the patient's condition and weight, the severity of the disease, the type of drug, and the route and period of administration and may be suitably selected by those skilled in the art. For certain effects, the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention may be administered at a dose of 0.01-100 mg/kg/day. The administration may be anywhere from 1 to 4 times daily, e.g., once, twice, three times or four times daily. The maximum amount administered in a 24 hour period may be up to 1,500 mg. The administration may be over a course of 2 to 30 days, e.g., 3 to 21 days, such as 7, 10 or 14 days. The skilled person can adjust dosing depending on the subject's body weight and overall health condition and the purpose for administering the compound. Repeated courses of treatment may be pursued depending on the response obtained. The skilled artisan will be able to determine appropriate dosages depending on these and other factors. A suitable dose of a compound of the present invention may be in the range of from about 0.01 mg to about 5,000 mg per day, such as from about 0.1 mg to about 1,000 mg, for example, from about 1 mg to about 500 mg, such as about 5 mg to about 250 mg per day. The dose may be administered in a single dosage or in multiple dosages, for example from 1 to 4 or more times per day. When multiple dosages are used, the amount of each dosage may be the same or different. For example, a dose of 1 mg per day may be administered as two 0.5 mg doses, with about a 12-hour interval between doses. It is understood that the amount of compound dosed per day may be administered, in non-limiting examples, every day, every other day, every 2 days, every 3 days, every 4 days, or every 5 days. For example, with every other day administration, a 5 mg per day dose may be initiated on Monday with a first subsequent 5 mg per day dose administered on Wednesday, a second subsequent 5 mg per day dose administered on Friday, and so on. Controlled Release Formulations and Drug Delivery Systems In certain embodiments, the formulations of the present invention may be, but are not limited to, short-term, rapid-offset, as well as controlled, for example, sustained release, delayed release and pulsatile release formulations. The term sustained release is used in its conventional sense to refer to a drug formulation that provides for gradual release of a drug over an extended period of time, and that may, although not necessarily, result in substantially constant blood levels of a drug over an extended time period. The period of time may be as long as a month or more and should be a release which is longer that the same amount of agent administered in bolus form. For sustained release, the compounds may be formulated with a suitable polymer or hydrophobic material which provides sustained release properties to the compounds. As such, the compounds for use the method of the invention may be administered in the form of microparticles, for example, by injection or in the form of wafers or discs by implantation. In certain embodiments of the invention, the compounds of the invention are administered to a patient, alone or in combination with another pharmaceutical agent, using a sustained release formulation. The term delayed release is used herein in its conventional sense to refer to a drug formulation that provides for an initial release of the drug after some delay following drug administration and that mat, although not necessarily, includes a delay of from about 10 minutes up to about 12 hours. The term pulsatile release is used herein in its conventional sense to refer to a drug formulation that provides release of the drug in such a way as to produce pulsed plasma profiles of the drug after drug administration. The term immediate release is used in its conventional sense to refer to a drug formulation that provides for release of the drug immediately after drug administration. As used herein, short-term refers to any period of time up to and including about 8 hours, about 7 hours, about 6 hours, about 5 hours, about 4 hours, about 3 hours, about 2 hours, about 1 hour, about 40 minutes, about 20 minutes, or about 10 minutes and any or all whole or partial increments thereof after drug administration after drug administration. As used herein, rapid-offset refers to any period of time up to and including about 8 hours, about 7 hours, about 6 hours, about 5 hours, about 4 hours, about 3 hours, about 2 hours, about 1 hour, about 40 minutes, about 20 minutes, or about 10 minutes, and any and all whole or partial increments thereof after drug administration. Unless otherwise indicated, all numbers expressing quantities of ingredients, properties such as molecular weight, reaction conditions, and so forth used in the specification and claims are to be understood as being modified in all instances by the term "about." Accordingly, unless indicated to the contrary, the numerical parameters set forth in the following specification and attached claims are approximations that may vary depending upon the desired properties sought to be obtained by the present invention. At the very least, and not as an attempt to limit the application of the doctrine of equivalents to the scope of the claims, each numerical parameter should at least be construed in light of the number of reported significant digits and by applying ordinary rounding techniques. Notwithstanding that the numerical ranges and parameters setting forth the broad scope of the invention are approximations, the numerical values set forth in the specific examples are reported as precisely as possible. Any numerical value, however, inherently contain certain errors necessarily resulting from the standard deviation found in their respective testing measurements. Those skilled in the art will recognize, or be able to ascertain using no more than routine experimentation, numerous equivalents to the specific procedures, embodiments, claims, and examples described herein. Such equivalents were considered to be within the scope of this invention and covered by the claims appended hereto. For example, it should be understood, that modifications in reaction conditions, including but not limited to reaction times, reaction size/volume, and experimental reagents, such as solvents, catalysts, pressures, atmospheric conditions, e.g., nitrogen atmosphere, and reducing/oxidizing agents, with art- recognized alternatives and using no more than routine experimentation, are within the scope of the present application. It is to be understood that wherever values and ranges are provided herein, all values and ranges encompassed by these values and ranges, are meant to be encompassed within the scope of the present invention. Moreover, all values that fall within these ranges, as well as the upper or lower limits of a range of values, are also contemplated by the present application. The following examples further illustrate aspects of the present invention. However, they are in no way a limitation of the teachings or disclosure of the present invention as set forth herein. EXAMPLES The invention is now described with reference to the following Examples. These Examples are provided for the purpose of illustration only, and the invention is not limited to these Examples, but rather encompasses all variations that are evident as a result of the teachings provided herein.

Bimolecular Complementation (BiMC) Assay: BiMC in HEK293T cells was performed as described previously in Liu et al, 2011, J. Infect. Dis. 204 Suppl 3 :S817-824. Briefly, HEK293T cells were co-transfected with CYFP-mVP40 and NYFP-Nedd4 for 4-5 hours, and the cells were then treated with the indicated concentrations of 4, 5, or 6 for an additional 24 hours. Cell nuclei were stained with NucBlue Live Cell Stain reagent (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were examined by fluorescence microscopy. VLP Budding Assay and Western Blotting: VLP budding assays and Western blotting were performed as described previously in McCarthy et al, 2007, J. Virol. 81 : 11452-1 1460; Liu et al, 2010, J. Virol. 84:2294-2303). Virus Budding and Titration: To evaluate the effect of compounds on the release of VSV-WT, recombinant VSV-M40, or mutant VSV PY>A4, HEK293T cells in collagen-coated 6-well plates were infected with the appropriate virus at an MOI of 0.1 for 1 hour. The inoculum was removed, cells were washed 3X with PBS, and then incubated in serum-free OPTI-MEM in the presence of DMSO alone (mock), or the appropriate compounds at the indicated concentrations. Virions from the culture media were harvested at 8 hours post-infection and centrifuged at 2,500 rpm for 10 minutes at 4°C to remove cellular debris. Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (50mM Tris HC1 pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS and protease inhibitor). VSV M or M40 proteins in cell extracts were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western-blot with anti-VSV M monoclonal antibody 23H12, followed by anti-mouse IgG HRP-conjugated secondary antibody. For virus titration, BHK-21 cells in 6-well plates were washed IX with PBS and inoculated with 200 μΐ of 10-fold serial dilutions of virus in serum free DMEM in triplicate and incubated for 1 hour. The inoculum was removed and the cells were washed 3X with PBS and incubated with 2.0 mis of Eagle's MEM containing 5% FBS and 1% methylcellulose at 37°C for 36-48 hour until plaques were observed. Cells were washed 2X with PBS, fixed with methanol and stained with 1% crystal violet solution. To evaluate the effect of compounds on the release of RABV, HEK293T cells were infected with SPBN at an MOI of 0.1 in the absence or presence of the probe, and cells were incubated at 34°C. Virus-containing supernatants were harvested at the indicated times post-infection, and titers were determined in duplicate on BSR cells. RABV M protein was detected by Western blotting of HEK293T cells infected with SPBN at an MOI of 10 for 36 hours. Structure/Activity Studies: Compound 1 was identified via an in silico screen involving computational docking of over 4.8 million drug-like compounds from the ZINC database into the published structure between the viral PPxY motif and the host WW-domain of Nedd4 (Kanelis et ah, 1998. Biochem. Cell Biol. 76:341-350; Otte et al, 2003, Protein Sci. 12:491-500) with AutoDock 4.0, followed by energy minimization using CHARMM with the MMFF force field, and ranking with Accelrys LigScore2 (Fig. 1) (Morris et ah, 2009, J. Comp. Chem. 30:2785-2791; Zhang et al, 2008, BMC Bioinform. 9: 126). Experimentally testing the top twenty scoring compounds as described (Fig. 1) allowed for the identification of initial hit 1. Compound 1 was then dissected into two fragments as shown by the red colored dissection line in Fig. 1 and the 2-piperidin-3-yl- benzothiazole fragment (left side) and l-acetyl-3-(2,2,2-trifluoro-ethyl)-urea fragment (right side) was used for substructure searching (SSS) of the Ambinter (Orleans, FRANCE) commercial compound database. Ten commercially available compounds (five from each fragment substructure) were evaluated. This allowed for the identification of more potent compounds, namely congener 2 obtained from SSS of the left side fragment and analog 3 from SSS of the right side fragment. Structurally related inactive compound 6, used as a negative control in later studies, was also identified (SSS analog of right hand fragment of 1). Substructure/similarity searching for analogs of 2 allowed for identification of two additional analogs of 2. One of these two was compound 4 which proved to be more potent than 2. Substructure/similarity searching for analogs of 3 allowed for the identification of eight additional analogs of 3. In certain embodiments, compound 5 stood out as the most potent, exceeding the potency of 3. Example 1: Chemical Synthesis of Exemplary Compounds Compound 3h: 2-((3-methylquinoxalin-2-yl)thio)-N-(phenylcarbamoyl)acetamide 3h Compound 3η: 6-(3-Methyl-quinoxalin-2-ylsulfanylmethyl)-lH-pyrimidine-2,4-dione 3-Methylquinoxaline-2 -thiol (25 mg, 0.14 mmol), 6-(chloromethyl)uracil (23 mg, 0.14 mmol) and sodium acetate (17 mg, 0.21 mmol) were combined in EtOH (700 μί) and refluxed for 30 minutes.

Step 2: l-[2-(3-Methyl-quinoxalin-2-ylsulfanyl)-acetyl]-3-phenyl-urea In a similar manner to 3n, l-(2-chloro-acetyl)-3-phenyl-urea was used in place of 6-(chloromethyl)uracil to afford the title compound (50 mg, quantitative yield). LCMS (ESI) mlz 353.3 (M+l)+, retention time 5.3 min. ¾ NMR (300 MHz, d6-DMSO) 5 11.1 (br. s., IH), 10.3 (br. s., IH), 7.9 (d, J=7.7 Hz, IH), 7.8-7.6 (m, 3H), 7.5 (d, J=8.2 Hz, 2H), 7.3 (t, J=7.8 Hz, 2H), 7.1-7.0 (m, IH), 4.3 (s, 2H), 2.6 (s, 3H). In a similar manner to 5, the following compounds were prepared: 3 -(2-Chloro-acetyl)-l -methyl- 1-phenyl-urea was the alkylating reagent for this reaction but EtOH further reacted with the product to give these two products.

The reaction was purified directly by prep HPLC to give a pale yellow solid after freeze drying from dioxane (11.5 mg, 50 % yield). LCMS (ESI) mlz 341.4 (M+l)+ retention time 3.8 min. XH NMR (300MHz, CD3OD) δ = 7.95 (m, 2H), 7.50 (m, 1H), 7.44-7.38 (m, 1H), 3.55-3.41 (m, 1H), 3.31-3.01 (m, 2H), 2.50 (m, 2H), 2.30 (s, 6H), 2.26-2.12 (m, 2H), 1.95-1.78 (m, 2H). In a similar manner to 2i, the following compounds were prepared: Example 2: Identification of Host-Oriented Inhibitors Targeting Viral PPxY-host Nedd4 Interactions In one aspect, subversion of host Nedd4 E3 ubiquitin ligase by viral PPxY- type L-domains plays a role in efficient budding (virus-cell separation) of numerous RNA viruses including filoviruses, arenaviruses, and rhabdoviruses. In certain embodiments, small molecule inhibitors that block this virus-host interaction can reduce virus-cell separation and virus spread by concomitantly increasing the number of virions tethered to the plasma membrane. Such candidate small molecule compounds were identified by using an in silico screening strategy to probe the reported interaction structure between the viral PPxY motif and the host WW-domain of Nedd4 (Fig. 1). This approach allowed for the identification of 1 as initial hit. Structural analogs of 1 based on the dissected fragments of 1 (Fig. 1) were evaluated, allowing for the the identification of more potent compounds 2-5 (Fig. 1). Example 3: Anti-Budding Activity of Compound 1 Compound 1 was tested for its ability to block PPxY-dependent budding of MARV VP40 (mVP40) VLPs in a dose-dependent manner. Briefly, HEK293T cells were transfected with pCAGGS vector alone (Fig. 2A, lane 1) or an mVP40 expression plasmid in the absence (DMSO alone, lane 2) or presence of the indicated concentrations of 1 (lanes 3- 6). Compound 1 produced a dose-dependent inhibition of mVP40 VLP formation with an approximate 5-fold decrease in VLP egress at a concentration of 20 μΜ compared to controls (Fig. 2A; VLPs, lanes 2 and 6; bar graph). Compound 1 had no effect on expression levels of mVP40 or actin in cells at all drug concentrations tested (Fig. 2A; Cells, lanes 1-6). Studies were the perfroemd to determine whether 1 could inhibit budding of a PPxY-dependent virus from cell culture. Efficient egress of VSV is dependent on a functional PPxY L-domain within its M protein (Harty et al, 2001, J. Virol. 75: 10623-10629; Craven et al, 1999, J. Virol. 73 :3359-3365; Harty et al, 1999, J. Virol. 73:2921-2929; Irie et al, 2005, J. Virol. 79: 12617-12622). Briefly, HEK293T cells were infected with VSV-WT or a PPxY mutant virus (VSV-PY>A4) in which the PPxY motif was changed to four alanines, in the absence (DMSO alone) or presence of 10 μΜ 1. Cell extracts and virus containing supernatants were harvested at 8 hours post- infection and analyzed for levels of M protein by Western blotting and viral titers by plaque assay, respectively (Fig. 2B). Relative release efficiency of VSV-WT and VSV-PY>A4 in the absence of 1 was set at 100% (Fig. 2B). In the presence of 10 μΜ 1, budding of mutant VSV-PY>A4 was reduced by <2-fold, whereas budding of VSV-WT was reduced by approximately 5-fold (Fig. 2B). Compound 1 had no effect on expression levels of actin or VSV M at a concentration of 10μΜ as determined by Western blotting of infected cell extracts (Fig. 2B). Example 4: Anti-Budding Activity of Compounds 2 and 3 Using the structure of 1 as the starting point, SAR analog testing was performed to identify structurally related and progressively more potent small molecule inhibitors of budding. 2 and 3 were identified and tested for their ability to inhibit egress of both MARV and EBOV VP40 VLPs in a dose-dependent manner (Figs. 3A-3E). Briefly, HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids expressing either mVP40 or eVP40 in the absence (DMSO alone) or presence of the indicated concentrations of 2 (Figs. 3A & 3C) or 3 (Figs. 3B & 3D). Both cell extracts and VLPs were harvested at 24 hours post-transfection, and levels of mVP40 and eVP40 were assessed by Western blotting. Compound 2 inhibited egress of mVP40 VLPs by 33- and 100-fold at concentrations of 20 μΜ and 40 μΜ, respectively (Fig. 3A; VLPs, lanes 4 + 5) without any detrimental effect on the levels of mVP40 and host GAPDH in cell extracts (Fig. 3 A; Cells, lanes 1-5). Compound 2 inhibited egress of eVP40 VLPs by 2.5- and 40-fold at concentrations of 20 μΜ and 40 μΜ, respectively (Fig. 3C; VLPs, lanes 4 + 5) without any detrimental effect on the levels of eVP40 and host GAPDH in cell extracts (Fig. 3C; Cells, lanes 1-5). Relative to 2, compound 3 was far more potent at inhibiting budding of both mVP40 and eVP40 VLPs. Indeed, 3 inhibited egress of mVP40 VLPs by 10-, 100-, and 100- fold at concentrations of 1.0 μΜ, 10 μΜ, and 20 μΜ, respectively (Fig. 3B; VLPs, lanes 2-4), and inhibited egress of eVP40 VLPs by <2-, 4.5-, and 20-fold at concentrations of 1.0 μΜ, 10 μΜ, and 20 μΜ, respectively (Fig. 3D; VLPs, lanes 4-6). Compound 3 had no effect on expression levels of mVP40, eVP40, or GAPDH in cell extracts at any concentration tested (Figs. 3B & 3D; Cells). Negative control 6 served to validate the specificity and anti-budding activity of 2 and 3, since 6 showed no effect on either cell or VLP expression levels of mVP40 at any concentration tested (Fig. 3E, lanes 1-6). Example 5: Anti-Budding Activity of Compounds 4 and 5 SAR studies allowed for the identification of 4 and 5, which were tested for their ability to inhibit PPxY-dependent budding of both VLPs and live virus from cell culture, as well as to competitively block the interaction between mVP40 and host Nedd4 in live mammalian cells using a BiMC approach. Briefly, HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids expressing either mVP40 or eVP40 in the absence (DMSO alone) or presence of the indicated concentrations of 4 (Figs. 4A-4B). Both cell extracts and VLPs were harvested at 24 hours post-transfection, and levels of mVP40 and eVP40 were assessed by Western blotting and quantified. Compound 4 inhibited egress of mVP40 VLPs by 30- and 100-fold at concentrations of 0.5 μΜ and 1.0 μΜ, respectively (Fig. 4A; VLPs, lanes 3 + 4; bar graph). Compound 4 inhibited egress of eVP40 VLPs by 3- and 10-fold at concentrations of 0.5 μΜ and 1.0 μΜ, respectively (Fig. 4B; VLPs, lanes 2 + 3; bar graph). Compound 4 had no effect on expression levels of mVP40, GAPDH, or HSP70 in cell extracts at all concentrations tested (Figs. 4A-4B; Cells). A BiMC assay was used to determine whether 4 could specifically block the protein-protein interaction between mVP40 and host Nedd4 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4C). Briefly, the mechanistic basis of the BiMC assay involves the splitting of YFP into N- (NYFP) and C-terminal (CYFP) halves that are then joined to two proteins of interest (mVP40 and Nedd4) (Lu et al, 2013, J. Virol. 87:7777-7780; Liu et al, 2011, J. Infect. Dis. 204 Suppl 3:S817-824; Kerppola, 2006, Nature Protocols 1 : 1278-1286). If mVP40 and Nedd4 interact when co-expressed in mammalian cells, then the N- and C-terminal halves of YFP will come together to reconstitute a functional YFP yielding a fluorescent signal. NYFP-Nedd4 and CYFP-mVP40 were co-expressed in human HEK293T cells for 4-5 hours and then cells were treated with DMSO alone, or the indicated concentrations of 4 or 6 (as a negative control) (Fig. 4C). Twenty four hours after transfection, cells were examined for YFP fluorescence (Fig. 4C). Total cell counts based on NucBlue staining indicated that equivalent numbers of cells were present in all BiMC samples. YFP positive cells constituted approximately 20% of total cells in the presence of vehicle alone, indicating that this assay is capable of detecting mVP40 interactions with host Nedd4 (Fig. 4C). Importantly, YFP positive cells decreased to 6.0% and 3.0% in the presence of 0.5 μΜ and 1.0 μΜ concentrations of 4, respectively, indicating that 4 inhibits interactions between mVP40 and host edd4 (Fig. 4C). No such inhibition was observed in cells treated with 10 μΜ or 2 ΟμΜ concentrations of 6, confirming the specificity of the inhibitory activity observed for 4 (Fig. 4C). Similar analyses were carried out with 5 (Figs. 5A-5C). Compound 5 inhibited egress of mVP40 VLPs by 25-, 100-, and 100-fold at concentrations of 0.1 μΜ, 0.5 μΜ, and 1.0 μΜ respectively (Fig. 5 A; VLPs, lanes 2-4; bar graph). Compound 5 inhibited egress of eVP40 VLPs by <2-, 3.5-, and 7-fold at concentrations of 0.1 μΜ, 0.5 μΜ, and 1.0 μΜ respectively (Fig. 5B; VLPs, lanes 2-4; bar graph). Compound 5 had no effect on expression levels of mVP40, eVP40, GAPDH, or HSP70 in cell extracts at all concentrations tested (Figs. 5A + 5B; Cells). A BiMC assay was used to determine whether 5 could specifically block the mVP40-Nedd4 interaction in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5C). Total cell counts based on NucBlue staining indicated that equivalent numbers of cells were present in all BiMC samples. Indeed, YFP positive cells decreased in a dose-dependent manner in the presence of 0.1 μΜ and 0.5 μΜ concentrations of 5 compared to those observed in the presence of vehicle alone (Fig. 5C). Example 6: Compounds 4 and 5 inhibit VLP budding of PPxY-containing LFV Z protein The Z protein of LFV contains both a PPxY and a PTAP motif. The PPxY L- domain motif plays a role in efficient egress of LFV Z VLPs (Fig. 6A). For example, deletion of the PPxY motif resulted in a 4-fold decrease in VLP production compared to that of WT LFV Z (Fig. 6A). Thus, it was tested whether 4 and 5 could inhibit budding of LFV Z VLPs. Briefly, HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids expressing LFV Z in the absence (DMSO alone) or presence of the indicated concentrations of 4 (Fig. 6B) or 5 (Fig. 6C). Both cell extracts and VLPs were harvested at 24 hours post-transfection, and levels of LFV Z were assessed by Western blotting. Compound 4 inhibited egress of LFV Z VLPs by >5-fold at a concentration of 0.5μΜ and by >10-fold at a concentration of 1.0 μΜ (Fig. 6B; VLPs). Similarly, 5 inhibited egress of LFV Z VLPs by approximately 3-, 5-, and >10-fold at concentrations of 0.1 μΜ, 0.5 μΜ, and 1.0 μΜ, respectively (Fig. 6C; VLPs). Compounds 4 and 5 had no effect on expression levels of LFV Z or actin in cell extracts at all concentrations tested (Figs. 6B-6C; Cells). Example 7: Effect of Compounds 4 and 5 on Budding of Live VSV and VSV Recombinants The potential anti-budding activity of 4 and 5 against live viruses that depend on a functional PPxY L-domain for efficient egress was evaluated. Toward this end, HEK293T cells were infected for 8 hours at an MOI of 0.1 with either VSV-WT (containing a single PPxY L-domain), recombinant VSV-M40 (containing overlapping EBOV PTAP and PPxY L-domains), or VSV-PY>A4 (a PPxY mutant and budding defective virus) in the absence (DMSO alone) or presence of the indicated concentration of 4 (Fig. 7A) or 5 (Fig. 7B). Compound 4 inhibited egress of VSV-WT by >2-fold at 0.1 μΜ and by approximately 20-fold at 0.5 μΜ without affecting viral or host protein synthesis (Fig. 7A, left panel). Indeed, titers of VSV-WT averaging 3.3 x 107 pfu/ml at 8 hours post-infection were significantly reduced to an average of 1.8 x 106 pfu/ml in the presence of 0.5 μΜ concentration of 4 (Fig. 7A, left panel). Not surprisingly, 4 inhibited egress of VSV-M40 to a lesser degree by approximately 2-fold at 0.1 μΜ and by 3-fold at 0.5 μΜ without affecting viral or host protein synthesis (Fig. 7A, middle panel). As expected, 4 exhibited no significant inhibition of VSV-PY>A4 budding at all concentrations tested (Fig. 7A, right panel). Compound 5 inhibited egress of VSV-WT by >2-fold at 0.1 μΜ and by 4-fold at 0.5 μΜ without affecting viral or host protein synthesis (Fig. 7B, left panel). Compound 5 inhibited egress of VSV-M40 by 2-fold at 0.1 μΜ and by 6-fold at 0.5 μΜ without affecting viral or host protein synthesis (Fig. 7B, middle panel). Lastly, budding of VSV-PY>A4 was reduced by <2-fold in the presence of 0.1 μΜ and 0.5 μΜ concentrations of 5 (Fig. 7B, right panel). Example 8: Effect of Compounds of the Invention on Budding of PPxY-Containing RABV Efficient budding of RABV is also dependent on a single PPxY L-domain within its M protein, and the potential anti-budding activity of 4 and 5 against live RABV in cell culture was evaluated. Briefly, HEK293T cells were infected with RABV SPBN at an MOI of 0.1 in the absence (DMSO alone) or presence of the indicated concentration of 4 or 5, and virus-containing supernatants were harvested at 24, 36, and 72 hours p.i. and titered in duplicate by plaque assay on BSR cells (Figs. 8A-8B). Compound 4 reduced RABV titers at 36 hours post-infection in a dose- dependent manner by approximately 5- and 10-fold at 0.5 μΜ and 1.0 μΜ, respectively (Fig. 8A). Compound 4 reduced RABV titers at 72 hours post-infection in a dose-dependent manner by approximately 10- and 50-fold at 0.5 μΜ and 1.0 μΜ, respectively (Fig. 8A). A similar dose-dependent reduction in RABV titers of approximately 5- and 30-fold was observed in the presence of 5 at 36 hours post-infection at 0.5 μΜ and 1.0 μΜ, respectively (Fig. 8B). Compound 5 reduced RABV titers at 72 hours post-infection by approximately 40- and 80-fold at 0.5 and 1.0 μΜ, respectively (Fig. 8B). Inhibition of RABV budding by 4 and 5 was observed as early as 24 hours post- infection. Equivalent amounts of RABV M were detected by Western blot from cell extracts receiving vehicle alone, or the indicated concentrations of 4 and 5. Without wishing to be limited by any theory, these inhibitors do not appear to adversely affect viral protein synthesis at the concentrations tested (Fig. 8C). Example 9: Identification of Inhibitors of Virus Budding Using the known structure of the Nedd4 WW-domain/PPxY interaction as a guide, an in silico strategy was used to screen 4.8 million drug-like compounds in a ZINC database to identify potential lead compounds that would inhibit binding of Nedd4 to the viral PPxY L-domain. This strategy led to the initial identification of compound 1, which was shown to specifically block PPxY-mediated budding of Marburg VP40 VLPs. Analogs of 1 exhibited more potent activity in blocking PPxY-mediated VLP egress and in specifically blocking the PPxY-Nedd4 interaction as determined using the BiMC assay. Example 10: SAR Studies To understand how the structure of 1 affected its activity, the molecule was dissected into two fragments 2 and 3 (Fig. 10), and derivatives thereof were prepared and evaluated. Compound 2b showed good activity at 10 μΜ in the M VP40 budding assay. Compound 2e was active in the M VP40 budding assay at 10 μΜ but also inhibited viral protein synthesis at slightly higher potencies. Compound 2 was considerably more potent than 1, with nearly full inhibition of egress of Marburg (M) VP 40 VLPs at 20 μΜ and of Ebola (E) VP40 VLPs at 40 μΜ. Without wishing to be limited by any theory, budding of E- VP40 is dependent on both PTAP and PPxY L-domains, whereas budding of M-VP40 is dependent solely on a PPxY L-domain, and that may help explain why PPxY inhibitors inhibit egress of M-VP40 better than E-VP40. Compound 2 also showed target engagement in the M-BiMC and E-BiMC assays and also significantly inhibited budding of live wild type VSV at these concentrations. Based on the results of compounds in Fig. 10, additional analogs of 2 were analyzed (Fig. 10). Analog 2g is a pseudo regiochemical isomer of 2 (1,4-piperazine versus 1,3-piperidine). These changes led to an inactive compound. However replacing the pyrazole hydrogen of 2 with a phenyl group (4) improved the potency into the sub-micromolar region. Compounds 3b-3e were not active or weakly active at our highest dose (40 μΜ). However compound 3, in which the left hand fragment of 1 is replaced by a 3-methyl- quinoxaline-2-thiol group, was very effective in inhibiting MVP40 VLP budding, showing a dose response from 10 to 0.5 μΜ with significant potency at the lowest dose. Additional analogs of 3 are shown in Fig. 10. A hybrid compound (31) that combined the 3-methyl- quinoxaline-2 -thiol fragment of 3 with the N-(3, 5 -dimethyl- lH-pyrazol-4-yl)-acetamide fragment of 2b had low activity. Analogs of 31 (such as 3k) also had low activity. However analogs more closely related in structure to 3 (such as 5, 3i, 3f, 3g) were shown in preliminary characterizations to be as or more potent than 3 in the MVP 40 budding assay. Compound 5 demonstrated anti-budding activity on MVP 40 into the low nM region (IC50 <100 nM, Fig. 10). Further examination of Figs. 10-11 reveals a nascent SAR arising with two lead series represented by 2 and 3 and interdependence of the assays. Greater potency in inhibition of budding relates to greater potency in both the BiMC and live virus assays. Compound 4 blocked PPxY-dependent egress of both Marburg VP 40 VLPs and live infectious vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) in cell culture in a dose-dependent manner (Figs. 12A-12C) in low micromolar concentrations. In addition, compound 4 was shown to inhibit the viral PPxY-host WW-domain interaction between Marburg VP40 and host edd4 proteins in a BiMC assay in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 12B). In certain embodiments, the compounds of the invention interfere with the viral PPxY-host WW domain interaction and are useful in broad-spectrum antiviral therapy. In other embodiments, the compounds of the invention have one or more of the following characteristics: in vitro potency as indicated by BiMIC MV40 IC5o <1 μΜ, MVP40 <1 μΜ, EVP 40 IC50 <5 μΜ and BiMC EVP40 IC50 <5 μΜ; little or no cytotoxicity; ADME characteristics approaching the following values: plasma protein binding (<95%), microsomal stability (human, and mouse t 2>30 min), Cyp inhibition (<20% inhibition of 3A4 at 10 μΜ); and good stability in mouse PK under iv administration: low to moderate CL, moderate Vd, t 2 >1 hr. In yet other embodiments, certain surrogate monitors of ADME drug properties, such as lipophilicity (cLogP, <4.5) and topological polar surface area (tPSA, 60-120 A2), correlate with good clearance properties and avoidance of off-target toxicities associated both with high molecular weight and lipophilicity. Example 11: SAR Studies Analogs of 4 and 3 are prepared, as described herein. Compound 4: Compound 4 has a chiral center (designated by * in Fig. 13). Both enantiomers are synthesized (Fig. 14; R-4 from S-nipecotic acid is shown, S-4 could be obtained similarly from R-nipecotic acid) to examine enantioselectivity. Structurally related analogs of 4 are also prepared and characterized. Analogs of 4 may be prepared using methodology summarized in Fig. 14. Substructure A (Fig. 13): To test electronic and steric substituent effects, aryl substituted analogs are prepared. In addition, benzothiazole scaffold changes are targeted to afford benzoxazole (replace S with O) or benzimidazole (replace S with NH or NMe) systems by short synthetic sequences. Substructure B (Fig. 13): Analogs with distint rings (such as pyrrolidine or 1,4- piperidine) are prepared. The chiral H atom is also replaced with lower alkyl groups. Substructure C (Fig. 13): A N-methyl analog is prepared. Substructure D (Fig. 13): Analogs with distinct 3- and 5- substituted pyrazoles and other ring systems (e.g., pyrrole, imidazole, isoxazole) are prepared. Substructure E (Fig. 13): Analogs having lower alkyl, benzyl or substituted phenyl groups at this position are synthesized. Compound 3: Analogs of compound 3 are prepared (Fig. 15). Substructure A (Fig. 15): Substituted quinoxaline analogs of 3 are prepared, using for example commercially available substituted 1,2-diaminobenzene derivatives (Fig. 16). The thiol 4 can readily be converted to acid 5 or primary amide 6 and these could be reacted with substituted ureas or isocyanates respectively to give analogs of 3. Distinct scaffolds other than quinoxaline, such as naphthyl, quinazoline, and quinoline scaffolds, are also prepared. Substructure B (Fig. 15): Oxygen, carbon or nitrogen derivatives are prepared. Substructure C (Fig. 15): Derivatives wherein the methyl group is replaced with H, Ph, CF3, or Bn are prepared. Substructure D (Fig. 15): Analogs of 3 are synthesized from ureas/isocyanates and intermediates 5 or 6 (Fig. 16). Substructure E (Fig. 15): N-methylated analogs are prepared. Libraries of 3 -amide derivatives from 5 are also prepared (see box in Fig. 16). In certain embodiments, cyclic systems such as thymine derivatives (3-thymine in Fig. 16) may replace C(=0)-NH-C(=0)- NH. Synthesis of such system is exemplified in Fig. 16. Example 12: BiMC and VLP Budding Assays BiMC and VLP budding assays may be used to test analogues for their efficacy in specifically inhibiting the PPxY-Nedd4 interaction and subsequent egress of filovirus particles. The VLP budding assay recapitulates live virus budding to determine the antiviral potency of analogs identified in Aim 1 (Figs. 12A-12C). Egress of VLPs consisting of mVP40-WT or PPxY mutants of mVP40 as controls (e.g. mVP40-AAAA or mVP40-APY) is quantified in the presence of each analog in a dose-dependent manner, and those that robustly block PPxY-dependent VLP egress are identified. Without wishing to be limited by any theory, inhibitors that block the PPxY-Nedd4 interaction more potently than compound 4 in BiMC assays also more potently inhibit VLP budding. A BiMC approach is implemented to detect and visualize mVP40-Nedd4 interactions in live mammalian cells (Figs. 12A-12C). BiMC is used to evaluate the relative ability of 4 analogs to disrupt mVP40-Nedd4 interactions. NYFP-Nedd4 and appropriate CYFP-WT or PPxY mutants of mVP40 are co-expressed in HEK293T cells and the potency of inhibitors blocking fluorescent complementation of mVP40-Nedd4 complexes is visualized using an inverted Leica Sp5-II confocal microscope. Quantitative analysis of complementation is determined by scoring individual cells and the rate, localization, intensity, and kinetics of fluorescence accumulation to determine drug potency. A PPxY L- domain mutant of mVP40 that does not interact with Nedd4 is utilized as a negative control, and MTT cell viability assays is performed in triplicate for all analogs tested. Example 13: Egress Blockage of Live Virus in Cell Culture Compounds of the invention are evaluated for their ability to block egress of live virus in cell culture. To determine whether the compounds of the invention inhibit live virus budding, inhibitors of VP40-Nedd4 interactions and VLP egress are evaluated for their ability to reduce live virus production. In certain embodiments, the compounds are tested for their ability to block budding of live VSV-WT or VSV-PPxY mutants (Figs. 12A-12C). In other embodiments, the compounds of the invention are evaluated for their ability to block PPxY-dependent budding of live WT or PPxY mutants of rabies virus. In yet other embodiments, VSV recombinants that possess WT PPxY or PPxY mutant L-domains and flanking sequences derived from Marburg virus VP40 and Lassa fever Z proteins are generated. VSV recombinants expressing heterologous L-domains from filoviruses or arenaviruses serve as valuable BSL-2 tools and allow for the accurate assessment of the efficacy of Nedd4 inhibitors on live virus egress. Standard PCR and cloning techniques and reverse-genetics approach are used to replace sequences in the full- length cDNA of VSV encoding the L-domain and flanking residues of VSV M protein with those from mVP40 and Lassa Z protein.
