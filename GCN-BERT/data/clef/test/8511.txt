(Reference Example 26) Synthesis of (E)-methyl 3-(1-isopropyl-1H-imidazol-2-yl)acrylate:
Methyl (triphenylphosphoranylidene)acetate (0.932 g, 2.79 mmol) was added to a solution of 1-isopropyl-1H-imidazole-2-carbaldehyde (0.350 mg, 2.53 mmol) in dichloromethane (7.59 mL) at room temperature. The reaction liquid was stirred for 16 hours and then concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was washed with a mixed solvent of hexane/dichloromethane = 20/1 and the washing solution was concentrated. The residue was purified by flash column chromatography (silica gel, hexane/ethyl acetate) to obtain (E)-methyl 3-(1-isopropyl-1H-imidazol-2-yl)acrylate (0.362 g, 1.86 mmol, 74%) as a white solid.
