BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to host cells that may be used to prepare mevalonate kinase, mevalonate-5-phosphate, and isoprenoid compounds. 2. Discussion of the Background Natural rubber is a very important raw material in tire and rubber industries. While its demand will be expanded in the future due to motorization mainly in emerging countries, it is laborious to increase the number of agricultural farms dedicated to rubber in view of regulation of deforestation and competition with palm plantations. Thus, the balance of demand and supply is predicted to become tight. Synthesized polyisoprene is available as a substitute for natural rubber. Polyisoprene's raw material monomer (isoprene (2-methyl-1,3-butadiene)) is mainly obtained by extracting from a C5 fraction obtained by cracking of naphtha. However in recent years, with the use of light feed crackers, an amount of produced isoprene tends to decrease and reliable supply is a concern. Also in recent years, since variation in oil prices impacts production greatly, there is a need to establish a system in which isoprene derived from non-oil sources is produced inexpensively to stably ensure the supply of isoprene monomer. In view of such need, a method in which the isoprene monomer is produced using a transformant obtained by introducing an isoprene synthase gene and a mutant thereof derived from isolated kudzu or poplar into a microorganism for fermental production has been described in JP 2011-505841 and JP 2011-518564. It has been described in Yuliya, A., et al., Appl. Environ. Microbiol., vol. 77 (No. 21), pp. 7772-77-78, 2011, that mevalonate kinase, an enzyme in a mevalonate pathway, is inhibited by DMAPP, a metabolite in the mevalonate pathway. A method of producing an isoprene monomer using a transformant obtained by introducing a mevalonate kinase derived from isolated Methanosarcina mazei into a microorganism for fermental production has been described in WO 2010/031062. Also, a method of producing an isoprene monomer using a transformant obtained by introducing a mevalonate kinase derived from actinomyces or lactobacillus into a microorganism for fermental production has been described in WO 2010/031077. Further, as described in Martin, V. J., et al., Nature Biotechnology, vol. 21 (No. 7), pp. 796-802, 2003, isoprene is one of the isoprenoids, and a reaction catalyzed by the mevalonate kinase is a rate-limiting step when isoprenoids are produced by fermentation of microorganisms. Other relevant description can be found in WO 2010/031062, WO 2010/031077, Kesselmeier, J., et al., Journal of Atmospheric Chemistry, vol. 33, pp. 23-88, 1999, Monson, R. K., et al., Plant Physiol., vol. 98, pp. 1175-1180, 1992, and Kuzma, J., et al., Plant Physiol., vol. 101, pp. 435-440, 1993.

[15] A method of producing an isoprene polymer, comprising following (I) and (II): (I) forming the isoprene monomer by the method as described above; and (II) polymerizing the isoprene monomer to form the isoprene polymer. Of course the present invention is not intended to be limited to the foregoing exemplary embodiments. In embodiments, the present invention provides a transformant that expresses a mevalonate kinase. The mevalonate kinase is encoded by a gene derived from an organism that is different species from a host for the transformant, and derived from, for example, a microorganism belonging to the genus Methanocella, the genus Corynebacterium, the genus Methanosaeta, or the genus Nitrosopumilus. Preferably, the mevalonate kinase is derived from a microorganism belonging to Corynebacterium variabile, Methanocella paludicola, Methanosaeta concilii, or Nitrosopumilus maritimus. In one embodiment, the mevalonate kinase is a protein that comprises an amino acid sequence having 70% or more amino acid sequence identity to an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:1 which can be derived from the genus Methanocella, SEQ ID NO:3 which can be derived from the genus Corynebacterium, SEQ ID NO:6 which can be derived from the genus Methanosaeta or SEQ ID NO:9 which can be derived from the genus Nitrosopumilus, and has a mevalonate kinase activity. The amino acid sequence percent identity may be, for example, 75% or more, 80% or more, 85% or more, 90% or more, 95% or more, 96% or more, 97% or more, 98% or more, or 99% or more. The mevalonate kinase activity refers to an activity of phosphorylating mevalonic acid to form mevalonate-5-phosphate (EC No. 2.7.1.36) (hereinafter, the same meaning shall be applied). The percent identity of the amino acid sequences and the percent identity of the nucleotide sequences as described later can be determined using the BLAST algorithm (Pro. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 90, 5873 (1993)) by Karlin and Altschul, and the FASTA algorithm (Methods Enzymol., 183, 63 (1990)) by Pearson. The programs referred to as BLASTP and BLASTN were developed based on the BLAST algorithm (see http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Thus, the percent identity of the nucleotide sequences and the amino acid sequences may be calculated using these programs with default settings. Also, for example, a numerical value obtained by calculating similarity as a percentage at a setting of “unit size to compare=2” using the full length of a polypeptide portion encoded in ORF with the software GENETYX Ver. 7.0.9 from Genetyx Corporation employing the Lipman-Pearson method may be used as the homology of the amino acid sequences. The lowest value among the values derived from these calculations may be employed as the percent identity of the nucleotide sequences and the amino acid sequences. In another embodiment, the mevalonate kinase is a protein that comprises an amino acid sequence having a mutation of one or several amino acids in the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:1, SEQ ID NO:3, SEQ ID NO:6, or SEQ ID NO:9, and has the mevalonate kinase activity. Examples of the mutation of the amino acid residues may include deletion, substitution, addition and insertion of amino acid residues. The mutation of one or several amino acids may be introduced into one region or multiple different regions in the amino acid sequence. The term “one or several” indicates a range in which a three-dimensional structure and an activity of the protein are not impaired greatly. In the case of the protein, the number represented by “one or several” can be, for example, 1 to 100, preferably 1 to 80, more preferably 1 to 50, 1 to 30, 1 to 20, 1 to 10, or 1 to 5. The mevalonate kinase may have a tag for purification, such as a histidine tag. The mevalonate kinase preferably has an mevalonate kinase activity that is 50% or more, 60% or more, 70% or more, 80% or more, 90% or more, or 95% or more of the mevalonate kinase activity of the protein comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:1, SEQ ID NO:3, SEQ ID NO:6, or SEQ ID NO:9 when measured under the same conditions. Known methods can be used to measure the mevalonate kinase activity (e.g., Andreassi, et al., Biochemistry, 43, 16461-16466, 2004, Fu, et al., Biochemistry, 47, 3715-3724, 2008, Primak, et al., Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 77, 7772-7778). Also, the mevalonate kinase preferably has an ability of cancelling feedback inhibition by a substrate in a pathway of isoprenoid biosynthesis (e.g., phosphomevalonic acid, diphosphomevalonic acid, isopentenyl-2-phosphate, dimethylallyl pyrophosphate, geranyl pyrophosphate, farnesyl pyrophosphate) (Primak, et al., Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 77, 7772-7778), and for example, preferably has the ability of cancelling feedback inhibition, that is 50% or more, 60% or more, 70% or more, 80% or more, 90% or more, or 95% or more of the ability of cancelling feedback inhibition possessed by the protein consisting of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:1, SEQ ID NO:3, SEQ ID NO:6, or SEQ ID NO:9 when measured under the same conditions. In the mevalonate kinase, the mutation may be introduced into sites in a catalytic domain and sites other than the catalytic domain as long as an objective activity is retained. The positions of amino acid residues to be mutated which are capable of retaining the objective activity are understood by a person skilled in the art (Bai, et al., US 2007/0141685 and US 2007/0286850). Specifically, a person skilled in the art can recognize a correlation between structure and function, since a person skilled in the art can 1) compare the amino acid sequences of multiple proteins having the same type of activity (e.g., the amino acid sequences of SEQ ID NO:1, SEQ ID NO:3, SEQ ID NO:6, SEQ ID NO:9 and SEQ ID NO:12), 2) clarify regions that are relatively conserved and regions that are not relatively conserved, and then 3) predict regions capable of playing a functionally important role and regions incapable of playing a functionally important role from the regions that are relatively conserved and the regions that are not relatively conserved, respectively. Therefore, a person skilled in the art can identify the positions of the amino acid residues to be mutated in the amino acid sequence of the mevalonate kinase. When the amino acid residue is mutated by substitution, the substitution of the amino acid residue may be conservative substitution. As used herein, the term “conservative substitution” refers to substitution of a certain amino acid residue with an amino acid residue having a similar side chain. Families of amino acid residues having similar side chains are well-known in the art. Examples of such families may include amino acids having a basic side chain (e.g., lysine, arginine, histidine), amino acids having an acidic side chain (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid), amino acids having a non-charged polar side chain (e.g., asparagine, glutamine, serine, threonine, tyrosine, cysteine), amino acids having a non-polar side chain (e.g., glycine, alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, proline, phenylalanine, methionine, tryptophan), amino acids having a branched side chain at position β (e.g., threonine, valine, isoleucine), amino acids having an aromatic side chain (e.g., tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, histidine), amino acids having a hydroxyl group-containing (e.g., alcoholic, phenolic) side chain (e.g., serine, threonine, tyrosine), and amino acids having a sulfur-containing side chain (e.g., cysteine, methionine). Preferably, the conservative substitution of the amino acids may be the substitution between aspartic acid and glutamic acid, the substitution among arginine, lysine and histidine, the substitution between tryptophan and phenylalanine, the substitution between phenylalanine and valine, the substitution among leucine, isoleucine and alanine, and the substitution between glycine and alanine. Embodiments of the transformant of the present invention can be obtained by transforming a host cell with an expression vector for a desired protein such as the above mevalonate kinase. In embodiments, the transformant of the present invention expressing a desired protein comprises an expression unit comprising a polynucleotide encoding the desired protein and a promoter operatively linked thereto, which are contained in the expression vector. In the expression unit, one of the polynucleotide encoding the desired protein and the promoter is not inherent in the host cell. Therefore, the expression unit may be a heterogenous expression unit. Preferably, both the polynucleotide encoding the desired protein and the promoter are not inherent in the host cell. The promoter may be homologous or heterologous to the polynucleotide encoding the desired protein. The expression unit may further comprise additional elements such as a terminator, a ribosome-binding site, and a drug-resistance gene. The expression unit may be DNA or RNA and is preferably DNA. Examples of the desired protein include, but not limited to, a mevalonate kinase, an isoprene synthase, one or more enzymes involved in a methylerythritol phosphate pathway, and one or more enzymes involved in a mevalonate pathway. In embodiments, in the expression vector, a polynucleotide encoding the mevalonate kinase may comprise a polynucleotide that comprises a nucleotide sequence having 70% or more nucleotide sequence identity to a nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:2 which can be derived from the genus Methanocella, SEQ ID NO:4 or SEQ ID NO:5 which can be derived from the genus Corynebacterium, SEQ ID NO:7 or SEQ ID NO:8 which can be derived from the genus Methanosaeta or SEQ ID NO:10 or SEQ ID NO:11 which can be derived from the genus Nitrosopumilus, and encodes a protein having the mevalonate kinase activity. The nucleotide sequence percent identity may be 70% or more, 75% or more, 80% or more, 85% or more, 90% or more, 95% or more, 96% or more, 97% or more, 98% or more, or 99% or more. In embodiments, the polynucleotide encoding the mevalonate kinase is a polynucleotide that hybridizes with a polynucleotide consisting of a nucleotide sequence complementary to a nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:2, SEQ ID NO:4, SEQ ID NO:5, SEQ ID NO:7, SEQ ID NO:8, SEQ ID NO:10 or SEQ ID NO:11 under a stringent condition, and encodes the protein having the mevalonate kinase activity. The “stringent condition” refers to a condition where a so-called specific hybrid is formed whereas a non-specific hybrid is not formed. For example, such a condition is the condition where substantially the same polynucleotides having the high identity, for example, the polynucleotides having the percent identity described above hybridize to each other whereas polynucleotides having the lower identity than above do not hybridize to each other. Specifically, such a condition may include hybridization in 6×SCC (sodium chloride/sodium citrate) at about 45° C. followed by one or two or more washings in 0.2×SCC and 0.1% SDS at 50 to 65° C. In embodiments, the transformant of the present invention may express an isoprene synthase (EC: 4.2.3.27). For example, the isoprene synthase derived from kudzu (Pueraria montana var. lobata), poplar (Populus alba x Populus tremula), and mucuna (Mucuna bracteata) can be used as the isoprene synthase. In one embodiment, the isoprene synthase may be, for example, a protein as follows: 1) a full-length protein which may be derived from kudzu (the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:15); 2) a protein obtained by deleting a chloroplast localization signal from the full-length protein in 1) above (amino acid sequence obtained by deleting amino acid residues at positions 1 to 45 in the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:15); 3) a full-length protein which may be derived from poplar (the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:98); 4) a protein obtained by deleting a chloroplast localization signal from the full-length protein in 3) above (amino acid sequence obtained by deleting amino acid residues at positions 1 to 37 in the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 98); 5) a full-length protein which may be derived from mucuna (the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:99); and 6) a protein obtained by deleting a chloroplast localization signal from the full-length protein in 5) above (amino acid sequence obtained by deleting amino acid residues at positions 1 to 44 in the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:99). In a preferred embodiment, the isoprene synthase may be derived from kudzu. In another preferred embodiment, the isoprene synthase may be derived from poplar. In still another preferred embodiment, the isoprene synthase may be derived from mucuna. In another embodiment, the isoprene synthase is a protein that comprises an amino acid sequence having 70% or more amino acid sequence identity to the amino acid sequence of the proteins of 1) to 6) above, and has an isoprene synthase activity. The amino acid sequence percent identity may be, for example, 75% or more, 80% or more, 85% or more, 90% or more, 95% or more, 96% or more, 97% or more, 98% or more, or 99% or more. The isoprene synthase activity refers to an activity of forming isoprene from dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) (hereinafter, the same meaning shall be applied). The known methods can be used to measure the isoprene synthase activity (e.g., Sharkey, T. D., et al., Plant Physiology, 137, 700-712, 2005). In still another embodiment, the isoprene synthase is a protein that comprises an amino acid sequence having a mutation of one or several amino acids in the amino acid sequence of the protein of 1) to 6) above, and has an isoprene synthase activity. Examples of the mutation of the amino acid residues may include deletion, substitution, addition and insertion of amino acid residues. The mutation of one or several amino acids may be introduced into one region or multiple different regions in the amino acid sequence. The term “one or several” indicates a range in which a three-dimensional structure and an activity of the protein are not impaired greatly. In the case of the protein, the number represented by “one or several” is, for example, 1 to 100, preferably 1 to 80, more preferably 1 to 50, 1 to 30, 1 to 20, 1 to 10, or 1 to 5. The mevalonate kinase may have a tag for purification, such as a histidine tag. The isoprene synthase preferably can have an isoprene synthase activity that is 50% or more, 60% or more, 70% or more, 80% or more, 90% or more, or 95% or more of the isoprene synthase activity of the protein of 1) to 6) above when measured under the same conditions. In terms of stability, it is also preferable that the isoprene synthase has a remaining activity that is 30% or more, 40% or more, 50% or more, 60% or more or 65% or more of the original activity when stored in a certain buffer [e.g., a solution of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and 0.15 mM MgCl2] at 4° C. for 48 hours. In the isoprene synthase, the mutation may be introduced into sites in a catalytic domain and sites other than the catalytic domain as long as an objective activity is retained. The positions of amino acid residues to be mutated which are capable of retaining the objective activity are understood by a person skilled in the art. Specifically, a person skilled in the art can recognize a correlation between structure and function, since a person skilled in the art can 1) compare the amino acid sequences of multiple proteins having the same type of activity, 2) clarify regions that are relatively conserved and regions that are not relatively conserved, and then 3) predict regions capable of playing a functionally important role and regions incapable of playing a functionally important role from the regions that are relatively conserved and the regions that are not relatively conserved, respectively. Therefore, a person skilled in the art can identify the positions of the amino acid residues to be mutated in the amino acid sequence of the isoprene synthase. When an amino acid residue is mutated by substitution, the substitution of the amino acid residue may be the conservative substitution as described above. The expression vector for a desired protein such as the mevalonate kinase, which is utilized for making exemplary transformants according to the present invention, is a cell expression vector in which a protein is expressed in a host. The expression vector may also be a non-integrative vector (e.g., a plasmid, a phage, an artificial chromosome) or an integrative vector. The expression vector may be further a DNA vector or an RNA vector. A known vector suitable for the host cell is used as the cell expression vector. Examples of the expression vector may include ColE-based plasmids typified by pBR322 derivatives, pACYC-based plasmids having a p15A origin, pSC-based plasmids, and mini F plasmids derived from an F factor of Bac and the like in Escherichia coli. In addition, expression vectors having a tryptophan promoter such as trc and tac, a lac promoter, a T7 promoter, a T5 promoter, a T3 promoter, an SP6 promoter, an arabinose induction promoter, a cold shock induction promoter, a tetracycline induction promoter, and the like may also be included. Protein synthesis using the cell expression vector will be described later. A protein synthesized using the cell expression vector may be purified. Examples of the methods for purification may include methods using a salting-out method and various chromatographic methods. When the expression vector is designed to express a tag sequence such as a histidine tag at an N terminus or a C terminus of the objective protein, a method for purification using affinity chromatography using a substance such as nickel or cobalt having an affinity to this tag can be employed. In addition, ion exchange chromatography, gel filtration chromatography, or the like may be combined appropriately and utilized for the purification. The transformant of the present invention is one obtained by introducing the expression vector of the present invention into a host.

The phrase “ability to synthesize dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP)” is used with reference to Michelle C. Y. Chang and Jay D. Keasling, Nature Chemical Biology 2, 674-681 (2006). The phrase “mevalonic acid (MVA) pathway” is used with reference to Kuzuyama, T., and Seto, H., Proc Jpn Acad Ser B Phys Biol Sci. 88,41-52 (2012), and Miziorko, H. M., Arch Biochem Biophys. 505,131-143 (2011). The phrase “methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway” is used with reference to Kuzuyama, T., and Seto, H., Proc Jpn Acad Ser B Phys Biol Sci. 88,41-52 (2012), and Gräwert, T., et al., Cell Mol Life Sci. 68, 3797-3814 (2011). In embodiments of the transformant of the present invention, the pathway to synthesize dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) that is the substrate of the isoprene synthase may be enhanced. For such an enhancement, an expression vector that expresses an isopentenyl-diphosphate delta isomerase having an ability to convert isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) into dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) may be introduced into the transformant of the present invention. An expression vector that expresses one or more enzymes involved in the mevalonate pathway and/or methylerythritol phosphate pathway associated with formation of IPP and/or DMAPP may also be introduced into the transformant of the present invention. The expression vector for such an enzyme may be a plasmid or an integrative vector. The expression vector for such an enzyme may also be a DNA vector or an RNA vector. The expression vector for such an enzyme may express further a plurality of enzymes (e.g., one, two, three or four or more) involved in the mevalonate pathway and/or the methylerythritol phosphate pathway, and may be, for example, an expression vector for polycistronic mRNA. Origin of one or more enzymes involved in the mevalonate pathway and/or the methylerythritol phosphate pathway may be homologous or heterologous to the host. When the origin of the enzyme involved in the mevalonate pathway and/or the methylerythritol phosphate pathway is heterologous to the host, for example, the host may be a bacterium as described above (e.g., Escherichia coli) and the enzyme involved in the mevalonate pathway may be derived from a fungus (e.g., Saccharomyces cerevisiae). In addition, when the host inherently produces the enzyme involved in the methylerythritol phosphate pathway, an expression vector to be introduced into the host may express one or a plurality of enzymes (e.g., one, two, three or four or more) involved in the mevalonate pathway.

The introduction of the expression vector incorporating a gene into a host (transformation) can be carried out using known methods. Examples of such a method may include a competent cell method using a microbial cell treated with calcium and an electroporation method. The gene may be introduced by infecting the microbial cell with a phage vector rather than the plasmid vector. Further, a gene encoding the enzyme involved in the mevalonate pathway or the methylerythritol phosphate pathway that synthesizes dimethylallyl diphosphate that is the substrate of the isoprene synthase may also be introduced into the transformant of the present invention. Examples of such an enzyme may include 1-deoxy-D-xylose-5-phosphate synthase that converts a pyruvate and D-glycelaldehyde-3-phosphate into 1-deoxy-D-xylose-5-phosphate, and isopentyl diphosphate isomerase that converts isopentenyl diphosphate into dimethylallyl diphosphate. In embodiments of the transformant of the present invention, one or plural (e.g., 2, 3, 4 or 5) specific genomic regions (e.g., coding or non-coding regions) may be destroyed. Examples of such a genomic region include crt operon (coding for isoprenoid biosynthesis pathway such as polyprenyl synthetase, beta-carotene hydroxylase, phytoene synthase, phytoene dehydrogenase, lycopene cyclase and so on), and amp gene (e.g., ampC gene or ampH gene). For example, destruction of the crt operon may be advantageous as the production of isoprenoid compounds can be suppressed. The destruction of the amp gene may be advantageous as the ampicillin-resistance gene (a drug-resistance selectable marker) can be utilized. The term “disrupted” for a gene means that a gene-coding region is modified so as to decrease or completely lose a function or expression of a protein encoded by the gene. The term “disrupted” for an operon means that a genomic region corresponding to the operon is modified so as to decrease or completely lose a function of the operon. When a function of an operon that can act as an enhancer (e.g., the aforementioned crt operon) is decreased or completely lost, an expression of a protein encoded by a gene operatively linked to the operon can be decreased or completely lost. On the other hand, when a function of an operon that can act as a suppressor is decreased or completely lost, an expression of a protein encoded by a gene operatively linked to the operon can be increased. Examples of the modification include, but not limited to, insertion, deletion and replacement. The genomic region may be destroyed by introducing the aforementioned gene (e.g., mevalonate kinase gene) into the genomic region according to a gene targeting method previously known. The mevalonate kinase may be extracted or purified from the transformant of the present invention, and isoprene may be produced by culturing the transformant that expresses the mevalonate kinase. Methods for Producing Mevalonate-5-Phosphate, Isoprenoid Compound and Isoprene Polymer Embodiments of the present invention include methods of producing mevalonate-5-phosphate. In embodiments, the method of producing mevalonate-5-phosphate according to the present invention comprises forming mevalonate-5-phosphate from mevalonic acid using the transformant of the present invention. In embodiments of the method of producing mevalonate-5-phosphate according to the present invention, mevalonic acid that is a raw material for mevalonate-5-phosphate can be utilized efficiently by the transformant of the present invention. For example, mevalonic acid may be synthesized from the carbon source in the culture medium via a biosynthetic pathway such as a mevalonate pathway in the host. Alternatively, mevalonic acid may be added to the culture medium. Embodiments of the present invention also include methods of producing an isoprenoid compound. In embodiments, the method of producing the isoprenoid compound according to the present invention comprises forming the isoprenoid compound using the transformant of the present invention. The isoprenoid compound includes one or more isoprene units which have the molecular formula (C5H8)n. The precursor of the isoprene unit may be isopentenyl pyrophosphate or dimethylallyl pyrophosphate. More than 30,000 kinds of isoprenoid compounds have been identified and new compounds have been identified. Isoprenoids are also known as terpenoids. The difference between terpenes and terpenoids is that terpenes are hydrocarbons, whereas terpenoids may contain additional functional groups. Terpenes are classified by the number of isoprene units in the molecule: hemiterpenes (C5), monoterpenes (C10), sesquiterpenes (C15), diterpenes (C20), sesterterpenes (C25), triterpenes (C30), sesquarterpenes (C35), tetraterpenes (C40), polyterpenes, norisoprenoids, for example. Examples of monoterpenes include pinene, nerol, citral, camphor, menthol, limonene, and linalool. Examples of sesquiterpenes include nerolidol and farnesol. Examples of diterpenes include phytol and vitamin A1. Squalene is an example of a triterpene, and carotene (provitamin A1) is a tetraterpene (Nature Chemical Biology 2, 674-681 (2006), Nature Chemical Biology 5, 283-291 (2009) Nature Reviews Microbiology 3, 937-947 (2005), Adv Biochem Eng Biotechmol (DOI: 10.1007/10—2014—288). Preferably, the isoprenoid compound is an isoprene monomer. When the isoprenoid compound is an isoprene monomer, the transformant of the present invention may produce the isoprene monomer mainly as an outgas from the carbon source in the culture medium, and thus the isoprene monomer may be recovered by collecting gas generated by the transformant. Dimethylallyl diphosphate that is a raw material for the isoprene monomer may be synthesized from the carbon source in the culture medium via the mevalonate pathway or the methylerythritol phosphate pathway in the host. Alternatively, dimethylallyl diphosphate may be added to the medium. The culture medium for culturing the transformant of the present invention preferably contains the carbon source to be converted into mevalonic acid or isoprene. The carbon source may include carbohydrates such as monosaccharides, disaccharides, oligosaccharides and polysaccharides; invert sugars obtained by hydrolyzing sucrose; glycerol; compounds having one carbon atom (hereinafter referred to as a C1 compound) such as methanol, formaldehyde, formate, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide; oils such as corn oil, palm oil and soybean oil; acetate; animal fats; animal oils; fatty acids such as saturated fatty acids and unsaturated fatty acids; lipids; phospholipids; glycerolipids; glycerine fatty acid esters such as monoglyceride, diglyceride and triglyceride; polypeptides such as microbial proteins and plant proteins; renewable carbon sources such as hydrolyzed biomass carbon sources; yeast extracts, or combinations thereof.

Examples of the polysaccharides may include glycogen, starch (amylose, amylopectin), cellulose, dextrin, and glucan (β1,3-glucan). Starch and cellulose are preferable. Examples of the microbial protein may include polypeptides obtainable from a yeast or bacterium. Examples of the plant protein may include polypeptides obtainable from soybean, corn, canola, Jatropha, palm, peanut, sunflower, coconut, mustard, cotton seed, palm kernel oil, olive, safflower, sesame and linseed. Examples of the lipid may include substances containing one or more saturated or unsaturated fatty acids of C4 or more. The oil is preferably the lipid that contains one or more saturated or unsaturated fatty acids of C4 or more and is liquid at room temperature, and examples of the oil may include lipids obtainable from soybean, corn, canola, Jatropha, palm, peanut, sunflower, coconut, mustard, cotton seed, Palm kernel oil, olive, safflower, sesame, linseed, oily microbial cells, Chinese tallow tree, and a combination of two or more thereof. Examples of the fatty acid may include compounds represented by a formula RCOOH (“R” represents a hydrocarbon group). The unsaturated fatty acid is a compound having at least one double bond between two carbon atoms in “R”, and examples of the unsaturated fatty acid may include oleic acid, vaccenic acid, linoleic acid, palmitelaidic acid and arachidonic acid. The saturated fatty acid is a compound where the “R” is a saturated aliphatic group, and examples of the saturated fatty acid may include docosanoic acid, eicosanoic acid, octadecanoic acid, hexadecanoic acid, tetradecanoic acid, and dodecanoic acid. Among them, those containing one or more C2 to C22 fatty acids are preferable as the fatty acid, and those containing C12 fatty acid, C14 fatty acid, C16 fatty acid, C18 fatty acid, C20 fatty acid and C22 fatty acid are more preferable. The carbon source may include salts and derivatives of these fatty acids and salts of these derivatives. Examples of the salt may include lithium salts, potassium salts and sodium salts. Examples of the carbon source may also include combinations of carbohydrate such as glucose with the lipid(s), the oil(s), the fats, the fatty acid(s) and glycerin fatty acid(s) ester(s). Examples of the renewable carbon source may include hydrolyzed biomass carbon sources. Examples of the biomass carbon source may include cellulose-based substrates such as waste materials of woods, papers and pulps, leafy plants, and fruit pulps; and partial plants such as stalks, grain particles, roots and tubers. Examples of the plants to be used as the biomass carbon source may include corn, wheat, rye, sorghum, triticale, rice, millet, barley, cassava, legumes such as peas, potato, sweet potato, banana, sugar cane and tapioca. When the renewable carbon source such as biomass is added to the culture medium, the carbon source is preferably pretreated. Examples of the pretreatment may include an enzymatic pretreatment, a chemical pretreatment, and a combination of the enzymatic pretreatment and the chemical pretreatment. It is preferred that the renewable carbon source is entirely or partially hydrolyzed before being added to the culture medium (Kumar et al., Ind. Eng. Chem. Res., 48, 3713-3729, 2009). Examples of the carbon source may also include the yeast extract and a combination of the yeast extract with the other carbon source such as glucose. The combination of the yeast extract with the C1 compound such as carbon dioxide and methanol is preferable. In exemplary methods of culturing the transformant in connection with the present invention, it is preferable to culture the cell in a standard medium containing saline and nutrients. The culture medium is not particularly limited, and examples of the culture medium may include ready-made general media that are commercially available such as Luria Bertani (LB) broth, Sabouraud dextrose (SD) broth, and yeast medium (YM) broth. The medium suitable for the cultivation of the specific host can be selected appropriately for the use. It is desirable to include appropriate minerals, salts, supplemental elements, buffers, and ingredients known for those skilled in the art to be suitable for the cultivation and to facilitate the production of isoprene in addition to the appropriate carbon source in the cell medium. It is preferable to add sugar, a metal salt, an antimicrobial substance, and the like to the culture medium in order to keep the expression of the objective protein in the transformant of the present invention. A culture condition for the transformant of the present invention is not particularly limited as long as the objective protein can be expressed, and a standard cell culture condition can be used. A culture temperature is preferably 20 to 37° C., a gas composition is preferably about 6 to 84% of CO2 concentration, and a pH value is preferably about 5 to about 9. The transformant is preferably cultured under an aerobic, oxygen-free, or anaerobic condition depending on a nature of the host. Examples of methods of culturing the transformant include a method using a known fermentation method such as a batch cultivation method, a feeding cultivation method or a continuous cultivation method. In the batch cultivation method, a medium composition is added at start of the fermentation, and the transformant is inoculated in the medium composition and cultured while pH and an oxygen concentration are controlled. In the cultivation of the transformant by the batch cultivation method, the growth of the transformant starts from a mild induction phase, passes through a logarithmic growth phase and finally goes to a stationary phase in which a growth speed is reduced or stopped. Isoprene is produced by the transformant in the logarithmic growth phase and the stationary phase. In the feeding cultivation method, in addition to the above batch method, the carbon source is gradually added according to the progress of a fermentation process. The feeding cultivation method is effective when an amount of the carbon source is to be restricted in the medium because metabolism of the transformant tends to be reduced due to catabolite suppression. The feed cultivation can be performed using a restricted amount or an excessive amount of the carbon source such as glucose. In the continuous cultivation method, a certain amount of the medium is continuously supplied to a bioreactor at a constant rate while the same amount of the medium is removed. In the continuous cultivation method, the culture can be kept constantly at high concentration and the transformant in the culture medium is generally in the logarithmic growth phase. The nutrition can be supplemented by entirely or partly exchanging the medium appropriately, and accumulation of metabolic byproducts that potentially have adverse effects on the growth of the transformant, and the accumulation of dead cells can be prevented. A promoter possessed by the expression vector may include constitutive promoters and inducible promoters. When the expression vector has the inducible promoter such as a lac promoter, the expression of the objective protein may be induced by, for example, adding IPTG (isopropyl-β-thiogalactopyranoside) into the culture medium. Examples of methods of evaluating an amount of isoprene produced by culturing the transformant of the present invention may include a method in which a gas phase is collected by a headspace method and this gas phase is analyzed by gas chromatography. In detail, the isoprene monomer in a headspace which is obtained by culturing the transformant in a sealed vial with shaking the culture medium is analyzed by standard gas chromatography. Then, an area calculated by a curve measured by gas chromatography is converted into the amount of the isoprene monomer produced with the transformant using a standard curve. Examples of the method of collecting the isoprene monomer obtained by culturing the transformant of the present invention may include gas stripping, fractional distillation, or dissociation of the isoprene monomer adsorbed to a solid phase by heat or vacuum, or extraction with a solvent. In the gas stripping, isoprene gas is continuously removed from the outgas. Such removal of the isoprene gas can be performed by various methods. Examples of the removal may include adsorption to the solid phase, separation into a liquid phase, and a method in which the isoprene gas is directly condensed. The isoprene monomer can be collected by a single step or multiple steps. When the isoprene monomer is collected by the single step, the isoprene monomer is converted into the liquid phase simultaneously with separating the isoprene monomer from the outgas. The isoprene monomer can also be directly condensed from the outgas to make the liquid phase. When the isoprene monomer is collected by the multiple stages, the isoprene monomer is separated from off-gas and subsequently converted into the liquid phase. For example, the isoprene monomer is adsorbed to the solid phase, and extracted from the solid phase with the solvent. Exemplary methods of collecting the isoprene monomer may comprise further purifying the isoprene monomer. Examples of the purification may include separation from a liquid phase extract by distillation and various chromatographic methods. Embodiments of the present invention include a method of producing an isoprene polymer. The method of producing the isoprene polymer according to the present invention may comprise the following (I) and (II): (I) forming an isoprene monomer by an exemplary method of the present invention; and (II) polymerizing the isoprene monomer to form an isoprene polymer. The step (I) can be performed in the same manner as in the exemplary methods of producing the isoprene monomer according to the present invention described above. The polymerization of the isoprene monomer in the step (II) can be performed by any method known in the art (e.g., synthesis methods such as addition polymerization in organic chemistry). Method for Producing a Rubber Composition In embodiments, the rubber composition of the present invention comprises a polymer derived from isoprene produced by an exemplary method for producing isoprene according to the present invention. The polymer derived from isoprene may be a homopolymer (i.e., isoprene polymer) or a heteropolymer comprising isoprene and one or more monomer units other than the isoprene (e.g., a copolymer such as a block copolymer). Preferably, the polymer derived from isoprene is a homopolymer (i.e., isoprene polymer) produced by an exemplary method for producing isoprene polymer according to the present invention. In embodiments, the rubber composition of the present invention may further comprise one or more polymers other than the above polymer, one or more rubber components, and/or other components. The rubber composition of the present invention can be manufactured using a polymer derived from isoprene. For example, the rubber composition of the present invention can be prepared by mixing a polymer derived from isoprene with one or more polymers other than the above polymer, one or more rubber components, and/or other components such as a reinforcing filler, a crosslinking agent, a vulcanization accelerator and an antioxidant. Method for Producing a Tire In embodiments, the tire of the present invention is manufactured using the rubber composition of the present invention. The rubber composition of the present invention may be applied to any portion of the tire without limitation, which may be selected as appropriate depending on the application thereof. For example, the rubber composition of the present invention may be used in a tread, a base tread, a sidewall, a side reinforcing rubber and a bead filler of a tire. The tire can be manufactured by a conventional method. For example, a carcass layer, a belt layer, a tread layer, which are composed of unvulcanized rubber, and other members used for the production of usual tires may be successively laminated on a tire molding drum, then the drum may be withdrawn to obtain a green tire. Thereafter, the green tire may be heated and vulcanized in accordance with an ordinary method, to thereby obtain a desired tire (e.g., a pneumatic tire).

Where the solids content of a dispersion or solution is reported, it expresses the weight of solids based on the total weight of the dispersion or solution, respectively. Where a molecular weight is specified, it is the molecular weight range ascribed to the product by the commercial supplier, which is identified. Generally this is believed to be weight average molecular weight.

TABLE 2 OD value and amount of produced isoprene (mg/L) when culture of each microbial strain was terminated Strains OD600 Isoprene (mg/L) (1) 3.29 ± 0.01 0.53 ± 0.0 (2) 3.63 ± 0.01 38.0 ± 1.2 (3) 2.56 ± 0.60 437.8 ± 65.3 (4) 2.08 ± 0.10 327.7 ± 100.4 (5) 2.83 ± 0.21 369.0 ± 58.3 (6) 3.05 ± 0.05 453.3 ± 9.0 (7) 3.08 ± 0.01 52.4 ± 1.7 The strains as shown below were used: (1) MG1655::Ptac-KdyI/pWM-Para-mvaES-Ttrp/pSTV-Ptac-ispSK; (2) MG1655::Ptac-KdyI/pWM-Para-mvaES-Ttrp/pSTV-Ptac-ispSK-ERG12mvk; (3) MG1655::Ptac-KdyI/pWM-Para-mvaES-Ttrp/pSTV-Ptac-ispSK-Cvamvk; (4) MG1655::Ptac-KdyI/pWM-Para-mvaES-Ttrp/pSTV-Ptac-ispSK-Mclmvk; (5) MG1655::Ptac-KdyI/pWM-Para-mvaES-Ttrp/pSTV-Ptac-ispSK-Nmrmyk; (6) MG1655::Ptac-KdyI/pWM-Para-mvaES-Ttrp/pSTV-Ptac-ispSK-Mmamvk; and (7) MG1655::Ptac-KdyI/pWM-Para-mvaES-Ttrp/pSTV-Ptac-ispSK-Mpdmvk. E. coli MG1655 KdyI/pMW-Para-mvaES-Ttrp/pSTV-Ptac-ispSK strain having no gene encoding mevalonate kinase scarcely produced isoprene. On the other hand, the protein encoded by the ERG12 gene from the yeast and the protein encoded by the mvk gene from M. mazei are known to have a mevalonate kinase activity. E. coli MG1655 KdyI/pMW-Para-mvaES-Ttrp/pSTV-Ptac-ispSK-ERG12 strain and E. coli MG1655 KdyI/pMW-Para-mvaES-Ttrp/pSTV-Ptac-ispSK-Mmamvk strain in which these genes had been introduced accumulated isoprene in an amount of 38.0 mg/L and 453 mg/L, respectively. This confirmed that the reason why E. coli MG1655 KdyI/pMW-Para-mvaES-Ttrp/pSTV-Ptac-ispSK strain having no gene encoding mevalonate kinase scarcely produced isoprene is that the strain does not have the gene encoding mevalonate kinase. Also, the results shown in Table 2 indicate that it could be experimentally confirmed that the genes which were chosen as the genes encoding mevalonate kinase from genomic sequence information for Methanocella paludicola, Corynebacterium variabile, Methanosaeta concilii, and Nitrosopumilus maritimus actually encoded mevalonate kinase. That is, E. coli MG1655 KdyI/pMW-Para-mvaES-Ttrp/pSTV-Ptac-ispSK-Mpdmvk, E. coli MG1655 KdyI/pMW-Para-mvaES-Ttrp/pSTV-Ptac-ispSK-Cvamvk, E. coli MG1655 KdyI/pMW-Para-mvaES-Ttrp/pSTV-Ptac-ispSK-Mclmvk, and E. coli MG1655 KdyI/pMW-Para-mvaES-Ttrp/pSTV-Ptac-ispSK-Nmrmvk each produced isoprene in an amount of 52.4 mg/L, 437.8 mg/L, 327.7 mg/L and 369.0 mg/L. These amounts of produced isoprene were higher than the amounts in the case of introducing the ERG12 gene derived from the yeast. In particular, the amounts of isoprene produced by the strains introduced with each of the Cvamvk, Mclmvk and Nmrmvk genes are almost equivalent to the amount in the case of introducing the mvk gene derived from M. mazei. Example 3 Production of Isoprene Monomer Using Pantoea Ananatis 3.1 Construction of MVK Expression Plasmid MVK expression plasmids (pMW-Ptac-mvk-Ttrp) were constructed. PCR was performed with Prime Star polymerase (supplied from Takara Bio Inc.) using synthetic oligonucleotides consisting of the nucleotide sequences of cva_mvk_N (SEQ ID NO:57) and cva_mvk_C (SEQ ID NO:58) as the primers with pUC57-Cvamvk as the template, using synthetic oligonucleotides consisting of the nucleotide sequences of Mcl_mvk N (SEQ ID NO:59) and Mcl_mvkC (SEQ ID NO:60) as the primers with pUC57-Mclmvk as the template, using synthetic oligonucleotides consisting of the nucleotide sequences of Nmr_mvk_N (SEQ ID NO:61) and Nmr_mvk_C (SEQ ID NO:62) as the primers with pUC57-Nmrmvk as the template, and using synthetic oligonucleotides consisting of the nucleotide sequences of MMVKf (SEQ ID NO:63) and MMVKr (SEQ ID NO:64) as the primers with pUC57-Mmamvk as the template. A reaction solution was prepared according to the composition attached to the kit, and the reaction at 98° C. for 10 seconds, 55° C. for 5 seconds and 72° C. for one minute per kb was performed in 30 cycles. As a result, PCR products containing a Cvamvk gene, an Mclmvk gene, an Nmrmvk gene, or an Mmamvk gene were obtained. Likewise, pMW219-Ptac-Ttrp (see WO2013/069634A1) was amplified by PCR performed with Prime Star polymerase (supplied from Takara Bio Inc.) using synthetic oligonucleotides consisting of the nucleotide sequences of PtTt219f (SEQ ID NO:65) and PtTt219r (SEQ ID NO:66) as the primers. A reaction solution was prepared according to the composition attached to the kit, and the reaction at 98° C. for 10 seconds, 55° C. for 5 seconds and 72° C. for one minute per kb was performed in 30 cycles. As a result, a PCR product containing pMW219-Ptac-Ttrp was obtained. Subsequently, the purified PCR product of the Cvamvk gene, Mclmvk gene, Nmrmvk gene or Mmamvk gene was ligated to the PCR product of pMW219-Ptac-Ttrp using In-Fusion HD Cloning Kit (supplied from Clontech). The resulting expression plasmids for the Cvamvk gene, Mclmvk gene, Nmrmvk gene and Mmamvk gene were designated as pMW-Ptac-Cvamvk-Ttrp, pMW-Ptac-Mclmvk-Ttrp, pMW-Ptac-Nmrmvk-Ttrp, and pMW-Ptac-Mmamvk-Ttrp, respectively. 3.2 Construction of pTrc-KKDyI-ispS(K) First, an expression vector comprising a sequence in which mevalonate kinase, phosphomevalonate kinase, diphosphomevalonate dexarboxylase and isopentenyl diphosphate delta isomerase were aligned linearly was constructed by an In-fusion cloning method. A sequence of the mevalonate kinase and a sequence of the phosphomevalonate kinase were amplified by PCR using primers consisting of nucleotide sequences of SEQ ID NOS:67 to 70 with pUC-mvk-pmk (see, Example 7-2) of WO2013/179722A1) as a template. A sequence of the diphosphomevalonate dexarboxylase and a sequence of isopentenyl diphosphate delta isomerase were amplified by PCR using primers consisting of nucleotide sequences of SEQ ID NOS:67 to 70 with pTWV-dmd-yidi (see, Example 7-2) of WO2013/179722A1) as a template. Subsequently, these PCR products were cloned into pTrcHis2B vector by the In-fusion cloning method to construct an expression plasmid in which the four enzyme genes were aligned linearly. Prime Star HS DNA polymerase commercially available from Takara Bio Inc. was used as a PCR enzyme. The reaction at 98° C. for 2 minutes, (the reaction at 98° C. for 10 seconds, 52° C. for 5 seconds and 72° C. for one minute per kb)×30 cycles, and the reaction at 72° C. for 10 minutes were performed. The PCR fragments were inserted into pTrcHis2B vector digested with the restriction enzymes NcoI and PstI by the In-fusion cloning method to construct the expression vector. E. coli JM109 was transformed with the expression vector, a clone having an objective sequence length was selected, and subsequently the plasmid was extracted according to a standard method and sequence of the clone was confirmed. The constructed expression vector was designated as pTrc-KKDyI(α). A nucleotide sequence of pTrc-KKDyI(α) is shown in SEQ ID NO:71. Next, the plasmid pTrc-KKDyI-ispS(K) in which IspS(K) is added to pTrc-KKDyI(α) (SEQ ID NO:71) was constructed by the following procedure. pTrc-KKDyI(α) was digested with the restriction enzyme PstI (supplied from TAKARA BIO Inc.) to obtain pTrc-KKDyI(α)/PstI. PCR with pUC57-ispSK as the template was carried out using pTrcKKDyIkSS—6083-10-1 (SEQ ID NO:72) and pTrcKKDyIkSA—6083-10-2 (SEQ ID NO:73) as the primers and using Prime Star polymerase (supplied from TAKARA BIO Inc.). A reaction solution was prepared according to the composition attached to the kit, and the reaction at 98° C. for 10 seconds, 54° C. for 20 seconds and 68° C. for 120 seconds was carried out in 30 cycles. As a result, a PCR product containing the IspSK gene was obtained. Subsequently, the purified IspSK gene fragment was ligated to pTrc-KKDyI(α)/PstI using In-Fusion HD Cloning Kit (supplied from Clontech). The resulting plasmid was designated as pTrc-KKDyI-ispS(K) (SEQ ID NO:74). 3.3 Construction of the Integrative Conditionally Replicated Plasmids Carrying Genes of Upper and Lower Mevalonate Pathways To construct the integrative plasmids carrying genes of upper and lower mevalonate pathways the pAH162-λattL-TcR-λattR vector (Minaeva, N. I., et al., BMC Biotechnol., 2008; 8: 63) was used. KpnI-SalI fragment of pMW-Para-mvaES-Ttrp was cloned into SphI-SalI recognition sites of pAH162-λattL-TcR-λattR. As a result, the pAH162-Para-mvaES plasmid carrying mvaES operon from E. faecalis under control of the E. coli Para promoter and repressor gene araC were constructed (FIG. 1). Ecl136II-SalI fragment of the pTrc-KKDyI-ispS(K) plasmid including coding parts of the mevalonate kinase, phosphomevalonate kinase, diphosphomevalonate decarboxylase and IPP isomerase genes from S. cerevisiae and ispS gene from Kudzu was sub-cloned into SphI-SalI sites of pAH162-λattL-TcR-λattR. The resulting plasmid was designated pAH162-KKDyI-ispS(K) (FIG. 2). BglII-EcoRI fragment of the pSTV28-Ptac-ispS-Mmamvk containing the ispS (mucuna) and mvk (M. mazei) genes under control of Ptac has been sub-cloned into BamHI-Ecl136II recognition sites of the integrative vector pAH162-λattL-TcR-λattR. The obtained plasmid pAH162-Ptac-ispS(M)-mvk(Mma) is depicted in FIG. 3. 3.4 Construction of P. Ananatis SC17(0) Derivatives Carrying attB Site of phi80 Phage in Different Points of Genome The derivatives of P. ananatis SC17(0) carrying attB site of phi80 phage substituted for the ampC gene, ampH gene or crt operon have been constructed (annotated complete genome sequence of P. ananatis AJ13355 is available as PRJDA162073 or GeneBank accession numbers AP012032.1 and AP012033.1). To obtain these strains, λRed-dependent integration of the PCR-amplified DNA fragments carrying attLphi80-kan-attRphi80 flanked by 40 by regions homologous to the target sites in genome has been performed according to the previously reported procedure (Katashkina, J. I., et al., BMC Mol Biol., 2009; 10: 34). After electroporation, cells were plated on L-agar containing 50 mg/l kanamycin. DNA fragments used for substitution of ampC, ampH genes and crt operon by attLphi80-kan-attRphi80 were amplified in reactions with oligonucleotides 1 (SEQ ID NO:79) and 2 (SEQ ID NO:80), 3 (SEQ ID NO:81) and 4 (SEQ ID NO:82), and 5 (SEQ ID NO:83) and 6 (SEQ ID NO:84), respectively (Table 3). The pMWattphi plasmid (Minaeva, N. I. et al., BMC Biotechnol., 2008; 8: 63) was used as a template in these reactions. The obtained integrants were named SC17(0)ΔampC::attLphi80-kan-attRphi80, SC17(0)ΔampH::attLphi80-kan-attRphi80 and SC17(0)Δcrt::attLphi80-kan-attRphi80. Oligonucleotides 7 (SEQ ID NO:85) and 8 (SEQ ID NO:86), 9 (SEQ ID NO:87) and 10 (SEQ ID NO:88), and 11 (SEQ ID NO:89) and 12 (SEQ ID NO:90) (Table 3) were used for PCR-verification of the SC17(0)ΔampC::attLphi80-kan-attRphi80, SC17(0)ΔampH::attLphi80-kan-attRphi80 and SC17(0)Δcrt::attLphi80-kan-attRphi80 strains, respectively. Maps of the obtained ΔampC::attLphi80-kan-attRphi80, ΔampH::attLphi80-kan-attRphi80 and Δcrt::attLphi80-kan-attRphi80 genome modifications are depicted in FIG. 4A), FIG. 5A) and FIG. 6B), respectively. Removal of the kanamycin resistance marker from constructed strains was performed according to the procedure and using the pAH129-cat helper plasmid as previously reported (Andreeva, I. G., et al., FEMS Microbiol Lett., 2011; 318(1): 55-60). Oligonucleotides 7 and 8, 9 and 10, and 11 and 12 (Table 3) were used for PCR-verification of the resulting SC17(0)ΔampC::attBphi80, SC17(0)ΔampH::attBphi80, and SC17(0)Δcrt::attBphi80 strains, respectively. 3.5 Construction of the ISP3-S Strain The pAH162-KKDyI-ispS(K) plasmid described in 3-3) was integrated to the SC17(0)ΔampC::attBphi80 strain described in 3-4) according to the procedure and using the helper plasmid pAH123-cat as previously reported (Andreeva, I. G., et al., FEMS Microbiol Lett., 2011; 318(1):55-60). Pairs of oligonucleotides 13 (SEQ ID NO:91) and 7, and 14 (SEQ ID NO:92) and 8 (Table 3) were used for PCR verification of the obtained integrant. The vector part of pAH162-KKDyI-ispS(K) was removed from the resulting strain SC17(0)ΔampC::pAH162-KKDyI-ispS(K) using the pMWintxis-cat helper plasmid carrying int and xis genes of λ phage as previously reported (Katashkina, J. I., et al., BMC Mol Biol., 2009; 10: 34). As a result, the SC17(0)ΔampC::KKDyI-ispS(K) strain was obtained. Oligonucleotides 7 and 15 (SEQ ID NO:93) (Table 3) were used for PCR verification of the tetracycline sensitive derivative. Construction of SC17(0)ΔampC::KKDyI-ispS(K) is illustrated in FIG. 4C. Genomic DNA isolated from the SC17(0)ΔampH::attLphi80-kan-attRphi80 strain described above using GeneElute Bacterial Genomic DNA Kit (Sigma) was electroporated to the SC17(0)ΔampC::KKDyI-ispS(K) strain according to the method of chromosome electroporation as previously reported (Katashkina, J. I., et al., BMC Mol Biol., 2009; 10:3 4). Transfer of the ΔampH::attLphi80-kan-attRphi80 mutation was confirmed in PCR with primers 9 and 10 (Table 3). The kanamycin resistance marker was excised from the obtained strain using the phi80 Int/Xis-dependent procedure (Andreeva, I. G., et al., FEMS Microbiol Lett., 2011; 318(1): 55-60). After PCR verification of the ΔampC::KKDyI-ispS(K) modification in the obtained KmS recombinants using primers 7 and 15 (Table 3), the SC17(0)ΔampC::KKDyI-ispS(K) ΔampH::attBphi80 strain has been selected. The pAH162-Para-mvaES plasmid described above was integrated to SC17(0)ΔampC::KKDyI-ispS(K)ΔampH::attBphi80 using the pAH123-cat helper plasmid (Andreeva, I. G., et al., FEMS Microbiol Lett., 2011; 318(1): 55-60). Pairs of oligonucleotides 13 and 9 and 14 and 10 (Table 3) were used for PCR verification of the obtained integrant. The vector part of pAH162-Para-mvaES was removed from integrants using the phage λ Int/Xis-dependent technique (Katashkina, J. I., et al., BMC Mol Biol., 2009; 10: 34); elimination of vector from chromosome was confirmed in PCR with primers 9 and 94 (SEQ ID NO:79) (Table 3). As a result, the marker-less SC17(0)ΔampC::KKDyI-ispS(K)ΔampH::Para-mvaES strain was obtained. Construction of the ΔampH::Para-mvaES chromosome modification is illustrated in FIG. 5C. The pAH162-Ptac-ispS(M)-mvk(Mma) plasmid described in 3-4) was integrated to genome of SC17(0)Δcrt::attBphi80 using the previously reported protocol (Andreeva, I. G., et al., FEMS Microbiol Lett. 2011; 318(1): 55-60). Plasmid integration was confirmed in polymerase chain reactions with primers 11 and 13, and 12 and 14 (Table 3). The chromosome modification SC17(0)Δcrt::pAH162-Ptac-ispS(M)-mvk(Mma) as constructed above has been transferred to the SC17(0)ΔampC::KKDyI-ispS(K)ΔampH::Para-mvaES strain using the method of electroporation with genomic DNA as previously reported (Katashkina, J. I., et al., BMC Mol Biol., 2009; 10: 34). The vector part of pAH162-Ptac-ispS(M)-mvk(Mma) was excised from the obtained integrant using phage Int/Xis-dependent technique as previously reported (Katashkina, J. I., et al., BMC Mol Biol., 2009; 10: 34). Structure of the final construction Δcrt::Ptac-ispS(M)-mvk(Mma) (FIG. 6D) has been confirmed in PCR with primers 11 and 17 (SEQ ID NO:95) (Table 3). Re-examination of all integrative expression cassettes introduced to this final strain by PCR revealed some unexpected rearrangement at the 5′-portion of the KKDyI operon, containing MVK, PMK, MVD and yldI genes from S. cerevisiae. To restore this cassette, the strain was electroporated with genomic DNA isolated from the SC17(0)ΔampC::pAH162-KKDyI-ispS(K) strain using GeneElute Bacterial Genomic DNA Kit (Sigma) according to the previously reported procedure (Katashkina, J. I., et al., BMC Mol Biol., 2009; 10: 34). The resulting strain contained all genes necessary for isoprene production. After phage X Int/Xis-dependent excision of the vector part of pAH162-KKDyI-ispS(K) (see above), the marker-less ISP3-S strain (P. ananatis SC17(0) ΔampC::attLphi80-KKDyI-ispS(K)-attRphi80 ΔampH::attLphi80-Para-mvaES-attRphi80 Δcrt::attLphi80-Ptac-ispS(M)-mvk(Mma)-attRphi80) was obtained. 3.6 Insertion of tac Promoter Subsequently, tac promoter was introduced into P. ananatis SC17(0) ΔampC::KKDyI-ispS(K) (hereinafter AG9579) by a λ Red method. A method referred to as “Red-driven integration” or “Red-mediated integration” (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA., 97. 6640-6645 (2000)) was used in order to perform promoter substitution in Pantoea ananatis. P. ananatis SC17(0) is known to be used as a recipient strain suitable for Red-dependent integration into a chromosome of Pantoea ananatis (U.S. Pat. No. 7,919,284 B2). The helper plasmid RSF-Red-TER that expressed λ gam, bet and exo genes (hereinafter “λ Red genes”) was used for the Red-dependent integration (U.S. Pat. No. 7,919,284 B2). The RSF-Red-TER plasmid contains a levansucrase gene (sacB) and this gene allows to recover the plasmid from cells in medium containing sucrose. The RSF-Red-TER plasmid was introduced into AG9579 by electroporation according to the standard method. The resulting strain was designated as AG9579/RSF-Red-TER. Genomic DNA was extracted from P. ananatis SC17(0) strain Ptac-lacZ (RU application 2006134574, WO2008/090770, US2010062496) and used as the template in PCR. In P. ananatis SC 17(0) strain Ptac-lacZ, λattL-Kmr-λattR-Ptac where Ptac promoter was linked downstream of λattL-Kmr-λattR is incorporated upstream of a lacZ gene (see WO2011/87139 A1). PCR was carried out using P4071R—6083-54-1 (SEQ ID NO:75) and P4071F(2)—6083-54-3 (SEQ ID NO:76) as the primers and using Prime Star polymerase (supplied from TAKARA BIO Inc.). A reaction solution was prepared according to the composition attached to the kit, and the reaction at 98° C. for 10 seconds, 54° C. for 20 seconds and 68° C. for 120 seconds was carried out in 30 cycles. As a result, a PCR fragment containing a kanamycin resistant gene and the tac promoter was obtained. This PCR fragment was purified and then introduced into AG9579/RSF-Red-TER by electroporation according to the standard method. AG9579/RSF-Red-TER strain in which the PCR fragment had been introduced was selected in an L medium (10 g of bactotrypsin, 5 g of yeast extract, 5 g of NaCl, 15 g of agar are contained in 1 L of pure water, pH 7.0) containing 40 mg/L of kanamycin, and about 20 colonies were obtained as transformants. By PCR using two synthesized DNA primers represented by FCK—6038-52-3 (SEQ ID NO:77) and RCK—6038-52-4 (SEQ ID NO:78), it was confirmed that the sequence derived from the PCR fragment had been inserted upstream of the KKDyI operon. The microbial strain confirmed to have the insertion of the fragment was obtained. Subsequently, the helper plasmid RSF-Red-TER was deleted. This microbial strain was inoculated to the L medium containing 5 g/L of sucrose and 1 mM IPTG to form a single colony. After forming the single colony, this was replicated in both the L medium containing 25 mg/L of chloramphenicol and 40 mg/L of kanamycin and the L medium containing 40 mg/L of kanamycin, and a chloramphenicol sensitive colony was obtained. The microbial strain thus obtained was designated as P. ananatis SC17(0) Ptac-KKDyI-ispS(K)(Kmr). 3.7 Construction of Integrative Plasmids Carrying Different Mevalonate Kinase Genes KpnI-BamHI fragments of pMW-Ptac-Mclmvk-Ttrp, pMW-Ptac-Nmrmvk-Ttrp, and pMW-Ptac-Mmamvk-Ttrp plasmids (see Example 3-1) have been sub-cloned into KpnI-Ecl136II recognition sites of the pAH162-λattL-TcR-λattR integrative vector. BglII-BamHI fragment of pMW-Ptac-Cvamvk-Ttrp (see Example 3-1) was sub-cloned into BamHI-Ecl136II recognition sites of the pAH162-λattL-TcR-λattR integrative vector. A DNA fragment containing Ptac promoter was amplified in PCR with primers 18 (SEQ ID NO:96) and 19 (SEQ ID NO:97) (Table 3) and cloned into the HindIII-SphI recognition sites of the pAH162-λattL-TcR-λattR integrative vector. The cloned promoter fragment was sequenced. Map of the resulting integrative expression vector pAH162-Ptac is represented in FIG. 7. A chemically synthesized DNA fragment containing putative mvk gene from Methanocella paludicola strain SANAE (see GeneBank accession number AP011532 for complete genome sequence) linked to canonical SD sequence was cloned into PstI-KpnI recognition sites of pAH162-Ptac. Maps of the integrative plasmids carrying different mvk genes are depicted in FIG. 8. 3.8 Construction of ISP3-mvk(Mpd) Strain The pAH162-Ptac-mvk(M. paludicola) plasmid obtained as above was integrated into genome of SC17(0)Δcrt::attBphi80 using pAH123-cat helper plasmid (see above). The constructed Δcrt::pAH123-Ptac-mvk(M. paludicola) chromosome modification was transferred to the ISP3-S strain (see above) via electroporation of genomic DNA isolated from SC17(0)Δcrt::pAH162-Ptac-mvk(M. paludicola). The resulting integrant was named ISP3-mvk(Mpd). 3.9 Construction of ISP2 Strain The pAH162-Ptac-mvk(M. paludicola) integrative plasmid was removed from ISP3-mvk(Mpd) using pAH129-cat helper plasmid (see above). Presence of P. ananatis SC17(0)ΔampC::KKDyI-ispS(K) modification in the selected TcS clones was confirmed in PCRs with primers 7 and 13, and 8 and 14 (Table 3), ΔampH::attLphi80-Para-mvaES-attRphi80 modification was confirmed by PCRs with primers 9 and 13, and 10 and 14 (Table 3). As a result, the ISP2 strain (P. ananatis SC17(0) ΔampC::attLphi80-KKDyI-ispS(K)-attRphi80 ΔampH::attLphi80-Para-mvaES-attRphi80 Δcrt::attBphi80) was selected. 3.10 Construction of Set of ISP2 Derivatives Carrying Different mvk Genes The pAH162-Ptac-mvk(M. mazei), pAH162-Ptac-mvk(C. variabile), pAH162-Ptac-mvk(N. maritimus) and pAH162-Ptac-mvk(M. concilii) (see above) were integrated to the ISP2 strain using pAH123-cat helper plasmid as previously reported (Andreeva, I. G., et al., FEMS Microbiol Lett., 2011; 318(1): 55-60). As a result, a set of strains named ISP3-mvk(Mma), ISP3-mvk(Cva), ISP3-mvk(Nmr) and ISP3-mvk(Mcl), respectively, was obtained. FIG. 9 illustrates structures of the Δcrt::pAH162-Ptac-mvk(X) where mvk(X) is any of the mvk genes listed above. 3.11 Construction of ISP3.2-mvk(Mpd) Strain Genomic DNA isolated from P. ananatis SC17(0) ΔampC::Ptac-KKDyI-ispS(K)(Kmr) strain was electroporated to the ISP3-mvk(Mpd) strain. As a result, the ISP3.2-mvk(Mpd)-KmR strain (P. ananatis SC17(0) ΔampC::λattL-kan-λattR-Ptac-KKDyI-ispS(K) ΔampH::attLphi80-Para-mvaES-attRphi80 Δcrt::pAH162-Ptac-mvk(M. paludicola)) was obtained. Kanamycin resistance gene was removed from the strain using λInt/Xis-dependent procedure (Katashkina, J. I., et al., BMC Mol Biol., 2009; 10: 34). As a result, the ISP3.2-mvk(Mpd) strain was obtained. 3.12 Construction of ISP2.2 Strain The pAH162-Ptac-mvk(M. paludicola) plasmid was removed from the ISP3.2-mvk(Mpd) strain using pAH129 helper plasmid (Andreeva, I. G., et al., FEMS Microbiol Lett., 2011; 318(1): 55-60). Presence of ΔampC::Ptac-KKDyI-ispS(K) modification in the selected TcS clones was confirmed in PCRs with primers 7 and 13, and 8 and 14 (Table 3), ΔampH::attLphi80-Para-mvaES-attRphi80 modification was confirmed by PCRs with primers 9 and 13, and 10 and 14 (Table 3). As a result, the ISP2.2 strain (P. ananatis SC17(0) ΔampC::Ptac-KKDyI-ispS(K) ΔampH::attLphi80-Para-mvaES-attRphi80 Δcrt::attBphi80) was selected. 3.13 Construction of Set of ISP2.2 Derivatives Carrying Different mvk Genes The pAH162-Ptac-mvk(M. mazei) and pAH162-Ptac-mvk(M. concilii) (see above) were integrated to the ISP2.2 strain using pAH123-cat helper plasmid as previously reported (Andreeva, I. G., et al., FEMS Microbiol Lett., 2011; 318(1): 55-60). As a result, strains named ISP3.2-mvk(Mma) and ISP3.2-mvk(Mcl), respectively, were obtained.

Ananatis Isoprene-Producing Strain A fermentation jar having a 1 L volume was used for the culture of the P. ananatis isoprene-producing strain. A glucose medium was prepared in a composition shown in Table 5. The novel MVK-introduced strain was applied onto an LB plate containing 60 mg/L of chrolamphenicol, and cultured at 34° C. for 16 hours. 0.3 L of the glucose medium was added to the fermentation jar having the 1 L volume, and microbial cells sufficiently grown on one plate were inoculated thereto, and the culture was started. The culture was carried out under a condition at pH 7.0 (controlled by ammonia gas) at 30° C. with ventilation at 150 mL/minute or 300 mL/minute. A stirring control was carried out so that a concentration of oxygen in the medium was 5% or more. During the culture, a solution of glucose adjusted at 500 g/L was continuously added so that a concentration of glucose was 10 g/L or more. In the case of cultivating ISP3-mvk(X) (where mvk(X) is any of the microbial species from which MVK was derived and listed in Table 4), ISP3-mvk (Mpd), ISP3-mvk (Mma), ISP3-mvk (Cva), ISP3-mvk (Mcl) and ISP3-mvk (Nmr) finally consumed 64.1 g, 71.7 g, 79.1 g, 64.3 g and 71.3 g of glucose, respectively, in the culture for 70 hours. Also, in the case of cultivating ISP3.2-mvk(X) (where mvk(X) is any of the microbial species from which MVK was derived and listed in Table 4), ISP3.2-mvk (Mma), ISP3.2-mvk (Mpd) and ISP3.2-mvk (Mcl) finally consumed 64.3 g, 60.1 g and 67.2 g of glucose, respectively, in the culture for 48 hours. TABLE 5 Composition of glucose medium Final concentration Group A Glucose 80 g/L MgSO4•7H2O 2.0 g/L Group B (NH4)2SO4 2.0 g/L KH2PO4 2.0 g/L FeSO4•7H2O 20 mg/L MnSO4•5H2O 20 mg/L Yeast Extract 4.0 g/L 0.15 L each of Group A and Group B was prepared, and then sterilized with heat at 115° C. for 10 minutes. After cooling, Group A and Group B were mixed, and chloramphenicol (60 mg/L) was added, and used as the medium. 3.14.3 Method for Inducing Isoprene Production Phase In P. ananatis isoprene-producing strain, genes upstream of the mevalonic acid pathway are expressed by an arabinose inducible promoter, and thus an amount of isoprene produced in the presence of L-arabinose (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.) is notably enhanced. To induce to an isoprene production phase, a broth in the fermentation jar was analyzed with time, and L-arabinose was added so that its final concentration was 20 mM at a time point when an absorbance at 600 nm was 16. 3.14.4 Method for Measuring Concentration of Isoprene in Fermentation Gas After the addition of L-arabinose, fermentation gas was collected in a gas bag on a timely basis, and the concentration of isoprene gas was quantified by gas chromatography (GC-2010 Plus AF supplied from Shimadzu Corporation) or multi gas analyzer (F10 supplied from GASERA Ltd.). 3.15 Amount of Isoprene Produced in Jar Culture of MVK Introduced Strain (Evaluation 1) Novel MVK introduced strains, ISP3-mvk (Mma), ISP3-mvk (Mpd), ISP3-mvk (Mcl), ISP3-mvk (Cva) and ISP3-mvk (Nmr) were cultured under the above jar culture condition, and amounts of produced isoprene were measured. The amount of total isoprene produced until 70 hours after starting the culture was measured as shown in FIGS. 10 and 11. The strains arranged in descending order of total produced isoprene amount were as follows: ISP3-mvk (Mcl), ISP3-mvk (Nmr), ISP3-mvk (Cva), ISP3-mvk (Mma) and ISP3-mvk (Mpd) (FIGS. 10 and 11). The each total amounts of isoprene produced in ISP3-mvk (Mcl), ISP3-mvk (Nmr), ISP3-mvk (Cva), ISP3-mvk (Mma) and ISP3-mvk (Mpd) were 903 mg, 707 mg, 606 mg, 603 mg and 486 mg, respectively. This indicates that P. ananatis isoprene-producing strain in which MVK derived from M. concilii, N. maritimus, or C. variabile was introduced has more excellent ability to produce isoprene than P. ananatis isoprene-producing strain in which known MVK derived from M. mazei was introduced. 3.16 Amount of Isoprene Produced in Jar Culture of MVK Introduced Strain (Evaluation 2) Novel MVK-introduced strains, ISP3.2-mvk (Mma), ISP3.2-mvk (Mpd), and ISP3.2-mvk (Mcl) were cultured under the above jar culture condition, and amounts of produced isoprene were measured. As shown in FIGS. 12 and 13, total amounts of isoprene produced for 48 hours after starting the cultivation were measured. The strains arranged in descending order of the total amount of the isoprene produced were as follows: ISP3.2-mvk (Mpd), ISP3.2-mvk (Mcl) and ISP3.2-mvk (Mma) (FIGS. 12 and 13). The total amounts of the isoprene produced in ISP3.2-mvk (Mpd), ISP3.2-mvk (Mcl) and ISP3.2-mvk (Mma) was 307 mg, 301 mg and 275 mg, respectively. This indicates that P. ananatis isoprene-producing strain in which MVK derived from M. paludicola or M. concilii was introduced has more excellent ability to produce isoprene than P. ananatis isoprene-producing strain in which known MVK derived from M. mazei was introduced. Example 4 Purification and Activity Assay of Mevalonate Kinase 4.1 Cloning of Mevalonate Kinase Genes Each mevalonate kinase gene was cloned in pET-21a(+) (for C-terminal His-Tag: Novagen) and pET-28b(+) (for N-terminal His-Tag: Novagen). Using the plasmids shown in Table 6 as template, PCR was performed with oligonucleotides shown in Table 7. Since mpd-mvk includes NdeI site in ORF, silent mutation was introduced in NdeI site by overlap PCR. KOD plus DNA polymerase (TOYOBO) was used for PCR. Obtained DNA fragments were digested with NdeI and HindIII and inserted in the corresponding sites of pET-21a(+) and pET-28b(+). Inserted DNA sequences were confirmed by DNA sequencing. An ERG12 gene (sce-mvk in Table 6) encoding the mevalonate kinase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae was amplified by PCR performed with Prime Star polymerase (supplied from Takara Bio Inc.) using synthetic oligonucleotides consisting of the nucleotide sequences of SMVKf (SEQ ID NO:100) and SMVKr (SEQ ID NO:101) as the primers with genomic DNA from Saccharomyces cerevisiae as the template. A reaction solution was prepared according to the composition attached to the kit, and the reaction at 98° C. for 10 seconds, 55° C. for 5 seconds and 72° C. for one minute per kb was performed in 30 cycles. As a result, PCR products containing an ERG12 gene was obtained. Likewise, pMW219-Ptac-Ttrp was amplified by PCR performed with Prime Star polymerase (supplied from Takara Bio Inc.) using synthetic oligonucleotides consisting of the nucleotide sequences of PtTt219f (SEQ ID NO:65) and PtTt219r (SEQ ID NO:66) as the primers. As a result, a PCR product containing pMW219-Ptac-Ttrp was obtained. Subsequently, the purified PCR product of ERG12 gene was ligated to the PCR product of pMW219-Ptac-Ttrp using In-Fusion HD Cloning Kit (supplied from Clontech). The resulting expression plasmids for ERG12 gene was designated as pMW-Ptac-Scemvk-Ttrp.

The mixed solution was then incubated at 37° C. for 2 hours. After incubation, pH of the solution was adjusted to 8.0 by neutralization with hydrochloric acid. Then, the solution was topped up to a final volume of 20 ml, and designated as 100 mM potassium mevalonate solution. Obtained potassium mevalonate solution was subdivided into about 2 ml each, and then stored at −20° C. The obtained 100 mM potassium mevalonate solution was verified by HPLC. Analysis was performed by using 50 mM (R)-lithium mevalonate (authentic preparation, SIGMA) as the standard and the prepared potassium mevalonate (diluted to 50 mM with water) as a sample. HPLC used for the verification was HITACH High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (L-2000). HPLC was performed by using YMC-Pack ODS-A (150×4.6 mm I.D.: YMC CO., LTD.) as stationary phase and phosphoric acid (pH2.5) as mobile phase. Detection was performed at 210 nm. In HPLC chromatograms of 50 mM solutions of mevalonolactone, lithium mevalonate standard and potassium mevalonate obtained from alkaline hydrolysis, it was confirmed that the peak at 11.2 min found in authentic mevalonolactone preparation almost disappeared and the peak at 8.8 min found in the authentic mevalonate preparation was the chief component of the prepared mevalonate (data not shown). After frozen storage, the prepared mevalonate was again analyzed by HPLC for stability verification. Peak area of lithium mevalonate standard is almost comparable to that of prepared potassium mevalonate (data not shown), showing that the prepared mevalonate was stable even after frozen storage. 4.3 Expression Analysis and Activity Confirmation Each obtained plasmid was used for transformation of E. coli BL21(DE3). For the analysis of the expression of mevalonate kinases cloned in pET-21a(+) and pET-28b(+), each transfectant was cultured at 20° C. by reciprocal shaking at 140 rpm (TITEC reciprocal shaker) in LB medium in LB medium (tryptone 10 g/L, yeast extract 5 g/L, NaCl 5 g/L) containing 0.1 mg/ml ampicillin (for pET-21a(+)) or 0.05 mg/ml kanamycin (for pET-28b(+)). When OD600 reached approximately 0.5, IPTG was added to the solution to final concentration of 1 mM. It was then cultured overnight at 20° C. Harvested cells were suspended in the buffer solution consisting of 50 mM sodium phosphate, 0.3 M NaCl and 20 mM Imidazol. Then the cells were disrupted with an ultrasonic disruptor (TOMY: UD-201, output level=3.5). After centrifugation (20,000×g, 20 min), disrupted cells were adsorbed to His-spinTrap (GE Healthcare). After washing with the same buffer solution, protein was eluted with the buffer solution consisting of 50 mM sodium phosphate, 0.3 M NaCl and 0.5 M imidazole (pH7.5). Eluate was dialyzed overnight at 4° C. with the external solution composed of 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH7.5) and 50 mM NaCl. Then, enzyme activity of each eluate in the internal dialysis solution was measured. Activity of the internal dialysate (about 0.2 ml each) was measured with the 10 μl of enzyme solution (Table 8). Enzyme expression level was compared on activity basis between pET-21a(+) and pET-28b(+). Enzyme expressed in pET-28b(+) showed higher activity. It is inferred that expression level is higher in pET-28b(+). Therefore, purified enzyme expressed in pET-28b(+) was used in the further examinations. TABLE 8 Comparison of the enzyme activity in the cell extract expressed in pET systems pET28 system pET21 system (N terminal Tag) (C terminal Tag) cva-mvk 0.211 0.019 mcl-mvk 0.023 0.003 mma-mvk 0.231 0.225 mpd-mvk 0.031 0.011 nmr-mvk 0.247 0.137 sce-mvk 0.127 0.001 Values were presented by decrease in absorbance per unit time per 10 μl in the enzyme reaction measurement system (dABS/min/10 μl). 4.4 Expression and Purification of Mevalonate Kinase Each obtained plasmid was used for transformation of E. coli BL21(DE3). For the analysis of the expression of mevalonate kinase derived from cva, mma, nmr and sce, each transfectant was cultured at 20° C. in 20 ml of LB medium in a thick test tube (3 cm I.D.×20 cm) by reciprocal shaking at 140 rpm (TAITEC reciprocal shaker). For the analysis of the expression of mevalonate kinase derived from mcl and mpd, each transfectant was cultured at 20° C. in 2 L LB medium in 3 L shaking flask with baffles by gyratory culture at 140 rpm (INOVA44, 2-inch stroke, Newbrunswick sceientific). When OD600 reached approximately 0.5, 0.1 mM IPTG (for cva, mma, nmr, and sce) or 1 mM (for mcl and mpd) of IPTG was added, and then the mixture was kept at 20° C. overnight to induce the target protein. Harvested cells were suspended in buffer solution A (50 mM sodium phosphate, 0.3 M NaCl and 20 mM Imidazol), and then the cells were disrupted with an ultrasonic disruptor (TOMY: UD-201). Ultrasonic disruption of the transfectant expressing mevalonate kinase derived from cva, mma, nmr or sce was performed at output level=3.5, while that of the transfectant expressing mevalonate kinase derived from mcl or mpd at output level=8. After centrifugation (28,000×g, 30 min), the supernatant was adsorbed onto His-Trap HP (GE Healthcare) to elute the target protein by linear concentration gradient of Imidazol (final concentration 0.5 M). Obtained protein was dialyzed by using an external solution composed of 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 1 mM DTT and 50 mM NaCl. Dialyzed protein was designated as purified enzyme. Protein quantity was measured with Bio-RAD protein assay kit and BSA standard condition. As a result, weights of purified cva, mma, nmr and sce-derived enzymes obtained from 20 ml of the culture solutions were 4, 1, 1.8 and 0.2 mg, respectively. Weights of purified mcl and mpd-derived enzymes obtained from 2 L of the culture solutions were 45 and 2 mg, respectively. FIG. 14 shows SDS-PAGE profile of the purified enzymes. 4.5 Measurement of Activity and Km Value of Mevalonate Kinase For measuring enzyme activity, enzyme was added to the reaction solution containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH7.6) (WAKO), 0.4 mM phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) (SIGMA), 0.33 mM NADH (ORIENTAL YEAT CO., LTD.), 10 mM MgCl2, 0.05 mM DTT, 50 mM NaCl, Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) (20 U/ml) (SIGMA), Pyruvate Kinase (PK) (20 U/ml) (SIGMA), 5 mM potassium mevalonate and 5 mM ATP (ORIENTAL YEAT CO., LTD.). Decrease in absorbance at 340 nm at 30° C. was measured to determine the enzyme activity. JASCO Corporation's spectrophotometer (V-650) was used in this study. Millimolar extinction coefficient of NADH used in this study was 6.22 mM−1 cm−1. Km value (for mevalonate) was measured as follows: ATP concentration in the aforementioned reaction mixture was set at 5 mM, and 3 concentration levels of potassium mevalonate were set in 0.002 mM to 1 mM range. Km value (for ATP) was measured as follows: Potassium mevalonate concentration in the aforementioned reaction mixture was set at 5 mM, and 3 to 4 ATP concentration levels were set in the 0.2 mM to 5 mM range. Km value was calculated by Lineweaver-Burk plot. Measured activity of each enzyme (JABS/min) was presented on Table 9 for the calculation of apparent Km value (Km app.) of each enzyme. Table 10 presents Km app., Vmax, molecular weight of the enzyme protein, protein concentration in the enzyme solution and calculated kcat.

Since GPP and FPP solutions contain methanol, methanol which was needed to keep the same methanol level at the addition to the reaction system was added to the reaction solution, which was designated as control. Respective effect of the added 5 mM DMAPP, 0.1 mM GPP, and 0.1 mM FPP on the activity of each enzyme was measured. Table 11 presents the activity of each enzyme (dABS/min) and FIG. 15 shows activity relative to the control. Every one of the three terpenyl diphosphates strongly inhibited sce-derived enzyme. Though FPP inhibited cva-derived enzyme, no other enzymes were inhibited strongly by FPP. Contrarily, mcl-derived enzyme was activated by 5 mM DMAPP and its activity increased by 20% from that of the control.

IPP was added to the reaction solution (50 mM Tris-HCl, 0.4 mM PEP, 0.33 mM NADH, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.05 mM DTT, 50 mM NaCl, LDH (20 U/ml), PK (20 U/ml)) to final concentrations of 33.6 μM and 168 μM to measure mevalonate kinase activity. Since IPP solution contained 70% methanol solution, the same quantity of 70% methanol solution was added to the reaction system as a control. Since 5 mM DMAPP was confirmed to increase activity, its effect on mcl-derived mevalonate kinase activity at 33.6 μM and 168 μM was examined. Effect of IPP on mcl-derived enzyme which activity was confirmed to increase by DMAPP addition was examined (Table 13). FIG. 17 presents the relative activity when the control was designated as 100. Relative activities when the same concentrations of DMAPP and high-concentration (5 mM) DMAPP were separately added were measured simultaneously. Neither IPP nor DMAPP affected the enzyme activity at 33.6 μM and 168 μM. Addition of 5 mM DMAPP increased relative activity by 20%.

A reaction solution was prepared according to the composition attached to the kit, and the reaction at 98° C. for 10 seconds, 55° C. for 5 seconds and 72° C. for 5 seconds per kb was performed in 30 cycles. As a result, PCR products containing an ERG8 gene was obtained. A plasmid pSTV28-Ptac-Ttrp was digested with SmaI according to a standard method. Then, pSTV28-Ptac-Ttrp after being digested with SmaI was ligated to the PCR product containing an ERG8 gene by In-Fusion HD Cloning Kit (Supplied from Clontech). The obtained plasmid was designated as pSTV-Ptac-PMK-Ttrp. PMK-IFS—5742-33-3 (SEQ ID NO:122)5′-ACACAAGGAGACTCCCATGTCAGAGTTGAGAGCCTTCA-3′PMK-IFA—5742-33-4 (SEQ ID NO:123)5′-GGAACTGGCGGCTCCCGGGTTATTATTTATCAAGATAAGTTTCCGG-3′ PMK-coding DNA was prepared by PCR using PMK-coding plasmid pSTV-Ptac-PMK-Ttrp as a template and oligonucleotide (5′-TCAGAGTTGAGAGCCTTCAGTGCCCCAG-3′ (SEQ ID NO:124) and 5′-GGAATTCTCTTTATCAAGATAAGTTTCCGGATCTTTTT-3′ (SEQ ID NO:125)) as primers. Obtained DNA fragments were digested by EcoRI and cloned in pET21d. After NcoI digestion, pET21d underwent smoothing and then further digested with EcoRI to use for cloning. Inserted DNA sequence was confirmed by DNA sequencing. E. coli BL21(DE3) was transformed with the obtained plasmid and cultured in 20 ml of LB medium at 30° C. by reciprocal shaking (140 rpm, TAITEC reciprocal shaker). When OD600=approx. 0.7, IPTG was added so that the final concentration is 0.1 mM. Then the mixture was cultured overnight under the same condition. Harvested cells were suspended in buffer solution A (50 mM sodium phosphate, 0.3 M NaCl, 20 mM Imidazol) and disrupted with an ultrasonic disruptor (TOMY: UD-201). Ultrasonic disruption was accomplished at output level=3.5. After centrifugation, resultant supernatant was adsorbed onto His-spin Trap (GE Healthcare) and the adsorbed proteins were eluted with an eluting solution, buffer solution A with imidazole concentration of 0.5 M. Eluate was dialyzed by using 20 mM Tris-HCl(pH8.0) containing 50 mM NaCl as external solution and then designated as purified enzyme. Examination of Product Inhibition on Mevalonate Kinase Enzyme was added to the reaction solution (100 mM Tris-HCl (pH7.6), 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 10 mM MgCl2, 50 mM ATP, 2.5 mM NADH, 40 mM PEP, LDH (20 U/ml), PK (20 U/ml), 1 mM mevalonate), and decrease in absorbance at 386 nm was measured. When decrease in absorbance stopped, purified PMK was added to measure further decrease in absorbance at 386 nm. FIG. 18 presents the SDS-PAGE profile of the purified PMK. In order to examine possible product inhibition on each enzyme, decrease in absorbance at 386 nm resulting from the enzyme reaction using 1 mM mevalonate as a substrate was measured (FIG. 19). When 0.61 mM−1 cm−1 was designated as millimolar absorption coefficient of NADH at 386 nm, decrease in absorbance comparable to the substrate concentration (1 mM) (1.5-0.9=0.6) was observed in all enzymes. PMK was further added when mevalonate was depleted (or when absorbance stopped decreasing). Then, absorbance decreased further and finally absorbance at 386 nm decreased to 0.3 in all reaction systems. Therefore, it is inferred that mevalonate is converted into diphosphomevalonate via phosphomevalonate by adding PMK to each MVK. In the reactions of cva-, sce-, mcl-, mma- and mpd-derived MVK, almost linear decrease in absorbance was observed until PMK addition. Meanwhile, nmr-derived enzyme showed decrease in the rate of reaction associated with the progression of reaction (accumulation of the product). It suggests that DPM-induced inhibition is not observed in nmr-derived enzyme, but phosphomevalonate may cause product inhibition on nmr-derived enzyme. Example 5 Production of Polyisoprene Isoprene is collected with a trap cooled with liquid nitrogen by passing the fermentation exhaust. Collected of isoprene is mixed with 35 g of hexane (Sigma-Aldrich, catalog No. 296090) and 10 g of silica gel (Sigma-Aldrich, catalog No. 236772) and 10 g of alumina (Sigma-Aldrich, catalog No. 267740) under a nitrogen atmosphere in 100 mL glass vessel that is sufficiently dried. Resulting mixture is left at room temperature for 5 hours. Then supernatant liquid is skimmed and is added into 50 ml glass vessel that is sufficiently dried. Meanwhile, in a glove box under a nitrogen atmosphere, 40.0 μmol of Tris[bis(trimethylsilyl)amido]gadolinium, 150.0 μmol of tributylaluminium, 40.0 μmol of Bis[2-(diphenylphosphino)phenyl]amine, 40.0 μmol of triphenylcarbonium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate ((Ph3CBC6F5)4) are provided in a glass container, which was dissolved into 5 mL of toluene (Sigma-Aldrich, catalog No. 245511), to thereby obtain a catalyst solution. After that, the catalyst solution is taken out from the glove box and added to the monomer solution, which is then subjected to polymerization at 50° C. for 120 minutes. After the polymerization, 1 mL of an isopropanol solution containing, by 5 mass %, 2,2′-methylene-bis(4-ethyl-6-t-butylphenol) (NS-5), is added to stop the reaction. Then, a large amount of methanol is further added to isolate the polymer, and the polymer is vacuum dried at 70° C. to obtain a polymer.
