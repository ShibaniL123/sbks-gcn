Example 1 Synthesis of 3, 7-dihydroxy-6-ethyl-7-d-5-cholan-24-oic acid (compound 1)
1. Synthesis of 3-tetrahydropyranyloxy-7-keto-5-cholan-24-oic acid (compound 3)
3-hydroxy-7-keto-5-cholan-24-oic acid (10.0 g, 25.6 mmol) was dissolved in dioxane (150 ml) in a flask. p-Toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate (0.49 g, 2.56 mmol) and 3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran (4.31 g, 51.2 mmol) were added in turn. After stirring at room temperature for 1h, ammonia solution in methanol was dropwisely added to adjust pH to 8-9. After the volatiles were removed by evaporation, the residue was extracted with EtOAc. The organic phase was washed subsequently with sat. sodium bicarbonate, water and saturated brine, and dried with Na2SO4. After filtration, the filtrate was condensed with the rotary evaporator. The resulting crude product was purified by silica gel column chromatograph (EtOAc/petroleum = 1/3) to get the off-white solid target compound (9.72g, 80%).
