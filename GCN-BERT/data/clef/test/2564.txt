TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a polycarbonate resin composition and a molded article formed from the same. More particularly, the present invention relates to a polycarbonate resin composition having excellent properties in terms of scratch resistance, impact resistance, and heat resistance and a molded article formed from the same. BACKGROUND ART Recently, as an exterior material for electric/electronic products, office products, and the like, thermoplastic resins having lower specific gravity than glass or metal and excellent formability are widely used. Thus, in the field of thermoplastic resins, functions and appearances as exterior materials are growing in importance, and importance of impact resistance and scratch resistance is strengthened, which represent characteristics capable of withstanding external shock or scratch. Moreover, with the development of high-grade electric/electronic products, aesthetics of the products is increasingly important, which leads to increased interest in transparent thermoplastic resins having excellent scratch resistance. Polycarbonate resins are a representative thermoplastic resin that have a heat deflection temperature of 135° C. or higher, and exhibit excellent properties in terms of transparency, impact resistance, self-extinguishing properties, dimensional stability and heat resistance, and are widely used in various applications, such as exterior materials of electronic and electric products, office equipment, automobile components, and the like. However, polycarbonate resins and resin compositions have a limitation in use as exterior materials or optical films for laptops, mobile phones, and the like due to poor scratch resistance. A polycarbonate film can be coated with a scratch-resistant film in order to improve scratch resistance of polycarbonate resins. In this case, an expensive scratch-resistant film and an additional coating process can cause an increase in manufacturing costs. Therefore, besides such a film coating technique, various studies on various methods have been made to improve scratch resistance of polycarbonate resins and resin compositions. Thereamong, blending polycarbonate resins with a scratch-resistant resin such as acrylic resins is most commonly used. However, when polycarbonate resins are blended with acrylic resins to improve scratch resistance, impact resistance and heat resistance of the polycarbonate resins can be drastically reduced, and compatibility between the blended resins can considerably increase haze, thereby damaging transparency, which is one of the advantages of the polycarbonate resins. Therefore, there is a need for a polycarbonate resin composition having excellent scratch resistance without deterioration in inherent physical properties, such as impact resistance, heat resistance, and transparency.

Within this range, the polycarbonate resin composition can exhibit sufficient reactivity while minimizing production of byproducts by side reaction, thereby improving thermal stability and color stability. (A2) Aromatic Polycarbonate Resin As the aromatic polycarbonate resin, any typical aromatic polycarbonate resin used in thermoplastic resin compositions may be used without limitation. For example, the aromatic polycarbonate resin may be an aromatic polycarbonate resin prepared by condensation or transesterification of a carbonate precursor such as phosgene and diaryl carbonate with a dihydric phenol compound in the presence of a molecular weight regulator and a catalyst according to a typical method of preparing an aromatic polycarbonate resin. In this method of preparing an aromatic polycarbonate resin, as the dihydric phenol compound, a bisphenol compound, preferably 2,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)propane (“bisphenol A”) may be used.

The additives may be present in amount of about 0.001 parts by weight to about 30 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the polycarbonate component, without being limited thereto. The polycarbonate resin composition according to the present invention exhibits better scratch resistance, impact resistance, heat resistance, and balance therebetween than a polycarbonate resin composition which includes an acrylic resin component rather than the polycarbonate component, and has a scratch width of about 312 μm or less, preferably about 200 μm to about 312 as measured by a ball-type scratch profile (BSP) test; a pencil hardness of HB or higher, preferably F to 3H, under a load of 500 g in accordance with ASTM D3362; and an Izod impact strength of about 12 kgf·cm/cm to about 90 kgf·cm/cm, preferably about 12 kgf·cm/cm to about 60 kgf·cm/cm, as measured on an about 1/8″ thick specimen in accordance with ASTM D256.
