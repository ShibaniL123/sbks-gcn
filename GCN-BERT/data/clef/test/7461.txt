BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates generally to exercise equipment and, more specifically, to a foldable exercise apparatus comprising a frame having a rigid frame back wall with hinged rigid frame side walls with one of said side walls having a hinged cross brace, which serves as structural support and exercise equipment, such as chin ups and pull ups, that is fastenable to the opposing side wall. Also provided is a foldable bench attachable to the exercise apparatus in its folded state. Further provided are wheels mounted to a respective side wall front end to aid in deploying and folding the side walls. Additionally provided are a plurality of exercise equipment receptacles supporting the storage of exercise equipment components until needed. 2. Description of the Prior Art There are other exercise machines which provide for compact storage. While these exercise machines may be suitable for the purposes for which they where designed, they would not be as suitable for the purposes of the present invention as heretofore described. It is thus desirable to provide an exercise apparatus having a rigid frame back wall with hinged rigid frame side walls that are pivotal from a folded state to a deployed state incorporating a pivotal overhead brace and side-wall base mounted wheels. It is further desirable to provide a foldable bench that is attachable to the exercise apparatus in its folded state. SUMMARY OF THE PRESENT INVENTION A primary object of the present invention is to provide an exercise apparatus that is foldable when not in use. Another object of the present invention is to provide an exercise apparatus having a tubular frame back wall and hinged tubular frame sidewalls. Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a back wall having transverse feet on the bottom corners and transverse beams extending from the top corners having side walls pivotally attached thereto. Still yet another object of the present invention is to provide said back wall with top and bottom end transverse beams fixedly attached a stanchion having a slide able collar and bar for selectively attaching weights to said bar. An additional object of the present invention is to provide a cable attached to the stanchion's slide able weight bar then threaded over front and back side pulleys terminating in an overhead handle bar for moving the slide able weight bar along said stanchion. A further object of the present invention is to provide an apparatus wherein said tubular frame sidewall hinge is a pair of pivot pins extending between said side walls and the back wall's feet and beams. A yet further object of the present invention is to provide an apparatus where a respective sidewall pivot pins are spaced from the back wall so that one sidewall folds substantially flat against the back wall while the other folds substantially against the folded side wall. A still yet further object of the present invention is to provide an exercise apparatus having a sidewall-hinged overhead support having a distal end receptacle so that when pivoted to its open state the receptacle is placed over the opposing sidewall frame securing the exercise apparatus in an open state. Another object of the present invention is to provide a tubular frame back wall and side walls having a plurality of receptacle for storing exercise equipment components until needed. Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a plurality of releasable tensioned fasteners for securing the exercise apparatus in a desired open or closed state. Still yet another object of the present invention is to provide a tensioned safety fastener having a handle and post forming an integral part of the back wall top end transverse beams. An additional object of the present invention is to provide an aperture within each sidewall so that the safety fastener post member is seatable within a respective sidewall aperture securing the sidewall in an open position. Another object of the present invention is to provide a releasable tensioned fastener forming an integral part of a sidewall with the fastener post portion seatable in an aperture within the overhead support for securing the overhead support in a locked state. Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a free standing bench having an adjustable seat portion and back portion fixed to a rigid frame. Still yet another object of the present invention is to provide a free standing bench with a rigid frame having a footer with a pair of apertures so that the bench can be fastened to the exercise apparatus overhead hangers when in a closed state. Additional objects of the present invention will appear as the description proceeds. The present invention overcomes the shortcomings of the prior art by providing a foldable exercise apparatus having a rigid frame back wall with hinged rigid frame side walls with one of said side walls having a hinged cross brace that is fastenable to the opposing side wall. Also provided is a collapse able bench attachable to the exercise apparatus in its folded state. Further provided are wheels mounted to a respective side wall front end to aid in deploying and folding the side walls. The exercise apparatus rigid frame provides a plurality of exercise equipment receptacles supporting the storage of exercise equipment components until needed.

Referring to FIG. 2, shown is an illustrative perspective view of the exercise apparatus of the present invention. The present invention is a foldable exercise apparatus 10 comprising a rigid frame back wall 28 with hinged rigid frame side walls 16, 18 with the first side wall 16 having a hinged cross brace 12, which serves as a structural support and exercise component that is fastenable to the second side wall 18. Also provided is a collapsible bench 20 attachable to the exercise apparatus 10 in its folded state that when detached from the exercise apparatus 10 can be selectively positioned as needed to perform a plethora of exercises provided by the foldable exercise apparatus 10. Referring to FIG. 3, shown is an illustrative perspective view of the exercise apparatus of the present invention. The foldable exercise apparatus 10 of the present invention provides a rigid frame back wall 28 having opposing side footers 30 incorporating a pivot pin 32 and back wall transverse beams 34 incorporating a pivot pin 32 having respective side walls 16, 18 supported by a respective pair of upper and lower pivot pins 32. Also provided is a hinged cross brace 12 fastened to the top of the first side wall 16 with a free end 36 having a receptacle 38 for engaging the second side wall 18 and a quick release safety lock 14 for then locking the cross brace 12 to the second side wall 18. The fastened hinged cross brace 12 locks the positioning of the side walls 16, 18 and also serves as an exercise component for chin-ups and pull-ups. Referring to FIG. 4, shown is an illustrative perspective view of the folding procedure for the foldable exercise apparatus. To fold the exercise apparatus 10 for storage, the quick release safety lock 14 holding the hinged cross brace 12 is retracted to its stop position releasing the second side wall 18 which also has a quick release safety lock 14 that is disengaged allowing the second side wall 18 to be pivoted out of the way while the hinged cross brace 12 is moved to its stored position, where then the second side wall 18 is pivoted to its storage position against the back wall 28. Referring to FIG. 5, shown is an illustrative perspective view of the folding procedure for the foldable exercise apparatus. As aforementioned, to fold the exercise apparatus 10 for storage, the quick release safety lock 14 holding the hinged cross brace 12 is retracted to its stop position releasing the second side wall 18, which also has a quick release safety lock 14 that is disengaged allowing the second side wall 18 to be pivoted out of the way while the hinged cross brace 12 is moved to its stored position, where then the second side wall 18 is pivoted to its storage position against the back wall 28. The quick release safety lock 14 for the first side wall 16 is disengaged from the back wall transverse beam 34 allowing the first side wall 16 to be folded, thereby providing the foldable exercise apparatus 10 of the present invention to be completely folded. Referring to FIG. 6, shown is an illustrative perspective view of the collapsible bench of the exercise apparatus of the present invention. Depicted is the collapsible exercise bench 20 of the present invention having a pivotal front leg 40 and rear leg 42 that fold to a substantially flat state with the front leg 40 having a platform 44 with a pair of openings 46, so that the bench 20 can be attached to bench hangers 48 of the exercise apparatus 10.
