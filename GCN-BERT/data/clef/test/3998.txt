ULTRASONIC SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS WITH PARTIALLY ROTATING BLADE AND FIXED PAD ARRANGEMENT BACKGROUND [0001] The present disclosure generally relates to ultrasonic surgical systems and, more particularly, to ultrasonic systems that allow surgeons to perform cutting and coagulation of tissue. [0002] Over the years, a variety of different types of non-ultrasonically powered cutters and shaving devices for performing surgical procedures have been developed. Some of these devices employ a rotary cutting instrument and other devices employ a reciprocating cutting member. For example, shavers are widely used in arthroscopic surgery. These devices generally consist of a power supply, a handpiece, and a single-use end effector. The end effector commonly has an inner and outer tube. The inner tube rotates relative to the outer tube and will cut tissue with its sharpened edges. The inner tube can rotate continuously or oscillate. In addition, such device may employ a suction channel that travels through the interior of the inner tube. For example, U.S. Patent No. 4,970,354 to McGurk-Burleson, ct al., discloses a non-ultrasonically powered surgical cutting instrument that comprises a rotary cutter for cutting material with a shearing action. It employs an inner cutting member which is rotatable within an outer tube. [0003] U.S. Patent No. 3,776,238 to Peyman et al. discloses an ophthalmic instrument in which tissue is cut by a chopping action set-up by the sharp end of an inner tube moving against the inner surface of the end of an outer tube. U.S. Patent No. 5,226,910 to Kajiyama et al. discloses another surgical cutting instrument that has an inner member which moves relative to an outer member to cut tissue entering through an aperture in the outer member. [0004] U.S. Patent No. 4,922,902 to Wuchinich et al. discloses a method and apparatus for endoscopic removal of tissue utilizing an ultrasonic aspirator. The device uses an ultrasonic probe which disintegrates compliant tissue and aspirates it through a narrow orifice. U.S. Patent No. 4,634,420 to Spinosa et al. discloses an apparatus and method for removing tissue from an animal and includes an elongated instrument having a needle or probe, which is vibrated at an ultrasonic frequency in the lateral direction. The ultrasonic movement of the needle breaks-up the tissue into fragments. Pieces of tissue can be removed from the area of treatment by aspiration through a conduit in the needle. U.S. Patent No. 3,805,787 to Banko discloses yet another ultrasonic instrument that has a probe that is shielded to narrow the beam of ultrasonic energy radiated from the tip of the probe. In one embodiment the shield extends past the tree-end of the probe to prevent the probe from coming into contact with the tissue. U.S. Patent No. 5,213,569 to Davis discloses a phacoemulsification needle which focuses the ultrasonic energy. The focusing surfaces can be beveled, curved or faceted. U.S. Patent No. 6,984,220 to Wuchinich and U.S. Patent Publication No. US 2005/0177184 to Easley disclose ultrasonic tissue dissection systems that provide combined longitudinal and torsional motion through the use of longitudinal-torsional resonators. U. S Patent Publication no. US 2006/0030797 Α1 to Zhou et al. discloses an orthopedic surgical device that has a driving motor for driving an ultrasound transducer and horn. An adapter is provided between the driving motor and transducer for supplying ultrasonic energy signals to the transducer. [0005] There is a need for a surgical instrument that can cut and remove tissue rapidly and hemostatically in an arthroscopic environment. [0006] The foregoing discussion is intended only to illustrate some of the shortcomings present in the field of the invention at the time, and should not be taken as a disavowal of claim scope. SUMMARY [0007] In one aspect, the invention is directed to an ultrasonic surgical instrument that includes a housing that supports an outer sheath. The outer sheath has a distal blade opening therein that defines at least one cutting surface. The outer sheath further has at least one suction lumen therethrough that communicates with the distal blade opening. An ultrasonic transducer assembly is supported by the housing and has a blade coupled thereto. The blade extends through the outer sheath such that a distal tip of the blade extends into the blade opening. A tissue cutting portion of the distal tip of the blade protrudes radially out of the blade opening. A motor is supported by the housing and is coupled to one of the ultrasonic transducer assembly and the outer sheath for applying rotational motion thereto such that the tissue cutting portion of the blade is brought into contact with the one cutting surface on the outer sheath. [0008] In connection with another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of cutting tissue. The method comprises inserting a blade of a surgical instrument into a patient wherein the blade is attached to a source of ultrasonic motion and extends through a hollow outer sheath such that a tissue cutting tip of the blade is exposed through a blade opening in the outer sheath. One of the blade and outer sheath is selectively rotatable relative to the other. The method further includes positioning the blade and outer sheath such that the blade opening is adjacent to target tissue within the patient and applying suction through the outer sheath to draw target tissue into the blade opening. The method also includes oscillating one of the blade and outer sheath relative to the other such that the tissue cutting tip of the blade contacts and traps a portion of the target tissue drawn into the blade opening between the cutting tip and a cutting surface on the outer sheath. [0009] In connection with yet another aspect of the present invention there is provided an ultrasonic surgical instrument that includes a housing that supports an outer sheath. The outer sheath has a distal blade opening therein that defines at least one cutting surface. An ultrasonic transducer assembly is rotatably supported by the housing. A blade is coupled to the ultrasonic transducer assembly and extends through the outer sheath such that a distal tip of the blade extends into the distal blade opening wherein a tissue cutting portion thereof protrudes radially out of the distal blade opening. A motor is supported by the housing and be coupled to the ultrasonic transducer assembly for applying rotational motion thereto such that the tissue cutting portion of the blade is brought into contact with the at least one cutting surface. The instrument further includes means for limiting an amount of torsion experienced by the tissue cutting portion of said blade when in contact with the cutting surface.

[0040] Before explaining various embodiments of the ultrasonic surgical instruments in detail, it should be noted that the illustrative embodiments are not limited in application or use to the details of construction and arrangement of parts illustrated in the accompanying drawings and description. The illustrative embodiments may be implemented or incorporated in other embodiments, variations and modifications, and may be practiced or carried out in various ways. Further, unless otherwise indicated, the terms and expressions employed herein have been chosen for the purpose of describing the illustrative embodiments for the convenience of the reader and are not for the purpose of limitation thereof. It is also intended that any one or more of the following-described embodiments, expressions of embodiments, examples, can be combined with any one or more of the other following-described embodiments, expressions of embodiments, and examples. [0041] Various embodiments are directed to improved ultrasonic surgical systems and instruments configured for effecting tissue dissecting, cutting, and/or coagulation during surgical procedures. In one embodiment, an ultrasonic surgical instrument apparatus is configured for use in open surgical procedures, but has applications in other types of surgery, such as laparoscopic, endoscopic, and robotic-assisted procedures. Versatile use is facilitated by selective use of ultrasonic energy and the selective rotation of the cutting/coagulation implement. [0042] It will be appreciated that the terms “proximal” and “distal” are used herein with reference to a clinician gripping a handpiece assembly. Thus, an end effector is distal with respect to the more proximal handpiece assembly. It will be further appreciated that, for convenience and clarity, spatial terms such as “top” and “bottom” also are used herein with respect to the clinician gripping the handpiece assembly. However, surgical instruments are used in many orientations and positions, and these terms are not intended to be limiting and absolute. [0043] FIG. 1 illustrates in schematic form one embodiment of a surgical system 10 of the present invention. The surgical system 10 may include an ultrasonic generator 12 and an ultrasonic surgical instrument assembly 100 that may include a “self-contained” ultrasonic instrument 110. As will be discussed in further detail below, the ultrasonic generator 12 may be connected by a cable 14 to an ultrasonic transducer assembly 114 of the self-contained ultrasonic instrument 110 by a slip ring assembly 150 located in a housing portion 102 of the surgical instrument assembly 100. In one embodiment, the system 10 further includes a motor control system 20 that includes a power supply 22 that is coupled to a control module 24 by cable 23 to supply, for example, 24VDC thereto. The motor control module 24 may comprise a control module manufactured by National Instruments of Austin, Texas under Model No. NI cRIO-9073. However, other motor control modules may be employed. The power supply 22 may comprise a power supply manufactured by National Instruments. However, other power supplies may be successfully employed. The power supply 22 may be further coupled to a motor drive 26 by cable 25 to also supply 24VDC thereto. The motor drive 26 may comprise a motor drive manufactured by National Instruments or others. Control module 24 may also be coupled to the motor drive 26 by cable 27 for supplying power thereto. A conventional foot pedal 30 or other control switch arrangement may be attached to the control module 24 by a cable 31. As will be discussed in further detail below, the ultrasonic surgical instrument 100 may include a motor 190 that has an encoder 194 associated therewith. As will be explained in further detail below, the motor 190 may be coupled to a torsional spring 300 which, in one embodiment, is coupled to the slip ring assembly 150. In one embodiment, the motor 190 may comprise a stepper motor manufactured by National Instruments under Model No. CTP12ELF10MAA00. The encoder 194 may comprise an encoder manufactured by U.S. Digital of Vancouver, Washington under Model No. E2-500-197-I-D-D-B. However, other motors and encoders may be used. The encoder 194 may be coupled to the motor control module 24 by an encoder cable 32 and the motor 190 may be coupled to the motor drive 26 by cable 33. The surgical system 10 may also include a computer 40 that may communicate by Ethernet cable 42 with the motor control module 24. [0044] As can also be seen in FIG. 1, in various embodiments, the motor control system 20 is housed in an enclosure 21. To facilitate easy portability of the system, various components may be attached to the motor control system 20 by removable cable connectors. For example, foot pedal switch 30 may be attached to a detachable cable connector 37 by cable 35 to facilitate quick attachment of the foot pedal to the control system 20. A/C power may be supplied to the power supply 22 by a conventional plug/cable 50 that is attached to a detachable cable connector 54 that is attached to cable 52. The computer 40 may have a cable 60 that is attached to detachable cable connector 62 that is coupled to cable 42. The encoder 194 may have an encoder cable 70 that is attached to a detachable connector 72. Fikewise, the motor 190 may have a cable 74 that is attached to the detachable connector 72. The detachable connector 72 may be attached to the control module 24 by cable 32 and the connector 72 may be attached to the motor drive 26 by cable 33. Thus, cable connector 72 serves to couple the encoder 194 to the control module 24 and the motor 190 to the motor drive 26. The cables 70 and 74 may be housed in a common sheath 76. [0045] In various embodiments, the ultrasonic generator 12 may include an ultrasonic generator module 13 and a signal generator module 15. See FIG. 1. The ultrasonic generator module 13 and/or the signal generator module 15 each may be integrated with the ultrasonic generator 12 or may be provided as a separate circuit modules electrically coupled to the ultrasonic generator 12 (shown in phantom to illustrate this option). In one embodiment, the signal generator module 15 may be formed integrally with the ultrasonic generator module 13. The ultrasonic generator 12 may comprise an input device 17 located on a front panel of the generator 12 console. The input device 17 may comprise any suitable device that generates signals suitable for programming the operation of the generator 12 in a known manner. Still with reference to FIG. 1, the cable 14 may comprise multiple electrical conductors for the application of electrical energy to positive (+) and negative (-) electrodes of an ultrasonic transducer assembly 114 as will be discussed in further detail below. [0046] Various forms of ultrasonic generators, ultrasonic generator modules and signal generator modules are known For example, such devices are disclosed in commonly owned U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 12/503,770, entitled Rotating Transducer Mount For Ultrasonic Surgical Instruments, filed July 15, 2007,which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. Other such devices are disclosed in one or more of the following U.S. Patents, all of which are incorporated by reference herein: U.S. Patent No. 6,480,796 (Method for Improving the Start Up of an Ultrasonic System Under Zero Load Conditions); U.S. Patent No. 6,537,291 (Method for Detecting a Loose Blade in a Handle Connected to an Ultrasonic Surgical System); U.S. Patent No. 6,626,926 (Method for Driving an Ultrasonic System to Improve Acquisition of Blade Resonance Frequency at Startup); U.S. Patent No. 6,633,234 (Method for Detecting Blade Breakage Using Rate and/or Impedance Information); U.S. Patent No. 6,662,127 (Method for Detecting Presence of a Blade in an Ultrasonic System); U.S. Patent No. 6,678,621 (Output Displacement Control Using Phase Margin in an Ultrasonic Surgical Handle); U.S. Patent No. 6,679,899 (Method for Detecting Transverse Vibrations in an Ultrasonic Handle); U.S. Patent No. 6,908,472 (Apparatus and Method for Altering Generator Functions in an Ultrasonic Surgical System); U.S. Patent No. 6,977,495 (Detection Circuitry for Surgical Handpiece System); U.S. Patent No. 7,077,853 (Method for Calculating Transducer Capacitance to Determine Transducer Temperature); U.S. Patent No. 7,179,271 (Method for Driving an Ultrasonic System to Improve Acquisition of Blade Resonance Frequency at Startup); and U.S. Patent No. 7,273,483 (Apparatus and Method for Alerting Generator Function in an Ultrasonic Surgical System). [0047] As can be seen in FIG. 2, an ultrasonic surgical instrument handpiece 100 may comprise a housing 102 that houses the motor 190, the encoder 194, the slip ring assembly 150 and the self-contained ultrasonic surgical instrument 110. The housing 102 may be provided in two or more parts that are attached together by fasteners such as screws, snap features, etc. and may be fabricated from, for example, polycarbonate, polyetherimide (GE Ultem®) or metals such as aluminum, titanium or steel. The motor 190 may comprise, for example, a stepper motor manufactured by National Instruments. However other motors may be employed to effectuate, for example, “gross” rotational motion of the self-contained ultrasonic surgical instrument 110 relative to the housing 102 on the order of 1-6000 rpm. The encoder 194 converts the mechanical rotation of the motor shaft 192 into electrical pulses that provide speed and other motor control information to the control module 24. [0048] The self-contained ultrasonic surgical instrument 110 may comprise a surgical instrument that is manufactured and sold by Ethicon Endo-Surgery under Model No. ΗΡ054. However, other ultrasonic instruments may be successfully employed. It will be understood that the term “self-contained” as used herein means that the ultrasonic surgical instrument may be effectively used as an ultrasonic surgical instrument on its own, apart from use with the surgical instrument 100. As illustrated in more detail in FIG. 3, the ultrasonic surgical instrument 110 includes a housing 112 that supports a piezoelectric ultrasonic transducer assembly 114 for converting electrical energy to mechanical energy that results in longitudinal vibrational motion of the ends of the transducer assembly 114. The ultrasonic transducer assembly 114 may comprise a stack of ceramic piezoelectric elements with a motion null point located at some point along the stack. The ultrasonic transducer assembly 114 may be mounted between two cylinders 116 and 118. In addition, a cylinder 120 may be attached to cylinder 118, which in turn is mounted to the housing at another motion null point 122. A horn 124 may also be attached at the null point on one side and to a coupler 126 on the other side. A blade 200 may be fixed to the coupler 126. Asa result, the blade 200 will vibrate in the longitudinal direction at an ultrasonic frequency rate with the ultrasonic transducer assembly 114. The ends of the ultrasonic transducer assembly 114 achieve maximum motion with a portion of the stack constituting a motionless node, when the ultrasonic transducer assembly 114 is driven at maximum current at the transducer's resonant frequency. However, the current providing the maximum motion will vary with each instrument and is a value stored in the non-volatile memory of the instrument so the system can use it. [0049] The parts of the ultrasonic instrument 110 may be designed such that the combination will oscillate at the same resonant frequency. In particular, the elements may be tuned such that the resulting length of each such element is one-half wavelength or a multiple thereof. Longitudinal back and forth motion is amplified as the diameter closer to the blade 200 of the acoustical mounting horn 124 decreases. Thus, the hom 124 as well as the blade/coupler may be shaped and dimensioned so as to amplify blade motion and provide ultrasonic vibration in resonance with the rest of the acoustic system, which produces the maximum back and forth motion of the end of the acoustical mounting horn 124 close to the blade 200. A motion from 20 to 25 microns at the ultrasonic transducer assembly 114 may be amplified by the hom 124 into blade movement of about 40 to 100 microns. [0050] When power is applied to the ultrasonic instrument 110 by operation of the foot pedal 30 or other switch arrangement, the control system 20 may, for example, cause the blade 200 to vibrate longitudinally at approximately 55.5 kHz, and the amount of longitudinal movement will vary proportionately with the amount of driving power (current) applied, as adjustably selected by the user. When relatively high cutting power is applied, the blade 200 may be designed to move longitudinally in the range of about 40 to 100 microns at the ultrasonic vibrational rate. Such ultrasonic vibration of the blade 200 will generate heat as the blade contacts tissue, i.e., the acceleration of the blade 200 through the tissue converts the mechanical energy of the moving blade 200 to thermal energy in a very narrow and localized area. This localized heat creates a narrow zone of coagulation, which will reduce or eliminate bleeding in small vessels, such as those less than one millimeter in diameter. The cutting efficiency of the blade 200, as well as the degree of hemostasis, will vary with the level of driving power applied, the cutting rate or force applied by the surgeon to the blade, the nature of the tissue type and the vascularity of the tissue. [0051] As can be seen in FIG. 2, the ultrasonic instrument 110 is supported within the housing 102 by a tailpiece drive adapter 130 and a distal handpiece adapter 134. The tailpiece drive adapter 130 is rotatably supported within housing 102 by a proximal bearing 132 and is ηοηrotatably coupled to the output shaft 192 of the motor 190. See FIG. 2. The tailpiece drive adapter 130 may be pressed onto the housing 112 of the ultrasonic instrument 110. The distal handpiece adapter 134 may be pressed onto a distal end 113 of the handpiece housing 112. The distal handpiece adapter 134 is rotatably supported in the housing 102 by a distal bearing 136 that is mounted within housing 102. [0052] When power is applied to motor 190, motor 190 applies a “gross rotational motion” to the handpiece 110 to cause the ultrasonic surgical instrument 110 and blade 200 to rotate about central axis Α-Α. As used herein, the term “gross rotational motion” is to be distinguished from that “torsional ultrasonic motion” that may be achieved when employing in a non-homogeneous formed ultrasonic blade. The term “gross rotational motion” instead encompasses rotational motion that is not solely generated by operation of the ultrasonic transducer assembly 114. [0053] To provide the ultrasonic instrument 110 with power from the ultrasonic generator 12, a slip ring assembly 150 may be employed. As can be seen in FIG. 2, conductors 151, 152 are coupled to the ultrasonic transducer assembly 114 and extend through a hollow stem portion 132 of the tail piece drive adapter 130. The hollow stem portion 132 is attached to a torsional spring 300 which is attached to the drive shaft 192 of the motor 190. The hollow stem portion 132 is free to rotate within the slip ring assembly 150. A first inner contact 154 is attached to the hollow stem portion 132 for rotational travel therewith about axis Α-Α. The first inner contact 154 is positioned for rotational contact with a fixed outer contact 156 within the slip ring assembly 150. The contacts 154, 156 may be provided in the form of concentrically arranged rings. Conductors 157, 158 are coupled to the fixed outer contact 156 and form generator cable 14. Conductors 191 and 193 are attached to the motor and form motor cable 74 and conductors 195, 197 are attached to encoder 194 and form encoder cable 70. Rotation of the motor shaft 192 results in the rotation of the tailpiece drive adapter 130 and the ultrasonic instrument 110 attached thereto about axis Α-Α. Rotation of the motor drive shaft 192 also results in the rotation of the inner contact 154. Ultrasonic signals from the ultrasonic generator 12 are transferred to the inner contact 154 by virtue of contact or “electrical communication” between the inner contact 154 and the outer contact 156. Those signals are transmitted to the ultrasonic transducer assembly 114 by conductors 151, 152. [0054] As indicated above, various embodiments employ a torsional spring 300 that is mounted between the output shaft 192 of the motor 190 and a distal shaft segment 301 that is coupled to the tailpiece drive adapter 130. However, other torsional springs 300 may be employed. As used herein, the term “torsional spring” refers to those forms of springs that exert pressure along a path that is circular and should be distinguished from compression springs that exert forces in an axial direction. The purpose of torsional spring 300 will be explained below. [0055] Various embodiments may also include a distal nosepiece 160 that may be removably attached to the distal end 103 of the housing 102 by fasteners 161. See FIG. 5. One or more shim members 162 may be positioned between the distal end 103 and the nosepiece 160 to facilitate coaxial attachment between the housing 102 and the nosepiece 160. The nosepiece 160 may be fabricated from, for example, polycarbonate, polyetherimide (GE Ultem®) or metals such as aluminum, titanium or steel. In various embodiments, the distal end 202 of the blade 200 extends through a hollow coupler segment 210 that is journaled within an inner sheath seal 212. Inner sheath seal 212 may serve to establish a substantially fluid-tight and/or airtight seal between the coupler segment 210 and the nosepiece 160. Also in the embodiment of FIG. 4, an inner sheath 220 may be attached to the hollow coupler segment 210 by, for example, a threaded connection or the hollow coupler segment 210 may comprise an integral portion of the inner sheath 220. In one embodiment, a blade pin/torquing member 216 may extend transversely through the blade member 200 and the hollow coupler segment 210 to facilitate movement of the inner sheath 220 with the blade member 200. One or more vented silicone bushings 214 may be journaled around the blade 200 to acoustically isolate the blade 200 from the inner sheath 220. The blade member 200 may have a proximal end 201 that is internally threaded and adapted to removably engage a threaded portion of the coupler 126. To facilitate tightening of the blade 200 to the coupler 126, a tightening hole 108 (FIG. 2) may be provided through the housing 102 to enable a tool (e.g., Allen wrench) to be inserted therethrough into a hole 131 in the tail piece drive adapter 130 to prevent the rotation of the ultrasonic surgical instrument 110 and coupler 126 attached thereto. Once the blade 200 has been screwed onto the coupler 126, the user may remove the Allen wrench or other tool from holes 108, 131 and insert a threaded plug (not shown) into hole 108 to prevent fluids/debris from entering the housing 102 therethrough. [0056] Also in various embodiments, an outer sheath 230 may be coaxially aligned with the inner sheath 220 and blade member 200 and be attached to a distal end 163 of nosepiece 160 by, for example, welding or other suitable means. As can be seen in FIG. 4, a suction port 240 may be attached to the nosepiece 160 to communicate with the hollow outer sheath 230. A flexible tube 242 may be attached to the suction port 240 and communicate with a collection receptacle 243 that is coupled to a source of vacuum, generally depicted as 244. Thus, the outer sheath 230 forms a suction path extending around the inner sheath 220 that begins at a distal tip of the outer sheath 230 and goes out through the suction port 240. Those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that alternate suction paths are also possible. In addition, in alternative embodiments, the inner sheath 220 is omitted. [0057] As can be seen in FIGS. 6 and 7, there is shown a distal tip portion 400 that may be attached to the distal end 231 of the outer sheath 230. In various embodiments, the outer sheath 230 may be fabricated from, for example,, aluminum, titanium, aluminum alloys, steels, ceramics, etc. The distal tip portion 400 may be attached to the distal end 231 of the outer sheath 230 by, for example, welding, adhesive, etc. As shown in FIGS. 6 and 7, the distal tip portion 400 defines two cutting surfaces 402, 404 that form cutting board surfaces on each side of a blade opening 410 formed therein. [0058] FIG. 8 illustrates one form of a distal tissue cutting tip 250 that is formed or otherwise provided on the blade 200. As can be seen in that Figure, the distal tissue cutting tip 250 has a pair of tissue cutting edges 252, 254 formed thereon. In various embodiments, the blade 250 may be fabricated from, for example, Titanium. In the embodiment depicted in FIGS. 6 and 7, a distal blade cap 260 may be attached to the distal end 251 of the distal tissue cutting tip 250 of the blade 200. The distal blade cap 260 may be sized to be rotatably supported within a tip cavity 412 formed in the distal tip portion 400 such that the blade 200 may oscillate back and forth (represented by arrow “”B” in FIGS. 6 and 7) about longitudinal axis Α-Α [0059] Various embodiments of the surgical system 10 provide the ability to selectively apply ultrasonic motion to the blade 200 and gross rotational motion to the blade 200 as well. In some embodiments, for example, frequency ranges for longitudinal ultrasonic motion may be on the order of, for example, 30-80 kHz. In a preferred method of use, the blade 200 rotatably oscillates back and forth such that tissue is approximated between the cutting edges 252, 254 and the cutting surfaces 402, 404 (FIGS. 6 and 7). In various embodiments, tissue pads 270 fabricated from, for example, polytetrafluoroethylene or similar materials may be attached to the cutting surfaces 402, 404 by, for example, adhesives or other suitable fastener arrangements. Thus, the tissue may be approximated between the cutting edges 252, 254 and the cutting surfaces 402, 4040 or tissue pads 270. In use, the blade 200 and tissue may be momentarily both stopped, with the blade applying force to the tissue, and the pad 270 providing a “cutting board” surface on the apposing side. In various embodiments, the ultrasonically actuated blade 200 may act with a desired amount of pressure and time on the tissue. Thus, the computer processor 40 of the control system may be programmed to cause the motor 190 to stop after the blade 200 has trapped the tissue on the pad 270 for a predetermined dwell time. This would increase the amount of energy that is delivered to the tissue, thereby potentially improving the cutting speed or hemostatic effect. In various embodiments, dwell times in the range of 5ms to 10s may be successfully employed, for example. The ultrasonic transducer assembly 114 could be activated to provide ultrasonic motion to the blade prior to trapping the tissue or immediately after the tissue has been trapped between the cutting edge 252, 254 and the tissue pad 270. [0060] During the cutting process, suction may be applied within the outer sheath 230 by the source of suction 244 such that the tissue is drawn in through the blade opening 410. As illustrated in FIGS. 8A-8C, when the blade 200 is in a central position as shown in FIG. 8A, tissue “T”, “T”’ can be drawn into both sides 410R, 410L of the blade opening 410. When the blade 200 oscillates to trap tissue “T” between cutting edge 252 and tissue pad 270 and is retained in that cutting position for the predetermined amount of dwell time, such dwell time allows other tissue “T”’ to be drawn into the portion 410L of the blade opening 410 as shown in FIG. 8Β. Similarly, when the blade 200 is oscillated to trap the tissue “T”’ between the cutting edge 254 and tissue pad 270, and is retained in that position for the predetermined dwell time, other tissue “T” may be drawn into the portion 41 OR of the blade opening 410. It is believed that other devices that use a rotating blade for cutting tissue drawn into an opening in a sheath tend to “kick out” tissue as it is being drawn into the opening. The oscillating blade of various embodiments of the present invention is believed to be faster at cutting tissue than a continuously rotating one because when the blade is stopped, tissue has time to get drawn into an opposing side of the opening, thereby making it less likely to “kick out” when the blade is cutting. [0061] Another unique and novel advantage provided by the present invention is the ability to control the amount of force that is generated at the blade/pad interface. For example, the embodiment described above employs the torsional spring in combination with the stepper motor and encoder to control the amount of force applied to the blade/ad interface. By controlling rotation of the motor past the blade/pad contact point results in the displacement or “loading” of the torsional spring by a certain angle that results in the application of a predetermined amount of torsional force to the blade. For example, Force = [Torsional Spring Rate] χ [Angular Deflection] / [Distance Form Center of Rotation To Blade Edge], Thus, in some non-limiting embodiments, for example, a preferred force would be in the range of 1.5 to 5 lbs. In an alterative embodiment, the motor 190 may comprise a servo motor and be used in connection with an appropriate encoder. In yet another embodiment, the torsional spring may be omitted and the motor output shaft 192 may be connected directly to the tailpiece drive adapter 130. In those embodiments, the motor 190 comprises a servo motor that generates the desired amount of torque based upon the applied current. In yet another embodiment, the control system would measure the amount of impedance in the motor circuit to control the oscillation speed. When engaged in tissue, the motor would draw a high load. Thus, in this embodiment, when the load exceeded a predetermined threshold, the motor could be slowed down to allow the ultrasonic blade to cut through the tissue. [0062] FIG. 9 illustrates an alternative blade embodiment 200’. As can be seen in that Figure, the blade 200’ has a distal tip 250’ that is formed with a pair of blunt tissue cutting edges 252’, 254’. [0063] FIG. 10 depicts another surgical instrument embodiment 500 of the present invention that employs a handpiece 502. In this embodiment, the handpiece 502 includes a housing 302 that houses a transducer assembly 530 that is attached to an ultrasonic hom 324. The ultrasonic horn 324 may be coupled to the proximal end 201 of the blade 200 by a threaded or other suitable connection. The ultrasonic hom 324 may be rotatably supported within the housing 302 by a distal bearing 336. A nosepiece 160 may be attached to the housing 302 in the manner described above. [0064] This embodiment includes a motor 510 that may comprise a stepper motor of the type and construction described above and may have an encoder portion 194 associated therewith that communicates with the control module 24 (FIG. 1) through cable 70 as was described above. The motor 510 may receive power from the motor drive 26 (FIG. 1) through conductors 511, 512 that comprise motor cable 74 that extends through the common sheath 76. The motor 510 has an output shaft 520 that may be rotatably supported within the housing 302 by a first proximal bearing 521. The output shaft may be attached to a torsional spring 540. Attached to the torsional spring 540 is a hollow drive shaft segment 550 that may be rotatably supported within housing 302 by a second proximal bearing 551. A distal portion 552 of the drive shaft segment 550 extends through a slip ring assembly 150. The slip ring assembly 150 is fixed (i.e., ηοηrotatable) within the housing 302 and includes a fixed outer contact 156 that is coupled to conductors 157, 158 that form generator cable 14 (FIG. 1) as was described above. An inner contact 154 is mounted on the hollow drive shaft segment 550 and is in electrical contact or communication with outer contact 156. Conductors 151, 152 are attached to the inner contact 154 and extend through the hollow drive shaft 520 to be coupled to the ultrasonic transducer assembly 530. [0065] This embodiment also employs an outer sheath 230 that may have a distal tip portion 400 attached to the distal end 231 thereof as was described above. The blade may have a distal tissue cutting tip 250 as was described above. When power is supplied to the motor 510, the drive shaft 520 rotates bout axis Α-Α which also causes the transducer assembly 530 to rotate about axis Α-Α. Because the blade 200 is attached to the horn 324, it too rotates with the ultrasonic transducer assembly 530. As was discussed above, the torsional spring 540 in combination with the stepper motor 510 and encoder 190 controls the amount of force applied to the blade/pad interface (i.e., the amount of torsion experienced by the tissue cutting portion of the blade when in contact with the cutting surface/pad). [0066] When the clinician desires to power the ultrasonic transducer assembly 530, power is supplied from the ultrasonic generator 12 (FIG. 1) to the fixed contact 156 in the slip ring assembly 150. Power is transmitted to the ultrasonic transducer assembly 530 by virtue of rotational sliding contact or electrical communication between the inner contact 154 and the outer contact 156. Those signals are transmitted to the ultrasonic transducer assembly 530 by conductors 151, 152. Suction may be applied between the blade 200 and outer sheath 230 through port 240. A collection receptacle 243 and source of suction 240 may be attached to the port 240 by tube 242. The distal end of the blade is exposed through a window in the distal end of the outer sheath 230 to expose the distal tissue cutting tip 250 of the blade 200 to tissue as was discussed above. Thus, this embodiment may otherwise operate in the same manner as ultrasonic surgical instrument assembly 100 described above. [0067] FIG. 11 depicts an alternative surgical instrument embodiment 500’ that is substantially similar in design and operation as the instrument 500 described above, except that this embodiment employs a torsional load cell 560 in place of the torsional spring 540 and encoder 194. For example, a torsional load cell of the type manufactured by Futek Advanced Technologies of Irvine, California under Model No. TRD300 as well as others may be employed. As can be seen in FIG. 11, for example, the torsional load cell 560 may be attached to the output shaft 520 of the motor 510 as well as the hollow drive shaft segment 550. The torsional load cell 560 may communicate with the computer processor 40 by conductors 561, 562 in a known manner to enable the clinician to control the motor 510 based upon the amount of torque detected by the torsional load cell 560. Thus, the clinician may predetermine a desired amount of torque to be applied to the blade 200 and then program the computer processor to provide the appropriate motor control signals to the motor to maintain that level of torque. [0068] FIGS. 12 and 13 depict another surgical instrument embodiment 600 of the present invention that employs a handpiece 601. In this embodiment, the surgical instrument 600 includes a handpiece 601 that includes a housing 602 that houses a transducer assembly 604 that is attached to an ultrasonic hom 606. The ultrasonic horn 606 may be coupled to the proximal end 201 of the blade 200 by a threaded or other suitable connection. In other embodiments, the blade 200 may be integrally formed with the hom 606. The ultrasonic transducer assembly 604 and the ultrasonic hom 606 are non-rotatably mounted within the housing 602. [0069] This embodiment includes a motor 610 that may comprise a stepper motor of the type and construction described above and may have an encoder portion 612 associated therewith that communicates with the control module 24 through conductors 614, 616 in the manners described above. The motor 610 may receive power from the motor drive 26 through conductors 618, 620 that extend through the common sheath 76. The motor 610 is non-rotatably supported within the housing 602 and has an output shaft 630 that has a first drive gear 632 thereon. The first drive gear 632 is in meshing engagement with a second gear 636 that is mounted to a sheath drive shaft 634. The sheath drive shaft 634 may be supported in various bearing arrangements for rotation within the housing 602. In the embodiment depicted in FIGS. 12 and 13, the sheath drive shaft 634 is rotatably supported in a proximal bearing 640 and a distal bearing 642 (FIG. 13). A third drive gear 650 is attached to the distal end of the sheath drive shaft 634. The third drive gear 650 is in meshing engagement with a sheath gear 652 mounted to the proximal end portion 662 of an outer sheath 660 that rotatably extends around the blade 200 and is substantially coextensive therewith. As can be seen in FIG. 12, the proximal end 662 of the outer sheath 660 may have a flange 664 formed thereon that is rotatably received within a saddle portion 670 formed by cooperating standoffs 672 on the housing 602. Such arrangement prevents the outer sheath 660 from moving axially relative to the housing 602 while enabling the outer sheath 660 to rotate about axis Α-Α. [0070] This embodiment also employs a nosepiece 680 that is somewhat similar to the nosepiece arrangement described above. The nosepiece 680 may be removably attached to the housing 602 by screws 681 or other suitable fastener arrangements. In this embodiment, the outer sheath 660 rotatably extends through a passage 682 in the nosepiece 680. Proximal seal 684 and distal seal 686 rotatably support the outer sheath 660 within passage 682 while establishing fluid tight seals therebetween. See FIG. 13. A suction port 240 may provided in the nosepiece 690 and communicates by means of a flexible tube 242 with a collection receptacle 243 that is coupled to a source of vacuum, generally depicted as 244. The outer sheath 660 is sized relative to the blade 200 so as to form a suction path 690 between the outer sheath 660 and the blade 200. At least one suction opening 664 is provided through the outer sheath 660 in the location of the suction port 240 such that as the outer sheath rotatably oscillates through a predetermined range of arcuate motion as will be discussed in further detail below, the suction opening 664 enables tissue pieces that are drawn between the outer sheath 660 and the blade 200 through passage 690 to exit the suction passage 690 out through opening 664 and port 240 to the collection receptacle 243. An internal seal 668 is also provided between the blade 200 and the rotating outer sheath 660 in a location that is proximal of the suction opening 664 as shown. [0071] This embodiment may also employ the distal tip portion 400 of the type and construction described above as well as the distal cutting tip configurations 250, 250’ as described above and illustrated in FIGS. 8 and 9. However, in this embodiment, the blade tip 250, 250’ is stationary and the distal tip portion 400 (and the outer sheath 660) rotatably oscillate back and forth to cut tissue “T”, “T”’ between the cutting edges 252, 254. See FIGS. 14 and 15. The outer sheath 660 may be rotatably oscillated in any of the various manners described above by controlling the actuation of motor 610. As with the above-described embodiments, the outer sheath 660 may be rotatably oscillated to one cutting position and retained in that position for a predetermined dwell time. During the dwell time, other tissue may be drawn into the opposite side of the blade opening. After the dwell time has expired, the blade may rotatably oscillate to the other side of the blade opening to cut the other tissue during a similar dwell time, etc. [0072] When the clinician desires to power the ultrasonic transducer assembly 530, power is supplied form the ultrasonic generator 12 (FIG. 1) to the fixed contact 156 in the slip ring assembly 150. Power is transmitted to the ultrasonic transducer assembly 530 by virtue of rotational sliding contact or electrical communication between the inner contact 154 and the outer contact 156. Those signals are transmitted to the ultrasonic transducer assembly 530 by conductors 151, 152. A suction may be applied between the blade 200 and outer sheath 230 through port 240. A collection receptacle 243 and source of suction 240 may be attached to the port 240 by tube 242. The distal end of the blade is exposed through a window in the distal end of the outer sheath 230 to expose the distal tissue cutting tip 250 of the blade 200 to tissue as was discussed above. Thus, this embodiment may otherwise operate in the same manner as ultrasonic surgical instrument assembly 100 described above. [0073] FIGS. 16-26 depict another surgical instrument embodiment 700 of the present invention. This embodiment may employ a handpiece 502 of the type and construction described above as well as any of the variations employing a rotatably oscillating blade described above. In further alternative embodiments, those suitable handpieces disclosed in the following commonly owned U.S. Patent Applications that have been previously herein incorporated by reference may also be employed. [0074] In various embodiments, the distal end 202 of the blade 200 may extend through a hollow coupler segment 210 that is journaled within an inner sheath seal 212. See FIG. 17. Inner sheath 220 may be attached to the hollow coupler segment 210 by, for example, a press fit, brazing, welding, epoxy, threads, etc. or the hollow coupler segment 210 may comprise an integral portion of the inner sheath 220. In one embodiment, a blade pin/torquing member 216 may extend transversely through the blade member 200 and the hollow coupler segment 210 to facilitate movement of the inner sheath 220 with the blade member 200. One or more vented silicone bushings 214 may be journaled around the blade 200 to acoustically isolate the blade 200 from the inner sheath 220. The blade member 200 may have a proximal end 201 that is internally threaded and adapted to removably engage a threaded portion of the coupler 126 in the various manners described above. In alternative embodiments, the proximal end 201 of the blade may be directly attached to the ultrasonic horn 324 or it may comprise an integral portion thereof. [0075] This embodiment may employ an outer sheath 710 that is fixed to the nosepiece 160. In various embodiments the outer sheath 710 may be fabricated from, for example, co-extruded polyimide or rolled welded metal and be attached to the nosepiece 160 by, for example, welding, adhesive, etc. The outer sheath 710 may be formed with a main lumen 712 and two pad lumens 714, 716 as illustrated in FIG. 18. As can be seen in FIGS. 19 and 20, the distal end 750 of the outer sheath 710 has a blunt end 752 and a blade opening 754 that communicates with the main lumen 712 through which the blade 200 extends. The first pad lumen 714 is defined by a first pad ledge 713 and the second pad lumen 716 is defined by a second pad ledge 715 as shown in FIG. 18. The first pad ledge 713 and the second pad ledge 715 are oriented relative to each other at an angle “A” as illustrated in FIG. 18. In the illustrated embodiment, angle “A” is approximately 135 degrees. As will be discussed below, angle “A” defines the arcuate path in which the blade 200 may travel. In other embodiments, angle “A” may have different magnitudes. [0076] As can be seen in FIG. 20, a first tissue pad 760 may be attached to the first pad ledge 713 and a second tissue pad 770 may be attached to the second pad ledge 715. In various embodiments, the tissue pads 760, 770 may be fabricated from, for example, polytetrafluoroethylene or similar materials and have a serrated tissue gripping surface 762, 772 formed thereon. In alternative embodiments, the tissue surfaces 762, 772 may be flat. The pads 760, 770 may be attached to the pad surfaces 713, 715, respectively by, for example, interference fit, adhesives or mechanical fasteners. Pad 760 may have at least one vacuum port 764 therethrough that communicates with a corresponding first suction hole 717 that extends through the first pad surface 713 and into the first pad lumen 714. Likewise, the second tissue pad 770 may have at least one vacuum port 774 therethrough that communicates with a corresponding second suction hole 719 that extends through the second pad surface 715 and into the second pad lumen 716. Ports 764, 774 may be of any suitable geometry such as holes, stars, rectangular slits, plus signs, etc. [0077] As can be seen in FIG. 22, the blade 200 has a proximal end 201 that may be attached to the coupler 126 in the various manners described above. In alternative embodiments, the blade 200 may be integrally formed with the ultrasonic horn. The blade 200 further has an arcuate tissue cutting portion 780 formed thereon. Other blade configurations could be employed. In various embodiments, the blade 200 may be fabricated from, for example, titanium, brass, aluminum or stainless steel. [0078] As can be seen in FIGS. 17 and 23, a first suction port 790 may be attached to the nosepiece 160 and communicate with a suction control system 850 (FIG. 23) as will be further explained below. The first suction port 790 may communicate with the main lumen 712 to evacuate tissue and fluids therefrom through a flexible tube or hose 792 that is coupled to a first collection line 852 in the collection system 850. A second suction port 800 may be attached to the nosepiece 160 and communicate with the suction control system 850. The second suction port 800 may communicate with the first pad lumen 714 to provide suction thereto. The second suction port 800 communicates with a second collection line 854 in the collection system 850 by a second flexible tube or hose 802. A third suction port 810 may be attached to the nosepiece 160 and communicate with the suction control system 850. The third suction port 810 may communicate with the second pad lumen 716 to provide suction thereto. The second suction port 810 communicates with a third collection line 856 in the collection system 850 by a third flexible tube or hose 812. [0079] As can be further seen in FIG. 23, a first control valve 858 is coupled between the first collection line 854 and the collection receptacle 880 which is coupled to a source of suction 890. The first control valve 858 may communicate with the computer controller 40 in the control system by first conductors 860. A second control valve 862 is coupled between the second collection line 854 and the collection receptacle 880 and communicates with the computer controller 40 through conductors 864. A third control valve 868 is coupled between the third collection line 856 and the collection receptacle 880 and communicates with computer controller 40 through conductors 870. [0080] FIGS. 24-26 illustrate one method of using the instrument 700. To commence use of the device, the distal end of the outer sheath 710 is inserted into the patient’s body cavity with the tissue cutting portion 780 of the blade 200 positioned in the center of the window opening 754 as shown in FIG. 24. Thereafter, the clinician may activate the ultrasonic transducer assembly 530 (FIG. 16) through use of the foot pedal (FIG. 1) or other switching mechanism. The clinician may also activate the source of suction with all three control valves 858, 862, 868 in an open position to apply suction to the main lumen 712 and first and second pad lumens 714, 716. In a preferred embodiment, only one of the control valves 862, 868 for the pad lumens 714, 716 are opened at a time, however, as will be further discussed below. The clinician may then bring the distal end 750 of the outer sheath 710 into contact with target tissue to enable the target tissue to be drawn onto one or both of the tissue pads 760, 770. The tissue fibrils will be held in place on the tissue pads 760, 770 by the vacuum through the suction ports 764, 774. The clinician may then activate the motor 510 (FIG. 16) to rotate the blade 200 such that the tissue cutting portion 780 thereof is rotated onto the tissue on one of the tissue pads 760, 770. FIG. 25 illustrates the tissue cutting portion 780 rotated to a position adjacent to the second tissue pad 770 with the tissue omitted for clarity. The control system 10 automatically or the clinician may manually retain the tissue cutting portion 780 in that position for a predetermined dwell time to ensure transection of the fibrils/tissue. The dwell time may be, for example, approximately three (3) seconds. However, other dwell times may be employed and may be dependent upon the types of tissue to be transected. [0081] Once the dwell time has expired, the suction is discontinued to the pad lumen that the tissue cutting portion 780 of the blade 200 is in contact with. In the example depicted in FIG. 25, the control valve 868 will be moved to a venting position wherein the suction line 812 as well as the pad lumen 716 are vented to atmosphere. This may be automatically accomplished by the control system 10 or through manual switches (not shown) coupled to the control valve 868. The tissue cutting portion 780 may then be returned to the central position illustrated in FIG. 24 by activating the motor 510. This may be automatically accomplished by control system 10 or through manual activation of manual switches (not shown) by the clinician. By rotating the tissue cutting portion 780 of the blade 200 to the central position and discontinuing the suction to the pad lumen 716 will enable any tissue debris remaining on the tissue pad 770 to be sucked through the main lumen 712. The control system may retain the blade tip 780 in the central position for a second predetermined dwell time to provide time for the tissue debris to be evacuated out through the main lumen 712, line 792, line 852, valve 858 and into the collection receptacle 880. Thereafter, once the second dwell time has expired, the control system may open control valve 862 to apply suction to pad lumen 714. In other embodiments, once the clinician observes that the pad 770 is clear from tissue debris, the clinician may then open control valve 862 by manually activating a switch (not shown). [0082] When suction is applied to the pad lumen 714, tissue will be drawn onto the pad 760. The tissue cutting tip 780 may then be rotated onto that tissue on pad 760 as shown in FIG. 26. The control system 10 automatically or the clinician may manually retain the tissue cutting portion 780 in that position for a third predetermined dwell time to ensure transection of the fibrils/tissue. The third dwell time may be, for example, approximately three (3) seconds. However, other third dwell times may be employed and may be dependent upon the types of tissue to be transected. [0083] Once the third dwell time has expired, the suction is discontinued to the pad lumen 760. This may be accomplished by moving the control valve 862 to a venting position wherein the suction line 802 as well as the pad lumen 714 are vented to atmosphere. This may be automatically accomplished by the control system 10 or through manual switches (not shown) coupled to the control valve 862. The tissue cutting portion 780 of the blade 200 may then be returned to the central position illustrated in FIG. 24 by activating the motor 510. This may be automatically accomplished by control system 10 or through manual activation of manual switches (not shown) by the clinician. By rotating the tissue cutting portion 780 of the blade 200 to the central position and discontinuing the suction to the pad lumen 714 will enable any tissue debris remaining on the tissue pad 760 to be sucked through the main lumen 712. The control system may retain the blade tip 780 in the central position for a second predetermined dwell time to provide time for the tissue debris to be evacuated out through the main lumen 712, line 792, line 852, valve 858 and into the collection receptacle 880. Thereafter, once that dwell time has expired, the control system may repeat the above-described processes until the desired amount of tissue has been transected. [0084] In various embodiments, the blade 200 is rotated back and forth quickly (e.g., twenty (20) revolutions per minute (RPM’s), to achieve cutting speeds that may be comparable to the cutting speeds commonly achieved when using current mechanical systems. In addition, however the various embodiments of the present invention provide the added advantage of hemostasis. For example, if a bleeder is encountered, the tissue cutting tip 780 of the blade 200 could be held stationary in the center of the window 754 while it is activated (i.e., receiving ultrasonic motion from the transducer assembly 530) and then be applied to the bleeder to cause hemostasis. The blade tip 780 could be rubbed over the area of the bleeder and ablate the tissue. [0085] The devices disclosed herein can be designed to be disposed of after a single use, or they can be designed to be used multiple times. In either case, however, the device can be reconditioned for reuse after at least one use. Reconditioning can include any combination of the steps of disassembly of the device, followed by cleaning or replacement of particular pieces, and subsequent reassembly. In particular, the device can be disassembled, and any number of the particular pieces or parts of the device can be selectively replaced or removed in any combination. Upon cleaning and/or replacement of particular parts, the device can be reassembled for subsequent use either at a reconditioning facility, or by a surgical team immediately prior to a surgical procedure. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that reconditioning of a device can utilize a variety of techniques for disassembly, cleaning/replacement, and reassembly. Use of such techniques, and the resulting reconditioned device, are all within the scope of the present application. [0086] Preferably, the various embodiments described herein will be processed before surgery. First, a new or used instrument is obtained and if necessary cleaned. The instrument can then be sterilized. In one sterilization technique, the instrument is placed in a closed and sealed container, such as a plastic or TYVEK bag. The container and instrument are then placed in a field of radiation that can penetrate the container, such as gamma radiation, x-rays, or highenergy electrons. The radiation kills bacteria on the instrument and in the container. The sterilized instrument can then be stored in the sterile container. The sealed container keeps the instrument sterile until it is opened in the medical facility. Sterilization can also be done by any number of ways known to those skilled in the art including beta or gamma radiation, ethylene oxide, and/or steam. [0087] In various embodiments, an ultrasonic surgical instrument can be supplied to a surgeon with a waveguide and/or end effector already operably coupled with a transducer of the surgical instrument. In at least one such embodiment, the surgeon, or other clinician, can remove the ultrasonic surgical instrument from a sterilized package, plug the ultrasonic instrument into a generator, as outlined above, and use the ultrasonic instrument during a surgical procedure. Such a system can obviate the need for a surgeon, or other clinician, to assemble a waveguide and/or end effector to the ultrasonic surgical instrument. After the ultrasonic surgical instrument has been used, the surgeon, or other clinician, can place the ultrasonic instrument into a sealable package, wherein the package can be transported to a sterilization facility. At the sterilization facility, the ultrasonic instrument can be disinfected, wherein any expended parts can be discarded and replaced while any reusable parts can be sterilized and used once again. Thereafter, the ultrasonic instrument can be reassembled, tested, placed into a sterile package, and/or sterilized after being placed into a package. Once sterilized, the reprocessed ultrasonic surgical instrument can be used once again. [0088] Although various embodiments have been described herein, many modifications and variations to those embodiments may be implemented. For example, different types of end effectors may be employed. Also, where materials are disclosed for certain components, other materials may be used. The foregoing description and following claims are intended to cover all such modification and variations.
