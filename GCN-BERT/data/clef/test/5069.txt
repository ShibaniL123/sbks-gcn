Example 7-4 : Preparation of 6-bromo-N,5-dimethoxy-N-methylpicolinamide (XXXXVII)
6-Bromo-5-methoxypicolinic acid (XXXXVI) (665 mg, 2.87 mmol) was dissolved in 10 ml of dichloromethane. N,O-dimethylhydroxyamine hydrochloride (336 mg, 3.44 mmol), 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDCI) (659 mg, 3.44 mmol), 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) (105 mg, 0.86 mmol), and triethylamine (TEA) (479 Âµl, 3.44 mmol) were added to the resulting solution and the solution was stirred at room temperature for 16 hrs. And then, the solution was extracted with 30 ml of dichloromethane and 30 ml of water. The organic layer was treated with magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) and filtered, and the solution was concentrated and purified by silica gel column chromatography (normal hexane : ethylacetate = 3 : 1, v/v) to give the title compound as colorless crystals (515 mg, 1.87 mmol, 65 %).
