Composition for use as an abnormal coagulation control plasma in in vitro assays. Cross-reference to related applications This application claims priority to Spanish Patent Application No. 201430343, filed on 13 March 2014, which application is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Description The present invention relates to the field of the clinical analysis of blood, and in particular to a composition comprising human plasma, buffered isotonic solution and ferulic acid to be used as the abnormal coagulation control in haemostasis, coagulation and fibrinolysis assays. The present invention also relates to the use of ferulic acid in the preparation of abnormal control plasma in haemostasis assays. Haemostasis is the group of mechanisms which prevent animals that have a vascular system from bleeding out following an injury. The haemostasis mechanism has a variety of important functions: (a) keeping the blood in a fluid state when it flows through the vascular system, (b) stopping bleeding at the site of a wound or wherever there is blood loss, by forming a clot, and (c) ensuring the clot is removed once the wound has healed. Typically, five elements are involved in haemostasis, namely: the blood vessels, platelets (cell component), coagulation factors, coagulation inhibitors and the fibrinolytic system. Haemostasis thus involves a group of forces which have to interact in perfect balance procoagulant forces and anticoagulant forces. This balance is controlled by various proteins, some of which are known as coagulation factors. It is a very delicate balance where any imbalance could lead to either a prothrombitic state or a blood disorder. It is very important to precisely measure coagulation function because any impairment that is present could be life-threatening. This becomes particularly important in patients who undergo coagulation therapy in thromboembolic conditions. The role of the haemostasis laboratory is to detect and recognise physiological changes in haematological and thrombotic diseases. To do so, various assays are used, such as primary haemostasis assays, coagulometric assays and immunological assays, which allow useful information to be obtained in order to help health professionals make a precise diagnosis and devise suitable treatment therefor. Haemostasis assays can be divided into two distinct groups: initial haemostasis assessment, which can include the prothrombin time (ΡΤ), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), determination of fibrinogen concentration, and thrombin time (ΤΤ); and the other group, which can include specific assays such as reptilase time (RT), activated coagulation time (ACT), and determination of the concentration of antithrombin (AT), protein C, protein S, von Willebrand factor, plasminogen and a2-antiplasmin (plasmin inhibitor). In haemostasis laboratories, patient samples are analysed for a wide variety of haemostasis screens and specific assays throughout the working day. In these assays, methodological control of the variables that affect the efficiency and efficacy of the haemostasis assays is essential for a correct diagnosis. The use of control plasmas plays an important role in these internal quality controls carried out by laboratories. It is highly recommended to use, at regular intervals, one control in the normal coagulation time range and another in the abnormal range to ensure the proper functioning of the reagents and devices used in the haemostasis laboratory. Recommendations have been published regarding the frequency with which control materials should be tested for some coagulation assays. For example, the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) has published guidelines relating to the ΡΤ and aPTT assays. Said documents recommend testing, at least, two levels of control materials every 8 hours, or more frequently if samples are processed in a continuous manner as is the case in many laboratories. This document from the CLSI also indicates that the control sample should be used in the first assay that is carried out following a change of reagent or the inclusion of new reagents or following a significant apparatus change. The controls allow for the assessment of the analytical precision and deviation of both the coagulation assays in the coagulometer system employed and the reagents used. Literature has been published relating to the preparation of coagulation control plasma, and some of these plasmas are currently commercially available. However, the majority of the methods described are time-consuming and include expensive steps for the absorption of critical plasma protein factors to obtain the abnormal coagulation properties. One method for preparing abnormal coagulation control plasma comprises incubating normal plasma with aluminium hydroxide and then centrifuging said plasma. The sediment contains various coagulation factors and the resultant supernatant can be used as pathological control plasma. Abnormal clotting times are achieved by removing the coagulation factors from the plasma. However, the coagulation control plasma thus obtained is not completely satisfactory, since abnormal results are obtained in some assays whilst in others, for example factors VIII, XI and XII, as well as in other haemostasis assays such as ΤΤ and RT, the activity is within the normal range. Another method for producing an abnormal coagulation control is to dilute normal plasma. Said method is described in an international guide (NCCLS Η30-Α2), which mentions how to prepare an abnormal control plasma for determining fibrinogen according to the Clauss method. Said document also describes how a series of normal plasmas can be diluted with a barbital buffer to obtain plasma having an abnormal result (low fibrinogen content). The final result of the dilution of a series of normal plasmas is abnormal in the majority of the haemostasis assays. However, said coagulation control plasma is not abnormal for ΤΤ and RT for example. The same result is obtained by diluting the normal plasma with other solutions, such as a 4 % albumin solution. Summary of the Invention According to one aspect, the present invention provides a composition for use as an abnormal coagulation control plasma in in vitro assays, comprising human plasma, buffered isotonic solution and ferulic acid, wherein said human plasma has been obtained by known human plasma extraction methods and in that said buffered isotonic solution has a pH of between 6.5 and 8.5. According to another aspect, the present invention provides a composition when used as an abnormal coagulation control plasma in in vitro assays, comprising human plasma, buffered isotonic solution and ferulic acid, wherein said human plasma has been obtained by known human plasma extraction methods and in that said buffered isotonic solution has a pH of between 6.5 and 8.5. According to another aspect, the present invention provides use of ferulic acid in the preparation of an abnormal coagulation control in in vitro assays. The present invention discloses an abnormal coagulation control plasma that overcomes all the aforementioned drawbacks. The abnormal control plasma of the present invention ensures both results in the abnormal range in a large number of haemostasis assays, including ΤΤ and RT, and determination of the activity of specific coagulation factors. The present inventors have surprisingly found that by adding ferulic acid in an isotonic solution to normal plasma, it is possible to obtain an abnormal control plasma that can be used effectively in the majority of haemostasis assays. Without being linked to any theory in particular, it is possible that this property of the ferulic acid is obtained by means of a characteristic anticoagulant property thereof. However, the fact that a substance has anticoagulant properties does not mean that it is suitable for producing abnormal plasma. For example, warfarin is one of the most widely used anticoagulants in healthcare for treating patients at risk of thrombosis, and has been used as a medication for more than 50 years. However, this compound is not suitable for being added to plasma and producing an abnormal coagulation control since its mechanism of action is based on inhibiting the synthesis of coagulation factors that depend on vitamin Κ. As an anticoagulant, warfarin requires a complete in vitro system. Other anticoagulant compounds, such as heparin or ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), can indeed be added to normal plasma and produce abnormal times in the haemostasis assays. However, the present inventors have not obtained similar results with the anticoagulants heparin or EDTA. Neither of these anticoagulants is suitable for producing abnormal plasma since they have inconsistent effects on haemostasis assays. That is to say, the optimum concentration for obtaining an abnormal time in an assay is insufficient or excessive for another assay. For example, heparin prolongs the aPTT assay, yet does not affect the ΡΤ assay, or does so to a lesser extent. Moreover, heparin does not prolong the RT assay, or rather does not produce abnormal plasma for RT. The case is similar with EDTA, which, at a certain concentration, can prolong the RT assay, yet does not affect the results of ΡΤ, aPTT and ΤΤ assays, or does so very slightly. Therefore, the present invention discloses a composition comprising ferulic acid, buffered isotonic solution and human plasma for use as an abnormal coagulation control plasma in haemostasis assays. In the composition of the present invention, the term ‘human plasma’ refers to the liquid part of the blood from which the red blood cells, white cells and platelets have been removed. In addition, the human plasma used in the composition of the present invention is one which has a normal coagulation time in the various assays and is thus capable of being used as a normal control in coagulation assays. Said plasma can be obtained by any methods known in the art, for example by plasmapheresis. An additional advantage of the composition of the present invention for abnormal coagulation control in haemostasis assays is that said composition can be frozen or lyophilised and remains stable once thawed or reconstituted. To obtain a composition for abnormal coagulation control in haemostasis assays, it is preferable to use a pool of normal plasma containing plasma from two or more healthy human donors. Said plasma pool can be prepared by gentle mixing in a suitable container. The concentration of normal plasma in the composition of the present invention is in the range of from 15 % ν/ν to 75 % ν/ν. The main role of the buffered isotonic solution present in the composition of the present invention for abnormal coagulation control in haemostasis assays is that of maintaining a pH around the physiological pH, i.e. between 6.5 and 8.5, but also to allow the plasma to be diluted so as to obtain an abnormal coagulation time, when combined with ferulic acid. The isotonic solution of the present invention can be any isotonic solution known in the art. Preferably, the isotonic solution of the present invention is a buffer that maintains a pH around the value of the physiological pH between 6.5 and 8.5 (for example Tris, HEPES, MOPS or CHAPS). The amount of isotonic solution in the composition of the present invention is in the range of from 40 % ν/ν to 70 % ν/ν. On the other hand, the amount of ferulic acid in the composition of the present invention is in the range of approximately 0.01 % w/v to approximately 1 % w/v. In addition, the composition of the present invention for abnormal coagulation control in haemostasis assays can optionally comprise a coagulation factor stabiliser. A coagulation factor stabiliser can provide said composition with additional stability. Said coagulation factor stabiliser is preferably glycine, more preferably, said glycine is present in the composition for abnormal coagulation control in haemostasis assays of the present invention in an amount of from approximately 0.1 % w/v to approximately 4 % w/v. The composition of the present invention for abnormal coagulation control in haemostasis assays can also optionally comprise a protein stabiliser or a protein additive and/or a bulking agent, and a preservative. The main function of said stabiliser is to preserve the functionality of the proteins once they have been lyophilised. Said stabiliser can be any stabiliser known by a person skilled in the art. Finally, the present invention discloses the use of ferulic acid in the preparation of an abnormal coagulation control in haemostasis assays. The present invention will be described in more detail below with reference to illustrative examples, which do not limit the present invention, and the drawings, in which: Fig. 1 shows the effect of ferulic acid with respect to control samples in the ΡΤ haemostasis assay, Fig. 2 shows the effect of heparin with respect to control samples in the ΡΤ haemostasis assay, Fig. 3 shows the effect of EDTA with respect to control samples in the ΡΤ haemostasis assay, Fig. 4 shows the effect of ferulic acid with respect to control samples in the aPTT haemostasis assay, Fig. 5 shows the effect of heparin with respect to control samples in the aPTT haemostasis assay, Fig. 6 shows the effect of EDTA with respect to control samples in the aPTT haemostasis assay, Fig. 7 shows the effect of ferulic acid with respect to control samples in the ΤΤ haemostasis assay, Fig. 8 shows the effect of heparin with respect to control samples in the ΤΤ haemostasis assay, Fig. 9 shows the effect of EDTA with respect to control samples in the ΤΤ haemostasis assay, Fig. 10 shows the effect of ferulic acid with respect to control samples in the RT haemostasis assay, Fig. 11 shows the effect of heparin with respect to control samples in the RT haemostasis assay, and Fig. 12 shows the effect of EDTA with respect to control samples in the RT haemostasis assay. Examples Example 1. Preparation of abnormal plasma control compositions for haemostasis assays. To assess the effect of different anticoagulants in various haemostasis assays, different plasma compositions were prepared. Use was made of citrated normal human plasma (16 mM of citrate), stored at a temperature of below -70 °C and thawed in a bath at 37 °C. HEPES was then added up to a final concentration of 40 mM and the pH was adjusted to between 7.4 and 7.6 using NaOH 1Ν. Various plasma compositions were prepared. No anticoagulant was added to the first composition, which was used as a control. Increasing concentrations of the anticoagulants being analysed were added to the others: ferulic acid (0.5 %, 1 % and 1.5 %), heparin (0.1 lU/mL, 0.5 lU/mL and 1 lU/mL) and EDTA (0.5 mg/mL, 1 mg/mL, 1.5 mg/mL). Each plasma composition was analysed for the aforementioned ΡΤ, aPTT, ΤΤ and RT assays in a Q Haemostasis Analyzer (Diagnostic Grifols, Spain) using the reagents DG-PT, DG-APTT Synth, DG-TT L Human and GD-Fibroclotin of Diagnostic Grifols. Example 2. Effect of compositions comprising anticoagulants in the ΡΤ assay. Fig. 1-3 show the results obtained in the ΡΤ assay with the various anticoagulants and plot the time obtained in the ΡΤ assay as a function of the concentration of the anticoagulant present in the plasma. The control (plasma having no anticoagulant) is shown by triangles and the compositions comprising ferulic acid, heparin and EDTA are shown by squares. It can be seen that ferulic acid (Fig. 1) and EDTA (Fig. 3) produce a reduction in the percentage of ΡΤ activity that is proportional to the amount of anticoagulant present in the plasma. By contrast, heparin (Fig. 2) does not cause any different result to that of the plasma having no anticoagulant. This means that, at the concentrations tested, heparin has no effect on the ΡΤ assay. On the other hand, ferulic acid and EDTA added to normal plasma do produce a reduction in the percentage of ΡΤ activity. Example 3. Effect of compositions comprising anticoagulants in the aPTT assay. The same plasmas prepared in Example 1 were tested in the aPTT assay (Fig. 4-6). In this assay, all the anticoagulants added to the plasma, i.e. ferulic acid (Fig. 4), heparin (Fig. 5) and EDTA (Fig. 6) prolong the ΡΤ assay. In addition, the prolongation in the result of the assay is proportional to the amount of anticoagulant present in the plasma. Example 4. Effect of compositions comprising anticoagulants in the ΤΤ assay. The same plasmas prepared in Example 1 were tested in the ΤΤ assay. Fig. 7-9 show the ΤΤ results obtained when testing the prepared plasmas. Of the three anticoagulants analysed, EDTA (Fig. 9) does not prolong the result of the assay, that is to say, does not generate an abnormal ΤΤ. By contrast, both heparin (Fig. 8) and ferulic acid (Fig. 7) do produce an abnormal ΤΤ. Example 5. Effect of compositions comprising anticoagulants in the RT assay. The same plasmas prepared in Example 1 were tested in the RT assay. Referring to the results of the RT assay (Fig. 10-12), the only anticoagulant that does not produce an abnormal result after being added to a normal plasma pool is heparin (Fig. 11). Fleparin does not prolong the RT at any of the concentrations tested. Plasmas containing the anticoagulants ferulic acid (Fig. 10) and EDTA (Fig. 12) do produce an abnormal RT result. On the basis of the results shown in the examples and the preceding figures, the anticoagulant power of ferulic acid and its ability to cause abnormal results in all haemostasis assays after being added to normal plasma are clear. In addition, ferulic acid prolongs the assays in a balanced manner, thus making it suitable for the production of abnormal control plasma.
