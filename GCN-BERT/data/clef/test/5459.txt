ì ïl •. ..'a !.:i iI. lO This invention relates to processes for converting äliphatic mercaptans and secondary and tertiary alcohols into carboxyl.ì.c acids and derivatives thereof, under the condi.tions of the Wil].gerod5 reaction. Particularly, the invention relates to the treatment of compounds of the types here.[nabove recited with an anmlonium polysulfide or with an ammonia ar,d sul.['ur, wherein the ammonia or ammonium group may be an organically substituted ammonia or ammonia group, either in aqueous or substantially anhydrous media, and with or without the addition of inert solvents, the resulting carboxylic acid derivatives comprising free carboxylic acids, sails of carbo>:yiu acids, amides o.[ carboxylic acids, thioamides, N-diand mono-substituted amides and thiom,[[des, and hydrolytic proçlucLs of all i' j '.i..

In 1887 Wìllgerodt discovered that aryl alkyl ketones react at high temperature and under pressure with yel].ow ammonium polysulîide to form crystalline nitrogenous materials (Ber., 20, 2&67 (1887)). The next year he reported that these products were the amides of the aryl-substituted aliphatic acids containing the same number of carbon atoms as thé; sbarbing ketones, accompanied by the harmonium salts of these acids (Ber., 2] 31 (1888)). During the next twenty-fou years he e «tended the reaction, which has in recent years borne nì.s name, to a hosb of aryl lower alkyl ketones (J. prakt. Ch ì., (2), 80, (2) (2), The classical Willgerodt reaction may be i]]us cated .. by the following equation: Ar-CO-(CH2)n-CH3 Ar-CH2 (CI 2 ) n"CONH2 During the past few years thè technique of conducting ,l this reaction has been improved, and extended to additional aryl IG -2- '•ï..

(19 i)) introduced a variant of the reaction in which dimethylamine and sulçur are used in place oF ammonium polysulfide. Schwenk (J.AoC.S., 64, 3051 (].9t 2)) used mor'pholine ' ,'1 t and piperidine as the amines in K.indlerts variant, with the resultant advantage that the reaction need not be carried out under pressure in a closed s.vsterl. ModificaLioas such as these where anhydrous conditions are employed result in the formation of nitrogen-substituted thioamides, according to the following equation: ArCOCH3 R2NHS-- ArCI[2CSNR2-/-I[20 Fieser (J.A°C.S., 62, 1351 (1940)) added d:ioxanc to the ammonium po].ysulfide, which modification allows the reaction with aryl a].kyl ketones to proceed at a lower temperature. Both Kì.ndler and Schwenk showed that tla. ar group can be substituted by certain radicals which' arc inert under the conditions o the Willgerodt reaction, for «Kample, halo, alkyl, alkoxyl and thioether groups. In the course of a study oç the scope and mechanisra o the Willgerodt reaction, I have discovered that, the rcáction is of much broader scope than heretofore realized. Thus not only the thereto[ore employed compounds which are ar.yl a[ky.[ ketches, bu[, also a wide variety o classes of compounds herctof'ore unsuspected of being used for he purpose, such as d]alkyl ,»'i ::il i:I ketches, aralkyl a]kyl ketones, cycloalkyl alky], ketones, alicyclic ketones, aliphatic and aromatically s : t.it.uted al.ip.I}a ic mercaptans, secondary and tertiary alcohols, a7i.phatic organic halides, and a variety ofi unsaturated organic compound including aliphaticand aromatic-substituted clef ins and halogen derivatives •thereof, undergo transformatïon un(h r the conditions IG -3- ••p 'i m :'1' 4:88068 of the Willgerodt reaction and thus may be converted under' suitable conditions into carboxylic acids and deri.vat, ives thereor having he same number oç carbon atoms as the or y r ic: compounds çro:n which they are formed. Suitable conditions roc the reactions I have discovered ìnclude heating uìth t, lle çol!owìng reagents; the terre "reagent o the WillgerodL reactiop" as used herein comprises any or these corapositions: 1.

Those thioamides contain the group -CSNRRt whcce R and [1' are hydrogen or aliphatic organic radicals.

The subject malter claimed in the instant application is directed to the extended Wi]igerodt reaction as applied to certain classes of mercaptans and alcohols. The mercaptans which may be used in the practice of my invention include all of the usual aliphatic mercaptans, both saturated and unsaturated,having the general formula KSH, wherein R ,nay be a primary (e.g., ethyl or decyl mercaptans), secondary (e.g., isopropyl mercaptan) or tertiarY!(e.g., tertiarybutyl mercaptan) aliphatic radical. R may be saturated or it may contain unsaturated groups as in the case of allyl mercaptan, and it may contain an alicyclic, heterocyclic or aromatic radical. R may be aralkyl (e.g., benzyl and alphaand betaphenylethyl mercaptans), and the aralkylgroup may be primary, secondary or tertiary. Further, fihe aryl substituent of the aralkyl group may be substituted th radicals which are unaffected under the conditions of the Willgerodt reaction such as halogen, alkyl, aralkyl, aryl, ether and thio ether radicals. In the case where R is aliphatic it may be straightor branchedchain, or cyclic. The hydroxyl derivatives which may be used comprise all the usual secondary and tertiary aliphatic and aromaticsubstituted aliphatic alcohols, both saturated and unsaturated. The alcohol may be substituted with one or more aryl nuclei, as for example phenylmethylcarbinol, and these aryl nuclei in turn may be substituted faith radicals which are unaffected under the conditions of the Willgerodt reaction. The conditions of the modifications of the Willgerodt IG .k ,q ì A : :,' ,i ' i:.iiii , i • ï . ,i, 3o 1i .• reaction which comprises my invention are, in general, treatment ci the organic compound at an elevated temperature with an alsnonium polysulide or an azamonia and su].£ur, it, b i O unde - stood that the ammonium group or ammonia ,nay be (:;,lb ti.t, ut d with organic radicals as herein disclosed. £' necessary, the reaction can be carried out in a closed system in coder to provent the loss of volatile constituents. Pressure conditions are often desirable. Inert soi.vents such as dioxano, benzene pyridine, primary alcohols, and water may be advantageously i employed to render the complex mixtures homogeneous and te reduce the total vapor pressure ci the heated reaction mass. E]evafled temperatures are usually required for the Wi].Igerodt reacL;ion. The range of temperature which is suitable can be quine wide. Temperatures as high as 330 0 C. were used by Willgerodt and are suitable for my invention. Uowevcr, such high temperatures cause more or less resinir[cation of the compound used, with consequent reduction in yield of the acid derivative. When an organic solvent is added to an aqueous reaction mixture, te1 ñperatures of about 150 C. are te be preferred. If no solvent is so employed, the optimum temperature is in the range of190-2100 C. If the reaction mixture does not contain water, as when anhydrous a,LgLonia or an ami.nu ml : u]çur are used, the reaction temperature can be as low as the rang of IO0 -]50 0C. Amines having boiling points in [,he neighborhood of i00 0 Ce may be used under reflux. The reaction generally requires moderately long periods oç time., With aqueous anunoniurn polysulçide the period varies rom I1 to 30 hours. When an organic solvent is added, t%1 e rime nmy be decreas<;d te some extent. If water is excluded from the reaction mixl,ure, 5ho reachion often proceeds quite rapidly, in some instances being IG -6i. i(•' 'L 48 ,068 w complete in much less time than required• for those reactions carried out in the presence of water. Secondary and tertiary alcohols and mercaptans react less readily than do olefins and other unsaturated compound, and for this reason temperatures higher than2000 C. a d long periods of time are o['ten necessary. Secondary alcohols are more inert than tertiary and more vigorous treatment maly be cquired. Tertiary mercaptans appear to be hess reactive than secondary mercaptans, which in turn are somewhat less reactive in genera]. •than the primary mercaptans. The optimum cor«l ibions for each class of compound used are readily ascertained I» s mi» experiments. Representative conditions are illustrated ì« l;hc appended examples. The Willgerodt reaction is but one oç :)evera]. reaction which may occur. There are a number of competing rt.« cl0 ions, all of which take place fo some extent, with reõu].ting decreases in yields of acid derivatives. Among •these are reduction of: t, he reactive group of the compound to the methylene gro p.in /, formation of substituted thiophenes, cleavage of the compound to sma11er fragments, and resinification of the compound. These' reactions are undesirable and can be eliminated by the proper selection of conditions o temperature, time, scud proi»orbior of reagents. The polonium polysulfide reagent which ]- pre" is thai: discovered by Willgerodt fo give the mos results. It is made by saturating concentric urn hydroxide aL ordinary temperature with :"' then dissolving in the resulting so].u io equal to one-t, enth the weight of the se ing a yellow harmonium polysulfide sol' • /i .i ç • IO 3o i / possible to modify the proportions of the componun;,s of this solution considerably. In general, howevèr, such changed are not desirable since they promote side-reactions. ] ç, for instance, the relative amount of the sulfur is increased, the araoun5 of cleavage of the compound is greater. 1" i:; de- eased, there is more reduction of 5he reactive gt'oup of the compound to the methylene group. There must, o[ course, be elemental or polysulfidic sulfur present for the conversion of compounds of the type herein disclosed 50 acids or derivatives thereof. If there is none» no acid derivative is former but rather thìophene derivatives are obtained when t}](; organic compound has the carbon skeleton Ar-C-C, wherein A is an aromatic radical. The relative amoun5s o£ compound an(] of ammonium po].ysulfide solution may vary over a fairly wide range. I have found that 9 parts of eumnonium polysulfide solution to I part of the organic compound gives satisfactory yields of acid derivatives in most cases and these amounts are pre, ferred. I« general the sulfur organic compound molar ratio should be in the range of ]. i0. Even higher ratios are effective, although uneconomica!. While it is necessary thai, the specific optìmum coe;dirons l'or the reaction be worked out. by experiment for each :mbstancc, the process which I disclose and whìch is illustrated in the appended examples will. give satisfactory resu].ts ihh any organic compound of the ype herein contemplated. Ï have further discoveìed that the Wi].],ger dt reac[,[on.., may be Carried out under several dìçfere],t sets of conditions. The usual conditions of the Reaction .rare treatment:, d.5h yellow; ammonium polysulfide at e].evated température and il" r]ecessary under pressure in order to re ain volatile materi al. A i'olvent IG -8- .,J 'I [4 . n r 48 80 68 such as dioxane may be added in order te produce a hoiLLogenous t reaction noess. A modification of these conditions i.' the use oç oulîur and an aliphatic amine or ammonia instead e V ammonium polysultide. I£ the amìnè Is su gicient]y high-l,,»i] b,L" i.t is unnecessary to carry out the reaction under pressure. Al.se instead of anunonium polysulçide, substituted mzmtonium polysul- !0 sides can be employed. For example 30';g aqueous dimetl,y]arnine may be saturated with hydrogen sul£ide and treated wi (,h su] f'ur. This reagent, when heated with a compound of the typ(, her'e.i.n contemplated will gì.vo rise to the N,N-dimeI',hylamide o a C&l:'bo y] le acid. I have discovered that the presence of hydro or su] ['idc in the reaction is unnecessary, and in certain instanc::es even detrimental. This discovery enables one to cot, duct Wì].]gerodL reactions by treating the unsaturated hydrocarbon derivnt [ve, ketone, aldehyde, secondary or tertiary alcohol, mercaptan, or organic halide with sulfur and ammonia or a substituted an aonia of the geneï'al formula RRvR"N wherein R, l v artd R" a c hydrogoal or aliphatic groups such as a]!çyl and cycloalkyl, or there R and RV Logegher £orm a non-aromatic cyclic nucleas and R" is hydrogen or an aliphatic group, Thus hydrogen suicide, instead of being an òSSential reactant in the Wi].].ger'odL reacI:.[on, is but an õptional agent, and the appended ci.aires are to ho il,terpreted in this light. The reaction proceeds will, or' v1 ithoui, the presence of wager. If water is present, carbo» ylic :q • i 3o acids and am:i.des thereof are ['ormed.

In ar,y parti c-" lal. case the optimum conditions of temperature, gimü, so].w: and proportions of reagents are readily determined. In g r - eral if may be said that i mole of the organic compound to bu converted, 1½ to 3 moles of sulfur and 2 to 5 moles el the amine or' ammonia will result in a satisfactory conversion of" the compound 50 an acid derivative. Temperatures somewhat foc, ler than2000.0• are usually suitable for 5te reaction, and often the length of time need be only 1 o 2 hours and 1 :erLain instances less. than an hour° While it has been recognized that hydrogen sulfìd,, is no a required compound o the reagent for the Willg ru:I5 caction when an amine is one of the constituents, t has 05 been previously known that hydrogen sulfide is unessential when m nonìa, either aqueous or anhydrous, is employed in the reagent. On the contrary, during the 58 years'in which 5he WillgerodL reaction has been used as a synthetic mebhud of.. organic chemistry, hydrogen sulfide has invariably bee a component of the reagent whenever a mnonia has b en used, bha5 is, the ammonia has been suturafled wÌfih hydìogen sulfi.:le, has generally been £houghfl that hydrogen sulfide was an üs - ential component of the Willgerodt reagent whenever" ammonia was an ingredient. My discovery enables one to carçj out Lhe reaction without this substance. This improvement, greatly simplifies the manipulation required, since all Lha5 one need do te prepare the reagent is add powde ed sulfur [,o ammonia, either aqueous or anhydrous, or to an amine. IL liminales handling the disagreeable and toxic hydrogen sulfide gas's and the time required to saturate the a nonia'with lb is saved. ]in IG -i0iO 488068 many instances the yields are actually increased b,' the uso of this modification. For examp].e, styrene may be co,,ver'tod by this improved procedure into a mixture of phenylacutìc acid ar1 d phenylacetamide in a total yield of 93 compared to 60-7Oç{ yield when hydrogen sulfide is added to the reagent. The Willgerodt reaction may be carried cub in aquoous or in anhydrous media with or without inert solvents. Inert solvents which are suitable include water, primary alcohols, dioxane, pyridine, benzene and low-boiling hydrocarbons and other organic substances which are unaffected by the reagent at elevated temperatures. It is desirable that Lh solvent be miscible with mmnonìa and in certain instances with wator, although water-mlscibility is'not always essential.
