Step 4. Preparation of 3-Aminomethyl-2-phenyl-4H-chromen-4-one hydrochloride
3-Bromomethyl-2-phenyl-4H-chromen-4-one (157mg, 0.5mmol) was dissolved in 5ml of DMF; 2ml of aqueous ammonia was added and stirred at room temperature overnight. TLC tracking was performed until the completion of the reaction. Water was added to the reaction solution, and the reaction solution was extracted with ethyl acetate, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate until the organic layer was concentrated to about 5ml. The saturated solution of hydrogen chloride in ethyl acetate was added and an off-white solid was gradually precipitated. Suction filter and drying were carried out to give 82mg of product, yield: 57.1%.
