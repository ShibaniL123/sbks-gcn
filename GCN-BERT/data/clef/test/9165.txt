Technical Field The present invention relates to an anthracene derivative and an organic electroluminescence (EL) device utilizing the derivative, in particular, an organic EL device having high luminous efficiency and capable of emitting light with a long lifetime, and an anthracene derivative for realizing the device. Background Art An organic EL device is a spontaneous light emitting device which utilizes the principle that a fluorescent substance emits light by energy of recombination of holes injected from an anode and electrons injected from a cathode when an electric field is applied. Since an organic EL device of the laminate type driven under a low electric voltage was reported by C. W. Tang et al. of Eastman Kodak Company (C. W. Tang and S. A. Vanslyke, Applied Physics Letters, Volume 51, Pages 913, 1987 or the like), many studies have been conducted on organic EL devices using organic materials as the constituent materials. Tang et al. used tris(8-hydroxyquinolinol aluminum) for a light emitting layer and a triphenyldiamine derivative for a hole transporting layer. Advantages of the laminate structure are that the efficiency of hole injection into the light emitting layer can be increased, that the efficiency of forming exciton which are formed by blocking and recombining electrons injected from the cathode can be increased, and that exciton formed within the light emitting layer can be enclosed. As described above, for the structure of the organic EL device, a two-layered structure having a hole transporting (injecting) layer and an electron transporting light emitting layer and a three-layered structure having a hole transporting (injecting) layer, a light emitting layer, and an electron transporting (injecting) layer are well known. To increase the efficiency of recombination of injected holes and electrons in the devices of the laminate type, the structure of the device and the process for forming the device have been studied. Further, as the light emitting material, chelate complexes such as tris(8-quinolinolato)aluminum complexes, coumarine derivatives, tetraphenylbutadiene derivatives, bisstyrylarylene derivatives, and oxadiazole derivatives are known. It is reported that light in the visible region ranging from blue light to red light can be obtained by using these light emitting materials, and development of a device exhibiting color images is expected. Further, in recent years, a large number of investigations have been conducted on the use of a phosphorescent compound as a light emitting material and the use of energy in a triplet state in EL light emission. A group of Princeton University has reported that an organic EL device using an iridium complex as a light emitting material shows high luminous efficiency. In addition to the organic EL device using a lowmolecular weight material as described above, an organic EL device using a conjugated polymer has been reported by a group of Cambridge University. In this report, light emission has been confirmed from a monolayer of polyphenylene vinylene (PPV) formed in a coating system. Recent advances in organic EL device are remarkable, and characteristics of the organic EL device allow formation of a thin and lightweight light-emitting device with high luminance under application of a low voltage, wide range of emission wavelengths, and high-speed response, thereby suggesting the possibility of extensive uses. In association with the significant progress of an organic light emitting device, performance requested of a light emitting material has been growing. For example, Patent Documents 1 to 6 each disclose an anthracene derivative. In addition, Patent Documents 7 to 10 each disclose an anthracene derivative containing dibenzofuran, dibenzothiophene, and a carbazole derivative. Each of those material systems shows improved performance, but involves, for example, the following problem: each of the systems still has low luminous efficiency. Accordingly, none of the systems has satisfied characteristics requested of a light emitting material needed to have an optical output with additionally high luminance or additionally high efficiency with which a voltage applied to the material is converted into light yet. In addition, a sufficient material, especially light emitting material, for an organic EL device having the following characteristics has not been found yet: the material meets requests for durability against, for example, a change over time due to the long-term use of an organic EL device containing the material or the deterioration of the device due to an atmospheric gas containing oxygen, moisture, or the like and for high-efficiency blue light emission taking the application of the device to, for example, a full-color display into consideration.

Hereinafter, the device constitution of the organic EL device of the present invention will be described. The organic EL device of the present invention is a device obtained by forming an organic thin film layer formed of one or multiple layers between an anode and a cathode. When the device is of a one-layer type, a light emitting layer is provided between the anode and the cathode. The light emitting layer contains a light emitting material, and may further contain a hole injecting material for transporting a hole injected from the anode to the light emitting material or an electron injecting material for transporting an electron injected from the cathode to the light emitting material. However, the light emitting material is preferably as.follows: the material brings together extremely high fluorescent quantum efficiency, a high hole transporting ability, and a high electron transporting ability, and can be formed into a uniform thin film. A multi-layer type organic EL device is obtained by laminating multiple layers; the device is formed of an anode, a hole injecting layer, a light emitting layer, and a cathode, of an anode, a light emitting layer, an electron injecting layer, and a cathode, of an anode, a hole injecting layer, a light emitting layer, an electron injecting layer, and a cathode, or of an anode, a hole injecting layer, a hole transporting layer, a light emitting layer, an electron transporting layer, an electron injecting layer, and a cathode. The light emitting layer may further use a known light emitting material, doping material, hole injecting material, or electron injecting material in addition to the light emitting material represented by any one of the general formulae of the present invention as required. Any heavy metal complex typified by phosphorescent iridium as well as a conventional fluorescent material can be used as the doping material. Reductions in luminance and lifetime of the organic EL device due to quenching can be prevented by providing the device with a multi-layer structure. A light emitting material, any other doping material, a hole injecting material, and an electron injecting material can be used in combination as required. In addition, the other doping material can: improve the emission luminance and luminous efficiency of the device; and cause the device to emit red or white light.

At that time, in the case of the hole injecting layer, a layer that injects a hole from an electrode is referred to as a hole injecting layer, and a layer that receives the hole from the hole injecting layer and transports the hole to the light emitting layer is referred to as a hole transporting layer. Similarly, in the case of the electron injecting layer, a layer that injects an electron from an electrode is referred to as an electron injecting layer, and a layer that receives the electron from the electron injecting layer and transports the electron to the light emitting layer is referred to as an electron transporting layer. Each of those layers is selected and used depending on various factors such as the energy level of a material for the layer, the heat resistance of the layer, and the adhesiveness of the layer with the organic thin film layer or a metal electrode.

In addition, the above-mentioned substituents may be bound to each other to further form a six-membered aryl ring or a heterocyclic ring. At least one kind of a light emitting material, a doping material, a hole injecting material, and an electron injecting material may be present in the same layer of the organic thin film layer in the organic EL device of the present invention as the layer in which the anthracene derivative represented by any one of the general formulae of the present invention is present. Alternatively, the surface of the organic EL device obtained by the present invention can be provided with a protective layer, or the entirety of the device can be protected with, for example, a silicone oil or a resin in order that the stability of the device against a temperature, humidity, atmosphere, or the like may be improved. A material having a work function in excess of 4 eV is a suitable conductive material to be used in the anode of the organic EL device, and examples of the material to be used include: carbon, aluminum, vanadium; iron, cobalt, nickel, tungsten, silver, gold, platinum, and palladium, and alloys of them; metal oxides for use in an ITO substrate and an NESA substrate such as tin oxide and indium oxide; and organic conductive resins such as polythiophene and polypyrrole. A substance having a work function of less than 4 eV is a suitable conductive substance to be used in the cathode; and examples of the substance to be used include, but not limited to, magnesium, calcium, tin, lead, titanium, yttrium, lithium, ruthenium, manganese, and aluminum, and alloys of them. Representative examples of the alloys include, but not limited to, a magnesium/silver alloy, a magnesium/indium alloy, and a lithium/aluminum alloy. The compounding ratio of any such alloy is controlled depending on, for example, the temperature of a vapor deposition source, an atmosphere in which the alloy is formed, and the degree of vacuum of the atmosphere, and an appropriate ratio is selected for the alloy. Each of the anode and the cathode may be formed of two or more layers as required. At least one surface, that is, at least one of the anode and cathode, of the organic EL device is desirably transparent in the luminous wavelength region of the device to a sufficient extent in order that the device may emit light efficiently. In addition, the substrate of the device is also desirably transparent. A transparent electrode is set with any one of the above conductive materials by a method such as vapor deposition or sputtering in order that predetermined translucency may be secured. An electrode on the light emitting surface of the device desirably has a light transmittance of 10% ormore. The substrate is not limited as long as the substrate has a mechanical strength, a thermal strength, and transparency; a glass substrate and a transparent resin film are each a desirable substrate. Examples of the transparent resin film include polyethylene, an ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer, an ethylene-vinyl alcohol copolymer, polypropylene, polystyrene, polymethyl methacrylate, polyvinyl chloride, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl butyral, nylon, polyether ether ketone, polysulphone, polyether sulphone, a tetrafluoroethylene-perfluoroalkylvinylether copolymer, polyvinyl fluoride, a tetrafluoroethylene-ethylene copolymer, a tetrafluoroethylene-hexafluoropropylene copolymer, polychlorotrifluoroethylene, polyvinylidene fluoride, polyester, polycarbonate, polyurethane, polyimide, polyetherimide, polyimide, and polypropylene. Any one of dry film formation methods such as vacuum vapor deposition, sputtering, plasma, and ion plating and wet film formation methods such as spin coating, dipping, and flow coating is applicable to the formation of each layer of the organic EL device according to the present invention. The thickness of each layer is not particularly limited, but must be set to an appropriate thickness. When the thickness is excessively large, a large voltage must be applied in order that a certain optical output may be obtained, with the result that the efficiency with which the optical output is obtained deteriorates. When the thickness is excessively small, a pinhole or the like is produced, so sufficient emission luminance cannot be obtained even when an electric field is applied to the device. In ordinary cases, a thickness in the range of 5 nm to 10 µm is suitable; a thickness in the range of 10 nm to 0.2 µm is more preferable. In the case of a wet film formation method, a thin film is formed by dissolving or dispersing a material of which each layer is formed in an appropriate solvent such as ethanol, chloroform, tetrahydrofuran, or dioxane; any solvent is permitted as long as the material is soluble in the solvent. In addition, an appropriate resin or additive may be used in any layer of the organic thin film layer for the purposes of, for example, improving film formability and preventing a pinhole in a film. Examples of the resin that can be used include: insulating resins such as polystyrene, polycarbonate, polyallylate, polyester, polyamide, polyurethane, polysulfone, polymethyl methacrylate, polymethyl acrylate, and cellulose, and copolymers of them; photoconductive resins such as poly-N-vinylcarbazole and polysilane; and conductive resins such as polythiophene and polypyrrole. In addition, examples of the additive include an antioxidant, a UV absorber, and a plasticizer. The organic EL device of the present invention can be utilized in, for example, a flat light emitting body such as a flat panel display of a wall television, a light source for, for example, the backlight or meters of a copying machine, printer, or liquid crystal display, a display board, or an identification lamp. Examples Next, the present invention will be described in more detail by way of examples. However, the present invention is not limited to these examples.

In addition, comparison between each of those compounds of the present invention and Comparative Compound A (Comparative Example 1) reveals that the insertion of an arylene group between anthracene and dibenzofuran specifically improves the efficiency of an organic EL device using any one of the compounds of the present invention. Further, the insertion of an arylene group between anthracene and dibenzofuran or dibenzothiophene lengthens the lifetime of an organic EL device using any one of the compounds of the present invention. While the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of a compound based on the system of the present invention into which arylene has been inserted remain on anthracene and the arylene group directly bonded to anthracene, the HOMO and LUMO of a compound based on a system in which dibenzofuran is directly bonded to anthracene reach a dibenzofuranyl group. As a result, when an organic EL device using a compound based on the system in which dibenzofuran is directly bonded to anthracene is driven with a current, a dibenzofuranyl group contributes to the oxidation/reduction of the compound, so the substituent may decompose to shorten the lifetime of the device. In addition, comparison between Compound B (Comparative Example 2) and any one of the compounds of the present invention reveals that an organic EL device using any one of the compounds of the present invention has a longer lifetime than that of an organic EL device using Compound B. The following has been known: when an organic EL device using any one of those material systems is driven with a current, the compound is brought into an excited state, and anthracene and a substituent of anthracene change so as to adopt a planar structure. From this viewpoint, an excited state of a 1-naphthyl group is unstable owing to a short distance between anthracene and a hydrogen atom of the naphthyl group while an excited state of a phenyl group or 2-naphthyl group is stable. As a result, a 1-naphthyl group exerts a shortening effect on the lifetime of an organic EL device using a compound containing the 1-naphthyl group, and the effect appears remarkably in a compound based on the system of the present invention. Further, an organic EL device containing a dibenzofuran-based compound out of the compound group of the present invention has a particularly long lifetime. This is probably because dibenzofuran is more stable against oxidation/reduction than dibenzothiophene is. Examples 43 to 80 show that, when an electron transporting material capable of exerting its function at a low voltage is used, an organic EL device using a system having a diphenylanthracene skeleton out of the materials based on the system of the present invention specifically has high efficiency and a long lifetime. In addition, it is clear that the material of the present invention is a material capable of realizing the lengthening of the lifetime of an organic EL device specifically as compared to a compound disclosed in WO 2005/113531. As can be seen from the foregoing, the anthracene derivative of the present invention is useful as a material for an organic EL device because the derivative can realize higher efficiency and a longer lifetime than those realized by a material system that has been conventionally used. Industrial Applicability As described above in detail, an organic EL device using the anthracene derivative of the present invention as a material for an organic EL device has high luminous efficiency and a long lifetime. Accordingly, the device is extremely useful as an organic EL device with high practicality.
