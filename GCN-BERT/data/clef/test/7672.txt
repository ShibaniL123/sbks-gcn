BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates generally to training devices, and more particularly to athletic training devices. 2. Discussion of the Related Art Conventionally, various athletic training devices have existed but have various shortcomings. Early athletic ball games include Lacrosse played by native Americans, Jai-Alai a sport originating in northern Spain, as well as association football (soccer) formalized in the United Kingdom, involving kicking a ball into a goal, tracing its ancestry to Episkyros of Ancient Greece, and Harpastum of early Rome. Other ball-based sports may include field hockey, tennis, squash, handball, etc. Other sports may use a slightly different shaped ball including, e.g., but not limited to, a puck for ice hockey, and an oblong spheroid for American football, etc. Various other sports involve throwing or hitting a ball or other projectile, such as baseball, softball, shotput, javelin, etc. Sports generally have a given set of rules, and often require an athlete to develop eye-hand and/or eye-foot coordination to be successful. One illustrative example of a ball-based athletic sport, basketball, is an athletic or sports competition to determine which of two teams of one or players can place or throw a ball vertically down through a target hoop the most times with the opposing player or team trying to keep the ball from going through the hoop by blocking the player or interfering with the ball on its way to the hoop. Basketball was invented by Dr. James Naismith in 1891. The hoops in a basketball game are attached to a backboard and are generally located 10 feet above the floor in a horizontal position. Originally the hoop was a basket, hence the name, but today, the hoop is conventionally a resilient metal ring with a replaceable (often nylon or cotton) woven net. The primary object of basketball is to score by throwing the ball into the goal, officially called the “basket.” A basket is scored when the ball passes completely through the basket ring from above; however, the number of points scored with each basket can vary by distance from which the ball is thrown, and a team need not necessarily score the most baskets to win a game. A basket scored during normal play is called a field goal and is worth two points if shot from within or on the three-point line, and three points if shot from beyond the three-point line. The three point line's distance from the goal may vary by level of play (e.g., high school, college, professional, etc.). Points are automatically awarded to the shooting team if, while the ball is in its flight towards or is over the basket, the defending team illegally touches the ball or basket, known as goaltending or basket interference. An alternate method of scoring in basketball is the free throw, which scores one point. A free throw scores the same way as a field goal, except that it is taken unopposed from a free-throw line after a foul. Basketball scores are expressed in total points. The basket in basketball generally includes a metal hoop or ring 18 inches (46 cm) in internal diameter, suspended horizontally 10 feet (3.0 m) above the floor such that the center of the ring is equidistant from each sideline and 5 feet 3 inches (1.60 m) from the end line. The basket ring may have a net attached below to briefly check the ball's downward progress and indicate a score. The ring may be fastened to a generally rectangular backboard 6 feet (1.8 m) wide by 3.5 feet (1.1 m) tall, though in lower levels of play or recreational use the backboard may be smaller and/or fan-shaped. Conventionally, the entire structure may be supported from behind and anchored to the floor beyond the end line at higher levels of play; the structure may be anchored to a wall or ceiling at lower levels of play. The ring, net, and the front, top, bottom, and sides of the backboard may all be considered inbounds, while the back of the backboard and the support structure—even those parts suspended over inbounds areas of the court—may be considered out of bounds. Players have a better chance of placing the ball in the basketball hoop if they have physical attributes such as height and developmental attributes such as dexterity, and so-called good coordination. For example, good eye-hand coordination is helpful for a player as the player uses the player's eyes to judge distance and the player's arms and body to propel the ball with proper force and direction to go through the hoop. To improve eye hand coordination, a player may conventionally practice shooting the ball from a static position with feet stationary, or from a dynamic position where the player's feet and body are moving. Players are taught to use their bodies as well as hands and arms to help propel and direct the ball towards the hoop and in a game the players move their bodies to avoid and to get around the opposing players, which are trying to block the players and the ball. In practicing for a game, players spend a lot of time shooting the ball at the hoop, which is conventionally fixed and stationary. The hoop is conventionally fixedly mounted to a backboard and the backboard is generally fixed to a floor, wall or ceiling, or placed on a fixed platform. The players are always moving during a game as the players try to have a clear path of travel for the ball from the players' hands to the hoop and generally in practice players simulate the movements they would use in a game by putting their bodies in motion to improve their dynamic eye-hand coordination. The same kind of body movements players use in a game can be simulated by moving one's body in a dynamic way and shooting, but this may quickly become fatiguing. Various so-called “goal-only” sports exist, where the only method of scoring is the goal. Examples of goal-only sports include Association football (soccer), ice hockey, field hockey, handball, lacrosse, water polo, polo, etc. Various other sports (in addition to basketball) permit scoring other than by single points for a goal including Australian rules football (6 point goals), and Gaelic football and hurling. Sports with goals as secondary scoring include American and Canadian football, Arena football, and Rugby. Various conventional athletic training systems are known, but all fail to provide an optimal training experience simulating real world, in game variable movement, in a compressed training area. Conventional athletic training and systems have various shortcomings. What is needed is an improved system and method of providing athletic training that overcomes various shortcomings of conventional solutions.

FIG. 15 depicts an exemplary embodiment, of an exemplary sensing interface 1500 with an exemplary array of a plurality of exemplary sensors 1504, which may be coupled to a substrate or other sensor housing 1502, according to an exemplary embodiment. According to one exemplary embodiment an array of sensing regions may detect a ball coming into proximity to a particular portion of the sensor housing 1502, or sensors 1504. For example, an exemplary sensor 1504 may include a touch sensor, which similar to a key on a keyboard, or portion of a touchscreen, may detect contact with the sensor. As another exemplary sensor 1504, a light sensor may sense something coming into proximity of the light or color sensor, and the object (such as a ball), may cause generated light to be reflected from a light source, into the light sensor. Alternatively, an expected light source, which is then interfered with by an object, may be detected by a receiving sensor, which recognizes that an expected light signal is no longer being sensed (similar to a garage door light sensor, used to interrupt closing of a garage door on an infant, etc.). Other types of sensors such as, e.g., but not limited to, an ultrasonic sensor may be used to send off an ultrasonic sound wave, which may bounce off of a person or object (ball), and may via an ultrasonic transceiver/transducer, may identify the distance from the sensor of the person or object from which the ultrasonic sound wave may be bouncing off.

The depicted sensors are well known sensors available from LEGO Mindstorms and/or EV3 Robotics kits, and serve merely as examples of well known sensor technologies as may be integrated into an exemplary sensing device 1404, 1406, 1408, according to an exemplary embodiment. Exemplary touch sensor 1702 may include a touch actuator 1704, which when depressed and/or compressed, may cause the sensor 1702 to notify a coupled device that a touch has been sensed, according to an exemplary embodiment. Exemplary light sensor 1706 may include a passive device (not shown) which may detect light crossing a photoelectric cell such as, e.g., but not limited to, a Cadmium sensor, and/or may include an active device 1706 as shown, including a light source 1708, which may generate light, which may then reflect off of an exemplary surface, and may be reflected back into an exemplary light sensor 1710, which may detect the reflection of the light created by light source 1708. Exemplary color sensor 1712 may include an exemplary passive sensing device (not shown) which may detect colored light crossing a photoelectric cell such as a Cadmium sensor, or an electronic camera sensor, etc., and/or may include an active device 1712, 1718 as shown, including an exemplary light source 1714, 1720, respectively, which may generate light, which may then reflect off of an exemplary surface such as, e.g., but not limited to, an exterior of a ball, puck, projectile, etc., and may be reflected back into an exemplary color and/or light sensor 1716, 1722, respectively, which may detect the reflection of the light created by light source 1714, 1720. Exemplary ultrasonic sensor 1724 may include an exemplary passive sensing device (not shown) which may detect via an exemplary transceiver (receiver and/or transmitter) and/or transducer, etc., and/or may include an active device 1724 as shown, including an exemplary transceiver and/or transducer 1726 which may generate ultrasonic waves, which may then reflect off of an exemplary surface such as, e.g., but not limited to, a ball, etc., and/or may be reflected back into the receiver portion of the transceiver/transducer, which may detect the reflection of the ultrasonic wave in the sensor 1726. Various other well known exemplary sensors may be used without parting from the scope of the claimed inventions. FIG. 18 depicts exemplary sensor circuitry for an exemplary touch sensor circuit 1802, and/or an exemplary light sensor 1804 (potions of which may be used with an exemplary color sensor, and/or ultrasonic sensor, etc.), according to various exemplary embodiments. An example circuit 1802 as may be included within an exemplary touch sensor 1702 is illustrated in an exemplary schematic diagram of exemplary circuit 1802, which may include a contact switch, which according to an exemplary embodiment, may be held open with a spring and/or other biasing member, and may be, e.g., but not limited to, be coupled, and/or wired in series with an exemplary load resistor, e.g., 500 ohm resistor, etc., as shown, and may upon being touched, may close the circuit shown in 1802. The circuit 1802 may be closed by, e.g., but not limited to, upon the spring switch being compressed, according to an exemplary embodiment. An example touch sensor 1702 may detect whether the actuator 1704 of the sensor is being pressed, has been bumped, and/or has been released, according to an exemplary embodiment. The so-called brain and/or computer processor of the robotic device may upon actuation of the actuator 1704, may sense the closed switch 1802, and may upon such sensing may register that the actuation was sensed by logging, e.g., but not limited to, a time, and form of actuation sensed, etc. FIG. 18 also depicts an exemplary circuit 1804 illustrating an example circuitry 1804 for an example light sensor 1706. The example light sensor 1706 is a powered sensor, meaning the light sensor 1706 may require power to run its circuitry 1804. These example Lego sensors only have two wires connecting them, thus the two wires must be used both to send power to, and receive signals from, the sensor. Polarity can also be an issue given that connectors may allow sensors (input devices) (and motors (or other output devices)) to be attached in any one of four different orientations. These complications are handled by a combination of a special circuit comprised of a diode bridge (2, 3, 13) on the left side of circuit 1804, and a storage capacitor (10) and special software that rapidly switches between driving the circuitry and reading off the sensed values. The capacitor stores enough power so that the circuit may continue to function when the sensor 1706 is being read. The light sensor 1706 is said to be an active sensor in that it not only senses light using sensor 1710, but it also provides a source of light 1708, i.e., it does not rely passively on a source of light. Another example sensor may include, as discussed above with reference to FIG. 17, a color sensor 1712, which may in addition to sensing light similar to light sensor 1706, may also sense a range of reflected color, using color sensors 1716, and may also include a light source 1714, making it an active sensing device. Yet another example sensor, as discussed above with reference to FIG. 17, may include color sensor 1718, which may include light source 1720, and light/color sensor 1722. Another type of sensor, as discussed above with reference to FIG. 17, is an exemplary ultrasonic sensor 1724, (a transceiver or transducer) may use an ultrasonic sensor 1726 to generate an ultrasonic signal, which the sensor may also detect, which may be used to detect a given distance. can measure the distance from the sensor to something that it is facing, and detect movement. An example ultrasonic sensor can determine a distance such as, e.g., in centimeters, or inches. The maximum distance of an example Lego ultrasonic sensor can measure 233 cm with a precision of 3 centimeters. The ultrasonic sensor works by sending out ultrasonic sound waves that bounce off an object ahead of it and then back. The sensor senses the time it took for the ultrasonic wave to reflect. This example sensor is accurate at detecting flat surfaces. Various other sensors may also be used including, e.g., but not limited to, a location based sensor, a global positioning system (GPS), and/or a gyro sensor, etc. Various Exemplary Embodiments of an Exemplary Athletic Training System According to one exemplary embodiment, an exemplary backboard 1502 (see FIG. 15) with sensors 1504 can, in one exemplary embodiment include a hoop 1404 (e.g., as shown in FIG. 14), 1612 with sensors 1614 (see FIG. 16B). According to an exemplary embodiment, the exemplary sensors be coupled to exemplary indicators to visually indicate when the sensor senses contact or the close proximity of the ball. According to an exemplary embodiment, an exemplary sensor may include an exemplary integrated indicator(s) that may display, e.g., by light, etc., any sensors which were contacted, and may register and store any such exemplary contact, so as to record or store for late access or comparison, and/or for a longer time, up to permanently and may display, e.g., but not limited to, temporarily, an exemplary sensed area that may have been contacted along with any other exemplary relative information such as, e.g., but not limited to, impact pressure, velocity and/or angle of impact and/or number of impacts and/or score as an exemplary displayed alphanumeric character(s) or phrase, and/or other indicator such as, e.g., a chart and/or graph such as, e.g., but not limited to, a graph, a bar chart, a line chart, a pie chart, etc. According to an exemplary embodiment, the information may be displayed on a display associated with the device, and/or or may be pushed to be displayed on an exemplary other device, such as, e.g., but not limited to, an exemplary wearable device, such as, e.g., but not limited to, a wrist wearable device, a smartphone, a fitness band, a fitness bracelet, digital watch, smart watch, mobile device, Google Glass, head up display, smart glasses, etc. Exemplary information about an exemplary trajectory could also be captured, as well as, e.g., but not limited to, the motion of the player as they propel the object and/or projectile, and/or ball towards the target and/or goal. In one exemplary embodiment, an exemplary light, etc. may illuminate indicating a particular region, and may change when a change is sensed. For example, an exemplary strikezone of an exemplary baseball homeplate may be equipped with one or more illumination devices (e.g., light or laser beams), which according to an exemplary embodiment may illuminate an exemplary strike zone, e.g., but not limited to, in an exemplary particular light such as, e.g., red, using, e.g., but not limited to, color lasers, and may, e.g., but not limited to, when sensing a ball in any particular area of the strikezone, may so indicate using, e.g. but not limited to, a different color light, such as, e.g., a blue light, etc. In one exemplary embodiment, the ball may be equipped with one or more sensors, which may register whether any portion of the ball entered the exemplary illuminated strikezone, and may definitively confirm or overrule a called strike by an umpire in an exemplary baseball embodiment. According to another exemplary embodiment, exemplary lights, LEDs, and/or other indicators on, e.g., but not limited to, the backboard and/or goal can be used to indicate the exemplary intended objective in relation to the whole goal, according to an exemplary embodiment. So the exemplary indicated intended objective may, e.g., but not limited to, alternate between, e.g., corners, or the center or follow a progression of variable other exemplary locations to, e.g., test, not just the ability to hit the goal, but to also, more accurately hit a specific intended targeted area of the goal, that can be adjusted, and/or adjusted automatically, and/or via an exemplary selection, etc. According to another exemplary embodiment, an exemplary medical assessment may be provided, e.g., to provide an exemplary baseline for skills and to provide an exemplary means of assessment to determine effects of an athlete's injury and/or to, e.g., gauge the status of recovery from an injury, etc. According to an exemplary embodiment, aspects may also be used to assess other abilities, disabilities, and/or impairments, etc., that may be due to aging, drug use, other outside influence, etc. According to an exemplary embodiment, an exemplary robot can be mounted on a system of exemplary rails, and/or other motors, wheel(s), gear(s), belt(s), and/or chain(s), etc., -driven mobility enabler(s), and/or means of movement, so that the robot can dynamically move within an exemplary range of motion, and/or not always have to remain stationary in a specific location. According to an exemplary embodiment, an exemplary backboard could have flags that can, e.g., hang down, etc., that may wave as the goal moves to provide an indication of velocity and changes in velocity. According to an exemplary embodiment, various exemplary sizes of targets and goals may be provided. According to an exemplary embodiment, an addition feature enabling measuring of an exemplary impact and/or pressure forces a blocker can place on the exemplary robot such as, e.g., when they block in football. The exemplary device can have an exemplary padded portion coupled to the robot, with exemplary pressure sensors, among other possible sensors, and/or may provide an exemplary surface in place of the goal. According to an exemplary embodiment, the exemplary sensors may be used to measure an exemplary force exerted on the exemplary pad and/or on the different joints of the robot to determine how much force and the angles and duration of the force that can be applied by a given player. According to an exemplary embodiment, conventionally, the only way to measure player strength is by lifting various amounts of weight, but in this invention the robot would be able to provide custom measurements for each player and the measurements can be conducted, according to an exemplary embodiment, at different heights and angles, and can provide a complete body measure, instead of just parts as is done in weight lifting for an example leg press, and/or a bench press, etc. According to an exemplary embodiment, the exemplary robot can propel an exemplary ball, such as, e.g., but not limited to, an exemplary American football (e.g., oblong spheroid) with an exemplary spin by mounting a device on the robot, that can throw the football, i.e., creating a spin and/or spiral on the ball before it is released just as the combination of a human quarterback's arm, wrist, hand and fingers place a spin/spiral on a ball as it is thrown, enabling simulation of various throwing, allowing receivers to practice unaided by a human quarterback.
