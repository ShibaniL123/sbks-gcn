FIELD The technology described herein is generally related to a system and process for ophthalmic transfer of a therapeutic substance across a surface of an eyeball via iontophoresis. In some embodiments, the technology is related to buffering systems and methods that regulate pH of therapeutic substances during iontophoresis. BACKGROUND Ocular iontophoresis is the application of an electrical source to propel charged and/or active molecules from a reservoir into the intraocular tissues of a mammal, including a human or an animal. Positively charged ions can be driven into the ocular tissues by electro-repulsion at the anode while negatively charged ions are repelled from the cathode. The simplicity and safety of iontophoretic application includes enhanced targeted delivery of compound(s) of interest, and the reduction of adverse side effects have resulted in extensive use of iontophoresis in laboratory, clinical research and commercial use. Unlike ocular injections (intravitreal, retrobulbar, and peribulbar) and intraocular implants, iontophoresis is a noninvasive technique used to deliver compounds of interest into the anterior and/or posterior compartments of the eye. Iontophoretic delivery can be used to obtain intraocular concentrations and residence times that are equal to or greater than those achieved by conventional modalities such as topical drops, ointments, and gels. Iontophoresis has been widely used in dermal applications in which therapeutic compounds are transported across a patient's skin using electrical currents. Due to the relative high impedance of the skin, the electrical currents are generally relatively low. Consequently, dosage times tend to be relatively long, for example being greater than an hour. In such applications, iontophoresis can be applied to the patient's skin with an active drug-containing adhesive patch. Ocular iontophoresis devices are typically constituted by a direct current (DC) electric field source coupled to two electrodes, referred to respectively as “active” and “passive” electrodes. The active electrode provides an electromotive force, when energized, that acts on an electrolyte containing therapeutic composition(s) to transfer one or more therapeutic substance(s) across a surface of the eyeball, while the passive electrode serves as a return electrode and enables the electric circuit to be looped through the patient's body. The compound of interest is transported via the active electrode across the tissue when a current is applied to the electrodes through the tissue. Compound transport may occur as a result of a direct electrical field effect (e.g., electrophoresis), an indirect electrical field effect resulted from the bulk volume flow of solution from the anode to cathode (e.g., electroosmosis), electrically induced pore or transport pathway formation (e.g., electroporation), or a combination of any of the foregoing. Examples of currently known iontophoretic devices and methods for ocular drug delivery may be found in the U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,164,943; 6,697,668; 6,319,240; 6,539,251; 6,579,276; 6,697,668, and PCT publications WO 03/030989 and WO 03/043689, each of which is incorporated herein by reference. Ocular iontophoresis, however, presents several unique challenges. For example, the applicator must conform to the spheroidal geometry of the eyeball. That is, the portion of the applicator in contact with a surface of the eye must be specifically formed to minimize loss of therapeutic substance and to reduce discomfort. Also, since the electrical impedance of the eye is relatively lower than that of the epidermis, higher currents can be achieved at still reasonably low current densities. Accordingly, dosage times tend to be relatively short, often much less than one hour. SUMMARY Iontophoretic transfer of a therapeutic substance may result in unwanted changes in pH that result in patient discomfort, and in some instances, tissue damage. There remains a need to regulate the pH of a therapeutic preparation within the physiologically acceptable range during iontophoresis while maintaining the therapeutic substance at the highest ionization state for optimal delivery. Further, there remains a need to improve the delivery efficiency of a therapeutic substance while reducing the risks of any possible damage (e.g., irritation or burning of tissues) that could limit the use of ocular iontophoresis.

A buffer system is disposed at least partially within the at least one iontophoretic chamber. The buffer system is configured to regulate the pH of the therapeutic substance and to maintain the pH at the surface of the ocular globe within a range of about 3 to 8 during iontophoretic transfer of the therapeutic substance.

DEFINITIONS The terms ‘therapeutic substance’ and ‘active pharmaceutical ingredient (API)’ are used interchangeably throughout the specification, and by definition refer to a substance intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of a disease of the eye. Such substance is intended for use as a component of a medicine, and in some embodiments of this invention a component, part, or accessory of an iontophoresis device.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION As described herein, various embodiments of compositions, devices, methods of use and methods of manufacture for ophthalmic transfer of a therapeutic substance across a surface of an eyeball via iontophoresis are directed to achieve at least one (e.g., principle) objective of buffering the therapeutic substance to a biologically acceptable pH range during iontophoretic treatment. An additional objective of at least some of the various embodiments is to maximize electro-transport delivery of the therapeutic substance by maintaining the pH to achieve the highest ionization level of the therapeutic substance. Another benefit of maintaining the pH of the therapeutic substance is a consistent/predictable dose delivery. Yet another objective of at least some of the various embodiments is to increase the delivery of the therapeutic substance(s) to the eye by reducing the amount of competing ions, and to maintain the stability of the therapeutic substance(s) during iontophoretic treatment and storage. FIGS. 1A-1B show an exemplary single layer buffered reservoir ocular iontophoresis device 100 for buffering a therapeutic substance to a biologically acceptable pH range at the surface of an eyeball being treated during iontophoretic treatment. The ocular iontophoresis device 100 includes a distal end 110 and a proximal end 120. The distal end 110 defines a cavity 112 for receiving the therapeutic substance. The proximal end 120 defines an annular reservoir 122 (iontophoretic chamber) for delivering the therapeutic substance to the ocular area of the eyeball surface. The ocular area is typically a part of the sclera of the eyeball. An active electrode 130 is disposed between the distal end 110 and the proximal end 120; and is typically disposed at the beginning of the annular reservoir 122. In one embodiment, a buffer system 160 containing a buffering agent and/or the therapeutic substance can be disposed in the annular reservoir 122. In one embodiment, the therapeutic substance can be an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API). The addition of the buffering system 160 to the iontophoretic chamber 122 allows the iontophoresis device to self-buffer. A self-buffering iontophoresis device reduces the risk of damage to ocular tissue as a result of dramatic pH changes that can occur in a non-buffered system. The buffer system 160 is configured to provide a buffer action that maintains pH within the vicinity of a treatment surface 170, within a biocompatible range, during the duration of delivery of a dose. The treatment surface 170 is the area of the annular reservoir that contacts or is in close contact with the surface of the eyeball. The biocompatible range of pH for ocular delivery may depend upon the individual, but is generally within the range of about 3 to about 8. In a preferred embodiment, the biocompatible range of pH is maintained within a range of about 3 to about 7 throughout the duration of delivery. Even more preferably, the pH is maintained at a level equal to the highest ionization level of the therapeutic substance in order to enhance transport efficiency of the therapeutic substance. In some embodiments, the buffer system 160 can be electrically conductive medium capable of conducting an electric field supplied by the active electrode 130 to deliver the therapeutic substance. In other embodiments, the buffer system 160 can be disposed in electrical conductive medium. Additional exemplary embodiments of the buffer system 160 are further described below including a porous material, a buffered gel (liquid or solid), a packed bed resin (ion exchange resin), a hydrogel film or membrane, and combinations of any of these components. As described above, in one embodiment, the annular reservoir or iontophoretic chamber 122 includes a buffer system 160. The buffer system 160 includes a buffer medium having at least one buffer agent (composition) and a therapeutic substance, such as an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API). In some embodiments, the buffer medium includes one or more porous materials for containing a preparation (e.g., API, inactive ingredients, buffer, etc.). The API preparation may be a liquid solution preparation. The liquid solution preparation may include one or more therapeutic substances together with a buffering composition. At least one of the therapeutic substances may be dissolved in a liquid solution preparation. Likewise, the buffering composition may also include a soluble buffer composition. The porous material may be saturated with the liquid solution preparation. In such embodiments, the iontophoretic chamber 122 may contain a buffer medium and an API, each within the same porous material, such as, for example, foam, containing a solution preparation of the one or more therapeutic substances and buffer. In some embodiments, the API medium itself provides a buffering action sufficient to maintain pH at the point of contact between the device 100 and the eye within a preferred range, including any of the pH ranges described herein. The ability of an API to act as a buffering agent arises from its acid-base dissociation constants (pKa1, pKa2, etc.). The pKa distributions of drugs are influenced by the nature and frequency of occurrence of the functional groups that are commonly observed in pharmaceuticals and the typical range of pKa values they span. For instance, dexamethasone phosphate in its triprotic acid form exhibits two pKa values of 1.9 and 6.4. As a result, an aqueous solution of this compound at a dosing concentration of 40 mg/mL (pH 5.7) is capable of resisting to pH variations resulting from cathodal iontophoresis. FIGS. 2A-2B show a two layer buffered ocular iontophoresis device 200 for buffering a therapeutic substance to a biologically acceptable pH range at the surface of an eyeball being treated during iontophoretic treatment. In one embodiment, at least two layers 210, 220 are disposed in the annular reservoir or iontophoretic chamber 222, with at least one of the two layers including a buffering system 160. The buffer system 160 includes a buffer medium, which may be a first porous material of the first layer 210. The second layer 220 can include an API medium, which may be a second porous material for containing a therapeutic substance. In some embodiments, the buffer medium can be disposed in the second layer 220 and the API medium can be disposed in the first layer 210. In some embodiments, the first porous material of the first layer 210 can be positioned between the second porous material of the second layer 220 and the active electrode 130. As described above, the first porous material of the first layer 210 may be saturated with a preparation (such as a liquid solution preparation and/or a liquid colloidal preparation) containing a buffer composition or a buffer composition and at least one therapeutic substance. The second porous material of the second layer 210 may be saturated with a preparation (such as a liquid solution preparation and/or a liquid colloidal preparation) containing at least one therapeutic substance. In some embodiments, the iontophoretic chamber 222 contains (i) a buffer medium made of a first porous material (e.g., an open-cell foam) containing at least one buffer element (and may or may not include a therapeutic substance) and (ii) an API medium made of a second porous material, such as, for example, an open-cell foam, containing a solution preparation of one or more therapeutic substances. In some embodiments, the preparation may include pharmaceutically acceptable inactive ingredients for ophthalmic delivery. In some embodiments, one or both of the first porous material and the second porous material include a soluble buffer composition. In other embodiments, the first porous material and the second porous material are made of similar or different compositions. For example, the first porous material and the second porous material are made of different porous materials and/or are saturated with different preparations (in composition and/or concentration). The different preparations may include different elements, or the same elements in different concentrations.

In some embodiments, the first porous material and the second porous material can each include a respective buffer composition including at least one respective buffer element. For example, as discussed above, the first porous material (i.e., the porous material closest to the active electrode 130) and the second porous material may be loaded with respective buffer compositions as described above with respect to FIGS. 1A-2B. In some embodiments, the buffer system 160, 160′ contains (i) a buffer medium including a first porous material (e.g., foam) and a second porous material, each containing at least one respective buffer element, and optionally containing at least one therapeutic substance, and (ii) a reservoir medium including a third porous material, such as, for example, foam, containing a solution preparation of the one or more therapeutic substances. In some embodiments, the first porous material and the second porous material may differ in buffer composition and/or concentration of the same buffer. The first porous material and the second porous material may be made of different porous materials. In further embodiments, the third porous material may also include a buffer composition that is weaker, for example, than that of the first porous material and the second porous material. In some embodiments, the first porous material, the second porous material, and the third porous material may be made of similar or different compositions. It should be noted that any number of porous materials may be included within the buffer system. In some embodiments, the first porous material may contain a buffer composition and the second porous material may contain an ionic composition that optimizes electro-transport of the therapeutic substance in the third porous material.

In this instance, the buffering membrane 430 may be a mono-laminar, a multi-laminar film, or hydrophobic (semi permeable) membrane in nature to retain the water content of the first layer 410 for stability. In some embodiments, a mono-laminar or a multi-laminar ion-exchange film or membrane may be placed in the iontophoretic chamber 422 in contact or approximately near the active electrode 130.

Porous materials provided in various embodiments, such as any of those described above, can include an open cell porous material. Such an open cell porous material may include, but not be limited to, foam, fabric, nonwoven material, and/or sintered material that contain a buffer in at least one of its components. In other embodiments, the porous material is made of, but is not limited to polyethylene, polyurethane, polypropylene, PTFE, PVDF, EVA, nylon, ceramic, and the like.

In some embodiments, the buffer composition may be a plurality of insoluble buffer substance particles of polymeric or non-polymeric nature. The particles may have regular shapes (e.g., round, spherical, cube, cylinder, fiber, cone, needle, and the like), irregular shapes, or combinations of regular and irregular shapes. In some embodiments, the membrane is made of any material that has buffering capabilities. The membrane may be made of, but is not limited to, for example, amino methacrylate copolymer, methacrylic acid copolymers (Type A and B), HPMCAS (hydroxypropyl methylcellulose acetate succinate), CAP (cellulose acetate phthalate) and the like. The membrane may be made of, but is not limited to, anion exchange resins and cation exchange resins, either of which may be characterized by having a strong acid, strong base, weak acid, and weak base.

In some embodiments, the buffering medium may include a buffering element or agent (or a composition having a buffering agent), such as, but not limited to a polymeric buffering agent. The polymeric buffering agent may be suitable for regulating the pH of a preparation containing the therapeutic substance (i.e., drug preparation) within a given pH range during iontophoresis. The polymeric buffering agent may be any polymer that ionizes at a given pH by consuming hydrogen ions or hydroxyl ions and maintains a pH of the preparation in the iontophoretic chamber within a desired range. In some embodiments, the buffering agent may be a polymeric buffer that cannot pass through the buffer medium of the device to the therapeutic medium containing the therapeutic substance in the iontophoretic chamber. Because of the large molecular size of the polymeric buffer, an ionized polymeric buffering agent has low ionic mobility and does not significantly compete with the preparation containing the therapeutic substance or fluid ions for carrying electric charge. Therefore, the polymeric buffering agent does not decrease compound delivery efficiency. In some embodiments, the polymeric buffering agent may have a molecular weight sufficiently high to prevent passage of the polymeric buffering agent to the eyeball surface. The polymeric buffering agent may be water soluble or water insoluble. For example, in one embodiment, the polymeric buffering agent may be a water insoluble polymeric buffer in a form of fine particles to maximize its surface area. Furthermore, the buffer medium may include small particles of the polymeric buffering agent suspended in a hydrogel membrane. In other embodiments, the water insoluble polymeric buffering agent may be formed into a porous polymer membrane that may cover the active electrode and/or the internal wall of the iontophoretic chamber and/or the porous material. The porous polymer membrane may also be used as a semi-permeable membrane. In some embodiments, the polymeric buffering agent may be an ion exchange resin that may be selected from, but not limited to, the following group: methacrylic acid/divinylbenzene copolymers and styrene/divinylbenzene copolymers, and the like. Methacrylic acid/divinylbenzene polymers have weak acid (carboxyl group) functionality and are available in hydrogen or potassium form. Styrene/divinylbenzene polymers have either strong acid (sulfonate group) or strong base (tertiary amine group) functionality. The former resins may be available in hydrogen, sodium or calcium form and the latter resins may be available in chloride form. The ion exchange resins are commercially available in a powder, granular, or fiber form, or as a membrane, or the like. In some embodiments, the buffer composition may include an amino acid buffer or a combination of amino acids with cationic behavior. Amino acids with cationic behavior are positively charged and may be used for cathodic iontophoresis. In such embodiments, the electrotransport of buffer cations through the eye can be reduced or eliminated. A poorly transported buffer may help to avoid depletion of the buffer composition from the iontophoretic chamber as well as any irritation associated with buffer cations being transported into the eye tissues. In other embodiments, the cathodic iontophoresis may be buffered using an anionic or negatively charged acid buffer. In further embodiments, mixtures of a cationic amino acid buffer and an anionic acid buffer may also be used. Concentration of the buffer composition required in the cathodic reservoir may depend, for example, on the properties of a specific buffer selected. Cationic amino acids may be selected from (but not limited to) the following group: arginine, aspartic acid, cysteine, glutamic acid, histidine, lysine, and tyrosine. Anionic acids may be selected from (but not limited to) the following group: acetic acid, adipic acid, aspartic acid, benzoic acid, citric acid, ethylenediamine tetracetic acid, formic acid, fumaric acid, glutamic acid, glutaric acid, maleic acid, malic acid, malonic acid, phosphoric acid, and succinic acid. In some embodiments, the buffer composition may include an amino acid buffer or a combination of amino acids with anionic behavior. Amino acids with anionic behavior are negatively charged and may be used for anodic iontophoresis. In some embodiments buffers may include zwitterions. In some embodiments, the anodic iontophoresis may be buffered using an anionic acid. In such embodiments, competition between the anodic buffer and the therapeutic substance (i.e., the drug formulation) for delivery into the eyeball may be reduced or eliminated. In other embodiments, the anodic iontophoresis may be buffered using a cationic or positively charged base buffer, or an amino acid displaying cationic behavior at the reservoir pH. In further embodiments, mixtures of an anionic acid buffer and a cationic base or amino acid buffer may also be used. Concentration of buffer composition required in the anodic reservoir depends on the properties of a specific buffer selected.

Anionic acid buffers may be selected from (but are not limited to) the following group: acetic acid, adipic acid, benzoic acid, carbonic acid, citric acid, ethylenediamine tetracetic acid, fumaric acid, glutamic acid, lactic acid, maleic acid, malic acid, malonic acid, phosphoric acid, tartaric acid, and succinic acid. Cationic bases and amino acids may be selected from (but are not limited to) the following group: arginine, histidine, imidazole, lysine, triethanolamine, and tromethamine. In some embodiments, the buffer composition may be a cross-linked polymer or a combination of polymers with anionic or cationic behavior. Although not necessarily so limited, the polymeric buffers used in the cathodic iontophoresis may be those displaying anionic behavior whereas the polymeric buffers used in the anodic iontophoresis may be those displaying cationic behavior. The use of polymeric buffers eliminates or minimizes competition from buffer ions and/or counter ions, for example, with the therapeutic substance for delivery to the eyeball. In some embodiments, the buffer composition may be a polymer or a combination of polymers with anionic or cationic behavior. Although not necessarily so limited, the polymeric buffers used in the cathodic iontophoresis may be those displaying anionic behavior whereas the polymeric buffers used in the anodic iontophoresis may be those displaying cationic behavior. The use of polymeric buffers eliminates or minimizes competition from buffer ions and or counter ions, for example, with the therapeutic substance for delivery to the eyeball. The anionic polymer may be selected from (but is not limited to) the following group: poly(acrylic acid), poly(acrylic acid) cross-linked with polyalkenyl ethers or divinyl glycol, poly(methacrylic acid), styrene/maleic anhydride copolymers, methyl vinyl ether/maleic anhydride copolymers, poly(vinyl acetate phthalate), cellulose acetate phthalate, cellulose acetate trimellitate, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose acetate succinate, ethyl acrylate/methacrylic acid copolymers, methyl methacrylate/methacrylic acid copolymers, and alginic acid, and the like. The cationic polymer may be selected from (but is not limited to) the following group: polyvinylpyridine, methyl methacrylate/butyl methacrylate/dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate terpolymers, vinylpyrrolidone/quaternized dimethyl aminoethyl methacrylate copolymers, vinylcaprolactam/vinylpyrrolidone/dimethyl aminoethyl methacrylate terpolymers, and chitosan, and the like. In some embodiments, the buffer composition may be a low molecular weight compound with anionic or cationic behavior. Although not necessarily so limited, the buffers used in the cathodic iontophoresis may be those displaying anionic behavior whereas the buffers used in the anodic iontophoresis may be those displaying cationic behavior. Examples of this type of buffer can include, but are not limited to, sodium/potassium acetate, sodium/potassium citrate, and/or all of the “Good's buffers,” which includes MES, ADA, PIPES, ACES, BES, TES, HEPES, cholamine chloride, acetomidoglycine, tricine, glycinamide, and bicine. In various embodiments, at least one buffer element or agent may be incorporated into the buffer medium through (i) chemical bonding (e.g., the buffer agent may be covalently bonded to the buffer medium); (ii) physical bonding (e.g., an electrostatic charge of buffer binds it to the buffer medium); (iii) mechanical bonding (e.g., a size of the buffer material may be larger than a pore size of the buffer medium, thus trapping the buffer material in the reservoir); (iv) coating (e.g., the buffer medium may be coated with buffered material); (v) emulsion (e.g., a liquid buffer may be suspended in a liquid reservoir); and (vi) solid suspension (e.g., a buffer is suspended in a solid reservoir). In various embodiments, the addition of many of the above described buffer mediums and/or buffer compositions may reduce available space of a therapeutic reservoir medium used to house the therapeutic substance (or active pharmaceutical ingredient (API)) containing preparation. As a result, an overall volume needed to fill the API medium may be reduced. For example, an approximately 3-mm thick gel/membrane buffer system may result in an overall reduction of needed API containing solution by at least half. Each 1 mm of porous material replaced by a gel/membrane buffer system from the iontophoretic chamber may result in a 16% reduction in API containing solution needed to fill the API medium. As another example, an iontophoretic chamber having a foam insert (API medium) of approximately 1-2 mm requires only 100-300 μL of API containing solution. A secondary result of the additional buffer mediums is that the distance of the active electrode is extended from the ocular surface creating and added safety benefit.
