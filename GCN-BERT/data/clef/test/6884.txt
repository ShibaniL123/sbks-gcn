This invention relates to an improved transport stretcher and is designed for the purpose of providing a stretcher combining rigidity and resiliency, also comfort and ventilation, and when necessary warmth to the patient. The invention consists of a wooden under-frame provided with wheels, to the sides of the frame are fitted spiral compression springs supporting an upper frame to which are attached boards forming the bed of the stretcher. On to the sides of tbo upper frame are pivotally connected collapsible curtain frames, and on to one end of the said frame double hinged collapsible curtain supports and on to the end of the frame an adjustable hinged foot board. Curtains are attached to the sides and head of the frame adapted to roll up and be fastened by straps; when unrolled they are stretched over the curtain frames. In order that the invention may be easily understood reference is now made to the accompanying drawings in which : Figure 1 is a perspective view of the stretcher out of commission. lgure 2, perspective view showing the curtain frames erected. Figure 3, perspective view showing the curtain frames erected, the end curtains stretched over the end frames, the head curtain stretched over the head supports and three of the curtains stretched out prior to same being attached to the frames. The reference letters serve to indicate corresponding parts in all figures. A is the under-frame attached to which are wheels B, C is the upper frame supported on the lower frame by spiral springs D providing resiliency to the upper frame. E are collapsible frames pivotally attached to the sides of tbc frame C and held in upright position by hinged stops F, G are double hinged supports which can be folded up as shown in Figure 1, one of which rests upon a bearer block H to which it is hinged. I is the floor of the stretcher on which rests a suitable mattress and pillow kept in place by the raised sides of the upper frame and by a strap J. prise: ONE RUPEE,, K is a hinged foot board which may be adjusted to any angle by straps L or laid flat upon the floor of the stretcher when not in use. M are the side curtains and N the head curtain, these when not in use are rolled up and fastened by straps as shown in Figure 1, the side curtains are provided with pockets Q for holding hot water bags; the curtains can be fastened together by snap buttons and the whole stretcher thoroughly closed in, the patient being free from the public gaze. R a e handles for carrying the stretcher but telescopic handles as ordinarily u ed with stretchers may be employed. Minor modifications may be resorted to without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention. In using this stretcher more especially in out-back country districts, make shifts are avoided, such as a door or fence palings to provide for a rigid bed for the mattress, which when used eliminates resiliency, also dispensing with projecting handles which assists in moving the stretcher in restricted areas; ventilation can also be obtained when desirable by rolling up any of the curtains. 1. In an improved transport stretcher, an npper frame provided with a rigid bed supported by spiral springs on an under-frame provided with wheels as herein described and illustrated by drawings. 2. In an improved transport stretcher, as characterized in Claim 1 in combination with collapsible side curtain frames, means for holding same upright, double hinged head supports, folding curtains attached to the upper frame avd adapted to stretch over the side frames and head supports, straps for fastening the rolled up curtains and a strap for fastening the mattress and pillow to the bed as herein described and illustrated by drawings. 3. In an improved transport stretcher as characterized in Claims 1 and 2, handles attached to the lower frame for carrying same as herein described and i]lustrated by drawings. 4.
