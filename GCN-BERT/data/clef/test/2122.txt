Technical Field The present invention belongs to the technical field of production of electrolytic copper foils, and more particularly relates to a method and system for producing an electrolytic copper foil by the reverse flow of a copper sulfate solution. A bottom-feed flow of the copper sulfate solution in traditional anode cells is changed into a top-feed flow and the quality of the copper foil is controlled by changing the direction and flow rates of the copper sulfate solution, thus bringing unexpected good effect for the production of copper foils and completely breaking away from the history that the quality of the copper foil can be controlled by additives only. Background Art At present, lead anodes that are not environmental-friendly and easy to be corroded have been excluded in the production of electrolytic copper foils, and have been replaced with titanium iridium anodes which have conductive surface coatings. However, either the lead anodes or the titanium iridium anodes are used, the production processes thereof are not changed substantially. The copper sulfate solution in an anode cell is always fed from the bottom of the anode cell, overflowed out of the upper ports of the anode cell and returned to copper dissolving tanks. Copper foil production in the conventional production equipment and processes is as follows: a cathode drum with a surface roughness Ra less than 0.4 µm is soaked below its axis in an anode cell to which a copper sulfate solution is fed with a copper content of 70-110 g/L, an acid content of 80-130 g/L and the temperature of 40-65°C. Electric current is fed between the cathode drum and the anodes. The part of the cathode drum soaked in the copper sulfate solution is plated with the copper crystals according to the electrochemical principle. According to the electrodepositing constant: 1.186 g/A-h, the thickness of the copper foil plated on the surface of the cathode drum depends on the electrodepositing time and current density of the cathode drum in the copper sulfate solution. The thickness of the copper foil plated on the surface of the cathode drum can be changed by changing the rotating speeds of the cathode drum. The copper foils of different thicknesses can be obtained by continuously peeling off the copper foil plated on the surface of the cathode drum as the cathode drum rotates. The side of the copper foil against on the surface of the cathode drum is called the shiny side, and the other surface is called the matte side. Due to the polarization effect in the electrodepositing process, copper textures with irregularly mountain peaks will be produced on the matte side of the copper foil. Thicker copper foils have larger copper grains and higher roughnesses on the matte sides. The roughness Rz on the matte side of the copper foil is controlled through a method of adding additives (gelatin or modified gelatin, thiourea etc.) in the production processes. The complicate production processes are extremely difficult to control which are also the bottleneck of the copper foil production. They are also confidential proprietary processes for many copper foil manufacturing plants. And meanwhile, large amount of additives are added to the copper sulfate solution, so when the copper sulfate solution returned back to the copper dissolving tanks, the abovementioned additives need to be removed and several filtration devices are required to improve the quality of the copper sulfate solution which increase the burden of the filters. Since oxygen evolution takes place in the process of electrodepositing copper foils onto the cathode drum, large amount of bubbles are produced which can also affect electrodepositing results. Because the copper sulfate solution flows upwards, bubbles are removed from the upper ports of the anode cell by the copper sulfate solution to form acid mists, which oxidize copper foil surfaces just peeled off from the cathode drum. To solve such a problem, exhaust openings with high flow rates are arranged at the top of the anode cell, making the production equipment of the copper foil complicated and difficult to control. Ever since electrolytic copper foils were commercialized by Yates in 1955, their production processes have never been changed substantially;i.e., they have been always produced in a mode of bottom solution feeding and upper overflowing. This mode is mainly used to maintain the concentrations of copper ions and additives. The fluid mechanics problems in the cell have never been solved. No matter whether an overhead tank or an acid-resistant pump is used to supply the copper sulfate solution in copper foil electrodeposition, the flow rate is generally below 0.5 meters per second. The resulting copper foil textures are columnar structure. Although the textures and the physical properties of the copper foi can be changed with brightening additives at ambient, they are very unstable at high temperatures. Their tensile strengths attenuate considerably. Brightners generate many lattice defects, pinholes and curls. Such copper foils are not suitable for manufacturing high-grade circuit boards and lithium ion batteries. In the process of copper foil electrolysis, copper atoms are deposited on cathode surface, and oxygen bubbles are generated on anode surface and are brought to the liquid surface by the bottom feed solution. Since acid mist produced together with copper sulfate harm both the surface of the copper foil and operators, it is necessary to maintain the cleanness of workshops with powerful exhaust equipment. The bottom feed solution produces turbulent flow near the solution inlet, and its Reynolds number is far beyond 2000. Although a lot of manufacturers make great efforts on the design of feed pipes, they still cannot solve the phenomenon of uneven thickness profile. Thickness adjustment must rely upon a solution feeding valves and piano shield plates, and yet this adjustment method is only temporary and quite unstable, and also adjustment has to be done every one or two days. The piano shield plates can only be used once or twice and its expense is terribly high. This is particularly a big headache for the continuous production. There are two types of bottom feed solutions, i.e. closed type and open type. The former is a 100% new solution, the latter consists of a new solution and an old solution simultaneously. In either way, the solution flow of anode between the left and the right side of the anode gap cannot be accurately controlled. It can only be assumed that half of the feed solutions flow on each side. The controllability of each flow on either side is very low. The most prominent shortcoming of the bottom feed solution is that copper ions and additive concentration on the liquid surface at the anode cell are old electrolyzed solutions with low concentrations, A lot of bubbles accumulate on the liquid surface which result in larger resistance on the liquid surface. When both factors are merged, the current density on the liquid surface is lower than that below the liquid surface. This phenomenon is unfavorable for the formation of crystal nuclei when the cathode drum enters the liquid surface. In severe cases, this is a major factor that leads to copper foil curl and pinholes. Summery of the Invention The objective of the present invention is to provide, on the basis of the abovementioned problems, a technical solution, which involves a method and system for producing an electrolytic copper foil by the reverse flow of a copper sulfate solution. A bottom-feed solution flow of the copper sulfate solution in traditional anode cells is changed into a top-feed solution flow with increasing flow rates. It brings unexpected good effects for the production of copper foils and completely breaking away from the history that the quality of the copper foil can be controlled by additives only.

A further optimized solution is that: the copper sulfate solution is a mixture of a primary copper sulfate solution and a secondary copper sulfate solution, the primary copper sulfate solution is a source copper sulfate solution directly provided by a copper dissolving tank, and the secondary copper sulfate solution is an electroplated copper sulfate solution that flows out via the anode cell. A further optimized solution is that: the ratio of the primary copper sulfate solution to the secondary copper sulfate solution in the mixture is not less than 1:2. A system for implementing the method for producing an electrolytic copper foil by the reverse flow of a copper sulfate solution, comprises a cathode drum, semicircular arc-shaped anodes and copper dissolving tanks.

The production process of the present invention decreases the discharge of pollutants, is ial to environmental friendly, and has significant economic and social benefits. The present invention will be described below in details in conjunction with the accompanying drawings and embodiments. Summery of the Invention The paragraph of Technical Field is given here. Brief Description of the Drawings Fig. 1 is a schematic flow diagram of the production process of the present invention; Fig. 2 is a structure diagram of the system of the present invention; Fig. 3 is a structure diagram of the copper sulfate solution feed diversion port at the upper end of the anode cell of the present invention. Detailed Description of the Embodiments Embodiment 1: Referring to Fig. 1, shown is an embodiment of a method for producing an electrolytic copper foil by the reverse flow of a copper sulfate solution, including an anode cell 3 formed by a gap arranged between a cathode drum 1 and curved semicircular arc-shaped anodes 2, the gap between the anode and the cathode drum is usually kept between 8mm to 15mm, the upper ports at two sides of the anode cell are located at two sides of the cathode drum (i.e., two side surfaces of the cathode drum which are vertically separated along a central axis), with one side being a foil exit side. A flowing copper sulfate solution 4 is in the anode cell, the cathode drum rotates in the anode cell, and the outer surface of the cathode drum below its axis is soaked in the anode cell to which the copper sulfate solution having a copper content of 70-110 g/L and an acid content of 80-130 g/L and the temperature of 40-65°C is added. An electric current is fed between the cathode drum and the anode. As the cathode drum rotates, a copper foil 5 electroplated on the cathode drum is continuously peeled off and wound up by a wind-up roll 7 via a stripper roller 6 by means of electrochemical reaction. Wherein the copper sulfate solution is at least fed into the anode cell from the upper port of the anode cell on one side surface of the cathode drum, such that the copper sulfate solution forms a downward flow impulsive force (that is, a certain flow impulse force, which is opposite to a direction in which the copper sulfate solution produces bubbles and which takes away the bubbles downwards, is formed) on the inflow side surface of the cathode drum. The preferred solution 1 of this embodiment is that: the upper port of the anode cell on one side surface is the upper port of the anode cell at the foil exit side of the cathode drum. That is: the copper sulfate solution is fed into the anode cell from the upper port 3-1 of the anode cell at the foil exit side of the cathode drum. The preferred solution 2 of this embodiment is that: since the copper sulfate solution at least flows into the anode cell from the upper port of the anode cell on one side of the cathode drum, the copper sulfate solution can flow out of the anode cell either from the bottom of the anode cell or from the upper port of the anode cell on the other side of the cathode drum. In order to overcome the situation in which during the process of electrodepositing the copper ions in the copper sulfate solution onto the cathode drum, large amount of bubbles generated due to oxygen evolution are discharged from the upper ports of the anode cell, this preferred solution differs from the abovementioned solution is that the copper sulfate solution is fed into the anode cell from the upper ports of the anode cell on two side surfaces of the cathode drum and flows out from the bottom of the anode cell, and the copper sulfate solution that flows out entrains the bubbles generated by electroplating from the bottom of the anode cell. The bubbles are rapidly taken away by the copper sulfate solution that rapidly flows downwardly, thereby reducing and even eliminating the impact of these bubbles on the electrodeposited copper foil. In the abovementioned solution, a further method comprises: when the surface roughness of of the copper foil is more than a set value, increasing the speed of the copper sulfate solution flowing out from the bottom of the anode cell, that is, increasing the flow rate of the copper sulfate solution on the surface of the cathode drum; and when the surface roughness of the copper foil is less than the set value, decreasing the speed of the copper sulfate solution flowing out from the bottom of the anode cell, that is, decreasing the flow rate of the copper sulfate solution on the surface of the cathode drum. The set value of the surface roughness of the copper foil, i.e. the Rz roughness on a matte side, is typically controlled to be less than 2.5 µm according to different requirements of different products. In the abovementioned solution, in order to improve the polarization effect in the electrodepositing process, solve the impact of the bubbles on the quality of the copper foil and improve the roughness on the surface of the copper foil and the density of copper foil crystal grains, under the process conditions of production of the electrolytic copper foil, the flow rate of the copper sulfate solution formed on the surface of the cathode drum is at least 0.5 m/s and typically within a range from 0.5 to 0.9 m/s; the process conditions of production of the electrolytic copper foil comprise that: the copper content of the copper sulfate solution is 70-110 g/L, the acid content is 80-130 g/L, the temperature is 40-65°C, and the anodic current density is 50-85 amperes per square decimeter. Wherein, when the anodic current density is 70 amperes per square decimeter, it is preferable for the flow rate of the copper sulfate solution to be controlled at 0.7 m/s, so that the bubbles generated are taken away quickly. And in the conventional processing methods, the copper sulfate solution in the anode cell is fed from the bottom and overflowed from the top, which keeps the flow rate of the copper sulfate solution formed on the surface of the cathode drum below 0.5 m/s all the time; if the flow rate is more than 0.5 m/s, a large amount of sulfuric acid mists will be taken out from the upper ports of the anode cell and the copper sulfate solution will flow out of the anode cell to produce a series of problems, thus upward adjustment is infeasible; and in this embodiment, the flow rate of the copper sulfate solution formed on the surface of the cathode drum can be at least 0.5 m/s by changing the flow direction of the copper sulfate solution in the anode cell, and the surface roughness of the copper foil is controlled by controlling the flow rate of the copper sulfate solution on the surface of the cathode drum. When the surface roughness of the copper foil is more than the set value, the speed of the copper sulfate solution flowing out of the anode cell is increased, that is, the flow rate of the copper sulfate solution is increased; and when the surface roughness of the copper foil is less than the set value, the speed of the copper sulfate solution flowing out from the bottom of the anode cell is decreased, that is, the flow rate of the copper sulfate solution is decreased; the set value of the surface roughness of the copper foil, i.e. the Rz roughness on a matte side is typically controlled to be less than 2.5 µm according to different requirements of different products.

In the abovementioned embodiments, the demand on the source copper sulfate solution is raised in order to increase the flow rate of the copper sulfate solution formed on the surface of the cathode drum, which certainly will increase the demand on copper dissolving tanks to result in an increase in equipment investment. To address this issue, in this embodiment, the copper sulfate solution is a mixture of a primary copper sulfate solution and a secondary copper sulfate solution, the primary copper sulfate solution is a source copper sulfate solution directly provided by the copper dissolving tanks, and the secondary copper sulfate solution is an electroplated copper sulfate solution that flows out via the anode cell. Wherein, in order to keep the effect of the original process unaffected by variation of the copper content in the copper sulfate solution, the ratio of the primary copper sulfate solution to the secondary copper sulfate solution in the mixture in this embodiment is not less than 1:2, and the ratio of 7:3 is an optimum ratio, i.e., in 100% copper sulfate solution, the primary copper sulfate solution accounts for 70% and the secondary copper sulfate solution accounts for 30%.
