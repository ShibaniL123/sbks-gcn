Step 2
The compound 66 (830 mg, 2.75 mmol) was dissolved in acetic acid (6.64 mL). 4,5-dimethoxy-2-methylaniline (2.30 g, 13.7 mmol) was added to the solution. The mixture was stirred at 100Â°C for 3 hours. Water was added to the reaction mixture. The mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed by brine, and dried over sodium sulfate. The solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure. The obtained residue was solidified with ethyl acetate to give the compound I-1281 (450 mg, yield 40%).
