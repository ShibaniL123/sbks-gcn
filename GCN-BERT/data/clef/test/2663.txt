Intermediate 8: (±)-4-{[(1R*,3R*)-3-hydroxycyclopentyl]amino}-2-(methylsulfanyl)-pyrimidine-5-carbaldehyde
To a cooled (0° C.) solution of (±)-trans-(3-hydroxy-cyclopentyl)-carbamic acid tert-butyl ester (2.03 g, 10.1 mmol) [Kulagowski, J. J. et al. J. Med. Chem. 2012 55, 5901] in 1,4-dioxane (20 mL) was added HCl (4.0 mL solution in 1,4-dioxane, 20 mL, 80 mmol), and the mixture stirred at 0° C. for 1 h and at room temperature for 3 h. The solvents were evaporated, the residue dissolved DCM (50 mL), and a solution of NaOH (502.2 mg, 12.6 mmol) in water (1.5 mL) was added. After stirring at room temperature for 1 h, the reaction mixture was dried over a mixture of anhydrous sodium carbonate and anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated to give (±)-trans-(3-hydroxy-cyclopentyl amine (8a, 0.68 g, 67%) as an amber liquid, which was used without further purification in the following reaction.
