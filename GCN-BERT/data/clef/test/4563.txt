Preparation of: rac-trans-1-(4-bromophenyl)-3-(4-(2,6-difluoro-4-methoxyphenyl)piperidin-3-yl)urea (Example 8) and rac-trans-1-(1-acetyl-4-(2,6-difluoro-4-methoxyphenyl)piperidin-3-yl)-3-(4-bromophenyl)urea (Example 34)
To a stirred solution of rac-trans-1-(3-amino-4-(2,6-difluoro-4-methoxyphenyl)piperidin-1-yl)ethanone hydrochloride (0.25 g, 0.78 mmol, 1 eq) [synthesis described in synthesis of Example 5] in DCM (15 mL) was added Et3N (0.2 mL, 1.2 mmol, 1.5 eq) followed by 4-bromophenylisocyanate (0.15 g, 0.78 mmol, 1 eq) at 0° C. and stirred for 2 h at RT. The reaction was quenched with H2O and organics were extracted with DCM (2×20 mL), washed with brine (15 mL), dried over Na2SO4 and concentrated in vacuo. The crude product was purified by column chromatography (Neutral alumina, 3% MeOH in DCM) to afford Example 34 (0.2 g, 53%) as white solid.
