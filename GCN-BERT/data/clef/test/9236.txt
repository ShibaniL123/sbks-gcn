COMPOUNDS THAT MODULATE INTRACELLULAR CALCIUM CROSS-RELERENCE [0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. provisional application No. 61/377,842, filed August 27, 2010, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety. FIELD OF THE INVENTION [0002] Described herein are compounds, pharmaceutical compositions and medicaments that include such compounds, and methods of using such compounds to modulate store-operated calcium (SOC) channel activity. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0003] Calcium plays a vital role in cell function and survival. For example, calcium is a key element in the transduction of signals into and within cells. Cellular responses to growth factors, neurotransmitters, hormones and a variety of other signal molecules are initiated through calcium-dependent processes. [0004] Virtually all cell types depend in some manner upon the generation of cytoplasmic Ca2+ signals to regulate cell function, or to trigger specific responses. Cytosolic Ca2+ signals control a wide array of cellular functions ranging from short-term responses such as contraction and secretion to longer-term regulation of cell growth and proliferation. Usually, these signals involve some combination of release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores, such as the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and influx of Ca2+ across the plasma membrane. In one example, cell activation begins with an agonist binding to a surface membrane receptor, which is coupled to phospholipase C (PLC) through a G-protein mechanism. PLC activation leads to the production of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3), which in turn activates the IP3 receptor causing release of Ca2+ from the ER. The fall in ER Ca2+ then signals to activate plasma membrane store-operated calcium (SOC) channels. [0005] Store-operated calcium (SOC) influx is a process in cellular physiology that controls such diverse functions such as, but not limited to, refilling of intracellular Ca2+ stores (Putney et αℓ. Cell, 75, 199-201, 1993), activation of enzymatic activity (Fagan et αℓ., J. Biol. Chem. 275:26530-26537, 2000), gene transcription (Lewis, Annu. Rev. Immunol. 19:497-521, 2001), cell proliferation (Nunez et αℓ., J. Physiol. 571.1, 57-73, 2006), and release of cytokines (Winslow et αℓ., Curr. Opin. Immunol. 15:299-307, 2003). In some nonexcitable cells, e.g., blood cells, immune cells, hematopoietic cells, Τ lymphocytes and mast cells, SOC influx occurs through calcium release-activated calcium (CRAC) channels, a type of SOC channel. [0006] The calcium influx mechanism has been referred to as store-operated calcium entry (SOCE). Stromal interaction molecule (STIM) proteins are an essential component of SOC channel function, serving as the sensors for detecting the depletion of calcium from intracellular stores and for activating SOC channels.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES [0031] Figure 1 outlines the ICrac channel pathway. [0032] Figure 2 shows the typical Icrac traces in cells stably overexpressing human Orail and STIM 1 in response to the voltage stimulus immediately after break-in, before Icrac is activated, and at 5 min after Icrac is fully activated by depletion of intracellular calcium stores. DETAILED DESCRIPTION [0033] Cellular calcium homeostasis is a result of the summation of regulatory systems involved in the control of intracellular calcium levels and movements. Cellular calcium homeostasis is achieved, at least in part, by calcium binding and by movement of calcium into and out of the cell across the plasma membrane and within the cell by movement of calcium across membranes of intracellular organelles including, for example, the endoplasmic reticulum, sarcoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria and endocytic organelles including endosomes and lysosomes. [0034] Movement of calcium across cellular membranes is carried out by specialized proteins. For example, calcium from the extracellular space can enter the cell through various calcium channels and a sodium/calcium exchanger and is actively extruded from the cell by calcium pumps and sodium/calcium exchangers. Calcium can also be released from internal stores through inositol trisphosphate or ryanodine receptors and can be taken up by these organelles by means of calcium pumps. [0035] Calcium can enter cells by any of several general classes of channels, including but not limited to, voltage-operated calcium (VOC) channels, store-operated calcium (SOC) channels, and sodium/calcium exchangers operating in reverse mode. VOC channels are activated by membrane depolarization and are found in excitable cells like nerve and muscle and are for the most part not found in nonexcitable cells. Under some conditions, Ca2+ can enter cells via Na+-Ca2+ exchangers operating in reverse mode. [0036] Endocytosis provides another process by which cells can take up calcium from the extracellular medium through endosomes. In addition, some cells, e.g., exocrine cells, can release calcium via exocytosis. [0037] Cytosolic calcium concentration is tightly regulated with resting levels usually estimated at approximately 0.1 μΜ in mammalian cells, whereas the extracellular calcium concentration is typically about 2 mM. This tight regulation facilitates transduction of signals into and within cells through transient calcium flux across the plasma membrane and membranes of intracellular organelles. There is a multiplicity of intracellular calcium transport and buffer systems in cells that serve to shape intracellular calcium signals and maintain the low resting cytoplasmic calcium concentration. In cells at rest, the principal components involved in maintaining basal calcium levels are calcium pumps and leak pathways in both the endoplasmic reticulum and plasma membrane. Disturbance of resting cytosolic calcium levels can affect transmission of calcium-dependent signals and give rise to defects in a number of cellular processes. For example, cell proliferation involves a prolonged calcium signaling sequence. Other cellular processes that involve calcium signalinginclude, but are not limited to, secretion, transcription factor signaling, and fertilization. [0038] Cell-surface receptors that activate phospholipase C (PLC) create cytosolic Ca2+ signals from intra- and extra-cellular sources. An initial transient rise of [Ca2+]; (intracellular calcium concentration) results from the release of Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which is triggered by the PLC product, inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), opening IP3 receptors in the ER (Streb et αℓ. Nature, 306, 67-69, 1983). A subsequent phase of sustained Ca2+ entry across the plasma membrane then ensues, through specialized store-operated calcium (SOC) channels (in the case of immune cells the SOC channels are calcium release-activated calcium (CRAC) channels) in the plasma membrane. Store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) is the process in which the emptying of Ca2+stores itself activates Ca2+ channels in the plasma membrane to help refill the stores (Putney, Cell Calcium, 7, 1-12, 1986; Parekh et αℓ., Physiol.Rev. 757-810; 2005). SOCE does more than simply provide Ca2+ for refilling stores, but can itself generate sustained Ca2+ signals that control such essential functions as gene expression, cell metabolism and exocytosis (Parekh and Putney, Physiol. Rev. 85, 757-810 (2005). [0039] In lymphocytes and mast cells, activation of antigen or Fc receptors, respectively causes the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores, which in turn leads to Ca2+ influx through CRAC channels in the plasma membrane. The subsequent rise in intracellular Ca2+ activates calcineurin, a phosphatase that regulates the transcription factor NFAT. In resting cells, NFAT is phosphorylated and resides in the cytoplasm, but when dephosphorylated by calcineurin, NFAT translocates to the nucleus and activates different genetic programmes depending on stimulation conditions and cell type. In response to infections and during transplant rejection, NFAT partners with the transcription factor AP-1 (Fos-Jun) in the nucleus of “effector” Τ cells, thereby transactivating cytokine genes, genes that regulate Τ cell proliferation and other genes that orchestrate an active immune response (Rao et αℓ., Annu Rev Immunol., 1997;15:707-47). In contrast, in Τ cells recognizing self antigens, NFAT is activated in the absence of AP-1, and activates a transcriptional programme known as “anergy” that suppresses autoimmune responses (Macian et αℓ., Transcriptional mechanisms underlying lymphocyte tolerance. Cell. 2002 Jun 14; 109(6):719-31). In a subclass of Τ cells known as regulatory Τ cells which suppress autoimmunity mediated by self-reactive effector Τ cells, NFAT partners with the transcription factor FOXP3 to activate genes responsible for suppressor function (Wu et αℓ., Cell, 2006 Jul 28;126(2):375-87; Rudensky AY, Gavin Μ, Zheng Υ. Cell. 2006 Jul 28;126(2):253-256). [0040] The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) carries out a variety processes. The ER has a role as both a Ca2+ sink and an agonist-sensitive Ca2+ store and , protein folding/processing takes place within its lumen. In the latter case, numerous Ca2+-dependent chaperone proteins ensure that newly synthesized proteins are folded correctly and sent off to their appropriate destination. The ER is also involved in vesicle trafficking, release of stress signals, regulation of cholesterol metabolism, and apoptosis. Many of these processes require intraluminal Ca2+, and protein misfolding, ER stress responses, and apoptosis can all be induced by depleting the ER of Ca2+ for prolonged periods of time. Because it contains a finite amount of Ca2+, it is clear that ER Ca2+ content must fall after release of that Ca2+ during stimulation. However, to preserve the functional integrity of the ER, it is vital that the Ca2+ content does not fall too low or is maintained at least ar a low level. Replenishment of the ER with Ca2+ is therefore a central process to all eukaryotic cells. Because a fall in ER Ca2+ content activates store-operated Ca2+ channels in the plasma membrane, a major function of this Ca2+ entry pathway is believed to be maintenance of ER Ca2+ levels that are necessary for proper protein synthesis and folding. However, store-operated Ca2+ channels have other important roles. [0041] The understanding of store-operated calcium entry was provided by electrophysiological studies which established that the process of emptying the stores activated a Ca2+ current in mast cells called Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ current or ICrac- Icrac is non-voltage activated, inwardly rectifying, and remarkably selective for Ca2+. It is found in several cell types mainly of hemapoietic origin. Icrac is not the only store-operated current, and it is now apparent that store-operated influx encompasses a family of Ca2+-permeable channels, with different properties in different cell types. Icrac was the first store-operated Ca2+current to be described and remains a popular model for studying store-operated influx. [0042] Store-operated calcium channels can be activated by any procedure that empties ER Ca2+ stores; it does not seem to matter how the stores are emptied, the net effect is activation of store-operated Ca2+ entry. Physiologically, store emptying is evoked by an increase in the levels of IP3 or other Ca2+-releasing signals followed by Ca2+ release from the stores. But there are several other methods for emptying stores. These methods include the following: 1) elevation of IP3 in the cytosol (following receptor stimulation or, dialyzing the cytosol with IP3 itself or related congeners like the nonmetabolizable analog Ins(2,4,5)P3); 2) application of a Ca2+ ionophore (e.g., ionomycin) to permeabilize the ER membrane; 3) dialyzing the cytoplasm with high concentrations of Ca2+ chelators (e.g., EGTA or ΒΑΡΤΑ), which chelate Ca2+ that leaks from the stores and hence prevent store refilling; 4) exposure to the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) inhibitors like thapsigargin, cyclopiazonic acid, and di-tert-butylhydroquinone; 5) sensitizing the IP3 receptors to resting levels ofInsP3 with agents like thimerosal; and 6) loading membrane-permeable metal Ca2+ chelators like N,N,N’,N’-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)ethylene diamine (ΤΡΕΝ) directly into the stores. [0043] Through mass action, ΤΡΕΝ lowers free intraluminal Ca2+ concentration without changing total store Ca2+ such that the store depletion-dependent signal is generated. [0044] These methods of emptying stores are not devoid of potential problems. The key feature of store-operated Ca2+ entry is that it is the fall in Ca2+ content within the stores and not the subsequent rise in cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration that activates the channels. However, ionomycin and SERCA pump blockers generally cause a rise in cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration as a consequence of store depletion, and such a rise in Ca2+ could open Ca2+-activated cation channels permeable to Ca2+. One way to avoid such problems is to use agents under conditions where cytoplasmic Ca2+ has been strongly buffered with high concentrations of Ca2+ chelator such as EGTA or ΒΑΡΤΑ. Store-Operated Calcium Entry [0045] Reduced calcium concentration in intracellular calcium stores such as the endoplasmic reticulum resulting from release of calcium there from provides a signal for influx of calcium from the extracellular medium into the cell. This influx of calcium, which produces a sustained “plateau” elevation of cytosolic calcium concentration, generally does not rely on voltage-gated plasma membrane channels and does not involve activation of calcium channels by calcium. This calcium influx mechanism is referred to as capacitative calcium entry (CCE), calcium release-activated, store-operated or depletion-operated calcium entry. Store-operated calcium entry can be recorded as an ionic current with distinctive properties. This current is referred to as Isoc (store-operated current) or Icrac (calcium release-activated current). [0046] Electrophysiological analysis of store-operated or calcium release-activated currents reveal distinct biophysical properties (see, e.g., Parekh and Penner (1997) Physiol. Rev. 77:901-930) of these currents. For example, the current can be activated by depletion of intracellular calcium stores (e.g., by non-physiological activators such as thapsigargin, CPA, ionomycin and ΒΑΡΤΑ, and physiological activators such as IP3) and can be selective for divalent cations, such as calcium, over monovalent ions in physiological solutions or conditions, can be influenced by changes in cytosolic calcium levels, and can show altered selectivity and conductivity in the presence of low extracellular concentrations of divalent cations. The current may also be blocked or enhanced by 2-APB (depending on concentration) and blocked by SKF96365 and Gd3+ and generally can be described as a calcium current that is not strictly voltage-gated. [0047] Patch-clamp studies in mast cells and Jurkat leukaemic Τ cells have established the CRAC entry mechanism as an ion channel with distinctive biophysical characteristics, including a high selectivity for Ca2+ paired with an exceedingly low conductance. Furthermore, the CRAC channel was shown to fulfill the rigorous criteria for being store-operated, which is the activation solely by the reduction of Ca2+ in the ER rather than by cytosolic Ca2+ or other messengers generated by PLC (Prakriya et al., In Molecular and Cellular Insights into Ion Channel Biology (ed. Robert Maue) 121-140 (Elsevier Science, Amsterdam, 2004)). Regulation of Store-Operated Calcium Entry by Intracellular Calcium Stores [0048] Store-operated calcium entry is regulated by the level of calcium within an intracellular calcium store. Intracellular calcium stores can be characterized by sensitivity to agents, which can be physiological or pharmacological, which activate release of calcium from the stores or inhibit uptake of calcium into the stores. Different cells have been studied in characterization of intracellular calcium stores, and stores have been characterized as sensitive to various agents, including, but not limited to, IP3 and compounds that effect the IP3 receptor, thapsigargin, ionomycin and/or cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) (see, e.g., Berridge (1993) Nature 361:315-325; Churchill and Louis (1999) Am..!. Physiol. 276 :C426-C434 ; Dargie et al. (1990) Cell Regul. 1 :279-290 ; Gerasimenko et al. (1996) Cell 84 :473-480 ; Gromoda et al. (1995) FEBS Lett. 360 :303-306 ; Guse et al. (1999) Nature 398 :70-73). [0049] Accumulation of calcium within endoplasmic reticulum and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR; a specialized version of the endoplasmic reticulum in striated muscle) storage organelles is achieved through sarcoplasmic-endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPases (SERCAs), commonly referred to as calcium pumps. During signaling (i.e., when endoplasmic reticulum channels are activated to provide for calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum into the cytoplasm), endoplasmic reticulum calcium is replenished by the SERCA pump with cytoplasmic calcium that has entered the cell from the extracellular medium (Yu and Hinkle (2000)./. Biol. Chem. 275:23648-23653; Hofer et al. (1998) ΕΜΒΟ J. 17:1986-1995). [0050] Calcium release channels associated with IP3 and ryanodine receptors provide for controlled release of calcium from endoplasmic and sarcoplasmic reticulum into the cytoplasm resulting in transient increases in cytoplasmic calcium concentration. IP3 receptor-mediated calcium release is triggered by IP3 formed by the break down of plasma membrane phosphoinositides through the action of phospholipase C, which is activated by binding of an agonist to a plasma membrane G protein-coupled receptor or tyrosine kinase. Ryanodine receptor-mediated calcium release is triggered by an increase in cytoplasmic calcium and is referred to as calcium-induced calcium release (CICR). The activity of ryanodine receptors (which have affinity for ryanodine and caffeine) may also be regulated by cyclic ADP-ribose. [0051] Thus, the calcium levels in the stores, and in the cytoplasm, fluctuate. For example, ER free calcium concentration can decrease from a range of about 60-400 μΜ to about 1-50 μΜ when HeLa cells are treated with histamine, an agonist of PLC-linked histamine receptors (Miyawaki et αℓ. (1997) Nature 388:882-887). Store-operated calcium entry is activated as the free calcium concentration of the intracellular stores is reduced. Depletion of store calcium, as well as a concomitant increase in cytosolic calcium concentration, can thus regulate store-operated calcium entry into cells. Cytoplasmic Calcium Buffering [0052] Agonist activation of signaling processes in cells can involve dramatic increases in the calcium permeability of the endoplasmic reticulum, for example, through opening of IP3 receptor channels, and the plasma membrane through store-operated calcium entry. These increases in calcium permeability are associated with an increase in cytosolic calcium concentration that can be separated into two components: a “spike” of calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum during activation of the IP3 receptor and a plateau phase which is a sustained elevation of calcium levels resulting from entry of calcium into the cytoplasm from the extracellular medium. Upon stimulation, the resting intracellular free calcium concentration of about 100 ηΜ can rise globally to greater than 1 μΜ and higher in microdomains of the cell. The cell modulates these calcium signals with endogenous calcium buffers, including physiological buffering by organelles such as mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi. Mitochondrial uptake of calcium through a uniporter in the inner membrane is driven by the large negative mitochondrial membrane potential, and the accumulated calcium is released slowly through sodium-dependent and -independent exchangers, and, under some circumstances, the permeability transition pore (ΡΤΡ). Thus, mitochondria can act as calcium buffers by taking up calcium during periods of cellular activation and can slowly release it later. Uptake of calcium into the endoplasmic reticulum is regulated by the sarcoplasmic and endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA). Uptake of calcium into the Golgi is mediated by a P-type calcium transport ATPase (PMR1/ATP2C1). Additionally, there is evidence that a significant amount of the calcium released upon IP3 receptor activation is extruded from the cell through the action of the plasma membrane calcium ATPase. For example, plasma membrane calcium ATPases provide the dominant mechanism for calcium clearance in human Τ cells and Jurkat cells, although sodium/calcium exchange also contributes to calcium clearance in human Τ cells. Within calciumstoring organelles, calcium ions can be bound to specialized calcium-buffering proteins, such as, for example, calsequestrins, calreticulins and calnexins. Additionally, there are calcium-buffering proteins in the cytosol that modulate calcium spikes and assist in redistribution of calcium ions. Thus, proteins and other molecules that participate in any of these and other mechanisms through which cytosolic calcium levels can be reduced are proteins that are involved in, participate in and/or provide for cytoplasmic calcium buffering. Thus, cytoplasmic calcium buffering helps regulate cytoplasmic Ca2+ levels during periods of sustained calcium influx through SOC channels or bursts of Ca2+ release. Large increases in cytoplasmic Ca2+ levels or store refilling deactivate SOCE. Downstream Calcium Entry-Mediated Events [0053] In addition to intracellular changes in calcium stores, store-operated calcium entry affects a multitude of events that are consequent to or in addition to the store-operated changes. For example Ca2+ influx results in the activation of a large number of calmodulin-dependent enzymes including the serine phosphatase calcineurin. Activation of calcineurin by an increase in intracellular calcium results in acute secretory processes such as mast cell degranulation. Activated mast cells release preformed granules containing histamine, heparin, TNFa and enzymes such as β-hexosaminidase. Some cellular events, such as Β and Τ cell proliferation, require sustained calcineurin signaling, which requires a sustained increase in intracellular calcium. A number of transcription factors are regulated by calcineurin, including NFAT (nuclear factor of activated Τ cells), MEF2 and NFkB. NFAT transcription factors play important roles in many cell types, including immune cells. In immune cells NFAT mediates transcription of a large number of molecules, including cytokines, chemokines and cell surface receptors. Transcriptional elements for NFAT have been found within the promoters of cytokines such as IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-8, IL-13, as well as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFa), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), and gamma-interferon (y-IFN). [0054] The activity of NFAT proteins is regulated by their phosphorylation level, which in turn is regulated by both calcineurin and NFAT kinases. Activation of calcineurin by an increase in intracellular calcium levels results in dephosphorylation of NFAT and entry into the nucleus. Rephosphorylation of NFAT masks the nuclear localization sequence of NFAT and prevents its entry into the nucleus. Because of its strong dependence on calcineurin-mediated dephosphorylation for localization and activity, NFAT is a sensitive indicator of intracellular free calcium levels. Diseases. Disorders or Conditions [0055] Clinical studies demonstrate that the CRAC channel is absolutely required for the activation of genes underlying the Τ cell response to antigen. Sustained calcium entry is needed for lymphocyte activation and adaptive immune response. Calcium entry into lymphocytes occurs primarily through the CRAC channels. Increased calcium leads to NFAT activation and expression of cytokines required for immune response. Inhibiting the store-operated calcium entry is an efficient way to prevent Τ cell activation. [0056] Inhibition of CRAC channel activity with the compounds described herein, such as compounds of Formula (I), (II), (III), or (IV) provide a means for providing immunosuppresive therapy as demonstrated by the elimination of store-operated calcium entry noted in patients with severe-combined immunodeficiency (SCID). Τ cells, fibroblasts, and in some cases Β cells, from patients with Τ cell immunodeficiency or SCID having a principal defect in Τ cell activation show a strong defect in store-operated calcium entry (Feske et αℓ. (2001) Nature Immunol. 2 :316-324 ; Paratiseti et αℓ. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269 :32327-32335 ; and Le Deist et αℓ. (1995) Blood 85:1053-1062). SCID patients lack adaptive immune response, but without any impairment or toxicity in major organs. The SCID patient phenotype indicates that inhibition of CRAC channels is an effective strategy for immunosuppression. Diseases/Disorders Involving Inflammation and Diseases/Disorders Related to the Immune System [0057] Diseases or disorders that can be treated or prevented using the compounds, compositions, and methods provided herein include diseases and disorders involving inflammation and/or that are related to the immune system. These diseases include but are not limited to asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, glomerulonephritis, neuroinflammatory diseases such as multiple sclerosis, and disorders of the immune system. [0058] The activation of neutrophils (ΡΜΝ) by inflammatory mediators is partly achieved by increasing cytosolic calcium concentration. Store-operated calcium influx in particular is thought to play an important role in ΡΜΝ activation. It has been shown that trauma increases ΡΜΝ store-operated calcium influx (Hauser et αℓ. (2000) J. Trauma Injury Infection and Critical Care 48 (4):592-598) and that prolonged elevations of cytosolic calcium concentration due to enhanced store-operated calcium influx may alter stimulus-response coupling to chemotaxins and contribute to ΡΜΝ dysfunction after injury. Modulation of ΡΜΝ cytosolic calcium concentration through store-operated calcium channels might therefore be useful in regulating PMN-mediated inflammation and spare cardiovascular function after injury, shock or sepsis (Hauser et αℓ. (2001) J. Leukocyte Biology 69 (1):63-68). [0059] Calcium plays a critical role in lymphocyte activation. Activation of lymphocytes, e.g., by antigen stimulation, results in rapid increases in intracellular free calcium concentration and activation of transcription factors, including nuclear factor of activated Τ cells (NFAT), NF-kB, JNK1, MEF2 and CREB. NFAT is a key transcriptional regulator of the IL-2 (and other cytokine) genes (see, e.g. Lewis (2001) Annu. Rev. Immunol 19:497-521). A sustained elevation of intracellular calcium level is required to keep NFAT in a transcriptionally active state, and is dependent on store-operated calcium entry. Reduction or blocking of store-operated calcium entry in lymphocytes blocks calcium-dependent lymphocyte activation. Thus, modulation of intracellular calcium, and particularly store-operated calcium entry (e.g., reduction in, elimination of store-operated calcium entry), in lymphocytes can be a method for treating immune and immune-related disorders, including, for example, chronic immune diseases/disorders, acute immune diseases/disorders, autoimmune and immunodeficiency diseases/disorders, diseases/disorders involving inflammation, organ transplant graft rejections and graft-versus-host disease and altered (e.g., hyperactive) immune responses. For example treatment of an autoimmune disease/disorder might involve reducing, blocking or eliminating store-operated calcium entry in lymphocytes. [0060] Examples of immune disorders include psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, vasculitis, inflammatory bowel disease, dermatitis, osteoarthritis, asthma, inflammatory muscle disease, allergic rhinitis, vaginitis, interstitial cystitis, scleroderma, osteoporosis, eczema, allogeneic or xenogeneic transplantation (organ, bone marrow, stem cells and other cells and tissues) graft rejection, graft-versus-host disease, lupus erythematosus, inflammatory disease, type I diabetes, pulmonary fibrosis, dermatomyositis, Sjogren’s syndrome, thyroiditis (e.g., Hashimoto’s and autoimmune thyroiditis), myasthenia gravis, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, multiple sclerosis, cystic fibrosis, chronic relapsing hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, allergic conjunctivitis and atopic dermatitis. Cancer and Other Proliferative Diseases [0061] Compounds of Formula (I), (II), (III) or (IV), compositions thereof, and methods provided herein may be used in connection with treatment of malignancies, including, but not limited to, malignancies of lymphoreticular origin, bladder cancer, breast cancer, colon cancer, endometrial cancer, head and neck cancer, lung cancer, melanoma, ovarian cancer, prostate cancer and rectal cancer. Store-operated calcium entry may play an important role in cell proliferation in cancer cells (Weiss et αℓ. (2001) International Journal of Cancer 92 (6):877-882). [0062] Inhibition of SOCE is sufficient to prevent tumor cell proliferation. The pyrazole derivative ΒΤΡ-2, a direct ICrac blocker inhibits SOCE and proliferation in Jurkat cells (Zitt et αℓ., J. Biol. Chem., 279, 12427-12437, 2004) and in colon cancer cells. It has been suggested that sustained SOCE requires mitochonrial Ca2+ uptake (Nunez et αℓ., J. Physiol. 571.1, 57-73, 2006) and that prevention of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake leads to SOCE inhibition (Hoth et αℓ., P.N.A.S., 97, 10607-10612, 2000; Hoth et αℓ., J. Cell. Biol. 137, 633-648, 1997; Glitsch et αℓ., EMBOJ., 21, 6744-6754, 2002). Stimulation of Jurkat cells induces sustained SOCE and activation of the Ca2+-dependent phosphatase calcineurin that dephosphorylates NFAT, promoting expression of interleukin-2 and proliferation. Compounds of Formula (I), (II), (III), or (IV) inhibit SOCE and may be used in the treatment of cancer or other proliferative diseases or conditions. Liver Diseases and Disorders [0063] Diseases or disorders that can be treated or prevented using the compounds of Formula (I), (II), (III) or (IV), compositions thereof, and methods provided herein include hepatic or liver diseases and disorders. These diseases and disorders include but are not limited to liver injury, for example, due to transplantation, hepatitis and cirrhosis. [0064] Store-operated calcium entry has been implicated in chronic liver disease (Tao et αℓ. (1999) J. Biol. Chem., 274(34):23761-23769) as well as transplantation injury after cold preservation-warm reoxygenation (Elimadi et αℓ. (2001) Am J. Physiology, 281(3 Part 1):G809-G815). Kidney Diseases and Disorders [0065] Diseases or disorders that can be treated or prevented using the methods provided herein include kidney or renal diseases and disorders. Mesangial cell hyperplasia is often a key feature of such diseases and disorders. Such diseases and disorders may be caused by immunological or other mechanisms of injury, including IgAN, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis or lupus nephritis. Imbalances in the control of mesangial cell replication also appear to play a key role in the pathogenesis of progressive renal failure. [0066] The turnover of mesangial cells in normal adult kidney is very low with a renewal rate of less than 1%. A prominent feature of glomerular/kidney diseases is mesangial hyperplasia due to elevated proliferation rate or reduced cell loss of mesangial cells. When mesangial cell proliferation is induced without cell loss, for example due to mitogenic stimulation, mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis can result. Data have indicated that regulators of mesangial cell growth, particularly growth factors, may act by regulating store-operated calcium channels (Ma et αℓ. (2001) J Am. Soc. Of Nephrology, 12:(1) 47-53). Modulators of store-operated calcium influx may aid in the treatment of glomerular diseases by inhibiting mesangial cell proliferation. Store-operated Calcium Channels [0067] Clinical studies demonstrate that the CRAC channel, a type of SOC channel, is absolutely required for the activation of genes underlying the Τ cell response to antigen (Partiseti et αℓ., J Biol. Chem., 269, 32327-32335, 1994; Feske et αℓ., Curr. Biol. 15, 1235-1241, 2005). SOCE can contribute directly to the elevation of cytosolic Ca2+ levels ([Ca2+];), as in Τ lymphocytes where CRAC channels generate the sustained Ca2+ signals needed to drive gene expression underlying Τ cell activation by antigen. Sustained calcium entry is needed for lymphocyte activation and adaptive immune response. Calcium entry into lymphocytes occurs primarily through the CRAC channels. Increased calcium levels lead to NFAT activation and expression of cytokines required for immune response. [0068] The CRAC channel has a distinctive biophysical fingerprint, quantifiable storedependence, and essential function in Τ cells. Studies have shown that CRAC channels are formed from two component proteins, which interact to form CRAC channels. The CRAC channel is assembled by two functional components, STIM1 andOrail. STIM1 (stromal interaction molecule 1) was identified as the mammalian ER Ca2+ sensor (Liou, J. et αℓ. Curr. Biol. 15, 1235-1241 (2005); Roos, J. et αℓ. J. Cell Biol. 169, 435-445 (2005); WO 20041078995; US 2007/0031814). Orail/CRACMl was identified as a component of the mammalian CRAC channel (Feske, S. et αℓ. Nature 441, 179-185 (2006) ; Vig, Μ. et αℓ. Science 312, 1220-1223 (2006) ; Zhang, S. L. et αℓ. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 103, 9357-9362 (2006)). [0069] STIM1 is the sensor of Ca2+ within ER Ca2+ stores, moving in response to store depletion into ER puncta close to the plasma membrane. Orail is a pore forming CRAC channel subunit in the plasma membrane. The two membrane proteins STIM1 and Orail have each been shown to be essential for the activation of CRAC channels. [0070] Expression of both STIM1 and Orail in human embryonic kidney 293 cells (ΗΕΚ293 cells) reconstitute functional CRAC channels. Expression of Orail alone strongly reduces store-operated Ca2+ entry in ΗΕΚ293 cells and the Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ current (Icrac) in rat basophilic leukemia cells. However, expressed along with the store-sensing STIM1 protein, Orail causes a massive increase in SOCE, enhancing the rate of Ca2+ entry by up to 103-fold. This Ca2+ entry is entirely store dependent since the same co-expression causes no measurable storeindependent Ca2+ entry. The entry is completely blocked by the store-operated channel blocker, 2-aminoethoxydiphenylborate. STIM proteins are mediate Ca2+ store-sensing and endoplasmic reticulum-plasma membrane coupling with no intrinsic channel properties. Orail contributes the plasma membrane channel component responsible for Ca2+ entry. The suppression of CRAC channel function by Orail overexpression reflects a required stoichiometry between STIM1 and Orail (Soboloff et αℓ., J. Biol. Chem. Vol. 281, no. 30, 20661-20665, 2006). Stromal Interacting Molecule fSTIM) Proteins [0071] In an RNAi screen in Drosophila S2 cells using thapsigargin-activated Ca2+ entry as a marker for store-operated channels one gene gave a substantially reduced Ca2+ entry, and that gene coded for the protein stromal interaction molecule (Stim) (Roos, J. et αℓ. J. Cell Biol. 169, 435-445, 2005). There are two homologues of Stim in mammalian cells, STIM1 and STIM2, both of which appear to be distributed ubiquitously (Williams et αℓ., Biochem J. 2001 Aug 1;357(Ρΐ 3):673-85). STIM1 is the ER Ca2+ sensor for store-operated Ca2+ entry. STIM1 is a 77 kDa type I membrane protein with multiple predicted protein interaction or signaling domains and is located predominantly in the ER, but also to a limited extent in the plasma membrane. [0072] Knockdown of STIM1 by RNAi substantially reduced Icrac in Jurkat Τ cells, and store-operated Ca2+ entry in ΗΕΚ293 epithelial cells and SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. However, knockdown of the closely related STIM2 had no effect. These results indicate an essential role of STIM (Drosophila) and STIM1 (mammals) in the mechanism of activation of store-operated channels. It is unlikely that STIM1 is the store-operated channel itself. It has no channel-like sequence, and overexpression of the protein only modestly enhances Ca2+ entry. STIM1 is located both on the plasma membrane and intracellular membranes like the ER (Manji et al., Biochim Biophys Acta. 2000 Aug 31 ; 1481 (1): 147-55. 2000). The protein sequence suggests that it spans the membrane once, with its NH2 terminus oriented toward the lumen of the ER or the extracellular space. The NH2 terminus contains an EF-hand domain, and functions as the Ca2+ sensor in the ER. The protein also contains protein-protein interaction domains, notably coiled-coiled domains in the cytoplasm and a sterile motif (SAM) in the ER (or extracellular space), both near the predicted transmembrane domain. STIM1 can oligomerize and thus the protein in the ER and plasma membrane could interact bridging the two (Roos, J. et αℓ../. Cell Biol. 169, 435-445 (2005)). [0073] Total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) and confocal microscopy reveal that STIM1 is distributed throughout the ER when Ca2+ stores are full, but redistributes into discrete puncta near the plasma membrane on store depletion. Although the redistribution of STIM1 into junctional ER regions is slow (Liou, J. et αℓ. Curr. Biol. 15, 1235-1241 (2005); Zhang, S. L. et αℓ. Nature 437, 902-905 (2005), it does precede the opening of CRAC channels by several seconds (Wu et αℓ., J. Cell Biol. 174, 803-813 (2006)) and is therefore rapid enough to be an essential step in the activation of CRAC channels. [0074] It has been suggested that store depletion causes the insertion of STIM1 into the plasma membrane where it may control store-operated calcium entry through the CRAC channels (Zhang, S. L. et αℓ. Nature 437, 902-905 (2005) ; Spassova, Μ. A. et αℓ. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 103, 4040-4045 (2006)). [0075] The critical evidence for STIM1 as the Ca2+ sensor for SOCE is that mutation of predicted Ca2+-binding residues of the EF hand structural motif, expected to reduce its affinity for Ca2+ and hence mimic the store-depleted state, causes STIM1 to redistribute spontaneously into puncta and trigger constitutive Ca2+ influx through SOCs even when stores are full (Spassova, Μ. A. et αℓ. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 103, 4040-4045 (2006) ; Liou, J. et αℓ. Curr. Biol. 15, 1235-1241 (2005)). Orai Proteins [0076] Orail (also known as CRACM1) is a widely expressed, 33 kDa plasma membrane protein with 4 transmembrane domains and a lack of significant sequence homology to other ion channels (Vig, Μ. et αℓ. Science 312, 1220-1223 (2006) ; Zhang, S. L. et αℓ. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 103, 9357-9362 (2006)). [0077] Studies of Τ cells from human patients with a severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) syndrome, in which Τ cell receptor engagement or store depletion failed to activate Ca2+ entry, was shown to be due to a single point mutation in Orail (Feske, S. et αℓ. Nature 441, 179-185 (2006)). [0078] Other mammalian Orai homologues exist, e.g. Orai2 and Orai3, however their function is not clearly defined. Orai2 and Orai3 can exhibit SOC channel activity when overexpressed with STIM1 in ΗΕΚ cells (Mercer, J. C. et al. J. Biol. Chem. 281, 24979-24990 (2006)). [0079] Evidence that Orail contributes to the CRAC channel pore was obtained by Orail mutagenesis studies. Selectivity of the CRAC channel for Ca2+ ions was shown by mutations at either Glu 106 or Glu 190, which weaken the ability of Ca2+ binding in order block permeation of monovalent cations (similar to mechanisms described for voltage-gated Ca2+ channels) (Yeromin, A. V. et αℓ. Nature 443, 226-229 (2006) ; Vig, Μ. et αℓ. Curr. Biol. 16, 2073-2079 (2006) ; Prakriya, Μ. etal. Nature 443, 230-233 (2006)). [0080] Neutralizing the charge on a pair of aspartates in the I-II loop (Asp 110 and Asp 112) reduces block by Gd3+ and block of outward current by extracellular Ca2+, indicating that these negatively charged sites may promote accumulation of polyvalent cations near the mouth of the pore. [0081] Currents observed through overexpression of Orail closely resemble Icrac, and the fact that Orail can form multimers (Yeromin, A. V. et αℓ. Nature 443, 226-229 (2006) ; Vig, Μ. et αℓ. Curr. Biol. 16, 2073-2079 (2006) ; Prakriya, Μ. etal. Nature 443, 230-233 (2006)), makes it likely that the native CRAC channel is either a multimer of Orail alone or in combination with the closely related subunits Orai2 and/or Orai3. Functional Store-operated Calcium Channels [0082] The characterization of SOC channels has been largely obtained by one type of SOC channel, the CRAC channel. CRAC channel activity is triggered by the loss of Ca2+ from the ER lumen, which is coupled to the opening of CRAC channels in the plasma membrane through the actions of STIM1 and Orail. Depletion of Ca2+ is sensed by STIM1, causing it to accumulate in junctional ER adjacent to the plasma membrane. In a TIRF-based Ca2+-imaging study to map the locations of open CRAC channels, [Ca2+]; elevations were seen to co-localize with STIM1 puncta, showing directly that CRAC channels open only in extreme proximity to these sites (Luik, et αℓ., J. Cell Biol. 174, 815-825 (2006)). [0083] In cells co-expressing both STIM1 and Orail, store depletion causes Orail itself to move from a dispersed distribution to accumulate in the plasma membrane directly opposite STIM1, enabling STIM1 to activate the channel (Luik, et αℓ., J. Cell Biol. 174, 815-825 (2006); Xu, Ρ. et αℓ. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 350, 969-976 (2006)). Thus, CRAC channels are formed by apposed clusters of STIM1 in the ER and Orail in the plasma membrane. The junctional gap between the ER and plasma membrane where Orail/STIM 1 clusters from (about 10-25 nm) may be small enough to permit protein-protein interactions between STIM 1 and Orail. This is supported by the fact that overexpressed STIM1 and Orail can be co-immunoprecipitated (Yeromin, A. V. et αℓ. Nature 443, 226-229 (2006); Vig, Μ. etal. Curr. Biol. 16, 2073-2079 (2006)). [0084] Thus, STIM1 and Orail interact either directly or as members of a multiprotein complex. Support for this was observed when the expression of the cytosolic portion of STIM1 by itself was sufficient to activate CRAC channels in one study (Huang, G. Ν. et αℓ. Nature Cell Biol. 8, 1003-1010 (2006)), and the effects of deleting the ERM/coiled-coil and other C-terminal domains suggest roles in STIM1 clustering and SOC channel activation (Baba, Υ. et αℓ. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 103, 16704-16709 (2006)). On the luminal side of STIM1, the isolated EF-SAM region forms dimers and higher-order multimers on removal of Ca2+ in vitro, indicating that STIM1 oligomerization may be an early step in store-operated calcium activation (Stathopulos, el αℓ.,./. Biol. Chem. 281, 35855-35862 (2006)). [0085] In some embodiments, compounds of Formula (I), (II), (III), or (IV) described herein modulate intracellular calcium, such as, inhibition or reduction of SOCE and/or ICrac- In other embodiments, the modulation by compounds of Formula (I), (II), (III), or (IV) result from a variety of effects, such as, but not limited to, binding to a protein, interaction with a protein, or modulation of interactions, activities, levels or any physical, structural or other property of a protein involved in modulating intracellular calcium (e.g. a STIM protein and/or Orai protein). [0086] For example, methods for assessing binding or interaction of a test agent with a protein involved in modulating intracellular calcium include NMR, mass spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, scintillation proximity assays, surface plasmon resonance assays and others. Examples of methods for assessing modulation of interactions, activities, levels or any physical, structural or other property of a protein involved in modulating intracellular calcium include, but are not limited to, FRET assays to assess effects on protein interactions, NMR, X-ray crystallography and circular dichroism to assess effects on protein interactions and on physical and structural properties of a protein, and activity assays suitable for assessing a particular activity of a protein. Monitoring or Assessing Effects on Intracellular Calcium [0087] In some embodiments, monitoring or assessing the effect of a compound of Formula (I), (II), (III), or (IV) on intracellular calcium in any of the screening/identification methods described herein, a direct or indirect evaluation or measurement of cellular (including cytosolic and intracellular organelle or compartment) calcium and/or movement of ions into, within or out of a cell, organelle, calcium store or portions thereof (e.g., a membrane) are conducted. A variety of methods are described herein for evaluating calcium levels and ion movements or flux. The particular method used and the conditions employed depend on whether a particular aspect of intracellular calcium is being monitored or assessed. For example, in some embodiments described herein, reagents and conditions are known, and are used, for specifically evaluating store-operated calcium entry, resting cytosolic calcium levels, calcium buffering and calcium levels and uptake by or release from intracellular organelles and calcium stores. In other embodiments, the effect of a compound of Formula (I), (II), (III), or (IV) on intracellular calcium is monitored or assessed using, for example, a cell, an intracellular organelle or calcium storage compartment, a membrane (including, e.g., a detached membrane patch or a lipid bilayer) or a cell-free assay system (e.g., outside-out membrane vesicle). Generally, some aspect of intracellular calcium is monitored or assessed in the presence of test agent and compared to a control, e.g., intracellular calcium in the absence of test agent. Methods of Modulating Intracellular Calcium [0088] In some embodiments, modulation of intracellular calcium is any alteration or adjustment in intracellular calcium including but not limited to alteration of calcium concentration or level in the cytoplasm and/or intracellular calcium storage organelles, e.g., endoplasmic reticulum, alteration in the movement of calcium into, out of and within a cell or intracellular calcium store or organelle, alteration in the location of calcium within a cell, and alteration of the kinetics, or other properties, of calcium fluxes into, out of and within cells. In some embodiments, intracellular calcium modulation involves alteration or adjustment, e.g. reduction or inhibition, of store-operated calcium entry, cytosolic calcium buffering, calcium levels in or movement of calcium into, out of or within an intracellular calcium store or organelle, and/or basal or resting cytosolic calcium levels. In some embodiments, modulation of intracellular calcium involves an alteration or adjustment in receptor-mediated ion (e.g., calcium) movement, second messenger-operated ion (e.g., calcium) movement, calcium influx into or efflux out of a cell, and/or ion (e.g., calcium) uptake into or release from intracellular compartments, including, for example, endosomes and lysosomes. [0089] In one aspect, compounds described herein modulate intracellular calcium, such as but not limited to, modulation (e.g. reduction or inhibition) of SOC channel activity, such as inhibition of CRAC channel activity (e.g. inhibition of Icrac, inhibition of SOCE), in an immune system cell (e.g., a lymphocyte, white blood cell, Τ cell, Β cell), a fibroblast (or a cell derived from a fibroblast), or an epidermal, dermal or skin cell (e.g., a keratinocyte). In some embodiments, the step of modulating one or more proteins involved in modulating intracellular calcium (e.g. a STIM protein and/or Orai protein) involves, for example, reducing the level, expression of, an activity of, function of and/or molecular interactions of a protein. For instance, if a cell exhibits an increase in calcium levels or lack of regulation of an aspect of intracellular calcium modulation, e.g., store-operated calcium entry, then in other embodiments, modulating involves reducing the level of, expression of, an activity or function of, or a molecular interaction of a protein, e.g. a STIM protein and/or Orai protein.

In another embodiment, compounds of Formula (I), (II), (III), or (IV) alter the functional interactions of proteins that form store-operated calcium channel complexes. In one embodiment, compounds of Formula (I), (II), (III), or (IV) alter the functional interactions of STIM1 with Orail. In other embodiments, compounds of Formula (I), (II), (III), or (IV) are SOC channel pore blockers. In other embodiments, compounds of Formula (I), (II), (III), or (IV) are CRAC channel pore blockers. [0091] In one aspect, compounds described herein inhibit the electrophysiological current (Isoc) directly associated with activated SOC channels. In another aspect, compounds described herein inhibit the electrophysiological current (Icrac) directly associated with activated CRAC channels. [0092] The diseases or disorders that may benefit from modulation of intracellular calcium include, but are not limited to, an immune system-related disease (e.g., an autoimmune disease), a disease or disorder involving inflammation (e.g., asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, glomerulonephritis, neuroinflammatory diseases, multiple sclerosis, and disorders of the immune system), cancer or other proliferative disease, kidney disease and liver disease. In one aspect, compounds described herein may be used as immunosuppresants to prevent transplant graft rejections, allogeneic or xenogeneic transplantation rejection (organ, bone marrow, stem cells, other cells and tissues), graft-versus-host disease. Transplant graft rejections can result from tissue or organ transplants. Graft-versus-host disease can result from bone marrow or stem cell transplantation. [0093] Compounds described herein modulate an activity of, modulate an interaction of, or binds to, or interacts with at least one portion of a protein in the store-operated calcium channel complex. In one embodiment, compounds described herein modulate an activity of, modulate an interaction of, or binds to, or interacts with at least one portion of a protein in the calcium release activated calcium channel complex. In one aspect, compounds described herein reduce the level of functional store-operated calcium channel complexes. In one aspect, compounds described herein reduce the level of activated store-operated calcium channel complexes. In one aspect, store-operated calcium channel complexes are calcium release activated calcium channel complexes.

Further Forms of Compounds [00157] The compounds described herein may in some cases exist as diastereomers, enantiomers, or other stereoisomeric forms. The compounds presented herein include all diastereomeric, enantiomeric, and epimeric forms as well as the appropriate mixtures thereof. Separation of stereoisomers may be performed by chromatography or by the forming diastereomeric and separation by recrystallization, or chromatography, or any combination thereof. (Jean Jacques, Andre Collet, Samuel Η. Wilen, “Enantiomers, Racemates and Resolutions”, John Wiley And Sons, Inc., 1981, herein incorporated by reference for this disclosure). Stereoisomers may also be obtained by stereoselective synthesis. [00158] In some situations, compounds may exist as tautomers. All tautomers are included within the formulas described herein. [00159] The methods and compositions described herein include the use of amorphous forms as well as crystalline forms (also known as polymorphs). The compounds described herein may be in the form of pharmaceutically acceptable salts. As well, active metabolites of these compounds having the same type of activity are included in the scope of the present disclosure. In addition, the compounds described herein can exist in unsolvated as well as solvated forms with pharmaceutically acceptable solvents such as water, ethanol, and the like. The solvated forms of the compounds presented herein are also considered to be disclosed herein. [00160] In some embodiments, compounds described herein may be prepared as prodrugs. A “prodrug” refers to an agent that is converted into the parent drug in vivo. Prodrugs are often useful because, in some situations, they may be easier to administer than the parent drug. They may, for instance, be bioavailable by oral administration whereas the parent is not. The prodrug may also have improved solubility in pharmaceutical compositions over the parent drug. An example, without limitation, of a prodrug would be a compound described herein, which is administered as an ester (the “prodrug”) to facilitate transmittal across a cell membrane where water solubility is detrimental to mobility but which then is metabolically hydrolyzed to the carboxylic acid, the active entity, once inside the cell where water-solubility is beneficial. A further example of a prodrug might be a short peptide (polyaminoacid) bonded to an acid group where the peptide is metabolized to reveal the active moiety. In certain embodiments, upon in vivo administration, a prodrug is chemically converted to the biologically, pharmaceutically or therapeutically active form of the compound. In certain embodiments, a prodrug is enzymatically metabolized by one or more steps or processes to the biologically, pharmaceutically or therapeutically active form of the compound. [00161] To produce a prodrug, a pharmaceutically active compound is modified such that the active compound will be regenerated upon in vivo administration. The prodrug can be designed to alter the metabolic stability or the transport characteristics of a drug, to mask side effects or toxicity, to improve the flavor of a drug or to alter other characteristics or properties of a drug. In some embodiments, by virtue of knowledge of pharmacodynamic processes and drug metabolism in vivo, once a pharmaceutically active compound is determined, prodrugs of the compound are designed, (see, for example, Nogrady (1985) Medicinal Chemistry A Biochemical Approach, Oxford University Press, New York, pages 388-392; Silverman (1992), The Organic Chemistry of Drug Design and Drug Action, Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, pages 352-401, Saulnier et αℓ., (1994), Bioorganic and Medicinal Chemistry Letters, Vol. 4, ρ. 1985; Rooseboom et αℓ., Pharmacological Reviews, 56:53-102, 2004; Miller et αℓ., J. Med. Chem. Vol.46, no. 24, 5097-5116, 2003; Aesop Cho, “Recent Advances in Oral Prodrug Discovery”, Annual Reports in Medicinal Chemistry, Vol. 41, 395-407, 2006). [00162] Prodrug forms of the herein described compounds, wherein the prodrug is metabolized in vivo to produce a compound having the structure of Formula (I), (II), (III), or (IV) as set forth herein are included within the scope of the claims. In some cases, some of the hereindescribed compounds may be a prodrug for another derivative or active compound. [00163] Prodrugs are often useful because, in some situations, they may be easier to administer than the parent drug. They may, for instance, be bioavailable by oral administration whereas the parent is not. The prodrug may also have improved solubility in pharmaceutical compositions over the parent drug. Prodrugs may be designed as reversible drug derivatives, for use as modifiers to enhance drug transport to site-specific tissues. In some embodiments, the design of a prodrug increases the effective water solubility. See, e.g., Fedorak et αℓ., Am. J. Physiol., 269:G210-218 (1995); McLoed et αℓ., Gastroenterol, 106:405-413 (1994); Hochhaus et αℓ., Biomed. Chrom., 6:283-286 (1992); J. Larsen and Η. Bundgaard, Int../.

Stella, Pro-drugs as Novel Delivery Systems, Vol. 14 of the A.C.S. Symposium Series; and Edward Β. Roche, Bioreversible Carriers in Drug Design, American Pharmaceutical Association and Pergamon Press, 1987, all incorporated herein for such disclosure). [00164] Sites on the aromatic ring portion of compounds described herein can be susceptible to various metabolic reactions, therefore incorporation of appropriate substituents on the aromatic ring structures, such as, by way of example only, halogens can reduce, minimize or eliminate this metabolic pathway. [00165] The compounds described herein may be labeled isotopically (e.g. with a radioisotope) or by other means, including, but not limited to, the use of chromophores or fluorescent moieties, bioluminescent labels, photoactivatable or chemiluminescent labels. [00166] Compounds described herein include isotopically-labeled compounds, which are identical to those recited in the various formulae and structures presented herein, but for the fact that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into the present compounds include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine and chlorine, such as, for example, 2H, 3H, 13C, 14C, 15N, 180, 170,35S, 18F, 36C1, respectively. Certain isotopically-labeled compounds described herein, for example those into which radioactive isotopes such as 3H and 14C are incorporated, are useful in drug and/or substrate tissue distribution assays. Further, substitution with isotopes such as deuterium, i.e., 2H, can afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, such as, for example, increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements. [00167] In additional or further embodiments, the compounds described herein are metabolized upon administration to an organism in need to produce a metabolite that is then used to produce a desired effect, including a desired therapeutic effect. [00168] Compounds described herein may be formed as, and/or used as, pharmaceutically acceptable salts. The type of pharmaceutical acceptable salts, include, but are not limited to: (1) acid addition salts, formed by reacting the free base form of the compound with a pharmaceutically acceptable: inorganic acid, such as, for example, hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, metaphosphoric acid, and the like; or with an organic acid, such as, for example, acetic acid, propionic acid, hexanoic acid, cyclopentanepropionic acid, glycolic acid, pyruvic acid, lactic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, malic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, trifluoroacetic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, benzoic acid, 3-(4-hydroxybenzoyl)benzoic acid, cinnamic acid, mandelic acid, methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, 1,2-ethanedisulfonic acid, 2-hydroxyethanesulfonic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, toluenesulfonic acid, 2-naphthalenesulfonic acid, 4-methylbicyclo[2.2.2]oct-2-ene-l-carboxylic acid, glucoheptonic acid, 4,4’-methylenebis-(3-hydroxy-2-ene-lcarboxylic acid), 3-phenylpropionic acid, trimethylacetic acid, tertiary butylacetic acid, lauryl sulfuric acid, gluconic acid, glutamic acid, hydroxynaphthoic acid, salicylic acid, stearic acid, muconic acid, butyric acid, phenylacetic acid, phenylbutyric acid, valproic acid, and the like; (2) salts formed when an acidic proton present in the parent compound is replaced by a metal ion, e.g., an alkali metal ion (e.g. lithium, sodium, potassium), an alkaline earth ion (e.g. magnesium, or calcium), or an aluminum ion. In some cases, compounds described herein may coordinate with an organic base, such as, but not limited to, ethanolamine, diethanolamine, triethanolamine, tromethamine, N-methylglucamine, dicyclohexylamine, tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamine. In other cases, compounds described herein may form salts with amino acids such as, but not limited to, arginine, lysine, and the like. Acceptable inorganic bases used to form salts with compounds that include an acidic proton, include, but are not limited to, aluminum hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, sodium hydroxide, and the like. [00169] It should be understood that a reference to a pharmaceutically acceptable salt includes the solvent addition forms or crystal forms thereof, particularly solvates or polymorphs. Solvates contain either stoichiometric or non-stoichiometric amounts of a solvent, and may be formed during the process of crystallization with pharmaceutically acceptable solvents such as water, ethanol, and the like. Hydrates are formed when the solvent is water, or alcoholates are formed when the solvent is alcohol. Solvates of compounds described herein can be conveniently prepared or formed during the processes described herein. In addition, the compounds provided herein can exist in unsolvated as well as solvated forms. In general, the solvated forms are considered equivalent to the unsolvated forms for the purposes of the compounds and methods provided herein. [00170] In some embodiments, compounds described herein, such as compounds of Formula (I), (II), (III) or (IV), are in various forms, including but not limited to, amorphous forms, milled forms and nano-particulate forms. In addition, compounds described herein include crystalline forms, also known as polymorphs. Polymorphs include the different crystal packing arrangements of the same elemental composition of a compound. Polymorphs usually have different X-ray diffraction patterns, melting points, density, hardness, crystal shape, optical properties, stability, and solubility. Various factors such as the recrystallization solvent, rate of crystallization, and storage temperature may cause a single crystal form to dominate. [00171] The screening and characterization of the pharmaceutically acceptable salts, polymorphs and/or solvates may be accomplished using a variety of techniques including, but not limited to, thermal analysis, x-ray diffraction, spectroscopy, vapor sorption, and microscopy. Thermal analysis methods address thermo chemical degradation or thermo physical processes including, but not limited to, polymorphic transitions, and such methods are used to analyze the relationships between polymorphic forms, determine weight loss, to find the glass transition temperature, or for excipient compatibility studies. Such methods include, but are not limited to, Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Modulated Differential Scanning Calorimetry (MDCS), Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and Thermogravi-metric and Infrared analysis (TG/IR). X-ray diffraction methods include, but are not limited to, single crystal and powder diffractometers and synchrotron sources. The various spectroscopic techniques used include, but are not limited to, Raman, FTIR, UV-VIS, and NMR (liquid and solid state). The various microscopy techniques include, but are not limited to, polarized light microscopy, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) with Energy Dispersive X-Ray Analysis (EDX), Environmental Scanning Electron Microscopy with EDX (in gas or water vapor atmosphere), IR microscopy, and Raman microscopy.

Synthesis of Compounds [00173] In some embodiments, the synthesis of compounds described herein are accomplished using means described in the chemical literature, using the methods described herein, or by a combination thereof. In addition, solvents, temperatures and other reaction conditions presented herein may vary. [00174] In other embodiments, the starting materials and reagents used for the synthesis of the compounds described herein are synthesized or are obtained from commercial sources, such as, but not limited to, Sigma-Aldrich, FischerScientific (Fischer Chemicals), and AcrosOrganics. [00175] In further embodiments, the compounds described herein, and other related compounds having different substituents are synthesized using techniques and materials described herein as well as those that are recognized in the field, such as described, for example, in Fieser and Fieser’s Reagents for Organic Synthesis, Volumes 1-17 (John Wiley and Sons, 1991); Rodd’s Chemistry of Carbon Compounds, Volumes 1-5 and Supplemental (Elsevier Science Publishers, 1989); Organic Reactions, Volumes 1-40 (John Wiley and Sons, 1991), Larock’s Comprehensive Organic Transformations (VCH Publishers Inc., 1989), March, Advanced ORGANIC Chemistry 4th Ed., (Wiley 1992); Carey and Sundberg, ADVANCED ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 4th Ed., Vols. A and Β (Plenum 2000, 2001), and Green and Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis 3rd Ed., (Wiley 1999) (all of which are incorporated by reference for such disclosure). General methods for the preparation of compound as disclosed herein may be derived from reactions and the reactions may be modified by the use of appropriate reagents and conditions, for the introduction of the various moieties found in the formulae as provided herein. As a guide the following synthetic methods may be utilized. Formation of Covalent Linkages by Reaction of an Electronhile with a Nucleonhile [00176] The compounds described herein can be modified using various electrophiles and/or nucleophiles to form new functional groups or substituents. Table 1 entitled “Examples of Covalent Linkages and Precursors Thereof’ lists selected non-limiting examples of covalent linkages and precursor functional groups which yield the covalent linkages. Table 1 may be used as guidance toward the variety of electrophiles and nucleophiles combinations available that provide covalent linkages. Precursor functional groups are shown as electrophilic groups and nucleophilic groups. Table 1.

Protecting groups are used to block some or all of the reactive moieties and prevent such groups from participating in chemical reactions until the protective group is removed, ft is preferred that each protective group be removable by a different means. Protective groups that are cleaved under totally disparate reaction conditions fulfill the requirement of differential removal. [00178] Protective groups can be removed by acid, base, reducing conditions (such as, for example, hydrogenolysis), and/or oxidative conditions. Groups such as trityl, dimethoxytrityl, acetal and t-butyldimethylsilyl are acid labile and may be used to protect carboxy and hydroxy reactive moieties in the presence of amino groups protected with Cbz groups, which are removable by hydrogenolysis, and Fmoc groups, which are base labile. Carboxylic acid and hydroxy reactive moieties may be blocked with base labile groups such as, but not limited to, methyl, ethyl, and acetyl in the presence of amines blocked with acid labile groups such as t-butyl carbamate or with carbamates that are both acid and base stable but hydrolytically removable. [00179] Carboxylic acid and hydroxy reactive moieties may also be blocked with hydrolytically removable protective groups such as the benzyl group, while amine groups capable of hydrogen bonding with acids may be blocked with base labile groups such as Fmoc. Carboxylic acid reactive moieties may be protected by conversion to simple ester compounds as exemplified herein, which include conversion to alkyl esters, or they may be blocked with oxidatively-removable protective groups such as 2,4-dimethoxybenzyl, while co-existing amino groups may be blocked with fluoride labile silyl carbamates. [00180] Allyl blocking groups are useful in then presence of acid- and base- protecting groups since the former are stable and can be subsequently removed by metal or pi-acid catalysts. For example, an allyl-blocked carboxylic acid can be deprotected with a Pd°-catalyzed reaction in the presence of acid labile t-butyl carbamate or base-labile acetate amine protecting groups. Yet another form of protecting group is a resin to which a compound or intermediate may be attached. As long as the residue is attached to the resin, that functional group is blocked and cannot react. Once released from the resin, the functional group is available to react. [00181] Typically blocking/protecting groups may be selected from: [00182] Other protecting groups, plus a detailed description of techniques applicable to the creation of protecting groups and their removal are described in Greene and Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 3rd Ed., John Wiley & Sons, New York, NY, 1999, and Kocienski, Protective Groups, Thieme Verlag, New York, NY, 1994, which are incorporated herein by reference for such disclosure).

[00229] The terms “effective amount” or “therapeutically effective amount,” as used herein, refer to a sufficient amount of an agent or a compound being administered which will relieve to some extent one or more of the symptoms of the disease or condition being treated. The result can be reduction and/or alleviation of the signs, symptoms, or causes of a disease, or any other desired alteration of a biological system. For example, an “effective amount” for therapeutic uses is the amount of the composition that includes a compound of Formula (I), (II), (III), or (IV) described herein required to provide a clinically significant decrease in disease symptoms. An appropriate “effective” amount in any individual case may be determined using techniques, such as a dose escalation study. [00230] The terms “enhance” or “enhancing,” as used herein, means to increase or prolong either in potency or duration a desired effect. Thus, in regard to enhancing the effect of therapeutic agents, the term “enhancing” refers to the ability to increase or prolong, either in potency or duration, the effect of other therapeutic agents on a system.

The term “metabolized,” as used herein, refers to the sum of the processes (including, but not limited to, hydrolysis reactions and reactions catalyzed by enzymes) by which a particular substance is changed by an organism. Thus, enzymes may produce specific structural alterations to a compound. For example, cytochrome Ρ450 catalyzes a variety of oxidative and reductive reactions while uridine diphosphate glucuronyltransferases catalyze the transfer of an activated glucuronic-acid molecule to aromatic alcohols, aliphatic alcohols, carboxylic acids, amines and free sulphydryl groups. Further information on metabolism may be obtained from The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 9th Edition, McGraw-Hill (1996). Metabolites of the compounds disclosed herein can be identified either by administration of compounds to a host and analysis of tissue samples from the host, or by incubation of compounds with hepatic cells in vitro and analysis of the resulting compounds. [00235] "Bioavailability" refers to the percentage of the weight of the compound disclosed herein (e.g. compound of Formula (I), (II), or (III)), that is delivered into the general circulation of the animal or human being studied. The total exposure (AUC(O-oo)) of a drug when administered intravenously is usually defined as 100% bioavailable (F%). “Oral bioavailability” refers to the extent to which a compound disclosed herein, is absorbed into the general circulation when the pharmaceutical composition is taken orally as compared to intravenous injection. [00236] “Blood plasma concentration” refers to the concentration of a compound of Formula (I), (II), (III), or (IV) disclosed herein, in the plasma component of blood of a subject. It is understood that the plasma concentration of compounds described herein may vary significantly between subjects, due to variability with respect to metabolism and/or possible interactions with other therapeutic agents. In accordance with one embodiment disclosed herein, the blood plasma concentration of the compounds disclosed herein may vary from subject to subject. Likewise, values such as maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) or time to reach maximum plasma concentration (Tmax), or total area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC(O-oo)) may vary from subject to subject. Due to this variability, the amount necessary to constitute “a therapeutically effective amount” of a compound may vary from subject to subject. [00237] As used herein, "calcium homeostasis" refers to the maintenance of an overall balance in intracellular calcium levels and movements, including calcium signaling, within a cell. [00238] As used herein, "intracellular calcium" refers to calcium located in a cell without specification of a particular cellular location. In contrast, "cytosolic" or "cytoplasmic" with reference to calcium refers to calcium located in the cell cytoplasm. [00239] As used herein, an effect on intracellular calcium is any alteration of any aspect of intracellular calcium, including but not limited to, an alteration in intracellular calcium levels and location and movement of calcium into, out of or within a cell or intracellular calcium store or organelle. For example, an effect on intracellular calcium can be an alteration of the properties, such as, for example, the kinetics, sensitivities, rate, amplitude, and electrophysiological characteristics, of calcium flux or movement that occurs in a cell or portion thereof. An effect on intracellular calcium can be an alteration in any intracellular calcium-modulating process, including, store-operated calcium entry, cytosolic calcium buffering, and calcium levels in or movement of calcium into, out of or within an intracellular calcium store. Any of these aspects can be assessed in a variety of ways including, but not limited to, evaluation of calcium or other ion (particularly cation) levels, movement of calcium or other ion (particularly cation), fluctuations in calcium or other ion (particularly cation) levels, kinetics of calcium or other ion (particularly cation) fluxes and/or transport of calcium or other ion (particularly cation) through a membrane. An alteration can be any such change that is statistically significant. Thus, for example if intracellular calcium in a test cell and a control cell is said to differ, such difference can be a statistically significant difference. [00240] As used herein, "involved in" with respect to the relationship between a protein and an aspect of intracellular calcium or intracellular calcium regulation means that when expression or activity of the protein in a cell is reduced, altered or eliminated, there is a concomitant or associated reduction, alteration or elimination of one or more aspects of intracellular calcium or intracellular calcium regulation. Such an alteration or reduction in expression or activity can occur by virtue of an alteration of expression of a gene encoding the protein or by altering the levels of the protein. A protein involved in an aspect of intracellular calcium, such as, for example, store-operated calcium entry, thus, can be one that provides for or participates in an aspect of intracellular calcium or intracellular calcium regulation. For example, a protein that provides for store-operated calcium entry can be a STfM protein and/or an Orai protein. [00241] As used herein, a protein that is a component of a calcium channel is a protein that participates in multi-protein complex that forms the channel. [00242] As used herein, "basal" or "resting" with reference to cytosolic calcium levels refers to the concentration of calcium in the cytoplasm of a cell, such as, for example, an unstimulated cell, that has not been subjected to a condition that results in movement of calcium into or out of the cell or within the cell. The basal or resting cytosolic calcium level can be the concentration of free calcium (i.e., calcium that is not bound to a cellular calcium-binding substance) in the cytoplasm of a cell, such as, for example, an unstimulated cell, that has not been subjected to a condition that results in movement of calcium into or out of the cell. [00243] As used herein, "movement" with respect to ions, including cations, e.g., calcium, refers to movement or relocation, such as for example flux, of ions into, out of, or within a cell. Thus, movement of ions can be, for example, movement of ions from the extracellular medium into a cell, from within a cell to the extracellular medium, from within an intracellular organelle or storage site to the cytosol, from the cytosol into an intracellular organelle or storage site, from one intracellular organelle or storage site to another intracellular organelle or storage site, from the extracellular medium into an intracellular organelle or storage site, from an intracellular organelle or storage site to the extracellular medium and from one location to another within the cell cytoplasm. [00244] As used herein, "cation entry" or "calcium entry" into a cell refers to entry of cations, such as calcium, into an intracellular location, such as the cytoplasm of a cell or into the lumen of an intracellular organelle or storage site. Thus, cation entry can be, for example, the movement of cations into the cell cytoplasm from the extracellular medium or from an intracellular organelle or storage site, or the movement of cations into an intracellular organelle or storage site from the cytoplasm or extracellular medium. Movement of calcium into the cytoplasm from an intracellular organelle or storage site is also referred to as "calcium release" from the organelle or storage site. [00245] As used herein, "protein that modulates intracellular calcium" refers to any cellular protein that is involved in regulating, controlling and/or altering intracellular calcium. For example, such a protein can be involved in altering or adjusting intracellular calcium in a number of ways, including, but not limited to, through the maintenance of resting or basal cytoplasmic calcium levels, or through involvement in a cellular response to a signal that is transmitted in a cell through a mechanism that includes a deviation in intracellular calcium from resting or basal states. In the context of a "protein that modulates intracellular calcium," a "cellular" protein is one that is associated with a cell, such as, for example, a cytoplasmic protein, a plasma membrane-associated protein or an intracellular membrane protein. Proteins that modulate intracellular calcium include, but are not limited to, ion transport proteins, calcium-binding proteins and regulatory proteins that regulate ion transport proteins. [00246] As used herein, "amelioration" refers to an improvement in a disease or condition or at least a partial relief of symptoms associated with a disease or condition. [00247] As used herein, "cell response" refers to any cellular response that results from ion movement into or out of a cell or within a cell. The cell response may be associated with any cellular activity that is dependent, at least in part, on ions such as, for example, calcium. Such activities may include, for example, cellular activation, gene expression, endocytosis, exocytosis, cellular trafficking and apoptotic cell death. [00248] As used herein, "immune cells" include cells of the immune system and cells that perform a function or activity in an immune response, such as, but not limited to, T-cells, B-cells, lymphocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, mast cells, plasma cells, white blood cells, antigen presenting cells and natural killer cells. [00249] As used herein, "cytokine" refers to small soluble proteins secreted by cells that can alter the behavior or properties of the secreting cell or another cell. Cytokines bind to cytokine receptors and trigger a behavior or property within the cell, for example, cell proliferation, death or differentiation. Exemplary cytokines include, but are not limited to, interleukins (e.g., IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, IL-10, IL-11, IL-12, IL-13, IL-15, IL-16, IL-17, IL-18, IL-la, ΚΜβ, and IL-1 RA), granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), oncostatin Μ, erythropoietin, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), interferons, Β7.1 (also known as CD80), Β7.2 (also known as Β70, CD86), TNF family members (TNF-a, TNF-ff 17Τ-β, CD40 ligand, Fas ligand, CD27 ligand, CD30 ligand, 4-1BBL, Trail), and MIF. [00250] “Store-operated calcium entry” or “SOCE” refers to the mechanism by which release of calcium ions from intracellular stores is coordinated with ion influx across the plasma membrane. [00251] “Selective inhibitor of SOC channel activity” means that the inhibitor is selective for SOC channels and does not substantially affect the activity of other types of ion channels. [00252] “Selective inhibitor of CRAC channel activity” means that the inhibitor is selective for CRAC channels and does not substantially affect the activity of other types of ion channels and/or other SOC channels. Monitoring or Assessing Effects on Intracellular Calcium [00253] In monitoring or assessing the effect of a compound of Formula (I), (II), (III), or (IV) on intracellular calcium in any of the screening/identification methods described herein or recognized in the field, a direct or indirect evaluation or measurement of cellular (including cytosolic and intracellular organelle or compartment) calcium and/or movement of ions into, within or out of a cell, organelle, calcium store or portions thereof (e.g., a membrane) can be conducted. A variety of methods are described herein and/or recognized in the field for evaluating calcium levels and ion movements or flux. The particular method used and the conditions employed can depend on whether a particular aspect of intracellular calcium is being monitored or assessed. For example, as described herein in some embodiments, reagents and conditions are used, for specifically evaluating store-operated calcium entry, resting cytosolic calcium levels, calcium buffering and calcium levels and uptake by or release from intracellular organelles and calcium stores. The effect of a compound of Formula (I), (II), (III), or (IV) on intracellular calcium can be monitored or assessed using, for example, a cell, an intracellular organelle or calcium storage compartment, a membrane (including, e.g., a detached membrane patch or a lipid bilayer) or a cell-free assay system (e.g., outside-out membrane vesicle). Generally, some aspect of intracellular calcium is monitored or assessed in the presence of test agent and compared to a control, e.g., intracellular calcium in the absence of test agent. Methods of Modulating Intracellular Calcium [00254] Modulation of intracellular calcium can be any alteration or adjustment in intracellular calcium including but not limited to alteration of calcium concentration or level in the cytoplasm and/or intracellular calcium storage organelles, e.g., endoplasmic reticulum, alteration in the movement of calcium into, out of and within a cell or intracellular calcium store or organelle, alteration in the location of calcium within a cell, and alteration of the kinetics, or other properties, of calcium fluxes into, out of and within cells. In particular embodiments, intracellular calcium modulation can involve alteration or adjustment, e.g. reduction or inhibition, of store-operated calcium entry, cytosolic calcium buffering, calcium levels in or movement of calcium into, out of or within an intracellular calcium store or organelle, and/or basal or resting cytosolic calcium levels. In some embodiments, modulation of intracellular calcium can involve an alteration or adjustment in receptor-mediated ion (e.g., calcium) movement, second messenger-operated ion (e.g., calcium) movement, calcium influx into or efflux out of a cell, and/or ion (e.g., calcium) uptake into or release from intracellular compartments, including, for example, endosomes and lysosomes. [00255] In one aspect, compounds described herein modulate intracellular calcium, such as but not limited to, modulation (e.g. reduction or inhibition) of SOC channel activity, such as inhibition of CRAC channel activity (e.g. inhibition of Icrac, inhibition of SOCE) in an immune system cell (e.g., a lymphocyte, white blood cell, Τ cell, Β cell), a fibroblast (or a cell derived from a fibroblast), or an epidermal, dermal or skin cell (e.g., a keratinocyte). The step of modulating one or more proteins involved in modulating intracellular calcium (e.g. a STIM protein and/or Orai protein) can involve, for example, reducing the level, expression of, an activity of, function of and/or molecular interactions of a protein. For instance, if a cell exhibits an increase in calcium levels or lack of regulation of an aspect of intracellular calcium modulation, e.g., store-operated calcium entry, then modulating may involve reducing the level of, expression of, an activity or function of, or a molecular interaction of a protein, e.g. a STIM protein and/or Orai protein. Examples of Pharmaceutical Compositions and Methods of Administration [00256] Pharmaceutical compositions may be formulated in a conventional manner using one or more physiologically acceptable carriers including excipients and auxiliaries which facilitate processing of the active compounds into preparations which can be used pharmaceutically.

[00267] In some embodiments, solid dosage forms, e.g., tablets, effervescent tablets, and capsules, are prepared by mixing particles of a compound of Formula (I), (II), (III), or (IV) described herein, with one or more pharmaceutical excipients to form a bulk blend composition. When referring to these bulk blend compositions as homogeneous, it is meant that the particles of the compound of Formula (I), (II), (III), or (IV) described herein, are dispersed evenly throughout the composition so that the composition may be subdivided into equally effective unit dosage forms, such as tablets, pills, and capsules. The individual unit dosages may also include film coatings, which disintegrate upon oral ingestion or upon contact with diluent. These formulations can be manufactured by conventional pharmacological techniques. [00268] The pharmaceutical solid dosage forms described herein can include a compound of Formula (I), (II), (III), or (IV) described herein, and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable additives such as a compatible carrier, binder, filling agent, suspending agent, flavoring agent, sweetening agent, disintegrating agent, dispersing agent, surfactant, lubricant, colorant, diluent, solubilizer, moistening agent, plasticizer, stabilizer, penetration enhancer, wetting agent, antifoaming agent, antioxidant, preservative, or one or more combination thereof.

Furthermore, other methods such as roller compaction, extrusion/spheronization, coacervation, or nanoparticle coating may also be used. [00290] In still other embodiments, effervescent powders are also prepared in accordance with the present disclosure. Effervescent salts have been used to disperse medicines in water for oral administration. Effervescent salts are granules or coarse powders containing a medicinal agent in a dry mixture, usually composed of sodium bicarbonate, citric acid and/or tartaric acid. When such salts are added to water, the acids and the base react to liberate carbon dioxide gas, thereby causing “effervescence.” Examples of effervescent salts include, e.g., the following ingredients: sodium bicarbonate or a mixture of sodium bicarbonate and sodium carbonate, citric acid and/or tartaric acid. Any acid-base combination that results in the liberation of carbon dioxide can be used in place of the combination of sodium bicarbonate and citric and tartaric acids, as long as the ingredients were suitable for pharmaceutical use and result in a pH of about 6.0 or higher. [00291] In other embodiments, the formulations described herein, which include a compound described herein, are solid dispersions. Methods of producing such solid dispersions include, but are not limited to, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,343,789, 5,340,591, 5,456,923, 5,700,485, 5,723,269, and U.S. patent publication no. 2004/0013734. In still other embodiments, the formulations described herein are solid solutions. Solid solutions incorporate a substance together with the active agent and other excipients such that heating the mixture results in dissolution of the drug and the resulting composition is then cooled to provide a solid blend which can be further formulated or directly added to a capsule or compressed into a tablet. Methods of producing such solid solutions include, but are not limited to, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,151,273, 5,281,420, and 6,083,518. [00292] The pharmaceutical solid oral dosage forms including formulations described herein, which include a compounds described herein, can be further formulated to provide a controlled release of the compound of Formula (I), (II), or (III). Controlled release refers to the release of the compounds described herein from a dosage form in which it is incorporated according to a desired profile over an extended period of time. Controlled release profiles include, for example, sustained release, prolonged release, pulsatile release, and delayed release profiles. In contrast to immediate release compositions, controlled release compositions allow delivery of an agent to a subject over an extended period of time according to a predetermined profile. Such release rates can provide therapeutically effective levels of agent for an extended period of time and thereby provide a longer period of pharmacologic response while minimizing side effects as compared to conventional rapid release dosage forms. Such longer periods of response provide for many inherent benefits that are not achieved with the corresponding short acting, immediate release preparations. [00293] In some embodiments, the solid dosage forms described herein can be formulated as enteric coated delayed release oral dosage forms, i.e., as an oral dosage form of a pharmaceutical composition as described herein which utilizes an enteric coating to affect release in the small intestine of the gastrointestinal tract. The enteric coated dosage form may be a compressed or molded or extruded tablet/mold (coated or uncoated) containing granules, powder, pellets, beads or particles of the active ingredient and/or other composition components, which are themselves coated or uncoated. The enteric coated oral dosage form may also be a capsule (coated or uncoated) containing pellets, beads or granules of the solid carrier or the composition, which are themselves coated or uncoated. [00294] The term "delayed release" as used herein refers to the delivery so that the release can be accomplished at some generally predictable location in the intestinal tract more distal to that which would have been accomplished if there had been no delayed release alterations. In some embodiments the method for delay of release is coating. Any coatings should be applied to a sufficient thickness such that the entire coating does not dissolve in the gastrointestinal fluids at pH below about 5, but does dissolve at pH about 5 and above. Coatings may be made from: [00295] Acrylic polymers. The performance of acrylic polymers (primarily their solubility in biological fluids) can vary based on the degree and type of substitution. Examples of suitable acrylic polymers include methacrylic acid copolymers and ammonium methacrylate copolymers. The Eudragit series Ε, L, S, RL, RS and ΝΕ (Rohm Pharma) are available as solubilized in organic solvent, aqueous dispersion, or dry powders. The Eudragit series RL, ΝΕ, and RS are insoluble in the gastrointestinal tract but are permeable and are used primarily for colonic targeting. The Eudragit series Ε dissolve in the stomach. The Eudragit series L, L-30D and S are insoluble in stomach and dissolve in the intestine; [00296] Cellulose Derivatives. Examples of suitable cellulose derivatives are: ethyl cellulose; reaction mixtures of partial acetate esters of cellulose with phthalic anhydride. The performance can vary based on the degree and type of substitution. Cellulose acetate phthalate (CAP) dissolves in pH >6. Aquateric (FMC) is an aqueous based system and is a spray dried CAP pseudolatex with particles <1 pm. Other components in Aquateric can include pluronics, Tweens, and acetylated monoglycerides. Other suitable cellulose derivatives include: cellulose acetate trimellitate (Eastman); methylcellulose (Pharmacoat, Methocel); hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose phthalate (HPMCP); hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose succinate (HPMCS); and hydroxypropylmethylcellulose acetate succinate (e.g., AQOAT (Shin Etsu)). The performance can vary based on the degree and type of substitution. For example, HPMCP such as, HP-50, HP-55, HP-55S, HP-55F grades are suitable. The performance can vary based on the degree and type of substitution. For example, suitable grades of hydroxypropylmethylcellulose acetate succinate include, but are not limited to, AS-LG (LF), which dissolves at pH 5, AS-MG (MF), which dissolves at pH 5.5, and AS-HG (HF), which dissolves at higher pH. These polymers are offered as granules, or as fine powders for aqueous dispersions; [00297] Poly Vinyl Acetate Phthalate (PVAP). PVAP dissolves in pH >5, and it is much less permeable to water vapor and gastric fluids. [00298] In some embodiments, the coating can, and usually does, contain a plasticizer and possibly other coating excipients such as colorants, talc, and/or magnesium stearate. Suitable plasticizers include triethyl citrate (Citroflex 2), triacetin (glyceryl triacetate), acetyl triethyl citrate (Citroflec Α2), Carbowax 400 (polyethylene glycol 400), diethyl phthalate, tributyl citrate, acetylated monoglycerides, glycerol, fatty acid esters, propylene glycol, and dibutyl phthalate. In particular, anionic carboxylic acrylic polymers usually will contain 10-25% by weight of a plasticizer, especially dibutyl phthalate, polyethylene glycol, triethyl citrate and triacetin. Conventional coating techniques such as spray or pan coating are employed to apply coatings. The coating thickness must be sufficient to ensure that the oral dosage form remains intact until the desired site of topical delivery in the intestinal tract is reached. [00299] Colorants, detackifiers, surfactants, antifoaming agents, lubricants (e.g., camuba wax or PEG) may be added to the coatings besides plasticizers to solubilize or disperse the coating material, and to improve coating performance and the coated product. [00300] In other embodiments, the formulations described herein, which include a compound of Formula (I), (II), (III), or (IV) described herein, are delivered using a pulsatile dosage form. A pulsatile dosage form is capable of providing one or more immediate release pulses at predetermined time points after a controlled lag time or at specific sites. Pulsatile dosage forms may be administered using a variety of pulsatile formulations including, but are not limited to, those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,011,692; 5,017,381; 5,229,135; 5,840,329; 4,871,549; 5,260,068; 5,260,069; 5,508,040; 5,567,441 and 5,837,284. [00301] Many other types of controlled release systems are suitable for use with the formulations described herein. Examples of such delivery systems include, e.g., polymer-based systems, such as polylactic and polyglycolic acid, polyanhydrides and polycaprolactone; porous matrices, nonpolymer-based systems that are lipids, including sterols, such as cholesterol, cholesterol esters and fatty acids, or neutral fats, such as mono-, di- and triglycerides; hydrogel release systems; silastic systems; peptide-based systems; wax coatings, bioerodible dosage forms, compressed tablets using conventional binders and the like. See, e.g., Liberman et αℓ., Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, 2 Ed., Vol. 1, ρρ. 209-214 (1990); Singh et αℓ., Encyclopedia of Pharmaceutical Technology, 2nd Ed., ρρ. 751-753 (2002); U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,327,725; 4,624,848; 4,968,509; 5,461,140; 5,456,923; 5,516,527; 5,622,721; 5,686,105; 5,700,410; 5,977,175; 6,465,014; and 6,932,983. [00302] In some embodiments, pharmaceutical formulations are provided that include particles of the compounds described herein, e.g. compounds of Formula (I), (II), (III) or (IV), and at least one dispersing agent or suspending agent for oral administration to a subject. The formulations may be a powder and/or granules for suspension, and upon admixture with water, a substantially uniform suspension is obtained. [00303] Liquid formulation dosage forms for oral administration can be aqueous suspensions selected from the group including, but not limited to, pharmaceutically acceptable aqueous oral dispersions, emulsions, solutions, elixirs, gels, and syrups. See, e.g., Singh et αℓ., Encyclopedia of Pharmaceutical Technology, 2nd Ed., ρρ. 754-757 (2002). [00304] The aqueous suspensions and dispersions described herein can remain in a homogenous state, as defined in The USP Pharmacists' Pharmacopeia (2005 edition, chapter 905), for at least 4 hours. The homogeneity should be determined by a sampling method consistent with regard to determining homogeneity of the entire composition. In one embodiment, an aqueous suspension can be re-suspended into a homogenous suspension by physical agitation lasting less than 1 minute. In another embodiment, an aqueous suspension can be re-suspended into a homogenous suspension by physical agitation lasting less than 45 seconds. In yet another embodiment, an aqueous suspension can be re-suspended into a homogenous suspension by physical agitation lasting less than 30 seconds. In still another embodiment, no agitation is necessary to maintain a homogeneous aqueous dispersion. [00305] The pharmaceutical compositions described herein may include sweetening agents such as, but not limited to, acacia syrup, acesulfame Κ, alitame, anise, apple, aspartame, banana, Bavarian cream, berry, black currant, butterscotch, calcium citrate, camphor, caramel, cherry, cherry cream, chocolate, cinnamon, bubble gum, citrus, citrus punch, citrus cream, cotton candy, cocoa, cola, cool cherry, cool citrus, cyclamate, cylamate, dextrose, eucalyptus, eugenol, fructose, fruit punch, ginger, glycyrrhetinate, glycyrrhiza (licorice) syrup, grape, grapefruit, honey, isomalt, lemon, lime, lemon cream, monoammonium glyrrhizinate (MagnaSweet®), maltol, mannitol, maple, marshmallow, menthol, mint cream, mixed berry, neohesperidine DC, neotame, orange, pear, peach, peppermint, peppermint cream, Prosweet® Powder, raspberry, root beer, rum, saccharin, safrole, sorbitol, spearmint, spearmint cream, strawberry, strawberry cream, stevia, sucralose, sucrose, sodium saccharin, saccharin, aspartame, acesulfame potassium, mannitol, talin, sucralose, sorbitol, swiss cream, tagatose, tangerine, thaumatin, tutti fruitti, vanilla, walnut, watermelon, wild cherry, wintergreen, xylitol, or any combination of these flavoring ingredients, e.g., anise-menthol, cherryanise, cinnamon-orange, cherry-cinnamon, chocolate-mint, honey-lemon, lemon-lime, lemon-mint, menthol-eucalyptus, orange-cream, vanilla-mint, and mixtures thereof. [00306] In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical formulations described herein can be self-emulsifying drug delivery systems (SEDDS). Emulsions are dispersions of one immiscible phase in another, usually in the form of droplets. Generally, emulsions are created by vigorous mechanical dispersion. SEDDS, as opposed to emulsions or microemulsions, spontaneously form emulsions when added to an excess of water without any external mechanical dispersion or agitation. An advantage of SEDDS is that only gentle mixing is required to distribute the droplets throughout the solution. Additionally, water or the aqueous phase can be added just prior to administration, which ensures stability of an unstable or hydrophobic active ingredient. Thus, the SEDDS provides an effective delivery system for oral and parenteral delivery of hydrophobic active ingredients. SEDDS may provide improvements in the bioavailability of hydrophobic active ingredients. Methods of producing self-emulsifying dosage forms include, but are not limited to, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,858,401, 6,667,048, and 6,960,563. [00307] There is overlap between the above-listed additives used in the aqueous dispersions or suspensions described herein, since a given additive is often classified differently by different practitioners in the field, or is commonly used for any of several different functions. Thus, the above-listed additives should be taken as merely exemplary, and not limiting, of the types of additives that can be included in formulations described herein. [00308] Potential excipients for intranasal formulations include, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,476,116, 5,116,817 and 6,391,452. Formulations solutions in saline, employing benzyl alcohol or other suitable preservatives, fluorocarbons, and/or other solubilizing or dispersing agents. See, for example, Ansel, Η. C. et αℓ., Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms and Drug Delivery Systems, Sixth Ed. (1995). Preferably these compositions and formulations are prepared with suitable nontoxic pharmaceutically acceptable ingredients.. The choice of suitable carriers is highly dependent upon the exact nature of the nasal dosage form desired, e.g., solutions, suspensions, ointments, or gels. Nasal dosage forms generally contain large amounts of water in addition to the active ingredient. Minor amounts of other ingredients such as pH adjusters, emulsifiers or dispersing agents, preservatives, surfactants, gelling agents, or buffering and other stabilizing and solubilizing agents may also be present. Preferably, the nasal dosage form should be isotonic with nasal secretions. [00309] For administration by inhalation, the compounds described herein may be in a form as an aerosol, a mist or a powder. Pharmaceutical compositions described herein are conveniently delivered in the form of an aerosol spray presentation from pressurized packs or a nebuliser, with the use of a suitable propellant, e.g., dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethane, carbon dioxide or other suitable gas. In the case of a pressurized aerosol, the dosage unit may be determined by providing a valve to deliver a metered amount. Capsules and cartridges of, such as, by way of example only, gelatin for use in an inhaler or insufflator may be formulated containing a powder mix of the compound described herein and a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch. [00310] Buccal formulations that include compounds described herein may be administered using a variety of formulations which include, but are not limited to, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,229,447, 4,596,795, 4,755,386, and 5,739,136. In addition, the buccal dosage forms described herein can further include a bioerodible (hydrolysable) polymeric carrier that also serves to adhere the dosage form to the buccal mucosa. The buccal dosage form is fabricated so as to erode gradually over a predetermined time period, wherein the delivery of the compound is provided essentially throughout. Buccal drug delivery avoids the disadvantages encountered with oral drug administration, e.g., slow absorption, degradation of the active agent by fluids present in the gastrointestinal tract and/or first-pass inactivation in the liver. With regard to the bioerodible (hydrolysable) polymeric carrier, virtually any such carrier can be used, so long as the desired drug release profile is not compromised, and the carrier is compatible with the compounds described herein, and any other components that may be present in the buccal dosage unit. Generally, the polymeric carrier comprises hydrophilic (water-soluble and water-swellable) polymers that adhere to the wet surface of the buccal mucosa. Examples of polymeric carriers useful herein include acrylic acid polymers and co, e.g., those known as "carbomers" (Carbopol®, which may be obtained from B.F. Goodrich, is one such polymer). Other components may also be incorporated into the buccal dosage forms described herein include, but are not limited to, disintegrants, diluents, binders, lubricants, flavoring, colorants, preservatives, and the like. For buccal or sublingual administration, the compositions may take the form of tablets, lozenges, or gels formulated in a conventional manner. [00311] Transdermal formulations described herein may be administered using a variety of devices including but not limited to, U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,598,122, 3,598,123, 3,710,795, 3,731,683, 3,742,951, 3,814,097, 3,921,636, 3,972,995, 3,993,072, 3,993,073, 3,996,934, 4,031,894, 4,060,084, 4,069,307, 4,077,407, 4,201,211, 4,230,105, 4,292,299, 4,292,303, 5,336,168, 5,665,378, 5,837,280, 5,869,090, 6,923,983, 6,929,801 and 6,946,144. [00312] The transdermal dosage forms described herein may incorporate certain pharmaceutically acceptable excipients which are conventional in the art. In one embodiment, the transdermal formulations described herein include at least three components: (1) a formulation of a compound of Formula (I), (II), or (III); (2) a penetration enhancer; and (3) an aqueous adjuvant. In addition, transdermal formulations can include additional components such as, but not limited to, gelling agents, creams and ointment bases, and the like. In some embodiments, the transdermal formulation can further include a woven or non-woven backing material to enhance absorption and prevent the removal of the transdermal formulation from the skin. In other embodiments, the transdermal formulations described herein can maintain a saturated or supersaturated state to promote diffusion into the skin. [00313] Formulations suitable for transdermal administration of compounds described herein may employ transdermal delivery devices and transdermal delivery patches and can be lipophilic emulsions or buffered, aqueous solutions, dissolved and/or dispersed in a polymer or an adhesive. Such patches may be constructed for continuous, pulsatile, or on demand delivery of pharmaceutical agents. Still further, transdermal delivery of the compounds described herein can be accomplished by means of iontophoretic patches and the like. Additionally, transdermal patches can provide controlled delivery of the compounds described herein. The rate of absorption can be slowed by using rate-controlling membranes or by trapping the compound within a polymer matrix or gel. Conversely, absorption enhancers can be used to increase absorption. An absorption enhancer or carrier can include absorbable pharmaceutically acceptable solvents to assist passage through the skin. For example, transdermal devices are in the form of a bandage comprising a backing member, a reservoir containing the compound optionally with carriers, optionally a rate controlling barrier to deliver the compound to the skin of the host at a controlled and predetermined rate over a prolonged period of time, and means to secure the device to the skin. [00314] Formulations suitable for intramuscular, subcutaneous, or intravenous injection may include physiologically acceptable sterile aqueous or non-aqueous solutions, dispersions, suspensions or emulsions, and sterile powders for reconstitution into sterile injectable solutions or dispersions. Examples of suitable aqueous and non-aqueous carriers, diluents, solvents, or vehicles including water, ethanol, polyols (propyleneglycol, polyethylene-glycol, glycerol, cremophor and the like), suitable mixtures thereof, vegetable oils (such as olive oil) and injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate. Proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions, and by the use of surfactants. Formulations suitable for subcutaneous injection may also contain additives such as preserving, wetting, emulsifying, and dispensing agents. Prevention of the growth of microorganisms can be ensured by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, such as parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, and the like, ft may also be desirable to include isotonic agents, such as sugars, sodium chloride, and the like. Prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form can be brought about by the use of agents delaying absorption, such as aluminum monostearate and gelatin. [00315] For intravenous injections, compounds described herein may be formulated in aqueous solutions, preferably in physiologically compatible buffers such as Hank’s solution, Ringer’s solution, or physiological saline buffer. For transmucosal administration, penetrants appropriate to the barrier to be permeated are used in the formulation. Such penetrants are generally recognized in the field. For other parenteral injections, appropriate formulations may include aqueous or nonaqueous solutions, preferably with physiologically compatible buffers or excipients. Such excipients are generally recognized in the field. [00316] Parenteral injections may involve bolus injection or continuous infusion. Formulations for injection may be presented in unit dosage form, e.g., in ampoules or in multi-dose containers, with an added preservative. The pharmaceutical composition described herein may be in a form suitable for parenteral injection as a sterile suspensions, solutions or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and may contain formulatory agents such as suspending, stabilizing and/or dispersing agents. Pharmaceutical formulations for parenteral administration include aqueous solutions of the active compounds in water-soluble form. Additionally, suspensions of the active compounds may be prepared as appropriate oily injection suspensions. Suitable lipophilic solvents or vehicles include fatty oils such as sesame oil, or synthetic fatty acid esters, such as ethyl oleate or triglycerides, or liposomes. Aqueous injection suspensions may contain substances which increase the viscosity of the suspension, such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, sorbitol, or dextran. Optionally, the suspension may also contain suitable stabilizers or agents which increase the solubility of the compounds to allow for the preparation of highly concentrated solutions. Alternatively, the active ingredient may be in powder form for constitution with a suitable vehicle, e.g., sterile pyrogen-free water, before use. [00317] In certain embodiments, delivery systems for pharmaceutical compounds may be employed, such as, for example, liposomes and emulsions. In certain embodiments, compositions provided herein also include an mucoadhesive polymer, selected from among, for example, carboxymethylcellulose, carbomer (acrylic acid polymer), poly(methylmethacrylate), polyacrylamide, polycarbophil, acrylic acid/butyl acrylate copolymer, sodium alginate and dextran. [00318] In some embodiments, the compounds described herein may be administered topically and are formulated into a variety of topically administrable compositions, such as solutions, suspensions, lotions, gels, pastes, medicated sticks, balms, creams or ointments. Such pharmaceutical compounds can contain solubilizers, stabilizers, tonicity enhancing agents, buffers and preservatives. [00319] The compounds described herein may also be formulated in rectal compositions such as enemas, rectal gels, rectal foams, rectal aerosols, suppositories, jelly suppositories, or retention enemas, containing conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter or other glycerides, as well as synthetic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone, PEG, and the like. In suppository forms of the compositions, a low-melting wax such as, but not limited to, a mixture of fatty acid glycerides, optionally in combination with cocoa butter is first melted. [00320] Generally, an agent, such as a compound of Formula (I), (II), (III), or (IV) is administered in an amount effective for amelioration of, or prevention of the development of symptoms of, the disease or disorder (i.e., a therapeutically effective amount). Thus, a therapeutically effective amount can be an amount that is capable of at least partially preventing or reversing a disease or disorder. The dose required to obtain an effective amount may vary depending on the agent, formulation, disease or disorder, and individual to whom the agent is administered. [00321] Determination of effective amounts may also involve in vitro assays in which varying doses of agent are administered to cells in culture and the concentration of agent effective for ameliorating some or all symptoms is determined in order to calculate the concentration required in vivo. Effective amounts may also be based in in vivo animal studies. [00322] An agent can be administered prior to, concurrently with and subsequent to the appearance of symptoms of a disease or disorder. In some embodiments, an agent is administered to a subject with a family history of the disease or disorder, or who has a phenotype that may indicate a predisposition to a disease or disorder, or who has a genotype which predisposes the subject to the disease or disorder. [00323] The particular delivery system used can depend on a number of factors, including, for example, the intended target and the route of administration, e.g., local or systemic. Targets for delivery can be specific cells which are causing or contributing to a disease or disorder, including, for example, cells that have altered intracellular calcium or calcium dysregulation or dyshomeostasis, and cells that do not have altered intracellular calcium but that may have some alteration, defect or deficiency that can be, at least in part, compensated, counteracted, reversed or alleviated or eliminated by altering intracellular calcium of the cell. Particular cells include, for example, immune cells (e.g., lymphocytes, Τ cells, Β cells, white blood cells), fibroblasts (or cells derived from a fibroblast), epidermal, dermal or skin cells (e.g., a keratinocytes), blood cells, kidney or renal cells (e.g., mesangial cells), muscle cells (e.g., a smooth muscle cell such as an airway (tracheal or bronchial) smooth muscle cell) and exocrine or secretory (e.g., salivary, including parotid acinar and submandibular gland) cells. For example, a target cell can be resident or infiltrating cells in the lungs or airways that contribute to an asthmatic illness or disease, resident or infiltrating cells in the nervous system contributing to a neurological, neurodegenerative or demyelinating disease or disorder, resident or infiltrating cells involved in rejection of a kidney graft, grafted cells that when activated lead to graft-versus-host disease, resident or infiltrating cells involved in rejection of a kidney graft, resident or infiltrating cells, activation of which contributes to inflammation, e.g., in arthritis, resident or infiltrating cells in the kidney or renal system (e.g., mesangial cells) involved in neuropathy and glomerulonephritis and resident or infiltrating cells in exocrine glands (e.g., salivary and lacrimal glands) involved in autoimmune disorders (e.g., Sjogren's disease). Administration of an agent can be directed to one or more cell types or subsets of a cell type by methods recognized in the field. For example, an agent can be coupled to an antibody, ligand to a cell surface receptor or a toxin, or can be contained in a particle that is selectively internalized into cells, e.g., liposomes or a virus in which the viral receptor binds specifically to a certain cell type, or a viral particle lacking the viral nucleic acid, or can be administered locally. Examples of Methods of Dosing and Treatment Regimens [00324] The compounds described herein can be used in the preparation of medicaments for the modulation of intracellular calcium, or for the treatment of diseases or conditions that would benefit, at least in part, from modulation of intracellular calcium. In addition, a method for treating any of the diseases or conditions described herein in a subject in need of such treatment, involves administration of pharmaceutical compositions containing at least one compound described herein, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, pharmaceutically acceptable prodrug, or pharmaceutically acceptable solvate thereof, in therapeutically effective amounts to said subject. [00325] The compositions containing the compound(s) described herein can be administered for prophylactic and/or therapeutic treatments. In therapeutic applications, the compositions are administered to a patient already suffering from a disease or condition, in an amount sufficient to cure or at least partially arrest the symptoms of the disease or condition. Amounts effective for this use will depend on the severity and course of the disease or condition, previous therapy, the patient's health status, weight, and response to the drugs, and the judgment of the treating physician. [00326] In prophylactic applications, compositions containing the compounds described herein are administered to a patient susceptible to or otherwise at risk of a particular disease, disorder or condition. Such an amount is defined to be a "prophylactically effective amount or dose." In this use, the precise amounts also depend on the patient's state of health, weight, and the like. When used in a patient, effective amounts for this use will depend on the severity and course of the disease, disorder or condition, previous therapy, the patient's health status and response to the drugs, and the judgment of the treating physician. [00327] In the case wherein the patient’s condition does not improve, upon the doctor’s discretion the administration of the compounds may be administered chronically, that is, for an extended period of time, including throughout the duration of the patient’s life in order to ameliorate or otherwise control or limit the symptoms of the patient’s disease or condition. [00328] In the case wherein the patient’s status does improve, upon the doctor’s discretion the administration of the compounds may be given continuously; alternatively, the dose of drug being administered may be temporarily reduced or temporarily suspended for a certain length of time (i.e., a “drug holiday”). The length of the drug holiday can vary between 2 days and 1 year, including by way of example only, 2 days, 3 days, 4 days, 5 days, 6 days, 7 days, 10 days, 12 days, 15 days, 20 days, 28 days, 35 days, 50 days, 70 days, 100 days, 120 days, 150 days, 180 days, 200 days, 250 days, 280 days, 300 days, 320 days, 350 days, or 365 days. The dose reduction during a drug holiday may be from about 10% to about 100%, including, by way of example only, about 10%, about 15%, about 20%, about 25%, about 30%, about 35%, about 40%, about 45%, about 50%, about 55%, about 60%, about 65%, about 70%, about 75%, about 80%, about 85%, about 90%, about 95%, or about 100%. [00329] Once improvement of the patient's conditions has occurred, a maintenance dose is administered if necessary. Subsequently, the dosage or the frequency of administration, or both, can be reduced, as a function of the symptoms, to a level at which the improved disease, disorder or condition is retained. Patients can, however, require intermittent treatment on a long-term basis upon any recurrence of symptoms. [00330] The amount of a given agent that will correspond to such an amount will vary depending upon factors such as the particular compound, disease or condition and its severity, the identity (e.g., weight) of the subject or host in need of treatment, but can nevertheless be determined in a manner recognized in the field according to the particular circumstances surrounding the case, including, e.g., the specific agent being administered, the route of administration, the condition being treated, and the subject or host being treated. In general, however, doses employed for adult human treatment will typically be in the range of about 0.02 - about 5000 mg per day, in some embodiments, about 1 - about 1500 mg per day. The desired dose may conveniently be presented in a single dose or as divided doses administered simultaneously (or over a short period of time) or at appropriate intervals, for example as two, three, four or more sub-doses per day. [00331] The pharmaceutical composition described herein may be in unit dosage forms suitable for single administration of precise dosages. In unit dosage form, the formulation is divided into unit doses containing appropriate quantities of one or more compound. The unit dosage may be in the form of a package containing discrete quantities of the formulation. Non-limiting examples are packaged tablets or capsules, and powders in vials or ampoules. Aqueous suspension compositions can be packaged in single-dose non-reclosable containers. Alternatively, multiple-dose reclosable containers can be used, in which case it is typical to include a preservative in the composition. By way of example only, formulations for parenteral injection may be presented in unit dosage form, which include, but are not limited to ampoules, or in multi-dose containers, with an added preservative. [00332] The daily dosages appropriate for the compounds described herein described herein are from about 0.01 mg/kg to about 20 mg/kg. In one embodiment, the daily dosages are from about 0.1 mg/kg to about 10 mg/kg. An indicated daily dosage in the larger mammal, including, but not limited to, humans, is in the range from about 0.5 mg to about 1000 mg, conveniently administered in a single dose or in divided doses, including, but not limited to, up to four times a day or in extended release form. Suitable unit dosage forms for oral administration include from about 1 to about 500 mg active ingredient. In one embodiment, the unit dosage is about 1 mg, about 5 mg, about, 10 mg, about 20 mg, about 50 mg, about 100 mg, about 200 mg, about 250 mg, about 400 mg, or about 500 mg. The foregoing ranges are merely suggestive, as the number of variables in regard to an individual treatment regime is large, and considerable excursions from these recommended values are not uncommon. Such dosages may be altered depending on a number of variables, not limited to the activity of the compound used, the disease or condition to be treated, the mode of administration, the requirements of the individual subject, the severity of the disease or condition being treated, and the judgment of the practitioner. [00333] Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of such therapeutic regimens can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, including, but not limited to, the determination of the LD50 (the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED50 (the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between the toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio between LD50 and ED50. Compounds exhibiting high therapeutic indices are preferred. The data obtained from cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage for use in human. The dosage of such compounds lies preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include the ED50 with minimal toxicity. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. Combination Treatments [00334] The compounds of Formula (I), (II), (III) or (IV), and compositions thereof, may also be used in combination with other therapeutic agents that are selected for their therapeutic value for the condition to be treated. In general, the compositions described herein and, in embodiments where combinational therapy is employed, other agents do not have to be administered in the same pharmaceutical composition, and may, because of different physical and chemical characteristics, have to be administered by different routes. The determination of the mode of administration and the advisability of administration, where possible, in the same pharmaceutical composition, is well within the knowledge of the clinician. The initial administration can be made according to established protocols recognized in the field, and then, based upon the observed effects, the dosage, modes of administration and times of administration can be modified by the clinician. [00335] In certain instances, it may be appropriate to administer at least one compound described herein in combination with another therapeutic agent. By way of example only, if one of the side effects experienced by a patient upon receiving one of the compounds herein, such as a compound of Formula (I), (II), (III) or (IV), is nausea, then it may be appropriate to administer an anti-nausea agent in combination with the initial therapeutic agent. Or, by way of example only, the therapeutic effectiveness of one of the compounds described herein may be enhanced by administration of an adjuvant (i.e., by itself the adjuvant may have minimal therapeutic benefit, but in combination with another therapeutic agent, the overall therapeutic benefit to the patient is enhanced). Or, by way of example only, the benefit experienced by a patient may be increased by administering one of the compounds described herein with another therapeutic agent (which also includes a therapeutic regimen) that also has therapeutic benefit. In any case, regardless of the disease, disorder or condition being treated, the overall benefit experienced by the patient may simply be additive of the two therapeutic agents or the patient may experience a synergistic benefit. [00336] The particular choice of compounds used will depend upon the diagnosis of the attending physicians and their judgment of the condition of the patient and the appropriate treatment protocol. The compounds may be administered concurrently (e.g., simultaneously, essentially simultaneously or within the same treatment protocol) or sequentially, depending upon the nature of the disease, disorder, or condition, the condition of the patient, and the actual choice of compounds used. The determination of the order of administration, and the number of repetitions of administration of each therapeutic agent during a treatment protocol, is well within the knowledge of the physician after evaluation of the disease being treated and the condition of the patient. [00337] Therapeutically-effective dosages can vary when the drugs are used in treatment combinations. Methods for experimentally determining therapeutically-effective dosages of drugs and other agents for use in combination treatment regimens are described in the literature. For example, the use of metronomic dosing, i.e., providing more frequent, lower doses in order to minimize toxic side effects, has been described extensively in the literature Combination treatment further includes periodic treatments that start and stop at various times to assist with the clinical management of the patient. [00338] For combination therapies described herein, dosages of the co-administered compounds will of course vary depending on the type of co-drug employed, on the specific drug employed, on the disease or condition being treated and so forth. In addition, when co-administered with one or more biologically active agents, the compound provided herein may be administered either simultaneously with the biologically active agent(s), or sequentially. If administered sequentially, the attending physician will decide on the appropriate sequence of administering protein in combination with the biologically active agent(s). [00339] In any case, the multiple therapeutic agents (one of which is a compound of Formula (I), (II), (III), or (IV) described herein) may be administered in any order or even simultaneously. If simultaneously, the multiple therapeutic agents may be provided in a single, unified form, or in multiple forms (by way of example only, either as a single pill or as two separate pills). One of the therapeutic agents may be given in multiple doses, or both may be given as multiple doses. If not simultaneous, the timing between the multiple doses may vary from more than zero weeks to less than four weeks. In addition, the combination methods, compositions and formulations are not to be limited to the use of only two agents; the use of multiple therapeutic combinations are also envisioned. [00340] It is understood that the dosage regimen to treat, prevent, or ameliorate the condition(s) for which relief is sought, can be modified in accordance with a variety of factors. These factors include the disorder or condition from which the subject suffers, as well as the age, weight, sex, diet, and medical condition of the subject. Thus, the dosage regimen actually employed can vary widely and therefore can deviate from the dosage regimens set forth herein. [00341] The pharmaceutical agents which make up the combination therapy disclosed herein may be a combined dosage form or in separate dosage forms intended for substantially simultaneous administration. The pharmaceutical agents that make up the combination therapy may also be administered sequentially, with either therapeutic compound being administered by a regimen calling for two-step administration. The two-step administration regimen may call for sequential administration of the active agents or spaced-apart administration of the separate active agents. The time period between the multiple administration steps may range from, a few minutes to several hours, depending upon the properties of each pharmaceutical agent, such as potency, solubility, bioavailability, plasma half-life and kinetic profile of the pharmaceutical agent. Circadian variation of the target molecule concentration may also determine the optimal dose interval. [00342] In addition, the compounds described herein also may be used in combination with procedures that may provide additional or synergistic benefit to the patient. By way of example only, patients are expected to find therapeutic and/or prophylactic benefit in the methods described herein, wherein pharmaceutical composition of a compound disclosed herein and /or combinations with other therapeutics are combined with genetic testing to determine whether that individual is a carrier of a mutant gene that is known to be correlated with certain diseases or conditions. [00343] The compounds described herein and combination therapies can be administered before, during or after the occurrence of a disease or condition, and the timing of administering the composition containing a compound can vary. Thus, for example, the compounds can be used as a prophylactic and can be administered continuously to subjects with a propensity to develop conditions or diseases in order to prevent the occurrence of the disease or condition. The compounds and compositions can be administered to a subject during or as soon as possible after the onset of the symptoms. The administration of the compounds can be initiated within the first 48 hours of the onset of the symptoms, preferably within the first 48 hours of the onset of the symptoms, more preferably within the first 6 hours of the onset of the symptoms, and most preferably within 3 hours of the onset of the symptoms. The initial administration can be via any route practical, such as, for example, an intravenous injection, a bolus injection, infusion over about 5 minutes to about 5 hours, a pill, a capsule, transdermal patch, buccal delivery, and the like, or combination thereof. A compound is preferably administered as soon as is practicable after the onset of a disease or condition is detected or suspected, and for a length of time necessary for the treatment of the disease, such as, for example, from 1 day to about 3 months. The length of treatment can vary for each subject, and the length can be determined using the known criteria. For example, the compound or a formulation containing the compound can be administered for at least 2 weeks, preferably about 1 month to about 5 years. Inhibitors of SOCE [00344] In one aspect, compounds of Formula (I), (II), (III), or (IV) are administered or used in conjunction with other inhibitors of SOCE. In one aspect, the inhibitors of SOCE are ηοηselective inhibitors. [00345] A variety of inhibitors of SOCE have been described. Inhibitors of SOCE include: a) Cations, which include lanthanide cations, such as for example, Gd3+, La3+; b) P-450 inhibitors, which include econazole, miconazole, clotrimazole, ketoconazole; c) Cyclooxygenase inhibitors, which include niflumic acid, flufenamic acid, tenidap; d) Lipoxygenase inhibitors, which include nordihydroguaiaretic acid, eicosatetraynoic acid; ℮) Compounds that are channel blockers, which include SK&F 96365, SC38249, LU52396, L-651,582, tetrandrine, 2-ΑΡΒ; f) Compounds that inhibit SOCE not by an action on the SOC channels themselves, which include U73122 (phospholipase C inhibitor), wortmannin (phosphatidylinositol kinase inhibitor). [00346] Some of these inhibitors of SOCE have non-specific actions and/or multiple modes of action that contribute to the inhibition of SOCE, which include blocking the pore of the SOC channel (Channel blockers), inhibition of mitochondrial ATP synthesis that appears to support SOCE (Gamberucci et αℓ., JBiol. Chem., 269, 23597-23602, 1994; Marriott et αℓ., Am../. Physiol., 269, C766-C774, 1995), disturbances of cytoplasmic pH (Muallem et αℓ., Am. J.

Examples of pharmaceutical packaging materials include, but are not limited to, blister packs, bottles, tubes, inhalers, pumps, bags, vials, containers, syringes, bottles, and any packaging material suitable for a selected formulation and intended mode of administration and treatment. A wide array of formulations of the compounds and compositions provided herein are contemplated as are a variety of treatments for any disease, disorder, or condition that would benefit by inhibition of CRAC channel activity. [00362] For example, the container(s) can include one or more compounds described herein, optionally in a composition or in combination with another agent as disclosed herein. The container(s) optionally have a sterile access port (for example the container can be an intravenous solution bag or a vial having a stopper pierceable by a hypodermic injection needle). Such kits optionally comprising a compound with an identifying description or label or instructions relating to its use in the methods described herein. [00363] A kit will typically may include one or more additional containers, each with one or more of various materials (such as reagents, optionally in concentrated form, and/or devices) desirable from a commercial and user standpoint for use of a compound described herein.

Compositions containing a compound provided herein formulated in a compatible pharmaceutical carrier can also be prepared, placed in an appropriate container, and labeled for treatment of an indicated condition. Assays [00366] Several techniques may be used to evaluate store-operated calcium entry and calcium signaling in cells. Such techniques include, but are not limited to, patch clamp electrophysiology (measurement of calcium ions or other ions across cell membranes, such as plasma membranes), capacitance measurements (allows exocytosis to be followed at the level of single cells), calcium imaging using fluorescent dyes allows patterns of calcium movement within the cytoplasm to be tracked, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) enables protein-protein interactions to be evaluated, and molecular biology methods allow for the manipulation of the levels of expression of proteins of interest. [00367] A wide variety of assay methods may be used to examine the modulation of intracellular calcium by compounds of Formula (I), (II), or (III). Such assays include in vitro cell based assays as well as in vivo animal models. Any assays that detect, monitor or measure an effect on intracellular calcium, including calcium entry-mediated events can be used. Such assays include, but are not limited to, assays monitoring, measuring and/or detecting intracellular calcium levels, modulation of calcium levels, and movement of calcium into, out of or within cells and intracellular organelles. Assays can also include monitoring, measuring and/or detecting calcium entry-mediated events and molecules involved in calcium entry-mediated events such as, but not limited to, signal transduction molecules, transcription factors, secreted molecules and other molecules that are affected by changes in calcium homeostasis. Assays include, but are not limited to, those described herein and those described in US patent publication no. 2007/0031814 and WO 07/081804, herein incorporated by reference. Cells and Cell Models [00368] For in vitro testing of the modulation of intracellular calcium by compounds of Formula (I), (II), (III) or (IV), a wide variety of cell types for such assays are available. In a particular embodiment, the cell is one in which store-operated calcium entry occurs or that can be manipulated such that store-operated calcium entry occurs in the cell. In particular embodiments, the cell contains one or more proteins involved in modulating intracellular calcium (and, in particular, is involved in, participates in and/or provides for store-operated calcium entry, movement of calcium into, out of or within an intracellular organelle or calcium store, modulation of calcium levels in an intracellular organelle or calcium store (e.g., endoplasmic reticulum) and/or calcium buffering), such as those provided herein. In particular embodiments, the protein(s) include STIM proteins (including STIM1, STIM2, DSTIM and CSTIM protein) and/or Orai proteins (Orail, Orai2, Orai3). The cell may endogenously express the protein(s) or recombinantly express the protein(s). [00369] Cells for use in the methods may be of any species. In one embodiment, the cells can be eukaryotic cells. In one embodiment, the cells can be yeast, insect (e.g., Drosophila or Anopheles), or mammalian cells. Mammalian cells include, but are not limited to, rodent (e.g., mouse, rat and hamster), primate, monkey, dog, bovine, rabbit and human cells. A variety of cell types can be used in the methods, including, for example, neuronal, nervous system, brain, immune system cells, e.g., Τ lymphocytes and Β cells, primary cells, blood and hematopoietic cells, stromal cells, myeloid cells, lymphoid cells, and a variety of tumor and cancer cells. Particular cells include Drosophila Schneider 2 or S2 cells, human embryonic kidney (ΗΕΚ293) cells, rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells, Jurkat cells, epithelial cells, rhabdomyosarcoma cells, rhabdoid cells, retinoblastoma cells, neuroepithelioma cells, neuroblastoma cells, osteosarcoma cells, fibroblasts, bone marrow stroma cells, erythroleukemia cells and lymphoblast cells. Other cell lines include ΗΕΚ 293 and 293Τ, CHO (including CHO-K1), LTK-, Ν2Α, Η6, and HGB. Many such cells and cell lines are available through cell depositories such as, for example, the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, Va.). Primary cells can be obtained by isolation from tissue sources. [00370] Cells from a known cell line can be used, such as neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells, pheochromocytoma PC 12 cells, neuroblastoma SK-N-BE(2)C or SK-N-SH cells, human SK-N-MC neuroepithelioma cells, SMS-KCNR cells, human LAN-5 neuroblastoma cells, human GI-CA-N neuroblastoma cells, human GOTO neuroblastoma cells, mouse Neuro 2a (Ν2Α) neuroblastoma cells and/or human IMR 32 neuroblastoma cells, chronic myeloid leukemia cells (e.g., human Κ562 cells), promyelocytic leukemia cells (e.g., HL60 cells) and histiocytic lymphoma cells (e.g., U937 cells), Burkitt's lymphoma cells (e.g., CA46 cells), B-cells (e.g., NALM6), acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells (e.g., MOLT4 cells), Τ cells (e.g. Jurkat cells) and early T-ALL (e.g., DU528) cells. [00371] In one embodiment, the choice of a cell for use in an in vitro assay to test the modulation of intracellular calcium by compounds described herein involves several considerations, including, for example, a particular protein that is being used in the method and a particular aspect or activity of intracellular calcium modulation that is being monitored or assessed in the method. [00372] In one embodiment, the modulation of intracellular calcium by a compound described herein, is examined by monitoring or assessing the effect on store-operated calcium entry. Cells typically used in such methods exhibit store-operated calcium entry either naturally or through manipulation of the cells. Cells that endogenously exhibit store-operated calcium entry include some excitable cells and most non-excitable cells and can be identified using methods described herein and/or recognized in the field. [00373] In one embodiment, it may be desirable to utilize a cell that contains components of signaling and messenger systems that can effect release of calcium from intracellular stores. For example, cells containing components of receptor-mediated phospholipase C (PLC) activation systems can be used for physiological activation (via generation of IP3) of store depletion to facilitate monitoring of store-operated calcium entry. Receptor-mediated PLC activation occurs through distinct coupling mechanisms: PLC-P activation by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and PLC-y activation by tyrosine kinase receptors and nonreceptor tyrosine kinases. Thus, cells containing a receptor-mediated PLC-activation system can be monitored or assessed for store-operated calcium entry upon agonist activation of one or more receptors known to participate in the system, (see e.g. Bouron (2000) FEBS Lett 470:269-272; Millar et αℓ. (1995)./. Exp. Biol. 198:1843-1850; Yagodin et αℓ. (1998) Cell Calcium 23:219-228; Yagodin et αℓ. (1999) Cell Calcium 25:429-438; and Patterson et αℓ. (2002) Cell 111:1 -20). [00374] An assessment of intracellular calcium after treatment with a compound described herein can be made under a variety of conditions. Conditions can be selected to evaluate the effect of test agent on a specific aspect of intracellular calcium. For example, reagents and conditions are used, for specifically evaluating store-operated calcium entry, resting cytosolic calcium levels, calcium buffering, and calcium levels of and calcium uptake by or release from intracellular organelles. Resting cytosolic calcium levels, intracellular organelle calcium levels and cation movement may be assessed using any of the methods described herein or recognized in the field. Such methods of assessing modulation in intracellular calcium include, but are not limited to, calcium-sensitive indicator-based measurements, such as fluo-3, mag-firra 2 and ER-targeted aequorin, labeled calcium (such as 45Ca2+)-based measurements, and electrophysiological measurements. Particular aspects of ion flux that may be assessed include, but are not limited to, a reduction (including elimination) in the amount of ion flux, altered biophysical properties of the ion current, and altered sensitivities of the flux to activators or inhibitors of calcium flux processes, such as, for example, store-operated calcium entry. Reagents and conditions for use in specifically evaluating receptor-mediated calcium movement and second messenger-operated calcium movement are also available. Evaluation of Store-Operated Calcium Entry [00375] In one aspect, compounds described herein are added to cells under conditions that permit store-operated calcium entry to occur in order to assess the effects of Formulas (1)-(1Π) on store-operated calcium entry. Such conditions are described herein and are recognized in the field. [00376] For example, in one method cells may be treated to reduce the calcium levels of intracellular calcium stores and then analyzed for evidence of ion (e.g., calcium) influx in response thereto in the presence of a compound described herein. Techniques for reducing calcium levels of intracellular stores and for analyzing cells for evidence of ion (e.g., calcium) influx are recognized in the field and described herein. [00377] In other methods, electrophysiological analysis of currents across a cell-detached plasma membrane patch or an outside-out membrane vesicle may be used to detect or monitor store-operated channel currents (e.g., Isoc, Icrac) in the presence of a compound described herein. Evaluation of Calcium Entry-Mediated Events [00378] A number of molecules involved in calcium-regulated pathways are known. Evaluation of molecules involved in calcium-entry mediated events can be used to monitor intracellular calcium, and can be used, for example in screening assays described herein to monitor the effects of the compounds presented herein. Examples of assays include but are not limited to assays which detect, or determine the presence, levels, alteration of levels, production, modification (such as phosphorylation and dephosphorylation), translocation, degradation and activity of molecules involved in calcium-entry mediated events (see for example, Trevillyan et αℓ. (2001)./. Biol. Chem. 276:48118-26). The assays described herein can be used with cells that have been treated with or contacted with a compound presented herein, or that express an altered amount of a test molecule (such as a protein involved in calcium regulation, including a STIM protein, Orai protein), or with control cells. The assays can also be conducted in cells that have been stimulated with a physiological or non-physiological activator, or in unstimulated cells. The following are representative assays for molecules involved in calcium-entry mediated events and are meant to be exemplary only. Other assays for these molecules and assays for other molecules involved in calcium-entry mediated events can also be employed in any of the screening and/or modulation methods described herein. B-hexosaminirtase Release [00379] In mast cells, Ca2+ influx results in degranulation and release of inflammatory mediators such as heparin, histamine and enzymes such as ^-hexosaminidase. Detecting and/or measuring release of such molecules can thus be used to monitor intracellular calcium For example, media from mast cells can be collected. A suitable substrate for β-hexosaminidase (e.g. ρ-nitrophenyl-acetyl-glucosamide) can then be added and the absorbance of the resulting mixture assessed to measure the relative amount of fl-hcxosaminidasc activity in the samples (Funaba et αℓ. (2003) Cell Biol. International 27:879-85). Calcium/Calmodulin-Dependent CaN Phosphatase Activity [00380] The phosphatase calcineurin (CaN) dephosphorylates various proteins, affecting their activity and localization. CaN activity can be assessed by incubating purified CaN and a CaN substrate, for example a radiolabeled peptide corresponding to a sequence in the RII subunit of cAMP-dependent kinase, either with or without a compound of Formula (I), (II), (III), or (IV) (see, Trevillyan et αℓ. (2001)./. Biol. Chem 276:48118-26). The level of radiolabeled peptide and/or the amount of free inorganic phosphate released can be measured to assess CaN dephosphorylation activity. NFAT Transcriptional Activity [00381] The NFAT (nuclear factor of activated Τ cells) transcription factor regulates a number of genes in response to intracellular calcium levels. For example, NFAT proteins regulate the transcription of cytokine genes involved in the immune response. Promoters fromNFAT-regulated genes, and/or regulatory regions and elements from these genes, can be used to monitor NFAT regulated expression and thereby monitor intracellular calcium. Reporter gene fusions can be constructed with NFAT regulated promoters or NFAT-regulated elements operably linked to a reporter gene such as luciferase, P-galactosidasc, green fluorescent protein (GFP) or any other known reporter in the art (see for example, Published U.S. Application no. 2002-0034728). The amount of reporter protein or activity is a measure of NFAT activity. NFAT Phosphorylation [00382] NFAT activation is regulated primarily through its phosphorylation, which in turn regulates its subcellular localization. In unstimulated cells, NFAT is a hyperphosphorylated cytosolic protein. An elevation in intracellular Ca2+, induced by a variety of mechanisms, increases the activity of the Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent phosphatase, calcineurin. Activated calcineurin dephosphorylates multiple serine residues within the regulatory region of the NFAT molecule. NFAT is rephosphorylated in response to decreases in Ca2+ levels or CaN inhibition. [00383] The phosphorylation state of NFAT can be monitored for example, by expressing a detectably tagged NFAT protein in cells, such as a His6 tagged-NFAT. Tagged NFAT can be purified from cells using Ni2+ chromatography and subjected to gel electrophoresis and staining or western blotting. More highly phosphorylated forms of NFAT can be distinguished by their slower migration. The state of phosphorylated NFAT can be used as a measure of NFAT activation (see, Trevillyan et αℓ. (2001)./. Biol. Chem 276:48118-26). NFAT Nuclear Localization [00384] NFAT localization between the cytoplasm and nucleus is regulated by the phosphorylation state of NFAT. Phosphorylation of NFAT prevents nuclear localization by masking the nuclear localization sequence. NFAT nuclear localization can be monitored, for example, by expressing fluorescently tagged NFAT, for example, GFP-NFAT, in cells. Confocal microscopy can be used to monitor nuclear localization of the tagged NFAT (see, Trevillyan et αℓ. (2001)./. Biol. Chem 276:48118-26). Cytokine Secretion [00385] Cytokine secretion, such as IL-2 secretion, can be monitored using protein detection assays. For example, supernatant can be collected from immune cells. An ELISA assay or other suitable format with IL-2 antibodies can be used to detect and/or measure the amount of IL-2 secreted as compared to control cells. Secretion of other cytokines, for example, TNF-a, can also be detected in similar assays. Cytokine Expression [00386] Expression of cytokines, such as, but not limited to IL-2, can be assessed either directly or indirectly in cells. For example, in indirect methods, an IL-2 promoter can be operably linked to a reporter gene such as luciferase or [Tgalactosidasc, and the reporter construct introduced into cells. Reporter gene expression can be monitored and compared to gene expression in control cells (see, Trevillyan et αℓ. (2001) J. Biol. Chem 276:48118-26). Alternatively, expression of endogenous or recombinant IL-2 mRNA or protein can be assessed. Τ Cell Proliferation [00387] Cytokines such as IL-2 are necessary for T-cell proliferation in response to mitogen or alloantigen stimulation, and thus T-cell proliferation is altered by changes in cytokine expression or secretion. Τ cells can be induced, such as with concanavalin A or alloreactive lymphocytes and Τ cell proliferation measured, for example, by subjecting cells to a pulse of 3H-thymidine and measuring 3H-thymidine incorporation (see, Trevillyan et al. (2001) J. Biol. Chem 276:48118-26). [00388] In some embodiments, the modulation (e.g. inhibition or reduction) of SOCE by compounds presented herein are determined by evaluation of any of the following criteria: a. there is direct inhibition of increased [Ca2+]i as measured by a calcium indicator; b. there is a direct inhibition of Isoc or ICrac as measured by patch clamp; c. there is inhibition of downstream signaling functions such as calcineurin activity, NFAT subcellular localization, NFAT phosphorylation, and/or cytokine, e.g., IL-2, production; or d. there are modifications in activation-induced cell proliferation, differentiation and/or apoptotic signaling pathways. Animal Models [00389] Animal models that can be used in embodiments of the methods further include animals, such as, but not limited to non-human animals, which have, in at least some of their cells, an alteration or defect in, or aberrant functioning of, a cellular process which relies on or is regulated by intracellular calcium. Cellular processes that rely on or are regulated by intracellular calcium include, for example, cellular activation, gene expression, cellular trafficking, and apoptosis. Diseases/disorders that involve defects that may be at least partially compensated for by modulation of intracellular calcium include, but are not limited to: autoimmune disorders, including rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, Sjogren's syndrome (cytokines associated with lymphocyte invasion of salivary epithelial cells can reduce calcium mobilization in parotid cells; also, T-cell activation, including activation of transcription factors, cytokine gene expression and cell proliferation, depends on sustained elevation of intracellular calcium level provided by store-operated calcium influx), asthma (store-operated calcium entry may play an important role in mediating bronchial chonstriction and bronchial smooth muscle cell proliferation), glomerulonephritis and glomerular inflammation (changes in intracellular calcium, such as by store-operated calcium entry, signal monocyte adhesion in a co-culture model of glomerular inflammation). [00390] Types of animal models include, but are not limited to, non-human animals, such as non-human invertebrates and vertebrates and non-human mammals, rodents (e.g., mice, rat and hamster), cows, chickens, pigs, goats, dogs, sheep, insects, Drosophila, nematodes, worms, C. elegans, monkeys, gorillas, and other primates. [00391] Animal models include transgenic and non-transgenic animals. One example of such an animal model that can be used in particular embodiments of the methods is a rodent model of airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), a characteristic of asthma. This model can be generated, for example, by sensitization through immunization with ovalbumin followed by exposure to aerosolized ovalbumin and challenge by cholinergic stimulation (e.g., via administration of methacholine or acetylcholine) (see, e.g., Xu et αℓ. (2002)./. Αρρℓ. Physiol. 93:1833-1840; Humbles et αℓ (2002) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 99:1479-1484). Airway hyperresponsiveness (which can be evaluated using methods, such as for e.g., using barometric plethysmography to record respiratory pressure curves and through measurement of pulmonary parameters such as pulmonary conductance and pulmonary compliance) can be assessed and compared in animals treated and not treated with a compound presented herein. A further example of an animal model that can be used in particular embodiments of the methods is a rodent model of mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis, which can be generated, for example, by administration of anti-Thyl.l antibody (see, e.g., Jefferson and Johnson (1999) J. Nephrol. 12:297-307). Any number of parameters indicative of glomerulonephritis or renal dysfunction (e.g., mesangial cell proliferation, blood pressure, urinary protein excretion, creatinine clearance, glomerulosclerosis index and other parameters) can be evaluated and compared in animals treated with and not treated with test agent. The non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse, an inbred mouse strain that spontaneously develops autoimmune diabetes that shares many immunogenetic features with Type 1 diabetes mellitus, is another example of an animal model that can be used in a particular embodiment of the methods. These mice also manifest many characteristics of autoimmune exocrinopathy (such as Sjorgen's syndrome) including declining exocrine tissue secretory function (see, e.g., Humphreys-Beher and Peck (1999) Arch. Oral Biol. 44 Suppl 1 :S21 -25 andBrayer et αℓ. (2000) J Rheumatol. 27:1896-1904). Characteristics relevant to Sjorgen's syndrome (e.g., lymphocytic infiltrates in exocrine glands (e.g., salivary and lacrimal glands), presence of dendritic cells and macrophages in submandibular glands, integrity of the lacrimal gland by measurement of basal and stimulated tear secretion, saliva flow rates and amylase activity) can be evaluated and compared in animals treated with and not treated with a compound described herein. An animal (e.g., rodent) model of autoimmune disease can also be used in particular embodiments of the methods. Such animals include rat models available through the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Autoimmune Rat Model Repository and Development Center (Bethesda, Md.; accessible at www.ors.od.nih.gov/dirs/vrp/ratcenter). One rat model of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and related chronic/inflammatory autoimmune diseases is the collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model (see, e.g., Griffiths andRemmers (2001) Immunol. Rev. 184:172-183). Characteristic phenotypes of autoimmune disease (e.g. altered levels of immune reactivity to selfantigens, chronic inflammation of autoantigen-expressing target organs, and activation and participation of invading mononuclear cells and tissue fibroblasts in organ damage) can be evaluated and compared in animals treated with and not treated with a compound presented herein. An animal (e.g., rodent) model of neuropathic or inflammatory pain can also be used in a particular embodiment of the methods. For example, one rat model of neuropathic pain involves development of tactile allodynia (exaggerated response to otherwise innocuous stimuli) after ligation of lumbar spinal nerves (see, e.g., Chaplan et αℓ. (1994) J. Neurosci. Methods 53:55-63 and Luo et αℓ. (2001) J. Neurosci. 21:1868-1875). Tactile allodynia, one characteristic feature of neuropathic pain, can be evaluated (e.g., by evaluating paw withdrawal threshold in response to application of pressure) and compared in animals treated and not treated with a compound described herein.

The initial baseline fluorescence signal is then measured with a FLIPR384 (Molecular Devices) plate reader. Calcium entry is initiated by adding 5 pi of 10Χ CaCl2 (10 mM) in HBSS, and changes in cellular fluorescence are measured with the FLIPR384 plate reader. In each well, the magnitude of the fluorescence signal as a result of calcium entry into the cell is determined by calculating the difference between the peak fluorescence signal measured after calcium addition and the initial baseline fluorescence signal (designated Peak-Basal). IC5o values are typically calculated as the concentration that inhibited 50% of the Peak-Basal signal. Β. Fluorescence-based Assay of Store-Operated Calcium Entry in RBL-2H3 Cells. Cells: [00525] RBL-2H3 cells are obtained from ATCC and maintained in complete medium with 10% FBS at 37°C /6% C02. Assay: [00526] The day prior to performing the assay, RBL-2H3 cells are plated in 50 pL of complete medium in a 384 well plate. Cells are grown at 37°C/6% C02 overnight and grow to 50-60 % confluence by the next day. On the assay day, 1.5 μΜ Fluo-4-AM dye (Invitrogen) in complete medium is added and incubated for 1 hour at RT. Cells are washed twice in Ca2+-free HBSS buffer and 35 pL Ca2+-free HBSS buffer is added to each well. 10 pL of a test compound prepared in a Ca2+-free HBSS solution at 4.5Χ of the desired concentration is added to a well and incubated for 5 minutes at RT. 10 pL of thapsigargin prepared in a Ca2+-free HBSS solution at 5.5Χ of the desired concentration (5.5 uM) is added to each well and incubated for an additional 25 minutes. The initial baseline fluorescence signal is measured with a FLIPR384 (Molecular Devices) plate reader. 5 pL of 12Χ calcium in HBSS (12 mM) is added and changes in cellular fluorescence are measured with the FLIPR384 plate reader. In each well, the change in the fluorescent signal as a function of time due to calcium entry into the cell is determined by calculating the difference between the fluorescent signal measured 7 seconds after calcium addition and the initial baseline fluorescence signal at time zero (t = 0). This parameter is designated Upslope. The IC5o value is calculated as the concentration at which 50% of the Upslope is inhibited. C. Fluorescence-based Assay of Store-Operated Calcium Entry in Jurkat Cells. Cells: [00527] Jurkat Ε6-1 cells are obtained from ATCC and maintained in complete medium with 10% FBS at 37°C /6% C02. Assay: [00528] The day prior to performing the assay, Jurkat Ε6-1 cells are seeded at a density of 2 million cells/mL in complete medium in a T-175 flask. Cells are grown at 37°C/6% C02 overnight. On the following day, 1.5 ρΜ Fluo-4-AM dye (Invitrogen) in complete medium is added and incubated for 1 hour at RT. Cells are harvested, washed twice in Ca2+-free HBSS buffer and plated in 35 pL Ca2+-free HBSS buffer in a 384 well plate. 10 pL of a test compound prepared in a Ca2+free HBSS solution at 4.5Χ of the desired concentration is added to a well and incubated for 5 minutes at RT. 10 pL of thapsigargin prepared in a Ca2+-free HBSS solution at 5.5Χ of the desired (5.5 uM) is added to each well and incubated for an additional 25 minutes. The initial fluorescence signal is measured with a FLIPR384 (Molecular Devices) plate reader. 5 pL of 12Χin HBSS (12 mM) is added and changes in cellular fluorescence are measured with the plate reader. In each well, the change in the fluorescent signal as a function of time due to entry into the cell is determined by calculating the difference between the fluorescent signal 7 seconds after calcium addition and the initial baseline fluorescence signal at time zero (t = 0).parameter is designated Upslope. The IC5o value is calculated as the concentration at 50% of the Upslope is inhibited. A.

Test and Control Articles [00530] Formulation: Test article stock solutions are prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and stored frozen. Test article concentrations are prepared fresh daily by diluting stock solutions into an appropriate external recording buffer. If necessary, test article formulations are sonicated (Model 2510, Branson Ultrasonics, Danbury, CT), at ambient room temperature to facilitate dissolution. In certain instances, the test solutions contain up to 0.1% DMSO and the presence of 0.1% DMSO does not affect channel current. Test Article Concentrations and Quantity [00531] Typically, the effects of three (3) concentrations of each test article are evaluated (0.1, 1, and 10 μΜ). Test articles are weighed and prepared as 30 mM or 10 mM stock solutions in DMSO. The DMSO stock is diluted in external recording buffer to prepare a 10 μΜ test solution (final DMSO 0.03% or 0.1%). The 10 μΜ test solution is diluted in external recording buffer to prepare 1 μΜ and 0.1 μΜ test solutions. Test solutions contain up to 0.1% DMSO at the highest concentration which are diluted in test solutions at lower concentrations. Positive Control Article [00532] Stock solutions of the positive control article are prepared in batches, aliquoted for individual use, stored frozen and used within six months. The positive control concentration is prepared fresh daily by diluting stock solutions into external recording buffer. The final DMSO concentration in the test positive control article is up to 0.1% of the solution. Negative Control Article [00533] The negative control article is 0.1% DMSO in external recording buffer. Cloned Ion Channel Test Systems [00534] Cells are maintained in tissue culture incubators per CalciMedica standard protocols. Stocks are maintained in cryogenic storage. Cells used for electrophysiology are plated in plastic tissue culture dishes. ΗΕΚ293 Cells [00535] ΗΕΚ293 cells are stably transfected with the appropriate ion channel cDNAs (Orail/STIMl). Cells are cultured in DMEM (Gibco 11960) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco 10082), 100 U/mL penicillin G sodium, 1 mM Na pyruvate (Gibco 11360), 100 pg/mL streptomycin sulfate (Gibco 10378), 0.5 mg/ml geneticin (Gibco 10131-035) and 50 pg/ml zeocin (Invitrogen 45-0430). Cells should be maintained at <80% confluence. The day before testing, cells in culture dishes are washed once with calcium/magnesium-free D-PBS, treated with trypsin/EDTA and re-suspended in the culture media and counted. Cells are then diluted in culture medium with 1% fetal bovine serum and plated at low density (5-10Κ) onto poly-D-lysine coated glass coverslips in 24-well tissue culture dishes and placed in a tissue culture incubator set at 37°C in a humidified 95% air, 6% CO2 atmosphere. Test Methods Recording Chamber and Perfusion of Test Articles [00536] Glass coverslips containing cells are transferred to a recording chamber (Warner Instruments) with continuous perfusion of external recording buffer. During recordings of Icrac, all treatments are delivered by gravity-fed bath perfusion from disposable syringe reservoirs via disposable polyethylene tubing feeding into a Teflon manifold. The flow rate is set between 1.2-1.5 ml/min assuring complete solution exchange in ~1 min. All experiments are performed at ambient temperature. Test Article Treatment Groups [00537] For experiments where the test article is applied for 10 minutes the treatment paradigm is summarized in Table 2. Control recording buffer is perfused for five (5) minutes while Icrac develops and a stable baseline is established; each cell is used as its own control. Each test article is applied to naive cells (η > 2, where η = the number cells/concentration; at 1 concentration/cell) for a duration of ten (10) minutes (Table 2). The test article is washed off for ten (10) minutes to look for reversibility of the effect. External recording saline with no calcium is perfused for two (2) minutes to determine the background current in the absence of Icrac- Control saline containing calcium is reapplied for three (3) minutes. [00538] For experiments where the test article is applied for 30 minutes prior to recording of Icrac, the treatment paradigm is summarized in Table 3. Prior to the start of each experiment, cells are incubated with compound for 30 minutes at room temperature, and compound remains present throughout Icrac recordings. Control cells are exposed to vehicle only. After break-in and establishment of the whole-cell patch clamp configuration, recording buffer ± compound is perfused for ten (10) minutes. At the end of the 10 min period the amplitude of Icrac is measured. The effects of compounds are determined by comparing the Icrac signal in cells pretreated with compound to the signal in cells pretreated with vehicle. Table 2.

This is used to monitor the magnitude of rundown of Icrac- As a positive control, 1 μΜ of 4-(4-bromophenyl)-2-(3-fluorobenzamido)thiophene-3-carboxylic acid is routinely applied to naive cells (η > 2, where η = the number cells). Whole Cell Patch Clamp Procedures [00540] Standard whole cell patch clamp procedures are used. The compositions of the extracellular and intracellular solutions are shown in Tables 4 and 5. Cells are visualized on an inverted microscope (Olympus 1X71) and voltage clamped using a Multiclamp 700Β amplifier and PClamp software (Axon Instruments). Briefly, borosilicate patch pipettes filled with intracellular solution (Appendix 1) are positioned onto the cell membrane. Once a GO seal is formed, suction is applied until the patch ruptures and the whole cell configuration is established. The quality of the configuration will be evaluated with the “membrane test” in Clampex to determine cell capacitance (Cm), input resistance (Rm), access resistance (Ra), and holding current at -50 mV (Ih). Data are stored on the CalciMedica computer network (and backed-up nightly) for off-line analysis. Table 4. Extracellular Solution Composition (concentration in mM) NaCl 120 TEA-C1 10 HEPES 10 CaC12 10 (and 0) MgC12 2 (and 12) glucose 10 [00541] The pH is adjusted to 7.2 with NaOH and the final osmolarity is adjusted to 325 with sucrose. Solutions are prepared daily. Chemicals used in solution preparation are purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO), unless otherwise noted, and are of ACS reagent grade purity or higher. Table 5. Intracellular Solution Composition (concentration in mM) Cs-glutamate 120 HEPES 10 ΒΑΡΤΑ 20 MgC12 3 [00542] The pH is adjusted to 7.2 with CsOH. Solutions are prepared in batches, aliquoted, and refrigerated until use. A fresh aliquot is used each day and stored on ice throughout the day. Chemicals used in solution preparation are purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO), unless otherwise noted, and are of ACS reagent grade. 1γκαγ Test Procedures [00543] Icrac from the Orail/STIMl channel complex is activated by passive depletion of intracellular calcium stores using 20 mM ΒΑΡΤΑ in the intracellular solution. Voltage clamp data is acquired using Clampex software to elicit a stimulus voltage protocol (shown in Table 6) applied every six (6) seconds. Currents are digitized at 10 kHz and filtered at 2 kHz. Whole cell capacitive compensation is employed. Representative Icrac traces are shown in Figure 2. Table 6. Voltage Clamp Protocol Voltage Description Vh +30 mV to minimize calcium entry in-between sweeps Vstep to 0 mV for 10 ms to evaluate “zero” current Vstep to -100 mV for 10 ms to measure Icrac at high driving force Vramp to +100 mV over 50 ms to monitor inwardly rectifying profile of Icrac Vstep to +50 mV for 10 ms to estimate leak current Data Analysis [00544] Data analysis is performed using Clamp fit software. Icrac is measured at -100 mV and the current measured after 5 min is used as the baseline control. For 10-minute application studies, the current measured after 10 min application of the test article is normalized to the baseline current and expressed as % control. For 40-min application studies, the current measured at the end of 10 minutes of Icrac recording time is used as the comparator. The current measured in “0 calcium” buffer is used to subtract background leak current. Data points for each test article concentration (η > 2) are fitted to a sigmoid function (SigmaPlot) to determine the IC5o and Hill slope.

Assay: a) Stimulation with 1 μΜ thapsigargin/20 ηΜ ΤΡΑ [00546] The day prior to performing the assay, RBL-2H3 cells are plated in a 96 well plate. Cells are grown at 37°C/6% C02 overnight. On the following day, cells are washed twice in HBSS Buffer with 1.8 mM CaC12 and 1.75% fetal bovine serum (FBS). 70 pL of a test compound prepared in HBSS Buffer with 1.8 mM CaC12 + 1.75% FBS is added and incubated for 10 minutes at 37°C/6% C02. Cells are stimulated by the addition of 7 pL of 1IX thapsigargin/TPA (11 μΜ thapsigargin/220 ηΜ TP A) and incubated at 37°C/6% C02 for 120 minutes. Media is collected and cell lysates are prepared by the addition of 70 pL of 0.05% Triton X-100 in HBSS with 1.8 mM CaC12. Levels of (i-hcxosaminidasc are measured in both the media and the cell lysates.

The percentage of β -hexosaminidase released is calculated as follows: Α405 (media)/[A405 (media) + Α405 (lysate)]. The IC5o value is calculated as the concentration at which 50% of the β -hexosaminidase released in vehicle treated cells is inhibited. b) Stimulation with IgE-DNP [00547] The day prior to performing the assay, RBL-2H3 cells are plated in 200 pL of complete medium in a 96 well plate for 1 hour. 20 pL of 1IX DNP-IgE are added and cells are grown at 37°C/6% C02 overnight.

Cells are stimulated by the addition of 7 pL of 1IX DNP-BSA and incubated at 37°C/6% C02 for 30 minutes. Media is collected and cell lysates are prepared by the addition of 70 ul of 0.05% Triton X-100 in HBSS with 1.8 mM CaCT. Levels of β -hexosaminidase are measured in both the media and the cell lysates. The β-hexosaminidase assay is performed by adding 40 pL of 1 mM ρ-nitrophenyl-acetyl-glucosamide substrate in 0.05Μ sodium citrate (pH 4.5) to 10 pL of sample (conditioned medium or cell lysate), incubating 60 minutes at 37°C, then adding 100 pL 0.05Μ sodium carbonate/0.05Μ sodium bicarbonate (pH 10.5), mixing thoroughly and reading the absorbance at 405 nm. The percentage of β -hexosaminidase released is calculated as follows: Α405 (media)/[A405 (media) + Α405 (lysate)]. The IC5o value is calculated as the concentration at which 50% of the β -hexosaminidase released in vehicle treated cells is inhibited.

Assay: [00549] The day prior to performing the assay, Jurkat Τ cells are plated in 90 pL of HBSS Buffer with 1.8 mM CaCF and 1.75% fetal bovine serum (FBS) in a 96 well plate at a density of 1.5x105 cells/well for 3 hours. 10 pL of 10Χ test compound prepared in HBSS is added and incubated for 10 minutes at 37°C/6% C02. Cells are stimulated by the addition of 10 pL of 1IX ΡΗΑ/ΤΡΑ (27.5 pg/mL PHA/880 ηΜ ΤΡΑ) and incubated at 37°C/6% CO2 for 20 hours. On the following day, the supernatants are collected and assayed for IL-2 levels by ELISA according to the manufacturer’s protocols.

Example 89 Dose-Response Effects of a compound of Formula (I), (II), (III) or (IV), CSA or Rapamycin in Mouse Footpad DTH: [00550] Purpose: Determine dose-response effects of Test Compound on mBSA induced DTH response in foot pads when dosing is done during the sensitization as well as induction phase. [00551] Animals: Male Swiss Webster Mice approx. 20-25 grams at start of study. [00552] Materials: Methylated BSA (Sigma) Freund’s complete adjuvant (Difco) plus supplemental Μ. tuberculosis Η37 RA (Difco). [00553] General Study Design: Mice are anesthetized with Isoflurane and given intradermal antigen injections of 0.1 ml at the base of the tail (DO, D07). Antigen is prepared by making a 4 mg/ml solution in sterile water. Equal volumes of antigen and Freund’s complete adjuvant to which 4 mg/ml ΜΤΒ are added (sonicate for 5 minutes after adding ΜΤΒ to oil), are emulsified by hand mixing until a bead of this material holds its form when placed in water. Treatment with test compound is initiated on day 0, qd (24 hr intervals) and continued through day 10 when challenge is done. [00554] On day 10 animals are injected into the right hind footpad with 20μ1 of lOmg/ml mBSA. Five unsensitized males are injected with mBSA into the footpad. Twenty-four hours later (day 11) the right and left hind paws are transected at the medial and lateral malleolus and weighed and the weight difference induced by injection of antigen is determined. [00555] Statistical Analysis. Paw weights (mean±SE) for each group are analyzed for differences using a Student’s t test or ANOVA with Dunnett’s post test. Statistical significance is set atp<0.05.

Example 90 Pharmacokinetic Data of a Compound of Formula (I), (II), (III), or (IV) in Rats: [00557] The bioavailability and plasma pharmacokinetic properties in rats of Compound of Formula (I), (II), (III), or (IV) administered orally in 25% PEG400/20% ethanoP55% H20 vehicle. Two treatment groups, 1) an i.v. dose group at 2 mg/kg; and 2) an oral dose group at 10 mg/kg are administered to Male Sprague-Dawley rats (3 rats per group), weighing approximately 250-300 gm. Up to 10 time points are collected for each group. Typical time points are: predose, 15, 30 minutes, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 24 hrs. Up to 300 pL of whole blood are collected via jugular vein cannula at each time point. Whole blood is collected into anticoagulant containing microcentrifuge tubes and centrifuged at 5000 rpm in a microcentrifuge for 5 minutes before plasma is transferred to a clean microcentrifuge tube. The plasma samples undergo bioanalytical analysis. Example 91 Effect of Compound of Formula (I), (II), (III), or (IV) in Rat Collagen Induced Arthritis (CIA) model: [00558] Purpose: Determine efficacy of Test Compound administered by oral dosing qd, in inhibiting the inflammation, cartilage destruction and bone resorption of developing type II collagen arthritis in rats. [00559] Animals: Female Lewis rats (Charles River#7246950), weighing 125-150 g at the start of the study. 40 rats are injected with collagen to get solid responders on days 10 and 11. Four nonimmunized animals serve as normal controls. [00560] Materials: Test Compound, Type II collagen, Freund’s incomplete adjuvant, acetic acid. Test Compound is prepared at a concentration of 10 mg/ml in 50% PEG400 / 50% water. Collagen is prepared by making a 4 mg/ml solution in 0.01Ν Acetic acid. Equal volumes of collagen and Freund’s incomplete adjuvant, are emulsified by hand mixing until a bead of this material holds its form when placed in water. [00561] General Study Design: Animals (10 rats/group for arthritis, 4 rats/group for normal control). [00562] Animals in the arthritis groups are anesthetized with isoflurane and given collagen injections (DO); each animal gets 300 μ1 of the mixture spread over 3 subcutaneous sites on the back. On Day 6 (D6) the animals are anesthetized again and given a second collagen injection, as before. [00563] Oral dosing of a compound of Formula (I), (II), (III), or (IV) at 24 hour intervals (qd) is initiated on Day 0 using a dose volume of 5 ml/kg for oral solutions. Rats are weighed on Days 0, 3, 6, and 9-17 of arthritis, and caliper measurements of ankles taken every day beginning on Day 9. Final body weights are taken on Day 17 of arthritis. On Day 17, all animals are anesthetized for terminal blood draw and then euthanized. Subsequently, hind paws and knees are removed, the hind paws are weighed and then (with knees) placed in formalin for processing for microscopy. Livers, spleen and thymus and kidneys are also removed, trimmed of extraneous tissue and weighed. Kidneys are retained in formalin for histopathology. [00564] Sampling will occur over 1 day and involves groups 2-5 with samples retained from all groups. This results in all animals being treated similarly and is important for clinical parameters and final liver weights. Example 92 Effect of compounds of Formula (I), (II), (III), or (IV) on DNBS-Induced Colitis in Rats: [00565] Procedure: Male Wistar rats weighing 200 ± 20 g are fasted for 24 hours prior to use. Distal colitis is induced by intra-colonic instillation of DNBS (2,4-dinotrobenzene sulfonic acid, 20 mg in 0.5 ml ethanol 30%) with a catheter of 12 cm in length, followed by gentle injection of air (2 ml) through the catheter to ensure that the solution remain in the colon. The animals are divided into groups of 5 each. Test substance and vehicle are administered either daily or twice daily by appropriate route of administration 24 hour and 1 hour before DNBS instillation and then for 6 consecutive days thereafter. One normal control group is treated with 0.9% NaCl alone without DNBS challenge. The animals are sacrificed 12 hours after the final bid dose and 24 hours after the final daily dose and the colon is removed and weighed. During the experiment, body weight, fecal occult blood and stool consistency are monitored daily. Furthermore, when the abdominal cavity is opened before removal of the colon, adhesions between the colon and other organs are noted as is the presence of colonic ulceration after removal and weighing of each colon (a macroscopic damage score is recorded according to established score criteria). The colon-to-body weight ratio is calculated according to the formula: Colon (g)/BW χ 100. The “Net” increase in ratio of Vehicle-control + DNBS group relative to Vehicle-control group is used as a base for comparison with individual treated groups and expressed as “Dec. (%)” (percent decrease). A 30% or more (>30%) reduction in colon-to-body weight ratio, relative to the vehicle treated control group, is considered significant. [00566] Sulfasalazine is used as the standard test agent.

J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 276: 265-270, 1996.) [00567] Compound of Formula (I)-(IV) are expected to reduce colitis in this model. Example 93 Effect of compounds of Formula (I), (II), (III), or (IV) on Rejection of Skin Transplants in Rats: [00568] Procedure. Specific pathogen free Lewis and Brown Norway rats 10 weeks of age are purchased from Charles River and housed under clean conventional conditions. The animals are handled and allowed to acclimatize for a period of two weeks. Skin donors: female Brown Norway rats, 10 weeks of age. Skin recipients: female Lewis rats, 10 weeks of age. [00569] The donor Brown Norway rats are killed to serve as donors of 5 to 8 skin transplants. Directly after killing the Brown Norway rats, the abdominal skin of the rats is shaved and skin transplants of 20 mm in diameter in size are taken. After removal of connective tissue, these grafts are transplanted onto Lewis rats. This is performed by shaving the upper dorsal skin of the Lewis rat under isoflurane anesthesia, removing a piece of skin of 15 mm in diameter by punching and replacement with a skin transplant derived from the Brown Norway rat. [00570] During the study each graft is fixated by 4-6 stitches using Safil 6/0 violet (Β Braun, Aesculap) and covered by Paraffin Gauze Dressing BP (3 χ 3cm, Smith & Nephew), a piece of gauze and surgical tape. This adaptation minimizes the chance of loosing a transplant for reasons different from rejection. [00571] In all cases, transplants are protected with a bandage; these are removed after six days to enable daily inspection of the transplant. [00572] Rejection is monitored by evaluating first signs of inflammation (redness) and necrosis (hardening and blackening of the graft).
