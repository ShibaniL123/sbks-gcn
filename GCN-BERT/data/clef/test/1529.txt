Methyl 4-(5-isopropoxy-2-methyl-4-nitrophenyl)piperidine-1-carboxylate (C2-1, P=CO2CH3)
A mixture of methyl 4-(5-isopropoxy-2-methylphenyl)piperidine-1-carboxylate (4.15 g) in acetic anhydride (51 ml) was cooled to −10° C. Nitric acid (1 ml, 65%) was added and the mixture stirred for 1 hour at −10° C. Another portion of nitric acid (1 ml, 65%) was added, stirred for 3 hours, and the mixture warmed to room temperature. After adding water (100 ml) to the mixture, the aqueous phase was extracted with ethyl acetate (3×80 ml). The combined organic phases were washed with saturated aqueous NH4Cl (2×50 ml), brine (50 ml) and dried over Na2SO4. The volatiles were removed under vacuum and the crude material purified by silica gel chromatography (ethyl acetate/heptane) to yield methyl 4-(5-isopropoxy-2-methyl-4-nitrophenyl)piperidine-1-carboxylate (2.1 g, 72% yield) as a yellow oil.
