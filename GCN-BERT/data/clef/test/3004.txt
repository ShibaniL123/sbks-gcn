WORKOUT GLOVE HAVING A WRIST WRAP BRIEF SUMMARY [0001] The present invention is generally directed to a workout glove that includes an integrated wrist wrap. The workout glove comprises a hand portion within which a wearer's hand is placed and a wrist wrap attached to a proximal edge of the hand portion and configured to extend around the wearer's wrist when the wearer's hand is placed in the hand portion. The hand portion includes one or more open-ended sheaths through which corresponding one or more of the wearer's fingers extend and a thumb opening through which the wearer's thumb extends and which exposes the wearer's thumb. [0002] In some embodiments, the thumb opening can be configured to expose a portion of the wearer's palm. Also, in some embodiments, the hand portion can form an opening on the back side of the wearer's hand. Such designs can minimize the amount of the wearer's hand that is covered by the glove while still providing adequate protection against blisters and/or calluses during workout.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION [0013] The present invention is generally directed to a workout glove that includes an integrated wrist wrap. The workout glove comprises a hand portion within which a wearer's hand is placed and a wrist wrap attached to a proximal edge of the hand portion and configured to extend around the wearer's wrist when the wearer's hand is placed in the hand portion. The hand portion includes one or more open-ended sheaths through which corresponding one or more of the wearer's fingers extend and a thumb opening through which the wearer's thumb extends and which exposes the wearer's thumb. [0014] In some embodiments, the thumb opening can be configured to expose a portion of the wearer's palm. Also, in some embodiments, the hand portion can form an opening on the back side of the wearer's hand. Such designs can minimize the amount of the wearer's hand that is covered by the glove while still providing adequate protection against blisters and/or calluses during workout. [0015] Figures 1-7 illustrate various views of an example workout glove 100 configured in accordance with one or more embodiments of the present invention. Glove 100 comprises a hand portion 110 and a wrist wrap 120. A portion of wrist wrap 120 is connected along a front- side (or palm- side) proximal edge 112 of hand portion 110. Front-side proximal edge 112 can be configured so that it extends along the base of the wearer's palm at or near the wrist joint. The portion of wrist wrap 120 that is not connected to hand portion 110 can be wrapped around the wearer's wrist. An end of wrist wrap 120 can include hook and loop or other connecting means 120a for securing the end of wrist wrap 120 in place. [0016] Hand portion 110 includes four open-ended sheaths 115a-115d at a distal end of the glove through which the wearer's fingers extend. The length of open-ended sheaths 115a- 115d can be configured so that the open-ended sheaths do not cover the intermediate phalanges (e.g. so that they extend up to the second knuckle). However, in some embodiments, open-ended sheaths 115a-115d can extend at least partially over the intermediate phalanges. [0017] Although glove 100 includes four open-ended sheaths, in some embodiments, a workout glove can contain less than four open-ended sheaths. For example, a glove can be configured with only open-ended sheaths 115a, 115b (i.e., one for the index finger and one for the middle finger). Other arrangements of fewer than four open-ended sheaths can also be used. In embodiments where fewer than four open-ended sheaths are employed, hand portion 110 can include an opening for one or more of the fingers for which no open-ended sheath is provided. For example, if open-ended sheaths are provided for the index and middle fingers only, the ring and pinky fingers may extend out through a single opening. [0018] Also, in some embodiments, the length of one open-ended sheath may be different than the length of another open-ended sheath. For example, an open-ended sheath for the middle finger may extend up to the second knuckle while an open-ended sheath for the ring finger may extend only half way over the proximal phalange. [0019] Hand portion 110 also includes a thumb opening 117. Thumb opening 117 is configured so that the entire thumb remains exposed. In some embodiments, thumb opening 117 may be configured so that a portion of the wearer's palm is also exposed. For example, as best shown in Figures 3 and 5, an inside edge 1 14 of hand portion 110 may curve inwardly as it extends downwardly thereby exposing a portion of the palm at the base of the thumb. To create thumb opening 117, hand portion 110 may include a strip 116 that is configured to extend from back-side proximal edge 111 and wrap around the base of the thumb where it connects to front-side proximal edge 112. [0020] In some embodiments of a workout glove, such as glove 100, a back-side proximal edge 111 does not extend as far down the hand as front- side proximal edge 112. In such cases, a portion of the back side of the wearer's hand remains uncovered. For example, back-side proximal edge 111 can be configured so that it is positioned near the wearer's knuckles (i.e. the metacarpophalangeal joints). In such cases, the back side of the glove can cover the wearer's knuckles while leaving a majority of the back side of the hand uncovered. [0021] For example, as shown in Figure 2, an opening 118 is formed between back-side proximal edge 111 and wrist wrap 120 with strip 116 being the only portion of hand portion 110 that extends along the back side of the hand to back-side proximal edge 112. In such embodiments, an outer edge 113 of hand portion 110 does not wrap around to the back side of the wearer's hand. In contrast, in some embodiments, outer edge 113 may wrap around to the back side of the wearer's hand as shown in Figures 4 and 6. [0022] In embodiments of the invention, hand portion 110 can be formed of multiple materials. For example, a front or palm side of hand portion 110 can be formed of a leather material while a back side of hand portion 110 can be formed of a spandex or other elastic material. Employing a leather or similar material on the palm side can provide a strong, long- lasting material to aid in preventing blisters or calluses while working out, while employing an elastic material such as spandex on the back side increases the comfort and wearability of the glove. [0023] In some embodiments, different materials can be employed on the palm side of hand portion 110. As stated above, a leather or similar material can be used over the knuckles to prevent blisters or calluses during workout while an elastic material may be connected to the leather material at a location below the knuckles and extend along the palm down to front- side proximal edge 112. Typically, wrist wrap 120 can be formed of an elastic material; however, non-elastic materials can also be used. [0024] The present invention may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from its spirit or essential characteristics. The described embodiments are to be considered in all respects only as illustrative and not restrictive.
