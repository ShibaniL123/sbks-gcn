FIELD OF INVENTION This invention relates to a new compound, particularly, this new compound can be used as an additive for electroplating. BACKGROUND OF INVENTION During electroplating, a voltage drop variation typically exists along an irregular surface of a substrate which can result in an uneven metal deposit on the substrate. Some parts of the substrate would have been overplated while other parts would have been underplated. This would particularly be a problem when there is a hole on the surface of the substrate. For example, FIG. 1 shows a scanning electron micrograph (“SEM”) of a hole 20 on a substrate having copper 22 electroplated on it by a conventional electroplating process (i.e. electroplating a substrate by submerging it into an electroplating bath without any additives). As shown in FIG. 1, the edge of the hole 20 is overplated with copper 22, while the inner walls of the hole 20 are underplated. As a result, the inner volume of the hole 20 is not properly filled and the resulting conductivity of the substrate plated with copper 22 would be greatly affected. Levelers have been added into the electroplating bath in order to achieve a uniform metal deposit on a substrate surface. Although the conventional levelers improve the quality of metal deposit done by electroplating on the substrate surface, the quality is still not as desired. SUMMARY OF INVENTION In the light of the foregoing background, it is an object of the present invention to provide a new and alternate additive, particularly, an alternate leveler for copper electroplating. Accordingly, the present invention, in one aspect, is a compound represented by the following formula (I) wherein X represents a linker group comprising a backbone which further comprises a predetermined number of carbon atoms, in which at least one of the carbon atoms is optionally substituted by oxygen atom and/or nitrogen atom and/or sulfur atom; and R1 represents a positively charged functional group comprising a plurality of carbon atoms and at least one positively charged nitrogen moiety. In one embodiment, wherein R1 is further represented by the following formula (II) wherein Y1 and Y2 respectively represents a first and second chained group, where each of the chained group comprises a backbone comprising a predetermined number of carbon atoms, wherein at least one of the carbon atoms is optionally substituted by oxygen atoms and/or nitrogen atoms and/or sulfur atoms; and Z represents a hydrogen or a hydrocarbon of C1-C20 optionally having unsaturated bonds or hydroxyl groups. According to another aspect of the present invention a method of electroplating a substrate comprising the steps of a) contacting the substrate with an electroplating bath comprising a compound represented by formula (I); andb) applying an electric current to the substrate for a predetermined period of time such that a plating is formed on the substrate, wherein X represents a linker group comprising a backbone which further comprises a predetermined number of carbon atoms, in which at least one of the carbon atoms is optionally substituted by oxygen atom and/or nitrogen atom and/or sulfur atom; and R1 represents a positively charged functional group comprising a plurality of carbon atoms and at least one positively charged nitrogen moiety. In a further aspect of the present invention, a method of a process for preparing a leveler for the use in electroplating comprising the step of contacting an amine with an epoxide-containing reagent represented by the following formula (XX) wherein X represents a linker group comprising a backbone which further comprises a predetermined number of carbon atoms, in which at least one of the carbon atoms is optionally substituted by oxygen atom and/or nitrogen atom and/or sulfur atom; and R2 represents another chained group comprising at least one epoxide functional group. In one embodiment, the method of a process for preparing a leveler for the use in electroplating further comprises the step of adding a halogen-containing reagent represented by the following formula (XXIV) [in-line-formulae]V-Z (XXIV)[/in-line-formulae] wherein V represents a halogen; and Z represents a group consisting of a hydrogen, a hydrocarbon of C1-C20 optionally having at least one unsaturated bond and/or hydroxyl group. There are many advantages to the present invention. Firstly, the additive of the present invention provides a branched structure at each end of the additive compound/molecule, wherein each of the branches comprises a positively charged nitrogen moiety. The additive compound/molecule is formed by linking the branches having the positively charged nitrogen moieties to the backbone of the additive compound/molecule. This leads to a novel additive compound/molecule with high charge density, in which there are at least 6 positive charges within a single additive compound/molecule of the present invention. Another advantage of the present invention is that the ratio of nitrogen and oxygen in the additive compound/molecule of the present invention is adjustable according to the practical needs. Thus, the additive compound/molecule of the present invention can be used in more versatile applications than the conventional levelers, which have fixed nitrogen to oxygen ratio. Further, in 3D-IC integration, which is the future of microelectronics, one of the key technologies is 3D vertical interconnects, including nanometer damascene trench, microbumps for flip chip assembly, TSV for chip stacking, and microvias in multilayer substrate. The fabrication of those interconnects by copper electrochemical deposition is a challenging process. As the microvia size continues decreasing for electronics miniaturization, thinner surface plating thickness and smaller dimple depth are required. A further advantage of the present invention is that the additive molecule/compound of the present invention can be used as a leveler in conjunction with accelerator and suppressor to provide a high filling power in copper electrochemical deposition. Therefore, high quality plating with thin surface plating thickness and substantially no dimple after electrochemical deposition can be achieved.
