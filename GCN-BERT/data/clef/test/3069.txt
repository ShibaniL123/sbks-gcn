Macrocyclic RIP2 kinase inhibitors Field of the invention The present invention relates to macrocyclic compounds and compositions containing said compounds acting as kinase inhibitors, in particular as inhibitors of RIP2, and/or mutants thereof, for use in the diagnosis, prevention and/or treatment of RIP2-kinase associated diseases. Moreover, the present invention provides methods of using said compounds, for instance as a medicine or diagnostic agent. Background of the invention Protein kinases constitute a large family of structurally related enzymes that are responsible for the control of a wide variety of signal transduction processes in the cell. They have been shown to be key regulators in most cellular functions including proliferation, cell metabolism, cell survival, apoptosis, DNA damage repair, cell motility... Uncontrolled signalling due to defective control of protein phosphorylation has been implicated in a number of diseases, including, for example, cancer, inflammation, allergies, immune diseases, CNS disorders, angiogenesis... Amongst the families of protein kinases, one particular example is the Receptor-Interacting Serine/Threonine Kinases including RIP2. RIP2 (Receptor-Interacting Protein 2) is also referred to as Card-Containing Ice-Associated Kinase (CARDIAK), CARD3 (C-terminal CAspase-Recruitment Domain 3), Receptor-Interacting Protein Kinase 2 (RIPK2), or Rip-Like Interacting Clarp Kinase (RICK). RIP2 kinase is composed of an N-terminal kinase domain and a C-terminal caspaserecruitment domain (CARD) linked via an intermediate (IM) region (Curr. Med. Chem. (2005) 4, 35-42)). The CARD domain of RIP2 kinase mediates interaction with other CARD-containing proteins, such as the Nucleotide Oligomerization Domain Proteins, NOD1 and NOD2 (J. Biol. Chem. (2000) 275, 27823-27831 and ΕΜΒΟ reports (2001) 2, 736-742). NOD1 and NOD2 are cytoplasmic receptors which are activated by specific bacterial peptidoglycan motifs and play a key role in innate immune surveillance. Upon intracellular bacterial exposure, NOD1 or NOD2 binds to the protein kinase RIP2 to coordinate NF-kB (nuclear factor κ B)-mediated cytokine responses. Once associated with NOD1/2, RIP2 undergoes autophosphorylation on Tyr 474 (Υ474), and acts as a molecular scaffold to bring together other kinases (ΤΑΚ1, ΐΚΚα/β/γ) involved in NF-kB and ΜΑΡΚ activation (Nature Reviews Immunology (2006) 6, 9-20). Both NOD1/2 and RIP2 are NF-kB regulated genes, and as such, their activation causes a positive feedback loop in which activation of NOD1/2:RIP2 stimulates further activation and further inflammation. Additionally, NOD1/2 and RIP2 expression are stimulated by a variety of mediators of inflammation, including TNF (Tumor Necrosis Factor) and IFN (Interferon). In addition to NF-kB pathway activation, the NOD1/2:RIP2 complex stimulates autophagy, bacteriocidal activity, MHC Class II presentation and ΜΑΡΚ (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase) activation. Overall, this pathway modulates the innate immune system to help tailor the adaptive immune response to eradicate the offending pathogen. Dysregulation of RIP2-dependent signaling has been linked to autoinflammatory diseases. Patients with loss-of-function NOD2 alleles are prone to the development of Crohn’s disease, an inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal tract (Am. J. Hum. Genet. (2002) 70, 845-857 and Microbes and Infection (2009) 11, 912-918). In contrast, gain-of-function NOD2 mutations have been genetically linked to other inflammatory diseases, such as Blau Syndrome/Early Onset Sarcoidosis (EOS), a pediatric granulomateous disease characterized by uveitis, dermatitis, and arthritis (Nature Genetics (2001) 29, 19-20 and Current Rheumatology Reports (2005) 7, 427-433). Mutations in NOD1 have been associated with asthma (Hum. Mol. Genet. (2005) 14, 935-941), and early-onset and extra-intestinal inflammatory bowel disease (Hum. Mol. Genet. (2005) 14, 1245-1250). Genetic and functional studies have also suggested a role for RIP2-dependent signaling in a variety of other granulomateous disorders, such as sarcoidosis (Journal of Clinical Immunology (2009) 29, 78-89) and Wegner’s Granulomatosis (Diagnostic Pathology (2009) 4, 23). The fact that both loss-of-function polymorphisms and gain-of-function mutations cause inflammatory diseases is likely due to the fact that NOD2 functions as a rheostat to help maintain normal immunologic homeostasis. Lack of coordination between inflammatory signaling pathways influences the development of inflammatory disorders, and the NOD1/2:RIP2 activation equilibrium is central to this coordination. Treatments for Crohn's disease and sarcoidosis currently rely on broad, non-specific immunologic inhibition (e.g., corticosteroids) or on specific cytokine inhibition (e.g., anti-TNF therapies) with significant costs and side effects. Treatment is less than ideal, however, because not all agents are equally efficacious, the diseases occur over long time frames, and not all agents remain efficacious in the same patient. The RIP2 Υ474 autophosphorylation event has been shown to be necessary for effective NOD2 signaling and does not occur in the presence of the most common loss-of-function Crohn's disease-associated NOD2 allele. This autophosphorylation is inhibited by non highly selective kinase inhibitors, gefitinib and erlotinib, suggesting that RIP2's tyrosine kinase activity could be targeted specifically in the treatment of inflammatory diseases (Genes Dev. (2010) 1,2666-77). Several clinical cases were reported about gefitinib or erlotinib treatment being efficient to clear psoriasis or reduce arthritic symptoms or insulin-resistant type 2 diabetes associated with metabolic syndrome (The Oncologist (2013) 18: ℮3-℮5). In mouse established models of chronic inflammatory bowel diseases, inhibition of RIP2 activity by the small molecule SB203580 is efficacious to reduce induced-colitis (J Biol Chem. (2005) 15, 14981-14988.). None of these small molecules however, primarily and selectively targets RIP2. It was therefore an object of the present invention to provide a potent, selective, small molecule inhibitor of RIP2 kinase activity which can block specifically RIP2-dependent proinflammatory signaling and thereby provides a therapeutic benefit in autoinflammatory diseases characterized in increased and/or dysregulated RIP2 kinase activity. We have now found that the macrocyclic pyrazolopyrimidines and imidazopyridazines and pharmaceutically acceptable compositions according to this invention are useful for the treatment of inflammatory disorders, in particular Crohn’s disease, bowel disease, Sarcoidosis, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, asthma and insulin-resistant type 2 diabetes, ulcerative colitis, lupus, uveitis, blau syndrome, granulomatous inflammation, in particular behget’s disease, multiple sclerosis, and disease associated with RIP2 kinase activity (i.e. RIP2-kinase associated diseases).

The same principle applies to all the radicals of the invention unless specified otherwise. When describing the compounds of the invention, the terms used are to be construed in accordance with the following definitions, unless a context dictates otherwise: The term "alkyl" by itself or as part of another substituent refers to fully saturated hydrocarbon radicals. Generally, alkyl groups of this invention comprise from 1 to 6 carbon atoms. Alkyl groups may be linear or branched and may be substituted as indicated herein. When a subscript is used herein following a carbon atom, the subscript refers to the number of carbon atoms that the named group may contain. Thus, for example, C-|.6alkyl means an alkyl of one to six carbon atoms. Examples of alkyl groups are methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, i-propyl, butyl, and its isomers (e.g. n-butyl, i-butyl and t-butyl); pentyl and its isomers, hexyl and its isomers. CrC6 alkyl includes all linear, branched, or cyclic alkyl groups with between 1 and 6 carbon atoms, and thus includes methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, i-propyl, butyl and its isomers (e.g. n-butyl, i-butyl and t-butyl); pentyl and its isomers, hexyl and its isomers, cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, and cyclohexyl. The term "optionally substituted alkyl" refers to an alkyl group optionally substituted with one or more substituents (for example 1 to 3 substituents, for example 1, 2 or 3 substituents or 1 to 2 substituents) at any available point of attachment. Non-limiting examples of such substituents include -halo, -OH, primary and secondary amides, -O-Ci-ealkyl, -S-Ci_6alkyl, heteroaryl, aryl, and the like. The term “cycloalkyl” by itself or as part of another substituent is a cyclic alkyl group, that is to say, a monovalent, saturated, or unsaturated hydrocarbyl group having a cyclic structure. Cycloalkyl includes all saturated or partially saturated (containing 1 or 2 double bonds) hydrocarbon groups having a cyclic structure. Cycloalkyl groups may comprise 3 or more carbon atoms in the ring and generally, according to this invention comprise from 3 to 6 atoms. Examples of cycloalkyl groups include but are not limited to cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl. Cycloalkyl as referred herein also includes substituted cycloalkyl groups, wherein such groups may be substituted once or more, and preferably once, twice or thrice. Substituents may be selected from -Ci_6alkyl and those defined above for substituted alkyl. Where alkyl groups as defined are divalent, i.e., with two single bonds for attachment to two other groups, they are termed "alkylene" groups. Non-limiting examples of alkylene groups includes methylene, ethylene, methylmethylene, trimethylene, propylene, tetramethylene, ethylethylene, 1,2-dimethylethylene, pentamethylene and hexamethylene. Generally, alkylene groups of this invention preferably comprise the same number of carbon atoms as their alkyl counterparts. Where an alkylene or cycloalkylene biradical is present, connectivity to the molecular structure of which it forms part may be through a common carbon atom or different carbon atom. To illustrate this applying the asterisk nomenclature of this invention, a C3 alkylene group may be for example *-CH2CH2CH2-*, *-CH(-CH2CH3)-*, or *-CH2CH(-CH3)-*. Likewise a C3 cycloalkylene group may be The terms "heterocycle" as used herein by itself or as part of another group refer to non-aromatic, fully saturated or partially unsaturated cyclic groups (for example, 3 to 6 membered monocyclic ring systems, or 8-10 membered bicyclic rings) which have at least one heteroatom in at least one carbon atom-containing ring. Each ring of the heterocyclic group containing a heteroatom may have 1,2, 3 or 4 heteroatoms selected from nitrogen atoms, oxygen atoms and/or sulfur atoms. An optionally substituted heterocyclic refers to a heterocyclic having optionally one or more substituents (for example 1 to 4 substituents, or for example 1, 2, 3 or 4), selected from those defined above for substituted alkyl.

The term “halo” or “halogen” as a group or part of a group is generic for fluoro, chloro, bromo, or iodo, as well as any suitable isotope thereof. Whenever the term “substituted” is used in the present invention, it is meant to indicate that one or more hydrogens on the atom indicated in the expression using “substituted” is replaced with a selection from the indicated group, provided that the indicated atom’s normal valency is not exceeded, and that the substitution results in a chemically stable compound, i.e. a compound that is sufficiently robust to survive isolation to a useful degree of purity from a reaction mixture, and formulation into a therapeutic and/or diagnostic agent. Where groups may be optionally substituted, such groups may be substituted once or more, and preferably once, twice or thrice. Substituents may be selected from, those defined above for substituted alkyl. As used herein the terms such as “alkyl, aryl, or cycloalkyl, each being optionally substituted with” or “alkyl, aryl, or cycloalkyl, optionally substituted with” refers to optionally substituted alkyl, optionally substituted aryl and optionally substituted cycloalkyl. More generally, from the above, it will be clear to the skilled person that the compounds of the invention may exist in the form of different isomers and/or tautomers, including but not limited to geometrical isomers, conformational isomers, E/Z-isomers, stereochemical isomers (i.e. enantiomers and diastereoisomers) and isomers that correspond to the presence of the same substituents on different positions of the rings present in the compounds of the invention. All such possible isomers, tautomers and mixtures thereof are included within the scope of the invention. In addition, the invention includes isotopically-labelled compounds and salts, which are identical to compounds of formula (I), but for the fact that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number most commonly found in nature. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of formula (I) are isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, fluorine, such as Η, C, Ν, C, O and F. Such isotopically-labelled compounds of formula (I) are useful in drug and/or substrate tissue distribution assays. For example 11C and 18F isotopes are particularly useful in PET (Positron Emission Tomography). PET is useful as a diagnostic or treatment follow-up tool that can be applied in a translational manner in a preclinical and clinical setting. It also has applications in ΡΚ determination of compounds, including biodistribution. Isotopically labeled compounds of formula (I) can generally be prepared by carrying out the procedures disclosed below, by substituting a readily available non-isotopically labeled reagent with an isotopically labeled reagent. Whenever used in the present invention the term “compounds of the invention” or a similar term is meant to include the compounds of general Formula I and any subgroup thereof. This term also refers to the compounds as depicted in Table 1, their derivatives, Ν-oxides, salts, solvates, hydrates, stereoisomeric forms, racemic mixtures, tautomeric forms, optical isomers, analogues, pro-drugs, esters, and metabolites, as well as their quaternized nitrogen analogues. The Ν-oxide forms of said compounds are meant to comprise compounds wherein one or several nitrogen atoms are oxidized to the so-called Ν-oxide. As used in the specification and the appended claims, the singular forms "a", "an", and "the" include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. By way of example, "a compound" means one compound or more than one compound. The terms described above and others used in the specification are well understood to those in the art.

In yet a further aspect, the present invention provides a compound selected from the list comprising: The compounds of the present invention can be prepared according to the reaction schemes provided in the examples hereinafter, but those skilled in the art will appreciate that these are only illustrative for the invention and that the compounds of this invention can be prepared by any of several standard synthetic processes commonly used by those skilled in the art of organic chemistry. METHOD OF TREATMENT Compounds of formula (I) a stereoisomer, tautomer, racemic, metabolite, pro- or predrug, salt, hydrate, N-oxide form, or solvate thereof, are inhibitors of RIP2 kinase activity and are thus believed to be of potential use in the diagnosis, prevention and/or treatment of inflammatory disorders, in particular Crohn’s disease, bowel disease, Sarcoidosis, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, ulcerative colitis, lupus, uveitis, blau syndrome, granulomatous inflammation, in particular behget’s disease, multiple sclerosis and insulin-resistant type 2 diabetes. As used herein, the terms "inflammatory disorder" or "inflammatory disease" can refer to a disorder or disease characterized by aberrant activation of the immune system that leads to or causes pathogenesis of several acute and chronic conditions including, for example, sarcoidosis, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, transplant rejection, colitis, gastritis and ileitis. An inflammatory disease can include a state in which there is a response to tissue damage, cell injury, an antigen, an infectious disease, and/or some unknown cause. Symptoms of inflammation may include, but are not limited to, cell infiltration and tissue swelling. In the invention, particular preference is given to compounds of Formula I or any subgroup thereof that in the inhibition assay for RIP2 described below inhibit kinase activity with an IC50 value of less than 10 μΜ, preferably less than 1 μΜ, most preferably less than 100 ηΜ. Said inhibition may be effected in vitro and/or in vivo, and when effected in vivo, is preferably effected in a selective manner, as defined above. The term "RIP2 kinase-mediated condition" or "disease", as used herein, means any disease or other deleterious condition in which the RIP2 kinase and/or mutants thereof is/are known to play a role. The term " RIP2 kinase-mediated condition" or "disease" also means those diseases or conditions that are alleviated by treatment with a RIP2 kinase inhibitor. Accordingly, another embodiment of the present invention relates to treating or lessening the severity of one or more diseases in which the RIP2 kinase is known to play a role. For pharmaceutical use, the compounds of the invention may be used as a free acid or base, and/or in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable acid-addition and/or base-addition salt (e.g. obtained with non-toxic organic or inorganic acid or base), in the form of a hydrate, solvate and/or complex, and/or in the form or a pro-drug or pre-drug, such as an ester. As used herein and unless otherwise stated, the term “solvate” includes any combination which may be formed by a compound of this invention with a suitable inorganic solvent (e.g. hydrates) or organic solvent, such as but not limited to alcohols, ketones, esters and the like. Such salts, hydrates, solvates, etc. and the preparation thereof will be clear to the skilled person; reference is for instance made to the salts, hydrates, solvates, etc. described in US-A-6,372,778, US-A-6,369,086, US-A-6,369,087 and US-A-6,372,733. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds according to the invention, i.e. in the form of water-, oil-soluble, or dispersible products, include the conventional non-toxic salts or the quaternary ammonium salts which are formed, e.g., from inorganic or organic acids or bases. Examples of such acid addition salts include acetate, adipate, alginate, aspartate, benzoate, benzenesulfonate, bisulfate, butyrate, citrate, camphorate, camphorsulfonate, cyclopentanepropionate, digluconate, dodecylsulfate, ethanesulfonate, fumarate, glucoheptanoate, glycerophosphate, hemisulfate, heptanoate, hexanoate, hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, 2-hydroxyethanesulfonate, lactate, maleate, methanesulfonate, 2-naphthalene-sulfonate, nicotinate, oxalate, palmoate, pectinate, persulfate, 3-phenylpropionate, picrate, pivalate, propionate, succinate, tartrate, thiocyanate, tosylate, and undecanoate. Base salts include ammonium salts, alkali metal salts such as sodium and potassium salts, alkaline earth metal salts such as calcium and magnesium salts, salts with organic bases such as dicyclohexylamine salts, N-methyl-D-glucamine, and salts with amino acids such as arginine, lysine, and so forth. In addition, the basic nitrogen-containing groups may be quaternized with such agents as lower alkyl halides, such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, and butyl chloride, bromides and iodides; dialkyl sulfates like dimethyl, diethyl, dibutyl; and diamyl sulfates, long chain halides such as decyl, lauryl, myristyl and stearyl chlorides, bromides and iodides, aralkyl halides like benzyl and phenethyl-bromides and others. Other pharmaceutically acceptable salts include the sulfate salt ethanolate and sulfate salts. Generally, for pharmaceutical use, the compounds of the inventions may be formulated as a pharmaceutical preparation or pharmaceutical composition comprising at least one compound of the invention and at least one pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent or excipient and/or adjuvant, and optionally one or more further pharmaceutically active compounds. By means of non-limiting examples, such a formulation may be in a form suitable for oral administration, for parenteral administration (such as by intravenous, intramuscular or subcutaneous injection or intravenous infusion), for administration by inhalation, by a skin patch, by an implant, by a suppository, etc.. Such suitable administration forms - which may be solid, semisolid or liquid, depending on the manner of administration - as well as methods and carriers, diluents and excipients for use in the preparation thereof, will be clear to the skilled person; reference is again made to for instance US-A-6,372,778, US-A-6,369,086, US-A-6,369,087 and US-A-6,372,733, as well as to the standard handbooks, such as the latest edition of Remington’s Pharmaceutical Sciences. Some preferred, but non-limiting examples of such preparations include tablets, pills, powders, lozenges, sachets, cachets, elixirs, suspensions, emulsions, solutions, syrups, aerosols, ointments, creams, lotions, soft and hard gelatin capsules, suppositories, eye drops, sterile injectable solutions and sterile packaged powders (which are usually reconstituted prior to use) for administration as a bolus and/or for continuous administration, which may be formulated with carriers, excipients, and diluents that are suitable per se for such formulations, such as lactose, dextrose, sucrose, sorbitol, mannitol, starches, gum acacia, calcium phosphate, alginates, tragacanth, gelatin, calcium silicate, microcrystalline cellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyethylene glycol, cellulose, (sterile) water, methylcellulose, methyl- and propylhydroxybenzoates, talc, magnesium stearate, edible oils, vegetable oils and mineral oils or suitable mixtures thereof. The formulations can optionally contain other pharmaceutically active substances (which may or may not lead to a synergistic effect with the compounds of the invention) and other substances that are commonly used in pharmaceutical formulations, such as lubricating agents, wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, dispersing agents, desintegrants, bulking agents, fillers, preserving agents, sweetening agents, flavoring agents, flow regulators, release agents, etc.. The compositions may also be formulated so as to provide rapid, sustained or delayed release of the active compound(s) contained therein, for example using liposomes or hydrophilic polymeric matrices based on natural gels or synthetic polymers. In order to enhance the solubility and/or the stability of the compounds of a pharmaceutical composition according to the invention, it can be advantageous to employ α-, β- or y-cyclodextrins or their derivatives. An interesting way of formulating the compounds in combination with a cyclodextrin or a derivative thereof has been described in EP-A-721,331. In particular, the present invention encompasses a pharmaceutical composition comprising an effective amount of a compound according to the invention with a pharmaceutically acceptable cyclodextrin. In addition, co-solvents such as alcohols may improve the solubility and/or the stability of the compounds. In the preparation of aqueous compositions, addition of salts of the compounds of the invention can be more suitable due to their increased water solubility. For local administration, the compounds may advantageously be used in the form of a spray, ointment or transdermal patch or another suitable form for topical, transdermal and/or intradermal administration. More in particular, the compositions may be formulated in a pharmaceutical formulation comprising a therapeutically effective amount of particles consisting of a solid dispersion of the compounds of the invention and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable water-soluble polymers. The term "a solid dispersion" defines a system in a solid state (as opposed to a liquid or gaseous state) comprising at least two components, wherein one component is dispersed more or less evenly throughout the other component or components. When said dispersion of the components is such that the system is chemically and physically uniform or homogenous throughout or consists of one phase as defined in thermodynamics, such a solid dispersion is referred to as "a solid solution". Solid solutions are preferred physical systems because the components therein are usually readily bioavailable to the organisms to which they are administered. It may further be convenient to formulate the compounds in the form of nanoparticles which have a surface modifier adsorbed on the surface thereof in an amount sufficient to maintain an effective average particle size of less than 1000 nm. Suitable surface modifiers can preferably be selected from known organic and inorganic pharmaceutical excipients. Such excipients include various polymers, low molecular weight oligomers, natural products and surfactants. Preferred surface modifiers include nonionic and anionic surfactants. Yet another interesting way of formulating the compounds according to the invention involves a pharmaceutical composition whereby the compounds are incorporated in hydrophilic polymers and applying this mixture as a coat film over many small beads, thus yielding a composition with good bio-availability which can conveniently be manufactured and which is suitable for preparing pharmaceutical dosage forms for oral administration. Materials suitable for use as cores in the beads are manifold, provided that said materials are pharmaceutically acceptable and have appropriate dimensions and firmness. Examples of such materials are polymers, inorganic substances, organic substances, and saccharides and derivatives thereof. The preparations may be prepared in a manner known per se, which usually involves mixing at least one compound according to the invention with the one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, and, if desired, in combination with other pharmaceutical active compounds, when necessary under aseptic conditions. Reference is again made to US-A-6,372,778, US-A-6,369,086, US-A-6,369,087 and US-A-6,372,733 and the further prior art mentioned above, as well as to the standard handbooks, such as the latest edition of Remington’s Pharmaceutical Sciences. The pharmaceutical preparations of the invention are preferably in a unit dosage form, and may be suitably packaged, for example in a box, blister, vial, bottle, sachet, ampoule or in any other suitable single-dose or multi-dose holder or container (which may be properly labeled); optionally with one or more leaflets containing product information and/or instructions for use. Generally, such unit dosages will contain between 1 and 1000 mg, and usually between 5 and 500 mg, of the at least one compound of the invention, e.g. about 10, 25, 50, 100, 200, 300 or 400 mg per unit dosage. The compounds can be administered by a variety of routes including the oral, rectal, ocular, transdermal, subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular or intranasal routes, depending mainly on the specific preparation used and the condition to be treated or prevented, and with oral and intravenous administration usually being preferred. The at least one compound of the invention will generally be administered in an “effective amount”, by which is meant any amount of a compound of Formula or any subgroup thereof that, upon suitable administration, is sufficient to achieve the desired therapeutic or prophylactic effect in the individual to which it is administered. Usually, depending on the condition to be prevented or treated and the route of administration, such an effective amount will usually be between 0.01 to 1000 mg per kilogram body weight day of the patient per day, more often between 0.1 and 500 mg, such as between 1 and 250 mg, for example about 5,10, 20, 50, 100, 150, 200 or 250 mg, per kilogram body weight day of the patient per day, which may be administered as a single daily dose, divided over one or more daily doses, or essentially continuously, e.g. using a drip infusion. The amount(s) to be administered, the route of administration and the further treatment regimen may be determined by the treating clinician, depending on factors such as the age, gender and general condition of the patient and the nature and severity of the disease/symptoms to be treated. Reference is again made to US-A-6,372,778,US-A-6,369,086, US-A-6,369,087 and US-A-6,372,733 and the further prior art mentioned above, as well as to the standard handbooks, such as the latest edition of Remington’s Pharmaceutical Sciences. In accordance with the method of the present invention, said pharmaceutical composition can be administered separately at different times during the course of therapy or concurrently in divided or single combination forms. The present invention is therefore to be understood as embracing all such regimes of simultaneous or alternating treatment and the term "administering" is to be interpreted accordingly. For an oral administration form, the compositions of the present invention can be mixed with suitable additives, such as excipients, stabilizers, or inert diluents, and brought by means of the customary methods into the suitable administration forms, such as tablets, coated tablets, hard capsules, aqueous, alcoholic, or oily solutions. Examples of suitable inert carriers are gum arabic, magnesia, magnesium carbonate, potassium phosphate, lactose, glucose, or starch, in particular, corn starch. In this case, the preparation can be carried out both as dry and as moist granules. Suitable oily excipients or solvents are vegetable or animal oils, such as sunflower oil or cod liver oil. Suitable solvents for aqueous or alcoholic solutions are water, ethanol, sugar solutions, or mixtures thereof. Polyethylene glycols and polypropylene glycols are also useful as further auxiliaries for other administration forms. As immediate release tablets, these compositions may contain microcrystalline cellulose, dicalcium phosphate, starch, magnesium stearate and lactose and/or other excipients, binders, extenders, disintegrants, diluents and lubricants known in the art. When administered by nasal aerosol or inhalation, these compositions may be prepared according to techniques well-known in the art of pharmaceutical formulation and may be prepared as solutions in saline, employing benzyl alcohol or other suitable preservatives, absorption promoters to enhance bioavailability, fluorocarbons, and/or other solubilizing or dispersing agents known in the art. Suitable pharmaceutical formulations for administration in the form of aerosols or sprays are, for example, solutions, suspensions or emulsions of the compounds of the invention or their physiologically tolerable salts in a pharmaceutically acceptable solvent, such as ethanol or water, or a mixture of such solvents. If required, the formulation can also additionally contain other pharmaceutical auxiliaries such as surfactants, emulsifiers and stabilizers as well as a propellant. For subcutaneous administration, the compound according to the invention, if desired with the substances customary therefore such as solubilizers, emulsifiers or further auxiliaries are brought into solution, suspension, or emulsion. The compounds of the invention can also be lyophilized and the lyophilizates obtained used, for example, for the production of injection or infusion preparations. Suitable solvents are, for example, water, physiological saline solution or alcohols, e.g. ethanol, propanol, glycerol, in addition also sugar solutions such as glucose or mannitol solutions, or alternatively mixtures of the various solvents mentioned. The injectable solutions or suspensions may be formulated according to known art, using suitable non-toxic, parenterally-acceptable diluents or solvents, such as mannitol, 1,3-butanediol, water, Ringer's solution or isotonic sodium chloride solution, or suitable dispersing or wetting and suspending agents, such as sterile, bland, fixed oils, including synthetic mono- or diglycerides, and fatty acids, including oleic acid. When rectally administered in the form of suppositories, these formulations may be prepared by mixing the compounds according to the invention with a suitable non-irritating excipient, such as cocoa butter, synthetic glyceride esters or polyethylene glycols, which are solid at ordinary temperatures, but liquefy and/or dissolve in the rectal cavity to release the drug. In preferred embodiments, the compounds and compositions of the invention are used orally or parenterally. The invention will now be illustrated by means of the following synthetic and biological examples, which do not limit the scope of the invention in any way. EXAMPLES A.
