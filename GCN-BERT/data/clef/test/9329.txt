COMPOUNDS FOR IMMUNOPROTEASOME INHIBITION Claim of Priority This application claims priority U.S. Provisional Application Serial No. 61/309,366, filed on March 1,2010, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference. Background of the Invention Any discussion of the prior art throughout the specification should in no way be considered as an admission that such prior art is widely known or forms part of common general knowledge in the field. In eukaryotes, protein degradation is predominately mediated through the ubiquitin pathway in which proteins targeted for destruction are ligated to the 76 amino acid polypeptide ubiquitin. Once targeted, ubiquitinated proteins then serve as substrates for the 26S proteasome, a multicatalytic protease, which cleaves proteins into short peptides through the action of its three major proteolytic activities. While having a general function in intracellular protein turnover, proteasome-mediated degradation also plays a key role in many processes such as major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I presentation, apoptosis and cell viability, antigen processing, NF-kB activation, and transduction of pro-inflammatory signals. The 20S proteasome is a 700 kDa cylindrical-shaped multicatalytic protease complex comprised of 28 subunits, classified as a- and /?-type, that are arranged in 4 stacked heptameric rings. In yeast and other eukaryotes, 7 different a subunits form the outer rings and 7 different β subunits comprise the inner rings. The a subunits serve as binding sites for the 19S (ΡΑ700) and 11S (ΡΑ28) regulatory complexes, as well as a physical barrier for the inner proteolytic chamber formed by the two β subunit rings. Thus, in vivo, the proteasome is believed to exist as a 26S particle (“the 26S proteasome”). In vivo experiments have shown that inhibition of the 20S form of the proteasome can be readily correlated to inhibition of 26S proteasome. Cleavage of amino-terminal prosequences of β subunits during particle formation expose amino-terminal threonine residues, which serve as the catalytic nucleophiles. The subunits responsible for catalytic activity in proteasome thus possess an amino terminal nucleophilic residue, and these subunits belong to the family of N-terminal nucleophile (Ntn)hydrolases (where the nucleophilic N-terminal residue is, for example, Cys, Ser, Thr, and other nucleophilic moieties). This family includes, for example, penicillin G acylase (PGA), penicillin V acylase (PVA), glutamine PRPP amidotransferase (GAT), and bacterial glycosylasparaginase. In addition to the ubiquitously expressed β subunits, higher vertebrates also possess three interferon- γ- inducible β subunits (LMP7, LMP2 and MECL1), which replace their normal counterparts, β5, β1 and β2, respectively. When all three IFN- γinduciblc subunits are present, the protcasome is referred to as an “immunoprotcasome”. Thus, eukaryotic cells can possess two forms of proteasomes in varying ratios. Through the use of different peptide substrates, three major proteolytic activities have been defined for the eukaryote 20S proteasomes: chymotrypsin-like activity (CT-L), which cleaves after large hydrophobic residues; trypsin-like activity (T-L), which cleaves after basic residues; and peptidylglutamyl peptide hydrolyzing activity (PGPH), which cleaves after acidic residues. Two additional less characterized activities have also been ascribed to the proteasome: BrAAP activity, which cleaves after branched-chain amino acids; and SNAAP activity, which cleaves after small neutral amino acids. Although both forms of the proteasome possess all five enzymatic activities, differences in the extent of the activities between the forms have been described based on specific substrates. For both forms of the proteasome, the major proteasome proteolytic activities appear to be contributed by different catalytic sites within the 20S core. There are several examples of small molecules which have been used to inhibit proteasome activity; however, these compounds generally lack the specificity to delineate between the two forms of the proteasome. Thus, the ability to explore and exploit the roles of each specific protcasome form at the cellular and molecular level has not been possible. Therefore, the creation of small molecule inhibitor(s) that preferentially inhibit a single form of the proteasome is needed to allow the exploration of the roles of each proteasome form at the cellular and molecular level. Summary of the Invention One aspect of the invention relates to inhibitors that preferentially inhibit immunoproteasome activity over constitutive proteasome activity.

Detailed Description of the Invention The invention relates to compounds that are useful as enzyme inhibitors. These compounds are generally useful to inhibit enzymes having a nucleophilic group at the Νterminus. For example, activities of enzymes or enzyme subunits having N-terminal amino acids with nucleophiles in their side chains, such as threonine, serine, or cysteine can be successfully inhibited by the enzyme inhibitors described herein. Activities of enzymes or enzyme subunits having non-amino acid nucleophilic groups at their N-termini, such as, for example, protecting groups or carbohydrates, can also be successfully inhibited by the enzyme inhibitors described herein. While not bound by any particular theory of operation, it is believed that such N-terminal nucleophiles of Ntn form covalent adducts with the boronic acid or boronic ester functional group of the enzyme inhibitors as described herein. Regarding the stereochemistry, the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog rules for determining absolute stereochemistry are followed. These rules are described, for example, in Organic Chemistry, Fox and Whitesell; Jones and Bartlett Publishers, Boston, ΜΑ (1994); Section 5-6, ρρ 177-178, which section is hereby incorporated by reference. Peptides can have a repeating backbone structure with side chains extending from the backbone units. Generally, each backbone unit has a side chain associated with it, although in some cases, the side chain is a hydrogen atom. In other embodiments, not every backbone unit has an associated side chain. The side chains extending from the backbone units can include natural aliphatic or aromatic amino acid side chains, such as hydrogen (glycine), methyl (alanine), isopropyl (valine), sec-butyl (isoleucine), isobutyl (leucine), phenylmethyl (phenylalanine), and the side chain constituting the amino acid proline. The side chains can also be other branched or unbranched aliphatic or aromatic groups such as ethyl, n-propyl, n-butyl, t-butyl, and aryl substituted derivatives such as 1-phenylethyl, 2-phenylethyl, (l-naphthyl)methyl, (2-naphthyl)methyl, l-(l-naphthyl)ethyl, 1-(2-naphthyl)ethyl, 2-(l-naphthyl)ethyl, 2-(2-naphthyl)ethyl, and similar compounds. The aryl groups can be further substituted with branched or unbranched Ci_6alkyl groups, or substituted alkyl groups, acetyl and the like, or further aryl groups, or substituted aryl groups, such as benzoyl and the like. Heteroaryl groups can also be used as side chain substituents. Heteroaryl groups include nitrogen-, oxygen-, and sulfur-containing aryl groups such as thienyl, benzothienyl, naphthothienyl, thianthrenyl, furyl, pyranyl, isobenzofuranyl, chromenyl, pyrrolyl, imidazolyl, pyrazolyl, pyridyl, pyrazinyl, indolyl, purinyl, quinolyl, and the like. In some embodiments, polar or charged residues can be introduced into the peptide boronates. For example, naturally occurring amino acids such as hydroxy-containing (Thr, Tyr, Ser) or sulfur-containing (Met, Cys) can be introduced, as well as non-essential amino acids, for example, taurine, carnitine, citrulline, cystine, ornithine, norleucine and others. Non-naturally occurring side chain substituents with charged or polar moieties can also be included, such as, for example, Cl-6alkyl chains or C6-12aryl groups with one or more hydroxy, short chain alkoxy, sulfide, thio, carboxyl, ester, phospho, amido or amino groups, or such substituents substituted with one or more halogen atoms. In some preferred embodiments, there is at least one aryl group present in a side chain of the peptide moiety. In some embodiments, the backbone units are amide units [-NH-CHR-C(=0)-], in which R is the side chain. Such a designation does not exclude the naturally occurring amino acid proline, or other non-naturally occurring cyclic secondary amino acids, which will be recognized by those of skill in the art. In other embodiments, the backbone units are N-alkylated amide units (for example, N-methyl and the like), olefinic analogs (in which one or more amide bonds are replaced by olefinic bonds), tetrazole analogs (in which a tetrazole ring imposes a cis-configuration on the backbone), or combinations of such backbone linkages. In still other embodiments, the amino acid a-carbon is modified by a-alkyl substitution, for example, aminoisobutyric acid. In some further embodiments, side chains are locally modified, for example, by ΛΕ or ΑΖ dehydro modification, in which a double bond is present between the α and β atoms of the side chain, or for example by ΛΕ or ΑΖ cyclopropyl modification, in which a cyclopropyl group is present between the a and β atoms of the side chain. In still further embodiments employing amino acid groups, D-amino acids can be used. Further embodiments can include side chain-to-backbone cyclization, disulfide bond formation, lactam formation, azo linkage, and other modifications discussed in “Peptides and Mimics, Design of Conformationally Constrained” by Hruby and Boteju, in “Molecular Biology and Biotechnology: A Comprehensive Desk Reference”, ed.

Thus, prevention of cancer includes, for example, reducing the number of detectable cancerous growths in a population of patients receiving a prophylactic treatment relative to an untreated control population, and/or delaying the appearance of detectable cancerous growths in a treated population versus an untreated control population, e.g., by a statistically and/or clinically significant amount. Prevention of an infection includes, for example, reducing the number of diagnoses of the infection in a treated population versus an untreated control population, and/or delaying the onset of symptoms of the infection in a treated population versus an untreated control population. Prevention of pain includes, for example, reducing the magnitude of, or alternatively delaying, pain sensations experienced by subjects in a treated population versus an untreated control population. The term “prodrug” encompasses compounds that, under physiological conditions, are converted into therapeutically active agents. A common method for making a prodrug is to include selected moieties that are hydrolyzed under physiological conditions to reveal the desired molecule. In other embodiments, the prodrug is converted by an enzymatic activity of the host animal. The term “prophylactic or therapeutic” treatment is art-recognized and includes administration to the host of one or more of the subject compositions. If it is administered prior to clinical manifestation of the unwanted condition (e.g., disease or other unwanted state of the host animal) then the treatment is prophylactic, (i.e., it protects the host against developing the unwanted condition), whereas if it is administered after manifestation of the unwanted condition, the treatment is therapeutic, (i.e., it is intended to diminish, ameliorate, or stabilize the existing unwanted condition or side effects thereof). - 14- The term “substituted” refers to moieties having substituents replacing a hydrogen on one or more carbons of the backbone. It will be understood that “substitution” or “substituted with” includes the implicit proviso that such substitution is in accordance with permitted valence of the substituted atom and the substituent, and that the substitution results in a stable compound, e.g., which does not spontaneously undergo transformation such as by rearrangement, cyclization, elimination, etc. As used herein, the term “substituted” is contemplated to include all permissible substituents of organic compounds. In a broad aspect, the permissible substituents include acyclic and cyclic, branched and unbranched, carbocyclic and heterocyclic, aromatic and non-aromatic substituents of organic compounds. The permissible substituents can be one or more and the same or different for appropriate organic compounds. For purposes of this invention, the heteroatoms such as nitrogen may have hydrogen substituents and/or any permissible substituents of organic compounds described herein which satisfy the valences of the heteroatoms. Substituents can include, for example, a halogen, a hydroxyl, a carbonyl (such as a carboxyl, an alkoxycarbonyl, a formyl, or an acyl), a thiocarbonyl (such as a thioester, a thioacetate, or a thioformate), an alkoxyl, a phosphoryl, a phosphate, a phosphonate, a phosphinate, an amino, an amido, an amidine, an imine, a cyano, a nitro, an azido, a sulfhydryl, an alkylthio, a sulfate, a sulfonate, a sulfamoyl, a sulfonamido, a sulfonyl, a heterocyclyl, an aralkyl, or an aromatic or heteroaromatic moiety. It will be understood by those skilled in the art that the moieties substituted on the hydrocarbon chain can themselves be substituted, if appropriate. A “therapeutically effective amount” of a compound with respect to the subject method of treatment, refers to an amount of the compound(s) in a preparation which, when administered as part of a desired dosage regimen (to a mammal, preferably a human) alleviates a symptom, ameliorates a condition, or slows the onset of disease conditions according to clinically acceptable standards for the disorder or condition to be treated or the cosmetic purpose, e.g., at a reasonable benefit/risk ratio applicable to any medical treatment. The term “thioether” refers to an alkyl group, as defined above, having a sulfur moiety attached thereto. In preferred embodiments, the “thioether” is represented by -Salkyl. Representative thioether groups include methylthio, ethylthio, and the like. - 15 - As used herein, the term “treating” or “treatment” includes reversing, reducing, or arresting the symptoms, clinical signs, and underlying pathology of a condition in manner to improve or stabilize a subject's condition. Uses of Enzyme Inhibitors The biological consequences of proteasome inhibition are numerous. Proteasome inhibition has been suggested as a prevention and/or treatment of a multitude of diseases including, but not limited to, proliferative diseases, neurotoxic/degenerative diseases, ischemic conditions, inflammation, immune-related diseases, HIV, cancers, organ graft rejection, septic shock, viral and parasitic infections, conditions associated with acidosis, macular degeneration, pulmonary conditions, muscle wasting diseases, fibrotic diseases, bone and hair growth diseases. Proteasome inhibitors can be used to treat conditions mediated directly by the proteolytic function of the proteasome such as muscle wasting, or mediated indirectly via proteins which are processed by the proteasome such as NF-kB. The proteasome participates in the rapid elimination and post-translational processing of proteins (e.g., enzymes) involved in cellular regulation (e.g., cell cycle, gene transcription, and metabolic pathways), intercellular communication, and the immune response (e.g., antigen presentation). At the cellular level, the accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins, cell morphological changes, and apoptosis have been reported upon treatment of cells with various proteasome inhibitors. Yet, it should be noted that commercially available proteasome inhibitors inhibit both the constitutive and immuno forms of the proteasome. Even bortezomib, the only FDA-approved proteasome inhibitor for the treatment of relapsed multiple myeloma patients, does not distinguish between the two forms (Altun et ah, Cancer Res 65:7896, 2005). Thus, what is known about therapeutic proteasome inhibition is based on work with molecules that inhibit both forms of the proteasome. Accordingly, compounds of the invention may be beneficial for reducing the severity of side effects associated with molecules that inhibit both forms of the proteasome. Immunoproteasome expression occurs predominantly in cells and organs that make up the lymphatic system, such as white blood cells(leukocytes), bone marrow, and the thymus, spleen and lymph nodes. Although some organs preferentially express constitutive - 16- proteasomes (e.g., heart), others such as adrenal, liver, lung and gut, appear to express both forms. The immune system, of which leukocytes and lymphoid tissues play a major role, is responsible for protecting an organism from outside biological influences. When functioning properly, it protects the body against bacterial and viral infections. The immune system also screens for autologous cells that have undergone oncogenic transformation. Intracellular proteolysis generates small peptides for presentation to T-lymphocytes to induce MHC class I-mediated immune responses. The proteasome is the main provider of these precursor peptides, however, differences between antigenic peptides have been observed between cells with varying amounts of each proteasome form (Cascio et al., ΕΜΒΟ J 20:2357-2366, 2001). In certain embodiments, the invention relates to a method for inhibiting antigen presentation in a cell, including exposing the cell to a compound as described herein. In certain embodiments, the invention relates to a method for altering the repertoire of antigenic peptides produced by the proteasome or other Ntn with multicatalytic activity. For example, if the activity of the immunoproteasome proteasome is selectively inhibited, a different set of antigenic peptides may be produced by the remaining constitutive proteasome and presented in MHC molecules on the surfaces of cells than would be produced and presented without any enzyme inhibition. Several disorders and disease states have been associated with aberrant immune system function, herein referred to as immune-related conditions. Perhaps the most common immune-related condition is the allergic disorders such as allergies, asthma and atopic dermatitis like eczema. These occur when the immune system overreacts to exposure to antigens in the environment. Thus, a further embodiment is a method for suppressing the immune system of a subject, comprising administering to the subject an effective amount of a proteasome inhibitor compound in a manner described herein. Immunodeficiency disorders occur when a part of the immune system is not working properly or is not present. They can affect Β lymophyctes, Τ lymphocytes, or phagocytes and be either inherited (e.g., IgA deficiency, severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), thymic dysplasia and chronic granulomatous) or acquired (e.g., acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and drug-induced - 17- immunodeficiencies). A dosing strategy utilizing selective proteasome inhibitors of the invention may be used to treat immune-related conditions such as immunodeficiency disorders. In autoimmune disorders, the immune system inappropriately attacks the body’s healthy organs and tissues as if they were foreign invaders. An example of an autoimmune disease is Sjogren’s Syndrome, which is characterized by infiltration and focal accumulation of lymphocytes in the exocrine glands. A study examining the proteasome expression level revealed a significant up-regulation of beta5i (LMP7) exclusively in the salivary glands of SS patients (Egerer et al., Arthritis Rheum 54:1501-8, 2006). Other examples of such immune-related conditions include lupus (such as lupus nephritis and systemic lupus erythamotosus), rheumatoid arthritis (such as juvenile rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic rheumatoid arthritis), scleroderma, ankylosing spondylitis, dermatomyositis, psoriasis, multiple sclerosis (both relapsing remitting and chronic progressive forms) and inflammatory bowel disease (such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease). Tissue/organ transplant rejection occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks the cells being introduced to the host’s body. Graft versus host disease (GVHD), resulting from allogenic transplantation, arises when the Τ cells from the donor tissue go on the offensive and attack the host’s tissues. In all three circumstances, autoimmune disease, transplant rejection and GVHD, modulating the immune system by treating the subject with a compound of the invention could be beneficial. Inflammation is the first response of the immune system to infection or irritation. A cellular component of inflammation involves the movement of leukocytes, which express immunoproteasome, from blood vessels into the inflamed tissue. These cells take on the important role of removing the irritant, bacteria, parasite or cell debris. Proteasome inhibitors are already known to have anti-inflammatory activity (Meng et al., PNAS 96:10403-10408, 1999). In cases of chronic inflammation, which is characterized by a dominating presence of macrophages, the cells that originally served as defensive agents begin to release toxins and cytokines, including TNF-a, now become injurious to the body, resulting in tissue damage and loss. In certain embodiments, the invention relates to a method of treating inflammation and inflammatory diseases comprising administering a compound as described herein. Inflammatory diseases include acute (e.g., bronchitis, - 18 - conjunctivitis, pancreatitis) and chronic conditions (e.g., chronic cholecstitis, bronchiectasis, aortic valve stenosis, restenosis, psoriasis and arthritis), along with conditions associated with inflammation such as fibrosis, infection and ischemia. In certain embodiments, the invention relates to methods of treating conditions whereby an organ is inflamed, such as autoimmune myocarditis and autoimmune thyroiditis. Following tissue damage, including damage due to the inflammation process, progression of regeneration and repair begins. During the regeneration step, lost tissue is replaced by proliferation of cells of the same type, which reconstruct the normal architecture. However, improper regeneration of the tissue architecture may have severe consequences. In some cases of chronic inflammatory liver disease, the regenerated tissue forms an abnormal nodular architecture leading to cirrhosis and portal hypertension. The repair process results in lost tissue being replaced by a fibrous scar which is produced from granulation tissue. Fibrosis is the excessive and persistent formation of scar tissue resulting from the hyperproliferative growth of fibroblasts and is associated with activation of the TGF-P signaling pathway. Fibrosis involves extensive deposition of extracellular matrix and can occur within virtually any tissue or across several different tissues. Normally, the level of intracellular signaling protein (Srnad) that activate transcription of target genes upon TGF-(5 stimulation is regulated by proteasome activity (Xu et al., 2000). However, accelerated degradation of the TGF-p signaling components has been observed in cancers and other hyperproliferative conditions. Thus, in certain embodiments, the invention relates to a method for treating a hyperproliferative condition selected from diabetes (such as type 1, type 2 and metabolic syndrome), diabetic retinopathy, macular degeneration, diabetic nephropathy, glomerulosclerosis, IgA nephropathy, cirrhosis, biliary atresia, congestive heart failure, scleroderma, radiation-induced fibrosis, and lung fibrosis (idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, collagen vascular disease, sarcoidosis, interstitial lung diseases and extrinsic lung disorders), comprising administering a compound as described herein. The treatment of bum victims is often hampered by fibrosis, thus, in certain embodiments, the invention relates to the topical or systemic administration of a compound as described herein to treat bums. Wound closure following surgery is often associated with disfiguring scars, which may be prevented by inhibition of fibrosis. Thus, in certain embodiments, the invention relates to a - 19- method for the prevention or reduction of scarring, comprising administering a compound as described herein. Infection by bacteria, parasite or virus all result in initiation of the inflammatory process. When the resulting inflammation overwhelms the whole organism, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) occurs. The term sepsis is applied when this is due to infection. Overproduction of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced cytokines such as TNFa is considered to be central to the processes associated with septic shock. Not surprisingly, LPS also induces an increase in all components of the MHC-1 pathway including the immunoproteasome subunits LMP2 and LMP7 (MacAry et al., PNAS 98:3982-3987, 2001). Furthermore, it is generally accepted that the first step in the activation of cells by LPS is the binding of LPS to specific membrane receptors. The α- and P-subunits of the 20S proteasome complex have been identified as LPS-binding proteins, suggesting that the LPSinduced signal transduction may be an important therapeutic target in the treatment or prevention of sepsis (Qureshi, Ν. et al., J. Immun. (2003) 171: 1515-1525). Therefore, in certain embodiments, the invention relates to preventing or treating septic shock, comprising administering a compound as disclosed herein. In another embodiment, the disclosed compositions are useful for the treatment of a parasitic infection, such as infections caused by protozoan parasites. The proteasome of these parasites is considered to be involved primarily in cell differentiation and replication activities (Paugam et al., Trends Parasitol. 2003, 19(2): 55-59). Furthermore, entamoeba species have been shown to lose encystation capacity when exposed to proteasome inhibitors (Gonzales, et al., Arch. Med. Res. 1997, 28, Spec No: 139-140). In certain such embodiments, the compounds as disclosed herein are useful for the treatment of parasitic infections in humans caused by a protozoan parasite selected from Plasmodium sps. (including Ρ. falciparum, Ρ. vivax, Ρ. malariae, and Ρ. ovale, which cause malaria), Trypanosoma sps. (including Τ. cruzi, which causes Chagas’ disease, and Τ. bmcei which causes African sleeping sickness), Leishmania sps. (including L. amazonesis, L. donovani, L. infantum, L. mexicana, etc.), Pneumocystis carinii (a protozoan known to cause pneumonia in AIDS and other immunosuppressed patients), Toxoplasma gondii, Entamoeba histolytica, Entamoeba invadens, and Giardia lamblia. In certain embodiments, the disclosed compositions are useful for the treatment of parasitic infections in animals and livestock caused by a protozoan parasite selected from Plasmodium hermani, Cryptosporidium sps., Echinococcus granulosus, Eimeria tenella, Sarcocystis neurona, and Neurospora crassa. Other compounds useful as proteasome inhibitors in the treatment of parasitic diseases are described in WO 98/10779, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In certain embodiments, compounds disclosed herein may inhibit proteasome activity in a parasite without recovery in white blood cells. In certain such embodiments, the long half-life of blood cells may provide prolonged protection with regard to therapy against recurring exposures to parasites. In certain embodiments, the compounds as described herein may provide prolonged protection with regard to chemoprophylaxis against future infection. Viral infections contribute to the pathology of many diseases. Heart conditions such as ongoing myocarditis and dilated cardiomyopathy have been linked to the coxsackievirus Β3. In a comparative whole-genome microarray analyses of infected mouse hearts, all three immunoproteasome subunits were uniformly up-regulated in hearts of mice which developed chronic myocarditis (Szalay et al., Am J Pathol 168:1542-52, 2006). Some viruses utilize the ubiquitin-proteasome system in the viral entry step where the virus is released from the endosome into the cytosol. The mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) belongs to the Coronaviridae family, which also includes the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronvirus. Yu and Lai (J Virol 79:644-648, 2005) demonstrated that treatment of cells infected with MHV with a proteasome inhibitor resulted in a decrease in viral replication, correlating with reduced viral titer as compared to that of untreated cells. The human hepatitis Β virus (HBV), a member of the Hepadnaviridae virus family, requires virally encoded envelop proteins to propagate. Inhibiting the proteasome degradation pathway causes a significant reduction in the amount of secreted envelope proteins (Simsek et al., J Virol 79:12914-12920, 2005). In addition to HBV, other hepatitis viruses (A, C, D and Ε) may also utilize the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation pathway for secretion, morphogenesis and pathogenesis. Accordingly, in certain embodiments the invention relates to treating a viral infection, comprising administering a compound as disclosed herein. The bacterium Listeria monocytogenes causes a condition known as listeriosis, the manifestations of which range from mild (nausea, vomiting and diarrhea) to severe -21 - (septicemia, meningitis, encephalitis). A quantitative analysis of changes in proteasome subunit composition revealed that infection of mice with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus or Listeria monocytogenes lead to an almost complete replacement of constitutive proteasomes by immunoproteasomes in the liver within seven days (Khan et al., J Immunol 167:6859-6868, 2001). Prokaryotes have what is equivalent to the eukaryote 20S proteasome particle. While the subunit composition of the prokaryote 20S particle is simpler than that of eukaryotes, it does have the ability to hydrolyze peptide bonds in a similar manner. For example, the nucleophilic attack on the peptide bond occurs through the threonine residue on the N-terminus of the [i-subunits. Thus, in certain embodiments, the invention relates to a method of treating prokaryotic infections, comprising administering a compound as disclosed herein. Prokaryotic infections may include diseases caused by either mycobacteria (such as tuberculosis, leprosy or Buruli Ulcer) or archaebacteria. In certain embodiments, the invention relates to a method for treating infection (e.g., bacterial, parasitic or viral), comprising contacting a cell with a compound as disclosed herein. In certain alternative embodiments, the invention relates to a method for treating infection, comprising administering a compound as disclosed herein. Ischemia and reperfusion injury results in hypoxia, a condition in which there is a deficiency of oxygen reaching the tissues of the body. This condition causes increased degradation of 1κ-Βα, thereby resulting in the activation of NF-kB (Koong et al., 1994). Interestingly, factors which have been identified as being able to enhance immunoproteasome expression, TNF-a and lipopolysaccharide, also stimulate NF-kB activation. It has been demonstrated that the severity of injury resulting in hypoxia can be reduced with the administration of a proteasome inhibitor (Gao et al., 2000; Bao et al., 2001; Pye et al., 2003). Therefore, in certain embodiments the invention relates to a method of treating an ischemic condition or reperfusion injury, comprising administering a compound as disclosed herein. Examples of such conditions or injuries include, but are not limited to, acute coronary syndrome (vulnerable plaques), arterial occlusive disease (cardiac, cerebral, peripheral arterial and vascular occlusions), atherosclerosis (coronary sclerosis, coronary artery disease), infarctions, heart failure, pancreatitis, myocardial hypertrophy, stenosis, and restenosis. Cachexia is a syndrome characterized by wasting of skeletal muscle associated with enhanced proteolysis due to the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Inhibiting the proteasome reduces proteolysis, thereby reducing both muscle protein loss and the nitrogenous load on kidneys or liver (Tawa et al., JCI 100:197-203, 1997). In cachexia, elevated expression of proinflammatory cytokines, TNF-a and IFN-y, both of which stimulate expression of immunoproteasome subunits, have been reported (Acharyya et al., JCI 114:370-378, 2004). In fact, most types of muscle atrophy exhibit elevated rates of protein degradation (Lecker et al., FASEB J 18:39-51, 2004). Muscle wasting manifests itself in several life threatening diseases, including cancer, sepsis, renal failure, AIDS, fasting, denervation atrophy, acidosis, diabetes, disuse atrophy and congestive heart failure. In certain embodiments, the invention relates to the treatment of cachexia or muscle-wasting disease, comprising administering a compound as disclosed herein. Compounds of the invention may be useful for treating conditions such as cancer, chronic infectious diseases, fever, muscle disuse (atrophy) and denervation, nerve injury, fasting, renal failure associated with acidosis, and hepatic failure. See, e.g., Goldberg, U.S. Patent No. 5,340,736. Degradation of certain proteins by the proteasome effect signaling mechanisms that, in turn, effect gene transcription, cell cycle and metabolic pathways. As noted above, proteasome inhibitors block both degradation and processing of ubiquitinated NF-kB in vitro and in vivo. Proteasome inhibitors also block 1κΒ-Α degradation and NF-kB activation (Palombella et al., Cell (1994) 78:773-785; and Traenckner et al., ΕΜΒΟ J. (1994) 13:5433-5441). In certain embodiments, the invention relates to a method for inhibiting 1κΒ-α degradation, comprising contacting the cell with a compound as described herein. In certain embodiments, the invention relates to methods for affecting cyclindependent eukaryotic cell cycles, including exposing a cell (in vitro or in vivo) to a compound as disclosed herein. Cyclins are proteins involved in cell cycle control. The proteasome participates in the degradation of cyclins. Examples of cyclins include mitotic cyclins, G1 cyclins, and cyclin Β. Degradation of cyclins enables a cell to exit one cell cycle stage (e.g., mitosis) and enter another (e.g., division). It is believed all cyclins are associated with p34cdc2 protein kinase or related kinases. The proteolysis targeting signal is localized to amino acids 42- 50 (destruction box). There is evidence that cyclin is converted to a form -23 - vulnerable to a ubiquitin ligase or that a cyclin-specific ligase is activated during mitosis (Ciechanover, A., Cell, (1994) 79:13-21). Inhibition of the proteasome inhibits cyclin degradation, and therefore inhibits cell proliferation, for example, in cyclin-related cancers (Kumatori et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA (1990) 87:7071-7075). In certain embodiments, the invention relates to a method for treating a proliferative disease in a subject (e.g., cancer, psoriasis, or restenosis), comprising administering a compound as disclosed herein. In certain embodiments, the invention also relates to a method for treating cyclin-rclated inflammation, comprising adminstering a compound as described herein. In maturing reticulocytes and growing fibroblasts, or cells deprived of insulin or serum, the rate of proteolysis nearly doubles, suggesting a role for the proteasome in cellular metabolism. Accordingly, in certain embodiments, the invention relates to methods for reducing the rate of intracellular protein degradation in a cell. Each of these methods comprises contacting a cell (in vivo or in vitro) with a compound as disclosed herein. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease disorder associated with a loss of higher cognitive function. Pathological hallmarks of the disease include senile amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, dystrophic neuritis and significant neuronal loss in selected regions of the brain. Microglia, the resident macrophages in the brain, release numerous proinflammatory cytokines, including TNF-a, when activated by Αβ42, a peptide associated with neuritic and vascular amyloid plaques. This microglialmediated inflammatory response contributes to significant neuronal loss. Cell-based studies demonstrated that primary cortical neurons treated with conditioned media from microglial ΒΥ2 cells stimulated either with FPS/INF-y or sonicated Αβ42 peptides resulted in approximately a 60% decrease in cell viability (Gan et al., J. Biol. Chem. 279:5565-5572, 2004). A higher expression of immunoproteasome is found in brain tissue from AD patients than in that of non-demented elderly adults (Mishto et al., Neurobiol Aging 27:54-66, 2006). Patients suffering from Huntington’s disease (HD), another neurodegenerative disorder, display motor dysfunction and cognitive decline over a period of years until death. Upon autopsy, the presence of inclusions or intraneuronal aggregates, caused by a polyQ expansion mutation (also referred to as a CAG triplet repeat expansion), can be detected, accompanied by significant atrophy in the striatum and cortex portions of the brain. Immunohistochemistry revealed that there was a significant enhancement in immunoproteasome expression in the striatum and frontal cortex of brains from HD patients as compared to those from age-matched normal adults (Diaz-Hemandez et al., J Neurosci 23:11653-1161, 2003). Upon further analysis, it was discovered that the enhancement predominantly occurred in the degenerating neurons. Using a mouse model of HD, the researchers noted a selective increase in both chymotrypsin- and trypsin-like activities in the affected and aggregate-containing regions of the brain, primarily the cortex and striatum (Diaz-Hemandez et al, J Neurosci 23:11653-1161, 2003). Accordingly, certain embodiments of the invention relate to a method for treating a neurodegenerative disease or condition, comprising administering a compound as disclosed herein. Neurodegenerative diseases and conditions include, but are not limited to, stroke, ischemic damage to the nervous system, neural trauma (e.g., percussive brain damage, spinal cord injury, and traumatic damage to the nervous system), multiple sclerosis and other immune-mediated neuropathies (e.g., Guillain-Barre syndrome and its variants, acute motor axonal neuropathy, acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, and Fisher Syndrome), H1V/A1DS dementia complex, axonomy, diabetic neuropathy, Parkinson’s disease, Huntington's disease, multiple sclerosis, bacterial, parasitic, fungal, and viral meningitis, encephalitis, vascular dementia, multi-infarct dementia, Lewy body dementia, frontal lobe dementia such as Pick’s disease, subcortical dementias (such as Huntington or progressive supranuclear palsy), focal cortical atrophy syndromes (such as primary aphasia), metabolic-toxic dementias (such as chronic hypothyroidism or Β12 deficiency), and dementias caused by infections (such as syphilis or chronic meningitis). It has also been demonstrated that inhibitors that bind to the 20S proteasome stimulate bone formation in bone organ cultures. Furthermore, when such inhibitors have been administered systemically to mice, certain proteasome inhibitors increased bone volume and bone formation rates over 70% (Garrett, I. R. et al., J. Clin. Invest. (2003) 111: 1771-1782), therefore suggesting that the ubiquitin-proteasome machinery regulates osteoblast differentiation and bone formation. Therefore, the disclosed proteasome inhibitor compositions may be useful in the treatment and/or prevention of diseases associated with bone loss, such as osteroporosis. -25 - Cancer is a general term for disease characterized by uncontrolled, abnormal growth of cells. Many cancers arise via multistep pathways involving inactivation of tumor suppressor proteins and activation of oncogenic peptides. Cancer cells can spread to other parts of the body through the lymphatic system or blood stream. Usually, cancer is classified according to the type of tissue or cell most prominently involved. As noted previously, proteasome inhibition has already been validated as a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of cancer, particularly multiple myeloma. Multiple myeloma cells possess both forms of the proteasome, although the ratio can vary somewhat. Multiple myeloma is a hematologic disease characterized by an excessive number of abnormal plasma cells in the bone marrow. Plasma cells develop from B-cells, thus it is not surprising that other B-cell malignancies would also express immunoproteasome to some extent. Except for two chronic mylogenous leukemia cell lines, heme-related cancers (e.g., multiple myeloma, leukemias and lymphomas) generally appear to express immunoproteasome. Cancer cells originating from lymphoid cells express 30% or more immunoproteasome. In certain embodiments, the invention relates to a method for the treatment of cancer, comprising administering a compound as described herein. In certain preferred embodiments, the cancer is a heme-related disorder. In certain embodiments, the cancer is selected from a solid tumor, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, cervical carcinoma and small cell lung carcinoma. The treatment of the cells with INF-y can induce immunoproteasome expression. Therefore, in certain embodiments, the invention relates to a method of treating cancer comprising administering a compound as disclosed herein. Administration Compounds prepared as described herein can be administered in various forms, depending on the disorder to be treated and the age, condition, and body weight of the patient, as is well known in the art. For example, where the compounds are to be administered orally, they may be formulated as tablets, capsules, granules, powders, or syrups; or for parenteral administration, they may be formulated as injections (intravenous, intramuscular, or subcutaneous), drop infusion preparations, or suppositories. For application by the ophthalmic mucous membrane route, they may be formulated as eye drops or eye ointments. These formulations can be prepared by conventional means, and if desired, the active ingredient may be mixed with any conventional additive or excipient, such as a binder, a disintegrating agent, a lubricant, a corrigent, a solubilizing agent, a suspension aid, an emulsifying agent, a coating agent, a cyclodextrin, and/or a buffer. Although the dosage will vary depending on the symptoms, age and body weight of the patient, the nature and severity of the disorder to be treated or prevented, the route of administration and the form of the drug, in general, a daily dosage of from 0.01 to 2000 mg of the compound is recommended for an adult human patient, and this may be administered in a single dose or in divided doses. The amount of active ingredient which can be combined with a carrier material to produce a single dosage form will generally be that amount of the compound which produces a therapeutic effect. The precise time of administration and/or amount of the composition that will yield the most effective results in terms of efficacy of treatment in a given patient will depend upon the activity, pharmacokinetics, and bioavailability of a particular compound, physiological condition of the patient (including age, sex, disease type and stage, general physical condition, responsiveness to a given dosage, and type of medication), route of administration, etc. However, the above guidelines can be used as the basis for fine-tuning the treatment, e.g., determining the optimum time and/or amount of administration, which will require no more than routine experimentation consisting of monitoring the subject and adjusting the dosage and/or timing. The phrase “pharmaceutically acceptable” is employed herein to refer to those ligands, materials, compositions, and/or dosage forms which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of human beings and animals without excessive toxicity, irritation, allergic response, or other problem or complication, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio. The phrase “pharmaceutically acceptable carrier” as used herein means a pharmaceutically acceptable material, composition, or vehicle, such as a liquid or solid filler, diluent, excipient, solvent or encapsulating material. Each carrier must be “acceptable” in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not injurious to the patient. Some examples of materials which can serve as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include: (1) sugars, such as lactose, glucose, and sucrose; (2) starches, such as com starch, potato starch, and substituted or unsubstituted (i-cyclodcxtrin; (3) cellulose, and its derivatives, such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose, and cellulose acetate; (4) powdered tragacanth; (5) malt; (6) gelatin; (7) talc; (8) excipients, such as cocoa butter and suppository waxes; (9) oils, such as peanut oil, cottonseed oil, safflower oil, sesame oil, olive oil, com oil, and soybean oil; (10) glycols, such as propylene glycol; (11) polyols, such as glycerin, sorbitol, mannitol, and polyethylene glycol; (12) esters, such as ethyl oleate and ethyl laurate; (13) agar; (14) buffering agents, such as magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide; (15) alginic acid; (16) pyrogen-free water; (17) isotonic saline; (18) Ringer’s solution; (19) ethyl alcohol; (20) phosphate buffer solutions; and (21) other non-toxic compatible substances employed in pharmaceutical formulations. In certain embodiments, pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention are non-pyrogenic, i.e., do not induce significant temperature elevations when administered to a patient. The term “pharmaceutically acceptable salt” refers to the relatively non-toxic, inorganic and organic acid addition salts of the inhibitor(s). These salts can be prepared in situ during the final isolation and purification of the inhibitor(s), or by separately reacting a purified inhibitor(s) in its free base form with a suitable organic or inorganic acid, and isolating the salt thus formed. Representative salts include the hydrobromide, hydrochloride, sulfate, bisulfate, phosphate, nitrate, acetate, valerate, oleate, palmitate, stearate, laurate, benzoate, lactate, phosphate, tosylate, citrate, maleate, fumarate, succinate, tartrate, naphthylate, mesylate, glucoheptonate, lactobionate, laurylsulphonate salts, and amino acid salts, and the like. (See, for example, Berge et al. (1977) “Pharmaceutical Salts”, J. Pharm. Sci. 66: 1-19.) In other cases, the inhibitors useful in the methods of the present invention may contain one or more acidic functional groups and, thus, are capable of forming pharmaceutically acceptable salts with pharmaceutically acceptable bases. The term “pharmaceutically acceptable salts” in these instances refers to the relatively non-toxic inorganic and organic base addition salts of an inhibitor(s). These salts can likewise be prepared in situ during the final isolation and purification of the inhibitor(s), or by separately reacting the purified inhibitor(s) in its free acid form with a suitable base, such as the hydroxide, carbonate, or bicarbonate of a pharmaceutically acceptable metal cation, with -28 - ammonia, or with a pharmaceutically acceptable organic primary, secondary, or tertiary amine. Representative alkali or alkaline earth salts include the lithium, sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and aluminum salts, and the like. Representative organic amines useful for the formation of base addition salts include ethylamine, diethylamine, ethylenediamine, ethanolamine, diethanolamine, piperazine, and the like (see, for example, Berge et al., supra). Wetting agents, emulsifiers, and lubricants, such as sodium lauryl sulfate and magnesium stearate, as well as coloring agents, release agents, coating agents, sweetening, flavoring, and perfuming agents, preservatives and antioxidants can also be present in the compositions. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable antioxidants include: (1) water soluble antioxidants, such as ascorbic acid, cysteine hydrochloride, sodium bisulfate, sodium metabisulfite, sodium sulfite, and the like; (2) oil-soluble antioxidants, such as ascorbyl palmitate, butylated hydroxyanisole (ΒΗΑ), butylated hydroxytoluene (ΒΗΤ), lecithin, propyl gallate, alpha-tocopherol, and the like; and (3) metal chelating agents, such as citric acid, ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), sorbitol, tartaric acid, phosphoric acid, and the like. Formulations suitable for oral administration may be in the form of capsules, cachets, pills, tablets, lozenges (using a flavored basis, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth), powders, granules, or as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous or non-aqueous liquid, or as an oil-in-water or water-in-oil liquid emulsion, or as an elixir or syrup, or as pastilles (using an inert matrix, such as gelatin and glycerin, or sucrose and acacia) and/or as mouthwashes, and the like, each containing a predetermined amount of an inhibitor(s) as an active ingredient. A composition may also be administered as a bolus, electuary, or paste. In solid dosage forms for oral administration (capsules, tablets, pills, dragees, powders, granules, and the like), the active ingredient is mixed with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, such as sodium citrate or dicalcium phosphate, and/or any of the following: (1) fillers or extenders, such as starches, cyclodextrins, lactose, sucrose, glucose, mannitol, and/or silicic acid; (2) binders, such as, for example, carboxymethylcellulose, alginates, gelatin, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, sucrose, and/or acacia; (3) humectants, such as glycerol; (4) disintegrating agents, such as agar-agar, calcium carbonate, potato or tapioca starch, alginic acid, certain silicates, and sodium carbonate; (5) solution retarding agents, such as paraffin; (6) absorption accelerators, such as quaternary ammonium compounds; (7) wetting agents, such as, for example, acetyl alcohol and glycerol monostearate; (8) absorbents, such as kaolin and bentonite clay; (9) lubricants, such a talc, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, solid polyethylene glycols, sodium lauryl sulfate, and mixtures thereof; and (10) coloring agents.

Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in soft and hard-filled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugars, as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols, and the like. A tablet may be made by compression or molding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared using binder (for example, gelatin or hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose), lubricant, inert diluent, preservative, disintegrant (for example, sodium starch glycolate or cross-linked sodium carboxymethyl cellulose), surface-active or dispersing agent. Molded tablets may be made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered inhibitor(s) moistened with an inert liquid diluent. Tablets, and other solid dosage forms, such as dragees, capsules, pills, and granules, may optionally be scored or prepared with coatings and shells, such as enteric coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical-formulating art. They may also be formulated so as to provide slow or controlled release of the active ingredient therein using, for example, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose in varying proportions to provide the desired release profile, other polymer matrices, liposomes, and/or microspheres. They may be sterilized by, for example, filtration through a bacteria-retaining filter, or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid compositions which can be dissolved in sterile water, or some other sterile injectable medium immediately before use. These compositions may also optionally contain opacifying agents and may be of a composition that they release the active ingredient(s) only, or preferentially, in a certain portion of the gastrointestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions which can be used include polymeric substances and waxes. The active ingredient can also be in microencapsulated form, if appropriate, with one or more of the above-described excipients. Liquid dosage forms for oral administration include pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, microemulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups, and elixirs. In addition to the active ingredient, the liquid dosage forms may contain inert diluents commonly used in the art, such as, for example, water or other solvents, solubilizing agents, and emulsifiers such as ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, oils (in particular, cottonseed, groundnut, com, germ, olive, castor, and sesame oils), glycerol, tetrahydrofuryl alcohol, polyethylene glycols, and fatty acid esters of sorbitan, and mixtures thereof. Besides inert diluents, the oral compositions can also include adjuvants such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, sweetening, flavoring, coloring, perfuming, and preservative agents. Suspensions, in addition to the active inhibitor(s) may contain suspending agents as, for example, ethoxylated isostearyl alcohols, polyoxyethylene sorbitol and sorbitan esters, microcrystalline cellulose, aluminum metahydroxide, bentonite, agar-agar and tragacanth, and mixtures thereof. Formulations for rectal or vaginal administration may be presented as a suppository, which may be prepared by mixing one or more inhibitors) with one or more suitable nonirritating excipients or carriers comprising, for example, cocoa butter, polyethylene glycol, a suppository wax or a salicylate, which is solid at room temperature, but liquid at body temperature and, therefore, will melt in the rectum or vaginal cavity and release the active agent. Formulations which are suitable for vaginal administration also include pessaries, tampons, creams, gels, pastes, foams, or spray formulations containing such carriers as are known in the art to be appropriate. Dosage forms for the topical or transdermal administration of an inhibitor(s) include powders, sprays, ointments, pastes, creams, lotions, gels, solutions, patches, and inhalants. The active component may be mixed under sterile conditions with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, and with any preservatives, buffers, or propellants which may be required. -31 - The ointments, pastes, creams, and gels may contain, in addition to inhibitor(s), excipients, such as animal and vegetable fats, oils, waxes, paraffins, starch, tragacanth, cellulose derivatives, polyethylene glycols, silicones, bentonites, silicic acid, talc, and zinc oxide, or mixtures thereof. Powders and sprays can contain, in addition to an inhibitor(s), excipients such as lactose, talc, silicic acid, aluminum hydroxide, calcium silicates, and polyamide powder, or mixtures of these substances. Sprays can additionally contain customary propellants, such as chlorofluorohydrocarbons and volatile unsubstituted hydrocarbons, such as butane and propane. The inhibitor(s) can be alternatively administered by aerosol. This is accomplished by preparing an aqueous aerosol, liposomal preparation, or solid particles containing the composition. A nonaqueous (e.g., fluorocarbon propellant) suspension could be used. Sonic nebulizers are preferred because they minimize exposing the agent to shear, which can result in degradation of the compound. Ordinarily, an aqueous aerosol is made by formulating an aqueous solution or suspension of the agent together with conventional pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and stabilizers. The carriers and stabilizers vary with the requirements of the particular composition, but typically include nonionic surfactants (Tweens, Pluronics, sorbitan esters, lecithin, Cremophors), pharmaceutically acceptable co-solvents such as polyethylene glycol, innocuous proteins like serum albumin, oleic acid, amino acids such as glycine, buffers, salts, sugars, or sugar alcohols. Aerosols generally are prepared from isotonic solutions. Transdermal patches have the added advantage of providing controlled delivery of an inhibitor(s) to the body. Such dosage forms can be made by dissolving or dispersing the agent in the proper medium. Absorption enhancers can also be used to increase the flux of the inhibitor(s) across the skin. The rate of such flux can be controlled by either providing a rate controlling membrane or dispersing the inhibitors) in a polymer matrix or gel. Pharmaceutical compositions of this invention suitable for parenteral administration comprise one or more inhibitors(s) in combination with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable sterile aqueous or nonaqueous solutions, dispersions, suspensions or emulsions, or sterile powders which may be reconstituted into sterile injectable solutions or dispersions just prior to use, which may contain antioxidants, buffers, bacteriostats, solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient or suspending or thickening agents. Examples of suitable aqueous and nonaqueous carriers which may be employed in the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention include water, ethanol, polyols (such as glycerol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, and the like), and suitable mixtures thereof, vegetable oils, such as olive oil, and injectable organic esters, such as ethyl oleate. Proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of coating materials, such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions, and by the use of surfactants. These compositions may also contain adjuvants such as preservatives, wetting agents, emulsifying agents, and dispersing agents. Prevention of the action of microorganisms may be ensured by the inclusion of various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, paraben, chlorobutanol, phenol sorbic acid, and the like. It may also be desirable to include tonicity-adjusting agents, such as sugars, sodium chloride, and the like into the compositions. In addition, prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form may be brought about by the inclusion of agents which delay absorption such as aluminum monostearate and gelatin. In some cases, in order to prolong the effect of a drug, it is desirable to slow the absorption of the drug from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. For example, delayed absorption of a parenterally administered drug form is accomplished by dissolving or suspending the drug in an oil vehicle. Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsule matrices of inhibitor(s) in biodegradable polymers such as polylactide-polyglycolide. Depending on the ratio of drug to polymer, and the nature of the particular polymer employed, the rate of drug release can be controlled. Examples of other biodegradable polymers include poly(orthoesters) and poly(anhydrides). Depot injectable formulations are also prepared by entrapping the drug in liposomes or microemulsions which are compatible with body tissue. The preparations of agents may be given orally, parenterally, topically, or rectally. They are, of course, given by forms suitable for each administration route. For example, they -33 - are administered in tablets or capsule form, by injection, inhalation, eye lotion, ointment, suppository, infusion; topically by lotion or ointment; and rectally by suppositories. Oral administration is preferred. The phrases “parenteral administration” and “administered parenterally” as used herein means modes of administration other than enteral and topical administration, usually by injection, and includes, without limitation, intravenous, intramuscular, intraarterial, intrathecal, intracapsular, intraorbital, intracardiac, intradermal, intraperitoneal, transtracheal, subcutaneous, subcuticular, intraarticular, subcapsular, subarachnoid, intraspinal and intrastemal injection, and infusion. The phrases “systemic administration,” “administered systemically,” “peripheral administration” and “administered peripherally” as used herein mean the administration of a ligand, drug, or other material other than directly into the central nervous system, such that it enters the patient’s system and thus, is subject to metabolism and other like processes, for example, subcutaneous administration. These inhibitors(s) may be administered to humans and other animals for therapy by any suitable route of administration, including orally, nasally, as by, for example, a spray, rectally, intravaginally, parenterally, intracistemally, and topically, as by powders, ointments or drops, including buccally and sublingually.

Example 1: Assay to Determine Inhibitory Preference A biochemical assay that can be utilized to determine whether or not a molecule preferentially inhibits the CT-L activity of the constitutive (Β5) or immunoproteasome (L7) relies on first determining the EC50 for each subunit. This can be done using enzyme kinetic assays such as those disclosed in U.S. Application Serial No. 09/569748, Example 2 and Stein et al., Biochem. (1996), 35, 3899-3908 using isolated 20S proteasome preps with greater than 90% constitutive proteasome subunits or immunoproteasome subunits to determine. The inhibitory preference of the molecule is then based on the EC50 ratio of the chymotryptic-like activity of the constitutive proteasome (to that of the immunoproteasome (20S ratio). A ratio of less than one denotes the molecule inhibits the CT-L activity of the constitutive proteasome better than that of the immunoproteasome. Ratios greater than one signifies the molecule inhibits chymotryp sin-like activity of the immunoproteasome better than that of the constitutive proteasome. The greater the ratio number, the more specific the compound is for the immunoproteasome inhibitor.
