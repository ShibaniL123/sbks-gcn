Preparation of: rac-trans-1-(4-bromophenyl)-3-(4-(4-methoxyphenyl)piperidin-3-yl)urea (Example 6) and rac-trans-1-(1-acetyl-4-(4-methoxyphenyl)piperidin-3-yl)-3-(4-bromophenyl)urea (Example 22)
To a stirred solution of rac-trans-1-(3-amino-4-(4-methoxyphenyl)piperidin-1-yl)ethanone hydrochloride (0.27 g, 0.95 mmol, 1 eq) [synthesis described in the synthesis of Example 4] in DCM (15 mL) was added Et3N (0.2 mL, 1.42 mmol, 1.5 eq) followed by 4-bromophenylisocyanate (0.19 g, 0.95 mmol, 1 eq) at 0° C. and stirred for 2 h at RT. The reaction mixture was quenched with H2O and organics were extracted with DCM (2×20 mL), washed with brine (15 mL), dried over Na2SO4 and concentrated in vacuo. The crude product was purified by column chromatography (silica gel, 100:200 mesh, 70% EtOAc in hexane) to afford Example 22 (0.23 g, 55%) as white solid.
