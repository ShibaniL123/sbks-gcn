RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims the benefit of Indian Patent Application No. 1881/MUM/2013 filed on May 28, 2013 which is hereby incorporated by reference. FIELD OF INVENTION The present invention relates to S-DHS-fluoro-S-methylbutyryloxy) but-2-ynyl] 6ar,9a-difluoro-17 er-(furan-2-yl)carbonyloxy-11 /2-hydroxy-16 or-methyl-3-oxoandrosta-1,4-diene-17/2-carbothioate, a novel anti-inflammatory compound of the androstane series and methods of treating inflammatory conditions. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Corticosteroids (or glucocorticoids) having anti-inflammatory properties are widely used for the treatment of inflammatory conditions or disorders of skin, airways, eye, GI tract, joints, CNS etc, and several autoimmune disorders. Some of the inflammatory skin disorders where treatment with glucocorticoids is prescribed are eczema, psoriasis, allergic dermatitis, pruritis, hypersensitivity reactions etc. Inflammatory or allergic conditions of the airways for which glucocorticoids are used include disorders of nose, throat or lungs such as rhinitis (including hay fever), nasal polyps, asthma (including allergen-induced asthmatic reaction), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, interstitial lung disease, fibrosis, etc. Glucocorticoid administration is also used for inflammatory bowel disorders such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s diseases; and inflammatory joint disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis which are autoimmune diseases. However, administration of corticosteroids in general may cause, in addition to the desired pharmacological effect, several undesirable or adverse side effects at sites distant from the target tissue, the so-called systemic effects. The long term use of such corticosteroids is limited by the occurrence of serious undesired systemic effects including hypothalamic- pituitary- adrenal (ΗΡΑ) axis suppression, widespread immunosuppression, delayed wound healing, increased bone turnover, impaired growth, muscle weakness or atrophy, peptic ulceration, skin thinning, diabetes, obesity, hypertension, water retention, progesterone and estrogen related disorders. It is therefore desirable to have glucocorticoids which possess potent anti-inflammatory activity at the target tissue, with minimal or preferably no systemic activity at therapeutic doses when used for chronic treatment. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a novel glucocorticoid compound lS'-[4-(3-fluoro-3-methylbutyryloxy)but-2-ynyl]6a,9a-difluoro-17a-(furan-2-yl)carbonyloxy- 1 ly0-hydroxy-16a-methyl-3-oxoandrosta-l,4-diene-17/?-carbothioate of formula I The compound of formula I exhibits in in vivo models for inflammation, a superior safety index as compared to compounds disclosed in prior art.

As referred to herein it is indicative of any measure indicative of its effectiveness in relation to its safety. For example, it may be measured in terms of the ratio of the dose that results in an undesired effect to that which results in a desired effect. It is commonly measured by determining the ED50 value for a desired effect and the undesired effect and calculating the ratio of ED50, undesired effect to EDso, desired effect. For example, in Sephadex® lung edema model the safety index may be measured as the ratio ED50 Thymus involution/EDso Lung edema. The safety index may also be expressed as the ratio of the percent desired effect to percent undesired effect at a specific dose, for example in a cotton pellet granuloma test exemplified herein, the ratio of percent inhibition of granuloma to the percent decrease in weight of thymus at a specific dose is used. “Treating” a condition refers to taking steps to obtain beneficial or desired results, including clinical results. For purposes of this invention, beneficial or desired clinical results include, but are not limited to, alleviation or amelioration of one or more symptoms, delay or slowing of disease progression, stabilization of the disease state, and other beneficial results described below.

PROCESS OF PREPARATION: Another aspect of the invention is the process for the preparation of compound of formula I of the present invention. In one embodiment, the compound of the present invention is prepared in a single step from the thioic acid of formula IV, by alkylation with the alkyne moiety of formula V, as shown Scheme I. In the compound of formula V, L represents a leaving group (for e.g. a halogen atom, a mesyl or tosyl group, or the like), preferably L is chloro. The alkylation reaction can be advantageously carried out in an inert organic polar solvent, for example, acetone, acetonitrile, A/vV-dimethylformamide, Ν,Νdimethylacetamide, dimethyl sulfoxide, and the like, or mixtures thereof, preferably in acetone in presence of a suitable base. Examples of suitable bases are alkali or alkaline earth metal carbonates like potassium carbonate, sodium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate and the like, preferably potassium carbonate. The compound of formula IV can be prepared by following known methods, for example, Gordon J. Phillips et al., J. Med. Chem., 37, 3717-3729 (1994); US4335121; PCT publication No. WO 04/001369 or WO 04/039827. The compound of formula V may be prepared by methods known to those skilled in the art. In another embodiment, the compound of the present invention is prepared in a two-step process as shown in Scheme II Preparation of the compound of formula I comprise condensation of a compound of formula II with compound of formula VII in the presence of a condensating agent in an inert solvent, by methods known to those skilled in the art. Alternatively the compound of formula Vila, wherein X represents a halide, preferably chloro, can be used tp acylate the formula II, in the presence of a suitable base, to obtain the compound of formula I. Compound of formula II may be prepared by alkylation of compound of formula IV, with compound of formula VI, wherein L represents a leaving group (for e.g. a halogen atom, a mesyl or tosyl group, or the like), preferably L is tosyl. The alkylation reaction can be advantageously carried out in an inert organic polar solvent, for example, acetone, acetonitrile, V,jV-dimethylformamide, Ν,Νdimethylacetamide, dimethyl sulfoxide, and the like preferably in acetone in presence of a suitable base. Examples of suitable bases are alkali or alkaline earth metal carbonates like potassium carbonate, sodium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate and the like, preferably potassium carbonate. In yet another embodiment, the compound of the present invention is prepared in two steps from the compound of formula II shown in Scheme III The process for preparing a compound of formula I comprise reacting a compound of formula IX with a fluorinating reagent in a suitable solvent. Examples of fluorinating reagents include hydrofluoric acid (e.g. aqueous HF, HF-pyridine), sulfur tetrafluoride (SF4), dimethylaminosulfur trifluoride, diethylaminosulfur trifluoride (DAST), morpholinosulfur trifluoride, Selectfluor® and like. Preferably the fluorination is carried out using DAST in dichloromethane solvent. The compound of formula IX may be conveniently prepared by condensation of a compound of formula II with compound of formula VIII in the presence of an inert base and/or a suitable catalyst in an inert solvent, by methods known to those skilled in the art. Compound of the present invention undergoes highly efficient hydrolysis to metabolite of formula II, which has similar potency in in vitro glucocorticoid receptor binding assays. However, surprisingly the compound of formula II was significantly less potent than the compound of the present invention in the topical in vivo models for anti-inflammatory efficacy such as croton oil ear edema. Both the compound of the present invention and the compound of formula II, undergo hepatic metabolism to yield the inactive metabolite, a compound of formula III. This metabolite of formula III is several fold less potent than the compound of the present invention and the compound of formula II in in vitro glucocorticoid receptor binding assays (IC50 for formula I 2.3ηΜ vs 2% inhibition at 0.1 μΜ for formula III). formula II formula III The following non-limiting Examples illustrate the invention: A mixture of 6a,9a-difluoro-17a-(furan-2-yl)carbonyloxy-l l/?-hydroxy-16a-methyl-3-oxoandrosta-l,4-diene-17/?-carbothioic acid (5.0g, 9.87mmol), 4-chloro-l-(3-fluoro-3-methylbutyryloxy)-but-2-yne (2.24g, 10.85mmol) and anhydrous potassium carbonate (1.5g, 10.85mmol) in acetone (25ml) was stirred under a blanket of nitrogen at 25 to 30°C for 3hrs.

Example-7: Croton oil ear edema Mice (male, CD-I) were made into different groups. A method similar to one reported in the literature was used. Test compounds were dissolved in pyridine-water-acetone (4:2:14) solution 10μ1 of this solution of compound or vehicle solution was applied to the left ear of the mice. The right ear of each mouse was applied simultaneously with 10μ1 of pyridine: water: acetone (4:2:14) solution. After 2hrs of compound or vehicle application, 10μ1 of croton oil solution was applied to the left ear of all animals. After 6 hr of croton oil treatment the animals were sacrificed; ears were excised and weighed separately. Table-3: Croton oil ear edema screen Compound Inhibition of ear edema (%) Formula I 75.5 (1 pg) Fluticasone propionate 81.09 (1.6 pg) Dexamethasone 50.05 (1.6 pg) Compound of the present invention exhibited significant inhibition of ear edema at a lower dose. Example-8: Cotton pellet granuloma SD rats were used for assessing anti-inflammatory activity of test compound using cotton pellet granuloma method. Sterilized cotton pellets weighing 20mg were prepared. Test compounds were dissolved in acetone so as to get the required quantity for each cotton pellet in 500μ1. Different pellets were impregnated with 500μ1 of acetone to contain required quantity of test compounds and allowed to dry. Vehicle control pellets were impregnated with 500μ1 acetone. Rats were made into different groups. Two cotton pellets were surgically implanted into the scapular region of each rat. On sixth day of such implantation, pellets along with granuloma were taken out. Thymus gland was also separated from each animal and weighed. The pellets with granuloma were dried for 20 hrs at 60°C and weighed. Mean weights of dry granuloma and thymus, body weight gain/1 OOg body weights were calculated.

The safety index for the compound of the present invention, measured as the ratio of inhibition of granuloma to extent of thymus involution, was much superior when compared to marketed topical corticosteroids such as ciclesonide and fluticasone propionate. Example-9: Skin atrophy and systemic side effects in rats on topical application Male SD rats were lightly anesthetized with isoflurane. Bilaterally paired sites were marked on the back, one on each side of the flank. One of the sites was applied with an appropriate dose of compound of the present invention and fluticasone propionate dissolved in the acetone, daily for a period of 14 days. Contralateral site served as solvent treated controls and received acetone. Body weights were monitored on 0-14 days. On day 15, twenty-four hours after the last applications, blood was collected from the tail vein to determine total and differential blood cell count. The animals were euthanized and full-thickness skin from shaved area was punched to get 15 mm diameter plugs. The subcutaneous fat and muscle was removed and the punched plug was weighed. Thymus weights of each animal were also determined as a marker of systemic corticosteroid activity Table-5: Effect of 2-week dermal application of compound of formula I and fluticasone propionate on skin thickness, thymus weight, body weight gain and leukocyte counts in rats Treatment Dose (pg/site ) % Inhibition % Body Weight Gain Skin weight Thym us Total leukocyt Lymph ocytes Neutro phils Vehicle - - - 72.4 formula I 6 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 82.4 18 0.0 0.0 0.6 0.0 0.0 80.8 60 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 75.6 180 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.6 80.4 Fluticasone propionate 6 25.3 2.0 31.4 31.7 25.8 68.1 18 20.8 5.4 17.5 15.9 24.5 67.4 60 27.9 23.0 15.2 15.6 ' 14.5 61.9 180 30.0 55.0 32.7 34.1 24.6 42.5 Values of inhibition as compared to organ weights or cell counts in the vehicle treatment group. All values in compound of formula I treatment group were statistically nonsignificant compared to vehicle control groups When evaluated in above indicated animal models for local and systemic side effects upon dermal application, the compound of the present invention did not cause either skin atrophy or systemic immunosuppressive effect at doses upto 180 meg, unlike fluticasone propionate used as a reference corticosteroid. The change in weight in the thymi is a measure of systemic activity and thereby of toxicity. Lower the weight of the thymi, the greater the systemic toxicity. From the data provided in Table 5, upon 2-week of dermal application of compound of the present invention did not cause any inhibition of the thymus weight even at high doses, thereby indicating that the compounds of the present invention have much less systemic activity. Example -10: Sephadex®-induced lung edema in SD Rats Sephadex® G-200 was prepared in sterile saline (lOmg/ml) and allowed to swell for at least 3 days at room temperature. Test compounds were were administered intratracheally at 24hrs and 2hrs prior to intratracheal administration of Sephadex® (5 mg/kg) under light ether anesthesia. Vehicle control animals were administered vehicle instead of Sephadex®. At 24hr after Sephadex® instillation, lung and thymus were excised from individual animals and weighed. Wet weights of lungs and thymus were corrected for lOOg of initial body weight. The percentage increase in lung weight caused by Sephadex® and its inhibitions by the compounds, were calculated. The percentage inhibitions of thymus compared to vehicle control group were also calculated Table-6: Safety index for compounds in Sephadex® lung edema model in SD rats EDso Lung ED50 Safety index Compound edema Thymus ED50 Thymus inhibition involution involution/ (mg/kg, i.t.)

Also, in terms of systemic safety profile (thymus involution used as a marker), the compound of the present invention was surprisingly much superior to these reference drugs, thereby exhibiting a relatively high safety index (ratio of efficacy to side effect i.e. the separation of local anti-inflammatory activity from the systemic activity). The safety index of compound of the present invention was found to be several folds higher than that of fluticasone propionate. Example-11: Liver glycogen deposition in rats Male Sprague Dawley rats, weighing 190-220g were bilaterally adrenalectomized and maintained on 0.9% saline solution throughout the experiment. On day 5th and 6th of adrenalectomy, animals were made into different groups, test compounds prepared in cold saline (sonicated for 30min) were instilled intratracheally 2 doses @ 3mg/kg, 24hrs apart. At 15hrs after the last treatment, animals were sacrificed and livers were excised and weighed. The glycogen content of the livers was determined by anthrone method. Briefly, a weighed quantity of liver tissue was homogenized with 5% trichloroacetic acid, supernatant mixed with ethanol and kept overnight for precipitation. The glycogen thus extracted was estimated as glucose generated after acid hydrolysis by addition of anthrone reagent at 620nm. Glycogen content was expressed as mg/lOOg liver.

The hepatic glycogen deposition, which is a measure of the metabolic systemic side effect of glucocorticoids, was extremely insignificant for the compound of the present invention when compared with that for reference corticosteroids such as budesonide, ciclesonide and fluticasone propionate. This clearly demonstrates the minimal systemic toxicity and the potent anti-inflammatory activity of the compound of the present invention. Example-12: Inhibition of ovalbumin-induced nasal vascular permeability in guinea pigs Allergic rhinitis was induced by sensitization with intraperitoneal injection of ovalbumin (100 pg/0.5 ml/animal) suspended in aluminum hydroxide gel every week for 4 weeks, followed by topical instillation of 60 mg/ml, 20 pl/nostril ovalbumin solution. In successfully sensitized animals, 40 μ1 of compound of formula I (0.0714%), ciclesonide (0.0714%), and placebo were instilled into both nostrils of respective group and eight hr after animals were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium (50 mg/kg, i.p.). The esophagus was ligated and the oral cavity was sealed with a bioadhesive. Tracheotomy was performed for spontaneous breathing and the nasopharynx was catheterized connected to the perfusion pump set to deliver a rate of 0.25 ml/min. Evans blue dye (3% w/v, 1 ml/kg) was administered intravenously. The nasal cavity was perfused with ovalbumin (1%) for a period of 10 min, and saline for a period of 50 min. The perfusate was collected for 60 min. Supernatant of the perfusate was estimated for dye content spectrophotometrically at 620 nm. Extravasation of intravenously administered Evans blue dye was monitored as a marker of vascular permeability. The total amount of dye leakage into the nasal cavity over the 60 min time duration was calculated. Intranasal administration of compound of formula I nasal formulation at 28.56 pg/nostril dose, 8 hr prior to ovalbumin-challenge reduced the ovalbumin-induced dye leakage. The reference formulation ciclesonide also caused inhibition of dye leakage similar to compound of formula I nasal formulation. These results are presented in Figure-1. Example-13: Inhibition of ovalbumin-induced increase in intranasal pressure in guinea pigs Animals sensitized with ovalbumin as described above were used for experiments determining intranasal pressure. Intranasal instillation of compound of formula I, fluticasone propionate or placebo was done 24 hr and 2 hr prior to challenge with ovalbumin. The nasopharynx was catheterized with a PE cannula, one end of which was attached to pressure transducer and other to the nebulizer. Ovalbumin (5%) was nebulized into the nasal cavity for 10 min. The changes in intranasal pressure were recorded for following 45 min and differential pressure (dP) was calculated. Compound of formula I and fluticasone propionate caused equivalent inhibition of intranasal pressure as shown in Figure-2. Therefore, in above indicated in vivo models for allergic inflammation of upper respiratory tract, such as ovalbumin- induced vascular permeability and ovalbumin-induced increase in intranasal pressure in sensitized guinea pigs, the compound of the present invention was found to have efficacy comparable to that of marketed topical corticosteroids such as ciclesonide and fluticasone propionate. Example-14: Efficacy in allergen-induced conjunctivitis in guinea pigs Guinea pigs were sensitized by intraperitoneal ovalbumin (100 pg/animal, aluminum hydroxide as an adjuvant) were used in these experiments. Two doses of compound of formula I, loteprednol etabonate, prednisolone acetate or placebo were instilled into the right eye of different guinea pigs at 3 hr intervals. Two hrs after the second instillation of steroid formulations, Evans blue dye (0.5%, 4 ml/kg, i.v.) was administered through jugular vein and immediately thereafter the eye was challenged with ovalbumin and eyelids were removed, dye was extracted using a 5 ml solution of acetone and sodium sulfate and was quantified spectrophotometrically at 620 nm (results are represented in Figure-3- Effect on ovalbumin-induced conjunctival vascular permeability in guinea pigs). In above indicated animal model for ocular allergic inflammation viz. allergen-induced conjunctivitis in guinea pigs, the compound of the present invention showed efficacy comparable to the reference ophthalmic corticosteroids viz. lotepredol etabonate and prednisolone. Example-15: Effect on Intraocular Pressure (IOP) in Rabbits Ophthalmic instillation of 40 μ1 of compound of formula I, loteprednol etabonate, dexamethasone sodium phosphate, and placebo were undertaken in different group of animals, 10 instillations daily at an interval of 1 hour for 10 days. IOP measurement was performed 1 hr after instillation of the last dose (results are represented in Figure-4- Effect of ophthalmic steroids on IOP in rabbits). In the case of the compound of the present invention as per above study, the intraocular pressure (IOP), a side effect for potent ophthalmic corticosteroids, was insignificant (comparable to placebo) when compared with reference corticosteroids dexamethasone and prednisolone. Further, when administered by intranasal route in allergen sensitized animals, the allergen-induced increase in intranasal pressure, an indicator of intranasal resistance, is inhibited by compound of the present invention. Example-16: Efficacy and Safety by Intranasal administration The present study was conducted to determine the efficacy and safety of the compound of the present invention via intranasal route in Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis model. This was a single-centered, randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled parallel group study. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to assess the efficacy and safety of the compound of the present invention via intranasal route compared to placebo in alleviating the signs and symptoms of Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis in Environmental Exposure Chamber Model (EEC) after 2 weeks of treatment. METHODS: In this study, male and female patients aged 18- 65 years with history of seasonal allergic rhinitis and positive skin prick test to Dactylis glomerate within 12 months prior to screening and with TNSS score of >6 at least once during the 2 hour-screening EEC were included. Total 159 patients were included in the study and total 154 patients were considered for efficacy analysis. 39 patients received 200 pg (100 pg BID), 37 patients received 400 pg (200 pg BID), 39 patients received 800 pg (400 pg BID) of the compound of the present invention via nasal route and 39 patients received vehicle as placebo. Primary efficacy endpoint was change in TNSS (Total Nasal Symptom Score) in a 4-hour environmental challenge with Dactylis glomerate pollen in an EEC from baseline to Day 15/16. The TNSS was calculated as summation of 4 point severity scale (0=Νοη℮, l=Mild, 2=Moderate and 3=Severe) for each symptom (Nasal congestion, Rhinorrhea, Nasal itching and Sneezing). Secondary efficacy endpoint was change in TNSS subscales and change in the amount of nasal secretion in a 4-hour environmental challenge in an EEC from baseline to Day 15/16. Safety endpoint was incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events. The results showed that there was no significant difference in the safety profile of the compound of the present invention and the Placebo. All the doses of the compound of the present invention were statistically superior to the placebo for all primary and secondary efficacy endpoints and that the compound of the present invention was safe and effective for the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis. 1.
