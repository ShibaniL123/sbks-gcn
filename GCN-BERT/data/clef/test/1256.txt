BACKGROUND This invention generally relates to a dispersant copolymer useful to improve the performance of detergent compositions, especially those having high surfactant levels. Polymers made from hydrophilic and hydrophobic acrylic monomers are known and used for various purposes. For example, U.S. Pub. No. 2011/0152428 discloses a polymer comprising polymerized residues of methacrylic acid, methoxypolyethylene glycol methacrylate and stearyl methacrylate as a dispersant for inorganic pigments. However, the prior art does not disclose a polymer according to the present invention which gives superior results as a laundry detergent additive. The problem solved by the present invention is to provide a dispersant copolymer for use in improved detergent compositions. STATEMENT OF THE INVENTION The present invention is directed to a polymeric dispersant comprising: (a) from 50 to 95 wt % polymerized residues of monomer (A): wherein R1 is hydrogen, methyl, ethyl or COOX; R2 is hydrogen, methyl or ethyl; R3 is hydrogen, methyl or ethyl; and X is hydrogen, sodium, potassium, ammonium or a combination thereof; (b) from 1 to 20 wt % polymerized residues of monomer (B): wherein R4, R5, and R6 are independently hydrogen, methyl or ethyl; R7 is C6-C30 alkyl or C8-C30 aralkyl; and (c) from 3 to 30 wt % polymerized residues of monomer (C): wherein R8, R9, and R10 are independently hydrogen, methyl or ethyl; R11 and R12 are independently hydrogen, C1-C8 alkyl or hydroxymethyl; and n is an integer from 1 to 3. The present invention is further directed to a method for making the polymeric dispersant comprising combining a monomer of structure A and monomer of structure B in a solvent mixture composed of a mixture of an organic polyol and water, wherein the organic polyol has formula (I): wherein R13 and R14 independently are hydrogen, C1-C8 alkyl or hydroxymethyl; and n is an integer from 1 to 3. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION All percentages are weight percentages (wt %) and all fractions are by weight, unless otherwise indicated and all temperatures are in ° C., unless otherwise indicated. Measurements made at “room temperature” (room temp.) were made at 20-25° C. Weight average molecular weights, Mw, and number average molecular weights, Mn, are measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) using polyacrylic acid standards, as is known in the art. The techniques of GPC are discussed in detail in Modern Size Exclusion Chromatography, W. W. Yau, J. J. Kirkland, D. D. Bly; Wiley-Interscience, 1979, and in A Guide to Materials Characterization and Chemical Analysis, J. P. Sibilia; VCH, 1988, p. 81-84. The molecular weights reported herein are in units of daltons. As used herein the term “(meth)acrylic” refers to acrylic or methacrylic. Alkyl groups are saturated hydrocarbyl groups which may be straight or branched.

EXAMPLES Method of NMR Determination of HPA Content Approximately 300 mg of the dried dialyzed polymer was dissolved in 700 μL of DMSO-d6, and the resulting solution was transferred to a 5 mm NMR tube. NMR spectra were obtained using a Bruker AVANCE300 spectrometer. The quantitative 13C spectra were acquired with the zgig30 pulse sequence using a recycle delay of 8 seconds. For stearyl methacrylate the methyl and methylene resonances at 14 and 22 ppm were integrated. For hydroxypropyl acrylate (1° OH) the methine and methylene resonances at 71 and 64 ppm were integrated; for hydroxypropyl acrylate (2° OH) the methylene and methine resonances at 69 and 65 ppm were integrated. For acrylic acid the carbonyl resonances between 170-180 ppm were integrated, and the contribution from SMA and HPA were subtracted; for the lactone end-group formed by propylene glycol acting as a chain transfer agent, the quaternary resonance at 84 ppm in integrated. Method of Dialysis Dialysis was performed using a stirred 200 mL ultrafiltration cell from Amicon, equipped with a Millipore 500 g/mol cut-off membrane. Deionized water was added to the cell and with stiffing, ˜10 g of polymer solution was added. When polymer was thoroughly mixed, the cell was closed, stiffing maintained and nitrogen gas applied directly to the cell to a maximum pressure of 70 psi. After the cell contents were concentrated to 50 mL, the pressure was released and the cell was refilled with deionized water and concentrated again. This was then repeated once more and the dialyzate finally concentrated to about 25 mL. The dialyzate was then freeze-dried to yield a solid material.

A detergent base formulation was prepared as detailed above and diluted to 0.5 g/L of the formulation shown above. The Tergotometer experiments were done at ambient temperature (22° C.). The water hardness was set to 300 ppm. (Local tap water has ˜80 ppm so the experimenters added 2.2 g of a 2:1 Ca/Mg 100,000 ppm stock solution to 1 L water). The wash time on the Tergotometer was 12 min, followed by a 3 min rinse. There were 5 repeat cycles. We added 2.5 g Big Oak Clay slurry (25%) and 2.5 g of dust sebum (purchased from Scientific Services and comprising a dispersion of Spangler sebum and carbon black/vaccum cleaner dust) as the combination oily/particulate soils. The Tergotometer agitation speed was set at 90 rpm. There were 8 clean stripped cloths added to the wash (2 cotton cloths, 2 cotton interlock cloths, 2 polyester/cotton (65:35, polyester:cotton) cloths and 2 polyester cloths). The cloths were washed, and then tumble-dried. After drying the cloths were read for whiteness index on a Hunter colorimeter along with untreated swatches (pristine). The experiments assessed the effect of 1 wt % active polymer (based on detergent weight) on the whiteness of cloths of different types in the presence of particulate soil.

The remainder of the hole was filled with deionized water. The sample containing pAA was hazy and separated immediately into two phases. The sample containing the inventive copolymer was clear and single-phase for at least 12 weeks at ambient temperature, 5° C. and 40° C. This result shows that polymer made according to this invention has greater compatibility in high-surfactant detergent formulations than does acrylic acid homopolymer. 1.
