[0025] An adjustable basketball device D1 according to an embodiment of the present invention is illustrated in Figures 1 and 2. The device D1 includes a support 100, a backboard 200 coupled to the support 100, a mounting structure 300 coupled to the backboard 200, an adjustment mechanism 400 (described in detail below) movably coupled to the mounting structure 300, and an adjustable rim 500 supported by the mounting structure 300 and engaged with the adjustment mechanism 400. [00261 The support 100 includes a base 102 and a post 104 extending upwardly therefrom. The base 102 includes a bottom surface 106 configured for engaging a support surface S and a top surface 108. The post 104 includes an end portion 110 coupled to the top surface 108 of the base 102 and an opposite end portion 112 coupled to the backboard 200. In one embodiment, the post 104 includes two or more sections movably coupled together to allow for adjustment of the height of the backboard 200 relative to the base 102. For example, the post 104 may include two or more telescopically connected sections that extend and retract relative to each other to allow for height adjustment. [00271 Referring to Figures 3 and 4 the mounting structure 300 includes a body 302 having a central portion 304, and opposing end portions 306, 308. A guide or receiving portion 310 is CA 02724965 2010-12-10 coupled to end portion 306 and defines an opening 312. Another guide or receiving portion 314 is coupled to end portion 308 and defines another opening 316. In one embodiment, receiving portion 310 is pivotally coupled to the end portion 306 of the body 302, and rotatable about an axis A1 so that the opening 312 is movable toward along an arcuate path toward and away from the plane on which the backboard 200 lies. Similarly, receiving portion 314 may be pivotally mounted to the end portion 308 of the body 302, and rotatable about an axis A2 and along an arcuate path toward and away from the plane on which the backboard 200 lies. [0028] Referring to Figures 4, 5 and 6, the adjustable rim 500 includes a body portion 502, and opposing end portions 504, 506. End portion 504 is received in opening 312 of receiving portion 310 and extends inwardly toward the central portion 304 of the body 302. End portion 506 is received in opening 316 of receiving portion 314 and also extends inwardly toward the central portion 304. The rim 500 defines an opening 508 through which an object may pass, such as a basketball B (shown in Figure 1). A net 509 is coupled to the body portion 502 of the rim 500. Distal sections of the end portions 504, 506 engage the adjustment mechanism 400 and are movable relative thereto. The rim 500 is adjustable between a first configuration C1 in which the body portion 502 of the rim 500 defines an opening 508a with a first diameter L1, shown in Figure 5, and a second configuration C2 in which the opening 508b of the body portion 502 of the rim 500 has a second diameter L2 different than the first diameter L1, shown in Figure 6. 100291 The adjustment mechanism 400 is coupled to the mounting structure 300, and configured to move the end portions 504, 506 of the rim 500 relative to the mounting structure 300 to change the diameter of the opening 508 of the body 502 of the rim 500, for example between opening 508a with diameter L1 and opening 508b with diameter L2. CA 02724965 2010-12-10 [00301 Referring to Figures 7 and 8, the adjustment mechanism 400 includes an actuator 402 disposed within a cavity 318 defined by the body 302 of the mounting structure 300. The actuator 402 may be connected to and axially aligned with an axle 404. The axle 404 is rotatably mounted to the body 302 of the mounting structure 300, so that the actuator 402 is rotatable relative to the body 302. [00311 The actuator 402 includes an engagement surface 406 disposed between and engaging end portion 504 and end portion 506 of the ñm 500. In one embodiment, the actuator 402 includes a substantially cylindrical body 408. The engagement surface 406 extends around the body 408 and includes a plurality of outwardly extending projections 410. The end portion 504 of the ñm 500 includes a plurality of projections 510 extending outwardly from a surface 512 of the end portion 504 adjacent and facing the actuator 402. Similarly, the end portion 506 of the rim 500 includes a plurality of projections 514 extending outwardly from a surface 516 of the end portion 506 adjacent and facing the actuator 402. [00321 At least one of the projections 410 of the engagement surface 406 of the actuator 402 is received between and intermeshes with correspondingly aligned projections 510 on the end portion 504 of the fire 500, while another one of the projections 410 of the engagement surface 406 is received between and intermeshes with correspondingly aligned projections 514 on the end portion 506 of the rim 500. Alternatively, two projections 410 of the engagement surface 406 intermesh with a correspondingly aligned one of the projections 510 on the end portion 504, while another two projections 410 of the engagement surface 406 intermesh with another correspondingly aligned one of the projections 514 on the end portion 506 of the rim 500. [00331 Thus, one or more of the projections 410 of the engagement surface 406 engage one or more correspondingly aligned projections 510 of the end portion 504 while another one or more projections 410 of the engagement surface 406 engage one or more correspondingly CA 02724965 2010-12-10 aligned projections 514 of the end portion 506 during adjustment of the diameter of the opening 508 of the body 502 of the rim 500. [0034] Referring to Figures 4 and 7, upon rotation of the actuator 402 about an axis A3 and in a direction R1, the first end portion 504 moves relative to the mounting structure 300 in a direction D1, and the second end portion 506 moves relative to the mounting structure 300 in a direction D2. In one embodiment, direction D 1 is opposite direction D2. Upon rotation of the actuator 402 about axis A3 in a direction R2 opposite direction R1, the first end portion 504 moves relative to the mounting structure 300 in direction D2, and the second end portion 506 moves relative to the mounting structure 300 in direction D 1. [00351 In one embodiment, the axis of rotation A3 of the actuator 402 is substantially aligned with and/or parallel to a longitudinal axis of the post 104 of the support 100. Alternatively or in addition, the axis of rotation A3 may be substantially parallel to the axis of rotation A1 of the receiving portion 310 and/or the axis of rotation A2 of the receiving portion 314. [0036] Rotation of the actuator 402 about axis A3 in direction R1 causes a distal end 504a of end portion 504 and a distal end 506a of end portion 506 to simultaneously move away from the actuator 402. In this way, rotation of the actuator 402 about axis A3 in direction R1 causes the diameter of the opening 508 of the body 502 of the rim 500 to decrease. Conversely, rotation of the actuator 402 about axis A3 in direction R2 causes the distal end 504a of end portion 504 and the distal end 506a of end portion 506 to simultaneously move toward the actuator 402, thereby causing the diameter of the opening 508 of the body 502 of the rim 500 to increase. [00371 In one embodiment, the mounting structure 300 includes guide walls 320, 322 disposed within the cavity 318 of the body 302 and configured to maintain the end portions 504, 506 of the rim 500 against the actuator 402, so that the projections 410 of the CA 02724965 2010-12-10 engagement surface 406 are maintained in engagement with the projections 510 of end portion 504 as well as with projections 514 of end portion 506. Additional guide surfaces may be provided within the cavity 318 of the body 302. Further, one or more guide surfaces 324 may be disposed within a cavity 326 defined by the receiving portion 310, and/or one or more guide surfaces 328 may be disposed within a cavity 330 defined by the receiving portion 314. [0038] In one embodiment, a retaining ring 412 is coupled to an end 414 of the axle 404, as shown in Figure 7. The retaining ring 412 has a diameter L3, which is greater than a spacing distance L4 of aligned sections of the end portions 504, 506 adjacent the actuator 402. The retaining ring 412 ensures that the end portions 504, 506 do not slide downwardly and/or away from the actuator 402. In this way, the projections 510 of end portion 504 and the projections 514 of end portion 506 remain in meshed engagement with the projections 410 of the engagement surface 406. Further, the guide walls 320, 322 and guide surfaces 324, 328 ensure that the end portions 504, 506 of the ñm 500 are maintained in a controlled position and in engagement with the actuator 402. [0039] Referring again to Figures 3, 5 and 6, the adjustment mechanism 400 may include a knob 416 rotatably supported by an exteñor surface 332 of the mounting structure 300. The knob 416 is coupled to the actuator 402, for example via the axle 404, so that rotation of the knob 416 in a selected direction R1 or R2 causes rotation of the actuator 402 in a corresponding direction R1 or R2. The knob 416 extends outwardly from the exterior surface 332 of the mounting structure 300, and may include a gripping area configured to be gripped by a user. For example, the knob 416 may include a plurality of circumferentially spaced and outwardly extending knurls easily gñppable by the user. [0040] An adjustable basketball device D2 according to another embodiment of the present invention is illustrated in Figures 9-and 10. The device D2 includes a support 600, a CA 02724965 2010-12-10 -I0backboard 700 coupled to the support 600, a mounting structure 800 coupled to the backboard 700, an adjustment mechanism coupled to the mounting structure 800, and an adjustable rim 1000 supported by the mounting structure 800 and engaged with the adjustment mechanism. [0041] The support 600 includes a base 602 and a post 604 coupled thereto and extending upwardly therefrom. The post 604 may include two or more sections movably coupled together to allow for adjustment of the height of the backboard 700 relative to the base 602, such as described above. [00421 The backboard 700 may include a central portion 702 having opposing sides 704, 706. A side section 708 is pivotally coupled to side 704, and another side section 710 is pivotally coupled to side 706. Side section 708 includes a planar front surface 712 and side section 710 includes a planar front surface 714. Front surfaces 712, 714 of side sections 708, 710 are movable between a position P 1 substantially coplanar with a front surface 716 of central portion 702 (shown in Figure 9), and another position P2 angularly disposed relative to front surface 716 (shown in Figure 10). The angled or inwardly disposed position P2 of side sections 708, 710 increases the likelihood that a ball is deflected inwardly and toward the rim 1000, thereby increasing the ease of 'making a basket,' thereby enhancing enjoyment for younger players. [00431 Referring to Figure 11, the mounting structure 800 includes a side portion 802 defining an opening 804. The adjustable rim 1000 includes a body portion 1002 and a distal end (not shown) received within the opening 804. The body portion 1002 defines an opening 1003 through which a ball or other toy may pass. The body portion 1002 also includes a plurality of apertures 1004. A section of the body portion 1002 is inserted into the opening 804 so that one of the apertures 1004 is aligned with and engaged by the adjustment mechanism. The adjustment mechanism may include a rotatable actuator having an CA 02724965 2010-12-10 -IIengagement surface, such as one or more projections as described above, which are received in an aligned with one of the apertures 1004. For example, as the actuator rotates about an axis A4 in direction R3, the projections on the actuator engage the apertures 1004, drawing the body portion 1002 of the rim 1000 inwardly, thereby decreasing the diameter of the opening 1003. As the actuator rotates about the axis A4 in an opposite direction R4, the projections on the actuator engage the apertures 1004, and push the body portion 1002 of the rim 1000 outwardly, thereby increasing the diameter of the opening 1003. 100441 Thus, similar to device DI, the adjustment mechanism of device D2 is configured to move an end of the rim 1000 relative to the mounting structure 800 to change the diameter of the opening 1003 of the body portion 1002 of the ñm 1000. The axis of rotation A4 of the actuator is substantially perpendicular to a longitudinal axis of the post 604 of the support 600. 10045] The adjustment mechanism may include a knob 900 rotatably supported by an exteriorly disposed surface of the mounting structure 800, so that rotation of the knob 900 in a selected direction R3 or R4 causes rotation of the actuator in a corresponding direction, thereby increasing or decreasing the diameter of the opening 1003.
