Example 5
Acetal 1c:
A 2-dram vial with a PTFE-lined cap was charged with alcohol 8c (50.1 mg, 0.298 mmol) and benzoate S1 (112 mg, 0.385 mmol). These were dissolved in DCE (1.00 mL), and TFA (2.2 μL, 0.0297 mmol) was added. The resulting mixture was heated to 80° C. and stirred for 16 h. After cooling to room temperature, K2CO3 (82.7 mg, 0.599 mmol) and MeOH (1.00 mL) were added, and the resulting mixture was stirred at 23° C. for 24 h. The mixture was then filtered through a short pad of silica gel, eluting with EtOAc (30 mL), and the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by flash column chromatography (2:1 hexanes/EtOAc eluent) to afford acetal 1c (86.9 mg, 86% yield, Rf=0.30 in 2:1 hexanes/EtOAc) as a colorless oil.
