(8) Preparation of tert-butyl 6-((2R,5R)-6-(benzyloxy)-7-oxo-1,6-diazabicyclo[3.2.1]octane-2-carboxamido)-2-azaspiro[3.3]hept ane-2-carboxylate
(2R,5R)-6-(benzyloxy)-7-oxo-1,6-diazabicyclo[3.2.1]octane-2-carboxylic acid (0.12 g, 0.43 mmol), tert-butyl 6-amino-2-azaspiro[3.3]heptane-2-carboxylate (92 mg, 0.43 mmol), triethylamine (96 mg, 0.95 mmol), HOBT (87 mg, 0.64 mmol), EDCI (165 mg, 0.86 mmol) were serially added to DCM (20 mL), reacted at 25Â°C for 3 h; the reaction solution was concentrated after completion of the reaction, and the residue was purified with silica gel column chromatography (petroleum ether : ethyl acetate = 1:1) to obtain the product (0.15 g, yield was 73.4%).
