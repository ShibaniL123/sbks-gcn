TECHNICAL FIELD The present disclosure generally relates to medical monitoring systems and methods of using the same. In particular, the disclosure is directed to medical monitoring systems and methods using the same for determination and measurement of pain. BACKGROUND Medical monitoring devices are routinely used in various medical settings to obtain or measure physiological parameters relating to a patient's medical condition. Pain is one of the most important, yet difficult, constructs to measure in clinical practice and research. By definition, pain is subjective and relies on the patient's self-report; measures of pain estimated by proxies, particularly health-care providers, invariably underestimate pain. SUMMARY The following embodiments and aspects thereof are described and illustrated in conjunction with systems, tools and methods which are meant to be exemplary and illustrative, not limiting in scope. In various embodiments, one or more of the above-described problems have been reduced or eliminated, while other embodiments are directed to other advantages or improvements. According to some embodiments, there are provided methods and systems for measurement and/or management of pain of a subject in various health related conditions under various settings. According to some embodiments, the methods and systems provided herein may be used for the measurement and/or assessment of pain of a subject and may optionally further provide pain management by controlling titration of sedation of the treated subject so as to reduce pain levels. In some embodiments, the methods provided herein take use of measurements or related information obtained from one or more medical monitoring devices. In some embodiments, the medical monitoring devices may be selected from, but not limited to: capnograph, pulse oximeter, and measurements of skin humidity or conductivity. In some embodiments, the measurements or related information obtained from the medical monitoring devices are various physiological, parameters, such as, for example, but not limited to: breath related parameters (as determined, for example, based on CO2 measurements in exhaled breath), heart rate related parameters, blood related parameters, brain activity related parameters, skin related parameters (such as skin humidity, skin conductivity), body temperature, and the like, or combinations thereof.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION In the following description, various aspects of the disclosure will be described. For the purpose of explanation, specific configurations and details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the disclosure. However, it will also be apparent to one skilled in the art that the disclosure may be practiced without specific details being presented herein. Furthermore, well-known features may be omitted or simplified in order not to obscure the disclosure. As referred to herein, the terms “user”, “medical user”, “health care provider” and “health care professional” may interchangeably be used. The terms may include any health care provider who may treat and/or attend to a patient. A user may include, for example, a nurse, respiratory therapist, physician, anesthesiologist, and the like. In some cases, a user may also include a patient. As referred to herein, the terms “device”, “monitoring device” and “medical device” may interchangeably be used. Exemplary monitoring devices include such devices as, but not limited to: Capnograph, pulse oximeter, Electrocardiograph (ECG), skin humidity measuring device, thermometer, Brain electrical activity monitoring device (such as BIS), and the like. As referred to herein, the term “physiological parameter” is directed to a health related parameter of the subject. The health related parameter may be directly and/or indirectly measured, detected and/or derived from a measurement of a medical monitoring device, for example, via an appropriate sensor. In some embodiments, the health related parameter may include such parameters as, but not limited to: breath related parameters (such as, for example, CO2 related parameters, EtCO2, O2 related parameters, breath rate, breath cycle, respiration rate, and the like); heart related parameters (such as, pulse rate); blood related parameters (such as, blood pressure); temperature; skin related parameters (such as, skin humidity, skin conductance, skin capacitance, and the like); Brain related parameters (such as, brain activity); and the like; or combinations thereof. As referred to herein, the terms “patient” and subject” may interchangeably be used and may relate to a subject being monitored by any monitoring device for any physical-condition related parameter and/or health related parameter. In some embodiments, the subject is sedated or anaesthetized. In some embodiments, the subject is ventilated. In some embodiments, the subject is unconscious. As referred to herein, the term “waveform” is directed to a recurring graphic shape which may be realized by measuring a physiological parameter of a subject over time, such as, for example, concentration of CO2 in breath, rate of breathing, electrocardiogram (ECG), plethysmograph, and the like. In some embodiments, a waveform is a medically, time resolved waveform. A waveform may have various characteristic parameters/features/factors that may be derived from the shape, dimension, rate or frequency, reoccurrences, and the like, and combinations thereof. As referred to herein, the term “pattern(s)” relates to any identified/determined pattern over time, which is recurring known or known that may be produced when graphically displaying any of the waveforms or waveforms related factors/parameters. In some embodiments, a pattern may be predefined. In some embodiments, a pattern may be determined if it is clearly repeating itself for a given number of times over a given period of time. As referred to herein, the terms ordinary, normal, typical, standard and common may interchangeably be used. As referred to herein, the term “EtCO2” relates to End tidal CO2. The CO2 is exhaled out of the body and the concentration of the exhaled CO2, also known as end tidal CO2 (EtCO2) is an approximate estimation of the alveolar CO2 pressure and thus of the arterial levels of CO2. The values of EtCO2 may be measured in units of pressure, such as, for example, mmHg. As referred to herein, the term “breath cycle” includes the stages of exhalation and inhalation. The breath cycle may be derived from a CO2 waveform which depicts the change in expired CO2 Volume over time, (EtCO2). During a breath cycle, the levels of CO2 initially increase as a result of CO2 release from the airways, from what is known as the “dead space”, which is the space in which no gas exchange takes place. Then, the CO2 rapidly reaches a plateau at high levels of CO2, which corresponds to the release of CO2 from the lungs, in the exhalation phase. A rapid decline in exhaled CO2 proceeds the inhalation phase, characterized by absence/minute levels of CO2. As referred to herein, the term “Respiration Rate” (RR) may be defined as the number of breaths taken in a minute, and it may change under various physiological and medical conditions. As referred to herein, the terms “Heart Rate” (HR) and “pulse rate” may interchangeably be used and may relate to the number of heart pulses (beats) in a minute. Pulse rate is usually considered to be a combination of left ventricular stroke volume, ejection velocity, the relative compliance and capacity of the arterial system, and the pressure waves that result from the antegrade flow of blood and reflections of the arterial pressure pulse returning from the peripheral circulation, and some or all of which may be effected by CO2. In some embodiments, the terms “calculated” and “computed” may interchangeably be used. The terms “sedatives”, “sedative substances”, “sedative drugs”, “sedative agents”, “pain relieving substances” and “pain relieving drugs” may interchangeably be used. The terms are directed to substances or drugs that can reduce pain levels of a subject. In some embodiments, the sedatives may be administered by any administration route. In some embodiments, the administration of the sedative may be controlled by a pain management subunit. In some embodiments, the sedatives may be administered continuously or intermittently. In some embodiments, the amount (concentration) of the administered sedatives may be controlled based on pain levels of the subject. In some embodiments, the time period over which the sedatives are administered may be controlled based on pain levels of the subject. Capnography is a non-invasive monitoring method used to continuously measure CO2 concentration in exhaled breath. The CO2, which is a constant metabolism product of the cells, is exhaled out of the body, and the concentration of the exhaled CO2, also known as end tidal CO2 (EtCO2), is an approximate estimation of the arterial levels of CO2. Capnograph (or capnometer) is a medical monitoring device that may be used for measuring the carbon dioxide (CO2) content in inspired and expired air of a subject. It is a non-invasive device that measures the concentrations of respired gases. Pulse oximeter is a type of oximeter, which is a medical monitoring device that may be used to determine oxygen saturation of the blood. Pulse oximeter may indirectly be used to measure the oxygen (O2) saturation concentration and changes in blood volume in the skin (i.e., act as a photoplethysmograph). Pulse oximeter may also be used to measure the pulse rate of a subject. The term SpO2 relates to the saturation of peripheral oxygen. It is a measurement of the amount of oxygen attached to the hemoglobin in red blood cells in the circulatory system. SpO2 values are generally given as a percentage. SpO2 may be monitored and measured by a Pulse Oximeter. Skin humidity may be measured by various devices and means known in the art. The measurements provide an assessment as to the degree of humidity of the skin. The humidity may be may indirectly be determined according to changes in skin electrical conductivity (conductance) and/or electrical capacity (capacitance). In some embodiments, changes in skin humidity or conductance or capacitance are indicative of varying degrees of sweat (such as, for example, cold sweat) of the subject. According to some embodiments, there are provided methods and systems for measurement and/or management of pain of a subject in various health related conditions under various settings. According to some embodiments, the methods and systems provided herein may be used for the measurement and or assessment of pain of a subject and may optionally further provide pain management by controlling titration of sedation of the treated subject so as to reduce levels of pain.

In some embodiments, the system comprises a combination of at least two medical monitoring devices. In some embodiments, the system comprises a combination of at least three medical monitoring devices. In some embodiments, the medical monitoring devices may be selected from, but not limited to: a capnogrpah, a pulse oximeter, Brain activity monitor, a skin humidity and/or conductivity measurement device, or any combination thereof.

According to some embodiments, the additional parameters (in addition to expired CO2) may be skin humidity, skin conductance, skin capacitance, heart rate, SpO2, blood pressure, brain activity, data derived therefrom or related thereto, and the like, or any combinations thereof. In some embodiments, the measured parameters may be further manipulated and/or processed to generate data related to the measurements, prior to or concomitantly while being integrated by the processing unit. For example, in some embodiments, various CO2 related parameters may be derived from the measurement of expired CO2, such as, for example but not limited to: CO2 waveform and parameters related thereto (such as, for example, but not limited to: EtCO2, changes in EtCO2, a slope of the increase in the CO2 concentration, a change in a slope of the increase in the CO2 concentration, time to rise to a predetermined percentage of a maximum value of CO2 concentration, a change in time to rise to a predetermined percentage of a maximum value of CO2 concentration, an angle of rise to a predetermined percentage of a maximum value of CO2 concentration, a change in an angle of rise to a predetermined percentage of a maximum value of CO2 concentration, breath to breath correlation, a change in breath to breath correlation, a CO2 duty cycle, a change in CO2 duty cycle, minute ventilation, a change in minute ventilation or any combination thereof), respiration rate, breath cycle, CO2 concentration in expired air, and the like, or any combination thereof. For example, in some embodiments, various parameters (data) derived from pulse oximetry measurements may be obtained, such as, heart rate (pulse rate), amplitude of cardiac pulses (as determined based on the photoplethysmogram signal); modulation of the amplitude of cardiac pulses, percent modulation (PMod) of the signal, changes in the PMod, and the like, or combinations thereof. According to some embodiments, the system may further include a signaling unit. The signaling unit may be configured to issue an alert if the pain level of the subject increases over a predetermined threshold or over a period of time (that may be predetermined). The signaling unit may be associated (directly or indirectly) with and controlled by the processing unit. In some embodiments, the signaling unit may further control a pain medication (pain management) subunit, that may affect the amount (concentration and/or administration period) of sedative substances administered to the patient. In some embodiments, the signaling unit automatically controls the administration of sedative agents, based on the determined pain level and/or changes thereto. According to some embodiments, the measured physiological parameters may be determined or calculated over a period of time, in order to determine change in pain levels over time. The period of time may be predetermined. According to some embodiments, the pain level may be determined by various calculations and algorithms and may be assigned a value. In some embodiments, the pain level value may be calculated by various means, such as, for example, by use of mathematical equations, algorithms, formulas, and the like, that may take into consideration the values or derivatives of the values of the physiological parameters measured by the one or more monitoring devices.

In addition, the system may further include a user interface, such as, user interface 18 that may allow the health care provider to input patient related data and/or control any of the operating parameters of the system. The system may further include data storing subunits, capable of string According to some embodiments, there is provided a method for determining, assessing and optionally managing pain levels of a subject. In some embodiments, the method may include obtaining measurements of one or more physiological parameters of the subject, and determining, based on the measured parameters (or date obtained therefrom), the pain level of the subject or changes to the pain level. In some embodiments, the method may further include issuing an alert if the pain levels increase over a time period or over a predetermined threshold. In some embodiments, the method may further include managing pain level by controlling the level of sedatives administered to the subject. According to some embodiments, there is provided a method for measuring determining, assessing and optionally managing pain levels of a subject, the method may include obtaining measurements of two or more physiological parameters of the subject, and determining, based on the measured parameters (or date obtained therefrom), the pain level of the subject or changes to the pain level. In some embodiments, the method may include obtaining measurements of three or more physiological parameters of the subject. In some embodiments, the physiological parameters, or data derived therefrom, may include such parameters as, for example, but not limited to: breath related parameters (as determined, for example, based on expired CO2 (measurements of CO2 in exhaled breath), heart related parameters (such as heart rate), blood related parameters (such as, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, blood gases), brain activity related parameters (such as brain electrical activity), skin related parameters (such as skin humidity or skin conductivity), body temperature, and the like, or combinations thereof. In some embodiments, at least one of the physiological parameters is expired CO2. According to some embodiments, there is provided a method for measuring determining, assessing and optionally managing pain levels of a subject, the method may include obtaining measurements of expired CO2; and one or more additional physiological parameters of the subject; and determining, based on the measured parameters (or date obtained therefrom), the pain level of the subject or changes to the pain level. According to some embodiments, the additional parameters (in addition to expired CO2) may be skin humidity, heart rate, SpO2, blood pressure, brain activity, data derived therefrom, and the like. In some embodiments, the method may further include manipulation and/or processing of the measured parameters, to generate data related to the measurements, prior to or simultaneously while being integrated for determination of pain level. For example, in some embodiments, various CO2 related parameters may be derived from the measurement of CO2 in breath, such as, for example but not limited to: CO2 waveform and parameters related thereto (such as, for example, but not limited to: EtCO2, changes in EtCO2, a slope of the increase in the CO2 concentration, a change in a slope of the increase in the CO2 concentration, time to rise to a predetermined percentage of a maximum value of CO2 concentration, a change in time to rise to a predetermined percentage of a maximum value of CO2 concentration, an angle of rise to a predetermined percentage of a maximum value of CO2 concentration, a change in an angle of rise to a predetermined percentage of a maximum value of CO2 concentration, breath to breath correlation, a change in breath to breath correlation, a CO2 duty cycle, a change in CO2 duty cycle, minute ventilation, a change in minute ventilation or any combination thereof), respiration rate, breath cycle, CO2 concentration in expired air, and the like, or any combination thereof. Such parameters may be indicative of increase in pain. For example, increase in breath rate, changes in breath depth, changes in CO2 waveform, cessation of breath, may be indicative of increased pain. For example, in some embodiments, various parameters (data) derived from pulse oximetry measurements may be obtained, such as, heart rate (pulse rate), amplitude of cardiac pulses (as determined based on the photoplethysmograph signal (PPG)); modulation of the amplitude of cardiac pulses, percent modulation (PMod) of the signal, changes in the PMod, and the like, or combinations thereof. For example, rapid vasoconstriction is a known response to pain. Such vasoconstriction may be identifiable in a photoplethysmograph signal from a pulse oximeter device as a reduction in the amplitude of the pulsatile component. Reference is now made to FIG. 2, which depicts a graph of amplitude of cardiac pulses in a photoplethysmograph signal over time. As shown in FIG. 2, graph (50) shows the amplitude (AC) of cardiac pulses (52) over a period of time. At time point (54), a reduction in the amplitude of the cardiac pulses is observed, which is indicative of the presence of pain. As the amplitude of the cardiac pulses is further reducing over time (beyond time point 54), it is indicative that pain levels are increasing over time. According to some embodiments, the amplitude of the photoplethysmograph signal may be used as an indication to the pain level or changes thereto. According to some embodiments, the amplitude of the cardiac pulses may further be manipulated and may be divided by the baseline of the signal (i.e. DC level), to produce a normalized measure of pain. In some embodiments, the normalized measure of pain is the percent modulation (PMod) of the signal. According to some embodiments, the measured physiological parameters may be determined or calculated over a period of time, in order to determine change in pain levels over time. The period of time may be predetermined. According to some embodiments, the pain level may be determined by various calculations and algorithms and may be assigned a value. In some embodiments, the pain level value may be calculated by various means, such as, for example, by use of mathematical equations, algorithms, formulas, and the like, that may take into consideration the values or derivatives of the values of the physiological parameters measured by the one or more monitoring devices. According to some embodiments, learning and optimization of determination of pain level may be carried out using various methods, such as, for example, but not limited to: neural networks, a support vector machine (SVM), genetic algorithms, simulated annealing and expectation-maximization (EM), learning systems based on historic data, and the like.

For example, at step 100A, capnograph measurements are obtained, at step 100B, Skin humidity (skin conductance or skin capacitance) measurements are obtained, and at step 100C, photoplethysmograph (pulse oximetry) measurements are obtained. Each of steps 100A-C may be performed simultaneously, sequentially or independently of each other. Next, the obtained measurements may be further processed or analyzed to determine various related parameters. For example, at step 102A, expired CO2 related parameters are determined, based on the capnograph measurements. Exemplary CO2 related parameters include such parameters as, but not limited to: CO2 waveform and parameters related thereto (such as, for example, but not limited to: EtCO2, changes in EtCO2, a slope of the increase in the CO2 concentration, a change in a slope of the increase in the CO2 concentration, time to rise to a predetermined percentage of a maximum value of CO2 concentration, a change in time to rise to a predetermined percentage of a maximum value of CO2 concentration, an angle of rise to a predetermined percentage of a maximum value of CO2 concentration, a change in an angle of rise to a predetermined percentage of a maximum value of CO2 concentration, breath to breath correlation, a change in breath to breath correlation, a CO2 duty cycle, a change in CO2 duty cycle, minute ventilation, a change in minute ventilation or any combination thereof), respiration rate, breath cycle, CO2 concentration in expired air, and the like, or any combination thereof.

Exemplary heart related parameters may be such parameters as, but not limited to: heart rate, heart rate (pulse rate), amplitude of cardiac pulses; modulation of the amplitude of cardiac pulses, percent modulation (PMod) of the signal, and the like, and combinations thereof. Each of steps 102A-C may be performed simultaneously, sequentially or independently of each other. Next, at step 104, the various parameters that have been determined in steps 102A-C are integrated (for example, by a processing unit) to determine pain level and/or changes thereto. In some embodiments, the change in the pain level may be compared to a previous value of pain level (as determined over one or more previous cycles). In some embodiments, the change in the pain level is determined by comparing to a reference predetermined value of pain level. Further in step 104, if it is determined that pain level has not increased, a new cycle of measurements and determination of pain levels based thereupon proceeds. If it is determined at step 104 that pain level has increased (over a period of time or over a reference value), action is taken in step 106. The action taken in step 106 may include various actions. For example, at step 106, an alert may be issued. The alert may be any type of alert, such as, for example, an audible alert (such as an alarm sound), a visual alert (such as a flashing light), a tactile alert (such as vibration). The alert may indicate to the health care provider that increasing pain has been detected and that action may be taken. In addition to, or alternatively to the alert issued, an additional action may be to control sedative substances administered to the subject, for example, by automatically controlling a pain management subunit configured to control/provide sedatives to the subject. In some embodiments, the control of the sedative administered to the subject may be on the amount (concentration) of the sedative administered, length of time period over which the sedatives are administered, or both. According to some embodiments, the systems and methods disclosed herein provide for a non-invasive assessment of pain of a subject. According to some embodiments, the systems and methods disclosed herein provides for an automatic management of pain of a subject, by controlling a pain medication subunit that may determine the amount of sedative substances administered to the patient. It is understood by the skilled in the art that the processor of the system is configured to implement the method as essentially described herein. In the description and claims of the application, each of the words “comprise” “include” and “have”, and forms thereof, are not necessarily limited to members in a list with which the words may be associated. While a number of exemplary aspects and embodiments have been discussed above, those of skill in the art will recognize certain modifications, permutations, additions and sub-combinations thereof. It is therefore intended that the following appended claims and claims hereafter introduced be interpreted to include all such modifications, permutations, additions and sub-combinations as are within their true spirit and scope. EXAMPLES Example 1 Assessment of Pain Level Based on Measured Physiological Parameters Change in Pain levels of a test subject are determined based on measurements of the following physiological parameter: expired CO2 (as determined by capnograph measurements), heart rate (as determined by pulse oximetry measurements) and skin humidity (as determined by measurement of skin capacitance). The subject is continuously being monitored by a capnograph, a pulse oximeter, and skin capacitance sensor. When pain levels of the subject increases, a pattern of rapid breathing is identified based on changes to the CO2 waveform and frequency of the breath cycles, as identified based on the capnography signal. Additionally, increase in heart rate and reduction in PMod (calculated by dividing the amplitude of the cardiac pulses (obtained based on the photoplethysmograph signal) by the baseline of the signal), are observed. Further, increase in skin humidity is detected (based on increase in skin capacitance). The integrated, combined analysis of the identified changes in the measured parameters and the data derived therefrom, provide a reliable, robust and accurate indication of an increase in the pain level of the subject, and allow the accurate monitoring the pain levels.
