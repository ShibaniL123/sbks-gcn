FIELD Genetically modified mice that comprise a mouse or human lambda variable (Vλ) light chain sequence operably linked with a mouse or human light chain constant region (λ or kappa(κ)). Genetically modified mice that express epitope-binding proteins that comprise an immunoglobulin light chain comprising a variable domain derived from a human lambda variable (hVλ) gene segment, a human lambda J (hJλ) gene segment, and a mouse light chain constant (CL) domain. Genetically modified mice, comprising an unrearranged immunoglobulin lambda (λ) light chain variable nucleic acid sequence at an endogenous mouse light chain locus. Mice capable of rearranging and expressing a chimeric human λ/mouse CL light chain from an endogenous light chain locus that comprises a replacement of all endogenous mouse light chain variable region gene segments with one or more hVλ gene segments and one or more hJλ gene segments. Somatically mutated antibodies comprising hVλ domains and mouse CL domains. BACKGROUND Mice that express antibodies that are fully human, or partly human and partly mouse, are known in the art. For example, transgenic mice that express fully human antibodies from transgenes containing human light and heavy chain immunoglobulin variable region genes have been reported. Genetically modified mice that comprise a replacement of the endogenous mouse heavy chain variable region (HCVR) gene segments and kappa (κ) light chain variable region (LCVR) gene segments with human HCVR and LCVR gene segments and that make chimeric antibodies with a chimeric human/mouse kappa chain are known as well. Antibody light chains are encoded by one of two separate loci: kappa (κ) and lambda (λ). Mouse antibody light chains are primarily of the κ type. The ratio of κ to λ light chain usage in humans is about 60:40, whereas in mice it is about 95:5. Biased usage of κ light chains in mice is reportedly sustained in genetically modified mice capable of expressing fully or partly human antibodies. Thus, mice that express fully or partly human antibodies appear to be constrained in lambda variable usage. There is a need in the art to generate lambda variable regions, whether mouse or human, for use in making epitope-binding proteins. There is a need in the art for mice that express fully or partly human antibodies, wherein the mice display an increased lambda variable (Vλ) usage. There is a need in the art for mice that express fully or partly human antibodies, wherein the mice display an increased λ variable (Vλ) usage.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION Although specific features of various embodiments are discussed in detail, the descriptions of the specific aspects, embodiments, and examples do not limit the subject matter of the claims; it is the claims that describe the scope of the invention. All terms and phrases used in this disclosure include the meanings normally ascribed to them in the art. The term “contiguous” includes reference to occurrence on the same nucleic acid molecule, e.g., two nucleic acid sequences are “contiguous” if they occur on the same nucleic molecule but are interrupted by another nucleic acid sequence. For example, a rearranged V(D)J sequence is “contiguous” with a constant region gene sequence, although the final codon of the V(D)J sequence is not followed immediately by the first codon of the constant region sequence. In another example, two V gene segment sequences are “contiguous” if they occur on the same genomic fragment, although they may be separated by sequence that does not encode a codon of the V region, e.g., they may be separated by a regulatory sequence, e.g., a promoter or other noncoding sequence. In one embodiment, a contiguous sequence includes a genomic fragment that contains genomic sequences arranged as found in a wild-type genome. The phrase “derived from” when used concerning a variable region “derived from” a cited gene or gene segment includes the ability to trace the sequence back to a particular unrearranged gene segment or gene segments that were rearranged to form a gene that expresses the variable domain (accounting for, where applicable, splice differences and somatic mutations). The phrase “functional” when used concerning a variable region gene segment or joining gene segment refers to usage in an expressed antibody repertoire; e.g., in humans Vλ gene segments 3-1, 4-3, 2-8, etc. are functional, whereas Vλ gene segments 3-2, 3-4, 2-5, etc. are nonfunctional. A “heavy chain locus” includes a location on a chromosome, e.g., a mouse chromosome, wherein in a wild-type mouse heavy chain variable (VH) , heavy chain diversity (DH), heavy chain joining (JH), and heavy chain constant (CH) region DNA sequences are found. A “κ locus” includes a location on a chromosome, e.g., a mouse chromosome, wherein in a wild-type mouse κ variable (Vκ), κ joining (Jκ), and κ constant (Cκ) region DNA sequences are found. A “λ locus” includes a location on a chromosome, e.g., a mouse chromosome, wherein in a wild-type mouse λ variable (Vλ), λ joining (Jλ), and λ constant (Cλ) region DNA sequences are found. The term “unrearranged” includes the state of an immunoglobulin locus wherein V gene segments and J gene segments (for heavy chains, D gene segments as well) are maintained separately but are capable of being joined to form a rearranged V(D)J gene that comprises a single V,(D),J of the V(D)J repertoire. Mice Expressing Human λ Variable Domains Mice that express antibodies that are fully human, or partly human and partly mouse, have previously been reported. VELOCIMMUNE® genetically engineered mice comprise a replacement of unrearranged V(D)J gene segments at endogenous mouse loci with human V(D)J gene segments. VELOCIMMUNE® mice express chimeric antibodies having human variable domains and mouse constant domains (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 7,605,237). Most other reports concern mice that express fully human antibodies from fully human transgenes in mice that have disabled endogenous immunoglobulin loci. Antibody light chains are encoded by one of two separate loci: kappa (κ) and lambda (λ). Mouse antibody light chains are primarily of the κ type. Mice that make mouse antibodies, and modified mice that make fully human or chimeric human-mouse antibodies, display a bias in light chain usage. Humans also exhibit light chain bias, but not so pronounced as in mice; the ratio of κ light chains to λ light chains in mice is about 95:5, whereas in humans the ratio is about 60:40. The more pronounced bias in mice is not thought to severely affect antibody diversity, because in mice the λ variable locus is not so diverse in the first instance. This is not so in humans. The human λ light chain locus is richly diverse. The human λ light chain locus extends over 1,000 kb and contains over 80 genes that encode variable (V) or joining (J) segments (FIG. 1). Within the human λ light chain locus, over half of all observed Vλ domains are encoded by the gene segments 1-40, 1-44, 2-8, 2-14, and 3-21. Overall, about 30 or so of the human Vλ gene segments are believed to be functional. There are seven Jλ gene segments, only four of which are regarded as generally functional Jλ gene segments—Jλ1, Jλ2, Jλ3, and Jλ7. The λ light chain locus in humans is similar in structure to the κ locus of both mice and humans in that the human λ light chain locus has several variable region gene segments that are capable of recombining to form a functional light chain protein. The human λ light chain locus contains approximately 70 V gene segments and 7 Jλ-Cλ gene segment pairs. Only four of these Jλ-Cλ gene segment pairs appear to be functional. In some alleles, a fifth Jλ-Cλ gene segment pair is reportedly a pseudo gene (Cλ6). The 70 Vλ gene segments appear to contain 38 functional gene segments. The 70 Vλ sequences are arranged in three clusters, all of which contain different members of distinct V gene family groups (clusters A, B and C; FIG. 1). This is a potentially rich source of relatively untapped diversity for generating antibodies with human V regions in non-human animals. In stark contrast, the mouse λ light chain locus contains only two or three (depending on the strain) mouse Vλ region gene segments (FIG. 2). At least for this reason, the severe κ bias in mice is not thought to be particularly detrimental to total antibody diversity. According published maps of the mouse λ light chain locus, the locus consists essentially of two clusters of gene segments within a span of approximately 200 kb (FIG. 2). The two clusters contain two sets of V, J, and C genes that are capable of independent rearrangement: Vλ2-Jλ2-Cλ2-Jλ4-Cλ4 and Vλ1-Jλ3-Cλ3-Jλ1-Cλ1. Although Vλ2 has been found to recombine with all Jλ gene segments, Vλ1 appears to exclusively recombine with Cλ1. Cλ4 is believed to be a pseudo gene with defective splice sites. The mouse κ light chain locus is strikingly different. The structure and number of gene segments that participate in the recombination events leading to a functional light chain protein from the mouse κ locus is much more complex (FIG. 3). Thus, mouse λ light chains do not greatly contribute to the diversity of an antibody population in a typical mouse. Exploiting the rich diversity of the human λ light chain locus in mice would likely result in, among other things, a source for a more complete human repertoire of light chain V domains. Previous attempts to tap this diversity used human transgenes containing chunks of the human λ light chain locus randomly incorporated into the mouse genome (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,998,514 and U.S. Pat. No. 7,435,871). Mice containing these randomly integrated transgenes reportedly express fully human λ light chains, however, in some cases, one or both endogenous light chain loci remain intact. This situation is not desirable as the human λ light chain sequences contend with the mouse light chain (κ or λ) in the expressed antibody repertoire of the mouse. In contrast, the inventors describe genetically modified mice that are capable of expressing one or more λ light chain nucleic acid sequences directly from a mouse light chain locus, including by replacement at an endogenous mouse light chain locus. Genetically modified mice capable of expressing human λ light chain sequences from an endogenous locus may be further bred to mice that comprise a human heavy chain locus and thus be used to express antibodies comprising V regions (heavy and light) that are fully human. In various embodiments. The V regions express with mouse constant regions. In various embodiments, no endogenous mouse immunoglobulin gene segments are present and the V regions express with human constant regions. These antibodies would prove useful in numerous applications, both diagnostic as well as therapeutic. Many advantages can be realized for various embodiments of expressing binding proteins derived from human Vλ and Jλ gene segments in mice. Advantages can be realized by placing human λ sequences at an endogenous light chain locus, for example, the mouse κ or λ locus. Antibodies made from such mice can have light chains that comprise human Vλ domains fused to a mouse CL region, specifically a mouse Cκ or Cλ region. The mice will also express human Vλ domains that are suitable for identification and cloning for use with human CL regions, specifically Cκ and/or Cλ regions. Because B cell development in such mice is otherwise normal, it is possible to generate compatible Vλ domains (including somatically mutated Vλ domains) in the context of either Cλ or Cκ regions. Genetically modified mice are described that comprise an unrearranged Vλ gene segment at an immunoglobulin κ or λ light chain locus. Mice that express antibodies that comprise a light chain having a human Vλ domain fused to a Cκ and/or Cλ region are described. Sterile Transcripts of the Immunoglobulin κ Light Chain Locus Variations on the theme of expressing human immunoglobulin λ sequences in mice are reflected in various embodiments of genetically modified mice capable of such expression. Thus, in some embodiments, the genetically modified mice comprise certain non-coding sequence(s) from a human locus. In one embodiment, the genetically modified mouse comprises human Vλ and Jλ gene segments at an endogenous κ light chain locus, and further comprises a human κ light chain genomic fragment. In a specific embodiment, the human κ light chain genomic fragment is a non-coding sequence naturally found between a human Vκ gene segment and a human Jκ gene segment. The human and mouse κ light chain loci contain sequences that encode sterile transcripts that lack either a start codon or an open reading frame, and that are regarded as elements that regulate transcription of the κ light chain loci. These sterile transcripts arise from an intergenic sequence located downstream or 3′ of the most proximal Vκ gene segment and upstream or 5′ of the κ light chain intronic enhancer (Eκi) that is upstream of the κ light chain constant region gene (Cκ). The sterile transcripts arise from rearrangement of the intergenic sequence to form a VκJκ1 segment fused to a Cκ. A replacement of the κ light chain locus upstream of the Cκ gene would remove the intergenic region encoding the sterile transcripts. Therefore, in various embodiments, a replacement of mouse κ light chain sequence upstream of the mouse Cκ gene with human λ light chain gene segments would result in a humanized mouse κ light chain locus that contains human Vλ and Jλ gene segments but not the κ light chain intergenic region that encodes the sterile transcripts. As described herein, humanization of the endogenous mouse κ light chain locus with human λ light chain gene segments, wherein the humanization removes the intergenic region, results in a striking drop in usage of the κ light chain locus, coupled with a marked increase in λ light chain usage. Therefore, although a humanized mouse that lacks the intergenic region is useful in that it can make antibodies with human light chain variable domains (e.g., human λ or κ domains), usage from the locus decreases. Also described is humanization of the endogenous mouse κ light chain locus with human Vλ and Jλ gene segments coupled with an insertion of a human κ intergenic region to create a Vλ locus that contains, with respect to transcription, between the final human Vλ gene segment and the first human Jλ gene segment, a κ intergenic region; which exhibits a B cell population with a higher expression than a locus that lacks the κ intergenic region. This observation is consistent with a hypothesis that the intergenic region—directly through a sterile transcript, or indirectly—suppresses usage from the endogenous λ light chain locus. Under such a hypothesis, including the intergenic region would result in a decrease in usage of the endogenous λ light chain locus, leaving the mouse a restricted choice but to employ the modified (λ into κ) locus to generate antibodies. In various embodiments, a replacement of mouse κ light chain sequence upstream of the mouse Cκ gene with human λ light chain sequence further comprises a human κ light chain intergenic region disposed, with respect to transcription, between the 3′ untranslated region of the 3′ most Vλ gene segment and 5′ to the first human Jλ gene segment. Alternatively, such an intergenic region may be omitted from a replaced endogenous κ light chain locus (upstream of the mouse Cκ gene) by making a deletion in the endogenous λ light chain locus. Likewise, under this embodiment, the mouse generates antibodies from an endogenous κ light chain locus containing human λ light chain sequences. Approaches to Engineering Mice to Express Human Vλ Domains Various approaches to making genetically modified mice that make antibodies that contain a light chain that has a human Vλ domain fused to an endogenous CL (e.g. Ck or Cλ) region are described. Genetic modifications are described that, in various embodiments, comprise a deletion of one or both endogenous light chain loci. For example, to eliminate mouse λ light chains from the endogenous antibody repertoire a deletion of a first Vλ-Jλ-Cλ gene cluster and replacement, in whole or in part, of the Vλ-Jλ gene segments of a second gene cluster with human Vλ-Jλ gene segments can be made. Genetically modified mouse embryos, cells, and targeting constructs for making the mice, mouse embryos, and cells are also provided. The deletion of one endogenous Vλ-Jλ-Cλ gene cluster and replacement of the Vλ-Jλ gene segments of another endogenous Vλ-Jλ-Cλ gene cluster employs a relatively minimal disruption in natural antibody constant region association and function in the animal, in various embodiments, because endogenous Cλ genes are left intact and therefore retain normal functionality and capability to associate with the constant region of an endogenous heavy chain. Thus, in such embodiments the modification does not affect other endogenous heavy chain constant regions dependent upon functional light chain constant regions for assembly of a functional antibody molecule containing two heavy chains and two light chains. Further, in various embodiments the modification does not affect the assembly of a functional membrane-bound antibody molecule involving an endogenous heavy chain and a light chain, e.g., a hVλ domain linked to a mouse Cλ region. Because at least one functional Cλ gene is retained at the endogenous locus, animals containing a replacement of the Vλ-Jλ gene segments of an endogenous Vλ-Jλ-Cλ gene cluster with human Vλ-Jλ gene segments should be able to make normal λ light chains that are capable of binding antigen during an immune response through the human Vλ-Jλ gene segments present in the expressed antibody repertoire of the animal. A schematic illustration (not to scale) of a deleted endogenous mouse Vλ-Jλ-Cλ gene cluster is provided in FIG. 2. As illustrated, the mouse λ light chain locus is organized into two gene clusters, both of which contain function gene segments capable of recombining to form a function mouse λ light chain. The endogenous mouse Vλ1-Jλ3-Cλ3-Jλ1-Cλ1 gene cluster is deleted by a targeting construct (Targeting Vector 1) with a neomycin cassette flanked by recombination sites. The other endogenous gene cluster (Vλ2-Vλ3-Jλ2-Cλ2-Jλ4-Cλ4) is deleted in part by a targeting construct (Targeting Vector 2) with a hygromycin-thymidine kinase cassette flanked by recombination sites. In this second targeting event, the Cλ2-Jλ4-Cλ4 endogenous gene segments are retained. The second targeting construct (Targeting Vector 2) is constructed using recombination sites that are different than those in the first targeting construct (Targeting Vector 1) thereby allowing for the selective deletion of the selection cassette after a successful targeting has been achieved. The resulting double-targeted locus is functionally silenced in that no endogenous λ light chain can be produced. This modified locus can be used for the insertion of human Vλ and Jλ gene segments to create an endogenous mouse λ locus comprising human Vλ and Jλ gene segments, whereby, upon recombination at the modified locus, the animal produces λ light chains comprising rearranged human Vλ and Jλ gene segments linked to an endogenous mouse Cλ gene segment. Genetically modifying a mouse to render endogenous λ gene segments nonfunctional, in various embodiments, results in a mouse that exhibits exclusively κ light chains in its antibody repertoire, making the mouse useful for evaluating the role of λ light chains in the immune response, and useful for making an antibody repertoire comprising Vκ domains but not Vλ domains. A genetically modified mouse that expresses a hVλ linked to a mouse Cλ gene having been recombined at the endogenous mouse λ light chain locus can be made by any method known in the art. A schematic illustration (not to scale) of the replacement of the endogenous mouse Vλ2-Vλ3-Jλ2 gene segments with human Vλ and Jλ gene segments is provided in FIG. 4A. As illustrated, an endogenous mouse λ light chain locus that had been rendered nonfunctional is replaced by a targeting construct (12/1-λ Targeting Vector) that includes a neomycin cassette flanked by recombination sites. The Vλ2-Vλ3-Jλ2 gene segments are replaced with a genomic fragment containing human λ sequence that includes 12 hVλ gene segments and a single hJλ gene segment. Thus, this first approach positions one or more hVλ gene segments at the endogenous λ light chain locus contiguous with a single hJλ gene segment (FIG. 4A). Further modifications to the modified endogenous λ light chain locus can be achieved with using similar techniques to insert more hVλ gene segments. For example, schematic illustrations of two additional targeting constructs (+16-λ and +12-λ Targeting Vectors) used for progressive insertion of addition human hVλ gene segments are provided in FIG. 5A. As illustrated, additional genomic fragments containing specific human hVλ gene segments are inserted into the modified endogenous λ light chain locus in successive steps using homology provided by the previous insertion of human λ light chain sequences. Upon recombination with each targeting construct illustrated, in sequential fashion, 28 additional hVλ gene segments are inserted into the modified endogenous λ light chain locus. This creates a chimeric locus that produces a λ light chain protein that comprises human Vλ Jλ gene segments linked to a mouse Cλ gene. The above approaches to insert human λ light chain gene segments at the mouse λ locus, maintains the enhancers positioned downstream of the Cλ2-Jλ4-Cλ4 gene segments (designated Enh 2.4, Enh and Enh 3.1 FIG. 4A and FIG. 5A). This approach results in a single modified allele at the endogenous mouse λ light chain locus (FIG. 7A). Compositions and methods for making a mouse that expresses a light chain comprising hVλ and Jλ gene segments operably linked to a mouse Cλ gene segment, are provided, including compositions and method for making a mouse that expresses such genes from an endogenous mouse λ light chain locus. The methods include selectively rendering one endogenous mouse Vλ-Jλ-Cλ gene cluster nonfunctional (e.g., by a targeted deletion), and employing a hVλ and Jλ gene segments at the endogenous mouse λ light chain locus to express a hVλ domain in a mouse. Alternatively, in a second approach, human λ light chain gene segments may be positioned at the endogenous κ light chain locus. The genetic modification, in various embodiments, comprises a deletion of the endogenous κ light chain locus. For example, to eliminate mouse κ light chains from the endogenous antibody repertoire a deletion of the mouse Vκ and Jκ gene segments can be made. Genetically modified mouse embryos, cells, and targeting constructs for making the mice, mouse embryos, and cells are also provided. For the reasons stated above, the deletion of the mouse Vκ and Jκ gene segments employs a relatively minimal disruption. A schematic illustration (not to scale) of deleted mouse Vκ and Jκ gene segments is provided in FIG. 3. The endogenous mouse Vκ and Jκ gene segments are deleted via recombinase-mediated deletion of mouse sequences position between two precisely positioned targeting vectors each employing site-specific recombination sites. A first targeting vector (Jκ Targeting Vector) is employed in a first targeting event to delete the mouse Jκ gene segments. A second targeting vector (Vκ Targeting Vector) is employed in a second, sequential targeting event to delete a sequence located 5′ of the most distal mouse Vκ gene segment. Both targeting vectors contain site-specific recombination sites thereby allowing for the selective deletion of both selection cassettes and all intervening mouse κ light chain sequences after a successful targeting has been achieved. The resulting deleted locus is functionally silenced in that no endogenous κ light chain can be produced. This modified locus can be used for the insertion of hVλ and Jλ gene segments to create an endogenous mouse κ locus comprising hVλ and Jλ gene segments, whereby, upon recombination at the modified locus, the animal produces λ light chains comprising rearranged hVλ and Jλ gene segments operably linked to an endogenous mouse Cκ gene segment. Various targeting vectors comprising human λ light chain sequences can be used in conjunction with this deleted mouse κ locus to create a hybrid light chain locus containing human λ gene segments operably linked with a mouse Cκ region. Thus, a second approach positions one or more human Vλ gene segments are positioned at the mouse κ light chain locus contiguous with a single human Jλ gene segment (12/1-κ Targeting Vector, FIG. 4B). In various embodiments, modifications to this approach can be made to add gene segments and/or regulatory sequences to optimize the usage of the human λ light chain sequences from the mouse κ locus within the mouse antibody repertoire. In a third approach, one or more hVλ gene segments are positioned at the mouse κ light chain locus contiguous with four hJλ gene sequences (12/4-κ Targeting Vector FIG. 4B). In a third approach, one or more hVλ gene segments are positioned at the mouse κ light chain locus contiguous with a human κ intergenic sequence and a single hJλ gene sequence (12(κ)1-κ Targeting Vector, FIG. 4B). In a fourth approach, one or more hVλ gene segments are positioned at the mouse κ light chain locus contiguous with a human κ intergenic sequence four hJλ gene sequences (12(κ)4-κ Targeting Vector FIG. 4B). All of the above approaches to insert human λ light chain gene segments at the mouse κ locus, maintain the κ intronic enhancer element upstream of the Cκ gene (designated Eκi, FIG. 4B and FIG. 5B) and the 3′ κ enhancer downstream of the Cκ gene (designated Eκ3′, FIG. 4B and FIG. 5B). The approaches result in four separate modified alleles at the endogenous mouse κ light chain locus (FIG. 7B). In various embodiments, genetically modified mouse comprise a knockout of the endogenous mouse λ light chain locus. In one embodiment, the λ light chain locus is knocked out by a strategy that deletes the region spanning Vλ2 to Jλ2, and the region spanning Vλ1 to Cλ1 (FIG. 2). Any strategy that reduces or eliminates the ability of the endogenous λ light chain locus to express endogenous λ domains is suitable for use with embodiments in this disclosure. Lambda Domain Antibodies from Genetically Modified Mice Mice comprising human I sequences at either the mouse κ or λ light chain locus will express a light chain that comprises a hVλ region fused to a mouse CL (Ck or Cλ) region. These are advantageously bred to mice that (a) comprise a functionally silenced light chain locus (e.g., a knockout of the endogenous mouse κ or λ light chain locus); (b) comprise an endogenous mouse λ light chain locus that comprises hV and hJ gene segments operably linked to an endogenous mouse Cλ gene; (c) comprise an endogenous mouse k light chain locus that comprises hVκ and hJκ gene segments operably linked to an endogenous mouse Ck gene; and, (d) a mouse in which one k allele comprises hVκs and hJκs; the other k allele comprising hVλs and hJλs; one λ allele comprising hVλs and hJλs and one λ allele silenced or knocked out, or both λ alleles comprising hVλs and hJλs; and, two heavy chain alleles that each comprise hVHs, hDHs, and hJHs. The antibodies that comprise the hVI domains expressed in the context of either Ck or Cλ are used to make fully human antibodies by cloning the nucleic acids encoding the hVI domains into expression constructs that bear genes encoding human Cλ. Resulting expression constructs are transfected into suitable host cells for expressing antibodies that display a fully hVI domain fused to hCλ. EXAMPLES The following examples are provided so as to describe how to make and use methods and compositions of the invention, and are not intended to limit the scope of what the inventors regard as their invention. Unless indicated otherwise, temperature is indicated in Celsius, and pressure is at or near atmospheric. Example I Deletion of the Mouse Immunoglobulin Light Chain Loci Various targeting constructs were made using VELOCIGENE® technology (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,586,251 and Valenzuela et al. (2003) High-throughput engineering of the mouse genome coupled with high-resolution expression analysis, Nature Biotech. 21(6):652-659) to modify mouse genomic Bacterial Artificial Chromosome (BAC) libraries to inactivate the mouse κ and λ light chain loci. Deletion of the mouse λ light chain locus. DNA from mouse BAC clone RP23-135k15 (Invitrogen) was modified by homologous recombination to inactivate the endogenous mouse λ light chain locus through targeted deletion of the Vλ-Jλ-Cλ gene clusters (FIG. 2). Briefly, the entire proximal cluster comprising Vλ1-Jλ3-Cλ3-Jλ1-Cλ1 gene segments was deleted in a single targeting event using a targeting vector comprising a neomycin cassette flanked by loxP sites with a 5′ mouse homology arm containing sequence 5′ of the Vλ1 gene segment and a 3′ mouse homology arm containing sequence 3′ of the Cλ1 gene segment (FIG. 2, Targeting Vector 1). A second targeting construct was prepared to precisely delete the distal endogenous mouse λ gene cluster containing Vλ2-Jλ2-Cλ2-Jλ4-Cλ4 except that the targeting construct contained a 5′ mouse homology arm that contained sequence 5′ of the Vλ2 gene segment and a 3′ mouse homology arm that contained sequence 5′ to the endogenous Cλ2 gene segment (FIG. 2, Targeting Vector 2). Thus, the second targeting construct precisely deleted Vλ2-Jλ2, while leaving Cλ2-Jλ4-Cλ4 intact at the endogenous mouse λ locus. ES cells containing an inactivated endogenous λ locus (as described above) were confirmed by karyotyping and screening methods (e.g., TAQMAN®) known in the art. DNA was then isolated from the modified ES cells and subjected to treatment with CRE recombinase thereby mediating the deletion of the proximal targeting cassette containing the neomycin marker gene, leaving only a single loxP site at the deletion point (FIG. 2, bottom). Deletion of the mouse κ light chain locus. Several targeting constructs were made using similar methods described above to modify DNA from mouse BAC clones RP23-302g12 and RP23-254m04 (Invitrogen) by homologous recombination to inactivate the mouse κ light chain locus in a two-step process (FIG. 3). Briefly, the Jκ gene segments (1-5) of the endogenous mouse κ light chain locus were deleted in a single targeting event using a targeting vector comprising a hygromycin-thymidine kinase (hyg-TK) cassette containing a single loxP site 3′ to the hyg-TK cassette (FIG. 3, Jκ Targeting Vector). The homology arms used to make this targeting vector contained mouse genomic sequence 5′ and 3′ of the endogenous mouse Jκ gene segments. In a second targeting event, a second targeting vector was prepared to delete a portion of mouse genomic sequence upstream (5′) to the most distal endogenous mouse Vκ gene segment (FIG. 3, Vκ Targeting Vector). This targeting vector contained an inverted lox511 site, a loxP site and a neomycin cassette. The homology arms used to make this targeting vector contained mouse genomic sequence upstream of the most distal mouse Vκ gene segment. The targeting vectors were used in a sequential fashion (i.e., Jκ then Vκ) to target DNA in ES cells. ES bearing a double-targeted chromosome (i.e., a single endogenous mouse κ locus targeted with both targeting vectors) were confirmed by karyotyping and screening methods (e.g., Taqman™) known in the art. DNA was then isolated from the modified ES cells and subjected to treatment with Cre recombinase thereby mediating the deletion of endogenous mouse Vκ gene segments and both selection cassettes, while leaving two juxtaposed lox sites in opposite orientation relative to one another (FIG. 3, bottom; SEQ ID NO:1). Thus, two modified endogenous light chain loci (κ and λ) containing intact enhancer and constant regions were created for progressively inserting unrearranged human λ germline gene segments in a precise manner using targeting vectors described below. Example II Replacement of Mouse Light Chain Loci with a Human λ Light Chain Mini-Locus Multiple targeting vectors were engineered for progressive insertion of human λ gene segments into the endogenous mouse κ and λ light chain loci using similar methods as described above. Multiple independent initial modifications were made to the endogenous light chain loci each producing a chimeric light chain locus containing hVλ and Jλ gene segments operably linked to mouse light chain constant genes and enhancers. A human λ mini-locus containing 12 human Vλ and one human Jλ gene segment. A series of initial targeting vectors were engineered to contain the first 12 consecutive human Vλ gene segments from cluster A and a hJλ1 gene segment or four hJλ gene segments using a human BAC clone named RP11-729g4 (Invitrogen). FIGS. 4A and 4B show the targeting vectors that were constructed for making an initial insertion of human λ light chain gene segments at the mouse λ and κ light chain loci, respectively. For a first set of initial targeting vectors, a 124, 125 bp DNA fragment from the 729g4 BAC clone containing 12 hVλ gene segments and a hJλ1 gene segment was engineered to contain a PI-Scel site 996 bp downstream (3′) of the hJλ1 gene segment for ligation of a 3′ mouse homology arm. Two different sets of homology arms were used for ligation to this human fragment; one set of homology arms contained endogenous mouse λ sequences from the 135k15 BAC clone (FIG. 4A) and another set contained endogenous κ sequence 5′ and 3′ of the mouse Vκ and Jκ gene segments from mouse BAC clones RP23-302g12 and RP23-254m04, respectively (FIG. 4B). For the 12/1-λ Targeting Vector (FIG. 4A), a PI-Scel site was engineered at the 5′ end of a 27,847 by DNA fragment containing the mouse Cλ2-Jλ4-Cλ4 and enhancer 2.4 of the modified mouse λ locus described in Example 1. The ˜28 kb mouse fragment was used as a 3′ homology arm by ligation to the ˜124 kb human λ fragment, which created a 3′ junction containing, from 5′ to 3′, a hJλ1 gene segment, 996 bp of human λ sequence 3′ of the hJλ gene segment, 1229 bp of mouse λ sequence 5′ to the mouse Cλ2 gene, the mouse Cλ2 gene and the remaining portion of the ˜28 kb mouse fragment. Upstream (5′) from the human Vλ3-12 gene segment was an additional 1456 bp of human λ sequence before the start of the 5′ mouse homology arm, which contained 23,792 bp of mouse genomic DNA corresponding to sequence 5′ of the endogenous mouse λ locus. Between the 5′ homology arm and the beginning of the human λ sequence was a neomycin cassette flanked by Frt sites. Thus, the 12/1-λ Targeting Vector included, from 5′ to 3′, a 5′ homology arm containing ˜24 kb of mouse λ genomic sequence 5′ of the endogenous λ locus, a 5′ Frt site, a neomycin cassette, a 3′ Frt site, ˜123 kb of human genomic λ sequence containing the first 12 consecutive hVλ gene segments and a hJλ1 gene segment, a PI-Scel site, and a 3′ homology arm containing ˜28 kb of mouse genomic sequence including the endogenous Cλ2-Jλ4-Cλ4 gene segments, the mouse enhancer 2.4 sequence and additional mouse genomic sequence downstream (3′) of the enhancer 2.4 (FIG. 4A). In a similar fashion, the 12/1-κ Targeting Vector (FIG. 4B) employed the same ˜124 human λ fragment with the exception that mouse homology arms containing mouse κ sequence were used such that targeting to the endogenous κ locus could be achieved by homologous recombination. Thus, the 12/1-κ Targeting Vector included, from 5′ to 3′, a 5′ homology arm containing ˜23 kb of mouse genomic sequence 5′ of the endogenous κ locus, an I-Ceul site, a 5′ Frt site, a neomycin cassette, a 3′ Frt site, ˜124 kb of human genomic λ sequence containing the first 12 consecutive hVλ gene segments and a hJλ1 gene segment, a PI-Scel site, and a 3′ homology arm containing ˜28 kb of mouse genomic sequence including the endogenous the mouse Cκ gene, Eκi and Eκ3′ and additional mouse genomic sequence downstream (3′) of Eκ3′ (FIG. 4B, 12/1-κ Targeting Vector). Homologous recombination with either of these two initial targeting vectors created a modified mouse light chain locus (κ or λ containing 12 hVλ gene segments and a hJλ1 gene segment operably linked to the endogenous mouse light chain constant gene and enhancers (Cκ or Cλand Eki/Ek3′ or Enh 2.4/Enh 3.1) gene which, upon recombination, leads to the formation of a chimeric λ light chain. A human λ mini-locus with 12 human Vλ and four human Jλ gene segments. In another approach to add diversity to a chimeric λ light chain locus, a third initial targeting vector was engineered to insert the first 12 consecutive human Vλ gene segments from cluster A and hJλ1, 2, 3 and 7 gene segments into the mouse κ light chain locus (FIG. 4B, 12/4-κ Targeting Vector). A DNA segment containing hJλ1, Jλ2, Jλ3 and Jλ7 gene segments was made by de novo DNA synthesis (Integrated DNA Technologies) including each Jλ gene segment and human genomic sequence of ˜100 bp from both the immediate 5′ and 3′ regions of each Jλ gene segment. A PI-Scel site was engineered into the 3′ end of this ˜1 kb DNA fragment and ligated to a chloroamphenicol cassette. Homology arms were PCR amplified from human λ sequence at 5′ and 3′ positions relative to the hJλ1 gene segment of the human BAC clone 729g4. Homologous recombination with this intermediate targeting vector was performed on a modified 729g4 BAC clone that had been previously targeted upstream (5′) of the human Vλ3-12 gene segment with a neomycin cassette flanked by Frt sites, which also contained an I-Ceul site 5′ to the 5′ Frt site. The double-targeted 729g4 BAC clone included from 5′ to 3′ an I-Ceul site, a 5′ Frt site, a neomycin cassette, a 3′ Frt site, a ˜123 kb fragment containing the first 12 hλA gene segments, a ˜1 kb fragment containing human Jλ1, 2, 3 and 7 gene segments, a PI-Scel site, and a chloroamphenicol cassette. This intermediate targeting vector was digested together with I-Ceul and PI-Scel and subsequently ligated into the modified mouse BAC clone (described above) to create the third targeting vector. This ligation resulted in a third targeting vector for insertion of human λ sequences into the endogenous κ light chain locus, which included, from 5′ to 3′, a 5′ mouse homology arm containing ˜23 kb of genomic sequence 5′ of the endogenous mouse κ locus, an I-Ceul site, a 5′ Frt site, a neomycin cassette, a 3′ Frt site, a ˜123 kb fragment containing the first 12 hVλ gene segments, a ˜1 kb fragment containing hJλ1, 2, 3 and 7 gene segments, a PI-Scel site and a 3′ homology arm containing ˜28 kb of mouse genomic sequence including the endogenous the mouse Cκ gene, Eκi and Eκ3′ and additional mouse genomic sequence downstream (3′) of Eκ3′ (FIG. 4B, 12/4-κ Targeting Vector). Homologous recombination with this third targeting vector created a modified mouse κ light chain locus containing 12 hVλ gene segments and four hJλ gene segments operably linked to the endogenous mouse Cκ gene which, upon recombination, leads to the formation of a chimeric human λ /mouse κ light chain. A human λ mini-locus with an integrated human κ light chain sequence. In a similar fashion, two additional targeting vectors similar to those engineered to make an initial insertion of human λ gene segments into the endogenous κ light chain locus (FIG. 4B, 12/1-κ and 12/4-κ Targeting Vectors) were engineered to progressively insert human λ light chain gene segments using uniquely constructed targeting vectors containing contiguous human λ and κ genomic sequences. These targeting vectors were constructed to include a ˜23 kb human κ genomic sequence naturally located between human Vκ4-1 and Jκ1 gene segments. This human κ genomic sequence was specifically positioned in these two additional targeting vectors between human Vλ and human Jλ gene segments (FIG. 4B, 12(κ)1-κ and 12(κ)4-κ Targeting Vectors). Both targeting vectors containing the human κ genomic sequence were made using the modified RP11-729g4 BAC clone described above (FIG. 6). This modified BAC clone was targeted with a spectinomycin selection cassette flanked by Notl and AsiSI restriction sites (FIG. 6, top left). Homologous recombination with the spectinomycin cassette resulted in a double-targeted 729g4 BAC clone which included, from 5′ to 3′, an I-Ceul site, a 5′ Frt site, a neomycin cassette, a 3′ Frt site, a ˜123 kb fragment containing the first 12 hVλ gene segments, a Notl site about 200 bp downstream (3′) to the nonamer sequence of the hVλ3-1 gene segment, a spectinomycin cassette and an AsiSI site. A separate human BAC clone containing human κ sequence (CTD-2366j12) was targeted two independent times to engineer restriction sites at locations between hVκ4-1 and hJκ1 gene segments to allow for subsequent cloning of a ˜23 kb fragment for ligation with the hVλ gene segments contained in the double targeted modified 729g4 BAC clone (FIG. 6, top right). Briefly, the 2366j12 BAC clone is about 132 kb in size and contains hVκ gene segments 1-6, 1-5, 2-4, 7-3, 5-2, 4-1, human κ genomic sequence down stream of the Vκ gene segments, hJκ gene segments 1-5, the hCκ and about 20 kb of additional genomic sequence of the human κ locus. This clone was first targeted with a targeting vector containing a hygromycin cassette flanked by Frt sites and a Notl site downstream (3′) of the 3′ Frt site. The homology arms for this targeting vector contained human genomic sequence 5′ and 3′ of the Vκ gene segments within the BAC clone such that upon homologous recombination with this targeting vector, the Vκ gene segments were deleted and a Notl site was engineered ˜133 bp downstream of the hVκ4-1 gene segment (FIG. 6, top right). This modified 2366j12 BAC clone was targeted independently with two targeting vectors at the 3′ end to delete the hJκ gene segments with a chloroamphenicol cassette that also contained either a hJλ1 gene segment, a PI-Scel site and an AsiSI site or a human λ genomic fragment containing four hJλ gene segments (supra), a PI-Scel site and an AsiSI site (FIG. 6, top right). The homology arms for these two similar targeting vectors contained sequence 5′ and 3′ of the hJκ gene segments. Homologous recombination with these second targeting vectors and the modified 2366j12 BAC clone yielded a double-targeted 2366j12 clone which included, from 5′ to 3′, a 5′ Frt site, a hygromycin cassette, a 3′ Frt site, a Notl site, a 22,800 bp genomic fragment of the human κ locus containing the intergenic region between the Vκ4-1 and Jκ1 gene segments, either a hJλ1 gene segment or a human λ genomic fragment containing hJλ1, Jλ2, Jλ3 and Jλ7, a PI-Scel site and a chloroamphenicol cassette (FIG. 6, top right). Two final targeting vectors to make the two additional modifications were achieved by two ligation steps using the double-targeted 729g4 and 2366j12 clones. Double targeted 729g4 and 2366j12 clones were digested with Notl and AsiSI yielding one fragment containing the neomycin cassette and hVλ gene segments and another fragment containing the ˜23 kb genomic fragment of the human κ locus containing the intergenic region between the Vκ4-1 and Jκ1 gene segments, either a hJλ1 gene segment or a genomic fragment containing hJλ1, Jλ2, Jλ3 and Jλ7 gene segments, the PI-Scel site and the chloroamphenicol cassette, respectively. Ligation of these fragments generated two unique BAC clones containing from 5′ to 3′ the hVλ gene segments, the human κ genomic sequence between the Vκ4-1 and Jκ1 gene segments, either a hJλ1 gene segment or a genomic fragment containing hJλ1, Jλ2, Jλ3 and Jλ7 gene segments, a PI-Scel site and a chloroamphenicol cassette (FIG. 6, bottom). These new BAC clones were then digested with I-Ceul and PI-Scel to release the unique fragments containing the upstream neomycin cassette and the contiguous human λ and κ sequences and ligated into a modified mouse BAC clone 302g12 which contained from 5′ to 3′ mouse genomic sequence 5′ of the endogenous κ locus, an I-Ceul site, a 5′ Frt site, a neomycin cassette, a 3′ Frt site, hλA gene segments (3-12 to 3-1), a Notl site ˜200 bp downstream of Vλ3-1, ˜23 kb of human κ sequence naturally found between the human Vκ4-1 and Jκ1 gene segments, either a hJλ1 gene segment or a genomic fragment containing hJλ1, Jλ2, Jλ3 and Jλ7 gene segments, the mouse Eκi, the mouse Cκ gene and Eκ3′ (FIG. 4, 12VI-VkJk-hJI1 and 12hVI-VkJk-4hJI Targeting Vectors). Homologous recombination with both of these targeting vectors created two separate modified mouse κ light chain loci containing 12 hVλ gene segments, human κ genomic sequence, and either one or four hJλ gene segments operably linked to the endogenous mouse Cκ gene which, upon recombination, leads to the formation of a chimeric human λ/mouse κ light chain. Example III Engineering Additional Human Vλ Genes Segments Into a Human λ Light Chain Mini-Locus Additional hV└ gene segments were added independently to each of the initial modifications described in Example 2 using similar targeting vectors and methods (FIG. 5A, +16-λ Targeting Vector and FIG. 5B, +16-κ Targeting Vector). Introduction of 16 additional human Vλ gene segments. Upstream (5′) homology arms used in constructing targeting vectors for adding 16 additional hVλ gene segments to the modified light chain loci described in Example 2 contained mouse genomic sequence 5′ of either the endogenous κ or λ light chain loci. The 3′ homology arms were the same for all targeting vectors and contained human genomic sequence overlapping with the 5′ end of the human λ sequence of the modifications as described in Example 2. Briefly, two targeting vectors were engineered for introduction of 16 additional hVλ gene segments to the modified mouse light chain loci described in Example 2 (FIGS. 5A and 5B, +16-λ or +16-κ Targeting Vector). A ˜172 kb DNA fragment from human BAC clone RP11-761|13 (Invitrogen) containing 21 consecutive hVλ gene segments from cluster A was engineered with a 5′ homology arm containing mouse genomic sequence 5′ to either the endogenous κ or λ light chain loci and a 3′ homology arm containing human genomic λ sequence. The 5′ mouse κ or λ homology arms used in these targeting constructs were the same 5′ homology arms described in Example 2 (FIGS. 5A and 5B). The 3′ homology arm included a 53,057 bp overlap of human genomic λ sequence corresponding to the equivalent 5′ end of the ˜123 kb fragment of human genomic λ sequence described in Example 2. These two targeting vectors included, from 5′ to 3′, a 5′ mouse homology arm containing either ˜23 kb of genomic sequence 5′ of the endogenous mouse κ light chain locus or ˜24 kb of mouse genomic sequence 5′ of the endogenous I light chain locus, a 5′ Frt site, a hygromycin cassette, a 3′ Frt site and 171,457 bp of human genomic λ sequence containing 21 consecutive hVλ gene segments, ˜53 kb of which overlaps with the 5′ end of the human λ sequence described in Example 3 and serves as the 3′ homology arm for this targeting construct (FIGS. 5A and 5B, +16-λ or +16-κ Targeting Vectors). Homologous recombination with these targeting vectors created independently modified mouse κ and λ light chain loci each containing 28 hVλ gene segments and a hJλ1 gene segment operably linked to endogenous mouse constant genes (Cκ or Cλ2) which, upon recombination, leads to the formation of a chimeric light chain. In a similar fashion, the +16-κ Targeting Vector was also used to introduce the 16 additional hVλ gene segments to the other initial modifications described in Example 2 that incorporated multiple hJλ gene segments with and without an integrated human κ sequence (FIG. 4B). Homologous recombination with this targeting vector at the endogenous mouse κ locus containing the other initial modifications created mouse κ light chain loci containing 28 hVλ gene segments and hJλ1, 2, 3 and 7 gene segments with and without a human Vκ-Jκ genomic sequence operably linked to the endogenous mouse Cκ gene which, upon recombination, leads to the formation of a chimeric λ-κ light chain. Introduction of 12 additional human Vλ gene segments. Additional hVλ gene segments were added independently to each of the modifications described above using similar targeting vectors and methods. The final locus structure resulting from homologous recombination with targeting vectors containing additional hVλ gene segments are shown in FIGS. 7A and 7B. Briefly, a targeting vector was engineered for introduction of 12 additional hVλ gene segments to the modified mouse κ and λ light chain loci described above (FIGS. 5A and 5B, +12-λ or 12-κ Targeting Vectors). A 93,674 bp DNA fragment from human BAC clone RP11-22|18 (Invitrogen) containing 12 consecutive hVλ gene segments from cluster B was engineered with a 5′ homology arm containing mouse genomic sequence 5′ to either the endogenous mouse κ or λ light chain loci and a 3′ homology arm containing human genomic λ sequence. The 5′ homology arms used in this targeting construct were the same 5′ homology arms used for the addition of 16 hVλ gene segments described above (FIGS. 5A and 5B). The 3′ homology arm was made by engineering a PI-Scel site ˜3431 bp 5′ to the human Vλ3-29P gene segment contained in a 27,468 bp genomic fragment of human λ sequence from BAC clone RP11-761|13. This PI-Scel site served as a ligation point to join the ˜94 kb fragment of additional human λ sequence to the ˜27 kb fragment of human λ sequence that overlaps with the 5′ end of the human λ sequence in the previous modification using the +16-λ or +16-κ Targeting Vectors (FIGS. 5A and 5B). These two targeting vectors included, from 5′ to 3′, a 5′ homology arm containing either ˜23 kb of mouse genomic sequence 5′ of the endogenous κ light chain locus or ˜24 kb of mouse genomic sequence 5′ of the endogenous λ light chain locus, a 5′ Frt site, a neomycin cassette, a 3′ Frt site and 121,188 bp of human genomic λ sequence containing 16 hVλ gene segments and a PI-Scel site, ˜27 kb of which overlaps with the 5′ end of the human λ sequence from the insertion of 16 addition hVλ gene segments and serves as the 3′ homology arm for this targeting construct (FIGS. 5A and 5B, +12-λ or 12-κ Targeting Vectors). Homologous recombination with these targeting vectors independently created modified mouse κ and λ light chain loci containing 40 hVλ gene segments and human Jλ1 operably linked to the endogenous mouse constant genes (Cκ or Cλ2) which, upon recombination, leads to the formation of a chimeric light chain (bottom of FIGS. 5A and 5B). In a similar fashion, the +12-κ Targeting Vector was also used to introduce the 12 additional hVλ gene segments to the other initial modifications that incorporated multiple hJλ gene segments with and without an integrated human κ sequence (FIG. 4B). Homologous recombination with this targeting vector at the endogenous mouse κ locus containing the other modifications created a mouse κ light chain locus containing 40 hVλ gene segments and hJλ1, 2, 3 and 7 gene segments with and without a human Vκ-Jκ genomic sequence operably linked to the endogenous mouse Cκ gene which, upon recombination, leads to the formation of a chimeric λ-κ light chain. Example IV Identification of Targeted ES Cells Bearing Human λ Light Chain Gene Segments Targeted BAC DNA made according to the foregoing Examples was used to electroporate mouse ES cells to create modified ES cells for generating chimeric mice that express human λ light chain gene segments. ES cells containing an insertion of unrearranged human λ light chain gene segments were identified by a quantitative TAQMAN® assay. Specific primers sets and probes were design for insertion of human λ sequences and associated selection cassettes (gain of allele, GOA), loss of endogenous mouse sequences and any selection cassettes (loss of allele, LOA) and retention of flanking mouse sequences (allele retention, AR). For each additional insertion of human λ sequences, additional primer sets and probes were used to confirm the presence of the additional human λ sequences as well as the previous primer sets and probes used to confirm retention of the previously targeted human sequences. Table 1 sets forth the primers and associated probes used in the quantitative PCR assays. Table 2 sets forth the combinations used for confirming the insertion of each section of human λ light chain gene segments in ES cell clones. ES cells bearing the human λ light chain gene segments are optionally transfected with a construct that expresses FLP in order to remove the Frt'ed neomycin cassette introduced by the insertion of the targeting construct containing human Vλ5-52—Vλ1-40 gene segments (FIGS. 5A and 5B). The neomycin cassette may optionally be removed by breeding to mice that express FLP recombinase (e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,774,279). Optionally, the neomycin cassette is retained in the mice.

No. 7,294,754 and Poueymirou et al. (2007) F0 generation mice that are essentially fully derived from the donor gene-targeted ES cells allowing immediate phenotypic analyses Nature Biotech. 25(1):91-99. VELOCIMICE® (F0 mice fully derived from the donor ES cell) independently bearing human λ gene segments were identified by genotyping using a modification of allele assay (Valenzuela et al., supra) that detected the presence of the unique human λ gene segments (supra). κ:λ light chain usage of mice bearing human λ light chain gene segments. Mice homozygous for each of three successive insertions of hVλ gene segments with a single hJλ gene segment (FIG. 5B) and mice homozygous for a first insertion of hVλ gene segments with either a single hJλ gene segment or four human Jλ gene segments including a human Vκ-Jκ genomic sequence (FIG. 4B) were analyzed for κ and λ light chain expression in splenocytes using flow cytometry. Briefly, spleens were harvested from groups of mice (ranging from three to seven animals per group) and grinded using glass slides. Following lysis of red blood cells (RBCs) with ACK lysis buffer (Lonza Walkersville), splenocytes were stained with fluorescent dye conjugated antibodies specific for mouse CD19 (Clone 1D3; BD Biosciences), mouse CD3 (17A2; Biolegend), mouse Igκ (187.1; BD Biosciences) and mouse Igλ (RML-42; Biolegend). Data was acquired using a BD™ LSR II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and analyzed using FLOWJO™ software (Tree Star, Inc.). Table 3 sets forth the average percent values for B cells (CD19+), κ light chain (CD19+Igκ+Igλ−) and λ light chain (CD19+Igκ−Igλ+) expression observed in splenocytes from groups of animals bearing each genetic modification. In a similar experiment, B cell contents of the splenic compartment from mice homozygous for a first insertion of 12 hVλ and four hJλ gene segments including a human Vκ-Jκ genomic sequence operably linked to the mouse Cκ gene (bottom of FIG. 4B) and mice homozygous for 40 hVλ and one hJλ gene segment (bottom of FIG. 5B or top of FIG. 7B) were analyzed for Igλ and Igκ expression using flow cytometry (as described above). FIG. 8A shows the Igλ and Igκ expression in CD19+ B cells for a representative mouse from each group. The number of CD19+ B cells per spleen was also recorded for each mouse (FIG. 8B). In another experiment, B cell contents of the spleen and bone marrow compartments from mice homozygous for 40 hVλ and four hJλ gene segments including a human Vκ-Jκ genomic sequence operably linked to the mouse Cκ gene (bottom of FIG. 7B) were analyzed for progression through B cell development using flow cytometry of various cell surface markers. Briefly, two groups (N=3 each, 9-12 weeks old, male and female) of wild type and mice homozygous for 40 hVλ and four hJλ gene segments including a human Vκ-Jκ genomic sequence operably linked to the mouse Cκ gene were sacrificed and spleens and bone marrow were harvested. Bone marrow was collected from femurs by flushing with complete RPMI medium (RPMI medium supplemented with fetal calf serum, sodium pyruvate, Hepes, 2-mercaptoethanol, non-essential amino acids, and gentamycin). RBCs from spleen and bone marrow preparations were lysed with ACK lysis buffer (Lonza Walkersville), followed by washing with complete RPMI medium. 1×106 cells were incubated with anti-mouse CD16/CD32 (2.4G2, BD Biosciences) on ice for 10 minutes, followed by labeling with a selected antibody panel for 30 min on ice. Bone marrow panel: anti-mouse FITC-CD43 (1B11, BioLegend), PE-ckit (2B8, BioLegend), PeCy7-IgM (II/41, eBioscience), PerCP-Cy5.5-IgD (11-26c.2a, BioLegend), APC-B220 (RA3-6B2, eBioscience), APC-H7-CD19 (ID3, BD) and Pacific Blue-CD3 (17A2, BioLegend). Bone marrow and spleen panel: anti-mouse FITC-Igκ (187.1, BD), PE-Igλ (RML-42, BioLegend), PeCy7-IgM (II/41, ebioscience), PerCP-Cy5.5-IgD (11-26c.2a, BioLegend), Pacific Blue-CD3 (17A2, BioLegend), APC-B220 (RA3-6B2, eBioscience), APC-H7-CD19 (ID3, BD). Following staining, cells were washed and fixed in 2% formaldehyde. Data acquisition was performed on a FACSCANTOII™ flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and analyzed with FLOWJO™ software (Tree Star, Inc.). FIGS. 9A-9D show the results for the splenic compartment of one representative mouse from each group. FIGS. 10A-10E show the results for the bone marrow compartment of one representative mouse from each group. Table 4 sets forth the average percent values for B cells (CD19+), κ light chain (CD19+Igκ+Igλ−) and λ light chain (CD19+Igκ−Igλ+) expression observed in splenocytes from groups of animals bearing various genetic modifications. Table 5 sets forth the average percent values for B cells (CD19+), mature B cells (B220hiIgM+), immature B cells (B220intIgM+), immature B cells expressing κ light chain (B220intIgM+Igκ+) and immature B cells expressing λ light chain (B220intIgM+Igλ+) observed in bone marrow of wild type and mice homozygous for 40 hVλ and four hJλ gene segments including a human Vκ-Jκ genomic sequence operably linked to the mouse Cκ gene. This experiment was repeated with additional groups of the mice described above and demonstrated similar results (data not shown).

Mice heterozygous for a first insertion of human λ sequences (hVλ3-12-hVλ3-1 and hJλ1, FIG. 5B) and homozygous for a third insertion of human λ sequences (hVλ5-52-hVλ3-1 and hJλ1, FIG. 5B) were analyzed for human λ light chain gene usage by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using RNA isolated from splenocytes. Briefly, spleens were harvested and perfused with 10 mL RPMI-1640 (Sigma) with 5% HI-FBS in sterile disposable bags. Each bag containing a single spleen was then placed into a STOMACHER™ (Seward) and homogenized at a medium setting for 30 seconds. Homogenized spleens were filtered using a 0.7 μm cell strainer and then pelleted with a centrifuge (1000 rpm for 10 minutes) and RBCs were lysed in BD PHARM LYSE™ (BD Biosciences) for three minutes. Splenocytes were diluted with RPMI-1640 and centrifuged again, followed by resuspension in 1 mL of PBS (Irvine Scientific). RNA was isolated from pelleted splenocytes using standard techniques known in the art. RT-PCR was performed on splenocyte RNA using primers specific for human hVλ gene segments and the mouse Cκ gene (Table 6). PCR products were gel-purified and cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO TA vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced with primers M13 Forward (GTAAAACGAC GGCCAG; SEQ ID NO:55) and M13 Reverse (CAGGAAACAG CTATGAC; SEQ ID NO:56) located within the vector at locations flanking the cloning site. Eighty-four total clones derived from the first and third insertions of human λ sequences were sequenced to determine hVλ gene usage (Table 7). The nucleotide sequence of the hVλ-hJλ1-mCκ junction for selected RT-PCR clones is shown in FIG. 11. In a similar fashion, mice homozygous for a third insertion of human λ light chain gene sequences (i.e. 40 hVλ gene segments and four hJλ gene segments including a human Vκ-Jκ genomic sequence, bottom of FIG. 7B) operably linked to the endogenous mouse Cκ gene were analyzed for human λ light chain gene usage by RT-PCR using RNA isolated from splenocytes (as described above). The human λ light chain gene segment usage for 26 selected RT-PCR clones are shown in Table 8. The nucleotide sequence of the hVλ-hJλ-mCκ junction for selected RT-PCR clones is shown in FIG. 12. In a similar fashion, mice homozygous for a first insertion of human λ light chain gene segments (12 hVλ gene segments and hJλ1, FIG. 4A & FIG. 5A) operably linked to the endogenous mouse Cλ2 gene were analyzed for human λ light chain gene usage by RT-PCR using RNA isolated from splenocytes (as described above). The primers specific for hVλ gene segments (Table 6) were paired with one of two primers specific for the mouse Cλ2 gene; Cλ2-1 (SEQ ID NO:104) or Cλ2-2 (SEQ ID NO:105). Multiple hVλ gene segments rearranged to hλ1 were observed from the RT-PCR clones from mice bearing human λ light chain gene segments at the endogenous mouse λ light chain locus. The nucleotide sequence of the hVλ-hJλ-mCλ2 junction for selected RT-PCR clones is shown in FIG. 13.

The sequences shown in FIG. 11 illustrate unique rearrangements involving different hVλ gene segments with hJλ1 recombined to the mouse Cκ gene. Heterozygous mice bearing a single modified endogenous κ locus containing 12 hVλ gene segments and hJλ1 and homozygous mice bearing two modified endogenous κ loci containing 40 hVλ gene segments and hJλ1 were both able to produce human λ gene segments operably linked to the mouse Cκ gene and produce B cells that expressed human λ light chains. These rearrangements demonstrate that the chimeric loci were able to independently rearrange human λ gene segments in multiple, independent B cells in these mice. Further, these modifications to the endogenous κ light chain locus did not render any of the hVλ gene segments inoperable or prevent the chimeric locus from recombining multiple hVλ and a hJλ (Jλ1) gene segment during B cell development as evidenced by 16 different hVλ gene segments that were observed to rearrange with hJλ1 (Table 7). Further, these mice made functional antibodies containing rearranged human Vλ-Jλ gene segments operably linked to mouse Cκ genes as part of the endogenous immunoglobulin light chain repertoire. FIG. 12 shows the sequence of the hVλ-hJλ-mCκ junction for selected RT-PCR clones from mice homozygous for 40 hVλ and four hJλ gene segments including a human Vκ-Jκ genomic sequence. The sequences shown in FIG. 12 illustrate additional unique rearrangements involving multiple different hVλ gene segments, spanning the entire chimeric locus, with multiple different hJλ gene segments rearranged and operably linked to the mouse Cκ gene. Homozygous mice bearing modified endogenous κ loci containing 40 hVλ and four hJλ gene segments were also able to produce human λ gene segments operably linked to the mouse Cκ gene and produce B cells that expressed human λ light chains. These rearrangements further demonstrate that the all stages of chimeric loci were able to independently rearrange human λ gene segments in multiple, independent B cells in these mice. Further, these additional modifications to the endogenous κ light chain locus demonstrates that each insertion of human λ gene segments did not render any of the hVλ and/or Jλ gene segments inoperable or prevent the chimeric locus from recombining the hVλ and Jλ gene segments during B cell development as evidenced by 12 different hVλ gene segments that were observed to rearrange with all four hJλ gene segments (Table 8) from the 26 selected RT-PCR clone. Further, these mice as well made functional antibodies containing human Vλ-Jλ gene segments operably linked to mouse Cκ regions as part of the endogenous immunoglobulin light chain repertoire. FIG. 13 shows the sequence of the hVλ-hJλ-mCλ2 junction for three individual RT-PCR clones from mice homozygous for 12 hVλ gene segments and hJλ1. The sequences shown in FIG. 13 illustrate additional unique rearrangements involving different hVλ gene segments, spanning the length of the first insertion, with hJλ1 rearranged and operably linked to the mouse Cλ2 gene (2D1=Vλ2-8Jλ1; 2D9=Vλ3-10Jλ1; 3E15=Vλ3-1Jλ1). One clone demonstrated a nonproductive rearrangement due to N additions at the hVλ-hJλ junction (2D1, FIG. 13). This is not uncommon in V(D)J recombination, as the joining of gene segments during recombination has been shown to be imprecise. Although this clone represents an unproductive recombinant present in the light chain repertoire of these mice, this demonstrates that the genetic mechanism that contributes to junctional diversity among antibody genes is operating normally in these mice and leading to an antibody repertoire containing light chains with greater diversity. Homozygous mice bearing modified endogenous λ loci containing 12 hVλ gene segments and hJλ1 were also able to produce human λ gene segments operably linked to an endogenous mouse Cλ gene and produce B cells that expressed reverse chimeric λ light chains containing hVλ regions linked to mouse Cλ regions. These rearrangements further demonstrate that human λ light chain gene segments placed at the other light chain locus (i.e., the λ locus) were able to independently rearrange human λ gene segments in multiple, independent B cells in these mice. Further, the modifications to the endogenous λ light chain locus demonstrate that the insertion of human λ gene segments did not render any of the hVλ and/or hJλ1 gene segments inoperable or prevent the chimeric locus from recombining the hVλ and hJλ1 gene segments during B cell development. Further, these mice also made functional antibodies containing human Vλ-Jλ gene segments operably linked to a mouse Cλ region as part of the endogenous immunoglobulin light chain repertoire. As shown in this Example, mice bearing human λ light chain gene segments at the endogenous κ and λ light chain loci are capable of rearranging human λ light chain gene segments and expressing them in the context of a mouse Cκ and/or Cλ region as part of the normal antibody repertoire of the mouse because a functional light chain is required at various checkpoints in B cell development in both the spleen and bone marrow. Further, early subsets of B cells (e.g., pre-, pro- and transitional B cells) demonstrate a normal phenotype in these mice as compared to wild type littermates (FIGS. 9D, 10A and 10B). A small deficit in bone marrow and peripheral B cell populations was observed, which may be attributed to a deletion of a subset of auto-reactive immature B cells and/or a suboptimal association of human λ light chain with mouse heavy chain. However, the Igκ/Igλ usage observed in these mice demonstrates a situation that is more like human light chain expression than that observed in mice. Example VI Breeding of Mice Expressing Human λ Light Chains From an Endogenous Light Chain Locus To optimize the usage of the human λ gene segments at an endogenous mouse light chain locus, mice bearing the unrearranged human λ gene segments are bred to another mouse containing a deletion in the opposing endogenous light chain locus (either κ or λ). For example, human λ gene segments positioned at the endogenous κ locus would be the only functional light chain gene segments present in a mouse that also carried a deletion in the endogenous λ light chain locus. In this manner, the progeny obtained would express only human └ light chains as described in the foregoing examples. Breeding is performed by standard techniques recognized in the art and, alternatively, by commercial companies, e.g., The Jackson Laboratory. Mouse strains bearing human λ light chain gene segments at the endogenous κ locus and a deletion of the endogenous λ light chain locus are screened for presence of the unique reverse-chimeric (human-mouse) λ light chains and absence of endogenous mouse λ light chains. Mice bearing an unrearranged human λ light chain locus are also bred with mice that contain a replacement of the endogenous mouse heavy chain variable gene locus with the human heavy chain variable gene locus (see U.S. Pat. No. 6,596,541, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, the VELOCIMMUNE® genetically engineered mouse). The VELOCIMMUNE® mouse includes, in part, having a genome comprising human heavy chain variable regions operably linked to endogenous mouse constant region loci such that the mouse produces antibodies comprising a human heavy chain variable region and a mouse heavy chain constant region in response to antigenic stimulation. The DNA encoding the variable regions of the heavy chains of the antibodies can be isolated and operably linked to DNA encoding the human heavy chain constant regions. The DNA can then be expressed in a cell capable of expressing the fully human heavy chain of the antibody. Upon a suitable breeding schedule, mice bearing a replacement of the endogenous mouse heavy chain locus with the human heavy chain locus and an unrearranged human λ light chain locus at the endogenous κ light chain locus is obtained. Antibodies containing somatically mutated human heavy chain variable regions and human λ light chain variable regions can be isolated upon immunization with an antigen of interest. Example VII Generation of Antibodies From Mice Expressing Human Heavy Chains and Human λ Light Chains After breeding mice that contain the unrearranged human λ light chain locus to various desired strains containing modifications and deletions of other endogenous Ig loci (as described above), selected mice are immunized with an antigen of interest. Generally, a VELOCIMMUNE® mouse containing one of the single rearranged human germline light chain regions is challenged with an antigen, and lymphatic cells (such as B-cells) are recovered from serum of the animals. The lymphatic cells may be fused with a myeloma cell line to prepare immortal hybridoma cell lines, and such hybridoma cell lines are screened and selected to identify hybridoma cell lines that produce antibodies containing human heavy chain and human λ light chain that are specific to the antigen used for immunization. DNA encoding the variable regions of the heavy chains and the λ light chains may be isolated and linked to desirable isotypic constant regions of the heavy chain and light chain. Due to the presence of the additional hVλ gene segments as compared to the endogenous mouse λ locus, the diversity of the light chain repertoire is dramatically increased and confers higher diversity on the antigen-specific repertoire upon immunization. The resulting cloned antibody sequences may be subsequently produced in a cell, such as a CHO cell. Alternatively, DNA encoding the antigen-specific chimeric antibodies or the variable domains of the light and heavy chains may be isolated directly from antigen-specific lymphocytes (e.g., B cells). Initially, high affinity chimeric antibodies are isolated having a human variable region and a mouse constant region. As described above, the antibodies are characterized and selected for desirable characteristics, including affinity, selectivity, epitope, etc. The mouse constant regions are replaced with a desired human constant region to generate the fully human antibody containing a somatically mutated human heavy chain and a human λ light chain derived from an unrearranged human λ light chain locus of the invention. Suitable human constant regions include, for example wild type or modified IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, or IgG4. 1.
