PUSHER The present invention relates to a pusher for use in packaging for displaying items for sale. Background It is known to transport pre-packaged items, such as confectionary, from a manufacturing site to a vending site in bulk cartons, such as cardboard boxes. One of the main functions of such a carton is to protect the items from physical damage during transit. At the vending site, the items are typically removed from the carton and arranged on display for sale. It may, however, be desirable to display multiple smaller items in a carton and dispense them directly therefrom. In such a case it can be advantageous to use the same carton that was used for transporting the items. Such cartons are often referred to as ‘shelf ready packs'. US-A-7284662 describes a carton that allows a product to be shipped, displayed, and dispensed all from the same carton. Existing shelf ready packs exhibit a number of problems. For example, items which are stacked in such packs (whether horizontally, vertically or at an inclined angle) can look unsightly after removal of several items. Furthermore, removal of items can result in poor on-shelf presence of the product with the products often hidden from view. It is therefore desirable to have a shelf ready pack which maintains on-shelf presence of the product and allows for the item to be dispensed to the consumer in a controlled manner. It is also be desirable that such a shelf ready pack is formed and filled using existing manufacturing and filling equipment. DE-U-29908078 discloses such a shelf ready pack which aims to solve this problem. The pack comprises a vertical abutment surface having a horizontal pull-tab at its lower edge. The horizontal pull-tab is guided through an opening in the front wall of the pack to move the vertical abutment surface forward within the pack, and hence also any goods in front of it. However, such a pack requires regular attention by pulling the tab forward within the pack. EP-A-1462034 discloses a shelf ready pack having a resilient compressible slider in the dispensing direction, which is inserted behind the goods as they are packaged. As good are removed from the front of the pack, the resilient slider extends towards the front of the pack, thereby pushing the remaining goods contained therein to the front of the pack (see Figures 1 and 2 Brief Summary of the Invention In a first aspect, the present invention relates to a pusher for use in packaging for displaying items, comprising: an extendable member formed from a single elongate strip folded to provide a plurality of sections which are pivotally connected to each other at at least one pivot point and are configured to provide at least a pair of spaced apart portions; and at least one resilient member positioned about the spaced apart portions to bias them towards each other in a first direction; wherein the biasing of the spaced apart portions towards each other results in an extension of the extendable member in a second direction which is perpendicular to the first direction.

Detailed Description The pusher of the present invention will be described below for use with a container in the form of a cardboard carton which is a shelf ready pack. However, it can be used in a wide variety of other applications in different forms of containers. In the following, the relative expressions top and bottom, upper and lower, front and rear, inner and outer, upward and downward, and derivatives thereof are used to refer to the completed carton and parts thereof when the carton is in its intended orientation, as shown in Figures 1 and 2, for placing on a shelf or other display surface. However, the carton may be used and stored in other orientations as desired. Figures 1 and 2 illustrate a prior art carton 10 containing a prior art pusher 16. The carton comprises a base 11, with two side walls 12,13, a rear wall 14, and an at least partial front wall 15, all extending upwardly from the base 11. The carton may be made of any suitable material, a common material for such cartons being cardboard. The carton 10 of Figure 1 is an example of a suitable shelf ready pack for the pusher of the present invention. Now will be described various embodiments of a pusher according to the present invention, which comprises an extendable member and a resilient member. The action of the resilient member causes the extendable member to contract in one direction and extend in a perpendicular direction, which provides a pushing effect when the pusher is located in a carton 10. The extendable member may be constructed from one or more elements. Any suitable stiff material may be used for the elements. An example of such a suitable material is cardboard. In some embodiments of the invention the elements are provided with certain fold lines to enable the elements to be folded into the required configuration. Such fold lines may be formed in any suitable manner, e.g. by simply creasing the element material. The creasing could be done mechanically or by hand. In another example the fold lines may be formed by partially cutting through the element material, for example by laser scoring, and then folding along the scored lines. Figure 3 illustrates a single element 20 used to construct the extendable member 22 for a first embodiment of a pusher 21, the assembled pusher 21 being shown in Figure 4Α. The element 20 is in the form of an elongate, generally rectangular, strip having first and second ends 23,24. A generally transverse fold line 25 is positioned substantially at the midpoint along the length of the element 20. Further transverse fold lines 26 are positioned respectively at about a third of the distance between the central fold line 25 and each of the first and second ends 23,24. Pivot formation points 27 are positioned respectively at about two thirds of the distance between the central fold line 25 and each of the first and second ends 23,24. The pivot formation points 27 for this, and for other embodiments, preferably comprise a slit 28 extending across at least half of the width of the element 20. In order to form a pivot, the pair of pivot formation points 27 must be slit in opposing directions. A notch 29 may be formed where each slit 28 meets the edge of the element 20 (in this and other embodiments) to facilitate interlocking the slits 28. Alternatively, the slits 28 may be formed in another manner, for example a more open slit in the form of a slot having a width and a base (not shown). The element 20 is thus divided into a plurality of sections: two sections A extending between the central fold line 25 and each further fold line 26; two sections Β extending between each further fold line 26 and each pivot formation point 27; and two sections C extending between each pivot formation point 27 and each end 23,24. To assemble the pusher 21, the ends 23,24 of the element 20 are folded inwardly towards each other at the fold lines 25,26 and attached at the pivot formation points 27 by interlocking the slits 28. This forms an extendable member 22 in which the sections A diverge from the central fold line 25 and sections Β converge back towards each other from the further fold lines 26 and are pivotally connected at pivot formation points 27. Sections A and Β therefore define a quadrilateral section which has two opposing pairs of spaced apart vertices. Sections C diverge from the pivot formation points 27 to form a pair of pushing members. A resilient member 30, which is formed from a resilient material, is arranged to encircle the extendable member 22 at the vertices defined by the further fold lines 26. A pair of corresponding notches 45 (not shown) may be provided on opposing edges of the element 20 at the further fold lines 26, in order to aid the location of the resilient member 30. A non-limiting example of a suitable resilient member 30, for this and other embodiments, is an elastic band. The arrangement of the resilient member 30 is such that it urges the spaced apart vertices defined by the further fold lines 26 towards each other, causing the quadrilateral section to contract in that direction, and to elongate in a perpendicular direction. This causes a scissor movement about the pivot point so that the first and second ends 23,24 are also urged towards each other. In use, the assembled pusher 21 is inserted into a carton 10 adjacent the rear wall 14 behind the goods (not shown). The pusher 21 is arranged in the carton 10 such that the vertex defined by the central fold line 25 abuts the rear wall 14 and the first and second ends 23,24 which form the pushing members abut the goods. The pusher 21 is initially compressed by the goods in a first direction 60 against the bias of the resilient member 30, causing the quadrilateral section to flatten in that direction 60. As goods are removed from the carton 10, the force exerted on the pusher 21 by the goods reduces, and thus the resilient member 30 is able to compress the quadrilateral section in a second direction 61 perpendicular to the first direction 60. This has the effect of causing the pusher 21 to extend in the first direction 60 and thereby push the goods forward within the carton 10. The specific pattern and positioning of fold lines 25,26 of the first embodiment of the pusher 21 may be varied, for example as shown in Figure 4Β. In this variation, rather than sections A extending from the vertex defined by the central fold line 25, sections A extend from a flattened section 63. The flattened section 63 may provide more stability to the pusher 21 as it pushes against the rear wall 14 of the carton 10. Figure 5 illustrates another single element 20 used to construct the extendable member 22 for a second embodiment of a pusher 21, the assembled pusher 21 being shown in Figure 6. The element 20 is again in the form of an elongate, generally rectangular, strip having first and second ends 23,24. A generally transverse fold line 25 is positioned substantially at the midpoint of its longest side. Further transverse fold lines 26 are positioned respectively at about 1/7, 3/7, 5/7, and 6/7 of the distance between the central fold line 25 and each of the first and second ends 23,24. Pivot formation points 27 are positioned respectively at about 2/7 and 4/7 of the distance between the central fold line 25 and each of the first and second ends 23,24. In order to form a pivot, each corresponding pair of pivot formation points 27 must be slit in opposing directions. Preferably, the pivot formation points 27 at about 2/7 and 4/7 of the distance between the central fold line 25 and each of the first and second ends 23,24 are additionally slit in opposing directions from each other, in order to form a more secure pusher 21 when assembled. The element 20 is thus divided into a plurality of sections: sections A between the central fold line 25 and each 1/7 further fold line 26; sections Β between each 1/7 further fold line 26 and each 2/7 pivot formation point 27; sections C between each 2/7 pivot formation point 27 and each 3/7 further fold line 26; sections D between each 3/7 further fold line 26 and each 4/7 pivot; sections Ε between each 4/7 pivot and each 5/7 further fold line; sections F between each 5/7 further fold line and each 6/7 further fold line; and sections G between each 6/7 further fold line and each end 23,24. To assemble the extendable member 22 , the ends 23,24 of the element 20 are folded outwardly towards each other at the central fold line 25 and the 6/7 fold lines 26, and folded inwardly towards each other at the 1/7, 3/7, and 5/7 fold lines 26. The corresponding 2/7 and 4/7 pivot formation points 27 are interlocked. This forms the extendable member 22, in which: the sections A diverge from the central fold line 25; sections Β converge back towards each other and are pivotally connected at the 2/7 pivot formation points 27; sections C diverge from the 2/7 pivot formation point 27; sections D converge back towards each other and are pivotally connected at the 4/7 pivot formation points 27; sections Ε diverge from the 4/7 pivot formation point 27; sections F converge back towards each other and meet at the 6/7 further fold line 26; and sections G overlap with sections F to secure the ends 23,24. The skilled person would appreciate that overlapping sections G could be of a different size from that described, and would be able to alter the pusher 21 accordingly. Sections A and Β therefore define a first quadrilateral; sections C and D define a second quadrilateral; and sections Ε and F define a third quadrilateral section which acts as a pushing member. A resilient member 30 is arranged so that it connects the opposing vertices of the second quadrilateral defined by the 3/7 fold lines 26. A pair of corresponding notches 45 (not shown) may be provided on opposing edges of the element 20 at the 3/7 fold lines 26, in order to aid the location of the resilient member 30. The arrangement of the resilient member 30 is such that it urges the spaced apart vertices defined by the further fold lines 26 towards each other. In use, the assembled pusher 21 is inserted into a carton 10 adjacent the rear wall 14 behind the goods (not shown). The pusher 21 is arranged in the carton 10 such that the first quadrilateral abuts the rear wall 14 and the third quadrilateral, which forms the pushing member, abuts the goods. The pusher 21 is thus compressed by the goods in a first direction 60 against the bias of the resilient member 30, causing the quadrilateral sections to flatten in that direction 60. As goods are removed from the carton 10, the force exerted on the pusher 21 by the goods reduces, and thus the resilient member 30 is able to compress the second quadrilateral in a second direction 61, which is perpendicular to the first direction 60. This has the effect of causing the pusher 21 to extend in the first direction 60 and thereby push the goods forward within the carton 10. Figure 7 illustrates a first element 40 and a second element 41 used to construct the extendable member 22 for a third embodiment of a pusher 21, which does not form part of the present invention, the assembled pusher 21 being shown in Figure 8. The first element 40 is in the form of an elongate, generally rectangular, strip having first and second ends 23,24. A generally transverse fold line 25 is positioned substantially at the midpoint along the length of the element 40. An aperture 42 is positioned substantially midway between the central fold line 25 and the first end 23. The aperture 42 is positioned substantially centrally with respect to the width of the member 22. A pivot formation point 27 is positioned substantially midway between the central fold line 25 and the second end 24. The first element 40 is thus divided into a plurality sections: section A extending between the first end 23 and the aperture 42; section Β extending between the aperture 42 and the central fold line 25; section C extending between the central fold line 25 and the pivot formation point 27; and section D extending between the pivot formation point 27 and the second end 24. The second element 41 is in the form of an elongate, generally rectangular, strip having first and second ends 23,24. A generally transverse fold line 25 is positioned substantially at the midpoint along the length of the element 41. A reduced width portion 43 is provided between the central fold line 25 and the first end 23, with a full width portion 44 immediately adjacent the first end 23. The reduced width portion is dimensioned to fit through the aperture 42 in the first element 40. A pivot formation point 27 is positioned substantially midway between the central fold line 25 and the second end 24. In order to form a pivot, the pivot formation points 27 on the first and second elements 40,41 must be slit in opposing directions. The second element 41 is thus divided into a plurality sections: section A extending between the first end 23 and the midpoint between the first end 23 and the central fold line 25; section Β extending between the midpoint between the first end 23 and the central fold line 25 and the central fold line 25; section C extending between the central fold line 25 and the pivot formation point 27; and section D extending between the pivot formation point 27 and the second end 24. To assemble the pusher 21, the ends 23,24 of the first and second elements 40,41 are folded inwardly towards each other at their central fold lines 25. The full width portion 44 of the second element 41 is passed through the aperture 42 of the first element 40 such that the reduced width portion 43 sits within the aperture 42, forming a pivotal connection. The pivot formation points 27 on the first and second elements 40,41 are interlocked in a similar manner as described above. This forms the extendable member 22, in which: sections A converge from the first and second ends 23,24 to the pivot between the aperture 42 and the reduced width portion 43; sections Β diverge outwards from this point to each central fold line 25; and sections C converge from the central fold lines 25 and are pivotally connected at the pivot formation points 27. Sections Β and C therefore define a quadrilateral section. Sections D diverge from the pivot formation points 27 to form a pair of pushing members. A resilient member 30 is arranged around the extendable member 22 about the spaced apart vertices defined by the central fold lines 25 of the first and second elements 40,41. A pair of corresponding notches 45 (not shown) may be provided on opposing edges of one or both of the elements 40,41 at the central fold lines 25, in order to aid the location of the resilient member 30. The arrangement of the resilient member 30 is such that it urges the vertices defined by the central fold lines 25 of the first and second elements 40,41 towards each other, causing the quadrilateral section to contract in one direction and to elongate in the perpendicular direction. This causes a scissor movement about the pivot point 27 so that the first ends 23 and the second ends 24 are also urged respectively towards each other. In use, the assembled pusher 21 is inserted into a carton 10 adjacent the rear wall 14 behind the goods (not shown). The pusher 21 is arranged in the carton 10 such that the first ends 23 of the first and second elements 40,41 abut the rear wall 14 and the second ends 24 of the first and second elements 40,41, which form a pushing member, abut the goods. The pusher 21 is compressed by the goods in a first direction 60 against the force of the resilient member 30, causing the quadrilateral section to flatten in that direction 60. As goods are removed from the carton 10, the force exerted on the pusher 21 by the goods reduces, and thus the resilient member 30 is able to compress the quadrilateral section in a second direction 61 perpendicular to the first direction 60. This has the effect of causing the pusher 21 to extend in the first direction 60 and thereby push the goods forward within the carton 10. Figure 9 illustrates a first element 40 and a second element 41 used to construct the extendable member 22 for a fourth embodiment of a pusher 21, which does not form part of the present invention, the assembled pusher 21 being shown in Figure 10. The first and second elements 40 are preferably identical and are in the form of an elongate, generally rectangular, strip having first and second ends 23,24. A pivot formation point 27 is positioned substantially at the midpoint along the length of the element 40,41. A pair of corresponding notches 45 is provided on opposing edges of the element 40,41 towards the first end 23. The elements 40,41 are thus divided into two sections: sections A extending between the first end 23 and the pivot formation point 27; and sections Β extending between pivot formation point 27 and the second end 24. To assemble the pusher 21, the first and second elements 40,41 are pivotally connected by interlocking their pivot formation points 27. This forms an X-shaped extendable member 22 in which sections A converge from first ends 23 to the pivot formation point 27 and sections Β diverge from the pivot formation points 27 towards the second ends 24, to form a pair of pushing members. A resilient member 30 is arranged to connect the spaced apart first ends 23 of the first and second elements 40,41 by locating the resilient member 30 in the pairs of notches 45. Preferably, the resilient member 30 is in the form of a loop which encircles the pairs of notches 45 on the spaced apart portions. The arrangement of the resilient member 30 is such that it respectively urges the first and second ends 23,24 of the first and second elements 40,41 towards each other via a scissor movement about the pivot point, causing the X to contract in one direction and to elongate in the perpendicular direction. In use, the assembled pusher 21 is inserted into a carton 10 adjacent the rear wall 14 behind the goods (not shown). The pusher 21 is arranged in the carton 10 such that the first ends 23 of the first and second elements 40,41 abut the rear wall 14 and the second ends 24 of the first and second elements 40,41 abut the goods. The pusher 21 is compressed by the goods in a first direction 60 against the bias of the resilient member 30, causing the X to flatten in that direction 60. As goods are removed from the carton 10, the force exerted on the pusher 21 by the goods reduces, and thus the resilient member 30 is able to compress the X in a second direction 61 perpendicular to the first direction 60. This has the effect of causing the pusher 21 to extend in the first direction 60 and thereby push the goods forward within the carton 10. Figure 11 illustrates a first element 40 and a second element 41 used to construct the extendable member 22 for a fifth embodiment of a pusher 21, which does not form part of the present invention, the assembled pusher 21 being shown in Figure 12. The first element 40 is in the form of an elongate, generally rectangular, strip having first and second ends 23,24. A generally transverse fold line 25 is positioned substantially at the midpoint along the length of the element. Apertures 42 are positioned substantially midway between the central fold line 25 and each of the first and second ends 23,24. The apertures 42 are positioned substantially centrally with respect to the width of the first element 40. Alternatively, the apertures 42 could be replaced by deep notches (not shown). The first element 40 is thus divided into a plurality sections: section A extending between the first end 23 and the midpoint between the first end 23 and the central fold line 25; section Β extending between the midpoint between the first end 23 and the central fold line 25 and the central fold line 25; section C extending between the central fold line 25 and the midpoint between the central fold line 25 and the second end 24; and section D extending between the midpoint between the central fold line 25 and the second end 24 and the second end 24. The second element 41 is in the form of an elongate tube having first and second ends 23,24. A generally transverse fold line 25 is positioned substantially at the midpoint along the length of the second element 41. Any suitable tubular form may be used, for example the tube may be hollow or solid and may have any suitable cross-section such as a circular or square cross-section. The second element 41 is dimensioned to fit within the apertures 42 on the first element 40. The second element 41 is thus divided into a plurality sections: section A extending between the first end 23 and the aperture 42; section Β extending between the aperture 42 and the central fold line 25; section C extending between the central fold line 25 and the aperture 42; and section D extending between the aperture 42 and the second end 24. To assemble the pusher 21, the ends 23,24 of the first and second elements 40,41 are folded inwardly towards each other at their central fold lines 25. Each of the first and second ends 23,24 of the second element 41 is passed through an aperture 42 of the first element 40 such that first and second ends 23,24 of the first and second elements 40,41 are aligned respectively and pivotal connections are formed at the apertures 42. This forms the extendable member 22 in which: sections A converge from the first and second ends 23,24 to the pivotal connection point between the aperture 42 and second element 41; sections Β diverge outwards from this point to each central fold line 25; and sections C converge from the central fold lines 25 and are pivotally connected at the second pivotal connection point between the aperture 42 and second element 41. Sections Β and C therefore define a quadrilateral section. Sections D diverge from the second pivotal connection point between the aperture 42 and second element 41 to form a pair of pushing members. A resilient member 30 is arranged so that it biases the spaced apart vertices defined by the central fold lines 25 of the first and second elements 40,41 towards each other. A pair of corresponding notches 45 (not shown) may be provided on opposing edges of one or both of the elements 40,41 at the central fold lines 25, in order to aid the location of the resilient member 30. The arrangement of the resilient member 30 is such that it urges the vertices defined by the central fold lines 25 of the first and second elements 40,41 towards each other, causing the quadrilateral section to contract in one direction and to elongate in the perpendicular direction. This causes a scissor movement about the pivot points so that the first ends 23 and the second ends 24 are also urged respectively towards each other. In use, the assembled pusher 21 is inserted into a carton 10 adjacent the rear wall 14 behind the goods (not shown). The pusher 21 is arranged in the carton 10 such that the first ends 23 of the first and second elements 40,41 abut the rear wall 14 and the second ends 24 of the first and second elements 40,41 abut the goods. The pusher 21 is compressed by the goods in a first direction 60 against the force of the resilient member 30, causing the quadrilateral section to flatten in that direction 60. As goods are removed from the carton 10, the force exerted on the pusher 21 by the goods reduces, and thus the resilient member 30 is able to compress quadrilateral section in a second direction 61 perpendicular to the first direction 60. This has the effect of causing the pusher 21 to extend in the first direction 60 and thereby push the goods forward within the carton 10. Figure 13 illustrates a first element 40 and a second element 41 used to construct the extendable member 22 for a sixth embodiment of a pusher 21, which does not form part of the present invention, the assembled pusher 21 being shown in Figure 14. The first and second elements 40 are preferably identical and are in the form of an elongate tube having first and second ends 23,24. A generally transverse fold line 25 is positioned substantially at the midpoint along the length of the elements 40,41. Again, any suitable tubular form may be used, for example the tube may be hollow or solid and may have any suitable cross-section such as a circular or square cross-section. The elements 40,41 are thus divided into a plurality sections: section A extending between the first end 23 and the midpoint between the first end 23 and the central fold line 25; section Β extending between the midpoint between the first end 23 and the central fold line 25 and the central fold line 25; section C extending between the central fold line 25 and the midpoint between the central fold line 25 and the second end 24; and section D extending between the midpoint between the central fold line 25 and the second end 24 and the second end 24. To assemble the pusher 21, the ends 23,24 of the first and second elements 40,41 are folded inwardly at their central fold lines 25 to form a V-shape. The first and second elements 40,41 are arranged such that the first and second ends 23,24 of one element 40,41 are aligned with each other and with the central fold line 25 of the other element 41,40 and vice versa. Tethering members 51 are used to secure the first and second elements 40,41 to each other at the crossover points 52. This forms the extendable member 22 in which sections A converge from the first and second ends 23,24 to the pivotal connection point formed by the first tethering member 51. Sections Β diverge outwards from this point to each central fold line 25 and sections C converge from the central fold lines 25 and are pivotally connected at the second tethering member 51. Sections Β and C therefore define a quadrilateral section. Sections D diverge from the second tethering member 51 to form a pair of pushing members. A resilient member 30 is arranged about the spaced apart vertices defined by the central fold lines 25 of the first and second elements 40,41. A pair of corresponding notches 45 (not shown) may be provided on opposing edges of one or both of the elements 40,41 at the central fold lines 25, in order to aid the location of the resilient member 30. The arrangement of the resilient member 30 is such that it urges the vertices defined by the central fold lines 25 of the first and second elements 40,41 towards each other, causing the quadrilateral section to contract in one direction and to elongate in the perpendicular direction. This causes a scissor movement about the pivot points so that the first ends 23 and the second ends 24 are also urged respectively towards each other. In use, the assembled pusher 21 is inserted into a carton 10 adjacent the rear wall 14 behind the goods (not shown). The pusher 21 is arranged in the carton 10 such that the first ends 23 of the first and second elements 40,41 abut the rear wall 14 and the second ends 24 of the first and second elements 40,41 abut the goods. The pusher 21 is compressed by the goods in a first direction 60 against the bias of the resilient member 30, causing the quadrilateral section to flatten in that direction 60. As goods are removed from the carton 10, the force exerted on the pusher 21 by the goods reduces, and thus the resilient member 30 is able to compress the quadrilateral section in a second direction 61 perpendicular to the first direction 60. This has the effect of causing the pusher 21 to extend in the first direction 60 and thereby push the goods forward within the carton 10. Figure 15 illustrates a first element 40 and a second element 41 used to construct the extendable member 22 for a seventh embodiment of a pusher 21, which does not form part of the present invention, the assembled pusher 21 being shown in Figure 16. The first and second elements 40 are preferably identical and are in the form of an elongate, generally rectangular, strip having first and second ends 23,24. Two pivot formation points 27 are positioned at substantially 1/4 and 3/4 of the distance from the first end 23 to the second end 24. Preferably, the two pivot formation points 27 are slit in opposing directions from each other, in order to form a more secure pusher 21 when assembled. A pair of corresponding notches 45 is provided on opposing edges of the element 40,41 substantially at the midpoint along the length of the element 40,41. The element 40,41 is thus divided into a plurality sections: section A extending between the first end 23 and the first pivot formation point 27; section Β extending between first pivot formation point 27 and the pair of notches 45; section C extending between the pair of notches 45 and the second pivot formation point 27; and section D extending between the second pivot formation point 27 and the second end 24. To assemble the pusher 21, the first and second elements 40,41 are curved so that their respective pivot formation points 27 can be interlocked. This forms the extendable member 22 in which: sections A converge from the first and second ends 23,24 to the first pivot formation point 27; sections Β diverge outwards from this point to the notches 45; and sections C converge from the notches 45 and are pivotally connected at the second pivot formation point 27. Sections Β and C therefore together define two arcuate portions between the pivot formation points 27, forming an eye-shaped section. Sections D diverge from the second pivot formation point 27 to form a pair of pushing members. A resilient member 30 is arranged around the spaced apart longitudinal midpoints of each of the first and second elements 40,41 ■ The notches 45 aid the positioning of the resilient member 30. The arrangement of the resilient member 30 is such that it urges the spaced apart midpoints of the first and second elements 40,41 towards each other, causing the eye-shaped section defined by the arcs to contract in one direction and to elongate in the perpendicular direction. This causes a scissor movement about the pivot points so that the first ends 23 and the second ends 24 are also urged respectively towards each other. In use, the assembled pusher 21 is inserted into a carton 10 adjacent the rear wall 14 behind the goods (not shown). The pusher 21 is arranged in the carton 10 such that the first ends 23 of the first and second elements 40,41 abut the rear wall 14 and the second ends 24 of the first and second elements 40,41 abut the goods, in the direction of the front wall 15. The pusher 21 is compressed by the goods in a first direction 60 against the force of the resilient member 30, causing the eye-shaped section to flatten in that direction 60. As goods are removed from the carton 10, the force exerted on the pusher 21 by the goods reduces, and thus the resilient member 30 is able to compress the eye-shaped section in a second direction 61 perpendicular to the first direction 60. This has the effect of causing the pusher 21 to extend in the first direction 60 and thereby push the goods forward within the carton 10. Figures 17 and 18 illustrate an eighth embodiment of a pusher 21, which does not form part of the present invention, assembled in a carton 10. The pusher 21 is in the form of a first, rigid, member 53 which sits in the carton 10 behind the goods to be dispensed (not shown). The rigid member 53 may be a plate-like member (i.e. it does not have a substantial thickness), or another shape with a flat front surface forming a vertical abutment surface. Alternatively it may have a non-flat front surface. If the rigid member 53 is plate-like then it may have a horizontal stabilising element at its base (not shown). The rigid member 53 is connected to the front wall 14 of the carton 10 by a second, resilient, member 30 such that the resilient member 30 urges the rigid member 53 towards the front wall 14 of the carton 10. The resilient member 30 may be secured to the rigid member 53 and the front wall 14 via apertures 42. For example, the resilient member 30 may be an elastic band which is secured to the rigid member 53 and the front wall 14 by tying it through the apertures 42. Alternative means of securing the resilient member 30 would be obvious to the skilled person. A channel 54 may be provided in the base 11 to receive the resilient member 30 and ensure that the base 11 provides a substantially flat surface for the goods (not shown). In use, the rigid member 53 is pushed to the back of the carton 10 and goods are packed into the carton 10 between the rigid member 53 and the front wall 14 (not shown). As goods are removed from the carton 10, the resilient member 30 pulls the rigid member 53 forwards, which causes the rigid member 53 to push the remaining goods towards the front of the carton 10. Figure 19 illustrates a ninth embodiment of a pusher 21, which does not form part of the present invention. The pusher 21 is formed from an extendable member 22 and a resilient member 30. The extendable member 22 comprises an element 20 which is in the form of an elongate, generally rectangular strip. The element 20 is folded into a loop having legs 62. The resilient member 30 is arranged around the extendable member 22 so as to cause the legs 62 to extend, thereby elongating the extendable member 22. Figure 20 illustrates a tenth embodiment of a pusher 21, which does not form part of the present invention. The pusher 21 is formed from a resilient ring 70 which is twisted to form a figure of eight, thereby introducing some biasing into the ring structure. The crossover point 71 at the centre of the figure of eight, resulting from twisting the resilient member 70, may be secured by a tethering member 51 (not shown). The figure of eight has a pushing surface 72 at each end. In use, the twisted pusher 21 is inserted into a carton 10 adjacent the rear wall 14 behind the goods (not shown). The pusher 21 is arranged in the carton 10 such that one pushing surface 72 abuts the rear wall and the other pushing surface 72 abuts the goods, in the direction of the front wall 15. The pusher 21 is compressed by the goods in a first direction 60 against the force of the bias introduced by the twist in the resilient ring 70. As goods are removed from the carton 10, the force exerted on the pusher 21 by the goods reduces, and thus the bias in the resilient ring 70 causes it to extend in the first direction 60 and thereby push the goods forward within the carton 10. As will be perceived by the skilled person, the dimensions of the elements 20,40,41 and resulting pushers 21 will depend on the dimensions of the carton 10 into which the pusher 21 is to be fitted. Additionally, the ratios of the various sections A,B,C,D,E,F,G of the elements 20,40,41 of the different pusher 21 embodiments may be altered by the skilled person. Similarly, the specific pattern and positioning of fold lines 25,26 of the embodiments of the pusher 21 formed from the foldable elements 20,40,41 may be varied. The dimensions of the carton 10 may also determine which pusher 21 embodiment is most suited to the carton. 1.
