TECHNICAL FIELD The invention relates to the field of bioengineering; more particularly, the invention relates to a method for eliminating the dependence on methanol as the single carbon source of a methanol inducible promoter for driving the expression of an exogenous polypeptide. TECHNICAL BACKGROUND Methylotrophic yeast (including Pichia, Hansenula, Candida, Torulopsis et al.) expression systems have been wildly used in industrial production and pharmacy for their efficient ability of expressing an exogenous polypeptide. It is characterized that these systems have promoters (AOX1 promoter, DHAS promoter, FDH promoter, MOX promoter, AOX2 promoter, ZZA1, PEX5-, PEX8-, PEX14-promoter et al.) which can be induced efficiently by methanol, and these promoters depend on methanol strictly while other carbon sources such as glucose, glycerol et al. will suppress the expression of these promoters. With the outbreak of the oil crisis, the cost of producing simple-cell proteins with methanol increases. So many exogenous polypeptides are expressed with methylotrophic yeast expression systems for their incomparable advantages over other expression systems as follows: simple genetic manipulation, high expression of an exogenous polypeptide, with intracellular or secretory expression; the inheritance of an exogenous polypeptide is stable; as an eukaryotic expression system, having subcellular structures of eukaryotes, having the function of post-translational modification such as glycosylation, fatty acylation and protein phosphorylation. As the usage scope increases, there are many problems occurring during the actual fermentation scale-up: (1) the promoter used in the expression needs to be induced by methanol, and special explosion-proof design is necessary in large scale industrial fermentation for methanol is toxic and inflammable; (2) methanol fermentation consumes large amount of oxygen, and it is difficult to meet the need for oxygen by just increasing air ventilation volume and raising rotation rate, so the pure oxygen is necessary, the oxygen desired in methanol metabolism is 3 to 4 times the amount of oxygen desired wherein glucose is the carbon source. The more methanol is consumed, the more pure oxygen is desired which bring about a great trouble to the actual industrialization. Furthermore, the more methanol is consumed, the more heat is produced which increases requirement of the cooling ability of the instrument; (3) methanol is a petrochemical product which is not suitable for some food additives production; (4) methanol metabolism will produce H2O2, which leads to the hydrolysis of the expressed polypeptides. Therefore, if a method for expressing by a methanol inducible promoter without methanol so that the efficient transcription of a methanol inducible promoter will not depend on methanol and other carbon sources can be used to induce the expression of the promoter is obtained, it will be a positive significance for expressing exogenous polypeptides efficiently without methanol.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS In order to overcome the limitation of the dependence on a methanol inducible promoter on methanol in fermentation, after thorough study, the inventor discloses a method for eliminating the dependence on methanol as the single carbon source of methanol inducible promoter by increasing the intracellular expression of Mit1 (Methanol Induced Transcription Factor 1) polypeptide in the methylotrophic yeast to activate the expression of the promoter induced by the single carbon source of methanol in the methanol metabolism, so that the promoter can also express exogenous polypeptides without methanol. TERMS As used herein, a “promoter” refers to a nucleic acid sequence generally present in the upstream (5′) of the encoding sequence of target gene, which can direct the transcription of nucleic acid sequence into mRNA. Generally, a promoter or a promoter region provides recognition sites for RNA polymerase and other factors desired for correctly starting transcription. The promoter or promoter region comprises its active variants; such variants can be naturally occurring allelic variants or non-naturally occurring variants. Said variants include substitution variants, deletion variants and insertion variants. As used herein, the “methanol inducible promoter” is the promoter of an enzyme associated with methanol metabolism. In the prior art, these promoters can regulate the expression of exogenous polypeptides by adding methanol to the growth culture medium. Said “methanol inducible promoter” can be separated from yeasts by those skilled in the art with common methods. As used herein, the “induced with methanol as the single carbon source” means that a promoter is induced with methanol as the single carbon source to drive the expression of a gene which is operably linked to the promoter, and cannot drive the expression of a gene which is operably linked to the promoter under the condition wherein methanol is not the only carbon source (such as methanol+glucose). The “eliminating the dependence on methanol as the single carbon source” means that a promoter can drive the expression of a gene which is operably linked to it under the condition wherein methanol is not the only carbon source (such as methanol+glucose, or glucose, or glycerol). The “induced with methanol not as the single carbon source” means that a promoter is induced with at least one carbon source other than the carbon source of methanol. As used herein, the “constitutive promoter” refers to a class of promoters wherein there is no significant difference in the expression of genes in different tissues or organs and development phases under the regulation thereof. As used herein, the “inducible promoter” can induce rapidly the “open” and “close” or “high” and “low” of the gene transcription according to the certain cell growth phases or certain growth environment. Based on the sources, the inducible promoters can be divided into naturally occurring promoters and artificial promoters. As used herein, the “tissue or organ specific promoter” refers to a promoter, wherein the gene transcription which only occurs in certain tissues or organs. As used herein, “exogenous” or “heterologous” refers to the relationship between two or more nucleotide or protein sequences from different sources. For example, if a promoter and a target gene are not naturally linked, the promoter is exogenous to the target gene. When certain sequence is inserted to a cell or organism, said sequence is “exogenous” to said cell or organism. As used herein, the “expression cassette” refers to a gene expression system comprising all the necessary elements desired for the expression of target polypeptides (such as exogenous polypeptides or Mit1 polypeptide herein), and the system generally comprises the following elements: a promoter, a gene sequence encoding a polypeptide, a terminator; furthermore, the system may optionally comprise a signal peptide encoding sequence and the like. These elements are operably linked. As used herein, the “methylotrophic yeast” refers to yeast which can use methanol as the only carbon source, including a yeast from Hansenula, Pichia, Torulopsis, Candida, et al. As used herein, the “operably link” refers to the functional spatial arrangement of two or more nucleic acid regions or nucleic acid sequences. For example, the promoter is arranged in the special position relative to the nucleic acid sequence of the target gene, so that the transcription of the nucleic acid sequence is directed by the promoter region and thereby the promoter region is “operably linked” to the nucleic acid sequence. As used herein, term “strict condition” refers to: (1) hybridizing and eluting at lower ion strength and higher temperature, such as 0.2×SSC, 0.1% SDS, 60° C.; or (2) adding denaturant during hybridizing, such as 50% (v/v) formamide, 0.1% calf serum/0.1% Ficoll, 42° C. and the like; or (3) the hybridization will not occur unless the identity between two sequence is at least more than 50%, preferably more than 55%, more than 60%, more than 65%, more than 70%, more than 75%, more than 80%, more than 85% or more than 90%, more preferably more than 95%.

Mit1 Polypeptide The present invention discloses use of a Mit1 polypeptide in eliminating the dependence on methanol as the single carbon source of a methanol inducible promoter for driving the expression of an exogenous polypeptide with said promoter. In the study of the promoters which drive the expression of exogenous polypeptides by methanol (methanol inducible promoters), the inventor has unexpectedly found that the Mit1 polypeptide can eliminate the dependence on methanol as the single carbon source of a methanol inducible promoter so that the promoter can express an exogenous polypeptide with methanol as the non-single carbon source or with a carbon sources other than methanol. The present invention further comprises the fragments, derivatives and analogs of the Mit1 polypeptide. As used herein, terms “fragment”, “derivative” and “analog” refer to a polypeptide which keeps the same biological function or activity as the MIT1 polypeptide. The polypeptide fragments, derivatives or analogs of the invention can be (i) a polypeptide with one or more conservative or non-conservative amino acid residues (preferably conservative amino acid residues) substituted, and such amino acid residue substitution may not be encoded by genetic code, or (ii) a polypeptide in which one or more amino acid residues have a substituent group, or (iii) a polypeptide formed by fusing mature polypeptide with another compound (for example, a compound prolonging the half-life of the polypeptide, e.g. polyethylene glycol), or (iv) a polypeptide with additional amino acid sequence fused therein (such as leader sequence, or secreting sequence, or a sequence used to purify the polypeptide, or a polypeptide original sequence, or a fused polypeptide). According to the definition herein, these fragments, derivatives and analogs are known to a person skilled in the art. As used herein, term “Mit1” refers to a polypeptide as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 2 which has the function of inducing a methanol inducible promoter to drive the expression of an exogenous polypeptide with a carbon source other than methanol. Such term further comprises the variants of SEQ ID NO: 2 which have the function of inducing a methanol inducible promoter to drive the expression of an exogenous polypeptide with a carbon source other than methanol. These variants include but not limited to: deletion, insertion and/or substitution of a plurality of (generally 1-50, preferably 1-30, more preferably 1-20, most preferably 1-10, further more preferably 1-8 or 1-5) amino acids, and addition or deletion of one or more (generally within 20, preferably within 10, more preferably within 5) amino acids at the C-terminus and/or N-terminus. For example, in the art, when the substitution is carried out by amino acids with similar properties, or similar amino acids, the function of the protein is usually not changed. As another example, adding or deleting one or more amino acids at the C-terminus and/or N-terminus usually does not change the function of the protein. Variant forms of polypeptides include: homologous sequences, conservative variants, allelic variants, natural mutants, induced mutants, the protein encoded by DNA which can hybridize with DNA of Mit1 protein under high or low stringency conditions, as well as the polypeptide or protein obtained by utilizing anti-serum of Mit1 protein. The present invention also provides other polypeptides, such as the fusion protein containing Mit1 protein or fragment thereof. The present invention further provides Mit1 polypeptides or polypeptide analogs. The difference between these analogs and natural Mit1 protein can be a difference in amino acid sequence, also can be a difference not affecting modified forms of the sequence, or both. These polypeptides comprise natural or induced genetic variants. Induced variants can be obtained by various methods, such as by radiation or being exposed in mutagen to achieve random mutagenesis, or by site-directed mutagenesis or other known molecular biological methods. Analogs further comprise analogs with residues other than natural L-amino acids (such as D-amino acid), and analogs with non-naturally occurring or artificial amino acids (such as β, γ-amino acid). It should be understood that the polypeptides of the invention are not limited to the representative polypeptides above. The present invention further provides the polynucleotide sequences encoding a Mit1 polypeptide or the conservative variant polypeptides thereof. The polynucleotides of the invention can be in the form of DNA or RNA. The DNA includes cDNA, genomic DNA or artificial DNA. The DNA can be single chain or double chain. The DNA can be the coding strand or the non-coding strand. The encoding region sequence of mature polypeptides can be the same sequence or degeneration variants of SEQ ID NO: 1. As used herein, As used therein, “a degeneration variant” refers to a nucleic acid molecule that encodes a protein having the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2 with a nucleotide sequence different from the coding sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 1. The present invention also relates to variants of above-mentioned polynucleotides which encode polypeptides or polypeptide fragments, analogs and derivatives having the same amino acid sequences as the present invention. These polynucleotide variants can be naturally occurring allelic variants or non-naturally occurring variants. These nucleotide variants include substitution variants, deletion variants, and insertion variants. As known in the art, allelic variant is an alternate form of polynucleotide, it may be one or more nucleotide substitutions, deletions or insertions, but will not substantially alter its polypeptide-encoding function. The present invention further relates to polynucleotides which are homologous with the polynucleotides above, they have at least 50%, preferably at least 60%, more preferably at least 70%, more preferably at least 80%, more preferably at least 90%, more preferably at least 95%, even more preferably at least 98% or 99% identity to the polynucleotides above. The proteins encoded by these polynucleotides also have the same function with the proteins encoded by the above polypeptides to induce a methanol inducible promoter to drive the expression of exogenous polypeptides. The present invention further relates to a polynucleotide which hybridizes with the above sequence and the identity between the two sequences is at least 50%, preferably at least 70%, more preferably at least 80%. The invention particularly directs to a polynucleotide which hybridizes with the polynucleotide of the invention under strict conditions. The full-length sequence of Mit1 polypeptide of the present invention or fragments thereof can usually be obtained by PCR amplication method, recombinant method or artificial synthesis. As to PCR amplification method, the sequences of interests can be amplified by designing primers according to the related nucleotide sequence disclosed in the present invention, especially the open-reading frame, and using a commercially available cDNA library or a cDNA library prepared according to any of the conventional methods known in the art as a template. For an excessively long sequence, typically, two or more PCR amplications are needed, and then, the fragments obtained in the amplifications are ligated together in a correct orientation. In the present invention, the polynucleotide sequence encoding Mid polypeptide can be inserted into a recombinant expression vector. The term “recombinant expression vector” refers to bacterial plasmid, bacteriophage, yeast plasmid, plant cell virus, mammalian cell virus, or other vectors. In short, any plasmid and vector may be used as long as it can be replicated and stable in the host. An important feature of the expression vector is typically containing an origin of replication, promoter, marker gene and translation control elements. The common methods in the art can be used to construct an expression vector containing a Mit1 polypeptide encoding DNA sequence and a suitable transcription/translation regulatory signal. Such methods include DNA recombination in vitro, DNA synthesis, recombination technique in vivo and the like. Said DNA sequences can be effectively connected to the appropriate promoter in the expression vector to direct DNA synthesis. An expression vector can further comprise a ribosome binding site used in translation initiation and a transcription terminator. Furthermore, an expression vector preferably contains one or more marker gene to provide transformed host cells phenotypic traits for selection, such as dihyrofolate reductase, neomycin resistance and green fluorescent protein (GFP) in the eucaryote cell culture. A vector containing appropriate DNA sequence and promoter or regulatory sequence above can be used to transform host cells for the expression of proteins. The methods for increasing the expression of Mit1 polypeptide is known in the art. For example, an expression construct carrying Mit1 polypeptide encoding gene can be transformed into yeast cells to make them express Mit1 polypeptide; or the expression of Mit1 polypeptide can be increased by using a strong promoter; or the expression of Mit1 polypeptide can be increased by using an enhancer. Methanol Inducible Promoter In the common methods, the expression of exogenous polypeptides driven by the methanol inducible promoter is dependent on adding methanol to the culture medium. However, the inventor discloses a method for eliminating the dependence on methanol of a methanol inducible promoter. Those skilled in the art are familiar with a methanol inducible promoter which can be separated from yeast by common methods. As methanol inducible promoters have essentially same work mechanism and principle, there is no particular limit to the kinds of methanol inducible promoters. For example, the methanol inducible promoters include but not limited to: AOX1 promoter, DHAS promoter (or DAS promoter), FDH promoter (or FMDH promoter), MOX promoter, AOX2 promoter, ZZA1, PEX5-, PEX8-, PEX14-promoter, PMP20 promoter, PMP47 promoter, AOD1 promoter, AOD2 promoter. The invention further comprises a promoter with an identity of at least 70%, preferably at least 80% (e.g. 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99%) to the nucleotide sequence of the above promoters. These promoters are strictly conservative in the essential sites for transcription initiation and transcription start sites. The invention particularly relates to a polynucleotide which can hybridize with the nucleotide sequence of the methanol inducible promoter of the invention under strict conditions, and such polynucleotide also has the function with a wild methanol inducible promoter. Method for Eliminating Dependence on Methanol as the Single Carbon Source of a Methanol Inducible Promoter for Driving the Expression of an Exogenous Polypeptide Encoding Gene The invention further provides a method for eliminating dependence on methanol as the single carbon source of a methanol inducible promoter for driving the expression of an exogenous polypeptide encoding gene, comprising: (1) Providing a methylotrophic yeast, the methylotrophic yeast comprises: Expression cassette 1, which expresses an exogenous Mit1 polypeptide; and expression cassette 2, which comprises a methanol inducible promoter and an exogenous polypeptide encoding gene which is operably linked to the promoter; (2) Culturing the methylotrophic yeast in (1) under the conditions wherein there is no methanol or methanol is not the only carbon source. The expression cassette 1 and expression cassette 2 can be present in the same expression vector or different expression vectors. The expression cassette 1 can be included in the methylotrophic yeast as single copy or multiple copies, for example, 1 to 20 copies, such as 15, 10, 8, 6, 5, 3, 2 copies. The expression cassette 2 can be included in the methylotrophic yeast as single copy or multiple copies, for example, 1 to 20 copies, such as 15, 10, 8, 6, 5, 3, 2 copies. In the expression cassette 2, a promoter and a Mit1 polypeptide encoding gene which is operably linked to the promoter is included. It should be understood that any promoter which allows the recombinant expression of a Mit1 polypeptide in a methylotrophic yeast can be used in the invention. It is not limited to a constitutive promoter, an inducible promoter or a specific promoter. Those skilled in the art may make suitable selection according to the desired purpose, for example, an inducible promoter can be selected to regulate the expression of Mit1 polypeptide under some conditions. Preferably, in expression cassette 2, the promoter comprises: GAP promoter, PGK1 promoter, MIT1 promoter and any promoter which allows the overexpression of MIT1. In step (2), “conditions wherein there is no methanol” is easy for those skilled in the art to establish, i.e. it is common knowledge for those skilled in the art to add other kinds of carbon sources other than methanol in the common methylotrophic yeast medium, for example, such carbon sources are not limited to: glycerol, glucose, starch (including starch hydrolysate, tapioca starch, corn starch, cellulose hydrolysate, et al.), sucrose, maltose and the like. Preferably, glycerol and/or glucose are used as the carbon source of yeast culture medium. Similarly, “conditions wherein methanol is not the only carbon source” is also easy for those skilled in the art to establish. Recombinant Methylotrophic Yeast Based on the novel findings of the invention, a recombinant methylotrophic yeast is provided, the methylotrophic yeast comprises: expression cassette 1, which can express an exogenous Mit1 polypeptide; and expression cassette 2, which comprises a methanol inducible promoter and an exogenous polypeptide encoding gene which is operably linked to the promoter. Additionally, the expression cassette 1 and expression cassette 2 can be in the same expression vector or different expression vectors. Any methylotrophic yeast can be used in the invention to construct the recombinant methylotrophic yeast above. For example, the methylotrophic yeast includes but not limited to: Pichia, Hansenula, Candida, Torulopsis; preferably, the Pichia comprises: GS115, the Pichia wherein the MIG1 gene and MIG2 gene unexpressed (Δmig1Δmig2), the Pichia wherein the NRG1 gene, MIG1 gene and MIG2 gene unexpressed (Δmig1Δmig2Δnrg1), or the Pichia wherein the gene HXS1 unexpressed. According to the embodiments of the invention, four strains which can induce AOX1 promoter to express an exogenous polypeptide with a carbon source other than methanol are provided, they are GS115-MIT1, Δmig1Δmig2-MIT1, Δhxs1-MIT1 and Δmig1Δmig2Δnrg1-MIT1. Transcription Factor MIT1 is overexpressed in Pichia wild strain GS115, Pichia double deleted strain Δmig1Δmig2, Pichia deleted strain Δhxs1 and Pichia triple deleted strain Δmig1Δmig2Δnrg1 respectively to construct gene overexpression strain GS115-MIT1, Δmig1Δmig2-MIT1, Δmig1Δmig2Δnrg1-MIT1 and Δhxs1-MIT1. After Aox1 enzyme activity assay, it is found that glycerol can induce the expression of the AOX1 promoter of GS115-MIT1, glycerol or glucose both can induce the expression of the AOX1 promoter of Δmig1Δmig2-MIT1, Δhxs1-MIT1 and Δmig1Δmig2Δnrg1-MIT1. When the promoter is AOX1, the induced expression amount of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) is detected by flow cytometry. Among the Δhxs1 strains, an encoding region of HXS1 (GenBank accession number: 8197942) is deleted which is highly similar with Saccharomyces cerevisiae hexose inductor Snf3/Rgt2.
