Technical Field The present disclosure relates to a membrane reactor for electrochemically convert carbon dioxide. 2. Description of Related Art Carbon dioxide (CO2) is considered as the main anthropogenic cause of climate change, such as the greenhouse effect. Converting CO2 to useful industrial chemicals containing carbon or fuels is a proper way for realizing a sustainable development of energy and environment. Ways of converting CO2 includes chemical conversion, biochemical conversion, photochemical reduction, electrochemical reduction, and inorganic transformation.

Referring to FIGS. 1-3, one embodiment of a membrane reactor 10 or 100, used for electrochemical reduction of a CO2 gas, includes a cavity 20, a power source 30 or 300, a solid electrolyte separator 260, a cathode 220, and an anode 240. The solid electrolyte separator 260 is disposed in the cavity 20. The cavity 20 is divided into two chambers by the solid electrolyte separator 260 which are defined as a cathode chamber 22 and an anode chamber 24. The cathode 220 is disposed in the cathode chamber 22. The anode 240 is disposed in the anode chamber 24. The cathode 220 and the anode 240 are separated by the solid electrolyte separator 260. The power source 30 or 300 is disposed outside the cavity 20. The power source 30 or 300 has a positive electrode 302 and a negative electrode 304. The positive electrode 302 of the power source 30 or 300 is electrically connected with the cathode 240, and the negative electrode 304 is electrically connected with the anode 220. The cathode 240 is a trickle bed structure including a porous conductive layer 2202 and a plurality of cathode catalyst particles 2204 disposed on the porous conductive layer 2202. The plurality of cathode catalyst particles 2204 are used to electrochemically reduce the CO2 gas. The porous conductive layer 2202 is a support skeleton. A plurality of holes are defined in the support skeleton. A porosity of the porous conductive layer 2202 can be in a range from about 30% to about 90% to give the cathode 220 good mechanical strength and fast proton transfer rate during the electrochemical reduction of the CO2 gas. A diameter of the plurality of holes can be in a range from about 50 micrometers to about 2000 micrometers. The porous conductive layer 2202 has a certain thickness, which gives the cathode 220 a three-dimensional structure. The thickness of the porous conductive layer 2202 can be in a range from about 2 millimeters to about 30 millimeters. In one embodiment, the thickness of the porous conductive layer 2202 is in a range from about 2.1 millimeters to about 20 millimeters.

The extending directions of the plurality of holes can be substantially the same as the direction of the thickness of the porous conductive layer 2202, thus the through holes can be straight or curvy cylinders. In one embodiment, the through holes are all curvy cylinders to increase contact areas between the cathode catalyst particles 2204 and reactants in the cathode chamber 22. Accordingly, a catalytic efficiency of the cathode catalyst particles 2204 and conversion efficiency of the CO2 gas can be increased.

The cathode reaction products are flowed out along with the rest of the cathode electrolyte from the cathode outlet 224. The membrane reactor 10 or 100 further includes a cathode separating device 42 used for separating the cathode reaction products and the rest of the cathode electrolyte. There is no stirrer in the cathode chamber 22, and a flow rate of the cathode electrolyte is low, thus damage to the cathode catalyst particles 2204 can be decreased and a working life of the catalyst particles 2204 can be prolonged. The anode 240 can be a porous diffusion electrode including a porous diffusion layer 2402 and an anode catalyst layer 2404 disposed on a surface of the porous diffusion layer 2402. The anode catalyst layer 2404 is disposed between the porous diffusion layer 2402 and the solid electrolyte separator 260. A distance between the anode catalyst layer 2404 and the solid electrolyte separator 260 can be in a range from about 0 micrometers to about 10 micrometers. In one embodiment, the distance between the anode catalyst layer 2404 and the solid electrolyte separator 260 is about 0 micrometers which can increase a current efficiency of the membrane reactor 10 or 100. The porous diffusion layer 2402 can be made of a porous material resistant to corrosion. The porous material can be a porous carbon containing material or a porous metallic material. The porous carbon containing material can be carbon paper, carbon cloth, or carbon felt. The porous metallic material can be a mesh of stainless steel, titanium, or nickel.

A diameter of the pores of the porous diffusion layer 2402 can be in a range from about 1 micrometer to about 100 micrometers. In one embodiment, the diameter of the pores is in a range from about 10 micrometers to about 50 micrometers.

In one embodiment, the distance between the cathode 220 and the solid electrolyte separator 260 is about 1 centimeter. Certain amounts of cations can selectively pass the solid electrolyte separator 260 from the anode 240 to the cathode to balance a stoichiometric ratio of ions in the cathode 220 and the anode 240. The solid electrolyte separator 260 can be a cation exchange membrane. In one embodiment, the solid electrolyte separator 260 is an enhanced cation exchange membrane, such as enhanced perfluoro sulfonate membrane, enhanced perfluorocarboxylic acid membrane, or a composite membrane thereof. The enhanced cation exchange membrane has good strength and low swelling ratio which can prevent the solid electrolyte separator 260 from creep or being folded, bubbled, or delaminated during a working process of the membrane reactor 10 or 100. Therefore, a structural stability of the membrane reactor 10 or 100 can be increased. The enhanced cation exchange membrane can be fabricated by compositing a cation exchange membrane commonly used with an enhanced material, such as a polytetrafluoroethylene membrane composites with a porous membrane made by other materials. A thickness of the solid electrolyte separator 260 can be in a range from about 50 micrometers to about 500 micrometers. The power source 30 or 300 is used to provide an electrolytic voltage for the electrochemical reduction of the CO2 gas. Wind energy, photovoltaic energy, or electrochemical energy can be used as the power source 30 or 300. Referring to FIG. 2, the power source 300 of the membrane reactor 100 can further include a direct current power supply 32 and a charge power supply 34 electrically connected with the direct current power supply 32 in parallel.

If the cathode reaction products include a hydrogen gas, the membrane reactor 100 further includes a hydrogen deliver channel 52 connected between the fuel inlet 342 and the cathode separating device 42 to deliver the hydrogen gas to the fuel cell. If the anode reaction products include an oxygen gas, the membrane reactor 100 further includes an oxygen deliver channel 54 connected between the oxidant inlet 344 and the anode separating device 44 to deliver the oxygen gas to the fuel cell.

Referring to FIG. 1 to FIG. 4, one embodiment of a method for electrochemically converting the CO2 gas includes the following steps: S1, providing the membrane reactor 10 or 100; S2, concurrently feeding the cathode electrolyte and the CO2 gas into the cathode chamber 22 and flowing through the cathode catalyst particles 2204 in the trickle bed structure, and at the same time, continuously feeding the anode electrolyte and the anode active material into the anode chamber 24; and S3, applying the electrolytic voltage between the cathode 220 and the anode 240 to decompose the CO2 gas to form expected products. In step S2, the cathode electrolyte and the CO2 gas are concurrently flowed from bottom up through the cathode catalyst particles 2204 disposed in the porous conductive layer 2202. The cathode electrolyte and the CO2 gas are inputted from one end of the holes and flowed out from the other end of the holes and flows through the porous conductive layer 2202. More specifically, the cathode electrolyte as liquid drops is trickled through the cathode catalyst particles 2204 disposed inside the porous conductive layer 2202, and the CO2 gas is continuously passed through the cathode catalyst particles 2204 at the same time. The cathode electrolyte and the CO2 gas are mixed as a plug flow, and passed through the cathode particles 2204. The CO2 gas can be fed in the cathode chamber 22 after boosting so that the CO2 gas continuously can flow through the cathode catalyst particles 2204. A volume ratio of the cathode electrolyte and the CO2 gas can be in a range from about 1:4 to about 1:8. A pressure in the cathode chamber 22 can be in a range from about 0.5 atmospheres of pressure to about 8 atmospheres of pressure. In step S3, the electrolytic voltage can be in a range from about 2 V to about 5 V. In one embodiment, the electrolytic voltage is in a range from 2.8 V to about 3.5 V. After the electrolytic voltage is applied, an electrochemical oxidation reaction is continuously conducted, and an electrochemical reduction is continuously conducted to decompose the CO2 gas to form the expected products. The expected products can be useful organic substances. More specifically, in the cathode chamber 22, a three-phase reaction is conducted in the porous conductive layer 2202. The liquid cathode electrolyte and the CO2 gas are reacted under an action of the solid cathode catalyst particles 2204 to electrochemically reduce the CO2 gas. The cathode electrolyte trickled on the cathode 220 appears as a film and flows on the surface of the cathode catalyst particles 2204 to increase a contact area thereof. The electrochemical reduction reaction is effective and fast because of the large contact area of the cathode electrolyte and CO2 gas with the cathode catalyst particles 2204 which are disposed in a porous structure. In addition, because of the certain thickness of the porous conductive layer 2202, the cathode electrolyte and CO2 gas can continuously flow through the surface of the cathode catalyst particles 2204 with a high flux to increase the conversion efficiency of the electrochemical reduction. The direction of the thickness of the porous conductive layer 2202 is the same as a current direction of the corresponding electrolytic voltage. The cathode electrolyte includes a first solvent and a first solute dissolved in the first solvent. The first solute can be at least one of an alkali metal bicarbonate, alkali metal formate, ammonium bicarbonate, and ammonium formate. The alkali metal bicarbonate can be at least one of sodium bicarbonate, potassium bicarbonate, and a hydrate thereof. The alkali metal formate can be at least one of sodium formate, potassium formate, and a hydrate thereof. The first solvent can be water. Anions can be formed after the three-phase reaction in the cathode chamber 22 which is decided by the kind of the cathode electrolyte. In one embodiment, the anion anions are formate ions. In addition, a cathode side reaction occurs during the three-phase reaction and a cathode byproduct is formed. In one embodiment, the cathode byproduct is the hydrogen gas. The cathode side reaction can be represented by: 2H2O+2e−→H2+2OH−. A pH value of the cathode electrolyte can be large than or equal to 7. A reaction temperature in the cathode chamber 22 can be in a range from about 20° C. to about 90° C. In one embodiment, the reaction temperature in the cathode chamber 22 is about 50° C. In the anode chamber 24, the anode electrolyte and the anode active material are fed in the anode inlet 242, flowed to uniformly disperse the anode electrolyte and the anode active material, passed through the porous diffusion layer 2402, and electrochemically oxidized under the action of the anode catalyst layer 2404. The anode electrolyte includes a second solvent and a second solute dissolved in the second solvent. The second solvent can be water. The second solute can be an alkali metal hydroxide, alkali salt, ammonium salt, or an acid. In one embodiment, the second solute can be sodium hydroxide, sodium sulfate, ammonium sulfate, or sulfuric acid. The anode active material can be the same as the second solute. The electrochemical oxidation can form a plurality of residual cations decided by the kind of the anode active material, such as sodium cations, potassium cations, or ammonium cations. The residual cations can pass through the solid electrolyte separator 260 and neutralized with the anions to form the expected products, such as formate salts. Anode side reaction also occurs along with the electrochemical oxidation to form an anode by-product. In one embodiment, the anode by-product is oxygen gas. The anode side reaction can be represented as: 2OH−→½O2+2H2O+2e− or 2H2O→O2+2H++2e−. A reaction temperature in the anode chamber 24 can be in a range from about 20° C. to about 90° C. A concentration of the anode electrolyte can be in a range from about 0 wt % to about 10 wt %. The method further includes a step of separating the expected products, the cathode byproduct, and the unreacted cathode electrolyte from the cathode outlet 224. If the cathode byproduct is hydrogen gas, the hydrogen gas can be separated by a gas-liquid separator and collected. In addition, the separated cathode electrolyte can be fed back to the cathode inlet 222 for a recycling use. The method further includes separating the anode byproduct and unreacted anode electrolyte. If the anode byproduct is oxygen gas, the oxygen gas can be separated and collected, and the separated anode electrolyte can be fed back to the anode inlet 242 for a recycling use. If the cathode byproduct is the hydrogen gas and the anode byproduct is the oxygen gas, the hydrogen gas can act as the fuel and the oxygen gas can act as the oxidant fed to the fuel cell to generate power. Water, reacted by the hydrogen gas and the oxygen gas, can function as a solvent fed back to the cathode electrolyte or anode electrolyte for a recycling use. Therefore, an energy consumption of the membrane reactor 10 or 100 can be decreased and an energy recycling rate can be increased. A conversion efficiency of the membrane reactor 10 or 100 can reach above 80%. Example 1 In the cathode 220 of the membrane reactor 10 or 100, a porous titanium mesh with a thickness of about 10 millimeters and a porosity of about 60% is used as the porous conductive layer 2202.

A NaHCO3 water solution as the cathode electrolyte and the boosted CO2 gas are concurrently fed in the cathode inlet 222 and flowed through the porous titanium mesh with the Sn/Cu alloy particles deposited therein. The CO2 gas is electrochemically reduced and formate anions are formed in the cathode chamber 22 under the electrolytic voltage of about 3 V. At the same time, NaOH as the anode active material and NaOH water solution as the anode electrolyte are fed in the anode inlet 242, uniformly dispersed in the anode chamber 24, and passed through the carbon paper to the anode catalyst layer to be electrochemically oxidized. Unreacted Na+ ions are passed through the solid electrolyte separator 260 and combined with the formate anions to form sodium formate. The sodium formate as the expected product is separated and recycled. The hydrogen gas as the cathode byproduct and the oxygen gas as the anode byproduct are collected and fed back to the fuel cell to generate power for the membrane reactor 10. In addition, water as the reaction product of the hydrogen gas and the oxygen gas is fed back for the cathode electrolyte or the anode electrolyte as the solvent. The testing results show that a current efficiency of the membrane 10 reaches to about 85%, the conversion efficiency of the CO2 gas reaches to about 90%. In addition, the membrane reactor 10 can convert above 100 tons of the CO2 gas per day.
