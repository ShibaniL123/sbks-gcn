7-(2-Chloropyrimidin-4-yl)-3,4-dihydro-2H-[1,4]oxazepino[2,3,4-hi]indole
AlCl3 (3.7 g, 27.72 mmol) was dissolved in DME (20 mL) at 10 °C and 2,4-dichloropyrimidine (2.75 g, 18.48 mmol) was added to the mixture and stirred for 0.5 h. Embodiment E2 (1.6 g, 9.24 mmol) was slowly added in batches and the reaction mixture was warmed to 80 °C and stirred for 2 hours. TLC showed the reaction was complete, DCM (500 mL) was added to the reaction mixture. The organic layer was washed with saturated brine (200 mL × 2) and concentrated. The crude product was purified by column chromatography (PE: EA = 3: 1, DCM) to deliver the title compound (yellow solid, 1.3 g, yield 49.24%).
