Step 6: Preparation of 2-(3-(4-(3-amino-2-hydroxypheyl)-1H-pyrazole-1-yl)-1-(methylsulfonyl)azetidin-3-yl)acetonitrile
To 2-(3-(4-2-(benzyloxy)-3-nitrophenyl-1H-pyrazole-1-yl)-1-(methylsulfonyl) azetidin-3-yl)acetonitrile(400 mg,855.6 umol) in ethyl acetate (10 mL) was added Pd/C (200 mg, 1.9 mmol) under the protection of nitrogen. The mixture was stirred at 25Â°C for reacting for 1.5 hours. LC-MS detected and showed that the reaction was completed. The reaction mixture was filtered to remove Pd/C, then evaporated, and concentrated slightly to give 2-(3-(4-(3-amino-2-hydroxypheyl)-1H-pyrazole-1-yl)-1-(methylsulfonyl)azetidin-3-yl)acetonitrile(300 mg, 80.75%) as a pale yellow, which can be directly used in the next step without further purification.
