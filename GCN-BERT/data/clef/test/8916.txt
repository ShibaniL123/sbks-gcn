However, it was found that in the abovementioned compositions, there is the problem that during storage, zinc oxide and the silicon-bonded hydrogen atoms in the organopolysiloxane react, and the curability thereof decreases over time, and there is also the problem that the cured product thereof yellows due to thermal aging. Furthermore, in the abovementioned compositions it was found that there is the problem that discoloration of silver electrodes and silver plating of substrates by sulfur-containing gas in the air cannot be sufficiently suppressed.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIG. 1 is a cross-sectional drawing of an LED that is an example of an optical semiconductor device of the present invention. DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS [Curable Silicone Composition] First, the curable silicone composition of the present invention will be described in detail. Component (A) is an organopolysiloxane having at least two silicon-bonded alkenyl groups per molecule, and is a main component of the composition. Examples of the alkenyl groups in component (A) include alkenyl groups having from 2 to 12 carbons such as a vinyl group, allyl group, butenyl group, pentenyl group, hexenyl group, heptenyl group, octenyl group, nonenyl group, decenyl group, undecenyl group, and dodecenyl group, and a vinyl group is preferable. Examples of a group bonding to a silicon atom other than alkenyl groups in component (A) include alkyl groups having from 1 to 12 carbons such as a methyl group, ethyl group, propyl group, isopropyl group, butyl group, isobutyl group, tert-butyl group, pentyl group, neopentyl group, hexyl group, cyclohexyl group, heptyl group, octyl group, nonyl group, decyl group, undecyl group, and dodecyl group; aryl groups having from 6 to 20 carbons such as a phenyl group, tolyl group, xylyl group, and naphthyl group; aralkyl groups having from 7 to 20 carbons such as a benzyl group, phenethyl group, and phenylpropyl group; and groups in which some or all of the hydrogen atoms of these groups are substituted with halogen atoms such as fluorine atoms, chlorine atoms, or bromine atoms. The silicon atoms in component (A) may also have small quantities of hydroxyl groups or alkoxy groups such as methoxy groups and ethoxy groups within a range that does not impair the object of the present invention. No particular limitation is placed on the molecular structure of component (A), and this structure may be, for example, straight, partially branched straight, branched, cyclic, or three-dimensional net-like. Component (A) may be a single organopolysiloxane having these molecular structures or a mixture of two or more types of organopolysiloxane having these molecular structures. Such a component (A) is preferably an organopolysiloxane expressed by the average unit formula: [in-line-formulae](R1SiO3/2)a(R2R3SiO2/2)b(R4R5R6SiO1/2)c(SiO4/2)d [/in-line-formulae] In the formula, R1 to R6 are identical or different types of monovalent hydrocarbon group. Examples of the monovalent hydrocarbon groups of R1 to R6 include, similar to above, alkyl groups, alkenyl groups, aryl groups, aralkyl groups, and groups in which some or all of the hydrogen atoms of these groups are substituted with halogen atoms such as fluorine atoms, chlorine atoms, or bromine atoms. Furthermore, the content of alkenyl groups in component (A) is preferably from 0.01 to 50 mol % of the total monovalent hydrocarbon groups of R1 to R6, more preferably from 0.05 to 40 mol %, and particularly preferably from 0.09 to 32 mol %. This is because when the content of alkenyl groups in component (A) is too low, a cured product may not be obtained, and when the content of alkenyl groups in component (A) is too high, mechanical properties of the obtained cured product may be deteriorated. Moreover, the alkenyl groups in component (A) are preferably at both terminals of the organopolysiloxane molecule. The molar content (mol %) of the alkenyl group in the total monovalent hydrocarbon groups in component (A) can be measured by analytical methods exemplified by Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer (FT-IR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), gel permeation chromatography (GPC), and the like. Moreover, a, b, c, and d represent molar ratios of the respective siloxane units, and a+b+c+d=1.0, 0≦a≦1.0, 0≦b≦1.0, 0≦c<0.9, and0≦d<0.5. Component (A) is an organopolysiloxane that is a liquid or solid at 25° C. If component (A) is a liquid at 25° C., its viscosity at 25° C. is preferably in a range of from 1 to 1,000,000 mPa·s, and more preferably in a range of from 10 to 1,000,000 mPa·s. The viscosity of the organopolysiloxane at 25° C. may be determined based on JIS K 7117-1 using a B type viscometer, for example. Component (B) is an organopolysiloxane having at least two silicon-bonded hydrogen atoms per molecule, and is a crosslinking agent of the composition. Examples of a group bonding to a silicon atom other than a hydrogen atom in component (B) include alkyl groups having from 1 to 12 carbons such as a methyl group, ethyl group, propyl group, isopropyl group, butyl group, isobutyl group, tert-butyl group, pentyl group, neopentyl group, hexyl group, cyclohexyl group, heptyl group, octyl group, nonyl group, decyl group, undecyl group, and dodecyl group; aryl groups having from 6 to 20 carbons such as a phenyl group, tolyl group, xylyl group, and naphthyl group; aralkyl groups having from 7 to 20 carbons such as a benzyl group, phenethyl group, and phenyl propyl group; and groups in which some or all of the hydrogen atoms of these groups are substituted with halogen atoms such as fluorine atoms, chlorine atoms, or bromine atoms. The silicon atoms in component (B) may also have small quantities of hydroxyl groups or alkoxy groups such as methoxy groups and ethoxy groups within a range that does not impair the object of the present invention. No particular limitation is placed on the molecular structure of component (B), and this structure may be straight, partially branched straight, branched, cyclic, or three-dimensional net-like. The molecular structure of component (B) is preferably partially branched straight, branched, or three-dimensional net-like. Such a component (B) is preferably an organopolysiloxane expressed by, for example, the average composition formula: [in-line-formulae]R7eHfSiO[(4-e-f)/2][/in-line-formulae] In the formula, R7 is an optionally substituted monovalent hydrocarbon group excluding aliphatic unsaturated hydrocarbon groups, examples of which include, similar to above, alkyl groups, aryl groups, aralkyl groups, and groups in which some or all of the hydrogen atoms of these groups are substituted with halogen atoms such as fluorine atoms, chlorine atoms, or bromine atoms. Moreover, in the formula, e and f have values so as to satisfy the following formulae: 1.0<e≦2.0, 0.1<f<1.0, and 1.5≦e+f<2.7. Component (B) is a liquid or solid at 25° C. If component (B) is a liquid at 25° C., the viscosity of the liquid at 25° C. is preferably not greater than 10,000 mPa·s, more preferably in a range of from 0.1 to 5,000 mPa·s, and particularly preferably is in a range of from 0.5 to 1,000 mPa·s. The viscosity of the organopolysiloxane at 25° C. may be determined based on JIS K 7117-1 using a B type viscometer, for example. Component (B) is not particularly limited to a specific organopolysiloxane as long as the object of the present invention can be achieved. Examples of component (B) include one or more types selected from the group consisting of 1,1,3,3-tetramethyldisiloxane, 1,3,5,7-tetramethylcyclotetrasiloxane, tris(dimethylhydrogensiloxy)methylsilane, tris(dimethylhydrogensiloxy)phenylsilane, 1-glycidoxypropyl-1,3,5,7-tetramethylcyclotetrasiloxane, 1,5-glycidoxypropyl-1,3,5,7-tetramethylcyclotetrasiloxane, 1-glycidoxypropyl-5-trimethoxysilylethyl-1,3,5,7-tetramethylcyclotetrasiloxane, methylhydrogenpolysiloxane capped at both molecular terminals with trimethylsiloxy groups, copolymers of dimethylsiloxane and methylhydrogensiloxane capped at both molecular terminals with trimethylsiloxy groups, dimethylpolysiloxane capped at both molecular terminals with dimethylhydrogensiloxy groups, copolymers of dimethylsiloxane and methylhydrogensiloxane capped at both molecular terminals with dimethylhydrogensiloxy groups, copolymers of methylhydrogensiloxane and diphenylsiloxane capped at both molecular terminals with trimethylsiloxy groups, copolymers of methylhydrogensiloxane, diphenylsiloxane, and dimethylsiloxane capped at both molecular terminals with trimethylsiloxy groups, copolymers comprising (CH3)2HSiO1/2 units and SiO4/2 units, and copolymers comprising (CH3)2HSiO1/2 units and SiO4/2 units and (C6H5)SiO3/2 units. The content of component (B) is in an amount that a content of the silicon-bonded hydrogen atoms in this component is from 0.1 to 10 moles, and preferably from 0.5 to 5 moles, per 1 mole of the alkenyl groups in component (A). This is because when the content of component (B) is not greater than the upper limit of the range described above, decrease in mechanical properties of the obtained cured product can be suppressed, and, on the other hand, when the content of component (B) is not less than the lower limit of the range described above, the obtained composition can be sufficiently cured. The amount of the silicon-bonded hydrogen atoms in component (B) can be measured by analytical methods exemplified by Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer (FT-IR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), gel permeation chromatography (GPC), and the like. Component (C) is a characteristic component for sufficiently suppressing discoloration of silver electrodes and silver plating of substrates in the optical semiconductor device due to sulfur-containing gas in the air. Such a component (C) is at least one type of fine powder having mass-average particle diameter of from 0.1 nm to 5 μm, selected from the group consisting of zinc oxide fine powders surface-coated with an oxide and/or hydroxide of at least one element selected from the group consisting of Al, Ag, Cu, Fe, Sb, Si, Sn, Ti, Zr, and rare earth elements, zinc oxide fine powders surface-treated with an organosilicon compound not having an alkenyl group, and fine powders of hydrates of zinc carbonate. The mass-average particle diameter can be measured by laser diffraction/scattering or the like. “Mass-average particle diameter” pertaining to the present invention refers to the particle diameter when cumulative mass is 50% (D50), which is obtained by measuring particle diameter distribution. Examples of rare earth elements in the zinc oxide fine powder surface-coated with an oxide include yttrium, cerium, and europium. Examples of the oxide on the surface of the zinc oxide fine powder include Al2O3, AgO, Ag2O, Ag2O3, CuO, Cu2O, FeO, Fe2O3, Fe3O4, Sb2O3, SiO2, SnO2, Ti2O3, TiO2, Ti3O5, ZrO2, Y2O3, CeO2, Eu2O3, and mixtures of two or more of these oxides, as well as hydrates of oxides such as Al2O3.nH2O, Fe2O3.nH2O, Fe3O4.nH2O, Sb2O3.nH2O, SiO2.nH2O, TiO2.nH2O, ZrO2.nH2O, CeO2.nH2O, and the like. Among these, Al2O3, SiO2, and hydrates thereof are preferable. Note that n is normally a positive integer, but is not necessarily limited to an integer depending on the degree of dehydration. Examples of rare earth elements in the zinc oxide fine powder surface-coated with a hydroxide include yttrium, cerium, and europium. Examples of the hydroxide on the surface of the zinc oxide fine powder include Al(OH)3, Cu(OH)2, Fe(OH)3, Ti(OH)4, Zr(OH)3, Y(OH)3, Ce(OH)3, Ce(OH)4, and mixtures of two or more of these oxides, as well as hydrates of oxides such as Ce(OH)3.nH2O. Among these, Al(OH)3 is preferable. Note that n is normally a positive integer, but is not necessarily limited to an integer depending on the degree of dehydration. Furthermore, the abovementioned zinc oxide surface-coated with an oxide may be further surface-coated with the abovementioned hydroxides, and may also be surface-coated with oxides other than those mentioned above. Furthermore, the abovementioned zinc oxide surface-coated with a hydroxide may be further surface-coated with the abovementioned oxides, and may also be surface-coated with hydroxides other than those mentioned above. Component (C) may also be zinc oxide surface-coated with the abovementioned oxides and the abovementioned hydroxides. Examples of combinations of oxides and hydroxides include a combination of Al2O3 and Al(OH)3 and a combination of SiO2 and Al(OH)3. In the zinc oxide fine powder surface-treated with an organosilicon compound, the organosilicon compound does not have an alkenyl group, and examples include organosilanes, organosilazanes, polymethylsiloxanes, organohydrogenpolysiloxanes, and organosiloxane oligomers. Specific examples include organochlorosilanes such as trimethylchlorosilane, dimethylchlorosilane, and methyltrichlorosilane; organotrialkoxysilanes such as methyltrimethoxysilane, methyltriethoxysilane, phenyltrimethoxysilane, ethyltrimethoxysilane, and n-propyltrimethoxysilane; diorganodialkoxysilanes such as dimethyldimethoxysilane, dimethyldiethoxysilane, and diphenyldimethoxysilane; triorganoalkoxysilanes such as trimethylmethoxysilane and trimethylethoxysilane; partial condensates of these organoalkoxysilanes; organosilazanes such as hexamethyldisilazane; polymethylsiloxanes, organohydrogenpolysiloxanes, organosiloxane oligomers having a silanol group or an alkoxy group, and resin-like organopolysiloxanes consisting of an R8SiO3/2 unit (wherein R8 is a monovalent hydrocarbon group excluding alkenyl groups, examples of which include alkyl groups such as a methyl group, ethyl group, and propyl group; and aryl groups such as a phenyl group) or an SiO4/2 unit, and having a silanol group or an alkoxy group. The abovementioned zinc oxide fine powder may be further surface-treated with treatment agents other than those mentioned above. Examples of these treatment agents include higher fatty acids such as stearic acid or metal soaps thereof, higher fatty acid esters such as octyl palmitate; polyhydric alcohols such as trimethylolethane, trimethylolpropane, and pentaerythritol; and amine compounds such as diethanolamine and triethanolamine. Furthermore, as these treatment agents, coupling agents such as alkyl titanate, alkyl aluminate, and alkyl zirconate; and fluorine-based organic compounds such as perfluoroalkyl silanes and perfluoroalkyl phosphoric acid esters may be used. A fine powder of a hydrate of zinc carbonate is a compound in which water is bonded to zinc carbonate, and is preferably a compound in which the rate of mass decrease is not less than 0.1 mass % under heating conditions of 105° C. for 3 hours. The content of component (C) is an amount in a range of from 1 ppm to 10%, and preferably an amount in a range of from 1 ppm to 5%, of the composition in terms of mass units. This is because when the content of component (C) is not less than the lower limit of the range described above, discoloration of silver electrodes and silver plating of substrates in the optical semiconductor device due to sulfur-containing gas is sufficiently suppressed, and when the content is not greater than the upper limit of the range described above, the fluidity of the resulting composition is not diminished. Component (D) is a hydrosilylation reaction catalyst used to accelerate the hydrosilylation reaction of the present composition. Such a component (D) is preferably a platinum element catalyst or a platinum element compound catalyst, and examples thereof include platinum-based catalysts, rhodium-based catalysts, and palladium-based catalysts. Among such hydrosilylation reaction catalysts, platinum-based catalysts are preferable due to the ability to remarkably promote the hydrosilylation reaction between components (A) and (B). Examples of such platinum-based catalysts include platinum fine powders, platinum black, chloroplatinic acid, alcohol-modified products of chloroplatinic acid, complexes of chloroplatinic acid and diolefin, platinum-olefin complexes, platinum-carbonyl complexes such as platinum bis-(acetoacetate) and platinum bis-(acetylacetonate), chloroplatinic acid-alkenylsiloxane complexes such as chloroplatinic acid-divinyltetramethyldisiloxane complexes and chloroplatinic acid-tetravinyltetramethylcyclotetrasiloxane complexes, platinum-alkenylsiloxane complexes such as platinum-divinyltetramethyldisiloxane complexes and platinum-tetravinyltetramethylcyclotetrasiloxane complexes, and complexes of chloroplatinic acid and acetylene alcohols. Platinum-alkenylsiloxane complexes are particularly preferable due to their excellent effect of accelerating hydrosilylation reactions. One type of these hydrosilylation reaction catalysts may be used alone, or two or more types may be used in combination. The alkenylsiloxane used in the platinum-alkenylsiloxane complex is not particularly limited, and examples thereof include 1,3-divinyl-1,1,3,3-tetramethyldisiloxane, 1,3,5,7-tetramethyl-1,3,5,7-tetravinylcyclotetrasiloxane, alkenylsiloxane oligomers in which some of the methyl groups of these alkenylsiloxanes are substituted with ethyl groups, phenyl groups, or the like, and alkenylsiloxane oligomers in which the vinyl groups of these alkenylsiloxanes are substituted with allyl groups, hexenyl groups, or the like. In particular, 1,3-divinyl-1,1,3,3-tetramethyldisiloxane is preferable due to the favorable stability of the platinum-alkenylsiloxane complex that is produced. In order to improve the stability of the platinum-alkenylsiloxane complexes, it is preferable to dissolve these platinum-alkenylsiloxane complexes in an alkenylsiloxane oligomer such as 1,3-divinyl-1,1,3,3-tetramethyldisiloxane, 1,3-diallyl-1,1,3,3-tetramethyldisiloxane, 1,3-divinyl-1,3-dimethyl-1,3-diphenyldisiloxane, 1,3-divinyl-1,1,3,3-tetraphenyldisiloxane, or 1,3,5,7-tetramethyl-1,3,5,7-tetravinylcyclotetrasiloxane or an organosiloxane oligomer such as a dimethylsiloxane oligomer, and it is particularly preferable to dissolve the complexes in an alkenylsiloxane oligomer. The content of component (D) is a quantity effective in promoting curing of the composition. Specifically, the content is preferably an amount such that the catalyst metal atoms in component (D) are within the range of from 0.01 to 500 ppm in terms of mass units of the composition, more preferably within the range of from 0.01 to 100 ppm, and particularly preferably within the range of from 0.1 to 50 ppm. This is because when the content of component (D) is not less than the lower limit of the range described above, the obtained composition can be sufficiently cured, and, on the other hand, when the content of component (D) is not greater than the upper limit of the range described above, coloration of the obtained cured product can be suppressed. The composition may also contain (E) a hydrosilylation reaction inhibitor as an optional component for extending working life at room temperature and improving storage stability. Examples of component (E) include alkyne alcohols such as 1-ethynylcyclohexan-1-ol, 2-methyl-3-butyn-2-ol, 3,5-dimethyl-1-hexyn-3-ol, and 2-phenyl-3-butyn-2-ol; enyne compounds such as 3-methyl-3-penten-1-yne and 3,5-dimethyl-3-hexen-1-yne; methylalkenylsiloxane oligomers such as 1,3,5,7-tetramethyl-1,3,5,7-tetravinylcyclotetrasiloxane and 1,3,5,7-tetramethyl-1,3,5,7-tetrahexenylcyclotetrasiloxane; alkynoxysilanes such as dimethyl bis(3-methyl-1-butyn-3-oxy)silane and methylvinyl bis(3-methyl-1-butyn-3-oxy)silane, and triallylisocyanurate compounds. The content of component (E) is not particularly limited but is an amount sufficient to suppress gelling or to suppress curing at the time of the mixing of components (A) to (D) and is an amount sufficient to enable long-term storage. Specifically, the content of component (E) is preferably in a range of from 0.0001 to 5 parts by mass, and more preferably in a range of from 0.01 to 3 parts by mass, per 100 parts total mass of components (A) to (D).

The content of component (F) is not particularly limited, but is in a range of from 0.000001 to 3 parts by mass, and preferably in a range of from 0.00001 to 1 parts by mass, per 100 parts by mass of components (A) to (D). The present composition may also contain an adhesion promoter in order to further improve adhesion to a substrate with which the composition makes contact during curing. Such an adhesion promoter is preferably an organosilicon compound having one or more silicon-bonded alkoxy groups per molecule. Examples of the alkoxy groups include methoxy groups, ethoxy groups, propoxy groups, butoxy groups, and methoxyethoxy groups, and methoxy groups or ethoxy groups are particularly preferable. Examples of groups other than alkoxy groups bonding to the silicon atoms of this organosilicon compound include substituted or unsubstituted monovalent hydrocarbon groups such as alkyl groups, alkenyl groups, aryl groups, aralkyl groups, and halogenated alkyl groups; epoxy group-containing monovalent organic groups such as 3-glycidoxypropyl groups, 4-glycidoxybutyl groups, or similar glycidoxyalkyl groups; 2-(3,4-epoxycyclohexyl)ethyl groups, 3-(3,4-epoxycyclohexyl)propyl groups, or similar epoxycyclohexylalkyl groups; and 4-oxiranylbutyl groups, 8-oxiranyloctyl groups, or similar oxiranylalkyl groups; acrylic group-containing monovalent organic groups such as 3-methacryloxypropyl groups; isocyanate groups; isocyanurate groups; and hydrogen atoms.

This composition may also contain a fluorescent substance as an optional component. This fluorescent substance is exemplified by substances widely used in light emitting diodes (LEDs), such as yellow, red, green, and blue light-emitting fluorescent substances such as oxide fluorescent substances, oxynitride fluorescent substances, nitride fluorescent substances, sulfide fluorescent substances, oxysulfide fluorescent substances, and the like.

Although the curing of the present composition progresses when left to stand at room temperature or when heated, it is preferable to heat a composition in order to cure the composition quickly. The heating temperature is preferably in a range of from 50 to 200° C. The present composition preferably forms a cured product with a type A durometer hardness as prescribed in JIS K 6253 from 30 to 99 and particularly preferably from 35 to 95 when cured.

[Optical Semiconductor Device] The optical semiconductor device of the present invention will now be described in detail. The optical semiconductor device of the present invention is characterized in that an optical semiconductor element is sealed, covered, or adhered by the composition described above. Specific examples of the optical semiconductor element include light-emitting diodes (LEDs), semiconductor lasers, photodiodes, phototransistors, solid-state image sensing devices, and light emitters and receivers for photocoupler, and the optical semiconductor element is preferably a light-emitting diode (LED). Since light emission occurs from the top, bottom, left, and right sides of the semiconductor in a light-emitting diode (LED), it is not preferable for the parts constituting the light-emitting diode (LED) to absorb light, and a material with high optical transmittance or high reflectivity is preferable. Therefore, it is also preferable for the substrate on which the optical semiconductor element is mounted to be a material with high optical transmittance or high reflectivity. The board upon which this optical semiconductor element is mounted is exemplified by electrically conductive metals such as silver, gold, copper, or the like; non-electrically conductive metals such as aluminum, nickel, or the like; thermoplastic resins such as PPA, LCP, or the like intermixed with white pigments; thermoplastic resins such as epoxy resins, BT resins, polyimide resins, silicone resins, or the like including white pigment; ceramics such as alumina, aluminum nitride, or the like; or the like. The curable silicone composition has favorable thermal shock resistance with respect to the optical semiconductor element and the substrate, and the resulting optical semiconductor device can demonstrate good reliability. FIG. 1 shows a cross-sectional drawing of a surface mounted type LED, which is one example of the optical semiconductor device of the present invention. In the LED illustrated in FIG. 1, an optical semiconductor element 1 is die-bonded to a lead frame 2, and the optical semiconductor element 1 and a lead frame 3 are wire-bonded by a bonding wire 4. A light reflection material 5 is formed on the periphery of this optical semiconductor element 1, and the optical semiconductor element 1 inside the light reflection material 5 is sealed by a cured product 6 of the curable silicone composition described above. An example of a method for producing the surface-mounted LED illustrated in FIG. 1 is a method of die-bonding the optical semiconductor element 1 to the lead frame 2, wire-bonding the optical semiconductor element 1 and the lead frame 3 with a bonding wire 4 made of gold, molding the curable silicone composition by transfer molding or compression molding, and then forming the light reflection material 5 on the periphery of the optical semiconductor element 1. Another example is a method of first forming the light reflection material 5 and then resin-sealing the optical semiconductor element 1 on the inside of the light reflection material 5 with the curable silicone composition described above. EXAMPLES The curable silicone composition and optical semiconductor device of the present invention will be described in detail hereinafter using Practical Examples and Comparative Examples. Furthermore, the hardness of the cured product of the curable silicone composition, the storage stability of the curable silicone composition, and the color change of the cured product were measured as follows. [Hardness] The curable silicone composition was press-molded at 150° C. for 1 hour at 5 MPa pressure to produce a sheet-like cured product. The hardness of the sheet-like cured product was measured by type A durometer as specified in JIS K 6253. [Storage Stability] In the curable silicone composition, a composition was prepared without adding a hydrosilylation reaction catalyst, and after storing for 100 hours in a 50° C. oven, a curable silicone composition was prepared by adding a hydrosilylation reaction catalyst. After this thermal aging, the type A durometer hardness of the cured product obtained by heating the curable silicone composition at 150° C. for 1 hour was measured. If the hardness after the thermal aging was lower than the hardness of the cured product obtained by curing the curable silicone composition before thermal aging, it was considered a “curing defect.” Furthermore, the appearance of the curable silicone composition after storage for 100 hours was observed macroscopically. [Discoloration] The curable silicone composition was press-molded at 150° C. for 1 hour at 5 MPa pressure to produce a sheet-like cured product. The sheet-like cured product was heated in nitrogen air flow at 200° C. for 250 hours. After heating, the b value of the cured product in the CIE Lab standard colorimetric system according to JIS Z 8730 was measured using a colorimeter, and the b value after aging subtracted from the b value before aging was taken as the change in b value. Furthermore, the optical semiconductor device illustrated in FIG. 1 was produced by heating at 150° C. for 1 hour using the curable silicone composition. Sulfur resistance of this optical semiconductor device was measured as follows by measuring radiant flux. [Sulfur Resistance] The initial radiant flux of the optical semiconductor device was measured by a total radiant flux measurement apparatus using integrating spheres. Then, the optical semiconductor device was put into an autoclave with sodium sulfide hexahydrate, heated to 50° C., and left to stand for 100 hours. After that, radiant flux of the optical semiconductor device was measured by a total radiant flux measurement apparatus using integrating spheres.
