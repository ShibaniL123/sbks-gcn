FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention is in the field of infant nutrition and relates to providing nutrition to infants that are born preterm and that are small for gestational age (SGA) and in particular the invention relates to the long term beneficial cognitive effect in such preterm-SGA infants. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION With advances in neonatal intensive care, the survival of very preterm (born <32 weeks of gestation) and very low birth weight (VLBW; weighing <1500 grams) children has improved considerably. However, a variety of risk factors associated with preterm and low birth weight birth, including neonatal infections and inflammatory responses, adversely affect normal brain maturation processes in these children. As a consequence, widespread differences in brain development compared to term peers are found, as indicated by an overall reduction in grey and white matter volumes as measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as well as reduced white matter integrity as measured by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Unfortunately, these unfavourable differences in brain development appear to pertain into childhood and adolescence, and increase the risks for poor motor, cognitive, and behavioural development in very preterm/VLBW children. Many infant formulae for term infants are available on the market. However, these are not optimal for administration to preterm infants or infants with a low birth weight, since the complete nutritional needs of a rapidly growing preterm infant are not met. Likewise, the composition of human milk does not fully meet the nutritional requirements. The major goal of enteral nutrient supply to these infants is to achieve growth similar to fetal growth coupled with satisfactory functional development. The preferred food for infants with a low birth weight is therefore fortified human milk, or, alternatively, formula specially designed for these infants. Human milk fortifiers (HMF) and preterm infant formulae are commercially available. Typically, HMF comprises besides protein, also carbohydrates or fat, minerals and vitamins. Typically, preterm infant formulae have an increased protein concentration. Enteral feeding of very low birth weight (VLBW) infants and small for gestational age infants is a challenge, since metabolic demands are high and administration of enteral nutrition is limited by immaturity of the gastrointestinal tract. The amino acid glutamine has been used in nutritional compositions for preterm infants. Van den Berg et al, 2005, Am J Clin Nutr 81:1397-1404 disclose that supplementation with glutamine lowers infectious morbidity in VLBL infants. Van den Berg et al, 2007, Arch. Pediatrics & Adolescent Medicine, 161:1095-1101 disclose that supplementation with glutamine decreases risk for atopic dermatitis in the first year of life and at the age of 6. Van Zwol et al, 2008, Acta Paediatrica, 97:562-567 report that there is no effect of glutamine supplementation in VLBW infants on neurodevelopment outcome at age of 2 years. Smaller total brain volumes, white and grey matter volumes, as well as smaller volumes of the cerebellum, hippocampus, and corpus callosum have been found associated with lower outcomes in terms of IQ, see Allin et al., Brain 2001, 1: 60-6; Taylor et al., Dev Neuropsychol 2011, 1: 96-117; Parker et al., Brain 2008, 5: 1344-51; Allin et al., Arch Pediatr Adolesc Med 2007, 12: 1183-9; Martinussen et al., J Pediatr 2009, 6: 848-53; Narberhaus et al., Neuropsychologia 2008, 1: 111-6; Reiss et al., J Pediatr 2004, 2:242-9; Yung et al., Pediatr Res 2007, 6: 732-6; Northam et al., Ann Neurol 2011, 4: 702-11. WO 2011/047107 discloses the use of an arginine-glutamine dipeptide to support retinal, intestinal and/or nervous system development in a neonate. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The inventors found that glutamine enriched feeding in the first month after birth in very preterm and/or VLBW infants has a long term effect on measures of brain development. In total 52 very preterm and/or VLBW children, who originally took part in a randomized controlled trial on enteral glutamine supplementation between day 3 and 30 of life, participated in this follow up study at school age, with a mean age of 8.6 years (SD=0.3 years). Measures of brain development included volumetric outcomes of various brain structures as well as fractional anisotropy (FA) values of major white matter tracts, using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) including Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) techniques, respectively. An increased cortical brain volume and subcortical brain volume was observed in children who were born preterm and were supplemented in the first month after birth with L-glutamine when compared to the control group of preterm infants not having received L-glutamine. In particular a significant increased white matter volume, brain stem volume, and hippocampus volume was observed Surprisingly it was found that glutamine enriched feeding in the first month after birth in preterm infants that were born small for gestational age has a long term effect on improving cognitive function. In particular an improved IQ later in life was measured in preterm infants that were born small for gestational age that were fed glutamine enriched feeding compared to a control group of preterm infants that were born small for gestational age that not received glutamine enriched feeding. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention thus concerns a method for improving cognitive functioning in a preterm infant born small for gestational age, comprising administering a glutamine enriched nutritional composition to said preterm infant born small for gestational age. The present invention also concerns a method for improving IQ in a preterm infant born small for gestational age, comprising administering a glutamine enriched nutritional composition to said preterm infant born small for gestational age.

Preferably the glutamine enriched nutritional composition is administered during the first six, preferably the first four, more preferably the first two and most preferably at least the first month after birth of the preterm infant born small for gestational age. Preferably the improvement in cognitive functioning and/or improvement in IQ is established in the infant later in life, preferably at an age above 4 years, more preferably at an age between 4 to 12 years.

Preterm Infants That Are Born Small for Gestational Age The present invention relates to a method for feeding preterm infants that are born small for gestational age. Preterm infants are infants that are born before the end of the 37th week of pregnancy. Very preterm infants are born before the end of the 32th week of pregnancy. Small for gestational age (SGA) infants are those whose birth weight lies below the 10th percentile for that gestational age. This is a different (sub)group from low-birth weight (LBW) or very low birth weight (VLBW) children which latter groups also encompass children that are appropriate for gestational age (AGA). In one embodiment according to the invention the preterm infant born small for gestational age is a very preterm infant born small for gestational age. Glutamine The nutritional composition of the present invention comprises glutamine. Throughout this description this is also referred to as nutritional composition comprising glutamine or glutamine enriched nutritional composition. Glutamine in the present invention refers to L-glutamine. Glutamine is one of the most abundant amino acids in plasma and human milk and is considered conditionally essential in preterm infants. Glutamine is utilized as a source of energy and for nucleotide synthesis in all rapidly dividing cells, such as the intestinal lining and certain immune cells. In the brain, glutamine is a substrate for neurotransmitters and an important source of energy for the nervous system. Preterm infants that are born small for gestational age may be especially susceptible to glutamine depletion as nutritional supply of glutamine is limited in the first weeks after birth. Furthermore the endogenous capacity to synthesize glutamine from glutamate is not fully developed in these infants. Glutamine is preferably present in an easily absorbable form. Because of the immaturity of the intestinal tract of preterm infants that are born small for gestational age, glutamine present in intact protein is less easily absorbed. Therefore the glutamine is preferably present in the form of free amino acids and/or di- and/or tripeptides, most preferably glutamine dipeptide and/or free glutamine. Free glutamine and glutamine dipeptide are commercially available, for example at Ajinomoto, USA. In one embodiment glutamine dipeptide is in the form of a dipeptide of 2 glutamine residues. In one embodiment, glutamine dipeptide is in the form of a dipeptide of one glutamine and one amino acid other than glutamine. For example glutamine dipeptide can also be in the form of alanine-glutamine dipeptide. The term free glutamine in the context of this invention means in the form of a single amino acid. This includes glutamine as a single amino acid in the form of a salt. The nutritional composition of the present invention comprises glutamine levels higher then normally present in human milk protein or standard preterm formula based on cow's milk derived protein. Preferably the nutritional composition of the present invention comprises at least 12 wt. %, more preferably at least 15 wt. %, more preferably at least 20 wt. %, even more preferably at least 30 wt. % glutamine based on total protein. Preferably the nutritional composition of the present invention comprises at least 1.5 wt. %, more preferably at least 2 wt. %, even more preferably at least 4 wt. % glutamine based on dry weight of the nutritional composition. Preferably the nutritional composition of the present invention comprises at least 0.3 g, more preferably at least 0.5 g, even more preferably at least 1 g glutamine based on 100 kcal. Preferably the nutritional composition of the present invention comprises at least 12 wt. %, more preferably at least 15 wt. %, more preferably at least 20 wt. %, even more preferably at least 30 wt. % glutamine in the form of free amino acid and/or dipeptide based on total protein. Preferably the nutritional composition of the present invention comprises at least 1.5 wt. %, more preferably at least 2 wt. %, even more preferably at least 4 wt. % glutamine in the form of free amino acid and/or dipeptide based on dry weight of the nutritional composition. Preferably the nutritional composition of the present invention comprises at least 0.3 g, more preferably at least 0.5 g, even more preferably at least 1 g glutamine in the form of free amino acid and/or dipeptide based on 100 kcal. The daily dose of glutamine, preferably free glutamine, based on kg body weight, is preferably of 0.01 to 0.5 g, more preferably 0.03 to 0.4 g, even more preferably 0.07 to 0.35 g. Nutritional Composition in the Present Method or Use In one embodiment the glutamine enriched composition for use according to the present invention is a nutritional composition. In one embodiment, the present invention relates to nutritional compositions for use in feeding preterm infants that are born small for gestational age. In one embodiment the glutamine enriched nutritional composition for use according to the present invention is a preterm formula. The preterm formula comprises all macro- and micronutrients needed for preterm infants so as to achieve a growth similar to fetal growth coupled with satisfactory functional development. In one embodiment according to the invention the nutritional composition comprises between 1.5 wt. % and 20 wt. % glutamine based on dry weight of the nutritional composition, and comprises protein in such an amount that glutamine is present between 12 wt. % and 80 wt% based on total protein. Preferably the nutritional composition is a preterm formula. Preferably the glutamine is in the form of free glutamine, glutamine dipeptide and/or glutamine tripeptide. In a preferred embodiment the preterm formula comprises from 5 to 25 wt. % protein, preferably 9 to 20 wt. %, more preferably 13 to 18 wt. % protein based on the dry weight of the preterm formula. In a preferred embodiment the preterm formula comprises from 1.8 to 3.0 g protein, preferably, preferably 2.0 to 3.0 g, preferably 2.5 g to 2.6 g protein, per 100 ml. In a preferred embodiment according to the invention the preterm formula comprises from 6 to 30% protein, more preferably 10 to 20, even more preferably 12 to 15% protein, based on total calories. The wording “% protein based on total calories” refers to the energy of 1 g protein being 4.0 kcal. For determining the amount of protein, the sum of proteins, peptides and free amino acids, including the glutamine, should be taken into account. Preferably, the protein content is determined according to the Kjeldahl method using a conversion factor of 6.25 and preferably using a conversion factor of 6.38 in case of casein dominant formula. Whey protein is highly suitable as a protein source for preterm infants that are born small for gestational age. However, since sweet whey protein generally has a high threonine content, which can result in hyperthreoninemia, preferably the preterm formula in the present method or use, comprises acid whey protein or sweet whey protein from which at least part of the glycomacropeptide (GMP) is removed. The preterm formula in the present method or use, preferably contains from 4.7 to 7.5 g threonine per 100 g amino acids, preferably from 3.9 to 4.6 g threonine per 100 g amino acids. Preferably, the preterm formula in the present method or use, contains non-hydrolysed protein, in order to decrease the osmolarity of the reconstituted preterm formula, which is beneficial in preterm infants that are born small for gestational age. Advantageously, the protein of the preterm formula in the present method or use is hydrolysed in order to increase digestibility and gastro-intestinal tolerance. This is particularly preferred in preterm infants that are born small for gestational age since they have an immature intestinal tract which impaired digestion and absorption capacity. Advantageously and preferably, the protein is present in the preterm formula in partially hydrolyzed form, thereby enabling a better solubility and digestion than intact protein, without increasing the osmolarity too much, as is the case with extensively hydrolysed protein or free amino acids. Partially hydrolyzed protein in this invention refers to protein with a degree of hydrolysis from 3 to 20%. In a preferred embodiment of the invention the preterm formula comprises a protein with a degree of hydrolysis from 3 to 20%, preferably 5 to 18%, most preferably 5 to 15%. In a preferred embodiment of the invention the preterm formula comprises casein and/or whey protein. In a preferred embodiment of the invention the preterm formula comprises casein. In a preferred embodiment of the invention the preterm formula comprises whey protein. Preferably, the preterm formula comprises whey protein and casein derived from non-human milk, preferably cow's milk.

Preferably the preterm formula in the method or use according to the present invention comprises at least 12 wt. %, more preferably at least 15 wt. %, more preferably at least 20 wt. %, even more preferably at least 30 wt. % glutamine based on total protein. Preferably the preterm formula comprises no more than 80 wt. %, more preferably no more than 50 wt. % glutamine based on total protein. Preferably the preterm formula in the present method or use comprises at least 1.5 wt. %, more preferably at least 2 wt. %, even more preferably at least 4 wt. % glutamine based on dry weight of the preterm formula. Preferably the preterm formula comprises no more than 20 wt. %, more preferably no more than 10 wt. % glutamine based on dry weight of the preterm formula. Preferably the preterm formula in the present method or use comprises at least 0.3 g, more preferably at least 0.5 g, even more preferably at least 1 g glutamine based on 100 kcal of the preterm formula. Preferably the preterm formula comprises no more than 5 g, even more preferably no more than 2 g glutamine based on 100 kcal of the preterm formula. Preferably the preterm formula in the method or use according to the present invention comprises at least 12 wt. %, more preferably at least 15 wt. %, more preferably at least 20 wt. %, even more preferably at least 30 wt. % glutamine in the form of free amino acid and/or dipeptide based on total protein. Preferably the preterm formula comprises no more than 80 wt. %, more preferably no more than 50 wt. % glutamine in the form of free amino acid and/or dipeptide based on total protein. Preferably the preterm formula in the present method or use comprises at least 1.5 wt. %, more preferably at least 2 wt. %, even more preferably at least 4 wt. % glutamine in the form of free amino acid and/or dipeptide based on dry weight of the preterm formula. Preferably the preterm formula comprises no more than 20 wt. %, more preferably no more than 10 wt% glutamine in the form of free amino acid and/or dipeptide based on dry weight of the preterm formula. Preferably the preterm formula in the present method or use comprises at least 0.3 g, more preferably at least 0.5 g, even more preferably at least 1 g glutamine in the form of free amino acid and/or dipeptide based on 100 kcal of the preterm formula. Preferably the preterm formula comprises no more than 5 g, even more preferably no more than 2 g glutamine in the form of free amino acid and/or dipeptide based on 100 kcal of the preterm formula. The preterm formula in the present method or use in ready to drink form has in a preferred embodiment about 70 to 90 kcal, preferably 75 to 85 kcal per 100 ml. Preferably the preterm formula has an osmolarity below 450 mOsmol/l, more preferably below 400, even more preferably below 350. Particularly in preterm infants that are born small for gestational age, a too high osmolarity is a disadvantage. In the present method or use, preferably the preterm formula comprises about 3.5 to 5.5 g, preferably 3.9 to 5.0 g, fat per 100 ml. Preferably the preterm formula comprises about 20 to 50 wt. %, preferably 26 to 35 wt. % fat based on dry weight of the preterm formula. Preferably the preterm formula comprises about 3.5 to 7.0 g, more preferably 5.0 to 6.5 g, more preferably 5.3 to 5.8 g fat, based on 100 kcal of the preterm formula. Fat is preferably vegetable fat. Preferably the fat component comprises long chain poly-unsaturated fatty acids such as docosahexaenoic acid and arachidonic acid. These fatty acids are beneficial for brain and visual development in preterm infants that are born small for gestational age. Preferably the fat component comprises medium chain fatty acids, preferably at least 10 wt. % and at most 40 wt. % based on total fatty acids. Medium chain fatty acids are more easily absorbed by preterm and/or LBW infants. In the present method or use, preferably the preterm formula comprises 6 to 10 g, preferably 7 to 8 g, digestible carbohydrates per 100 ml. Preferably the preterm formula comprises 40 to 80 wt. % preferably 40 to 50 wt. % digestible carbohydrates based on dry weight of the preterm formula. Preferably the preterm formula comprises about 5 to 20 g, more preferably 6 to 15 g, more preferably 7 to 10 g digestible carbohydrates, based on 100 kcal of the preterm formula. Suitable digestible carbohydrates are lactose and maltodextin. In the present method or use, preferably the preterm formula comprises at least one non-digestible oligosaccharide. Advantageously and most preferred, the non-digestible oligosaccharide is water-soluble (according to the method disclosed in L. Prosky et al, J. Assoc. Anal. Chem 71: 1017-1023, 1988). Non-digestible oligosaccharides, also called prebiotics, are not digested in the intestine by the action of digestive enzymes present in the human upper digestive tract (small intestine and stomach) but instead are fermented by the human intestinal microbiota. For example, glucose, fructose, galactose, sucrose, lactose, maltose and the maltodextrins are considered digestible. Non-digestible oligosaccharides advantageously further improve the effect of the present glutamine on structural brain volume or growth. Non-digestible oligosaccharides stimulate a healthy gut environment, thereby aiding the uptake of glutamine. Preferably the non-digestible oligosaccharide has a degree of polymerisation (DP) of 2 to 200. The average DP of the non-digestible oligosaccharide is preferably below 200, more preferably below 100, even more preferably below 60, most preferably below 40.

When the non-digestible oligosaccharide is a mixture, the averages of the respective parameters are used for defining the present invention. In the present method or use, preferably the composition comprises two different non-digestible oligosaccharides, with a different type of glycosidic linkage, a different degree of polymerisation and/or a different monosaccharide composition. Here below the two different non-digestible oligosaccharides are also referred to as non-digestible oligosaccharide A and B. Preferably, at least 60%, more preferably at least 75% even more preferably 90%, most preferably 98% of the total monosaccharide units of the non-digestible oligosaccharide, are monosaccharides selected from the group consisting of galactose (gal), fructose (fru) and glucose (glu) monosaccharides.

Preferably non-digestible oligosaccharide is a fructo-oligosaccharide. A fructo-oligosaccharide may in other context have names like fructopolysaccharides, oligofructose, polyfructose, polyfructan, inulin, levan and fructan and may refer to oligosaccharides comprising β-linked fructose units, which are preferably linked by β(2,1) and/or β(2,6) glycosidic linkages, and a preferable DP between 2 and 200. Preferably, the fructo-oligosaccharide contains a terminal β(2,1) glycosidic linked glucose. Preferably, the fructo-oligosaccharide contains at least 7 β-linked fructose units. In a further preferred embodiment inulin is used as non-digestible oligosaccharide B. Inulin is a type of fructo-oligosaccharide wherein at least 75% of the glycosidic linkages are β(2,1) linkages. Typically, inulin has an average chain length between 8 and 60 monosaccharide units.

Other suitable sources are raftilose (Orafti), fibrulose and fibruline (Cosucra) and Frutafit and frutalose (Sensus). Most preferred is a mixture of transgalacto-oligosaccharide with an average DP below 10, preferably below 6 and a fructo-oligosaccharide with an average DP above 7, preferably above 11, even more preferably above 20.

Preferably the nutritional supplement is added to human milk, standard preterm formula, or human milk fortified with standard human milk fortifier in such an amount that the final glutamine enriched nutritional composition comprises at least 12 wt. %, more preferably at least 15 wt. %, more preferably at least 20 wt. %, even more preferably at least 30 wt. % glutamine in the form of free amino acid and/or dipeptide based on total protein. Preferably the nutritional supplement is added to human milk, standard preterm formula, or human milk fortified with standard human milk fortifier in such an amount that the final glutamine enriched nutritional composition comprises at least 1.5 wt. %, more preferably at least 2 wt. %, even more preferably at least 4 wt. % glutamine in the form of amino acid and/or dipeptide based on dry weight of the nutritional composition. Preferably the nutritional supplement is added to human milk, standard preterm formula, or human milk fortified with standard human milk fortifier in such an amount that the final glutamine enriched nutritional composition comprises at least 0.3 g, more preferably at least 0.5 g, even more preferably at least 1 g glutamine in the form of free amino acid and/or dipeptide based on 100 kcal. Preferably the glutamine-based supplement comprises at least 10 wt. % non digestible oligosaccharides based on dry weight of the glutamine-based supplement, preferably at least 15 wt. %, more preferably at least 20 wt. %, more preferably at least 25 wt. %, or at least 30 wt. % or at least 40 wt. % up to at most 50 wt. % non digestible oligosaccharides based on dry weight of the glutamine-based supplement. Preferably, the non digestible oligosaccharides in the glutamine-based supplement invention are selected from the group consisting of fructo-oligosaccharide and galacto-oligosaccharide. Preferably, the glutamine-based supplement comprises the non-digestible oligosaccharides transgalacto-oligosaccharide and fructo-oligosaccharide. Preferably the nutritional composition comprising glutamine is in dry form, preferably a powder. This powder is suitable for reconstitution with water or another aqueous phase. When glutamine is in powder form it advantageously has a better shelf life. Glutamine, in particular free glutamine and glutamine dipeptide, is more stable when stored in dry form. Application Administration of the nutritional composition to the preterm infant born small for gestational age is enterally or parenterally, more preferably enterally, more preferably orally via a bottle, even more preferably enterally by naso-gastric tube feeding. Enteral feeding has the advantage that the glutamine will provide a beneficial effect in the intestinal tract as well regarding intestinal infections and improving barrier function. Administration of the nutritional composition comprising glutamine is preferably during the first month after birth, more preferably until a body weight of 2500 is reached. Preferably the administration is daily. Preferably the administration is daily for at least a period of a week, more preferably 30 days. The inventors found that glutamine enriched feeding in the first month after birth in preterm infant born small for gestational age has a long term effect on functional brain development. Advantageously an improvement in cognitive functioning was observed in children who were born preterm and were small for gestational age and were supplemented in the first month after birth with glutamine when compared to the control group of preterm infants small for gestational age not having received glutamine. In particular a statistically significant increased in IQ was observed. IQ stands for intelligence quotient and is a score derived from one of several standardized tests designed to assess intelligence. The present invention preferably relates to improving cognitive functioning later in life, preferably at an age above 4 years, more preferably at an age between 4 to 12 years, and/or improving IQ later in life, preferably at an age above 4 years, more preferably at an age between 4 to 12 years, in preterm infants small for gestational age by administering a nutritional composition comprising glutamine to the infants in the first months of life. With improvement in cognitive functioning and improvement in IQ, an improvement compared to a preterm born small for gestational age control group not having received the nutritional composition comprising glutamine is meant. The effects on cognitive functioning and/or IQ are preferably established later in life. The effects on cognitive functioning and/or IQ are preferably established during school age. With school age an age between 4 to 12 years is meant. It is particularly beneficial that the observed effects of the nutritional composition comprising glutamine on cognitive functioning are established during school age, since then the cognitive function is more evident. EXAMPLES Example 1 Effect of Glutamine Supplementation in VLBW and/or Very Preterm Infants on Brain Volume Later in Life and on Functional Outcome in Small for Gestational Age Preterm Children Later in Life A randomized, placebo controlled clinical trial was performed. For a detailed protocol of the study, see van den Berg et al, 2004, Glutamine-enriched enteral nutrition in very low birth weight infants. Design of a double-blind randomised controlled trial [ISRCTN73254583], BMC Pediatrics 4:17. In short: Infants with a gestational age <32 weeks and/or birth weight <1500 g were enrolled. In total 52 very preterm and/or VLBW children, which had taken part in a randomized controlled trial on enteral glutamine supplementation between day 3 and 30 of life, participated in this follow up study at the mean age of 8.6 years (SD =0.3 years). 30 infants were in the control group and 22 in the glutamine supplementation group. Also comparisons were made with a control group (n=52) of term born infants. The glutamine nutritional supplement was in powder form and contained 82 wt. % L-glutamine in total and 18 wt. % glucose (nitrogen 15.5 wt/wt %; 371 kcal/100 g), whereas the isonitrogenous control powder contained 100 wt. % L-alanine (nitrogen 15.7 wt/wt %, 435 kcal/100 g). The two powders were indistinguishable by appearance, colour and smell. Between days 3 and 30 of life, supplementation was administered in increasing doses to a maximum of 0.3 g/kg glutamine per day in the glutamine group. Initially, the supplementation dose was based on birth weight. After 2 weeks the dose was adjusted to actual body weight. Two members of the nursing staff daily added supplementation to breast milk or to preterm formula (Nenatal®, Nutricia Nederland B. V., Zoetermeer, The Netherlands), according to the parents' choice. Per 100 ml, Nenatal® provides 78 kcal, 2.1 g protein (casein-whey protein weight ratio 40:60), 4.4 g fat and 7.5 g carbohydrate. Nenatal® does not contain free glutamine and alanine or glutamine and alanine in the form of dipeptide. Protocol guidelines for the introduction of parenteral and enteral nutrition are disclosed in van den Berg et al., 2004. All statistical analyses are performed on an intention to treat basis. In addition, alternative per protocol analyses are performed, excluding all patients who are not treated according to protocol, defined as more than 3 consecutive days or more than a total of 5 days on minimal enteral feeding or without supplementation. A p value <0.05 is considered significant (two-tailed). SPSS 9.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Ill., USA) and STAT 7.0 (Stat-Corp LP, College Station, Tex., USA) are used for data analysis. A p value of 0.1 or below is considered to represent a realistic effect, a trend. Due to the small size of the groups also the effect size is taken into account. An effect size above 0.4 is considered to represent a trend. Results: No statistically significant difference of the control preterm group and glutamine supplemented preterm group for follow up was present regarding base line characteristics, such as age, social economic status, ethnicity, birth weight, gestational age, head circumference, HELLP syndrome, BPD (bronchopulmonary dysplasia), IVH (intraventricular hemorrhage) grade I/II, IVH grade III/IV, ROP (retinopathy of prematurity) grade III/IV, Apgar score after 5 min., mode of delivery, gender and drop outs. The control group had more infections and a higher use of prenatal corticosteroids. Mean birth weight was 1186 (sd 336) gram in the control group, and 1252 (sd 380) in the glutamine group. Gestational age was 28.9 (sd 1.7) weeks in the control group and 29.4 (sd 1.7) in the glutamine group. Brain cortical volumes were determined by MRI and calculated using FSL software “FAST” and corrected for age at MRI scan, gender and body weight for gestational age. Brain cortical volumes were significantly higher in the term control group than in the preterm group. This was the case for intracranial volume, grey matter, white matter and cerebellum volume. In the preterm group, the glutamine supplemented group had a significantly higher white matter volume. A tendency for an increase in intracranial volume, and cerebellum volume was also observed, see Table 1. The cortical brain volumes in the glutamine group were higher than in the control group, and were more comparable to the term control group.

Brain subcortical volumes were significantly higher in the term controls than in preterm group. This was the case for the brain stem, thalamus, putamen, caudate nucleus, hippocampus, globus pallidum, amygdale, nucleus accumbens and the corpus callosum volume. In the preterm group, the glutamine supplemented group had higher subcortical volume, and significantly higher brain stem volume and hippocampus volume, and a tendency for an increase in other subcortical brain structures volume, see Table 2. The subcortical brain volumes in the glutamine group were higher than in the control group, and were more comparable to the term control group.

Intellectual development was analysed in this subgroup of infants by a short form of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-III (WISC-III), including the subtests Vocabulary and Block Design. Both subtests correlate strongly (r 0.90) with full-scale intelligence quotient (FSIQ). Scores on this test were normalised with a mean of 100 (SD 15). Results Preterm-SGA children had smaller brain volumes than appropriate for gestational age (AGA) children (d=1.36, p<0.001). A group of nine SGA infants that received placebo was compared with a group of nine SGA infants that received glutamine treatment. There was a significant interaction between SGA status and glutamine group for total IQ score (p <0.05). A significant improvement in IQ (WISC-III FSIQ being 102.3 sd 11.2, n=9) in the glutamine group compared to the control group (WISC-III FSIQ 81.7 sd 15.4 n=9) was found. Preterm children born small for gestational age (SGA <10th percentile) have relatively larger reductions in brain volumes. The increased brain volumes at school age after glutamine supplementation at birth are considered to be beneficial for improving cognitive function, in particular improving IQ, of SGA children with relatively small brain volumes at birth.
