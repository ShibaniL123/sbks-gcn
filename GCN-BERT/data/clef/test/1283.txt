300 mg of (S)-4-amino-3,3-dimethyl-1-((R)-1-phenylethyl)pyrrolidine-2-one (an intermediated obtained during synthesis in Example 43) was added to a 50-mL round-bottomed flask, and 15.0 mL of tetrahydrofuran was added thereto. After 215 mg of lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH4) was slowly dropwise added thereto at 0°C, the reaction mixture was refluxed for about 12 hours and then cooled 0°C. 1.50 mL of deionized water was slowly added thereto while cooling. After the reaction mixture was stirred for about 5 minutes, 1.50 mL of a 15% sodium hydroxide (NaOH) aqueous solution was added thereto to terminate the reaction. The reaction mixture was filtered through a Celite™ 545 filter agent. The resulting filtrate was distilled under reduced pressure. Then, the reaction mixture was extracted with 10.0 mL of ethyl acetate (EtOAc) and 10.0 mL of saturated brine to collect an organic phase. The collected organic phase was filtered with sodium sulfate (Na2SO4). The resulting filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. As a result, 254 mg of (S)-4,4-dimethyl-1-((R)-1-phenylethyl)pyrrolidine-3-amine was obtained with a yield of about 90.4%.
250 mg of (S)-4,4-dimethyl-1-((R)-1-phenylethyl)pyrrolidine-3-amine was added into a 50-mL round-bottomed flask, and then 2.50 mL of tetrahydrofuran and 2.50 mL of a saturated sodium hydrogen carbonate (NaHCO3) solution were added thereto. After 262 mg of di-tert-butyl dicarbamate (Boc2O) was added, the reaction mixture was vigorously stirred overnight and then concentrated under reduced pressure. Then, the reaction mixture was extracted with 3.00 mL of ethyl acetate (EtOAc) and 6.00 mL of saturated brine to collect an organic phase. The collected organic phase was filtered with sodium sulfate (Na2SO4). The resulting filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. As a result, 354 mg of tert-butyl ((S)-4,4-dimethyl-1-((R)-1-phenylethyl)pyrrolidine-3-yl)carbamate was obtained with a yield of about 96.7%.
354 mg of tert-butyl ((S)-4,4-dimethyl-1-((R)-1-phenylethyl)pyrrolidine-3-yl)carbamate was added to a 25-mL round-bottomed flask, and 5.30 mL of tetrahydrofuran was added thereinto. After 265 mg of lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH4) was slowly dropwise added thereinto at 0°C, the reaction mixture was refluxed for about 12 hours and then cooled at about 0°C. 1.00 mL of deionized water was added thereinto while cooling. After the reaction mixture was stirred for about 5 minutes, 1.00 mL of a 15% sodium hydroxide (NaOH) aqueous solution was added thereto to terminate the reaction. The reaction mixture was filtered through a Celite™ 545 filter agent. The resulting filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. As a result, 247 mg of (S)-N,4,4-trimethyl-1-((R)-1-phenylethyl)pyrrolidine-3-amine was obtained with a yield of about 96.1%.
247 mg of (S)-N,4,4-trimethyl-1-((R)-1-phenylethyl)pyrrolidine-3-amine was added to a 50-mL round-bottomed flask, and 4.94 mL of deionized water was added thereto. After 171 mg of 6-chloro-7-deazapurine and 293 mg of potassium carbonate (K2CO3) were sequentially added to the reaction mixture, the reaction mixture was refluxed for about 24 hours and then cooled at room temperature. The reaction mixture was extracted tree times with 5 mL of dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) to collect an organic phase. The collected organic phase was concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was purified by flash column chromatography (MeOH:CH2Cl2=2:98). As a result, 97.0 mg of N-((S)-4,4-dimethyl-1-((R)-1-phenylethyl)pyrrolidine-3-yl)-N-methyl-7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine-4-amine was obtained with a yield of about 26.2%.
96.8 mg of N-((S)-4,4-dimethyl-1-((R)-1-phenylethyl)pyrrolidine-3-yl)-N-methyl-7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine-4-amine was added to a 25-mL round-bottomed flask and then dissolved with 1.00 mL of methanol. After 96.8 mg of a 10w/w% palladium/carbon (Pd/C) was added thereto, a hydrogen-containing balloon was installed on the reaction flask. The reaction mixture was vigorously stirred overnight and then filtered through a Celite™ 545 filter agent. The resulting filtrate was distilled under reduced pressure. As a result, 63.0 mg of (S)-N-(4,4-dimethylpyrrolidine-3-yl)-N-methyl-7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine-4-amine was obtained with a yield of about 92.6%.
63.0 mg of (S)-N-(4,4-dimethylpyrrolidine-3-yl)-N-methyl-7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine-4-amine was added to a 10-mL round-bottomed flask, and then dissolved with 1.26 mL of n-butanol. After 0.237 mL of ethyl cyanoacetate was added into the solution, the reaction mixture was treated with 0.0192 mL of 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU) and then heated at about 80°C for about 24 hours. After termination of the reaction, the reaction solution was distilled under reduced pressure to remove the solvent. The resulting residue was purified by flash column chromatography (MeOH:CH2Cl2=2:98). The resulting fraction was distilled under reduced pressure and then concentrated under vacuum. As a result, 26.3 mg of (S)-3-(3,3-dimethyl-4-(methyl(7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine-4-yl)amino)pyrrolidine-1-yl)-3-oxopropanenitrile was obtained with a yield of about 32.8%.
