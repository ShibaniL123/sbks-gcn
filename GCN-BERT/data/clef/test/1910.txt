COMPOSITIONS AND METHODS OF THEIR USE FOR IMPROVING THE CONDITION AND APPEARANCE OF SKIN FIELD OF THE INVENTION [0001] This invention generally relates to cosmetic compositions and their use, and more particularly to cosmetic compositions and to their use in improving the condition and appearance of skin. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0002] There is an increasing demand in the cosmetics industry to develop products that may be applied topically to the skin that improve the condition and appearance of skin. Consumers are interested in mitigating or delaying the dermatological signs of chronologically or hormonally- aged or photo-aged skin, such as fine lines, wrinkles, and sagging skin, and other conditions due to a progressive degradation of the dermal-epidermal junction (DEJ) and of the cell-cell cohesion in the epidermis. During the aging process, the complexion of the skin, i.e., the color and appearance of the skin, deteriorates slowly from aging and/or exposure to sunlight. Numerous cosmetic and medical treatments have been developed in an attempt to treat aging or aged skin. Such cosmetics or treatments commonly contain organic acids as their active ingredients or components. These actives are frequently associated with consumer discomfort, such as burning, itching, and redness. [0003] Therefore,' there remains a general need in the cosmetics industry for products that retard or counter the aging effects on the skin, and more specifically for products that produce such effects without undesirable side effects. In particular, there remains a need for topically applied cosmetic compositions that have anti-aging and skin texture benefits using natural plant materials as active components. [0004] Plumbago indica Linn, of the Plumbaginaceae family, also known as Red Plumbago and Jettamoonpleung have been employed for a variety of medicinal purposes. Scraped roots have been used in poultices where the poultices are applied to the head or area that is in pain or inflamed. The bark may also be used as an effective blistering plaster, and may be applied to the spine to treat certain fevers. Plumbago indica Linn, is also said to have anti-dyspeptic, anti-microbial, and anti-fertility activities. The Plumbago indica Linn, laurel is commonly found in tropical Asia and Thailand. [0005] Cananga odorata Lamk. of the Annonaceae family, commonly known as Ylang-Ylang, Alanguilan, and Kradung-nga, and specifically its essential oils may be used in traditional medicine for relieving pain and for relaxation. Canango odorate Lamk. is distributed throughout the entire South Asian region, but principally as a cultivated plant. In particular, this tree is commonly found in all regions of Thailand. [0006] Sapindus rarak of the Sapindaceae family commonly known as the Soap Nut tree and Ma Kam Dee Kao in Thai, may be used in traditional medicine. Decoction of Sapindus rarak fruits may be taken as an anti-pyretic and to relieve asthma. Hot water extracts of the fruits and flowers may also be used externally as an anti-fungal, anti-bacterial, anti-dandruff and against scalp diseases, and to reduce inflammation resulting from rashes. In addition to the aforementioned benefits, Sapindus rarak also has antiparasitic and analgesic activities. Sapindus rarak commonly grows in a virgin forest up on a mountain mostly in the Northern part of Thailand. [0007] Curcuma Xanthorrhiza Roxb. of the Zingiberaceae family, commonly known as Wild Turmeric and Wan Too Ra Hod in Thai, bears a striking similarity to Cape York Turmeric, only the flower bracts are a deeper pink/purple in color and have a dark stripe up the center of the leaf. However, Curcuma xanthorrhiza Roxb. is not the same as common turmeric or Khamin chan as it is known in Thai, although they bear a resemblance. Curcuma xanthorrhiza Roxb. has often been used medicinally as a drink by cooking dried slices of rhizome in water with palm sugar. Another herbal drink utilizes chopped up bulbs which are boiled in water and palm sugar. Shoots, flowers and rhizomes, as well as young parts of the plant, may be eaten raw or cooked. Asian cultures use this plant in mixtures for liver, gallstones, and indigestion complaints. Curcuma xanthorrhiza Roxb. has also been shown to aid in the reduction of cholesterol and cleansing the blood. The Curcuma plant family has been used for centuries in Thailand, Java, and Bali to beautify, perfume, tighten and deodorize the skin. Tumeric, or Curcuma xanthorrhiza Roxb, has been shown to have anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, and anti-viral properties. The key constituent of Curcuma xanthorrhiza Roxb., curcumin, reduces inflammation by up to about 50% and functions as an anti-oxidant. [0008] Physalis minima Linn, of the Solanaceae family, also known as Sunberry, Gooseberry, and Tong Tang, is commonly used in traditional medicine. The fruit is considered to be a tonic, diuretic and purgative in the Punjab (India). The Mundas (a tribe) of Chhota-Nagpur mix the juice of the leaves with water and mustard oil and use it as a remedy against earaches. The Physalis minima plant has appetite stimulating, diuretic, laxative, and anti-inflammatory activities. The plant may also be used to treat enlargement of the spleen and various abdominal conditions. Physalis minima Linn, is commonly found in Thailand, particularly in the provinces of Chiang Mai, Angtong, Nakomsrithummarath, and Mahasarakham. [0009] Stephania rotunda Lour, of the Menispermaceae family is a vined plant, and its common Thai name is Boorapet Pung Chang. Decoction of leaves and roots is taken as an appetite stimulant in traditional medicine. The flowers may be used externally for treating skin diseases such as ringworm and fungus infection. Stephania rotunda Lour, may also be used for ulcer treatment and is generally known to have anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, and anti-inflammatory activities. This plant commonly grows in Southern Thailand. [0010] It would be desirable to have a topical composition comprising a natural plant material to improve the aesthetic appearance of skin. It would also be desirable to have an effective treatment for the dermatological signs of aging. Therefore, safe, effective and new compositions to treat, prevent, reduce, inhibit, and/or improve the dermatological signs of aging, would be advantageous for the formulation of treatments and products for the skin. As described herein, novel and beneficial methods and compositions, as well as their mode of action, for the treatment of wrinkles and the like, as well as for personal care products for the skin, are provided by the present invention. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0011] It is an object of the present invention to provide a topical cosmetic composition that delivers an effective level of an active component from a natural plant material. [0012] It is another object of the present invention to provide a topical cosmetic composition having a natural plant material or blends of natural plant materials in a cosmetically, dermatologically, physiologically, or pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle. [0013] It is a further object of the present invention to provide a topical composition having a natural plant material, or component therefrom, that results in increased expression of genes associated with dermatological signs of chronologically or hormonally- aged or photo-aged skin, such as fine lines, wrinkles, and sagging skin, and other conditions due to a progressive degradation of the dermal-epidermal junction (DEJ) and of the cell-cell cohesion in the epidermis, where the topical composition is a cosmetic product for the face and/or body. [0014] It is yet another embodiment of the invention to provide a method of treating, preventing, and/or ameliorating the appearance of fine lines and/or wrinkles, comprising applying to skin a topical composition having a natural plant material in an amount effective to prevent, ameliorate and/or reduce dermatological signs of chronologically or hormonallyaged or photo-aged skin, such as fine lines, wrinkles, and sagging skin, and other conditions due to a progressive degradation of the dermal-epidermal junction (DEJ) and of the cell-cell cohesion in the epidermis. [0015] It is still a further object of the present invention to provide a topical composition having one or more of the following natural plant materials: Plumbago indica, Cananga odorata, Sapindus rarak, Curcuma xanthorrhiza, Physalis minima, and Stephania rotunda, in an amount effective to treat, prevent, control, ameliorate, inhibit, and/or reduce dermatological signs of chronologically or hormonally- aged or photo-aged skin, such as fine lines, wrinkles, and sagging skin, and other conditions due to a progressive degradation of the dermal-epidermal junction (DEJ) and of the cell-cell cohesion in the epidermis, in order to improve the aesthetic appearance of skin. [0016] Yet another object of the invention provides a topical cosmetic composition having a natural plant ingredient, which increases the expression levels of genes associated with the dermal-epidermal junction of skin, communication between the dermis and epidermis of skin, and mechanical properties of the skin, as well as, cell to cell cohesion in the epidermis of skin, anchoring of the cells of skin, communication between cells of skin, and tissue stability of skin, in order to improve the aesthetic appearance of skin. [0017] These and other objects and advantages of the present invention, and equivalents thereof, are achieved by cosmetic compositions having a natural plant ingredient or blends thereof, and methods of use of such compositions for topical application in order to improve the aesthetic appearance of skin. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION [0018] The present invention relates to topical compositions having an active component derived from a natural plant material. More particularly, one embodiment of the present invention relates to topical compositions having natural plant materials, including components or extracts derived therefrom, or blends of natural plant materials thereof, that improve the aesthetic appearance or condition of the skin and rejuvenate or enhance the skin by providing a variety of anti-aging and skin texture benefits. Improvements in the aesthetic appearance of the skin may be achieved by topical application of these cosmetic compositions to the skin on a daily basis. [0019] One embodiment of the present invention relates to the novel use of natural plant materials, such as but not limited to, those from the Plumbaginaceae (plumbago), Annonaceae (Cananga), Sapindaceae (Sapindus); Zingiberaceae (Curcuma); Solanaceae (Physalis); and Menispermaceae (Stephania) families, or more specifically, the Plumbago indica\ Cananga odorata; Sapindus rarak\ Curcuma xanthorrhiza\ Physalis minima', and Stephania rotunda plants, respectively, in a topical cosmetic composition for application on the face and/or body in order to improve the condition and aesthetic appearance of skin. [0020] In a further embodiment, the topical compositions having a natural plant material, or extract derived therefrom, may be used to treat, prevent, ameliorate, and/or reduce dermatological signs of chronologically aging, which represent the structural, functional, and metabolic changes in the skin that parallel the aging and degenerative changes in other body organs, or photo-aged skin, which is a separate process and largely involves damage to the collagen and elastin fibers in the skin, as fine lines, wrinkles, and sagging skin, and other conditions due to a progressive degradation of the dermal-epidermal junction (DEJ) and of the cell-cell cohesion in the epidermis, in order to improve the condition and aesthetic appearance of skin. [0021] Symptoms of chronological aging include: dry and thin skin, fine wrinkles, abnormal blood vessels, age spots, and benign and malignant skin tumors. Young skin renews itself more frequently than older skin. The top layers thereby lose more moisture due to the aging process, and older skin has a dryer and more dehydrated appearance. Diminished production of collagen leads to fine wrinkles initially observed around the eyes (commonly known as "crow's feet"), forehead, and other sun-exposed areas. More pronounced effects include furrows at the site of facial expression lines and sagging folds over the eyelids, neck, jaw, and arms. Within the many small, delicate blood vessels supplying nutrients to the skin, abnormalities develop. This is particularly conspicuous over the nose and cheeks. Age spots are pigmentations that surfaced as a result of a deregulation of pigment cells in sun-exposed areas. [0022] While genetics play a significant role, the number of wrinkles present is highly dependent on the amount of sun exposure. The lines in a "lived-in face," especially for those who spend a considerable amount of time outdoors, is a consequence in part of oxidative damage due to overexposure to ultraviolet (UV) sunlight - both UVA (responsible for tanning, wrinkling, and melanoma) and UVB (responsible for sunburn and basal and squamous cell carcinoma). UV light may further damage skin by increasing the production of proteolytic enzymes that break down collagen, the connective tissue located beneath the dermis. [0023] The skin is made up of multiple layers of cells that are constantly going through self shedding and regeneration once every 30 days in repeated cycles. The layers may be broadly divided into two sections - the top epidermis and the underlying dermis. Histological studies of the skin show that a wrinkle is formed following a series of major cellular changes. During the early phase of aging (from age 35-45), there is a gradual and progressive slowing of cellular turnover and regeneration. This results in the skin getting thinner. As a result, the normally undulating ridge-like dermal-epidermal junction (DEJ) becomes flatter. This flatness reduces the surface area of nutritional exchange between the underlying dermis on the bottom and the epidermis on top. [0024] Reduced nutrition to the epidermis from aging is one factor that causes cellular exhaustion and weakness. Without proper nutrition to the epidermis, cellular metabolism of the epidermal cell is slowed. Furthermore, the transportation of certain unwanted byproducts of cellular metabolism such as free radicals are reduced. The accumulation of such free radicals within the cell may lead to undesirable mutational damages in the cell and ultimately cancer. [0025] The adhesion in the DEJ is normally supplied by Collagen 4 (a multi-sheet structure or basal layer) and collagen 7 (anchored to the sheets structure). The progressive loss of nutrients to the DEJ slows the circulation of the messengers that serve to promote the neo-synthesis process of such collagen. Without an optimal amount of collagen, the skin sags even more, propagating the dearth of nutrients. Paradoxically, matured aging skin contains more elastin, which the body uses to fill in the empty space left by the deficiency of collagen. Such elastin, unfortunately, is fragmented, calcified, and contains excessive lipids. In addition to the loss of skin thickness due to the lack of collagen support, the aging or aged skin is more loose and lacks elasticity. These two properties are hallmarks of wrinkles. This process of aging and appearance of wrinkles is accelerated during the later phase of aging (age 45 and higher). By age 50, very few women can escape wrinkles. [0026] Embodiments of the invention relate to the discovery that the natural plant materials identified in the present invention diminish skin lines and wrinkles, as well as relieves sagging, or other conditions due to a weakened skin matrix, in a topical cosmetic, composition, or formulation. The composition is preferably applied topically to the affected area of the skin once, twice, or more daily and allowed to remain on the affected area. The daily application may be left on the affected area of the skin for a period of at least one week, but may be for a period of up to two, four, eight, twelve weeks or more to improve the condition and aesthetic appearance of skin. [0027] In particular, the natural plant material, such as but not limited to, Plumbago indica\ Cananga odorata; Sapindus rarak; Curcuma xanthorrhiza\ Physalis minima', and Stephania rotunda, including components or extracts derived therefrom, increase expression of one or more of the following genes: Beta-catenin, Collagen 4, Collagen 7, Frizzled 10, Estrogen Receptor alpha, and Hyaluronic acid synthase, such that when the composition having the natural plant material is administered topically, improves the condition and aesthetic appearance of skin due to dermatological signs of aging by lessening facial lines, wrinkles, and sagging skin. The topical composition is preferably applied and left on the affected area in a daily manner. Topical Composition [0028] For purposes of the invention, the natural plant material may be in any form including, but not limited to, the whole plant, a dried plant, a ground plant, or parts thereof, including but not limited to, seeds, needles, leaves, roots, bark, cones, stems, rhizomes, callus cells, protoplasts, organs and organ systems, and meristems, or components and/or constituents found in, or isolated from, the natural plant material, and/or portions of the plant, or extracts derived either directly or synthetically from the plant, or any combinations thereof. A preferred natural plant material is in the form of an extract derived from the natural plant material. [0029] It is to be understood that “natural plant material” also includes an ingredient, component, constituent, or extract derived from the natural plant material. [0030] In one embodiment of the invention, the topical compositions having a natural plant material selected from one or more of the plants: Plumbago indica\ Cananga odorata; Sapindus rarak; Curcuma xanthorrhiza; Physalis minima', and Stephania rotunda are useful for improving the condition and aesthetic appearance of skin, particularly matured or maturing skin, by any one of the following methods: reducing dermatological signs of chronological aging, photo-aging, hormonal aging, and/or actinic aging; preventing and/or reducing the appearance of lines and/or wrinkles; reducing the noticeability of facial lines and wrinkles, facial wrinkles on the cheeks, forehead, perpendicular wrinkles between the eyes, horizontal wrinkles above the eyes, and around the mouth, marionette lines, and particularly deep wrinkles or creases; preventing, reducing, and/or diminishing the appearance and/or depth of lines and/or wrinkles; improving the appearance of suborbital lines and/or periorbital lines; reducing the appearance of crow’s feet; rejuvenating and/or revitalizing skin, particularly aging skin; reducing skin fragility; preventing and/or reversing of loss of glycosaminoglycans and/or collagen; ameliorating the effects of estrogen imbalance; preventing skin atrophy; preventing, reducing, and/or treating hyperpigmentation; minimizing skin discoloration; improving skin tone, radiance, clarity and/or tautness; preventing, reducing, and/or ameliorating skin sagging; improving skin firmness, plumpness, suppleness and/or softness; improving procollagen and/or collagen production; improving skin texture and/or promoting retexturization; improving skin barrier repair and/or function; improving the appearance of skin contours; restoring skin luster and/or brightness; minimizing dermatological signs of fatigue and/or stress; resisting environmental stress; replenishing ingredients in the skin decreased by aging and/or menopause; improving communication among skin cells; increasing cell proliferation and/or multiplication; increasing skin cell metabolism decreased by aging and/or menopause; retarding cellular aging; improving skin moisturization; enhancing skin thickness; increasing skin elasticity and/or resiliency; enhancing exfoliation; improving microcirculation; decreasing and/or preventing cellulite formation; and any combinations thereof. [0031] As stated above, the preferred natural plant materials for use in the present invention are selected from one or more of the following plants: Plumbago indica; Cananga odorata\ Sapindus rarak; Curcuma xanthorrhiza\ Physalis minima; and Stephania rotunda. However, it is also contemplated that other natural plant materials may work equally as well if they increase expression levels of genes associated with dermatological signs of aging. These genes may include, but are not limited to, Beta-catenin, Collagen 4, Collagen 7, Frizzled 10, Estrogen Receptor alpha, and Hyaluronic acid synthase. [0032] In another embodiment, the composition may have an extract derived from a natural plant material in an amount from about 0.0001% to about 50%, preferably from about 0.001% to about 20%, more preferably from about 0.01% to about 5%, and most preferably from about 0.05% to about 1%, based on the total weight of the composition, where the composition is useful in improving the condition and aesthetic appearance of skin. [0033] The natural plant material is derived from any one, or combinations thereof, of plants: Plumbago indica', Cananga odorata\ Sapindus rarak', Curcuma xanthorrhiza', Physalis minima', and Stephania rotunda, or any natural plant material that increases expression levels of any one, or combinations thereof, of genes: Beta-catenin, Collagen 4, Collagen 7, Frizzled 10, Estrogen Receptor alpha, and Hyaluronic acid synthase. The natural plant materials which increase expression levels of genes associated with dermatological signs of chronologically or hormonally- aged or photo-aged skin, such as fine lines, wrinkles, and sagging skin, and other conditions due to a progressive degradation of the dermal-epidermal junction (DEJ) and of the cell-cell cohesion in the epidermis, in order to improve the condition and aesthetic appearance of skin, and the composition comprising one or more of these plants are effective when topically applied, preferably in a daily manner. Without wishing to be bound by theory, the natural plant materials, which increase gene expression of the aforementioned genes, exert their effects through a mechanism of action involving the dermal-epidermal junction of skin, communication between the dermis and epidermis of skin, and mechanical properties of the skin, as well as, cell to cell cohesion in the epidermis of skin, anchoring of the cells of skin, communication between cells of skin, and tissue stability of skin. Topical application of the plant also facilitates the targeted delivery of the active components without the requirement of an injection or the expertise of a health practitioner. [0034] The active components of the present invention are further useful in treating, which includes preventing, arresting, ameliorating, reducing or diminishing, medical and/or cosmetic conditions of the skin. Such conditions, as used herein, commonly include, but are not limited to, dermatological aging (chronological aging, hormonal aging and/or actinic aging), dermatitis, skin and hair fragility, hirsutism, rosacea, skin blemishes, sensitive skin, hyperpigmentation or hypopigmentation, thinning skin, roughness, keratosis, skin atrophy, wrinkles, lines, hyperplasia, fibrosis, and any combinations thereof. The active components of the present invention may also be useful in enhancing the general health, vitality, condition, and appearance of the skin. [0035] Topical compositions having the aforementioned active components of a natural plant material, where the active components increase expression levels of genes, including, but not limited to: Beta-catenin, Collagen 4, Collagen 7, Frizzled 10, Estrogen Receptor alpha, and Hyaluronic acid synthase, improve the condition, cosmetic, and/or aesthetic appearance of skin. [0036] Wnt proteins form a family of highly conserved secreted signaling molecules that regulate cell-to-cell interactions during embryogenesis. Wnt genes and Wnt signaling are also implicated in cancer. Insights into the mechanisms of Wnt action have emerged from several systems, including, genetics in Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans\ as well as, biochemistry in cell culture and ectopic gene expression in Xenopus embryos. Many Wnt genes in the mouse have been mutated, leading to very specific developmental defects. Wnt proteins bind to receptors of the Frizzled family (FZ) on the cell surface. Through several cytoplasmic relay components, the signal is transduced to beta-catenin, which then enters the nucleus and forms a complex with transcription factor (TCF) to activate transcription of Wnt target genes. [0037] Frizzled (Fz) genes encode a family of Wnt ligand receptors, which have a conserved cysteine-rich Wnt binding domain and include both transmembrane and secreted forms. Disturbing Wnt signaling results in aberrant hair formation, hair growth, and hair structure. Elevated expression of FzlO was confined to developing hair follicles (Reddy, et al. “Expression of Frizzled Genes in Developing and Postnatal Hair Follicles.” Journal of Investigative Dermatology 123 (2), 275-282, 2004). [0038] Beta-catenin is a cytoskeletal component that enters the nucleus to act as a transcriptional cofactor. Phosphorylation of Beta-catenin induces the ubiquitination and proteolytic degradation of beta-catenin by the proteasome. Non-phosphorylated beta-catenin is stable and enters the nucleus to regulate transcription with TCF. The beta-catenin/TCF complex thereby activates genes that promote cellular survival, proliferation and differentiation during development. [0039] Collagen, which has several forms, is a major body protein and accounts for almost 20% of the total protein in the human body. In addition to its critical role in forming support structure of the skin, it is also the main constituent of the extra-cellular matrix. Mutations in Collagen 7 are known to be involved in many types of epidermolysis bullosa, a human skin disease characterized by separation of dermal and epidermal layers (Pulkkinen L, et al. “Mutation analysis and molecular genetics of epidermolysis bullosa.” Matrix Biol 18:29-42, 1999 ). Collagen 4 is associated with extracellular matrix and basement membrane zone formation, which is responsible for epidermal adhesion to the dermis in human skin. [0040] Activation of ERα is responsible for many biological processes, including cell growth and differentiation, morphogenesis and programmed cell death (Katzenellenbogen,B.S. “Estrogen receptors: bioactivities and interactions with cell signaling pathways” Biol. Reprod., 54, 287-293, 1996; Katzenellenbogen, B.S., et al. “Antiestrogens: mechanisms of action and resistance in breast cancer” Breast Cancer Res. Treat., 44, 23-38, 1997 ). In addition, ERα plays an important role in the development and progression of breast cancer by regulating genes and signaling pathways involved in cellular proliferation. [0041] Hyaluronic acid (HA) is a polysaccharide found in the extracellular mactrix of vertebrate tissues and in the surface coating of certain Streptococcus and Pasteurella bacterial pathogens. HA synthases (HASs) are the enzymes that polymerize HA. HA is known to be secreted out of the cell; and accordingly, HASs are normally found in the outer membranes of the organisms. [0042] Increases in expression levels of specific genes associated with the progressive degradation of the dermal-epidermal junction (DEJ), including poor communication between the dermis and epidermis, poor mechanical properties of the skin; and of the cell-cell cohesion, including poor anchoring of the cells, poor cell-cell communication and poor tissue stability, in the epidermis are particularly useful in the topical compositions of the present invention. In one embodiment, the useful genes include, but are not limited to, Beta-catenin, Collagen 4, Collagen 7, Frizzled 10, Estrogen Receptor alpha, and Hyaluronic Acid Synthase. Any natural plant material, including an extract derived therefrom, that increases expression of any one of these genes, is found useful in the topical compositions of the present invention. [0043] Gene expression may be measured by the determination of RNA levels in cultured cells, for example, using techniques such as Northern blot technology and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), e.g., “real time” PCR and reverse transcription PCR (RT PCR) as practiced in the art. (see, e.g., J. Sambrook et al., 1989, Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York; R. Higuchi et al., 1992, Biotechnology, 10:413-417; R. Higuchi et al., 1993.Biotechnology, 11:1026-1030; E.S. Kawasaki, 1990, "Amplification ofRNA”, In: RNA Protocols: A Guide to Methods & Applications, M.A. Innis et al., Academic Press, San Diego, CA, pp. 21-27). In addition, gene expression in skin, skin substitute, or cultured cells may be evaluated using gene (cDNA) arrays (microarrays or nucleic acid genechip test arrays comprising membrane, glass, or plastic support materials), serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE), (e.g., as described by V.E. Velculescu et al„ Science, 270(5235):484-487, 1995; A. Lai et al., Cancer Res,, 59(21):54Q3-5407,1999), or differential display techniques. Example 3 shows the results of gene expression of Beta-catenin, Collagen 4, Collagen 7, Frizzled 10, Estrogen Receptor alpha, and Hyaluronic Acid Synthase upon treatment with natural plant materials. [0044[ The invention encompasses using genes associated with dermatological signs of aging, such as fine lines, wrinkles, and sagging skin as a biomarker for compounds which may improve the condition and appearance of skin, If expression levels of such nucleic acid biomaikers are elevated in the presence of a natural plant material, the natural plant material may be used in a topical composition of the invention for improving the condition and appearance of skin. Such assays embrace a variety of methods for measuring nucleic acid levels in cells that have been exposed to one or more test substances. Suitable methods include detection and evaluation of gene activation or expression of, for example, DNA, RNA, or mKNA, As non-limiting examples, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays (e.g„ RT-PCR), Northern blotting, in situ hybridization, and other assays as known and practiced in the art may be employed to quantify RNA in cells being assayed for tolerance to a particular treatment (see, e.g,, J, O'Connell, 2002, RT-PCR Protocols, Humana Press, Totowa, NJ; R. Rapley and D.L. Manning, 1998, RNA Isolation and Characterization Protocols, Humana Pr℮ss; R, Rapley, 2000, Nucleic Acid Protocols Handbook, Humana Press), In accordance with such assays, if levels of at least one nucleic acid biomarker are elevated in the presence of one or more test substances, this may predict that the substance(s) will improve the dermatological signs of aging. These substances, or natural plant materials, may then be used in a topical composition, preferably applied daily to the skin, in order to treat, prevent, ameliorate, and/or reduce, signs of dermatological aging, especially fine lines, wrinkles, and sagging skin, thereby improving the condition and aesthetic appearance of skin. [0045] In a further embodiment, the natural plant material as used herein, also includes “synthetic” extracts, i.e. various combinations of known the natural plant material components and/or constituents that are combined to substantially mimic the composition and/or activity of the natural plant material. Such synthetic extracts are included in the term “natural plant material extract.” Most preferably, the synthetic extracts have substantially the same number of active components as a natural plant material. The correspondence of the numerical incidence of actives between the synthetic extracts and the natural plant material may also be described in terms of “percent commonality.” [0046] Another embodiment relates to a synthetic extract having about 50 % or more commonality to the chemical composition of a natural plant material. For example, the synthetic extract has about 50 % or more of the active components found in the natural plant material. The chemical composition of the synthetic extract may have about 70 % or more commonality to the chemical composition of the natural plant material. A synthetic extract may have about 90 % or more commonality to the chemical composition of the natural plant material. [0047] For use in the compositions of the invention, the natural plant material and/or active components are derived directly from the natural plant material, including the entire plant, its seeds, needles, leaves, roots, bark, cones, stems, rhizomes, callus cells, protoplasts, organs and organ systems, and meristems. The components may be in a pure form, a semipure form, or unpurified form. The natural plant material in the form of an extract may be obtained by extracting either the entire plant, or various parts thereof, with 80% ethanol. [0048] Briefly, the organic solvent extraction method involves washing and extracting the plant material using an organic solvent. Non-limiting examples of organic solvents include methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, dichloromethane, chloroform, hexane, xylene, and petroleum ether. An extracting machine may be used for organic solvent extraction as is well known in the field. [0049] Organic solvent extraction involves collecting the raw materials from the plant that contain the desired constituent(s), such as seeds, needles, leaves, roots, bark, cones, stems, rhizomes, callus cells, protoplasts, organs and organ systems, and meristems. These plant materials are ground to small particle sizes, and then put into an extracting machine through an inlet for the raw materials by a measurable charging machine. The plant raw material is pushed in the extracting machine by a thruster, and slowly moves the plant raw material forward. Organic solvent (e.g., ethanol) may be added into the machine through a solvent inlet at the top of a waste discharge outlet. Due to the difference in gravity and equilibrium, the solvent flows toward the raw material inlet, soaks the materials and flows out from the opposite side of the solvent inlet. Since the plant materials and the solvent move in opposite directions against each other, the plant materials are constantly immersed in a solution that contains a low-concentration of extract. As a result of equilibrium, high yield of plant constituent(s) may be achieved by continuously extracting the plant material against the low-concentration solution. [0050] An extraction time between about 1 -8 hours is suitable, and more preferably is between about 2-6 hours, and most preferably is between about 3-5 hours. The temperature of extraction is between about 30 °C-90 °C, preferably between about 40 °C-70 °C, and more preferably between about 50 °C-60 °C. The collected extract is then fine-filtered to remove debris, and may be used directly, or is concentrated, for example, by distilling the solvent or by other conventional processing, where the extract may also be provided as a dry powder. [0051] Similarly, aqueous-organic solvent extraction involves initially collecting raw materials from a plant containing the desired alkaloid(s), such as seeds, needles, leaves, roots, bark, cones, stems, rhizomes, callus cells, protoplasts, organs and organ systems, and meristems of the plant, which are ground into small particle sizes. The ground plant material is soaked in aqueous solution that is acidic or alkaline, depending on the solubility and stability of the desired extract under acidic or alkaline (basic) conditions. For extraction under acidic conditions, an acid such as hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid is added to water, e.g., at a concentration of about 3% (w/v). For extraction under alkaline conditions, an alkali such as sodium hydroxide or sodium carbonate is added to water. The extraction time and temperature of extraction are typically similar to that used in the organic solvent extraction method described above. [0052] The extract is then collected and fine-filtered to remove debris. Alkaline agents (e.g., ammonia) or acidifying agents (e.g., sulfuric acid) may be added to the extract to neutralize the solution by adjusting the pH, depending on the acidity or alkalinity of the collected extract. The aqueous extract may be used directly, concentrated or dried. Alternatively, organic solvent may then be added to the neutralized solution to transfer the extract actives from an aqueous phase to an organic phase. Non-limiting examples of such organic solvents include, but are not limited to, ethanol, isopropanol, butanol, pentanol, hexanol and xylene. The extract comprising the transferred extract actives dissolved in organic solvent may be used directly, used as a concentrate, or dried. [0053] Different plants containing different constituents may be mixed and extracted together. This process of mixed extraction may preferably be used for extracting those plants containing constituents having similar solubility in the solvent used for extraction, such as ethanol. The mixture of extracts may be concentrated and stored in an appropriate solvent. Formulations [0054] In accordance with the invention, compositions comprising components from the natural plant material include, but are not limited to, topically applied formulations, antioxidants, anti-inflammatories, sunscreens, cosmetics, including makeup, formulations for reducing dermatological signs of aging, including wrinkles, fine lines, and sagging skin, topicals, skin penetration enhancers, and the like. Also in accordance with this invention, the natural plant material, components, and additional constituents comprising such compositions may be formulated in a variety of product forms. The compositions may be prepared in targeted delivery systems, e.g. creams, lotions, masks, gels, toners, serums, transdermal patches, and the like, particularly for topical administration. Targeted delivery and/or penetration enhancement may also be achieved by iontophoresis. [0055] The present invention further provides the compositions comprising the natural plant materials preferably for topical administration or for targeted delivery without inducing significant irritation. The inventive compositions are suitable for all skin types, such as sensitive, normal, dry, or oily, preferably sensitive to dry skin. In particular embodiments, the compositions may be suitable for dry skin. The compositions are applied to the skin for a period of time sufficient to improve the condition or aesthetic appearance of skin. The topical compositions may be applied topically once, twice, or more daily. The daily application may be applied for a period of one week, two weeks, four weeks, or more. The preferred topical composition or formulation may be applied and left on the affected area once daily. [0056] The topical compositions may be formulated into liposomes which may comprise other additives or substances, and/or which may be modified to more specifically reach or remain at a site following administration. The compositions of embodiments of the present invention yield improvements to the conditions and aesthetic appearance of skin by treating at least one of the previously described conditions, or combinations thereof. [0057] Another embodiment of the invention encompasses compositions comprising a cosmetically or dermatologically acceptable formulation which is suitable for contact with living animal tissue, including human tissue, with virtually no adverse physiological effect to the user. Compositions embraced by this invention can be provided in any cosmetically and/or dermatologically suitable form, preferably as a lotion or cream, but also in an anhydrous or aqueous base, as well as in a sprayable liquid form. Other suitable cosmetic product forms for the compositions of this invention include, for example, an emulsion, a cream, a balm, a gloss, a lotion, a mask, a serum, a toner, an ointment, a mousse, a patch, a pomade, a solution, a spray, a wax-based stick, or a towelette.

[0058] Also, embraced by the invention are transdermal modes of delivery, such as patches and the like, with or without a suitable penetration enhancers. The methods and compositions embodied by the invention provide a means by which the natural plant material components may be effectively administered in a transdermal system. Accordingly, a transdermal means of delivering a composition or formulation (often with a penetration enhancing composition) to the skin is that of the transdermal patch or a similar device as known and described in the art. Examples of such devices are disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,146,846; 5,223,262; 4,820,724; 4,379,454; and 4,956,171. The transdermal mode of storing and delivering the compositions onto the skin, including hair, and forming the active composition is convenient and well-suited for the purposes of an embodiment of the present invention. In a preferred method, the application is through a sustained release vehicle, e.g., a topically applied sustained released patch. Preferably, when a topical patch is used, the patch is applied to the desired area for extended period of time.

The vial was then removed from the water bath and the excess water was wiped off. The vial was placed into a cell culture hood for sterility. The vial was wiped with 70% ethanol to air dry for 30 seconds. While in the cell culture hood, the cells were removed from the vial and placed into a 50 ml tube. The appropriate growth media (5ml) was added drop wise while agitating the tube, allowing uniform mixture of the cells and medium while limiting cell death due to osmotic changes caused by freezing media. Medium (25 ml) was added to the 50 ml tube to bring the volume up to 30 ml. Into two 75 cm2 flasks, medium/cell solution (15 ml) was added, or to six 25 cm2 flasks, medium (5 ml) was added. Flasks were recapped and placed horizontally in a 37°C humidified incubator with 5% CO2 for 24 hours. After 24 hours, the old medium was aspirated and fresh room temperature growth medium (15 ml) was added onto the cells. Prior to adding the fresh growth medium, it was brought up to room temperature using a room temperature water bath without the cover. The flasks containing cells with fresh media were placed back into the 37°C incubator. Flasks containing the old media was replaced with fresh media repeatedly until the desired confluence (75%) was reached. Plating and Treatment [0116] When the cells reached the desired confluency, they were removed from the incubator and the media was aspirated off using a vacuum trap. Hank’s Buffered Saline Solution (HBSS; 10 ml of IX; Mediatech, Inc.; Herndon, VA) was placed into the flask and the entire surface area rinsed. The HBSS was then aspirated. Trypsin (IX; Mediatech, Inc.) was added in a 5 ml volume. The flasks were placed back into the incubator for 8 minutes. The flasks were taken from the incubator and 15 ml of Trypsin Neutralizing Solution (IX; Cascade Biologies; Portland, OR) was added to each flask to neutralize the trypsin. The medium/cell solution was removed from the flasks and placed into a 50 ml polypropylene tube. The cells were spun down using a bench top centrifuge at 1100 rpm for 6 minutes at room temperature. After spinning the cells, they were resuspended in growth medium (Basal Medium: Epilife medium with calcium chloride (Cascade Biologies, Inc.); supplemented with 1% human kératinocyte growth factor (Cascade Biologies); 1 % Penicillin/ Streptomycin (Mediatech, Inc.). The cells were resuspended by pipetting up and down. Cell culture was then placed into 100 mm tissue culture-treated plates in 10 ml volumes for incubation in a 37°C humidified incubator with 5% C02 until 75% confluency is reached. When confluency was reached, medium was removed and replaced with fresh growth medium containing the test active at a specific concentration. Each test active was diluted in growth medium from a 10% stock vial containing a vehicle (i.e., water, ethanol, DMSO) and the test active. Each vehicle was tested along side the test active as a control. The 100 mm tissue culture-treated plates were placed back into the 37°C humidified incubator with 5% C02 for varying amount of times in order to establish a time course for actives being tested. The tissue culture plates were collected at 1 hour, 4 hour, 8 hour, 24 hours, and 32 hours. At each time point, the growth medium was aspirated and the cells were washed with IX Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The IX PBS was removed and the 100 mm tissue culture plates were wrapped in parafilm and stored in -80°C until needed. RNA Isolation [0117] Parafilm was removed from the outside of the 100 mm tissue culture plates and 2 ml of Trizol Reagent (IX; Invitrogen, Corp.; Carlsbad, CA) was added to the cells. The plate was scraped and the solution was placed into 2- 1.7 ml microcentrifuge tubes. Chloroform (250 ml) was added to each tube and vortexed for 15-30 seconds. Each tube was incubated at room temperature (25°C) for 3-5 minutes and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm at 4°C for 10 minutes. The top layer of the solution was removed without disturbing the two bottom layers and placed into a separate 1.7 ml microcentrifuge tube. Ice cold isopropanol (1.0 ml) was added to the tube and incubated on ice for 10-15 minutes. The sample was centrifuged for 15 minutes at 4°C and at 12,000 rpm. Isopropanol was poured off and ice cold 70% ethanol (1 ml) was added to the tube in order to remove the salt precipitate on the RNA sample. The sample was centrifuged for 10 minutes at 4°C and at 12,000 rpm. The 70% ethanol was poured off and ice cold 100% ethanol was added. The sample was centrifuged for 10 minutes at 4°C and at 12,000 rpm. The tube was dried by inverting and removing all of the 100% ethanol from the tube. The tube was stored in -80°C, either diluted in RNase-free water or dried. EXAMPLE 3 PCR GENE EXPRESSION USING PLANT EXTRACTS [0118] Gene expression levels of six different genes associated with dermatological signs of aging, specifically, Beta-catenin, Collagen 4, Collagen 7, Frizzled 10, Estrogen Receptor alpha, and Hyaluronic Acid Synthase, were shown to increase in the presence of one or more of the following plants: Plumbago indica, Cananga odorata, Sapindus rarak, Curcuma xanthorrhizza, Physalis minima, and Stephania rotunda. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay was performed as is commonly practiced in the art (See, e.g., J. Sambrook et al., 1989, Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York ). Specific thermocycle parameters used were as follows: 1 cycle, 1 minute, at 95°C; 40 cycles, 12 seconds, at 95°C; and 1 cycle, 30 seconds, at 60°C in a volume of 50 microliters.
