CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS The present invention claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. §119 of U.S. application Ser. No. 60/753,566, titled “PRODRUGS OF MODULATORS OF ABC TRANSPORTERS” and filed Dec. 22, 2005, the entire contents thereof being incorporated herein by reference. TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to prodrugs of ABC transporters, particularly, CFTR modulators, compositions thereof, and methods therewith. The present invention also relates to methods of treating ABC transporter mediated diseases using such prodrugs. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION ABC transporters are a family of membrane transporter proteins that regulate the transport of a wide variety of pharmacological agents, potentially toxic drugs, and xenobiotics, as well as anions. ABC transporters are homologous membrane proteins that bind and use cellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) for their specific activities. Some of these transporters were discovered as multidrug resistance proteins (like the MDR1-P glycoprotein, or the multidrug resistance protein, MRP1), defending malignant cancer cells against chemotherapeutic agents. To date, 48 ABC Transporters have been identified and grouped into 7 families based on their sequence identity and function. ABC transporters regulate a variety of important physiological roles within the body and provide defense against harmful environmental compounds. Because of this, they represent important potential drug targets for the treatment of diseases associated with defects in the transporter, prevention of drug transport out of the target cell, and intervention in other diseases in which modulation of ABC transporter activity may be beneficial. One member of the ABC transporter family commonly associated with disease is the cAMP/ATP-mediated anion channel, CFTR. CFTR is expressed in a variety of cells types, including absorptive and secretory epithelia cells, where it regulates anion flux across the membrane, as well as the activity of other ion channels and proteins. In epithelia cells, normal functioning of CFTR is critical for the maintenance of electrolyte transport throughout the body, including respiratory and digestive tissue. CFTR is composed of approximately 1480 amino acids that encode a protein made up of a tandem repeat of transmembrane domains, each containing six transmembrane helices and a nucleotide binding domain. The two transmembrane domains are linked by a large, polar, regulatory (R)-domain with multiple phosphorylation sites that regulate channel activity and cellular trafficking. The gene encoding CFTR has been identified and sequenced (See Gregory, R. J. et al. (1990) Nature 347:382-386; Rich, D. P. et al. (1990) Nature 347:358-362), (Riordan, J. R. et al. (1989) Science 245:1066-1073). A defect in this gene causes mutations in CFTR resulting in cystic fibrosis (“CF”), the most common fatal genetic disease in humans. Cystic fibrosis affects approximately one in every 2,500 infants in the United States. Within the general United States population, up to 10 million people carry a single copy of the defective gene without apparent ill effects. In contrast, individuals with two copies of the CF associated gene suffer from the debilitating and fatal effects of CF, including chronic lung disease. In patients with cystic fibrosis, mutations in CFTR endogenously expressed in respiratory epithelia leads to reduced apical anion secretion causing an imbalance in ion and fluid transport. The resulting decrease in anion transport contributes to enhanced mucus accumulation in the lung and the accompanying microbial infections that ultimately cause death in CF patients. In addition to respiratory disease, CF patients typically suffer from gastrointestinal problems and pancreatic insufficiency that, if left untreated, results in death. In addition, the majority of males with cystic fibrosis are infertile and fertility is decreased among females with cystic fibrosis. In contrast to the severe effects of two copies of the CF associated gene, individuals with a single copy of the CF associated gene exhibit increased resistance to cholera and to dehydration resulting from diarrhea—perhaps explaining the relatively high frequency of the CF gene within the population. Sequence analysis of the CFTR gene of CF chromosomes has revealed a variety of disease causing mutations (Cutting, G. R. et al. (1990) Nature 346:366-369; Dean, M. et al. (1990) Cell 61:863:870; and Kerem, B-S. et al. (1989) Science 245:1073-1080; Kerem, B-S et al. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87:8447-8451). To date, >1000 disease causing mutations in the CF gene have been identified (http://www.genet.sickkids.on.ca/cftr/). The most prevalent mutation is a deletion of phenylalanine at position 508 of the CFTR amino acid sequence, and is commonly referred to as ΔF508-CFTR. This mutation occurs in approximately 70% of the cases of cystic fibrosis and is associated with a severe disease. The deletion of residue 508 in ΔF508-CFTR prevents the nascent protein from folding correctly. This results in the inability of the mutant protein to exit the ER, and traffic to the plasma membrane. As a result, the number of channels present in the membrane is far less than observed in cells expressing wild-type CFTR. In addition to impaired trafficking, the mutation results in defective channel gating. Together, the reduced number of channels in the membrane and the defective gating lead to reduced anion transport across epithelia leading to defective ion and fluid transport. (Quinton, P. M. (1990), FASEB J. 4: 2709-2727). Studies have shown, however, that the reduced numbers of ΔF508-CFTR in the membrane are functional, albeit less than wild-type CFTR. (Dalemans et al. (1991), Nature Lond. 354: 526-528; Denning et al., supra; Pasyk and Foskett (1995), J. Cell. Biochem. 270: 12347-50). In addition to ΔF508-CFTR, other disease causing mutations in CFTR that result in defective trafficking, synthesis, and/or channel gating could be up- or down-regulated to alter anion secretion and modify disease progression and/or severity. Although CFTR transports a variety of molecules in addition to anions, it is clear that this role (the transport of anions) represents one element in an important mechanism of transporting ions and water across the epithelium. The other elements include the epithelial Na+ channel, ENaC, Na+/2Cl−/K+ co-transporter, Na+—K+-ATPase pump and the basolateral membrane K+ channels, that are responsible for the uptake of chloride into the cell. These elements work together to achieve directional transport across the epithelium via their selective expression and localization within the cell. Chloride absorption takes place by the coordinated activity of ENaC and CFTR present on the apical membrane and the Na+—K+-ATPase pump and Cl— channels expressed on the basolateral surface of the cell. Secondary active transport of chloride from the luminal side leads to the accumulation of intracellular chloride, which can then passively leave the cell via channels, resulting in a vectorial transport. Arrangement of Na+/2Cl−/K+ co-transporter, Na+—K+-ATPase pump and the basolateral membrane K+ channels on the basolateral surface and CFTR on the luminal side coordinate the secretion of chloride via CFTR on the luminal side. Because water is probably never actively transported itself, its flow across epithelia depends on tiny transepithelial osmotic gradients generated by the bulk flow of sodium and chloride. In addition to cystic fibrosis, modulation of CFTR activity may be beneficial for other diseases not directly caused by mutations in CFTR, such as secretory diseases and other protein folding diseases mediated by CFTR. These include, but are not limited to, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), dry eye disease, and Sjögren's Syndrome. COPD is characterized by airflow limitation that is progressive and not fully reversible. The airflow limitation is due to mucus hypersecretion, emphysema, and bronchiolitis. Activators of mutant or wild-type CFTR offer a potential treatment of mucus hypersecretion and impaired mucociliary clearance that is common in COPD. Specifically, increasing anion secretion across CFTR may facilitate fluid transport into the airway surface liquid to hydrate the mucus and optimized periciliary fluid viscosity. This would lead to enhanced mucociliary clearance and a reduction in the symptoms associated with COPD. Dry eye disease is characterized by a decrease in tear aqueous production and abnormal tear film lipid, protein and mucin profiles. There are many causes of dry eye, some of which include age, Lasik eye surgery, arthritis, medications, chemical/thermal burns, allergies, and diseases, such as cystic fibrosis and Sjögren's syndrome. Increasing anion secretion via CFTR would enhance fluid transport from the corneal endothelial cells and secretory glands surrounding the eye to increase corneal hydration. This would help to alleviate the symptoms associated with dry eye disease. Sjögrens's syndrome is an autoimmune disease in which the immune system attacks moisture-producing glands throughout the body, including the eye, mouth, skin, respiratory tissue, liver, vagina, and gut. Symptoms include dry eye, mouth, and vagina, as well as lung disease. The disease is also associated with rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus, systemic sclerosis, and polymypositis/dermatomyositis. Defective protein trafficking is believed to cause the disease, for which treatment options are limited. Modulators of CFTR activity may hydrate the various organs afflicted by the disease and help to elevate the associated symptoms. As discussed above, it is believed that the deletion of residue 508 in ΔF508-CFTR prevents the nascent protein from folding correctly, resulting in the inability of this mutant protein to exit the ER, and traffic to the plasma membrane. As a result, insufficient amounts of the mature protein are present at the plasma membrane and chloride transport within epithelial tissues is significantly reduced. Infact, this cellular phenomenon of defective ER processing of ABC transporters by the ER machinery, has been shown to be the underlying basis not only for CF disease, but for a wide range of other isolated and inherited diseases. The two ways that the ER machinery can malfunction is either by loss of coupling to ER export of the proteins leading to degradation, or by the ER accumulation of these defective/misfolded proteins [Aridor M, et al., Nature Med., 5(7), pp 745-751 (1999); Shastry, B. S., et al., Neurochem. International, 43, pp 1-7 (2003); Rutishauser, J., et al., Swiss Med Wkly, 132, pp 211-222 (2002); Morello, J P et al., TIPS, 21, pp. 466-469 (2000); Bross P., et al., Human Mut., 14, pp. 186-198 (1999)]. The diseases associated with the first class of ER malfunction are cystic fibrosis (due to misfolded ΔF508-CFTR as discussed above), hereditary emphysema (due to a1-antitrypsin; non Piz variants), hereditary hemochromatosis, hoagulation-fibrinolysis deficiencies, such as protein C deficiency, Type 1 hereditary angioedema, lipid processing deficiencies, such as familial hypercholesterolemia, Type 1 chylomicronemia, abetalipoproteinemia, lysosomal storage diseases, such as I-cell disease/pseudo-Hurler, Mucopolysaccharidoses (due to lysosomal processing enzymes), Sandhof/Tay-Sachs (due to β-hexosaminidase), Crigler-Najjar type II (due to UDP-glucuronyl-sialyc-transferase), polyendocrinopathy/hyperinsulemia, Diabetes mellitus (due to insulin receptor), Laron dwarfism (due to growth hormone receptor), myleoperoxidase deficiency, primary hypoparathyroidism (due to preproparathyroid hormone), melanoma (due to tyrosinase). The diseases associated with the latter class of ER malfunction are Glycanosis CDG type 1, hereditary emphysema (due to al-Antitrypsin (PiZ variant), congenital hyperthyroidism, osteogenesis imperfecta (due to Type I, II, IV procollagen), hereditary hypofibrinogenemia (due to fibrinogen), ACT deficiency (due to α1-antichymotrypsin), Diabetes insipidus (DI), neurophyseal DI (due to vasopvessin hormone/V2-receptor), neprogenic DI (due to aquaporin II), Charcot-Marie Tooth syndrome (due to peripheral myelin protein 22), Perlizaeus-Merzbacher disease, neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (due to PAPP and presenilins), Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, progressive supranuclear plasy, Pick's disease, several polyglutamine neurological disorders such as Huntington, spinocerebullar ataxia type I, spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy, dentatorubal pallidoluysian, and myotonic dystrophy, as well as spongiform encephalopathies, such as hereditary Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (due to prion protein processing defect), Fabry disease (due to lysosomal α-galactosidase A) and Straussler-Scheinker syndrome (due to Prp processing defect). In addition to up-regulation of CFTR activity, reducing anion secretion by CFTR modulators may be beneficial for the treatment of secretory diarrheas, in which epithelial water transport is dramatically increased as a result of secretagogue activated chloride transport. The mechanism involves elevation of cAMP and stimulation of CFTR. Although there are numerous causes of diarrhea, the major consequences of diarrheal diseases, resulting from excessive chloride transport are common to all, and include dehydration, acidosis, impaired growth and death. Acute and chronic diarrheas represent a major medical problem in many areas of the world. Diarrhea is both a significant factor in malnutrition and the leading cause of death (5,000,000 deaths/year) in children less than five years old. Secretory diarrheas are also a dangerous condition in patients of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). 16 million travelers to developing countries from industrialized nations every year develop diarrhea, with the severity and number of cases of diarrhea varying depending on the country and area of travel. Diarrhea in barn animals and pets such as cows, pigs and horses, sheep, goats, cats and dogs, also known as scours, is a major cause of death in these animals. Diarrhea can result from any major transition, such as weaning or physical movement, as well as in response to a variety of bacterial or viral infections and generally occurs within the first few hours of the animal's life. The most common diarrheal causing bacteria is enterotoxogenic E. coli (ETEC) having the K99 pilus antigen. Common viral causes of diarrhea include rotavirus and coronavirus. Other infectious agents include cryptosporidium, giardia lamblia, and salmonella, among others. Symptoms of rotaviral infection include excretion of watery feces, dehydration and weakness. Coronavirus causes a more severe illness in the newborn animals, and has a higher mortality rate than rotaviral infection. Often, however, a young animal may be infected with more than one virus or with a combination of viral and bacterial microorganisms at one time. This dramatically increases the severity of the disease. Accordingly, there is a need for modulators of CFTR activity, and compositions thereof, that can be used to modulate the activity CFTR in the cell membrane of a mammal. There is a need for prodrugs of such modulators that provide therapeutically sufficient amounts of the modulators in vivo.

As described above, the pharmaceutically acceptable compositions of the present invention additionally comprise a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, adjuvant, or vehicle, which, as used herein, includes any and all solvents, diluents, or other liquid vehicle, dispersion or suspension aids, surface active agents, isotonic agents, thickening or emulsifying agents, preservatives, solid binders, lubricants and the like, as suited to the particular dosage form desired. Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Sixteenth Edition, E. W. Martin (Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa., 1980) discloses various carriers used in formulating pharmaceutically acceptable compositions and known techniques for the preparation thereof. Except insofar as any conventional carrier medium is incompatible with the compounds of the invention, such as by producing any undesirable biological effect or otherwise interacting in a deleterious manner with any other component(s) of the pharmaceutically acceptable composition, its use is contemplated to be within the scope of this invention. Some examples of materials which can serve as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include, but are not limited to, ion exchangers, alumina, aluminum stearate, lecithin, serum proteins, such as human serum albumin, buffer substances such as phosphates, glycine, sorbic acid, or potassium sorbate, partial glyceride mixtures of saturated vegetable fatty acids, water, salts or electrolytes, such as protamine sulfate, disodium hydrogen phosphate, potassium hydrogen phosphate, sodium chloride, zinc salts, colloidal silica, magnesium trisilicate, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, polyacrylates, waxes, polyethylene-polyoxypropylene-block polymers, wool fat, sugars such as lactose, glucose and sucrose; starches such as corn starch and potato starch; cellulose and its derivatives such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose and cellulose acetate; powdered tragacanth; malt; gelatin; talc; excipients such as cocoa butter and suppository waxes; oils such as peanut oil, cottonseed oil; safflower oil; sesame oil; olive oil; corn oil and soybean oil; glycols; such a propylene glycol or polyethylene glycol; esters such as ethyl oleate and ethyl laurate; agar; buffering agents such as magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide; alginic acid; pyrogen-free water; isotonic saline; Ringer's solution; ethyl alcohol, and phosphate buffer solutions, as well as other non-toxic compatible lubricants such as sodium lauryl sulfate and magnesium stearate, as well as coloring agents, releasing agents, coating agents, sweetening, flavoring and perfuming agents, preservatives and antioxidants can also be present in the composition, according to the judgment of the formulator.

According to an alternative preferred embodiment, the present invention provides a method of treating cystic fibrosis comprising the step of administering to said mammal a composition comprising the step of administering to said mammal an effective amount of a composition comprising a compound of the present invention. According to the invention an “effective amount” of the compound or pharmaceutically acceptable composition is that amount effective for treating or lessening the severity of one or more of cystic fibrosis, hereditary emphysema, hereditary hemochromatosis, coagulation-fibrinolysis deficiencies, such as protein C deficiency, Type 1 hereditary angioedema, lipid processing deficiencies, such as familial hypercholesterolemia, Type 1 chylomicronemia, abetalipoproteinemia, lysosomal storage diseases, such as I-cell disease/pseudo-Hurler, mucopolysaccharidoses, Sandhof/Tay-Sachs, Crigler-Najjar type II, polyendocrinopathy/hyperinsulemia, Diabetes mellitus, Laron dwarfism, myleoperoxidase deficiency, primary hypoparathyroidism, melanoma, glycanosis CDG type 1, congenital hyperthyroidism, osteogenesis imperfecta, hereditary hypofibrinogenemia, ACT deficiency, Diabetes insipidus (DI), neurophyseal DI, neprogenic DI, Charcot-Marie Tooth syndrome, Perlizaeus-Merzbacher disease, neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, progressive supranuclear plasy, Pick's disease, several polyglutamine neurological disorders such as Huntington, spinocerebullar ataxia type I, spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy, dentatorubal pallidoluysian, and myotonic dystrophy, as well as spongiform encephalopathies, such as hereditary Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (due to prion protein processing defect), Fabry disease, Straussler-Scheinker syndrome, COPD, dry-eye disease, or Sjogren's disease. The compounds and compositions, according to the method of the present invention, may be administered using any amount and any route of administration effective for treating or lessening the severity of one or more of cystic fibrosis, hereditary emphysema, hereditary hemochromatosis, coagulation-fibrinolysis deficiencies, such as protein C deficiency, Type 1 hereditary angioedema, lipid processing deficiencies, such as familial hypercholesterolemia, Type 1 chylomicronemia, abetalipoproteinemia, lysosomal storage diseases, such as I-cell disease/pseudo-Hurler, mucopolysaccharidoses, Sandhof/Tay-Sachs, Crigler-Najjar type II, polyendocrinopathy/hyperinsulemia, Diabetes mellitus, Laron dwarfism, myleoperoxidase deficiency, primary hypoparathyroidism, melanoma, glycanosis CDG type 1, congenital hyperthyroidism, osteogenesis imperfecta, hereditary hypofibrinogenemia, ACT deficiency, Diabetes insipidus (DI), neurophyseal DI, neprogenic DI, Charcot-Marie Tooth syndrome, Perlizaeus-Merzbacher disease, neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, progressive supranuclear plasy, Pick's disease, several polyglutamine neurological disorders such as Huntington, spinocerebullar ataxia type I, spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy, dentatorubal pallidoluysian, and myotonic dystrophy, as well as spongiform encephalopathies, such as hereditary Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (due to prion protein processing defect), Fabry disease, Straussler-Scheinker syndrome, COPD, dry-eye disease, or Sjogren's disease. In one embodiment, the compounds and compositions of the present invention are useful for treating or lessening the severity of cystic fibrosis in a patient. In certain embodiments, the compounds and compositions of the present invention are useful for treating or lessening the severity of cystic fibrosis in patients who exhibit residual ABC transporter activity in the apical membrane of respiratory and non-respiratory epithelia. The presence of residual ABC transporter activity at the epithelial surface can be readily detected using methods known in the art, e.g., standard electrophysiological, biochemical, or histochemical techniques. Such methods identify ABC transporter activity using in vivo or ex vivo electrophysiological techniques, measurement of sweat or salivary Cl− concentrations, or ex vivo biochemical or histochemical techniques to monitor cell surface density. E.g., using such methods, residual ABC transporter activity can be readily detected in patients heterozygous or homozygous for a variety of different mutations, including patients homozygous or heterozygous for the most common mutation, ΔF508. In another embodiment, the compounds and compositions of the present invention are useful for treating or lessening the severity of cystic fibrosis in patients who have residual CFTR activity induced or augmented using pharmacological methods or gene therapy. Such methods increase the amount of CFTR present at the cell surface, thereby inducing a hitherto absent CFTR activity in a patient or augmenting the existing level of residual CFTR activity in a patient. In one embodiment, the compounds and compositions of the present invention are useful for treating or lessening the severity of cystic fibrosis in patients within certain genotypes exhibiting residual CFTR activity, e.g., class III mutations (impaired regulation or gating), class IV mutations (altered conductance), or class V mutations (reduced synthesis) (Lee R. Choo-Kang, Pamela L., Zeitlin, Type I, II, III, IV, and V cystic fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator Defects and Opportunities of Therapy; Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine 6:521-529, 2000). Other patient genotypes that exhibit residual CFTR activity include patients homozygous for one of these classes or heterozygous with any other class of mutations, including class I mutations, class II mutations, or a mutation that lacks classification. In one embodiment, the compounds and compositions of the present invention are useful for treating or lessening the severity of cystic fibrosis in patients within certain clinical phenotypes, e.g., a moderate to mild clinical phenotype that typically correlates with the amount of residual CFTR activity in the apical membrane of epithelia. Such phenotypes include patients exhibiting pancreatic sufficiency or patients diagnosed with idiopathic pancreatitis and congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens, or mild lung disease. The exact amount required will vary from subject to subject, depending on the species, age, and general condition of the subject, the severity of the infection, the particular agent, its mode of administration, and the like. The compounds of the invention are preferably formulated in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. The expression “dosage unit form” as used herein refers to a physically discrete unit of agent appropriate for the patient to be treated. It will be understood, however, that the total daily usage of the compounds and compositions of the present invention will be decided by the attending physician within the scope of sound medical judgment. The specific effective dose level for any particular patient or organism will depend upon a variety of factors including the disorder being treated and the severity of the disorder; the activity of the specific compound employed; the specific composition employed; the age, body weight, general health, sex and diet of the patient; the time of administration, route of administration, and rate of excretion of the specific compound employed; the duration of the treatment; drugs used in combination or coincidental with the specific compound employed, and like factors well known in the medical arts. The term “patient”, as used herein, means an animal, preferably a mammal, and most preferably a human. The pharmaceutically acceptable compositions of this invention can be administered to humans and other animals orally, rectally, parenterally, intracisternally, intravaginally, intraperitoneally, topically (as by powders, ointments, or drops), bucally, as an oral or nasal spray, or the like, depending on the severity of the infection being treated. In certain embodiments, the compounds of the invention may be administered orally or parenterally at dosage levels of about 0.01 mg/kg to about 50 mg/kg and preferably from about 1 mg/kg to about 25 mg/kg, of subject body weight per day, one or more times a day, to obtain the desired therapeutic effect. Liquid dosage forms for oral administration include, but are not limited to, pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, microemulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and elixirs. In addition to the active compounds, the liquid dosage forms may contain inert diluents commonly used in the art such as, for example, water or other solvents, solubilizing agents and emulsifiers such as ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, dimethylformamide, oils (in particular, cottonseed, groundnut, corn, germ, olive, castor, and sesame oils), glycerol, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, polyethylene glycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan, and mixtures thereof. Besides inert diluents, the oral compositions can also include adjuvants such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, sweetening, flavoring, and perfuming agents. Injectable preparations, for example, sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspensions may be formulated according to the known art using suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution, suspension or emulsion in a nontoxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, for example, as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution, U.S.P. and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil can be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid are used in the preparation of injectables. The injectable formulations can be sterilized, for example, by filtration through a bacterial-retaining filter, or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid compositions which can be dissolved or dispersed in sterile water or other sterile injectable medium prior to use. In order to prolong the effect of a compound of the present invention, it is often desirable to slow the absorption of the compound from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. This may be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or amorphous material with poor water solubility. The rate of absorption of the compound then depends upon its rate of dissolution that, in turn, may depend upon crystal size and crystalline form. Alternatively, delayed absorption of a parenterally administered compound form is accomplished by dissolving or suspending the compound in an oil vehicle. Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsule matrices of the compound in biodegradable polymers such as polylactide-polyglycolide. Depending upon the ratio of compound to polymer and the nature of the particular polymer employed, the rate of compound release can be controlled. Examples of other biodegradable polymers include poly(orthoesters) and poly(anhydrides). Depot injectable formulations are also prepared by entrapping the compound in liposomes or microemulsions that are compatible with body tissues. Compositions for rectal or vaginal administration are preferably suppositories which can be prepared by mixing the compounds of this invention with suitable non-irritating excipients or carriers such as cocoa butter, polyethylene glycol or a suppository wax which are solid at ambient temperature but liquid at body temperature and therefore melt in the rectum or vaginal cavity and release the active compound. Solid dosage forms for oral administration include capsules, tablets, pills, powders, and granules. In such solid dosage forms, the active compound is mixed with at least one inert, pharmaceutically acceptable excipient or carrier such as sodium citrate or dicalcium phosphate and/or a) fillers or extenders such as starches, lactose, sucrose, glucose, mannitol, and silicic acid, b) binders such as, for example, carboxymethylcellulose, alginates, gelatin, polyvinylpyrrolidinone, sucrose, and acacia, c) humectants such as glycerol, d) disintegrating agents such as agar-agar, calcium carbonate, potato or tapioca starch, alginic acid, certain silicates, and sodium carbonate, e) solution retarding agents such as paraffin, f) absorption accelerators such as quaternary ammonium compounds, g) wetting agents such as, for example, cetyl alcohol and glycerol monostearate, h) absorbents such as kaolin and bentonite clay, and i) lubricants such as talc, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, solid polyethylene glycols, sodium lauryl sulfate, and mixtures thereof. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the dosage form may also comprise buffering agents. Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in soft and hard-filled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugar as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols and the like. The solid dosage forms of tablets, dragees, capsules, pills, and granules can be prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical formulating art. They may optionally contain opacifying agents and can also be of a composition that they release the active ingredient(s) only, or preferentially, in a certain part of the intestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions that can be used include polymeric substances and waxes. Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in soft and hard-filled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugar as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols and the like. The active compounds can also be in microencapsulated form with one or more excipients as noted above. The solid dosage forms of tablets, dragees, capsules, pills, and granules can be prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric coatings, release controlling coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical formulating art. In such solid dosage forms the active compound may be admixed with at least one inert diluent such as sucrose, lactose or starch. Such dosage forms may also comprise, as is normal practice, additional substances other than inert diluents, e.g., tableting lubricants and other tableting aids such a magnesium stearate and microcrystalline cellulose. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the dosage forms may also comprise buffering agents. They may optionally contain opacifying agents and can also be of a composition that they release the active ingredient(s) only, or preferentially, in a certain part of the intestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions that can be used include polymeric substances and waxes. Dosage forms for topical or transdermal administration of a compound of this invention include ointments, pastes, creams, lotions, gels, powders, solutions, sprays, inhalants or patches. The active component is admixed under sterile conditions with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and any needed preservatives or buffers as may be required. Ophthalmic formulation, eardrops, and eye drops are also contemplated as being within the scope of this invention. Additionally, the present invention contemplates the use of transdermal patches, which have the added advantage of providing controlled delivery of a compound to the body. Such dosage forms are prepared by dissolving or dispensing the compound in the proper medium. Absorption enhancers can also be used to increase the flux of the compound across the skin. The rate can be controlled by either providing a rate controlling membrane or by dispersing the compound in a polymer matrix or gel. As described generally above, the compounds of the invention are useful as prodrugs of modulators of ABC transporters. Thus, without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, the compounds and compositions are particularly useful for treating or lessening the severity of a disease, condition, or disorder where hyperactivity or inactivity of ABC transporters is implicated in the disease, condition, or disorder. When hyperactivity or inactivity of ABC transporters is implicated in a particular disease, condition, or disorder, the disease, condition, or disorder may also be referred to as a “ABC transporters-mediated disease, condition or disorder”. Accordingly, in another aspect, the present invention provides a method for treating or lessening the severity of a disease, condition, or disorder where hyperactivity or inactivity of ABC transporters is implicated in the disease state. In one embodiment, said ABC transporter is CFTR. It will also be appreciated that the prodrugs and pharmaceutically acceptable compositions of the present invention can be employed in combination therapies, that is, the compounds and pharmaceutically acceptable compositions can be administered concurrently with, prior to, or subsequent to, one or more other desired therapeutics or medical procedures. The particular combination of therapies (therapeutics or procedures) to employ in a combination regimen will take into account compatibility of the desired therapeutics and/or procedures and the desired therapeutic effect to be achieved. It will also be appreciated that the therapies employed may achieve a desired effect for the same disorder (for example, an inventive compound may be administered concurrently with another agent used to treat the same disorder), or they may achieve different effects (e.g., control of any adverse effects). As used herein, additional therapeutic agents that are normally administered to treat or prevent a particular disease, or condition, are known as “appropriate for the disease, or condition, being treated”. In one embodiment, the additional agent is selected from a mucolytic agent, bronchodialator, an anti-biotic, an anti-infective agent, an anti-inflammatory agent, an ABC transporter modulator other than a compound of the present invention, or a nutritional agent. The amount of additional therapeutic agent present in the compositions of this invention will be no more than the amount that would normally be administered in a composition comprising that therapeutic agent as the only active agent. Preferably the amount of additional therapeutic agent in the presently disclosed compositions will range from about 50% to 100% of the amount normally present in a composition comprising that agent as the only therapeutically active agent. The compounds of this invention or pharmaceutically acceptable compositions thereof may also be incorporated into compositions for coating an implantable medical device, such as prostheses, artificial valves, vascular grafts, stents and catheters. Accordingly, the present invention, in another aspect, includes a composition for coating an implantable device comprising a compound of the present invention as described generally above, and in classes and subclasses herein, and a carrier suitable for coating said implantable device. In still another aspect, the present invention includes an implantable device coated with a composition comprising a compound of the present invention as described generally above, and in classes and subclasses herein, and a carrier suitable for coating said implantable device. Suitable coatings and the general preparation of coated implantable devices are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,099,562; 5,886,026; and 5,304,121. The coatings are typically biocompatible polymeric materials such as a hydrogel polymer, polymethyldisiloxane, polycaprolactone, polyethylene glycol, polylactic acid, ethylene vinyl acetate, and mixtures thereof. The coatings may optionally be further covered by a suitable topcoat of fluorosilicone, polysaccarides, polyethylene glycol, phospholipids or combinations thereof to impart controlled release characteristics in the composition. In order that the invention described herein may be more fully understood, the following examples are set forth. It should be understood that these examples are for illustrative purposes only and are not to be construed as limiting this invention in any manner.

Assays for Detecting and Measuring ΔF508-CFTR Activity of Compounds I) Membrane Potential Optical Methods for Assaying ΔF508-CFTR Modulation Properties of Compounds The optical membrane potential assay utilized voltage-sensitive FRET sensors described by Gonzalez and Tsien (See, Gonzalez, J. E. and R. Y. Tsien (1995) “Voltage sensing by fluorescence resonance energy transfer in single cells” Biophys J 69(4): 1272-80, and Gonzalez, J. E. and R. Y. Tsien (1997) “Improved indicators of cell membrane potential that use fluorescence resonance energy transfer” Chem Biol 4(4): 269-77) in combination with instrumentation for measuring fluorescence changes such as the Voltage/Ion Probe Reader (VIPR) (See, Gonzalez, J. E., K. Oades, et al. (1999) “Cell-based assays and instrumentation for screening ion-channel targets” Drug Discov Today 4(9): 431-439). These voltage sensitive assays are based on the change in fluorescence resonant energy transfer (FRET) between the membrane-soluble, voltage-sensitive dye, DiSBAC2(3), and a fluorescent phospholipid, CC2-DMPE, which is attached to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane and acts as a FRET donor. Changes in membrane potential (Vm) cause the negatively charged DiSBAC2(3) to redistribute across the plasma membrane and the amount of energy transfer from CC2-DMPE changes accordingly. The changes in fluorescence emission were monitored using VIPR which is an integrated liquid handler and fluorescent detector designed to conduct cell-based screens in 96- or 384-well microtiter plates. Identification of Potentiator Compounds To identify potentiators of ΔF508-CFTR, a double-addition HTS assay format was developed. During the first addition, a Cl−-free medium with or without test compound was added to each well. After 22 sec, a second addition of Cl−-free medium containing 2-10 μM forskolin was added to activate ΔF508-CFTR. The extracellular CF concentration following both additions was 28 mM, which promoted CF efflux in response to ΔF508-CFTR activation and the resulting membrane depolarization was optically monitored using the FRET-based voltage-sensor dyes. Solutions Bath Solution #1: (in mM) NaCl 160, KCl 4.5, CaCl2 2, MgCl2 1, HEPES 10, pH 7.4 with NaOH. Chloride-free bath solution: Chloride salts in Bath Solution #1 are substituted with gluconate salts. CC2-DMPE: Prepared as a 10 mM stock solution in DMSO and stored at −20° C. DiSBAC2(3): Prepared as a 10 mM stock in DMSO and stored at −20° C. Cell Culture NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts stably expressing ΔF508-CFTR are used for optical measurements of membrane potential. The cells are maintained at 37° C. in 5% CO2 and 90% humidity in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 mM glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum, 1×NEAA, β-ME, 1× pen/strep, and 25 mM HEPES in 175 cm2 culture flasks. For all optical assays, the cells were seeded at 30,000/well in 384-well matrigel-coated plates and cultured for 2 hrs at 37° C. before culturing at 27° C. for 24 hrs. for the potentiator assay. For the correction assays, the cells are cultured at 27° C. or 37° C. with and without compounds for 16-24 hours B) Electrophysiological Assays for assaying ΔF508-CFTR modulation properties of compounds II. Ussing Chamber Assay Ussing chamber experiments were performed on polarized epithelial cells expressing ΔF508-CFTR to further characterize the ΔF508-CFTR modulators identified in the optical assays. FRTΔF508-CFTR epithelial cells grown on Costar Snapwell cell culture inserts were mounted in an Ussing chamber (Physiologic Instruments, Inc., San Diego, Calif.), and the monolayers were continuously short-circuited using a Voltage-clamp System (Department of Bioengineering, University of Iowa, IA, and, Physiologic Instruments, Inc., San Diego, Calif.). Transepithelial resistance was measured by applying a 2-mV pulse. Under these conditions, the FRT epithelia demonstrated resistances of 4 KΩ/cm2 or more. The solutions were maintained at 27° C. and bubbled with air. The electrode offset potential and fluid resistance were corrected using a cell-free insert. Under these conditions, the current reflects the flow of Cl− through ΔF508-CFTR expressed in the apical membrane. The ISC was digitally acquired using an MP100A-CE interface and AcqKnowledge software (ν3.2.6; BIOPAC Systems, Santa Barbara, Calif.). Identification of Potentiator Compounds Typical protocol utilized a basolateral to apical membrane Cl− concentration gradient. To set up this gradient, normal ringers was used on the basolateral membrane and was permeabilized with nystatin (360 μg/ml), whereas apical NaCl was replaced by equimolar sodium gluconate (titrated to pH 7.4 with NaOH) to give a large Cl− concentration gradient across the epithelium. All experiments were performed 30 min after nystatin permeabilization. Forskolin (10 μM) and all test compounds were added to both sides of the cell culture inserts. The efficacy of the putative ΔF508-CFTR potentiators was compared to that of the known potentiator, genistein. Solutions Basolateral solution (in mM): NaCl (135), CaCl2 (1.2), MgCl2 (1.2), K2HPO4 (2.4), KHPO4 (0.6), N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N′-2-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) (10), and dextrose (10). The solution was titrated to pH 7.4 with NaOH. Apical solution (in mM): Same as basolateral solution with NaCl replaced with Na Gluconate (135). Cell Culture Fisher rat epithelial (FRT) cells expressing ΔF508-CFTR (FRTΔF508-CFTR) were used for Ussing chamber experiments for the putative ΔF508-CFTR modulators identified from our optical assays. The cells were cultured on Costar Snapwell cell culture inserts and cultured for five days at 37° C. and 5% CO2 in Coon's modified Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Prior to use for characterizing the potentiator activity of compounds, the cells were incubated at 27° C. for 16-48 hrs to correct for the ΔF508-CFTR. To determine the activity of corrections compounds, the cells were incubated at 27° C. or 37° C. with and without the compounds for 24 hours. III. Whole-Cell Recordings The macroscopic ΔF508-CFTR current (IΔF508) in temperature- and test compound-corrected NIH3T3 cells stably expressing ΔF508-CFTR were monitored using the perforated-patch, whole-cell recording. Briefly, voltage-clamp recordings of IΔF508 were performed at room temperature using an Axopatch 200B patch-clamp amplifier (Axon Instruments Inc., Foster City, Calif.). All recordings were acquired at a sampling frequency of 10 kHz and low-pass filtered at 1 kHz. Pipettes had a resistance of 5-6 MΩ when filled with the intracellular solution. Under these recording conditions, the calculated reversal potential for Cl− (ECl) at room temperature was −28 mV. All recordings had a seal resistance >20 GΩ and a series resistance <15Ω. Pulse generation, data acquisition, and analysis were performed using a PC equipped with a Digidata 1320 A/D interface in conjunction with Clampex 8 (Axon Instruments Inc.). The bath contained <250 μl of saline and was continuously perifused at a rate of 2 ml/min using a gravity-driven perfusion system. The ability of ΔF508-CFTR potentiators to increase the macroscopic ΔF508-CFTR Cl− current (IΔF508) in NIH3T3 cells stably expressing ΔF508-CFTR was also investigated using perforated-patch-recording techniques. The potentiators identified from the optical assays evoked a dose-dependent increase in IΔF508 with similar potency and efficacy observed in the optical assays. In all cells examined, the reversal potential before and during potentiator application was around −30 mV, which is the calculated ECl (−28 mV). Solutions Intracellular solution (in mM): Cs-aspartate (90), CsCl (50), MgCl2 (1), HEPES (10), and 240 μg/ml amphotericin-B (pH adjusted to 7.35 with CsOH). Extracellular solution (in mM): N-methyl-n-glucamine (NMDG)-Cl (150), MgCl2 (2), CaCl2 (2), HEPES (10) (pH adjusted to 7.35 with HCl). Cell Culture NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts stably expressing ΔF508-CFTR are used for whole-cell recordings. The cells are maintained at 37° C. in 5% CO2 and 90% humidity in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 mM glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum, 1×NEAA, β-ME, 1×pen/strep, and 25 mM HEPES in 175 cm2 culture flasks. For whole-cell recordings, 2,500-5,000 cells were seeded on poly-L-lysine-coated glass coverslips and cultured for 24-48 hrs at 27° C. before use to test the activity of potentiators; and incubated with or without the correction compound at 37° C. for measuring the activity of correctors. IV. Single-Channel Recordings The single-channel activities of temperature-corrected ΔF508-CFTR stably expressed in NIH3T3 cells and activities of potentiator compounds were observed using excised inside-out membrane patch. Briefly, voltage-clamp recordings of single-channel activity were performed at room temperature with an Axopatch 200B patch-clamp amplifier (Axon Instruments Inc.). All recordings were acquired at a sampling frequency of 10 kHz and low-pass filtered at 400 Hz. Patch pipettes were fabricated from Corning Kovar Sealing #7052 glass (World Precision Instruments, Inc., Sarasota, Fla.) and had a resistance of 5-8 MO when filled with the extracellular solution. The ΔF508-CFTR was activated after excision, by adding 1 mM Mg-ATP, and 75 nM of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase, catalytic subunit (PKA; Promega Corp. Madison, Wis.). After channel activity stabilized, the patch was perifused using a gravity-driven microperfusion system. The inflow was placed adjacent to the patch, resulting in complete solution exchange within 1-2 sec. To maintain ΔF508-CFTR activity during the rapid perifusion, the nonspecific phosphatase inhibitor F− (10 mM NaF) was added to the bath solution. Under these recording conditions, channel activity remained constant throughout the duration of the patch recording (up to 60 min). Currents produced by positive charge moving from the intra- to extracellular solutions (anions moving in the opposite direction) are shown as positive currents. The pipette potential (Vp) was maintained at 80 mV. Channel activity was analyzed from membrane patches containing ≦2 active channels. The maximum number of simultaneous openings determined the number of active channels during the course of an experiment. To determine the single-channel current amplitude, the data recorded from 120 sec of ΔF508-CFTR activity was filtered “off-line” at 100 Hz and then used to construct all-point amplitude histograms that were fitted with multigaussian functions using Bio-Patch Analysis software (Bio-Logic Comp. France). The total microscopic current and open probability (Po) were determined from 120 sec of channel activity. The Po was determined using the Bio-Patch software or from the relationship Po=1/i(N), where I=mean current, i=single-channel current amplitude, and N=number of active channels in patch. Solutions Extracellular solution (in mM): NMDG (150), aspartic acid (150), CaCl2 (5), MgCl2 (2), and HEPES (10) (pH adjusted to 7.35 with Tris base).
