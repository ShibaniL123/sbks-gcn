COMPOUNDS AND USES THEREOF FOR THE MODULATION OF HEMOGLOBIN FIELD OF THE INVENTION [0001] This invention provides compounds and pharmaceutical compositions suitable as allosteric modulators of hemoglobin, methods and intermediates for their preparation, and methods for their use in treating disorders mediated by hemoglobin and disorders that would benefit from tissue and/or cellular oxygenation. STATE OF THE ART [0002] Sickle cell disease is a disorder of the red blood cells, found particularly among those of African and Mediterranean descent. The basis for sickle cell disease is found in sickle hemoglobin (HbS), which contains a point mutation relative to the prevalent peptide sequence of hemoglobin (Hb). [0003] Hemoglobin (Hb) transports oxygen molecules from the lungs to various tissues and organs throughout the body. Hemoglobin binds and releases oxygen through conformational changes. Sickle hemoglobin (HbS) contains a point mutation where glutamic acid is replaced with valine, allowing HbS to become susceptible to polymerization to give the HbS containing red blood cells their characteristic sickle shape. The sickled cells are also more rigid than normal red blood cells, and their lack of flexibility can lead to blockage of blood vessels. US 7, 160,910 discloses compounds that are allosteric modulators of hemoglobin. However, a need exists for additional therapeutics that can treat disorders that are mediated by Hb or by abnormal Hb such as HbS.

General Synthetic Scheme 1Α [0099] General method A for preparing aryloxy ether analogs (4a) from substituted methylene alcohol (1) and hydroxyl aryl aldehyde derivative (3a). A hydroxyl arylaldehyde derivative (3a) (0.1-2 mmol) mixture with substituted methylene alcohol (1) (0.8 to 1.2eq) and PPh3 (1-1.5eq) in anhydrous THF (1-lOmL) was stirred under nitrogen until complete dissolution. The solution was cooled to 0 °C on ice bath and DIAD or DEAD (1.1 eq) in THF or toluene was added dropwise over a 1-20 min period. The ice cooling bath was allowed to expire over 90 min and the mixture was stirred at RT for 2-48 hours. The mixture was stirred for 10 min, then filtered through a pad of silica. The silica was washed with ethyl acetate 2-20mL. The combined filtrates were evaporated and the residue was dried on highvac. The residue was purified by preparative HPLC or flash silica gel chromatography. [0100] General method Β for preparing aryloxy ether analogs (4a) from substituted methylene halide (2) and hydroxyl aryl aldehyde derivatives (3a). A mixture of hydroxyl arylaldehyde derivatives (3a) (0.1-2 mmol, 1-4 eq.), substituted methylene chloride or bromide (2) (leq), and K2C03 (2-5 eq.) (catalytic amount of Nal or Bu4NI may also be added) in DMF or acetonitrile (1 to 10 mL) was stirred at RT or heating up to 120 °C for 0.5-8 h under nitrogen atmosphere. In workup A, water was added to the reaction mixture, the precipitated product was collected, washed with water, and then subjected to preparative HPLC or flash silica gel chromatography purification. In workup Β (for products that did not precipitate), diluted HCI or aqueous NH4CI was added at 0 °C to adjusted the pH to ~7, the reaction mixture was partitioned between ethyl acetate or dichloromethane and aqueous sodium chloride and the organic layer separated, dried, and solvent removed under vacuum to afford crude product which was purified by automated silica gel column chromatography using appropriate solvents mixture (e.g., ethyl acetate/hexanes). [0101] General method C for preparing substituted methylene chloride (2a). To a solution of substituted methylene alcohol (1) (0.1 to 2 mmol) in DCM (1-10 mL) was added SOCI2 dropwise (2eq to 5eq ) at 0 °C or RT. The reaction mixture was stirred at RT for lOmin to 6 h, or until reaction is judged complete (LC/MS). The reaction mixture is concentrated to dryness over a rotavap. The crude chloride residue was suspended in toluene, sonicated and concentrated to dryness. The process was repeated three times and dried under vacuum to give the substituted methylene chloride (2), usually as an off-white solid, which was used for next step without further purification. Alternatively, a solution of aqueous IN Na2C03 is then added to produce a solution of pH~ 8. the mixture was extracted with DCM (3 xl0-50mL), dried over sodium sulfate, and concentrated to the crude substituted methylene chloride (2a), which is then purified by column chromatography on silica gel (0-100% ethyl acetate-hexanes). [0102] General method D for preparing substituted methylene bromide (2b). To a solution of substituted methylene alcohol (1) (0.1 to 2 mmol) in DCM (1-10 mL) was added Ph3PBr2 dropwise (2eq to 5eq ) at 0 °C or RT. The reaction mixture was stirred at RT for 10 min to 2 h, or until reaction is judged complete (LC/MS). The reaction mixture is concentrated to dryness over a rotavap. The residue purified by column chromatography on silica gel (0-100% ethyl acetate-hexanes) to afford the pure bromide 2b. [0103] Similarly, N-linked heterocyclic analogs (compound 5) can also be synthesized from amination procedures developed by Buchwald and Hartwig. Scheme IB [0104] Protected amides of formula -CONHR95 and -CONHOR95 can be converted e.g., hydrolyzed to the corresponding amides according to methods known to the skilled artisan. C19H23N3O3: 342.2.

Condensation of heterocyclic ketone analog 5 with chlorformate or dialkyl carbonate gives (hetero)cyclic beta-ketone ester 6 (Step 1). The ketone ester 6 is converted to the triflate intermediate 7 by treating with a triflating agent (e.g, triflic anhydride) in the presence of an organic base such as Hunig's base (Step 2). Suzuki coupling of the triflate 7 with a boronic acid or ester affords heterocyclohexene carboxylate 8 (Step 3). Subsequent reduction of the ester group by LAH or DIBAL gives the corresponding alcohol 9-OH (Step 4). Further reaction of the alcohol 9-OH with thionyl chloride, Ph3PBr2 (orCBr4-Ph3P or PBr3), or alkyl/aryl sufonyl chloride produces the corresponding 10-X chloride, bromide or sulfonate (Step 5). [0107] Alternatively, the double bond of heterocyclohexene carboxylate 8 is reduced to give the c/s-heterocyclohexane 11-cis carboxylate under palladium catalyzed hydrogenation conditions (Step 6). Reduction of the ester group of 11-cis by LAH or DIBAL yields cis-alcohol 12-OH-cis (Step 8). Conversion of the alcohol 12-OH-cis to its chloride, bromide or sulfonate (such as mesylate, tosylate) 13-X-cis can be achieved by reacting with thionyl chloride, or Ph3PBr2, or sufonyl chloride (such as mesyl chloride or tosyl chloride) (Step 9). The ciscyclohexane carboxylate 11-cis can also be isomerized to the thermodynamically more stable trans-isomer 11-trans by the treatment with an alcoholic alkoxide (e.g., ethoxide) solution. Analogously, transformation of 11-trans ester to 12-trans alcohol and 13-X-trans halide is accomplished by applying conditions of Step 8 and Step9 (Scheme 2) similar to these for the corresponding cis-isomers. [0108] Coupling of the (hetero)cyclic methylene derivatives 9, 10,12 and 13 with hydroxyl (hetero)arylaldehyde derivatives (3a/3b) (see, e.g., Scheme 3) by general method A or Β affords the corresponding aryloxy/heteroarylether analogs (4c and 4d). General Synthetic Scheme 4 Υ= halide, OTs, OMs; OH [0109] Step la-Compound 13 can is synthesized via O-alkylation of phenol aldehyde 12 with alkyl halide 11 (Y=halide, OTs, OMs). A mixture of hydroxyl (hetero)arylaldehyde derivatives (12) (0.1-2 mmol, 1-4 eq.), substituted methylene chloride or bromide (11) (leq), and K2C03 (2-5 eq.) (catalytic amount of Nal or Bu4NI may also be added) in DMF, acetonitrile, ΝΜΡ or DMSO (1 to 10 mL) was stirred at RT or heating up to 120 °C for 1-24 h under nitrogen atmosphere. In workup A, water was added to the reaction mixture, the precipitated product was collected, washed with water, and then subjected to preparative HPLC or flash silica gel chromatography purification. In workup Β (for products that did not precipitate), diluted HCI or aqueous NH4CI was added at 0 °C to adjusted the pH to ~7, the reaction mixture was partitioned between ethyl acetate or dichloromethane and aqueous sodium chloride and the organic layer separated, dried, and solvent removed under vacuum to afford crude product which was purified by automated silica gel column chromatography using appropriate solvents mixture (e.g., ethyl acetate/hexanes). [0110] Step lb-Alternatively, compound 13 is made by coupling of phenol aldehyde 12 with alcohol 1 (Υ=ΟΗ) under Mitsunobu conditions. A hydroxyl (hetero)arylaldehyde derivatives (12) (0.1-2 mmol) mixture with substituted methylene alcohol (11, Υ=ΟΗ) (0.8 to 1.2eq) and (polymer-supported)/PPh3 (1-1.5eq) in anhydrous THF (1-lOmL) was stirred under nitrogen until complete dissolution. The solution was cooled to 0 °C on ice bath and DIAD or DEAD (1.1 eq) in THF or toluene was added drop wise over a 1-20 min period. The ice cooling bath was allowed to expire over 90 min and the mixture was stirred at RT for 2-48 hours. The mixture was stirred for 10 min, then filtered through a pad of silica. The silica was washed with ethyl acetate 2-20mL. The combined filtrates were evaporated and the residue was dried on highvac. The residue was purified by preparative HPLC or flash silica gel chromatography. [0111] Step 2. To a solution of (2-chloropyridin-3-yl)methanol or (2-bromopyridin-3-yl)methanol (1-lOOmmol) and appreciate bronic acid or ester (0.8 to 1.5 eq) in dioxane (2-200 mL) was added a solution of sodium bicarbonate (3 eq) in water (1-100 mL), followed by the addition of Pd(dppf)Cl2 (5 to 10η∩ο1%). After heating at 100 °C for 4-24 h, the reaction mixture was cooled and diluted with EtOAc, organic layer was washed with water, brine, dried and concentrated to give crude product, which was purified by column chromatography. General Synthetic Scheme 5 [0112] Compound 25 can be prepared from 2-halonicotinate through a series organic transformations that involve displacement with cyclic amine and reduction of ester to give hydroxymethylene derivative 22 (step 1). The final product can be synthesized via either direct Mitsunobu reaction of 22 with phenol aldehyde 24 or conversion of the alcohol 22 to halide 23 followed by O-alkylation of phenol 24 with 23. Prodrug Synthesis [0113] Syntheses of the ester prodrugs start with the free carboxylic acid bearing the tertiary amine. The free acid is activated for ester formation in an aprotic solvent and then reacted with a free alcohol group in the presence of an inert base, such as triethyl amine, to provide the ester prodrug. Activating conditions for the carboxylic acid include forming the acid chloride using oxalyl chloride or thionyl chloride in an aprotic solvent, optionally with a catalytic amount of dimethyl formamide, followed by evaporation. Examples of aprotic solvents, include, but are not limited to methylene chloride, tetrahydrofuran, and the like. Alternatively, activations can be performed in situ by using reagents such as BOP (benzotriazol-l-yloxytris(dimethylamino) phosphonium hexafluorolphosphate, and the like (see Nagy et al., 1993, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:6373-6376) followed by reaction with the free alcohol. Isolation of the ester products can be affected by extraction with an organic solvent, such as ethyl acetate or methylene chloride, against a mildly acidic aqueous solution; followed by base treatment of the acidic aqueous phase so as to render it basic; followed by extraction with an organic solvent, for example ethyl acetate or methylene chroride; evaporation of the organic solvent layer; and recrystalization from a solvent, such as ethanol. Optionally, the solvent can be acidified with an acid, such as HCI or acetic acid to provide a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. Alternatively the crude reaction can be passed over an ion exchange column bearing sulfonic acid groups in the protonated form, washed with deionized water, and eluted with aqueous ammonia; followed by evaporation. [0114] Suitable free acids bearing the tertiary amine are commercially available, such as 2-(N-morpholino)-propionic acid, Ν,Ν- dimethyl-beta-alanine, and the like. Non- commercial acids can be synthesized in straightforward manner via standard literature procedures. [0115] Carbonate and carbamate prodrugs can be prepared in an analogous way.
