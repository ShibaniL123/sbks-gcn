Synthesis Example 17
[3-(2-Fluoroethoxy)phenyl]-(4-methoxyphenyl)methyl-diphenylphosphonium bromide (TAP-019)
A reaction vessel was charged with 4-methoxybenzylchloride (431 μL, 3.19 mmol), sodium iodide (1.44 g, 9.58 mmol), and acetone (16 mL), and reaction was effected at room temperature for 18 hours. After the reaction, water was added to the reaction system, and the product was extracted three times with ethyl acetate into the organic layer. The resulting organic layer was washed with saturated saline and dried with MgSO4. After concentration under reduced pressure, the concentrate was purified by Hi-flash silica column chromatography (developing solvent, ethyl acetate:hexane=1:99→20:80) to yield 4-methoxybenzyl iodide (527 mg (2.12 mmol), 67% yield, yellow liquid).
