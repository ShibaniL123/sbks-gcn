DESCRIPTION PHARMACEUTICAL COMBINATIONS OF RIVAROXABAN AND H 2- RECEPTOR ANTAGONISTS Field of Invention This invention is a novel pharmaceutical composition comprising rivaroxaban or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt in a combination with a H2-receptor antagonist (H2RA) and at least one pharmaceutically acceptable excipient. More specifically, this invention relates to pharmaceutical composition comprising rivaroxaban or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof in combination with a H2- receptor antagonist (H2RA) for use in the anticoagulant treatment with preventing or reducing the risk of a gastrointestinal disorder administrated by oral, parenteral, intramuscular or topical route. Background of Invention Anticoagulant drugs target various procoagulant factors in the coagulation pathway. Presently there are numerous anticoagulant drugs which are widely available. One of them is direct factor Xa inhibitors which plays a central role in the cascade of blood coagulation by inhibiting factor Xa directly. In an exemplary embodiment, the Direct factor Xa inhibitors is a member selected from rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, betrixaban, TAK-442, darexaban, and pro-drug s thereof. Rivaroxaban (Formula I), which is already known from WO0147919, is an anticoagulant and the first orally active direct factor Xa inhibitor. Rivaroxaban is used to treat deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). It is also used to help prevent strokes or serious blood clots in people who have atrial fibrillation. Formula I: Rivaroxaban Rivaroxaban , which is commercially available under the trade name Xarelto®, is disclosed in US7157456 (B2), US7585860 (B2), US7592339 (B2). However, rivaroxaban is associated with side effects. The administration of anticoagulant agents, such as rivaroxaban, have been associated with gastrointestinal disorders such as ulcers and gastrointestinal bleeding. In addition, the administration of rivaroxaban , may make some patients more susceptible to the ulcerogenic effects of ulcerogenic stimuli. It appears that a major factor contributing to the development of these gastrointestinal disorders is the presence of acid in the stomach and upper small intestine. While the mechanisms associated with ulcers and gastrointestinal bleeding are not entirely known, there are many causes of ulcers, including stress, alcohol irritation, Helicobacter pylori infection, and the side effects of non-steroid antiinflammatory drugs. Patients in need of long term anticoagulant drug therapy often may interrupt or not receive such therapy due to gastrointestinal disorders, and as a result, patients are deprived of beneficial anticoagulant drug therapy. There is a need for oral pharmaceutical combination formulations to reduce or eliminate the gastrointestinal disorders associated with use of anticoagulant drugs. H2-receptor antagonists (H2RA) are competitive, reversible inhibitors of the action of histamine at the histamine H2-receptors found in gastric cells. This results in decreased gastric acid secretion and gastric volume, and reduced hydrogen ion concentration. The acid labile compounds are useful for inhibiting gastric acid secretion. Famotidine is a histamine H2-receptor antagonist that inhibits stomach acid production. Chemical structure of famotidine (3-[[2-(diaminomethylideneamino)-l,3-thiazol-4- yl]methylsulfanyl]-N'-sulfamoylpropanimidamide) is illustrated with Formula II given below. Formula II: Famotidine In prior art, US Patent Numbers US4362736 discloses the compound of famotidine. US Patent Numbers US4283408 discloses the medical composition containing famotidine as a gastric acid secretion inhibitor with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or diluents. Famotidine is commercially available under the trade names PEPCIDINE and PEPCID®. Nizatidine is a histamine H2-receptor antagonist with low toxicity that inhibits stomach acid production and gastric acid secretion. Chemical structure of nizatidine (N-(2-[(2- [(dimethylamino)methyl]thiazol-4-yl)methylthio]ethyl)-N-methyl-2-nitroethene-l,l- diamine) is illustrated with Formula III given below. Formula III: Nizatidine In prior art, US Patent Numbers US4777260 discloses the process for preparing a novel intermediate for nizatidine. US Patent Numbers US4375547 discloses the compound of nizatidine for inhibiting gastric acid secretion in mammals. Nizatidine is commercially available under the trade names TAZAC and AXID®. Ranitidine is a histamine H2-receptor antagonist that inhibits stomach acid production. Chemical structure of ranitidine (N-(2-[(5-[(dimethylamino)methyl]furan-2- yl)methylthio]ethyl)-N'-methyl-2-nitroethene-l,l-diamine) is illustrated with Formula IV given below. Formula IV: Ranitidine In prior art, US Patent Numbers US4128658 discloses the compound of ranitidine. Additionally ranitidine brings about an improvement of method of treating a condition mediated through histamine H2-receptors, especially for peptic ulceration. US Patent Numbers US5008256 discloses the compound of ranitidine bismuth citrate for treating or preventing gastrointestinal disorders. The bismuth citrate of ranitidine is commercially available under the trade name PYLORID®. EP Patent Numbers EP0626381 discloses a process for preparing form 1 ranitidine hydrochloride. The hydrochloride salt of ranitidine is commercially available under the trade name ZANTAC®. As described above, the major factor contributing to the development of gastrointestinal disorders is the presence of acid in the stomach and upper small intestine. Therefore, the main object of the invention is administering to a patient an oral dosage form including a combination of an anticoagulant agent and a H2-receptor antagonist (H2RA) which can reduce a major factor contributing to the development of gastrointestinal disorder in patients. According to the main object, the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention is for the prevention gastrointestinal tract from side effects associated with anticoagulant therapy and provide greater anticoagulant effect with the results in a lower incidence of side effects. According to prior inventions rivaroxaban in combination with H2-receptor antagonists (H2RA) in particular famotidine or nizatidine or ranitidine have an additive preventive effect in relief of gastrointestinal disorder and provide greater anticoagulant effect with the results in a lower incidence of side effects.

Another object of the invention is to provide a pharmaceutical composition for use in anticoagulant treatment and treating deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) and protecting the gastrointestinal tract from side effects associated with anticoagulant therapy. Here, H2 receptor antagonist decreases acid level of gastric fluid by inhibiting acid secretion, thereby preventing or minimizing such diseases as gastric erosion, peptic ulcer, major upper gastrointestinal system bleedings, alterations in the intestine permeability and inflammation, all of which are caused by rivaroxaban. In a preferred embodiment said pharmaceutical composition is formulated preferably in the form of tablet or capsule or multilayer tablet. In a preferred embodiment said pharmaceutical composition is formulated preferably in the form of tablet or capsule or multilayer tablet comprising rivaroxaban pellets and H2-receptor antagonist (H2RA) pellets. According to the pharmaceutical incompatibility problem, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a inert barrier layer which is present in the middle in such a way that it separates rivaroxaban and one of the H2-receptor antagonist (H2RA) layers and the rivaroxaban and H2RA layers are present at the outer or inner part of the inert barrier layer. By the virtue of the inert barrier layer, interaction between the rivaroxaban and H2RA molecules is prevented and at the same time H2RA molecule is enabled to remain stable in the dosage form. Moreover, another important reason is that the formulations of the active substances with different release properties can be provided in the same form with inert barrier layer. Thus, rivaroxaban and H2RA molecules are formulated in a way not to interact, and at the same time it is provided that these molecules remain stable in their own form.
