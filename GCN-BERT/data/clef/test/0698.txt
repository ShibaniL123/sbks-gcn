BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Precursors, particularly organoaminodisilane, and compositions thereof that can be used for the deposition of silicon-containing films, including but not limited to, silicon amorphous silicon, crystalline silicon, silicon nitride, silicon oxide, carbon doped silicon oxide , silicon carbo-nitride, and silicon oxynitride films are described herein. In yet another aspect, described herein is the use of the organoaminodisilane precursors for depositing silicon-containing silicon-containing films in the fabrication of integrated circuit devices. In these or other aspects, the organoaminodisilane precursors may be used for a variety of deposition processes, including but not limited to, atomic layer deposition ("ALD"), chemical vapor deposition ("CVD"), plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition ("PECVD"), low pressure chemical vapor deposition ("LPCVD"), and atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition. Several classes of compounds can be used as precursors for silicon-containing films such as, but not limited to, silicon oxide, carbon doped silicon oxide or silicon nitride films. Examples of these compounds suitable for use as precursors include silanes, chlorosilanes, polysilazanes, aminosilanes, and azidosilanes. Inert carrier gas or diluents such as, but not limited, helium, hydrogen, nitrogen, etc., are also used to deliver the precursors to the reaction chamber. Low pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) processes are one of the more widely accepted methods used by semiconductor industry for the deposition of silicon-containing films. Low pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) using ammonia may require deposition temperatures of greater than 750°C to obtain reasonable growth rates and uniformities. Higher deposition temperatures are typically employed to provide improved film properties. One of the more common industry methods to grow silicon nitride or other silicon-containing films is through low pressure chemical vapor deposition in a hot wall reactor at temperatures >750°C using the precursors silane, dichlorosilane, and/or ammonia. However, there are several drawbacks using this method. For example, certain precursors, such as silane are pyrophoric. This may present problems in handling and usage. Also, films deposited from silane and dichlorosilane may contain certain impurities. For example, films deposited using dichlorosilane may contain certain impurities, such as chlorine and ammonium chloride, which are formed as byproducts during the deposition process. Films deposited using silane may contain hydrogen. Precursors that are used in depositing silicon nitride films such as BTBAS and chlorosilanes generally deposit the films at temperatures greater than 550°C. The trend of miniaturization of semiconductor devices and low thermal budget requires lower process temperature and higher deposition rate. The temperature, at which the silicon films are deposited, should decrease in order to prevent ion diffusion in the lattice, particularly for those substrates comprising metallization layers and on many Group III-V and II-VI devices. Accordingly, there is a need in the art to provide precursors for the deposition of silicon-containing films, such as silicon oxide, carbon doped silicon oxide , silicon oxynitride, or silicon nitride films that are sufficiently chemically reactive to allow deposition via CVD, ALD or other processes at temperatures of 550°C or below or even at room temperature.

The precursor 1,2-bis(di-i-propylamino)disilane (BIPADS) was used for the PECVD deposition of silicon nitride films. The resulting films from the BIPADS precursor exhibited refractive indices ranging from 1.631-1.814 and had low carbon and very low oxygen contents but high (Si-bound) hydrogen contents.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The organoaminodisilanes described herein are used as precursors to form stoichiometric and non-stoichiometric silicon containing films such as, but not limited to, amorphous silicon, crystalline silicon, silicon oxide, silicon oxycarbide, silicon nitride, silicon oxynitride, and silicon oxycarbonitride. These precursors can also be used, for example, as dopants for metal containing films. The organoaminodisilane precursors used in semi-conductor processes are typically high purity volatile liquid precursor chemical that are vaporized and delivered to a deposition chamber or reactor as a gas to deposit a silicon containing film via CVD or ALD processes for semiconductor devices. The selection of precursor materials for deposition depends upon the desired resultant silicon-containing material or film. For example, a precursor material may be chosen for its content of chemical elements, its stoichiometric ratios of the chemical elements, and/or the resultant silicon containing film or coating that are formed under CVD. The precursor material may also be chosen for various other characteristics such as cost, relatively low toxicity, handling characteristics, ability to maintain liquid phase at room temperature, volatility, molecular weight, and/or other considerations. In certain embodiments, the precursors described herein can be delivered to the reactor system by any number of means, preferably using a pressurizable stainless steel vessel fitted with the proper valves and fittings, to allow the delivery of liquid phase precursor to the deposition chamber or reactor. The organoaminodisilane precursors described herein exhibit a balance of reactivity and stability that makes them ideally suitable as CVD or ALD precursors in microelectronic device manufacturing processes. With regard to reactivity, certain precursors may have boiling points that are too high to be vaporized and delivered to the reactor to be deposited as a film on a substrate. Precursors having higher relative boiling points require that the delivery container and lines need to be heated at or above the boiling point of the precursor under a given vacuum to prevent condensation or particles from forming in the container, lines, or both. With regard to stability, other precursors may form silane (SiH4) or disilane (Si2H6) as they degrade. Silane is pyrophoric at room temperature or it can spontaneously combust which presents safety and handling issues. Moreover, the formation of silane or disilane and other by-products decreases the purity level of the precursor and changes as small as 1-2% in chemical purity may be considered unacceptable for reliable semiconductor manufacture.

In certain embodiments, the at least one organoaminodisilane precursor having Formula I has one or more substituents comprising oxygen or nitrogen atoms. In this or other embodiments, substituents R1 and R2 are linked via an oxygen or a nitrogen atom in Formula I to form a ring structure. Without being bound by theory, it is believed that organoaminodisilane precursors such as those organoaminodisilanes having Formula I described herein comprising a Si-N bond, a Si-Si bond and a SiH3 group are advantageous over known organoaminodisilane precursors containing only Si-N and Si-Si bonds or only Si-Cl and Si-Si bonds. In this regard, it is believed that the organoaminodisilanes described herein having four ro five Si-H groups, one -Si-N bond and one Si-Si bond make them more reactive than other organoaminodisilane precursors, allowing deposition temperatures to be lower than other known organoaminodisilanes, such as, for example, hexachlorodisilane. It is believed that the unique structures of the Formula 1 precursors described herein allow for deposition temperatures of 400°C or less, 300 °C or less, 200 °C or less, 100 °C or less, or 25 °C. In certain embodiments, the organoaminodisilanes having Formula I can be prepared by reacting a monochlorodisilane (MCDS) or monobromodisilane (MBDS) or lower molecular dialkylaminodisilane such as di-iso-propylaminodisilane or di-sec-butylaminodisilane with an amine having the following Formula II in an organic solvent or solvent mixture. In Formula II, R1 and R2 are the same as in the substituents described in Formula I. The following Equation 1 provide a non-limiting example of a reaction schemes or synthesis route which may be used to make the organoaminodisilanes having Formula I as described herein.

In embodiments wherein an organic solvent is used, examples of suitable organic solvents include, but are not limited to, hydrocarbon such as hexanes, octane, toluene, and ethers such as diethylether and tetrahydrofuran (THF). In these or other embodiments, the reaction temperature is in the range of from about -70°C to the boiling point of the solvent employed if a solvent is used. The resulting organoaminodisilane can be purified, for example, via vacuum distillation after removing all by-products as well as any solvent(s) if present. Equation 1 is one synthetic route to make the organoaminodisilanes having Formula I involving a reaction between monohalidodisilane (XSiH2SiH3 wherein X=Cl, Br, I) and a secondary amine presented in Formula II. Other synthetic routes may be also employed to make these organoaminodisilanes as disclosed in the prior art, for example reducing monoaminochlorodisilanes with metal hydride or disproportionation of monoaminocholordisilane or reacting disilane with secondary amine in presence of catalyst.

Examples of suitable deposition processes for the method disclosed herein include, but are not limited to, cyclic CVD (CCVD), MOCVD (Metal Organic CVD), thermal chemical vapor deposition, plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition ("PECVD"), high density PECVD, photon assisted CVD, plasma-photon assisted ("PPECVD"), cryogenic chemical vapor deposition, chemical assisted vapor deposition, hot-filament chemical vapor deposition, CVD of a liquid polymer precursor, deposition from supercritical fluids, and low energy CVD (LECVD). In certain embodiments, the metal containing films are deposited via atomic layer deposition (ALD), plasma enhanced ALD (PEALD) or plasma enhanced cyclic CVD (PECCVD) process. As used herein, the term "chemical vapor deposition processes" refers to any process wherein a substrate is exposed to one or more volatile precursors, which react and/or decompose on the substrate surface to produce the desired deposition. As used herein, the term "atomic layer deposition process" refers to a self-limiting (e.g., the amount of film material deposited in each reaction cycle is constant), sequential surface chemistry that deposits films of materials onto substrates of varying compositions. Although the precursors, reagents and sources used herein may be sometimes described as "gaseous", it is understood that the precursors can be either liquid or solid which are transported with or without an inert gas into the reactor via direct vaporization, bubbling or sublimation. In some case, the vaporized precursors can pass through a plasma generator. In one embodiment, the silicon-containing film is deposited using an ALD process. In another embodiment, the silicon-containing film is deposited using a CCVD process. In a further embodiment, the silicon-containing film is deposited using a thermal CVD process. The term "reactor" as used herein, includes without limitation, reaction chamber or deposition chamber. In certain embodiments, the method disclosed herein avoids pre-reaction of the precursors by using ALD or CCVD methods that separate the precursors prior to and/or during the introduction to the reactor. In this connection, deposition techniques such as ALD or CCVD processes are used to deposit the silicon-containing film. In one embodiment, the film is deposited via an ALD process by exposing the substrate surface alternatively to the one or more the silicon-containing precursor, oxygen-containing source, nitrogen-containing source, or other precursor or reagent. Film growth proceeds by self-limiting control of surface reaction, the pulse length of each precursor or reagent, and the deposition temperature. However, once the surface of the substrate is saturated, the film growth ceases.

In certain embodiments, the silicon-containing films deposited using the methods described herein are formed in the presence of oxygen using an oxygen-containing source, reagent or precursor comprising oxygen. An oxygen-containing source may be introduced into the reactor in the form of at least one oxygen-containing source and/or may be present incidentally in the other precursors used in the deposition process. Suitable oxygen-containing source gases may include, for example, water (H2O) (e.g., deionized water, purifier water, and/or distilled water), oxygen (O2), oxygen plasma, ozone (O3), NO, N2O, NO2, carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2) and combinations thereof. In certain embodiments, the oxygen-containing source comprises an oxygen-containing source gas that is introduced into the reactor at a flow rate ranging from about 1 to about 2000 square cubic centimeters (sccm) or from about 1 to about 1000 sccm. The oxygen-containing source can be introduced for a time that ranges from about 0.1 to about 100 seconds.

In yet another embodiment, the purge duration between the pulses that can be as low as 0 seconds or is continuously pulsed without a purge in-between. The oxygen-containing source or reagent is provided in a molecular amount less than a 1:1 ratio to the silicon precursor, so that at least some carbon is retained in the as deposited silicon-containing film. In certain embodiments, the silicon-containing films comprise silicon and nitrogen. In these embodiments, the silicon-containing films deposited using the methods described herein are formed in the presence of nitrogen-containing source. A nitrogen-containing source may be introduced into the reactor in the form of at least one nitrogen-containing source and/or may be present incidentally in the other precursors used in the deposition process.

The organoaminodisilane precursors and/or other silicon-containing precursors may be delivered to the reaction chamber such as a CVD or ALD reactor in a variety of ways. In one embodiment, a liquid delivery system may be utilized. In an alternative embodiment, a combined liquid delivery and flash vaporization process unit may be employed, such as, for example, the turbo vaporizer manufactured by MSP Corporation of Shoreview, MN, to enable low volatility materials to be volumetrically delivered, which leads to reproducible transport and deposition without thermal decomposition of the precursor. In liquid delivery formulations, the precursors described herein may be delivered in neat liquid form, or alternatively, may be employed in solvent formulations or compositions comprising same. Thus, in certain embodiments the precursor formulations may include solvent component(s) of suitable character as may be desirable and advantageous in a given end use application to form a film on a substrate. For those embodiments wherein the precursor(s) having Formula I is used in a composition comprising a solvent and an organoaminodisilane precursor having Formula I described herein, the solvent or mixture thereof selected does not react with the organoaminodisilane. The amount of solvent by weight percentage in the composition ranges from 0.5% by weight to 99.5% or from 10% by weight to 75%.

In another embodiment, a vessel for depositing a silicon-containing film comprising one or more organoaminodisilane precursor having Formula I is described herein. In one particular embodiment, the vessel comprises at least one pressurizable vessel (preferably of stainless steel) fitted with the proper valves and fittings to allow the delivery of one or more precursors to the reactor for a CVD or an ALD process. In this or other embodiments, the organoaminodisilane precursor having Formula I is provided in a pressurizable vessel comprised of stainless steel and the purity of the precursor is 98% by weight or greater or 99.5% or greater which is suitable for the majority of semiconductor applications. In certain embodiments, such vessels can also have means for mixing the precursors with one or more additional precursor if desired. In these or other embodiments, the contents of the vessel(s) can be premixed with an additional precursor. Alternatively, the organoaminodisilane precursor and/or other precursor can be maintained in separate vessels or in a single vessel having separation means for maintaining the organoaminodisilane precursor and other precursor separate during storage. In one embodiment of the method described herein, a cyclic deposition process such as CCVD, ALD, or PEALD may be employed, wherein at least one silicon-containing precursor selected from an organoaminodisilane precursor having the formula described herein and optionally a nitrogen-containing source such as, for example, ammonia, hydrazine, monoalkylhydrazine, dialkylhydrazine, nitrogen, nitrogen/hydrogen, ammonia plasma, nitrogen plasma, nitrogen/hydrogen plasma are employed. In certain embodiments, the gas lines connecting from the precursor canisters to the reaction chamber are heated to one or more temperatures depending upon the process requirements and the container of the organoaminodisilane precursor having the formula I described herein is kept at one or more temperatures for bubbling. In other embodiments, a solution comprising the at least one silicon-containing precursor having the formula described herein is injected into a vaporizer kept at one or more temperatures for direct liquid injection. A flow of argon and/or other gas may be employed as a carrier gas to help deliver the vapor of the at least one organoaminodisilane precursor to the reaction chamber during the precursor pulsing. In certain embodiments, the reaction chamber process pressure is about 1 Torr. In a typical ALD or CCVD process, a substrate such as, without limitation, a silicon oxide, carbon doped silicon oxide, flexible substrate, or metal nitride substrate is heated on a heater stage in a reaction chamber that is exposed to the silicon-containing precursor initially to allow the organoaminodisilane to chemically adsorb onto the surface of the substrate. A purge gas such as nitrogen, argon, or other inert gas purges away unabsorbed excess organoaminodisilane from the process chamber. After sufficient purging, an oxygen-containing source may be introduced into reaction chamber to react with the absorbed surface followed by another gas purge to remove reaction by-products from the chamber. The process cycle can be repeated to achieve the desired film thickness. In other embodiments, pumping under vacuum can be used to remove unabsorbed excess organoaminodisilane from the process chamber, after sufficient evacuation under pumping, an oxygen-containing source may be introduced into reaction chamber to react with the absorbed surface followed by another pumping down purge to remove reaction by-products from the chamber. In yet another embodiment, the organoaminodisilane and the oxygen-containing source can be co-flowed into reaction chamber to react on the substrate surface to deposit silicon oxide, carbon doped silicon oxide. In a certain embodiment of cyclic CVD, the purge step is not used. In this or other embodiments, it is understood that the steps of the methods described herein may be performed in a variety of orders, may be performed sequentially or concurrently (e.g., during at least a portion of another step), and any combination thereof.

The tubes were capped and placed into a lab oven and heated at 80°C for 4 days. The 4 heated samples were analyzed by GC to determine the extent of degradation relative to the unheated control sample. The samples had an average purity of 99.15% after heating, showing an average degradation of 0.09% relative to the initial purity of 99.24% and demonstrating that DIPADS is suitable precursor for depositing silicon-containing film because of its excellent thermal stability. It is expected that both di-sec-butylaminodisilane and 2,6-dimethylpiperidinodisilane would have similar thermal stability as they have same chemical environments around both silicon atoms as DIPAS. Comparable Example 2: Thermal Stability of Diethylaminodisilane (DEADS) Approximately 2 ml of diethylaminodisilane (DEADS) was heated in duplicate sealed stainless steel tubes at 80°C for 3 days. GC analysis of samples before and after heating showed an average purity drop of 4.4%. Bis(diethylamino)disilane (bis-DEADS) grew in by 3.0% as a result of heating. Disilane was also detected via GC-MS. The observed degradation is consistent with what is reported by Abedini et. al. (Inorg. Chem. Vol 2, 608 (1963)) for dimethylaminodisilane (DMADS) as shown below: 2DEADS=bis-DEADS+disilane This seems to suggest both DEADS and DMADS may not be suitable as a precursor for depositing silicon-containing films due to their instability. Example 3: Cyclic Chemical Vapor Deposition of Amorphous Silicon Films Using Organoaminodisilane Amorphous silicon film was deposited using organoaminodisilane such as diisopropylaminodisilane (DIPADS) and phenylmethylaminodisilane (PMADS) on borosilicate glass and 100 nm Si oxides on Si substrates in cyclic CVD mode at a temperature ranging from 300-400°C. The deposition process was comprised of the following steps a. through c. shown in Table 2 and repeated 1000 times: Table 2. Deposition Parameters Using DIPADS or PMADSStep a6 sec.

The film has Raman scattering at 477 cm-1 which is provided in Figure 2 and confirms an amorphous silicon structure. Example 4: Atomic Layer Deposition of Silicon Oxide Films Using Organoaminodisilane Atomic layer deposition of silicon oxide films were conducted using di-iso-propylaminodisilane (DIPADS). The depositions were performed on a laboratory scale ALD processing tool. The organoaminodisilane precursor was delivered to the chamber by vapor draw at 55°C source temperature. All gases (purge, oxygen-containing source and reactant gas) and precursor lines are heated accordingly to ensure precursor flows without any condensation. Gases and precursor flow rates were controlled with ALD diaphragm valves with high speed actuation. The substrates used in the deposition were 12 inch long silicon strips. A thermocouple attached on the sample holder to confirm substrate temperature. Depositions were performed using ozone as the oxygen-containing source gas. The deposition parameters are provided in Table 4.

Thickness and refractive indices of the films were measured using a FilmTek 2000SE ellipsometer by fitting the reflection data from the film to a pre-set physical model (e.g., the Lorentz Oscillator model). The % thickness non-uniformity was calculated from 6-point measurements using the following equation: % non-uniformity = ((max - min)/(2* mean)). Film density was characterized with X-ray reflectometry (XRR). X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) is used to determine film composition. Film density is characterized using X-ray Reflectometry (XRR). Table 5 summarizes resulting silicon oxide film properties and the film composition and density are provided in Table 6. Table 5.

Table 6 shows that the carbon and nitrogen contents are below XPS detection limit (<0.1%) for all films. In addition, DIPADS shows significant deposition rate at low temperature (100°C) which is much better than halogenated disilane precursor such as Si2Cl6 because halogenated precursors are typically not very reactive to ozone or oxygen and require high temperature (>400°C) for depositing silicon oxide films when ozone is employed as oxygen-containing source. Typical halogenated precursors requires water with catalyst such as pyridine, therefore, they are susceptible to particles formation especially at low temperature. Figure 3 shows the relationship between deposition rate and pulse time of DIPADS for forming a silicon oxide film using DIPADS and ozone at a temperature of 300°C, demonstrating self-limiting behavior of DIPADS and confirming that DIPADS is a suitable precursor for ALD of silicon oxide. Figure 4 shows the relationship between thicknesses and the number of cycles for forming a silicon oxide film using DIPADS and ozone at a temperature of 300°C, demonstrating good linearity and further confirming DIPADS is a suitable precursor for ALD of silicon oxide. Example 5: Plasma Enhanced Atomic Layer Deposition of Silicon Oxide Films Using Organoaminodisilane ALD deposition of silicon oxide was conducted from DIPADS and oxygen plasma process using ASM Stellar 3000 production tool on 300 mm Si wafers. Precursor is delivered using Ar carrier gas at room temperature. Oxygen is flowing continuously during process to reduce deposition time. Deposition temperature is set to 30°C and 100°C. Precursor lines were heated to prevent precursor condensation. Chamber pressure is fixed to 3 Torr during the depositions. The deposition steps and parameters are provided in Table 7.

The % thickness non-uniformity was calculated from 9-point measurements using the following equation: % non-uniformity = ((max - min)/(2* mean)). Table 8 provides the resulting silicon oxide films properties.

Table 8 shows no carbon or nitrogen was detected by XPS. Film density is 2.1 g/cc as determined by XRR. The results in Table 8 indicates that DIPADS shows good deposition rates at even lower temperature such as 30°C which is superior to halogenated disilane precursor such as Si2Cl6. It is believed that the good deposition rate is due to the high chemical reactivity of organoaminodisilanes described in this invention.
