NOVEL (CYANO-DIMETHYL-METHYL)-ISOXAZOLES AND -[1,3,4]THIADIAZOLES FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to novel (Cyano-dimethyl-methyl)-isoxazoles- and -[1,3,4]thiadiazoles and their use as cannabinoid receptor 2 agonists (CB2 receptor agonists), pharmaceutical compositions containing the same, and methods of using the same as agents for the treatment of CB2 receptor mediated disorders or conditions. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION W02008014199 and W02008039645 discuss the CB2 receptor, and the therapeutic uses of the CB2 receptor agonist compounds disclosed therein. Further supporting evidence has more recently emerged in which the expression of CB2 in dorsal root ganglion neurons has been demonstrated in multiple species (Anand et al., 2008 Pain 138: 667-680). Neuronal expression of CB2 has been shown to be altered under pathological pain conditions suggesting a key role for CB2 neuronal signalling. A role for centrally located CB2 has been suggested by recent reports of an effect ofCB2 on addictive behaviour (Xi et al., Nat. Neuroscience 2012, 14, 1160-1166; Morales & Bonci et al., Nature Med. 2012, 18, 504-505; Aracil-Fernandez et al., Neuropsychopharmacology 2012, 37, 1749-1763) and other conditions in which maladaptive impulsivity plays a role (Navarrete et al., Br. J. Pharmacol. 2012, 165, 260-273). A role of the hepatic CB2 in the pathogenesis of steatohepatitis and fibrotic liver diseases has also been suggested by several preclinical studies (Munoz-Luque et al., JPET 2008, 324, 475-483; Reichenbach et al., JPET 2012, 340, 629-637, WO2011009883). It is believed that the highly selective activation of the CB2 receptor with an agonist may offer avenues of harnessing the beneficial effects while avoiding the adverse effects seen with dual CB1/CB2 cannabinoid receptor agonists (see e.g. Expert Opinion on Investigational Drugs 2005, 14, 695-703). It is desirable therefore to provide agonists of CB2 with minimized CB1 activity. W02010036630, WO2010147792 and W02010077836 disclose CB2 receptor agonists that are structurally closest to the compounds of the present invention. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides novel (Cyano-dimethyl-methyl)-isoxazoles and -[1,3,4]thiadiazoles, namely or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. Compounds of the present invention are CB2 receptor agonists. The disclosed compounds are not only potent activators of the CB2 receptor (assay 1) but also show 1) no or low activation of the CB1 receptor (assay 2), and 2) no or low MDCK efflux (assay 3). Thus, the present invention provides compounds which show a combination of potency as CB2 receptor agonists, high selectivity against the CB1 receptor, and low MDCK efflux. It is demonstrated that the structurally closest compounds exemplified in WO2010036630, WO2010147792 and W02010077836 do not have this balanced profile of desirable properties. The compounds of the present invention are therefore less likely to cause CB1 mediated side effects in vivo and to demonstrate in vivo efflux as compared to the closest prior art compounds, while they are expected to be efficacious in various in vivo models. Thus, they are expected to have a higher tolerability and are therefore potentially more viable for human use.

BIOLOGICAL ASSAYS The biological activity of compounds was determined by the following methods. A. In vitro testing of CB2 potency: CB2 cAMP (assay 1) CHO cells expressing human CB2R (Euroscreen) were plated at a density of 10,000 cells per well in 384 well plates and incubated overnight at 37 °C. After removing the media, the cells were treated with test compounds diluted in stimulation buffer containing 1mM IBMX, 0.25% BSA and 10uM Forskolin. The assay was incubated for 30 minutes at 37 °C. Cells were lysed and the cAMP concentration was measured using DiscoverX-XS cAMP kit, following the manufacturer’s protocol. In this setting, agonists will decrease forskolin induced production of cAMP while inverse agonists will further increase forskolin induced production of cAMP. EC50 of agonists were calculated as follows. The maximal amount of cAMP produced by forskolin compared to the level of cAMP inhibited by 1uM CP55940 is defined as 100%. The EC50 value of each test compound was determined as the concentration at which 50% of the forskolinstimulated cAMP synthesis was inhibited. Data was analyzed using a four-parameter logistic model. (Model 205 of XLfit 4.0). Β. In vitro testing of CB1 potency: CB1 cAMP (assay 2) CHO cells expressing human CB1R (Euroscreen) were plated at a density of 10,000 cells per well in 384 well plates and incubated overnight at 37 °C. After removing the media, the cells were treated with test compounds diluted in stimulation buffer containing 1mM IBMX, 0.25% BSA and 10uM Forskolin. The assay was incubated for 30 minutes at 37 °C. Cells were lysed and the cAMP concentration was measured using DiscoverX-XS cAMP kit, following the manufacturer’s protocol. In this setting, agonists will decrease forskolin induced production of cAMP while inverse agonists will further increase forskolin induced production of cAMP. EC50 of agonists were calculated as follows. The maximal amount of cAMP produced by forskolin compared to the level of cAMP inhibited by 1uM CP55940 is defined as 100%. The EC50 value of each test compound was determined as the concentration at which 50% of the forskolinstimulated cAMP synthesis was inhibited. Data was analyzed using a four-parameter logistic model. (Model 205 of XLfit 4.0). C. Assessment of efflux in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells transfected with the human MDR1 gene (MDCK assay) (assay 3) Apparent permeability coefficients (PE) of the compounds across the MDCK-MDR1 cell monolayers are measured (pH 7.4, 37 °C) in apical-to-basal (ΑΒ) and basal-to-apical (BA) transport direction. ΑΒ permeability (ΡΕΑΒ) represents drug absorption from the blood into the brain and BA permeability (ΡΕΒΑ) drug efflux from the brain back into the blood via both passive permeability as well as active transport mechanisms mediated by efflux and uptake transporters that are expressed on the MDCK-MDR1 cells, predominantly by the overexpressed human MDR1 P-gp. The compounds are assigned to permeability/absorption classes by comparison of the ΑΒ permeabilities with the ΑΒ permeabilities of reference compounds with known in vitro permeability and oral absorption in the human. Identical or similar permeabilities in both transport directions indicate passive permeation, vectorial permeability points to additional active transport mechanisms. Higher ΡΕΒΑ than ΡΕΑΒ indicates the involvement of active efflux mediated by MDR1 P-gp. Active transport is concentration- dependently saturable. MDCK-MDR1 cells (1-2 χ 10℮5 cells/1 cm2 area) are seeded on filter inserts (Costar transwell polycarbonate or PET filters, 0.4 pm pore size) and cultured (DMEM) for 7 days. Subsequently, the MDR1 expression is boosted by culturing the cells with 5 mM sodium butyrate in full medium for 2 days. Compounds are dissolved in appropriate solvent (like DMSO, 1 -20 mM stock solutions). Stock solutions are diluted with HTP-4 buffer (128.13 mM NaCI, 5.36 mM KCI, 1 mM MgS04, 1.8 mM CaCI2, 4.17 mM NaHC03, 1.19 mM Na2HP04 x 7H20, 0.41 mM NaH2P04xH20, 15 mM HEPES, 20 mM glucose, 0.25 % BSA, pH 7.4) to prepare the transport solutions (0.1 300 μΜ compound, final DMSO <= 0.5 %). The transport solution (TL) is applied to the apical or basolateral donor side for measuring Α-Β or Β-Α permeability (3 filter replicates), respectively. The receiver side contains the same buffer as the donor side. Samples are collected at the start and end of experiment from the donor and at various time intervals for up to 2 hours also from the receiver side for concentration measurement by HPLC-MS/MS or scintillation counting. Sampled receiver volumes are replaced with fresh receiver solution.

Synergy, as described for example by Chou and Talalay, Adv. Enzyme Regul. 22:27-55 (1984), occurs when the effect of the compounds when administered in combination is greater than the additive effect of the compounds when administered alone as a single agent. In general, a synergistic effect is most clearly demonstrated at suboptimal concentrations of the compounds. Synergy can be in terms of lower cytotoxicity, increased pharmacological effect, or some other beneficial effect of the combination compared with the individual components.
