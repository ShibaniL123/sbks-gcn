An agricultural roller ring and a land packer comprising a set of such agricultural roller rings Field of the invention The invention relates to an agricultural roller ring for packing the soil while pressing encountered stones in the soil, which ring comprises a hub part with a central hole for receiving a shaft, a rim part with an outer surface for packing the soil, a plurality of spokes, each spoke having a body connecting the hub part and the rim part. Also, the invention relates to a land packer. Background of the invention Typically, a plurality of roller rings sits on a shaft of a land packer driving on a field. A roller ring such as the one shown in FIG.1 is used for packing the soil while pressing encountered stones in the soil, thus avoiding that stones get into, e.g., a harvester when the latter is in operation. Basically, when a stone hits the ring, the ring drives on it and pushes it in the soil. However, such a roller ring has a short lifetime as the at- tachment points of the spokes at the ring tend to crack due to the frequency of the impacts with the stones. In order to make the ring more durable, reinforcements may be applied at the attachment points; nevertheless, this implies an increased weight and manufacturing cost for the whole construction. Hence, there is a need in the technical field of agricultural roller rings and land packers of overcoming the abovementioned drawbacks of the state-of-the-art solutions. Aspects of the invention The first aspect of the invention is to provide an improvement to the state-of-the-art. The second aspect of the invention is to solve the abovementioned drawbacks of the prior art, i.e., that of providing an agricultural roller ring that is stronger and thereby has a longer lifetime than a conventional roller ring (ref. FIG.1) and a reinforced version of a conventional roller ring. At the same time, the aim of the invention is to provide a roller ring that is lighter and thereby less costly to manufacture than a reinforced version of a conventional roller ring. Description of the invention The aforementioned aspects of the invention are achieved by an agricultural roller ring as described in the preamble of claim 1, wherein the body, in a direction towards the rim part, is branched into a plurality of arms connecting the body to an inner surface of the rim part. Herein, a spoke is defined as an elongated element extending from the center of the roller ring (i.e., the hub where the shaft of a land packer is mounted), connecting the center of the roller ring with an inner surface of the roller ring. The invention has the advantage that the impact of the hit of a stone on the roller ring is distributed on the arms of a spoke. As a consequence, the roller ring of the invention is around 5-7 times stronger than a conventional roller ring and around 3 times stronger than a reinforced version of a conventional roller ring. At the same time, the roller ring of the invention is around 3 kg lighter than a reinforced version of a conventional roller ring. The above assessments have been made comparing roller rings having the same diameter. In an embodiment of the invention, the body is branched into two arms. In another embodiment of the invention, each spoke is Y-shaped. Nevertheless, the two arms of the spoke may form an arch instead of extending in a diverging, straight manner from the body of the spoke. These embodiments have the advantage that the number of arms is minimized, thus minimizing the complexity and the cost of manufacturing the roller ring while still achieving the abovementioned technical effects in terms of strength and weight. In an embodiment of the invention, each of the two arms is attached to the inner surface of the ring at an attachment point, wherein an angle between the two attachment points ranges from 23 degrees to 28 degrees (e.g., 27 degrees in case of∅ 500 and 24 degrees in case of∅ 620). Correspondingly, the distance between the two attachment points ranges between 80 mm to 120 mm (e.g., 96 mm in case of∅ 500 and 117 mm in case of∅ 620). Advantageously, said angle and said distance between the two attachment points increase with the diameter of the ring but, at the same time, are nar- row enough to avoid cracks at the attachment points. This embodiment has the advantage that each spoke has a significantly stronger resistance to cracking. In an embodiment of the invention, the number of spokes ranges from 2 to 10 spokes. Advantageously, the number of spokes increases with the diameter of the ring (e.g., 6 spokes in case of∅ 500 and 8 spokes in case of∅ 620). This embodiment has the advantage that the same strength is achieved regardless the diameter of the ring. Also, the aforementioned aspects of the invention are achieved by a land packer com- prising a set of agricultural roller rings (i.e., at least one set with at least two roller rings) according to any of the preceding embodiments, wherein the agricultural roller rings are mounted rotatably about a common central shaft mounted on a frame of the land packer. Note that all the aforementioned advantages of the agricultural roller ring are also met by the land packer. Hereafter, the invention will be described in connection with drawings illustrating non-limiting examples of agricultural roller rings and land packers.
