The entirety of each of the above-mentioned patent applications is hereby incorporated by reference herein and made a part of this specification. TECHNICAL FIELD The invention relates to a liquid crystal composition including a polymerizable compound that is polymerized by light or heat for instance. The invention also relates to a liquid crystal display device in which the liquid crystal composition is sealed between the substrates of the device, the polymerizable compound is polymerized while a voltage is applied to the device, and the orientation of liquid crystal molecules is adjusted by the effect of the resulting polymer. The invention relates mainly to a liquid crystal composition suitable for use in an active matrix (AM) device and so on, and an AM device and so on that contain the composition. More specifically, the invention relates to a liquid crystal composition having negative dielectric anisotropy, and a device containing the composition and having an in-plane switching (IPS) mode, a fringe field switching (FFS) mode, a vertical alignment (VA) mode or a polymer sustained alignment (PSA) mode. The VA mode includes a multi-domain vertical alignment (MVA) mode and a patterned vertical alignment (PVA) mode. TECHNICAL BACKGROUND For liquid crystal display devices, the classification based on the operating mode for liquid crystal molecules includes modes such as phase change (PC), twisted nematic (TN), super twisted nematic (STN), electrically controlled birefringence (ECB), optically compensated bend (OCB), in-plane switching (IPS), fringe field switching (FFS), vertical alignment (VA) and polymer sustained alignment (PSA). The classification based on the driving mode of the device includes passive matrix (PM) and active matrix (AM) types. The PM type is further classified into static type, multiplex type and so on, and the AM type classified into thin film transistor (TFT) type, metal-insulator-metal (MIM) type and so on. The TFT type is further classified into amorphous silicon and polysilicon types, wherein the latter is classified into high-temperature type and low-temperature type according to the production process. The classification based on the light source includes the reflection type utilizing natural light, the transmission type utilizing a backlight, and the semi-transmission type utilizing both kinds of light. These devices contain a liquid crystal composition having suitable characteristics. The liquid crystal composition has a nematic phase. The general characteristics of the composition should be improved to give an AM device having good general characteristics. Table 1 below summarizes the relationship between these two groups of general characteristics. The general characteristics of the composition will be further explained on the basis of a commercially available AM device. The temperature range of a nematic phase relates to the temperature range in which the device can be used. A desirable maximum temperature of the nematic phase is approximately 70° C. or higher and a desirable minimum temperature of the nematic phase approximately is −10° C. or lower. The viscosity of the composition relates to the response time of the device. A short response time is desirable for displaying moving images on the device. Accordingly, a small viscosity of the composition is desirable. A small viscosity at a low temperature is more desirable. TABLE 1 General Characteristics of Composition and AM Device General Characteristics General Characteristics No. of Composition of AM Device 1 wide temperature range of wide temperature range in nematic phase which device can be used 2 small viscosity1) short response time 3 Suitable optical anisotropy large contrast ratio 4 positively or negatively large low threshold voltage and dielectric anisotropy small electric power consumption large contrast ratio 5 large specific resistance large voltage holding ratio and large contrast ratio 6 high stability to ultraviolet long service life light and heat 1)A liquid crystal composition can he injected into a liquid crystal display device in a shorter period of time The optical anisotropy of the composition relates to the contrast ratio of the device. The product (Δn×d) of the optical anisotropy (Δn) of the composition and the cell gap (d) of the device is designed so as to maximize the contrast ratio. A suitable value of the product depends on the kind of operating mode. In a device having a VA mode or a PSA mode, a suitable value is in the range of approximately 0.30 micrometer to approximately 0.40 micrometer, and in a device having an IPS mode, a suitable value is in the range of approximately 0.20 micrometer to approximately 0.30 micrometer. In these cases, a composition having a large optical anisotropy is desirable for a device having a small cell gap. A large absolute value of the dielectric anisotropy in the composition contributes to a low threshold voltage, small electric power consumption and a large contrast ratio of the device. Accordingly, a large absolute value of the dielectric anisotropy is desirable. A large specific resistance of the composition contributes to a large voltage holding ratio and a large contrast ratio of the device. Accordingly, it is desirable that a composition should have a large specific resistance at room temperature and also at a high temperature in the initial stage. It is desirable that a composition should have a large specific resistance at room temperature and also at a high temperature after it has been used for a long time. The stability of the composition to ultraviolet light and heat relates to the service life of the liquid crystal display device. In the case where the stability is high, the device has a long service life. Such characteristics are desirable for an AM device used in a liquid crystal projector, a liquid crystal television and so forth. A composition having positive dielectric anisotropy is used for an AM device having a TN mode. On the other hand, a composition having negative dielectric anisotropy is used for an AM device having a VA mode. A composition having positive or negative dielectric anisotropy is used for an AM device having an IPS mode or an FFS mode. A composition having positive or negative dielectric anisotropy is used for an AM device having a PSA mode. Regarding the AM device having a PSA mode, examples of a liquid crystal composition having negative dielectric anisotropy are disclosed in Patent Documents No. 1 to 6. PRIOR ART Patent Documents Patent Document No. 1: JP 2003-307720 A. Patent Document No. 2: JP 2004-131704 A. Patent Document No. 3: JP 2006-133619 A. Patent Document No. 4: EP 1,889,894 A. Patent Document No. 5: JP 2010-537010 A. Patent Document No. 6: JP 2010-537256 A. A desirable AM device has characteristics such as a wide temperature range in which the device can be used, a short response time, a large contrast ratio, a low threshold voltage, a large voltage holding ratio and a long service life. Response time that is even one millisecond shorter than that of other devices is desirable. Thus, desirable characteristics of the composition include a high maximum temperature of a nematic phase, a low minimum temperature of a nematic phase, a small viscosity, a suitable optical anisotropy, a large positive or negative dielectric anisotropy, a large specific resistance, high stability to ultraviolet light and heat, etc. In a liquid crystal display device having a PSA mode, a liquid crystal composition including a polymer is used. First, a small amount of a polymerizable compound is added to a liquid crystal composition, which is poured into a device. Next, the composition is irradiated with ultraviolet light while a voltage is applied between the substrates of the device. The polymerizable compound forms a network in the composition by the polymerization. Since the orientation of liquid crystal molecules can be adjusted by the polymer in this composition, the response time of the device is decreased and the image burn-in improved. Such effect of the polymer is expected for a device having a mode such as TN, ECB, OCB, IPS, FFS or VA. A polymerizable compound having a rod-like molecular structure generally tends to have a great ability to orient liquid crystal molecules, but its solubility in a liquid crystal composition is not so high. Thus, a suitable combination of a polymerizable compound and a liquid crystal composition becomes important. The composition is required to have characteristics suitable for a liquid crystal display device. Thus, the response time of the device is decreased and the image burn-in is improved if a suitable combination of a polymerizable compound and liquid crystal compounds can be found. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The invention provides a liquid crystal composition that includes a polymerizable compound and is good in at least one of characteristics such as a high maximum temperature of a nematic phase, a low minimum temperature of a nematic phase, a small viscosity, a suitable optical anisotropy (a small optical anisotropy or a large optical anisotropy), a large negative dielectric anisotropy and a large specific resistance.

These compounds can be synthesized by known methods. The synthetic methods will be exemplified as follows. The compound (1) is prepared by the method described in JP 2012-001526 A. Methods for forming Z1 and Z2 are described in WO 2010-131600 A. A method for converting ring-O—CH2—CHO to ring-O—CH═CH—O-Bz is described in Scheme 4 of J. Org. Chem., 65, 2875-2886 (2000). The compound (2-1-1) and the compound (2-5-1) are prepared by the method described in JP H02-503441 A (1990). The compound (3-1-1) and the compound (3-5-1) are prepared by the method described in JP S59-176221 A (1984). Compounds whose synthetic methods are not described above can be prepared according to the methods described in books such as Organic Syntheses (John Wiley & Sons, Inc.), Organic Reactions (John Wiley & Sons, Inc.), Comprehensive Organic Synthesis (Pergamon Press), and New Experimental Chemistry Course (Shin Jikken Kagaku Kouza, in Japanese; Maruzen Co., Ltd.). The composition is prepared according to known methods using the compounds thus obtained. For example, the component compounds are mixed and dissolved in each other by heating. Last, the use of the composition will be described. Most of the compositions have a minimum temperature of approximately −10° C. or lower, a maximum temperature of approximately 70° C. or higher, and an optical anisotropy in the range of approximately 0.07 to approximately 0.20. A device containing this composition has a large voltage holding ratio. The composition is suitable for an AM device. The composition is suitable especially for a transmission-type AM device. A composition having an optical anisotropy in the range of approximately 0.08 to approximately 0.25 may be prepared by adjusting the ratio of component compounds or by mixing with other liquid crystal compound(s). The composition can be used as a composition having a nematic phase, or as an optically active composition through addition of an optically active compound. The composition can be used for an AM device and also for a PM device. The composition can also be used for an AM device or a PM device having a mode such as PC, TN, STN, ECB, OCB, IPS, VA or PSA. It is especially desirable to use the composition for an AM device having a PSA mode. These devices may be of a reflection type, a transmission type or a semi-transmission type. It is desirable to use the composition for a transmission-type device. The composition can be used for an amorphous silicon-TFT device or a polysilicon-TFT device. The composition can also be used for a nematic curvilinear aligned phase (NCAP) device prepared by micro-capsulating the composition, and for a polymer dispersed (PD) device in which a three-dimensional network-polymer is formed in the composition. One example of the methods for producing the liquid crystal display device is as follows. A device having two substrates called an array substrate and a color filter substrate is prepared. At least one of the substrates has an electrode layer. On the other hand, liquid crystal compounds are mixed to give a liquid crystal composition. The compound (1) is added to this composition. An additive may be added as required. The liquid crystal composition (or the liquid crystal material) is poured into the device. The device is irradiated with light while a voltage is applied. Ultraviolet light is preferable in the case of the compound (1). The compound (1) is polymerized by irradiation with light. A liquid crystal composition including a polymer is formed by the polymerization. A polymer sustained alignment (PSA) type liquid crystal display device is produced by this procedure. In the procedure, liquid crystal molecules are oriented by the effect of an electric field when a voltage is applied. The molecules of the compound (1) are also oriented according to the orientation. A polymer where the orientation is maintained is formed since the compound (1) is polymerized by ultraviolet light under these conditions. The response time of the device is decreased by the effect of the polymer. Image burn-in can also be improved at the same time by the effect of the polymer, since the burn-in is a malfunction of liquid crystal molecules. EXAMPLES The invention will be explained below in more detail based on examples, but is not limited by these examples. The compounds prepared herein were identified by means of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-NMR) and so forth. The melting points of the compounds were determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). First, analytical methods will be described. 1H-NMR Analysis: A model DRX-500 apparatus made by Bruker BioSpin Corporation was used for the measurement. In the measurement of 1H-NMR, a sample prepared in Examples or the like was dissolved in a deuterated solvent such as CDCl3, and measured under the conditions of room temperature, 500 MHz and an accumulation of 24 scans. Tetramethylsilane was used as an internal standard. In the explanation of the NMR spectra, the symbols s, d, t, q and m stand for a singlet, a doublet, a triplet, a quartet, and a multiplet, respectively. HPLC Analysis: Model Prominence (LC-20AD; SPD-20A) made by Shimadzu Corporation was used for measurement. A column YMC-Pack ODS-A (length: 150 mm, bore: 4.6 mm, particle size: 5 micrometers) made by YMC Co., Ltd. was used. An acetonitrile/water mixture (80/20 by volume) was used as an eluent, and the flow rate was adjusted to 1 mL/minute. A UV detector, a RI detector, a Corona detector and so forth were suitably used as a detector. A wavelength of 254 nm was used for detection. A sample was dissolved in acetonitrile, and 1 microliter of the solution (0.1 wt %) was injected into the sample injector. Model C-R7Aplus made by Shimadzu Corporation was used as a recorder. The resulting chromatogram showed the retention time of peaks and the peak areas corresponding to the component compounds. The ratio of the peak areas in a chromatogram obtained by the HPLC relates to the ratio of component compounds. In general, the percentages by weight of component compounds are not the same as the percentages of peak areas. However, the percentages by weight of component compounds may be calculated from the percentages of peak areas if the column described above is used. In this invention, this is because there is no significant difference among the correction coefficients of the component compounds. GC Analysis: A Gas Chromatograph Model GC-14B made by Shimadzu Corporation was used for the measurement. Helium was used as a carrier gas (2 mL/minute). The temperature of the sample injector was set at 280° C. and the temperature of the detector (FID) was set at 300° C. A capillary column DB-1 (length: 30 m, bore: 0.32 mm, film thickness: 0.25 micrometer; dimethylpolysiloxane as a stationary liquid phase; non-polar) made by Agilent Technologies Inc. was used for the separation of component compounds. After the column had been maintained at 200° C. for 2 minutes, it was further heated to 280° C. at the rate of 5° C. per minute. A sample was dissolved in acetone, and 1 microliter of the solution (0.1 wt %) was injected into the sample injector. A recorder used was a Model C-R5A Chromatopac Integrator made by Shimadzu Corporation or its equivalent. The resulting gas chromatogram showed the retention time of peaks and the peak areas corresponding to the component compounds. Chloroform or hexane, for example, may also be used as a solvent for diluting the sample. The following capillary columns may also be used for the separation of the component compounds: HP-1 (length: 30 m, bore: 0.32 mm, film thickness: 0.25 micrometer) made by Agilent Technologies Inc., Rtx-1 (length: 30 m, bore: 0.32 mm, film thickness: 0.25 micrometer) made by Restek Corporation, BP-1 (length: 30 m, bore: 0.32 mm, film thickness: 0.25 micrometer) made by SGE International Pty. Ltd, and so forth. A capillary column CBP1-M50-025 (length: 50 m, bore: 0.25 mm, film thickness: 0.25 micrometer) made by Shimadzu Corporation may be used in order to avoid an overlap of compound peaks. The ratio of the liquid crystal compounds included in a composition is calculated according to the following method. The liquid crystal compounds can be detected using a gas chromatograph. The ratio of the peak areas in the gas chromatogram corresponds to the ratio (molar ratio) of the liquid crystal compounds. When the capillary columns described above are used, the correction coefficient of the respective liquid crystal compounds may be regarded as one. Accordingly, the ratio (percentage by weight) of the liquid crystal compound can be calculated from the ratio of peak areas with correction for the molar ratio. Ultraviolet and Visible Spectrophotometric Analysis: Model PharmaSpec UV-1700 made by Shimadzu Corporation was used for the measurement. Wavelengths in the range of 190 nm to 700 nm were used for detection. A sample was dissolved in acetonitrile, giving a 0.01 mmol/L solution, which was placed in a quartz cell (optical path length: 1 cm) and measured. DSC Measurement: A Perkin-Elmer differential scanning calorimeter, a DSC-7 System or a Diamond DSC System, was used for the measurement. The sample was heated and then cooled at the rate of 3° C. per minute. The starting point of an endothermic peak or an exothermic peak caused by a phase change of the sample was obtained by means of extrapolation, and the melting point was determined. Comparison of Solubility in a Liquid Crystal Composition: A polymerizable compound was added to a liquid crystal composition and tried to be dissolved. After a certain period of time had elapsed at a certain temperature, whether or not all of the crystals were dissolved in the liquid crystal composition was observed visually. Sample for Measurement: A composition itself was used as a sample when the characteristics such as the maximum temperature, the viscosity and the optical anisotropy were measured. When the characteristics of a compound were measured, the sample for measurement was prepared by mixing 15 wt % of the compound and 85 wt % of a mother liquid crystal. The characteristic values of the compound were calculated from the measured values, according to the following extrapolation method: (extrapolated value)=[(measured value of a sample for measurement)−0.85×(measured value of mother liquid crystals)]/0.15. When a smectic phase (or crystals) separated out in this ratio at 25° C., the ratio of the compound to the mother liquid crystals was changed step by step in the order of (10 wt %/90 wt %), (5 wt %/95 wt %) and (1 wt %/99 wt %). The values of the maximum temperature, the viscosity, the optical anisotropy and the dielectric anisotropy regarding the compound were obtained by the extrapolation method. The components and their ratio in the mother liquid crystal were as follows. The characteristic values were measured according to the following methods. Most of them are methods described in the JEITA standards (JEITA-ED-2521B) which was deliberated and established by Japan Electronics and Information Technology Industries Association (abbreviated to JEITA), or the modified versions of the methods. (1) Maximum Temperature of Nematic Phase (NI; ° C.): The sample was placed on a hot plate in a melting point apparatus equipped with a polarizing microscope and was heated at the rate of 1° C. per minute. The temperature was measured when a part of the sample began to change from a nematic phase to an isotropic liquid. The upper limit of the temperature range of a nematic phase may be abbreviated to “the maximum temperature”. (2) Minimum Temperature of Nematic Phase (Tc; ° C.): A sample having a nematic phase was placed in glass vials and then kept in freezers at temperatures of 0° C., −10° C., −20° C., −30° C. and −40° C. for 10 days, and then the liquid crystal phases were observed. For example, when the sample maintained the nematic phase at −20° C. and changed to crystals or a smectic phase at −30° C., Tc was expressed as <−20° C. The lower limit of the temperature range of a nematic phase may be abbreviated to “the minimum temperature”. (3) Viscosity (Bulk Viscosity; n; Measured at 20° C.; mPa·s): The viscosity was measured by use of an E-type viscometer. (4) Optical Anisotropy (Refractive Index Anisotropy; Δn; Measured at 25° C.): An Abbe refractometer in which the ocular was equipped with a polarizing plate was used for the measurement, using light at the wavelength of 589 nanometers. The surface of the main prism was rubbed in one direction, and then a sample was dropped onto the main prism. A refractive index (n∥) was measured when the direction of polarized light was parallel to that of the rubbing. A refractive index (n⊥) was measured when the direction of polarized light was perpendicular to that of the rubbing. The value of optical anisotropy was calculated from the equation: Δn=n∥−n⊥. (5) Dielectric Anisotropy (Δ∈; Measured at 25° C.): The value of dielectric anisotropy was calculated from the equation: Δ∈=∈∥−∈⊥. The dielectric constant ∈∥ and ∈⊥ were measured as follows. 1) Measurement of the dielectric constant ∈∥: A solution of octadecyltriethoxysilane (0.16 mL) in ethanol (20 mL) was applied to a thoroughly cleaned glass substrate. The glass substrate was rotated with a spinner, and then heated at 150° C. for one hour. The sample was poured into a VA device in which the distance between the two glass substrates (cell gap) was 4 micrometers, and then the device was sealed with an adhesive curable with ultraviolet light. Sine waves (0.5 V, 1 kHz) were applied to the device, and the dielectric constant (∈∥) in the major axis direction of liquid crystal molecules was measured after 2 seconds. 2) Measurement of the dielectric constant ∈⊥: A polyimide solution was applied to a thoroughly cleaned glass substrate. The glass substrate was calcined, and then the resulting alignment film was subjected to rubbing. The sample was poured into a TN device in which the distance between the two glass substrates (cell gap) was 9 micrometers and the twist angle was 80 degrees. Sine waves (0.5 V, 1 kHz) were applied to the device, and the dielectric constant (∈⊥) in the minor axis direction of liquid crystal molecules was measured after 2 seconds. (6) Threshold Voltage (Vth; Measured at 25° C.; V): An LCD evaluation system Model LCD-5100 made by Otsuka Electronics Co., Ltd. was used for the measurement. The light source was a halogen lamp. The sample was poured into a VA device having a normally black mode, in which the distance between the two glass substrates (cell gap) was 4 micrometers and the rubbing direction was anti-parallel, and then the device was sealed with an adhesive curable with ultraviolet light. The voltage applied to the device (60 Hz, rectangular waves) was increased stepwise from 0 V to 20 V in an increment of 0.02 V. The device was simultaneously irradiated with light in the perpendicular direction, and the amount of light passing through the device was measured. A voltage-transmittance curve was prepared, in which the maximum amount of light corresponded to 100% transmittance and the minimum amount of light corresponded to 0% transmittance. The threshold voltage was the voltage at 10% transmittance. (7) Voltage Holding Ratio (VHR-1; Measured at 25° C.; %): The TN device used for the measurement had a polyimide-alignment film, and the distance between the two glass substrates (cell gap) thereof was 5 micrometers. The sample was poured into the device, and then the device was sealed with an adhesive curable with ultraviolet light. A pulse voltage (60 microseconds at 5 V) was applied to the TN device to charge the device. The attenuated voltage was measured for 16.7 milliseconds with a high-speed voltmeter, and the area A between the voltage curve and the horizontal axis in a unit cycle was obtained. The voltage holding ratio was the percentage of the area A to an area B that was the area without attenuation. (8) Voltage Holding Ratio (VHR-2; Measured at 80° C.; %): The TN device used for measurement had a polyimide-alignment film, and the distance between the two glass substrates (cell gap) thereof was 5 micrometer. The sample was poured into the device, and then the device was sealed with an adhesive curable with ultraviolet light. A pulse voltage (60 microseconds at 5 V) was applied to the TN device to charge the device. The attenuated voltage was measured for 16.7 milliseconds with a high-speed voltmeter and the area A between the voltage curve and the horizontal axis in a unit cycle was obtained. The voltage holding ratio was a percentage of the area A to an area B that was the area without attenuation. (9) Voltage Holding Ratio (VHR-3; Measured at 25° C.; %): The stability to ultraviolet light was evaluated by measuring the voltage holding ratio after irradiation with ultraviolet light. The TN device used for measurement had a polyimide-alignment film, and the cell gap thereof was 5 micrometers. The sample was poured into this device, and then the device was irradiated with light for 20 minutes. The light source was an ultra high-pressure mercury lamp USH-500D (produced by Ushio, Inc.), and the distance between the device and the light source was 20 cm. In the measurement of VHR-3, the attenuated voltage was measured for 16.7 milliseconds. A composition having a large VHR-3 has a high stability to ultraviolet light. The value of VHR-3 is preferably 90% or more, and more preferably 95% or more. (10) Voltage Holding Ratio (VHR-4; Measured at 25° C.; %): A TN device into which the sample was poured was heated in a constant-temperature bath at 80° C. for 500 hours, and then the stability to heat was evaluated by measuring the voltage holding ratio. In the measurement of VHR-4, the attenuated voltage was measured for 16.7 milliseconds. A composition having a large VHR-4 has a high stability to heat. (11) Response Time (τ; Measured at 25° C.; Millisecond): An LCD evaluation system Model LCD-5100 made by Otsuka Electronics Co., Ltd. was used for the measurement. The light source was a halogen lamp. The low-pass filter was set at 5 kHz. The sample was poured into a VA device having a normally black mode, in which the cell gap between the two glass substrates was 3.2 micrometers, the alignment film was prepared from a homeotropic alignment agent, and the rubbing direction was anti-parallel, and then the device was sealed with an adhesive curable with ultraviolet light. The device was heated at 110° C. for 30 minutes (annealing). After the device was allowed to return to room temperature, it was irradiated with ultraviolet light of 25 mW/cm2 for 400 seconds while a voltage of 15 volts was applied. A mercury-xenon lamp, Model Execure 4000-D made by Hoya Candeo Optronics Corp., was used for ultraviolet irradiation. Rectangular waves (60 Hz, 10 V, 0.5 second) were applied to the device. The device was simultaneously irradiated with light in the perpendicular direction, and the amount of light passing through the device was measured. The maximum amount of light corresponded to 100% transmittance, and the minimum amount of light corresponded to 0% transmittance. The response time was the period of time required for the change from 0% to 90% transmittance (rise time; millisecond). (12) Specific Resistance (ρ; Measured at 25° C.; Ωcm): The sample (1.0 mL) was poured into a vessel equipped with electrodes. A DC voltage of 10 V was applied to the vessel, and the DC current was measured after 10 seconds. The specific resistance was calculated from the following equation: (specific resistance)=[(voltage)×(electric capacity of vessel)]/[(DC current)×(dielectric constant in vacuum)]. The compounds described in Comparative Examples and Examples were expressed as symbols according to the definition in Table 3 below. In Table 3, the configuration of 1,4-cyclohexylene is trans. The parenthesized number next to a symbolized expression in the examples corresponds to the number of the corresponding compound. The symbol (−) means any other liquid crystal compound.
