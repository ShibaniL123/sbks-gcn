Step 5
1-(Benzyloxy)heptane-3,5-dione
Oxalyl chloride (1.21 g, 9.54 mmol) was slowly added dropwise to a solution of dimethyl sulfoxide (1.50 g, 19.1 mmol) in dichloromethane (50 mL) at -65°C under nitrogen atmosphere. The reaction solution was stirred at the temperature for 20 minutes, and 7-(benzyloxy)-5-hydroxyheptan-3-one (750 mg, 3.18 mmol) was added and the stirring was continued for 2 hours. Triethylamine (3.30 g, 32.5 mmol) was added and the stirring was continued at -65°C for 1 hour and the temperature was slowly warmed to 25°C. The reaction solution was extracted with dichloromethane (10 mL x 2) after adding brine (5mL). The organic phases were combined, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, concentrated under reduced pressure, and purified by preparative TLC plate (5:1 petroleum ether: ethyl acetate, Rf = 0.5) to give 1-(benzyloxy)heptane-3,5-dione (220 mg, as a yellow oil) with a yield of 30%.
