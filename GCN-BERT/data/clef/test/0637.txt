PHENYLEPHRINE RESINATE PARTICLES FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to phenylephrine particles suitable for solid, semi solid or liquid dosage forms. The phenylephrine particles, which may be coated, release phenylephrine at rates that provide pharmaceutically suitable plasma concentrations for an extended period of time. The present invention also relates to a process for manufacturing dosage forms containing the phenylephrine particles and to methods for alleviating nasal and respiratory congestion in human subjects with the oral administration of the dosage forms. The dosage forms can further comprise one or more additional therapeutically active agents selected from one or more of the group consisting of antihistamines, decongestants, analgesics, anti-inflammatories, anti-pyretics, cough suppressants and expectorants. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Phenylephrine is a potent vasoconstrictor, possessing both direct and indirect sympathomimetic effects [Hoffman 2001], The dominant and direct effect is agonism at al-adrenergic receptors. Stimulation of al-adrenergic receptors located on capacitance blood vessels of the nasal mucosa (postcapillary venules) results in vasoconstriction, decreased blood volume, and a decrease in the volume of the nasal mucosa (nasal decongestion) [Johnson 1993], Constricted blood vessels allow less fluid to enter the nose, throat, and sinus linings, which results in decreased inflammation of nasal membranes as well as decreased mucous production [Johnson 1993], Thus, by constriction of blood vessels, mainly those located in the nasal passages, phenylephrine causes a decrease in nasal congestion [Hoffman 2001, Empey 1981], Phenylephrine is a Category I (Generally Regarded as Safe and Effective (GRASE)) over-thecounter (OTC) oral nasal decongestant. Globally, phenylephrine has been available since the 1960’s, and since 1996, phenylephrine has been widely used in the United States. Phenylephrine hydrochloride, which is widely used in OTC adult and pediatric cough and cold medicines, is indicated for use by adults and children for the temporary relief of nasal congestion due to the common cold, hay fever, or other upper respiratory allergies (allergic rhinitis). It is commercially available in 10 mg tablets for oral administration in adults. The dosing regimen is one 10 mg dose of phenylephrine every four hours, not to exceed 60 mg (six doses) in 24 hours. Complete information is available in the OTC monograph labeling for approved drugs. Phenylephrine, chemical name (R)-l-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-2-methylaminoethanol, is commercially available as a hydrochloride salt. The empirical formula is C9H13Ν02·ΗΟ and the molecular weight is 203.67. The compound, which is a white to off-white crystalline powder, has the following chemical structure: The principal routes of phenylephrine metabolism are sulfate conjugation (mainly in the intestinal wall) and oxidative deamination by both the A and Β forms of monoamine oxidase [Suzuki 1979], Glucuronidation also occurs, but to a lesser extent. In one study, following a 30 mg dose administered orally over eight hours [Ibrahim 1983], phenylephrine was metabolized to phenylephrine-sulfate, m-hydroxymandelic acid, phenylephrine-glucuronide and m-hydroxy-phenylglycol-sulfate at 47%, 30%, 12%, and 6% of the dose, respectively. Deamination is the predominant metabolic pathway after intravenous injection of phenylephrine [Hengstmann 1982], whereas sulfate conjugation is the predominant pathway after oral administration. Phase I and Phase II metabolites of phenylephrine in humans are shown below. The percentage values in the schematic refer to the percent of an oral dose as reported by Ibrahim. Pi t«:ys gi ycoh'3 Efficacy data from clinical trials of immediate-release phenylephrine use in adults indicate that phenylephrine is an effective nasal decongestant. Acetaminophen is a para-aminophenol derivative with analgesic and antipyretic activity. It is used for the temporary relief of minor aches and pains associated with the common cold, backache, headache, toothache, menstrual cramps, and muscular aches; and for the temporary relief of the minor pain of arthritis and for the reduction of fever. The adult dose of acetaminophen in the United States is 1000 mg every four to six hours with a maximum of 4000 mg in 24 hours. The adult dose of extended release acetaminophen is 1300 mg every eight hours with a maximum of 3900 mg in 24 hours. Acetaminophen is primarily metabolized by the liver via three major parallel pathways: glucuronidation, sulfation, and oxidation [Miners 1983; Slattery 1989; Lee 1992; Miners 1992], Both the glucuronic and oxidative pathways adhere to a first-order rate process, which means the concentration of acetaminophen metabolized increases as the concentration in the liver increases. The sulfate pathway adheres to Michaelis-Menten kinetics, which means the concentration of acetaminophen metabolized remains constant once the concentration in the liver increases above a saturation level. A schematic of acetaminophen metabolism is shown below. Less than 9% of a therapeutic dose is excreted unchanged in the urine [Miners 1992], The major metabolic pathway is glucuronidation, where 47% to 62% of the acetaminophen dose conjugates with glucuronide. These glucuronide conjugates are inactive and nontoxic [Koch-Weser 1976], and are secreted in bile and eliminated in the urine. Glucuronide conjugation is catalyzed primarily by one isoform of glucuronyltransferase (UGT1A6) [Court 2001] with uridine 5’-diphosphoglucuronic acid as an essential cofactor. The second major pathway of acetaminophen metabolism is sulfation, where 25% to 36% of the dose conjugates with sulfate. These sulfate ester conjugates are also inactive and nontoxic [Koch-Weser 1976], and are readily excreted in the urine. Sulfation is mediated by sulfotransferases, which are heterogeneous cytosolic enzymes, and 3’-phosphoadenosine 5’phosphate is a cofactor. Sulfotransferase activity rather than sulfate depletion is the ratecontrolling factor of acetaminophen sulfation [Blackledge 1991], The third pathway is oxidation, where 5% to 8% of the acetaminophen dose is metabolized via the cytochrome P-450 enzyme system. The cytochrome P-450 isoenzyme that is primarily responsible for acetaminophen metabolism is CYP2E1 [Manyike 2000], When acetaminophen is metabolized by CYP2E1, it forms a highly reactive intermediate, N-acetyl-p-benzoquinoneimine (NAPQI). Because NAPQI is highly reactive, it cannot be measured outside the liver nor can it accumulate. This intermediate is rapidly inactivated by hepatocellular stores of glutathione to form cysteine and mercapturate conjugates, which are both inactive and nontoxic [Koch-Weser 1976], These conjugates are excreted in the urine [Mitchell 1974], There is a need for less frequent delivery of phenylephrine. Less frequent administration results in improved patient compliance. In addition, constant therapeutic plasma levels of active components can be more effective and even efficacious compared to the fluctuations seen when multiple doses of a conventional immediate release formulation are given. Sustained effective levels could decrease the severity and frequency of side effects seen with high peak plasma levels. Thus, formulations of phenylephrine that can be administered less frequently, for example, once every 6, 8, 12, 16, 20, or 24 hours, are needed. There is also a need to match the duration of phenylephrine with actives that provide a longer duration than immediate release phenylephrine.

The present invention may be more fully understood by reference to the Figures, Detailed Description and Examples which follow. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES Figure 1 shows the mean plasma concentration profile of phenylephrine upon administration of coated extended release (ER) phenylephrine resinate particles containing 20 mg phenylephrine. Referring to Figure 1, the y axis represents the concentration of free phenylephrine in plasma in picograms (pg) per milliliter (mL). The χ axis represents time in hours. Figure 1 shows that the average concentration of phenylephrine reached a peak (Cmax) at about 2 hours. Figure 1 also shows a secondary peak at about 12 hours. Figure 2 shows the individual plasma concentration profiles of phenylephrine upon administration of coated ER phenylephrine resinate particles containing 20 mg phenylephrine. Referring to Figure 2, the intersubject variability is good for modified release phenylephrine. The range of Cmax occurred from about 1 hour to about 4.5 hours. The secondary peak at about 12 hours was observed for all subjects. Figure 3 shows the mean plasma concentration profile of phenylephrine upon administration of coated ER phenylephrine HC1 particles containing 20 mg phenylephrine. Referring to Figure 3, the dashed line is the profile from Figure 1 for comparison purposes. A slightly higher Cmax with the phenylephrine resinate particles was observed. A secondary peak at about 12 hours is observed in both profiles. This may be the result of less phenylephrine being metabolized presystemically by the gut wall as a result of the particles quick movement down the GI tract. Release of phenylephrine in the colon would result in higher absorption at a later time. Figure 4 shows the individual plasma concentration profiles of phenylephrine upon administration of coated ER phenylephrine HC1 particles containing 20 mg phenylephrine. Figure 5 shows the mean plasma concentration profile of phenylephrine upon administration of coated ER phenylephrine resinate particles containing 15 mg phenylephrine and liquid IR phenylephrine HC1 containing 5 mg phenylephrine (the “ER-IR blend”). Referring to Figure 5, the unbroken line represents the ER-IR blend. Again, the curve for this treatment is consistent with what was seen with the resinate and the HC1 formulations. For the ER-IR blend, there are two peaks within the first 2 hours; one mainly from the IR dose and the other from the accumulation of the IR and ER doses. The Cmax was reached faster and maintained for a longer period of time. An ER-IR blend thus appears beneficial in terms of onset of efficacy. Figure 6 shows the individual plasma concentration profiles of phenylephrine upon administration of coated ER phenylephrine resinate particles containing 15 mg phenylephrine and liquid IR phenylephrine HC1 containing 5 mg phenylephrine. Figure 7 shows the mean plasma concentration profile of phenylephrine upon administration of liquid IR phenylephrine HC1 containing 20 mg phenylephrine. Referring to Figure 7, the unbroken line represents the profile for the currently marketed IR liquid product and the dashed line is the profile from Figure 5 for comparison. The Cmax of the ER-IR blend is lower than the Cmax of the IR form. Figure 8 shows the individual plasma concentration profiles of phenylephrine upon administration of liquid IR phenylephrine HC1 containing 20 mg phenylephrine. Figure 9 shows the mean plasma concentration profile of phenylephrine upon administration of coated ER phenylephrine resinate particles containing 22.5 mg phenylephrine and liquid IR phenylephrine HC1 containing 7.5 mg phenylephrine (the “ER-IR blend”) and compares to liquid IR phenylephrine HC1 containing 20 mg phenylephrine. Figures 10Α and 10Β compare the mean plasma concentration profile of phenylephrine (1) upon administration of coated ER phenylephrine resinate particles containing 15 mg phenylephrine and liquid IR phenylephrine HC1 containing 5 mg phenylephrine (Figure 10Α) and (2) upon administration of coated ER phenylephrine resinate particles containing 22.5 mg phenylephrine and liquid IR phenylephrine HC1 containing 7.5 mg phenylephrine (Figure 10Β) with (3) liquid IR phenylephrine HC1 containing 20 mg phenylephrine. Figure 11 compares the mean plasma concentration profiles of phenylephrine upon administration of (1) coated ER phenylephrine resinate particles containing 15 mg phenylephrine and liquid IR phenylephrine HC1 containing 5 mg phenylephrine with a (2) combination of (a) coated ER phenylephrine resinate particles containing 15 mg phenylephrine, (b) liquid IR phenylephrine HC1 containing 5 mg phenylephrine and (c) 1300 mg ER acetaminophen.

The following specific embodiments are to be construed as merely illustrative, and not as limiting the remainder of the disclosure in any way whatsoever. Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which the invention belongs. Also, all publications, patent applications, patents, and other references mentioned herein are incorporated by reference. As used herein, all percentages are by weight unless otherwise specified. In addition, all ranges set forth herein are meant to include any combinations of values between the two endpoints, inclusively. DEFINITIONS As used herein a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of phenylephrine includes, but is not limited to, phenylephrine hydrochloride, phenylephrine bitartrate, phenylephrine tannate, etc. In one preferred embodiment, the pharmaceutically acceptable salt of phenylephrine is phenylephrine hydrochloride. "AUC" as used herein means, for any given drug, the "area under the concentration-time curve" from dosing or activation of the drug to a time point, calculated by the trapezoidal rule. AUC is a parameter showing the cumulative plasma concentration of a drug over time, and is an indicator of the total amount and availability of a drug in the plasma. “Cmax” as used herein means the maximum (or peak) concentration that a drug achieves in tested area after the drug has been administrated and prior to the administration of a second dose. As used herein, “crystalline form” shall mean the non-amorphous form of the active ingredient such that it displays crystal like properties including, but not limited to, the ability to diffract visible light. Crystalline may also be used to describe an active ingredient in its pure form, i.e., e.g., without the addition of other excipients thereto. By “delayed release,” it is meant that, after administration, there is at least one period of time when an active ingredient is not being released from the dosage form, i.e., the release of the active ingredient(s) occurs at a time other than immediately following oral administration. As used herein, “dissolution medium” shall mean any suitable liquid environment in which the suspension dosage form of the present invention can be dissolved, such as, for example, the in vitro dissolution media used for testing of the product, or gastro-intestinal fluids. Suitable in vitro dissolution media used for testing the dissolution of the active ingredient or ingredients from the suspension dosage form of the present invention include those described in the United States Pharmacopeia. A "dosage", “dosage form” or "dose" as used herein means the amount of a pharmaceutical composition comprising therapeutically active agent(s) administered at a time. "Dosage", “dosage form” or "dose" includes administration of one or more units of pharmaceutical composition administered at the same time. In one embodiment, the dosage form is a tablet. In one embodiment the dosage form is a multilayer tablet. In the embodiment comprising a multilayer tablet, one layer may comprise an immediate release portion and another layer may comprise an extended release portion. In the embodiment comprising a multilayer tablet, one layer may comprise the phenylephrine resinate particles, and another layer may comprise an immediate release form of phenylephrine and/or a second active ingredient. In one embodiment the dosage form comprising phenylephrine resinate particles is a liquid filled soft-gel. As used herein “drug-resin complex” shall mean the bound form of an active ingredient, including but not limited to the pharmaceutical active ingredients, and an ion exchange resin. The drug-resin complex is also referred to in the art as a “resinate.” An ion exchange resin that may be used in accordance with the invention is Amberlite™ IRP 69, The Dow Chemical Company, an insoluble, strongly acidic, sodium form cationic exchange resin derived from sulfonated copolymer of styrene and divinylbenzene. The mobile, or exchangeable cation is sodium, which can be exchanged for, or replaced by, many cationic (basic) species, including, e.g., copper, zinc, iron, calcium, strontium, magnesium and lithium. Adsorption of drug onto ion exchange resin particles to form the drug/resin complex is a well known technique as shown in U.S. Patents Nos. 2,990,332 and 4,221,778. In general the drug is mixed with an aqueous suspension of the resin, and the complex is then washed and dried. Adsorption of drug onto the resin may be detected by measuring a change in the pH of the reaction medium, or by measuring a change in concentration of sodium or drug. The drug/resin complex formed can be collected and washed with ethanol and/or water to insure removal of any unbound drug. The complexes are usually air-dried in trays at room or elevated temperature. The drug/resin complex has a ratio of phenylephrine to resin of about 0.25:1 to about 0.65:1, preferably about 0.30:1 to about 0.55:1, preferably about 0.35:1 to about 0.45:1. “Enteric” shall mean being able to be dissolved at a pH of greater than about 5.0 or greater than about 5.5 or greater than about 6.0 or that which is found in the intestine. By “extended release,” it is meant that, after administration, an active ingredient is released from the dosage form in a substantially continuous, regulated manner, and the time for complete release, i.e., depletion, of the active ingredient from the dosage form is longer than that associated with an immediate release dosage form of the same. Types of extended release include controlled, sustained, prolonged, zero-order, first-order, pulsatile, and the like. As used herein, “immediate release” means that the dissolution characteristics of at least one active ingredient meet USP specifications for immediate release tablets containing that active ingredient. An active ingredient having an immediate release property may be dissolved in the gastrointestinal contents, with no intention of delaying or prolonging the dissolution of the active ingredient. “Liquid dosage forms” may nonexclusively include suspensions or elixirs, wherein one or more of the active ingredients is dissolved, partially dissolved or in an undissolved or suspended state. As used herein, "modified release" shall apply to the altered release or dissolution of an active ingredient in a dissolution medium, such as gastrointestinal fluids. Types of modified release include: 1) extended release; or 2) delayed release. In general, modified release dosage forms are formulated to make the active ingredient(s) available over an extended period of time after ingestion, which thereby allows for a reduction in dosing frequency compared to the dosing of the same active ingredient(s) in a conventional dosage form. Modified release dosage forms also permit the use of active ingredient combinations wherein the duration of one active ingredient may differ from the duration of another active ingredient. As used herein, “pharmacodynamics” or “PD” is the study of the relationship between drug concentration at the site of action and the resulting effect. As used herein, “pharmacokinetics” or “PK” is the study of the time course of drug absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion. As used herein, the term “phenylephrine” means benzynemethanol, 3-hydroxy-a[(methylamino)methyl], and includes, but is not limited to pharmaceutically acceptable salts, esters, isomers or derivatives thereof. As used herein, a drug "release rate" refers to the quantity of drug released from a dosage form per unit time, e.g., milligrams of drug released per hour (mg/hr). Drug release rates are calculated under in vitro dosage form dissolution testing conditions known in the art. As used herein, a drug release rate obtained at a specified time "following administration" refers to the in vitro drug release rate obtained at the specified time following commencement of an appropriate dissolution test, e.g., those set forth in USP 24 (United States Pharmacopeia 24, United States Pharmacopeia Convention, Inc., Rockville, MD). “Semipermeable,” as used herein, shall mean that water can pass through, and other molecules, including salts and the active ingredients described herein, are allowed to slowly diffuse through such a membrane when the membrane is in contact with an appropriate dissolution medium, e.g., gastro-intestinal fluids or in-vitro dissolution media. “Semi-solid dosage forms” shall mean dosage forms which are highly viscous and share some of the properties of liquids, including but not limited to (1) having the ability to substantially conform to something that applies pressure to it and causes its shape to deform; and (2) lacking the ability to flow as easily as a liquid. Semi-solid dosage forms also share some of the properties of solids, including but not limited to having a higher density and a defined shape. Semi-solids may nonexclusively include gels, chewy dosage forms, pectin based chewy forms, confectionery chewy forms, moldable gelatin type of forms. “Solid dosage forms” shall mean dosage forms which are substantially solid at room temperature and have a density of at least about 0.5 g/cc. Solid dosage forms may non exclusively include, agglomerated tablets, capsule-like medicaments, powder or granule filled capsules, powder or granule filled sachets, compressed tablets, coated tablets, chewable dosage forms, and fastdissolving dosage forms. As used herein, “substantially coated” with regard to particles shall mean that less than about 20%, e.g., less than about 15%, or less than about 1.0% of the surface area of the particle is exposed, e.g., not covered, with a desired coating. As used herein, the term “substantially covers” or “substantially continuous” when used to describe a coating means that the coating is generally continuous and generally covers the entire surface of the core or underlying layer, so that little to none of the active ingredient or underlying layer is exposed. The coatings which are applied to the particles can be layered wherein each layer is prepared in an aqueous (water based) or organic solvent system and added in succession until the desired coating level is achieved. “Therapeutic effect,” as used herein, shall mean any effect or action of an active ingredient intended to diagnose, treat, cure, mitigate, or prevent disease, or affect the structure or any function of the body. Specific embodiments of the present invention are illustrated by way of the following examples. This invention is not confined to the specific limitations set forth in these examples. EXAMPLES Phenylephrine extended release particles were developed in order to formulate into liquid and solid dosage forms. The phenylephrine extended release particles can be used to match duration with other actives (particularly pain actives) which may provide a longer duration than phenylephrine. Such actives include, but are not limited to, acetaminophen, ibuprofen and naproxen and salts and derivatives thereof. Example 1: Preparation of Formulation Containing Coated Phenylephrine Extended Release Particles A formulation that contains phenylephrine particles coated with a polymer coating was prepared. The formulation, which provides release of phenylephrine over an extended period of time, has proven to be stable at 25°C/60%RH for 24 months and at 40°C/75%RH for 3 months. Many granulated formulations of phenylephrine are not stable over time and undergo significant degradation. A batch of 3.203 kg of coated phenylephrine particles was prepared according to the formula in Table 1. The quantitative and batch formulas, respectively, are represented in Table 1.

Dissolution Analysis The coated phenylephrine particles from Step 14 were analyzed for dissolution from 0 to 14 hours using the apparatus described in United States Pharmacopeia <General Chapter <711> Dissolution^ Apparatus II, rotating paddles, utilizing UV detection at 274 nm. The dissolution media was 750 mL of 0. IN HC1 for the first hour and then was 1000 mL of a 0.05 Μ sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, for the second to the fourteenth hour. The temperature was 37°C and the rotation speed was 50 rpm. The dissolution showed that the percent of phenylephrine released versus a standard prepared at 100% of the amount of phenylephrine in the formulation was less than or equal to 50% in 1 hour, greater than or equal to 30% in 3 hours and greater than or equal to 50% in 8 hours. The method employed is below and the results are shown in Table 2 below. Dissolution method USP Apparatus (2 paddles, 50 rpm) 1. Verify that the dissolution media temperature has reached the target value (37°C). 2. Weigh out samples equivalent to 45 mg of phenylephrine HC1. Add samples (onto the surface of the medium solution) to each vessel containing 750 mL of 0.1Ν hydrochloric acid and start the dissolution test with the paddle speed at 50 rpm. After 1 hour of operation in 0. IN hydrochloric acid, complete the 1 hour time point measurement. Proceed immediately to the buffer stage by adding 250 mL of 0.20 Μ tribasic sodium phosphate. The pH of the buffer medium is 6.8 ± 0.05. 3. Measure the UV absorbance of phenylephrine HC1 released in the medium by using a LEAP fiber optic system with in line probes for UV measurement at 274 nm. 4. The amount of phenylephrine HC1 dissolved can be determined using the UV absorbance of the sample solution under test in comparison with that of a standard solution at the wavelength of 274 nm. The amount of phenylephrine HC1 dissolved can also be determined using the assay method below.

The samples included (1) Amberlite™ IRP69 resin, commercially available from The DOW Chemical Company, (2) unloaded resin having selected particle sizes (as prepared by Process A or Process Β, respectively), and (3) loaded resinate particles (i.e., containing phenylephrine). The particle size distribution was analyzed using approximately 75 grams per sample in an FMC Syntron Sieve analyzer (FMC Technologies, Houston, ΤΧ), with settings at 90 volts for 11 minutes. The sieves were treated with a light dusting of magnesium stearate to prevent sticking during operation. The results are shown in Tables 6 and 7. Particle size distribution can be analyzed on a smaller scale, using, e.g., an ATM L3P Sonic Sifter (Advantech Manufacturing, New Berlin, WI), which operates by using sonic pulses combined with mechanical agitation, to provide effective separation of particles.

First ΡΚ Study A pilot study was conducted on sixteen subjects to determine the pharmacokinetic profile, bioavailability and metabolism of the coated extended release phenylephrine particles from Example 1 and the coated extended release phenylephrine resinate particles from Example 2. The subjects were assigned to receive four treatments after an overnight fast. There was a seven day washout between the four periods. In both cases, coated particles equivalent to a 20 mg phenylephrine HC1 dose were administered in applesauce to healthy subjects. In addition, a combination of the extended release phenylephrine resinate particles from Example 2 and a commercial immediate-release liquid was evaluated. In the combination treatment, coated phenylephrine resinate particles equal to 15 mg phenylephrine HC1 were administered in applesauce, and 10 mL of liquid equal to 5 mg phenylephrine HC1 was administered by oral syringe. The coated extended release phenylephrine particles from Example 1 and the coated extended release phenylephrine resinate particles from Example 2 were compared to McNeil-PPC, Inc.’s Non-Drowsy Children’s Sudafed PE® Nasal Decongestant liquid (phenylephrine HC1 2.5mg/5mL). Table 11 summarizes the treatments in the first ΡΚ study. Table 11 Treatment Group Total Dose Over 8 Hours A (test) coated ER phenylephrine resinate particles containing 20 mg phenylephrine Β (test) coated ER phenylephrine HC1 particles containing 20 mg phenylephrine C (test) coated ER phenylephrine resinate particles containing 15 mg phenylephrine and liquid IR phenylephrine HC11 containing 5 mg phenylephrine D (reference) liquid IR phenylephrine HC1 containing 10 mg phenylephrine The coated ER phenylephrine resinate particles and the ER phenylephrine HC1 particles were administered orally after folding the measured amount into a 4 οζ cup of applesauce just prior to dosing. These single doses were swallowed without chewing, and followed with 240 mL of water. The phenylephrine HC1 liquid was administered orally using an oral syringe. To standardize the conditions for dosing the reference treatment, the first of two oral 10 mg doses of liquid were followed with a 4 οζ cup of applesauce and 240 mL of water. Serial blood samples were collected into K3-EDTA tubes at specific time points over 8 or 16 hours after dose. Β. Second ΡΚ Study A second pilot study was conducted: (i) to determine if 30 mg phenylephrine can attain similar maximum drug concentrations relative to two 10 mg doses of immediate-release phenylephrine given 4 hours apart; and (ii) to evaluate the ER ΡΚ profile and bioavailability of 20 mg phenylephrine and 1300 mg acetaminophen. The second pilot study was conducted on twenty subjects to determine the pharmacokinetic profiles, bioavailability and metabolism of (1) a combination of (a) the coated extended release phenylephrine resinate particles from Example 2 equal to 15 mg phenylephrine HC1, (b) 10 mL 1 The unit dose of approximately 84.2 mg coated ER phenylephrine resinate particles is equivalent to a 20 mg phenylephrine HC1 dose. The unit dose of approximately 63.2 mg coated ER phenylephrine resinate particles is equivalent to a 15 mg phenylephrine HC1 dose, and this latter unit dose was administered with 10 mL phenylephrine liquid 2.5 mg/5mL, for a total of dose equivalent to a 20 mg phenylephrine HC1. phenylephrine liquid equal to 5 mg phenylephrine HC1 and (c) 1300 mg extended release acetaminophen; (2) a combination of (a) the coated extended release phenylephrine resinate particles from Example 2 equal to 22.55 mg phenylephrine HC1 and (b) phenylephrine liquid equal to 7.5 mg phenylephrine HC1; (3) a combination of (a) phenylephrine liquid equal to 20 mg phenylephrine HC1 and (b) 1300 mg extended release acetaminophen; and (4) phenylephrine liquid equal to 20 mg phenylephrine HC1. Table 12 summarizes the treatments in the second ΡΚ study Table 12 Treatment Group Total Dose Over 8 Hours A (test) coated ER phenylephrine resinate containing 15 mg phenylephrine and liquid IR phenylephrine HC1 containing 5 mg phenylephrine and 1300 mg ER acetaminophen2 Β (test) coated ER phenylephrine resinate containing 22.5 mg phenylephrine and liquid IR phenylephrine HC1 containing 7.5 mg phenylephrine C (reference) liquid IR phenylephrine HC1 containing 20 mg phenylephrine and 1300 mg ER acetaminophen D (reference) liquid IR phenylephrine HC1 containing 20 mg phenylephrine Serial blood samples were collected into K3-EDTA tubes at specified time points over 12 or 20 hours. Results Results for the ΡΚ studies appear in Figures 1-11 and in Table 13 below. Table 13 - Comparison of Mean Parameters for First ΡΚ Study 2 The extended release acetaminophen tablet formulation was the same granulation formulation that is commercially available in Tylenol® Arthritis. HI AUC* (pg-hr/mL) 1241.7 1162.6 1237.8 1162.5 Cmax (pg/mL) 208.4 219.4 230.8 458 Tmax (hr) 2.5 2.8 1.97 Tmax 1 = 0.36 Tmax 2 = 4.54 Note: Treatments A, Β and C = AUC over 16 hours. Treatment D = AUC over 8 hours Figures are rounded off In sum, the results show that: The ER-IR blend containing 20 mg phenylephrine had a Cmax that was 50% of the 10 mg IR dose and an AUCinf that was 15% more than two 10 mg IR doses (20 mg). The ER-IR blend containing 30 mg phenylephrine had a Cmax that was 85% of the 10 mg IR dose and an AUCinf that was 61% more than two 10 mg IR doses (20 mg). The ER-IR Blend containing 20 mg phenylephrine and 1300 mg acetaminophen had a Cmax that was 80% of the 10 mg phenylephrine IR dose and an AUCinf that was 22% more than two 10 mg IR doses (20 mg). The results demonstrate that the formulation of the present invention provides efficacy over an extended period of time. These results also demonstrate that the formulation of the present invention is able to match the duration of extended release acetaminophen. The results also demonstrate that phenylephrine exposure is increased and phenylephrine ΡΚ profile is improved relative to a 10 mg immediate release dose of phenylephrine when phenylephrine is combined with acetaminophen. This may be due to competition for gut wall metabolism leading to greater absorption of phenylephrine and no effect on acetaminophen; and extended release formulation providing greater absorption of phenylephrine due to avoidance of gut wall metabolism in lower GI tract. C. Pharmacodynamic Study A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted to determine the efficacy of phenylephrine and phenylephrine-acetaminophen extended release formulations in subjects with congestion and pain symptoms due to upper respiratory tract infections. A 30 mg ER dose, a 45 mg ER dose and a 30 mg ER dose co-administered with 1300 mg acetaminophen were assessed and compared to placebo. In each example, the coated ER phenylephrine resinate particles of the invention were employed. The 30 mg ER dose, the 45 mg ER dose and the 30 mg ER dose co-administered with 1300 mg acetaminophen each performed well against placebo in severity score for (1) stuffy/congested nose; (2) sinus pressure/tendemess; and (3) head congestion from 0 to 12 hours on Day 1. The foregoing examples are not intended to limit the scope of the present invention, which may be set out in the claims. In particular, various equivalents and substitutions will be recognized by those skilled in the art in view of the foregoing disclosure and these are contemplated to be within the scope of the invention.
