TECHNICAL FIELD The invention relates to methods and compositions for dissolution of biofilms that inhibit immune responses and make bacteria resistant to antibiotics. More specifically, it concerns monoclonal antibodies that are derived from human cells or from transgenic animals expressing human antibody genes or that are humanized forms of antibodies native to other species wherein the affinity for the proteins that are responsible for the structural integrity of such biofilms exceeds the affinity of these proteins for biofilm components. Monoclonal antibodies in general and other homogeneous binding moieties with this property are also included. BACKGROUND ART It is well understood in the art that bacterial infections may lead to formation of biofilms that protect the bacteria from the immune system and lead them to enter a quiescent, slow growth state that makes them resistant to most antibiotics (Donlan, R. M., et al., Clin. Microbiol. Rev. (2002) 15:167-193). The result is persistent, recurrent infections that are very difficult to eliminate. These biofilms include as a major component branched extracellular DNA molecules, whose key role was established by showing that DNAse treatment reduced biofilms (Whitchurch, C. B., et al., Science (2002) 295:1487; Petersen, F. C., et al., J. Bacteriol. (2004) 186:6327). The higher order meshwork structure of the DNA molecules is achieved by specific proteins generally designated DNABII proteins, with homologs found in most bacterial species, including proteins designated as IHF (integration host factor) and HU (histone like protein) (Swinger, K. K., et al., Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. (2004) 14:28-35; Goodman, S. D., et al., Mucosal Immunity (2011) 4:625-637). The substantial homology of these proteins facilitates the cooperative formation of biofilms, a feature that further renders the bacteria problematic from a treatment perspective. Members of this class are known to be present in the extracellular environment (Winters, B. D., et al., Infect. Immun. (1993) 61:3259-3264; Lunsford, R. D., et al., Curr. Microbiol. (1996) 32:95-100; Kim, N., et al., J. Bacteriol. (2002) 184:6155-6162) and are known to force or stabilize bends in DNA, a key feature underlying higher order structure in other contexts (Teter, B., et al., Plasmid (2000) 43:73-84). Mutation of the ihfA gene in E. coli reduced or eliminated biofilm in vitro (Garcia-Contreras, R. (2008) PLoS ONE 3(6): e2394). The present invention is based on the concept that supplying a binding moiety with sufficiently high affinity for this class of proteins will extract the proteins from the biofilm and thereby provide an effective method of destroying the biofilm by destroying the ability of the protein to bind and hold together the branched DNA. A supplied binding moiety against the DNABII protein may also destroy its ability to bind to other components present in the biofilm. The binding moieties, of which monoclonal antibodies or fragments thereof are an important embodiment, can be supplied directly to biofilms or used to coat surfaces to provide an immuno-adsorbent for confining the DNABII protein(s). Applications include treatments of bacterial infections by systemic administration, subcutaneous, topical or inhaled administration, as well as reduction of biofouling that affects pipelines and other industrial equipment. Application to corresponding biofilm associated diseases of animals is also part of the present invention. PCT publication WO2011/123396 provides an extensive discussion of such biofilms and suggests their removal by administering to a subject polypeptides that represent the DNABII protein itself, thus causing the organism to generate antibodies that can destroy the integrity of the biofilm. This document also suggests, in the alternative, supplying the antibodies themselves, either ex vivo to biofilms that exist outside an organism or to a subject to confer passive protection. Antibodies to other biofilm associated proteins have similarly been used to interfere with biofilms (Sun, D., et al., Clin. Diagn. Lab. Immunol. (2005) 12:93-100; Shahrooei, M., et al., Infect. Immun. (2009) 77:3670-3678; Novotny, L. A., et al., Vaccine (2009) 28:279-289). The WO2011/123396 PCT application describes the use of polyclonal antibodies generated against a particular DNABII protein (E. coli integration host factor (IHF)) to treat an animal model of the common ear infection (otitis media) and an animal model for periodontal disease. It also describes generating active immunity by providing the protein, or peptides representing the protein to a subject. There is no disclosure of any monoclonal antibodies that are directed to this protein. There is thus no certainty that a single monoclonal antibody can achieve the functionality of the disclosed polyclonal serum. For example, in the case of mAbs to the unrelated biofilm associated AAP protein from Staphylococcus epidermidis, no single mAb was able to reduce biofilm by more than 66% whereas a mAb mixture reduced it by 87% (Sun, D., et al., Clin. Diagn. Lab. Immunol. (2005) 12:93-100). Nor is there any disclosure of monoclonal binding moieties that show cross-species activity against homologs of the IHF protein. Achieving both high affinity and cross-species activity represents a significant obstacle to discovery of an effective drug. The present invention overcomes these obstacles and provides improved agents for passive immunity. The epitopes for two such monoclonal antibodies have been identified and are disclosed herein. The non-identical but overlapping epitopes identify a region of the protein that is discontinuous with regard to the linear sequence of the IHF protein, and thereby identifies favorable conformational features for an immunogen to generate an immune response with efficacy for interfering with a biofilm. DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION The invention provides homogeneous compositions of binding moieties, such as aptamers, protein mimics of antibodies or monoclonal antibodies or fragments thereof, that are particularly effective in binding the DNABII protein and thus effective in dissolving biofilms. Thus, the invention in one aspect is directed to a binding moiety such as a monoclonal antibody (mAb) that has affinity for at least one DNABII protein that exceeds the affinity of branched DNA, a component of biofilms, for said protein. Some affinities for non-sequence-specific DNA binding by these proteins are disclosed in Aeling, K. A., et al., J. Biol. Chem. (2006) 281:39236-39248 and Swinger, K. K., et al., J. mol. Biol. (2007) 365:1005-1016. One class of binding moieties—especially mAb—is that wherein binding to the conformational epitope in the beta hairpin of IHF of S. aureus is of greater affinity than binding to the corresponding linear peptide of SEQ ID NO:88. It is particularly preferred that any antibodies to be used systemically be compatible with mammalian subjects, especially human subjects or feline, canine, porcine, bovine, ovine, caprine or equine subjects when proposed for use in these subjects. Such native mAb's or mAb's modified to more resemble the selected species—i.e., humanized or “species-ized”—have lower risk of binding to other proteins in the body than mAb's from other sources and thus pose lower toxicity risk. Similarly, immunogenicity of mAb's native to or modified to resemble those of a subject is expected to be lower than for other mAb sources thereby facilitating repeated administration. Also preferred is the property of binding with sufficient affinity so as to dissolve or prevent formation of biofilm derived from DNABII proteins originating from at least two different bacterial species. Specific binding moieties illustrated herein contain at least the CDR regions of the heavy chains, and optionally the light chains of the mAb's TRL295, TRL1012, TRL1068, TRL1070, TRL1087, TRL1215, TRL1216, TRL1218, TRL1230, TRL1232, TRL1242, TRL1245, TRL1330, TRL1335, TRL1337, TRL1338, TRL1341, TRL1347 and TRL1361. However, other types of binding moieties, such as aptamers, modifications of antibodies such as camel type single-chain antibodies and the like are also included within the scope of the invention. Examples of antibody mimics include scaffolds based on fibronectin, lipocalin, lens crystallin, tetranectin, ankyrin, Protein A (Ig binding domain). Small peptide families may also have antibody-like affinity and specificity, including avian pancreatic peptides and conotoxins. Peptide nucleic acids, and “stapled” (cross-linked) peptides similarly provide the ability to generate high affinity binding agents with well-defined specificity. The invention is further directed to a method to treat a biofilm associated with an industrial process by using the binding moieties of the invention either to dissolve biofilms or prevent their formation. In this instance, a full variability of binding moieties is suitable, and the species origin of mAb's is not of concern. These binding moieties may also be applied topically on a subject to dissolve biofilms characteristic of a condition in said subject or to prevent their formation. The binding moieties may also be administered systematically for treatment of biofilms. Thus, the invention further includes pharmaceutical or veterinary compositions which comprise the binding moiety described above in an amount effective to treat or prophylactically inhibit the formation of biofilm due to infection in animal subjects. In still other aspects, the invention is directed to recombinant materials and methods to prepare binding moieties of the invention that are proteins, and to improved recombinant methods to prepare DNABII proteins. In still another aspect, the invention relates to preparation of decoy nucleic acids or nucleic acid mimics such as peptide nucleic acids that bind the DNABII proteins with high affinity, but which lack the capacity to form biofilms by virtue of their short oligonucleotide or corresponding peptide nucleic acid status. The invention is also directed to compositions or coatings comprising these decoys. In other aspects, the invention is directed to novel expression systems for DNABII proteins to be used as immunogens and to methods to use these DNABII proteins to identify an agent that reverses drug resistance in multiple species of bacteria. The latter methods comprise evaluating agents for binding activity to the DNABII proteins produced by multiple microbial species. The invention also relates to specific isolated peptides that span predicted immunogenic epitope regions of the IHFα chain of the E. coli DNABII and to more specific peptides and peptidomimetics that mimic the discontinuous epitope defined jointly by studies using TRL1068 and TRL1330, as well as to methods for generating antibodies to IHF proteins by using these peptides as immunogens. These peptides are also useful as templates for the design of the decoys mentioned above. In still another aspect, the invention is directed to a method to treat human or animal diseases for which biofilm causes drug resistance. Treatments include vaccination with immunogens that mimic the discontinuous conformational region defined jointly by the epitopes for TRL1068 and TRL1330, as well as treating subjects with the resulting sera (or concentrated antigen binding polyclonal antibodies from such sera), or with specific monoclonal antibodies developed from the B cells of such immunized animals. Examples of medical indications include: heart valve endocarditis (for which surgical valve replacement is required in the substantial fraction of cases that cannot be cured by high dose antibiotics due to the resistance associated with biofilm), chronic non-healing wounds (including venous ulcers and diabetic foot ulcers), ear and sinus infections, urinary tract infections, pulmonary infections (including subjects with cystic fibrosis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), catheter associated infections (including renal dialysis subjects), subjects with implanted prostheses (including hip and knee replacements), and periodontal disease. This method is effective in mammalian subjects in general, and thus is also applicable to household pets, including periodontal disease in dogs which is difficult to treat due to biofilm (Kortegaard, H. E., et al., J. Small Anim. Pract. (2008) 49:610-616). Similarly, the invention has utility for treating farm animals, including dairy cattle with mastitis due to bacterial infections (Poliana de Castro Melo, et al., Brazilian J. Microbiology (2013) 44:119-124). For the veterinary indications in particular, hyperimmunization of donor animals provides a cost effective route to large amounts of serum suitable for use in localized delivery to other members of the same animal species, e.g., to the gums for periodontal disease or to the udders for mastitis. Extraction of antigen binding antibodies from serum provides a more concentrated source of antibodies for this purpose. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIG. 1A shows the result of a computational analysis of sites on IHF to identify sites that are likely to be particularly susceptible to antibody attack (scores above 0.9). Residues 10-25, 56-78 and 86-96 of Haemophilus influenzae (Hi) IHF are thereby identified as promising targets. FIG. 1B shows these likely antigenic sites mapped onto the crystal structure of the E. coli IHF protein (based on the Protein Data Bank (pdb) structure designated 1OWF). FIG. 2 shows the location of the predicted epitopes of the invention in IHF proteins of various bacterial species. FIG. 3A shows a three-dimensional model of IHF proteins in their native dimeric form as complexed with DNA. FIG. 3B shows the predicted highly antigenic regions (the darkened regions shown (which are red in the color version). The epitopes 2 and 3 identified in FIG. 1 are partially shielded from exposure to the immune system by DNA which is abundant in the biofilm. FIG. 4A-4C show ELISA results for various mAbs with respect to overlapping peptides derived from IHF, identifying multiple regions susceptible to high affinity antibody recognition. FIG. 5 shows that the key residues within epitope 2 required for binding, as determined by alanine substitution at each residue, reside on an anti-parallel beta sheet conformationally restricted region of the protein. FIG. 6A shows Staphylococcus aureus (Sa) biofilm treated for 12 hours with a no antibody control (growth control) or with TRL1068 at 1.2 μg/mL (˜10 nM), a native human mAb against a conserved epitope on DNABII proteins. TRL1068 caused dissolution of the biofilm, as evident at both low (500×) and high (2500×) magnification (scanning electron microscope images). FIG. 6B shows the parallel experiment on Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) biofilm. The growth control with no antibody present showed no impact on the biofilm. FIGS. 7A and 7B show the results of ELISA assays to determine affinity of TRL1068 and TRL1330 for biofilm forming proteins derived from different bacterial strains. FIGS. 8A-8C show the results of ELISA assays to determine affinity of TRL1068 as a function of pH for binding to IHF from Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa respectively. As shown, the binding activity is consistent in the range of pH 5.5-pH 7.5 but drops off as the pH is lowered to 4.5 or 2.5. FIG. 9 shows the reduction in biofilm following treatment with TRL1068 in a murine model for established infection on a plastic implant. MODES OF CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION The invention includes various binding moieties of a monoclonal or homogeneous nature that can dissolve biofilms. “Monoclonal” means that the binding moieties can form a homogeneous population analogous to the distinction between monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies. In one important embodiment, the exemplified binding moieties are mAb's or fragments thereof. In most embodiments, the binding moieties have affinity for at least one DNABII protein in the low nanomolar range—i.e., the Kd is in the range of 10 nM-100 nM including the intervening values, such as 25 nM or 50 nM, but may also be <10 nM or less than 100 pM or less than 40 pM as preferred embodiments. These affinities should be, in some embodiments, characteristic of the interaction with the biofilm-forming proteins derived from a multiplicity of bacterial species, at least two, three, four or more separate species. In some embodiments, particularly high affinities represented by values less than 100 pM or less than 40 pM are exhibited across at least three species, and in particular wherein these species are Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. However, assurance of binding across multiple species can also be achieved by exhibiting a high affinity with respect to an epitope that is highly conserved across multiple species. As described below, the epitope for both TRL1068 and TRL1330 has been mapped to within residues 72-84 of Staphylococcus aureus, which is in the most highly conserved part of the protein (FIG. 2). For use in treatment of bacterial infection in humans, the binding moieties of the invention should have at least three characteristics in order to be maximally successful: the binding moiety should be compatible with the treated species—e.g., in the case of monoclonal antibodies for treating humans, either human or humanized. The binding moiety must have an affinity for the biofilm-forming DNABII protein that exceeds the affinity of that protein for other components of the biofilm that includes this DNABII protein, and it must be crossreactive across the DNABII homologs from multiple bacterial species, minimally two or three such species including both Gram positive and Gram negative species, but preferably a greater number, such as four, five or six or more. Similar characteristics are relevant for use of the binding moieties of the invention for treatment of conditions in other species. In this case, the antibodies are compatible with the species in question. Thus, the antibodies may be derived from feline, canine, equine, bovine, caprine, ovine or porcine species or may be adapted from antibodies of other animals. Analogous to “humanized,” these antibodies could be called “species-ized” so that the relevant species is adequately addressed. Alternatively, a functionally homogeneous polyclonal antibody preparation can be prepared by antigen extraction of antibodies from serum of subjects immunized with peptides that mimic the discontinuous epitope defined by human mAbs TRL1068 and TRL1330. As the illustrative antibodies disclosed herein in the examples below contain variable regions that are derived from humans, and constant regions which are cloned independently of said variable regions but are also derived from humans, these antibodies offer particular advantages for repeated use in humans. When the subject to be administered the mAb is non-human, it is advantageous for repeated use to administer native mAb's similarly derived from that species. Alternatively, an equivalent of the human variable regions, optionally fused to an Fc region from the host species to be treated, may be used. This variable region may be, in some embodiments, an Fab portion or a single-chain antibody containing CDR regions from both the heavy and light chains or heavy chain only. Bispecific forms of these variable regions equivalents can also be constructed, with numerous constructs described in the literature. Although the typical “mAb” will be a protein or polypeptide (“proteins,” “polypeptide” and “peptide” are used interchangeably herein without regard to length) for use in subjects, the mAb's may also be supplied via delivery of nucleic acids that then generate the proteins by in situ translation in cells of the subject. In addition, nucleic acid molecules that mimic the binding characteristics of these polypeptides or proteins can be constructed—i.e., aptamers can be constructed to bind molecules that are identified as described below by their ability to mimic the binding moieties. Successful mimicry of these aptamers for the protein-based binding moieties can verified both biochemically and functionally to confirm that the affinity of the aptamer is sufficient for therapeutic efficacy. In light of the well-defined conformationally constrained region that includes the epitopes for TRL1068 and TRL1330, preparation of such aptamers is straightforward using well established methods. With respect to protein-based monoclonal binding moieties, in addition to typical monoclonal antibodies or fragments thereof that are immunologically specific for the same antigen, various forms of other scaffolding, including single-chain antibody forms such as those derived from camel, llama or shark could be used as well as antibody mimics based on other scaffolds such as fibronectin, lipocalin, lens crystallin, tetranectin, ankyrin, Protein A (Ig binding domain), or the like. Short structured peptides may also be used if they provide sufficient affinity and specificity, e.g., peptides based on inherently stable structures such as conotoxins or avian pancreatic peptides, or peptidomimetics that achieve stable structures by crosslinking and/or use of non-natural amino acids (Josephson, K., et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. (2005) 127:11727-11725). In general, “monoclonal antibody (mAb)” includes all of the foregoing. As for aptamers, generation of such molecules is straightforward using well established methods. As used herein, the term “antibody” includes immunoreactive fragments of traditional antibodies even if, on occasion, “fragments” are mentioned redundantly. The antibodies, thus, include Fab, F(ab′)2, Fv fragments, single-chain antibodies which contain substantially only variable regions, bispecific antibodies and their various fragmented forms that still retain immunospecificity and proteins in general that mimic the activity of “natural” antibodies by comprising amino acid sequences or modified amino acid sequences (i.e., pseudopeptides) that approximate the activity of variable regions of more traditional naturally occurring antibodies. In particular, in the case of embodiments which are monoclonal antibodies, fully human antibodies which are, however, distinct from those actually found in nature, are typically prepared recombinantly by constructing nucleic acids that encode a generic form of the constant region of heavy and/or light chain and further encode heterologous variable regions that are representative of human antibodies. Other forms of such modified mAb's include single-chain antibodies such that the variable regions of heavy and light chain are directly bound without some or all of the constant regions. Also included are bispecific antibodies which contain a heavy and light chain pair derived from one antibody source and a heavy and light chain pair derived from a different antibody source. Similarly, since light chains are interchangeable without destroying specificity, antibodies composed of a heavy chain variable region that determines the specificity of the antibody combined with a heterologous light chain variable region are included within the scope of the invention. Chimeric antibodies with constant and variable regions derived, for example, from different species are also included. For the variable regions of mAb's, as is well known, the critical amino acid sequences are the CDR sequences arranged on a framework which framework can vary without necessarily affecting specificity or decreasing affinity to an unacceptable level. Definition of these CDR regions is accomplished by art-known methods. Specifically, the most commonly used method for identifying the relevant CDR regions is that of Kabat as disclosed in Wu, T. T., et al., J. Exp. Med. (1970) 132:211-250 and in the book Kabat, E. A., et al. (1983) Sequence of Proteins of Immunological Interest, Bethesda National Institute of Health, 323 pages. Another similar and commonly employed method is that of Chothia, published in Chothia, C., et al., J. Mol. Biol. (1987) 196:901-917 and in Chothia, C., et al., Nature (1989) 342:877-883. An additional modification has been suggested by Abhinandan, K. R., et al., Mol. Immunol. (2008) 45:3832-3839. The present invention includes the CDR regions as defined by any of these systems or other recognized systems known in the art. The specificities of the binding of the mAb's of the invention are defined, as noted, by the CDR regions mostly those of the heavy chain, but complemented by those of the light chain as well (the light chains being somewhat interchangeable). Therefore, the mAb's of the invention may contain the three CDR regions of a heavy chain and optionally the three CDR's of a light chain that matches it. The invention also includes binding agents that bind to the same epitopes as those that actually contain these CDR regions. Thus, for example, also included are aptamers that have the same binding specificity—i.e., bind to the same epitopes as do the mAb's that actually contain the CDR regions. Because binding affinity is also determined by the manner in which the CDR's are arranged on a framework, the mAb's of the invention may contain complete variable regions of the heavy chain containing the three relevant CDR's as well as, optionally, the complete light chain variable region comprising the three CDR's associated with the light chain complementing the heavy chain in question. This is true with respect to the mAb's that are immunospecific for a single epitope as well as for bispecific antibodies or binding moieties that are able to bind two separate epitopes, for example, divergent DNABII proteins from two bacterial species. The mAb's of the invention may be produced recombinantly using known techniques. Thus, with regard to the novel antibodies described herein, the invention also relates to nucleic acid molecules comprising nucleotide sequence encoding them, as well as vectors or expression systems that comprise these nucleotide sequences, cells containing expression systems or vectors for expression of these nucleotide sequences and methods to produce the binding moieties by culturing these cells and recovering the binding moieties produced. Any type of cell typically used in recombinant methods can be employed including prokaryotes, yeast, mammalian cells, insect cells and plant cells. Also included are human cells (e.g., muscle cells or lymphocytes) transformed with a recombinant molecule that encodes the novel antibodies. Typically, expression systems for the proteinaceous binding moieties of the invention include a nucleic acid encoding said protein coupled to control sequences for expression. In many embodiments, the control sequences are heterologous to the nucleic acid encoding the protein. Bispecific binding moieties may be formed by covalently linking two different binding moieties with different specificities. For example, the CDR regions of the heavy and optionally light chain derived from one monospecific mAb may be coupled through any suitable linking means to peptides comprising the CDR regions of the heavy chain sequence and optionally light chain of a second mAb. If the linkage is through an amino acid sequence, the bispecific binding moieties can be produced recombinantly and the nucleic acid encoding the entire bispecific entity expressed recombinantly. As was the case for the binding moieties with a single specificity, the invention also includes the possibility of binding moieties that bind to one or both of the same epitopes as the bispecific antibody or binding entity/binding moiety that actually contains the CDR regions. The invention further includes bispecific constructs which comprise the complete heavy and light chain sequences or the complete heavy chain sequence and at least the CDR's of the light chains or the CDR's of the heavy chains and the complete sequence of the light chains. The invention is also directed to nucleic acids encoding the bispecific moieties and to recombinant methods for their production, as described above. Multiple technologies now exist for making a single antibody-like molecule that incorporates antigen specificity domains from two separate antibodies (bi-specific antibody). Thus, a single antibody with very broad strain reactivity can be constructed using the Fab domains of individual antibodies with broad reactivity to diverse homologs. Suitable technologies have been described by MacroGenics (Rockville, Md.), Micromet (Bethesda, Md.) and Merrimac (Cambridge, Mass.). (See, e.g., Orcutt, K. D., et al., Protein Eng. Des. Sel. (2010) 23:221-228; Fitzgerald, J., et al., MAbs. (2011) 1:3; Baeuerle, P. A., et al., Cancer Res. (2009) 69:4941-4944.) The invention is also directed to pharmaceutical and veterinary compositions which comprise as active ingredients the binding moieties of the invention. The compositions contain suitable physiologically compatible excipients such as buffers and other simple excipients. The compositions may include additional active ingredients as well, in particular antibiotics. It is often useful to combine the binding moiety of the invention with an antibiotic appropriate to a condition to be addressed since the efficacy of most antibiotics is greater against the planktonic state of the bacteria than against the sessile, biofilm embedded state. Additional active ingredients may also include immunostimulants and/or antipyrogenics and analgesics. The binding moieties of the invention may also be used in diagnosis by administering them to a subject and observing any complexation with any biofilm present in the subject. In this embodiment the binding moieties are typically labeled with an observable label, such as a fluorescent or chemiluminescent compound in a manner analogous to labeling with bacteria that produce luciferase for non-invasive detection as described in Chang, H. M., et al., J. Vis. Exp. (2011) 10.3791/2547. The assay may also be performed on tissues obtained from the subject. The presence of a biofilm is detected in this manner if it is present, and the progress of treatment may also be monitored by measuring the complexation over time. The identity of the infectious agent may also be established by employing binding moieties that are specific for a particular strain or species of infectious agent. For diagnostic purposes, it is particularly favorable to target epitopes that are not sterically occluded when the protein is complexed with DNA. For example the epitope of TRL1361 has been determined to lie outside the contact sites with DNA. Antibodies such as this provide the opportunity to construct sandwich immunoassays, wherein one antibody is used to capture the antigen and a second antibody that binds at a different site is used to detect the captured antigen. Such assays provide high specificity and are common in the field of diagnostics, with particular utility in a multiplexed assay to reduce the effect of antibody cross-reactivity to other antigens. The invention also includes a method for identifying suitable immunogens for use to generate antibodies by assessing the binding of the binding moieties of the invention, such as mAb's described above, to a candidate peptide or other molecule. This is an effective method, not only to identify suitable immunogens, but also to identify compounds that can be used as a basis for designing aptamers that mimic the binding moieties of the invention. The method is grounded in the fact that if a vaccine immunogen cannot bind to an optimally effective mAb, it is unlikely to be able to induce such antibodies. Conversely, an immunogen that is a faithful inverse of the optimal mAb provides a useful template for constructing a mimic of the optimal mAb. In its simplest form, this method employs a binding moiety such as one of the mAb's of the invention as an assay component and tests the ability of the binding moiety to bind to a candidate immunogen in a library of said candidates. The invention further includes identification of the discontinuous conformationally restricted region defined by the overlap of the epitopes for TRL1068 and TRL1330 as a particularly favorable starting point for such immunogen optimization. Thus, the binding moieties of the invention may be used in high throughput assays to identify from combinatorial libraries of compounds or peptides or other substances those substances that bind with high affinity to the binding moieties of the invention. General techniques for screening combinatorial or other libraries are well known. It may be advantageous to establish affinity criteria by which effective candidate immunogens or other binding partners of the binding moieties of the invention can be selected. The binding moiety, then, can become a template for the design of an aptamer that will bind an epitope of the DNABII protein, preferably across a number of species, but which behaves as a decoy by containing too few nucleotides to act as a structural component in a biofilm. Thus, the resulting aptamers are composed of only 25 or less oligonucleotides, preferably 10-20 nucleotides which are sufficient to effect binding, but not sufficient to behave as structural components for biofilms. A corresponding number of individual monomers would be characteristic of nucleic acid mimics, such as peptide nucleic acids as well. In one particular example, the immunogen discussed above could be a peptide that represents an epitope to which the binding moiety is tightly bound. The binding moiety may be an mAb and the peptide represent an epitope, and this is particularly favorable if the binding moiety or mAb is crossreactive with regard to the DNABII protein across a number of species. The epitope then represents a template which can form the basis for forming aptamers—i.e., short species of DNA or suitable DNA analogs such as peptide nucleic acids which can then behave as decoys to bind the DNABII proteins thus preventing these proteins from forming the biofilms that would result from interaction with longer forms of DNA. Such chemically sturdy mimics could be used, for example, to coat pipes in industrial settings thus permitting scavenging of DNABII proteins to prevent biofilm formation. Due to the lower immunogenicity, mAb's are generally preferable as pharmaceuticals, but such aptamer mimics are also potentially useful as pharmaceuticals, again, by virtue of their behavior as decoys to prevent binding of DNABII proteins to longer forms of DNA for formation of biofilms. In addition, the ability of the binding moieties of the invention to overcome drug resistance in a variety of bacteria can be assessed by testing the binding moieties of the invention against a panel or library of DNABII proteins from a multiplicity of microbial species. Binding moieties that are able to bind effectively a multiplicity of such proteins are thus identified as suitable not only for dissolving biofilms in general, but also as effective against a variety of microbial strains. It is also useful to identify binding moieties that have utility in acidic environments wherein the affinity of a candidate binding moiety for a DNABII protein over a range of pH conditions is tested and moieties with a low nanomolar affinity at pH 4.5 are identified as having utility in acidic environments. The binding moieties of the invention are also verified to have an affinity with respect to at least one DNABII protein greater than the affinity of a biofilm component for the DNABII protein which comprises comparing the affinity of the binding moiety for the DNABII protein versus the affinity of a component of the biofilm, typically branched DNA, for the DNABII protein. This can be done in a competitive assay, or the affinities can be determined independently. The DNABII proteins used in these assays may be prepared in mammalian cells at relatively high yield, thereby overcoming difficulties in expressing these proteins in bacteria. All of the assays above involve assessing binding of two prospective binding partners in a variety of formats. A multitude of assay types are available for assessing successful binding of two prospective binding partners. For example, one of the binding partners can be bound to a solid support and the other labeled with a radioactive substance, fluorescent substance or a colorimetric substance and the binding of the label to the solid support is tested after removing unbound label. The assay can, of course, work either way with the binding moiety attached to the solid support and a candidate immunogen or DNABII protein labeled or vice versa where the candidate is bound to solid support and the binding moiety is labeled. Alternatively, a complex could be detected by chromatographic or electrophoretic means based on molecular weight such as SDS-page. The detectable label in the context of the binding assay can be added at any point. Thus, if, for example, the mAb or other binding moiety is attached to a solid support the candidate immunogen can be added and tested for binding by supplying a labeled component that is specific for the candidate immunogen. Hundreds of assay formats for detecting binding are known in the art, including, in the case where both components are proteins, the yeast two-hybrid assay. In addition to this straightforward application of the utility of the binding moieties of the invention, the identification of a suitable powerful immunogen can be determined in a more sophisticated series of experiments wherein a panel of mAb's against the DNABII protein is obtained and ranked in order by efficacy. A full suite of antibodies or other binding moieties can be prepared against all possible epitopes by assessing whether additional binding moieties compete for binding with the previous panel of members. The epitopes for representative binding mAb's for each member of the complete suite can be accomplished by binding to a peptide array representing the possible overlapping epitopes of the immunogen or by X-ray crystallography, NMR or cryo-electron microscopy. An optimal vaccine antigen would retain the spatial and chemical properties of the optimal epitope defined as that recognized by the most efficacious mAb's as compared to less efficacious mAb's but does not necessarily need to be a linear peptide. It may contain non-natural amino acids or other crosslinking motifs. Moreover, screening can include peptides selected based on their likelihood of being recognized by antibodies and based on their conservation across bacterial species. As described in Example 3 below, for IHF these two criteria have converged on a single peptide—residues 56-78 of H. influenzae and corresponding positions in other analogs. Thus, even beyond the specific mAb's set forth herein, optimal immunogens can be obtained, which not only are useful in active vaccines, but also as targets for selecting aptamers. Specifically, in addition to positions 56-78 of H. influenzae, the peptides at positions 10-25 and 86-96 of H. influenzae are identified. Another aspect of the invention is a method to prepare higher yields of the bacterial/microbial DNABII proteins which are typically somewhat toxic to bacteria. The standard method for preparation of these proteins is described by Nash, H. A., et al., J. Bacteriol (1987) 169:4124-4127 who showed that the IHF of E. coli could be effectively prepared if both chains of said protein (IHF alpha and IHF beta) are produced in the same transformant. Applicants have found that they are able to obtain higher yields, as much as 5-10 mg/l of IHF, by producing homodimers transiently in HEK293 cells. The expression of bacterial proteins that are toxic at high levels in bacteria is conveniently achieved in mammalian cells especially for those without glycosylation sites that would result in modification of the proteins when thus expressed. If tagged with a polyhistidine, purification of the resulting protein can be readily achieved. Applications The binding moieties of the invention including antibodies are useful in therapy and prophylaxis for any subject that is susceptible to infection that results in a biofilm. Thus, various mammals, such as bovine, ovine and other mammalian subjects including horses and household pets and humans will benefit from the prophylactic and therapeutic use of these mAb's. The binding moieties of the invention may be administered in a variety of ways. The peptides based on CDR regions of antibodies, including bispecific and single chain types or alternate scaffold types, may be administered directly as veterinary or pharmaceutical compositions with typical excipients. Liposomal compositions are particularly useful, as are compositions that comprise micelles or other nanoparticles of various types. Aptamers that behave as binding agents similar to mAb's can be administered in the same manner. Further, the binding agent may be conjugated to any of the solid supports known in the literature, such as PEG, agarose or a dextran, to function as an immuno-sorbent for extracting IHF from a biofilm. Alternatively, the peptide-based mAb's may be administered as the encoding nucleic acids either as naked RNA or DNA or as vector or as expression constructs. The vectors may be non-replicating viral vectors such as adeno associated virus vectors (AAV) or the encoding nucleic acid sequence may be chemically or physically delivered into cells (Suskovitch, T. J. and Alter, G., Expert Rev Vaccines (2015) 14(2):205-219). Use of nucleic acids as drugs as opposed to their protein counterparts is helpful in controlling production costs. These are administered in a variety of protocols, including intravenous, subcutaneous, intramuscular, topical (particularly for chronic non-healing wounds and periodontal disease), inhaled and oral or by suppository. Similar routes of administration can be used with regard to the binding moieties themselves. One useful way to administer the nucleic acid-based forms of either the binding moieties themselves (aptamers) or those encoding the protein form of binding moieties is through a needleless approach such as the agro-jet needle-free injector described in US2001/0171260. The peptides that include the epitopes of the high affinity, cross-species binding human mAb's against IHF proteins as described herein are also useful as active components of vaccines to stimulate immunogenic responses which will generate antibodies in situ for disruption of biofilms. The types of administration of these immunogens or peptidyl mimetics that are similarly effective are similar to those for the administration of binding moieties, including various types of antibodies, etc. The peptidomimetics may themselves be in the form of aptamers or alternative structures that mimic the immunogenic peptides described herein. For those immunogens, however, that are proteins or peptides, the administration may be in the form of encoding nucleic acids in such form as will produce these proteins in situ. The formulation, routes of administration, and dosages are determined conventionally by the skilled artisan. As shown in the examples below, two antibodies of the invention, TRL1068 and TRL1330 have particularly favorable affinity and specificity characteristics for the IHF protein. Therefore, immunogens that bind these specific antibodies will be particularly powerful in generating effective antisera. By analyzing overlapping peptides and alanine replacements, it has been found that the epitopes for both of these highly binding antibodies are conformational epitopes located on an anti-parallel beta sheet connected by a loop (a “beta hairpin”). These are shown in FIG. 5. Since these structures are known, it is well within the skill of the art to construct peptidyl mimetics which preserve the conformation of the sequence, for example by crosslinking to lock in the conformation, and render it more effective than simply the linear peptide representing the epitope itself and to substitute, for example, non-natural amino acids or other than peptide bonds to render the immunogen more stable and resistant to hydrolysis. It is also possible to design alternative non-peptide mimics including peptide nucleic acids that have essentially the same shape and binding characteristics as the now identified immunogen. As set forth in Example 4 below, as the conformational epitopes to which TRL1068 and TRL1330 bind are in the form of a beta hairpin, methods are available in the art to provide peptidomimetics that are useful as immunogens. Such methods are disclosed in (Jimenez, M. A., Methods Mol. Biol. (2014) 1216:15-52), including design of artificial crosslinkers to stabilize the structure (Celentano, V., et al., Chem. Commun (Camb.) (2012) 48:762-764). Mimetics of this type of structure have been generated that mimic the binding of HIV Tat protein to RNA with low nM affinity (Athanassiou, Z., et al., Biochemistry (2007) 46:741-751), and a beta hairpin mimic has been described that binds to VEGF receptor-2 with low nM affinity (Patel, S., et al., Protein Eng. Des. Sel. (2013) 26:307-315). Construction of mimics is also described in Schmidt, J., et al., Bioorganic. Med. Chem. (2013) 21:5806-5810 and in Lesniak, W. G., et al., Mol. Pharm. (2015) 12:941-953. Briefly, small libraries of crosslinked or cyclic compounds based on the structure of the beta hairpin can be constructed and evaluated for structure/activity relationships by means of competition assays wherein the stabilized beta hairpin structure that includes the epitopes is used to compete with candidate peptidomimetics binding to the relevant antibody, e.g., TRL1068. Those candidates that successfully compete with the native epitope are selected as suitable immunogens. The types of conditions for which the administration either of the vaccine type for active generation of antibodies for biofilm control or for passive treatment by administering the antibodies, per se, include any condition that is characterized by or associated with the formation of biofilms. These conditions include: heart valve endocarditis, both native and implanted (for which a substantial fraction of cases cannot be cured by high dose antibiotics due to the resistance associated with biofilm), chronic non-healing wounds (including venous ulcers and diabetic foot ulcers), ear and sinus infections, urinary tract infections, pulmonary infections (including subjects with cystic fibrosis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), catheter associated infections (including renal dialysis subjects), subjects with implanted prostheses (including hip and knee replacements), and periodontal disease. One particular condition for which biofilms have been implicated is Lyme disease. It has been shown that the relevant bacteria can form a biofilm in vitro and this is thought to be a substantive contributor to the prolonged course of the disease and resistance to antibiotics. The incidence is more than 30,000 cases per year in the U.S. An alignment of the HU (single gene) from Borrelia burgdorferi which is the causative bacteria shows high similarity to other IHF/HU genes in the putative epitope. Thus, the treatment of Lyme disease specifically as an indication is a part of the invention. The isolation of B. burgdorferi genes encoding HU was described by Tilly, K., et al., Microbiol. (1996) 142:2471-2479 and characterization of the biofilm formed by these organisms in vitro was described by Sapi, E., et al., PLoS 1 (2013) 7:e1848277. For use in diagnosis, the binding moieties can be used to detect biofilms in vivo by administering them to a subject or in vitro using tissue obtained from the subject. Detection of complexation demonstrates the presence of biofilm. Detection is facilitated by conjugating the binding moiety to a label, such as a fluorescent, chemiluminescent or radioactive label, or in the case of in vitro testing, with an enzyme label. Many such fluorescent, chemiluminescent, radioactive and enzyme labels are well known in the art. Treatment course can also be monitored by measuring the disappearance of biofilm over time. The diagnostic approach enabled by the invention is much less complex than current methods for, for example, endocarditis, where the current diagnostic is trans-esophageal echocardiogram. In addition, the detection/quantitation method can be used in evaluating the effectiveness of compounds in dissolving or inhibiting the formation of biofilms in laboratory settings. Conjugates of the binding moieties of the invention with detectable labels are generally useful in detection and/or quantitation of biofilms in a variety of contexts. A particularly useful antibody for imaging is an antibody that binds to an epitope on the DNABII protein that does not interact with DNA since the binding will not require competition with DNA for association with the biofilm. As shown in Example 4 below, TRL1361 is such an antibody and is particularly useful in the detection methods set forth in the previous paragraph. In addition, since it is now clear that antibodies are available that bind different epitope sites, sandwich assays become available wherein, for example, TRL1068 or TRL1330 is used as either the capture or labeling antibody and TRL1361 is used as the opposite member—for example, wherein TRL1361 is used as a capture antibody and TRL1068 is provided with a label. As noted above, the binding moieties of the invention are not limited in their utility to therapeutic (or diagnostic) uses, but can be employed in any context where a biofilm is a problem, such as pipelines or other industrial settings. The mode of application of these binding moieties to the biofilms in these situations, again, is conventional. For example, surfaces associated with an industrial or other setting can be coated with the binding moieties of the invention including the decoys described above. This effects absorption of the DNABII protein and prevents formation of biofilms. The binding moieties of the invention may also be applied to the biofilms directly to effect dissolution. The following examples are offered to illustrate but not to limit the invention. Example 1 Preparation of Antibodies Human peripheral antibody producing memory B cells were obtained from recovered sepsis patients or from anonymized blood bank donors, under informed consent. The cells were subjected to the CellSpot™ assay to determine their ability to bind the DNABII protein derived from one or more bacterial species. The CellSpot™ assay is described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,413,868 and 7,939,344. After isolating the B cells from whole blood, they were stimulated with cytokines and mitogens to initiate a brief period of proliferation and antibody secretion (lasting ˜10 days) and plated for subjection to the assays; the encoding nucleic acids for the variable regions were extracted and used to produce the antibodies recombinantly following fusion of the variable region encoding DNA to DNA cloned independently that codes for the constant region of the antibody. Antibodies selected based on binding to at least one of the DNABII proteins or fragments thereof were characterized: TRL295, TRL1012, TRL1068, TRL1070, TRL1087, TRL1215, TRL1216, TRL1218, TRL1230, TRL1232, TRL1242, TRL1245, TRL1330, TRL1335, TRL1337, TRL1338, TRL1341, TRL1347 and TRL1361. Affinity can be measured using the FortéBio™ Octet™ biosensor to measure on and off rates (whose ratio yields the Kd). Since this assay underestimates affinity for tight binding antibodies, a better estimate of affinity was obtained by titration in an ELISA format (see Example 6 below). This result establishes the feasibility of a focused screen to isolate high affinity, cross-strain binding antibodies. Recovery of such antibodies from human blood is unexpected. As described in PCT WO2011/123396 (FIG. 13), IHF complexed to DNA is poorly immunogenic as compared to IHF not complexed to DNA. This has been confirmed experimentally since IHF in the absence of DNA is more successful in raising antibodies than administration of the complex. The natural state of the protein is in the form of a complex with DNA; that is, the protein is a limiting factor for biofilm formation since addition of exogenous protein increases the amount of biofilm formed (Devaraj, A., et al., Mol. Microbiol. (2015 Mar. 11) doi: 10.1111/mmi.12994. Epub ahead of print). Thus, the more immunogenic sites are normally masked by DNA. Despite these facts, several of the mAbs described here that were cloned from human blood bind to sites that are presumed to be in contact with DNA. No immunization with isolated IHF or peptides thereof (as taught by WO2011/123396) was required to stimulate the production of such antibodies.

Example 2 Determination of Affinity For practice of the assay method, ˜1 mg of IHF was required. IHF is difficult to express in bacteria (since it has a dual function involving gene regulation, leading to toxicity to bacteria expressing high levels). Obtaining sufficient material for mAb discovery from bacterial sources is thus difficult (and expensive). The protein was therefore expressed in HEK293 (mammalian) cells, with a poly-histidine tag to enable easy purification. The homologs from Staphylococcus aureus (Sa), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa), Klebsiella pneumoniae (Kp), Acinetobacter baumannii (Ab) and Haemophilus influenzae (Hi) were all prepared in this manner. These five are of particular utility since they span a substantial portion of the diversity in sequences of the DNABII family. TRL295 was shown to bind with high affinity to the IHF peptide of H. influenzae and moreover to bind to IHF from additional bacterial species. The chart below shows the degree of identity to Haemophilus of various IHF and HU proteins from a variety of bacterial species. Sequence Identity to Species Abbrev.

The chart below shows the results of ELISA assays to determine binding of various mAb's to various DNABII proteins. The numbers represent OD values which are useful for comparison to TRL1068—higher values represent higher binding affinity. TRL1068 shows similar binding to all four homologs, but low binding to BSA, as does TRL1215.

Int'l. (2013) 48-51). The values were: 1 nM for Staphylococcus aureus (Sa), 1 nM for Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa), 7 nM for Klebsiella pneumoniae (Kp) and 350 nM for Haemophilus influenzae (Hi). Example 3 Epitope Selection for Focused mAb Discovery Computational methods for analyzing the likelihood of antigenicity (induction of antibody responses) are known in the art (reviewed by J. Ponomarenko, et al., in BMC Bioinformatics (2008) 9:514). Using an improved variation of these published methods, a map of the likely epitopes was generated for the IHF from Haemophilus influenzae from a homology model of the structure based on the published E. coli IHF structure found in the Protein Data Bank (pdb 1OWF) (FIG. 1B). For the display in FIG. 1A, a value was assigned to the residue at the midpoint of each 11-amino acid segment. A value above 0.9 denotes a region with high likelihood of being susceptible to antibody binding. Three regions were identified as having high likelihood of being recognized by antibodies: positions 10-25 of H. influenzae IHF: IEYLSDKYHLSKQDTK (SEQ ID NO:79); positions 56-78 of H. influenzae IHF: RDKSSRPGRNPKTGDVVAASARR (SEQ ID NO:80); and positions 86-96 of H. influenzae IHF: QKLRARVEKTK (SEQ ID NO:81). See FIG. 2 for alignment of these sequences across homologs from diverse species. As illustrated in FIG. 2, the central region of the IHF protein is substantially conserved across multiple clinically important bacterial species. Structural modeling of IHF from multiple species has confirmed that the homology is high, particularly in the DNA binding region (Swinger, K. K., et al., Current Opinion in Structural Biology (2004) 14:28-35). Peptides that only partially overlap with this optimal region are less likely to fold spontaneously into the relevant three dimensional conformation and will be more difficult to chemically crosslink in order to lock in that conformation. Optimizing the fidelity to the native protein in this manner is advantageous for both mAb discovery and for use of the peptide as an immunogen. FIG. 3A shows a computational construction of the IHF dimer complexed with DNA. The predicted B cell epitopes of the invention are shown in FIG. 3B. FIG. 3A shows that the epitopes are partially masked by DNA when bound. However, if exposed, these portions of the proteins may generate antibodies of high affinity capable of binding them and thus preventing the formation of biofilm or causing an established biofilm to lose structural integrity as the DNABII protein is sequestered by the antibody. Other sites on the DNABII protein not involved in binding DNA may also suffice to achieve extraction of the protein out of the biofilm based on higher affinity binding by the mAb as compared to the protein's affinity for components of the biofilm. Example 4 Epitope Mapping A set of 26 overlapping 15-mer peptides (offset by 3 residues) from the IHF of Staphylococcus aureus was synthesized, each with a biotin at the N-terminus (followed by a short linker comprising SGSG). Peptides were dissolved in DMSO (15-20 mg/mL), diluted 1:1000 in PBS and bound to streptavidin coated plates in duplicate. TRL1068 and TRL1337 bound to peptides 19, SGSG AARKGRNPQTGKEID (SEQ ID NO:82) and 20, SGSG KGRNPQTGKEIDIPA (SEQ ID NO:83) strongly, and weakly to peptide 18. TRL1330 bound strongly only to peptide 19. The epitope is thereby identified as within KGRNPQTGKEIDI (SEQ ID NO:84). TRL1338 binds strongly only to peptide 26, SGSGVPAFKAGKALKDAVK (SEQ ID NO:85), and TRL1335 to none of the 26 peptides. However, TRL1335 binds to the IHF protein from Pa and Sa as does TRL1338; TRL1337 binds very strongly to IHF protein from Sa. These results are shown in FIGS. 4A-4C. It is evident from these results that TRL1335 binds to a conformational epitope. TRL1361 binds at a very different site, with strong binding to peptides 12 and 13 in the set, i.e., SGSG SLAKGEKVQLIGFGN (SEQ ID NO:86) and SGSG KGEKVQLIGFGNFEV (SEQ ID NO:87). The epitope represented by SEQ ID NO:82 and SEQ ID NO:83 was then mapped more precisely using 12-mer peptides offset by one residue across the region defined by peptides 19 and 20 of the 3-residue offset set. Further, alanine scanning was conducted across this region, substituting alanine for the native amino acid at each residue in turn. As shown in FIG. 5, the epitope for both TRL1068 AARKGRNPQTGEKEIDIPA (SEQ ID NO:88) and TRL1330 AARKGRNPQTGEKEIDIPA (SEQ ID NO:88) comprises discontinuous residues (underlined) in the linear sequence, which form a conformational epitope that is a beta-hairpin (anti-parallel beta sheet) structure. This structure has been extensively studied and peptidomimetics for such structures have been prepared. Such beta-hairpin structures can be synthesized chemically in high yields and can be cyclized to improve proteolytic stability. The definition of the epitopes for TRL1068 and TRL1330 at high resolution thereby enables design of peptidomimetics suitable for use as immunogens and as competing binding agents. These mAbs further provide a useful way to measure likely utility of variants of the beta hairpin structure. Only those variants that retain high affinity binding to at least one of these reference mAbs are likely to be able to induce an immune response that provides the biofilm interfering activity of the reference mAbs. Example 5 In Vitro Bioactivity Assessment TRL1068 was tested for bioactivity using a commercial assay from Innovotech (Edmonton, Alberta; Canada). Biofilms were formed in multiple replicates on pins in a 96-well microplate format exposed to media including Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853) or Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 29213). Following biofilm formation, the pins were treated in different wells with a no antibody control or with TRL1068 at 1.2 μg/mL (˜10 nM) for 12 hours. As evident in the scanning electron micrographs of the treated surfaces in FIGS. 6A and 6B, TRL1068 was highly effective at dissolving the biofilm. These results establish that the mAb can degrade the biofilm, thereby removing the attached bacteria. Example 6 Improved Affinity Determination The ELISA assays of Example 2 were modified and conducted as follows: Plates were coated with 1 ug/ml of antigen in PBS overnight at 4° C.Washed 4 times in PBS/0.05% Tween® 20.Blocked in 3% BSA/PBS and stored until ready to use.Washed 4 times in PBS/0.05% Tween® 20.Incubated for 1 hr with serial dilutions of anti-IHF mAb in blocking buffer.Washed 4 times in PBS/0.05% Tween® 20.Incubated for 1 hr in 1 ug/ml of HRP-conjugated goat anti human IgG Fc in blocking buffer.Washed 4 times in PBS/0.05% Tween® 20.Developed in TMB peroxidase substrate and color stopped with stop solution with affinity estimated as the half-maximal binding concentration. The results are shown in FIGS. 7A-7B and are as follows: TRL1068 TRL1330 Antigen Affinity (pM) Affinity (pM) P. aeruginosa 11 13 S. aureus 15 23 K. pneumoniae 11 14 H. influenzae 5,000 26 Acinetobacter baumannii 10 17 Although TRL1337 bound the same peptides used for epitope mapping in Example 4 as did TRL1068 and TRL1330, among the five full-length IHF proteins tested, it bound only that of S. aureus. This result is further evidence for some conformational character to the epitopes. Example 7 pH Dependence The high affinity binding of TRL295 and TRL1068 was shown to be retained even as the pH was decreased from physiological (pH 7.5) to pH 4.5, as shown below. FIGS. 8A-8C show the results for TRL1068 assessed against three different IHF homologs. In other studies, no significant change in binding was seen at higher pH up to 8.5. TRL295 TRL1068 Affinity (nM) pH Kd (nM) Sa Kp Pa 7.5 4.2 0.010 0.006 0.005 6.5 2.8 0.012 0.006 0.005 5.5 2.8 0.012 0.009 0.006 4.5 3.7 0.012 0.050 0.009 3.5 no binding 0.36 3.0 0.26 2.5 no binding 3.5 2.6 2.1 This is important since the local micro-environment of infected tissues is often at lower pH than in healthy tissues. Example 8 In Vivo Bioactivity Assessments Several animal models exist for evaluation of activity. For example, at University Hospital Basel (Switzerland), a model for biofilm on implanted prostheses involves implanting Teflon® tissue cages (Angst+Pfister; Zurich, Switzerland) subcutaneously in BALB/c mice. Sterile perforated cylindrical Teflon® tissue cages, 8.5×1×30 mm, 1.9 mL volume (Angst+Pfister AG, Zurich, Switzerland), were implanted subcutaneously into anesthetized mice. Upon complete wound healing (two weeks), the mice were anesthetized and the cages tested for sterility by plating percutaneously aspirated tissue cage fluid (TCF) on Columbia sheep blood agar plates. To simulate a perioperative infection, 700 colony-forming units (CFU) of MRSA (ATCC 43300) were injected into each cage (day 0). After 24 hours, the interior of the cage becomes coated with a biofilm. Treatment groups (given i.p. once starting after the biofilm was formed): saline control, antibiotic alone (daptomycin, 50 mg/kg), or antibiotic in combination with TRL1068 (15 mg/kg). On days 2 and 3, the fluid within the tissue cage (TCF) was aspirated and plated to determine CFU of planktonic bacteria. At the end of the experiment, the animals were sacrificed and the implanted cage recovered. Following sonication to release the adherent bacteria, the level of infection was again assessed as CFU per cage. As expected, the bacteria in the cage were only partially reduced by daptomycin alone. By contrast, TRL1068 in combination with daptomycin significantly reduced the bacteria inside the cages on day 2 (P<0.01). Additionally, TRL1068 in combination with daptomycin significantly reduced adherent bacteria inside the cage (P<0.02). See FIG. 9. Since daptomycin concentration decreases substantially over 24 hours, a second experiment was conducted in which TRL1068 and daptomycin were administered by i.p. injection daily for 3 days. Similar efficacy at day 2 was observed, measuring the planktonic bacteria in the cage fluid. At sacrifice, the remaining adherent bacteria level was again measured. A 2 log reduction was observed for the TRL1068 treated animals, an improvement over the 1 log reduction seen with only 1 dose of daptomycin. This result is consistent with continuous erosion of the biofilm, releasing bacteria that can be killed by daptomycin more effectively than when they are embedded in the biofilm. A second example is a model that involves inducing biofilm on heart valves, mimicking native valve endocarditis (Tattevin, P., et al., Antimicrob Agents Chemother (2013) 57:1157). New Zealand white rabbits are anesthetized. The right carotid artery is cut and a polyethylene catheter is positioned across the aortic valve and secured in place. Twenty four hours later, 1 mL of saline plus 8×107 CFU of S. aureus is injected through the catheter, which induces a biofilm infection in 95% of the animals. Drugs (anti-biofilm and antibiotic) are administered i.v. and efficacy is evaluated after 4 days by tissue pathology and blood bacterial levels. A third example is a rat model for valve endocarditis that involves use of luminescent bacteria, which express luciferase thereby enabling detection non-invasively by sensitive light detectors such as the IVIS® system sold by Perkin Elmer (Que, Y. A., et al., J. Exp. Med. (2005) 201:1627). Using a bioluminescent S. aureus strain (Xen29), infection of the heart valve is established within a few days. The effect of drugs can thereby be monitored over time by recording the intensity of light which decreases as the biofilm is disrupted.
