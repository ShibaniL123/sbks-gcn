WATER SOLUBLE SALTS OF HARRINGTONINE AND THEIR PHARMACEUTICAL APPLICATIONS The present invention concerns solid state salts of harringtonine, definite by their analysis patterns, their process of preparation allowing their use as drug substance for blending alone or in combination in pharmaceutical composition particularly useful for treatment of cancers, leukemias and lymphoma including in using subcutaneous or oral routes of administration In October 2012, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted accelerated approval to omacetaxine mepesuccinate (= omacetaxine homoharringtonine = HHT = HO) for the treatment of adult patients with chronic phase or accelerated phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) with resistance and/or intolerance to two or more tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) [H. Kantarjian et al Homoharringtonine/ Omacetaxine Mepesuccinate: The Long and Winding Road to Food and Drug Administration Approval, Clinical Lymphoma, Myeloma & Leukemia, Vol. 13(5) 530 (2013)]. In 2013, 14 major articles and reviews related to HHT were published in literature. This occurred after a very long and tumultuous period of clinical development (almost 40 years), including early clinical development of HHT and, to a lesser extent, its congeners harringtonine (HA) and deoxyharringtonine (DHA) in China, then at the United States National Cancer Institute. In 1998, the discovering of a new semi-synthetic process by one of us, allowing industrial production of homoharringtonine at the kilo scale. The historical comparative study of harringtonine and its natural counterpart, homoharringtonine shows that the activities and toxicity in animals and humans are strictly equivalent to the point that a number of clinical trials made in China used indistinctly both similar, or even sometime as a mixture. The development literature of the late Matthew Suffness has identified several dozen clinical trials carried out in China involving harringtonine alone or in combination [M. Suffness et al, Cephalotaxine esters: antileukemic advance or therapeutic failure?, J Natl Cancer Inst. 1095 (1988)] The historical reasons for the clinical development homoharringtonine instead of harringtonine are very simple. At the time when these substances were extracted from nature, indeed to the detriment of biodiversity, homoharringtonine was more abundant and easier to purify by chromatography that harringtonine. The invention of a process for the industrial synthesis of semi Homoharringtonine by one of us (JPR) came in 1998 reinforced this phenomenon and trigger a revival of clinical development of HHT in Western countries [JP Robin et al, The first semi-synthesis of enantiopure homoharringtonine via anhydrohomoharringtonine from a preformed chiral acyl moiety, Tetrahedron Letters, 2931 (1999)]. The recent editorial of Kanrarjian et al. perfectly summarizes current status of HHT /http://www. ascopost.com/issues/april-15,- 2013/ homoharringtonine omacetaxine-the-little-drug-that-could.aspx]. However, despite all these progresses, several drawbacks remain: (i) The cost of treatment for omacetaxine (Synribo) is prohibitive: $28,000 for induction, $14,000 for monthly treatments), this give about 180.000 $ per year, per patient [H. Kantarjian et al., Cancer Drugs in the United States: Justum Pretium— The Just Price, Journal of Clinical Oncology, 2013, p3600; H. Kantarjian, personal communication. "The price of drugs for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a reflection of the unsustainable prices of cancer drugs: from the perspective of a large group of CML experts" blood 2013 p4439] (ii) The use of parenteral route of administration exclusively in inpatient while the competitors products are administered orally on an outpatient basis, considerably retards its development. (iii) There is some local intolerance to this product when administered subcutaneously [Chronic myeloid leukemia: overview of new agents and comparative analysis., H. Kantarjian et al, Curr Treat Options Oncol. 2013 Jun;14(2):127 (2013)] (iv) On the other hand, although it has been known for almost 40 years, there is still a slight doubt regarding the absolute configuration of this series of natural product [see Steitz above] Definition see scheme 1A CEPHALOTAXINE ESTERS HARRINGTONINES HARRINGTON INE CATION i.e. acetates, itaconates... = "HARRINGTON INIUM" ION Cephalotaxanes are particular alkaloid to date only extracted exclusively the Cephalotaxaceae family which exhibiting the structural formula 1_. Several substituants may be encountered on this core structure: hydroxyl, ether, acyloxy side chain... The eventual presence of some additional double bound or intramolecular bridge achieve to definite cephalotaxanes. Cephalotaxines 2 are cephalotaxanes without acyloxy side-chain. Cephalotaxine 2 and drupacine are example of cephalotaxines. Harringtonines 5 (sometime called cephalotaxine esters) are particular cephalotaxanes formed by attachment of a branched a-hydroxyacyloxy side- chain at the 3-position of various cephalotaxines moieties (including drupacine). Another definition of harringtonines may be mixte 1 -O-cephalotaxyl 4-O-methyl esters of 2-alkyl malic acid. Cephalotaxines 2 and harringtonines 5, are examples of cephalotaxanes. Several dozen of cephalotaxanes have been isolated from various Cephalotaxus species. 4 is the generic formula of cephalotaxine esters. Harringtonines 5 (i. e. harringtonine = HA and homoharringtonine = HHT) are particular cephalotaxine esters, alkaloid isolated from rare and endangered conifers belonging to the Cephalotaxus genus. Cephalotaxine and its natural ester are gathered under the generic term of cephalotaxane. Harringtoids are semi-synthetic derivatives of harringtonines. Harringtonic acids are the free version of side-chain of harringtonines *ln cancer area, for definition of term see [Suffness et al in Journal of Natural Products 1982 p 1 Current Status of the NCI Plant and Animal Product Program] CYTOTOXICITY is toxicity to tumor cells in culture; ANTITUMOR is in vivo activity in experimental systems; ANTINEOPLASTIC or ANTICANCER are the reserved terms for reported clinical trials data. (1 ) The first cephatotaxine ester isolated from cephalotaxus harringtonia (2) "Homo" means one more carbone than harringtonine; Named omacetaxine (DCI = USAN) as active pharmaceutical ingredient. (3) "nor" means one more less carbon Two harringtonines are very promising drugs in the treatment of certain leukemia such as Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML). Both homoharringtonine and harringtonine are used in human chemotherapy of leukemia for 30 years. harringtonine itself has been the subject of many studies in vitro, in vivo and clinical: -In myeloid leukemia [M. Suffness et al, Cephalotaxine esters: antileukemic advance or therapeutic failure?, J Natl Cancer Inst. 1095 (1988,); Kantarjian et a\]Effectiveness of Homoharringtonine(Omacetaxine Mepesuccinate) for Treatmentof Acute Myeloid Leukemia: A Meta-Analysis of Chinese Studies; Clinical Lymphoma Myeloma and Leukemia Some mixture of acid and alkaloid have been in situ prepared and administrated but, surprisingly, never salts including crystalline have been isolated and described in literature. The natural purification of HA and HO has caused significant damage to the environment. In 1999, the first hemi-synthesis of HHT was reported. This synthesis involves the direct esterification of cephalotaxine extracted from leaves of Cephalotaxus, not from the bark. Only one 70th of the amount of Cephalotaxus is required compared with its natural counterpart, and this semisynthetic HA is also purer (99.7%). The following editorial perfectly summarizes the status of this drug: http://www.ascoDost.com/issues/april -15.- 2013/homoharringtonine. Omacetaxine-the-little-drug-that-could.aspx Recent scientific discovering regarding mechanism of activity of harringtonines The team of Steitz [Steitz et al, U2504 determines the species specificity of the A-site cleft antibiotics: the structures of tiamulin, homoharringtonine, and bruceantin bound to the ribosome, J Mol Biol. 389(1 ), 146 (2009)] recently demonstrated that homoharringtonine when in place on its active site was protonated in a neutral media, implying that protonation is imperative condition for the manifestation of the activity of this anticancer agent. In addition, the team of Takano et al [J. Org. Chem. p 8251 (1997)] demonstrated experimentally that when the nitrogen lone pair of homoharringtonine was occupied by an oxygen atom, the cytotoxic activity was divided by a factor of at least 50. The authors concluded that "the nitrogen lone pair on the cephalotaxine skeleton appears to be essential for its activity". The above mentioned team of Steitz showed that the absolute configuration of homoharringtonine deposited in the Cambridge Structural Database seems to be the opposite of that commonly adopted in the literature. In brief, the fact that the real active form of harringtonines would be their nitrogen-protonated version was recently supported by the work of Seitz et al. and, indirectly by the work of Takano et al. The present invention relates to overcome the problems mentioned above regarding harringtonine. It also demonstrated that the absolute configuration in the deposited homoharringtonine Cambridge Structural Database seems to be the opposite of that commonly retained in the literature. SCHEME 2: ANION MOIETIES OF SOME SALT S CITED IN THIS INVENTION h drogen (2S)-malate hydrogen (2R)-malate hydrogen (2S)-tartrate hydrogen (2R)-tartrate h hydrogen succinate hydrogen tartronate dihydrogen citrate The example of single crystal X-ray diffraction of harringtonine hydrogen (2S)-malate exhibited in figure 7a clearly indicates that the alkaloid moeity was efficiently protonated by the processes described in the present invention (proton numbered Hn9 on ORTEP diagram on figure 7a). The same finding was made on homoharringtonines salts in a previous invention. An example of diagram of (2S)-malate of homoharringtonine is represented in Figure 7d (proton H9). Moreover as shown in Figures 7a and 7d, the conformation in the crystalline state are so close together on the one hand, and so close to the configuration of homoharringtonine in its active site on the other hand (see above cited reference of Seitz), that we can expect the same activity for both molecules. In addition, the shortest distance between said proton carried by the nitrogen is close to two angstroms, showing the reality of the formation of a salt and not a mere co-crystal (for detail see figure 7b) Final determination of absolute configuration of harringtonine, homo-harringtonine and cephalotaxine: based upon the well known absolute configuration of 2S-malate and the relative configuration of the salt seen on figure 7a and 7d the absolute configuration of harringtonine or homoharringtonine and cephalotaxine are 3S,4S,5R,2'R and 3S,4S,5R respectively. This confirm definitely the predictive observation of Seitz et al (see above reference) based on biological observation of omacetaxine in its ribosome site at the crystalin state. The purpose of this invention is to overcome the above mentioned difficulties by the following actions: -generate a hydrosoluble form of the molecule of harringtonine exhibiting a protonated nitrogen and which can be formulated as is it. -provide the medical community with a cheaper drug, easier to use including orally, with an improved local tolerance when administrated subcutaneously and exhibiting a good long-term stability -assess the new chemical entities object of this invention by means of preclinical study conducted adequately. -incidentally definitively confirm the absolute configuration of the harringtonine itself from one of its chiral organic salts -improve purification of harringtonine prepared from natural source In brief: The present invention concerns novel water soluble solid salts of harringtonine and their use as new chemical entities for the formulation of new cancer chemotherapeutic agents, or immunosuppressive or antiparasitic and to implement new processes for purification including enantiomeric and determine the absolute configuration of the series.

Example 1 : General procedure for experimental methods 1.1 General procedures for salts preparation General procedure 1A: Alkaloid base and acid components are dissolved separately in equimolecular concentration in a solvent at a concentration close of saturation and at a temperature close of boiling then both solutions are mixed under stirring then slowly cooled and evaporated. After a period ranging from a few minutes up to several days, crystal salt is collected. A sample of the batch of crystals is kept suspended in its mother liquors for the subsequent X-ray diffraction analysis. The remainder of the batch was dried under vacuum for further solid characterisation, comparative stability studies and drug formulation. General procedure 1 B: Alkaloid base and acid components are intimately mixed by grinding in a mortar. A small amount (0.01 mmol) of the reaction mixture is loaded into an aluminium capsule and placed under nirogen atmosphere, in the furnace of a differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) apparatus for thermodynamic studies. Condition were reproduced at 0.1 mmol. Scales. Crystals were collected, then analyzed in the solid state or dissolved in minimum of a suitable solvent for recrystallization. General procedure 1 C: Alkaloid base and acid components are intimately mixed by grinding in a mortar in the presence of a suitable solvent. The mixture is abandoned for several days. 1.2 General procedures for solid state characterization Single crystal X-Ray diffractions material and methods Kappa CCD, Nonius diffractometer, M o - Ka radiation (λ = 0.71073 °A).The structure was solved by direct methods using the SHELXS-97 program [Sheldrick G.M., Acta Cryst. A64 (2008), 1 12-122], and then refined with full- matrix least-square methods based on F 2 (SHELXL-2013) [Sheldrick G.M., (2013)] with the aid of the WINGX [L. J. Farrugia, J. Appl. Cryst., 2012, 45, 849- 854] program. All non-hydrogen atoms were refined with anisotropic atomic displacement parameters. Except nitrogen and oxygen linked hydrogen atoms that were introduced in the structural model through Fourier difference maps analysis, H atoms were finally included in their calculated positions. Collected information: atomic positions; unit cell composition; crystal packing anisotropic displacement parameters; bond lengths, dihedral and torsion angles, hydrogen bounding. Original files with all parameters are includes on a CD and may be visualized and handled in using ORTEP-3 software (ORTEP = Oak Ridge Thermal-Ellipsoid Plot Program) available free of charge on the Internet: http://www.chem.gla.ac.uk/~louis/software/ortep3/ X-Ray Diffraction Powder Diagrams were measured on a Bruker AXS D8 Advance diffractometer, Bragg-Brentano geometry (θ-2 Θ), CuK a = 1 .5406 A, 600 ms / pixel, rotation: 0.25 / sec. For each chart, the calculated patern from the single crystal structure, when available, is upped mentioned. Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) The DSC analysis was performed using a Perkin Elmer DSC 4000 apparatus. The scan rate was 5 ° C / min and the scanning range of temperature was 40 to 230 ° C. The accurately weighed quantity was ranged from 1 to 3 mg. All operations were performed under nitrogen atmosphere. The measured values were the Onset, the Peak and the value of the free enthalpy variation. The eventual product decomposition and the vaporization of solvent crystallization (methanol and / or water) were recorded. The value of the change in free energy, was given only as a guideline to assess the endothermicity or exotermicity of the transition. Melting Point Checking Melting points were measured manually for visual checking of the one determined with DSC. A Bucchi B-545 melting point apparatus was used and mp are uncorrected. Infrared Spectra All vibrational spectra were recorded on a Perkin Elmer IR FT Spectrum 2 apparatus equipped with diamond ATR accessory that is to say using Attenuated Total Reflection technique. The crystalline solids were crushed directly by in situ compression on the diamond window and the amorphous state has been demonstrated by dissolving the product in deuterated methanol then generating the film by in situ evaporation on the diamond window. 1.3 General procedures for liquid state and solution characterizations Nuclear Magnetic Resonance NMR spectra were recorded automatically on a Bruker Avance III spectrometer NanoBay - 400MHz (9.4 Tesla magnet) with a BBFO + probe and sampler 120 positions, allows for automatic mode NMR experiments one and two dimensions mainly for nuclei: 1 H, 2H, 1 B, 13C, 15N, 19F, 27AI, 31 P, 1 19Sn or on Bruker Avance III - 600MHz spectrometer. Dissolving salts for 13C NMR: 30 mg of compound were dissolved in 600 μΐ_ (5% m/V) of methanol D4 or deuterium oxyde (or both if specified) Water suppression: The irradiation technique known as "watergate" (Selective pulse flanked by gradient pulses) was used for proton NMR in the presence of D2O and/or MOD4 as solvents. Most of 13C spectra were recorded according to Attached Proton Test mode (APT: includes quaternary carbons) or DEPT135: Distortionless Enhancement by Polarization Transfer (non-quaternary carbons only). High Performance Liquid Chromatography Routine experiments were performed on a Waters HPLC-MS-DAD coupled system (3100 pump, DAD 996 detector, 3100 mass detector).
