Preparation of Comparative PAG Compounds
Example 24. Preparation of Comparative PAG, CPAG-1
This procedure was adopted from JPA2002236358. A 100 mL flask was charged with (diacetoxyiodo)benzene (Sigma-Aldrich) (3.22 g, 10.0 mmol, 1.0 eq.) and CH3CN (25 mL) under nitrogen stream and the mixture was stirred for 5 minutes at room temperature. The CH3CN (25 mL) solution of trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (3.00 g, 20.0 mmol, 2.0 eq.) and H2O (0.36 g, 20.0 mmol, 2.0 eq.) was added dropwise to the mixture over 5 minutes and the mixture was stirred for 10 minutes at room temperature. Acetophenone (1.20 g, 10.0 mmol, 1.0 eq.) was added to the mixture and the mixture was stirred for 2.5 hours at room temperature and the CH3CN was removed in an evaporator. The residue was extracted with hexane (50 mL) twice and hexane layers were combined. The hexane was then removed in an evaporator. The crude product was purified by recrystallization (hexane, 35° C. to 0° C.) to obtain the target compound as white solid (0.113 g) in 4.2% yield.
