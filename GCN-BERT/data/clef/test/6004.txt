This application claims priority to U.S. Patent Application No. 14/269,435, filed on May 5, 2014, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. STATEMENT IN SUPPORT FOR FILING A SEQUENCE LISTING [0002] A paper copy of the Sequence Listing and a computer readable form of the Sequence Listing containing the file named "32559-1 l_ST25.txt", which is 32,670 bytes in size (as measured in MICROSOFT WINDOWS® EXPLORER), are provided herein and are herein incorporated by reference. This Sequence Listing consists of SEQ ID NOs: 1-6. BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE [0003] The present disclosure relates generally to natural sweeteners. More particularly, the present disclosure relates to a non-caloric sweetener and methods for synthesizing the non-caloric sweetener. [0004] Steviol glycosides are natural products isolated from Stevia rebaudiana leaves. Steviol glycosides are widely used as high intensity, low-calorie sweeteners and are significantly sweeter than sucrose. Naturally occurring steviol glycosides share the same basic steviol structure, but differ in the content of carbohydrate residues (e.g., glucose, rhamnose and xylose residues) at the C13 and C19 positions. Steviol glycosides with known structures include, steviol, stevioside, rebaudioside A, rebaudioside B, rebaudioside C, rebaudioside D, rebaudioside E, rebaudioside F and dulcoside A (see e.g., Table 1). Table 1. Steviol glycosides. Name Structure Molecular Molecular Formula Weight [0005] On a dry weight basis, stevioside, rebaudioside A, rebaudioside C, and dulcoside A, account for 9.1, 3.8, 0.6, and 0.3% of the total weight of the steviol glycosides in the leaves, respectively, while the other steviol glucosides are present in much lower amounts. Extracts from the Stevia rebaudiana plant are commercially available, which typically contain stevioside and rebaudioside A as primary compounds. The other steviol glycosides typically are present in the stevia extract as minor components. For example, the amount of rebaudioside A in commercial preparations can vary from about 20% to more than 90% of the total steviol glycoside content, while the amount of rebaudioside B can be about 1-2%, the amount of rebaudioside C can be about 7-15%, and the amount of rebaudioside D can be about 2% of the total steviol glycosides. [0006] Steviol glycosides differ from each other not only by molecular structure, but also by their taste properties. For example, different steviol glycosides have different degrees of sweetness and after-taste. Stevioside, for example, is 100-150 times sweeter than sucrose, but has a bitter after-taste. Rebaudioside A and rebaudioside E, for example, are 250-450 times sweeter than sucrose and have less of an after-taste than stevioside. Rebaudioside C is between 40-60 times sweeter than sucrose. Dulcoside A is about 30 times sweeter than sucrose. [0007] The majority of steviol glycosides are formed by several glycosylation reactions of steviol, which are typically catalyzed by the UDP-glycosyltransferases (UGTs) using uridine 5'-diphosphoglucose (UDP-glucose) as a donor of the sugar moiety. UGTs in plants make up a very diverse group of enzymes that transfer a glucose residue from UDP-glucose to steviol. For example, glycosylation of the C-3 ' of the C-13-O-glucose of stevioside yields rebaudioside A; and glycosylation of the C-2' of the 19-O-glucose of the stevioside yields rebaudioside E. Further glycosylation of rebaudioside A (at C- 19-O- glucose) or rebaudioside E (at C-13-O-glucose) produces rebaudioside D. (FIG. 1). [0008] Alternative sweeteners are receiving increasing attention due to awareness of many diseases in conjunction with the consumption of high-sugar foods and beverages. Although artificial sweeteners are available, many artificial sweeteners such as dulcin, sodium cyclamate and saccharin have been banned or restricted by some countries due to concerns over their safety. Therefore, non-caloric sweeteners of natural origin are becoming increasingly popular. One of the main obstacles for the widespread use of stevia sweeteners are their undesirable taste attributes. Accordingly, there exists a need to develop alternative sweeteners and methods for their production to provide the best combination of sweetness potency and flavor profile. SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE [0009] The present disclosure relates generally to natural sweeteners. More particularly, the present disclosure relates to a non-caloric sweetener and methods for synthesizing the non-caloric sweetener. The present disclosure also relates to a enzyme that can be used to prepare the non-caloric sweetener. [0010] Steviol Glycoside - Synthetic Rebaudioside D2.

[0033] While the disclosure is susceptible to various modifications and alternative forms, specific embodiments thereof have been shown by way of example in the drawings and are herein described below in detail. It should be understood, however, that the description of specific embodiments is not intended to limit the disclosure to cover all modifications, equivalents and alternatives falling within the spirit and scope of the disclosure as defined by the appended claims. DETAILED DESCRIPTION [0034] Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which the disclosure belongs. Although any methods and materials similar to or equivalent to those described herein may be used in the practice or testing of the present disclosure, the preferred materials and methods are described below. [0035] The term "complementary" is used according to its ordinary and customary meaning as understood by a person of ordinary skill in the art, and is used without limitation to describe the relationship between nucleotide bases that are capable to hybridizing to one another. For example, with respect to DNA, adenosine is complementary to thymine and cytosine is complementary to guanine. Accordingly, the subject technology also includes isolated nucleic acid fragments that are complementary to the complete sequences as reported in the accompanying Sequence Listing as well as those substantially similar nucleic acid sequences. [0036] The terms "nucleic acid" and "nucleotide" are used according to their respective ordinary and customary meanings as understood by a person of ordinary skill in the art, and are used without limitation to refer to deoxyribonucleotides or ribonucleotides and polymers thereof in either single- or double-stranded form. Unless specifically limited, the term encompasses nucleic acids containing known analogues of natural nucleotides that have similar binding properties as the reference nucleic acid and are metabolized in a manner similar to naturally-occurring nucleotides. Unless otherwise indicated, a particular nucleic acid sequence also implicitly encompasses conservatively modified or degenerate variants thereof (e.g., degenerate codon substitutions) and complementary sequences, as well as the sequence explicitly indicated. [0037] The term "isolated" is used according to its ordinary and customary meaning as understood by a person of ordinary skill in the art, and when used in the context of an isolated nucleic acid or an isolated polypeptide, is used without limitation to refer to a nucleic acid or polypeptide that, by the hand of man, exists apart from its native environment and is therefore not a product of nature. An isolated nucleic acid or polypeptide can exist in a purified form or can exist in a non-native environment such as, for example, in a transgenic host cell. [0038] The terms "incubating" and "incubation" as used herein refers to a process of mixing two or more chemical or biological entities (such as a chemical compound and an enzyme) and allowing them to interact under conditions favorable for producing a steviol glycoside composition. [0039] The term "degenerate variant" refers to a nucleic acid sequence having a residue sequence that differs from a reference nucleic acid sequence by one or more degenerate codon substitutions. Degenerate codon substitutions can be achieved by generating sequences in which the third position of one or more selected (or all) codons is substituted with mixed base and/or deoxyinosine residues. A nucleic acid sequence and all of its degenerate variants will express the same amino acid or polypeptide. [0040] The terms "polypeptide," "protein," and "peptide" are used according to their respective ordinary and customary meanings as understood by a person of ordinary skill in the art; the three terms are sometimes used interchangeably, and are used without limitation to refer to a polymer of amino acids, or amino acid analogs, regardless of its size or function. Although "protein" is often used in reference to relatively large polypeptides, and "peptide" is often used in reference to small polypeptides, usage of these terms in the art overlaps and varies. The term "polypeptide" as used herein refers to peptides, polypeptides, and proteins, unless otherwise noted. The terms "protein," "polypeptide," and "peptide" are used interchangeably herein when referring to a polynucleotide product. Thus, exemplary polypeptides include polynucleotide products, naturally occurring proteins, homologs, orthologs, paralogs, fragments and other equivalents, variants, and analogs of the foregoing. [0041] The terms "polypeptide fragment" and "fragment," when used in reference to a reference polypeptide, are used according to their ordinary and customary meanings to a person of ordinary skill in the art, and are used without limitation to refer to a polypeptide in which amino acid residues are deleted as compared to the reference polypeptide itself, but where the remaining amino acid sequence is usually identical to the corresponding positions in the reference polypeptide. Such deletions can occur at the amino-terminus or carboxy -terminus of the reference polypeptide, or alternatively both. [0042] The term "functional fragment" of a polypeptide or protein refers to a peptide fragment that is a portion of the full length polypeptide or protein, and has substantially the same biological activity, or carries out substantially the same function as the full length polypeptide or protein (e.g., carrying out the same enzymatic reaction). [0043] The terms "variant polypeptide," "modified amino acid sequence" or "modified polypeptide," which are used interchangeably, refer to an amino acid sequence that is different from the reference polypeptide by one or more amino acids, e.g., by one or more amino acid substitutions, deletions, and/or additions. In an aspect, a variant is a "functional variant" which retains some or all of the ability of the reference polypeptide. [0044] The term "functional variant" further includes conservatively substituted variants. The term "conservatively substituted variant" refers to a peptide having an amino acid sequence that differs from a reference peptide by one or more conservative amino acid substitutions, and maintains some or all of the activity of the reference peptide. A "conservative amino acid substitution" is a substitution of an amino acid residue with a functionally similar residue. Examples of conservative substitutions include the substitution of one non-polar (hydrophobic) residue such as isoleucine, valine, leucine or methionine for another; the substitution of one charged or polar (hydrophilic) residue for another such as between arginine and lysine, between glutamine and asparagine, between threonine and serine; the substitution of one basic residue such as lysine or arginine for another; or the substitution of one acidic residue, such as aspartic acid or glutamic acid for another; or the substitution of one aromatic residue, such as phenylalanine, tyrosine, or tryptophan for another. Such substitutions are expected to have little or no effect on the apparent molecular weight or isoelectric point of the protein or polypeptide. The phrase "conservatively substituted variant" also includes peptides wherein a residue is replaced with a chemically-derivatized residue, provided that the resulting peptide maintains some or all of the activity of the reference peptide as described herein. [0045] The term "variant," in connection with the polypeptides of the subject technology, further includes a functionally active polypeptide having an amino acid sequence at least 75%, at least 76%, at least 77%, at least 78%, at least 79%, at least 80%, at least 81%, at least 82%, at least 83%, at least 84%, at least 85%, at least 86%, at least 87%, at least 88%, at least 89%, at least 90%, at least 91%, at least 92%, at least 93%, at least 94%, at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98%, at least 99%, and even 100% identical to the amino acid sequence of a reference polypeptide. [0046] The term "homologous" in all its grammatical forms and spelling variations refers to the relationship between polynucleotides or polypeptides that possess a "common evolutionary origin," including polynucleotides or polypeptides from superfamilies and homologous polynucleotides or proteins from different species (Reeck et al, Cell 50:667, 1987). Such polynucleotides or polypeptides have sequence homology, as reflected by their sequence similarity, whether in terms of percent identity or the presence of specific amino acids or motifs at conserved positions. For example, two homologous polypeptides can have amino acid sequences that are at least 75%, at least 76%, at least 77%, at least 78%, at least 79%, at least 80%, at least 81%, at least 82%, at least 83%, at least 84%, at least 85%, at least 86%, at least 87%, at least 88%, at least 89%, at least 90%, at least 91%, at least 92%, at least 93%, at least 94%, at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98%, at least 99%, and even 100% identical. [0047] "Percent (%) amino acid sequence identity" with respect to the variant polypeptide sequences of the subject technology refers to the percentage of amino acid residues in a candidate sequence that are identical with the amino acid residues of a reference polypeptide (such as, for example, SEQ ID NO:6), after aligning the sequences and introducing gaps, if necessary, to achieve the maximum percent sequence identity, and not considering any conservative substitutions as part of the sequence identity. [0048] Alignment for purposes of determining percent amino acid sequence identity can be achieved in various ways that are within the skill in the art, for instance, using publicly available computer software such as BLAST, BLAST-2, ALIGN, ALIGN-2 or Megalign (DNASTAR) software. Those skilled in the art can determine appropriate parameters for measuring alignment, including any algorithms needed to achieve maximal alignment over the full-length of the sequences being compared. For example, the % amino acid sequence identity may be determined using the sequence comparison program NCBI-BLAST2. The NCBI-BLAST2 sequence comparison program may be downloaded from ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. NCBI BLAST2 uses several search parameters, wherein all of those search parameters are set to default values including, for example, unmask yes, strand=all, expected occurrences 10, minimum low complexity length=15/5, multi-pass e- value=0.01, constant for multi-pass=25, dropoff for final gapped alignment=25 and scoring matrix=BLOSUM62. In situations where NCBI-BLAST2 is employed for amino acid sequence comparisons, the % amino acid sequence identity of a given amino acid sequence A to, with, or against a given amino acid sequence B (which can alternatively be phrased as a given amino acid sequence A that has or comprises a certain % amino acid sequence identity to, with, or against a given amino acid sequence B) is calculated as follows: 100 times the fraction X/Y where X is the number of amino acid residues scored as identical matches by the sequence alignment program NCBI-BLAST2 in that program's alignment of A and B, and where Y is the total number of amino acid residues in B. It will be appreciated that where the length of amino acid sequence A is not equal to the length of amino acid sequence B, the % amino acid sequence identity of A to B will not equal the % amino acid sequence identity of B to A. [0049] In this sense, techniques for determining amino acid sequence "similarity" are well known in the art. In general, "similarity" refers to the exact amino acid to amino acid comparison of two or more polypeptides at the appropriate place, where amino acids are identical or possess similar chemical and/or physical properties such as charge or hydrophobicity. A so-termed "percent similarity" may then be determined between the compared polypeptide sequences. Techniques for determining nucleic acid and amino acid sequence identity also are well known in the art and include determining the nucleotide sequence of the mRNA for that gene (usually via a cDNA intermediate) and determining the amino acid sequence encoded therein, and comparing this to a second amino acid sequence. In general, "identity" refers to an exact nucleotide to nucleotide or amino acid to amino acid correspondence of two polynucleotides or polypeptide sequences, respectively. Two or more polynucleotide sequences can be compared by determining their "percent identity", as can two or more amino acid sequences. The programs available in the Wisconsin Sequence Analysis Package, Version 8 (available from Genetics Computer Group, Madison, Wis.), for example, the GAP program, are capable of calculating both the identity between two polynucleotides and the identity and similarity between two polypeptide sequences, respectively. Other programs for calculating identity or similarity between sequences are known by those skilled in the art. [0050] An amino acid position "corresponding to" a reference position refers to a position that aligns with a reference sequence, as identified by aligning the amino acid sequences. Such alignments can be done by hand or by using well-known sequence alignment programs such as ClustalW2, Blast 2, etc. [0051] Unless specified otherwise, the percent identity of two polypeptide or polynucleotide sequences refers to the percentage of identical amino acid residues or nucleotides across the entire length of the shorter of the two sequences. [0052] "Coding sequence" is used according to its ordinary and customary meaning as understood by a person of ordinary skill in the art, and is used without limitation to refer to a DNA sequence that encodes for a specific amino acid sequence. [0053] "Suitable regulatory sequences" is used according to its ordinary and customary meaning as understood by a person of ordinary skill in the art, and is used without limitation to refer to nucleotide sequences located upstream (5' non-coding sequences), within, or downstream (3' non-coding sequences) of a coding sequence, and which influence the transcription, RNA processing or stability, or translation of the associated coding sequence. Regulatory sequences may include promoters, translation leader sequences, introns, and polyadenylation recognition sequences. [0054] "Promoter" is used according to its ordinary and customary meaning as understood by a person of ordinary skill in the art, and is used without limitation to refer to a DNA sequence capable of controlling the expression of a coding sequence or functional RNA. In general, a coding sequence is located 3 ' to a promoter sequence. Promoters may be derived in their entirety from a native gene, or be composed of different elements derived from different promoters found in nature, or even comprise synthetic DNA segments. It is understood by those skilled in the art that different promoters may direct the expression of a gene in different cell types, or at different stages of development, or in response to different environmental conditions. Promoters, which cause a gene to be expressed in most cell types at most times, are commonly referred to as "constitutive promoters." It is further recognized that since in most cases the exact boundaries of regulatory sequences have not been completely defined, DNA fragments of different lengths may have identical promoter activity. [0055] The term "operably linked" refers to the association of nucleic acid sequences on a single nucleic acid fragment so that the function of one is affected by the other. For example, a promoter is operably linked with a coding sequence when it is capable of affecting the expression of that coding sequence (i.e., that the coding sequence is under the transcriptional control of the promoter). Coding sequences can be operably linked to regulatory sequences in sense or antisense orientation. [0056] The term "expression" as used herein, is used according to its ordinary and customary meaning as understood by a person of ordinary skill in the art, and is used without limitation to refer to the transcription and stable accumulation of sense (mRNA) or antisense RNA derived from the nucleic acid fragment of the subject technology. "Over- expression" refers to the production of a gene product in transgenic or recombinant organisms that exceeds levels of production in normal or non-transformed organisms. [0057] "Transformation" is used according to its ordinary and customary meaning as understood by a person of ordinary skill in the art, and is used without limitation to refer to the transfer of a polynucleotide into a target cell. The transferred polynucleotide can be incorporated into the genome or chromosomal DNA of a target cell, resulting in genetically stable inheritance, or it can replicate independent of the host chromosomal. Host organisms containing the transformed nucleic acid fragments are referred to as "transgenic" or "recombinant" or "transformed" organisms. [0058] The terms "transformed," "transgenic," and "recombinant," when used herein in connection with host cells, are used according to their ordinary and customary meanings as understood by a person of ordinary skill in the art, and are used without limitation to refer to a cell of a host organism, such as a plant or microbial cell, into which a heterologous nucleic acid molecule has been introduced. The nucleic acid molecule can be stably integrated into the genome of the host cell, or the nucleic acid molecule can be present as an extrachromosomal molecule. Such an extrachromosomal molecule can be auto-replicating. Transformed cells, tissues, or subjects are understood to encompass not only the end product of a transformation process, but also transgenic progeny thereof. [0059] The terms "recombinant," "heterologous," and "exogenous," when used herein in connection with polynucleotides, are used according to their ordinary and customary meanings as understood by a person of ordinary skill in the art, and are used without limitation to refer to a polynucleotide (e.g., a DNA sequence or a gene) that originates from a source foreign to the particular host cell or, if from the same source, is modified from its original form. Thus, a heterologous gene in a host cell includes a gene that is endogenous to the particular host cell but has been modified through, for example, the use of site-directed mutagenesis or other recombinant techniques. The terms also include non-naturally occurring multiple copies of a naturally occurring DNA sequence. Thus, the terms refer to a DNA segment that is foreign or heterologous to the cell, or homologous to the cell but in a position or form within the host cell in which the element is not ordinarily found. [0060] Similarly, the terms "recombinant," "heterologous," and "exogenous," when used herein in connection with a polypeptide or amino acid sequence, means a polypeptide or amino acid sequence that originates from a source foreign to the particular host cell or, if from the same source, is modified from its original form. Thus, recombinant DNA segments can be expressed in a host cell to produce a recombinant polypeptide. [0061] The terms "plasmid," "vector," and "cassette" are used according to their ordinary and customary meanings as understood by a person of ordinary skill in the art, and are used without limitation to refer to an extra chromosomal element often carrying genes which are not part of the central metabolism of the cell, and usually in the form of circular double-stranded DNA molecules. Such elements may be autonomously replicating sequences, genome integrating sequences, phage or nucleotide sequences, linear or circular, of a single- or double-stranded DNA or RNA, derived from any source, in which a number of nucleotide sequences have been joined or recombined into a unique construction which is capable of introducing a promoter fragment and DNA sequence for a selected gene product along with appropriate 3' untranslated sequence into a cell. "Transformation cassette" refers to a specific vector containing a foreign gene and having elements in addition to the foreign gene that facilitate transformation of a particular host cell. "Expression cassette" refers to a specific vector containing a foreign gene and having elements in addition to the foreign gene that allow for enhanced expression of that gene in a foreign host.

[0070] As used herein, the term "off-taste(s)" refers to an amount or degree of taste that is not characteristically or usually found in a beverage product or a consumable product of the present disclosure. For example, an off-taste is an undesirable taste of a sweetened consumable to consumers, such as, a bitter taste, a licorice-like taste, a metallic taste, an aversive taste, an astringent taste, a delayed sweetness onset, a lingering sweet aftertaste, and the like, etc. [0071] As used herein, the term "w/v-%" refers to the weight of a compound, such as a sugar, (in grams) for every 100 ml of a liquid orally consumable product of the present disclosure containing such compound. As used herein, the term "w/w-%" refers to the weight of a compound, such as a sugar, (in grams) for every gram of an orally consumable product of the present disclosure containing such compound.

[0073] In accordance with the present disclosure, a non-caloric sweetener and methods for synthesizing the non-caloric sweetener are disclosed. Also in accordance with the present disclosure an enzyme and methods of using the enzyme to prepare the non- caloric sweetener are disclosed. Synthetic Non-Caloric Sweetener: Synthetic Rebaudioside D2 [0074] In one aspect, the present disclosure is directed to a synthetic non-caloric sweetener. The synthetic non-caloric sweetener is a synthetic rebaudioside-type steviol glycoside and has been given the name, "Rebaudioside D2". As illustrated in the chemical structure (I) below, rebaudioside D2 ("Reb D2") is a steviol glycoside having five glycosidic residues similar to the five glycosidic residues of the steviol glycoside, rebaudioside D. (I) [0075] Rebaudioside D2 has the molecular formula C50H80O28 and the IUPAC name, 13-[(2-0- -D-glucopyranosyl-6-0- -D-glucopyranosyl-6-D-glucopyranosyl)oxy] e«?-kaur-16-en-19-oic acid-(2-0- -D-glucopyranosyl- -D-glucopyranosyl) ester. [0076] As illustrated in the chemical structures for rebaudioside D2, rebaudioside E and rebaudioside D, rebaudioside D2 and rebaudioside D have five β-D-glucosyl units connected to the aglycone steviol in the structure, whereas rebaudioside E contains four D- glycosidic residues (see e.g., Table 1 and FIG. 8). The synthesized rebaudioside D2 includes two glycosidic residues at the C19 position and three glycosidic residues at the C13 position of steviol. In comparison, rebaudioside D also includes five glycosidic residues; two glycosidic residues at the CI 9 position and three glycosidic residues at the C13 position of the aglycone steviol. The fifth glycosidic residue ("sugar V") of rebaudioside D2 is positioned at the C-6' of the C13 O-glucose of Reb E by a 1,6 β glycosidic linkage, whereas the fifth glycosidic residue ("sugar V") of rebaudioside D is positioned at the C-3'of the C13 O-glucose of Reb E by a 1,3 β glycosidic linkage (see, FIG. 8). Rebaudioside E, however, includes two glycosidic residues at the C19 position and two glycosidic residues at the CI 3 position. Without being bound by theory, it is believed that steviol glycosides having 5 glycosidic residues (rebaudioside D) and 4 glycosidic residues (rebaudioside A and rebaudioside E) have significantly better taste quality than steviol glycosides having less glycosidic residues (stevioside and rubusoside). Methods of Producing Rebaudioside D2 [0077] In another aspect, the present disclosure is directed to a method for synthesizing rebaudioside D2 from rebaudioside E. In one embodiment, the method includes preparing a reaction mixture including rebaudioside E; a substrate selected from the group consisting of sucrose, uridine diphosphate (UDP) and uridine diphosphate- glucose (UDP-glucose); and a UDP-glycosyltransferase selected from a uridine diphospho glycosyltransferase and a UDP-glycosyltransferase fusion enzyme (EUS) comprising a uridine- diphospho (UDP) glycosyltransferase domain coupled to a sucrose synthase domain; and incubating the reaction mixture for a sufficient time to produce rebaudioside D2, wherein a glucose is covalently coupled to the rebaudioside E to produce rebaudioside D2. [0078] A particularly suitable a uridine diphospho (UDP) glycosyltransferase can be, for example, EUGT11 (as described in WO 2013022989). EUGT1 1 is a uridine 5'- diphosphate-dependent glycosyl transferase ("UGT") having 1,2-19-O-glucose and 1,2-13- O-glucose glycosylation activity. EUGT1 1 is known to catalyze the production of stevioside to rebaudioside E and rebaudioside A to rebaudioside D. Surprisingly and unexpectedly, however, it has been discovered that uridine diphospho (UDP) glycosyltransferase can be used in vitro to convert rebaudioside E into rebaudioside D2. [0079] A suitable uridine diphospho glycosyltransferase can be, for example, an Oryza sativa uridine diphospho glycosyltransferase EUGT1 1. A particularly suitable uridine diphospho glycosyltransferase has the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: l . [0080] The method can further include adding a sucrose synthase to the reaction mixture that contains the uridine diphospho (UDP) glycosyltransferase. Addition of the sucrose synthase to the reaction mixture that includes a uridine diphospho glycosyltransferase creates a "UGT-SUS coupling system". In the UGT-SUS coupling system, UDP-glucose can be regenerated from UDP and sucrose, which allows for omitting the addition of extra UDP-glucose to the reaction mixture or using UDP in the reaction mixture. [0081] Suitable sucrose synthase domains can be for example, an Arabidopsis sucrose synthase 1 ; an Arabidopsis sucrose synthase 3 and a Vigna radiate sucrose synthase. A particularly suitable sucrose synthase domain can be, for example, Arabidopsis sucrose synthase 1. A particularly suitable Arabidopsis sucrose synthase 1 is Arabidopsis thaliana sucrose synthase 1 (AtSUSl). A particularly suitable sucrose synthase 1 can be, for example, a sucrose synthase 1 having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:3. [0082] In another embodiment, the UDP-glycosyltransferase can be a UDP- glycosyltransferase fusion enzyme (also referred to herein as "EUS") that includes a uridine diphospho glycosyltransferase domain coupled to a sucrose synthase domain. The UDP-glycosyltransferase fusion enzyme is described in more detail below. [0083] In the reaction, the UDP-glycosyltransferase (for example, EUGT1 1 and EUS) has a 1,6-13 O glucose glycosylation activity and, in one embodiment, can transfer a glucose molecule to rebaudioside E to form rebaudioside D2. The UDP- glycosyltransferase (for example, EUGT1 1 and EUS) also has 1,2-19 O-glucose and 1,2- 13-O-glucose glycosylation activity. In another embodiment, the UDP-glycosyltransferase can transfer a glucose molecule to stevioside to form rebaudioside E and can also transfer a glucose molecule to rebaudioside A to form rebaudioside D. Additionally, the EUS fusion enzyme has sucrose synthase activity, and thus, can regenerate UDP-glucose from UDP and sucrose.

[0089] Initially, the UDP glycosyltransferase for use in the method of this embodiment is the same as described above.

In particular, the UDP-glycosyltransferase fusion enzyme includes a uridine diphospho glycosyltransferase domain coupled to a sucrose synthase domain. The EUS fusion enzyme has a 1,2-19 O- glucose glycosylation activity. Surprisingly and unexpectedly, the EUS fusion enzyme also has a 1,6-13 O-glucose glycosylation activity that can transfer a glucose molecule to rebaudioside E to form rebaudioside D2. Additionally, the EUS fusion enzyme has sucrose synthase activity, and thus, can regenerate UDP-glucose from UDP and sucrose. [0095] The UDP-glycosyltransferase fusion enzyme can have a polypeptide sequence with at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 91%, at least 92%, at least 93%, at least 94%, at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98%, at least 99% and even 100% identical to the amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO:5. Suitably, the amino acid sequence of the UDP-glycosyltransferase fusion enzyme has at least 80% identity to SEQ ID No:5. More suitably, the amino acid sequence of the UDP- glycosyltransferase fusion enzyme has at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 91%, at least 92%, at least 93%, at least 94%, at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98%, at least 99%, and even 100% amino acid sequence identity to the amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID O:5. [0096] In another aspect, the present disclosure relates to an isolated nucleic acid having a nucleotide sequence encoding the UDP-glycosyltransferase fusion enzyme described herein. For example, the isolated nucleic acid can include a nucleotide sequence encoding a polypeptide of the UDP-glycosyltransferase fusion enzyme having a nucleic acid sequence that has at least 70%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 91%, at least 92%, at least 93%, at least 94%, at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98%, at least 99%, and even 100% sequence homology to the nucleic acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 6.

Such beverage products may be provided in any suitable form, such as a beverage concentrate and a carbonated, ready-to-drink beverage. [0117] In certain embodiments, beverage products of the present disclosure can have any of numerous different specific formulations or constitutions. The formulation of a beverage product of the present disclosure can vary to a certain extent, depending upon such factors as the product's intended market segment, its desired nutritional characteristics, flavor profile, and the like. For example, in certain embodiments, it can generally be an option to add further ingredients to the formulation of a particular beverage product. For example, additional (i.e., more and/or other) sweeteners can be added, flavorings, electrolytes, vitamins, fruit juices or other fruit products, tastents, masking agents and the like, flavor enhancers, and/or carbonation typically may be added to any such formulations to vary the taste, mouthfeel, nutritional characteristics, etc. In embodiments, the beverage product can be a cola beverage that contains water, about 5 ppm to about 100 ppm rebaudioside D2, an acidulant, and flavoring. Exemplary flavorings can be, for example, cola flavoring, citrus flavoring, and spice flavorings. In some embodiments, carbonation in the form of carbon dioxide can be added for effervescence.

[0119] In another aspect, the present disclosure is directed to a consumable comprising a sweetening amount of rebaudioside D2. The consumable can be, for example, a food product, a nutraceutical, a pharmaceutical, a dietary supplement, a dental hygienic composition, an edible gel composition, a cosmetic product and a tabletop flavoring. [0120] As used herein, "dietary supplement(s)" refers to compounds intended to supplement the diet and provide nutrients, such as vitamins, minerals, fiber, fatty acids, amino acids, etc. that may be missing or may not be consumed in sufficient quantities in a diet. Any suitable dietary supplement known in the art may be used. Examples of suitable dietary supplements can be, for example, nutrients, vitamins, minerals, fiber, fatty acids, herbs, botanicals, amino acids, and metabolites. [0121] As used herein, "nutraceutical(s)" refers to compounds, which includes any food or part of a food that may provide medicinal or health benefits, including the prevention and/or treatment of disease or disorder (e.g., fatigue, insomnia, effects of aging, memory loss, mood disorders, cardiovascular disease and high levels of cholesterol in the blood, diabetes, osteoporosis, inflammation, autoimmune disorders, etc.). Any suitable nutraceutical known in the art may be used. In some embodiments, nutraceuticals can be used as supplements to food and beverages and as pharmaceutical formulations for enteral or parenteral applications which may be solid formulations, such as capsules or tablets, or liquid formulations, such as solutions or suspensions.

[0123] As used herein, a "gel" refers to a colloidal system in which a network of particles spans the volume of a liquid medium. Although gels mainly are composed of liquids, and thus exhibit densities similar to liquids, gels have the structural coherence of solids due to the network of particles that spans the liquid medium. For this reason, gels generally appear to be solid, jelly-like materials. Gels can be used in a number of applications. For example, gels can be used in foods, paints, and adhesives. Gels that can be eaten are referred to as "edible gel compositions." Edible gel compositions typically are eaten as snacks, as desserts, as a part of staple foods, or along with staple foods. Examples of suitable edible gel compositions can be, for example, gel desserts, puddings, jams, jellies, pastes, trifles, aspics, marshmallows, gummy candies, and the like. In some embodiments, edible gel mixes generally are powdered or granular solids to which a fluid may be added to form an edible gel composition. Examples of suitable fluids can be, for example, water, dairy fluids, dairy analogue fluids, juices, alcohol, alcoholic beverages, and combinations thereof. Examples of suitable dairy fluids can be, for example, milk, cultured milk, cream, fluid whey, and mixtures thereof. Examples of suitable dairy analogue fluids can be, for example, soy milk and non-dairy coffee whitener. [0124] As used herein, the term "gelling ingredient" refers to any material that can form a colloidal system within a liquid medium. Examples of suitable gelling ingredients can be, for example, gelatin, alginate, carageenan, gum, pectin, konjac, agar, food acid, rennet, starch, starch derivatives, and combinations thereof. It is well known to those in the art that the amount of gelling ingredient used in an edible gel mix or an edible gel composition can vary considerably depending on a number of factors such as, for example, the particular gelling ingredient used, the particular fluid base used, and the desired properties of the gel. [0125] Gel mixes and gel compositions of the present disclosure can be prepared by any suitable method known in the art. In some embodiments, edible gel mixes and edible gel compositions of the present disclosure can be prepared using other ingredients in addition to rebaudioside D2 and the gelling agent. Examples of other suitable ingredients can be, for example, a food acid, a salt of a food acid, a buffering system, a bulking agent, a sequestrant, a cross-linking agent, one or more flavors, one or more colors, and combinations thereof.

In certain embodiments, a pharmaceutical composition of the present disclosure can contain from about 5 ppm to about 100 ppm of rebaudioside D2, and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients. In some embodiments, pharmaceutical compositions of the present disclosure can be used to formulate pharmaceutical drugs containing one or more active agents that exert a biological effect. Accordingly, in some embodiments, pharmaceutical compositions of the present disclosure can contain one or more active agents that exert a biological effect. Suitable active agents are well known in the art (e.g., The Physician's Desk Reference). Such compositions can be prepared according to procedures well known in the art, for example, as described in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa., USA. [0127] Rebaudioside D2 can be used with any suitable dental and oral hygiene compositions known in the art. Examples of suitable dental and oral hygiene compositions can be, for example, toothpastes, tooth polishes, dental floss, mouthwashes, mouthrinses, dentrifices, mouth sprays, mouth refreshers, plaque rinses, dental pain relievers, and the like. [0128] Suitable amounts of rebaudioside D2 present in the consumable can be, for example, from about 5 parts per million (ppm) to about 100 parts per million (ppm). In some embodiments, low concentrations of rebaudioside D2, for example, less than 100 ppm, has an equivalent sweetness to sucrose solutions having concentrations between 10,000 ppm to 30,000 ppm.

Suitable fillers, bulking agents and anticaking agents are known in the art. [0135] In certain embodiments, rebaudioside D2 sweetener can be included and/or added at a final concentration that is sufficient to sweeten and/or enhance the sweetness of the consumable products and beverage products. The "final concentration" of rebaudioside D2 refers to the concentration of rebaudioside D2 present in the final consumable products and beverage products (i.e., after all ingredients and/or compounds have been added to produce the consumable products and beverage products). Accordingly, in certain embodiments, rebaudioside D2 is included and/or added to a compound or ingredient used to prepare the consumable products and beverage products. The rebaudioside D2 may be present in a single compound or ingredient, or multiple compounds and ingredients.

[0138] The disclosure will be more fully understood upon consideration of the following non-limiting Examples. EXAMPLES EXAMPLE 1 [0139] In this Example, full-length DNA fragments of all candidate UGT genes were synthesized. [0140] Specifically, the cDNAs were codon optimized for E. coli expression (Genscript, Piscataway, NJ). The synthesized DNA was cloned into a bacterial expression vector pETite N-His SUMO Kan Vector (Lucigen). For the nucleotide sequence encoding the UDP-glycosyltransferase fusion enzyme (EUS) (see, SEQ ID NO:6), a GSG-linker (encoded by the nucleotide sequence: ggttctggt) was inserted in frame between a nucleotide sequence encoding the Oryze sativa uridine diphospho glycosyltransferase (EUGT11) domain (see, SEQ ID NO:2) and the nucleotide sequence encoding the A. thaliana sucrose synthase 1 (AtSUSl) domain (see, SEQ ID NO:4). Table 2 summarizes the protein and sequence identifier numbers. Table 2. Se uence Identification Numbers. [0141] Each expression construct was transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3), which was subsequently grown in LB media containing 50 μg/mL kanamycin at 37 °C until reaching an OD6oo of 0.8-1.0. Protein expression was induced by addition of 1 mM isopropyl β-D-l-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and the culture was further grown at 16 °C for 22 hr. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (3,000 x g; 10 min; 4 °C). The cell pellets were collected and were either used immediately or stored at -80 °C. [0142] The cell pellets were re-suspended in lysis buffer (50 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, 25 μg/ml lysozyme, 5 μg/ml DNase I, 20 mM imidazole, 500 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 0.4% TRITON X-100). The cells were disrupted by sonication at 4 °C, and the cell debris was clarified by centrifugation (18,000 x g; 30 min). The supernatant was loaded to a equilibrated (equilibration buffer: 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, 20 mM imidazole, 500 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol) Ni-NTA (Qiagen) affinity column. After loading of protein sample, the column was washed with equilibration buffer to remove unbound contaminant proteins. The His-tagged UGT recombinant polypeptides were eluted by equilibration buffer containing 250mM imidazole. After purification, the recombinant EUGT1 1 protein (62kD band indicated by arrow in FIG. 2A) and the EUS fusion enzyme (155kD band indicated by arrow in FIG. 2B) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Molecular weight standards are indicated to left of each SDS-gel image. EXAMPLE 2 [0143] In this Example, recombinant EUGT11 protein and recombinant EUS fusion enzyme were assayed for 1,2-19 O-glucose glycosylation activity using rebaudioside A as the steviol glycoside substrate. [0144] The recombinant polypeptides (10 μg) were tested in a 200 μΐ^ in vitro reaction system. The reaction system contained 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, 3 mM MgC¾, 1 mg/ml steviol glycoside substrate, and 1 mM UDP-glucose. The reaction was performed at 30 °C and terminated by adding 200 μϊ^ of 1-butanol. The samples were extracted three times with 200 μϊ^ of 1-butanol. The pooled fraction was dried and dissolved in 70 of 80% methanol for high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis. Rebaudioside A (purity 99%) was used as the substrate. Rebaudioside A was obtained from Blue California (Rancho Santa Margarita, CA). In vitro reactions were carried out for 14 hours and 24 hours. FIG. 3 A shows the peak for rebaudioside D (labeled "Reb D") for comparison. [0145] The UGT catalyzed glycosylation reaction was coupled to a UDP-glucose generating reaction (referred to herein as the "UGT-SUS coupling system") catalyzed by a sucrose synthase (e.g., AtSUSl). Specifically, the Arabidopsis thaliana sucrose synthase 1 (AtSUS l) sequence (Bieniawska et al., Plant J. 2007, 49: 810-828) was synthesized and inserted into a bacterial expression vector. The recombinant AtSUSl protein was expressed and purified by affinity chromatography. The AtSUS l protein was added to the EUGT1 1 protein to form an in vitro reaction mixture referred to herein as the EUGT1 1- AtSUSl coupling system. In the resultant UGT-SUS (e.g., EUGT 11 -AtSUSl) coupling system, the UDP-glucose was generated from sucrose and UDP, such that the addition of an extra UDP-glucose was omitted. [0146] HPLC analysis was performed using a Dionex UPLC ultimate 3000 system (Sunnyvale, CA), including a quaternary pump, a temperature controlled column compartment, an auto sampler and a UV absorbance detector. A Phenomenex Luna NH2 with guard column, 150 x 3.0 mm, 3 μιη (100 A) was used for the characterization of steviol glycosides. 72% acetonitrile in water was used for isocratic elution in HPLC analysis. [0147] As shown in FIG. 3, EUS and EUGT11 transferred a sugar moiety to rebaudioside A to produce rebaudioside D in all reaction conditions. Rebaudioside A was completely converted to rebaudioside D by the EUS fusion enzyme (FIG. 3B and 3E) and the UGT-SUS (i.e., EUGTl l-AtSUSl) coupling reaction system (FIGS. 5D and 5G) at incubation times of 14 hours and 24 hours. However, rebaudioside A was only partially converted to rebaudioside D at 14 hours (FIG. 3C) and 24 hours (FIG. 3F) by the EUGT11 enzyme alone. Furthermore, the same molecule amount of EUS had a higher enzymatic activity than the EUGT1 1 and converted all of the rebaudioside A to rebaudioside D at incubation times of 14 hours (FIG. 3B) and 24 hours (FIG. 3E). These results demonstrated that the reaction of the UGT-SUS (i.e., EUGTl l-AtSUSl) coupling system could be achieved using the EUS fusion enzyme. Additionally, these results demonstrated that EUGT11 showed a 1,2-19 O-glucose glycosylation activity to produce rebaudioside D from rebaudioside A (FIGS. 3C and 3F) and that AtSUSl enhanced the conversion efficiency by EUGT1 1 in the UGT-SUS coupling system (FIGS. 3B, 3D, 3E and 3G). FIG. 3A shows peaks for stevioside (labeled "Ste"), rebaudioside A (labeled "Reb A") and rebaudioside D (labeled "Reb D") for comparison. EXAMPLE 3 [0148] In this Example, EUGT1 1 and EUS were assayed for 1,2-19 O-glucose glycosylation activity using stevioside as the steviol glycoside substrate at incubation times of 14 hours and 24 hours as described in Example 2. [0149] In addition to the conversion of rebaudioside A to rebaudioside D by EUGT1 1 as discussed in Example 2 above, EUGT11 also converted stevioside to rebaudioside E (labeled "Reb E" in FIG. 4). Surprisingly, an unexpected compound, rebaudioside D2 (labelled "Reb D2" in FIG. 4), having a HPLC retention time of about 7.28 minutes was produced by both EUGT11 and EUS in all reactions. When AtSUSl was added to the EUGT11 reaction mixture to create the UGT-SUS coupling system (FIGS. 4D and 4G) and when EUS was used (FIGS. 4B and 4E), more rebaudioside D2 was produced. Along with the increase in rebaudioside D2 production, rebaudioside E (labeled "Reb E" in FIGS. 4C and 4F) that was produced was consumed during the production of the rebaudioside D2. These results indicated that EUGT1 1 can catalyze the reaction to produce a rebaudioside (rebaudioside D2) from rebaudioside E. FIG. 4A shows peaks for stevioside (labeled "Ste"), rebaudioside A (labeled "Reb A") and rebaudioside D (labeled "Reb D") for comparison. EXAMPLE 4 [0150] In this Example, to confirm the conversion of rebaudioside E to rebaudioside D2 in vitro, EUGTl l and EUS were assayed using rebaudioside E as the steviol glycoside substrate as described in Example 2. [0151] For comparison, the enzymatic activities of another UGT (UGT76G1) was also assayed. UGT76G1, from stevia, has been identified as an enzyme that transfers a sugar residue to C-3 ' of the C13 O-glucose of stevioside to form rebaudioside A. As shown in FIG. 5F and 5 J, when UGT76G1 was used in the UGT-SUS coupling system, a sugar residue was transferred to the C-3' of the C13 O-glucose of rebaudioside E to form rebaudioside D. FIGS. 5A and 5B show purified rebaudioside D ("Reb D") and rebaudioside E ("Reb-E") for comparison. [0152] As discussed in Example 3 above and shown in FIG. 5C and 5G, EUGT1 1 alone could transfer one glucose molecule to rebaudioside E to form a rebaudioside (referred to herein as "rebaudioside D2" and labeled "Reb D2" in FIGS. 5C and 5G) that was distinct from rebaudiosides D and E (compare peaks in FIGS. 5A and FIG. 5B, respectively). EUGTl l in the UGT-SUS coupling system (FIGS. 5D and 5H) and EUS (FIGS. 5E and 51) enhanced the conversion from rebaudioside E to rebaudioside D2. [0153] These results demonstrated that EUGTl l is a UGT with 1,2-19 O-glucose glycosylation activity to produce related steviol glycosides. EUGTl l can catalyze the reaction to produce Reb-E from stevioside as substrate and Reb D from Reb A as substrate. Surprisingly, a compound (Reb D2) was unexpectedly synthesized in the in vitro reaction with stevioside as substrate. Further experiments confirmed that Reb D2 was directly synthesized from Reb E. According to the structure of Reb D2, in the in vitro reaction, EUGTl l transferred a D-glucose to the C-6' of the C13 O-glucose of Reb-E to generate a l,6- -glycosidic linkage. EXAMPLE 5 [0154] In this Example, the rebaudioside (rebaudioside D2) was purified from an enlarged in vitro reaction and prepared for liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analyis. [00155] The rebaudioside (rebaudioside D2) was purified from an enlarged in vitro reaction. The in vitro reaction was monitored by HPLC analysis. At the desired time point, Reb D2 compound was purified by column and concentrated by vacuum drying. The purified Reb D2 was white powder with 95% purity. The collected Reb D2 compound was used for High Resolution Mass Spectra (HRMS) analysis. HRMS data were generated with a LTQ Orbitrap Discovery HRMS instrument, with its resolution set to 30k and data was scanned from m/z 150 to 1500 in positive ion electrospray mode. The needle voltage was set to 4 kV; the other source conditions were sheath gas = 25, aux gas = 0, sweep gas = 5 (all gas flows in arbitrary units), capillary voltage = 30V, capillary temperature = 300°C, and tube lens voltage = 75. The sample was diluted with 2:2: 1 acetonitrile: methanol: water (same as infusion eluent) and 50 microliters of sample were injected. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectra were acquired using a Bruker Avance DRX 500 MHz instrument or a Varian INOVA 600 MHz instrument using standard pulse sequences. The ID (XH and 13C) and 2D (TOCSY, HMQC, and HMBC) NMR spectra were performed in pyridine-d5 (also known as C5D5N). [00156] The molecular formula of Reb D2 was deduced as C50H80O28 on the basis of its positive high resolution mass spectrum (HRMS) which showed adduct ions corresponding to [M+ NH4]+ and [M+ Na]+ at m/z 1 146.5169 and 1151.4721 respectively; this composition was supported by the 13C NMR spectral data. The XH NMR spectral data of Reb D2 showed the presence of two methyl singlets at δ 1.10 and 1.44, two olefinic protons as singlets at δ 5.09 and 5.72 of an exocyclic double bond, nine sp3 methylene and two sp3 methine protons between δ 0.74-2.80, which is characteristic for the e«?-kaurane diterpenoids isolated from the genus Stevia. [00157] The basic skeleton of e«?-kaurane diterpenoids was supported by the TOCSY studies which showed key correlations: H-l/H-2; H-2/H-3; H-5/H-6; H-6/H-7; H- 9/H-l l; H-l l/H-12. The XH NMR spectrum of Reb D2 also showed the presence of anomeric protons resonating at δ 5.04, 5.10, 5.21, 5.48, and 6.30; suggesting five sugar units in its structure. Acid hydrolysis of Reb D2 with 5% H2S04 afforded D-glucose which was identified by direct comparison with an authentic sample by TLC. The large coupling constants observed for the five anomeric protons of the glucose moieties at δ 5.04 (d, J=7.5 Hz), 5.10 (d, J=7.4 Hz), 5.21 (d, J=7.9 Hz), 5.48 (d, J=7.9 Hz), and 6.30 (d, J=7.9 Hz), suggested their β-orientation as reported for other steviol glycosides. The XH and 13C NMR values for Reb D2 were assigned on the basis of TOCSY, HMQC and HMBC data and are summarized in Table 3. Table 3. XH and 13C NMR values for Reb D2 and Reb E. [00158] Based on the extensive ID (¾ and 13C), 2D NMR (TOCSY, HMQC, and HMBC) and high resolution mass spectral (HRMS) data, the structure of Reb D2 was identified and compared to the structure of rebaudioside E (see, FIG. 6). [00159] Based on the results from NMR spectral data and hydrolysis experiments of Reb D2, it was concluded that there were five β-D-glucosyl units in its structure connected to the aglycone steviol. A close comparison of the ΧΗ and 13C NMR values of Reb D2 with rebaudioside E (see, Table 2) suggested the presence of a steviol aglycone moiety with a 2-0- -D-glucobiosyl unit at CI 3 in the form of an ether linkage and another 2-0- -D-glucobiosyl unit at CI 9 position in the form of an ester linkage, leaving the assignment of the additional β-D-glucosyl unit. Further, from the C NMR spectral data of Reb D2 which showed that one of the five oxymethine carbons of sugar moieties appeared downfield at δ 69.8, suggested the placement of the additional β-D-glucosyl unit at this position. Identical proton and carbon spectral data for the two sugars I and IV in Reb D2 and Reb E suggested the placement of the additional β-D-glucosyl unit at the 6- position of either sugar II or sugar III. The downfield shift for both the XH and 13C chemical shifts at the 6-position of sugar II of the β-D-glucosyl moiety suggested the additional β-D-glucosyl unit was attached at this position. The structure was further supported by the key TOCSY and HMBC correlations as shown in FIG. 7. [00160] Based on the results of NMR and mass spectral data as well as hydrolysis studies, the structure of Reb D2 produced by the enzymatic conversion of rebaudioside E was deduced as 13-[(2-0^-D-glucopyranosyl-6-0^-D-glucopyranosyl^-D- glucopyranosyl)oxy] ent- &m- 16-en- 19-oic acid-(2-0^-D-glucopyranosyl^-D- glucopyranosyl) ester. [0161] 13-[ ( 2-0-fi-D-glucopyranosyl-6-0-fi-D-glucopyranosyl-fi-D- glucopyranosyl)oxy] ent-kaur-16-en- 19-oic acid-(2-0-fi-D-gIucopyranosyI-fi-D- glucopyranosyl) ester (Reb D2). White powder; XH-NMR (600 MHz, C5D5N, δ ppm) and 13C-NMR (150 MHz, C5D5N, δ ppm) spectroscopic data see Table 2; HRMS (M+NH4)+ m/z 1 146.5169 (calcd. for C50H84O28 : 1146.5180), (M+Na)+ m/z 1 151.4721 (calcd. for C5oH8o028Na: 1151.4734). [0162] To a solution of Reb D2 (5 mg) in MeOH (10 ml) was added 3 ml of 5% H2SO4 and the mixture was refluxed for 24 hours. The reaction mixture was then neutralized with saturated sodium carbonate and extracted with ethyl acetate (EtOAc) (2 x 25 ml) to give an aqueous fraction containing sugars and an EtOAc fraction containing the aglycone part. The aqueous phase was concentrated and compared with standard sugars using the TLC systems EtOAc/«-butanol/water (2:7: 1) and CH2Cl2/MeOH/water (10:6: 1); the sugar was identified as D-glucose. [0163] The structure of Reb D2 was confirmed as 13-[(2-0^-D-glucopyranosyl- 6-0^-D-glucopyranosyl^-D-glucopyranosyl)oxy] ent- &m-\ 6-en- 19-oic acid-(2-0^-D- glucopyranosyl^-D-glucopyranosyl) ester on the basis of extensive ID (XH and 13C), and 2D NMR (TOCSY, HMQC, and HMBC), as well as high resolution mass spectral data and hydrolysis studies. EXAMPLE 6 [0164] In this Example, the structure of the rebaudioside (rebaudioside D2) was compared to Reb-E and Reb-D. [0165] According to the steviol glycosides database, only Reb-D contains five β- D-glucosyl units in its structure connected to the aglycone steviol, two glycosidic residues at the CI 9 position and three glycosidic residues at the C13 position of the aglycone steviol. UGT76G1 from stevia has been identified as an enzyme that transfers a sugar residue to C-3' of the C13 O-glucose of Reb E to form rebaudioside D (see, FIGS. 5F and 5J). Reb D2 is a steviol glycoside that also contains five D-glycosidic residues with different structure comparison to rebaudioside D (see, FIG. 8). The fifth glycosidic residue ("sugar V") of rebaudioside D2 is positioned at the C-6' of the C-13-0 glucose of Reb E by a 1,6 β glycosidic linkage, whereas the fifth glycosidic residue ("sugar V") of rebaudioside D is positioned at the C-3'of the C13 O-glucose of Reb E by a 1,3 β glycosidic linkage (see, FIG. 8). As described herein, both EUGT11 and EUG can directly convert Reb E into Reb D2 in vitro. EXAMPLE 7 [0166] In this Example, a taste test was conducted on Reb D2. [0167] Sensory evaluation of Reb D2 was performed using sucrose as a control. The sucrose sample purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and prepared control samples at three different concentrations of 1.0%, 3.0%, and 6.0% sucrose in bottled water (w/v) at room temperature. The steviol glycoside Reb D2 at 300, and 600 ppm for sensory evaluation was prepared by adding corresponding mass into a 1000 mL of bottled water. The mixture was stirred at room temperature and the steviol glycoside sample was then evaluated against several control sucrose samples at 1.0%, 3.0%, and 6.0% by a panel of nine volunteers. [0168] The blind results showed consistent results among majority of nine volunteers at two different concentrations (300 and 600 ppm) of the Reb D2; the overall % sweetness equivalence (SE) averages were about 2.4 and 5.4, respectively. The result indicates that the rebaudioside D2 is about 80-90 times sweeter to sucrose. EXAMPLE 8 [0169] In this Example, the solubility of Reb D2 was compared to Reb D. [0170] Reb D2 and Reb D were added to water to prepare solutions with 0.25 mM, 0.5 mM, 1 mM, 1.5 mM, 2 mM, 5 mM and 10 mM Reb D2 and Reb D. Reb D2 powder completely dissolved in water immediately, however only 0.25 mM Reb D totally dissolved in water. Additionally, solutions of Reb D at concentrations of 0.5 mM, 1 mM, 1.5 mM, 2 mM, 5 mM and 10 mM did not dissolve when heated at 30 °C for 72 hours. [0171] These results demonstrate that Reb D2 has a higher solubility in water than does Reb D.
