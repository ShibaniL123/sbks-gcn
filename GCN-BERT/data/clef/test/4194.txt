N,N'-(((((((2,2'-Dimethyl-[1,1'-biphenyl]-3,3'-diyl)bis(methylene))bis(oxy))bis(3-bromo-4,1-phenylene))bis(methylene))bis(azanediyl))bis(ethane-2,1-diyl))diacetamide (Cpd 6)
To a solution of 4,4'-(((2,2'-dimethyl-[1,1'-biphenyl]-3,3'-diyl)bis(methylene))bis(oxy))bis(3-bromobenzaldehyde) 5 (400 mg, 0.66 mmol) in DMF (15 mL) were added N-(2-aminoethyl)acetamide (0.33 mg, 3.30 mmol) and sodium triacetoxyborohydride (699 mg, 3.30 mmol). The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 5 h. The reaction mixture was poured into ice-cold water (50 mL) and extracted with 10% CH2Cl2 in MeOH (3Ã—50 mL). The combined extract was washed with brine, dried over Na2SO4, and concentrated to give the crude product, which was purified by prep-HPLC (Mobile phase: 10 mM Ammonium bicarbonate in H2O:ACN; Column: KROMASIL-C18 (25*150 mm),10u; Gradient:(T % B):-0/50, 8/70, 8.1/98, 10/98, 10.1/50, 12/50; Flow Rate: 25 ml/min; Diluent:ACN+H2O+THF+MeOH) to afford N,N'-(((((((2,2'-dimethyl-[1,1'-biphenyl]-3,3'-diyl)bis(methylene))bis(oxy))bis(3-bromo-4,1-phenylene))bis(methylene))bis(azanediyl))bis(ethane-2,1-diyl))diacetamide (80 mg, yield: 15%, HPLC 96.38%) as a white solid.
