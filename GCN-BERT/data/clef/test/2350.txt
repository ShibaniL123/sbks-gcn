Nano silver-zinc oxide composition Field The present invention relates to silver/zinc oxide based composites, their manufacturing process, antimicrobial membranes comprising these composites and the use of such membranes in water purification systems which may be exposed to microbial contamination. Background It is known that silver-based antimicrobials limit the growth of microbes by multiple effects. Unlike antibiotics, silver is toxic to multiple components of bacterial cell metabolism. These include damage to the bacterial cell wall and membrane permeability leads to gross cellular structural changes, blockage of transport and enzyme systems such as the respiratory cytochromes, alteration of proteins and binding of microbial deoxyribonucleic acid and ribonucleic acid to prevent transcription and division. Typically, the toxicity of silver ions for mammal cells are much lower compared to protozoan cells of e.g. bacteria, algae, yeast. This makes silver highly attractive as non-specific biocide especially for application with water contact even drinking water applications where no restrictions are given for silver ions in the range of ppm concentration. Typically strong effects are observed in concentrations of 40-160 ppm Ag. It is known that polymers and plastics, e.g. when used as coatings on substrates, can suffer from bacterial or algal decay if routinely exposed to water, dampness or moisture. Biofilms of communities of bacteria and algae can settle on the surfaces of these substrates and increase the speed of decay and/or loss of efficacy. Bacteria contained in the influent water are accumulated by the membranes and consequently accumulate on their surfaces. The rapid growth of bacteria results in fouling of the membrane which reduces the flow of water through the membrane and can adversely affect the filtering properties of the membrane. As a result of bacterial growth on the membrane, a gelatinous biofilm is formed on the upstream side of membrane that is very difficult to remove except through the use of aggressive cleaning. This can compromise membrane lifetime as well as incur significant costs. CN 101053782 describes an antibacterial cellulose acetate nanofiltration membrane and the preparation thereof by chemical surface modification of antibacterial nano-particles like titanium dioxide, zinc oxide, silver powder or powdered copper in a plasma reaction chamber and preparation of a casting membrane solution comprising cellulose acetate and the chemically modified antibacterial nano-particles. Furthermore, in Water Research, (2008), 42(18), 4591-4602, antimicrobial materials in form of nano-scale silver and zinc oxide for water disinfection and microbial control are described. Thus, a need for antimicrobials and membranes with long-term antimicrobial activities exists. A reference herein to a patent document or other matter which is given as prior art is not to be taken as an admission that that document or matter was known or that the information it contains was part of the common general knowledge as at the priority date of any of the claims. Summary It has now surprisingly found that a composite of elemental nano-scale silver in micro-scale zinc oxide with a high surface provides improved antimicrobial properties. There is provided a composite comprising, preferably consisting of, (a) 10.1-99.9 % by weight of elemental silver (Ag) and (b) 0.1-89.9 % by weight of zinc oxide (ΖηΟ), whereby the sum of (a) and (b) makes 90% or more by weight of the composite and wherein the elemental silver has a primary particle size of 10-200 nm and the zinc oxide has a primary particle size of 0.1 to below 50pm and the composite has a particle size distribution of 0.1-50 pm and a BET surface area of 10-100 m2/g.

As solvent for the mixtures of the silver- and zinc-salts of step (i) any solvent can be used which is suited to dissolve the corresponding silver- and zinc-salts. Preferred solvents are selected from the group consisting of aqueous solvents, alcohols, ketones, ethers, esters, organic carbonates, organic amines, ionic liquids and mixtures thereof, preferably in combination with surface active substances.

In a preferred embodiment of the invention the washing of the silver- and zinc-carbonates in step (iv) is carried out with solvents which do not dissolve the desired silver- and zinc-carbonates. The term “not dissolving” in this context preferably means dissolution of the silver- and zinc-carbonates of less than 10% by weight based on the total weight of the filter cake by room temperature. In a preferred embodiment of the inventon the silver- and zinc-carbonates are washed with an aqueous solvent, preferably water.The term “washing” in this context preferably means that less than 10 ppm watersoluble salts based on the filtrate different from silver- and zinc-carbonates are present in the filtercake after the washing step with water.

In the following a preferred embodiment of the method for producing a composite of the invention is described in more detail without limiting the invention thereto. In a first step a solution of at least one silver-salt is mixed with a solution of at least one zinc-salt. Afterwards the resulting solution of silver- and zinc-salts is added to a solution of potassium carbonate in water at 50 °C and the resulting silver- and zinc-carbonates are co-precipitated by filtration and washing of the carbonate mixtures with water (until the test strips indicate less than 10 ppm of nitrate in the filtercake), followed by ethanol and filtration. In a further step the formed silver-, zinc-carbonate-mixture which preferably contains as solvent ethanol, preferably pure ethanol, is heated under inert atmosphere up to temperatures between 350-600 °C until mass loss is constant. The process is controlled by TGA (20 °C/min) and by DSC (20 °C/min).

For more details on useful stabilizers and additives, see also list on pages 55-65 of WO 04/106311, which is hereby incorporated by reference. The membrane system may further comprise hydrophilicity enhancing additives, such as those disclosed in WO 02/042530. The amount of the composite of the present invention in the membrane system according to the present invention is preferably 0.05 to 20 weight percent, more preferably 0.05 to 10 weight percent, based on the total weight of the polymer. The weight ratio of the further additives to the composite within the membrane system of the invention is preferably in the range of 5:95 to 95:5. The composite of the invention may be added to the polymer composition forming the membrane system or membrane. A film is formed in which the composite of the invention is dispersed, mainly at the surface. Incorporation of the composite may advantageously be effected by addition of the composite to the polymeric casting solution. The membrane system or membrane may be formed after immersion of said solution in a coagulation bath (mainly water). A preferred embodiment to prepare a membrane system or membran of the invention constitutes the formation of a continous film having microstructural characteristics of ultrafiltration membranes by a membrane solution including Polyethersulfone, Polyvinylpyrolidon as pore former, a composite of the invention and any other additives commonly used in membrane preparation; The membrane system or membrane of the invention is capable of significantly reducing biofilm growth compared to the same membrane system or membrane not containing the substantially water insoluble silver/zinc oxide-based composite of the invention. Closed water systems (water purification, desalination) using e.g. plastic parts such as pipes, filters, valves or tanks can be subject to bacterial or algal colonization and biofilm formation, leading to serious damages of filter efficacy, such as membrane permeability (flow rate), and followed by deterioration of the materials and contamination of the circuit liquids. Other problems with said surfaces can derive from algal or bacterial biofilm formation resulting in an undesired change in their hydrodynamic properties and affecting e.g. the flowrate in pipes, or also the trouble-free use of boats, marine or other limnological applications. The specific composite of the invention provides membrane systems or membranes with particular mechanisms for durable enhancement of antimicrobial properties of the membrane system or membrane. The antimicrobial membrane systems or membranes include a polymeric material and a composite of the invention, which is incorporated into and either homogeneously distributed throughout the polymeric material or dispersed in the polymeric material near its surface. Antimicrobial membrane systems or membranes of the invention may be prepared from organic polymers, e.g. as commonly listed in W004/106311 page 48, bottom paragraph, until page 54 (item 29). Preferred polymers are selected from the group consisting of cellulose acetates, polyacrylonitriles, polyamides, polyolefines, polyesters, polysulfones, polyethersulfones, polycarbonates, polyether ketones, sulfonated polyether ketones, polyamide sulfones, polyvinylidene fluorides, polyvinylchlorides, polystyrenes and polytetrafluorethylenes or mixtures thereof. Even more preferred polymers are selected from the group consisting of polysulfones, polyethersulfones, polyvinylidene fluorides, polyamides, cellulose acetate and mixtures thereof. The amount of the composite according to the invention in the membrane of the invention is preferably 0.05-20 % by weight, more preferably 0.05-10 % by weight, based on the total weight of the organic polymer. The process of antimicrobial membrane preparation often follows the steps as outlined below: In a first step the organic polymers are dissolved in an organic solvent, such as N-methyl pyrrolidone, dichloromethane, dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethylacetamide, etc. ora suitable solvent mixture, e.g. mixture of these. Other common solvents are found in the literature. In a second step the composite of the invention is added to the fraction of solvent and is well dispersed, e.g. using ultrasonic mixer or any other suitable mixing devices. In a third step the slurry is dispersed throughout the polymer solution, e.g. using a mechanical stirrer at optimum speed. In a fourth step other additives (mainly organic and/or polymeric such as listed above, e.g. pore formers and/or hydrophilic additives) commonly used in membrane compositions may be added to the mixture of the composite of the invention and polymer. In a fifth step the resulting solution is cast into a thin film membrane by known methods resulting in a semi permeable or dense membrane with dispersed composite of the invention at least on one side of membrane. Alternatively, in the fifth step the resulting solution is metered into a non-solvent of the polymers where the polymers precipitate in a controlled way to form a semipermeable or dense membrane with the dispersed composite of the invention. Further alternatives of membrane preparation are track-etching, stretching, leaching, interfacial polymerization, sintering, sol-gel processes, adding an active membrane layer, grafting and sputter deposition. The membrane may be used as a stand alone membrane or may be cast on a support to make a composite membrane. Often used are semi-permeable membranes. In a preferred embodiment the water processing is carried out in a membrane system. The membranes, mostly prepared of organic polymer materials, may be those known for reverse osmosis, ultrafiltration, nanofiltration, gas separation, pervaporation and/or microfiltration. They may be cast as a stand alone film or cast on a support film or membrane in the fabrication of composite membranes and may have flat sheet, fine hollow fiber, capillary, spiral wound, tubular, or plate and frame configuration. Furthermore, they may be either asymmetric or symmetric. Asymmetric membranes have pore sizes on one face of the membrane that are different from the pore size on the other face. Symmetric membranes have equal pore sizes on either face. The treatment of the membrane materials (before the membrane is formed) or membranes (finished structure) with the present composite comprises e.g. the incorporation into the membrane material or the membrane structure or into the surface (coating) of the membrane. Said incorporation includes e.g. precipitation or moulding (extrusion) processes. The composite of the invention is generally well fixed within the polymeric material, i.e. it is as a rule non-leachable. The composite of the invention is preferably added as such. The membrane system usually comprises at least one cast semi-permeable or dense membrane having a polymeric structure and the controlled release/slow leaching composite of the invention incorporated into the polymeric material and dispersed throughout said material or, optionally, in a coating layer. The preparation of the semipermeable or dense membranes comprising the composite of the invention is generally known in the art. Cellulose acetate membranes are cast e.g. from a composite solution (dope solution) containing e.g. a mixture of cellulose di- and -triacetate and the composite of the invention in an amount as indicated above on a support (fabric). The solvent used is e.g. a dioxane/acetone mixture wherein also the composite of the invention is readily soluble. They may be cast on a support (polyester fabric) and are allowed to precipitate at lower temperatures. In the preparation of hollow fiber membranes from e.g. polyacrylonitriles polysulfones, polyether sulfones, polyether ketones, polyvinylidene fluorides or sulfonated polyvinylidene fluorides the solvents used are e.g. aprotic solvents such as dimethylformamide, dimethylsulfoxide, dimethylacetamide, N-methylpyrrolidone and mixtures thereof. The composite of the invention is readily dispersable in said solvents or solvent mixtures and will precipitate with the polymer when a non-solvent comes into contact with the dope solution, e.g. by passing the dope solution through a spinneret to form the hollow fiber. Composite membranes, such as composite polyamide membranes, may be prepared by casting a dope solution of a polysulfone and the composite of the invention onto a reinforcing fabric (polyester). When coming into contact with water, the polysulfone and the composite of the invention precipitate onto the reinforcing fabric and form a film. After drying this polysulfone film (membrane) is then soaked with an organic carboxylic chloride solution followed by aqueous amine solution, so that a polyamide layer is formed on the polysulfone membrane. After drying a composite membrane for reverse osmosis is obtained. In an alternative embodiment of the present invention the membrane system may be furnished with antimicrobial properties by rinsing the whole system (membranes, pipes, tanks etc.) with a rinsing liquor containing 0.01 to 2.0% of the composite of the invention, based on the weight of the liquor. The composite of the invention are normally substantive to the polymeric material of the membrane (filtration) system, and by diffusing into the top layer (e.g. coatings) of the polymeric material a long lasting protection against biofilm growth and bacterial and algal decay can be achieved. The rinsing method is also suitable to reactivate antimicrobial activities of antimicrobially exhausted membrane filtration systems. Preferably, the rinsing liquor is an aqueous formulation containing besides the composite of the invention conventional components like surfactants, which may be non-ionic, anionic or zwitter-ionic compounds, sequestering agents, hydrotropes, alkali metal hydroxides (sources of alkalinity), preservative, fillers, dyes, perfumes and others. The components and their use in rinsing liquors are well known to those skilled in the art. The composites of the invention is very efficacious in preventing the growth of almost all kinds of bacteria present in water, have slow, controlled leaching, are safe and non-toxic to human and animal skin, and show good bio-degradability and altogether a more favorable ecological profile in the aquatic environment when compared with e.g. trichlorohydroxydiphenylethers which are also used as antimicrobials. The membrane system of the invention is particularly useful in desalination, membrane bioreactors and other aqueous purification processes. The membranes may be semi-permeable membranes, as commonly used in conventional filtration processes, or dense membranes as used, for example, in reverse osmosis processes. It is thus a further object of the present invention to use the membrane system of the invention for the filtration of aqueous liquids or aqueous dispersions, e.g. selected from liquid food, beverages, pharmaceuticals and pre-products thereof. They may further be used for: gas separation, the separation of bio-molecules or bio-particles, e.g. blood-platelets or bio-polymers of high molecular weight such as proteins, from aqueous liquids or dispersions in biotechnology or medicine, the filtration of water used in power generation, the purification and/or decontamination of water for industrial processes, chemical processes, metal treatment, semiconductor processing, pulp and paper processing, and especially of drinking water and/or waste water. A subject of specific interest is a reverse osmosis membrane system comprising the present composite particles, as advantageously used in desalination processes e.g. for the production of drinking water from sea water. Another application is the use of the membrane system in water reuse applications (RO, NF, MF etc) where microbial growth occurs on the membrane, even with relatively "clean" water, and causes fouling.
