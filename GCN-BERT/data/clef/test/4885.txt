DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS According to an embodiment of the present invention, referring to FIG. 1, a lamp adapter apparatus 10 connects a lamp 12 to a powered toy building block 14, allowing the powered toy building block 14 to receive electrical power from the lamp 12. Advantageously, the lamp adapter apparatus 10 includes a socket mount 16, an expanded connector platform 20, and a plurality of mechanical connectors 22. The powered toy building blocks 14 connect to the lamp adapter apparatus 10 via the plurality of mechanical connectors 22 and receive electrical power therefrom. Referring to FIG. 2, the socket mount 16 has a mount housing 24 defining a socket connector 26 and a mechanical connector 28. The socket connector 26 is configured to be received into a bulb receptacle 30 of the lamp 12 in the same manner as a light bulb, allowing the lamp adapter apparatus 10 to receive electrical power from the lamp 12. In the depicted embodiment, the socket connector 26 is an Edison screw, but other lamp connections could be employed, including, bayonet, bi-pin, wedge, etc. The mechanical connector 28 can be configured to connect to the expanded connector platform 20. Preferably, the mechanical connector 28 is substantially identical to the plurality of mechanical connectors 22 such that a powered toy building block 14 could be inserted directly into the socket mount 16 via the mechanical connector 28. In the depicted embodiment, the mechanical connector 28 is surrounded by an annular recess 32 allowing for increased structural support to the connection between the socket mount 16 and the expanded connector platform 20 or the powered toy building block 14. Referring to FIGS. 3 and 4, the expanded connector platform 20 has upper and lower faces 34, 36. The plurality of mechanical connectors 22 are located on the upper face 34 of the expanded connector platform 20. A mechanical connector 38 is located on the lower face 36 of the expanded connector platform 20. A support ring 40 surrounds the mechanical connector 38. Mechanical connectors 28, 38 connect, with the annular recess 30 receiving the support ring 40, to releasably secure the expanded connector platform 20 to the socket mount 16. This configuration allows for the interchanging of differently-configured expanded connector platforms 20 without changing the socket mount 16, as well as simplifies the installation of the lamp adapter apparatus 10. Additionally, this configuration allows for the use of the same expanded connector platform 20 with different socket mounts 16 carrying differently-styled socket connectors 26. In another embodiment, the expanded connector platform 20 and the socket mount 16 could be a single unit eliminating the need for the mechanical connectors 28, 38. With continuing reference to FIG. 3, the upper face 34 of the expanded connector platform 20 is a planar surface (such as a hexagon). However, it will be appreciated that the expanded connector platform can be designed in a variety of shapes and sizes capable of supporting any number of building block connectors 44 at various orientations. For example, referring to FIG. 5, the upper face 34A of the expanded connector platform 20A includes a plurality of surfaces forming a truncated hexagonal pyramid. Referring to FIG. 6, the powered toy building block 14 includes a body 42 carrying a plurality of block connectors 44 configured to be releasably secured into the plurality of mechanical connectors 22. Preferably, the block connectors 44 (and the mechanical connectors 22, 28, 38) have non-conductive cylindrical bodies 46 with two electrical conductors 50 traversing each body 46 such that a mechanical and electrical connection can be made at any degree of rotation about the connection axis therebetween. In the depicted embodiments, the mechanical connectors 22, 28 are female while the mechanical connector 38 and the block connector 44 are male. However, the male and female connectors could be reversed or other types of complementary mechanical connectors with electrical conductors could also be used. A light emitting diode (LED) 52 can be arranged within the body 42 of the powered toy building block 14 and electrically connected to the at least two of the electrical conductors 50 such that when the powered toy building block 14 is connected to the lamp adapter apparatus 10 and receives electrical power, the LED 52 illuminates. Advantageously, the two electrical conductors 50 also traverse the body 42 of the powered toy building block 14 from each block connector 44 to each other block connector 44 such that connecting an additional powered toy building block to the first powered toy building block 14 also illuminates the LED 52 of the additional powered toy building block 14. It will be appreciated that the present invention is not limited to use with the powered toy building block 14 described herein but may be connected to differently-configured powered toy building blocks having block connectors configured to be received into the plurality of mechanical connectors. For example, the powered toy building block 14 may carry a speaker to generate sound effects upon receiving electrical power and/or video display to generate an image upon receiving electrical power. As shown in FIG. 7, an AC/DC adapter 54 is integrated into the socket mount 16 that rectifies and converts the AC electrical power from the lamp 12 to low voltage DC (such as 4.5 volts) to be supplied to the powered toy building block 14. Advantageously, this configuration allows for the use of different expanded connector platforms 20 with a single socket mount 16. The AC electrical power from the lamp 12 preferably ranges from 100 to 130 volts AC. The DC electrical power supplied to the powered toy building block 14 from the AC/DC adapter 54 preferably ranges 3 to 8 volts DC. However, as shown in FIG. 8, the AC/DC adapter 54A can also be located in the expanded connector platform 20A. Alternatively, the AC/DC adapter 54 can be located in the powered toy building block 14 (not shown). If the lamp 12 supplies DC electrical power, the AC/DC adapter 54 is not needed although some conversion may be required based on the level of the DC voltage input. In use, a light bulb (if installed) is removed from the bulb receptacle 30 of the lamp 12. The lamp adapter apparatus 10 is installed in its place by connecting the socket connector 26 to the bulb receptacle 30 of the lamp 12. The expanded connector 20 platform is connected to the socket mount 16 (if separate) via the mechanical connectors 28, 38, either before or after installing the socket mount 16 into the bulb receptacle 30. As shown in FIG. 9, either before or after the expanded connector platform 20 is plugged into the socket mount 16 and/or connected to the lamp, a user can build models with powered toy building blocks 14 on the expanded connector platform 20. With the expanded connector platform 20 connected to the socket mount 16 and power being supplied from the lamp, the powered toy building blocks 14 can illuminate, generate sound effects and the like. The more illuminated toy building blocks 14 that are connected to the expanded connector platform 20, the more light a user will receive from the lamp. In general, the foregoing description is provided for exemplary and illustrative purposes; the present invention is not necessarily limited thereto.
