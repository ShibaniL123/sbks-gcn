Step 2 Synthesis of Compound I-203
Compound 118 (64 mg, 0.104 mmol) was dissolved in N,N-dimethylacetamide (1.0 mL). To the mixture was added lithium chloride (88 mg, 2.079 mmol), and the mixture was stirred at 120Â°C for 20 hours. 2 mol/L aqueous hydrochloric acid solution (0.5 mL) and water (20 mL) were added thereto, and the mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate (30 mL). The organic layer was dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. After concentration, the residue was purified by HPLC (0.1% formic acid in water - 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile) to obtain Compound I-203 (3 mg, 5% yield).
