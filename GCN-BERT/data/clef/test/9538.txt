Production of 1-(2-oxo-2-(3'-(trifluoromethyl)-[1,1'-biphenyl]-4-yl)ethyl)-5-(pyrrolidin-1-ylsulfonyl)pyridin-2(1H)-one (compound TS-45)
(1) Synthesis of 1-(2-(4-bromophenyl)-2-oxoethyl)-5-(pyrrolidin-1-ylsulfonyl)pyridin-2(1H)-one (compound II)
5-(Pyrrolidin-1-ylsulfonyl)pyridin-2(1H)-one (compound I: 2.28 g, 10 mmol) was dissolved in 100 mL of tetrahydrofuran (THF), to which sodium hydride (purity: 60%, 11 mmol) was added at room temperature, followed by stirring at 60°C for 60 minutes. A solution of 2,4'-dibromoacetophenone in THF (50 mL, 12 mmol) was added to the resulting mixture, followed by stirring at 60°C for 90 minutes. After the reaction solution was cooled to room temperature, water was carefully added to stop the reaction, the obtained reaction product was extracted with CH2Cl2, and the collected organic phase was sequentially washed with water and brine. The organic phase was then dehydrated with MgSO4, and the solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure. The obtained crude product was purified by silica gel column chromatography (CH2Cl2/ethyl acetate = 1:1), and title compound II was obtained as a light-yellow solid (4.13 g, yield: 97%). The following are the physicochemical properties of the obtained compound II.
