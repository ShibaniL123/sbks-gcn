CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/232,208, filed on Aug. 7, 2009. The entire disclosure of the above application is incorporated herein by reference. INTRODUCTION The spinal column provides the main support for the body and is made of thirty-three individual bones called vertebrae. There are twenty-four moveable vertebrae in the spine, while the remaining vertebrae are fused. Each individual vertebra can include a posterior vertebral arch for protecting the spinal cord, posterior processes extending from the vertebral arch, and an anterior, drum-shaped vertebral body having superior and inferior endplates. The vertebral body can transmits loads to adjacent bodies via an anterior intervertebral disc and two posterior facets. The moveable vertebrae are stacked in series and are separated and cushioned by the anterior intervertebral discs. Each intervertebral disc is composed of an outer fibrous ring (i.e., annulus) operating as a pseudo pressure vessel for retaining an incompressible fluid (i.e., nucleus pulposus). The nucleus pulposus is a gel-like substance housed centrally within the annulus and sandwiched between the endplates of the adjacent vertebral bodies. In a healthy disc, the nucleus pulposus acts as a hard sphere seated within the nuclear recess (i.e., fossa) of the vertebral endplates. This sphere operates as the fulcrum (i.e., nuclear fulcrum) for mobility in the spine. Stability is achieved by balancing loads in the annulus and the facet joints. Degenerative disc disease (DDD) affects the physiology of the disc and may be caused by aging, trauma, or various other factors. DDD results in a reduction in disc height, which in turn, alters the loading pattern in the facets. This altered loading pattern may cause symptomatic degeneration of the facet joints, which may reduce stability and compress the nerves branching out of the spinal column. Examples of surgical treatments for DDD include spinal fusion and total disc arthroplasty. Total disc arthroplasty may be used to preserve anatomical motion between adjacent vertebral bodies, may reduce stress sustained by adjacent spinal levels, and may slow down disc degeneration. The present teachings provide a toroid-shaped spinal disc and more particularly, a toroid-shaped spinal disc having superior and inferior components mutually articulating to replicate natural spine movement. According to one aspect, an intervertebral implant for insertion between adjacent vertebral bodies is provided. The intervertebral implant can include a first component. The first component can have a first articulating surface, which can be generally convex. The intervertebral implant can include a second component, which can be generally in the shape of a toroid. The second component can have a second articulating surface. The second articulating surface can be generally concave and articulable with the first articulating surface for retaining motion between the first and second vertebra. The second articulating surface can have a larger radius of curvature than the first articulating surface such that a portion of the first articulating surface extends into an aperture defined by the generally toroid shape. According to a further aspect, an intervertebral implant is provided. The intervertebral implant can include a first component. The first component can include a first articulating surface. The first articulating surface can be generally convex with a first radius of curvature. The intervertebral implant can include a second component, which can be generally in the shape of a toroid. The second component can define an aperture, and can include a second articulating surface. The second articulating surface can be generally concave having a second radius of curvature. The second articulating surface can be articulable with the first articulating surface for retaining motion between the first and second vertebra. The first articulating surface and the second articulating surface can directly articulate relative to one another. Also provided is an intervertebral implant that comprises a first component. The first component can include a first bone engagement surface for engaging a first vertebra and a first articulating surface. The first articulating surface can be generally convex and can have a first radius of curvature. The intervertebral implant can include a second component, which can be generally toroidal in shape. The second component can define an aperture that extends through the second component. The second component can also include a second articulating surface and a second bone engagement surface for engaging a second vertebra. The second articulating surface can be generally concave and can have a second radius of curvature. The second articulating surface can be articulable with the first articulating surface for retaining motion between the first and second vertebra. The second radius of curvature can be larger than the first radius of curvature such that a portion of the first articulating surface extends into the aperture. At least one of the first component and the second component can include an outer shell formed of a first material having a first hardness and an inner core formed of a second material having a second hardness. The second hardness can be different than the first hardness. Further areas of applicability will become apparent from the description provided herein. It should be understood that the description and specific examples are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not intended to limit the scope of the present teachings. DRAWINGS The present invention will become more fully understood from the detailed description and the accompanying drawings, wherein: FIG. 1 is a schematic sagittal view of an intervertebral implant according to the present teachings, the intervertebral implant shown implanted in a spine. FIG. 2 is a perspective view of the intervertebral implant according to the present teachings. FIG. 2A is a superior perspective view of the intervertebral implant of FIG. 2. FIG. 3 is an anterior end view of the intervertebral implant of FIG. 2. FIG. 4 is an inferior view of the intervertebral implant of FIG. 2. FIG. 5 is a sectional view taken along the line 5-5 of FIG. 4. FIG. 6 is a sectional view taken along the line 6-6 of FIG. 4. DESCRIPTION OF VARIOUS ASPECTS The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is not intended to limit the present teachings, application, or uses. It should be understood that throughout the drawings, corresponding reference numerals indicate like or corresponding parts and features. Although the following description is related generally to a method and apparatus for use in an anatomy to repair damaged tissue, such as in the case of degenerative disc disease (DDD), it will be understood that the method and apparatus as described and claimed herein, can be used in any appropriate surgical procedure, such as in a spinal fixation or fusion procedure. Therefore, it will be understood that the following discussions are not intended to limit the scope of the present teachings and claims herein. Referring to the environmental view of FIG. 1, an exemplary intervertebral implant 10 according to the present teachings is illustrated as positioned or implanted between two adjacent vertebral bodies 12 of a spine. Generally, the intervertebral implant 10 can be positioned between endplates 14 of the vertebral bodies 12 to replace a degenerative disc. In certain applications, the intervertebral implant 10 can be positioned between adjacent vertebral bodies 12 in a cervical region of the spine, however, the intervertebral implant 10 can be used in other anatomical locations, such as the lumbar or thoracic spine. Although a single intervertebral implant 10 is illustrated and described herein as being positioned between a single pair of adjacent vertebral bodies 12, it should be understood that any number of intervertebral implants 10 could be positioned between any suitable pair of vertebral bodies 12. As will be discussed herein, the intervertebral implant 10 can be shaped such that the intervertebral implant 10 provides mutually articulating motion at a reduced implant height, which can allow for more natural motion of a spine of a patient. With additional reference to FIGS. 2-6, the intervertebral implant 10 can include multiple components configured for mutual articulation to enable anatomical motion between two adjacent vertebral bodies 12. As illustrated in this example, the intervertebral implant 10 can include a first or inferior component 18 and a second or superior component 20. As will become more apparent below, the inferior component 18 and the superior component 20 can be positioned between adjacent vertebral bodies 12, and can be sized to re-establish a disc height HD associated with a healthy disc 16 to its original dimension. Thus, improved motion and increased stability of the spine may be established. With continued reference to FIGS. 2-6, at least one of the first and second components 18, 20 can have a generally toroidal shape. As used herein, the phrase “generally toroidal shape” and “generally toroid” shall mean a shape having a main body 22 defining a substantially closed perimeter and an opening or aperture 24. The aperture 24 can be a generally central opening, insofar as it is surrounded by the main body 22. As will be discussed in greater detail herein, in the example of FIGS. 2-6, the superior component 20 can have the generally toroidal shape. In other applications, however, the inferior component 18 can additionally or alternatively have the generally toroidal shape. The inferior component 18 can comprise an integral component, which can be composed of a suitable biocompatible material, such as a biocompatible metal or polymer. For example, the inferior component 18 can be composed of titanium, cobalt chromium, stainless steel, pyrolytic carbon, etc. If desired, the inferior component 18 can be coated with a suitable biocompatible coating, such as an antibiotic, bone growth material, etc. It should be noted that although the inferior component 18 is described and illustrated herein as comprising a single integral component, the inferior component 18 could comprise multiple components coupled together, if desired. For example, the inferior component 18 could comprise a biocompatible polymer, such as polyethylene, coupled to a biocompatible metal, such as titanium, through a suitable technique. The inferior component 18 can include a first articulating surface 26 and a first bone engagement surface 28. Generally, the first articulating surface 26 can be positioned opposite the first bone engagement surface 28. As will be discussed in greater detail herein, the first articulating surface 26 can cooperate with the superior component 20 to enable relative motion between the inferior component 18 and the superior component 20. In one example, the first articulating surface 26 can be convex, concave or combinations thereof. In the example of FIGS. 2-6, the first articulating surface 26 can be generally convex. In this regard, as best shown in FIG. 5, the first articulating surface 26 can be substantially hemispherical, and can include a first radius of curvature. It should be noted, however, that the first articulating surface 26 can have any shape that enables motion between the inferior component 18 and the superior component 20. For example, the first articulating surface 26 can include distinct radii of curvature that may or may not be concentric. With reference to FIG. 1, the first bone engagement surface 28 can engage a first vertebra or vertebral body 12a. The first bone engagement surface 28 may be configured in any manner well known in the art to resist expulsion of the intervertebral implant 10 from between the adjacent vertebral bodies 12, and to enable the inferior component 18 to self-center or self-align relative to the vertebral body 12a. In one example, with reference to FIGS. 2-6, the first bone engagement surface 28 can include aggressive multi-angled and self-centering teeth 29 for fixation. The particular structure of the first bone engagement surface 28 will be understood to be beyond the scope of the present teachings. Briefly, however, with reference to FIG. 2A, the teeth 29 of the first bone engagement surface 28 can each include an elongate angled surface T1, which can terminate at a distal point. The distal point can bite into or alter the surface of the vertebral body 12a to couple or fix the inferior component 18 to the vertebral body 12a (FIG. 1). In one example, as shown in FIG. 2A, the various elongate angled surfaces T1 of the teeth 29 can be arranged so as to enable the inferior component 18 to self-center under loads from the adjacent vertebral bodies 12. In this example, the elongate angled surfaces T1 of a first sub-plurality 29a of the teeth 29 can extend in a first direction D1, a second sub-plurality 29b of the teeth 29 can extend in a second direction D2, and a third sub-plurality 29c of the teeth 29 can extend in a third direction D3. Each of the first direction D1, second direction D2 and third direction D3 can be substantially different and can each be directed away from an end 18a of the inferior component 18. The substantially distinct directions of the sub-pluralities 29a, 29b, 29c of the teeth 29 can enable the inferior component 18 to self-center or self-align with the vertebral body 12a. In addition, the inferior component 18 can include a fourth sub-plurality 29d of teeth 29, which can prevent the expulsion of the inferior component 18. With reference to FIGS. 2-6, the superior component 20 can comprise an integral component, which can be composed of a suitable biocompatible material, such as a biocompatible metal or polymer. For example, the superior component 20 can be composed of titanium, cobalt chromium, stainless steel, pyrolytic carbon, etc. If desired, the superior component 20 can be coated with a suitable biocompatible coating, such as an antibiotic, bone growth material, etc. The superior component 20 can be composed of the same material as the inferior component 18, or can be composed of a different material than the inferior component 18, depending upon desired strength properties, wear properties, etc. It should be noted that although the superior component 20 is described and illustrated herein as comprising a single integral component, the superior component 20 could comprise multiple components coupled together, if desired. For example, the superior component 20 could comprise a biocompatible polymer, such as polyethylene, coupled to a biocompatible metal, such as titanium, through a suitable technique. The superior component 20 can be generally toroidal in shape, and can include a second articulating surface 30, a second bone engagement surface 32 and the aperture 24. The second articulating surface 30 may be of any shape to cooperate with the first articulating surface 26 to enable relative motion between the inferior component 18 and the superior component 20. Thus, the second articulating surface 30 can comprise any surface that can cooperate with the first articulating surface 26 to enable relative motion between the vertebral bodies 12. In this example, as the first articulating surface 26 can have a generally convex shape, the second articulating surface 30 can have a generally concave shape. It should be noted, however, that the first articulating surface 26 could comprise a generally concave shape, and the second articulating surface 30 could comprise a generally convex shape, if desired. In this example, the second articulating surface 30 can have a generally hemispherical surface, which can define a second radius of curvature. It should be noted, however, that the second articulating surface 30 can have any shape that enables motion between the inferior component 18 and the superior component 20. For example, the second articulating surface 30 could comprise distinct radii of curvature that may or may not be concentric. In addition, as best shown in FIGS. 5 and 6, the second radius of curvature can be greater than the first radius of curvature, which can establish line contact between the first articulating surface 26 and the second articulating surface 30 of the inferior component 18 and the superior component 20. The line contact may be generally arcuate due to the generally hemispherical surfaces of each of the inferior component 18 and the superior component 20. The line contact between the inferior component 18 and the superior component 20 can maintain stable articulation between the inferior component 18 and the superior component 20. As shown in FIGS. 5 and 6, the intervertebral implant 10 can be devoid of any positive coupling between the inferior component 18 and the superior component 20 while the inferior component 18 and the superior component 20 are in contact with each other along the line of contact. Further, if the second radius of curvature associated with the superior component 20 is greater than the first radius of curvature associated with the inferior component 18, a portion of the first articulating surface 26 can extend into the opening 24 of the superior component 20. In this manner, the profile of the intervertebral implant 10 may be reduced without compromising the performance of the intervertebral implant 10. With reference back to FIGS. 1-6, the second bone engagement surface 32 can engage a second vertebra or vertebral body 12b. The second bone engagement surface 32 may be configured in any manner well known in the art to resist expulsion of the intervertebral implant 10 from between the adjacent vertebral bodies 12, and to enable the superior component 20 to self-center or self-align relative to the vertebral body 12b. As the second bone engagement surface 32 can be similar to the first bone engagement surface 28 described with regard to the inferior component 18, the second bone engagement surface 32 will not be discussed in great detail herein, and the same reference numerals will be used to denote the same or similar components. Briefly, however, in this example, the second bone engagement surface 32 can include the teeth 29, which can self-center or self-align the superior component 20 relative to the vertebral body 12b, while resisting the expulsion of the superior component 20. It should be noted that the second bone engagement surface 32 can include any suitable bone engagement surface known in the art, such as spikes, barbs, etc. With reference to FIGS. 3-6, the aperture 24 can be formed through the superior component 20 so as to extend from the second articulating surface 30 to the second bone engagement surface 32. The aperture 24 can generally receive a portion of the first articulating surface 26 of the inferior component 18, which can reduce an implant height H of the intervertebral implant 10, as will be discussed in greater detail herein (FIG. 3). It will be understood, however, that the aperture 24 need not extend through the superior component 20. In this regard, the opening 24 can extend through only a portion of the superior component 20. In the case of the opening 24 extending only partially through the superior component 20, the opening 24 may intersect the second articulating surface 30, but may extend only substantially through the superior component 20. In other words, the aperture 24 can be formed as a depression within the second articulating surface 30 so that the aperture 24 can receive the first articulating surface 26 of the inferior component 18 to reduce the height H of the intervertebral implant 10, but the aperture 24 need not extend all the way through the superior component 20. In one of various examples, with particular reference to FIGS. 5 and 6, at least one of the inferior component 18 and the superior component 20 can comprise a shell 34 and an inner core 36. By constructing at least one of the inferior component 18 and the superior component 20 to have a shell 34 and a inner core 36, the inferior component 18 and/or superior component 20 can have increased wear properties while providing a degree of compressibility. In other words, the use of a shell 34 and an inner core 36 can provide the benefits of two materials through a single integral component. In this regard, the shell 34 can be constructed of a first material having a first hardness. As the shell 34 can form an outer surface S of the inferior component 18 and/or the superior component 20, the shell 34 can have a suitable hardness that enables the inferior component 18 and/or the superior component 20 to engage the vertebral bodies 12 and articulate relative to each other. In addition, the shell 34 can have a thickness T. The thickness T of the shell 34 can coordinate with the hardness of the shell 34 to facilitate the desired wear characteristics and to enable a degree of compressibility for the inferior component 18 and/or the superior component 20. It can be desirable to have a degree of compressibility for the inferior component 18 and/or the superior component 20 as it enables the patient to undergo some flexion of the spine, thereby providing the patient with more natural motion. With continued regard to FIGS. 5 and 6, the inner core 36 can be constructed of a second material having a second hardness. As the inner core 36 can be wholly retained within the shell 34, the second hardness of the inner core 36 can be distinct from the first hardness of the shell 34. In this example, the first hardness of the shell 34 can be greater than the second hardness of the inner core 36. For example, the shell 34 can be constructed of pyrolytic carbon and the inner core 36 can be constructed of graphite. The use of the pyrolytic carbon for the shell 34 can protect the inferior component 18 and/or the superior component 20 from wear, while the use of graphite for the inner core 36 can provide a degree of compressibility for the inferior component 18 and/or the superior component 20. In the example of FIGS. 2-6, each of the inferior component 18 and the superior component 20 can include the shell 34 and the inner core 36, however, it will be understood that only one of the inferior component 18 or the superior component 20 or none of the inferior component 18 and the superior component 20 could include the shell 34 and inner core 36. With reference to FIGS. 5 and 6, in order to assemble the intervertebral implant 10, the inferior component 18 can be aligned with the superior component 20 such that the first articulating surface 26 is at least partially received within the aperture 24, and the first articulating surface 26 is in contact with the second articulating surface 30. Then, with the intervertebral implant 10 assembled, the intervertebral implant 10 can be inserted into the anatomy. As the insertion of the intervertebral implant 10 is generally well known in the art, the insertion of the intervertebral implant 10 will not be discussed in great detail herein. Briefly, however, in order to insert the intervertebral implant 10 into the anatomy, such as between adjacent vertebral bodies 12 (FIG. 1), the anatomy can be prepared to receive in the intervertebral implant 10. In this regard, surgical access can be made to an area adjacent to the vertebral bodies 12. For example, surgical access can be obtained via a minimally invasive surgical procedure or a posterior unilateral open procedure. With access gained to the surgical site, the surgical site can be prepared to receive the intervertebral implant 10. Then, the intervertebral implant 10 can be coupled to a suitable instrument, which can guide the intervertebral implant 10 into the space defined between the adjacent vertebral bodies 12. With the intervertebral implant 10 properly positioned between the vertebral bodies 12, the intervertebral implant 10 can restore the space between the adjacent vertebral bodies 12 to a height substantially similar to the height HD of a healthy disc 16. In this regard, with reference to FIG. 1, when the intervertebral implant 10 is positioned between adjacent vertebral bodies 12, the implant height H of the intervertebral implant 10 can be substantially similar to the height HD of a healthy disc 16 so as to restore substantially normal function to the spine of the patient. In one example, the implant height HD of the intervertebral implant 10 can range from about 4.0 millimeters (mm) to about 9.0 millimeters (mm). In certain particular applications, the implanted height H of the intervertebral implant 10 may be no greater than 8.5 millimeters (mm). It will be understood that the implanted height H of the intervertebral implant 10 may be different than a height HF associated with an assembled intervertebral implant 10, as the teeth 29 of the first bone engagement surface 28 and the second bone engagement surface 32 may bite into and be substantially received into the respective vertebral body 12. Further, the implant height H of the intervertebral implant 10 can be adjusted for optimal fit between the adjacent vertebral bodies 12, and the implant height H can depend upon the particular anatomical conditions of the patient. Thus, in certain instances, it may be desirable to provide a kit of various intervertebral implants 10, each having a distinct implant height H. While specific examples have been described in the specification and illustrated in the drawings, it will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art that various changes can be made and equivalents can be substituted for elements thereof without departing from the scope of the present teachings. Furthermore, the mixing and matching of features, elements and/or functions between various examples is expressly contemplated herein so that one of ordinary skill in the art would appreciate from the present teachings that features, elements and/or functions of one example can be incorporated into another example as appropriate, unless described otherwise, above. Moreover, many modifications can be made to adapt a particular situation or material to the present teachings without departing from the essential scope thereof. Therefore, it is intended that the present teachings not be limited to the particular examples illustrated by the drawings and described in the specification, but that the scope of the present teachings will include any embodiments falling within the foregoing description. 1.
