BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a clothing member or material or article, and more particularly to a clothing member or material or article including a posture correcting mechanism or device for suitably correcting or straightening or improving the back portion or posture of the user and for preventing the user from heading down. 2. Description of the Prior Art Typical clothing members or materials or articles comprise one or more elastic elements or materials attached or mounted or secured or engaged onto the clothing members for providing a spring biasing force onto the user and/or for resisting the movement of the user and for allowing the user to conduct various exercise operations or the like. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 7,509,822 to Ishida et al. discloses one of the typical clothing members or materials or articles comprising a main body formed of high-tightness, main-body knitting fabric made of power net, front and back support pieces disposed around the waist and having no elasticity in a longitudinal direction thereof. Side waist pieces disposed between the front and back support pieces are formed by sewing high-tightness, net-like knitting fabric to the main-body knitting fabric at the top edge while leaving the bottom edge unsewn. The article of clothing has a pant-like shape with left and right leg parts that can be tightly fitted around the thighs, with effects of back pain exercise, for preventing or relieving back pain. However, the typical clothing members or materials or articles comprise a pant-like shape with left and right leg parts for tightly fitting around the thighs, with effects of back pain exercise only, for preventing or relieving back pain, but may not be used to correct or improve the posture of the upper portion of the user. The present invention has arisen to mitigate and/or obviate the afore-described disadvantages of the conventional clothing members. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The primary objective of the present invention is to provide a clothing member or article including a posture correcting mechanism or device for suitably correcting or straightening or improving the back portion or posture of the user and for preventing the user from heading down. In accordance with one aspect of the invention, there is provided a clothing article comprising a torso element including a right shoulder portion and a left shoulder portion and a back portion, a right elastic piece provided on the right shoulder portion of the torso element for engaging with a right shoulder of a user, a left elastic piece provided on the left shoulder portion of the torso element for engaging with a left shoulder of the user, and a lower elastic piece provided on the back portion of the torso element and coupled between the right and the left elastic pieces for pulling the right and the left shoulders of the user toward each other and for correcting a posture of the user and for preventing the user from heading down. The lower elastic piece is preferably coupled between lower portions of the right and the left elastic pieces for suitably pulling the right and the left shoulders of the user toward each other and for suitably correcting the posture of the user. A middle elastic piece may further be provided and attached or mounted on the back portion of the torso element for further pulling the back portion of the user and for further correcting the posture of the user. The middle elastic piece is preferably coupled to an intermediate portion of the lower elastic piece. Further objectives and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from a careful reading of the detailed description provided hereinbelow, with appropriate reference to the accompanying drawings. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIG. 1 is a front perspective view of a clothing member or material or article in accordance with the present invention; FIG. 2 is a rear perspective view of the clothing member or material or article; FIG. 3 is another front perspective view similar to FIG. 1, illustrating the operation of the clothing member and/or the attachment of the clothing member onto a user; FIG. 4 is another rear perspective view similar to FIG. 2, illustrating the operation of the clothing member and/or the attachment of the clothing member onto a user; FIG. 5 is a partial front plan schematic view of the clothing member; and FIG. 6 is a partial rear plan schematic view of the clothing member. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT Referring to the drawings, and initially to FIGS. 1 and 2, a clothing member or material or article 1 in accordance with the present invention is normally made of knitting fabric and/or formed of main-body knitting fabric that is made of power net to provide a high degree of tightness, and comprises a function for shaping or correcting or straightening or improving the back portion or posture of the user and for preventing the user from heading down when worn by a user 8 (FIGS. 3-6). The clothing member or material or article 1 includes a torso part or body or element 10 and a right shoulder part or portion 11 and a left shoulder part or portion 12 disposed above and/or beside the torso part or body or element 10 for being worn by the user 8. The clothing article 1 further includes a right elastic piece or ring 20 formed or provided on the right shoulder portion 11 of the torso element 10 for engaging onto or with the right shoulder 80 of the user 8, and a left elastic piece or ring 21 formed or provided on the left shoulder portion 12 of the torso element 10 for engaging onto or with the left shoulder 81 of the user 8, and a lower or bottom elastic piece or band 22 formed or provided on the back portion 13 of the torso element 10 and coupled and engaged between the lower or bottom portions 23, 24 of the right and the left elastic pieces 20, 21 for pulling the right and the left shoulders 80, 81 of the user 8 toward each other and for correcting or straightening or improving the back portion or posture of the user and for preventing the user from heading down. It is preferable that the clothing article 1 further includes a middle or intermediate elastic piece or band 25 formed or provided on the middle or intermediate portion of the back portion 13 of the torso element 10 and coupled and engaged with the middle or intermediate portion 26 of the lower or bottom elastic piece or band 22 and for further pulling the back portion of the user 8 and for further correcting or straightening or improving the back portion or posture of the user 8 and for further preventing the user 8 from heading down. In operation, as shown in FIGS. 3-6, the user 8 may easily and quickly and readily and directly engage into the clothing article 1 or wear the clothing article 1, and the right and the left elastic pieces 20, 21 and/or the lower or bottom elastic piece or band 22 and/or the middle or intermediate elastic piece or band 25 may pull the right and the left shoulders 80, 81 of the user 8 toward each other and/or may pull the back portion of the user 8 for correcting or straightening or improving the back portion or posture of the user 8 and for preventing the user 8 from heading down. Accordingly, the clothing article in accordance with the present invention includes a posture correcting mechanism or device for suitably correcting or straightening or improving the back portion or posture of the user and for preventing the user from heading down. Although this invention has been described with a certain degree of particularity, it is to be understood that the present disclosure has been made by way of example only and that numerous changes in the detailed construction and the combination and arrangement of parts may be resorted to without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as hereinafter claimed. 1.
