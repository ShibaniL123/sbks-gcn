BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a method for preparing a lithium iron phosphate nanopowder coated with carbon. Description of the Related Art As technical development and consumption of mobile devices increase, the demand for secondary batteries as energy sources is suddenly increasing. Among such secondary batteries, lithium secondary batteries having high energy density and voltage, a long life cycle, and a low self-discharge rate are being commercialized and widely used. Common lithium secondary batteries use lithium cobalt oxide (LiCoO2) as the main component of a cathode active material. However, since the cobalt oxide containing lithium is unstable and expensive, the mass production of lithium secondary batteries including thereof is difficult. Recently, lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) compound having a voltage against lithium of ∼3.5 V, a high volume density of 3.6 g/cm3, and a theoretical capacity of 170 mAh/g, as well as good stability at high temperature, and being cheap when compared to the lithium cobalt oxide, is being viewed as a suitable cathode active material for a lithium secondary battery. As methods for preparing the lithium iron phosphate compound, a solid-state reaction method or a liquid-state reaction method such as a hydrothermal synthesis method and a supercritical hydrothermal synthesis is known. Recently, a glycothermal synthesis method is using a non-aqueous solvent such as ethylene glycol or diethylene glycol as a reaction solvent has been developed. According to the hydrothermal synthesis method and the supercritical hydrothermal synthesis method, the preparation of the lithium iron phosphate nanopowder is performed under high temperature and high pressure conditions, giving rise to safety concerns. In addition, according to the glycothermal synthesis method, the control of the particle size and the particle size distribution of the lithium iron phosphate nanopowder may be difficult. The lithium iron phosphate has a relatively lower electric conductivity when compared to other cathode active materials including lithium. Particularly, lithium cobalt oxide (LiCoO2) has the electric conductivity of about 10-4 S/cm and lithium manganese oxide (LiMn2O4) has about 10-5 S/cm. On the contrary, the electric conductivity of lithium iron phosphate is 10-9 S/cm, which is smaller by about 10,000 times or more. Therefore, cathode material particle is necessary to be prepared as small nano-sized particle to supplement the low electric conductivity of the lithium iron phosphate material, and a conductive layer having good electric conductivity is necessary to be formed on the surface of the cathode material particle to increase the electric conductivity. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION An aspect of the present invention provides a method for preparing a lithium iron phosphate nanopowder including a carbon coating layer formed on particle, of which particle size and particle size distribution may be controlled by using a novel reaction solvent and by performing two simple steps of 1) preparing nanoseed particle in a short time which is the precursor of the lithium iron phosphate nanopowder and 2) heat treating thereof.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT Exemplary embodiments of the present invention will now be described in detail. In the method for preparing a lithium iron phosphate nanopowder according to the present invention, two simple steps of preparing lithium iron phosphate nanoseed particle and then heat treating the nanoseed particle is performed. A lithium iron phosphate nanopowder including a carbon coating layer on particle may be prepared in a short time and particle size and particle size distribution may be controlled. In an embodiment for attaining an aspect of the invention, there is provided a method for preparing a lithium iron phosphate nanopowder coated with carbon including (a) preparing a mixture solution by adding a lithium precursor, an iron precursor and a phosphorus precursor in a reaction solvent, (b) putting the reaction mixture into a reactor and reacting to prepare amorphous lithium iron phosphate nanoseed particle, and (c) heat treating the lithium iron phosphate nanoseed particle thus to prepare the lithium iron phosphate nanopowder in which a portion or the whole of the surface of a particle is coated with carbon. In another embodiment of the present invention, the nanoseed particle prepared in Step (b) may go through at least one step among a cooling step, a washing step and a drying step. Hereinafter the present invention will be described in detail step by step. Preparation of mixture solution (Step a) First, a lithium precursor, an iron precursor, and a phosphorus precursor are prepared and added in a reaction solvent to prepare a homogeneous mixture solution. The lithium precursor thus added may be at least one selected from the group consisting of lithium acetate dihydrate (CH3COOLi·2H2O), lithium hydroxide monohydrate (LiOH·H2O), lithium hydroxide (LiOH), lithium carbonate (Li2CO3), lithium phosphate (Li3PO4), lithium phosphate dodecahydrate (Li3PO4·12H2O) and lithium oxalate (Li2C2O4), and a mixture thereof. The iron precursor added may be at least one selected from the group consisting of iron citrate (FeC6H5O7), iron citrate hydrate (FeC6H5O7·nH2O), ferrous sulfate heptahydrate (FeSO4·7H2O), iron (II) oxalate dihydrate (FeC2O4·2H2O), iron acetyl acetonate (Fe(C5H7O2)3), iron phosphate dihydrate (FePO4·2H2O) and ferric hydroxide (FeO(OH)), and a mixture thereof. The phosphorus precursor added may be at least one selected from the group consisting of tri-ammonium phosphate trihydrate ((NH4)3PO4·3H2O), ammonium phosphate ((NH4)2HPO4), ammonium dihydrogen phosphate (NH4H2PO4) and phosphoric acid (H3PO4), and a mixture thereof. Meanwhile, the mixing ratio of the lithium precursor, the iron precursor and the phosphorus precursor during the forming of the mixture solution is not specifically limited, and may be, for example, 0.1-10:1:0.1-10 by the molar ratio. In addition, the iron precursor may be added from about 0.005 to about 10 parts by weight based on 1 part by weight of the reaction solvent, and the lithium precursor and the phosphorus precursor may be added by corresponding molar ratios considering the amount of the iron precursor. A stirring step may be further conducted during preparing the mixture solution so that the lithium precursor, the iron precursor and the phosphorus precursor may be homogeneously dispersed in the reaction solvent. Meanwhile, the reaction solvent may be a butandiol solvent which is a non-aqueous solvent and has a relatively high boiling point. In an embodiment of the present invention, the reaction solvent may include at least one selected from the group consisting of 1,2-butandiol, 1,3-butandiol, 1,4-butandiol, 2,3-butandiol and an isomer thereof. The boiling point of the 1,2-butandiol is about 195°C, the boiling point of the 1,3-butandiol is about 204°C, the boiling point of the 1,4-butandiol is about 235°C, and the boiling point of the 2,3-butandiol is about 177°C. The lithium iron phosphate nanopowder was verified to be synthesized at temperature conditions of at least about 150°C, and the nanoseed particle which is the precursor of the lithium iron phosphate nanopowder were verified to be synthesized at temperature conditions of at least about 120°C. That is, the nanoseed particle is prepared first for the preparation of the lithium iron phosphate nanopowder in the present invention. When the above-described reaction solvents are used, the nanoseed particle may be synthesized at about 120 to 235°C, and Step (b) may be performed at a temperature less than or equal to the boiling point (235°C) of the reaction solvent. Thus, the vaporization degree of the reaction solvent may decrease, and the pressure increase during the performing of the reaction due to vaporization of solvents may be significantly suppressed when compared to a common hydrothermal synthesis method. Therefore, safety throughout the process may be improved. In addition, since the above described solvents are non-aqueous, the problem of iron oxidation may be resolved without using a separate reducing agent. Preparation of nanoseed particle of lithium iron phosphate (Step b) Then, the mixture solution was put into a reactor to perform a reaction. Amorphous lithium iron phosphate nanoseed particle is prepared in this step. The reactor may be a generally used reactor used for preparing a lithium iron phosphate nanopowder in the art and may be an open type reactor or a closed-type reactor, but is not limited thereto. The above Step (b) may be performed at a temperature less than or equal to the boiling point of the reaction solvent used, for example, in a range of 120 to 235°C for 0.1 to 48 hours. Meanwhile, since the above reaction is not for synthesizing a crystallized lithium iron phosphate nanopowder, but for synthesizing lithium iron phosphate nanoseed particle which is the precursor of the lithium iron phosphate nanopowder, a long time is not necessary for finishing the reaction. Thus, the reaction time of Step (b) for preparing the nanoseed particle is preferably short. For example, when the reaction solvent used in the present invention is 1,4-butandiol, the above Step (b) may be performed at 120 to 235°C for 0.1 to 24 hours, and more particularly may be performed at 150 to 235 °C for 0.1 to 5 hours. The lithium iron phosphate nanoseed particle prepared through the above Step (b) are amorphous. The nanoseed particle is not specifically limited that may be crystallized into the lithium iron phosphate nanopowder through a subsequent heat treating process (Step c). The lithium iron phosphate nanoseed particle may have a particle size (Hereinafter will be referred to as a particle diameter) of less than or equal to 50 nm. Meanwhile, the nanoseed particle prepared in the above Step (b) go through at least one step selected from a cooling step, a washing step and a drying step. For example, the nanoseed particle thus prepared may be cooled first, and then washed consecutively using acetone and methanol. In addition, the washed nanoseed particle may be dried. The drying method in the drying step is not specifically limited, and may be conducted at a temperature range of 20 to 160°C for 2 to 40 hours. Preparation of lithium iron phosphate nanopowder (Step c) The lithium iron phosphate nanoseed particle synthesized through the above Step (b) may be heat treated in an inert gas atmosphere to form a lithium iron phosphate nanopowder coated with carbon on a portion or the whole of the surface of individual particle. The heat treating is not specifically limited and may be conducted by heating to a temperature range of 400 to 900°C for 0.5 to 5 hours, for example. The heat treating may be conducted in an inert gas atmosphere, for example in an argon (Ar) or a nitrogen (N2) gas atmosphere. The lithium iron phosphate nanopowder prepared in Step (c) is obtained by crystallizing the amorphous nanoseed particle prepared in Step (b) through the heat treatment. Powder particle may be obtained through the crystallization. In addition, the carbon coating layer may be formed on a portion or the whole of the surface of the powder particle while performing the crystallization. Particularly, the precursor of the carbon coating layer may be the reaction solvent remaining on the surface of the particle after use. A portion of the reaction solvent used may remain on the surface of the particle after conducting the drying step and may be carbonized during the heat treatment at a temperature range of 400 to 900°C, thereby forming the carbon coating layer on the surface of the particle. A separate organic compound may be used as the precursor of the carbon coating layer, and the addition step of the separate organic compound for forming the carbon coating layer on the surface of the lithium iron phosphate nanopowder particle is not specifically limited. In an embodiment of the present invention, the organic compound may be mixed with the solvent together with the lithium precursor, the iron precursor and the phosphorus precursor during the forming of the mixture solution. In another embodiment, the organic compound may be put after forming the lithium iron phosphate nanoseed particle. In further another embodiment, the nanoseed particle is formed, and washing and drying processes are performed. Thereafter, the organic compound may be added. Alternatively, the organic compound may be added during the heat treatment in the above Step (c). The organic compound is not specifically limited, and may be at least one selected from the group consisting of glucose, sucrose, galactose, fructose, lactose, starch, mannose, ribose, aldohexose, ketohexose, and a combination thereof, or a mixture of two or more thereof. Meanwhile, the amount of the organic compound added may be from 0.1 to 5 wt% based on the total amount of the nanoseed particle. When the amount of the organic compound exceeds the upper limit of the range, the thickness of the carbon coating layer may become unnecessarily large. The thickness of the carbon coating layer formed on the surface of the lithium iron phosphate nanopowder particle prepared through the above-described processes may be less than or equal to 10 nm, and may be from 1 to 5 nm. Since the lithium iron phosphate powder has low electric conductivity, the electric conductivity of the lithium iron phosphate powder may be supplemented by forming the carbon coating layer on a portion of or the whole surface of the minute lithium iron phosphate powder particle thus prepared. The lithium iron phosphate nanopowder particle prepared through the series of the above-described steps may have an olivine structure, and include a carbon coating layer formed on a portion or the whole of the surface of the particle. The particle size and the particle size distribution of the particle thus prepared may be primarily controlled by changing the kind of the lithium precursor, the iron precursor, or the phosphorus precursor, or regulating reaction temperature and reaction time of the above Step (b) and secondly controlled by regulating reaction temperature and reaction time of the above Step (c). Generally, the size of the particle may increase when the reaction temperature is elevated or the reaction time is prolonged. The particle diameter of the lithium iron phosphate nanopowder prepared through the above-described processes is not specifically limited, and may be, for example, 30 to 300 nm. The particle size distribution is not specifically limited and may be, for example, less than or equal to 50% of the average value of the particle diameter.

Various shapes such as a film, a sheet, a foil, a net, a porous material, a foamed material, a non-woven fabric, etc. may be used as the current collector. In addition, in an embodiment of the present invention, a lithium secondary battery including a cathode including the cathode active material, an anode, a separator and a non-aqueous electrolyte containing a lithium salt may be provided. The anode may be fabricated by, for example, coating an anode mixture including an anode active material on an anode current collector, and drying. In the anode mixture, the above-described components such as the conductive agent, the binder and the filler may be included as occasion demands. The anode current collector may be any material having high conductivity and not inducing the chemical change of the battery, without specific limitation, and may include, for example, copper; stainless steel; aluminum; nickel; fired carbon; a surface treated material of copper or stainless steel with carbon, nickel, titanium, silver, etc.; and an alloy of aluminum-cadmium. Meanwhile, the current collector may have the thickness of 3 to 500 µm, and minute embossing may be formed on the surface of the current collector to increase the adhesiveness of the anode active material as in the cathode current collector. Various shapes such as a film, a sheet, a foil, a net, a porous material, a foamed material, a non-woven fabric, etc. may be used as the current collector. The separator is disposed between the cathode and the anode, and an insulating thin film having high ion transmittance and high mechanical strength may be used. The pore diameter of the separator may be generally from 0.01 to 10 µm, and the thickness thereof may be generally from 5 to 300 µm. The separator may include a chemical resistant and hydrophobic olefin-based polymer such as polypropylene; a sheet or a non-woven fabric formed by using a glass fiber or polyethylene, etc. When a solid electrolyte such as a polymer is used as the electrolyte, the solid electrolyte may also play the role of the separator.

As described above, the method for preparing the lithium iron phosphate nanopowder coated with carbon of the present invention may be performed at relatively lower pressure conditions when compared to a common hydrothermal synthesis method, a supercritical hydrothermal synthesis method or a glycothermal synthesis method by using a novel reaction solvent. In addition, since a high temperature/high pressure reactor is not used, the process safety and economical feasibility may be secured, while the particle size and the particle size distribution of the lithium iron phosphate nanopowder may be effectively controlled. In addition, through the simple two steps of preparing the nanoseed particle and heat treating thereof, the nanopowder having controlled particle size and particle size distribution may be prepared, and the carbon coating layer may be formed on the particle without performing a separate heat treatment. Thus, the process is economic, and mass production would be favorable. In addition, since the electric conductivity of the lithium iron phosphate nanopowder prepared by the above method could be supplemented, the properties of a cathode active material may be improved, and the cathode active material may be industrially useful.
