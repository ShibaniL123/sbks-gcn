The subject matter of the invention is a method for the hydrometallurgical recovery of lithium, nickel, cobalt from the fraction of used galvanic cells containing lithium transition metal oxides Mobile electronic devices require increasingly powerful rechargeable batteries for self-sufficient power supply. For this purpose, lithium-ion batteries are used on account of the energy density thereof expressed in Wh/kg, cycling stability and low self-discharge. Very widespread are lithium-ion batteries with transition metal oxides as active cathode material. The active cathode material in these batteries consists of lithium transition metal oxides, from which lithium ions are released during charging and intercalated in the anode material. Of particular importance are the mixed oxides of lithium with that of nickel, cobalt and/or manganese, which are also known under the abbreviation NMC-cells or -batteries and also the mixed oxides of lithium with those of nickel, cobalt and/or aluminum, which are also known under the abbreviation NMC-cells or -batteries. High capacity lithium accumulators are used on a large scale for stationary applications (power back-up) or in the automobile field for traction purposes (hybrid drive or pure electric drive). With respect to energy density in the latter applications, NMC-batteries are recognized as being of outstanding importance. Since the amount of recyclable material contained therein grows with the size and number of the manufactured, charged and reused batteries, an economical method for recovery of the lithium within the batteries is indispensable. A method for recovery of lithium from the LiFePO4-containing fraction of shredded and sifted cells is known from the document WO 2012/072619 A1, in which the fraction containing LiFePO4 is treated with acid solution in the presence of an oxidizing agent. The dissolved-out lithium ions are separated from undissolved iron phosphate and precipitate out as salts from the lithium-containing solution. The hydrometallurgical reclamation takes place with sulphuric acid accompanied by introduction of oxygen, ozone or addition of hydrogen peroxide in the temperature range of 80° C. to 120° C. Disadvantages of this method are the high energy intensity of the extraction process, the high requirements with respect to corrosion resistance of the apparatus used and the purity of the lithium salt obtained by precipitation. The object of the invention is to provide a method, which ensures the highest possible energy efficiency in the extraction of lithium with concurrent low requirements with respect to corrosion resistance of the apparatus used and increased purity of the lithium compounds obtained. The stated object is achieved by a method for hydrometallurgical recovery of lithium, nickel, cobalt from the fraction containing lithium transition metal oxide of used galvanic cells, in which a fraction containing lithium transition metal oxides, wherein the transition metals are nickel, cobalt and/or manganese, having an aluminum content up to 5 wt. % and a particle size up to 500 μm is introduced into sulphuric acid having a concentration of 0.5 to 4 mol/l in an amount that is at least stoichiometric relative to the oxide content of the fraction containing lithium transition metal oxide and in a solid/liquid ratio in the range of 20 to 250 g/l, and solubilization takes place with addition of hydrogen peroxide at temperatures of 35 to 70° C. in an amount that is at least stoichiometric relative to the transition metal content to be reduced of the fraction containing lithium transition oxide, the solution containing the formed lithium sulphate and sulphates formed from the mentioned transition metals is separated off and the remaining residue is washed at least twice, the separated sulphates and the solution containing sulphates are combined, the transition metals are precipitated as hydroxides in the pH range of 9 to 11 as hydroxides, separated off and washed and the remaining lithium sulphate-containing solutions are incorporated and are converted to lithium hydroxide by electrodialysis on bipolar membranes. Alternatively, the object is achieved by a method for hydrometallurgical recovery of lithium from the lithium transition metal oxide-containing fraction of used galvanic cells, in which a fraction containing lithium transition metal oxides composed of mixed oxides of metals such as nickel, cobalt and/or aluminum with a particle size up to 500 μm is introduced into sulphuric acid having a concentration of 0.5 to 4 mol/l in an amount that is at least stoichiometric relative to the oxide content of the fraction containing lithium transition metal oxide, and in a solid/liquid ratio in the range of 20 to 300 g/l and solubilization takes place with addition of at least a stoichiometric amount of hydrogen peroxide relative to the transition metal content to be reduced of the fraction containing lithium mixed oxides at temperatures of 35 to 70° C., the formed lithium sulphate and the solution containing the sulphates of the mentioned transition metals are separated off and the remaining residue is washed at least twice, the separated off lithium sulphate and lithium sulphate-containing washing solution are combined, the transition metals are precipitated in the pH range of 9 to 11 as the hydroxide, separated off and washed and the remaining lithium sulphate containing solution is incorporated and is converted by electrolysis with bipolar membranes into lithium hydroxide. The object is likewise achieved by a method for hydrometallurgical recovery of lithium from the lithium transition metal oxide-containing fraction of used galvanic cells, in which a fraction containing lithium transition metal oxides composed of mixed oxides of metals such as nickel, cobalt and/or aluminum with a particle size up to 500 μm is introduced into sulphuric acid having a concentration of 0.5 to 4 mol/l in an amount that is at least stoichiometric relative to the oxide content of the fraction containing lithium transition metal oxide, and in a solid/liquid ratio in the range of 10 to 150 g/l and solubilization takes place with addition of at least a stoichiometric amount of hydrogen peroxide with respect to the transition metal content to be reduced of the fraction containing lithium mixed oxides at temperatures of 35 to 70° C., the formed lithium chloride and the chlorides of the solution containing the mentioned transition metals are separated off and the remaining residue is washed at least twice, the separated off metal chloride and wash-solution containing metal chloride are combined, the transition metals are precipitated in the pH range of 9 to 11 as the hydroxide, separated off and washed and the remaining lithium chloride-containing solution is incorporated and is converted by electrolysis with bipolar membranes into lithium hydroxide. Surprisingly, it was found that the extraction of lithium takes place in a very brief reaction time, nearly quantitatively at low temperatures. Thereby, a virtually-autocatalytic decomposition of the oxidizing agent can be generally avoided, since the metering of the reducing agent is controlled and kept very low. For the extraction of lithium, stoichiometric amounts of reducing agent must be used exclusively. Thereby, the contained lithium is solubilized to more than 99 wt. % under the specified mild, hydrometallurgical dissolution conditions and recovered at more than 95 wt. %. A fraction containing lithium transition metal oxide having an aluminum content of up to 3 wt. %, preferably <1 wt. % is used. Thereby the generation of a flammable, explosive gas mixture is further decreased. Preferably the content of multivalent metal cations is further reduced by means of an ion exchanger. The reduced content of multivalent ions has a particularly positive effect on further processing of the solution by means of electrodialysis with bipolar membranes, since these metal cations act as “membrane poisons” due to deposition thereof in the hydroxide form in and on the membranes used. More preferably the fraction containing lithium transition metal oxide has a particle size up to 500 μm, preferably 100 to 400 μm. The use of the mentioned particle size improves the stated particle size and the dissolution behavior. Advantageously, the sulphuric acid or hydrochloric acid is used at a concentration of 0.75 to 2.5 mol/l, preferably 1.0 to 2.0 mol %/l. The use of sulphuric acid or hydrochloric acid in the stated concentration range considerably reduces the requirements for corrosion resistance of the apparatus used. Particularly preferably in the case of the NMC-cells and use of sulphuric acid, the solid/liquid ratio is adjusted in the range of 50 to 180 g/l. Preferably in the case of the NMC-cells and use of sulphuric acid, the solid/liquid ratio is adjusted in the range of 50 to 250 g/l, preferably 60 to 150 g/l. Regardless of the high solids content in the reaction mixture, the contained lithium is nearly quantitatively dissolved. In the case of the NMC-cells and use of sulphuric acid, the solid/liquid ratio is adjusted in the range of 15 to 120 g/l, preferably 25 to 65 g/l. Preferably the solubilization is carried out at temperatures of 30 to 65° C., preferably at 40 to 60° C. Surprisingly, the effectiveness of the dissolution of the lithium is thereby not substantially influenced by the run time or the amount. The mentioned temperature range is adjustable with ordinary technical equipment. Advantageously, the solubilization residue is washed at least three times. It was found, that thereby more than 95 wt. % of the contained lithium can be obtained. Preferably the sulphuric acid and/or the hydrochloric acid and/or the hydrogen peroxide is used in excess. Particularly preferably an excess of 0.1 to 10 mol % is used, preferably 0.5 to 5% mol %. The product made according to the method is suitable with respect to the purity thereof for production of lithium transition metal oxides or lithium transition metal phosphates and may preferably be used to make active materials for use in cathodes of lithium-ion batteries. The process according to the invention is generally described hereafter. EXAMPLES The invention is explained on the basis of the following examples and Tables 1 to 3.
