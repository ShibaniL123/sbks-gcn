Preparation of compound 1-e.
2-Bromoaniline (10.0 g, 58.5 mmol) was dissolved in pyridine (50 mL) and acetonitrile (50 mL). The reaction solution was cooled to 0Â°C and methanesulfonyl chloride (10.0 g, 87.7 mmol) was added dropwise. The reaction mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature and the stirring was continued for 30 minutes and then concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was dissolved in ethyl acetate (250 mL) and diluted with water (250 mL). The pH of the separated organic phase was adjusted to 7 with 1 M aqueous hydrochloric acid solution. The organic phase was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure to deliver a yellow solid 1-e (14 g, yield: 96%). This product was used without further purification.
