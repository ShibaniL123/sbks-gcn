BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a new and distinct strawberry variety named ‘BG-4.367’. This new variety is a result of a controlled cross made in 2004 in an ongoing breeding program between strawberry variety designated ‘BG-633’ (U.S. Plant Pat. No. 13,320) and strawberry variety designated ‘BG-414.065’ (a non-patented selection). Due to the combining of the reciprocal seed lots, it is unknown as to which parent variety is the seed parent and which parent variety is the pollen parent. The variety is botanically known as Fragaria ananassa. The seedling resulting from the aforementioned cross was selected from a controlled breeding plot in Ventura County, Calif. in the winter of 2006. After its selection, the new variety was asexually propagated by stolons in both Siskiyou County, Calif. and San Joaquin County, Calif. The new variety was extensively tested over the next several years in fruiting fields in Ventura County, Calif. This propagation has demonstrated that the combination of traits disclosed herein as characterizing the new variety are fixed and remain true to type through successive generations of asexual reproduction. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION ‘BG-4.367’ is primarily adapted to the climate and growing conditions of the central coast of California. The nearby Pacific Ocean provides the needed humidity and moderate temperatures to produce a strong vigorous plant and maintain fruit quality during the winter and spring production months. The following traits have been repeatedly observed and are determined to be unique characteristics of ‘BG-4.367’, which in combination distinguish this strawberry plant as a new and distinct variety: 1. Large fruit size;2. Firm to very firm flesh;3. Early season fruit production;4. Strong interveinal blistering; and5. Small petiolule. The strawberry variety that is believed to be most closely related to the new variety ‘BG-4.367’ is ‘BG-959’ (U.S. Plant Pat. No. 17,864). In side-by-side comparisons to the similar strawberry variety ‘BG-959’, ‘BG-4.367’ differs by the following combination of characteristics as described in Table 1.

Color in the photographs may differ slightly from the color value cited in the botanical descriptions which accurately describe the color of ‘BG-4.367’. The depicted plant and plant parts of the new strawberry variety ‘BG-4.367’ are approximately six months old. The photographs were taken in Ventura County, Calif.: FIG. 1 shows typical fruiting field characteristics of ‘BG-4.367’, taken in the month of April 2013; FIG. 2 shows a close-up view of the typical leaf structure of ‘BG-4.367’, taken in the month of April 2013; FIG. 3 shows typical mature and immature field fruit of ‘BG-4.367’, taken in the month of April 2013; and FIG. 4 shows typical internal and external mature fruit characteristics of ‘BG-4.367’, taken in the month of April 2013. DETAILED BOTANICAL DESCRIPTION The new variety ‘BG-4.367’ has not been observed under all possible environmental conditions. The characteristics of the new variety ‘BG-4.367’ may vary in detail, depending upon variations in environmental factors, including weather (temperature, humidity and light intensity), day length, soil type and location. In addition, the characteristics of any parental variety or comparison variety included in Tables 1-9 of the present invention may vary in detail, depending upon variations in environmental factors, including weather (temperature, humidity and light intensity), day length, soil type and location. The aforementioned photographs, together with the following description of the new variety ‘BG-4.367’, unless otherwise noted, are based on observations taken during the 2013 growing season in Ventura County, Calif. These measurements and ratings were taken from plants of ‘BG-4.367’ dug from a high-elevation nursery located in Siskiyou County, Calif. during early October 2012 and planted approximately four to five days later in Ventura County, Calif. The approximate age of the observed plants is six months. Yield observations and fruit quality characteristics are averaged from six years of data collected from the 2008 through 2013 growing seasons. Flower measurements and characteristics are from secondary flowers unless otherwise noted. Fruit characteristics and measurements are from secondary fruit unless otherwise noted. Color terminology where noted follows The Royal Horticultural Society Colour Chart, London (2007). The following tables 3 through 9 describe fruit, plant, stolon, foliage, fruiting truss, flower, and pest and disease characteristics of the new strawberry ‘BG-4.367’.
