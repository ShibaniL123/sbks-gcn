Œê COFFEE TAMPER TECHNICAL FIELD. The invention relates to a high quality hand held coffee tamper having angled sides. BACKGROUND ART The following descriptions are provided to assist the reader to understand the relevance of the invention. However the background art is not intended and do not of themselves provide any admission by the applicant that they are published as may be required for an assessment of novelty or obviousness or are common general knowledge according to the laws of and in any particular country in the world. The current invention relates to hand held coffee tampers. In the coffee world, a tamper is used to compress coffee grounds in the coffee ground basket/filter of a coffee espresso machine. Compressing the coffee grounds in the basket/filter helps to create the required pressure to allow more of the oils from the ground coffee to enter the cup, providing the intense flavour of espresso. The preparation of espresso coffee involves running hot water through the compressed coffee grounds in order to deliver a desired serving of concentrated espresso coffee. It is well known in the art, the amount of compression of the coffee grounds to form a coffee cake influences the quality of the espresso produced. The compression of the coffee grounds in the coffee ground basket/filter to form the coffee cake is known as tamping, and is performed by devices known as tampers. Many expert espresso coffee makers or baristas use a simple hand held tamper. These tampers usually consist of a circular tamping base for compressing the coffee grounds, and a handle attached to the base for the operator to hold the tamper. The circular tamper base has a diameter slightly smaller than the internal diameter of the coffee ground basket/filter. Ideally the tamper fits snugly into coffee ground basket/filter so even the coffee grounds near the edge of the coffee ground basket/filter are also compressed. Good quality hand held tampers are usually made from a high quality steel, and have perpendicular sides of at least 2 to 3 mm to give the tamper suitable strength. A problem with existing tampers, is that when they fit snugly in the coffee ground basket/filter which is desirable, when the tamper is removed, a vacuum is created that can create cracks or damage the coffee cake in some other way. If the side of the tamper base is too thin then the tamper is often prone to be damaged from constant use. Thus at least one object of this invention is to provide a hand held coffee tamper that alleviates or reduces the problems found with current hand held tampers. SUMMARY OF INVENTION In one form of this invention although this need not be the only or indeed the broadest of this, there is provided a handheld coffee tamper having a circular tamper base, where said base has a side thickness of at least 2mm, and where said base is connected to a handle, characterised, in that the side wall of the circular tamper base is angled inwardly by at least 1 to 8 degrees from the vertical and where tamper base has a Rockwell hardness of at least 25, and where the tamper base edge that comes into contact with the coffee grounds has a radius of 0.01mm or less. By having the tamper base side slightly angled inwards, this allows the user to remove the tamper at a slight angle, allowing air to flow in and thus not creating a vacuum. There is no known tamper that uses a steel of this hardness or has a edge of this sharpness. However the inventors have found that it is desirable to have a tamper with a very sharp edge, and to have an edge of this sharpness and to have the tamper base sides slightly angled, it is preferable to have the tamper made from an exceptionally hard material. US design patent USD493338 discloses a hand held tamper where the tamper base is angled. This design appears to be entirely aesthetic and gives no indication to the material strength or edge sharpness. If this tamper was made with materials commonly used for tampers, it is not expected it would be sufficiently robust for use by professional baristas. The inventor has found that by making the tamper with a material that is much harder than found with current tampers, the design can be altered to make the tamper more robust but also more functional by having the tapered side walls and sharp edge. Preferably the tamper base is made from a stainless steel. Preferably the tamper base is made using 431 stainless steel and subjected to a hardening process to bring the Rockwell hardness of the stainless steel to a minimum 25. More preferably the tamper base has a Rockwell hardness of at least 40. More preferably the tamper base has a Rockwell hardness of at least 48. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION For a better understanding of the invention, further description will now be given, with reference to drawings in which: Figure 1 illustrates a detailed view of a barista base and figure 2 illustrates a nexus base. The figures show a tamper base having side walls (1) a sharp edge (2) where the sidewalls of the base are angled inwardly 1 to 8 degrees from the vertical (3). The tamper bases include a means for attaching a handle (4). The tamper handle is not shown.
