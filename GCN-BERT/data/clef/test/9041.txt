WO 03/095451 discloses the compound of formula (I), and further describes that this and other 10 compounds disclosed therein are stimulators of soluble guanylate cyclase, and may therefore be used as agents for the prophylaxis and/or treatment of cardiovascular disorders. WO 03/095451 describes the preparation of the compound of the formula (I). However, there are a number of disadvantages associated with the process disclosed in WO 03/095451, as discussed in WO 2011/064171. WO 2011/064171 thus discloses an alternative process for preparing a compound of the formula (I). In the process of WO 2011/064171, a compound of the formula (VI) is provided: The compound of the formula (VI) is reacted in a manner known per se, for example in accordance with one of the descriptions in WO 03/0945451 or ChemMedChem 2009, 4, 853-865, with a methylating agent Me-X to give a crude product which contains high amounts of the compound of the formula (I). The methylating agent Me-X used is methyl iodide, dimethyl sulphate, methyl toluenesulphonate, etc., and methyl iodide or dimethyl sulphate is preferred. The purification of the crude product of the formula (I) for use as pharmaceutically active compound is carried out via the compound methyl {4,6-diamino-2-[l-(2-fluorobenzyl)-lH-pyrazolo[3,4-b]pyridin-3-yl]pyrimidin-5-yl}methylcarbamate sulphinyldimethane (1:1), i.e. a compound of the formula (II) as isolated intermediate or generated in a mixture. For the purification, initially, a mixture is formed which contains high amounts of the compound of the formula (II) as intermediate, To this end, the crude product of the formula (I) is dissolved in DMSO (dimethylsulfoxide, sulphinyldimethane or (methylsulfinyl)methane which are different names for the same compound). To form a solution, the mixture is heated to 40-120°C, preferably 50-100°C. To form a pharmaceutically acceptable product of the formula (I), the solution has to be filtered, and the filtration is carried out hot, the temperatures are 40-120°C, preferably 50-100°C. After the filtration, a pharmaceutically acceptable solvent, preferably the same solvent as above, is added to the hot filtrate. This results in a crystallization of the product of the formula (II). Prior to the isolation of the solid which contains high amounts of the compound of the formula (II), to bring the precipitation to completion, the mixture is cooled to a temperature range of 0-35°C, preferably to an ambient temperature of, for example, 20-30°C. For pharmaceutical use, the DMSO has to be removed from the product of the formula (II) or the mixture comprising high amounts of the compound of the formula (II). To this end, the product of the formula (II) or the isolated mixture comprising high amounts of the product of the formula (II) is boiled in a pharmaceutically acceptable solvent from the class of the ketones, ethers, esters or alcohols. Examples of such solvents which may be mentioned are: methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, 1 -butanol, 2-butanol, ethyl acetate, isopropyl acetate or propyl acetate, butyl acetate, tert-butyl methyl ether, diisopropyl ether, acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone, etc. Preference is given to ethanol, isopropanol, ethyl acetate, isopropyl acetate, butyl acetate, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone. It is also possible to use mixtures of these solvents. Particular preference is given to ethyl acetate or a mixture of ethyl acetate with ethanol. Boiling takes place at reflux of the solvent in question or, if appropriate, at slightly elevated pressure. The temperature is 50-150°C, preferably 80-120°C. The solid obtained is then filtered. The present invention relates to new forms of methyl {4,6-diamino-2-[ 1 -(2-fluorobenzyl)-1Ηpyrazolo[3,4-b]pyridino-3 -yl]pyrimidino-5 -yl} methylcarbamate of formula (I).

Pharmaceutical compositions: This invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions containing one of the forms of the compound of the formula (I) or a mixture thereof. These compositions may be utilized to achieve the desired pharmacological effect by administration to a patient in need thereof. A patient, for the purpose of this invention, is a mammal, including a human, in need of treatment for the particular condition or disease. Therefore, the present invention includes pharmaceutical compositions which are comprised of a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and a pharmaceutically effective amount of one of the forms of the compound of the formula (I) or a mixture thereof. A pharmaceutically acceptable carrier is any carrier which is relatively non-toxic and innocuous to a patient at concentrations consistent with effective activity of the active ingredient so that any side effects ascribable to the carrier do not vitiate the beneficial effects of the active ingredient. A pharmaceutically effective amount of compound is that amount which produces a result or exerts an influence on the particular condition being treated. The forms of the compound of the formula (I) of the present invention can be administered with pharmaceutically-acceptable carriers well known in the art using any effective conventional dosage unit forms, including immediate, slow and timed release preparations, orally, parenterally, topically, nasally, ophthalmically, optically, sublingually, rectally, vaginally, and the like. For oral administration, the form of the compound of the formula (I) of the present invention can be formulated into solid or liquid preparations such as solid dispersion, capsules, pills, tablets, troches, lozenges, melts, powders, solutions, suspensions, or emulsions, and may be prepared according to methods known to the art for the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions. The solid unit dosage forms can be a capsule which can be of the ordinary hard- or soft-shelled gelatin type containing, for example, surfactants, lubricants, and inert fillers such as lactose, sucrose, calcium phosphate, and com starch. In another embodiment, the form of the compound of the formula (I) of the present invention may be tableted with conventional tablet bases such as lactose, sucrose and cornstarch in combination with binders such as acacia, com starch or gelatin, disintegrating agents intended to assist the break-up and dissolution of the tablet following administration such as potato starch, alginic acid, com starch, and guar gum, gum tragacanth, acacia, lubricants intended to improve the flow of tablet granulation and to prevent the adhesion of tablet material to the surfaces of the tablet dies and punches, for example talc, stearic acid, or magnesium, calcium or zinc stearate, dyes, coloring agents, and flavoring agents such as peppermint, oil of wintergreen, or cherry flavoring, intended to enhance the aesthetic qualities of the tablets and make them more acceptable to the patient. Suitable excipients for use in oral liquid dosage forms include dicalcium phosphate and diluents such as water and alcohols, for example, ethanol, benzyl alcohol, and polyethylene alcohols, either with or without the addition of a pharmaceutically acceptable surfactant, suspending agent or emulsifying agent. Various other materials may be present as coatings or to otherwise modify the physical form of the dosage unit. For instance tablets, pills or capsules may be coated with shellac, sugar or both. Dispersible powders and granules are suitable for the preparation of an aqueous suspension. They provide the active ingredient in admixture with a dispersing or wetting agent, a suspending agent and one or more preservatives. Suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents are exemplified by those already mentioned above. Additional excipients, for example those sweetening, flavoring and coloring agents described above, may also be present. The compositions of the invention can also contain other conventional pharmaceutically acceptable compounding ingredients, generally referred to as carriers or diluents, as necessary or desired. Conventional procedures for preparing such compositions in appropriate dosage forms can be utilized. Dosage of the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention: Based upon standard laboratory techniques known to evaluate compounds useful for the treatment of disorders, by standard pharmacological assays for the determination of treatment of the conditions identified above in mammals, and by comparison of these results with the results of known medicaments that are used to treat these conditions, the effective dosage of the compounds of this invention can readily be determined for treatment of each desired indication. The amount of the active ingredient to be administered in the treatment of one of these conditions can vary widely according to such considerations as the particular compound and dosage unit employed, the mode of administration, the period of treatment, the age and sex of the patient treated, and the nature and extent of the condition treated. The total amount of the active ingredient to be administered will generally range from about 0.0001 mg/kg to about 20 mg/kg, and preferably from about 0.001 mg/kg to about 2 mg/kg body weight per day. A unit dosage may contain from about 0.05 mg to about 150 mg of active ingredient, and can be administered one or more times per day. Of course the specific initial and continuing dosage regimen for each patient will vary according to the nature and severity of the condition as determined by the attending diagnostician, the activity of the specific compound employed, the age and general condition of the patient, time of administration, route of administration, rate of excretion of the drug, drug combinations, and the like. The desired mode of treatment and number of doses of a compound of the present invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or ester or composition thereof can be ascertained by those skilled in the art using conventional treatment tests. The weight data in the tests and examples which follow are, unless stated otherwise, percentages by weight; parts are parts by weight. Solvent ratios, dilution ratios and concentration data of liquid/liquid solutions are based on each case on the volume.
