Synthesis of 3-hydroxy-2-methyl-thiochromen-4-one (Compound 9)
275 mg 2-methylthiochroman-4-one (1.54 mmol) was solved in 2.2 ml MeOH and 2.8 ml EtOH in a Schleck tube with a septum under nitrogen. 625 µl Isoamylnitrite (4.6 mmol) was added and the mixture was cooled to 0°C. Under nitrogen 0.9 ml conc. HCl was added and the mixture was kept at 0°C for 10 min. The reaction was allowed to warm to room temperature and was kept at this for 1 h. Afterwards, the reaction was heated to reflux for 3h in which the color changed from yellow to red. After the reaction time, the mixture was poured in water and extracted with ether. The combined organic phases washed twice with Brine, dried with MgSO4, filtered and the solved evaporated leaving a red crystalline solid. The solid was dispersed in PE/EE 5:1, filtered of and washed with the same solvent mixture. The filtrated was collected and the solvent evaporated. The residual solid was dispersed in PE, filtered of and washed with PE. After drying under vacuum both solid fractions showed the clean product in NMR. The product was obtained as a red crystalline solid (m = 120 mg, 40.5 %). Rf = 0.46 (PE/EE 5:1).
