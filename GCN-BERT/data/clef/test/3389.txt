FIELD OF INVENTION The present disclosure relates to the field of vanadium oxide materials, more specifically to sol-gel methods to prepare nanostructured, nanoporous vanadium oxide materials which, illustratively, may have applications in electronics, optoelectronics, energy storage, and lightweight structural materials. BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF INVENTION Vanadium oxides have garnered attention for their optical, electronic, and catalytic properties as well as high-performance Li-intercalation cathode materials. Vanadium (V) oxide gels are typically synthesized in aqueous environments via acidification of vanadate salts or peroxide-assisted polymerization of bulk V2O5. Mixed-valent vanadium (IV,V) oxide gels have been synthesized via controlled hydrolysis of vanadium alkoxides in organic solvents. Whereas vanadium alkoxides are relatively expensive, epoxide-assisted gelation provides an economical alternative to metal alkoxide hydrolysis, which has been shown effective for a large number of transition metal oxides. However, vanadium oxides are conspicuously absent from this group. Accordingly, there is a need to provide a robust and inexpensive method for producing vanadium oxides through a sol-gel method employing inexpensive starting materials; herein is described such a method, wherein vanadium halides are employed. Also needed are polymeric aerogels having sufficient strength and structural integrity without the need for post-gelation treatment, and efficient methods for their production from readily available starting materials. These needs are addressed in the present disclosure. The sol-gel method, which commonly involves the hydrolysis of metal alkoxides, is well known to be a versatile synthesis for the fabrication of high-quality metal oxide films, nanostructured powders, and low-density aerogel monoliths. It has been reported that epoxide-assisted gelation is an often desirable alternative to alkoxide hydrolysis, but has been heretofore unrealized for vanadium oxides. Aqueous vanadium oxide sol-gel chemistry is well-studied and is well-known to serve as the basis on which all vanadia sol-gel chemistry is modeled. While several distinct methods exist for aqueous gelation, it is believed that the first step in all of these methods is the formation of a supersaturated solution of vanadium oxy-hydrates. It is known that this first step can be accomplished using a variety of methods, e.g., quenching molten V2O5 in H2O (oxide hydrolysis); the decomposition of soluble vanadium oxy-peroxide hydrates, such as VO(O2)(H2O)3+, VO(O2)2(H2O)2−, and the like (peroxide-assisted hydrolysis); or passing a water-soluble vanadate salt such as NaVO3 through a proton-exchange column (cation-exchange). These hydrates are believed to speciate as a variety of acidic vanadates with varying degrees of hydration, e.g., VO(OH)3(H2O)2, V10O286−, V6O162−, etc., dependent upon both pH and concentration. The strong anisotropy of the polymerizable, neutral monomeric vanadyl trihydroxy-dihydrate is believed to lead to the formation of vanadyl oxo-polymer chains which aggregate, leading to fibrous gels. This morphology has been reported to be markedly dissimilar from common inorganic gels, which are typified by random aggregates of spherical particles. Variations on these techniques also exist which utilize templating agents to modify gel morphology. To date, aqueous syntheses have only been shown capable of producing V2O5 gels, and related VV gels such as Na2xV2O5+x. Non-aqueous methods have been reported, however, for the production of vanadium oxide (VOx) gels with a lower oxidation state. Hydrolysis of organic vanadium species in non-aqueous solvents has been reported to produce high quality VOx films and monoliths; e.g., VO2 films have reportedly been made from the hydrolysis of vanadyl(IV) acetoacetonate in methanol. While organic VV species have been reported to undergo hydrolysis to form oxide gels, partial VV(yellow/red)→VIV(blue/brown) reduction is believed to be nearly universal, presumably due to the requisite organic solvent, resulting in gels with varying degrees of VIV content. The most commonly reported method for fabricating non-aqueous VOx gels is the hydrolysis of vanadyl(V) alkoxides in a water-miscible solvent, e.g., vanadium oxytripropoxide in acetone. Gelation seems to occur extremely rapidly, to be highly exothermic, and to result in light green, highly porous solids. Some alkoxide-derived gels have also been reported to have a unique nanoworm morphology intermediate between the random spherical aggregates commonly seen in metal oxide gels and the monofilament fibers typical of aqueous vanadia gels. While the gelation mechanism is well-studied for aqueous V2O5 gels, the speciation and oxo-polymer formation mechanisms in non-aqueous VOx gels are less well-studied; this is believed to be due in part to the increased complexity of the system. Epoxide-assisted gelation has been reported to be effective for a wide range of metal oxides. In this method, it is reported that an epoxide, such as propylene oxide (PPO) or epichlorohydrin (ECH), reacts with an acidic hydrated metal salt, such as a chloride or nitrate, undergoing H+-catalyzed irreversible ring-opening by the nucleophilic anions, forming the corresponding alcohol (see Equation 1 below). Epoxide ring-opening gradually raises the pH of the solution by scavenging protons from the acidic metal hydrate, decreasing metal hydrate solubility, leading to uniform supersaturation, followed by olation, oxolation, and dehydration, creating percolating metal oxide networks, i.e., gels. Without being bound by theory, in situ pH measurements on iron(III) and chrome(III) oxide aerogels made from their chlorides and PPO have reportedly been used to support this mechanism. Equation 1 below shows the steps that are believed to be involved in the epoxide-assisted gelation of metal(III) oxides, e.g., those of Fe, Cr, Al. Typically X═Cl, NO3, and the like, and R═H, Cl, OH, and the like. It is believed that the primary advantage of epoxide-assisted gelation is the drastic reduction in reagent cost. Aside from a few examples, e.g., Si, Ti, and Al, metal alkoxides are either prohibitively expensive or commercially unavailable, whereas their salts, such as, illustratively, their chlorides and nitrates, are comparatively inexpensive. PPO and ECH are inexpensive epoxides and have sufficiently different reactivities so as to provide useful control over gelation rates. In addition, metal salts are much less H2O-sensitive than their alkoxide counterparts, greatly improving ease of handling. Though this method has been successfully used to synthesize aerogels for a large number of metal oxide systems, application toward epoxide-assisted vanadia has remained elusive. In one embodiment, described herein is a synthetic preparation of vanadium oxides via a low cost, sol-gel, epoxide-assisted gelation of a vanadium halide of the formula VOX3. In one aspect, the vanadium oxides prepared as described herein are nanostructured; in another aspect, they are nanoporous. Illustrative of the vanadium halide of formula VOX3 are compounds wherein X═F, Cl, Br, or I. In one aspect, the epoxide is a relatively inexpensive compound such as PPO, ECH, and the like. Without being bound by theory, the synthesis demonstrated herein may be empirically summarized as forming a vanadium alkoxide in situ, as shown in the illustrative equation 2 below, wherein, by way of example, the vanadium halide is vanadium oxytrichloride (VOCl3) and the epoxide is ECH. Without being bound by theory, it is believed that the vanadium alkoxide thus formed possesses similar reactivity to commonly-used, commercially-available alkoxides. The typical reagent costs given in Table 1 below illustrate the comparatively low cost of the epoxide-assisted gelation described herein as compared with methods involving commonly used vanadium alkoxides. TABLE 1 A comparison of the cost of commonly used vanadium alkoxides and illustrative reagents used herein for epoxide-assisted gelation. Cost Cost Reagent ($/mol) ($/g V2O5) Purity VO(OiPr)3 3247.86 35.71 — VO(OPr)3 835.18 9.18 98% VOCl3 81.97 0.90 99% ECH 3.14 0.10 ≧99% In another embodiment, described herein is a method for the formation of VOx aerogels via epoxide-assisted gelation. The formation of VOx aerogels is demonstrated herein by using VOCl3 and ECH, resulting in gels which replicate the physical properties of VOx gels fabricated via hydrolysis of vanadium oxytripropoxide, including physical properties such as high surface area, macroporosity, a unique nanoworm morphology, and the ability to form high-strength composite aerogels via isocyanate crosslinking. In addition, several synthetic features unique to this method are observed in the method described herein, including the following: H+-free epoxide ring-opening, and discreet multi-step gelation. In another embodiment, the present invention provides a sol-gel method to prepare nanostructured, nanoporous vanadium oxides from inexpensive vanadium halides. Accordingly, described herein is a synthetic method for preparation of vanadium (IV,V) mixed oxide gels, wherein the method employs epoxide-assisted gelation of VOCl3. The resulting aerogels are robust and possess similar morphology and reactivity to gels fabricated from vanadium alkoxides. In another embodiment, the methods described herein for preparing vanadium oxides provide >10-fold reduction in cost of reagents, in comparison to previous technologies. In one aspect, they replace expensive vanadium alkoxides with inexpensive vanadium halides. The methods described herein are especially suited for preparing porous monolithic structures, and are easily adaptable to films, wherein they replace relatively complex physical and chemical vapor deposition techniques with spin and dip coating typically amenable to sol-gel chemistry. These gels also possess the potential for conversion to nanostructured, porous, hard, refractory materials, such as, illustratively, vanadium nitride and vanadium carbide. One key aspect of the invention herein is that it replaces expensive organic vanadium precursors with cheap inorganic precursors that are either readily available or easily made on site. In addition, the gels produced as described herein are more robust during manufacture than those using previous methods. In another aspect, the gels produced as described herein can be made in a wider variety of densities, up to a factor of 10 lower than the densities obtained by other methods. Films made using the method herein can be made using spin and dip coating techniques, which are much simpler and more economical than commonly used physical and chemical vapor deposition methods. Introducing dopants into sol-gel films is known to be a simple process, whereas it has been reported that doping in vapor deposition methods can be difficult or impossible. In another embodiment, the VOx gels herein may optionally be subjected to crosslinking conditions in bifunctional isocyanate solutions, as is typical for metal oxide gels. The resulting aerogels have noticeably increased density and strength. In one aspect, when crosslinked with aromatic isocyanates and pyrolyzed under NH3, the gels undergo nitridation. VN aerogels formed this way undergo significant shrinkage, but maintain their monolithic structure. The vanadium oxides produced by the methods described herein find utility in numerous applications, illustratively: in energy storage, e.g., in Li-intercalation for high performance batteries; as strong lightweight structural materials, e.g., for ballistic armor; in porous refractory materials, e.g., for rocket nosecones; in energy efficient window glazing, e.g., doped VO2; and in various optical, electronic and optoelectronic applications, such as, illustratively, in applications that take advantage of the metal-to-insulator transition in many of the vanadium oxides.

The following examples are provided for the purpose of illustration only, and it is to be understood that they are not intended to be limiting, but that other modifications that are known to those skilled in the art, and that are within the scope and spirit of the disclosure herein, may be used as well. EXAMPLES All chemicals were used as received from commercial sources without further purification. Example 1 Exemplary Monolith Synthesis 0.180 mL (1.9 mmol) VOCl3 is dissolved in 1 mL ethanol in a 20 mL scintillation vial. In a separate vial, 0.744 mL (9.5 mmol) epichlorohydrin and 0.411 mL (22.8 mmol) H2O are dissolved in 1 mL ethanol. Both solutions are cooled to 0° C. Solutions are poured together and swirled to mix before pouring into the desired molds. The gel formed is allowed to age at room temperature for 5 days before washing. Gels are washed via submersion in acetone baths >4 times gel volume for 8 hours. This is repeated three times. Gels are dried in a supercritical CO2 dryer. Variations on this procedure to affect gelation time and morphology include modifying reagent concentrations (for example, 0.090 mL VOCl3 to 0.0090 mL VOCl3 per mL ethanol), ratios (for example, epoxide and H2O to VOCl3 molar ratios from 3 to 50 and 6 to 200, respectively), and chemical identities (for example, alternative epoxides or alternative vanadium salts); temperature (for example, −78° C. to 25° C.); post-gelation aging time (for example, 1 day to 14 days); and solvent (for example, methanol, isopropanol, dimethylformamide, and the like). Between the washing and drying steps, crosslinking via submersion in an isocyanate solution can produce mechanically strong, lightweight materials. Use of a weak acid scavenging cyclic ether, for example, tetrahydrofuran, and the like, results in a stable sol appropriate for film fabrication. Example 2 Exemplary Film Synthesis 0.180 mL (1.9 mmol) VOCl3 is dissolved in 2 mL ethanol in a 20 mL scintillation vial to which is added 0.770 mL (9.5 mmol) tetrahydrofuran and 0.411 mL (22.8 mmol) H2O. This solution is aged at room temperature for 4 days before deposition onto a 25.4 mm diameter quartz substrate via spin coating. The film is then dried in a 70° C. oven for 15 minutes to affect complete hydrolysis and densification. Example 3 Alternative Exemplary Film Synthesis The film may be made by spin coating a sol containing VOCl3 (0.180 mL, 1.90 mmol) and epichlorohydrin (0.744 mL, 9.50 mmol) in ethanol (2 mL). This solution is identical to that used to make aerogels, but without H2O. Precursor solution undergoes partial hydrolysis from ambient moisture to form soft films. These are then dried in air (150° C., 20 min) and annealed under dry N2 (400° C., 2 hr) to form hard, high-quality films. This procedure most closely follows the literature procedure of Guzman et al. (“Synthesis of vanadium dioxide thin films from vanadium alkoxides,” Materials Research Bulletin 1994, 29, 509-515), but replaces expensive vanadium alkoxide precursors with the vanadium chloride and epichlorohydrin to produce an in-situ alkoxide for hydrolysis at approximately one-tenth of the cost. The annealed films appear visually identical (FIG. 1) and possess the appropriate crystalline morphology as determined by XRD (FIG. 2) for thermochromism as seen by Guzman. The XRD pattern matches that of monoclinic VO2, and may be expected to be thermochromic. The SEM images show that these films are exceedingly and uniformly smooth (FIG. 3), homogeneous, and of uniform thickness of ca. 150 nm (FIG. 4); they appear to be dense and polycrystalline with small grains. These are similar to the films of Guzman and superior to films made using other methods. These VO2 films are also produced without the need for a reducing atmosphere, as used by Guzman, and at a slightly lower temperature. The sporadic aberrations (spherical particle) in FIG. 3 may possibly be attributed to dust present during spin coating or annealing. Physical deposition methods for films including CVD, APCVD, RF sputtering, etc., are known to be much more complicated than their sol-gel counterparts and require specialized equipment. Sol-gel methods can be used to deposit films in a number of simple ways, including spin coating, dip coating, and drop casting. Additionally, doping films to change (lower) the metal-to-insulator transition, e.g., for thermochromic window coatings, is known to be exceedingly easy, unlike physical deposition methods. VO2 films are also commonly fabricated using the sol-gel method via hydrolysis of vanadyl acetylacetonate (VO(acac)2), which is a VIV reagent, and consequently is known to be more expensive. The sol-gel chemistry involved makes gels amenable to doping with various soluble metal salts to affect final composition and material properties. Annealing dry gels in a furnace under various atmospheres including, but not limited to, Ar, N2, O2, H2, vacuum, and NH3 are known to controllably affect the composition of the material, allowing the formation of various vanadium oxides, vanadium nitride, and vanadium carbide. One main advantage to using the inventive method described herein over the alkoxide method is cost. The precursor solution for the alkoxide method is very stable in the absence of H2O and can tolerate small amounts of H2O without significant decomposition, whereas the traditional alkoxide solutions are known to be extremely intolerant of H2O. Example 4 Aerogel and Xerogel Synthesis Materials. All chemicals were used as received without further purification unless otherwise noted, including VOCl3, epichlorohydrin (ECH), absolute ethanol (EtOH), HPLC-grade acetone, HPLC-grade ethyl acetate (EtOAc), 95-98% H2SO4, KMnO4, sodium oxalate, deionized (DI) water. Desmodur N3200A (oligomeric hexamethylene diisocyanate) and Desmodur RE (27% by weight tris(p-isocyanatophenyl)methane (TIPM) in EtOAc) were obtained from Bayer Corporation. In a typical synthesis, 0.540 mL (5.7 mmol) VOCl3 was dissolved in 3.0 mL EtOH. The resultant deep red solution (A) was cooled to 0° C. in an ice bath. In a separate vessel, 2.25 mL (28.7 mmol) ECH and 0.925 mL (51.3 mmol) H2O was dissolved in 3.0 mL EtOH cooled to 0° C. The resultant solution (B) was cooled to 0° C. in an ice bath. Solutions A and B were mixed vigorously, and poured into 10 mL cylindrical polypropylene molds, forming a deep red, non-scattering gel in a matter of seconds. Wet-gels were allowed to age for 5 days, becoming dark green in the process. The gels were then placed in an acetone bath of at least 4 times their total volume to remove unreacted starting reagents. The bath was replaced with fresh acetone every 8 hours until the gels had undergone 4 washes. Xerogels were formed by drying washed wet-gels under vacuum at 50° C. Aerogels were formed by drying gels in a Spe-ed SFE supercritical fluid CO2 dryer from Applied Separations. Gels dried by these methods are referred to as xero-VOx and aero-VOx respectively. The gels undergo crosslinking in bifunctional isocyanate solutions, as is typical for metal oxide gels. The resulting aerogels have noticeably increased density and strength. When crosslinked with aromatic isocyanates and pyrolyzed under NH3, the gels undergo nitridation (confirmed by XRD), another common occurrence in nanoporous metal oxides. VN aerogels formed this way undergo significant shrinkage, but maintain their monolithic structure. Thus, crosslinked gels (X—VOx) were obtained by replacing the fourth acetone wash with a solution of 11.0 g Desmodur N3200A in 94 mL acetone. The gels were aged for 1.5 days at room temperature followed by 3 days at 55° C. The gels were then cooled to room temperature and washed in acetone baths followed by drying as previously noted. VN gels were prepared by replacing the third gel wash with EtOAc, followed by crosslinking with a solution of 41.0 g Desmodur RE in 61 mL EtOAc. Gels were then washed in acetone baths until baths were clear. Gels were supercritically dried and pyrolyzed under NH3 at 800° C. Example 5 Material Characterization. Unless otherwise mentioned, all gels were characterized in powdered form. Native VOx and VN powders were prepared by grinding dried gels in a mortar and pestle. X—VOx powders were prepared by breaking monoliths into chunks using a mortar and pestle followed by pulverizing gels in a SPEX SamplePrep 8000D ball mill using ½ in. stainless steel ball bearings. Example 6 Chemical Analysis Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out under He and O2 atmospheres on a TA Instrument, model Q50. The temperature was raised from room temperature to 700° C. at 5° C./min. Tandem thermogravimetric analysis-mass spectrometry (TGA-MS) was performed from room temperature to 700° C. at 10° C./min under flowing Ar. Total vanadium content was determined using an inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS). Samples were prepared by digesting VOx in aqueous HNO3. C and H content was determined using a PerkinElmer CHN/O Analyzer. VIV content was determined via redox titration. 25.00 mg VOx was dissolved in 0.1 mL 95-98% H2SO4 and 10 mL H2O. The green VOx solution was titrated with 2.2 mM aqueous KMnO4 with heating and stirring. KMnO4 was standardized against acidified aqueous sodium oxalate. Example 7 Electron Microscopy Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed on aerogel cross-sections on a Hitachi S-4700 field emission microscope. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and electron diffraction were performed on a Tecnai F20 STEM. Example 8 X-Ray Diffraction X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed on a PANalytical X'Pert Pro Multi-Purpose Diffractometer with a Cu Kα radiation source (λ=1.54 Å). Example 9 Porosity N2 porosimetry was performed on an ASAP 2020 surface area and porosity analyzer. Surface area (a) was determined by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method from the N2 adsorption isotherm. Bulk aerogel densities were calculated from monolith weight and dimensions. Example 10 UV-Vis Absorption Spectroscopy UV-Vis absorption spectra was collected using an Ocean Optics Chem 2000 UV-Vis with a Deuterium-Tungsten lamp. 20-30 m path-length soda-lime cuvettes were fabricated in-house. Solutions A and B were thoroughly mixed and immediately transferred to cuvettes before gelation. Cuvettes were sealed with Parafilm to prevent solvent evaporation and monitored for 48 hours. Example 11 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Mesophase 13C (100.6 MHz) and 51V (105.2 MHz) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were collected on a 400 MHz Varian Unity INOVA spectrometer. Solutions A and B were thoroughly mixed and transferred to a 5 mm NMR tube and allowed to gel. The tube was sealed with PTFE tape to prevent solvent loss and allowed to age. Example 12 Results X—VOx gels are very tough, requiring extensive grinding in a ball mill to reduce samples to powder form. Native VOx gels were fragile by comparison, but are sufficiently strong to survive gentle handling without fracture before and after drying. SEM shows an aerogel nanomorphology consistent with that obtained from hydrolysis of VO(OCH2CH2CH3)3 in acetone (FIG. 5). TEM shows small, crystalline, approximately spherical particles embedded in an amorphous matrix (FIG. 6). XRD confirms that as-synthesized gels are amorphous, with a characteristic layer spacing typical of amorphous vanadium oxides. The nanomorphology of gels synthesized via the epoxide-synthesized gelation herein is consistent with that of gels previously reported to have been made from hydrolysis of VO(OCH2CH2CH3)3. This is in contrast to uniform fibrous V2O5 typically seen from aqueous synthesis or low-valent vanadium oxide materials synthesized via hydrothermal reduction. TEM indicates that the product is largely amorphous and studded with crystalline particles. The electron diffraction pattern supports this: a sample composed of small crystalline particles will exhibit diffraction rings, while large particles would exhibit a single-crystal-like diffraction pattern. Additionally, this is reinforced by the x-ray diffraction patterns of VOx samples which has only broad, shallow peaks. Density, surface area, and porosity data for gels is shown in Table A. Bulk density of xerogels could not be obtained due to the irregular shapes of dried monoliths. TABLE A Microstructural and density data for VOx samples. Bulk Density Skeletal BET Surface Sample (g/mL) Density (g/mL) Area (m2/g) Porosity Xero-VOx — 2.67 0.31 — Aero-VOx 0.103 3.30 102.0 96.9% Aero-X-VOx 0.412 1.32 81.9 68.8% The total vanadium content determined via TGA (ICP-MS) under O2 is 7.98 mmol/g. VIV content determined via permanganometry is 5.52 mmol/g. These results are summarized in Table B. TABLE B Concentration of vanadium calculated from various methods and the resulting average oxidation state. Total V V (4+) V (5+) Average Method (mmol/g) (mmol/g) (mmol/g) Oxidation State Permanganometry — 5.52 — — TGA 7.98 — — 4.31 ICP-MS 8.27 — — 4.33 TGA under He indicates two prominent losses of ca. 14% (by mass) up to 200° C. and an additional ca. 15% up to 300° C. as seen in FIG. 7. Elemental analysis indicates that VOx contains 4.4% C and 1.7% H by weight. An additional mass loss can be seen between 300 and 400° C. Without being bound by theory, it is possible that mass gain above 400° C. may be due to residual O2 or H2O in balance gas that leaked into sample chamber. “Bump” in data near 700° C. may possibly correspond to a switch in flow gas from He to O2. Gelation takes effect in under 10 seconds, forming a red, optically non-scattering solid. The gels then undergo a color change, forming a dark green product as seen in FIG. 8. This color change was monitored via UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy. Spectra of initial red species and final green species are shown in FIG. 8. 13C mesophase NMR spectra collected immediately after gelation and after 3 days aging are shown in FIG. 9. Using commercially available standards, EtOH, Epichlorohydrin, and 1,3-dichloro-2-propanol are readily identified in FIG. 9. 3-Chloro-1,2-propanediol was also identified in aged gels, but the low concentration of the species makes it less obvious. The additional species developed during aging was identified via GC-MS as 1-chloro-3-ethoxy-2-propanol. Vanadium species have been reported to undergo reduction in acidic environments in the presence of suitable organic species, but the presence of the acid-scavenging epoxide ensures that the environment is neutral. 51V mesophase NMR spectra collected immediately after gelation and after 3 days aging are shown in FIG. 10. A large number of vanadium intermediates can be seen in these 51V mesophase NMR spectra, and that the concentration of these intermediates changes during aging. Without being bound by theory, it is possible that precipitation of soluble compounds and reduction of VV to paramagnetic VIV species may represent the two mechanisms for loss. Example 13 Additional Observations N2 sorption isotherms indicate that the aerogels are macroporous with a moderate surface area relative to other aerogel materials. Xerogel surface area was too low to measure accurately. Conformal polymer coating of the aerogel microstructure leads to a decrease in surface area and porosity. This decrease in porosity may have been aided during pulverization, due to the plastic nature of crosslinked gels. Other methods of grinding the gels that would not collapse the microstructure were frustrated by the gels' toughness and plasticity; even inducing brittleness with cryogenic temperatures is ineffective, as it has been reported elsewhere that X—VOx gels retain their plasticity under cryogenic conditions. Previously, VOx gels obtained via hydrolysis of VO(CH2CH2CH3)3 were said to be amorphous H2V3O8; however, the average oxidation state determined for the material synthesized via epoxide-assisted gelation suggests that it is not a stoichiometric mixed oxide. The C and H content of the gels can be best ascribed to 21.9% CO32− and 15.2% H2O, respectively. These species would give rise to mass loses of 16.1% (CO2) and 15.2% (H2O), which are consistent with that seen in TGA. Ascribing carbonaceous content to ethoxy or acetate species could only account for 14% or 20% total mass loss, rendering these possibilities unlikely. TGA-MS confirms dehydration below 200° C. and carbonate decomposition through CO2 loss below 300° C. The observation that the gelation takes place in such a short period of time leads to great difficulty in monitoring the gelation process. The gel color change attributed to VV-VIV reduction takes place on the timescale of hours and can be monitored by various methods. The predicted levels for organic oxidation products is below the level of detection in 13C NMR under the conditions available. Acetaldehyde can be identified in the vapor by its distinctive smell (like apples), but remains elusive in GC-MS. Small amounts of other species can also be seen in GC-MS, which, without being bound by theory, are tentatively ascribed to oxidized chlorinated alcohols formed during gelation and aging. ADDITIONAL EXAMPLES Example 14 Aerogel and Xerogel Fabrication The synthesis of VOx and isocyanate crosslinked (X—VOx) aerogels and xerogels is summarized in FIG. 11. A typical gel was fabricated as follows: 0.540 mL (5.71 mmol) VOCl3 (99%, Strem Chemicals) was dissolved in 3 mL absolute ethanol (EtOH) (200 proof, LyondellBasell) and cooled to 0° C. in an ice bath. In a separate container, 2.25 mL (28.6 mmol) ECH (99%, Acros Organics) and 0.925 mL (51.4) deionized H2O was dissolved in 3 mL EtOH and cooled to 0° C. in an ice bath. The two solutions were mixed and swirled vigorously before immediately pouring into syringe molds. Within 10 seconds, solid red gels formed, which were aged for 5 days at ambient temperature before washing. PPO (≧99%, Sigma-Aldrich), glycidol (GLY) (96%, Acros), and dimethyloxetane (DMO) (98%, Sigma-Aldrich) were substituted for ECH in some cases to investigate their effects on gelation rate. Washing and isocyanate crosslinking procedures were followed according to those previously reported in literature. Gels were washed 4 times in acetone (Technical Grade, Univar) baths. Xerogels were formed by drying washed gels ambiently for several days followed by placing samples under vacuum for 6 hr at 50° C. to remove residual solvent. Aerogels were formed by drying washed gels in a Spe-ed SFE supercritical fluid CO2 dryer from Applied Separations. Mechanically-strong X—VOx aerogels were formed using a solution of 5.5 g Desmodur N3200A (Bayer) in 94 mL dry acetone (CHROMASOLV for HPLC, Sigma-Aldrich), followed by washing in acetone and supercritical CO2 drying. Mesophase 13C (100 MHz) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) was performed on wet gels using a Varian Unity Inova with 1H (400 MHz) decoupling. No nuclear Overhauser enhancement was utilized in order to maintain quantitative 13C signal intensity. The terminal CH3 on EtOH (18.3 ppm vs. tetramethylsilane (TMS)) was used as an internal reference. 1H (400 MHz) NMR was used to characterize VOCl3 solutions in CCl4 and EtOH with various amounts of ECH, to analyze VV chelates which form prior to gelation. These solutions were made by dissolving 0.090 mL VOCl3 in 1 mL of the appropriate solvent (CCl4 or EtOH) to which was added stoichiometric amounts of ECH and/or EtOH. The terminal CH3 on EtOH (1.21 ppm vs. TMS) and the high-field proton on ECH (2.70 vs. TMS in 1H) were used as internal references. Example 15 VO2 Film Fabrication A precursor solution was prepared by omitting H2O from a typical gel sol, i.e., 0.180 mL VOCl3 and 0.750 mL ECH in 2 mL EtOH. Amorphous VOx films were formed by spin coating the precursor solution onto 1-in diameter quartz or 1 cm square n-doped silicon substrates (Ted Pella), utilizing ambient moisture to affect hydrolysis. Films were dried in a 150° C. oven in air for 10 min. Films were then annealed under dry N2 at 400° C. for 2 hr to form crystalline monoclinic VO2. Example 16 Materials Characterization Bulk gel densities (ρb) were determined from sample mass and dimensions. Skeletal densities (ρs) were determined via He pycnometry using a Micromeritics AccuPyc II 1340. N2 sorption porosimetry was carried out on a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 surface area and porosity analyzer using monoliths broken into small chunks. Specific surface area (σm) was determined using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method, and the pore size distribution was determined using the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method. Prior to pycnometry and porosimetry measurements, samples were outgassed for 24 hr at 40° C. under vacuum. Gel and film nanomorphology was analyzed using cross-sections mounted in a Hitachi S-4700 scanning electron microscope (SEM). Monoliths were ground to a fine powder using a mortar and pestle before performing powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) with a PANalytical X'Pert Pro Multi-Purpose Diffractometer, attached Cu Kα (λ=1.54 Å) radiation source. Ground powders were dispersed in acetone and deposited onto a silky-carbon-coated Cu grid for transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and electron diffraction (ED) on a Technai F20 STEM. Tandem thermogravimetric analysis-mass spectrometry (TGA-MS) was carried out on a Netzsch STA 409 C thermogravimetric analyzer connected via a fused silica capillary to a QMS 403 C mass spectrometer under air at a heating rate of 5° C./min. Ion currents were monitored for 15<m/z<300. Signals were normalized by carrier gas ion current (N2, m/z=28) and sample mass for comparison between runs. Only signals for m/z=18 and m/z=44 were detectable above background (See FIG. 12). Referring to FIG. 12, raw MS signals between m/z=15 and m/z=300 are above the detection limit (ca. 10−10 A). While TGA was performed under flowing N2, MS (and the presence of oxidation in TGA) shows clear evidence of a significant air leak, effectively rendering the TGA atmosphere equivalent to air. All identified signals are listed and identified in order of intensity at right, with isotopes labeled where more than one is observed. The ratios of the species are consistent with both typical concentrations in air and natural isotopic abundancies. For TGA-MS analysis, signals due to air were removed by subtracting the m/z=36 signal multiplied by the final measured ratio between each species. Only m/z=18, H2O, (blue) and m/z=44, CO2, (red) show any significant deviation from the air background. These signals were normalized by sample mass and m/z=28 ion current, to account for variations in carrier gas flow. Latency between TGA and MS signals was determined to be 6 min by matching maxima in the mass-loss derivatives to maxima in the H2O and CO2 ion currents. Example 17 Gelation Gelation is highly exothermic and extremely rapid (<10 sec), resulting in bright red, glassy monoliths. Cooling the precursor sol to −48° C. in a Dry Ice-acetone bath prevented gelation (maintained fluidity for 10 min in bath), but upon removal from the cooling bath, i.e., to pour into molds, exothermic runaway caused gelation in under a minute. Referring to FIG. 13, UV-Vis absorption spectra of standard epoxide gel during aging are shown. Short-path-length (20-30 μm) soda-lime glass cuvettes were fabricated to limit absorption and sealed with Parafilm after filling with mixed precursor sol. No significant changes to absorption were detected after ca. 16 hr. Gels become dark green after several hours of aging, losing translucency due to high absorption. Without being bound by theory, the color change is attributed to the partial reduction of red hydrated VV to deep blue VIV common in nonaqueous VOx gels. Acetaldehyde, as an oxidative product of EtOH, is thought to be the primary organic oxidation product, detectable by its distinctive scent (sour apples) readily apparent in unwashed wet gels. Gels underwent minimal (clear) syneresis, and all acetone washes were colorless. No measurable shrinkage was observed during aging or supercritical drying. Example 18 H2O and Epoxide Optimization Precursor sol compositions along with corresponding gelation rate and gel quality are summarized in Table 2. TABLE 2 Results of H2O optimization and investigation of alternative cyclic ethers. VOCl3 Epoxide H2O (eq.) (eq.) (eq.) Gelation Time Gel Quality 1 5 (ECH) 6 ~10 s Turbid Standard 1 5 (ECH) 9 <10 s Glassy Formulation (0.540 mL) (2.25 mL) (0.925 mL) (6 mL EtOH) (5.71 mmol) (28.6 mmol) (51.4 mmol) 1 1 5 (ECH) 5 (ECH) 12 20 <10 s <3 s Glassy Inhomogeneous 1 5 (PPO) 9 Instantaneous Inhomogeneous 1 5 (GLY) 15 15 min Glassy, Fragile 1 5 (DMO) 12 10 min Very Turbid H2O content in the standard gel formulation was optimized to lengthen gelation time while maintaining optical quality (homogeneity). Increasing the H2O:VOCl3 ratio was found to increase the gelation rate, at the extreme of which (20:1) gelation occurred faster than the mixing of the precursor solutions, resulting in macroscopically inhomogeneous gels. Lowering the ratio (6:1) was found to produce turbid gels (microscopic inhomogeneity). It was also necessary to add ECH and H2O to the VOCl3 solution simultaneously, as adding them sequentially in either order produced macroscopically inhomogeneous gels. It has been observed that modifying epoxide functionality at the a position and utilizing less-strained 1,3-epoxides can alter gelation rate. Several commercially available alternatives were investigated, as a slower gelation rate would improve ease of fabrication. Replacing ECH with PPO significantly increased the gelation rate, leading to instantaneous gelation and the formation of inhomogeneous solid droplets. GLY significantly slowed gelation (15 min), but the resulting gels were extremely fragile and crumbled even without handling during washing. GLY gels also exhibited both colored syneresis liquid and washes, which may be attributed to improved vanadium oxide chelation in polyols formed from glycidol ring opening. DMO significantly slowed gelation and gels remained robust, though entirely opaque. The opacity in these gels may be ascribed to phase separation of the neopentanol formed from ring opening, leading to microscopic inhomogeneities and scattering. Example 19 Mesophase 13C NMR While gelation occurs too quickly to monitor, gel aging can be monitored via in situ mesophase NMR to identify organic reaction products and their formation rates. All major organic species in the gel effluent were identified (FIG. 14A). No redox products were detected via 13C or 1H NMR due to their low concentration and the unavoidably large peak width caused by anisotropic susceptibility broadening (ASB). The spectra confirm that Cl− scavenging occurs through nucleophilic attack on the less-substituted carbon of the epoxide ring, as is typically observed in epoxide-assisted gelation, forming 1,3-dichloro-2-propanol (DCP). DCP peak areas were constant throughout aging, indicating that Cl− scavenging occurred before the first spectrum could be collected (5-15 min after gelation). Over the course of aging, excess ECH underwent nucleophilic attack by H2O and EtOH, forming 1-chloro-2,3-propane diol (MCPD) and 1-chloro-(ethoxy)propanol (MCEP), respectively. This experiment is unable to discern the ring-opening mechanism in these cases: attack on either epoxy carbon by H2O results in identical products and the 2-ethoxy-3-ol and 3-ethoxy-2-ol have nearly identical 13C and 1H chemical shifts. Time-dependant concentrations of ECH and its ring-opened products follow exponential behavior (see FIG. 15), which may be taken as indicating that ring-opening follows ECH-limited first-order reaction kinetics. Referring to FIG. 15, the concentration (C) of ECH (red), MCPD (orange), MCEP (blue) and their Sum (black) as a function of time (t) as monitored by 13C NMR are shown. Individual peak intensities (open circles) were averaged (filled squares) to determine the concentration of each species. All intensities were normalized to the time-averaged Sum to determine relative concentration. Data was independently fitted to an exponential decay (shown in the table of FIG. 15). Noting that each of the time constants (τ) was similar-excepting the Sum for which τ≈∞—this parameter was constrained to be shared and the data was refit. The fits (solid line) are excellent (R2=0.994) and physically consistent: the sum of the fitted concentrations matches the fit of the Sum, which has negligible (A=8.81566×10−4) exponential character. This result may indicate that ECH ring-opening is first-order with respect to ECH concentration. As both H2O and EtOH are present in large excess, changes in their concentration by consumption during ring-opening would have little effect on the observed kinetics. This may demonstrate that concentration curves can be monitored via 13C NMR for analysis of slow gelation kinetics, even in the presence of poor signal to noise caused by low concentrations and anisotropic susceptibility broadening. Though in this instance, the species monitored are not believed to play a direct role in gelation. Drift of the reference peak was monitored as a function of time (FIG. 14B). Peak drift is caused by two processes: natural drift of the superconducting magnet field which is linear (constant drift rate) over this time interval and changes in bulk magnetic susceptibility of the matrix. The positive, time-dependent peak drift is consistent with the reduction of diamagnetic VV to paramagnetic VIV. While this experiment cannot differentiate between paramagnetic and diamagnetic susceptibility, diamagnetic changes, e.g., caused by ECH ring-opening, are small in comparison to what is observed. This result may be qualitatively consistent with the observed color change during gel aging (see FIG. 13). Example 20 Epoxide Ring-Opening in H2O-Free Sols 1H NMR of VOx gel precursors without H2O (FIG. 16A) shows epoxide ring-opening occurs in the absence of an acidic metal hydrate. A reaction is also evident in the color changes that occur when adding ECH to VOCl3 solutions: orange to pale yellow in the absence of EtOH and red to pale yellow in the presence of EtOH. Solution A4, a standard gel formulation absent H2O, clearly shows the formation of DCP, but, while the absence of ASB increases peak resolution, several peaks lay within a small chemical shift range, ca. 3.5-3.7 ppm, overlapping with the intense EtOH methylene. CCl4 was used as an inert, non-coordinating solvent with no 1H signal in an attempt to resolve these peaks and observe EtOH-free chelates. TABLE 3 Composition of solutions in FIG. 16. VOCl3 ECH EtOH Spectrum Solvent (eq.) (eq.) (eq.) A1 CCl4 1 3.1 0 A2 CCl4 1 5 0 A3 CCl4 1 3.1 3 A4 EtOH 1 5 18 B1 CCl4 1 0 1 B2 CCl4 1 0 3 B3 CCl4 1 0 10 B4 EtOH 1 0 18 The electron-withdrawing effect of the VV center on ligands can be most directly observed in the VOCl3-EtOH system (FIG. 16B). As the EtOH:VOCl3 ratio decreases, EtOH is proportionally more likely to be found coordinated to VV and consequently shifted downfield, the methylene protons more so than the methyl protons. The methyl triplet is only resolved in the solution with lowest EtOH:VOCl3 ratio, and hence strongest VV-EtOH interaction, which may be taken to imply that exchange, as opposed to nuclear or electronic effects, is the dominant broadening mechanism. It may then be inferred that species with well-resolved peaks do not exchange significantly between the solvent and VV ligand (or solvation) shell. This conclusion may be consistent with the observed peak resolutions in solutions A4, where, due to its high concentration, EtOH is effectively the sole ligand, and A3, where DCP and EtOH exchange rapidly. The anomalous peak in solutions A4 and A3 (14*) is the proportion of EtOH active in exchange over the timescale of the experiment. The high resolution of the ECH peaks in all cases means that ECH does not coordinate strongly to VV, implying that peak 3*(quintet) is attributable to DCP ligands bound to the electron-withdrawing VV and not chelated ECH. Example 21 Ultra-Low-Density VOx Gels Ultra-low-density VOx gels were fabricated by reducing the VOCl3 concentration in the standard formulation (Table 4). Reducing the ECH and H2O concentrations to maintain stoichiometric ratios reduced the quality of gels and in some cases caused a failure of gelation. Gels could only be made from sols with nominally constant concentrations of ECH and H2O. Curiously, the lowest density gels passed through three distinct phases, forming a soft red gel initially (ca. 5 min), followed by a dissolution of the solid matrix and reduction to form a deep green sol (ca. 24 hr), and eventual formation of a stable deep green gel (ca. 7 d). Unfortunately, ultra-low-density aerogels could not be fabricated, as these wet gels collapsed during super-critical CO2 drying. TABLE 4 Results of attempts to fabricate ultra-low-density gels.

Dried aero- and xerogels are so dark as to appear black (FIG. 11) and streak dark green. Upon exposure to air for several months, aerogel monoliths become lighter and noticeably green. This change can be temporarily reversed by heating the monoliths to 100° C. under vacuum for 24 hr and may be attributed to reversible H2O absorption. The macroporosity and micromorphology of the gels can be seen in FIG. 17. The fabricated aerogels have the same unique nanoworm morphology seen occasionally in gels fabricated via alkoxide hydrolysis. TEM shows small crystalline domains dispersed in an amorphous matrix, consistent with both XRD and ED (See FIG. 18). Both are consistent with sparse, intermittent crystalline domains in an amorphous matrix, as is seen in TEM images. Like their alkoxide counterparts, epoxide gels can be conformally coated with polymer using bifunctional isocyanates, to form X—VOx aerogels. These gels maintain a high specific surface area and are mechanically comparable to X—VOx aerogels synthesized via hydrolysis of vanadium oxiytripropoxide (See FIG. 19). Referring to FIG. 19, this figure shows the conformally coated cylindrical VOx nanoworm approximation used to calculate polymer coating density, where r1 and r2 are the radii of the nanoworms and before and after isocyanate crosslinking, respectively and L is the length of the nanoworms. Since conformal crosslinking only adds onto existing nanoworms, the ratio of the radii can be determined from the ratio of the volumetric surface area, σv, according to the following equation: r 2 r 1 = 2  π   r 2  L 2  π   r 1  L = σ v , 2 σ v   1 = 33.7 10.5 = 3.21 The density of the composite nanoworm, ρs,T, is the average of the density of the composite parts, ρs,1 and ρs,2, weighted by their respective volumes, V1 and V2, according to the following equation: ρ s , T =  1.32 =  ρ s , 1  V 1 + ρ s , 2  V 2 V 1 + V 2 =  ρ s , 1  2  π   r 1 2  L + ρ s , 2  2  π  ( r 2 2 - r 1 2 )  L 2  π   r 2 2  L =  3.30  r 1 2 + ρ s , 2  ( ( 3.21  r 1 ) 2 - r 1 2 ) ( 3.21  r 1 ) 2 =  3.30 + 9.30  ρ s , 2 10.3 ⇒ ρ s , 2 =  1.11  [ g  /  cm 3 ] BET analysis of N2 porosimetry of aero- and xerogels (FIG. 20; Table 5) indicates that pores collapse entirely during bench drying. The skeletal density of the VOx xerogels is significantly lower than that of the aerogels, indicating the formation of closed pores during collapse. X—VOx aerogels possess a lower specific surface area and a higher mesopore density than their native counterparts. This apparent contradiction is explained by carefully considering the geometric effects of the conformal polymer coating on the VOx matrix, adding mass, which scales volumetrically, faster than surface area, resulting in a reduced gravimetric surface area, while decreasing pore size, forming mesopores from macropores. Utilizing the bulk volumetric surface area of the aerogels (σv=σmρb), it can be seen that the total surface area of the monoliths increases with crosslinking, as would be expected from a conformal coating. Using these physical properties and approximating VOx nanoworms as cylinders (See FIG. 19), the density of the polymer coating was calculated to be 1.11 g/cm3, consistent with the skeletal density of polyurea aerogels fabricated from N3200A (1.15 g/cm3). TABLE 5 Physical properties of VOx and X-VOx gels. ρb ρs Porosity σ m σ v (g/cm3) (g/cm3) (1-ρb/ρs) (m2/g) (m2/cm3) VOx Xerogel — 2.67 — 0.31 — VOx Aerogel 0.103 3.30 0.969 102.0 10.5 X-VOx Aerogel 0.412 1.32 0.688 81.9 33.7 Example 23 Solvent Trapping and H2O Content TGA-MS reveals a significant difference between VOx aerogels and xerogels (FIG. 21). Both gels showed significant mass losses around 100° C., coincident with the evolution of H2O (m/z=18), but xerogels show an additional mass loss above 200° C., corresponding to the release of CO2 (m/z=44) along with H2O, which varied in shape between measurements. Combined with the skeletal density measurements implying closed porosity, and without being bound by theory, it is surmised that these pores are filled with organic residue, likely acetone, which undergoes complete combustion, possibly catalyzed by VOx, in the oxygen-rich atmosphere. The unusual and inconsistent shape of the TGA signal may be attributed to the fact that the closed pores do not rupture simultaneously and are not macroscopically uniform, leading to differences between samples even when collected from a single gel. The possibility that the CO2 represents the decomposition of a carbonate, formed by reaction of CO2 with the amphoteric oxide, or physisorbed CO2 was considered and rejected, as, if that were the case, aerogels (formed by immersion in liquid CO2) would show a higher relative concentration of CO2, instead of the negligible amount that is observed. TGA also shows that H2O content, indicated by the magnitude of the low-temperature loss, relative to the VOx matrix is the same for both aero- and xerogels. Since aerogels possess several orders of magnitude higher surface area, it is believed that this H2O cannot be surface-adsorbed and must be bound inside the VOx matrix. This H2O appears to be loosely bound and its removal reversible, as evinced by the reversible color change of aerogel monoliths under repeated cyclic exposure to air and 100° C. vacuum. Example 24 Film Morphology Highly uniform, smooth, dense films were fabricated by spin-coating the modified precursor sol (FIG. 22) and determined to be crystalline monoclinic VO2 via XRD (See FIG. 23), a method analogous to that of Guzman et al. (Materials Research Bulletin, 1994, 29(5), 509-515)). It was found that VOx films undergo complete reduction without the need for a reducing atmosphere, likely due to organic residues with low volatility under ambient conditions. Example 25 VO2 Film Metal-to-Insulator Transition Measurement of the metal-to-insulator transition of fabricated ˜150 nm VO2 thin film on a quartz substrate is displayed in FIG. 24. Resistivity of the film was measured using the four-point-probe technique with a 1 mm probe separation and a current of 14 nA on a controlled heating stage. A resistivity change of two orders of magnitude was observed at 65° C. upon heating and 55° C. upon cooling. Example 26 Epoxide gels exhibit several other differences from their alkoxide counterparts. Wet epoxide gels are sturdier (easier to handle during washing) and exhibit less optical scattering than their alkoxide counterparts. While X—VOx epoxide aerogels possess mechanical properties similar to X—VOx alkoxide aerogels (see FIG. 25), mechanical failure occurred at a lower strain in epoxide X—VOx aerogels. Without being bound by theory, it is believed that this premature failure is attributed to internal voids, which are not present in alkoxide X—VOx aerogels. It is suspected that these voids are formed by solvent vaporization during exothermic aging. Example 27 Additional Observations Without being bound by theory, the observation herein that robust, homogeneous gels can be fabricated over a large range of densities only using sols with nominally constant concentrations of ECH and H2O added simultaneously may suggest that epoxide ring-opening and hydrolysis occur on similar timescales, unlike what has been previously reported in other metal oxide systems. While it is proposed that acidic transition metal hydrates protonate the epoxide ring before nucleophilic attack, ring opening is observed in the VOCl3-ECH system in the absence of the H2O, i.e., absent acidic hydrates, and even in fully aprotic systems, in which epoxide protonation is precluded, which may be taken to indicate that epoxide protonation is not necessary for ring-opening. Instead, it is possible that VV-Lewis-acid catalysis may be solely responsible for ring opening in these aprotic systems and that transition metal Lewis-acid catalysis may contribute to epoxide ring-opening in other transition metal oxide systems. This may be supported by the observation that the addition of H2O after PPO in epoxide-assisted gelation of Fe2O3 leads to a gelatinous precipitate instead of a rigid gel, suggesting that FeCl3 reacts with PPO before the addition of H2O. Without being bound by theory, the intermediate fluid phase of the lowest density gel may suggest that multiple discreet processes take place at disparate timescales in all gels. First, fast formation of a red V2O5·xH2O gel driven by VV hydration and epoxide-driven ion scavenging. Second, partial or complete dissolution of the VV oxide matrix in concert with or followed by VV→VIV reduction by chelated EtOH. Finally, precipitation or gelation of blue-green VIV/V oxide, possibly driven by changes in solvent properties brought on during ECH hydrolysis and ethanolysis. While it may be possible that VV→VIV reduction occurs, evinced by gel color, acetaldehyde formation, and magnetic susceptibility evolution, the exact degree of reduction has proven difficult to quantify; the synthesized VOx is not stable under conditions necessary for measurement, e.g., aqueous redox titration, XPS, or laser Raman spectroscopy. Nevertheless, the significantly darker color of the dried gels and their dispersed solids as compared with previously-synthesized alkoxide gels, suggests that it is possible that significantly more reduction occurs in epoxide gels, which may be reflective of efficient VV-EtOH redox chemistry.
