AEROSOL-GENERATING SYSTEM HAVING A PIERCING ELEMENT The present invention relates to an aerosol-generating system for delivering an aerosol to a user comprising an aerosol-generating device and an aerosol-generating article, and in particular to a smoking device for delivering aerosolised nicotine salt particles to a user. The invention further relates to an aerosol-generating device for receiving an aerosol-generating article. WO 2008/121610 Α1 discloses devices and methods for delivering nicotine to a subject in which a delivery enhancing compound is reacted with nicotine in the gas phase to form an aerosol of nicotine salt particles. In order to retain the delivery enhancing compound, a sorption element on which the delivery enhancing compound is sorbed can be provided. The volatile delivery enhancing compound can be stored without degradation by oxidation, hydrolysis or other unwanted reactions by sealing the compartment in which the delivery enhancing compound is located. However, to obtain a more complete reaction of the nicotine with the delivery enhancing compound aerosol, the mixing of the reactants in the gas phase needs to be addressed. Thus, it would be desirable to provide such an aerosol-generating system which enables sufficient mixing of the volatile delivery enhancing compound and the nicotine or other medicament during use of the aerosol-generating system. It would be also desirable to provide an aerosol-generating system for delivering nicotine or other medicament to a user of the type disclosed in WO 2008/121610 Α1 in which the retention of one or both of the volatile delivery enhancing compound and the nicotine or other medicament during storage is improved. It would also be desirable to provide an aerosol-generating system for delivering nicotine or other medicament to a user of the type disclosed in WO 2008/121610 Α1 in which the stability of one or both of the volatile delivery enhancing compound and the nicotine or other medicament during storage is maintained. According to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided an aerosol-generating system comprising an aerosol-generating device in cooperation with an aerosol-generating article. The aerosol-generating article comprises a sealed first compartment comprising a tubular porous element and a delivery enhancing compound sorbed on the tubular porous element; and a second compartment comprising a volatile liquid.

The piercing portion has a maximum diameter greater than the diameter of the shaft portion, and the obstructing portion has an outer diameter such that it fits within the tubular porous element of the article when the aerosol-generating article is received in the device. This may improve the mixing of the delivery enhancing compound and the volatile liquid by controlling the airflow through the aerosl-generating system. As used herein, the term “aerosol-generating device” refers to an aerosol-generating device that interacts with an aerosol-generating article to generate an aerosol that is directly inhalable into a user’s lungs thorough the user's mouth.

As used herein, the terms ‘upstream’, ‘downstream’ and ‘distal’ and ‘proximal’ are used to describe the relative positions of components, or portions of components, of aerosol-generating articles, aerosol-generating devices and aerosol-generating systems according to the invention in relation to the direction of air drawn through the aerosol-generating articles, aerosol-generating devices and aerosol-generating systems during use thereof. It will be understood that the terms ‘distal’ and ‘proximal’, when used to describe the relative positions of components of the elongate piercing member, are used such that the piercing portion is at the distal, ‘free’, end and the obstructing portion is at the proximal, ‘fixed’, end which is connected to the device. As used herein, the term “longitudinal” is used to describe the direction between the downstream or proximal end and the opposed upstream or distal end of the aerosol-generating article or aerosol-generating device and the term “transverse” is used to describe the direction perpendicular to the longitudinal direction. The upstream and downstream ends of the aerosol-generating article are defined with respect to the airflow when a user draws on the proximal or mouth end of the aerosol-generating article.

The overall dimensions of the aerosol-generating system may be similar to a conventional smoking article such as a cigarette, a cigar a cigarillo or any other such smoking article. In use, the user inserts the aerosol-generating article into the outer housing of the aerosol-generating device. As the user inserts the aerosol-generating article, the piercing member pierces a first end of the first compartment, passes through the hollow central portion of the tubular porous element, and then pierces a second end of the first compartment.

The user then draws on the proximal end of the aerosol-generating article causing air to flow along the air flow pathway, entraining delivery enhancing compound vapour from the delivery enhancing compound sorbed on the porous tubular element of the first compartment and volatile liquid vapour from the volatile liquid in the second compartment. An aerosol is generated by the delivery enhancing compound vapour reacting with the volatile liquid vapour in the gas phase. The generation of the aerosol is described in further detail below.

As the user inserts the aerosol-generating article, the piercing member pierces a first end of the second compartment, passes through the tubular porous element, and then pierces a second end of the second compartment. The piercing member then pierces a s first end of the first compartment, passes through the first compartment and then pierces a second end of the first compartment. The obstructing portion fits within the tubular porous element of the second compartment so as to define the air flow pathway described herein with reference to the alternative embodiment. The user then draws on the proximal end of the aerosol-generating article causing air to flow along the air flow pathway, entraining volatile liquid vapour from the volatile liquid on the tubular porous element in the second compartment, and entraining delivery enhancing compound vapour from the delivery enhancing compound sorbed on the porous tbular element of the first compartment.

The tubular porous element may be formed from any suitable material or combination of materials for sorbing a liquid. The tubular porous element may comprise one or more porous materials selected from the group consisting of porous plastic materials, porous polymer fibres and porous glass fibres. The one or more porous materials may or may not be capillary materials and are preferably inert with respect to the acid or ammonium chloride. The particular preferred porous material or materials will depend on the physical properties of the acid or ammonium chloride.

The tubular porous element advantageously acts as a reservoir for the delivery enhancing compound. Preferably, the second compartment comprises a source of nicotine. As such, the volatile liquid within the second compartment preferably comprises one or more of nicotine, nicotine base, a nicotine salt, or a nicotine derivative. The source of nicotine may comprise natural nicotine or synthetic nicotine.

The second compartment may comprise a sorption element and nicotine sorbed on the sorption element. In a preferred embodiment, the second compartment comprises a volatile liquid nicotine source. In a preferred embodiment, the aerosol-generating article further comprises an aerosol forming chamber in fluid communication with the first compartment and the second compartment. In use, in a preferred embodiment the nicotine reacts with the acid or ammonium chloride in the gas phase in the aerosol forming chamber to form aerosolised nicotine salt particles. Alternatively, the delivery enhancing compound vapour may react with the nicotine vapour in the second compartment. In such embodiments the aerosol-generating article may further comprise a third compartment downstream of the second compartment and the delivery enhancing compound vapour may alternatively or in addition react with the nicotine vapour in the third compartment to form an aerosol. The invention allows a cost effective, compact and easy to use aerosol-generating system to be provided. Furthermore, by using an acid or ammonium chloride as a delivery enhancing agent in aerosol-generating articles according to the invention, the pharmacokinetic rate of the nicotine may be advantageously increased. It will be understood that the aerosol-generating system may also be regarded as an aerosol delivery system. That is to say, the aerosol-generating system provides means for the volatile liquid, such as a nicotine formulation, and the delivery enhancing compound, such as a pyruvic acid, to mix and generate an aerosol but does not actively generate the aerosol. In the embodiment where the aerosol-generating article comprises a third compartment, the third compartment is preferably downstream of the second compartment. Where the article comprises an aerosol forming chamber, the third compartment is preferably downstream of the aerosol forming chamber. The third compartment may comprise a flavour source. Alternatively or in addition, the third component may comprise a filtration material capable of removing at least a portion of any unreacted acid or ammonium chloride mixed with aerosolised nicotine salt particles drawn through the third compartment. The filtration material may comprise a sorbent, such as activated carbon. As will be appreciated, any number of additional compartments may be provided as desired. For example, the article may comprise a third compartment comprising a filter material and a fourth compartment downstream of the third compartment comprising a flavour source. As will be appreciated, a number of factors influence the formation of the nicotine salt particles. In general, in order to control the nicotine delivery it is important to control the vaporisation of the nicotine formulation and the acid or ammonium chloride. It is also important to control the relative quantities of the nicotine and the acid or ammonium chloride. In the preferred embodiment, the molar ratio of acid to nicotine in the aerosol forming chamber is about 1:1. The use of acid or ammonium chloride as a delivery enhancing compound has been found to approximately double the delivery rate of nicotine to a user for equivalent power supplied to the vaporiser. The vaporisation of the acid or ammonium chloride is controlled by the concentration of the acid or ammonium chloride in the first compartment, and by the exchange surface area of acid or ammonium chloride in the first compartment. The vaporisation of the acid or ammonium chloride may be controlled by heating the first compartment of the aerosol-generating article or by heating ambient air drawn through the device before it passes through the first compartment of the aerosol-generating article. In preferred embodiments where the first compartment comprises pyruvic acid, preferably about 60 micrograms of pyruvic acid is vaporised per puff. Providing an obstructing portion enables the quantity of delivery enhancing compound vaporised per puff to be increased as compared to an aerosol-generating system without such an obstructing portion. Preferably, the article comprises an opaque outer housing. This advantageously reduces the risk of degradation of the acid or ammonium chloride and nicotine formulation due to exposure to light. Preferably, the cartridge is not refillable. Thus, when the nicotine formulation in the second compartment of the aerosol-generating article has been used up, the aerosol-generating article is replaced. In certain embodiments, the device as well as the aerosol-generating article may be disposable. Advantageously, all elements of the device which are potentially in contact with the acid or ammonium chloride or the source of nicotine are changed when the aerosol-generating article is replaced. This avoids any cross-contamination in the device between different mouthpieces and different aerosol-generating articles, for example aerosol-generating articles comprising different acids or sources of nicotine. The nicotine formulation in the second compartment may be advantageously protected from exposure to oxygen (because oxygen cannot generally pass through the barrier of the second compartment until it is pierced by the piercing member) and in some embodiments light, so that the risk of degradation of the nicotine formulation is significantly reduced. Therefore, a high level of hygiene can be maintained. The aerosol-generating article is preferably substantially cylindrical in shape. The aerosol-generating article may have a transverse cross-section of any suitable shape. Preferably, the aerosol-generating article is of substantially circular transverse cross-section or of substantially elliptical transverse cross-section. More preferably, the aerosol-generating article is of substantially circular transverse cross-section. Preferably, the aerosol gernating article has a transverse cross-section substantially the same shape as the cavity of the aerosol-generating device. A housing of the aerosol-generating article may simulate the shape and dimensions of a tobacco smoking article, such as a cigarette, a cigar, a cigarillo or a pipe, or a cigarette pack. In a preferred embodiment, the housing simulates the shape and dimensions of a cigarette. The aerosol-generating device and aerosol-generating article may be arranged to releasably lock together when engaged. The outer housing of the device may be formed from any suitable material or combination of materials. Examples of suitable materials include, but are not limited to, metals, alloys, plastics or composite materials containing one or more of those materials. Preferably, the outer housing is light and non-brittle. The aerosol-generating system and device are preferably portable. The aerosol-generating system may have a size and shape comparable to a conventional smoking article, such as a cigar or cigarette. Any feature in one aspect of the invention may be applied to other aspects of the invention, in any appropriate combination. In particular, method aspects may be applied to apparatus aspects, and vice versa. Furthermore, any, some and/or all features in one aspect can be applied to any, some and/or all features in any other aspect, in any appropriate combination. It should also be appreciated that particular combinations of the various features described and defined in any aspects of the invention can be implemented and/or supplied and/or used independently. The invention will be further described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings in which: Figures 1(a) and 1(b) show a schematic representation of aerosol-generating systems according to the present invention; Figures 2 show an aerosol-generating article according to the present invention being inserted into an aerosol-generating device according to the present invention; Figure 3 shows the airflow pathway through the aerosol-generating system of Figure 1; Figure 4 shows a graph of test data showing the improved nicotine delivery for an aerosol-generating system having an obstructing portion which acts as a flow restrictor; and Figure 5 shows an alternative embodiment of an aerosol-generating system according to the present invention. Figure 1(a) shows a schematic representation of an aerosol-generating system 100. The system 100 comprises an aerosol-generating device 102 and an aerosol-generating article 104. The aerosol-generating article 104 has an elongate cylindrical shape and comprises a first compartment 106 comprising a volatile delivery enhancing compound source, and a second compartment 108 comprising a volatile liquid nicotine source. The first compartment 106 and the second compartment 108 are arranged in series and abut each other in axial alignment. The first compartment 106 is positioned at the distal, or upstream, end of the aerosol-generating article 104. The second compartment 108 is positioned downstream of the first compartment. A further element (not shown) in the form of a mouthpiece or the like may be provided at the downstream end of the second compartment. The upstream and downstream ends of the first compartment 106 and the second compartment 108 of the aerosol-generating article 104 are sealed by frangible barriers 110, 112 and 114, 116 respectively. The frangible barriers are made from metal film, such as aluminium. The aerosol-generating device 102 comprises an outer housing 118 having an elongate cylindrical cavity configured to receive the aerosol-generating article 104. The longitudinal length of the cavity is less than the length of the article 104 such that the proximal, or downstream, end of the article 104 protrudes from the cavity. The device 102 further comprises an elongate piercing member 120. The piercing member is positioned centrally within the cavity of the aerosol-generating device and extends along the longitudinal axis of the cavity. At the proximal end the piercing member 120 comprises a piercing portion 122 in the form of a cone having a circular base. At the distal end the piercing member further comprises an obstructing portion 124 which, in use, acts as a flow restrictor and forms a desired airflow pathway. The piercing portion 122 and the obstructing portion 124 are mounted on a shaft 126. Air inlets (not shown) are provided at the distal, upstream, end of the aerosol-generating device 102. Air outlets (not shown) are provided at the proximal, downstream, end of the aerosol-generating article 104. Figure 1(b) shows a similar aerosol-generating system 128 as that shown in Figure 1(a), and like numerals have been used to reference similar components. As can be seen, the diameter of the obstructing portion 130 is such that it fits within the tubular porous element 106 to act as a flow restrictor to form a desired air flow pathway as described herein. Figures 2(a) to (℮) show the article 104 being inserted into the device 102. Figure 2(a) shows the piercing member 120 engaging with the article 104. The piercing portion 122 breaks the frangible barrier 110 and creates a hole in the barrier having a diameter approximately equal to the maximum diameter of the piercing portion. The maximum diameter of the piercing portion is the diameter of the base circle of the cone which forms the piercing portion. As can be seen the internal diameter of the device cavity relative to the external diameter of the article 104 is such that the article is located centrally within the cavity. Figure 2(b) shows the piercing portion engaging with the second frangible barrier of the first compartment 106. Again, the piercing portion breaks the frangible barrier 112 and creates a hole in the barrier having a diameter approximately equal to the maximum diameter of the piercing portion. As can be seen, the maximum diameter of the piercing portion is approximately equal to the internal diameter of the tubular porous element 106. At this stage, the piercing portion also breaks through the first frangible barrier 114 of the second compartment 108, and creates a hole in the barrier having a diameter approximately equal to the maximum diameter of the piercing portion. Figure 2(c) shows the piercing engaging with the second frangible barrier of the second compartment. Again, the piercing portion breaks the frangible barrier 116 and creates a hole in the barrier having a diameter approximately equal to the maximum diameter of the piercing portion. Figure 2(d) shows the obstructing, flow restrictor, portion 124 engaging with the tubular porous element 106. As can be seen, the external diameter of the obstructing, flow restrictor, portion is larger than the internal diameter of the tubular porous element such that it forms an interference fit in the tubular porous element. The main function of the interference fit is to define the airflow pathway, as described in further detail below, but the interference fit may also aid in the retention of the article within the device during use. Figure 2(e) shows the article 104 fully inserted into the device, ready for use. As can be seen, the obstructing, flow restrictor, portion is positioned centrally within the tubular porous element 106, and the piercing portion 122 extends past the proximal, downstream, end of the second compartment. As shown in Figure 3, in use, when the aerosol-generating article 104 is fully inserted into the aerosol-generating device 102, an airflow pathway, shown by the arrows 200, is formed through the aerosol-generating system. The air flow pathway extends from the distal, upstream end of the aerosol-generating article 104 through the air inlets to the proximal, downstream, end of the article 104. The obstructing, flow restrictor, portion 124 ensures that the airflow pathway extends through the tubular porous element 106. In use, and as described above, as the aerosol-generating article 104 is inserted into the cavity of the aerosol-generating device 102 the piercing member 120 is inserted into the aerosol-generating article 104 and pierces the frangible barriers 110, 112, 114 and 116 at the upstream and downstream ends of the first compartment 106 and second compartment 108 of the aerosol-generating article 104. This allows a user to draw air into the aerosol-generating article through the air inlets at the distal, upstream, end thereof, downstream through the tubular porous element 106, and the second compartment 108 and out of the article through the air outlets at the proximal, downstream, end thereof. The obstructing, flow restrictor, portion 124 ensures that the air flow pathway extends through the porous material of the tubular porous element 106. The air flow pathway extends about the shaft of the piercing member via the hole made in the frangible barriers 112, and 114 by the piercing portion 122. The airflow pathway further extends about the shaft of the piercing member via the hole made in the frangible barrier 116 at the proximal, downstream end of the second compartment, and then about the piercing portion 122. By providing a shaft having a smaller diameter than the maximum diameter of the piercing portion, the airflow pathway is enabled to extend around the shaft in the region of the frangible barrier. Delivery enhancing compound vapour, which in the preferred embodiment contains pyruvic acid, is released from the delivery enhancing compound sorbed on the tubular porous element 106 into the air stream drawn through the aerosol-generating article 104 and nicotine vapour is released from the volatile liquid nicotine source in the second compartment 108 into the air stream drawn through the aerosol-generating article 104. The delivery enhancing compound vapour reacts with the nicotine vapour in the gas phase in the second compartment 108 to form an aerosol, which is delivered to the user through the proximal, downstream, end of the aerosol-generating article 104. Figure 4 shows experimental data which compares the nicotine delivery per five puffs of the aerosol-generating system with and without the obstructing, flow restrictor, portion on the piercing member. As can be seen, inclusion of the obstructing, flow restrictor, portion increases the overall mass of nicotine delivered over the total of 15 puffs by over 100%. Figure 5 shows a schematic representation of an aerosol-generating system 500. The system 500 comprises an aerosol-generating device 102, which is the same as that described above in relation to Figures 1 to 3, and an aerosol-generating article 502. The aerosol-generating article 502 has an elongate cylindrical shape and comprises a first compartment 504 comprising a delivery enhancing compound source, and a second compartment 506 comprising a volatile liquid nicotine source. The first compartment 504 and the second compartment 506 are arranged in series and are in axial alignment. The first compartment 504 and the second compartment 506 each comprise a tubular porous element for sorbing the respective liquids stored therein. The first compartment 504 is positioned at the proximal, or downstream, end of the aerosol-generating article 502. The second compartment 506 is positioned upstream of the first compartment. As will be appreciated, the order of the compartments in this embodiment is opposite to the order of the compartments in the embodiment described in relation to Figures 1 to 3. Again, a further element (not shown) in the form of a mouthpiece or the like may be provided at the downstream end of the second compartment. The upstream and downstream ends of the first compartment 504 and the second compartment 506 of the aerosol-generating article 502 are sealed by frangible barriers 508, 510 and 512, 514 respectively. The frangible barriers are made from metal film, such as aluminium. Air outlets (not shown) are provided at the proximal, downstream, end of the aerosol-generating article 502. In this embodiment, the obstructing portion 124, fits in the tubular porous portion of the second compartment 506, and ensures that the airflow pathway 516 extends through the tubular porous element of the second compartment 506. The airflow entrains nicotine, which in turn passes through the first compartment 504 comprising the delivery enhancing compound. The delivery enhancing compound reacts with the nicotine vapour in the gas phase in the first compartment 504 to form an aerosol, which is delivered to the user through the proximal, downstream, end of the aerosol-generating article 502. The invention has been exemplified above by reference to aerosol-generating systems comprising aerosol-generating devices comprising a piercing member having a conical piercing portion.
