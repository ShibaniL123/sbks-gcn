DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENT Hereinafter, the embodiments of the present invention are described. The following embodiments are exemplification for describing the present invention, and the present invention is not limited only to the embodiments thereof. [Novel Carboxylic Acid Ester Compound Represented by General Formula (1)] The novel carboxylic acid ester compound of the present embodiment is a compound represented by the general formula (1). (In the formula, one of R1 and R2 is a methyl group and the other of R1 and R2 is —COOR, and R is an alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms.) Examples of the alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms in the general formula (1) include a linear alkyl group and a branched alkyl group. Specific examples of such alkyl groups include, without being particularly limited to, a methyl group, an ethyl group, an n-propyl group, an iso-propyl group, an n-butyl group, an iso-butyl group and a tert-butyl group. Among these, R is preferably an ethyl group and an iso-propyl group. As the carboxylic acid ester compound represented by the foregoing general formula (1), the following isomers can exist; however, the carboxylic acid ester compound represented by the general formula (1) may be a single substance, namely, one of these isomers, or may be a mixture composed of these isomers in any proportions. (In the formula, R represents an alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms.) (In the formula, R represents an alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms.) [Method for Producing Novel Carboxylic Acid Ester Compound] A preferable method for producing the carboxylic acid ester compound represented by the general formula (1) is a synthesis method based on the following reaction path. The synthesis method based on such a reaction path is an industrially favorable method, and hence the adoption of the synthesis method particularly enhances the economic efficiency and the productivity. Hereinafter, such a preferable synthesis method is described in detail. In the synthesis method, the carboxylic acid ester compound represented by the general formula (1) is synthesized by performing the following first and second stage reactions: the first stage reaction (hereinafter, also simply referred to as “the carbonylation reaction”) for obtaining the acyl fluoride of the 2,4-dimethyl-bicyclo[2.2.2]octane compound represented by the formula (3) by using the compound represented by the formula (2) as a starting material, and by allowing the compound represented by the formula (2) to react with carbon monoxide in the presence of hydrogen fluoride to mainly perform the cyclization and the carbonylation of the compound represented by the formula (2); and the second stage reaction (hereinafter, also simply referred to as “the esterification reaction”) for performing esterification by allowing the resulting acyl fluoride represented by the formula (3) to react with an alcohol. [Compound Represented by the Formula (2)] The compound represented by the formula (2) is 4-isopropenyl-1-methyl-1-cyclohexene (generic name: limonene). As 4-isopropenyl-1-methyl-1-cyclohexene, there exist three types of species, namely, the d-isomer, l-isomer and d/l-isomer (dipentene), and any of these can be used. Limonene is abundantly contained in the natural essential oil obtained from the rind of orange, lemon or grapefruit, and hence can be obtained as a product of 98% in purity by steam distillation. Limonene is also used in other applications and industrially produced, and hence can be available at low prices. [Hydrogen Fluoride] The hydrogen fluoride (hereinafter, also simply described as “HF”) used in the carbonylation reaction functions as a solvent and a catalyst in the carbonylation reaction, and also serves as an auxiliary raw material, and hence is preferably substantially anhydrous (anhydrous hydrogen fluoride or anhydrous hydrofluoric acid). The amount used of HF can be appropriately set according to need without being particularly limited; however, the amount used of HF is preferably 3 to 25 times, and more preferably 8 to 15 times the number of moles of the compound represented by the formula (2) which serves as a main raw material. The molar ratio of HF set at 3 times or more and 25 times or less allows the carbonylation reaction to proceed efficiently, suppresses its side reaction such as disproportionation or polymerization, and allows the target carbonyl compound to tend to be obtained in a high yield. [Carbon Monoxide] As the carbon monoxide used in the carbonylation reaction, the well-known carbon monoxide gas distributed as the common industrial gas can be appropriately used, without being particularly limited. For example, the carbon monoxide gas to be used may contain, for example, an inert gas such as nitrogen or methane. The above-described carbonylation reaction is performed under the carbon monoxide partial pressure set preferably within a range from 0.5 to 5.0 MPa and more preferably within a range from 1.0 to 3.0 MPa. The carbon monoxide partial pressure set at 0.5 MPa or more allows the carbonylation reaction to proceed sufficiently and suppresses the side reaction such as disproportionation or polymerization, and allows the target alicyclic carbonyl compound to tend to be obtained in a high yield. The carbon monoxide partial pressure set at 5 MPa or less allows the load exerted on the reaction system (apparatus) to tend to be reduced. [Solvent] In the carbonylation reaction, a solvent dissolving the raw material and being inert to HF may be used. Examples of such a solvent include, without being particularly limited to, saturated hydrocarbon compounds such as hexane, heptane and decane. The use or nonuse of a solvent and the amount used of the solvent may be appropriately set in consideration of other reaction conditions and are not particularly limited. From the viewpoint of the enhancement of the yield by suppressing the polymerization reaction, the amount used of the solvent is preferably 0.2 to 2.0 times by mass the amount of the compound, the main raw material, represented by the formula (2), and from the viewpoint of the productivity and the energy efficiency, the amount used of the solvent is preferably 0.5 to 1.0 times by mass the amount of the compound, the main raw material, represented by the formula (2). [Alcohol] In the carbonylation reaction, an alcohol can also be used. An alcohol is preferably added to suppress the side reaction in the carbonylation reaction, as an esterification agent at the time of the step of the carbonylation reaction. Examples of the alcohol usable herein include methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, iso-propanol, n-butanol, iso-butanol and tert-butanol. The use or nonuse of an alcohol and the amount used of the alcohol in the carbonylation reaction may be appropriately set in consideration of other reaction conditions and are not particularly limited; however, the amount used of the alcohol is preferably 0.1 to 0.9 times, and more preferably 0.2 to 0.7 times the number of moles of the compound, the main raw material, represented by the formula (2). The molar ratio of the alcohol set within a range from 0.1 to 0.9 times the number of moles of the compound represented by the formula (2) allows the carbonylation reaction to proceed sufficiently and suppresses the side reaction such as disproportionation or polymerization, and allows the target alicyclic carbonyl compound (acyl fluoride) in the step to tend to be obtained in a high yield. [Carbonylation Reaction Conditions] The reaction temperature in the carbonylation reaction is not particularly limited, but is preferably −50° C. to 30° C. and more preferably −30° C. to 20° C., from the viewpoint of increasing the yield by increasing the reaction rate and suppressing the side reaction and additionally, obtaining the high-purity target product. The reaction time is not particularly limited, but is preferably 1 to 5 hours, from the viewpoint of allowing the carbonylation reaction to proceed sufficiently and increasing the efficiency. The carbonylation reaction is preferably performed under pressurized conditions from the viewpoint of increasing the reaction efficiency. The carbonylation reaction is preferably performed under normal pressure or under pressurized conditions, namely, under a pressure of 1.0 to 5.0 MPa, and more preferably at 1 to 3 MPa, from the viewpoint of increasing the reaction efficiency and reducing the equipment burden. The type of the carbonylation reaction is not particularly limited, and may be any of, for example, a batch-type reaction, a semi-continuous type reaction and a continuous type reaction. The end point of the reaction is not particularly limited, but may be determined with reference to the time at which no absorption of carbon monoxide is recognized any more. The above-described carbonylation reaction yields a mixed solution (carbonylation reaction product solution) including the acyl fluoride, the reaction product (intermediate) represented by the formula (3) and additionally, hydrogen fluoride, and according to need, for example, the solvent, the alcohol, and the like. Successively, the produced alicyclic carbonyl compound (acyl fluoride), represented by the formula (3) is allowed to react with an alcohol in the presence of HF to yield the carboxylic acid ester represented by the general formula (1). The esterification reaction can be performed, by adding an alcohol in the presence of HF after the produced acyl fluoride, represented by the formula (3), is once isolated and purified from the foregoing carbonylation reaction product solution according to a conventional method; and alternatively, the esterification reaction can also be performed continuously from the foregoing carbonylation reaction by further adding HF and/or an alcohol to the foregoing carbonylation reaction product solution. The preferable amount used of HF in the esterification reaction is the same as described for the carbonylation reaction, and hence the duplicative description is omitted. Examples of the alcohol as an auxiliary raw material used in the esterification include the same alcohols as described for the carbonylation reaction, namely, the monovalent alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, iso-propanol, n-butanol, iso-butanol and tert-butanol. The amount used of the alcohol in the esterification reaction is preferably such that the total amount of the alcohols used in the carbonylation reaction and the esterification reaction is 1.0 to 2.0 times the number of moles of the compound, the main raw material, represented by the formula (2), from the viewpoint of increasing the reaction efficiency and obtaining the high-purity target product. The amount used of the alcohol in the esterification reaction set within such a range reduces the amount of the unreacted acyl fluoride remaining in the reaction product, and tends to suppress the degradation of the product purity due to the acyl fluoride remaining in the reaction product together with the target ester compound and on the other hand, the remaining proportion of the unreacted alcohol is reduced and the separation (isolation) of the obtained target product is facilitated, and hence the product purity tends to be increased. The amount used of the alcohol set within the foregoing preferable range tends to alleviate the following problems (1) and (2) due to the accumulation of water in the recovered HF because the water is by-produced by the dehydration reaction of the unreacted alcohol and the water is azeotropically distilled with HF. (1) A problem of an adverse effect on the reaction (2) A problem of remarkable corrosion of the equipment materials Here, from the viewpoint of attaining a high yield, alcohol is preferably added in a predetermined amount in each of the carbonylation reaction and the esterification reaction. In this case, it is more preferable that in the carbonylation reaction, the amount used of the alcohol be set to be 0.1 to 0.5 times the number of moles of the compound, the main raw material, represented by the formula (2), and in the esterification reaction, the amount used of the alcohol is further added in such a way that the total amount of the alcohol, inclusive of the amount added in the carbonylation reaction, is set to be 1.0 to 2.0 times the number of moles of the compound, the main raw material, represented by the formula (2). From the viewpoint of efficiently isolating the obtained target product, the alcohol used in the esterification reaction and the alcohol optionally used in the carbonylation reaction are preferably the same as each other. [Esterification Reaction Conditions] The reaction temperature in the esterification reaction is not particularly limited, but is preferably −20° C. or higher and 20° C. or lower, from the viewpoint of suppressing the side reaction and increasing the yield, and from the viewpoint of suppressing the by-production of water due to the dehydration reaction of the added alcohol. The reaction time is not particularly limited, but is preferably 0.5 to 3 hours from the viewpoint of allowing the esterification reaction to proceed sufficiently and increasing the efficiency. The esterification reaction is preferably performed under pressurized conditions from the viewpoint of increasing the reaction efficiency. The esterification reaction is preferably performed under normal pressure or under pressurized conditions, namely, under a pressure of 0.1 to 5.0 MPa, and more preferably at 1 to 3 MPa, from the viewpoint of increasing the reaction efficiency and reducing the equipment burden. The type of the esterification reaction is not particularly limited, and may be any of, for example, a batch-type reaction, a semi-continuous type reaction and a continuous type reaction. The end point of the reaction is not particularly limited, but may be determined with reference to the time at which no increase of the heat of reaction is recognized any more. The foregoing esterification reaction yields a mixed solution (esterification reaction product solution) including the carboxylic acid ester compound represented by the general formula (1), HF and if necessary, for example, the solvent and the alcohol. The esterification reaction product solution can include the complex between the carboxylic acid ester compound represented by the general formula (1) and HF; however, HF can be separated by gasification, recovered and reused by decomposing the bonding between the carboxylic acid ester compound represented by the general formula (1) and HF. The decomposition operation of the complex is preferably performed as quickly as possible, from the viewpoint of suppressing, for example, the thermal deterioration or the isomerization of the product. For the purpose of allowing the thermal decomposition of the complex to proceed rapidly, it is preferable to heat the esterification reaction product solution, for example, under the reflux of a solvent inert to HF (for example, a saturated aliphatic hydrocarbon such as heptane or an aromatic hydrocarbon such as benzene). The isolation of the carboxylic acid ester compound represented by the general formula (1) can be performed according to a conventional method, and the method is not particularly limited. For example, the esterification reaction product solution is extracted in iced water and separated into the oil phase and the aqueous phase; then the oil phase is washed alternately with a sodium hydroxide aqueous solution and distilled water, and dehydrated with anhydrous sodium sulfate; from the dehydrated oil phase, for example, low boiling-point substances are removed with an evaporator; then, by rectifying the oil phase with a rectifying column having a number of theoretical plates of 20 or more, the carboxylic acid ester compound represented by the general formula (1) can be obtained with a relatively high purity. The carboxylic acid ester compound represented by the general formula (1) obtainable in this way has an intense aroma provided both with a fruity aroma and with a spicy, rose-like floral feeling recalling damascone, and is relatively excellent in aroma sustainability; accordingly, as a fragrance component (fragrance imparting component) or a material for a compound fragrance, the carboxylic acid ester compound can be effectively used in various applications, for example, in perfumery and cosmetics, health and sanitary materials, convenience goods, fiber, fiber products, clothing, food, quasi-pharmaceutical products and medicinal supplies. The carboxylic acid ester compound represented by the general formula (1) can also be effectively used as a raw material (inclusive of the intermediates in organic synthesis), by taking advantage of the bulky ring structure, rigidity, optical transparency, high Tg and lubricity (liposolubility) of 2,4-dimethyl-bicyclo[2.2.2]octane, for example, for medicines, agricultural chemicals, functional resins, and optical functional materials and electronic functional materials such as liquid crystals and resists. [Fragrance Composition] The fragrance composition of the present embodiment includes the novel carboxylic acid ester compound represented by the general formula (1). The fragrance composition of the present embodiment may include any other components as long as the fragrance composition includes the novel carboxylic acid ester compound represented by the general formula (1). For example, the fragrance composition of the present embodiment may include, as another component, a fragrance component (fragrance imparting component) other than the novel carboxylic acid ester compound represented by the general formula (1).

(internal standard substance: tetramethylsilane (TMS)). Example 1 Method for Synthesizing a Novel Compound, 2,4-dimethyl-bicyclo[2.2.2]octane-2-carboxylic acid ethyl ester An experiment was performed by using a stainless steel autoclave having an internal volume of 500 ml, being equipped with a magnet drive type stirrer, three inlet nozzles in the top thereof and one extraction nozzle in the bottom thereof, and being capable of regulating the internal temperature with the aid of a jacket. First, the air inside the autoclave was replaced with carbon monoxide, then 160 g (8.0 mol) of anhydrous hydrogen fluoride was introduced into the inside of the autoclave, the liquid temperature was set at −30° C., and then the inside of the autoclave was pressurized to 2.0 Mpa with carbon monoxide. Successively, while the temperature inside the autoclave was being maintained at −30° C. and the pressure inside the autoclave was being maintained at 2.0 MPa, a mixed solution composed of 72.6 g (0.53 mol) of 4-isopropenyl-1-methyl-1-cyclohexene, 48.4 g of heptane and 6.1 g (0.13 mol) of ethanol was fed from the top of the autoclave; after the completion of the feeding of the raw materials, the stirring of the reaction mixture was continued for 1 hour until the absorption of carbon monoxide was not found any more (the carbonylation reaction step). Next, following the carbonylation reaction, under the condition of 2.0 MPa, the temperature inside the autoclave was decreased; while the temperature inside the autoclave was being maintained at 0° C., 30.7 g (0.67 mol) of ethanol was fed from the top of the autoclave; after the completion of the feeding of the raw material, the reaction mixture was continuously stirred for 1 hour (the esterification reaction step). Subsequently, the reaction product solution was extracted from the bottom of the autoclave into iced water, the oil phase and the aqueous phase were allowed to be separated, then the oil phase was collected, the oil phase was washed twice with 100 ml of a 2% by mass sodium hydroxide aqueous solution and twice with 100 ml of distilled water, and further, the oil phase was dehydrated with 10 g of anhydrous sodium sulfate. A sample was taken from the finally obtained solution, and by using the sample, a gas chromatograph analysis was performed on the basis of an internal standard method. Consequently, the yield of the isomer-containing carboxylic acid ester compound was found to be 33.2 mol % (with reference to 4-isopropenyl-1-methyl-1-cyclohexene), and the yield of the compound represented by the formula (4), identified by the below-described GC-MS analysis and 1H-NMR spectrum analysis, namely, 2,4-dimethyl-bicyclo[2.2.2]octane-2-carboxylic acid ethyl ester was found to be 17.8 mol % (with reference to 4-isopropenyl-1-methyl-1-cyclohexene). The isomer ratio was found to be 53.6%. After the low boiling-point substance was removed from the obtained solution with an evaporator, the obtained solution was rectified (distillation temperature: 164° C., degree of vacuum: 60 torr) with a rectifying column having a number of theoretical plates of 20, and consequently, a main distillation fraction of 53.3 GC % in terms of gas chromatograph analysis was obtained in an amount of 33.4 g (distillation yield: 90.0 mol %). The rectified solution was further rectified with a rectifying column having a number of theoretical plates of 50 to isolate the main product. The obtained fraction has been verified as follows: (1) the obtained fraction, unlike the heretofore known fruitate having only fruity aroma or heretofore known geranyl acetate having only rose-like aroma, has an intense aroma provided both with a fruity aroma and with a spicy, rose-like floral feeling recalling damascone; and (2) the obtained fraction is excellent in aroma sustainability as compared to other heretofore known esters or geranyl acetate. The target product was analyzed with a GC-MS, and consequently the molecular weight of the target product was found to be 210.3. The chemical shift values (δ ppm, with reference to TMS) of the 1H-NMR in a heavy chloroform solvent were found to be: 1.16 (s, 3H), 1.24 (m, 2H), 1.27 (m, 2H), 1.30 (t, 3H), 1.34 (s, 3H), 1.49 (m, 2H), 1.52 (m, 2H), 1.54 (s, 1H), 1.79 (s, 1H), 2.05 (m, 1H) and 4.12 (m, 2H). From the above-described results, the obtained fraction was identified as 2,4-dimethyl-bicyclo[2.2.2]octane-2-carboxylic acid ethyl ester represented by the formula (4). Example 2 The carbonylation reaction step, the esterification reaction step and the treatment of the reaction product solution were performed in the same manner as in Example 1 except that the carbonylation reaction step was performed at −25° C. The obtained solution was analyzed with gas chromatography, and consequently, the yield of the isomer-containing carboxylic acid ester compound was found to be 36.9 mol % (with reference to 4-isopropenyl-1-methyl-1-cyclohexene), and the yield of the compound represented by the formula (4) was found to be 17.8 mol % (with reference to 4-isopropenyl-1-methyl-1-cyclohexene). The isomer ratio was found to be 48.2%. Example 3 The carbonylation reaction step, the esterification reaction step and the treatment of the reaction product solution were performed in the same manner as in Example 1 except that the carbonylation reaction step was performed under pressurized conditions, namely, under 1.5 MPa of carbon monoxide. The obtained solution was analyzed with gas chromatography, and consequently, the yield of the isomer-containing carboxylic acid ester compound was found to be 36.3 mol % (with reference to 4-isopropenyl-1-methyl-1-cyclohexene), and the yield of the compound represented by the formula (4) was found to be 17.4 mol % (with reference to 4-isopropenyl-1-methyl-1-cyclohexene). The isomer ratio was found to be 47.9%. Example 4 Apricot-Type Fragrance Composition First, the fragrance composition (control substance) having the composition shown in Table 1 was prepared.
