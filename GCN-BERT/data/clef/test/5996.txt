The present invention relates to novel compounds containing fluorinated end groups, to the use thereof as surface-active substances, and to compositions comprising these compounds. Fluorosurfactants, whose static surface tension is very low (16-18 mN/m), can be employed in a very wide variety of applications and contribute, for example, to improved wetting of surfaces. Thus, for example, they are used as interface promoter or emulsifier or viscosity reducer in paints, lacquers or adhesives. WO 03/010128 describes perfluoroalkyl-substituted amines, acids, amino acids and thioether acids which contain a C3-20-perfluoroalkyl group. JP-A-2001/133984 discloses surface-active compounds containing perfluoroalkoxy chains which are suitable for use in antireflection coatings. JP-A-09/111286 discloses the use of perfluoropolyether surfactants in emulsions. WO 2006/072401 and WO 2010/003567 describe surface-active compounds containing trifluoromethoxy groups. Compounds containing specific fluoroalkyl groups are described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,635,789, US 2008/0093582, JP 2004-18394 and WO 2010/002623. In addition, the compound CF3—CF2—CF2—O—CH2—CH2—OH is known (CAS 1313023-37-8), and theoretical investigations on mixtures of CO2 and perfluoroalkyl surfactants in aqueous solutions are described in J. of Supercritical Fluids 55 (2010) 802-816. Specific applications of sulfosuccinates and/or sulfotricarballylates containing various fluorinated side chains are described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,968,599 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,988,610 and U.S. Pat.

Et2O are initially introduced in a dry 500 ml four-necked flask with metal condenser, CaCl2 drying tube, dropping funnel and thermometer, and 70 ml of 1M LiAlH4 solution (0.07 mol) in Et2O are introduced via a septum. 44.30 g (0.12 mol) of methyl perfluoro(2-methyl-3-oxahexanoate) (ABCR, Karlsruhe Germany) in 50 ml of abs. Et2O are introduced into the dropping funnel. The ester is added dropwise with stirring at such a rate that the exothermicity of the reaction maintains the diethyl ether at the boil. When the addition is complete, the reaction mixture is stirred under reflux for a further 1.5 hours. A cloudy dispersion forms in the course of the reaction. The batch is cooled in an ice bath. The excess LiAlH4 is decomposed by addition of 10 ml of EtOAc with slight evolution of heat. 10 g of H2O are subsequently added, after which a flocculent aluminium hydroxide precipitate forms. 78 g of 25% sulfuric acid is added dropwise to the suspension over the course of 30 minutes, during which a clear two-phase mixture forms. The organic phase is separated off, and the aqueous phase is washed with 3×40 ml of Et2O. The organic phases are combined, washed with 3×40 ml of H2O and dried over Na2SO4. The ether is distilled off, and the residue is subjected to fractional distillation.

During the reaction, the water being liberated is removed with the aid of the water separator. The reaction is followed by means of TLC control (reaction time 24-48 h). DI water is added, and the phases are separated. The aqueous phase is subsequently extracted with 3×100 ml of MTBE, the combined organic phases are washed with 1×200 ml of water and 1×200 ml of saturated NaCl solution and dried over sodium sulfate and filtered. The solvent is distilled off in a rotary evaporator. The crude product is purified by fractional distillation.

Yield: 94% Example 5 Determination of the Static Surface Tension The static surface tensions γ of aqueous surfactant solutions having various concentrations c (grams per litre) are determined. Instrument: Dataphysics tensiometer (model DCAT 11) Temperature of the measurement solutions: 20°±0.2° C. Measurement method employed: measurement of the surface tension using the Wilhelmy plate method in accordance with DIN EN 14370. Plate: platinum, length=19.9 mm In the plate method, the surface or interfacial tension of the surfactant solution is calculated from the force acting on the wetted length of a plate, in accordance with the following formula: γ = F L · cos   θ = F L γ=interfacial or surface tension; F=force acting on the balance; L=wetted length (19.9 mm); δ=contact angle. The plate consists of roughened platinum and is thus optimally wetted so that the contact angle δ is close to 0°. The term cos δ therefore approximately reaches the value 1, so that only the measured force and the length of the plate have to be taken into account. The measurement values for the sulfosuccinate in accordance with Example 4 are reproduced in Table 1. FIG. 1 shows the static surface tension as a function of the concentration for the sulfosuccinate in accordance with Example 4.

Measurement method employed: measurement of the surface tension using the bubble pressure method Instrument: SITA tensiometer (model t 60) Temperature of the measurement solutions: 20° C.±0.2° C. In the measurement of the dynamic surface tension, air bubbles are forced through a capillary into the surfactant solution at different speeds. The surface tension can be determined from the resultant pressure change as a function of the bubble lifetime using the following equation: γ = r  ( ρ max - ρ · g · h ) 2 pmax=maximum pressure, ρ=density of the liquid, h=immersion depth, r=radius of the capillary. The measurement values for the sulfosuccinate in accordance with Example 4 are reproduced in Table 2. FIG. 2 shows the dynamic surface tension as a function of the bubble lifetime for the sulfosuccinate in accordance with Example 4.
