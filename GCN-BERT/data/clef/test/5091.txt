1-((5-Isopropylisoxazol-3-yl)methyl)-3,7-dimethyl-1H-purine-2,6(3H,7H)-dione
Step 1
Methyl 5-isopropylisoxazole3-carboxylate
5-Isopropylisoxazol-3-carboxylic acid (1.00 g, 6.45 mmol) was dissolved in methanol (20 mL), and thionyl chloride (1.51 g, 12.9 mmol) was slowly added at 0°C. The reaction solution was slowly warmed to 25°C and stirred for 12 hours. The reaction was quenched by addition of water (20 mL), extracted with ethyl acetate (100 mL x 3). The organic phase was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered and the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure to give the product methyl 5-isopropylisoxazol-3-carboxylate (800 mg, as a yellow oil) with a yield of 73%.
