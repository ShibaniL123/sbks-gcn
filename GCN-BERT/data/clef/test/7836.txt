Step 4. tert-Butyl 3-amino-5-(2-fluoro-6-methoxyphenyl)-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-c]pyridine-1-carboxylate
tert-Butyl 3-amino-5-bromo-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-c]pyridine-1-carboxylate (1.0 g, 3.19 mmol), (2-fluoro-6-methoxyphenyl)boronic acid (0.814 g, 4.79 mmol), chloro(2-dicyclohexylphosphino-2',4',6'-triisopropyl-1,1'-biphenyl)[2-(2'-amino-1,1'-biphenyl)]palladium(II) (Pd XPhos G2) (0.251 g, 0.319 mmol) and potassium phosphate (1.356 g, 6.39 mmol) were placed in a flask, and the flask was evacuated and backfilled with nitrogen three times. Then dioxane (20 mL) and degassed water (2 mL) were added, and reaction was stirred at 90° C. for 2 h. After cooling to r.t., the reaction mixture was diluted with ethyl acetate, and the resulting mixture was washed with brine. The separated organic phase was dried over sodium sulfate. The solvents were evaporated under reduced pressure and obtained crude product was purified by Biotage Isolera™ (1.05 g, 92%).
