FIELD Provided herein are oral pharmaceutical compositions containing a GLP-1 analogue and/or insulin for treating and reducing the incidence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), hepatic steatosis, and sequelae thereof. BACKGROUND The incretin hormone Glucagon-like Peptide 1 (GLP-1), secreted within minutes of food ingestion, is associated with induction of insulin release. GLP-1 is used in therapies for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). Clinical use of the native GLP-1 is limited due to its rapid enzymatic inactivation, resulting in a half-life of 2-3 minutes. To overcome this obstacle, long-acting, degradation-resistant peptides, both natural and synthetic, referred to as GLP-1 mimetic agents or analogues, have been designed and are being used. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a spectrum of chronic diseases including fatty liver, or bland steatosis, and sequelae of bland steatosis, such as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), lobular necroinflammation with fibrosis, and cirrhosis (Sharma et al, 2011; Puri et al, 2008). NAFLD-related cirrhosis can lead to end-stage liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Like other chronic end-stage liver diseases, the major option for afflicted persons is liver transplantation. NAFLD appears to be associated with certain dyslipidemias (Malhi et al, 2008; Retnakaran R et al 2012; Sung et al, 2012). An important component of Western diets includes both saturated fatty acids as well as trans-saturated fatty acids. Recent evidence indicates that such fatty acids are partly responsible for inducing steatosis and fueling hepatocyte insulin resistance (Centis et al, 2010). Some studies have suggested that GLP-1 reduces fat load in hepatocytes and may be useful in treating NAFLD, although other studies have demonstrated that GLP-1 increases hepatic glycogen synthase activity, which is expected to aggravate NAFLD. Indeed, even the very presence of GLP-1 receptor in liver cells remains controversial (Nielsen et al 2008, Redondo et al, 2003; Lopez-Delgado et al, 1998; Sharma et al, 2011; Ben-Shlomo et al 2011). A more rigorous assessment of inflammation and fibrosis in response to GLP-1 is considered necessary in order to more fully understand the response of liver cells to these agents (Kim et al, 2012). Alzheimer's disease (AD), also known as Alzheimer disease, is the most common form of dementia. There is no cure for the disease, which worsens as it progresses and eventually leads to death. Most often, AD is diagnosed in people over 65 years of age, although the less-prevalent early-onset Alzheimer's can occur much earlier. In 2006, there were 26.6 million sufferers worldwide. The causation of AD is not well understood, although it is typically correlated with accumulation of amyloid β peptides and tau protein in the brain, and these substances are believed by many scientists to play a role in causation. Parkinson's disease (PD; also known as idiopathic or primary parkinsonism, hypokinetic rigid syndrome/HRS, or paralysis agitans) is a degenerative disorder of the central nervous system. The motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease result from the death of dopamine-generating cells in the substantia nigra, a region of the midbrain, the cause of which is unknown. The disease course typically presents with movement-related symptoms, with thinking and behavioral problems arising later and dementia occurring in advanced disease. Parkinson's disease is more common in older people, with most cases occurring after the age of 50. Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative genetic disorder that affects muscle coordination and leads to cognitive decline and psychiatric problems. It typically becomes noticeable in mid-adult life. The huntingtin gene provides the genetic information for a protein that is also called “Huntingtin”. Expansion of a CAG triplet repeat stretch within huntingtin results in a mutant form of the protein, which gradually damages cells in the brain, through mechanisms that are not fully understood. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig's disease and motor neuron disease, is an incurable neurodegenerative disorder of the voluntary motor system. Characterized by selective and progressive death of motor neurons within the brain and spinal cord, it leads to paralysis of voluntary muscles and, eventually, death within five years of clinical onset. Most cases of ALS occur sporadically with unknown etiology (Li et al). Traumatic brain injury (TBI) affects 1.7 million Americans each year and is a primary contributing factor (30.5%) of all injury-related deaths in the United States. The elderly, in particular, are vulnerable to TBI and suffer an increased mortality and worse functional outcome in the face of lower initial injury severity. Many survivors experience prolonged or even permanent neurocognitive dysfunction, with lasting changes in cognition, motor function, and personality (Eakin et al). Mood disorders (e.g. bipolar disorder (BD) and major depressive disorder (MDD)) are highly prevalent, affecting 10-15% of the population at some time in their life. Mood disorders are also associated with a range of cognitive deficits which often persist during euthymic states in both treated and untreated individuals. Cognitive deficits are documented across most domains of function, including but not limited to, deficits in learning, memory (e.g., working memory, episodic memory, and semantic memory), attention, executive function, processing speed, and social cognition. However, conventional pharmacological agents for mood disorders are not proven to be sufficiently effective in treating objectively and/or subjectively measured cognitive deficits (McIntyre et al). Cerebral stroke is caused by blockage or rupture of a blood vessel, which causes a disruption in blood flow to the surrounding tissues. The tissues in the area of the stroke can become irreversibly damaged and ultimately become necrotic and die. While this cell death and resulting brain damage may not be preventable, there is a region of tissue that may be amenable to therapeutic manipulation in the area surrounding the damaged stroke infarct zone (Salcedo et al). Diabetic retinopathy, one form of retinal degeneration, is damage to the retina caused by complications of diabetes, which can eventually lead to blindness. It is an ocular manifestation of diabetes, a systemic disease, which affects up to 80 percent of all patients who have had diabetes for 10 years or more (Kertes et al). Peripheral neuropathy (PN) is damage or disease of nerves of the peripheral nervous system. It may affect sensation, movement, gland or organ function, and other aspects of health, depending on the type of nerve affected. PN may be caused by systemic diseases such as diabetes or leprosy, vitamin deficiency, medication (e.g., chemotherapy), traumatic injury, excessive alcohol consumption, immune system disease, or infection, or may be inherited (Hughes). To date, GLP-1 analogues are only available as injectable dosage forms. The present inventors are developing an oral exenatide (a GLP-1 analogue) formulation for use in treating diabetes. A first-in-humans trial (n=4) testing its safety in healthy humans demonstrated biological functionality of orally delivered exenatide (Eldor et al 2010). SUMMARY Provided herein are oral pharmaceutical compositions containing a GLP-1 analogue and/or insulin for treating and preventing nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), hepatic steatosis, and sequelae thereof, and methods of utilizing same. Results from subcutaneous, systemic, and other routes of administration cannot be extrapolated to oral administration, since oral dosage forms tend to utilize the portal route of absorption. To the knowledge of the inventors, orally administered GLP-1 analogues have never been tested for treatment of NAFLD, sequelae thereof, or neurodegenerative disease. It is described herein that the described compositions are capable of treating and preventing sequelae of NAFLD, as well as other therapeutic effects mediated by GLP-1 receptors outside the pancreas. Accordingly, the described compositions are capable of treating and preventing obesity, elevated total cholesterol, hypertriglyceridemia, elevated serum ApoB levels, elevated total cholesterol/HDL ratios, and elevated ApoB/ApoA1 ratios, atherosclerosis, sub-clinical inflammation, a prothrombotic state, platelet activation, endothelial dysfunction, a cardioembolic state, and impaired insulin-induced enhancement of vasodilator responses (Sung et al, 2012; Chatrath et al 2012; Nseir et al, 2011; Salcedo et al, 2012). It is also described that the described compositions are capable of treating various neurodegenerative disorders. Also provided herein are solid pharmaceutical compositions for administration of a therapeutic protein to a subject. The terms “protein” and “peptide” are used interchangeably herein. Neither term is intended to confer a limitation of the number of amino acids present, except where a limitation is explicitly indicated. Unless indicated otherwise, all ranges mentioned herein are inclusive.

The oil, insulin, GLP-1 analogue, protease inhibitor(s), chelator, coating, and other optional ingredients of the described methods and compositions may be any of those described herein; each alternative may be combined freely to form discrete embodiments of the invention disclosed herein. “Liquid” as used herein refers to a phase that flows freely and has a constant volume under ambient conditions. Fish oil, for instance, is a liquid under ambient conditions. The term includes oil-based solutions, suspensions, and combinations thereof. In alternative embodiments, the term may refers to a composition that has a viscosity within the range of 1-1000 millipascal seconds, inclusive, at 20° C. In embodiments where both a GLP-1 analogue and insulin are both present, these two components are indicated for co-administration together, either in the same or in separate dosage forms. In the case of separate dosage forms, “co-administration” in this regard, may refer either to simultaneous administration or, in another embodiment, to administration within 30 minutes of each other. In still other embodiments, the different components are indicated for administration in a particular order, separated by a set time interval that will typically be 30 minutes or less. For example, the insulin-containing dosage form may be indicated for administration 2-10 minutes after the exenatide-containing dosage form; in other embodiments, 10-20 minutes after the exenatide-containing dosage form; in other embodiments, 20-30 minutes after the exenatide-containing dosage form; and in other embodiments, 30-60 minutes after the exenatide-containing dosage form.

Protease Inhibitors Those skilled in the art will appreciate, in light of the present disclosure, that a variety or protease inhibitors may be used to protect the GLP-1 analogue and/or insulin in the described formulations. In certain embodiments, the protease inhibitor present in the described compositions is selected from a trypsin inhibitor and a chymotrypsin inhibitor. In more particular embodiments, the inhibitor is a trypsin inhibitor or, in other embodiments, is a chymotrypsin inhibitor. In still other embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition contains one or more inhibitors that collectively inhibit both trypsin and chymotrypsin. In more particular embodiments, both a trypsin inhibitor and a chymotrypsin inhibitor are present; or, in other embodiments, the protease inhibitor is a single inhibitor that inhibits both trypsin and chymotrypsin. An example of a single inhibitor that inhibits both trypsin and chymotrypsin, not intended to be limiting, is BBI (described herein). As used herein, the term “chymotrypsin inhibitor” refers to any agent capable of inhibiting the action of chymotrypsin on a substrate. The ability of an agent to inhibit chymotrypsin can be measured using assays well known in the art. For example, in a typical assay, one unit corresponds to the amount of inhibitor that reduces the trypsin activity by one benzoyl-L-arginine ethyl ester unit (BAEE-U). One BAEE-U is the amount of enzyme that increases the absorbance at 253 nm by 0.001 per minute at pH 7.6 and 25° C. See, for example, K. Ozawa, M. Laskowski, 1966, J. Biol. Chem. 241:3955; and Y. Birk, 1976, Meth. Enzymol. 45:700. Unless indicated otherwise, anti-chymotrypsin activity referred to herein is measured using chymotrypsin having an activity of 40 BTEE units per mg. of chymotrypsin, and is expressed in mg. of chymotrypsin inhibited per mg. of protein being tested. BTEE refers to N-Benzoyl-L-Tyrosine Ethyl Ester (see the directions for Sigma-Aldrich Product No. B6125). As used herein, the term “trypsin inhibitor” refers to any agent capable of inhibiting the action of trypsin on a substrate. The ability of an agent to inhibit trypsin can be measured using assays well known in the art. For example, in a typical assay, one unit corresponds to the amount of inhibitor that reduces the trypsin activity by one benzoyl-L-arginine ethyl ester unit (BAEE-U). One BAEE-U is the amount of enzyme that increases the absorbance at 253 nm by 0.001 per minute at pH 7.6 and 25° C. See, for example, K. Ozawa, M. Laskowski, 1966, J. Biol. Chem. 241:3955; and Y. Birk, 1976, Meth. Enzymol. 45:700. An example of an inhibitor that inhibits trypsin, not intended to be limiting, is KTI3 (described herein). Unless indicated otherwise, anti-trypsin activity referred to herein is measured using trypsin having an activity of 10,000 BAEE units per mg. of trypsin, and is expressed in mg. of trypsin inhibited per mg. of protein being tested. BAEE refers to Na-Benzoyl-L-Arginine Ethyl Ester Solution (see the directions for Sigma-Aldrich Product No. B4500). For example, in a typical assay, one unit corresponds to the amount of inhibitor that reduces the trypsin activity by one benzoyl-L-arginine ethyl ester unit (BAEE-U). One BAEE-U is the amount of enzyme that increases the absorbance at 253 nm by 0.001 per minute at pH 7.6 and 25° C. See, for example, K. Ozawa, M. Laskowski, 1966, J. Biol. Chem. 241:3955; and Y. Birk, 1976, Meth. Enzymol. 45:700. Some trypsin inhibitors known in the art are specific to trypsin, while others inhibit trypsin and other proteases such as chymotrypsin. Trypsin inhibitors can be derived from animal or vegetable sources: for example, soybean, corn, lima and other beans, squash, sunflower, bovine and other animal pancreas and lung, chicken and turkey egg white, soy-based infant formula, and mammalian blood. Trypsin inhibitors can also be of microbial origin: for example, antipain; see, for example, H. Umezawa, 1976, Meth. Enzymol. 45, 678. A trypsin inhibitor can also be an arginine or lysine mimic or other synthetic compound: for example arylguanidine, benzamidine, 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin, diisopropylfluorophosphate, gabexate mesylate, or phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride. As used herein, an arginine or lysine mimic is a compound that is capable of binding to the P1 pocket of trypsin and/or interfering with trypsin active site function. In certain embodiments, in cases where a trypsin inhibitor is utilized in methods and compositions of the present invention, the trypsin inhibitor is selected from the group consisting of lima bean trypsin inhibitor, aprotinin, (a.k.a. pancreatic trypsin inhibitor or basic pancreatic trypsin inhibitor [BPTI]; Uniprot No. P00974 [database accessed on January 2, 2013]), Kazal inhibitor (pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor), ovomucoid, Alpha 1-antitrypsin, Cortisol binding globulin, Centerin ([SERPINA9/GCET1 (germinal centre B-cell-expressed transcript 1)], PI-6 (Sun et al 1995), PI-8 (Sprecher et al 1995), Bomapin, a Glade A serpin [for example Serpina3 (NCBI Gene ID: 12; database accessed on Dec. 27, 2012), Serpina6 (NCBI Gene ID: 866; database accessed on Dec. 27, 2012), Serpina12 (NCBI Gene ID: 145264; database accessed on Dec 27, 2012); Serpinal0 (NCBI Gene ID: 51156; database accessed on Dec. 27, 2012); Serpina7 (NCBI Gene ID: 6906; database accessed on Dec. 27, 2012); Serpina9 (NCBI Gene ID: 327657; database accessed on Dec. 27, 2012); Serpinal 1 (NCBI Gene ID: 256394; database accessed on Dec. 27, 2012); Serpina13 (NCBI Gene ID: 388007; database accessed on Dec. 27, 2012); Serpina2 (NCBI Gene ID: 390502; database accessed on Dec. 27, 2012); and Serpina4 (NCBI Gene ID: 5104; database accessed on Dec. 27, 2012)] Yukopin (SerpinB12; Gene ID: 89777; database accessed on Dec. 27, 2012), antipain, benzamidine, 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin, diisopropylfluorophosphate, and gabexate mesylate. In other embodiments, more than one, for example 2, 3, or 4, of the above inhibitors is selected. A representative precursor sequence of aprotinin is: (SEQ ID NO: 1) MKMSRLCLSV ALLVLLGTLA ASTPGCDTSN QAKAQRPDFC LEPPYTGPCK ARIIRYFYNA KAGLCQTFVY GGCRAKRNNF KSAEDCMRTC GGAIGPWENL. Of these 100 residues, residues 1-21 are the signal peptide, 22-35 and 94-100 are propeptides, and the mature chain aprotinin chain is composed of residues 36-93 (58 AA). In certain embodiments, in cases where a chymotrypsin inhibitor is utilized in methods and compositions of the present invention, the chymotrypsin inhibitor is selected from the group consisting of soybean trypsin inhibitor, Bowman-Birk inhibitor, aprotinin, N-Acetyl-eglin C from leeches (Sigma-Aldrich cat. no. E7888), chymostatin (Sigma-Aldrich cat. no. C7268), α1-antitrypsin (Sigma-Aldrich cat. no. A9024), α1-antichymotrypsin (Sigma-Aldrich cat. no. A9285), potato type I proteinase inhibitor, and potato type II proteinase inhibitor. In other embodiments, the chymotrypsin inhibitor and/or the trypsin inhibitor is derived from soybean. Chymotrypsin and trypsin inhibitors derived from soybean (Glycine max) are readily available and are considered to be safe for human consumption. They include SBTI (soybean trypsin inhibitor), which in its natural form is composed of KTI3 (Kunitz Trypsin Inhibitor 3), which inhibits trypsin, and BBI (Bowman-Birk inhibitor; Uniprot number P01055 [database accessed on Jan. 3, 2013]), which inhibits chymotrypsin and trypsin. The term “SBTI”, as used herein, refers, unless indicated otherwise, to a combination of KTI3 and BBI, which may be a naturally occurring combination or an artificial combination of KTI3 and BBI. In accordance with accepted usage in the art, SBTI is sometimes referred to herein as a single protease inhibitor, despite the fact that it has two separate protease components. Chymotrypsin and trypsin inhibitor are available for example from Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo., USA. In certain embodiments, SBTI is present in an amount between 25-125 mg per dosage unit when present with another inhibitor of chymotrypsin and/or trypsin and 75-200 mg per dosage unit when present as the only inhibitor of chymotrypsin and/or trypsin. In various embodiments, SBTI is present in an amount of 30-180 mg, 35-170 mg, 40-160 mg, 45-150 mg, 50-140 mg, 50-130 mg, 50-120 mg, 50-100 mg, 55-95 mg, 60-90 mg, 65-85 mg, 70-80 mg, 50-150 mg, 60-140 mg, 70-130 mg, 80-120 mg, 90-100 mg, 100-150 mg, 110-140 mg, 120-130 mg, 100-200 mg, 110-190 mg, 120-180 mg, 130-170 mg, or 140-160 mg per dosage unit. All the aforementioned ranges are inclusive. In still other embodiments, the SBTI is present in an amount of 25 mg, 30 mg, 40 mg, 50 mg, 60 mg, 75 mg, 90 mg, 100 mg, 110 mg, 125 mg, 150 mg, 175 mg, or 200 mg per dosage unit. Methods for preparing BBI are described for example in U.S. Pat. No. 7,404,973 and in PCT International Application Publ. No. WO 2013/10289 to Avraham Hershko, filed on Jan. 31, 2013, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.

Example 3: Testing of Oral GLP-1 Analogue Formulations for Treating and Preventing Alzheimer's Disease in an Animal Model One or more dosage forms containing one or more protease inhibitors, EDTA, and a GLP-1 analogue is administered on an ongoing basis, for example for a time period of between 1-24 weeks, to experimental animals in the context of an animal model of Alzheimer's disease. In other experiments, the formulation contains insulin and a GLP-1 analogue as the active agents. In some experiments, the animal model is a streptozotocin (STZ)-induced rat model of AD. Intracerebral injection of STZ leads to hyper-phosphorylation of tau protein and causes a condition that mimics AD. Some experiments utilize sham-injected animals, whereby CSF is used instead of STZ, as a control group. After complete recovery from the procedure (typically several months after induction), animals are divided into groups and for treatment with oral GLP-1 or empty carrier (e.g. normal saline) for a period of several days, in some experiments for at least 30 days. Dose-dependent and time-course effects of oral GLP-1 on memory retention are measured during the course of treatment. Following treatment, the animals are sacrificed, and brain tissues are used to evaluate hippocampal and cortical GLP-1 levels, amyloid beta (Aβ) burden, tau phosphorylation, and inflammatory markers. In some experiments, the cognitive status of the subjects is followed over the experimental period, or neurodegenerative disease status is assessed according to Salcedo et al or a reference cited therein, to test the effectiveness of the compositions. Below are some representative protocols that can be used: Radial arm maze (RAM) task Working memory in animals is tested with the RAM apparatus (Alamed) and using described test methods including training. The test is typically performed several months after STZ induction. Hole-board (HB) task Animals are tested for learning deficits in a food-motivated complex HB apparatus. The apparatus consists of an open field containing an array of holes surrounded by Plexiglass walls. Each hole contains a metal cup with a perforated bottom under which food pellets are placed. The test records the number of visits to food-baited holes (hits), the number of visits to unbaited holes (errors) and the time to complete the trial. Biochemical studies Animals are euthanized at the completion of behavioral studies, and biochemical studies and histology are conducted on fixed brains. In some experiments, the hippocampus and frontal cortex from one hemisphere are dissected and used for biochemical studies, such as those listed below. Estimation of active GLP-1 levels Isolated hippocampal and cortex samples are homogenized with a 10-fold volume of chilled 50 mM phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.8). The homogenate is divided into four equal portions and utilized for the estimation of GLP-1, Aβ42, tau and inflammatory markers. Active GLP-1 and Aβ42 levels can be tested using commercially available ELISA kits. Measurement of phosphorylated tau (p-tau) Hippocampal and cortical tissues are harvested and subjected to Western Blot analysis. Measurement of TNF-α and IL-1β levels TNF-α and IL-1β levels in the hippocampal and cortex homogenate can be measured using available ELISA kits. Histology and neuronal count The hippocampus and cortex is sectioned and stained with cresyl violet (CV) acetate, and stained neurons are analyzed using an image analyzer. CV positive neurons numbers are compared with the sham control group, and average cell counts of the sections are obtained from each animal. Example 4: Testing of Oral GLP-1 Analogue Formulations for Treating and Preventing Stroke In An Animal Model The preventive and therapeutic effects of oral GLP-1 analogue are tested in an animal stroke model. One such model is a reperfusion injury model in rats, where rats undergo temporary occlusion of the middle cerebral artery for 90 min. Rats are administered GLP-1 analogue or carrier for several days prior and/or after reperfusion. Assessment of the neurological consequences, biochemical changes, and/or size of infarct is performed. Neurological function may be determined using a modified Bederson's test at one or several time points after occlusion, after which rats may be euthanized for histological investigation. In some experiments, peripheral blood is obtained for measurement of blood glucose level and evaluation of oxidative stress and/or brain tissues are collected to measure vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels (Sato et al). Example 5: Testing of Oral GLP-1 Analogue Formulations for Treating and Preventing Parkinson'S Disease Patients with moderate Parkinson's disease (PD) are randomly assigned to receive either oral GLP-1 analogue or placebo for 12 months. PD progression is measured, in some cases after withdrawal of conventional PD medication. For example, the Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) may be used, in some cases together with one or more non-motor tests, at several time points during treatment and in some cases after a further washout period (Aviles-Olmos et al). Example 6: Testing of Oral GLP-1 Analogue Formulations for Treating and Preventing Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) in an Animal Model The ability of oral GLP-1 analogue formulations to protect against or facilitate recovery from TBI is evaluated. In some experiments, the GLP-1 analogue is administered for several days after injury. One model that may be used is an in vivo fluid percussion injury model (Eakin et al). Markers of cell death and measures of cognitive function may be utilized. Examples of the latter are the Morris Water Maze and other cognitive tests described herein. Example 7: Testing of Oral GLP-1 Analogue Formulations for Treating and Preventing Peripheral Nerve Injury in an Animal Model The ability of oral GLP-1 analogue formulations to protect against or facilitate recovery from peripheral nerve disease is evaluated. One model that may be used is sciatic nerve crush nerve injury. GLP-1 analogue or empty carrier is administered shortly after crush injury and continued for several subsequent days or weeks. Rats subjected to sciatic nerve crush may exhibit marked functional loss, electrophysiological dysfunction, and atrophy of the tibialis anterior muscle (TA). Recovery can be monitored by measuring neurological function, electrophysiological function, muscle atrophy, and/or morphological parameters several days or weeks after nerve crush (Yamamoto et al). Example 8: Testing of Oral GLP-1 Analogue Formulations for Treating and Preventing Cognition and Mood Disorders In other experiments, the ability of oral GLP-1 analogue formulations to treat bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, schizophrenia, and/or schizoaffective disorder is evaluated. Individuals with these conditions or at risk of developing them are treated with GLP-1 analogue on an ongoing basis, for example for a time period of between 1-24 months, and clinical global improvement in psychiatric symptoms and/or manic, depressive, or schizophrenic symptoms is measured. In other experiments, cognitive function is determined, using tests known to those skilled in the art (McIntyre et al). Example 9: Testing of Oral GLP-1 Analogue Formulations for Treating and Preventing Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) in an Animal Model In other experiments, the ability of oral GLP-1 analogue formulations to treat or prevent ALS is evaluated. GLP-1 analogue is administered on an ongoing basis, for example for between 1-18 weeks. In some experiments, an animal model such as the SOD1 G93A mutant mouse (Li et al) is utilized. Disease progression can be monitored by measuring activity level, e.g. running behavior, lumbar spinal cord structure, and, using brain tissue, neuron density and specific disease progression markers such as glial fribrillary acidic protein (GFAP), Caspase-3, Choline acetyl transferase (ChAT), and the neuronal cell neurofilament protein, SMI-32 (Li et al). Example 10: Testing of Oral GLP-1 Analogue Formulations for Treating and Preventing Huntington's Disease in an Animal Model In other experiments, the ability of oral GLP-1 analogue formulations to treat or prevent Huntington's disease is evaluated. GLP-1 analogue is administered on an ongoing basis, for example for between 1-18 weeks. In some experiments, an animal model such as those described in Brooks and Dunnett and the references cited therein is utilized. Example 11: Testing of Oral GLP-1 Analogue Formulations for Treating and Preventing Diabetic Neuropathy in an Animal Model In other experiments, the ability of oral GLP-1 analogue formulations to treat or prevent diabetic neuropathy is evaluated. GLP-1 analogue is administered on an ongoing basis, for example for between 1-18 weeks. In some experiments, an animal model such as those described in Lai and Lo and the references cited therein is utilized. Example 12: Testing of Oral GLP-1 Analogue Formulations for Treating and Preventing Alzheimer's Disease, Huntington's Disease, Stroke, TBI, Peripheral Nerve Injury, AL, And Diabetic Neuropathy in Humans One or more dosage forms containing one or more protease inhibitors, EDTA, and a GLP-1 analogue is administered on an ongoing basis, for example for between 1-48 months, to subjects at risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease stroke, TBI, peripheral nerve injury, ALS, or diabetic neuropathy. In other experiments, the formulation contains insulin and a GLP-1 analogue. To test the effectiveness of the compositions, the disease status of the subjects is followed over the experimental period, in some cases in combination with brain imaging. Disease status may be followed, for example, by performing physiological tests and/or determining cognitive status or neurological function, according to Salcedo et al or a reference cited therein, or other tests known to those skilled in the art. Example 13: Testing of Oral GLP-1 Analogue Formulations for Treating and Preventing Diabetic Neuropathy in an Animal Model In other experiments, the ability of solid pharmaceutical formulations, containing insulin, a GLP-1 analogue, or a combination thereof, to inhibit or prevent the development of Type II Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) in a subject with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) is evaluated. The pharmaceutical composition is administered on an ongoing basis, for example for between 1-240 weeks, in some experiments daily at bedtime. Patients are followed by DM indicia known in the art, such as fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels, frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test (FSIVGTT), oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), and HbA1C levels, to monitor the development of T2DM. Alternatively or in addition, insulin sensitivity and beta-cell function are measured. In the claims, the word “comprise”, and variations thereof such as “comprises”, “comprising”, and the like indicate that the components listed are included, but not generally to the exclusion of other components.
