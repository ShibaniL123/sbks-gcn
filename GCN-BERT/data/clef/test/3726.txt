The present invention relates to a method for transferring glass articles. As is known, once molded, glass articles are extracted from the respective molds, are placed on top of a supporting surface known as a dead plate, and are then transferred onto a linear conveyor, which feeds them in a straight direction to a cooling station. The glass articles are transferred from the dead plate to the linear conveyor by a transfer assembly, e.g. of the type described in US 3 318 433 and in the Applicant's European Patent Applications EP 1627858 B1 and EP 1627859 B1, which comprises a fixed support; a pusher with seats or compartments, for engaging a group of articles for transfer; and an articulated actuating arm connected to the fixed support at one end, and fitted with the pusher at the other. The articulated arm comprises a powered first elongated portion hinged to the fixed support to rotate about a fixed hinge axis perpendicular to the dead plate; and a powered second elongated portion connected to the first elongated portion to rotate, with respect to the first elongated portion, about a movable hinge axis parallel to the fixed hinge axis. In known solutions of the above type, when set to an engage position engaging the articles on the dead plate, the pusher projects from the arm, on the opposite side of the arm to the conveyor, and the movable hinge axis extends inside the space between two parallel planes perpendicular to the dead plate and respectively containing the straight travelling direction of the articles on the conveyor, and the fixed hinged axis; and the movable hinge axis remains inside this space as long as it takes to push or transfer the group of articles onto the conveyor. As a result, when the articles are deposited on the conveyor, the centre of gravity of the group of articles transferred is located upstream, in the travelling direction of the articles on the conveyor, from a plane containing the fixed hinge axis and perpendicular to the travelling direction. Because of the position of the movable hinge axis when pushing the articles onto the conveyor, and the resulting position of the centre of gravity of the articles on the conveyor, there is a limit to how fast the articles can be transferred, and therefore to how much the output rate can be increased, without damaging the articles and, above all, without some of the articles being left on the dead plate at the push stage, and others being hurled onto the conveyor at the release stage. In other words, as the output rate and, therefore, the rotation speed of the arm about the fixed hinge axis increase, the articles in the group travel along even widely differing trajectories that get further and further apart radially, as shown in the Figure A diagram, which shows trajectories of a group of three articles to be transferred, and the return trajectories of the articles. As shown in Figure A, depending on their locations on the dead plate, the articles travel along different trajectories, with different acceleration and different peripheral speeds, thus resulting, just before the articles are released onto the conveyor, in high speed and acceleration components perpendicular to the travelling direction of the articles on the conveyor. Figure B shows the speed curves of the articles at the push stage. As can be seen, the speed curves differ widely, but more important is the extent to which the speed of each article oscillates with respect to conveyor speed, especially close to the conveyor. Other pushing devices are disclosed for example in US 6 601 410 B1; CZ 288 848 B6; IT T02008 0278 A1; GB 2 231 855A; GB 1 278 569 A; US 2005/193773 A1 and De 198 00 080 C1. It is an object of the present invention to provide a method of transferring glass articles, designed to provide a simple, low-cost solution to the above problems. According to the present invention, there is provided a method of transferring a group of glass articles as claimed in Claim 1. A non-limiting embodiment of the invention will be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which: Figure A shows a graph of the push trajectories of the articles and the return trajectories of the pusher using a known transfer assembly;Figure B shows a graph of the speed curves of the transferred articles using a known transfer assembly;Figure 1 shows a schematic plan view of a preferred embodiment of the transfer assembly according to the present invention;Figure 2 shows the same view as in Figure 1, of a variation of a detail in Figure 1;Figures 3 and 4 are similar to Figures A and B respectively, and show, respectively, a graph of push trajectories of the articles and return trajectories of the pusher, and a transfer speed graph, using the transfer assembly in Figures 1 and 2;Figure 5 shows one way of constructing one of the trajectories in Figure 3. Number 1 in Figure 1 indicates as a whole a transfer assembly for transferring glass articles 5. Assembly 1 comprises a fixed support 2; a horizontal supporting surface 3, known as a dead plate, for supporting a group of articles 5 for transfer - in the example shown, a line of three articles 5a, 5b, 5c; and a carry-off conveyor 7, a conveying branch 8 of which, parallel to supporting surface 3, extends perpendicular to the line of articles 5 to feed articles 5 in a straight horizontal travelling direction 9. As shown in Figure 1, assembly 1 also comprises a powered articulated arm 10, in turn comprising an elongated portion 11, one end of which is hinged to fixed support 2 to rotate about a fixed hinge axis 13 perpendicular to supporting surface 3 and to conveying branch 8, and the opposite end of which is hinged to an end portion of a second elongated portion 15. Second elongated portion 15 is movable with respect to first elongated portion 11 about a movable hinge axis 16 parallel to fixed hinge axis 13, projects from fist elongated portion 11, and has a free end portion 15a connected integrally to a known pusher 18, with aligned seats, not described in detail. Pusher 18 comprises three seats, one for each article 5, in Figure 1, comprises four seats in the Figure 4 embodiment, and comprises two seats in a variation not shown. Arm 10 is controlled by a control unit 20', also forming part of assembly 1, to move pusher 18 between an engage position (shown by the continuous line in Figures 1 and 2) engaging articles 5 on supporting surface 3, and a release position (shown by the dash line in Figures 1 and 2) to release articles 5 onto conveying branch 8 of conveyor 7. Elongated portions 11 and 15 are sized and positioned angularly with respect to each other so that, when pusher 18 is in the engage position, the centre of gravity G of the group of articles 5 engaged by pusher 18 lies in a space S bounded by two parallel planes 20 and 21 (Figures 1 and 2) perpendicular to supporting surface 3, and of which plane 20 contains travelling direction 9, and plane 21 extends through end portion 15a of arm 10. When pusher 18 is in the engage position, movable hinge axis 16 and the point P at which pusher 18 is connected to portion 15a - and which, in the example shown, coincides with the axis of symmetry of elongated portion 15 - are located outwards of a further space bounded by plane 20 on one side, and, on the other side, by a further plane 22 parallel to planes 20 and 21 and containing fixed hinge axis 13. In the release position, on the other hand, pusher 18 projects from portion 15a of arm 10, in the travelling direction of conveying branch 8 of conveyor 7, beyond a plane 25 (Figures 1 and 2), containing fixed hinge axis 13 and perpendicular to supporting surface 3 and travelling direction 9, by such an amount that the centre of gravity G of the group of articles 5 is located downstream from plane 25 in the travelling direction of articles 5. The position of pusher 18 with respect to end portion 15a of arm 10, the resulting locations of centre of gravity G in the engage and release positions, and the configuration of arm 10, with movable hinge axis 16 on the opposite side of fixed hinge axis 13 and plane 22 to conveyor 7, enable articles 5a, 5b, 5c to be removed from supporting surface 3 by moving the centres of gravity of articles 5a, 5b, 5c along predetermined push trajectories indicated T5a, T5b, T5c respectively in Figure 3, and pusher 18 to be returned to the engage position along return trajectories indicated R5a, R5b, R5c. The way trajectories T5a, T5b, T5c and R5a, R5b, R5c are constructed is described in detail below. As shown in Figure 3, trajectories T5a, T5b, T5c have respective substantially superimposed intermediate portions bounded by points K and L, while the other portions are located side by side, substantially facing and parallel. The advantages of the characteristics of assembly 1 are obvious from a comparison of the Figure 3 trajectories with those in Figure A. More specifically, as shown in Figure 3, the push trajectories within the dash line 30 approach conveyor 7 more gradually, and on average in a movement more tangent to conveyor 7, than the known push trajectories within a corresponding dash line 30a in Figure A. As a result, just before articles 5 are released onto conveyor 7, the speed and acceleration components perpendicular to conveyor 7 are less than for the known trajectories in Figure A. Moreover, because the push trajectories in Figure 3 are longer than those in Figure A, articles 5 are accelerated less than along the corresponding trajectories in Figure A, thus resulting in steadier transfer of articles 5, which are all always removed from supporting surface 3, and always released in predetermined positions onto conveyor 7. The particular configuration of arm 10 and the position of pusher 18 with respect to arm 10 also provide for a big improvement in the dynamic conditions in which articles 5 are transferred. As shown in Figure 4, in which V5a, V5b, V5c indicate the speed curves described by the centres of gravity of articles 5a, 5b, 5c at the push stage, the curves are much more similar than the corresponding curves in Figure B relative to transfer using conventional known transfer assemblies. Moreover, the three curves in Figure 4 increase side by side, and the speed of each article rises gradually up to the speed of conveyor 7, with no noticeable oscillation close to conveyor 7, as occurs in known solutions, as shown in Figure B. An oscillation in speed close to conveyor 7 (Figure B) produces severe instability, particularly of the article furthest from conveyor 7 - in the example shown, article 5a. In addition to the geometry and/or dimensional characteristics of transfer assembly 1, the above results and advantages are also largely due to the way in which articulated arm 10 and, hence, the movement of pusher 18 are controlled, and, in other words, the way in which the push trajectories of articles 5 and the return trajectories to the engage position are constructed. More specifically, each trajectory is defined on the basis of a number of parameters, some entered into unit 20 directly by the operator, such as the geometric configuration of the arm, the desired path, the position of the articles for transfer, and the arrival speed at conveyor 7, and others calculated automatically on the basis of output rate and the speed of conveyor 7. The result is a number of passage points and respective motion characteristics; and the passage points are joined using a special interpolation technique based on Hermite curves. A Hermite curve is defined bv the following : Pt=P1⁢2⁢t3-3⁢t2+1+P2⁢-2⁢t3+3⁢t2+ⅆP1ⅆt⁢t3-2⁢t2+t+ⅆP2ⅆt⁢t3-t2 where P1 and P2 are the two end points of the curve, and ⅆP1ⅆt and ⅆP2ⅆt represent the prime derivatives at the end points. The curve is a function of parameter t, of dominion 0 <= t <= 1, and the intermediate points in the curve are calculated using said equation. In a typical numerical-control application, the intermediate points in the curve must be equally spaced in time; and the intermediate point of each sampling instant must be translated into a value of parameter t, the parameter by which to identify a (normalized) point in the Hermite curve. Because an increase in uniform space along the curve does not correspond to a uniform increase in parameter t, another equation must be established to relate the two quantities, and which is : t=fS From a desired quantity of space S (measured from the start point of and working along the curve), the value of parameter t corresponding to a point located the desired space from the start point along the Hermite curve can thus be determined : Sn-» fSn)-» tn This, too, is an interpolative function, in which: the start point P1 of the Hermite curve corresponds to So=0 and to=0;the end point P2 of the Hermite curve corresponds to Sn=L and tn=1, i.e. space equal to the length L of the whole curve; andthe intermediate points Sn, tn are the passage points of the interpolation function, and the denser they are, the more accurate the interpolation is (the average deviation of the theoretical curve is reduced). For lack of a closed solution by which to determine it, length L of the curve is calculated numerically. The above interpolation technique can be used to form one or more portions or the whole of both the push trajectories and the return trajectories to the supporting surface. With reference to Figure 5, portion 40, corresponding to the entire push trajectory, is preferably formed using the Hermite interpolation technique, whereas portions 41 corresponding to departure from conveyor 7 and braking, portion 42 corresponding to return to the engage position, and portion 43 corresponding to approach to supporting surface 3 are obtained by point-to-point movements, with no trajectory control. In one variation, the return trajectories are also obtained by joining various segments, all constructed using the Hermite interpolation technique. In both cases, the push trajectory, or at least part of it, is calculated by Hermite interpolation, taking a reference point coincident with the centre of gravity of an article, e.g. article 5c. For purely geometric reasons, this ensures the other articles 5 travel along trajectories which, at the end, are tangent to and never overstep the centreline of conveyor 7. The trajectory of article 5c is generated, and the trajectories of the other articles are determined accordingly. This is made possible by pusher 18 making articles 5b, 5a physically integral with article 5c, which means the positions of articles 5b, 5a can be geometrically determined directly from the positions of article 5c. The trajectories of the articles differ in length, that of article 5a, again for geometric reasons, being the longest; and, time-wise, all the articles start the push movement from supporting surface 3 simultaneously, and complete it simultaneously at conveyor 7. Consequently, applying a given speed curve to the longest trajectory - that of article 5a - produces slower speed curves for the shorter trajectories - those of articles 5b and 5c - thus preventing severe oscillation, as shown in Figure B. Clearly, changes may be made to assembly 1 and the method as described herein without, however, departing from the protective scope defined in the independent Claims. More specifically, arm 10 and pusher 18 may be designed differently from those described and illustrated by way of example. Also, the curves may be interpolated otherwise than as described, while still achieving the same or equivalent results.
