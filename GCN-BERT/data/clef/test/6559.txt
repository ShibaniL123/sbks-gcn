CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/346,205, filed May 19, 2010, the subject matter of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a cable tray system, and more particularly, to a wire cable tray system for routing cables in various overhead applications. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Overhead cable routing systems typically include a cable basket or a cable duct. The cable basket or cable duct include integral sidewalls. Various routing devices are installed on the cable basket or cable duct during installation. Often the sidewalls of the cable basket or cable duct need to be cut when a tee, cross or right angle pathway is created. As a result, installation of the typical cable basket or cable duct pathway is time consuming, costly and creates sharp edges. It is desirable to provide a cable routing system that refrains from requiring walls to be cut during installation of the system. It would also be desirable to provide an improved cable routing system that is easier and quicker to install. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention is directed to a cable routing system. The cable routing system is formed from a tray having a plurality of transverse wires and a plurality of longitudinal wires. The transverse wires form a generally flat top portion with downwardly extending sidewalls. Longitudinal wires are positioned underneath the top portion, side longitudinal wires are positioned adjacent the downwardly extending sidewalls and bottom longitudinal wires are positioned at an end of each of the downwardly extending sidewalls. The transverse wires and the longitudinal wires form a grid with a plurality of openings for routing a plurality of cables. The cable routing system includes sidewalls removablely secured to the tray. The sidewalls retain the plurality of cables routed thereon. The cable routing system further includes at least one corner radius device removablely secured to the tray. The corner radius device provides bend radius control to the plurality of cables routed along intersecting cable trays. The cable routing system further includes brackets for joining adjacent cable trays. The brackets include a main body, upper members, a bottom member and sides. The main body has a base with a top edge, a bottom edge and sides. The upper members extend from the top edge of the main body. The upper members are designed to engage a longitudinal wire of the cable tray. The upper members include a space that retains transverse wires of adjacent cable trays. The bottom member extends from the bottom edge of the main body and the side members extend from the sides of the main body. A longitudinal wire of the cable tray is positioned between the upper members and the side members to secure the bracket to the cable tray. The cable routing system includes brackets for joining perpendicular cable trays. The brackets include a main body and a securing clip. The main body has a bottom and two sides extending upwardly from the bottom. Each side includes a deflectable side latch that is designed to engage a bottom longitudinal wire of the cable tray. The securing clip engages the main body to secure the bracket to the cable tray. The cable routing system further includes a drop down cable routing device. The drop down cable routing device includes an outer shell and an inner core. The outer shell has downwardly extending sides with a mating flange extending from a bottom of each side. The inner core is positioned within the outer shell. The inner core has a base with a plurality of loops at the center of the base for engaging the cable tray. The base includes sides with a mounting flange extending downwardly therefrom. The mounting flanges of the outer shell are welded to the mounting flanges of the inner core to secure the outer shell and the inner core together. The cable routing system further includes a wall mount bracket. The wall mount bracket supports the cable tray when the cable tray is mounted to a wall. The wall mount bracket includes a back wall and a sidewall outwardly extending from the back wall. The back wall includes a top, a bottom, sides and mounting holes positioned therebetween. The sidewall has a distal end with an engaging member that receives a bottom longitudinal wire of the cable tray.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION FIG. 1 illustrates a top perspective view of the cable tray cable routing system 100 of the present invention. The cable tray cable routing system 100 is an overhead system with no integral sidewalls. The cable tray cable routing system 100 includes sidewall joiner brackets 130 (see FIGS. 3-7) and center position joiner brackets 180 (see FIGS. 8-11) for securing adjacent cable trays. The cable tray cable routing system 100 includes snap-on sidewalls 200 (see FIGS. 12-17) for installing sidewalls where cable retention is highly required. The cable tray cable routing system 100 includes side spill downs 220 (see FIGS. 18-21) and drop down waterfall devices 250 (see FIGS. 22-28) for routing cables to and from the system. The cable tray cable routing system 100 includes intersect joiner brackets 300 (see FIGS. 29-38) and corner radius devices 350 (see FIGS. 39-44). Finally, the cable tray cable routing system 100 includes trapeze brackets 400 (see FIGS. 45-51), cantilever wall mount brackets 450 (see FIGS. 52-59) and wall termination brackets 500, 550 (see FIGS. 60-72) for supporting the cable tray cable routing system. FIG. 2 illustrates a perspective view of a section of the cable tray 110 of the present invention. Each cable tray section 110 includes a plurality of transverse wires 112 and a plurality of longitudinal wires 120. The transverse wires 112 form a generally flat top 114 for supporting cables routed on the cable tray cable routing system 100. Each transverse wire 112 includes a top portion 116 and sidewalls 118. Top longitudinal wires 120 are positioned underneath the top portion 116 of the transverse wires 112. A side longitudinal wire 122 is also positioned adjacent to each sidewall 118 and a bottom longitudinal wire 124 is positioned at the end of each sidewall 118. The cable tray 110 is formed from large diameter wires, which creates a more rigid structure with fewer longitudinal wires. As a result, the cable tray is generally stronger and weighs less than competitive trays. Also, the reduction in longitudinal wires would reduce cutting time during installation of the cable tray system. The longitudinal wires 120 and the transverse wires 112 of the cable tray 110 form a grid with a plurality of openings 126. The openings 126 in the cable tray 110 have been sized to maximize the number of cables that can pass through a single opening. The openings 126 have also been sized to enable a pre-terminated cassette, such as the pre-terminated cassette disclosed in commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 7,689,089, to pass straight through the opening without having to cut away any wires forming the cable tray 110 to enlarge the openings 126. The openings in the center of the cable tray 110 are uniform with the cable opening width being identical for all cable tray pathway widths (12″, 18″, 24″ and 30″). However, the width of the end openings changes for each cable tray pathway width (12″, 18″, 24″ and 30″). FIGS. 3-7 illustrate sidewall joiner brackets 130 used to join two adjacent cable tray sections 110. The sidewall joiner bracket 130 fits on either side of adjacent cable tray sections 110. As illustrated in FIG. 4, the sidewall joiner bracket 130 is installed at the gap between the two cable tray sections 110. The sidewall joiner bracket 130 is positioned at the gap and pushed forward toward the center of the cable trays 110 until the side longitudinal wire 122 and the bottom longitudinal wire 124 are engaged by the sidewall joiner bracket 130. FIGS. 5-7 illustrate the sidewall joiner bracket 130. The sidewall joiner bracket 130 includes a main body 132 that is a single stamped metal part. The main body 132 includes an upper horizontal window 142, a lower horizontal window 144 and two vertical slots 146. The windows 142, 144 and the slots 146 are located near the center 134 of the main body 132. The main body 132 also includes a hole 148 for receiving a bonding screw 174 to secure the sidewall joiner bracket 130 to the cable trays. Upper members 150 with upper spring arms 152 extend horizontally from a top edge 136 of the main body 132 of the sidewall joiner bracket 130. The upper spring arms 152 engage the side longitudinal wires 122 of the cable trays 110 to prevent the sidewall joiner bracket 130 from rattling and to account for position tolerance on the cable tray 110. A bottom member 154 with lower spring arms 156 extends horizontally from a bottom edge 138 of the main body of the sidewall joiner bracket 130. The lower spring arms 156 engage the bottom longitudinal wires 124 of the cable trays 110 to secure the sidewall joiner bracket 130. The upper members 150 and the bottom member 154 extend away from the main body 132 such that when the sidewall joiner bracket 130 is installed on the cable trays 110, the upper members 150 and the bottom member 154 extend under the flat top 114 of the cable trays 110. Wrap around metal arms 158 extend from each side 140 of the main body 132 such that a portion of each wrap around metal arm 158 extends through the vertical slots 146 near the center 134 of the main body 132. As illustrated in FIG. 5, a portion of the wrap around metal arm 158 projects through the vertical slot 146 in front of the main body 132. When the sidewall joiner bracket 130 is installed on the cable trays 110, the wrap around metal arms 158 prevent the transverse wires 112 from separating when the cable trays 110 are loaded. The sidewall joiner bracket 130 also includes a press-in spacer clip 160. The press-in spacer clip 160 is a separate stamped metal part. The press-in spacer clip 160 includes a body 162 with a thru hole 168, an upper spacer tab 170 and a lower spacer tab 172. The upper and lower spacer tabs 170, 172 extend horizontally from the upper and lower edges 164, 166 of the body 162, respectively. As illustrated in FIGS. 6 and 7, the upper and lower spacer tabs 170, 172 of the press-in spacer clip 160 are installed in upper and lower windows 142, 144 in the main body 132 of the sidewall joiner bracket 130. The press fit holds the spacer clip 160 in place thereby eliminating the need for welding. As illustrated in FIGS. 4, 6 and 7, a bonding screw 174 is installed in the sidewall joiner bracket 130. The bonding screw 174 passes through the thru hole 168 in the press-in spacer clip 160 and threads into the hole 148 in the main body 132 of the sidewall joiner bracket 130. When the sidewall joiner bracket 130 is installed on two adjacent cable tray sections 110, the bonding screw 174 is tightened to provide electrical continuity between the cable tray sections 110 by cutting through the powder coating and into the metal of each transverse wire 112. As illustrated in FIG. 4, the sidewall joiner bracket 130 contains the transverse wires 112, the side longitudinal wire 122 and the bottom longitudinal wire 124. FIGS. 8-11 illustrate the center position joiner bracket 180. The center position joiner bracket 180 is used in connection with the sidewall joiner bracket 130 to stabilize and strengthen the middle portion of the cable tray sections 110. The center position joiner bracket 180 further enhances the connection made by the sidewall joiner brackets 130 when joining two adjacent cable tray sections 110. Typically, the center positioned joiner bracket 180 is used on wider sections of cable tray, for example 24″ or 30″ wide, to prevent deflection at the center of the cable trays. FIG. 10 illustrates a front view of the center position joiner bracket 180. The center position joiner bracket 180 includes a main body 182 with a top edge 186 and a bottom edge 188. The top edge 186 is folded over for added strength. Two notches 192 are formed in the top edge 186 near the center 184 of the center position joiner bracket 180. The notches 192 create a retention area for the transverse wires 112 (see FIGS. 8 and 9). The bottom edge 188 extends away from the front of the main body 182. The bottom edge 188 provides additional strength to the center position joiner bracket 180. Alternatively, as illustrated in FIG. 10a, the center position joiner bracket 180a may include one notch 192a formed in the top edge 186a of the center position joiner bracket 180a. The notch 192a creates a retention zone for the transverse wires 112 of adjacent cable trays. The center position joiner bracket 180a with the single notch 192a facilitates manufacturing and installation of the center position bracket 180a. As illustrated in FIG. 11, the center position joiner bracket 180 also includes a plurality of formed tabs 194, 196 extending away from the front of the center position joiner bracket 180. A tab 194 extends from each side 190 of the center position joiner bracket 180. Two main body tabs 196 also extend from the main body 182. The main body tabs 196 are positioned such that one main body tab 196 is between the notched area 192 and each side edge 190 of the center position joiner bracket 180. The side tabs 194, main body tabs 196 and the top edge 186 create a space that accepts longitudinal wires 120 of the cable tray sections 110 (see FIG. 9). A tight fit between the longitudinal wires 120 and the side tabs 194, main body tabs 196 and top edge 186 provide rigidity for the center position joiner bracket 180. The center position joiner bracket 180 also includes a formed spring arm 198 extending from the bottom edge 188. The formed spring arm 198 includes a first member 198a extending generally upwards away from the main body 182 and a second member 198b angled downwardly towards the main body 182. The formed spring arm 198 provides a pre-load and holds the center position joiner bracket 180 in place. To install the center position joiner brackets 180, the formed spring arm 198 is deflected to allow a longitudinal wire 120 to snap into place under the top edge 186 and above the main body tabs 196 and the side tabs 194. The transverse wires 112 are positioned in the retention areas formed by the notches 192 in the top edge 186 of the center position joiner bracket 180 (see FIG. 9). The transverse wires 112 are also positioned on the formed spring arm 198. FIG. 12 illustrates a cable tray section with a plurality of snap-in sidewalls 200. The snap-in sidewalls 200 are designed to be installed anywhere along the length of the cable tray section 110 where cable retention or containment is necessary. As illustrated in FIGS. 13-14, each snap-in sidewall 200 consists of a wire support arm 202 and a sheet metal base 204. The wire support arm 202 is completely rounded with no sharp edges. The rounded wire support arm 202 provides cable protection for the cables routed on the cable trays 110. The wire support arms 202 also provide strength without adding additional weight to the cable tray cable routing system 100. The wire support arm 202 is comfortable to handle and install on the cable trays 110. The wire support arm 202 is designed to be inserted into formed loops 210 of the sheet metal base 204. Once the wire support arm 202 is installed in the formed loops 210 in the base 204, the formed loops 210 are attached via a standard crimping or welding process to hold the wire support arm 202 in place and provide a secure attachment for the wire support arm 202. The sheet metal base 204 is formed as a single piece with a back surface 206 and a front surface 208. The sheet metal base 204 includes upper clips 212, lower tabs 214, latches 216 and a recessed area 218. As illustrated in FIGS. 15 and 16, the upper clips 212 engage and latch onto the side longitudinal wires 122 of the cable trays 110. The lower tabs 214 engage and latch onto the bottom longitudinal wires 124 of the cable trays 110. The latches 216 deflect during installation and then retain the side longitudinal wires 122 to prevent accidental removal of the snap-in sidewall 200. The latches 216 are designed to be overcome with moderate force so that the snap-in sidewall 200 can be pulled up and off of the cable tray 110 when removal of the sidewall 200 is necessary. The sheet metal base 204 is designed to snap-on to the sides 118 of the cable tray 110 at any point where cable retention is necessary. As illustrated in FIG. 17, the snap-in sidewall 200 is snapped on the cable tray 110 such that it is positioned between two transverse wires 112 of the cable tray 110. Alternatively, the snap-in sidewall 200 may be snapped on the cable tray 110 such that one transverse wire 112 is positioned in the recessed area 218 at the center of the base 204. FIGS. 18-21 illustrate the cable tray 110 with a side spill down 220. The side spill down 220 is attached at the sidewall 118 of the cable tray 110 for routing cables over the side of the cable tray 110. The side spill down 220 is a molded plastic device. The side spill down 220 includes a top surface 222, a vertical bend radius 224, horizontal bend radius 226 and bend radius pillars 228. The bend radius pillars 228 provide strength and stability when cable bundles are routed along the top surface 222 of the side spill down 220. As illustrated in FIG. 20, the side spill down 220 also includes molded-in plastic ribs 230, cored out areas 232 for plastic latches and molded-in plastic latches 234. The molded-in plastic ribs 230 engage the side longitudinal wire 122 and the bottom longitudinal wire 124 when the side spill down 220 is snapped on to the cable tray 110. The molded-in plastic latches 234 deflect and snap back into place over the side longitudinal wire 122 to secure the side spill down 220 on the cable tray 110 (see FIG. 19). As illustrated in FIGS. 18, 19 and 21, the top surface 222 of the side spill down 220 rests on the transverse wires 112 of the cable tray 110. FIG. 21 illustrates a cable bundle routed along the cable tray section 110 and over the side spill down 220. The side spill down 220 enables the cable bundle to be routed around the horizontal bend radius 226 and down the vertical bend radius 224 over the side of the cable tray thereby maintaining the required bend radius for protecting the cable bundle. FIG. 22 illustrates a cable tray section 110 with a drop down waterfall device 250 attached thereto. The drop down waterfall device 250 is installed within the cable tray to enable cables routed in the cable tray 110 to drop down within the tray. The drop down waterfall device 250 provides bend radius protection for the cables dropping from the cable tray 110. FIGS. 23-26 illustrate the drop down waterfall device 250 prior to installation on the cable tray. The drop down waterfall device 250 includes two stamped metal parts, an outer shell 252 and an inner core 270. The outer shell 252 is partially cylindrical with a cut-out notch 260 at each end 254. The cut-out notches 260 prevent the drop down waterfall device 250 from rotating when installed on the cable tray 110. The partially cylindrical outer shell 252 folds over at the bottom 258 of each side 256 to form generally L-shaped legs 262. The legs 262 include a horizontal member 264 and a downwardly extending vertical member 266. The legs 262 of the outer shell 252 are formed to mate with the legs 284 of the inner core 270 when the outer shell 252 and the inner core 270 are assembled together. FIG. 23 a illustrates an alternative drop down waterfall device 250a with an outer shell 252a and an inner core 270a. The outer shell 252a and the inner core 270a of the alternative drop down waterfall device 250a include mating flanges 263 and 285, respectively (see FIGS. 25a, 26a and 27a). The mating flanges 263 and 285 have been designed to simplify the manufacturing of the drop down waterfall device 250a. The inner core 270 includes a metal loop 272 with latch snaps 280 at the top 274 of the metal loop 272 and a plurality of retention tabs 282 extending from the base 276. The sides 278 of the base 276 fold over to form generally L-shaped legs 284. The legs 284 include a horizontal member 286 and a downwardly extending vertical member 288. As illustrated in FIG. 27, the legs 284 of the inner core 270 mate with the legs 262 of the outer shell 252 and may be welded together to create a single part. The metal loop 272 is designed to fit over a transverse wire 112 of the cable tray 110 and the latch snaps 280 are designed to snap on to the transverse wire 112 of the cable tray to hold the inner core 270 in place. The retention tabs 282 extend outwardly and upwardly from the base 276. The retention tabs 282 include a first member 282a, a second member 282b and a third member 282c. The inner core 270a of the alternative drop down waterfall device 250a is illustrated in FIG. 25a. The inner core 270a includes a top portion with metal loops 272a that are downwardly facing U-shaped loops for engaging the transverse wire 112 of the cable tray. The inner core 270a also includes latch snaps or offset retaining arms 280a for engaging a transverse wire 112 of the cable tray. The offset retaining arms 280a include a generally semi-circular upper portion. The offset retaining arms 280a have a greater interference with the transverse wire 112 than the latch snaps 280 illustrated in FIG. 25. The additional interference increases the pre-load and provides a more secure fit to the cable tray. Each end of the inner core 270a includes longitudinal wire retaining latches 283 that extend upwardly and outwardly from the base 276a. The longitudinal wire retaining latches 283 include a first member 283a, a second member 283b and a third member 283c. The third member 283c includes a chamfered edge 283d (see FIG. 27a) that allows for clearance between the longitudinal wire retaining latches 283 and the outer shell 252a during installation. A mating flange 285 extends downwardly from each side 278a of the base 276a. Each mating flange 285 extends at an angle towards the center of the inner core 270a. FIG. 26 illustrates the outer shell 252 and the inner core 270 positioned for assembly together. The inner core 270 is slid into the outer shell 252 with the legs 284 of the inner core 270 positioned on the legs 262 of the outer shell 252 as illustrated in FIGS. 23 and 27. FIG. 26 a illustrates the outer shell 252a and the inner core 270a positioned for assembly together. The outer shell 252a includes sides 256a with bottoms 258a that lead to the mating flanges 263. The mating flanges 263 are generally V-shaped. As illustrated in FIG. 27a, the mating flanges 285 of the inner core 270a and the mating flanges 263 of the outer shell 252a are welded together to create a single part. Additionally, as illustrated in FIG. 28, the third member 282c of the retention tabs 282 engage longitudinal wires 120 of the cable tray 110 to provide a pre-load to hold the drop down waterfall device 220 in place. FIG. 29 illustrates perpendicular cable tray sections 110 that intersect and are joined by intersect joiner brackets 300. FIGS. 30-32 illustrate the intersect joiner bracket 300. The intersect joiner bracket 300 includes a joiner 302, a securing clip 330 and a bonding screw 344. The joiner 302 includes two sides 304 and a bottom 306. The bottom 306 includes a front 320 with an upwardly extending tab 322 and a hole 324 (see FIG. 32) for receiving the bonding screw 344. The sides 304 extend upward from the bottom 306 to form the joiner 302. Each side 304 includes inwardly extending side latches 308 for engaging the bottom longitudinal wire 124 of a cable tray section 110. Each side 304 also includes a plurality of tabs 310, 311 for preventing the cable tray 110 from sliding. Each side 304 also includes an opening 312 for engaging the side longitudinal wire 122 of a cable tray section 110 and a notch 314 for engaging the bottom longitudinal wire 124 of a cable tray section 110. Finally, the back of each side 304 includes an outwardly extending flange 316. The securing clip 330 includes a bottom 332 with a hole 338 for receiving the bonding screw 344 and a tab 340 extending upwardly from the back 334 of the securing clip 330. The securing clip 330 also includes wings 342 extending upwardly from the sides 336 of the securing clip 330. The wings 342 engage the sides 304 of the joiner 302 when the intersect joiner bracket 300 is assembled. FIG. 30 a illustrates an alternative intersect joiner bracket 300a. The alternative intersect joiner bracket 300a includes a joiner 302a, a securing clip 330a and a thread cutting bonding screw 344a. The alternative joiner 302a includes side latches 308a that are L-shaped. The side latches 308a deflect towards the center of the joiner 302a thereby enabling the joiner 300a to contain the bottom longitudinal wire of the cable tray. The alternative securing clip 330a includes a bottom 332a with upwardly extending wings 342a. Each wing 342a includes a U-shaped slot 343 designed to receive a bottom longitudinal wire of the cable tray. The securing clip 330a also includes a tab or strengthening flange 340a positioned at the front of the securing clip 330a. As illustrated in FIGS. 31 and 32, the bonding screw 344 is only partially threaded into the hole 324 in the joiner 302. As described below, once the intersect joiner bracket 300 is installed on the intersecting cable trays, the bonding screw 344 is tightened. FIGS. 33-38 illustrate the installation process of the intersect joiner bracket 300 on intersecting cable trays 110. As illustrated in FIG. 33, the intersect joiner bracket 300 is positioned to be inserted at an angle between the side longitudinal wire 122 and the bottom longitudinal wire 124 of a first cable tray. FIG. 34 illustrates the intersect joiner bracket 300 hooked under the side longitudinal wire 122 such that the side longitudinal wire 122 is positioned in the openings 312 in the sides 304 of the joiner 302. Next, the intersect joiner bracket 300 is rotated downward towards the bottom longitudinal wire 124 such that the bottom longitudinal wire 124 is positioned in the notches 314 of the sides 304 of the joiner (see FIG. 35). FIG. 35 illustrates a second intersecting cable tray 110 positioned to be installed in the intersect joiner bracket 300. The second cable tray 110 is dropped down into the joiner 302. FIG. 35 also illustrates a transverse wire 112 of the first cable tray positioned adjacent tab 310. FIG. 36 illustrates the second cable tray 110 seated in the intersect joiner bracket 300. The side latches 308 deflect as the second cable tray 110 is dropped into place in the joiner 302. After the second cable tray 110 is installed, the side latches 308 flex back into the original position to secure the bottom longitudinal wire 124 of the second cable tray 110. The bonding screw 344 is then tightened to drive the securing clip 330 up to engage the bottom longitudinal wire 124 of the first cable tray 110 thereby clamping the joiner 302 in position. The bonding screw 344 cuts into the bottom longitudinal wire 124 of the first and second cable trays to provide electrical continuity (see FIGS. 37 and 38). FIGS. 37 and 38 illustrate the intersect joiner bracket 300 completely installed on the intersecting first and second cable trays. Typically, an intersect joiner bracket 300 is installed at each side of the second cable tray to secure the second cable tray to the first cable tray (see FIG. 29). However, one or more intersect joiner brackets 300 may also be used to reinforce the middle of the intersecting cable trays. Additionally, the intersect joiner bracket 300 may be installed and adjusted between the transverse wires 112 of the first cable tray or the intersect joiner bracket 300 may be installed to straddle a transverse wire 112 of the first cable tray. FIG. 37 a illustrates the alternative intersect joiner bracket 300a (see FIG. 30a) installed on a cable tray. The bottom longitudinal wire 124 of the cable tray is positioned within the U-shaped slot 343 of the securing clip 330a. The bonding screw 344a is tightened to drive the securing clip 330a up to hold the bottom longitudinal wire 124 of the cable tray firmly in place. The bonding screw 344a effectively cuts the bottom longitudinal wire 124 of the cable tray to provide electrical continuity. FIGS. 39-44 illustrate the corner radius device 350 used with the cable tray cable routing system 100 to provide bend radius control to cables routed along intersecting cable tray sections. FIG. 39 illustrates intersecting cable tray sections 110 that are joined by intersect joiner brackets 300. A corner radius device 350 is positioned along each side of the intersecting cable trays to provide a bend radius for a T-fitting configuration. Although a T-fitting configuration is illustrated, the corner radius device may be used on various cable tray configurations where bend radius is required. The corner radius device 350 includes two sidewall attachments 352 and a wire corner element 384. FIGS. 40-44 illustrate the sidewall attachments 352 of the corner radius device 350. Each sidewall attachment 352 includes a wire form post 354, an upper sidewall piece 356, a bottom sidewall piece 370, a bolt 366 and a wing nut 367. The wire form post 354 is similar to the wire support arm 202 of the snap-in sidewalls 200 illustrated in FIGS. 12-17. The wire from post 354 is completely rounded with no sharp edges. The rounded wire form post 354 provides cable protection for the cables routed on the cable trays 110. The wire form post 354 is designed to be inserted into side formed loops 360, 376 of the upper sidewall piece 356 and the bottom sidewall piece 370, respectively. Once the wire form post 354 is installed in the formed loops 360, 376, the formed loops 360, 376 are attached via a standard crimping or welding process to hold the wire form post 354 in place. The upper sidewall piece 356 also includes an upper formed loop 358 and a lower formed loop 362. The upper formed loop 358 captures the upper wire 392 of the wire corner element 384 and the lower formed loop 362 captures the lower wire 394 of the wire corner element 384 (see FIG. 43). The lower formed loop 362 also includes a hole 364 for receiving the bolt 366, which tightens the sidewall attachment 352 onto the wire corner element 384. The tabs 368 along the sides 359 of the upper sidewall piece 356 extend outward forming a channel 369 to contain the wire form post 354 when the sidewall attachment 352 is assembled. The bottom sidewall piece 370 is similar to the base 204 of the snap-in sidewalls 200 illustrated in FIGS. 12-17. The bottom sidewall piece 370 is formed as a single piece with a back surface 372 and a front surface 374. The bottom sidewall piece 370 includes side formed loops 376, upper clips 378, lower tabs 380, latches 382 and a recessed area 383. The upper clips 378 engage and latch onto the side longitudinal wires 122 of the cable trays 110. The lower tabs 380 engage and latch onto the bottom longitudinal wires 124 of the cable trays 110. The latches 382 retain the side longitudinal wires 122 to prevent accidental removal of the bottom sidewall piece 370. The latches 382 are designed to be overcome with moderate force so that the sidewall attachment 352 and attached wire corner element 384 can be pulled up and off of the cable tray 110 when removal of the corner radius device 350 is necessary. Alternatively, as illustrated in FIGS. 41a and 42a, the sidewall attachment 352a includes a wire form post 354a, an upper sidewall piece 356a and a bottom sidewall piece 370a. The wire form post 354a is completely rounded with no sharp edges. The rounded wire form post 354a provides cable protection for the cables routed on the cable trays 110. The upper sidewall piece 356a is bead welded to the upper portion of the wire form post 354a. The bottom portion of the wire form post 354a is designed to be inserted into side formed loops 376a of the bottom sidewall piece 370a. Once the wire form post 354a is installed in the formed loops 376a, the formed loops 376a are clamped or welded to hold the wire form post 354a in place. The upper sidewall piece 356a includes an upper formed loop or upper retaining feature 358a and a lower formed loop or lower retaining feature 362a. The upper formed loop 358a captures the top wire 386b of the wire corner element 384b and the lower formed loop 362a captures the lower wire 394b of the wire corner element 384b (see FIG. 43b). The bottom sidewall piece 370a is formed as a single piece with a back surface 372a and a front surface 374a. The bottom sidewall piece 370a includes side formed loops 376a, upper clips 378a, lower tabs 380a and latches 382a. The upper clips 378a engage and latch onto the side longitudinal wires 122 of the cable trays 110. The lower tabs 380a engage and latch onto the bottom longitudinal wires 124 of the cable trays 110. The latches 382a retain the side longitudinal wires 122 to prevent accidental removal of the bottom sidewall piece 370a. The latches 382a are designed to be overcome with moderate force so that the sidewall attachment 352a and attached wire corner element 384b can be pulled up and off of the cable tray 110 when removal of the corner radius device 350a is necessary. Once the sidewall attachment 352 is assembled, it may be installed on the wire corner element 384. As illustrated in FIG. 43, the wire corner element 384 includes a top wire 386, side wires 388 and a bottom wire 390. An upper wire 392 and a lower wire 394 extend between side wires 388. The wire corner element 384 also includes a plurality of wires 396 that extend from the top wire 386 to the bottom wire 390. Alternatively, as illustrated in FIG. 43a, the wire corner element 384a may include a top wire 386a, side wires 388a, an upper wire 392a, a lower wire 394a and cross wires 396a. FIG. 43 b illustrates the corner radius device 350a with an alternative wire corner element 384b and sidewall attachments 352a (see FIGS. 41a and 42a). The wire corner element 384b includes a top wire 386b, side wires 388b, an upper wire 392b, a lower wire 394b and cross wires 396b. The wire corner element 384b can be welded in a single operation and then bent 90 degrees to form the wire corner element 384b. The cross wires 396b are longer at the bottom of the wire corner element 384b so that they protrude past the transverse wires of the cable tray. The longer cross wires 396b are designed to prevent cables from passing under the cable tray when routed past the corner radius device 350a. As discussed above, the upper formed loop 358 engages the upper wire 392 and the lower formed loop 362 engages the lower wire 394. The bolt 366 and wing nut 367 secure the sidewall attachment 352 to the wire corner element 384. If desired, the wing nuts 367 are loosened to enable the sidewall attachment 352 to slide along the upper and lower wires 392, 394 to the proper location to facilitate easy installation to the junction formed by intersecting cable trays 110. Once the sidewall attachments 352 are positioned on the wire corner element 384 and the wing nuts 367 are tightened, the sidewall attachments 352 are snapped onto the cable trays 110. The bottom sidewall piece 370 of the sidewall attachment 352 is designed to snap on to the sides of the cable tray 110 at any point, where desired. As illustrated in FIGS. 39 and 44, one sidewall attachment 352 is snapped on the cable tray 110 such that the bottom sidewall piece 370 is positioned between two transverse wires 112 of the cable tray 110. A second sidewall attachment 352 is snapped on the cable tray 110 such that one transverse wire 112 is positioned in the recessed area 383 at the center of the bottom sidewall piece 370. FIGS. 45-51 illustrate the trapeze bracket 400 with a threaded rod 402 for connecting the overhead cable tray cable routing system 100 to a ceiling member (not illustrated). A first end 404 of the threaded rod 402 is secured to the trapeze bracket 400 and a second end (not illustrated) of the threaded rod 402 would be secured to a ceiling member (not illustrated). The trapeze bracket 400 includes a channel 406 with a bottom 408 and sidewalls 410. Preconfigured mounting holes 416 may extend along the bottom 408 of the channel 406 for receiving the threaded rod 402. The sidewalls 410 include an inwardly extending top portion 420 that forms a generally J-shape. A center portion of the channel 406 also includes top forms 422 that extend from the J-shape top portion 420 of the sidewalls 410. The top forms 422 are designed to support the center of the cable tray 110 as illustrated in FIG. 45. Each top form 422 includes a top surface 424 that contacts the bottom of the cable tray 110 and inwardly extending flanges 426. Each end 414 of the trapeze bracket 400 has a pre-installed locking clip 430. Once the cable tray 110 is positioned on the trapeze bracket 400, the locking clips 430 are slid to engage the bottom longitudinal wire 124 of the sidewall 118 of the cable tray 110 (See FIG. 48). The locking clip 430 includes a bottom 432 with sidewalls 434 extending therefrom. Each sidewall 434 includes a hook 436 for engaging the bottom longitudinal wire 124 of the cable tray 110. The locking clip 430 slides toward the cable tray 110 until the hooks 436 engage the bottom longitudinal wire 124. A clamp screw 438 secures the locking clip 430 to the trapeze bracket 400 and the cable tray 110. The clamp screw 438 is threaded into the locking clip 430 at the bottom of the locking clip 430. The clamp screw 438 is offset so that the clamp screw 438 will not line up with the threaded rod mounting holes 416 in the channel 406 of the trapeze bracket 400. When the clamp screw 438 is tightened, the clamp screw 438 drives against the bottom 408 of the trapeze bracket 400 to pull the locking clip 430 down to secure the cable tray 110 to the trapeze bracket 400. FIGS. 52-59 illustrate the cantilever wall mount bracket 450 for the cable tray cable routing system 100. The cantilever wall mount bracket 450 provides support for the cable tray 110 that is routed parallel to a wall. FIG. 52 illustrates the cantilever wall mount bracket 450 with a section of cable tray 110. FIGS. 53 and 54 illustrate the cantilevered wall mount bracket 450. The cantilevered wall mount bracket 450 includes a back wall 452 and a sidewall 460 extending outwardly from one side 454 of the back wall 452. Each side 454 of the back wall 452 includes a locking tab 456 that defines a slot 457 for receiving the bottom longitudinal wire 124 of one sidewall 118 of a cable tray section 110. The slot 457 may be horizontal, as illustrated, or angled. The back wall 452 also includes key hole mount slots 458 for enabling the cantilevered wall mount bracket 450 to be quickly mounted to a wall. The outwardly extending sidewall 460 includes formed ribs 464 positioned along the outwardly extending sidewall 460 for providing strength to the cantilevered wall mount bracket 450. A strengthening lip 466 is positioned along the edges of the outwardly extending sidewall 460. The front end 462 of the outwardly extending sidewall 460 includes a formed area 468 designed to receive a locking clip 480 similar to the locking clips 430 used with the trapeze bracket 400 (see FIGS. 45-51). The formed area 468 at the front end 462 includes a channel 470 with a bottom 472 and sidewalls 474 extending upwardly therefrom. Each sidewall 474 may include a locking tab 476 designed to engage the bottom longitudinal wire 124 of an opposite sidewall 118 of the cable tray section 110 (see FIG. 52). Alternatively, the sidewall 474 may have a square end with no under-cut slot (not illustrated). FIG. 55 illustrates the cantilevered wall mount bracket 450 and the locking clip 480. The locking clip 480 includes a bottom 482 with sidewalls 484 extending therefrom. Each sidewall 484 includes a hook 486. The locking clip 480 slides onto the front end 462 of the cantilever wall mount bracket 450. A clamp screw 488 installed at the bottom 482 of the locking clip 480 is tightened to secure the locking clip 480 in place. As illustrated in FIG. 56, the front locking tabs 476 of the formed area 468 and the hooks 486 of the locking clip 480 extend in opposite directions. As a result, when a cable tray section 110 is installed on the cantilevered wall mount bracket 450, the bottom longitudinal wire 124 of one sidewall 118 of the cable tray 110 is positioned between the locking tabs 476 and the hooks 486. FIGS. 56-59 illustrate a cable tray section 110 being installed on a cantilevered wall mount bracket 450. FIG. 56 illustrates a section of the cable tray 110 positioned to be installed on a cantilevered wall mount bracket 450. The section of cable tray 110 is positioned such that the bottom longitudinal wires 124 of each sidewall 118 are aligned with an opening between the hooks 486 of the locking clip 480 and the front locking tabs 476 and an opening in front of the back locking tabs 456. FIG. 57 illustrates the section of cable tray 110 positioned on the cantilevered wall mount bracket 450. The cable tray 110 is positioned above the strengthening lip 466 extending from the top edge of the outwardly extending sidewall 460. The strengthening lip 466 supports the cable tray 110 when loaded. One bottom longitudinal wire 124 is positioned in the opening between the hooks 486 of the locking clip 480 and the front locking tabs 476 and the other bottom longitudinal wire 124 is positioned in the opening in front of the back locking tabs 456. To secure the cantilevered wall mount bracket 450 to the cable tray section 110, the cable tray section 110 is pushed toward the back wall 452 of the cantilevered wall mount bracket 450. As illustrated in FIG. 58, one of the bottom longitudinal wires 124 slides under the back locking tabs 456. Thus, the back locking tabs 456 hold the bottom longitudinal wire 124 of one sidewall 118 of the cable tray 110. Next, the locking clip 480 is slid towards the back wall 452 of the cantilevered wall mount bracket 450. As illustrated in FIG. 59, the hooks 486 of the locking clip 480 and the front locking tabs 476 engage the bottom longitudinal wire 124 at the opposite sidewall 118 of the cable tray 110. The clamp screw 488 is tightened to pull the locking clip 480 down and secure the cable tray section 110. FIGS. 60-62 illustrate a wall termination bracket 500 mounted to a 12″ wide cable tray section and intended to be mounted to a wall. The wall termination bracket 500 provides additional support for the cable trays. In some applications, the cable tray needs to be attached at the wall for support. In other applications, the cable tray may need to be supported at the wall because cables are passing through the wall. FIG. 63 illustrates the wall termination bracket 500 and FIGS. 64-66 illustrate the slide clamp 530 used to secure the wall termination bracket 500 to the cable tray 110. The wall termination bracket 500 is generally L-shaped with a top member 502 and a back member 504. The top member 502 includes turned over edges 508 extending from ends 506 and the back member 504 includes turned over edges 518 extending from ends 516 to provide greater strength for the wall termination bracket 500. The back member 504 also includes a plurality of wall mount slots 520 for receiving a fastener to attach the wall termination bracket 500 to a wall. The top member 502 also includes a plurality of slide clamp slots 510 for receiving slide clamps 530 to attach the wall termination bracket 500 to the cable tray 110. The slide clamp slots 510 are generally t-shaped with a wide middle portion 512 and narrow end portions 514. The wide middle portion 512 of the slide clamp slots 510 allows the slide clamps 530 to fit on the wall termination bracket 500. The narrow end portions 514 of the slide clamp slots 510 enable the slide clamps 530 to be captured when slid towards the end portions 514. As illustrated in FIGS. 64-66, each slide clamp 530 includes a main body 532, a pemsert 546 and a tightening screw 548. The main body 532 is U-shaped with the pemsert 546 extending downwardly from the bottom 536 of the main body 532. The main body 532 also includes a hole 538 extending through the top 534 and bottom 536 for receiving the tightening screw 548 there through. Two lead-in edges 540 extend upwardly from the top 534 of the main body 532. The lead-in edges 540 form a notch 542 for receiving a longitudinal wire 120 of the cable tray 110. A tongue 544 extends downwardly from the main body 532. The tongue 544 is positioned between the lead-in edges 540. The tongue 544 fits into the slide clamp slots 510 in the wall termination bracket 500. The tongue 544 enables the slide clamp 530 to slide back and forth in the slide clamp slot 510. As the screw 548 is tightened, the U-shape main body 532 of the slide clamp 530 deflects and clamps onto the wall termination bracket 500 and longitudinal wires 120 thereby securing the slide clamp 530 and cable tray 110 in place. The tongue 544 also prevents the slide clamp 530 from turning when the screw 548 is tightened to further secure the slide clamp 530 and the wall termination bracket 500 to the cable tray 110. FIGS. 67-69 illustrate the process of installing the cable tray 110 on the wall termination bracket 500. FIG. 67 illustrates the cable tray section 110 positioned to be installed on the wall termination bracket 500. The cable tray 110 is positioned so the bottom of the cable tray 110 is positioned on the top 502 of the wall termination bracket 500. As illustrated in FIG. 68, the longitudinal wires 120 of the cable tray 110 are positioned on the top 502 of the wall termination bracket 500. The slide clamps 530 are positioned adjacent to the longitudinal wires 120. The slide clamps 530 are slid toward an adjacent longitudinal wire 120 until the longitudinal wires 120 are positioned in the notches 542 of the lead-in edges 540 of the slide clamps 530. Once the slide clamps 530 have been positioned, each bolt 548 is tightened to secure the cable tray 110 in place (see FIG. 69). Alternatively, FIGS. 70-72 illustrate wall termination brackets 550 mounted to a wider cable tray section. Typically, the alternative wall termination bracket 550 is used for 18″, 24″ or 30″ wide cable trays. The alternative wall termination bracket 550 includes two identical bracket pieces 550a, 550b that are mounted a distance apart. As illustrated in FIGS. 70-72, a bracket piece 550a, 550b is positioned adjacent each sidewall 118 of a wider cable tray section 110. The two identical bracket pieces 550a, 550b are similar to the wall termination bracket 500 illustrated in FIGS. 60-63. Each bracket piece 550a, 550b includes a top member 552a, 552b and a back member 554a, 554b. The top member 552a, 552b includes turned over edges 558a, 558b and slide clamp slots 560a, 560b. The back member 554a, 554b includes turned over edges 568a, 568b and mounting slots 570a, 570b.
