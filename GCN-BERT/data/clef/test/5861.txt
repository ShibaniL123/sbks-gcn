Preparation of trans-2-chloro-5-(2,2-dichloro-3-(3,5-dichlorophenyl)cyclopropane-1-carboxamido)-N-(2,4-difluoro-3-methoxyphenyl)benzamide (F1171)
trans-2-Chloro-5-(2,2-dichloro-3-(3,5-dichlorophenyl)cyclopropane-1-carboxamido)benzoic acid (C12) (0.1 g, 0.22 mmol) as a slurry in toluene (2 mL) was treated with oxalyl chloride (0.0.097 mL. 1.1 mmol) and a single drop of N,N-dimethylformamide with stirring at room temperature. After the mixture became homogeneous and gas evolution ceased, the solution was concentrated to a clear oil and then cooled in an ice bath under nitrogen. 2,4-Difluoro-3-methoxyaniline (0.035 g, 0.22 mmol) was added as a solution in pyridine (2 mL) with stirring and the reaction mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature and stir overnight. An aliquot was removed and diluted with dimethyl sulfoxide and examined by liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy which indicated a mixture of the desired product and starting carboxylic acid. The reaction mixture was partitioned between ethyl acetate and aqueous hydrochloric acid (1 N), the layers were separated, and the organic phase was dried over sodium sulfate. Purification by flash silica gel chromatography (3:1 hexane-ethyl acetate) gave the title compound as a green-tinted solid (0.075 g, 57%).
