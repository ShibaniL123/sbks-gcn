Preparation of compound 38-e.
Compound 38-f (460 mg, 2.75 mmol) and triphenylphosphine (1.08 g, 4.12 mmol) were dissolved in anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (10 mL). The reaction mixture was cooled to 0Â°C and diisopropyl azodicarboxylate (838 mg, 4.15 mmol) was slowly added dropwise. After the addition, the reaction mixturewas slowly warmed to room temperature and the stirring was continued for 16 hours. The reaction mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure and the residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (petroleum ether: ethyl acetate = 5: 1) to delivera pale brown solid 38-e (190 mg, yield: 46%).
