Botanical designation: Thuja occidentalis. Cultivar denomination: ‘ANNA van VLOTEN’. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a new and distinct cultivar of Thuja plant, botanically known as Thuja occidentalis, commonly known as American Arborvitae and hereinafter referred to by the name ‘Anna van Vloten’. The new Thuja plant is a naturally-occurring branch mutation of Thuja occidentalis ‘Danica’, not patented. The new Thuja plant was discovered and selected by the Inventor in 1993 on a single plant of ‘Danica’ in a controlled outdoor nursery environment in Abbotsford, British Columbia, Canada. Asexual reproduction of the new Thuja plant by hardwood cuttings in a controlled environment in Abbotsford, British Columbia, Canada since October, 2000 has shown that the unique features of this new Thuja plant are stable and reproduced true to type in successive generations. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Plants of the new Thuja have not been observed under all possible environmental conditions and cultural practices. The phenotype may vary somewhat with variations in environmental conditions such as temperature and light intensity without, however, any variance in genotype. The following traits have been repeatedly observed and are determined to be the unique characteristics of ‘Anna van Vloten’. These characteristics in combination distinguish ‘Anna van Vloten’ as a new and distinct Thuja plant: 1. Compact and upright plant habit; rounded plant form.2. Moderately vigorous growth habit; moderate growth rate.3. Dense and bushy form.4. Bright yellow green-colored leaves; bright yellow green coloration maintained during the winter.5. Good winter hardiness and wind resistance. Plants of the new Thuja can be compared to plants of the female parent, ‘Danica’. Plants of the new Thuja differ primarily from plants of ‘Danica’ in the leaf color as plants of ‘Danica’ have green-colored leaves. Plants of the new Thuja can be compared to plants of Thuja occidentalis, ‘Filips Magic Moment’, disclosed in U.S. Plant Pat. No. 21,974. In side-by-side comparisons conducted in Abbotsford, British Columbia, Canada, plants of the new Thuja differed primarily from plants of ‘Filips Magic Moment’ in the following characteristics: 1. Plants of the new Thuja were rounded in plant form whereas plants of ‘Filips Magic Moment’ were conical in plant form.2. Plants of the new Thuja were more vigorous than plants of ‘Filips Magic Moment’. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE PHOTOGRAPH The accompanying colored photograph illustrates the overall appearance of the new Thuja plant showing the colors as true as it is reasonably possible to obtain in colored reproductions of this type. Colors in the photograph may differ slightly from the color values cited in the detailed botanical description which accurately describe the colors of the new Thuja plant. The photograph comprises a side perspective view of a typical plant of ‘Anna van Vloten’. DETAILED BOTANICAL DESCRIPTION The aforementioned photograph and following observations, measurements and values describe plants grown during the summer in ground beds in an outdoor nursery in Grand Haven, Mich. and under cultural practices typical of commercial Thuja plant production. Plants were two years old when the photograph and description were taken. In the following detailed description, color references are made to The Royal Horticultural Society Colour Chart, 2001 Edition, except where general terms of ordinary dictionary significance are used. Botanical classification: Thuja occidentalis ‘Anna van Vloten’.Parentage: Naturally-occurring branch mutation of Thuja occidentalis ‘Danica’, not patented.Propagation: Type.—By hardwood cuttings.Time to initiate roots, winter.—About five months at temperatures about 18° C.Time to produce rooted young plants, winter.—About two years at temperatures about 20° C.Root description.—Fine, fibrous; brown and white in color.Rooting habit.—Freely branching; dense.Plant description: Plant and growth habit.—Perennial evergreen shrub; compact and upright plant habit and rounded plant form; moderately vigorous growth habit; moderate growth rate.Plant height.—About 22 cm.Plant diameter, base.—About 46 cm.Branching habit.—Freely branching habit with about 25 lateral branches developing per plant; dense and bushy habit.Lateral branch description.—Length: About 15 cm.
