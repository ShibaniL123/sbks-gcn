METHODS FOR TREATING CANCERS USING ORAL FORMULATIONS OF CYTIDINE ANALOGS [0001] The present application is a divisional application from Australian patent application number 2012318239, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. [0001a] This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/554,344, filed November 1, 2011, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. I. FIELD [0002] Provided herein are methods for treating, preventing, or managing cancers using a cytidine analog, or a salt, solvate, or hydrate thereof. Also provided are methods for using a cytidine analog, or a salt, solvate, or hydrate thereof, to treat, prevent, or manage diseases and disorders including disorders related to abnormal cell proliferation, hematologic disorders, and immune disorders, among others. In certain of the methods, the cytidine analog is formulated in an oral dosage form and administered orally. In certain of the methods, the cytidine analog is administered alone or in combination with one or more anti-cancer agents. II. BACKGROUND [0003] Cancer is a major worldwide public health problem; in the United States alone, approximately 570,000 cancer-related deaths were expected in 2005. See, e.g., Jemal et al, CACancer J. Clin. 55(1): 10-30 (2005). Many types of cancer have been described in the medical literature. Examples include cancer of the blood, bone, lung (e.g., non-small-cell lung cancer and small-cell lung cancer), colon, breast, prostate, ovary, brain, and intestine. The incidence of cancer continues to climb as the general population ages and as new forms of cancer develop. A continuing need exists for effective therapies to treat subjects with cancer. [0004] Nucleoside analogs have been used clinically for the treatment of viral infections and certain cancers. Most nucleoside analogs are classified as anti-metabolites. After they enter the cell, nucleoside analogs are successively phosphorylated to nucleoside 5'-monophosphates, di-phosphates, and tri-phosphates. [0005] The nucleoside analogs 5-azacytidine (also known as 4-amino-l-P-D-ribofuranosyl-l,3,5-triazin-2(lH)-one; National Service Center designation NSC-102816; CAS Registry Number 320-67-2; azacitidine; Aza and ΑΖΑ; and currently marketed as VIDAZA®) and Τ-deoxy-5-azacytidine (also known as 5 -aza-2'-deoxycytidine, decitabine, 5- aza-CdR, Dac, and DAC, and currently marketed as DACOGEN®) are DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitors that have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Azacitidine and decitabine are cytidine analogs; a structural difference between these cytidine analogs and their related natural nucleosides is the presence of a nitrogen at position 5 of the cytosine ring in place of a carbon. Azacitidine may be defined as having a molecular formula of C8H12N4O5, a molecular weight of 244.21 grams per mole, and a structure as shown below. Decitabine may be defined as having a molecular formula of C8H12N4O4, a molecular weight of 228.21 grams per mole, and a structure as shown below. [0006] After its incorporation into replicating DNA, 5-azacytidine or 5-aza-2'deoxycytidine can form a covalent complex with DNA methyltransferases. DNA methyltransferases are responsible for c/e novo DNA methylation and for reproducing established methylation patterns in daughter DNA strands of replicating DNA. Inhibition of DNA methyltransferases can lead to DNA hypomethylation, thereby restoring normal functions to morphologically dysplastic, immature cells by re-expression of genes involved in normal cell cycle regulation, differentiation and death. The cytotoxic effects of cytidine analogs can cause the death of rapidly dividing cells that are no longer responsive to normal cell growth control mechanisms. 5-Azacytidine, unlike 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, also incorporates into RNA. The cytotoxic effects of azacitidine may result from multiple mechanisms, including inhibition of DNA, RNA and protein synthesis, incorporation into RNA and DNA, and activation of DNA damage pathways. [0007] 5-Azacytidine and 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine have been tested in clinical trials and showed significant activity, such as, for example, in the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), and non Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL). See, e.g., Aparicio et αℓ., Curr. Opin. Invest. Drugs 3(4): 627-33 (2002). 5-Azacytidine has undergone NCI-sponsored trials for the treatment of MDS and has been approved for treating all FAB subtypes of MDS. See, e.g., Komblith et al.,J. Clin. Oncol. 20(10): 2441-2452 (2002); Silverman et αℓ., J. Clin. Oncol. 20(10): 2429-2440 (2002). 5-Azacytidine may alter the natural course of MDS by diminishing the transformation to AML through its cytotoxic activity and its inhibition of DNA methyltransferase. In a Phase III study, 5-azacytidine administered subcutaneously significantly prolonged survival and time to AML transformation or death in subjects with higher-risk MDS. See, e.g., Ρ. Fenaux et αℓ., Lancet Oncol., 2009, 10(3):223-32; Silverman et αℓ., Blood 106(11): Abstract 2526 (2005). [0008] Other members of the class of cytidine analogs include, for example: 1-β-0-arabinofuranosylcytosine (Cytarabine or ara-C); pseudoisocytidine (psi ICR); 5-fluoro-2'deoxycytidine (FCdR); 2'-deoxy-2',2'-difluorocytidine (Gemcitabine); 5-aza-2'-deoxy-2',2'difluorocytidine; 5-aza-2'-deoxy-2’-fluorocytidine; l-P-D-ribofuranosyl-2( 1 /7)-pyrimidinonc (Zebularine); 2',3'-dideoxy-5-fluoro-3'-thiacytidine (Emtriva); 2'-cyclocytidine (Ancitabine); l-P-D-arabinofuranosyl-5-azacytosine (Fazarabine or ara-AC); 6-azacytidine (6-aza-CR); 5,6-dihydro-5-azacytidine (dH-aza-CR); N4-pentyloxycarbonyl-5’-deoxy-5-fluorocytidine (Capecitabine); N4-octadecyl-cytarabine; and elaidic acid cytarabine. [0009] 5-Azacytidine and certain other cytidine analogs are approved for subcutaneous (SC) or intravenous (IV) administration to treat certain proliferative disorders. Oral dosing of cytidine analogs would be more desirable and convenient for patients and doctors, e.g., by eliminating injection-site reactions that may occur with SC administration and/or by permitting improved patient compliance. However, oral delivery of cytidine analogs has proven difficult due to combinations of chemical instability, enzymatic instability, and/or poor permeability. For example, cytidine analogs have been considered acid labile and unstable in the acidic gastric environment. Previous attempts to develop oral dosage forms of cytidine analogs have required enteric coating of the drug core to protect the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) from what was understood and accepted to be therapeutically unacceptable hydrolysis in the stomach, such that the drug is preferably absorbed in specific regions of the lower gastrointestinal tract, such as the jejunum in the small intestine. See, e.g., Sands, et αℓ., U.S. Patent Publication No. 2004/0162263 (Αρρ. No. 10/698,983). In addition, a generally accepted belief in the art has been that water leads to detrimental hydrolytic degradation of cytidine analogs during formulation, subsequently affecting the stability of the API in the dosage form. As a result, coatings applied to the drug core for prospective oral delivery of cytidine analogs have previously been limited to organic solvent-based systems to minimize exposure of the API to water.

[0032] As used herein, and unless otherwise specified, the terms “treat,” “treating” and “treatment” refer to the eradication or amelioration of a disease or disorder, or of one or more symptoms associated with the disease or disorder. In certain embodiments, the terms refer to minimizing the spread or worsening of the disease or disorder resulting from the administration of one or more prophylactic or therapeutic agents to a subject with such a disease or disorder. In some embodiments, the terms refer to the administration of a compound or dosage form provided herein, with or without one or more additional active agent(s), after the onset of symptoms of the particular disease. [0033] As used herein, and unless otherwise specified, the terms “prevent,” “preventing” and “prevention” refer to the prevention of the onset, recurrence or spread of a disease or disorder, or of one or more symptoms thereof. In certain embodiments, the terms refer to the treatment with or administration of a compound or dosage form provided herein, with or without one or more other additional active agent(s), prior to the onset of symptoms, particularly to subjects at risk of disease or disorders provided herein. The terms encompass the inhibition or reduction of a symptom of the particular disease. Subjects with familial history of a disease are potential candidates for preventive regimens in certain embodiments. In addition, subjects who have a history of recurring symptoms are also potential candidates for prevention. In this regard, the term “prevention” may be interchangeably used with the term “prophylactic treatment.” [0034] As used herein, and unless otherwise specified, the terms “manage,” “managing” and “management” refer to preventing or slowing the progression, spread or worsening of a disease or disorder, or of one or more symptoms thereof. Often, the beneficial effects that a subject derives from a prophylactic and/or therapeutic agent do not result in a cure of the disease or disorder. In this regard, the term “managing” encompasses treating a subject who had suffered from the particular disease in an attempt to prevent or minimize the recurrence of the disease. [0035] As used herein, “amelioration” of the symptoms of a particular disorder by administration of a particular pharmaceutical composition refers to any lessening, whether permanent or temporary, lasting or transient, that can be attributed to or associated with administration of the composition. [0036] As used herein, and unless otherwise specified, the terms “therapeutically effective amount” and “effective amount” of a compound mean an amount sufficient to provide a therapeutic benefit in the treatment or management of a disease or disorder, or to delay or minimize one or more symptoms associated with the disease or disorder. A “therapeutically effective amount” and “effective amount” of a compound mean an amount of therapeutic agent, alone or in combination with one or more other agent(s), which provides a therapeutic benefit in the treatment or management of the disease or disorder. The terms “therapeutically effective amount” and “effective amount” can encompass an amount that improves overall therapy, reduces or avoids symptoms or causes of disease or disorder, or enhances the therapeutic efficacy of another therapeutic agent. [0037] As used herein, and unless otherwise specified, a “prophylactically effective amount” of a compound is an amount sufficient to prevent a disease or disorder, or prevent its recurrence. A prophylactically effective amount of a compound means an amount of therapeutic agent, alone or in combination with one or more other agent(s), which provides a prophylactic benefit in the prevention of the disease. The term “prophylactically effective amount” can encompass an amount that improves overall prophylaxis or enhances the prophylactic efficacy of another prophylactic agent. [0038] As used herein, and unless otherwise specified, the term “subject” is defined herein to include animals such as mammals, including, but not limited to, primates (e.g., humans), cows, sheep, goats, horses, dogs, cats, rabbits, rats, mice, and the like. In specific embodiments, the subject is a human. The terms “subject” and “patient” are used interchangeably herein in reference, for example, to a mammalian subject, such as a human. [0039] “Tumor,” as used herein, refers to all neoplastic cell growth and proliferation, whether malignant or benign, and all pre-cancerous and cancerous cells and tissues. “Neoplastic,” as used herein, refers to any form of dysregulated or unregulated cell growth, whether malignant or benign, resulting in abnormal tissue growth. Thus, “neoplastic cells” include malignant and benign cells having dysregulated or unregulated cell growth. [0040] As used herein, the terms “cancer” and “cancerous” refer to or describe the physiological condition in mammals that is typically characterized by unregulated cell growth. Examples of cancer include, but are not limited to blood-borne (e.g., lymphoma, leukemia) and solid tumors. [0041] As used herein, and unless otherwise specified, the term “proliferative” disorder or disease refers to unwanted cell proliferation of one or more subset of cells in a multicellular organism resulting in harm (ΐ.℮., discomfort or decreased life expectancy) to the multicellular organism. For example, as used herein, proliferative disorder or disease includes neoplastic disorders and other proliferative disorders.

[0044] As used herein, and unless otherwise specified, the term “drug resistance” refers to the condition when a disease does not respond to the treatment of a drug or drugs. Drug resistance can be either intrinsic, which means the disease has never been responsive to the drug or drugs, or it can be acquired, which means the disease ceases responding to a drug or drugs that the disease had previously responded to. In certain embodiments, drug resistance is intrinsic. In certain embodiments, the drug resistance is acquired. [0045] As used herein, and unless otherwise specified, the term “anti-cancer agent,” “anticancer agent” or “cancer therapeutic agent” is meant to include anti-proliferative agents and chemotherapeutic agents, including, but not limited to, antimetabolites (e.g., 5-fluoro uracil, methotrexate, azacitidine, decitabine, fludarabine, cytarabine (also known as cytosine arabinoside or Ara-C), and high dose cytarabine), antimicrotubule agents (e.g., vinca alkaloids, such as vincristine and vinblastine; and taxanes, such as paclitaxel and docetaxel), alkylating agents (e.g., mechlorethamine, chlorambucil, cyclophosphamide, melphalan, ifosfamide, carmustine, busulfan, cyclophosphamide, dacarbazine, ifosfamide, and nitrosoureas, such as carmustine, lomustine, bischloroethylnitrosurea, and hydroxyurea), platinum agents (e.g., cisplatin, carboplatin, oxaliplatin, satraplatin (JM-216), and CI-973), anthracyclines (e.g., doxorubicin and daunorubicin), antitumor antibiotics (e.g., mitomycin, bleomycin, idarubicin, adriamycin, daunomycin (also known as daunorubicin, rubidomycin, or cerubidine), and mitoxantrone), topoisomerase inhibitors (e.g., etoposide and camptothecins), purine antagonists or pyrimidine antagonists (e.g., 6-mercaptopurine, 5-fluorouracil, cytarabine, clofarabine, and gemcitabine), cell maturing agents (e.g., arsenic trioxide and tretinoin), DNA repair enzyme inhibitors (e.g., podophyllotoxines, etoposide, irinotecan, topotecan, and teniposide), enzymes that prevent cell survival (e.g., asparaginase and pegaspargase), histone deacetylase inhibitors (e.g., vorinostat), any other cytotoxic agents (e.g., estramustine phosphate, dexamethasone, prednimustine, and procarbazine), hormones (e.g., dexamethasone, prednisone, methylprednisolone, tamoxifen, leuprolide, flutamide, and megestrol), monoclonal antibodies (e.g., gemtuzumab ozogamicin, alemtuzumab, rituximab, and yttrium-90-ibritumomab tiuxetan), immuno-modulators (e.g., thalidomide and lenalidomide), Bcr-Abl kinase inhibitors (e.g., ΑΡ23464, AZD0530, CGP76030, PD 180970, SKI-606, imatinib, BMS354825 (dasatinib), ΑΜΝ107 (nilotinib), and VX-680), hormone agonists or antagonists, partial agonists or partial antagonists, kinase inhibitors, surgery, radiotherapy (e.g., gamma-radiation, neutron bean radiotherapy, electron beam radiotherapy, proton therapy, brachytherapy, and systemic radioactive isotopes), endocrine therapy, biological response modifiers (e.g., interferons, interleukins, and tumor necrosis factor), hyperthermia and cryotherapy, and agents to attenuate any adverse effects (e.g., antiemetics). [0046] As used herein, and unless otherwise specified, the terms “co-administration” and “in combination with” include the administration of two or more therapeutic agents simultaneously, concurrently, or sequentially within no specific time limits unless otherwise indicated. In one embodiment, the agents are present in the cell or in the subject’s body at the same time or exert their biological or therapeutic effect at the same time. In one embodiment, the therapeutic agents are in the same composition or unit dosage form. In other embodiments, the therapeutic agents are in separate compositions or unit dosage forms. In certain embodiments, a first agent can be administered prior to (e.g., 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 45 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours, 96 hours, 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 4 weeks, 5 weeks, 6 weeks, 8 weeks, or 12 weeks before), essentially concomitantly with, or subsequent to (e.g., 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 45 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours, 96 hours, 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 4 weeks, 5 weeks, 6 weeks, 8 weeks, or 12 weeks after) the administration of a second therapeutic agent. [0047] The terms “composition,” “formulation,” and “dosage form,” as used herein are intended to encompass compositions comprising the specified ingredient(s) (in the specified amounts, if indicated), as well as any product(s) which result, directly or indirectly, from combination of the specified ingredient(s) in the specified amount(s). By “pharmaceutical” or “pharmaceutically acceptable” it is meant that any diluent(s), excipient(s) or carrier(s) in the composition, formulation, or dosage form are compatible with the other ingredient(s) and not deleterious to the recipient thereof. Unless indicated otherwise, the terms “composition,” “formulation,” and “dosage form” are used herein interchangeably. [0048] The term “immediate release,” when used herein in reference to a composition, formulation, or dosage form provided herein, means that the composition, formulation, or dosage form does not comprise a component (e.g., a coating) that serves to delay the spatial and/or temporal release of some or all of the API from the composition, formulation, or dosage form following oral administration. In certain embodiments, an immediate release composition, formulation, or dosage form is one that releases the API substantially in the stomach following oral administration. In certain embodiments, an immediate release composition, formulation, or dosage form is one that releases the API substantially in the stomach or the upper intestine following oral administration. In specific embodiments, an immediate release composition, formulation, or dosage form is one that is not delayedrelease. In specific embodiments, an immediate release composition, formulation, or dosage form is one that does not comprise an enteric coating. [0049] The term “non-enteric-coated,” when used herein, refers to a pharmaceutical composition, formulation, or dosage form that does not comprise a coating intended to release the active ingredient(s) beyond the stomach (e.g., in the intestine). In certain embodiments, a non-enteric-coated composition, formulation, or dosage form is designed to release the active ingredient(s) substantially in the stomach. In certain embodiments, a non-enteric-coated composition, formulation, or dosage form is designed to release the active ingredient(s) substantially in the stomach and the upper intestine. [0050] The term “substantially in the stomach,” when used herein in reference to a composition, formulation, or dosage form provided herein, means that at least about 99%, at least about 95%, at least about 90%, at least about 85%, at least about 80%, at least about 75%, at least about 70%, at least about 65%, at least about 60%, at least about 55%, at least about 50%, at least about 45%, at least about 40%, at least about 35%, at least about 30%, at least about 25%, at least about 20%, at least about 15%, or at least about 10% of the cytidine analog is released in the stomach. The term “released in the stomach” and related terms as used herein refer to the process whereby the cytidine analog is made available for uptake by or transport across cells lining the stomach and then made available to the body. [0051] The term “isotopic composition” refers to the amount of each isotope present in a given atomic position, and “natural isotopic composition” refers to the naturally occurring isotopic composition or abundance for a given atomic position. Atomic positions containing their natural isotopic composition may also be referred to herein as “non-enriched.” Unless otherwise designated, the atomic positions of the compounds recited herein are meant to represent any stable isotope of that atom. For example, unless otherwise stated, when a position is designated specifically as “H” or “hydrogen,” the position is understood to have hydrogen at its natural isotopic composition. [0052] The term “isotopically enriched” refers to an atomic position having an isotopic composition other than the natural isotopic composition of that atom. “Isotopically enriched” may also refer to a compound containing at least one atomic position having an isotopic composition other than the natural isotopic composition of that atom. As used herein, an “isotopologue” is an isotopically enriched compound. [0053] The term “isotopic enrichment” refers to the percentage of incorporation of an amount of a specific isotope at a given atomic position in a molecule in the place of that atom’s natural isotopic composition. For example, deuterium enrichment of 1% at a given position means that 1% of the molecules in a given sample contain deuterium at the specified position. Because the naturally occurring distribution of deuterium is about 0.0156%, deuterium enrichment at any position in a compound synthesized using non-enriched starting materials is about 0.0156%. [0054] The term “isotopic enrichment factor” refers to the ratio between the isotopic composition and the natural isotopic composition of a specified isotope. [0055] With regard to the compounds provided herein, when a particular atomic position is designated as having deuterium or “D,” it is understood that the abundance of deuterium at that position is substantially greater than the natural abundance of deuterium, which is about 0.015%. A position designated as having deuterium typically has a minimum isotopic enrichment factor of, in particular embodiments, at least 1000 (15% deuterium incorporation), at least 2000 (30% deuterium incorporation), at least 3000 (45% deuterium incorporation), at least 3500 (52.5% deuterium incorporation), at least 4000 (60% deuterium incorporation), at least 4500 (67.5% deuterium incorporation), at least 5000 (75% deuterium incorporation), at least 5500 (82.5% deuterium incorporation), at least 6000 (90% deuterium incorporation), at least 6333.3 (95% deuterium incorporation), at least 6466.7 (97% deuterium incorporation), at least 6600 (99% deuterium incorporation), or at least 6633.3 (99.5% deuterium incorporation) at each designated deuterium position. [0056] The isotopic enrichment and isotopic enrichment factor of the compounds provided herein can be determined using conventional analytical methods known to one of ordinary skill in the art, including, e.g., mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and crystallography. [0057] As used herein, and unless otherwise specified, the term “pharmaceutically acceptable carrier,” “pharmaceutically acceptable excipient,” “physiologically acceptable carrier,” or “physiologically acceptable excipient” refers to a pharmaceutically-acceptable material, composition, or vehicle, such as, e.g., a liquid or solid filler, diluent, excipient, solvent, or encapsulating material. In one embodiment, each component is “pharmaceutically acceptable” in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of a pharmaceutical formulation, and suitable for use in contact with the tissue or organ of humans and animals without excessive toxicity, irritation, allergic response, immunogenicity, or other problems or complications, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio. In one embodiment, by “pharmaceutical” or “pharmaceutically acceptable” it is meant that any diluent(s), excipient(s) or carrier(s) in the composition, formulation, or dosage form are compatible with the other ingredient(s) and not deleterious to the recipient thereof. See, e.g., Remington, The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 21st Edition; Lippincott Williams & Wilkins: Philadelphia, PA, 2005; Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients, 5th Edition; Rowe et αℓ., ed., The Pharmaceutical Press and the American Pharmaceutical Association: 2005; and Handbook of Pharmaceutical Additives, 3rd Edition; Ash and Ash ed., Gower Publishing Company: 2007; Pharmaceutical Preformulation and Formulation, Gibson ed., CRC Press LLC: Boca Raton, FL, 2004. [0058] As used herein, and unless otherwise specified, the term “hydrate” means a compound provided herein or a salt thereof, which further includes a stoichiometric or ηοηstoichiometric amount of water bound by non-covalent intermolecular forces. [0059] As used herein, and unless otherwise specified, the term “solvate” means a solvate formed from the association of one or more solvent molecules to a compound provided herein. The term “solvate” includes hydrates (e.g., mono-hydrate, dihydrate, trihydrate, tetrahydrate and the like). [0060] As used herein, and unless otherwise specified, a compound described herein is intended to encompass all possible stereoisomers, unless a particular stereochemistry is specified. Where structural isomers of a compound are interconvertible via a low energy barrier, the compound may exist as a single tautomer or a mixture of tautomers. This can take the form of proton tautomerism; or so-called valence tautomerism in the compound, e.g., that contain an aromatic moiety. Β. Cytidine Analogs 1. Overview [0061] Provided herein are dosage forms, pharmaceutical formulations, and compositions comprising cytidine analogs that release the API substantially in the stomach upon oral administration. In certain embodiments, the cytidine analog is 5-azacytidine. In certain embodiments, the cytidine analog is 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (decitabine or 5-aza-CdR). In certain embodiments, the cytidine analog is, for example: l-P-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine (Cytarabine or ara-C); pseudoiso-cytidine (psi ICR); 5-fluoro-2'-deoxycytidine (FCdR); 2'deoxy-2',2'-difluorocytidine (Gemcitabine); 5-aza-2'-deoxy-2',2'-difluorocytidine; 5-aza-2'deoxy-2'-fluorocytidine; l-P-D-ribofuranosyl-2( 1 /7)-pyrimidinonc (Zebularine); 2',3'-dideoxy-5-fluoro-3’-thiacytidine (Emtriva); 2’-cyclocytidine (Ancitabine); l-P-D-arabinofuranosyl-5-azacytosine (Fazarabine or ara-AC); 6-azacytidine (6-aza-CR); 5,6-dihydro-5-azacytidine (dH-aza-CR); N4-pentyloxy-carbonyl-5'-deoxy-5-fluorocytidine (Capecitabine); N4-octadecyl-cytarabine; elaidic acid cytarabine; or a conjugated compound comprising a cytidine analog and a fatty acid (e.g., an azacitidine-fatty acid conjugate, including, but not limited to, CP-4200 (Clavis Pharma ASA) or a compound disclosed in WO 2009/042767, such as aza-C-5'-pctrosclinic acid ester or aza-C-5'-pctrosclaidic acid ester). [0062] In certain embodiments, cytidine analogs provided herein include esterified derivatives of cytidine analogs, such as, e.g., esterified derivatives of 5-azacytidine. In particular embodiments, esterified derivatives are cytidine analogs that contain an ester moiety (e.g., an acetyl group) at one or more positions on the cytidine analog molecule. Esterified derivatives may be prepared by any method known in the art. In certain embodiments, esterified derivatives of a cytidine analog serve as prodrugs of the cytidine analog, such that, e.g., following administration of an esterified derivative, the derivative is deacetylated in vivo to yield the cytidine analog. A particular embodiment herein provides 2',3',5'-triacetyl-5-azacytidine (TAC), which possesses favorable physical-chemical and therapeutic properties. See, e.g., International Publication No. WO 2008/092127 (International Application No. PCT/US2008/052124); Ziemba, A.J., et αℓ., “Development of Oral Demethylating Agents for the Treatment of Myelodysplastic Syndrome” (Abstract No. 3369), In: Proceedings of the 100th Annual Meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research, 2009 Apr. 18-22; Denver, Co. Philadelphia (PA): AACR; 2009 (both of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entireties). [0063] In certain embodiments, the cytidine analogs provided herein include any compound which is structurally related to cytidine or deoxycytidine and functionally mimics and/or antagonizes the action of cytidine or deoxycytidine. Certain embodiments herein provide salts, cocrystals, solvates (e.g., hydrates), complexes, prodrugs, precursors, metabolites, and/or other derivatives of the cytidine analogs provided herein. For example, particular embodiments provide salts, cocrystals, solvates (e.g., hydrates), complexes, precursors, metabolites, and/or other derivatives of 5-azacytidine. Certain embodiments provide cytidine analogs that are not salts, cocrystals, solvates (e.g., hydrates), or complexes of the cytidine analogs provided herein. For example, particular embodiments provide 5-azacytidine in a non-ionized, non-solvated (e.g., anhydrous), non-complexed form. Certain embodiments herein provide mixtures of two or more cytidine analogs provided herein. [0064] Cytidine analogs provided herein may be prepared using synthetic methods and procedures referenced herein or otherwise available in the literature. For example, particular methods for synthesizing 5-azacytidine are taught in, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 7,038,038 and references discussed therein, each of which is incorporated herein by reference. 5-Azacytidine is also available from Celgene Corporation, Warren, NJ. Other cytidine analogs provided herein may be prepared using previously disclosed synthetic procedures available to a person of ordinary skill in the art. [0065] It should be noted that if there is a discrepancy between a depicted structure and a chemical name given that structure, the depicted structure is to be accorded more weight. In addition, if the stereochemistry of a structure or a portion of a structure is not indicated with, for example, bold or dashed lines, the structure or portion of the structure is to be interpreted as encompassing all stereoisomers. Where the compound provided herein contains an alkenyl or alkenylene group, the compound may exist as one geometric (ΐ.℮., cisltrans or Ε/Ζ) isomer or a mixture of geometric (ΐ.℮., cisltrans or Ε/Ζ) isomers. Unless otherwise specified, a compound provided herein is intended to encompass all geometric isomers. [0066] Where structural isomers are inter-convertible, the compound may exist as a single tautomer or a mixture of tautomers. This can take the form of proton tautomerism in the compound that contains, for example, an imino, keto, or oxime group; or so-called valence tautomerism in the compound that contain, for example, an aromatic moiety. It follows that a single compound may exhibit more than one type of isomerism. It will be understood that unless otherwise specified, a compound provided herein is intended to encompass all possible tautomers. Similarly, unless otherwise specified, a compound provided herein is intended to encompass all possible stereoisomers. [0067] The compounds provided herein may be enantiomerically pure, such as a single enantiomer or a single diastereomer, or be stereoisomeric mixtures, such as a mixture of enantiomers, e.g., a racemic mixture of two enantiomers; or a mixture of two or more diastereomers. Conventional techniques for the preparation/isolation of individual enantiomers include synthesis from a suitable optically pure precursor, asymmetric synthesis from achiral starting materials, or resolution of an enantiomeric mixture, for example, by chiral chromatography, recrystallization, resolution, diastereomeric salt formation, or derivatization into diastereomeric adducts followed by separation. In some instances, for compounds that undergo epimerization in vivo, one of skill in the art will recognize that administration of a compound in its (R) form is equivalent to administration of the compound in its (S) form, and vice versa. [0068] When the compound provided herein contains an acidic or basic moiety, it may also be provided as a pharmaceutically acceptable salt (See, Berge et αℓ., J. Pharm. Sci. 1977, 66, 1-19; and “Handbook of Pharmaceutical Salts, Properties, and Use,” Stahl and Wermuth, Ed.; Wiley-VCH and VHCA, Zurich, 2002). [0069] Suitable acids for use in the preparation of pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, but are not limited to, acetic acid, 2,2-dichloroacetic acid, acylated amino acids, adipic acid, alginic acid, ascorbic acid, L-aspartic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, benzoic acid, 4-acetamidobenzoic acid, boric acid, (+)-camphoric acid, camphorsulfonic acid, (+)-(16)camphor- 10-sulfonic acid, capric acid, caproic acid, caprylic acid, cinnamic acid, citric acid, cyclamic acid, cyclohexanesulfamic acid, dodecylsulfuric acid, ethane-1,2-disulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, 2-hydroxy-ethanesulfonic acid, formic acid, fumaric acid, galactaric acid, gentisic acid, glucoheptonic acid, D-gluconic acid, D-glucuronic acid, L-glutamic acid, a-oxoglutaric acid, glycolic acid, hippuric acid, hydrobromic acid, hydrochloric acid, hydroiodic acid, (+)-L-lactic acid, (±)-DL-lactic acid, lactobionic acid, lauric acid, maleic acid, (-)-L-malic acid, malonic acid, (±)-DL-mandelic acid, methanesulfonic acid, naphthalene-2-sulfonic acid, naphthalene-1,5-disulfonic acid, l-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid, nicotinic acid, nitric acid, oleic acid, orotic acid, oxalic acid, palmitic acid, pamoic acid, perchloric acid, phosphoric acid, L-pyroglutamic acid, saccharic acid, salicylic acid, 4-aminosalicylic acid, sebacic acid, stearic acid, succinic acid, sulfuric acid, tannic acid, (+)-L-tartaric acid, thiocyanic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, undecylenic acid, and valeric acid. [0070] Suitable bases for use in the preparation of pharmaceutically acceptable salts, including, but not limited to, inorganic bases, such as magnesium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, zinc hydroxide, or sodium hydroxide; and organic bases, such as primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary, aliphatic and aromatic amines, including L-arginine, benethamine, benzathine, choline, deanol, diethanolamine, diethylamine, dimethylamine, dipropylamine, diisopropylamine, 2-(diethylamino)-ethanol, ethanolamine, ethylamine, ethylenediamine, isopropylamine, /V-mcthyl-glucaminc, hydrabamine, 1Ηimidazole, L-lysine, morpholine, 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-morpholine, methylamine, piperidine, piperazine, propylamine, pyrrolidine, l-(2-hydroxyethyl)-pyrrolidine, pyridine, quinuclidine, quinoline, isoquinoline, secondary amines, triethanolamine, trimethylamine, triethylamine, N-methyl-D-glucamine, 2-amino-2-(hydroxymethyl)-1,3-propanediol, and tromethamine. [0071] The compound provided herein may also be provided as a prodrug, which is a functional derivative of a compound provided herein, and is readily convertible into the parent compound in vivo. Prodrugs are often useful because, in some situations, they may be easier to administer than the parent compound. They may, for instance, be bioavailable by oral administration whereas the parent compound is not. The prodrug may also have enhanced solubility in pharmaceutical compositions over the parent compound. A prodrug may be converted into the parent drug by various mechanisms, including enzymatic processes and metabolic hydrolysis.

Isotopically Enriched Cytidine Analogs [0073] Particular embodiments herein provide isotopically enriched cytidine analogs, prodrugs thereof, synthetic intermediates thereof, and metabolites thereof. For example, specific embodiments herein provide isotopically enriched 5-azacytidine. [0074] Isotopic enrichment (e.g., deuteration) of pharmaceuticals to improve pharmacokinetics (“PK”), pharmacodynamics (“PD”), and toxicity profiles, has been demonstrated previously with some classes of drugs. See, e.g., Lijinsky ℮(. αℓ., Food Cosmet. Toxicol., 20: 393 (1982); Lijinsky et. αℓ., J. Nat. Cancer Inst., 69: 1127 (1982); Mangold et. αℓ., Mutation Res. 308: 33 (1994); Gordon et. αℓ., Drug Metab. Dispos., 15: 589 (1987); Ζ℮11ο et. αℓ., Metabolism, 43: 487 (1994); Gately et. αℓ., J. Nucl. Med., 27: 388 (1986); Wade, D., Chem. Biol. Interact. 117: 191 (1999). [0075] Without being limited by any particular theory, isotopic enrichment of a drug can be used, for example, to: (1) reduce or eliminate unwanted metabolites; (2) increase the half-life of the parent drug; (3) decrease the number of doses needed to achieve a desired effect; (4) decrease the amount of a dose necessary to achieve a desired effect; (5) increase the formation of active metabolites, if any are formed; and/or (6) decrease the production of deleterious metabolites in specific tissues and/or create a more effective drug and/or a safer drug for combination therapy, whether the combination therapy is intentional or not. [0076] Replacement of an atom for one of its isotopes may often result in a change in the reaction rate of a chemical reaction. This phenomenon is known as the Kinetic Isotope Effect (“KIE”). For example, if a C-H bond is broken during a rate-determining step in a chemical reaction (i.e. the step with the highest transition state energy), substitution of a deuterium for that hydrogen will cause a decrease in the reaction rate and the process will slow down. This phenomenon is known as the Deuterium Kinetic Isotope Effect (“DKIE”). See, e.g., Foster et αℓ., Adv. Drug Res., vol. 14, ρρ. 1-36 (1985); Kushner et αℓ., Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol., vol. 77, ρρ. 79-88 (1999). [0077] Certain embodiments herein provide deuterium enriched 5-azacytidine analogs, wherein one or more hydrogen(s) in the 5-azacytidine molecule is/are isotopically enriched with deuterium. In certain embodiments, provided herein are compounds of formula (I): wherein one or more Υ atom(s) (i.e., Υ,Υ,Υ,Υ,Υ,Υ, and Υ ) is/are hydrogen(s) isotopically enriched with deuterium, and any remaining Υ atom(s) is/are non-enriched hydrogen atom(s). In particular embodiments, one, two, three, four, five, six, or seven of the indicated Υ atom(s) is/are isotopically enriched with deuterium, and any remaining Υ atom(s) is/are non-enriched hydrogen(s).

In certain embodiments, a formulation provided herein comprising a cytidine analog provided herein is a controlled release tablet or capsule, which comprises a therapeutically effective amount of the cytidine analog, a drug release controlling component that controls the release of the cytidine analog substantially in the stomach upon oral administration, and optionally, one or more excipients. [00115] Particular embodiments provide a drug release controlling component that is a polymer matrix, which swells upon exposure to gastric fluid to effect the gastric retention of the formulation and the sustained release of the cytidine analog from the polymer matrix substantially in the stomach. In certain embodiments, such formulations may be prepared by incorporating the cytidine analog into a suitable polymeric matrix during formulation. Examples of such formulations are known in the art. See, e.g., Shell et αℓ., U.S. Patent Publication No. 2002/0051820 (Application No. 09/990,061); Shell et αℓ., U.S. Patent Publication No. 2003/0039688 (Application No. 10/045,823); Gusler et αℓ., U.S. Patent Publication No. 2003/0104053 (Application No. 10/029,134), each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. [00116] In certain embodiments, the drug release controlling component may comprise a shell surrounding the drug-containing core, wherein the shell releases the cytidine analog from the core by, e.g., permitting diffusion of the cytidine analog from the core and promoting gastric retention of the formulation by swelling upon exposure to gastric fluids to a size that is retained in the stomach. In certain embodiments, such formulations may be prepared by first compressing a mixture of the cytidine analog and one or more excipients to form a drug core, and compressing another powdered mixture over the drug core to form the shell, or enclosing the drug core with a capsule shell made of suitable materials. Examples of such formulations are known in the art. See, e.g., Berner et αℓ., U.S. Patent Publication No. 2003/0104062 Application No. 10/213,823), incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. [00117] Certain embodiments herein provide oral dosage forms comprising a cytidine analog, wherein the dosage form contains pores in the conventional enteric coating. In particular embodiments, the oral dosage form of the cytidine analog is a tablet that contains a permeable or partly permeable (e.g., “leaky”) enteric coating with pores. In particular embodiments, the permeable or partly permeable enteric-coated tablet controls the release of the cytidine analog from the tablet primarily to the upper gastrointestinal tract, e.g., the stomach. In particular embodiments, the permeable or partly permeable enteric-coated tablet comprises 5-azacytidine. In particular embodiments, the remainder of the cytidine analog is subsequently released beyond the stomach (e.g., in the intestine). [00118] In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutical formulation provided herein is a compressed tablet comprising a cytidine analog. In addition to the cytidine analog, the tablet optionally comprises one or more excipients, including (a) diluents or fillers, which may add necessary bulk to a formulation to prepare tablets of the desired size; (b) binders or adhesives, which may promote adhesion of the particles of the formulation, enabling a granulation to be prepared and maintaining the integrity of the final tablet; (c) disintegrants or disintegrating agents, which, after administration, may promote breakup of the tablets to smaller particles for improved drug availability; (d) anti-adherents, glidants, lubricants or lubricating agents, which may enhance flow of the tableting material into the tablet dies, minimize wear of the punches and dies, prevent the sticking of fill material to the punches and dies, and produce tablets having a sheen; and (℮) miscellaneous adjuncts such as colorants and flavorants. After compression, tablets provided herein may be coated with various materials as described herein. [00119] In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutical formulation provided herein is a multiple compressed tablet of a cytidine analog. Multiple compressed tablets are prepared by subjecting the fill material to more than a single compression. The result may be a multiplelayered tablet or a tablet-within-a-tablet, the inner tablet being the core comprising a cytidine analog and optionally one or more excipients, and the outer portion being the shell, wherein the shell comprises one or more excipients, and may or may not contain the cytidine analog. Layered tablets may be prepared by the initial compaction of a portion of fill material in a die followed by additional fill material and compression to form two- or three-layered tablets, depending upon the number of separate fills. Each layer may contain a different therapeutic agent, separate from one another for reasons of chemical or physical incompatibility, or the same therapeutic agent for staged drug release, or simply for the unique appearance of the multiple-layered tablet. Each portion of fill may be colored differently to prepare a distinctive looking tablet. In the preparation of tablets having a compressed tablet as the inner core, special machines may be used to place the preformed tablet precisely within the die for the subsequent compression of surrounding fill material. [00120] In certain embodiments, the compressed tablet of a cytidine analog may be coated with a colored or an uncolored sugar layer. The coating may be water-soluble and quickly dissolved after oral ingestion. The sugar coating may serve the purpose of protecting the enclosed drug from the environment and providing a barrier to an objectionable taste or smell. The sugar coating may also enhance the appearance of the compressed tablet and permit the imprinting of identifying manufacturer’s information. In certain embodiments, sugar-coated tablets may be 50% larger and heavier than the original uncoated tablets. The sugar-coating of tablets may be divided into the following optional steps: (1) waterproofing and sealing (if needed); (2) sub-coating; (3) smoothing and final rounding; (4) finishing and coloring (if desired); (5) imprinting (if needed); and (6) polishing. [00121] In certain embodiments, the compressed tablet of a cytidine analog may be film-coated. Film-coated tablets may be compressed tablets coated with a thin layer of a polymer capable of forming a skin-like film over the tablet. The film is usually colored and has the advantage to be more durable, less bulky, and less time-consuming to apply. By its composition, the coating may be designed to rupture and expose the core tablet at the desired location within the gastrointestinal tract. The film-coating process, which places a thin skintight coating of a plastic-like material over the compressed tablet, may produce coated tablets having essentially the same weight, shape, and size as the originally compressed tablet. The film-coating may be colored to make the tablets attractive and distinctive. Film-coating solutions may be non-aqueous or aqueous. In particular embodiments, the non-aqueous solutions may optionally contain one or more of the following types of materials to provide the desired coating to the tablets: (1) a film former capable of producing smooth, thin films reproducible under conventional coating conditions and applicable to a variety of tablet shapes, such as, for example, cellulose acetate phthalate; (2) an alloying substance providing water solubility or permeability to the film to ensure penetration by body fluids and therapeutic availability of the drug, such as, for example, polyethylene glycol; (3) a plasticizer to produce flexibility and elasticity of the coating and thus provide durability, such as, for example, castor oil; (4) a surfactant to enhance spreadability of the film during application, such as, for example, polyoxyethylene sorbitan derivatives; (5) opaquants and colorants to make the appearance of the coated tablets attractive and distinctive, such as, for example, titanium dioxide as an opaquant, and FD&C or D&C dyes as a colorant; (6) sweeteners, flavors, or aromas to enhance the acceptability of the tablet to the subject, such as, for example, saccharin as sweeteners, and vanillin as flavors and aromas; (7) a glossant to provide a luster to the tablets without a separate polishing operation, such as, for example, beeswax; and (8) a volatile solvent to allow the spread of the other components over the tablets while allowing rapid evaporation to permit an effective yet speedy operation, such as, for example, alcohol-acetone mixture. In certain embodiments, an aqueous film-coating formulation may contain one or more of the following: (1) film-forming polymer, such as, for example, cellulose ether polymers as hydroxypropyl methyl-cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, and methyl-cellulose; (2) plasticizer, such as, for example, glycerin, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, diethyl phthalate, and dibutyl subacetate; (3) colorant and opacifier, such as, for example, FD&C or D&C lakes and iron oxide pigments; or (4) vehicle, such as, for example, water. [00122] In certain embodiments, the compressed tablet of a cytidine analog may be compression-coated. The coating material, in the form of a granulation or powder, may be compressed onto a tablet core of drug with a special tablet press. [00123] In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutical formulation is a gelatin-coated tablet comprising a cytidine analog. A gelatin-coated tablet is a capsule-shaped compressed tablet that allows the coated product to be smaller than a capsule filled with an equivalent amount of powder. The gelatin coating facilitates swallowing and compared to unsealed capsules, gelatin-coated tablets may be more tamper-evident. [00124] In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutical formulation may be a sublingual tablet of a cytidine analog. The sublingual tablet is intended to be dissolved beneath the tongue for absorption through the oral mucosa. The sublingual tablet may dissolve promptly and provide rapid release of the drug. [00125] In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutical formulation is an immediate release tablet of a cytidine analog. In certain embodiments, the immediate release tablet is designed, e.g., to disintegrate and release the API absent of any special rate-controlling features, such as special coatings and other techniques. In certain embodiments, the formulation is a rapidly disintegrating tablet that, e.g., dissolves substantially in the mouth following administration. In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutical formulation is an extended release tablet of a cytidine analog. In certain embodiments, the extended release tablet is designed, e.g., to release the API over an extended period of time and substantially in the stomach. [00126] In certain embodiments, compressed tablets may be prepared by wet granulation. Wet granulation is a widely employed method for the production of compressed tablets, and, in particular embodiments, requires one or more the following steps: (1) weighing and blending the ingredients; (2) preparing a damp mass; (3) screening the damp mass into pellets or granules; (4) drying the granulation; (5) sizing the granulation by dry screening; (6) adding lubricant and blending; and (7) tableting by compression. [00127] In certain embodiments, compressed tablets may be prepared by dry granulation. By the dry granulation method, the powder mixture is compacted in large pieces and subsequently broken down or sized into granules. But this method, either the active ingredient or the diluent has cohesive property. After weighing and mixing the ingredients, the powder mixture may be slugged or compressed into large flat tablets or pellets. The slugs then are broken up by hand or by a mill and passed through a screen of desired mesh for sizing. Lubricant is added in the usual manner, and tablets are prepared by compression. Alternatively, instead of slugging, powder compactors may be used to increase the density of a powder by pressing it between high-pressure rollers. The compressed material then is broken up, sized, and lubricated, and tablets are prepared by compression in the usual manner. The roller compaction method is often preferred over slugging. Binding agents used in roller compaction formulations include methylcellulose or hydroxyl-methylcellulose and can produce good tablet hardness and friability. [00128] In certain embodiments, compressed tablets may be prepared by direct compression. Some granular chemicals possess free flowing and cohesive properties that enable them to be compressed directly in a tablet machine without the need of wet or dry granulation. For chemicals that do not possess this quality, special pharmaceutical excipients may be used which impart the necessary qualities for the production of tablets by direct compression. Particular tableting excipients include, e.g.: fillers, such as spray-dried lactose, micro-crystals of alpha-monohydrate lactose, sucrose-invert sugar-corn starch mixtures, micro-crystalline cellulose, crystalline maltose, and di-calcium phosphate; disintegrating agents, such as direct-compression starch, sodium carboxymethyl starch, cross-linked carboxymethylcellulose fibers, and cross-linked polyvinylpyrrolidone; lubricants, such as magnesium searate and talc; and glidants, such as fumed silicon dioxide. [00129] In certain embodiments, tablets provided herein may be prepared by molding. The base for molded tablets is generally a mixture of finely powdered lactose with or without a portion of powdered sucrose. In preparing the fill, the drug is mixed uniformly with the base by geometric dilution. The powder mixture may be wetted with a mixture of water and alcohol sufficient only to dampen the powder so that it may be compacted. The solvent action of the water on a portion of the lactose/sucrose base effects the biding of the powder mixture upon drying. The alcohol portion hastens the drying process. [00130] In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutical formulations provided herein contain a cytidine analog and, optionally, one or more excipients to form a “drug core.” Optional excipients include, e.g., diluents (bulking agents), lubricants, disintegrants, fillers, stabilizers, surfactants, preservatives, coloring agents, flavoring agents, binding agents, excipient supports, glidants, permeation enhancement excipients, plasticizers and the like, e.g., as known in the art. It will be understood by those in the art that some substances serve more than one purpose in a pharmaceutical composition. For instance, some substances are binders that help hold a tablet together after compression, yet are also disintegrants that help break the tablet apart once it reaches the target delivery site. Selection of excipients and amounts to use may be readily determined by the formulation scientist based upon experience and consideration of standard procedures and reference works available in the art. [00131] In certain embodiments, formulations provided herein comprise one or more binders. Binders may be used, e.g., to impart cohesive qualities to a tablet, and thus ensure that the tablet remains intact after compression. Suitable binders include, but are not limited to, starch (including com starch and pregelatinized starch), gelatin, sugars (including sucrose, glucose, dextrose and lactose), polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol, waxes, and natural and synthetic gums, e.g., acacia sodium alginate, polyvinylpyrrolidone, cellulosic polymers (including hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, methyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose and the like), veegum, carbomer (e.g., carbopol), sodium, dextrin, guar gum, hydrogenated vegetable oil, magnesium aluminum silicate, maltodextrin, polymethacrylates, povidone (e.g., KOLLIDON, PLASDONE), microcrystalline cellulose, among others.

In certain embodiments, a suitable amount of a particular diluent is determined by one of ordinary skill in the art. [00133] In certain embodiments, formulations provided herein comprise one or more lubricants. Lubricants may be used, e.g., to facilitate tablet manufacture; examples of suitable lubricants include, for example, vegetable oils such as peanut oil, cottonseed oil, sesame oil, olive oil, com oil, and oil of theobroma, glycerin, magnesium stearate, calcium stearate, and stearic acid.

In certain embodiments, the appropriate amount of a suitable permeation enhancer provided herein is determined by one of skill in the art. [00141] Without intending to be limited to any particular theory, the permeation enhancers provided herein may function by, inter alia, facilitating (e.g., increasing the rate or extent of) the transport of a cytidine analog through the gastrointestinal wall. In general, movement through the gastrointestinal wall may occur by, e.g.: passive diffusion, such as the movement of drug across a membrane in a manner driven solely by the concentration gradient; carriermediated diffusion, such as the movement of drug across a cell membrane via a specialized transport system embedded in the cell membrane; paracellular diffusion, such as the movement of a drug across a membrane by going between, rather than through, two cells; and transcellular diffusion, such as the movement of a drug across the cell. Additionally, there are numerous cellular proteins capable of preventing intracellular accumulation of drugs by pumping out drug that enters the cell. These are sometimes called efflux pumps. One such efflux pump is that involving p-glycoprotein, which is present in many different tissues in the body (e.g., intestine, placental membrane, blood-brain barrier). Permeation enhancers can function by, inter alia, facilitating any of the processes mentioned above (such as by increasing fluidity of membranes, opening tight junctions between cells, and/or inhibiting efflux, among others). [00142] In certain embodiments, the compositions provided herein comprising a cytidine analog, e.g., 5-azacytidine or another cytidine analog provided herein, are essentially free of a cytidine deaminase inhibitor (e.g., do not comprise a cytidine deaminase inhibitor). In certain embodiments, the compositions provided herein are essentially free of (e.g., do not comprise) the cytidine deaminase inhibitor tetrahydrouridine (THU). Certain embodiments herein provide pharmaceutical compositions comprising a therapeutically effective amount of a cytidine analog (e.g., 5-azacytidine or another cytidine analog provided herein), wherein the compositions release the cytidine analog substantially in the stomach following oral administration to a subject, and wherein the compositions are essentially free of (e.g., do not comprise) a cytidine deaminase inhibitor (e.g., THU). Certain embodiments herein provide pharmaceutical compositions comprising a therapeutically effective amount of a cytidine analog (e.g., 5-azacytidine or another cytidine analog provided herein), wherein the compositions release the cytidine analog substantially in the stomach following oral administration to a subject, wherein the compositions are essentially free of (e.g., do not comprise) a cytidine deaminase inhibitor (e.g., THU), and wherein the compositions achieve a particular biological parameter provided herein (e.g., a particular Cmax value, Tmax value, and/or AUC value provided herein). In particular embodiments, a composition provided herein that is essentially free of a cytidine deaminase inhibitor (e.g., THU) comprises, e.g., less than 200 mg, less than 150 mg, less than 100 mg, less than 50 mg, less than 25 mg, less than 10 mg, less than 5 mg, less than 1 mg, or less than 0.1 mg of the cytidine deaminase inhibitor. 4. Other Embodiments of Oral Dosage Forms [00143] In other embodiments, the pharmaceutical compositions provided herein may be provided as compressed tablets, tablet triturates, chewable lozenges, rapidly dissolving tablets, multiple compressed tablets, or enteric-coating tablets, sugar-coated, or film-coated tablets. In one embodiment, enteric-coated tablets are compressed tablets coated with substances that resist the action of stomach acid but dissolve or disintegrate in the intestine, thus protecting the active ingredients from the acidic environment of the stomach. Entericcoatings include, but are not limited to, fatty acids, fats, phenyl salicylate, waxes, shellac, ammoniated shellac, and cellulose acetate phthalates. Sugar-coated tablets are compressed tablets surrounded by a sugar coating, which may be beneficial in covering up objectionable tastes or odors and in protecting the tablets from oxidation. Film-coated tablets are compressed tablets that are covered with a thin layer or film of a water-soluble material. Film coatings include, but are not limited to, hydroxyethylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, polyethylene glycol 4000, and cellulose acetate phthalate. In one embodiment, film coating imparts the same general characteristics as sugar coating.

[00146] In one embodiment, the pharmaceutical compositions provided herein may be provided in liquid and semisolid dosage forms, including emulsions, solutions, suspensions, elixirs, and syrups. An emulsion is a two-phase system, in which one liquid is dispersed in the form of small globules throughout another liquid, which can be oil-in-water or water-inoil. Emulsions may include a pharmaceutically acceptable non-aqueous liquid or solvent, emulsifying agent, and preservative. Suspensions may include a pharmaceutically acceptable suspending agent and preservative. Aqueous alcoholic solutions may include a pharmaceutically acceptable acetal, such as a di(lower alkyl) acetal of a lower alkyl aldehyde, e.g., acetaldehyde diethyl acetal; and a water-miscible solvent having one or more hydroxyl groups, such as propylene glycol and ethanol. Elixirs are clear, sweetened, and hydroalcoholic solutions. Syrups are concentrated aqueous solutions of a sugar, for example, sucrose, and may also contain a preservative. For a liquid dosage form, for example, a solution in a polyethylene glycol may be diluted with a sufficient quantity of a pharmaceutically acceptable liquid carrier, e.g., water, to be measured conveniently for administration. [00147] In one embodiment, other useful liquid and semisolid dosage forms include, but are not limited to, those containing the active ingredient(s) provided herein, and a dialkylated mono- or poly-alkylene glycol, including, 1,2-dimethoxymethane, diglyme, triglyme, tetraglyme, polyethylene glycol-350-dimethyl ether, polyethylene glycol-550-dimethyl ether, polyethylene glycol-750-dimethyl ether, wherein 350, 550, and 750 refer to the approximate average molecular weight of the polyethylene glycol.

[00149] Coloring and flavoring agents can be used in the dosage forms provided herein. [00150] In one embodiment, the pharmaceutical compositions provided herein may be formulated as immediate or modified release dosage forms, including delayed-, sustained-, pulsed-, controlled-, targeted-, and programmed-release forms. [00151] In one embodiment, the pharmaceutical compositions provided herein may be co-formulated with other active ingredients which do not impair the desired therapeutic action, or with substances that supplement the desired action. [00152] In one embodiment, active ingredients provided herein can be administered by controlled release means or by delivery devices that are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Examples include, but are not limited to, those described in U.S. Patent Nos.: 3,845,770; 3,916,899; 3,536,809; 3,598,123; and 4,008,719, 5,674,533, 5,059,595, 5,591,767, 5,120,548, 5,073,543, 5,639,476, 5,354,556, and 5,733,566, each of which is incorporated herein by reference. Such dosage forms can be used to provide slow or controlled-release of one or more active ingredients using, for example, hydropropylmethyl cellulose, other polymer matrices, gels, permeable membranes, osmotic systems, multilayer coatings, microparticles, liposomes, microspheres, or a combination thereof to provide the desired release profile in varying proportions. Suitable controlled-release formulations known to those of ordinary skill in the art, including those described herein, can be readily selected for use with the active agents provided herein. In one embodiment, provided are single unit dosage forms suitable for oral administration such as, but not limited to, tablets, capsules, gelcaps, and caplets that are adapted for controlled-release. [00153] In one embodiment, controlled-release pharmaceutical products improve drug therapy over that achieved by their non-controlled counterparts. In another embodiment, the use of a controlled-release preparation in medical treatment is characterized by a minimum of drug substance being employed to cure or control the condition in a minimum amount of time. Advantages of controlled-release formulations include extended activity of the drug, reduced dosage frequency, and increased patient compliance. In addition, controlled-release formulations can be used to affect the time of onset of action or other characteristics, such as blood levels of the drug, and can thus affect the occurrence of side (e.g., adverse) effects. [00154] In another embodiment, the controlled-release formulations are designed to initially release an amount of drug (active ingredient) that promptly produces the desired therapeutic or prophylactic effect, and gradually and continually release of other amounts of drug to maintain this level of therapeutic or prophylactic effect over an extended period of time. In one embodiment, in order to maintain a constant level of drug in the body, the drug can be released from the dosage form at a rate that will replace the amount of drug being metabolized and excreted from the body. Controlled-release of an active ingredient can be stimulated by various conditions including, but not limited to, pH, temperature, enzymes, water, or other physiological conditions or compounds. 5.

[00257] In certain embodiments, methods herein comprise administering particular oral formulations provided herein to, e.g., overcome limitations associated with IV or SC administration of cytidine analogs. For example, IV or SC administration may limit the ability to deliver a cytidine analog for longer periods of time on a regular basis, thereby potentially limiting the maximal efficacy of the cytidine analog. Due to the difficulties of complying with the rigors of a prolonged IV or SC dosing schedule, prolonged SC or IV exposure to a cytidine analog may cause subjects (e.g., subjects with multiple cytopenias) to discontinue from the regimen. See, e.g., Lyons, R.M., et αℓ., Hematologic Response to Three Alternative Dosing Schedules of Azacitidine in Patients With Myelodysplastic Syndromes, J. Clin. Oncol. (2009) (DOL10.1200/ JC0.2008.17.1058), which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. Accordingly, in certain embodiments, methods provided herein comprise administering an oral formulation provided herein to overcome these or other limitations associated with SC or IV cytidine analog administration. For example, in certain embodiments, methods provided herein comprise administering daily to a subject an oral formulation provided herein for 7 or more, 8 or more, 9 or more, 10 or more, 11 or more, 12 or more, 13 or more, 14 or more, 15 or more, 16 or more, 17 or more, 18 or more, 19 or more, 20 or more, 21 or more, or 28 or more days. [00258] Certain embodiments herein provide methods comprising administering oral formulations of cytidine analogs provided herein comprising delivering the cytidine analog (e.g., 5-azacytidine or another cytidine analog provided herein) at a lower dose over a more prolonged period of time, as compared to IV or SC administration. In particular embodiments, such methods comprise managing dose-related cytopenias (including, e.g., dose-related cytopenias associated with 5-azacytidine) by administering an oral formulation provided herein. In certain embodiments, methods provided herein comprise administering an oral formulation provided herein to achieve an improved safety profile as compared to an IV or SC dose comprising the same cytidine analog. [00259] As described herein, certain embodiments provide methods for improved treatment of particular diseases or disorders (e.g., treatment of solid tumors) by administering an oral formulation provided herein, as compared to IV or SC administration of the cytidine analog. In particular embodiments, certain methods herein provide administering oral formulations provided herein at lower doses for more prolonged periods of time, leading to improved demethylation. For example, certain methods provided herein comprise administering an oral formulation provided herein to treat a solid tumor while avoiding certain dose-limiting-toxicity-related side effects associated with dosing the cytidine analog via SC or IV administration. An example of certain toxicity-related drawbacks associated with administration of a cytidine analog are described, e.g., in Κ. Appleton et al.,J. Clin. Oncol., Vol. 25(29):4603-4609 (2007), which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. [00260] Particular embodiments herein provide methods for treating a subject having a disease or disorder provided herein by orally administering a pharmaceutical composition provided herein, wherein the treatment results in improved survival of the subject.

For example, FDA provides Guidance for Industry on Clinical Trial Endpoints for the Approval of Cancer Drugs and Biologies (http://www.fda.gov/CbER/gdlns/clintrialend.htm). The FDA endpoints include, but are not limited to, Overall Survival, Endpoints Based on Tumor Assessments such as (i) Disease-Free Survival (ii) Objective Response Rate, (iii) Time to Progression and Progression-Free Survival and (iv) Time-to-Treatment Failure. Endpoints Involving Symptom Endpoints may include Specific Symptom Endpoints such as (i) Time to progression of cancer symptoms and (ii) A composite symptom endpoint. Biomarkers assayed from blood or body fluids may also be useful to determine the management of the disease. [00261] In certain embodiments, the methods of treating disorders of abnormal cell proliferation comprise orally administering a formulation of a cytidine analog with food. In certain embodiments, the methods of treating disorders of abnormal cell proliferation comprise orally administering a formulation of a cytidine analog without food. In certain embodiments, pharmacological parameters (e.g., Cmax, Tmax) depend on the fed state of the subject. In certain embodiments, the formulation of the cytidine analog is administered sublingually. [00262] In certain embodiments, the cytidine analog, e.g., 5-azacytidine or another cytidine analog provided herein, is not co-administered with a cytidine deaminase inhibitor.

Certain embodiments herein provide methods of treating a disease or disorder provided herein (e.g., a disease associated with abnormal cell proliferation) comprising orally administering a cytidine analog provided herein for release substantially in the stomach, wherein the methods avoid adverse effects associated with administering a cytidine deaminase inhibitor (e.g., THU) by not co-administering the cytidine deaminase inhibitor with the cytidine analog. In particular embodiments, a cytidine deaminase inhibitor (e.g., THU) is co-administered with the cytidine analog in an amount of, e.g., less than about 500 mg/d, less than about 200 mg/d, less than about 150 mg/d, less than about 100 mg/d, less than about 50 mg/d, less than about 25 mg/d, less than about 10 mg/d, less than about 5 mg/d, less than about 1 mg/d, or less than about 0.1 mg/d. [00263] Certain embodiments herein provide methods for delivering a cytidine analog to a subject comprising administering to the subject in need thereof an oral formulation comprising a cytidine analog. In particular embodiments, oral formulations comprise (1) a therapeutically effective amount of a cytidine analog; and (2) an optional drug release controlling component capable of releasing the cytidine analog substantially in the stomach after a subject ingests the oral formulation comprising the cytidine analog. Certain embodiments herein provide a method for enhancing the oral bioavailability of a cytidine analog in a subject. Certain embodiments herein provide a method of increasing the oral bioavailability of a cytidine analog comprising orally administering a pharmaceutical composition provided herein. In certain methods provided herein, a pharmaceutical composition provided herein is orally administered to a subject, contacts the biological fluids of the subject’s body, and is absorbed in the upper gastrointestinal tract, such as, for example, substantially in the stomach. [00264] Certain embodiments herein provide a method of achieving a particular exposure value provided herein by administering an oral formulation comprising a cytidine analog provided herein. Certain embodiments herein provide a method of achieving a particular oral bioavailability value provided herein by administering an oral formulation comprising a cytidine analog provided herein. Certain embodiments herein provide a method of achieving a particular AUC value provided herein by administering an oral formulation comprising a cytidine analog provided herein. Certain embodiments herein provide a method of achieving a particular Cmax value provided herein by administering an oral formulation comprising a cytidine analog provided herein. Certain embodiments herein provide a method of achieving a particular Tmax value provided herein by administering an oral formulation comprising a cytidine analog provided herein. [00265] Certain embodiments herein provide methods of treating a condition involving undesirable or uncontrolled cell proliferation by administering an oral formulation comprising a cytidine analog as provided herein. Such conditions include, e.g., benign tumors, various types of cancers such as primary tumors and tumor metastasis, solid tumors (e.g., relapsed or refractory solid tumors), hematological disorders (e.g. leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome and sickle cell anemia), restenosis (e.g. coronary, carotid, and cerebral lesions), abnormal stimulation of endothelial cells (arteriosclerosis), insults to body tissue due to surgery, abnormal wound healing, abnormal angiogenesis, diseases that produce fibrosis of tissue, repetitive motion disorders, disorders of tissues that are not highly vascularized, and proliferative responses associated with organ transplants. [00266] In certain embodiments, cells in a benign tumor retain their differentiated features and do not divide in a completely uncontrolled manner. A benign tumor may be localized and/or nonmetastatic. Specific types of benign tumors that can be treated using the methods, compositions, and formulations provided herein include, e.g., hemangiomas, hepatocellular adenoma, cavernous hemangioma, focal nodular hyperplasia, acoustic neuromas, neurofibroma, bile duct adenoma, bile duct cystanoma, fibroma, lipomas, leiomyomas, mesotheliomas, teratomas, myxomas, nodular regenerative hyperplasia, trachomas and pyogenic granulomas. [00267] In certain embodiments, cells in a malignant tumor become undifferentiated, do not respond to the body’s growth control signals, and/or multiply in an uncontrolled manner. The malignant tumor may be invasive and capable of spreading to distant sites (metastasizing). Malignant tumors may be divided into two categories: primary and secondary. Primary tumors arise directly from the tissue in which they are found. A secondary tumor, or metastasis, is a tumor which is originated elsewhere in the body but has now spread to a distant organ. The common routes for metastasis are direct growth into adjacent structures, spread through the vascular or lymphatic systems, and tracking along tissue planes and body spaces (peritoneal fluid, cerebrospinal fluid, etc.). [00268] Without being limited by a particular theory, methylation can lead to the silencing of genes critical to cellular control (i.e., epigenetic gene silencing), and can be an early event in the development of malignant tumors including, e.g., colorectal cancer or lung cancer. See, e.g., M.V. Brock et αℓ., Ν. Engl. J. Med., 2008, 358(11):1118-28; Ρ.Μ. Das et αℓ.,Μοℓ. Cancer, 2006, 5(28); G. Gifford et αℓ., Clin. Cancer Res., 2004, 10:4420-26; J.G. Herman et αℓ., Ν. Engl. J. Med., 2003, 349:2042-54; Α.Μ. Jubb et al.,J. Pathology, 2001, 195:111-34. Accordingly, in certain embodiments, without being limited by a particular theory, methods herein provide using oral formulations provided herein to prevent or reverse epigenetic gene silencing, e.g., by reversing abnormal DNA methylation. In specific embodiments, oral formulations provided herein are used for early intervention to prevent the development of cancer in patients at risk of developing cancer, e.g., familial polyposis or lung cancer, wherein a cause of the cancer is epigenetic gene silencing. In particular embodiments, such early intervention would be impractical by means other than oral administration (e.g., IV or SC administration). In specific embodiments, oral formulations provided herein are used for early intervention to prevent the recurrence of cancer in patients at risk for early relapse, e.g., colorectal cancer or non-small-cell lung cancer. In certain embodiments, the early intervention is achieved via prolonged oral dosing schedules, using formulations and/or methods as described herein. Certain embodiments provide methods for administering oral formulations provided herein to reverse the effect of gene silencing, e.g., in patients at risk of gene silencing due to epigenetic changes. [00269] In certain embodiments, specific types of cancers or malignant tumors, either primary or secondary, that can be treated using the methods, compositions, and formulations provided herein include, e.g., leukemia, lymphoma, breast cancer, skin cancer, bone cancer, prostate cancer, liver cancer, lung cancer (e.g., non-small-cell lung cancer and small-cell lung cancer), brain cancer, cancer of the larynx, gall bladder, pancreas, rectum, uterine, prostate, parathyroid, thyroid, adrenal, neural tissue, head and neck, colon, stomach, bronchi, kidney, or bladder, basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma of both ulcerating and papillary type, melanoma, metastatic skin carcinoma, sarcoma, osteo sarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, veticulum cell sarcoma, myeloma, multiple myeloma, giant cell tumor, gallstones, islet cell tumor, primary brain tumor, acute and chronic lymphocytic and granulocytic tumors, hairycell tumor, adenoma, hyperplasia, medullary carcinoma, pheochromocytoma, mucosal neuronmas, intestinal ganglioneuromas, hyperplastic comeal nerve tumor, marfanoid habitus tumor, Wilm's tumor, seminoma, ovarian cancer, leiomyoma tumor, cervical squamous cell carcinoma, cervical dysplasia and in situ carcinoma, neuroblastoma, retinoblastoma, medulloblastoma, soft tissue sarcoma, malignant carcinoid, topical skin lesion, mycosis fungoides, rhabdomyosarcoma, Kaposi's sarcoma, osteogenic and other sarcoma, malignant hypercalcemia, renal cell tumor, polycythermia vera, adenocarcinoma, glioblastoma multiforma, malignant melanoma, epidermoid carcinoma, other carcinomas and sarcomas, relapsed or refractory solid tumors, and advanced metastatic solid tumors. [00270] Particular embodiments herein provide using the methods, compositions, and formulations provided herein to treat abnormal cell proliferation due to, e.g., insults to body tissue during surgery for a variety of surgical procedures, including, e.g., joint surgery, bowel surgery, and cheloid scarring. Proliferative responses associated with organ transplantation that may be treated using the methods, compositions, and formulations provided herein include those proliferative responses contributing to potential organ rejections or associated complications. Specifically, these proliferative responses may occur during transplantation of the heart, lung (e.g., non-small-cell lung cancer and small-cell lung cancer), liver, kidney, and other body organs or organ systems. [00271] In certain embodiments, the amount of the cytidine analog in the oral formulations provided herein, the methods of administration thereof, or the methods of treatment as set forth herein, is a specific dosage amount as provided herein. 2. Biomarkers [00272] In certain embodiments, appropriate biomarkers may be used to determine or predict the effect of the methods provided herein on the disease state and to provide guidance as to the dosing schedule. For example, particular embodiments herein provide a method for determining whether a patient diagnosed with cancer has an increased probability of obtaining a greater benefit from treatment with a pharmaceutical composition comprising a cytidine analog, e.g., by assessing the patient’s nucleic acid methylation status. In particular embodiments, the cytidine analog is 5-azacytidine. In particular embodiments, the cytidine analog is decitabine. In particular embodiments, the nucleic acid is DNA or RNA. In particular embodiments, the greater benefit is an overall survival benefit. In particular embodiments, the methylation status is examined in one or more genes, e.g., genes associated with the particular cancer. Specific embodiments involve methods for determining whether baseline DNA methylation levels influence overall survival in patients with cancer treated with a cytidine analog, such as 5-azacytidine or decitabine. Specific embodiments provide methods for determining whether gene promoter methylation levels influence overall survival in patients with cancer. [00273] In one embodiment, provided herein is a method for determining whether a patient diagnosed with cancer has an increased probability of obtaining a greater benefit from treatment with a pharmaceutical composition comprising a cytidine analog by assessing the gene expression profile in the patient. In one embodiment, provided herein is a method for determining whether a patient diagnosed with cancer has an increased probability of obtaining a greater benefit from treatment with a pharmaceutical composition comprising a cytidine analog by assessing molecular markers, including one or more cell cycle markers, apoptosis markers, and DNA damage markers. In particular embodiments, the cytidine analog is 5-azacytidine. In particular embodiments, the cytidine analog is decitabine. In particular embodiments, the greater benefit is an overall survival benefit. [00274] In certain embodiments, appropriate biomarkers may be used to determine or predict the effect of the pharmaceutical compositions comprising cytidine analogs on the disease state and to provide guidance to the dosing schedule. For example, particular embodiments herein provide a method of determining whether a patient diagnosed with a solid tumor, leukemia, lymphoma, multiple myeloma, MDS, or AML, has an increased probability of obtaining a greater benefit from treatment with a pharmaceutical composition comprising a cytidine analog by assessing the patient’s nucleic acid methylation status. In particular embodiments, the cytidine analog is azacitidine. In particular embodiments, the cytidine analog is decitabine. In particular embodiments, the nucleic acid is DNA or RNA. In particular embodiments, the greater benefit is an overall survival benefit. In particular embodiments, the methylation status is examined in one or more genes, e.g., genes associated with the solid tumor, leukemia, lymphoma, multiple myeloma, MDS, or AML. Specific embodiments involve methods for determining whether baseline DNA methylation levels influence overall survival in patients treated with azacitidine. Specific embodiments involve methods for determining whether baseline DNA methylation levels influence overall survival in patients treated with decitabine. Specific embodiments provide methods for determining whether gene promoter methylation levels influence overall survival in patients. [00275] For example, specific embodiments herein provide methods for evaluating the influence of gene methylation on prolonged survival in patients with a solid tumor (e.g., a relapsed or refractory solid tumor). In particular embodiments, such evaluation is used to predict overall survival in patients with a solid tumor, e.g., upon treatment with a pharmaceutical composition comprising a cytidine analog, as provided herein. In particular embodiments, such evaluation is used for therapeutic decision-making. In specific embodiments, such therapeutic decision-making includes planning or adjusting a patient’s treatment, e.g., the dosing regimen, amount, and/or duration of administration of the cytidine analogue. [00276] Certain embodiments provide methods of identifying individual patients diagnosed with a solid tumor having an increased probability of obtaining an overall survival benefit from cytidine analog treatment, using analysis of methylation levels, e.g., in particular genes. In some embodiments, lower levels of nucleic acid methylation are associated with an increased probability of obtaining improved overall survival following treatment with a cytidine analog. In some embodiments, higher levels of nucleic acid methylation are associated with an increased probability of obtaining improved overall survival following treatment with a cytidine analog. In some embodiments, a particular pattern or signature of nucleic acid methylation of multiple genes are associated with an increased probability of obtaining improved overall survival following treatment with a cytidine analog. In some embodiments, the increased probability of obtaining improved overall survival following treatment is at least a 5% greater probability, at least a 10% greater probability, at least a 20% greater probability, at least a 30% greater probability, at least a 40% greater probability, at least a 50% greater probability, at least a 60% greater probability, at least a 70% greater probability, at least an 80% greater probability, at least a 90% greater probability, at least a 100% greater probability, at least a 125% greater probability, at least a 150% greater probability, at least a 175% greater probability, at least a 200% greater probability, at least a 250% greater probability, at least a 300% greater probability, at least a 400% greater probability, or at least a 500% greater probability of obtaining improved overall survival following treatment, e.g., using a pharmaceutical composition comprising a cytidine analog as provided herein. In particular embodiments, the greater probability of obtaining improved overall survival following treatment is a greater probability as compared to the average probability of a particular comparison population of patients. [00277] In particular embodiments, nucleic acid (e.g., DNA or RNA) hypermethylation status may be determined by any method known in the art. In certain embodiments, DNA hypermethylation status may be determined using the bone marrow aspirates of patients diagnosed with cancer, e.g., by using quantitative real-time methylation specific PCR (“qMSP”). In certain embodiments, the methylation analysis may involve bisulfite conversion of genomic DNA. For example, in certain embodiments, bisulfite treatment of DNA is used to convert non-methylated CpG sites to UpG, leaving methylated CpG sites intact. See, e.g., Frommer, Μ., et αℓ., Proc. Nat’l Acad. Sci. USA 1992, 89:1827-31. Commercially available kits may be used for such bisulfite treatment. In certain embodiments, to facilitate methylation PCR, primers are designed as known in the art, e.g., outer primers which amplify DNA regardless of methylation status, and nested primers which bind to methylated or non-methylated sequences within the region amplified by the first PCR. See, e.g., Li et αℓ., Bioinformatics 2002, 18:1427-31. In certain embodiments, probes are designed, e.g., probes which bind to the bisulfite-treated DNA regardless of methylation status. In certain embodiments, CpG methylation is detected, e.g., following PCR amplification of bisulfite-treated DNA using outer primers. In certain embodiments, amplified product from the initial PCR reaction serves as a template for the nested PCR reaction using methylation-specific primers or non-methylation-specific primers. In certain embodiments, a standard curve is established to determine the percentage of methylated molecules in a particular sample. Methods for detecting nucleic acid methylation (e.g., RNA or DNA methylation) are known in art. See, e.g., Laird, P.W., Nature Rev. Cancer 2003, 3:253-66; Belinsky, S.A., Nature Rev. Cancer 2004, 4:1-11. [00278] In certain embodiments, statistical analyses are performed to assess the influence of particular methylation levels with the potential benefit of treatment with a particular pharmaceutical composition comprising a cytidine analog. In certain embodiments, the influence of methylation on overall survival is assessed, e.g., using Cox proportional hazards models and Kaplan-Meier (KM) methodology. [00279] In certain embodiments, any gene associated with a particular solid tumor, leukemia, lymphoma, multiple myeloma, MDS, or AML may be examined for its methylation status in a patient. Particular genes associated with a solid tumor, leukemia, lymphoma, multiple myeloma, MDS, or AML, which would be suitable for use in the methods disclosed here, may be known in the art. [00280] In specific embodiments, provided herein is a method of identifying a subject who is likely to be responsive to a treatment described herein, comprising: (a) determining the level of a biomarker in a biological sample from the subject, wherein the biomarker is described herein; and (b) comparing the level of the biomarker in the biological sample to a reference level of the biomarker; wherein the subject is likely to be responsive to the treatment if the level of the biomarker in the biological sample from the subject is altered (e.g., high or low) as compared to the reference level of the biomarker.

Example 1 [00302] Clinical studies were conducted to evaluate oral azacitidine as a single agent and in combination with Carboplatin or Abraxane® in subjects with relapsed or refractory solid tumors. [00303] One objective of the study was to evaluate the safety and to define the Maximal Tolerated Dose (MTD) or the Maximal Administered Dose (MAD) of oral azacitidine as a single agent and in combination with carboplatin (CBDCA) or paclitaxel protein-bound particles (Abraxane® [ΑΒΧ]) in subjects with relapsed or refractory solid tumors. [00304] Other objectives of the study included: (1) to examine the impact, if any, of CBDCA or ΑΒΧ on the pharmacokinetics (ΡΚ) of oral azacitidine; (2) to examine the impact, if any, of oral azacitidine on the ΡΚ of CBDCA or ΑΒΧ; (3) to evaluate the pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of oral azacitidine as a single agent and in combination with CBDCA and ΑΒΧ in blood, plasma and tumor tissue; and (4) to make a preliminary assessment of the anti-tumor activity of oral azacitidine as a single agent and in combination with CBDCA and ΑΒΧ in specific tumor types. [00305] Additional objectives of the study included: to determine whether there is any relationship among baseline tumor molecular characteristics (genetic or epigenetic), PD effects, and anti-tumor activity. [00306] The study was an open-label, 3-arm, multi-center, dose-escalation study of oral azacitidine in combination with either CBDCA (Arm A), ΑΒΧ (Arm Β), or as a single agent (Arm C) in subjects with relapsed or refractory solid tumors (Part 1). Subjects were assigned to each study Arm at the discretion of the investigator. A minimum of 6 subjects were assigned to each study Arm when a dose level (DL) became open for enrollment. If one (1) or zero (0) out of six (6) subjects in a DL experienced dose limiting toxicity (DLT), the dose of oral azacitidine was escalated in the successive DL. A limited number of oral azacitidine DLs were explored to arrive at a recommended Part 2 dose (RP2D) of oral azacitidine for each study Arm. The RP2D may be the MTD, MAD, or a lower dose depending on the tolerability, ΡΚ, and PD observed. Part 1 was followed by expansion cohorts at the RP2D in specific tumor types (Part 2). Approximately 60 subjects were enrolled in Part 1, and approximately 100 subjects were enrolled in Part 2. Safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics data were evaluated. [00307] In Part 1, Arms A and Β, Cycle 1 was 28 days in duration. Subsequent treatment Cycles were 21 days in duration. In Arm C, all Cycles were 21 days in duration. [00308] Part 1 Design: Subjects may continue to receive their assigned combination treatment if they have no unacceptable toxicity and if there is no clinical or radiographic evidence of disease progression or the investigator deems that the subject is deriving potential benefit. If combination treatment is suspended for unacceptable toxicity that is believed to be related to CBDCA in Arm A or ΑΒΧ in Arm Β, subjects may continue to take single agent oral azacitidine at their assigned DL once the toxicity resolves to at least grade 1. Subjects in Arm C receive single agent oral azacitidine in all Cycles up to approximately 1 year from the start of therapy or until they experience unacceptable toxicity or progressive disease, as assessed by the investigator, whichever occurs first. Escalation of the oral azacitidine dose continues independently in each Arm until the RP2D of oral azacitidine as a single agent and in combination with CBDCA and ΑΒΧ is defined. The RP2D may be different for each study Arm. [00309] Part 2 Design: Expansion cohorts of up to 20 subjects for each of several specific tumor types are enrolled at the RP2D for each Arm. In addition to further exploring the safety and PD activity of oral azacitidine alone and in combination with CBDCA or ΑΒΧ in specific tumor types, this part of the study is designed to make an initial assessment of anti-tumor activity and its potential association with candidate predictive biomarkers. Tumor biopsies are performed in Part 2. [00310] Study Population: Men and women, 18 years or older, with histological or cytological confirmation of advanced unresectable solid tumors, including those who have progressed on (or not been able to tolerate) standard anti-cancer therapy, or for whom no other known effective therapy exists, or for those who have declined standard therapy. [00311] Length of Study: The duration of Part 1 of the study from first subject screened to last subject last visit is approximately 1 year. Part 2 of the study lasts approximately 18 months making the entire duration of the study approximately 2.5 years. [00312] Study Treatments: [00313] Part 1: Subjects receive oral azacitidine as a single agent for the first 7 days of study. Beginning on Cycle 1, Day 8, subjects in Arms A and Β begin combination treatment with CBDCA or ΑΒΧ, respectively. Subjects may continue to receive their assigned combination until they experience disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, whichever occurs first. Subjects in Arm C receive single agent oral azacitidine in all Cycles until they experience unacceptable toxicity or progressive disease, whichever occurs first. [00314] The dose of oral azacitidine in each Arm is escalated (or reduced) based on tolerability with a fixed dose of CBDCA or ΑΒΧ in the first 28-day Cycle, or as a single agent in the first 21-day Cycle, until the RP2D is defined. [00315] All study Arms begin at Dose Level 1 (DL1). If DL1 is declared tolerable, Dose Level 2 (DL2) opens for enrollment. If DL2 is declared tolerable, this dose and schedule are explored in Part 2 of the study. If DL2 exceeds the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), DL1 is explored in Part 2. If DL1 exceeds MTD, Dose Level-1 (DL-1) opens for enrollment. [00316] For Arms A and Β, if DL-1 is declared tolerable, Dose Level-2 (DL-2) opens for enrollment. If DL-2 is declared tolerable, this dose and schedule are explored in Part 2. If DL-2 exceeds MTD, DL-1 is explored in Part 2. If DL-1 exceeds MTD, enrollment to that Arm stops (Figure 4). [00317] For Arm C, if DL-1 is declared tolerable, that dose and schedule are explored in Part 2. If DL-1 exceeds MTD, DL-2 opens for enrollment. If DL-2 is declared tolerable, that dose and schedule are explored in Part 2. If DL-2 exceeds MTD, enrollment into Arm C stops (Figure 5). [00318] In certain embodiments, subjects receive a dose of a prophylactic anti-emetic, for example, a 5-ΗΤ3 antagonist, prior to each dose of oral azacitidine. [00319] Part 2: Subjects in Part 2 of the study receive oral azacitidine alone (Arm C) or in combination with CBDCA (Arm A) or ΑΒΧ (Arm Β) according to the RP2D established for each Arm in Part 1. All treatment Cycles in Part 2 are 21 days in duration. Each specific tumor type in Part 2 receives treatment according to one of the three Arms. About 14 to 20 patients are enrolled per tumor type. [00320] Assignment of Subject to Study Arms: At the time of enrollment in Part 1, subjects who meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria are assigned to either Arm A (oral azacitidine with CBDCA), Arm Β (oral azacitidine with Abraxane®), or Arm C (single agent oral azacitidine). Assignment of subjects to each of these study Arms is at the discretion of the investigator, based on the suitability of the regimen(s) for the subject and availability of open enrollment slots. The DLs for Arms A, Β, and C are shown in Table 1, Table 2, and Table 3, respectively.

The primary efficacy variables are tumor response at the end of treatment, and the proportion of subjects alive and progression-free (progression-free survival; PFS) at the end of Cycle 6. Tumor response is based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 for disease states which require at least one measurable target lesion at baseline for study eligibility. Progression-free survival rates are computed using the Kaplan-Meier estimates. Duration of response is reported in subjects who have a complete or partial response. Ninety percent confidence intervals (90% CIs) of the response rate at the end of treatment, and of the PFS rate at time of each scheduled response assessment (i.e., Cycles 2, 4, 6, etc.) are provided by tumor type. Other endpoints that are explored include time-to-tumor-progression and overall survival. [00322] The influence of major disease characteristics and prognostic indications are considered in relationship to efficacy, with special attention given to subjects in Arm A who were previously treated with a platin and to subjects in Arm Β who were previously treated with a taxane. Full details on the efficacy analysis are given in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). [00323] Safety Assessments: Safety assessments include adverse events (AEs), physical examinations (PEs), (including height and body weight); vital signs (including systolic/diastolic blood pressure [BP], pulse rate, respiratory rate, and oral temperature); Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status; 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG [including rhythm, heart rate, PR, QRS, and QT intervals]); complete blood count (CBC) (including hemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood cell count with indices [mean corpuscular volume {MCV}, mean corpuscular hemoglobin {MCH}, and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration {MCHC}, white blood cell [WBC] count with absolute differential [neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils], and platelet count); coagulation (international normalized ratio [INR], prothrombin time [PT], and partial thromboplastin time [PTT]); serum chemistry (non-fasting) (including albumin, alkaline phosphatase, bicarbonate, blood urea nitrogen [BUN], calcium, chloride, creatinine, glucose, lactic dehydrogenase [LDH], phosphorus, potassium, aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alanine aminotransferase [ALT], sodium, total bilirubin, total protein, and uric acid); screening serum pregnancy test required for all females of child-bearing potential (FCBP) prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 dosing (test result must be obtained and read prior to dosing on Day 1 .); tumor biopsy (optional); and tumor assessment. [00324] Study Endpoints: The nature, incidence and severity of AEs are evaluated using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) criteria, Version 4.0. For oral azacitidine, CBDCA, and ΑΒΧ (administered alone and in combination), the following plasma ΡΚ parameters are assessed: (1) maximum observed concentration in plasma (Cmax); (2) area under the concentration-time curve (AUC); (3) time to maximum concentration (tmax); (4) terminal half-life (ti/2); (5) apparent total body clearance (CL/F); and (6) apparent volume of distribution (Vz/F). To evaluate the PD effects of oral azacitidine in blood, plasma, and tumor tissue, the following endpoints are collected: (1) change from baseline (Cycle 1 Day 1 pre-dose) in DNA methylation (global and genespecific assays) in whole blood and tumor tissue (as available in Part 1); (2) reduction from baseline (Cycle 1 Day 1 predose) in DNMT1 protein levels in tumor tissue (as available in Part 1). Anti-tumor activity endpoints using tumor-specific response criteria for each tumor type include: (1) response rate and duration of response; and (2) progression-free survival (PFS). Molecular characteristics of the blood and tumor, including, but not limited to, DNA/RNA methylation, gene sequence and mRNA/miRNA expression, may be evaluated at baseline and post-therapy for examination in relation to tumor responses. [00325] Part 1/Arm A: Subjects in Arm A receive their first dose of oral azacitidine at their assigned DF in the clinic on Cycle 1 Day 1 along with ΡΚ (predose through 8 hours post-dose oral azacitidine) and predose PD blood (mandatory) and tumor (optional) sampling. On Days 2 through 7, subjects self-administer oral azacitidine daily according to their assigned DF. Subjects return to the clinic for CBDCA dosing on Day 8 along with predose PD sampling (blood). CBDCA is administered at AUC = 4 using the Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) calculation from the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) formula below as an i.v. infusion over 1 hour. [00326] Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) Equation for GFR: This IDMStraceable MDRD study equation calculator is for use with Scr reported in mg/dF: GFR (mL/min/1.73 m2) = 175 χ (Scr)-1154 χ (Age)-0'203 χ (0.742 if female) χ (1.212 if African American) (conventional units) [00327] The equation does not require weight because the results are reported normalized to 1.73 m2 body surface area (BSA), which is an accepted average adult surface area. CBDCA dose (mg) = 4 (GFR + 25) [00328] An on-line calculator can be found at the following link: http://www.nkdep.nih.gov/professionals/gfr_calculators/idms_con.htm [00329] In some embodiments, oral azacitidine is not administered on Day 8 so that the ΡΚ profile of CBDCA alone can be established. On Day 9, subjects return to the clinic for CBDCA ΡΚ sampling approximately 24 hours after the end of the initial infusion and before administration of oral azacitidine. On Day 9, subjects receive their dose of oral azacitidine at their assigned DL in the clinic. On Days 10 through 14, subjects self-administer oral azacitidine. Subjects return to the clinic on Cycle 1 Day 15 for blood PD sampling (mandatory) and tumor biopsy (optional). On Days 15 through 21 no study medication is administered (except for subjects in DL-2, who self-administer oral azacitidine daily). On Day 22, subjects return to clinic for administration of oral azacitidine with predose blood collection (mandatory) for PD analysis. On Days 23 through 28 of Cycle 1, subjects self-administer oral azacitidine daily according to their assigned DL (Figure 1). [00330] Subjects who complete Cycle 1 meet the following hematologic criteria at the beginning of each subsequent Cycle: (1) ANC > 1.5 x 109L; and (2) Platelets > 75 x 109/L. [00331] If the hematologic criteria are not met, the start of Cycle 2 may be delayed for up to 7 days to allow the counts to recover. If recovery has not occurred after 7 days, this is considered a DLT. [00332] In Cycle 2, Arm A subjects receive oral azacitidine in the clinic on Day 1 followed by CBDCA AUC = 4 as an i.v. infusion over 1 hour, along with ΡΚ (predose through 8 hours following the end of the CBDCA infusion). On Day 2, subjects return to the clinic for ΡΚ sampling approximately 24 hours following the end of the CBDCA infusion. On Days 2 through 7, subjects self-administer oral azacitidine daily according to their assigned DL. On Days 8 through 14 of Cycle 2, no study medication is administered (except for subjects in DL-2 who self-administer oral azacitidine at their assigned DL). On Days 15 through 21, subjects self-administer oral azacitidine at their assigned DL. [00333] In Cycles 3 and beyond, Arm A subjects receive oral azacitidine at their assigned DL in the clinic on Day 1 followed by CBDCA AUC = 4 as an i.v. infusion over 1 hour. On Days 2 through 7, subjects self-administer oral azacitidine daily according to their assigned DL. On Days 8 through 14, no study medication is administered (except for subjects in DL-2 who self-administer oral azacitidine at their assigned DL). On Days 15 through 21, subjects self-administer oral azacitidine at their assigned DL. Subjects may continue to receive their assigned combination treatment if they have no unacceptable toxicity and if there is no clinical or radiographic evidence of disease progression or they are deriving potential benefit as assessed by the investigator. If combination treatment is suspended for unacceptable toxicity that is believed to be related to CBDCA, subjects may continue to take single agent oral azacitidine at their assigned DL once the toxicity resolves. [00334] Part 1/Arm Β: Subjects in Arm Β receive their first dose of oral azacitidine at their assigned DL in the clinic on Cycle 1 Day 1 along with ΡΚ (predose through 8 hours postdose oral azacitidine) and PD blood sampling. Tumor biopsy (optional) is obtained prior to the first dose of oral azacitidine on Day 1. On Days 2 through 7, subjects self-administer oral azacitidine daily according to their assigned DL. Subjects return to the clinic on Day 8 for oral azacitidine followed by ΑΒΧ 100 mg/m2 i.v., along with ΡΚ (predose through approximately 8 hours post end of ΑΒΧ infusion) and predose PD blood sampling. Subjects return to the clinic on Days 9, 10 and 11 for ΑΒΧ ΡΚ sampling approximately 24, 48 and 72 hours from the end of the ΑΒΧ infusion. On Days 9 through 14, subjects self-administer oral azacitidine at their assigned DL. On Cycle 1 Day 15, subjects report to the clinic for blood PD sampling (mandatory) and tumor biopsy (optional). Abraxane® 100 mg/m2 i.v is administered on Cycle 1 Day 15 followed by ΡΚ sampling (predose through approximately 8 hours after the end of the ΑΒΧ infusion). Subjects return to the clinic on Days 16, 17, and 18 for ΑΒΧ ΡΚ sampling approximately 24, 48 and 72 hours from the end of the ΑΒΧ infusion. On Days 15 through 21, no oral azacitidine is administered (except for subjects assigned to DL-2 who self-administer oral azacitidine daily according to their assigned DL on Days 19 through 21). In some embodiments, oral azacitidine is not administered on Days 15 through 18 of Cycle 1 for subjects in DL-2 so that the ΡΚ profile of ΑΒΧ alone can be established. On Day 22, subjects return to the clinic for oral azacitidine followed by ΑΒΧ 100 mg/m2 i.v. in the clinic after obtaining predose blood (mandatory) PD sampling. On Days 23 through 28, subjects self-administer oral azacitidine daily according to their assigned DL (Figure 2). [00335] Subjects who complete Cycle 1 meet the following hematologic criteria at the beginning of each subsequent Cycle: (1) Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) > 1.5 x 109/L; and (2) Platelets > 75 x 109/L. [00336] If the hematologic criteria are not met, the start of Cycle 2 may be delayed for up to 7 days to allow the hematologic counts to recover. If recovery has not occurred after 7 days, this is considered a DLT. [00337] In Cycle 2, Arm Β subjects receive oral azacitidine followed by ΑΒΧ 100 mg/m2 i.v on Day 1. On Days 2 through 7, subjects self-administer oral azacitidine at their assigned DL. Subjects return to the clinic on Day 8 for ΑΒΧ 100 mg/m2 i.v. In some embodiments, oral azacitidine is not administered on Days 8 through 14 (except for subjects in DL-2 who self-administer oral azacitidine at their assigned DL). Oral azacitidine followed by ΑΒΧ 100 mg/m2 i.v. is administered on Day 15. On Days 16 through 21, subjects self-administer oral azacitidine at their assigned DL. Subjects who complete Cycle 2 without unacceptable toxicity and without objective evidence of disease progression as per a tumor assessment may proceed to Cycle 3. [00338] In Cycle 3 and beyond, Arm Β subjects receive oral azacitidine at their assigned DL in the clinic on Day 1, followed by ΑΒΧ 100 mg/m2 i.v. On Days 2 through 7, subjects self-administer oral azacitidine at their assigned DL. Subjects return to the clinic on Day 8 for ΑΒΧ 100 mg/m2 i.v. In some embodiments, oral azacitidine is not administered on Days 8 through 14 (except for subjects in DL-2 who self-administer oral azacitidine at their assigned DL). Oral azacitidine followed by ΑΒΧ 100 mg/m2 i.v. is administered on Day 15 in the clinic. On Days 16 through 21, subjects self-administer oral azacitidine at their assigned DL. Subjects may continue to receive their assigned combination treatment if they have no unacceptable toxicity and if there is no clinical or radiographic evidence of disease progression. If combination treatment is suspended for unacceptable toxicity that is believed to be related to ΑΒΧ, subjects may continue to take single agent oral azacitidine at their assigned DL once the toxicity resolves. [00339] Part 1/Arm C: Subjects in Arm C receive their first dose of oral azacitidine at their assigned DL in the clinic on Cycle 1 Day 1. Predose tumor collection (optional) accompanies oral azacitidine on Cycle 1 Days 1 and 15. Pre-dose PD blood collection (mandatory) accompanies oral azacitidine dosing on Cycle 1 Days 1, 8, and 15 and Cycle 2 Day 1. On Days 2 through 7, 9 through 14 and 16 through 21 of each Cycle, subjects self-administer oral azacitidine at their assigned DL; subjects in DL-1 and DL-2 only self-administer oral azacitidine Days 2 through 7 and 9 through 14 (Figure 3). [00340] In Cycle 2 and beyond, Arm C subjects self-administer oral azacitidine on Days 2 through 21; subjects in DL-1 and DL-2 only self-administer oral azacitidine on Days 2 through 14. Subjects who complete Cycle 2 without unacceptable toxicity and without objective evidence of disease progression on a tumor assessment may proceed to Cycle 3. Subjects may continue to receive oral azacitidine at their assigned DL as long as they have no unacceptable toxicity and no clinical or radiographic evidence of disease progression. [00341] DLT Definitions: Any non-hematologic toxicity of NCI CTCAE ν 4.0 Grade = 3 that is believed to be related to oral azacitidine or to the combination of oral azacitidine with CBDCA or ΑΒΧ with the following exceptions: (1) Grade 3 emesis that responds to optimal antiemetic therapy within 72 hours; (2) Grade 3 diarrhea that responds to optimal medical management within 72 hours; (3) Alopecia of any grade; (4) Grade 3 fatigue in a subject who had Grade 2 fatigue at study entry and that recovers to baseline grade or less within 72 hours; and (5) Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities that are not accompanied by clinical signs or symptoms and are not believed by the investigator to be medically significant. [00342] The following hematologic toxicities are considered DLT: (1) Grade 4 neutropenia lasting > 7 days or accompanied by fever; (2) Grade 3 thrombocytopenia with clinically significant bleeding; and (3) Failure to meet hematologic criteria for starting Cycle 2 within 7 days of Cycle 1 Day 28. [00343] Definition of DLT-evaluable Subjects: To be evaluable for DLT for the purpose of dose escalation decisions, a subject must meet one of the following conditions: (1) Experienced a DLT during Cycle 1 ; or (2) Did not receive Cycle 2 Day 1 treatment due solely to not meeting hematologic criteria within 7 days of Cycle 1 Day 28 (for Arm C subjects, Cycle 1 Day 21); or (3) Completed dosing for Cycle 1 Day 28 (for Arm C subjects, Cycle 1 Day 21)without DLT and (i) missed no more than 4 total planned doses of oral azacitidine within Cycle 1; (ii) Arm A subjects: received scheduled dose of CBDCA during Cycle 1; and (iii) Arm Β subjects: received all scheduled doses of ΑΒΧ during Cycle 1. [00344] Subjects who do not meet any of the criteria for being DLT evaluable (e.g., who withdraw from study prior to the end of Cycle 1 for reasons other than DLT) are replaced so that dose escalation decisions can be based on a minimum of 6 DLT-evaluable subjects. [00345] Part 2: Once the RP2D and schedule have been determined for oral azacitidine as a single agent and in combination with CBDCA and/or ΑΒΧ in Part 1, enrollment of Part 2 of the study begins. One objective of Part 2 is to further define the safety, ΡΚ, and PD of oral azacitidine combinations with CBDCA and/or ΑΒΧ and as a single agent in subjects with particular tumor types and to explore candidate predictive biomarkers of anti-tumor activity. Up to 2 tumor types are examined for each Arm of the study. The definitive selection of tumor types evaluated in Part 2 are determined by any antitumor signal observed in Part 1. For each tumor type, enrollment proceeds in a 2-stage fashion. For each Arm, if at least 2 objective responses are seen by Cycle 6 in the first 14 subjects, an additional 6 subjects are enrolled for a total of 20 subjects. If none of the first 14 subjects has an objective response, no further subject is enrolled. [00346] PD and Predictive Biomarkers: One objective of this study is to identify a dose and schedule of oral azacitidine that is not only safe but that exhibits pharmacologic activity. Methylation changes in nucleated blood cells can provide confirmation that a dose is pharmacologically active and can help distinguish which dose and schedule shows the most compelling pharmacologic activity. [00347] Predictive biomarkers can allow prospective identification of patients who are likely to benefit clinically from the combination of oral azacitidine as a single agent or combined with CBDCA or ΑΒΧ. The PD and predictive biomarkers analyzed in this study (e.g., Part 1 or Part 2 of the study) are shown in Table 4.

See, e.g., U.S. Patent Publication No. 2009/0286752 (Αρρ. No. 12/466,213), which is incorporated herein in its entirety. [00349] Abraxane® is provided in single-use vials, for example, supplied by Celgene Corporation. Each single-use 50 mL vial contains 100 mg paclitaxel and human albumin (HA) as a stabilizer. Unreconstituted ΑΒΧ is stored at controlled room temperature (25 °C or 77 °F; excursions permitted to 15-30 °C). Reconstituted ΑΒΧ is refrigerated at 2 °C to 8 °C (36 °F to 46 °F) and used within 8 hours. Both forms are stored in an area free of environmental extremes. [00350] CBCDA may be obtained as a commercially available product through a hospital pharmacy or licensed distributor. [00351] Each dose of oral azacitidine is taken with 8 ounces (240 mL) of room temperature water. Oral azacitidine may be taken on an empty stomach or with food. If the dose is taken in the morning, subjects may consume their usual breakfast before or after administration. [00352] No adjustment of the oral azacitidine dose is allowed during Cycle 1. Oral azacitidine may be held for up to 7 days between the end of Cycle 1 and the start of Cycle 2 (to allow hematologic criteria) for Cycle 2 to begin. For subjects who experience unacceptable toxicity after the start of Cycle 2, oral azacitidine may be held for up to 7 days or until the toxicity recovers to grade 1 or less. If recovery has not occurred after 7 days, dosing is permanently discontinued. Subjects who recover within the 7 day period may resume dosing at a reduced dose on the planned Cycle day (ΐ.℮., missed doses are not made up). For the first episode of unacceptable toxicity in Cycle 2 or a later Cycle, if the subject recovers within 7 days of cessation of dosing with oral azacitidine and had previously been receiving 300 mg of oral azacitidine, the subject may resume dosing at a dose of 200 mg. If the subject had previously been receiving 200 mg of oral azacitidine, the subject may resume at a dose of 100 mg. Subjects who experience unacceptable toxicity after Cycle 2 at a dose of 100 mg may resume dosing at the same dose if they recover within 7 days of dosing cessation. [00353] For the second episode of unacceptable toxicity after Cycle 2, if the subject recovers within 7 days of cessation of dosing and had previously been receiving 200 mg of oral azacitidine, the subject may resume dosing at a dose of 100 mg. For subjects on reduced doses of oral azacitidine, the dose may be re-escalated (one dose level at a time) to their originally assigned DF provided they have not experienced unacceptable toxicity in 2 consecutive Cycles. [00354] If, prior to the second episode of unacceptable toxicity, the subject had been receiving 100 mg of oral azacitidine, dosing is permanently discontinued. Any subject who experiences a third episode of unacceptable toxicity on a reduced dose of oral azacitidine discontinues dosing permanently. No intra-subject dose escalation beyond the dose originally prescribed is allowed. [00355] For the purposes of dose adjustment, unacceptable toxicity is defined as any ΑΕ that is deemed by the investigator to be related to oral azacitidine and/or to the combination of oral azacitidine with CBDCA or ΑΒΧ and that poses a medical risk or substantial discomfort to the subject including but not limited to Grade 3 or 4 hematologic or ηοηhematologic toxicity. If the unacceptable toxicity is believed by the investigator to be more likely to be associated with the backbone agent (e.g., neuropathy with ΑΒΧ), the subject may continue on single agent oral azacitidine. [00356] Administration of Oral Azacitidine: Subjects are advised not to consume any grapefruit/grapefruit juice during the study, beginning 3 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1. Subjects drink 8 ounces (240 mL) of room temperature water with each dose. Oral azacitidine may be taken on an empty stomach or with food. If the dose is taken in the morning, subjects may consume their usual breakfast before or after administration. The breakfast meal is not to exceed 600 calories; however, the actual calorie count need not be measured or recorded. If a meal other than breakfast is consumed, a light meal (not more than 25% of a subject’s usual daily calories) may be eaten before or after dose administration. [00357] On days when subjects are not in the clinic, subjects take oral azacitidine at home. Subjects are given sufficient quantity of oral azacitidine for the dosing days at home. Subjects are instructed to inspect each oral azacitidine tablet and only take tablets that are totally intact. Subjects are instructed to return any tablet found to not be intact. Subjects are instructed to record the date and time of oral azacitidine administration in a Diary Card. On days when oral azacitidine is taken at home or on days when ΡΚ samples are not collected during the clinic visit, subjects are encouraged to ingest oral azacitidine on an empty stomach or with food, with 8 ounces (240 mL) of room temperature water. [00358] Study Results: [00359] In one embodiment, in Part 1, Arm A of the study, 5-azacytidine was dosed from Day 1 to Day 14 and CBDCA was dosed on Day 8 at AUC 4, in a 21-day cycle. Safety and PD were analyzed. In one embodiment, certain patients were dosed with 5-azacytidine at a dose of 200 mg from Day 1 to Day 14 and CBDCA at a dose of AUC 4 on Day 8, in a 21-day cycle, to treat cancers, such as, NSCLC (non-small cell lung cancer), sarcoma, CRC (colorectal cancer), melanoma, ovarian cancer, or cervical cancer. In one embodiment, certain patients were dosed with 5-azacytidine at a dose of 300 mg from Day 1 to Day 14 and CBDCA at a dose of AUC 4 on Day 8, in a 21-day cycle, to treat cancers, such as, mesothelioma, endometrial cancer, merkel cell cancer, melanoma, chodrosarcoma, NSCLC, or HNSCC (head and neck squamous cell carcinoma). [00360] In one embodiment, in Part 1, Arm Β of the study, 5-azacytidine was dosed from Day 1 to Day 14 and ΑΒΧ was dosed on Days 8 and 15 at 100 mg/m2, in a 21-day cycle. Safety and PD were analyzed. In one embodiment, certain patients were dosed with 5-azacytidine at a dose of 200 mg from Day 1 to Day 14 and ΑΒΧ at a dose of 100 mg/m2 on Days 8 and weekly thereafter, in a 21-day cycle, to treat cancers, such as, endometrial cancer, pancreatic cancer, ovarian cancer, or breast cancer. Partial responses were observed in endometrial cancer and pancreatic cancer (e.g., metastatic pancreatic cancer). For example, in one patient with metastatic pancreatic cancer, after Cycle 2, CA19-9 level was decreased from 1867 to 15, and partial response was observed for seven months or more. One patient with endometrial cancer progressed 8 months on the study after 5 cycles of Carbo/Taxol, with no evidence of disease at primary site. In one embodiment, certain patients were dosed with 5-azacytidine at a dose of 200 mg from Day 1 to Day 14 and ΑΒΧ at a dose of 100 mg/m2 on Days 8 and 15, in a 21-day cycle, to treat cancers, such as, pancreatic cancer, cholangio cancer, HNSCC, CRC, or ovarian cancer. In one embodiment, certain patients were dosed with 5-azacytidine at a dose of 300 mg from Day 1 to Day 14 and ΑΒΧ at a dose of 100 mg/m2 on Days 8 and 15, in a 21-day cycle, to treat cancers, such as, cholangio cancer, pancreatic cancer, or cervical cancer. Partial responses were observed in cervical cancer. [00361] In one embodiment, in Part 1, Arm C of the study, 5-azacytidine was dosed from Day 1 to Day 21, in a 21-day cycle (continuous). Safety and PD were analyzed. In one embodiment, certain patients were dosed with 5-azacytidine at a dose of 200 mg from Day 1 to Day 21, in a 21-day cycle, to treat cancers, such as, CRC, head and neck cancer, or GIST (gastrointestinal stromal tumor). In one embodiment, certain patients were dosed with 5-azacytidine at a dose of 300 mg from Day 1 to Day 21, in a 21-day cycle, to treat cancers, such as, CRC, NSCLC, or ΝΡ (nasopharyngeal) cancer. Partial responses were observed in nasopharyngeal cancer. [00362] Additional clinical efficacy observed in Part 1 of the study are summarized below: ARM ΑΖΑ Dose Tumor Response Time on Study Prior Regimens (best response, months on Rx) Arm A (ΑΖΑ + CBDCA) 200 mg NSCLC SD > 7 mo Erlotinib + bevacizumab (SD 16 mo) 200 mg Sarcoma SD > 7 mo Dox/Ifos (SD 3 mo) Gem/Taxotere (PD 2 mo) 300 mg Endometrial CA-125 | > 100% > 4 mo Carbo/Taxol (SD 5 mo) Arm Β (ΑΖΑ + ΑΒΧ) 200 mg Pancreatic Mixed response > 3 mo Gem/Reolysin (SD 8 mo) 200 mg Endometrial PR ~ 8 mo Carbo/Taxol (SD 3 mo) CC-122 (PD 1 mo) 200 mg Pancreatic PR > 7 mo Gem (SD 7 mo) 200 mg Pancreatic CA 19-9 | > 50% ~ 4 mo Gem (PD 3 mo) Tivantinib/erlotinib (PD 1 mo) 200 mg Colorectal 28% | target > 3 mo 5FU/Leuc/bev (2 mo) refractory to prior treatment 200 mg Ovarian CA 125 | > 50% > 2 mo - Arm C (ΑΖΑ) 300 mg Nasopharyngeal PR > 3 mo 5FU/cisplat (PR 5 mo) Erbitux (PD 3 mo) [00363] In one embodiment, in Part 2, Arm A of the study, 5-azacytidine was dosed orally, e.g., at 300 mg (on Days 1 to 14 of a 21-day cycle), and CBDCA was dosed, e.g., at AUC 4, to treat patients with solid tumor, such as relapsed and refractory bladder cancer (e.g., bladder carcinoma, or urothelial malignancies) or relapsed and refractory ovarian cancer (e.g., epithelial ovarian carcinoma). Tissue samples are analyzed to evaluate activity and efficacy. [00364] In one embodiment, in Part 2, Arm Β of the study, 5-azacytidine was dosed orally, e.g., at 200 mg (on Days 1 to 14 of a 21-day cycle), in combination with ΑΒΧ (e.g., at a dose of 100 mg/m2), to treat patients with solid tumor, such as relapsed and refractory NSCLC (non-small cell lung cancer) or relapsed and refractory pancreatic cancer. Tissue samples are analyzed to evaluate activity and efficacy. [00365] In one embodiment, in Part 2, Arm C of the study, 5-azacytidine was dosed alone (e.g., orally at a dose of 200 mg or 300 mg on Days 1 to 14 of a 21-day cycle) to treat patients with solid tumor, such as relapsed and refractory colorectal cancer. Tissue samples are analyzed to evaluate activity and efficacy. Β. Example 2 [00366] DNA methylation is employed as a biomarker to monitor responses in patients treated with azacitidine in the clinical studies described herein. Analysis is performed with an Infinium Assay (commercially available from Illumina, Inc., San Diego, California). The Infinium Assay combined with BeadChips allows large-scale interrogation of variations in the human genome. For example, the Infinium HumanMethylation27 BeadChip enables interrogation of 27,578 CpG loci, covering over 14,000 genes. The DNA Methylation Assay protocol includes the following steps: (1) bisulfite conversion; (2) DNA amplification; (3) DNA fragmentation; (4) DNA precipitation; (5) DNA hybridization to BeadChip; (6) extension and staining on BeadChip; and (7) imaging of BeadChip. In other embodiments, DNA methylation assay with 450Κ array (instead of 27Κ array) is used. [00367] The assay for methylation is used to detect methylation status at individual CpG loci by typing bisulfite-converted DNA. Methylation protected C from conversion, whereas unmethylated C is converted to Τ. A pair of bead-bound probes is used to detect the presence of Τ or C by hybridization followed by single-base extension with a labeled nucleotide. Up to twelve samples are profiled in parallel. Blood samples were collected and DNA methylation was analyzed in parallel. In other embodiments, bone marrow samples are collected and DNA methylation analyzed in parallel. [00368] Methylation of plasma DNA and PBMC DNA of patients from Part I of the clinical study exemplified in Example 1 was analyzed. C. Example 3 [00369] Clinical studies are conducted to assess the ability of an oral formulation comprising a cytidine analog, such as 5-azacytidine, to treat patients having lung cancer, e.g., non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Such studies may include, e.g., an assessment of the ability to stop or reverse the growth of particular NSCLC cell types in patients having NSCLC). In certain clinical studies, patients are tested for particular NSCLC cell types, prior to administration of the oral formulation. In certain clinical studies, patients with cell types known or believed to benefit preferentially from cytidine analog (e.g., 5-azacytidine) administration may be enrolled. In certain clinical studies, patients having NSCLC are enrolled without analysis of particular NSCLC cell type. In certain clinical studies, patients having any type of NSCLC cells are candidates for treatment with an oral formulation provided herein. [00370] In certain clinical studies, patients from any of the three main NSCLC groups may be enrolled, i.e., (1) patients with tumors that are surgically resectable; (2) patients with either locally or regionally advanced lung cancer; or (3) patients with distant metastases at the time of diagnosis. In certain clinical studies, patients may be currently undergoing additional treatment for NSCLC, including, e.g., surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy. [00371] In certain clinical studies, patients who are administered an oral formulation comprising a cytidine analog (e.g., 5-azacytidine) may also be administered one or more additional therapeutic agents, examples of which are disclosed herein. The additional therapeutic agent(s) may be administered in the same oral formulation as the cytidine analog, or may be co-administered (e.g., via ΡΟ, SC or IV administration) in combination with an oral formulation comprising the cytidine analog. The appropriate amount and dosing schedule for an additional therapeutic agent may be determined for a particular patient using methods known in the art. [00372] In particular embodiments, the co-administered agent is carboplatin. In particular embodiments, the co-administered agent is paclitaxel (e.g., Abraxane®). [00373] An association between gene methylation and recurrence of NSCLC tumors is known in the art. See, e.g., M.V. Brock et αℓ., Ν. Engl. J. Med., 2008, 358(11):1118-28. Accordingly, in certain clinical studies provided herein, patients are screened prior to enrollment and/or monitored during the trial for DNA or RNA methylation levels, which indicate a potential response to treatment with an oral formulation comprising a cytidine analog (e.g., 5-azacytidine). In certain clinical studies, patients with high levels of DNA methylation (e.g., CpG island methylation) and/or an increased potential for transcriptional silencing of tumor-suppressor genes may be administered a cytidine analog (e.g., 5-azacytidine) known or believed to prevent or reverse hypermethylation (e.g., by reducing the activity of one or more DNA methyltransferase enzymes). In certain clinical studies, patients with high levels of DNA methylation (e.g., CpG island methylation) of certain genes may be administered a cytidine analog (e.g., 5-azacytidine). In certain clinical studies, patients with low levels of DNA methylation (e.g., CpG island methylation) of certain genes may be administered a cytidine analog (e.g., 5-azacytidine). In certain clinical studies, patients with a particular DNA methylation signature (e.g., CpG island methylation) of certain genes may be administered a cytidine analog (e.g., 5-azacytidine). In such studies, patients may also be co-administered one or more additional therapeutic agents known or believed to reduce epigenetic silencing, such as, e.g., compounds that inhibit histone deacetylase enzymes (HDACs), which regulate the acetylation and deacetylation of histone residues that increase or decrease gene expression. See, e.g., J.G. Herman & S.B. Baylin, Ν. Engl. J. Med., 2003, 349:2042-54; Ρ.Α. Jones & S.B. Baylin, Nature Rev. Gen., 2002, 3:415-28. Suitable HDAC inhibitors for co-administration in the clinical studies disclosed herein are known in the art and/or described herein (e.g., entinostat or vorinostat). [00374] The amount of cytidine analog (e.g., 5-azacytidine) in the oral formulations administered during the clinical studies depends, e.g., on the individual characteristics of the patient, including, inter alia, the stage and progression of the patient’s NSCLC, the patient’s age and weight, the patient’s prior treatment regimens, and other variables, as known in the art. In certain clinical studies, potential starting doses may be, e.g., about 50 mg, about 60 mg, about 70 mg, about 75 mg, about 80 mg, about 90 mg, about 100 mg, about 120 mg, about 140 mg, about 150 mg, about 160 mg, about 180 mg, about 200 mg, about 220 mg, about 240 mg, about 250 mg, about 300 mg, about 350 mg, about 360 mg, about 400 mg, about 420 mg, about 450 mg, about 480 mg, about 500 mg, about 540 mg, about 600 mg, about 660 mg, about 720 mg, about 780 mg, about 840 mg, about 900 mg, about 960 mg, about 1020 mg, or greater than about 1020 mg of the cytidine analog (e.g., 5-azacytidine) daily for a specified time period, e.g., about 1 week, about 1.5 weeks, about 2 weeks, about 2.5 weeks, about 3 weeks, about 3.5 weeks, about 1 month, about 1.5 months, about 2 months, or a longer time period. Other potential starting doses and time periods are disclosed herein. Cycles may be repeated as desired, e.g., over a period of one or more months, as disclosed herein. After a certain number of cycles, the dosage may be increased to increase the beneficial effect, provided such an increase does not cause undesirable toxicity effects. Patients may be treated for a minimum number of cycles, as disclosed herein. Complete or partial response may require additional treatment cycles. Treatment may be continued as long as the patient continues to benefit. D. Example 4 [00375] Clinical studies are conducted to assess the ability of an oral formulation comprising a cytidine analog, such as 5-azacytidine, to treat patients having an ovarian cancer (including, e.g., the ability to stop or reverse the growth of cancer cells in patients having an ovarian cancer). Particular ovarian cancers include, but are not limited to, ovarian epithelial cancer, ovarian germ cell tumors, and ovarian low malignant potential tumors. In certain clinical studies, patients are screened for the presence of a particular type of ovarian cancer prior to administration of the oral formulation. In certain clinical studies, patients with a type of ovarian cancer known or believed to benefit preferentially from cytidine analog (e.g., 5-azacytidine) administration may be enrolled. In certain clinical studies, patients having ovarian cancer are enrolled without screening for particular ovarian cancer types. In certain clinical studies, patients having any type of ovarian cancer are candidates for treatment with an oral formulation provided herein. In certain clinical studies, patients may be currently undergoing additional treatment for ovarian cancer, including, e.g., surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy. [00376] In certain clinical studies, patients who are administered an oral formulation comprising a cytidine analog (e.g., 5-azacytidine) may also be administered one or more additional therapeutic agents, examples of which are disclosed herein (e.g., carboplatin). The additional therapeutic agent(s) may be administered in the same oral formulation as the cytidine analog, or may be co-administered (e.g., via ΡΟ, SC or IV administration) in combination with an oral formulation comprising a cytidine analog. The appropriate amount and dosing schedule for an additional therapeutic agent may be determined for a particular patient using methods known in the art. [00377] In particular embodiments, the co-administered agent is carboplatin. In particular embodiments, the co-administered agent is paclitaxel (e.g., Abraxane®). [00378] An association between gene methylation and ovarian cancer is known in the art. See, e.g., G. Gifford et αℓ., Clin. Cancer Res., 2004, 10:4420-26. Accordingly, in certain clinical studies provided herein, patients are screened prior to enrollment and/or monitored during the trial for DNA or RNA methylation levels, which indicate a potential response to treatment with an oral formulation comprising a cytidine analog (e.g., 5-azacytidine). In certain clinical studies, patients with high levels of DNA methylation (e.g., CpG island methylation) and/or an increased potential for transcriptional silencing of tumor-suppressor genes may be administered a cytidine analog (e.g., 5-azacytidine) known or believed to prevent or reverse hypermethylation (e.g., by reducing the activity of one or more DNA methyltransferase enzymes).

Suitable HDAC inhibitors for co-administration in the clinical studies disclosed herein are known in the art and/or described herein (e.g., entinostat or vorinostat). [00379] The amount of cytidine analog (e.g., 5-azacytidine) in the oral formulations administered during the clinical studies depends, e.g., on the individual characteristics of the patient, including, inter alia, the type, stage, and progression of the patient’s ovarian cancer, the patient’s age and weight, the patient’s prior treatment regimens, and other variables, as known in the art. η certain clinical studies, potential starting doses may be, e.g., about 50 mg, about 60 mg, about 70 mg, about 75 mg, about 80 mg, about 90 mg, about 100 mg, about 120 mg, about 140 mg, about 150 mg, about 160 mg, about 180 mg, about 200 mg, about 220 mg, about 240 mg, about 250 mg, about 300 mg, about 350 mg, about 360 mg, about 400 mg, about 420 mg, about 450 mg, about 480 mg, about 500 mg, about 540 mg, about 600 mg, about 660 mg, about 720 mg, about 780 mg, about 840 mg, about 900 mg, about 960 mg, about 1020 mg, or greater than about 1020 mg of the cytidine analog (e.g., 5-azacytidine) daily for a specified time period, e.g., about 1 week, about 1.5 weeks, about 2 weeks, about 2.5 weeks, about 3 weeks, about 3.5 weeks, about 1 month, about 1.5 months, about 2 months, or a longer time period.

In certain clinical studies, patients are screened prior to enrollment for a particular stage of pancreatic cancer (e.g., the size of the tumor in the pancreas, whether the cancer has spread, and if so, to what parts of the body) prior to administration of the oral formulation. In certain clinical studies, pancreatic cancer patients believed to benefit preferentially from cytidine analog (e.g., 5-azacytidine) administration may be enrolled. In certain clinical studies, patients having pancreatic cancer are enrolled without screening for particular pancreatic cancer types.

Histologic types of colon cancers are known in the art and include, e.g., adenocarcinoma; mucinous (colloid) adenocarcinoma; signet ring adenocarcinoma; scirrhous tumors; and neuroendocrine tumors. The World Health Organization classification of tumors of the colon and rectum include (1) Epithelial Tumors, which include: Adenoma (e.g., tubular, villous, tubulovillous, and serrated); Intraepithelial neoplasia (dysplasia) associated with chronic inflammatory diseases (e.g., low-grade glandular intraepithelial neoplasia and high-grade glandular intraepithelial neoplasia); Carcinoma (e.g., adenocarcinoma, mucinous adenocarcinoma, signet-ring cell carcinoma, small cell carcinoma, adenosquamous carcinoma, medullary carcinoma, and undifferentiated carcinoma); Carcinoid (welldifferentiated neuroendocrine neoplasm) (e.g., enterochromaffin (EC)-cell, serotoninproducing neoplasm, L-cell, glucagon-like peptide and pancreatic polypeptide/peptide ΥΥ (PYY)-producing tumor, and others); and Mixed carcinoma-adenocarcinoma; and (2) Nonepithelial Tumors, which include: Lipoma; Leiomyoma; Gastrointestinal stromal tumor; Leiomyosarcoma; Angiosarcoma; Kaposi sarcoma; Melanoma; and others; as well as Malignant lymphomas (e.g., marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue type, mantle cell lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, Burkitt lymphoma, and Burkitt-like/atypical Burkitt lymphoma. In certain clinical studies, patients are screened prior to enrollment for a particular stage of colorectal cancer (e.g., the size of the tumor in the colon or rectum, whether the cancer has spread, and if so, to what parts of the body) prior to administration of the oral formulation. In certain clinical studies, colorectal cancer patients believed to benefit preferentially from cytidine analog (e.g., 5-azacytidine) administration may be enrolled. In certain clinical studies, patients having a colorectal cancer are enrolled without screening for particular colorectal cancer types. In certain clinical studies, patients having any type of colorectal cancer are candidates for treatment with an oral formulation provided herein. In certain clinical studies, patients may be currently undergoing additional treatment for colorectal cancer, including, e.g., surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy. [00386] In certain clinical studies, patients who are administered an oral formulation comprising a cytidine analog (e.g., 5-azacytidine) may also be administered one or more additional therapeutic agents, examples of which are disclosed herein. The additional therapeutic agent(s) may be administered in the same oral formulation as the cytidine analog, or may be co-administered (e.g., via ΡΟ, SC or IV administration) in combination with an oral formulation comprising a cytidine analog. The appropriate amount and dosing schedule for an additional therapeutic agent may be determined for a particular patient using methods known in the art. [00387] In particular embodiments, the co-administered agent is carboplatin. In particular embodiments, the co-administered agent is paclitaxel (e.g., Abraxane®). [00388] An association between gene methylation and colorectal cancer is known in the art. See, e.g., Α.Μ. Jubb et al.,J. Pathol., 2001, 195:111-134. Accordingly, in certain clinical studies provided herein, patients are screened prior to enrollment and/or monitored during the trial for DNA or RNA methylation levels, which indicate a potential response to treatment with an oral formulation comprising a cytidine analog (e.g., 5-azacytidine). In certain clinical studies, patients with high levels of DNA methylation (e.g., CpG island methylation) and/or an increased potential for transcriptional silencing of tumor-suppressor genes may be administered a cytidine analog (e.g., 5-azacytidine) known or believed to prevent or reverse hypermethylation (e.g., by reducing the activity of one or more DNA methyltransferase enzymes). In certain clinical studies, patients with high levels of DNA methylation (e.g., CpG island methylation) of certain genes may be administered a cytidine analog (e.g., 5-azacytidine). In certain clinical studies, patients with low levels of DNA methylation (e.g., CpG island methylation) of certain genes may be administered a cytidine analog (e.g., 5-azacytidine). In certain clinical studies, patients with a particular DNA methylation signature (e.g., CpG island methylation) of certain genes may be administered a cytidine analog (e.g., 5-azacytidine). In such studies, patients may also be co-administered one or more additional therapeutic agents known or believed to reduce epigenetic silencing, such as, e.g., compounds that inhibit histone deacetylase enzymes (HDACs), which regulate the acetylation and deacetylation of histone residues that increase or decrease gene expression. See, e.g., J.G. Herman & S.B. Baylin, Ν. Engl. J. Med., 2003, 349:2042-54; Ρ.Α. Jones & S.B. Baylin, Nature Rev. Gen., 2002, 3:415-28.

[00389] The amount of cytidine analog (e.g., 5-azacytidine) in the oral formulations administered during the clinical studies depends, e.g., on the individual characteristics of the patient, including, inter alia, the type, stage, and progression of the patient’s colorectal cancer, the patient’s age and weight, the patient’s prior treatment regimens, and other variables, as known in the art. In certain clinical studies, potential starting doses may be, e.g., about 50 mg, about 60 mg, about 70 mg, about 75 mg, about 80 mg, about 90 mg, about 100 mg, about 120 mg, about 140 mg, about 150 mg, about 160 mg, about 180 mg, about 200 mg, about 220 mg, about 240 mg, about 250 mg, about 300 mg, about 350 mg, about 360 mg, about 400 mg, about 420 mg, about 450 mg, about 480 mg, about 500 mg, about 540 mg, about 600 mg, about 660 mg, about 720 mg, about 780 mg, about 840 mg, about 900 mg, about 960 mg, about 1020 mg, or greater than about 1020 mg of the cytidine analog (e.g., 5-azacytidine) daily for a specified time period, e.g., about 1 week, about 1.5 weeks, about 2 weeks, about 2.5 weeks, about 3 weeks, about 3.5 weeks, about 1 month, about 1.5 months, about 2 months, or a longer time period. Other potential starting doses and time periods are disclosed herein. After a certain number of cycles, the dosage may be increased to increase the beneficial effect, provided such an increase does not cause undesirable toxicity effects. Patients may be treated for a minimum number of cycles, as disclosed herein. Complete or partial response may require additional treatment cycles. Treatment may be continued as long as the patient continues to benefit. G.

Example 8 [00395] Clinical studies are conducted to assess the ability of an oral formulation comprising a cytidine analog, such as 5-azacytidine, to treat patients having a breast cancer (including, e.g., the ability to stop or reverse the growth of cancer cells in patients having a breast cancer).

Example 9 [00399] The effects of ΑΖΑ dose and schedule (short-term vs. extended) on pharmacodynamic markers such as DNMT1 depletion, DNA methylation, and DNA damage were evaluated in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. For in vitro experiments, MDA-MB-231 cells were treated daily with 0.1 or 0.3 μΜ ΑΖΑ for up to 12 days, and harvested at various times during treatment, as well as up to 12 days following treatment. For in vivo studies, MDA-MB-231 tumor-bearing mice were dosed (ip) with 1 or 3 mg/kg ΑΖΑ daily for 3, 7, 14, 21, or 28 days and tumors were harvested during and at several time points after the dosing period. DNA and cell lysates were prepared (from cell pellets or xenograft tumors) for DNA methylation analysis (LINE-1 or EpiTech Methyl qPCR assay) and ϋΝΜΤ1/γΗ2ΑΧ western blotting, respectively. [00400] In both in vitro and in vivo studies, ΑΖΑ caused a rapid (by 8 hours post in vivo dose), dose-dependent depletion of DNMT1 protein; when ΑΖΑ treatment was halted, DNMT1 protein levels returned to basal levels within 3-4 days. Consistent with these results, ΑΖΑ in vitro and in vivo caused a dose-dependent decrease in DNA methylation (LINE-1 and gene-specific) and further reduction in DNA methylation with additional days of ΑΖΑ dosing. In vitro, DNA methylation returned to basal levels upon ΑΖΑ removal (within 8 days); the kinetics of DNA re-methylation was slower in more hypomethylated DNA. Lastly, DNA damage was not observed in tumors from mice until 14 or 21 days of dosing with 3 mg/kg or 1 mg/kg ΑΖΑ, respectively. [00401] Thus, extended ΑΖΑ dosing maintained low DNMT1 levels and DNA methylation, and induced DNA damage. These results provide a strong rationale for extended ΑΖΑ dosing for the treatment of cancer patients. J. Example 10 [00402] In patients treated with 5-azacytidine alone or in combination with an additional therapeutic agent such as CDBCA or ΑΒΧ, the pharmacodynamic effects are determined using one or more methods provided in the table below. In addition, the methods below can be used as predictive biomarkers to predict clinical response to treatments. 1 PD: Change at Day 15 from baseline. Tissue Analyte Assay PD1 Pred.2 Whole Blood (PBMCs) Genomic DNA Infinium® Methylation27 Array V Plasma Free DNA Infinium® Methylation450 Array V V Tumor (Fresh Frozen) Genomic DNA Infinium® Methylation450 Array V V RNA Candidate gene expression analysis V V Tumor (FFPE) Protein (IHC) DNMT1, DNMT3A, ρΗ2ΑΧ, cPARP V V Candidate short half-life proteins V V 2 Predictive Biomarker: Baseline in relation to clinical response. [00403] In one embodiment, PBMC DNA was used for assessing changes in DNA methylation, using assays such as LINE-1 methylation, %5mdC mass spec, Infinium® Methylation27 Array, and Infinium® Methylation450 Array. In one study, DNA methylation (LINE-1) in PBMC DNAs from patients in clinical studies described in Example 1, dosed with 200 mg oral ΑΖΑ alone or in combination with CDBCA or ΑΒΧ, was measured on Days 1, 8, and 15 of 21-day cycle. Decreases in LINE-1 methylation were observed for two patients in Arm C. In one study, %5mdC in PBMC DNAs from patients in clinical studies described in Example 1, dosed with 200 mg oral ΑΖΑ alone or in combination with CDBCA or ΑΒΧ, was measured on Days 1, 8, and 15 of 21-day cycle. In one study, methylation levels were measured on Days 1,8, and 15 of 21-day cycle using Infinium® Methylation27 Array (patients dosed with 200 mg oral ΑΖΑ alone or in combination with CDBCA or ΑΒΧ) and density profiles of average methylation levels were analyzed. Upon treatment, decreases in hypermethylated loci (beta >0.7) were observed in PBMCs of Arm C patients; no change in DNA methylation was observed in PBMCs of Arm A patients, and minor decrease in DNA methylation was observed in PBMCs of Arm Β patients. In another study, methylation levels were measured using Infinium® Methylation450 Array (patients dosed with 300 mg oral ΑΖΑ alone or in combination with CDBCA or ΑΒΧ) and density profiles of average methylation levels were analyzed, as well as % change of hypermethylated loci (beta >0.7) upon treatment. The data suggested that the decreases in DNA methylation correlated with the ΡΚ exposure of ΑΖΑ in the patients. [00404] In summary, DNA hypomethylation in PBMCs was observed in patients dosed with 200 mg oral ΑΖΑ alone or in combination with an additional therapeutic agent (5/6 Arm C patients; 2/6 Arm Β patients; and 0/6 Arm A patients). DNA hypomethylation in PBMCs was observed in patients dosed with 300 mg oral ΑΖΑ alone or in combination with an additional therapeutic agent (3/3 Arm C patients; and 2/4 Arm A patients). Decreases in DNA methylation appeared to correlate with ΡΚ exposure of ΑΖΑ in the patients, for example, were observed in patients with AUQnf > 350 ng*hr/mL. Κ. Example 11 [00405] Figure 6 shows in vitro modeling of the dosing schema of the clinical study described in Example 1. DNA hypomethylation (e.g., LINE-1, pi6) was measured 72 hours after ΑΖΑ treatment alone or in combination with CBDCA or ΑΒΧ. pi 6 (mRNA) re-expression was determined 72 hours after ΑΖΑ treatment alone or in combination with CBDCA or ΑΒΧ. Ninety-two cancer cell lines were tested in order to identify specific tumor types that become sensitized to CBDCA or ΑΒΧ after treatment with ΑΖΑ (bladder cancer η=8; head and neck cancer η=8, breast cancer η=21; lung cancer η=35; pancreatic cancer η=7; ovarian cancer η=7; and melanoma η=6). The result from this study can also be used to identify predictive biomarkers for enhanced sensitivity to the combination treatment of CBDCA or ΑΒΧ with ΑΖΑ. [00406] Interaction of ΑΖΑ treatment with ΑΒΧ treatment was evaluated, in the following cancer cell lines: (1) bladder cancer cell lines, including 5637, J82, HT-1376, SCaBER, TCCSUP, and UM-UC-3, which showed additive effects; (2) head and neck cancer cell lines, including Α253, ΒΗΥ, CAL-27, CAL-33, and ΗΝ, which showed additive effects; (3) breast cancer cell lines, including ZR-75-1, CAL-51, MDA-MB-231, ΒΤ-549, Hs578t, HCC1500, HCC-1187, and ZR-75-30, which showed additive effects; (4) pancreatic cancer cell lines, including MiaPaca-2, which showed synergistic effects; (5) NSCLC cell lines, including Η1792, which showed synergistic effects; and Η460, Η1299, Η23, Η1975, Η2122, Η838, Η28, Η1838, CALU-3, Η2030, Η1437, Η596, Η647, and Η1650, which showed additive effects; (6) ovarian cancer cell lines, including OVCAR-3, OVCAR-5, OVCAR-8, SKOV3, and IGR-OV1, which showed additive effects; and (7) melanoma cell lines, including Malme 3Μ and SKMEL5, which showed additive effects. However, antagonism was observed for combination of ΑΖΑ with ΑΒΧ in 1/4 of the cell lines tested, including breast (1/3), NSCLC (1/4), and melanoma (2/3) cell lines. In other experiments, antagonism was also observed in some cell lines with DAC (decitabine) priming. [00407] Interaction of ΑΖΑ treatment with CBDCA treatment was evaluated, in the following cancer cell lines: (1) bladder cancer cell lines, including UM-UC-3, which showed synergistic effects; and 5637, J82, HT-1376, SCaBER, and TCCSUP, which showed additive effects; (2) head and neck cancer cell lines, including Detroit562 and FADU, which showed synergistic effects; and Α253, ΒΗΥ, CAL-27, CAL-33, ΗΝ, and RPMI-2650, which showed additive effects; (3) breast cancer cell lines, including ΒΤ-549, Hs578t, MDA-MB-157, SUM-149, and HCC-38, which showed synergistic effects; and T47D, ZR-75-1, CAL-51, CAL-120, MCF7, HCC1500, AU565, HCC-1187, MDA-MB-436, and ZR-75-30, which showed additive effects; (4) pancreatic cancer cell lines, including BxPC3, MiaPaca-2, and Hs766t, which showed synergistic effects; (5) NSCLC cell lines, including Η460, Η1299, Α549, Η838, ΗΟΡ62, Η1792, Η1838, Η1755, Η2030, Η1437, ΗΟΡ92, and Η2110, which showed synergistic effects; and Η23, Η1975, Η226, Η2122, Η28, Η2228, Η727, SK-LU-1, Η520, Η596, Η647, Η1568, Η1944, and Η1650, which showed additive effects; (6) ovarian cancer cell lines, including OVCAR-3, OVCAR-4, OVCAR-5, OVCAR-8, SKOV3, and IGR-OV1, which showed additive effects; and (7) melanoma cell lines, including SKMEL5, which showed synergistic effects; and Μ14, Malme 3Μ, MeWO, SKMEL2, and SKMEL28, which showed additive effects. Additivity or synergy was observed for combination of ΑΖΑ with CBDCA in the majority of cell lines tested (e.g., about 1/3 NSCLC cell lines showed synergy). In other experiments, additivity or synergy was also observed in some cell lines with DAC (decitabine) priming. [00408] Moreover, for the combination of ΑΖΑ with CBDCA, selected panels of cell lines which showed synergistic or additive effects were further studied in order to identify predictive biomarkers to predict synergy of the combination. The selected cell lines included (1) UM-UC-3 (bladder), FADU (head and neck), MiaPaca-2 (pancreatic), Η838 (NSCLC), Η2110 (NSCLC), and ΗΟΡ62 (NSCLC), which showed synergistic effects, and (2) CAL-120 (breast), AU565 (breast), Detroit562 (head and neck), Η520 (NSCLC), HI838 (NSCLC), Η1568 (NSCLC), and CALU-6 (NSCLC). Basal gene expression and DNA methylation were compared. In addition, AZA-induced changes in gene expression and DNA methylation were compared. The extent of synergy was calculated using AAUC values. Strong synergy was observed in 18 hours to 72 hours or more of ΑΖΑ priming, for example, in ΗΟΡ62, UM-UC-3, and FADU. [00409] Similar results were observed in the kinetics of AZA-induced DNMT1 depletion when comparing synergistic cell lines with additive cell lines (e.g., ΗΟΡ62 vs. Η1568; Η838 vs. Η520, FADU vs. Detroit562), and similar extent of DNMT1 depletion at 48 hours were observed when comparing synergistic cell lines with additive cell lines. Similar effects of DNA hypomethylation (LINE-1) was observed in when comparing synergistic cell lines with additive cell lines upon ΑΖΑ treatment alone or in combination with CBDCA (e.g., in FADU, Detroit562, ΗΟΡ62, and Η520). Dramatic increase in PARP cleavage in the synergistic cell line Η838 was observed upon treatment with combination of ΑΖΑ and CBDCA, suggesting synergistic effect of the combination on PARP cleavage in Η838 cells. [00410] Furthermore, to identify predictive biomarkers for enhanced sensitivity, basal gene expression, promoter methylation, and mutation status are analyzed in selected cancer cell lines. Moreover, gene expression and promoter methylation changes upon ΑΖΑ treatment are analyzed in selected cancer cell lines.
