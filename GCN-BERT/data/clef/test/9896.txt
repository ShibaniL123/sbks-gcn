Example 24: Synthesis of N-hydroxy-4-(4-(4-(3-(3-hydroxypropoxy)prop-1-yn-1-yl)phenyl)-3,6-dihydropyridin-1(2H)-yl)-2-methyl-2-(methylsulfonyl)butanamide
Step 1: Synthesis of methyl 4-(4-(4-(3-(3-hydroxypropoxy)prop-1-yn-1-yl)phenyl)-3,6-dihydropyridin-1(2H)-yl)-2-methyl-2-(methylsulfonyl)butanoate
To a solution of methyl 4-(4-(4-(3-hydroxyprop-1-yn-1-yl)phenyl)-3,6-dihydropyridin-1(2H)-yl)-2-methyl-2-(methylsulfonyl)butanoate (Example 22, Step 1) (280 mg, 1 eq) in DMF (15 ml) was added with NaH (47 mg, 1.7 eq, 60 wt %) and 3-bromopropan-1-ol (125 mg, 1.3 eq). The mixture was stirred for 4 hr at room temperature and extracted with ethyl acetate and water. The organic layer was dried over anhydrous MgSO4 and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was purified with column chromatography to prepare the title compound (130 g, 51%).
