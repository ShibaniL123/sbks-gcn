This invention relates in general to the separa¬ tion and liquefaction of low-boiling gasesj and more parti¬ cularly, to the liquefaction of nitrogen. It is advantageous to operate liquefaction systems for low-boiling gases at relatively low head- pressures, say, of the order of 600 to 1,100 pounds per square inch absolute, since under such conditions an im¬ proved product may be realized while effecting substantial reductions in capital and maintenance expenditures. For example, centrifugal compression and expansion machinery, which is adapted for use in a relatively low pressure range, operates in such a manner that the product is sub¬ stantially free of oil contamination. In addition, less expensive types of heat exchangers can be employed in the lower pressure ranges. However, many liquefaction systems employing head-pressures within the range mentioned have the dis¬ advantage of being thermodynamically inefficient. A possible explanation for this is that in a system employ- ing a relatively high head-pressure, the high pressure stream in the cold-leg heat exchanger cools substantially as a straight-line function of temperature, whereas this is not true in a system employing a relatively low head- pressure. In the latter, the high pressure stream under¬ goes a change in the cooling rate within the low tempera¬ ture range which causes an inflection in the cooling curve, thereby producing a substantial temperature spread with the warming curve of the low temperature returning stream. This discrepancy leads to the consumption of substantial amounts of power, making such a system inefficient. Accordingly, It is a principal object of this invention to improve the effioiency of liquefaction sys¬ tems for low-boiling gasesj and more particularly, to provide a liquefaction cycle for low-boiling gases under substantially reduced head-pressures which Is charac¬ terized by greater thermodynamic efficiency than heretofore achieved In the low-pressure range. An ancillary object of the invention is to provide a cycle for the liquefac¬ tion of low-boiling gases, more particularly nitrogen, which operates at increased efficiency to produce a purer product, coupled with decreased maintenance and capital costs compared to similar prior art cycles. These and other objects are realized in accordance wiith the present Invention In a cycle for the liquefaction of low-boiling gases, more particularly, nitrogen, which contemplates the use of head-pressures within the range 600 to 1,100 pounds per square Inch absolute, wherein a major portion of the pressurized stream Is deployed to cool a minor portion thereof, without any substantial liquefaction occurring during this heat exchange. The salient feature of this arrange¬ ment is the work-expansion of the deployed major portion In two or more steps with one or more reheat steps inter¬ vening. At head-pressures within the range, say, 600 to 1,100 pounds per square inch absolute, an arrangement of the type mentioned performs the function of approxi¬ mating the shape of the low-pressure warming characteristic of the returning streams in the cold-leg heat exchanger to the inflected shape of the cooling characteristic of the high-pressure stream, thereby decreasing the tempera¬ ture spread between the characteristics and increasing the thermodynamic efficiency of the system. For the purposes of Illustration, the Invention Is described with reference to a system for air separation and the liquefaction of oxygen and nitrogen, in which the stream of nitrogen gas from the separator is first com¬ pressed through seven stages, then partially cooled, after which the initial stream Is separated Into two streams. The first stream, about two-thirds by volume. Is work- expanded, then reheated, and again work-expanded. This expanded component combines with returning cold vapor, and then passes back through heat exchangers counter- current to the second stream which consists of the re¬ maining third of the Initial stream. The second stream is cooled in the heat exchangers without liquefaction after which it passes through a throttle-valve for isen- thalpic expansion, whereby a portion is converted to liquid w;hich is separated out from the gaseous phase in a vapor-liquid separator. This liquid is again isen- thalpically expanded to a pressure slightly above at¬ mospheric pressure, at which pressure the liquid fraction is again separated out and stored. The low pressure vapor. Including flash vapor fx'om the surface of the stored liquid, is returned through the heat exchangers in counterourrent with the high pressure streams from which heat is absorbed, to the first compression stage for recycling through the system. Whereas in the particular embodiment disclosed, the nitrogen liquefaction system includes two work-expansion steps separated by a reheat step, It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that improved results might be obtained under certain circumstances by the inclusion of additional work-expansion and reheat steps. By way of further illustrating the present invention, a nitrogen liquefaction system is disclosed in combination with an air separation system, in such a manner that a portion of the liquid nitrogen product serves as a refrigerating reflux for one of the rectifi- cation columns of the air separation system, and also, as a refrigerant for condensing flash vapor rising from the surface of the stored liquid oxygen. Although the present Invention is described herein with reference to a nitrogen liquefaction system, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that the principles disclosed are applicable to the liquefaction of any gas having a boiling point below about -112., in¬ cluding, for example, oxygen, ethane, ethylene, methane, argon, fluorine, carbon monoxide, neon, hydrogen and helium. Other objects, features, and advantages of the system will be apparent from a detailed study of the speci¬ fication hereinafter with reference to the attached draw¬ ings, in which: Figures 1, 2, 5, and h are graphs illustrating the theory of the present invention, showing temperature in degrees Kelvin plotted against enthalpy change for the cooling and heating curves in the cold-leg exchanger of a nitrogen liquefaction system. Figure 1 illustrates the characteristics of a prior art system having a head- pressure of l80 atmospheres? Figure 2 illustrates charac- ' - k - teristlcs of a prior art system utilizing a reduced head- pressure of 45 atmospheres? Figure 5 illustrates charac- . teristlcs of an Improved system in accordance with the present invention at '+5 atmospheres head-pressure employ¬ ing two work-expansion steps; and Figure 4 shows the characteristics of a projected system at 55 atmospheres head-pressure employing three work-expansion steps in accordance with the present invention; Figure 5 shows a nitrogen liquefaction cycle in accordance with the present invention, in a block diagram schematic; and Figures 6 and 7 show an over-all detailed schematic for a combined air separation and oxygen and nitrogen liquefaction system in accordance with the present invention, the two figures adapted to be fitted together in the manner indicated in Figure 8. An objective of this liquefaction cycle is to minimize the power consumption requirements. In order to achieve low power consumption, the temperature difference between the countercurrent streams in the heat exchangers should be kept to a minimum. In Figure 1 of the drawings, which shows tem¬ perature in degrees Kelvin plotted against change in enthalpy, in joules per gram-mol, for the cold exchanger in a nitrogen liquefaction system subject to l80 atmospheres head-pressure, the cooling curve 1 for the high pressure stream and the warming curve 2 for the low pressure return stream are both relatively straight line characteristics of approximately the same slope. Because of this fact, the temperature differenceAT between the cooling and warming streams remains substantially uniform throughout the exchanger, thus making a multi-step work-expansion with intervening reheat of no particular advantage in such a system. Let us refer, now, to Figure 2 of the drawings. This shows a plot of the same parameters for the cold exchanger in a nitrogen liquefaction system subject to a head-pressure of 45 atmospheres. It is apparent that at the lower head-pressure the cooling curve 3 of the high pressure stream is substantially inflected, producing a substantial spread, or temperature difference A,T, with the warming curve 4 at the lower end of the scale. As explained before, this spread in £yr makes the system thermodynamically inefficient, inasmuch as additional power must be consumed to make up this difference. In order to remedy this defect, and to provide a system which is more thermodynamically efficient at the lower head-pressures, the present invention contemplates that the shape of the warming characteristic in the cold- leg heat exchanger should be approximated to the inflected shape of the cooling curve. This is brought about by causing components of the warming stream to undergo a plurality of work-expansion steps with intervening reheating. For example. Figure 3 of the drawings shows curves plotted for a nitrogen liquefaction system similar to that represented in Figure 2, subject to 45 atmospheres head-pressure, but modified to include an auxiliary stream which undergoes two work-expansion steps, in the positions indicated by 7 and 8, and an intervening reheat step in the cold-leg heat exchanger running countercurrent with the cooling stream. In this plot, the cooling curve 5 is in- fleeted, and is similar to cooling curve 3 of Figure 2. The warming curve in this modified system comprises sec¬ tions 6a, 6b, and 6c, whose slopes tend to conform at the different levels to the slope of the cooling curve 5, there¬ by Increasing the thermodynamic efficiency of the system. Figure 4 of the drawings shows a nitrogen lique¬ faction system subject to a still lower head-pressure, atmospheres, in which the same parameters are plotted, as in the foregoing figures. The cooling curve 9 at this low head-pressure sustains an even greater inflection. In order to compensate for this in accordance with the present invention, three work-expansion steps and two reheat sec- tions are included as indicated schematically by the ex¬ panders 11, 12, and 13, and arrows Ik and 15. This pro¬ duces an inflected warming curve 10a, 10b, 10c, lOd, and 10e which approximates the shape of cooling curve 9. It will be understood that this approach can be applied to the use of even a larger number of work-expan¬ sion steps and intervening reheat steps. A nitrogen liquefaction system embodying the principles set forth in the foregoing paragraphs is shown in block diagram in Figure 5 of the drawings. A stream of make-up gas, comprising nitrogen, say, 99.99 pure, at substantially atmospheric pressure and tem¬ perature, is brought into the system through conduit 20, which flows into junction 21. This stream is compressed through a plurality of compression stages 22 to a pressure of, say, H35 pounds per square Inch absolute. The stream then passes out through conduit 23 to a pair of centrifugal compression stages 2 and 26, connected by conduit 25, where it is further compressed to a pressure of 670 pounds per square inch absolute, passing out through conduit 27. The highly compressed stream then passes into channel a_ of warm-leg heat exchanger 28 where it is cooled to about -40oF. It is then withdrawn from an intermediate point in the heat exchanger through conduit 29, and passed through a refrigerator 31, where It is cooled, say, to -1010P., before passing back into column £' of heat ex¬ changer 28 through conduit 32. The high pressure primary stream, cooled to about -130°?., passes out of heat exchanger 28 to junction 33, where it is separated into two streams. The first, or major stream, comprising about two-thirds by volume, passes through conduit 34 to a work-expansion stage 35, where it is. expanded to a pressure of about. 150 pounds per square inch absolute, at a temperature of -236. The cooled, expanded major stream then passes out through conduit 36 and into channel d of cold-leg heat exchanger §7, where it is reheated to, say, -213°?. It then' passes out through conduit 38 to a second work-expansion stage 39, where it is expanded to a pressure of, say, 35 pounds per square inch absolute, and a temperature of -289*?- This cooled, expanded medium-low pressure stream then flows into junction 42, where, joined by a low pressure stream from conduit 59, it flows through conduit 43 into channel b of heat exchanger 37, and through con¬ duit 44 into channel b of heat exchanger 28, where it absorbs heat from counterflowing high pressure cooling streams. It then leaves heat exchanger 28 at a tempera¬ ture of about 85°?., and is returned through conduit to the second stage of compressor 22 for recompression and recycling in the system. Simultaneously, the remaining third of the high pressure stream flowing Into junction 33 flows out through channel a of heat exchanger 37, where it is cooled to a temperature of, say, -2870P. by counterflowing streams. It flows out of cold exchanger 37 through conduit '17, and Into the throttle valve 48 where it Is iaenthalplcally expanded to a pressure of, say, 40 pounds per square inch absolute, and acoled to a temperature of, say, 303oF. The stream then passes Into a first separator 51 through conduit 49, where the liquid portion is separated out, and the vapor phase passes out of the top of the vessel through conduit 59 to join the medium-low pressure gas stream flowing into junction 42 for return through the heat exchangers. The liquid 52 frçm the bottom of separator 51 passes out through conduit 53 and through a second isenthal- pic expansion step in throttle valve 54, where it is ex¬ panded to a pressure of, say, 19 pounds per square inch absolute at a temperature of, say, -5l60F. The fluid from this second expansion step flows into a second separa¬ tor 55, in which the liquid 56 Is collected In the bottom, from which the liquid product Is withdrawn through outlet valve 57. The low pressure flash gas from this separa¬ tor passes out through the top of the vessel through con- duit 58, channel £ of cold-leg heat exchanger 37, connect¬ ing conduit 62, channel £ of heat exchanger 28, and con¬ duit 63. The latter joins junction 21 at the Inlet to the system, where the low pressure stream, warmed to about 850P., and at a pressure of 15 pounds per square Inch absolute, joins the Incoming make-up stream for recom¬ pression and recycling through the system. A combined air separation and liquefaction system will now be described in greater detail, which includes a nitrogen liquefaction cycle substantially simi- lar to that described with reference to Figure 5, with several slight modifications whereby a portion of liquid nitrogen stream serves as refrigerating reflux in the low pressure column of the air separation system, and provides refrigeration for condensing flash vapor rising off of the liquid oxygen storage tank. Referring now to Figures 6 and 7 of the drawings, which fit together in the manner indicated by Figure 8, there is shown, in detailed schematic, a combined air separation, oxygen and nitrogen liquefaction system. Illustrative of the principles of the present invention. For the purposes of the present illustration, a separation-liquefaction system will be described which is designed to produce liquid oxygen at the rate of 100 tons per day and liquid nitrogen at the rate of 504 tons per day. Referring to Figure 6 which shows the air separa¬ tion unit, air flowing at the rate of about 8,000 stan¬ dard cubic feet per minute, a temperature of 90oF., and at atmospheric pressure, is introduced through a: conven¬ tional, non-lubricated type ôf fiberglas air filter fl to the suction inlet of a conventional oil-free compressor 72, where- the air is compressed to about 110 pounds per square inch absolute. Compressor 72, in the present example is a three-stage integral-gear centrifugal compressor with full cooling. After compression, the air stream passes through after-cooler 75, where it is water cooled to a temperature of about 95*F., and thence through water separator 74> from which it flows through a refrigerator 76, consisting of a refrigeration circuit 75 which employs one of the fluorocarbon refrigerants. This unit operates to bring the temperature of the stream down to 40oF. The stream then passes through another water separator 77 to junction 78 where the stream passes through a pair of conventional drying chambers 79 and 81, where it is dried to a very low dew point. The dried stream then passes at a pressure of 96 pounds per square inch absolute through conduit 82 to the channel a_ of a heat exchanger 83 where the temperature is reduced to -laS'F. by counterflowing streams of air and nitrogen. In the present example, this heat exchanger is a conventional type, consisting of brazed aluminum cores. Carbon dioxide impurity and any remaining water vapor are removed from the stream as it passes from the junction 84 through the dual-bed absorption chambers 85 and 86, adapted for low temperature removal of carbon diox¬ ide by means of absorbing materials such as the zeolites, known in the art as molecular sieves. The unit is adapted to be reactivated every 16 hours using low-pressure cycle nitrogeglf. . Tttie air stream then passes at a pressure of about 90 pounds per square inch absolute through channel £ of a second heat exchanger 89, where the temperature is reduced to -2780P. At the aforesaid temperature and at a pressure of about 89 pounds per square inch absolute, the stream enters into the bottom of the high pressure rectification column 91, which in the present illustration is a convention¬ al type. The air is separated by distillation in column 91 into a bottom liquid product containing about 3S# oxygen, which in the specification hereinafter will be referred to as "rich liquid". Pure nitrogen gss at the top of column 91 passes out through the outlet pipe 115 and into the reboiler 106, where It is condensed by heat exchange with evaporating liquid oxygen from the bottom of low pressure column 103. About 60# of the pure liquid nitrogen from reboiler 106 pasues back into the top of high pressure column 91 through inlet pipe 115, where It Is used for reflux, while the remainder (3,400 standard cubic feet per minute) passes into coil 116 of the subcooler 95, which in the present example is a wound tube aluminum exchanger having three tube passes and a single shell pass. In subcooler 95 this liquid nitrogen is subcooled by cold low-pressure nitrogen gas passing in the outer shell, to a temperature of -305oP-, at a pressure of 80 pounds per square Inch absolute, before it passes to junction il8, under control of valve 120, and through inlet 119 into the top of low-pressure rectification column 103, where it serves as reflux. The rich liquid flows out of the bottom of the high pressure rectification column 91 through conduit 93 at the rate of 4,680 standard cubic feet per minute, at a temperature of -2780P., and a pressure of 89 pounds per square inch absolute, through coil 9* of subcooler 95, and through the Junction 96 Into the silica gel absorber 97-98, where hydrocarbon impurities, such as acetylene, are re- moved before it passes through valve 101 and through inlet 102, entering as a feed-stream into the low pressure column 103, at a point part-way up in the column. The final separation of oxygen and nitrogen occurs in the low pressure column 103, where all of the air is separated into pure products except for a small control stream. The latter serves to stabilize operation of the column, passing out through outlet pipe 133 at the rate of 321 standard cubic feet per minute, a temperature of -307° P., and a pressure of 20 pounds per square inch ab- solute. This stream ultimately passes through heat ex¬ changer column 89d, connecting pipe 13, and column d of heat exchanger Q~3, to outlet 135> where It is vented to the atmosphere at about 36° P. As previously pointed out, reflux for low pressure column 103 is supplied by condensed liquid nitrogen from high pressure column 91 through valve 120. This is aug¬ mented for refrigeration purposes by a stream of liquid nitrogen flowing from the nitrogen liquefaction unit through conduit 122 under control of valve 123. In the present example,, this stream flows at the rate of 2,066 standard cubic feet per minute, at a temperature of -303° P*and a pressure of 0 pounds per square inch absolute. It will be apparent that valves 120 and 123 will regulate the re¬ spective flows to provide the desired degree of refrigera¬ tion in the reflux stream. Pure liquid oxygen flows out of the bottom of the low pressure column 103, through conduit 104 and into junction 105, where a portion passes through the column b of the reboiler 106 where it is evaporated by heat ex¬ change with condensing liquid nitrogen from the high pressure rectifying column 91> and passes back into low pressure column 103, through inlet 107 at the lower end. Liquid oxygen product from the low pressure column 103, flowing at the rate of 1,676 standard cubic feet per minute, at a temperature of -289° P., and a pres- i- sure of 23 pounds per square inch absolute, is pumped out of junction 105 by means of pump 109 through the coil 110 of subcooler 95, where it is reduced to a temperature of -299° P. at a pressure of 40 pounds per square inch ab¬ solute, and ultimately through conduit 111 to the liquid oxygen storage tank 112, shown in Figure'7. Pure nitrogen from the top of low pressure column - 13 102 passes out through vent 124, at the rate of 8,159 standard cubic feet per minute, a teraperature of -316° P. and pressure of 19 pounds per square inch absolute. It flows through the outer shell of subcooler 95, cooling the liquids passing through the inside coils, and then flows through conduit 126 at a temperature of -283° F. to column b of heat exchanger 89, connecting conduit 127 and column b of heat exchanger 83, where the temperature is raised to 36° P. at 15 pounds per square inch absolute pressure. Prom here it passes through conduit 128 as the make-up stream for the nitrogen liquefaction cycle, to be described presently. Pure oxygen vapor passes through conduit 130 at the lower end of low pressure column 103t at a temperature of -2890F. and a pressure of 23 pounds per square inch ab¬ solute, through column c_ in each of heat exchangers 89 and 83, and is vented into the atmosphere through vent 132. An auxiliary path is provided between the high pressure column 91 and the low pressure column 103, through outlet 136 at the lower end of column 91 so that a portion of the cooled air stream, about 25$ or less, coming into the lower end of column 91 can be withdrawn if desired un¬ der control of valve 137, partially rewarmed in column e of heat exchanger 89, expanded with the production of work in expander 139, and introduced into low pressure column 103 at a point below the middle, through inlet 142 under control of valve 141. This auxiliary path provides means, if de¬ sired, for saving power in the refrigeration system, at the expense of lower oxygen recovery and lower purity of the nitrogen product. Referring now to Figure 7, this shows a schematic diagram In accordance with the present invention of a nitro¬ gen liquefaction circuit to which the make-up stream of gas is furnished through conduit 128. In the present example, the following is a typical analysis of the impurity content of the nitrogen make-up stream: Oxygen 5 p.p.m. Argon 500 p.p.m. Carbon Dioxide < 1 p.p.m. Hydrocarbon (C2H4) < 1 p.p.m. Helium < 10 p.p.m. Neon < 10 p.p.m. Water Vapor < 1 P-P-m. In the example under description, which anti¬ cipates a liquid nitrogen output of 304 tons per day, the stream of nitrogen flows from conduit 128 into the Junction 129 at the rate of 8,159 standard cubic feet per minute, a temperature of 36° P., and a pressure of about 15 pounds per square inch absolute. The valve 149 can be utilized to control the rate of flow of gas from the Junction 129. In the present example, gas flows at the rate 7,998 standard cubic feet per minute from Junction 129 into Junction 150, at a tem¬ perature of 36° P., and a pressure of 15 pounds per square inch absolute. The low pressure nitrogen stream returning through conduit 221 flows into Junction 150 at-the rate of 637 standard cubic feet per minute, a temperature of 85° F-, and a pressure of 15 pounds per square inch absolute. The low pressure stream flows out of Junction 150 to the first compression stage at the rate of 8,535 30 standard cubic feet per minute, at a temperature of 50° P., and pressure of 15 pounds per square inch absolute, which is raised to approximately 32 pounds per square inch ab¬ solute in the first stage. The stream from the first stage is cooled down in after-cooler 152, and flows into junction 201, where it is joined by the medium pressure return stream flowing through conduit 199 at the rate 25,665 standard cubic feet per minute, at a temperature approximating 85" P., and pressure of 32 pounds per square inch absolute. The augmented stream flows out of junction 201 at the rate of 34,200 standard cubic feet per minute through four additional stages of compression, 153, 155> 157, and 159, each followed by a respective after-cooler 15 156, 158, or 160. The stream emerges from the fifth compression stage and its after-cooler into conduit 162 at a pressure of 430 pounds per square inch absolute and a temperature of 95°]*. The compressors 151, 153, 155, 157, and 159 are conventional types which are operated in series from a common 10,000 horsepower motor, and controlled by means of suction-throttling and discharge pressure control. Re- verse rotation is prevented by a check valve installed in the discharge line.' The intercoolers and after-coolers 152, 154, 156, 158, and l60 are conventional types of water coolers. The partially compressed stream passes through conduit 162 to a series-connected pair of centrifugal com¬ pressors, of conventional form, in which the stream is compressed in two steps to 670 pounds per square inch ab¬ solute, at a temperature of 95° P- Each of these com¬ pressors is followed by a-.conventional after-cooler, 164 and 167 respectively. Moreover, the centrifugal com¬ pressors are respectively coupled to a pair of expansion r' T turbines 194 and 188, vg-hlch are mounted on the same ahaftj In such a manner that the compressor wheels serve as a brake for the turbines, absorbing the work of the expanding gas. The fully compressed nitrogen then flows through the conduit 168 into channel a_ of heat exchanger 169 for cooling by the outgoing low pressure and medium pressure nitrogen recycle streams. This heat exchanger is a brazed aluminum type comprising five cores in parallel flow. At the point in column a of exchanger 169 where the high pressure nitrogen stream reaches -40oF., the total stream is withdrawn from the heat exchanger 169 through con¬ duit 170 and passed into a conventional refrigeration unit 175 where it is cooled from -406P. to -lOl'F. In the present example, the refrigeration system 175 comprises two different refrigeration cycles operating in cascade to cool the high pressure nitrogen stream. The first of these refrigeration cycles employs dichlorodi- fluoromethane CClaPa/ known by the trade-name "Fréon 12,rj and the second cycle employs monochlorotrifluoromethane, known by the trade-name "Freon 13". (Both of these are re¬ gistered tràde-nâmes of E. I, duPont de Nemours and Comparer.) The nitrogen stream emerging at -40oF. from column a_ of heat exchanger 169 flows thrdugH conduit 170 under a pres¬ sure of 669 pounds per square inch absolute, at the rate of 34,200 standard cubic feet per minute into the refrigera¬ tion unit 175. After the cooled nitrogen stream has returned from refrigeration unit 175 to channel «•_ of heiat exchanger 169 at a temperature of -1010F., it is further cooled by the counter-flowing fluids in channels b and a thereof to -130oF. at which temperature and a pressure of 663 pounds per square Inch absolute it leaves the heat exchanger 169 and flows into junction 186. At this point approximately 70% of the high pressure nitrogen stream (24,200 standard cubic feet per minute) is drawn off into conduit 187- This major portion passes into turboexpander 188,, where it is expanded with the production of work to a pressure of 14? pounds per square inch absolute, and is thereby cooled to a tempera¬ ture of -2560F. As pointed out previously turboexpander 188, and its companion, turboexpander 19h, used in the next stage, are of the radial inflow type. These turboexpanders are mounted on the same shaft with and drive the respective centrifugal expanders 166 and 163; they are lubricated by a common system. Variable inlet nozzles control the flow through the turboexpanders which regulates the power avail¬ able to compress the cycled nitrogen. The stream, expanded to- IkJ pounds per square inch absolute, passes out of turboexpander 188 through con¬ duit 189 and is reheated in channel d of heat exchanger 192 to a temperature of -2150F. The stream is then again ex- panded with the performance of work through a second stage comprising the turboexpander 19 from a pressure of 15 to a pressure of 55 pounds per square inch absolute and is cooled to a temperature of -289°?. The medium-low pres¬ sure stream passes out of turboexpander 194 through conduit 195 and into Junction 196, where it re-enters channel b of heat exchanger 192 through conduit 197, in combination with the return medium-low pressure flow through conduit 210. The combined streams pass through conduit 197 into channel b of heat exchanger 192, and through conduit 198 into channel b of heat exchanger 169, where they are heated up to a temperature of 85aP. Plowing at the rate of 25,665 - 18 standard cubic feet per minute, the stream then passes through conduit 199 and into the suction end of the second compression stage, through junction 201, at a pressure of 32 pounds per square inch absolute for recycling in the liquefaction system. The approximately 30$ of the high pressure stream remaining at junction 186., where the major portion was di¬ verted through the turboexpanders, passes through channel a of heat exchanger 192, where it is cooled to a saturated 10' fluid of a single phase at about -2690F. This product stream, flowing at the rate of approximately 10,000 stan¬ dard cubic feet per minute in conduit 203, and at a pres¬ sure of 660 pounds per square inch absolute, is throttled (isenthalpically expanded) to 19 pounds per square inch absolute in two steps. The stream is first expanded through Joule-Thompson expansion valve 20, which is a con¬ ventional cryogenic throttle-valve, to approximately pounds per square inch absolute, at a temperature -3030F. This fluid passes into vessel 206 atop the liquid oxygen storage tank 112. Vessel 206, which is a conventional type of liquid separator, serves as a liquid-vapor' separator as well as a condenser for flash oxygen vapor from the tank, which flows back into the oxygen tank through receptacle 206a. The nitrogen flash gas passing out of the top of separator 206, moves through conduit 210 to junction 196, flowing at the rate of 1,465 standard cubic feet per minute, at a temperature of -303oF., and a pressure of 36 pounds per square inch absolute. The combined low pressure stream then passes through channel b of each of the exchangers 192 and 169, joining the suction portion of the second com- pression stage at 85°?. as previously described. The liquid fraction of nitrogen passes out of separated 206 through conduit 207, and into junction 121, flowing at the rate of 8,555 standard cubic feet per minute, at a temperature of -3030P-, and pressure of 40 pounds per square inch absolute. Part of the liquid nitrogen serves as refrigerating reflux for the low pressure column 103 of the air separation system, passing through conduit 122 at the rate 2,066 standard cubic feet per minute. The remainder (flowing at the rate of 6,469 standard cubic feet per min¬ ute) passes through conduit 208 to a second Joule-Thompson expansion valve 209, where it is again throttled (isenthal- pically expanded) to a pressure of 19 pounds per square inch absolute, and a temperature of -3l60P. It flows into a second separator 211 at the rate of 6,469 standard cubic feet per minute, where the liquid nitrogen separates out and is expanded into the storage tank 214 at a pressure of pounds per square inch absolute through valve 213.
