NANOPARTICULATE FORMULATION COMPRISING A TRPA1 ANTAGONIST PRIORITY DOCUMENT This patent application claims priority to Indian Provisional Patent Application number 2090/MUM/2013 filed on June 20, 2013, the contents of which are incorporated by reference herein. TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a nanoparticulate formulation comprising a transient receptor potential ankyrin-1 receptor (“TRPA1”) antagonist. Particularly, the present invention relates to a nanoparticulate formulation comprising a thienopyrimidinedione derivative as a TRPA1 antagonist and a surface stabilizer; a process for preparing such formulation; and; its use in treating a respiratory disorder or pain in a subject. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Respiratory disorders related to airway inflammation include a number of severe lung diseases including asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (“COPD”). The airways of asthmatic patients are infiltrated by inflammatory leukocytes, of which the eosinophil is believed to be the most prominent component. Inflammatory sensitization of airway neurons is believed to increase nasal and cough sensitivity, heighten the sense of irritation, and promote fluid secretion, airway narrowing, and bronchoconstriction. Various classes of drugs are currently being used for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of respiratory disorders like asthma and COPD. Some of the classes of such drugs are leukotriene receptor antagonists, Pi-adrenergic agonists, anticholinergics and corticosteroids. The TRPA1 receptor activation in the airways by noxious stimuli, including cold temperatures (generally, less than about 17°C), pungent natural compounds (e.g., mustard, cinnamon and garlic), tobacco smoke, tear gas and environmental irritants, is supposed to be one of the mechanisms for neurogenic inflammation in the airways. Neurogenic inflammation is an important component of chronic airway diseases like COPD and asthma. Thus, TRPA1 antagonists are believed to play a role in the treatment of chronic airway diseases like COPD and asthma. TRPA1 receptors are also found at the ends of sensory nerves and their activation results in painful sensations. Thus, TRPA1 antagonists are also believed to play a role in the treatment of pain.

There is a need for new, improved formulations of TRPA1 antagonists and methods of making and using such formulations.

Briefly, the powder mass is mounted on the slide, which is heated at controlled rate (e.g., 10°C/min). The particles remaining at higher temperature are confirmed by DSC and variable-temperature powder X-ray diffraction to be crystalline drug particles. Alternatively, the particle size of the nanoparticulate formulation in a tablet can also be determined by dispersing tablet in a suitable solvent in which the excipients are highly soluble as against the nanoparticulate formulation such that the nanoparticulate formulation remains in dispersed form. Further, the particle size of the dispersion can be determined by the methods as described above. In another method, particle size of Compound I potassium salt nanodispersion in the pharmaceutical composition can be determined using PXRD peak broadening technique , followed by applying the Scherrer equation Τ = Κλ/ βτ cos θ where τ is the mean particle dimension, Κ is a constant of 0.9, λ is the Xray wavelength, βτ is the peak broadening value due to crystal size reduction i.e., the full-width-at-half-maximal (FWHM) difference in radian at a certain Bragg angle (θ), between a nanoparticulate dispersion and the micronsized excipients. (Ref: Dantuluri A. et. al., Sciforum e-conference ECPS 2011 Communication.) Further, different imaging techniques or methodologies can be used to expose the particulate formulation contained in pharmaceutical compositions (e.g., tablet), wherein is-situ particle size measurements can be done. Several methods exist which are able to determine the particle sizes in a matrix, like Raman spectroscopy, Transmission Electron Microscopy (ΤΕΜ), Time of Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectroscopy (TOF-SIMS), FTIR and NIR microscopy and micro-thermal analysis (μΤΑ).
