i0 £Z0 044 BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to biofeedback devices. More specifically, this invention relates to manua!ly held biofeedback devices which control stress. There are many biofeedback devices known in the prior art. Those who are familiar with biofeedback training, know that its main aim is to develop greater control over certain involuntary functions, particularly the ability to relax. The prior art biofeedback devices serve the function of "feeding back" to an individual, information about their physiological responses that he is not usually aware of. This includes their alpha-brain waves, the galvanic skin response (GSR), their muscle tension, and the temperature of their fingers, which are indications of tension level. Most of these prior art devices are very cumbersome and considerably expensive« with most alpha-brain wave machines costing thousands of dollars. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention is a device and method for monitoring and controlling stress within an individual. The device indicates the degree of stress an individual is undergoing and methods that may be used to control and overcome the stress. The device of the present invention is a card or attachment means which can easily be carried anywhere. On the face of the card is a temperature sensitive strip or liquid crystal which is placed next to or in contact i0 I 0G[ 44 with an extremity of the individual utilizing the card. The temperature sensitive strip responds to the temperature of the extremity by changing its characteristics in a way that may be observed by the individual to indicate the degree of stress within "the body. The temperature of the extremity indicates the stress within the body based on a physiological principle that blood moves away from the extremities and into the inner vital organs when one is in the state of anxiety or tension. Accordingly, the extremities become colder. Since the strip responds to temperature, it will indicate the degree of stress. The temperature sensitive strip or liquid crystal responds to temperatures between86°F and98.6°F and changes colour from black to red to green to blue as the temperature rises. The strip does not start responding to the temperature until an86°F temperature is reached. At this point the colour of the strip should be a reddishbrown. As the individual becomes more relaxed and the temperature rises, the strip will go toward the blue colour. If 'the individual finds that the colour remains in the black or dark red area, the card also contains relaxation means or several techniques for controlling stress. The card suggests or provides instructions respecting at least one of the following techniques: (i) The Dynamic Tension Technique - Clench the fists as tightly as possible, hold them closed for a few seconds, then let go, letting the whole body relax. (2) The Full Deep Breath Technique - Take a full deep breath and hold it for a count of 10. When the breath is let go, let the body go completely loose and limp. (3) The i0 - 0 Countdown Technique - Breathing normally, count backwards from i0 to 0, one number per breath, relaxing more and more as each breath is let out. (4) The Warmth Technique - Imagine basking in the warm sun or soaking in a hot tub, until the warmth is generated in the hands. Utilizing one or more of the above techniques, a person should be able to lower the amount of stress within their body which can be monitored by reutilizing the Card shortly after one of the techniques has been followed to determine the success of the particular technique. Depending on the amount of colour change, the technique may be repeated as a particularly useful one to reduce the stress of that particular individual. The card may also contain a method for controlling bad habits such as over-eating, smoking, drugs, etc. which are caused by tension, by suggesting the individua! reach for the card and try to turn the temperature sensitive strip blue whenever they crave their habit. Accordingly, in one of its broad aspects, the invention resides in a mechanical biofeedback device for monitoring and controlling the stress of a person, comprising: a pocket-sized attachment means; a liquid crystal affixed to the attachment means, wherein when an extremity l0 of the person is in contact with the liquid crysta!, the liquid crystal indicates the degree of stress within the person; and a relaxation means directly affixed on the attachment means for informing the person how to control the stress indicated by the liquid crystal. The advantages of 'the present invention will become clear when the following detailed description is taken into account with the accompanying drawings, in which: BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Figure 1 is an illustration of the front of the biofeedback card of the present invention. Figure 2 is a side view of the device of the present invention taken along lines 2-2 of figure l. Figure 3 is an illustration of a typical back of the biofeedback card illustrated in figure l. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Referring first to figure 1 and 2, the front of the biofeedback card of the present invention is illustrated. An attachment means i0 made of any suitable material such as plastic, cardboard or paper andwhich may be the size of either a credit or a business card so that it can easily be carried within a wallet or a pocket, has a temperature sensitive strip 12 thereon. The temperature sensitive strip 12 is affixed to the card i0 by an epoxy or other suitable adhesive so that it will not detach from the face of the card. In a preferred embodiment of the invention« the temperature sensitive strip 12 is comprised of a liquid crystal. However, any other temperature sensitive means that indicates different degrees of temperature in the appropriate range may be used. The liquid crystal 12 is a single cholesteric liquid crystal compound. When the crystal 12 is exposed to heat, the crystalline solid comprising the crystal will begin to melt. The crystal enters into an intermediate state of matter called the ,mesophase" or "liquid crystal" phase where it exhibits properties of both a liquid and a crystal. While in the mesophase, the crystal scatters white lights into its many colour components, where small droplets interact with the sunlight to produce various colours of the visual spectrum, similar to a rainbow. As with the rainbow, the crystal does not produce its own light, but uses the available light within the room. Therefore, the intensity of the colours produced by the crystal is dependent on the available light. The colour of the liquid crystal compound changes as the temperature increases, going from red to green to blue. If the crystal were heated enough, the crystal would become a true liquid. Upon cooling, the order of the colour is reversed with blue appearing first. Since each liquid crystal can exhibit the liquid crystal phase at a different temperature, the crystal 12 utilized in the present invention is a combination of liquid crystals which exhibits this colour change phenomena between the temperature range of 86°F and 98.6°F. The red colour appears around86°F and i0 1Z06044 then changes to green as the temperature increases. The blue colour is obtained at approximately95°F. In lieu of a liquid crystal, a temperature sensitive device could be utilized which could change its shape, form or size to indicate the different degrees of temperature so long as the changes are observable to the user° The liquid crystal 12 may be placed anywhere on the card so it may be easily placed next to an extremity. In a preferred embodiment, the crystal 12 is affixed to the center of the card. In other preferred embodiments, the liquid crystal 12 is positioned towards one of the corners of the card° It is usually grasped between the thumb and forefinger since they are the most easily accessible extremities although a toe or any other finger may be used. The liquid crystal is square or rectangular shaped for ease of manufacture. However, in lieu of a square shape, the crystal may be any geometric configuration. The front of the card may also contain information 14 indicating that the relaxation level increases as the temperature goes from 86°F to98°F and instructions on how to utilize the card. On the card i0, there is additional information such as how to use the card to control stress and control bad habits. In a preferred embodiment, this information is set forth on the back of the card such as is shown in figure 2. lZ06044 To control stress, the card indicates at least one of four shortcut relaxation techniques which may be utilized by the person holding the card. In particular, the person utilizing the card should aim at trying to turn the liquid crystal 12 to the blue colour. In a preferred embodiment, the back 16 of the card I0 contains the following instructions respecting four (4) relaxation techniques in area 18: Stress Whenever you feel tense or the card registers black, try one (or more) of the following shortcut relaxation techniques until the card turns blue: (1) Clench your fists as tightly as possible. Hold for a few seconds then let go - letting your whole body go loose and limp. (2) Take a full deep breath and hold it for a count of 10. When you let go of your breath, let your body go completely loose and limp. (3) Breathing normally now, start counting backwards slowly from i0 to 0 - one number per breath - going more and more loose as you let out each breath. (4) Imagine yourself basking in the warm sun or soaking in a hot tub - until you can actually feel the warmth come into your hands. Also, instructions respecting a method to control bad habits can be included in the area 22 of the card l0 as follows: Bad Habits Many excesses (over-eating, smoking, drinking, drugs, etc.) are caused by tension and boredom. Next time instead of reaching for your habit, reach for the card. Turn it blue and watch your craving disappear. (At this point for an added effect - picture some of the good things that will come from getting rid of this habit.) After the particular technique selected by the individual is practiced, the liquid crystal 12 on the front of the card is reutilized to measure the success of the particular technique in reducing stress. As an individual tries the various techniques, he will find the particular technique suited for him and then be able to reutilize the technique and the card over and over again whenever he wishes to reduce the stress within his body Thus, the card is a type of reinforcement of relaxation training so that the person will ultimately be able to relax without the card. The card may also be used as a business card by including information about the particular individual distributing the cards such as is shown in area 20 on the card i0. The method of controlling and reducing stress comprises using the biofeedback card of the present invention to determine the degree of stress (if any) a person is under. The card I0 is utilized by holding it such that the liquid crystal 12 is held between the thumb and forefinger. After the crystal 12 is held for a period of approximately seconds, the crystal 12 is observed and the colour is noted. If any colour other than blue is registered on the card, one -- 8 '- lO of the relaxation techniques set forth above is followed. After the technique has been completed, the crysta! 12 is reutilized to determine if the technique has been successfu! i.e., the crystal is blue. If not, the technique may be reexecuted or a new technique may be followed. The method may be repeated as many times as necessary until the desired reduction in stresshas been achieved. While the invention has been disclosed and described with respect to specific preferred embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and detai! may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.
