CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS None FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a method of making a trihalosilane by contacting an organotrihalosilane with hydrogen in the presence of a catalyst comprising a metal selected from (i) Re, (ii) a mixture comprising Re and at least one element selected from Pd, Ru, Mn, Cu, and Rh, (iii) a mixture comprising Ir and at least one element selected from Pd and Rh, (iv) Mn, (v) a mixture comprising Mn and Rh, (vi) Ag, (vii) Mg, and (viii) Rh at from 300 to 800 °C to form a trihalosilane. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION A number of methods of producing trihalosilanes have been disclosed. For example, the reaction of hydrogen chloride with zero-valent silicon has been described. In addition, trichlorosilane has been produced by passing silicon tetrachloride, hydrogen, and hydrogen chloride over zero-valent silicon at 600 °C. Further, trichlorosilane has been produced by passing hydrogen and silicon tetrachloride over silicon particles in a first stage, adding hydrogen chloride to the effluent from the first stage, and then passing the effluent and hydrogen chloride over more silicon particles optionally containing a catalyst (i.e., CuCl) in a second stage. Finally, trichlorosilane has been produced by passing hydrogen, silicon tetrachloride, and hydrogen chloride over zero-valent silicon containing homogeneously distributed copper silicide. While the art describes methods of producing trichlorosilane, the methods have some limitations. For example, many of these processes employ zero-valent silicon. Since zero-valent silicon is typically produced by the highly energy-intensive carbothermic reduction of silicon dioxide, using it directly adds costs to these processes. Therefore, there is a need for more economical methods of producing trihalosilanes that avoid the direct use of zero-valent silicon. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The Abstract is incorporated here by reference. The present invention is directed to a method of making a trihalosilane comprising contacting an organotrihalosilane according to the formula RSiX3 (I), wherein R is C1-C10 hydrocarbyl and each X independently is halo, with hydrogen, wherein the mole ratio of the organotrihalosilane to hydrogen is from 0.009:1 to 1:2300, in the presence of a catalyst comprising a metal selected from (i) Re, (ii) a mixture comprising Re and at least one element selected from Pd, Ru, Mn, Cu, and Rh, (iii) a mixture comprising Ir and at least one element selected from Pd and Rh, (iv) Mn, (v) a mixture comprising Mn and Rh, (vi) Ag, (vii) Mg, and (viii) Rh at from 300 to 800 °C to form a trihalosilane of formula HSiX3, wherein X is as defined above. Since the method of the invention does not directly employ zero-valent silicon to make trihalosilane, the method may be more economical and require less energy than other methods in the art for producing trihalosilane. The trihalosilanes produced according to the method of the present invention may be used to make high purity polysilicon, i.e., high purity polycrystalline silicon, which is used in solar cells or electronic chips, or it can be hydrolyzed in known processes to produce polysiloxanes, which find use in many industries and applications DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The Brief Summary is incorporated here by reference. In some embodiments the method may be a method of making a trihalosilane, the method comprising: contacting an organotrihalosilane according to the formula RSiX3 (I), wherein R is C1-C10 hydrocarbyl and each X independently is halo, with hydrogen, wherein the mole ratio of the organotrihalosilane to hydrogen is from 1:3 to 1:2300, in the presence of a catalyst comprising a metal selected from (i) Re, (ii) a mixture comprising Re and at least one element selected from Pd, Ru, Mn, Cu, and Rh, (iii) a mixture comprising Ir and at least one element selected from Pd and Rh, (iv) Mn, (v) a mixture comprising Mn and Rh, (vi) Ag, and (vii) Mg at from 300 to 800 °C to form a trihalosilane.

The method may be characterizable by a combined selectivity for making the trihalosilane and dihalosilane of at least 50 weight percent (sum of wt% for trihalosilane + wt% dihalosilane) based on total weight of all silanes made by the method in the contacting step.

Each halo, i.e., halogen atom, independently is chloro, bromo, fluoro, or iodo. Each X may be chloro, i.e., chlorine atom. The hydrocarbyl groups represented by R typically have from 1 to 10 carbon atoms, alternatively from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, alternatively from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, alternatively from 1 to 3 carbon atoms, alternatively 1 carbon atom.

In one embodiment, the organotrihalosilane is methyltrichlorosilane. The organotrihalosilane may comprise a mixture of at least two different organotrihalosilanes, e.g., a mixture comprising CH3SiCl3 and CH3SiBr3, or CH3SiCl3 and CH3CH2SiCl3, or CH3SiCl3 and CH3SiCl2Br, or CH3SiCl3 and CH3CH2SiBr3. Methods of making organotrihalosilanes are known in the art. Many of these compounds are available commercially. The catalyst comprises a metal selected from (i) Re, (ii) a mixture comprising Re and at least one element selected from Pd, Ru, Mn, Cu, and Rh, (iii) a mixture comprising Ir and at least one element selected from Pd and Rh, (iv) Mn, (v) a mixture comprising Mn and Rh, (vi) Ag, (vii) Mg, and (viii) Rh. Alternatively, the catalyst comprises a metal selected from (i) Re, (ii) a mixture comprising Re and at least one element selected from Pd, Ru, Mn, Cu, and Rh, (iii) a mixture comprising Ir and at least one element selected from Pd and Rh, (iv) Mn, (v) a mixture comprising Mn and Rh, (vi) Ag, and (vii) Mg. The catalyst metal may be selected from: (i), (iv), (vi), and (vii); alternatively (ii), (iii), and (v); alternatively (i); alternatively (ii); alternatively (iii); alternatively (iv); alternatively (v); alternatively (vi); alternatively (vii). Alternatively, the catalyst metal may be selected from: (ii), (iii), (v), and (viii); alternatively (ii), (iii), and (viii); alternatively (ii), (v), and (viii); alternatively (iii), (v), and (viii); alternatively (ii) and (viii); alternatively (iii) and (viii); alternatively (v) and (viii); alternatively (viii). The mixtures in (ii), (iii), and (v) typically comprise from 0.1 to less than 100% (w/w), alternatively from 50 to less than 100% (w/w), alternatively, from 70 to less than 100% (w/w), alternatively, from 80 to 99.9% (w/w), based on the total weight of the mixture, of Re, Ir, or Mn, respectively, with the balance being at least one of the other elements of the mixture described above in (ii), (iii), and (v). The catalyst may further comprise a support. Examples of supports include oxides of aluminum, titanium, zirconium, and silicon; activated carbon; carbon nanotubes; fullerenes; graphene and other allotropic forms of carbon. In one embodiment, the support is activated carbon. For example, the catalyst may comprise Re on the activated carbon; Re and Pd on the activated carbon; Rh and Re on the activated carbon; Ru and Re on the activated carbon; Mn and Re on the activated carbon; Re and Cu on the activated carbon; Ag on the activated carbon; Mn and Rh on the activated carbon; Mg on the activated carbon; Rh and Ir on the activated carbon; Ir and Pd on the activated carbon; or Rh on the activated carbon. The catalyst may be any one of the immediately foregoing catalysts. Any of the catalysts, e.g., the Rh on activated carbon, may be employed under conditions of reaction temperature and pressure so as to yield HSiX3 (e.g., HSiCl3) in a higher amount (e.g., ≥2x (w/w), alternatively ≥4x (w/w), alternatively ≥10x (w/w),) than an amount of the corresponding RHSiX2 (e.g., CH3HSiCl2). In some embodiments the catalyst yields HSiX3 without yielding RHSiX2. In the immediately foregoing supported multimetal catalysts (ii), (iii), or (v), each of the at least two metals may be on the activated carbon. Further, the multimetal catalyst may have a higher w/w % of the first listed one of the at least two metals compared to the w/w% of the second listed one of the at least two metals. When the catalyst comprises a support, the catalyst typically comprises from 0.1 to less than 100% (w/w), alternatively from 0.1 to 50% (w/w), alternatively from 0.1 to 35% (w/w), of the metal or the mixture of metals, based on the combined weight of the support and the metal or mixture. As used herein, the term "metal" refers to zero-valent metal, a metal compound, or a combination of zero-valent metal and a metal compound. The oxidation number of the metal can vary, for example, from 0 to an oxidation number equal to the metal's group number in the Periodic Table of Elements. In one embodiment, the oxidation number of the metal is 0. The catalyst can have a variety of physical forms including lumps, granules, flakes, and powder. Examples of the unsupported catalyst include Re, Re and Pd, Re and Ru, Re and Mn, Re and Cu, Re and Rh, Ir and Pd, Ir and Rh, Mn, Mn and Rh, Ag, Mg, and Rh, wherein each of the metals, except Mg, has an oxidation number of 0 and Mg has an oxidation number of +2. That is, Mg is Mg(II). Examples of the supported catalyst include the metal(s) of the unsupported catalysts described above on an activated carbon support. The unsupported and supported catalysts can be made by processes known in the art. For example, to make the unsupported catalyst, the zero-valent metals may be mixed to form the catalyst. For example, zero-valent Re and Pd may be mixed to form the unsupported catalyst. Alternatively, metal salts, including halide, acetate, nitrate, and carboxylate salts may be mixed in desired combinations and proportions and then reduced with hydrogen at elevated temperature, typically around 500 °C. One such reduction process is described below for making the supported catalyst. The supported catalyst may be prepared by dissolving a metal salt, such as rhenium chloride, or at least two soluble salts of different metals such as rhenium chloride and palladium chloride, in a solvent, such as water or acid, applying this metal salt solution to a support, and reducing the salt on the surface of the support. For example, ReCl3 can be dissolved in water or hydrochloric acid and mixed with activated carbon. Excess ReCl3 solution can then be removed, and the activated carbon- ReCl3 mixture dried. The ReCl3 can then be reduced on the activated carbon with hydrogen at high temperature, typically about 500 °C, to give the supported rhenium catalyst. The order of addition and reduction and multistep addition of salts and subsequent reduction can also be carried out to prepare the supported catalyst. The supported multimetal catalyst may have each of the at least two metals deposited on the same support, including the same particles of the same support. The at least two metals may be deposited simultaneously or sequentially, with a drying step after each deposition. In addition or alternatively, it is contemplated that the supported multimetal catalysts may be prepared by separately reducing separate metals on separate supports and then mixing the separately supported metals to form the supported multimetal catalyst. A method of making the supported catalyst is also described in detail in the examples section below. Some of these catalysts are also available commercially. The reactor for the method of the invention can be any reactor suitable for the combining of gases and solids. For example, the reactor configuration can be a packed bed, stirred bed, vibrating bed, moving bed, a fluidized bed, or reactor tube. To facilitate reaction, the reactor should have means to control the temperature of the reaction zone. The reactor may be made of any material suitable for use with the method, including carbon or stainless steel. The reactor has a contact portion and non-contact portion in operative contact with each other. The contact portion comes in contact with at least one of the organotrihalosilane and hydrogen, and optionally the catalyst, during the reaction, whereas the non-contact portion (e.g., an exterior portion) does not. The material of the contact and non-contact portions may be the same or different. Unexpectedly, the material of the contact portion of the reactor may affect the aforementioned selectivity of the method. It has been found that higher iron content leads to lower selectivity. To avoid or reduce any such deleterious reactor material effects on such selectivity, the contact portion of the reactor may lack iron, alternatively may have a low iron content. A low iron content herein means a material having less than 20 weight percent (wt%), alternatively < 11 wt%, alternatively ≤ 10 wt%, alternatively ≤ 5 wt%, alternatively ≤ 1 wt%, all based on total weight of the material. For example, the material of the contact portion is other than steel (e.g., carbon steel or stainless steel), as steel has an Fe content of >50 wt% (e.g., stainless steel Fe content is from about 60 to about 70 wt%). Examples of selectivity-preserving reactor materials for the contact portion (and, if desired, for the entire reactor) are quartz glass having low iron content, INCONEL alloy (Special Metals Corporation, Huntington, West Virginia USA), and HASTELLOY alloys (Haynes International, Kokomo, Indiana USA). HASTALLOY alloys are Ni based alloys that comprise Ni and at least some of the following elements: Co (≤ 3 wt%), Cr (≤ 1 to 30 wt%), Mo (5.5 to 28.5 wt%), W (0 to 4 wt%), Fe (see below), Si (≤ 0.08 to 1 wt%), Mn (0 to ≤ 3 wt%), and C (≤ 0.01 wt%), total 100 wt%. The HASTALLOY alloy may be any one of the following alloys: B-2 (Fe ≤ 2 wt%), B-3 (Fe ≤ 1.5 wt%, ≥ 65 wt% Ni; Al ≤ 0.5 wt%, and Ti ≤ 0.2 wt%), C-4 (Fe ≤ 3 wt% and Ti ≤ 0.7 wt%), C-2000 (Fe ≤ 3 wt% and Cu 1.6 wt%), C-22 (Fe 3 wt% and V 0.35 wt%), C-276 (Fe 5 wt% and V 0.35 wt%), N (Fe ≤ 5 wt%, Al 0.5 wt%, Ti 0.5 wt%, and Cu 0.35 wt%), and W (Fe 6 wt% and V 0.6 wt%). INCONEL alloy includes an alloy comprising 72 wt% Ni, 14 to 17 wt% Cr, 6 to 10 wt% Fe, 1 wt% Mn, and 0.5 wt% Cu, and optionally other elements, total is 100 wt%. The contact portion may comprise a lining (e.g., a quartz glass lined stainless steel reactor) inside the non-contact portion. Thus, the contacting may be performed in a reactor having a contact portion in contact with the organosilane and hydrogen, and optionally the catalyst, wherein the contact portion has an iron content of less than 12 weight percent (e.g., less than or equal to 10 wt%, alternatively 0 wt%). The temperature at which the hydrogen and the organotrihalosilane are contacted in the presence of the catalyst is typically from 300 to 800 °C; alternatively from 400 to 700 °C; alternatively from 500 to 700 °C, alternatively from 500 to 600 °C, alternatively 700 to 800 °C. For example, the catalyst may be the Rh on the activated carbon and the contacting may be at from 700 to 800 °C. The pressure at which the hydrogen and the organotrihalosilane are contacted with the catalyst (reaction pressure) can be sub-atmospheric, atmospheric, or super-atmospheric. For example, the pressure is typically from > 0 to 2,900 kilopascals (gauge) (kPag); alternatively from > 0 to 1000 kPag; alternatively from > 0 to 830 kPag; alternatively from > 0 to 500 kPag; alternatively from > 0 to 120 kPag. The pressure may be the super-atmospheric pressure, which may be from > 120 to 2,900 kPag; alternatively from > 120 to 1,100 kPag; alternatively from > 120 to 900 kPag; alternatively from > 120 to 830 kPag. The mole ratio of organotrihalosilane to hydrogen contacted in the presence of the catalyst may be from 0.009:1 to 1:2300. Typically the mole ratio has a lower mole ratio value of at least that of any one of the mole ratios listed later in any one of Tables 20 to 23, e.g., at least 0.010:1, alternatively at least 0.10:1, alternatively at least 2.1:1, alternatively at least 4.2:1, alternatively at least 10:1. The mole ratio of organotrihalosilane to hydrogen contacted in the presence of the catalyst is typically from 1:3 to 1:2300, alternatively from 1:10 to 1:2000, alternatively from 1:20 to 1:1000, alternatively from 1:43 to 1:300. Alternatively, the mole ratio of organotrihalosilane to hydrogen may be from 0.009:1 to < 1:3, alternatively from 10:1 to < 1:3. Alternatively the mole ratio may be a mole ratio of RSiCl3/H2, alternatively a mole ratio of MeSiX3/H2, alternatively MeSiCl3/H2, wherein R and X are as defined previously. The residence time for the hydrogen and organotrihalosilane is sufficient to form the trihalosilane. For example, a sufficient residence time for the hydrogen and organotrihalosilane is typically at least 0.01 seconds (s); alternatively at least 0.1 s; alternatively from 0.1 s to 10 minutes (min); alternatively from 0.1 s to 1 min; alternatively from 1 s to 10 s. As used herein, "residence time" means the time for one reactor volume of reactant gases (i.e., hydrogen and organotrihalosilane) to pass through a reactor charged with catalyst (i.e., contact time). The desired residence time may be achieved by adjusting the flow rate of the hydrogen and organotrihalosilane. The hydrogen and organotrihalosilane are typically fed to (into) the reactor simultaneously; however, other methods of combining, such as by separate pulses, are also envisioned. The hydrogen may be diluted with a diluent gas, and the resulting gas mixture may be fed to the reactor. The diluent gas is an inert gas such as nitrogen, argon, or helium gas. The diluent gas may be used in a quantity such that the mole ratio of hydrogen to diluent gas is from 7:2 to 2:7, alternatively from 5:2 to 2:5. Use of the diluent gas may increase selectivity of the method for making HSiX3 or for HSiX3 and H2SiX2. The organotrihalosilane and hydrogen or hydrogen/diluent gas mixture may be fed to the reactor at same or different flow rates (e.g., measured in sccm). The hydrogen and diluent gas may be fed at same or different flow rates to make the hydrogen/diluent gas mixture (e.g., H2/N2). For example, the ratio of flow rate of the hydrogen and to flow rate of the diluent gas may be adjusted from 7:1 to 1:7, alternatively from 6:1 to 2:5, alternatively from 5:1 to 3:4. When the diluent gas is employed in the method, advantageously the mole ratio of organotrihalosilane to hydrogen (e.g., mole ratio of MeSiCl3/H2) may be higher (i.e., the H2 usage may be lowered) and reaction pressure (e.g., reactor pressure) may be higher than the corresponding mole ratio and reactor pressure in the method embodiments that do not employ the diluent gas. The reaction pressure in the method embodiments that do not employ the diluent gas may be from 100 to 200 psig (690 to 1380 kPag), e.g., 150 psig (1040 kPag). The reaction pressure in the method embodiments employing the diluent gas may be from >200 to 500 psig (> 1380 kPag to 3450 kPag), alternatively from 225 to 450 psig (1550 kPag to 3100 kPag), alternatively from 250 to 400 psig (1730 kPag to 2800 kPag), alternatively from >200 to 300 psig (>1380 kPag to 2100 kPag). The higher mole ratio of organotrihalosilane to hydrogen advantageously reduces H2 usage. The higher reaction pressure advantageously increases conversion or yield of the trihalosilane, or of the trihalosilane and dihalosilane. Thus, the selectivity for making trihalosilane, alternatively trihalosilane and dihalosilane, of embodiments of the method employing the diluent gas and higher reaction pressure may be higher than the selectivity therefor of the embodiments of the method not employing the diluent gas or higher reaction pressure. The catalyst is in a catalytic effective amount. As used herein, a "catalytic effective amount" is a sufficient amount of catalyst to form the trihalosilane, described below, when the hydrogen and organotrihalosilane are contacted in the presence of the catalyst. For example, a catalytic effective amount of catalyst is at least 0.01 mg catalyst/cm3 of reactor volume; alternatively at least 0.5 mg catalyst/cm3 of reactor volume; alternatively from 1 to 10,000 mg catalyst/cm3 of reactor volume. The method of the invention may be conducted as a batch, semi-continuous, continuous, or any other process regime. The method is typically conducted continuously or semi-continuously. As used herein, "continuously" means that a stream of the organotrihalosilane and the hydrogen are constantly fed to the reactor containing the catalyst while the trihalosilane product, unreacted organotrihalosilane and hydrogen, and any byproducts are removed. The method of the invention is typically conducted until the trihalosilane production rate falls below predetermined limits, at which time the catalyst may be replaced or regenerated. For example, the method is typically conducted until the trihalosilane production rate falls below 95%, alternatively below 85%, alternatively from 10 to 85%, of an initial trihalosilane production rate for the same run. The "initial trihalosilane production rate" is a trihalosilane production rate from an earlier time in the same run and may be different than the first trihalosilane production rate from a particular run. The method of the invention may also comprise regenerating the catalyst after the contacting the hydrogen and the organotrihalosilane in the presence of the catalyst, e.g., after the catalyst has been contacted with the organotrihalosilane and hydrogen. The catalyst may be regenerated by contacting the catalyst with a hydrochlorination or chlorination agent, such as, for example, HCl or Cl2, or COCl2. The contacting of the catalyst with the hydrochlorination agent is typically at from 100 to 800 °C, alternatively from 200 to 600 °C, alternatively from 250 to 550 °C, and from atmospheric to superatmospheric pressure (reaction pressure), alternatively from 0 to 2000 kPag, alternatively from 5 to 500 pKag. The regeneration may be conducted in a reactor as described and exemplified above. The regeneration is typically conducted until little or no silicon species are produced from the contacting of the hydrochlorination agent with the catalyst. The method of the invention may also comprise purging prior to the contacting of the hydrogen and organotrihalosilane. As used herein, "purging" means to introduce a gas stream to the reactor containing the catalyst to remove unwanted materials. Unwanted materials are, for example, O2 and H2O. Purging may be accomplished with an inert gas, such as argon, nitrogen, or helium or with a reactive gas, such as silicon tetrachloride, which reacts with moisture thereby removing it, or hydrogen gas. The method of the invention may also comprise activating the catalyst prior to the contacting of the hydrogen and the organotrihalosilane in the presence of the catalyst. Activation of the catalyst is accomplished by treating the catalyst with hydrogen at elevated temperature, typically around 500 °C, for a period of time, typically 1 to 3 hours. The method may further comprise pre-heating and gasifying the organotrihalosilane by known methods prior to contacting with the hydrogen in the presence of the catalyst. Alternatively, the process may further comprise bubbling the hydrogen through the organotrihalosilane to vaporize the organotrihalosilane prior to contacting with the catalyst. The process may further comprise recovering the trihalosilane. The trihalosilane may be recovered by, for example, removing gaseous trihalosilane and any other gases from the reactor followed by isolation of the trihalosilane by distillation. The trihalosilane has the formula HSiX3, wherein X is as defined and exemplified for the organotrihalosilane. Examples of trihalosilanes prepared according to the present process include HSiCl3, HSiBr3, and HSiI3. An additional example is HSiCl2Br. The method of the present invention produces a trihalosilane from hydrogen and an organotrihalosilane. Since the method does not use zero-valent silicon directly, the method may produce trihalosilane using less energy and more economically than methods that do use zero-valent silicon. The process of the present invention produces a trihalosilane that can be used to make high purity polysilicon or that can be hydrolyzed in known processes for producing polysiloxanes. High purity polysilicon finds use in, for example, solar cells and computer chips, and polysiloxanes find use in many industries and applications.

The activated carbon support was mixed in and pulled under vacuum for 20-30 minutes. The excess liquid was decanted, and the catalyst was dried in an oven at 120-150 °C. About 0.5 g of the oven-dried catalyst was loaded into an open-ended glass tube, held in place with quartz wool on both sides. The tube was connected to the flow reactor. The catalyst was contacted in a Lindberg/Blue Minimite 1 inch tube furnace with 30-40 sccm H2 at 500 °C for 2 hours or 5-10 sccm H2 at 450 °C for about 15 hours. The H2 was ultra high purity from Airgas. The flow of hydrogen was controlled with an MKS 1179A mass flow controller. The total time that H2 and RSiCl3 were flowed at temperature over the catalyst are recorded later in Tables for the Examples. Reaction Apparatus. The reaction apparatus for Examples 1 to 17 and 24 consisted of an open-ended quartz glass tube with quartz wool to hold the catalyst in place. The tube had a contact portion and was connected to a flow reactor comprising a Lindberg/Blue Minimite 1" tube furnace and an MKS 1179A mass flow controller to control gas flow. In elevated pressure runs, the glass tube was inserted into a steel tube with an inner diameter just big enough to fit the glass tube. An o-ring was fitted over the glass tube at the inlet to prevent flow of gases around the outside. A back-pressure regulator (0-500 psi) from GO Regulators was attached to the reactor at the outlet of the tube furnace. The contact portion in the reaction apparatus for Examples 18-23 and 25 was made from quartz glass, stainless steel, or INCONEL alloy, as the case may be described later. Reagents. The hydrogen was ultra high purity hydrogen from Airgas (Radnor, PA). The activated carbon and metal salts were purchased from Sigma Aldrich (Milwaukee, WI) Product Analysis. The effluent of the reactor containing the products and byproducts was passed through an actuated 6-way valve (Vici) with constant 100 µL injection loop before being discarded. Samples were taken from the reaction stream by actuating the injection valve and the 100 µL sample passed directly into the injection port of a 6890A Agilent GC for analysis with a split ratio at the injection port of 5:1. The GC contained a single 30 m Rtx-DCA column (Restek, 320 µm inner diameter, 1 µm thick film), which was split at the outlet. One path went to a TCD for quantization of the reaction products and the other path went to a Flame Ionization Detector. Flow Rates. Methyltrichlorosilane flow rate ratios were determined using known thermodynamic principles governing the operation of a bubbler containing a vaporizable liquid and the flow rate of hydrogen at standard temperature and pressure. EXAMPLE 1: Re on carbon. In a flow reactor, about 0.6 g of catalyst, comprising 5.9% (w/w) Re on carbon, were loaded into a glass tube. Activation of the catalyst was performed with 10 sccm H2 at 450 °C for about 15 hours. The temperature of the reactor was decreased to 200 °C and the reaction was started by passing H2 through the MeSiCl3 bubbler. Samples were taken from the reaction stream and injected into a GC for analysis using an online switching valve. The reaction was run while varying the following conditions: reaction temperature, flow rate of hydrogen, and MeSiCl3 bubbler temperature. The catalyst activation and reaction were done without applying back pressure to the system. HSiCl3 was produced at the conditions and yield listed in Table 2 below. Table 2.

EXAMPLE 20: Effect of H2 dilution. This example illustrates the effect of H2 dilution with N2 gas to reduce the MeSiCl3/H2 ratio on the reactivity (conversion or yield) and selectivity of the method. To an INCONEL ALLOY reactor (inner dimensions: 0.375 inch (0.95 cm) (id), 18 inches (46 cm) long) was loaded about 2.0 g of catalyst comprising 1.0% (w/w) Rh and 1.0% (w/w) Re both on carbon. The catalyst was activated with 200 sccm H2 at 500 °C for 2 hours. Then, the temperature of the reactor was increased to 600 °C, and MeSiCl3 was fed into the reactor via a syringe pump at a flow rate of 2.0 mL/h. H2 gas flow in the range 200 sccm to 700 sccm range and N2 gas flow in the range 0 sccm to 500 sccm range were used and the total gas flow was maintained at 700 sccm by diluting the H2 with N2 gas and running the reaction at reaction pressure of 150 psig. Samples were taken from the reaction stream and injected into a GC for analysis using an online switching valve and the results (average of 4 to 6 runs) are shown below in Table 21. Table 21.

EXAMPLE 21: Effect of reaction pressure on H2 dilution reaction. This example illustrates the effect of pressure on H2 dilution reaction. To an INCONEL alloy reactor (inner dimensions: 0.375 inch (0.95 cm) (id), 18 inches (46 cm) long) was loaded about 2.0 g of catalyst comprising 1.0 % (w/w) Rh and 1.0 % (w/w) Re both on carbon. The catalyst was activated with 200 sccm H2 at 500 °C for 2 hours. Then, the temperature of the reactor was increased to 600 °C, and MeSiCl3 was fed into the reactor via a syringe pump at a flow rate of 2.0 mL/h. H2 gas flow in the range 100 sccm to 700 sccm range and N2 gas flow in the range 0 sccm to 600 sccm range were used and the total gas flow was maintained at 700 sccm by diluting the H2 with N2 gas and contacting ingredients at a reaction pressure of 150 psig. The reaction pressure was varied from 150 psig to 400 psig. Samples were taken from the reaction stream and injected into a GC for analysis using an online switching valve and the results (average of 4 to 6 runs) are shown below in Tables 22a and 22b.

In Tables 22a and 22b, the results show that the reduced MeSiCl3 conversion and SiH (HSiCl3 + H2SiCl2) selectivity in the H2 dilution reaction shown in Example 20 can be improved in Example 21 by increasing the reaction pressure (compare entry 1 with entries 2-4 in Table 22). For example, the MeSiCl3 conversion and SiH selectivity at 700 sccm H2 flow (MeSiCl3/H2 ratio = 0.0100) may be achieved at a lower H2 flow (500 sccm) and higher MeSiCl3/H2 ratio (0.0140) by increasing the reaction pressure to about 250 psig under N2 dilution conditions. Similar reaction performance may be achieved at even lower H2 flow and higher MeSiCl3/H2 ratio at higher reaction pressures (>400 psig). EXAMPLE 22: Effect of Reactor Material of Construction. This example illustrates the effect of reactor material of construction (MOC) on the reactivity (conversion or yield) and selectivity of the method. One of three different types of reactors (all having inner dimensions: 0.375 inch (0.95 cm) (id), 18 inches (46 cm) long) were used: reactor MOC (a) an INCONEL alloy reactor; (b) a quartz glass lined reactor; or (c) a stainless steel reactor. In separate experiments, to each reactor was loaded about 2.0 g of catalyst comprising 4.7 % (w/w) Rh and 4.7 % (w/w) Re both on carbon. The catalyst was activated with 200 sccm H2 at 500 °C for 2 hours. Then, the temperature of the reactor was increased to 600 °C, and MeSiCl3 was fed into the reactor via a syringe pump at a flow rate of 2.0mL/h. Samples were taken from the reaction stream and injected into a GC for analysis using an online switching valve. The reaction was continued for 5 to 6 hours. This procedure was repeated using each of the different reactors at different MeSiCl3/H2 mol ratios and the results are shown below in Table 23. Table 23.

Suitable reactor materials contain the low iron content. EXAMPLE 23: Rh on carbon. This example illustrates the effect of 4.7% Rh/C catalyst on the reactivity and selectivity of the reaction. To a stainless steel reactor (inner dimensions: 0.75 inch (1.9 cm) inner diameter (id), 18 inches (46 cm) long) was loaded about 2.0 g of catalyst comprising 4.7 % (w/w) Rh on Carbon. The catalyst was activated with 100 sccm H2 at 500 °C for 2 hours. Then temperature of the reactor was either kept at 500°C or increased to 600 °C, and MeSiCl3 was fed into the reactor via a syringe pump at a flow rate of 2.0 mL/h. The reaction pressure was from 100 to 120 psig. Samples were collected in a dry-ice cooled condenser for 2 hour period and analyzed by a gas chromatograph and the results are shown in Table 24 below.
