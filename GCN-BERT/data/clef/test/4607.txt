CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION This application is a continuation to U.S. provisional application 61/790,748, filed Mar. 15, 2013. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1) Field of the Invention This invention is directed to a steamer mop having an improved cleaning assembly including a cleaning pad that allows for cleaning sections of the cleaning pad to come in contact with the cleaning area. The cleaning sections can be periodically changed so that the unused or clean portion of the cleaning pad contacts the cleaning surface. The cleaning sections can be changed a predetermined number of times before having to remove and/or replace the entire cleaning pad. 2) Description of Related Art Steamer mops that have the capability of using steam to mop a floor are generally known in the art. The primary disadvantage with these mops is that the consumer is required to change the cleaning pads multiple times during use to ensure that a clean pad is being used. One of the reasons that the cleaning pad must be changed so frequently is that the prior art systems do not include any mechanism that is designed to help clean the cleaning pad in use. Further, steamer mops traditionally have the disadvantage of dirt that is located on the cleaning pad is actually rubbed into the floor after a certain amount of use of the cleaning pad. As the cleaning pad is used, the efficiency of the pad diminishes. If used too long, based upon the volume of dirt involved, the cleaning pad can actually deposit more dirt to the floor that it removes. Typically, users do not remove and clean the cleaning pad in a sufficient interval to avoid this effect. Another disadvantage of the prior art is that it does not include any mechanism that may be used to kill bacteria without the need for the use of a cleaning solution. Specifically, the prior art mops do not have any method of killing the bacteria trapped on the cleaning pad while the mop is being used. While it is known that the prior art steaming mops may include a reservoir that allows a cleaning solution to be sprayed in front of the cleaning pad, the prior art fails to include a mechanism to allow the user to choose between two different types of cleaning solutions that may be sprayed in front of the cleaning pad. Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide an improved steamer mop that provides a cleaning pad having a plurality of cleaning sections that can automatically engage the floor at a cleaning area during use without the need for manually changing the cleaning pad. Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide an improved steamer mop that can clean one of said cleaning sections of the cleaning pad after use so that said cleaning section may be reused prior to manually changing the cleaning pad. Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide an improved steamer mop that uses a U-V light source to kill any bacteria that becomes trapped on the cleaning pad without the use of additional cleaning products. Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide an improved steamer mop that allows the user to shine a U-V light source on the floor to gauge the cleanliness of the floor. Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide an improved mop having a reservoir capable of containing two different types of cleaning solutions and allowing the user to select the desired cleaning solution to be sprayed in front of the cleaning pad. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The invention relates generally to an improved mop having a support arm having a handle, a mop head that is pivotally attached to said support arm, a pair of rollers disposed in said mop head, a cleaning pad rotatably carried by said rollers so that a first roller carries said cleaning pad and a second roller draws sections of said cleaning pad across a cleaning area defined by said mop head, a spray nozzle carried by said mop head that is fluidly connected to a cleaning solution container for allowing the user to select and spray a cleaning solution on the surface being cleaned, and a light source disposed on said mop head for disinfecting said cleaning pad.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT With reference to the drawings, the invention will now be described in more detail. FIG. 1 provides a perspective illustration of the improved steamer mop 10. The mop includes a support arm 12 that is pivotally connected to the mop head 14 and includes a handle section 16. The support arm 12 includes a water reservoir 18 that is fluidly connected to a heating element 21 contained in the mop head 14 so that steam may be created by means generally known in the art. The heating elements, and rollers in one embodiment, can be powered through attachment to a power source from a cord or from a battery source on board. In at least one embodiment, the flow of water from the water reservoir to the heating element is controlled by the pump lever 20. In this embodiment, the pump lever 20 can either manually actuate a water pump (not shown) to force the water to flow from the reservoir 18 to the heating element 21 or the pump lever 20 may electrically actuate a water pump (not shown) to force the water to the heating element. In an alternate embodiment, however, the flow of water may be automatically regulated by means of a timer, temperature sensor, moisture sensor or humidity sensor that automatically actuates the water pump once predefined criteria have been sensed by the sensor(s). Once the water reached the heating element, steam is created and directed toward the cleaning pad 24 so as to aid with the cleaning of the floor. In one embodiment, the support handle 12 further includes a cleaning reservoir 22 where one or more types of cleaners can be stored. In the shown embodiment, the cleaning reservoir includes two cleaning sections 22a and 22b that can store and separate two different types of cleaning solutions. In one embodiment, the handle section 16 includes a three way switch 26 that allows the user to select between water, a first cleaning solution and a second cleaning solution so that when pump lever is engaged, the selected fluid is directed towards the mop head. If water is selected, it is directed towards the heating element where it is then heated until steam is created and directed towards the cleaning pad 24. If, however, one of the two cleaning solutions is selected, the solution is directed down the support shaft 12 to one or both of the spray nozzles 28a and 28b so that the cleaning solution can be sprayed in front of the cleaning pad 24. If, however, the water flow is controlled by one or more sensors, the three way switch may be replaced with a two way switch that allows the user to select the appropriate cleaning solution to be dispensed from the cleaning reservoir 22. In one embodiment, the mop is provided with an ultraviolet light source 30 on the front of the mop head 14 so that the user can shine the ultraviolet light source on the surface being cleaned to determine if the surface is sufficiently clean. While the shown embodiment shows a single light source on the front of the mop head 14, multiple light sources could be positioned around the entire periphery of the mop head. Alternately, a single light source could extend around the periphery of the mop head. This ultraviolet light source can be activated by button 31 that is located on handle 16. In one embodiment, the mop head could include cleaning pads 32 on the sides of the mop head 14 so that when the mop head contacts a baseboard or the like, the cleaning pad 32 will collect any dirt that may be on the baseboard. These cleaning pads could be made of any suitable material including cloth or tacky paper or any other material generally known in the art. Referring now to FIGS. 1-2, the cleaning pad changing system can be more clearly seen. Mop head 14 includes two rollers 34a and 34b. These rollers can be electrical or manually rotated. In one embodiment, the first roller or feed roller 34a carries the cleaning pad 24 while the second roller or take up roller 34b draws the cleaning pad 24 across the mop head so that different sections of the cleaning pad can be used during cleaning once the previous section used becomes dirty. Thus, the user is allowed to use several sections of the cleaning pad 24 before the cleaning pad must ultimately be changed and/or cleaned. Cleaning pad 24 can be made of any suitable material generally known in the art, including disposable materials and/or materials that can be washed and reused. In one embodiment, a first cleaning pad is carried by the first roller and rotates to provide for a cleaning section to come in contact with a cleaning area. As the roller rotates, a unused cleaning section is moved into place to contact the cleaning area. The second cleaning pad can be carried by the second roller and rotates to provide for a cleaning section to come in contact with a cleaning area. Again, the second roller rotates, an unused cleaning section is moved into place to contact the cleaning area. In one embodiment, the mop head 14 further includes a pair of brushes 36a and 36b that are disposed generally adjacent to the rollers 34a and 34b. These brushes help remove any excess dirt from the cleaning pad as it is being wrapped around the rollers and as the cleaning section of the cleaning pad is being drawn across the cleaning surface. In one embodiment, the brushes are spring biased so that the brushes remain in contact with the cleaning pad as it is being drawn from one roller to the other. In at least one embodiment, the mop head is provided with a dirt collection tray disposed beneath the brushes. In another embodiment, the mop head is provided with a vacuum that will suck the excess dirt into a dirt storage bin 38 disposed on support arm 12. If the user desires, the user can reuse the cleaning pad 24 once the cleaning pad has been drawn from the first roller 24a to the second roller. Since the brushes remove the excess dirt from the cleaning pad, several sections can be reused by drawing the cleaning pad from the second roller 34b back to the first roller 34a. The rollers can be activated using a button or switch that when activated causes the rollers to draw the cleaning pad across the cleaning surface in the desired direction. In an alternate embodiment, the rollers could be controlled by a timer or appropriate sensor so that the user does not have to activate the rollers. In one embodiment, the mop is provided with one or more UV light sources 40a and 40b disposed in the mop head that direct UV light towards the cleaning pad. This helps disinfect the cleaning pad from any bacteria that may have been collected by the cleaning pad. As shown in FIGS. 2-3, this light source 30 or sources 40a and 40b may be disposed on the sides of the mop head or the top of the mop head so that it shines directly down at the cleaning pad. Once the cleaning pad requires cleaning or replacement, a section of the mop head may be removed so that the mop head may be removed and/or replaced. In one embodiment, the cleaning pad and the rollers are removed together. In alternate embodiments, only the cleaning pad is removed. In one embodiment, the cleaning pad is attached to the rollers by way of Velcro® but any other methods, such as clips, ties, snaps, or buttons can be used. In an alternate embodiment, the cleaning pad is disposed on two cores of suitable material, which may then slide over the rollers. While the shown embodiment is rectangular, the mop head 14 could be any shape that is generally known.
