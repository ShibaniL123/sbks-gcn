BACKGROUND The administration of proteins to animals, including humans, in nutritional supplements or as therapeutics has been known for some time. Proteins for therapeutic or nutritional administration generally are available either as (1) concentrates or powders that are administered directly or are reconstituted in a liquid of choice prior to use; or (2) liquid formulations. The preparation and delivery of therapeutic proteins of interest in powder or particle form is an area of concentrated research and development activity in the pharmaceutical industry. For therapeutic efficacy, it is desirable to have a uniform formulation. For example, for pulmonary administration, the protein ideally is prepared in the form of discrete microspheres, which are solid or semi-solid particles having a diameter of between 0,5 and 5.0 microns, it also Is desirable for the particles to have a protein content that is as high as possible and that maintains its activity for concentrated delivery and therapeutic efficacy. Previous methods of producing protein microparticles or nanoparticles have involved complex steps, such as blending with organic polymers and/or forming a lattice array with polymers; spray drying, spray freeze-drying or supercritical fluid antisolvent techniques that use specialized and complex equipment; or iyophilizatkm followed by pulverization or milling that often results in non-uniform particles that must further be sorted. Often previous methods of producing solid protein formulations involve processing steps, such as heating, that denature the protein and compromise its activity. In addition, some methods do not provide high recovery from solution into the solid formulation. Accordingly, there is a need for a method for producing protein and other macromolecular microparticles that does not require complex or specialized equipment and that produces uniform-sized microparticles for delivery. There further is a need for a method of producing microparticles that contain high concentrations of the protein or macromolecule relative to other components, that are stable and maintain their activity for long periods of time when stored at ambient temperature and that do not contain a significant amount of denatured protein. There also is a need fora method of producing microparticles of proteins and other macromolecules wherein substantially all of the protein or macromolecuie in the starting material is recovered in the microparticle formulation, with minimal loss. There also is a need for microparticles of proteins or other macromolecules containing these properties for administration, for example, as a therapeutic or nutritional supplement. SUMMARY Provided herein are methods for producing protein and other macromolecular microparticles that do not require complex or specialized equipment and that produces uniform-sized microparticles for delivery; methods for producing microparticles that contain high concentrations of protein or macromolecuie relative to other components, that are stable and maintain their activity for long periods of time when stored at ambient temperature and that do not contain a significant amount of denatured protein.

As used herein, the term "counterion" refers to a charged or chargepolarizable molecule that can initiate formation of a microparticle from a macromolecule, such as a protein, nucleic acid, lipid or oligosaccharide. For example, in the case of the DAS181 fusion protein (SEQ ID ΝΟ:17), sodium sulfate is a counterion because it can initiate the formation of microparticles in the methods provided herein, whereas glycine, sodium chloride or sodium acetate generally are not suitable as counterions for DAS181. Whether a charged molecule is a counterion can be determined empirically based on parameters including, but not limited to, the type of protein, the pH, the ionic strength, the type of organic solvent used, and the presence of salts and additional ingredients such as active agents. As provided and described herein, counterions can be anionic or having a net negative charge or chargepolarizable group(s), cationic or having a net positive charge or chargepolarizable group(s), or zwiiterionic and possessing both negative and positive charged or charge-polarizabi© groups. As used herein, the term "cooling" refers to a lowering of temperature to a desired temperature for obtaining microparticles or, once the microparticles are obtained, further lowering the temperature to a desired temperature for obtaining dry preparations of the microparticles by volatilizing solvents (e.g., for freeze-drying).

Thus gradual cooling is different from, for example, snap freezing, spray drying or spray freeze-drying, whereby the entire solution is converted to a solid form without the generation of distinct microparticles. The rate of gradual cooling is empirically determined based on the type of macromolecule, solvents, counterions and other ingredients as well as the method of cooling (e.g., a heat exchanger, refrigerator or freezer or freezedryer) and can vary, for example, for an amount of time for microparticle formation of between about or at 1 min, 2 min, 3 min, 5 min, 7 min, 10 min, 15 min, 20 min, 25 min, 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, 5 h or 10 h to about or at 1.5 min, 2 min, 3 min, 5 min, 7 min, 10 min, 15 min, 20 min, 25 min, 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, 5 h, 10 h or 15 h.

Thus gradual cooling is different from, for example, snap freezing, spray drying or spray freeze-drying, whereby the entire solution is converted to a solid form without the generation of distinct microparticles. The rate of gradual cooling is empirically determined based on the type of macromotecule, solvents, counterions and other ingredients as well as the method of cooling (e.g., a heat exchanger, refrigerator or freezer or freezedryer) and ca η vary, for example, for an amount of time for microparticle formation of between about or at 0.1 sec, 0.2 sec, 0.5 sec, 1 sec, 10 sec, 20 sec, 30 sec, 40 sec, 50 sec, 1 min, 2 min, 3 min, 5 min, 7 min, 10 min, 15 min, 20 min, 25 min, 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, 5 h or 10 h to about or at 1.5 min, 2 min, 3 min, 5 min, 7 min, 10 min, 15 min, 20 min, 25 min, 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, 5 h, 10 h or 15 h.

As used herein, the term “spray drying1’ refers to a process wherein a solution containing a macromolecule, such as a protein, is transformed into a dry particulate form by atomizing into a hot drying medium, generally for a period of about a few milliseconds to 1-2 seconds to a few tens of seconds. The term "spray freeze-drying” as used herein refers to a process wherein a solution containing a macromolecule, such as a protein, is atomized into a cryogenic medium, such as liquid nitrogen, to obtain frozen droplets of solution that can then be dried by lyophilization. The term “snap freezing” or "rapid freezing” or “quick freezing" as used interchangeably herein refers to freezing a solvent or solution, including solutions containing macromolecules, such as proteins, by immersing the container with good heat transfer properties (e.g. thin-wal! glass or metal test tube) holding the solvent or solution in liquid nitrogen or pouring the solution directly into liquid nitrogen. “Snap freezing" and "rapid freezing" generally occur within a period of about a few milliseconds to 1 -2 seconds to a few tens of seconds. The term “iyophiiize" or "lyophilization" as used herein Is synonymous with “freeze drying” and refers to a process wherein a solution, including an emulsion, colloid or suspension, is frozen and the solvents are volatilized directly into the vapor state, leaving behind the solid components. Β. (Utethods for Preparing Macromolecular Microparticle Compositions Provided herein are methods of making microspheres having a high content of a macromotecule, such as a protein. The microspheres provided herein are prepared by controlled precipitation in the presence of a counterion and an organic solvent. The microspheres are suitable for preparing pharmaceutical compositions which can be delivered to a patient by delivery routes including pulmonary, parenteral and oral administration routes. The method also can be performed in a batch or continuous mode, for Increased efficiency and production. The microspheres obtained by the methods provided herein are useful as prophylactic, therapeutic or diagnostic agents for treating or diagnosing disease states in a subject in vivo or in vitro. The sizes of the micraspheres obtained by the methods provided herein can be controlled by adjusting parameters Including type and concentration of organic solvent, protein or macromolecule concentration, ionic strength, counterion type and concentration, rate and time of cooling, to provide microspheres in a wide range of sizes, from 0.001 micron to 50 microns or greater, that can deliver therapeutic agents via a desired route including pulmonary (e.g., 1 micron to 5 micron particles for delivery to the throat, trachea and bronchi for treatment of influenza and other respiratory infections), subcutaneous, Intramuscular, Intravenous and other routes (e.g„ using particles of tens of microns in size), render active components of inhalant medicines for human subjects. The steps of the method provided herein include: combining a solution containing the macromoiecule with a counterion and an organic solvent, and gradually cooling the resulting solution to a temperature whereby microparticles are formed. In one embodiment, the steps can be described as follows: 1) To a solution containing a macromoiecule, such as a protein, nucleic acid, oligosaccharide or lipid, adding a counterion and an organic solvent at concentrations that do not cause precipitation of the macromoiecule at ambient temperature: 2) Precipitation: cooling tile macromolecule/soivent cocktail to initiate formation of microspheres; and 3) Dehydration: freezing of the suspension and removal of organic solvent and water by sublimation (freeze-drying, e.g., at a temperature of about -20 °C to about -80 °C, or about -30 °C to about -80 °C, or about -40 °C to about -80 °C, or about -45 °C to about -80 °C, or about -45 °C to about -75 °C). The above steps of the method can be performed sequentially, intermittently or simultaneously in any order. In one embodiment, the counterton and the organic solvent are added simultaneously or sequentially in any order to the solution containing the macromoiecule, followed by chilling. In other embodiments, the solution containing the macromoiecule can be prechilled to a temperature suitable for microsphere formation, prior to adding the counterion and organic solvent. For example, a prechilled aqueous solution of a macromoiecule, such as a protein, can be combined with ammonium sulfate and acetonitrile to form microspheres. The resulting suspension of microparticles can be converted into a dry powder by further cooling to a temperature below freezing point and subsequent removal of volatiles (water, organic solvent and where possible the counterion) by, for example, sublimation using a standard freeze dryer. In one embodiment, the microspheres formed by contacting the macromolecule with a counterion and organic solvent and exposed to [ow temperature, are separated from the suspension by methods including sedimentation or filtration techniques. After separation from the original precipitation mix, the microspheres can be washed and/or combined with other materials that improve and/or modify characteristics of macromolecules and microspheres. In another embodiment, the microspheres prepared by the methods provided herein do not have a direct therapeutic effect, but serve as micro-carriers for other therapeutic agent(s) or active agent(s) i nciuding nutritional supplements. Therapeutic agents can be added at the time of precipitation or can be added to the suspension of formed microspheres prior to lyophiltzation. Alternatively, therapeutic agents can be blended into dry powder consisting of microspheres. Without being bound by any theory, in one aspect, the methods provided herein can permit the formation of microspheres by: (1) neutralization of charges on the surface of macromoiecule by the counterion and (2) decreased solubility of the macromolscule caused by the combined effects of added organic solvent and gradual cooling. By choosing a suitable pH in the range of about or at pH 2.0 to about or at pH 10.5 or greater, depending on the macromoiecule, counterion, and organic solvent, in the presence of a suitable amount of the counterion, a substantial number of the charged groups, in some embodiment ali charged groups, on the surface of the macromoiecule can become neutralized. A decrease in the polarity of the solution by adding a suitable organic solvent can then initiate the formation of microspheres by precipitation, phase separation, colloid formation, or other such method. Alternatively, without being bound by any theory, in some embodiments, the observed phenomenon of the precipitation of microspheres also can be explained by the kosmotroplc (structure forming) effect of counterions and organic solvents due to interactions with the water molecules of the aqueous solution containing the macromoiecule at tow temperatures. Regardless of the underlying mechanism, in the methods provided herein, the addition of relatively small amounts of organic solvent and counterion to an aqueous or other hydrophilic solution containing a macromolecule and cooling of the solution results in the production of compositions containing microspheres of the macromolecule(s). In one embodiment, gradual cooling of the cocktail solution can be performed by passing the cocktail solution til rough a heat exchanger. The temperature of the heat exchanger and the flow rate of the cocktail through the heat exchanger can be adjusted so that the cocktail Is either pre-chilled prior to formation of the microspheres, or is chilled to a temperature whereby microspheres are formed. In another embodiment, the microspheres formed by the methods provided herein are concentrated or separated from the suspension by methods such as sedimentation or filtration techniques. Upon formation of the microspheres, their growth (size) can be controlled by adjusting the ionic strength, polarity, pH, or other parameters of the suspension. The separation of microspheres from the liquid phase of the cocktail solution can be performed by centrifugation, filtration (hollow fiber, tangential flow, etc.), or other techniques. The resulting microspheres or concentrated suspensions thereof can be lyophitized or air dried. In some embodiments, the microspheres separated from the original precipitation mix or the dried microspheres can be reconstituted prior to administration as a therapeutic agent or a carrier, or can be suspended in solutions that contain agents that modify characteristics of the microspheres. The modifying agents can include but are not limited to bulking agents, excipients, inactive ingredients, stability enhancers, taste and/or odor modifiers or masking agents, vitamins, therapeutic agents, anti-oxidants, immuno-modulators, trans-membrane transport modifiers, anti-caking agents, enteric coating agents, agents that confer acid resistance, such as against the acids of the digestive system, agents that confer protease resistance, chitosans, polymers, and flowability enhancers. The formation and characteristics of the microspheres produced by the methods provided herein can empirically be determined by varying parameters, including: nature and concentration of the macromolecuie, pH of the cocktail solution, nature and concentration of the counterion, nature and concentration of the organic solvent, ionic strength and the cooling rate by which gradual cooling is effected. The steps of the methods provided herein render the method amenable to high-throughput screening, such as in a micraplate format, for determining suitable combinations of macromolecule, organic solvent, counterion, pH, ionic strength and cooling ramp for the generation of microspheres. Macromoiecules Macromolecules that can be used to form microspheres according to the methods provided herein include a variety of therapeutic agents, diagnostic agents, nutritional agents and other active agents.

Other examples of suitable macromolecules include proteins, peptides, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, protein conjugates, viruses, virus particles, and mixtures thereof. The macromolecules can be characterized by their ability to interact with the counterion and organic solvent, such as citrate (counterion) and isopropanol (solvent), to form intact, discrete microspheres containing a high content of macromolecuie. The content of the macromolecuie in the microspheres can vary from about or at 30%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or greater weight/weight (w/w) of the microspheres. In some embodiments, the macromolecuie content of micrasphere is substantially the same as the amount of macromolecuie initially in solution, prior to forming the microsphenes. The macromolecules used to prepare microspheres by the methods provided herein can Include peptides, including polypeptides and proteins, carbohydrates, including polysaccharides and nucleic acids (DNA, RNAor ΡΝΑ). In some embodiments, the macromolecules are proteins, Including therapeutic proteins such as DAS181 (the sialidase fusion protein having the sequence of amino acid residues set forth in SEQ ID ΝΟ:17), aiphalantitrypsin, Ρ18, eglin c, Ecotin, aprotlnin, recombinant human DNase, insulin, interferons, recombinant human DNAse (rhDNAse-, useful, for example, in the treatment of cystic fibrosis as an inhalation therapeutic (Genentech); see also Shak et al„ Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 87:9188-9192 (1990)), human serum albumin, human growth hormone, parathyroid hormone and calcitonin. In some embodiments, the protein is DAS181, the counterion is sodium sulfate or sodium citrate, and the organic solvent is isopropanol. The methods provided herein can avoid the use of conditions, such as heat, that can denature the protein and reduce its activity. The microspheres provided according to the methods provided herein therefore can be used to prepare vaccines or other therapeutic medications that require proteins or peptides to be present In their native conformation. The concentration of the macromolecule in solution, used during precipitation of the microspheres, can be between about or at 0.1 mg/m! to about or at 0.2, 05, 0.8,1.0,2.0, 5.0,10.0,12.0, 15.0, 20.0,25.0,30.0, 35.0, 40.0, 45.0, 50.0,60.0, 70.0, 80.0, 90.0,100, or 200 mg/ml. In some embodiments, the concentration is between about or at 1 mg/ml and about or at 20 mg/ml. Depending on the characteristics of the macromolecule (pi, hydrophobicity, solubility, stability, etc.) and other process parameters, the concentration of macromolecule can empirically be determined to achieve formation of microspheres of a desired size. In general, macromolecules with tower solubility in the solvent (generally, aqueous solvent) priorto adding counterion and organic solvent can be used at lower concentrations (0.1 - 5 mg/mi) to form microspheres according to the methods herein, while macromolecules with higher solubility can be used at 1 - 20 mg/ml or higher. If the formation of amorphous aggregates or aggregated microspheres is observed, the concentration of the macromolecule generally should be decreased to reduce or prevent such aggregation. Nature and concentration of counterion The counterion can be any compound capable of neutralizing one or more oppositely charged groups on the macromolecule at the pH at which the method is performed. Depending on the characteristics of the macromolecule (ρΚ, pi, nature and quantity of charged groups, distribution of charge groups on the surface, solubility and structural stability under different pH conditions), the pH can empirically be determined for microsphere formation. In general, If precipitation is performed at a pH below the ρΚ of the macromolecule, anionic counterions can be used. In general, if precipitation is performed at a pH above the ρΚ of the macromolecule, cationic counterions can be used. The counterion can empirically be selected based on its suitability to initiate microsphere formation, in some embodiments, the counterion can have a molecular weight of 60 Da or greater, or about 75 Da or greater. The counterions can be anionic, cationic or zwitterlonic. Anionic counterions can be inorganic (phosphate, sulphate, thiocyanate, thiosulfate, hypochlorate, nitrate, bromine, iodine, etc.) or organic compounds that carry charge-polarizable groups Including enol, hydroxy, -SH, carboxylic, carboxymethyf, sulfopropyl, sulfonic, and phosphoric. Organic compounds carrying other anionic groups or having negative charge due to other molecular characteristics also can be used. Compounds that can be used as anionic counterions also include, but are not limited to, the following: oxaloacetate, maiate, maleate, oxalate, piruvate, citrate, succinate, fumarate, ketoglutarate, butanetricarboxyllc acid, hydromuconic acid, cyclobutanedicarboxylic acid, dimethyl maleate, deoxyribonucleic acid, poiyglutamic acid, folic acid, lactic acid, ascorbic acid, carminlc acid, sorbic acid, malonic acid, EDTA, MOPS, TES, MES, PIPES, pyridine, tricine, glycine, giycylglycine, betaine, sulfuric acid, thiosulforic acid, phosphoric acid, adenosine triphosphate, nitric acid, itaconic acid, pivalic acid," dimethylmalonic acid, and perchloric acid. In some embodiments, itaconic, pivalic, dimethylmalonic, and succinic acids are used as counterions in the methods provided herein. Cationic counterions can be inorganic (ammonium, phosphonium, sulfonlum, cesium, rubidium, etc.) or organic compounds that carry groups known as amine, amide, imine, imide, guanidine, imidazole, dioxane, aniline. Organic compounds carrying other cationic groups or that have positive charge polarizability due to other molecular characteristics also can be used. Compounds that can be used as cationic counterions also include, but are not limited to, the following: Tris, Bis-Tiis, Bis-Tris propane, diaminopropane, piperazine, piperadine, pentyiamine, diaminobutane, propylamine, trimethyiamine, triethylamine, spermine, spermidine, putrescine, cadaverine, ■ ethanol amine, diethanolamine, triethanolamine, imidazole, tetramethylammonium, trimethylammonium, ammonium, cesium, rubidium, imidazole, polyethilenefmfne, DEAE, ΤΕΑΕ, QAE. Zwltterionic counterions possessing any charged groups in any combination can also be used. Compounds that can be used as zwitterionic counterions include, but are not limited to, the following: HEPES, B1CINE, glycine, glycyigiycine, 6-aminohexanoic add, piperidie add, natural and ποηnatural amino acids (e.g., histidine, glutamine, arginine, lysine). The counterions can be used as acids (e.g. suliuric add) or bases (e.g. imidazole) or their salts (e.g. sodium sulfate or imidazole-HCI). Counterions that can be used in the methods provided herein include those listed by the National Formulary, United States Pharmacopeia, Japanese Pharmacopeia, or European Pharmacopeia, the clinical safety of which has bean demonstrated (citric acid, malic add, amino acids, sulfate, ate.). In some embodiments, counterions used In the methods provided herein include ones for which safety has been established or as falling into the GRAS (generally regarded as safe) category. The counterions (or their salts) can be solid at room temperature (about 25 °C), or at the intended temperature of use and storage). Combinations of two or more counterions also can be used. Volatile and liquid counterions also can be used in the methods provided herein. The concentration of counterion generally is maintained between about 0.1 mM and about 0.2,0.5, 0.8,1.0,2.0, 3.0, 5.0,7.0,10.0, 15.0, 20.0, 30.0, 40.0, 50.0, 60.0, 70.0, 80.0, 90.0 and 100.0 mM. in some embodiments, the concentration of the counterion is between about or at 0.5 mM and about or at 20 mM. Depending on the characteristics of macromolBcule (pi, hydrophobiclty, solubility, stability, etc.) and other process parameters, the concentration of the counterion can empirically be determined using, for example, a high-throughput format as provided herein. In general, the formation of oversized microspheres, amorphous aggregates or aggregated microspheres indicates that the concentration of counterion should be decreased, while failure to form mlcnospheres (broken glass-like crystals or flakes) or formation of microspheres below the desired size indicates that the - concentration of counterion should be increased. Nature and concentration of organic solvent An organic solvent added to the cocktail in the methods provided herein generally can be water miscible and selected from among alcohols (methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol, isopropanol, butanol, tert-bulyl alcohol), chloroform, dimethyl chloride, polyhydric sugar alcohols (glycerin, erythriol, arabitpl, xytitol, sorbitol, mannitol), aromatic hydrocarbons, aldehydes, ketones, esters, ethers (di-ethyl ether), alkanes (hexane, cyclohexane,1 petroleum ether), alkenes, conjugated dienes, toluene, dichloromethane, acetonitrile, ethyl acetate, polyols, potyimids, polyesters, polyaldehydes, and mixtures thereof. In some embodiments, the organic solvent can be volatile. In other embodiments, when incorporation of the organic solvent into the microspheres is desired, non-volatile organic solvents can be used that provide, for example, novel characteristics to the microspheres (e.g., sustained release or added mechanical strength). The concentration of the organic solvent generally can be maintained between about or at 0.1 %, to about or at 0.5%, 1 %, 2%, 5%, 10%, 15%. 20%, 25%, 30%, 40% or 50%, volume/volume (ν/ν). In some embodiments, the concentration of the organic solvent Is between about or at 1 % to about or at 30%, ν/ν. Organic compounds that are partially miscible or completely immiscible with water also can be used. Organic solvents that can be used in the methods provided herein include alcohols and others listed as Class 3 and 2 solvents in International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) Harmonised Tripartite Guideline {Impurities: Guideline for Residual Solvents), safe handling of which has been established in pharmaceutical and food industries. Depending on the characteristics of the macromolecule (hydrophobicity, solubility, stability, etc.) and other process parameters, the choice and concentration of the organic solvent can be optimized, for example, using high-throughput screening on microtiter plates or similar chips or other device. In general, uncontrolled precipitation before the initiation of cooling, the formation of oversized microspheres, amorphous aggregates, aggregated microspheres or sticky aggregates indicates that the concentration of organic solvent should be decreased, while failure to form microspheres (broken glass-like crystals or flakes) or formation of microspheres below the desired size Indicates that the concentration of the organic solvent should be increased. pH in addition to initiating mlcrosphere formation, the counterion also can serve as a buffer. Alternately, in some embodiments, a buffering compound can be used to obtain the desired pH. In some embodiments, the buffering compound is 60 Da or larger. Depending on the characteristics of the macromolecule (pi, hydrophoblG'rty, solubility and stability at a specific pH, etc.) and other process parameters, the optimal pH can empirically be adjusted to achieve formation of microspheres of desired dimensions and preserve the activity of the macromolecule. In general, failure to form microspheres (broken gtass-like crystals or flakes) indicates that the protein may be too soluble under the conditions used. Formation of amorphous aggregates can indicate that precipitation is not well controlled and the protein may not be stable or soluble at the pH used. When the macromolecule is a protein, it has been observed that certain protein/counterion combinations can cause immediate and uncontrolled precipitation at certain pH values. The high-throughout screening methods provided herein can be used to empirically determine the appropriate combination of protein, pH and counterion to form microspheres of desired dimensions. This is easily remedied by changing the pH of the cocktail, by using a different counterion or by decreasing concentration of the protein in cocktail. In general, for forming protein-based microspheres, a pH value that is below the pi of the protein provides optimal microsphere formation Ionic strength The ionic strength of the cocktail solution can be modulated by the concentration of the counterion or by other salts such as chlorides or acetates. In some embodiments, no additional salt is required to produce microspheres. In certain embodiments, the ionic strength can be adjusted to preserve the structural integrity and activity of the macromolecuie. Examples of other applications where the presence of specific salts can be beneficial include formulations of parenteral and other drugs, or foods where specific tonicity or buffering capacity may be required upon reconstitution of microspheres. Cooling ramp The cocktail containing a macromolecuie, a counterion and an organic solvent initially is prepared, prior to cooling, at a temperature at which the macromolecuie is soluble, generally about -15 °C to about 30 °C. In some embodiments, the initial temperature, prior to cooling is at ambient temperature (18-25 °C). The microspheres are formed by a process such as precipitation, phase separation or colloid formation upon gradual cooling to a temperature below the temperature at which the macromolecuie is dissolved and in solution. The rate at which cooling is performed can control the formation and other characteristics such as size of the microspheres. In general, when the macromolecuie is protein, flash-freezing in liquid nitrogen does not generate microspheres The rate at which coojing and freezing of the cocktail (cooling ramp) is performed can determine the final size of the microspheres, in general, a faster cooling ramp yields smaller microspheres whereas a slower cooling ramp yields larger mictospheres. Without being bound by any theory, the cooling rate can determine the rate oft (1) nucleation that produces initial smaller microspheres and (2) a fusion process in which the initial microspheres coalesce (aggregate) and anneal into larger microspheres. Fusion of the smaller particles into larger ones is a time dependent process that can be determined, for example, by the duration for which liquid suspension of microspheres exists prior to freezing. Due to the reversible nature of the bonds between certain macromolecules, such as some proteins, in the microsphere compositions provided herein, smaller microspheres annealing into larger particles can generate microspheres with smooth surfaces. Depending on the size of microparticles desired, the cooling rate can be from about 0.01 “C/min or 0.01 “C/min to about 20 "C/min or 20 “C/min; from about or at 0.05 °C/min or about or at 0.1 “C/min to about or at 10 °C/min or about or at 15 “C/min, from about or at 0.2 °C/min to about or at 5 “C/min, from about or at 0.5 “C/mln to about or at 2 “C/min, or about or at 1 “C/min. in some embodiments, the cooling ramp can be between 0,1 “C per minute and about 40 °C per minute. In other embodiments, a cooling ramp can be between about 0.5 °C per minute and 15 °C per minute. Depending on the specific needs, in some embodiments it can be desirable to adapt the production process to the specific equipment, in some embodiments, a lyophilizer with temperature-controlled shelves can be used for the cooling. If the microspheres produced are larger than desired, other parameters of the process including concentration of macromolecule, organic solvent, counterion, Ionic strength and/or pH can be modified to achieve the desired reduction in size of the microspheres. For a faster cooling ramp (smaller particle size), the cocktail solution can be passed through a heat exchanger, such as that used in a continuous mode. If the size of microspheres needs to be increased, increased concentrations of one of the cocktail ingredients (macromolecule, organic soivent, counterion) can provide the desired Increase in the size of micraspheres. tn general, the cooling should be performed uniformly and at a steady rate to prevent the formation of aggregates and crystals. Depending on the concentration of the organic solvent, the precipitation of the macromolecule into microspheres can occur in several ways. At higher concentrations of organic solvent (about 5% - 40%, dependent on the actual components used) the microspheres generally can form when the cocktail solution is still in liquid form. At lower concentrations of organic solvent (2 - 25%, dependent on the actual components used) ice crystals can form first, following which foe expelled macromolecules and organic solvent reach can reach a critical local concentration and precipitate. A further decrease of temperature in the nearbottom layer of the lyopbilizer tray can lead to complete solidification of the liquid suspension and further expulsion of foe organic solvent into the top layer. An excess of organic solvent in the top layer can cause uncontrolled precipitation of the macromolecule and aggregation of microspheres. This effect usually can be alleviated by selecting appropriate ratios of the components -macromolecule, counterion, organic solvent, salts, etc. in foe cocktail. In addition, maintaining a thin layer of cocktail in the lyophilization tray or mixing of the cocktail while being chilled can prevent formation of aggregates and crystals and yield uniform microspheres. For example if a relatively low concentration of Isopropanol (e.g. 2-6%) is used, and a thin layer of cocktail (10-20 mm) is filled into foe tray, and the tray is placed on a pre-chilled shelf (-30 -75°C) uniform microspheres can be obtained. The methods provided herein can lead to substantially all or all the protein or other macro molecule being incorporated from the solution into the microspheres High-throughout screening of microparticle formation conditions and optimization of particle formation Depending on the characteristics of the macromolecule, thB composition of the cocktail solution used to prepare the microspheres according to the methods provided herein can be optimized. The optimization can rapidly be performed in a medium or high throughput format using, for example microtlier p!ate(s) or chips where tens to hundreds to thousands to tens of thousands of cocktails can be screened simultaneously. In some embodiments, a number of pH values in conjunction with cationic, anionic or zwitterlonie counterions and organic solvents at various concentrations can be screened. For example, the screening can be performed using several identical microtiter plates, to each of which the macromolecule of interest Is added at various concentrations. Each set of test conditions Gan be screened in duplicate, in some embodiments, microplates with flat-bottom wells can be used with the skirt of the microtiter pfate broken off to permit good heat transfer between the lyophilizer shelf and the bottoms of the wells. The microplates can be placed on the shelves of the lyophilizer and cooled to form microspheres and to subsequently solidify the suspensions. Upon freezing of the contents of the wells, a vacuum can applied. At the end of lyophilizatlon, one of ihe duplicate plates can be reconstituted with water or a buffer of choice to observe if certain conditions rendered the macromolecule Insoluble or reduced its activity. Conditions that resulted in material that can readily be resolubilized or provide microspheres with desirable characteristics can be subjected to further analysis by spectroscopic, chromatographic, enzymatic or other assays to confirm that native structure and activity are preserved. Lyophiiized material in a duplicate plate can be used for microscopy to determine whether microspheres are formed. Conditions that produced microspheres can further be modified and fine-tuned to produce microspheres of desirable size and characteristics. Kits for performing high-throughput screens can be provided and can contain all the ingredients used in the methods provided herein Including one or more of a macnomolecufe, such as a protein, buffers, pre-dispensed cocktail of known composition (organic solvent, counterion) and/or salts. Kits can contain 3,4,5,10,15,20,30,40,50,100 or more (typically 96 or mors) buffers with predetermined pH, counterion, ionic strength and organic solvent in each microtiter plate. The microtiter plate supplied with the kit can be modified so that bottoms of wells are in direct contact with the shelf of iyophilfzer. C. Macromolecular Microparticle Compositions The macromolecules contained in the microparticle compositions obtained by the methods provided herein are substantially structurally and chemically unchanged by the methods. For example, when the macromolecule is Green Fluorescent Protein or Red Fluorescent Protein, their fluorescence and native conformation and activity of the proteins are retained in the microparticles. The d ry microspheres, obtained by volatilizing substantially all of the solvents and/or moisture except for the solvent and other components associated with the microspheres, can be stored and their activity can substantially be recovered upon reconstitution. The relatively low moisture content of the microparticles provided herein, for example, between about or at 0.1% to about or at 0.2%, 0.3%, 0.5%, 1.0%, 2.0%, 3.0%, 4.0%, 5.0%, 5.5%, 6.0%, 6.5%. 7.0%, 7.5%, 8.0%, 8.5%, 9.0%, 9.5%, 10.0%, 10.5%, 11.0%, 11.5%, 12.0%, 12.5%, 14%, 16%, 16%, 17%, 18% 19%, or 20%, can provide improved stability. The microsphenes obtained by the methods provided herein also are homogeneous in size and shape, and can be obtained reproducibly with the desired characteristics. Other techniques traditionally used for preparation of dry formulations (salt precipitation, alcohol or acetone precipitation, lyophilization, e.g.) can result in complete or partial denaturation of the macromolecules, such as proteins. In addition, the microspheres prepared by the methods provided herein avoid the need for complex or specialized spray drying, spray freeze-drying, supercritical fluid anti-solvent based processes or milling processes (See, for example, Laube BL.

The microparticles obtained by the methods provided herein can be of any shape and can have sizes (mean width or diameters) in the range of from about or at 0.001 micron to about or at 0.002, 0.005,0.01, 0.02,0.03,0.05, 0.1,0.2, 0.3, 0.5,1.0, 2.0, 2.5,3.0, 3.5, 4.0,4.5,5.0, 5.5,6.0,6.5, 7.0, 7.5, 8.0. 8.5, 9.0, 9.5,10.0,15.0, 20.0,25.0, 30.0,35.0,40.0,45.0, or 50.0 or greater microns. For pulmonary administration to the alveoli, the size can be from about 0.1 micron or less to about 0.5 micron. For pulmonary administration to the throat, trachea and bronchi, the size can be from about or at 0.5 microns to about or at 1.0,1.5,2.0,2.5,3.0,3.5,4.0,4.5,5,0,5.5, 6.0, or 6.5 microns, or in some embodiments from about or at 1.0 micron to about or at 2.0 microns. In some embodiments, the microparticles are substantially spherical in shape. The macromolecules that can be used to form microparticles according to the methods provided herein can include therapeutic and diagnostic agents, processed foods, dietary supplements and polymers. In some embodiments, cross-linking agents, salts, or other compounds can be included in foe formulation cocktail to modify solubility of the microspheres and/or enhance their mechanical strength. In some embodiments, microspheres that are insoluble in most aqueous or organic solvents can be used to manufacture particles such as chromatographic resins and dispersible abrasives, in other embodiments, microspheres with partial solubility in solvents such as pharmaceutical vehicles for delivery can be useful in foe manufacture of sustained release active agent or therapeutic formulations. In some embodiments, the microparticles provided herein can be used in combination with an inhaler device to deliver a therapeutic dose of macromolecular microspheres to the respiratory airways and lungs of a subject. For example, when the macromolecule is the DAS181 protein (sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 17), microspheres of about 0.5 micron to about 8 microns, or about 1 micron to about 5 micron can be obtained by the meihods provided herein, using sodium sulfate as foe counterion and isopropanol as the organic solvent. For DAS181 microspheres, which are administered to prevent or treat viral infections that initiate In the respiratory tract, such as influenza, it can be desirable to deposit the microspheres in the throat, trachea or bronchi. The DAS181 fusion protein formulated as microspheres can act by degrading the receptor sialic acids in the throatftrachea/bronchl, thus preventing viral binding and infection at these sites. For optima! delivery of the DAS181 microspheres to sites where respiratory viral infection can be initiated, ;·℮., in the throat, trachea or bronchi, the microspheres must not be (a) so big that they are trapped at the front end in the mouth (/.℮., microspheres are too big, about 8 microns or greater); or (b) so small that they are absorbed deep In the lungs and absorbed systemically into the,blood stream through the alveoli where they are not active and/or can be toxic (/.e., 0.5 micron or smaller). For delivery of the DAS181 microspheres to the throat, trachea and bronchi, a size range of about 1 micron to about 5.5 - 6 microns generally can be suitable. The tnhaiercan be used to treat any medical condition in which the protein or other macromotecuie can be administered by inhalation therapy. Typical inhaler devices can include dry powder Inhalers, metered dose inhalers, and electrostatic delivery devices. Typical applications of the delivery apparatus include the deep lung delivery of insulin and other therapeutic proteins. In some embodiments, the microspheres obtained by the methods provided herein also can be delivered by oral ingestion, intranasaily, intravenously, intramuscularly, subcutaneously, and by other delivery methods suitable for the delivery of therapeutic molecules. The microsphere formulations for pulmonary delivery generally can be in a size range of about 0.5 micron to about 5-6 microns, while those designed for other types of delivery, such as subcutaneous delivery, parenteral delivery or intramuscular delivery can be in a range of from about or at 10 micron to about or at 30, 40 or 50 microns. in some embodiments, the microspheres provided herein have no direct therapeutic effect but can serve as micro-carriers for other therapeutic agent(s). Examples of macromolecules useful for preparation of such microspheres include but are not limited to polysaccharides, glycans, proteins, peptides, polymers or combinations thereof. Therapeutic agents or other active agents can be added at the time of microsphere formation or added to the suspension of formed microspheres. Alternatively, therapeutic agents can be blended with the dry microsphere compositions by mixing, tumbling or other techniques practiced in pharmaceutical and food industries. In some embodiments, cross-linking agents, lipophilic substances, salts such as those with poor solubility in aqueous solvents, or combinations thereof or other compounds can be included in the formulation cocktaif solution to modify the solubility of the microspheres and/or enhance their mechanical strength. Slow dissolution of the microspheres can be useful in sustained release of therapeutics delivered by oral ingestion, inhalation, intranasally, intravenously, intramuscularly, subcutaneously, and by other delivery methods suitable for the delivery of therapeutic molecules. In some embodiments, the microspheres can be delivered by oral ingestion in a form of a pill or capsule with an enteric coating, endocytosed from the duodenum, and the macromolecule released into the blood stream or other site of action. In some embodiments, the microspheres can be rendered insoluble by partial denaturation of the macromolecuie, which upon delivery becomes renatured and bioavailable. In other embodiments, the microspheres are substantially spherical In shape, and can have mean diameters within the range of from about 0.1 microns to 30.0 microns. In yet other embodiments, the mean diameter of the microspheres can be within the range of from about 0.5 microns to 5.0 microns, or from about 1.0 microns to 2.0 microns. in yet another aspect, provided herein are devices and methods for delivering the microspheres to a subject, such as an animal or human patient in need of medical treatment Suitable delivery routes can include parenteral, such as i.m., i.v. and s.c., and non-parenteral, such as oral, buccal, intrathecal, nasal, pulmonary, transderma!, transmucosal, and the like delivery routes. Delivery devices can include syringes, both needleless and needle containing, and inhalers. The delivery devices can contain a single dose of the microspheres for treating a condition that is treatable by rapid or sustained release of the macromolecuie in vivo. The number of microspheres present in the single dose is dependent on the type and activity of the macromolecule. The single dose can be selected to achieve sustained release over a period of time that has been optimized for treating the particular medical condition. For example, when the macromolecule is the DAS181 ttision protein (SEQ ID Νθ:17), the delivery dosage of microsphere compositions containing DAS181 can be from between about 0.5 mg protein per dose to about 100 mg protein per dose, or about 0.75 mg, 1 mg, 1.5 mg, 2 mg, 3 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg, 30 mg. 40 mg, 45 mg, 50 mg, 55 mg or 60 mg protein per dose. The macromolecuie component of the microsphere can be any molecule capable of forming microspheres according to the methods provided herein. In some embodiments the macromolecuie is a protein, including enzymes and recombinant proteins, peptides, carbohydrates, polysaccharides, carbohydrate- or polysaccharide-protein conjugates, nucleic acids, virus, virus particles, conjugates of small molecules (such as a hapten) and proteins, or mixtures thereof. An organic or inorganic natural or synthetic pharmaceutical compound or drug can be incorporated into the microspheres by attaching the drug to a macromolecuie, such as a protein, and then forming the microspheres from the macromoiecuie-drug complex or conjugate. It will be understood by those skilled in the art that a compound incapable of having a tertiary and quaternary structure can be formed into a microsphere by incorporation or coupling of the compound into a carrier molecule that has a tertiary and quaternary structure. It wili further be understood by those of skill in the art that the macromolecuie can be a portion of a molecule such as, for example, a peptide, a single-stranded segment of a double-stranded nucleic acid molecule, or a virus particle, or other macromolecuie having a tertiary and quaternary structure. The term "macromolecuie" also can include a plurality of macromolecules and includes combinations of different macromolecules such as a combination of a pharmaceutical compound and an affinity molecule for targeting the pharmaceutical compound to a tissue, organ or tumor requiring treatment. An affinity molecule can be, for example, a ligand or a receptor. Examples of ligands can include viruses, bacteria, polysaccharides, or toxins that can act as antigens to generate an immune response when administered to an animal and cause the production of antibodies. In some embodiments, the macromolecule is a therapeutic protein including, but not limited to, a sialidase, a sialidase fusion protein, a fusion protein containing a sialidase catalytic domain fused to a GAG-binding domain, a protease, a protease inhibitor, insulin, interferons, human growth · hormone, calcitonin, rhDNase or parathyroid hormone, and the protein content of the microspheres can be from about or at 50% to about or at 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 60%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or greater. For pulmonary administration, the microspheres can have an average size In the range of from about or at 0.5 microns to about or at 5.0 microns, and in some embodiments, between about or at 1 micron and about or at 2 microns.

An inhaler device can be used to deliver a therapeutic protein such as those listed above or other macromolecule-based microspheres to the respiratory airways and lungs of a subject. The protein microspheres can be prepared, for example by contacting an aqueous solution of the protein with a carboxylic acid such as citrate, or sulfate or other counterion and an organic solvent such as Isopropanol, and cooling the solution to form the micraspheres. The protein can be a therapeutic protein, such as a sialidase, a protease inhibitor, insulin, human growth hormone, calcitonin, rhDNase or parathyroid hormone, and tha protein content of the microspheres can be about or at 70% to about or at 90% or more, 95% or more, or at least about 99% or more. For pulmonary administration, the microspheres, for example DAS181 microspheres, can be sized to have a mean diameter in the range of from about 0.5 microns to 5.0 microns, or between about 1 micron to about 2 microns. Incubation conditions for forming the microspheres can be optimized to incorporate at least about 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 977ο, 98%, or 99% or greater of the total amount of macromolecute present in the solution prior to formation of tha micraspheres, by adjusting parameters including pH, temperature, concentration of macromolecule, or duration of reaction or incubation. In some embodiments, a molecule or compound that does not produce microspheres of desirable characteristics, can be incorporated into microspheres having desirable characteristics, e.g., of size, delivery profile, mechanical strength, by incorporation or coupling of the compound with a carrier molecule that can form microspheres with desirable characteristics. In some embodiments, the carrier macromolecule is a protein, and the molecule or compound is bound inside and/or on the surface of the microsphere, in some embodiments, the molecule or compound also can sen/e as the counterion and Initiate and/or facilitate the formation of micraspheres. When preparing micraspheres containing a protein, a protein stabilizer such as glycerol, fatty acids, sugars such as sucrose, ions such as zinc, sodium chloride, of any other protein stabilizers known to those skilled in the art can be added prior to cooling the cocktail during microsphere formation to minimize protein denaturation. 1η some embodiments the mferospheres can further be coated on the surface with suitable molecules and/or coating agents, such as those that lend resistance to acids, such as digestive acids, or proteases. In other embodiments, the microspheres can be non-covalently coated with compounds such as fatty acids or lipids. The coating can be applied to the microspheres by immersion in the solubilized coating substance, then spraying the microspheres with the substance, or by using other methods known to those of skill in the art. In some embodiments, the fatty acids or lipids are added directly to the microsphere-forming cocktail solution. Formation of the microspheres by decreasing temperature can be performed by a multitude of conventional methods in batch or continuous modes. Microsphere formation can further be triggered by other methods including, but not limited to, modulating atmospheric pressure, g-force or surface expansion, including seeding. Microsphere formation can occur immediately upon exposure to these conditions or can require an extended period of time as provided herein. Proteins Exemplary proteins that can be used to form microparticles by the methods provided herein are described betow, Sialidases Sialidases, also referred to as neuraminidases and Νacylneuraminosylglycohydrolases, are a family exogiycosldases that catalyze the removal of terminal sialic acid residues from sialo-glycoconjugates. Sialic acids are a family of α keto acids with 9-carbon backbones that are usually found at the outermost positions of the oligosaccharide drains attached to glycoproteins and glycolipids. These molecules are involved in a variety of biological functions and processes, such as the regulation of innate immunity, cell adhesion, and the interaction between inflammatory celts and target cells, possibly mediated through the binding of various fectins (Varki etal. (1992) Curr Opin Cell Bio! 4:257-266). Sialic acids also are excellent sources of carbon, nitrogen, energy, and precursors of cell wall biosynthesis. Further still, siaiic acids on eukaryotic ceils can be used as receptors or coreceptors for pathogenic microorganisms, including, but not limited to, influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, some coronavirus and rotavirus, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Helicobacter pylori and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The most prominent member of the sialic acid famiiy is N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac), which is the biosynthetic precursor for most of the other types. Two major linkages befween NeuSAc and the penultimate gatactose residues of carbohydrate side chains are found in nature, Neu5Ac a(2,3)-Ga! and NeuSAc a(2,6)-Gai. Both Neu5Ac a(2,3)-Gal and Neu5Ac a(2,€)-Gal molecules can be recognized by influenza viruses and used as the receptor through which the virus binds and initiates infection. Human influenza viruses, however, seem to prefer NeuSAc a(2,6)-Gai, while avian and equine influenza viruses predominantly recognize NeuSAc a(2,3)-Gat (Ito et al. (2000) Microbiol Immunol 44;423-730). The human respiratory epithelium expresses both forms of sialic acids, but a(2,6)-Iinked sialic acid is more abundant than α(2,3)- linked sialic acid. The low abundance of α(2,3)- linked sialic add is most likely the basis for the species barrier for avian viruses, and indicates that reducing the level of a receptor sialic acid expressed on the airway epithelium would likely reduce the infectivity of an influenza virus. Thus, sialidases, which remove terminal sialic acid residues from sialo-gtycoconjugates, present themselves as potential influenza virus therapeutic agents that function to reduce the levels of receptor sialic acids. Sialidases also can act as therapeutic agents for any other pathogen that utilizes sialic acids in the infection process including, but not limited to, Μ. pneumoniae, Μ. catarrhalis, Η. pyioii, Η. influenzae, S. pneumoniae, Ρ, aeruginosa, parainfluenza viruses and some coronavliuses and rotaviruses. Sialidases tend to be highly substrate specific. They can target particular types of complex moiecuies, such as glycoproteins or glycolipids; specific sugar linkages (e.g. 2-3,2-6, or 2-8); or can be sensitive to the nature of the linkage sugar itself (e.g. D-galactose, N-acetyl-Dgaiactosamine). Substrata moiecuies include, but are not limited to, oligosaccharides, polysaccharides, glycoproteins, gangliosides, and synthetic motecules. For example, a sialldase can cleave bonds having a(2,3)-Gal, a(2,6)-Gal, or a(2,8)-Gal linkages between a sialic acid residue and the remainder of a substrate molecule. A sialidase also can cleave any or all of the linkages between the sialic acid residue and the remainder of the substrate molecule. Many sialidase proteins have been purified from microbes and higher eukaryotes and of these, several have been shown to catalyze the removal of terminal sialic acid residues than can serve as receptors for pathogenic microorganisms. For example, among the large bacterial sialidases are those that that can degrade the influenza receptor sialic acids NeuSAc a(2,6)-Gal and NeuSAc a(2,3)-Gal, including sialidases from Clostridium perfringens, Actinomyces viacosus, Arthmbacier ureafaclens, and Micromonospora vlridifaclens. Other sialidases that can serve as therapeutic agents include the human sialidases, such as those encoded by the genes NEU2 and NEU4. Sialidase-GAG fusion proteins Sialidase-GAG fusion proteins are proteins that are made up of a sialidase protein, or catalytically active portion thereof, fused to a glycosamlrroglycan (GAG)-binding sequence. As such, these proteins effectively contain an anchoring domain (the GAG-binding sequence) and a therapeutic domain (the sialidase protein, or catalytically active portion thereof). The sialidase-GAG fusion proteins are designed to bind to the epithelium and remove the surrounding sialic acids, and can therefore be used as a therapeutic agent against pathogens that utilize sialic acids in the infection process. The ability of the fusion protein to bind to the epithelium increases its retention when the fusion protein is administered, for example, as an inhalant to treat influenza Infection. The GAG-blndfng sequence acts as an epithelium-anchoring domain that tethers the sialidase to the respiratory epithelium and increases its retention and patency. Heparan sulfate, closely related to heparin, Is a type of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) that is ubiquitously present on cell membranes, including the surface of respiratory epithelium. Many proteins specifically bind to heparlnfheparan sulfate, and the GAG-binding sequences in these proteins have been identified. For example, the GAG-binding sequences of human platelet factor 4 (PF4) (SEQ ID ΝΟ:3), human interleukin 8 (IL8) (SEQ ID ΝΟ:4), human anttthrombin lit (AT III) (SEQ ID ΝΟ:5), human apoprotein Ε (ΑροΕ) (SEQ ID ΝΟ:6), human angio-associaled migratory cell protein (ΑΑΜΡ) (SEQ ID ΝΟ:7), or human amphireguiin (SEQ ID ΝΟ:8) have been shown to exhibit high affinity for heparin (Lee et at. (1991) PNAS 88:2768-2772; GogeretaL (2002) Biochem. 41:1640-1646; Witt et al. (1994) CunrBio 4:394-400; Weisgraber et al. (1986) J Bio Chem 261:2068-2076). The GAG-binding sequences of these proteins are distinct from their receptor-binding sequences, so they do not induce the biological activities associated with the full-length proteins or the receptor-binding domains. These sequences, or other sequences that can bind heparin/heparan sulfate, can be used as epithelium-anchoring-domains in sialidase-GAG fusion proteins. In the context of a sialidase-GAG fusion protein, the sialidase can include the entire sialidase protein, or a catalyticaliy active portion thereof. For example, sialidase-GAG fusion protein can contain the 901 amino acid sialidase protein from A. viscosus set forth in SEQ ID ΝΟ:1. In another example, the sialidase-GAG fusion protein can contain the 394 amino acid catalyticaliy active portion of a sialidase protein from A. v/scosus set forth in SEQ ID ΝΟ:2. The GAG-binding sequence can be linked to the sialidase by recombinant methods. In some examples, the fusion protein can include an amino acid linker, such as four glycine residues. Furthermore, linkage can be via the Ν- or C-terminus of the GAG-binding sequence, or the N-or C-terminus of the sialidase. Exemplary examples of sialidase-GAG fusion proteins include those polypeptides set forth in SEQ ID NOS: 9-13, and 17. In a further example, the sialidase and GAG-binding sequence components can be linked using chemical or peptide linkers, by any method known in the art, Proteinase inhibitors Proteinase inhibitor 8 (PI8), also known as Serpin Β8, is a serine protease inhibitor (serpin). Serpins are a large superfamily of structurally related proteins that are expressed in viruses, insects, plants and higher organisms, but not in bacteria or yeast. Serpins regulate the activity of proteases involved in many biological process, including .coagulation, fibrinolysis, inflammation, cell migration, and tumorigenesis. They contain a surface-exposed reactive site loop (RSL), which acts as a “bait" for proteases by mimicking a protease substrate sequence. On binding of the target protease to the serpin, the RSL is cleaved, after which the protease is covalently linked to the serpin. The protease in the newly formed serpinprotease complex is inactive (Huntington et al. (2000) Nature 407:923-926). Ρ18 is a member of a suhfamify of serpins of which chicken ovalbumin is the archtype. Like other serpins that belong to this family, Ρ18 lacks a fyplcal cleavable N-terminal signal sequence, resulting in a 374 amino acid protein (SEQ ID ΝΟ:14) that resides mainly Intracellularly. Other members of this human ovalbumin-like subfamily include plasminogen activator Inhibltortype 2 (PAI-2), monocyte neutrophil elastase inhibitor (MNEI), squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCCA)-1, leupin (SCCA-2) maspin (PIS), protease inhibitor 6 (Ρ16), protease inhibitor (Ρ19) and bomapin (PH 0). Within this family the serpins Ρ16, Ρ18, and Ρ19 show the highest structural homology (up to 68% amino acid identity) (Sprecher et al. (1995) J Biol Chem 270:29854-29861). PI-8 has been shown to inhibit trypsin, thrombin, factor Xa, subtilisin A, furin, and also chymotrypsin In vitro. It is released by platelets and appears to be involved in the regulation of furin activity and, therefore, platelet aggregation (LeBlond et al. (2008) Thromb Haemost 95:243-252). In addition to their role in the regulation of endogenous biological processes, such as coagulation, serine protease inhibitors also can function to inhibit the biological activities of exogenous microorganisms. For example, a number of serine protease inhibitors have been shown to reduce influenza virus activation in cultured cells, chicken embryos and in the lungs of infected mice. The serpins bind to hemagglutinin (HA) molecules on the surface of the influenza vims and inhibit its activity; thus reducing the irifectlvity of the virus. For example trypsin inhibitors, such as: aprotlnln (Zhirnov et al. (2002) J Virol 76:8682-8689), leupeptin (Zhirnov et al. (2002) J Viro) 76:8682-8689; Tashiro et al. (1987) J Gen Virol 68:2039-2043), soybean protease inhibitor (Barbey-Morel et al. (1987) J Infect Dis 155:667-672), e-aminocaprolc acid (Zhlmov et a).. 1982. Arch Virol 73:263-272) and n-p-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethylketone (TLCK) (Barbey-Morel et al. (1987) J Infect Dis 155:667-672) have all been shown to inhibit influenza virus infection, and are candidate therapeutic agents for use in the treatment of influenza virus infection. Titus, as a related trypsin inhibitor, Ρ18 also can be used as a therapeutic agent in the treatment of influenza virus infection.

EXAMPLE 1 Preparation of microspheres of the sialidase fusion protein, DAS181 A. Purification of DAS181 OAS181 is a fusion protein containing the heparin (glysosamino glycan, or GAG) binding domain from human amphiregulln fused via its N-terminus to the C-terminus of a catalytic domain of Actinomyces viscosus (sequence of amino acids set forth in SEQ ID Ν0:17), The DAS181 protein was purified as described in Malakhov ef a/., Antimicrob. Agents Chemother., 1470-1479, 2006, which Is incorporated in its entirety by reference herein. Briefly, the DNA fragment coding for DAS181 was cloned into the plasmid vector pTrc99a (Pharmacia; SEQ ID ΝΟ:16) under the control of a IPTG (isopropyl-JJ-D-thiogalactopyranosidej-inducible promoter. The resulting construct was expressed in the BL21 strain of Eschenchia coli (Ε. coli). The Ε, coli cells containing the expressed construct were lysed by sonication in 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 8.0; 0.3 Μ NaC! and 10% glycerol. The clarified lysate was passed through an SP-Sepharose column. Proteins were eluted from the column with lysis buffer that contained 0.8 Μ Nad. The fraction eluted from SP-Sepharose was adjusted to 1.9 Μ ammonium sulfate ((ΝΗ4)25θ4), clarified by centrifugation, and loaded onto a butyl-Sepharose column. The column was washed with two volumes of 1.3 Μ (NH4)2S04, and the DAS181 fusion protein was eluted with 0.66 Μ (NH4)2S04. For the final step, size exclusion chromatography was performed on Sephacryl S-200 equilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The protein purity was determined to be greater than 98% as assessed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, reversed-phase highpressure liquid chromatography, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with antibodies generated against Ε. coliceii proteins. The purified DAS181, molecular weight 44,800 Da, was dialyzed against 2 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0. Β. Activity of DAS181 The sialidase activity of DAS181 was measured using the fluorogenic substrate 4-methyIumbeiliferyt-/V-acetyI-a-D-neuraminic acid (4-MU-NANA; Sigma). One unit of siaiidase Is defined as the amount of enzyme that releases 10 nmol of MU from 4-MU-NANA in 10 minutes at 37 °C (50 mM CHaCOOH-NaOH buffer, pH 5.5) in a reaction that contains 20 nmol of 4-MU-NANA in a 0.2 ml volume (Potier et al, Anal. Btochem., 94:287-296,1979). The specific activity of DAS181 was determined to be 1,300 U/mg protein (0.77 pg DAS181 protein per unit of activity). C. Preparation of microspheres using purified OAS181 DAS181 (10 mg/ml), purified and prepared as described under Section A above, was used to form 200 pi cocktails as shown below. The cocktails contained either glycine or citrate as counterions, and isopropanol as organic solvent, as follows: 1) DAS181 + 5 mM glycine, pH 5,0; 2) DAS181 + 5 mM glycine, pH 5.0 + 10% isopropanol; 3) DAS181 + 5 mM sodium citrate, pH 5.0; 4) DAS181 + 5 mM sodium citrate, pH 5.0 + 10% isopropanol; Plastic microcentrifuge tubes containing the cocktails with ingredients as described in 1) - 4) above were gradually cooled from: (a) ambient temperature (about 25 °C) to 4 °C by placing the cocktails in a refrigerator, followed by: (b) cooling to -20 'C by placing the resulting cocktail from (a) in a freezer, followed by: (c) freezing to -80 'C by placing the resulting cocktail from b) in a freezer. Under optimal conditions, microspheres would be expected to form between about 4 °G to about -20 °C (generally in the range of about -2 °C to about -15 °C). Freezing to -80 °G is carried out to remove ingredients from the cocktail other than the microspheres (e.gr., solvent, eft?.) by freeze-drying. Cocktail 4) was prepared in triplicate, two aliquots in plastic tubes and one in a glass tube. One aliquot (in a plastic tube) was cooled as described above, while the two other aliquots (one in a plastic tube and one in a glass tube) were subjected to snap cooling/freezing by dipping the tubes into liquid nitrogen. Upon freezing, all tubes were placed into the iyophilizer and the volatiles (water and isopropanol) were removed by sublimation, leaving the dry pellets. Results: The dry pellets recovered from the cocktails treated as described above, were tested for the presence of microspheres. Of the above samples, microspheres with good dispersivity characteristics, about 2 microns (pm) in size, were observed only with cocktail 4) containing citrate counterion and isopropanoi and subjected to gradual cooling. The counterion glycine did not prove to be optimal for the DAS181 protein (cocktail 2)), showing a mixture of glass-like crystals and agglomerates with only a few microspheres. When no organic solvent was present, a giass-Jike mass of lyophilized DAS 181 protein was obtained and no micnospheies were observed (cocktails 1) and 3)). Snap-freezing of cocktail 4) in a glass tube produced glass-like crystals and no microspheres, while snap-freezing of cocktail 4) in a plastic tube (cooling rate is slightly slower due to slower diffusion of heat through plastic than through glass) produced agglomerated microspheres. This example demonstrates that microspheres with narrow size distribution and good dispersivity (minimal agglomeration) can be produced by a combination of appropriate protein, counterion, organic solvent and gradual cooling, using the methods provided herein. EXAMPLE 2 Size of DAS181 microspheres as a function of organic solvent concentration DAS181 was purified and used to prepare microspheres as described above in Example 1 (see cocktail 4)), using a combination of DAS181 protein (10 mg/ml), citrate counterion (sodium citrate, 5 mM) and isopropanol organic solvent (10%, 20% or 30%). The resulting cocktail soiutions were cooled from ambient temperature (about 25 °C) to 4 “C, followed by cooling to -20 "C, followed by freezing to -80 'C, as described in Example 1. Upon freezing to 80 “C, the tubes are placed in a lyophilizer and the volatiles (water and isopropanoi) were removed by sublimation, leaving the dry powder containing microspheres. Results; Microsphere formation was observed with all three concentrations: 10%, 20%, or 30%, of the organic solvent Isopropanol. The dimensions of the microspheres however varied, depending on the concentration of the organic solvent. The sizes of the microspheres as determined by comparing the particles to a grid on a hemocytometer were estimated to be 2 microns using 10% isopropanol, 4 microns using 20% .isopropanol, and 5-6 microns using 30% isopropanoi. These results demonstrate that the size of the microparticles can be engineered as desired using an appropriate concentration of organic solvent. EXAMPLE 3 Size.'of DAS1S1 microspheres as a function ofprotein concentration DAS181 was purified and used to prepare microspheres as described above in Example 1 (see cocktail 4)), using a combination of DAS181 protein (5 mg/ml or 10 mg/ml), citrate counterion (sodium citrate, 5 mM) and Isopropanoi (5% or 20%). The resulting cocktail solutions were cooled from ambient temperature (about 25 °C) to 4 °C, followed by cooling to -20 °C, followed by freezing to -80 "C, as described in Example 1. Upon freezing to 80 °C, the tubes were placed in a lyophilizer and the volatiles (water and isopropanoi) were removed by sublimation, leaving the dry powder containing microspheres. Results: Microsphere formation was observed with both concentrations ofprotein (5 mg/ml and 10 mg/ml), and both concentrations of organic solvent (5% or 20%). The dimensions of the microspheres however varied. Cocktails containing 5 mg/ml or 10 mg/ml protein and 5% isopropanoi produced microspheres estimated to be about 1.5 micron in size. The cocktail containing 5 mg/ml protein and 20% isopropanoi produced microspheres of an estimated size of about 3 microns, while the cocktail containing 10 mg/m) protein and 20% isopropanoi produced microspheres of an estimated size of about 4 microns. These results demonstrate that the size of the microparticles can be engineered as desired using an appropriate concentration of protein, or an appropriate combination of concentration of organic solvent and concentration of protein. EXAMPLE 4 Size of DAS181 microspheres as a function of counterion concentration DAS181 was purified and used to prepare microspheres as described above in Example 1 (see cocktail 4)), using a combination of DAS 181 protein (10 mg/ml), citrate counterion (sodium citrate; 2 mM, 3 mM or 6 mM) and isopropanol (20%). The cocktail solutions were mixed in glass vials and cooled from +20 'C to -40 °C at a freeze ramp of 1 °C per minute in a Millrock Lab Series lyophilizer. Volatiles (water and Isopropanol) were removed by sublimation at 100 mTorr with primary drying at -30 *C for 12 hours and secondary drying at 30 'C for 3 hours, leaving the dry powder containing microspheres. Results: Microsphere formation was observed at all three tested concentrations of citrate counterion. The size of the microspheres increased from 1 micron at2 mM citrate, to 3 microns at 3 mM citrate, to 5 microns at 6 mM citrate. Addition of 1 mM sodium acetate or 1 mM sodium chloride to the cocktail containing 2 mM citrate did not affect formation‘of the microspheres triggered by the citrate counterion. These results demonstrate that the size of the microparticles can be engineered as desired using an appropriate concentration of counterion. EXAMPLE 5 DAS181 microspheres formed in the presence of surfactants The addition of surfactants to macromolecular {e.g., protein) microspheres often can improve characteristics of the microspheres that render them suitable for administration to a subject, such as flowability, dispersivity and disposition for a particular route of administration, such as intranasal or oral inhalation. To test whether surfactants can be incorporated into the methods of manufacturing microspheres as provided herein, the production of DAS181 microspheres was undertaken as described in Example 1 above, except that in addition, a surfactant was added to the solution. To a cocktail solution containing 5 mg/ml DAS181,5 mM sodium citrate, and 20% iso propanol, was added a surfactant (3,5% w/w lecithin, 0.7% w/w Span-85® (sorbitan trioleate), or 3.5% w/w oleic acid). The microspheres were formed by cooling the solutions to 4 "C, followed by cooling to -20 °C, followed by freezing to -80 °C for lyophilizatlon as described above in Example 1. Upon freezing, the tubes were placed into a lyophilizer and the volatiles (water and isopropanol) were removed by sublimation, leaving the dry powder containing microspheres. Results: The microspheres resulting from treatment of each of the above cocktails as described above were spread on glass slides using cover slips rubbed In a circular motion. Efficient microsphere formation was observed in all cases. When the samples containing surfactant were compared to the sample containing all the remaining ingredients but no added surfactant, it was noted that the microspheres formed in the presence of surfactant had improved dispersivity (lesser agglomeration or aggregation). EXAMPLE 6 Preparation of microspheres of bovine serum albumin (BSA) by selection of suitable types and concentrations of organic solvents and counterions As described herein, the methods provided herein can empirically be optimized in high-throughput format to obtain microspheres having desired characteristics including size, flowabillty and dispersivity. The purpose of this experiment was to demonstrate that by varying types and concentrations of organic solvents and counterions, as well as pH of the cocktail, size and quality of microspheres of a protein of interest, in this case bovine serum albumin (8SA), can be adjusted. Cocktail solutions containing 5 mg/ml of BSA and various organic solvents and counterions at indicated pH and concentrations (see Table 1) were placed in a microtiter plate, (final volume perwell of 0.1 ml). Cocktails were cooled from +20 °C to -40 'C at a freeze ramp of 1 ,°C per minute in a Mill rack Lab Series Iyophilizer. Volatiles were removed by sublimation at 100 mTorr, with a primary drying at -30 °C for 12 hours and secondary drying at 30 "C for 3 hours. Results: The results are shown in Table 1 below. For the BSA protein, combinations (of counterion and organic solvent, respectively) that produced the most uniform microspheres with minimal crystallization or aggregation include: include: (1) citrate + isopropanol 10 (2) citrate + acetone (3) itaconic acid + 1-propanol (4) glycine + dioxane (5) glycine + 1-propanol (6) rubidium + 1-propanol 15 (7) perchlorate + 1-propanol Table 1: High-throughput screening of BSA microspheres formed under different conditions Counterion pH Organic Solvent Product description 5 αΜ pivalic acid 4.0 5% Cyclohexanol 0.5- 1 micron microspheres with occasional crystals 5 τηΜ pivalic acid 4.0 5% 1- propanol 0.5-1 micron microspheres with some aggregates 5 mM pivalic acid 4.0 5% butyl alcohol Aggregated microspheres 5 mM pivalic acid 4.0 5% p~ Dioxane Aggregated microspheres 5 mM rubidium chloride 9.0 5% Cyclohexanol 0.5-1 micron microspheres.

The combinations of reagents and conditions (counterion, organic solvent, pH, concentrations) selected from the initial screen can then further be fine-tuned as desired. EXAMPLE 7 Preparation of microspheres using a variety of proteins The methods provided herein can be used to prepare microspheres using a variety of proteins. In addition to DAS181 and BSA exemplified above, the methods were used to prepare microspheres from trypsin, hemoglobin, DNase f, tysozyme, ovalbumin, RNAse A, hexahlstidine-tagged human proteinase Inhibitor 8 (PIS, having the sequence of amino acids set forth in 8EQ iD ΝΟ:15), red fluorescent protein (RFP) and green fluorescent protein (GFP). DNase I, trypsin and hemoglobin were purchased from Worthington. Lysozyme, ovalbumin, and RNAse A were purchased from Sigma. Purification of 6xHis tagged PI8, GFP and RFP: 6xHis tagged PI8, GFP and RFP were expressed and purified essentially as described for DAS181 in Example 1 above, with the following modifications: Purification of 6xHis tagged GFP and SxHis tagged RFP: Constructs encoding Red Fluorescent protein and Green Fluorescent protein with Νterminal Hise tags were expressed in Ε. coii as 6xHis-tagged proteins. Expression of Red Fluorescent protein was allowed to proceed overnight in LB medium with 1 mM IPTG. Green Fluorescent protein was induced for 3 hour in ΤΒ medium with 1 mM IPTG. Cell lysates from 4 liters of induced cultures were clarified by centrifugation and the proteins were purified by meta) chelate affinity chromatography on Fast-Flow Chelating resin (GE Healthcare) charged with Nickel and packed into C-10 columns (GE Healthcare). The proteins were further purified by Gel Filtration Chromatography on a 0.5 cm χ 70 cm Sephacryl 200 column equilibrated with phosphate buffered saline. The proteins were dialyzed against 2 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, and concentrated on a Centriprep (Amicon). Purification of 6xHis tagged F18: A construct encoding PIB with an Νterminal Hlse lag was expressed in Ε. colies 6xHis-tagged Ρ18. Purification was performed as described for 6xHfe RFP and 6xHis GFP above, with the exception that all buffers used in the various chromatographic purification steps contained 1 mM TCEP (Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride). Preparation of microspheres: Cocktail solutions containing 5 mg/ml of protein and various counterions, organic solvents and pH as listed below were prepared in a microtiter plate as described above In Example 6.

Volatiles (water and isopropanol) were removed by sublimation at 100 mTorr with primary drying at -30 "C for 12 hours and secondary drying at 30 *C for 3 hours, leaving the dry powder containing microspheres. The dry powders were spread on glass slides and microphotography was performed through either 32χ or 100χ objective. All the combinations listed In Table 2 above produced microspheres of good quality (uniform size distribution, dispersivity, with few aggregates and/or crystals). The microspheres varied in size from about 0.4 -1 micron (RNAse A, DNAse l) to about 2-5 microns (6xHis PIS, lysozyme), depending on the protein. This example demonstrates that the methods provided herein can be used to produce microspheres from a wide variety of proteins. EXAMPLE 8 Aerodynamic particle size distribution of DAS181 microspheres for inhalation: a comparison of the methods provided herein with spray-drying As described herein, the methods provided herein can be used to produce microspheres in any desired size range, including a range of about 0.5 micron to about 6-8 microns for delivery via inhalation. A. Preparation of microspheres To test the aerodynamic particle size distribution of DAS181 dry powder (microspheres) formulated for delivery by inhalation, DAS181 microspheres were prepared using two methods as follows: (a) A DAS181 aqueous solution containing 14 mg/ml DAS181,5 mM sodium citrate, pH 5.0 was spray dried into an air stream at 55 °C, to produce microspheres. (b) Alternately, DAS181 microspheres were produced according to the methods provided herein. To a DAS181 aqueous solution containing 14 mg/ml DAS181,6 mM sodium citrate, pH 5.0, was added 5% isopropanol as organic solvent. The resulting solution was cooled from +20 °C to -40 'C at a freeze ramp of 1 °C per minute in a Millrock Lab Series lyophilizer. Volatiles (water and Isoprapanot) were removed by sublimation at 100 mTorr with primary drying at -30 “C for 12 hours and secondary drying at 30 "C for 3 hours, leaving the dry powder containing microspheres. Β. Aerodynamic particle size distribution of microspheres The mfcrospheres prepared as described in Example 8Α were tested by Andersen Cascade impaction. The deposition of pharmaceuticals in the respiratory tract can be predicted by the aerodynamic behavior of particles (microspheres) on the stages/collection plates of the cascade impactor. The cascade impaction experiment was performed using DAS181 microspheres prepared by one of the two alternate methods described in section A above, /.℮., either by spray-drying or by the methods provided herein. The microspheres (10 mg) were loaded into gelatin capsules. The gelatin capsules were placed into a CycioHaler (PharmaChemie) dry powder inhaler and subjected to cascade impaction. An 8-stage, non-viable Andersen Cascade impactor (Thermo Electron, Boston) modified for use at 90 liters per minute of airflow and equipped with a USP throat, induction cone and no preseparator, was used. The collection plates of the impactor representing various areas/stages of deposition post-inhalation (trachea, primary and secondary bronchi, terminal bronchi, alveoli, etc.) were coated with silicon spray to prevent bouncing of the microspheres. Tire microspheres from the stages and collection plates were recovered into a phosphate buffered saline containing 0-1% Tween, and the amount of deposited DAS181 recovered from each stage and collection plate was quantified by measuring absorbance at 280 nm. Results: The geometric size of microspheres produced by the two methods was assessed by light microscopy and found to be essentially identical (range of 1.5 - 3.0 microns) for both methods. As shown in Table 3 below, however, the aerodynamic particle size distribution of the two preparations differs significantly between the two methods. Forth© microspheres produced according to a method as provided herein (/.℮., method (b) as set forth in section A above), less than 25% remained trapped in the mouth (throat/cone of the impactor assembly), while greater than 70% of the microspheres were delivered to the trachea and lungs (with greater than 40% in the terminal bronchi and alveoli). In comparison, less than 50% of the DAS181 microspheres formed by spray-drying (method (a) as set forth in section A above) was delivered to the trachea and lungs (less than 20% In the terminal bronchi and alveoli). The results demonstrate that methods provided herein can produce microspheres for delivery into deep lungs, and that the micraspheres produced by methods provided herein have superior disagglomeration and -flowability properties (provide a higher delivered dose) compared to microspheres produced by a spray-drying method.

The Batch Process' described herein is suitable for the manufacture of high quality dry powder microspheres in an amount ranging from, for example, milligrams to about a kilogram and Is limited by the capacity of the mixing tank and/or lyophilizer shelf space. An alternative “continuous” process described herein can be used to manufacture amounts ranging from, for example, hundreds of grams to hundred or more kilograms (100 grams to 100 kg and above). Additional advantage of continuous process is a better control over the chilling of the cocktail. The large scale manufacture by a batch process or by a continuous process can follow, for example, one or more of the steps described below in any combination of steps or specific alternative methods: • Precipitation of protein into microspheres. This step can be performed in a batch mode by placing the cocktail solution containing the desired concentration of protein, organic solvent and counterion in lyophilization tray(s) and placing the tray(s) onto lyophilizer shelves. Alternatively, trays can be chilled and frozen on a chilled platform or other type of equipment (e.g., a freezer) and stored for a period of time frozen and lyophiiized later. Alternatively, the microspheres can be formed by precipitation in a vessel with stirring, wherein the vessel is placed onto a cold surface or a cooling coil is immersed into liquid or while the cocktail is being recirculated through a heat exchanger using a peristaltic pump. Alternatively, the microspheres can be formed by precipitation in a continuous mode, by passing the cocktail solution through a heat exchangers) once using a,peristaltic pump. • Removal of bulk liquid. The suspension of the microspheres can be concentrated using standard centrifugation, continuous flow centrifugation (e.g., CARR ViaFuge Pilot), or filtration (e.g., on glass fiber, sintered glass, polymer filters, hollow fiber cartridges (e.g., those manufactured by GE Healthcare) or tangential flow filtration cassettes (TFF cassettes, such as those manufactured by Mlllipore or Sartorius)). The removal of bulk liquid (50% or greater) can result in a faster drying cycle and higher efficiency and throughput. • Drying the microspheres. The recovered microspheres formed by any mode, can be dried by conventional lyophtlization. Alternatively, the microspheres can be dried under ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure, eliminating the use of lyophilizer. Results: DAS181 protein was successfully processed into dry powder (microspheres) by a continuous mode as described herein. Cocktail containing 10 mg/ml DAS181,20% isopropanol, 2 mM sodium sulfate was passed through 35 SERIES heat exchanger (Exergy, Garden City, NY) coupled with a NESLAB circulating cryostat using a peristaltic pump so that during the passage the cocktail was cooled from about 25flC to about -12°C. The resulting suspension of microspheres exiting the heat exchanger was pumped into a prechilled Iyophilization tray (-40 °C), frozen and lyophilized or, alternatively, pumped directly into liquid nitrogen and then lyophilized. The resulting microspheres, which were analyzed by microscopy and cascade impaction, showed uniform microspheres with minimal aggregation and good dispersivity and were similar in dimensions and aerodynamic particle size distribution to the microspheres produced by batch mode. When the formulated DAS181 cocktail solution was not chilled (not passed through heat exchanger, thus no precipitation of microspheres was induced) and poured directly into liquid nitrogen, no microspheres were observed and, instead, glass-iike crystals were observed after Iyophilization.

Production of Bulk Drug Substance The terms Drug Substance, Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient, and API are used Interchangeably In this example and refer to the DAS1S1 protein. Production of DAS181 protein In bulk was conducted as follows. First, bulk amounts of DAS181 were expressed in Ε. coli (BL21 strain) essentially as described In Example 1. The Ε. coli cells expressing the DAS181 protein were washed by diafiitration in a fermentation harvest wash step using Toyopearl buffer 1, UFP-500-E55 hollow fiber cartridge (GE Healthcare) and a Watson-Marlow peristaltic pump. The recombinant DAS181 protein was then purified in bulk from the cells. The detailed specifications of the components and buffers used in the bulk purification of DAS181 are provided in Tables 5 and 6 below. The harvested and washed cells were lysed in a homogenization step by passing the cells twice through using Niro-Soave Panda cell disruptor. The homogenate thus obtained was clarified by microfiltration using the Toyopearl buffer 1, Hydrasart 0.2 micron TFF cassette and a Watson Marlow pump. The clarified homogenate was then concentrated by allowing the lysate to recirculate without fresh buffer feed. Next, DAS181 protein was captured from the clarified homogenate an a Toyopearl SP-550C resin which was washed in a series of buffers (see Table 5) before the DAS181 protein was eluted from the resin. The sodium chloride concentration of the eluate was adjusted to 1.0 Μ in a final buffer of 50 mM phosphate at pH 8.0. The DAS181-containing eluate was then passed through a Toyopearl Hexyl-650C resin for further purification using a Toyopearl Buffer 4. The resin eluate containing DAS181 protein was then buffer-exchanged into 5 mM sodium acetate in a diafiitration step (see step 8 in Table 5). The concentrated protein was next passed through a Sartorius Q SingleSep Filter in order to remove DNA in a flow-through mode. IsopropanoJ was added to the Q SingleSep filtrate to a final concentration of 20% ν/ν. The DAS181 protein in the buffer was passed through an Amberchrome CG300M resin equilibrated with an Amberchrom buffer (see step 11 in Table 5). The purified bulk DAS181 protein was then buffer-exchanged into formulation buffer and concentrated by diafiitration (see step 12 of Table 5).

Batch Manufacturing Process The Ingredients set forth in Table 4 above were combined to form DAS'!81 microspheres In a large scale batch process as described below. step 1: Thawing of bulk Drug Substance Frozen 0.2 pm-filtered bulk Drug Substance in plastic bottles was thawed overnight at ambient temperature (25±3 °C). Step II: Weighing of the excipients and preparation of solutions 35.51 g of Sodium Sulfate anhydrous powder was weighed and Q.S. to 500 mL with Water For Irrigation, then stirred to obtain a dear solution. 18.38 g of Calcium Chloride dihydrate powder was weighed and Q.S. to 250 mL with Water For Irrigation, then stirred to obtain a dear solution. Step HI: Preparation of die DAS181 cocktail solution To 3.3 L of concentrated Drug Substance (19.55 g/L), 1,79 L of Water For irrigation was added slowly with stirring, followed by 0.0215 L of Sodium SuEfate solution, 0.0028 L of Calcium Chloride solution and 0,269 L of isopropanol. The solution was stirred to ensure complete mixing of components. Step IV: Filtration of formulated cocktail solution through 0.2 urn filter The formulated cocktail solution of Step III was filtered through a 0.2 pm filter into sterile media bags to control particulates and btoburden. Step V: Filling Into ivoahilizatlon travs The formulated filtered solution was dispensed into autoclaved Lyoguard lyophitization trays. To ensure even cooling of the solution and formation of high quality microspheres, 6 trays were each filled with 0.9 L or less of cocktail solution. Step VI: Freezing and Ivonhilixatinn The trays were placed onto lyophilizer {Hull 120FSX200) shelves prechilled to -45 ± 5 °C and the solution was allowed to chill and freeze. Formation of microspheres occurred while the solution was being frozen. The freezing is allowed to proceed for 1-2 h to ensure complete solidification. The product temperature was verified by reading the thermocouples attached to two of the six trays. The lyophilization cycle steps are as follows: a) Set vacuum to 160 microns and allow to evacuate to 100 - 200 microns; b) Ramp shelf temperature to +10 °C over 3 h; c) Hold shelf temperature at +10 °C for 36 h {primary drying); d) Thermocouple traces examined to verily that primary drying phase is completed and the product temperature has stabilized at +10°C ± 5eC for 15-30 h. e) Ramp shelf temperature to +3CTC over 1 h and hold for 3-5 h (secondary drying). Step VII: Transfer of bulk DAS181 microsnheres into container arid mixing A section on the bottom film of each Lyoguard lyophilization tray was cleaned using sanitizing wipes and a 3 χ 3 cm opening was made with a scaipel. The dry microspheres were transferred into a plastic bottle. The bottle was capped and tumbled forty times, changing directions with each inversion. The tumbling was to ensure uniformity of bottle content Samples for analytical testing were taken and the bottle was recapped and sealed into plastic bags for storage. In the DAS181 microsphere bulk manufacturing process as described above, sulfate was demonstrated to be a safe substance for use as a counterion, and reproducibly produced microspheres with a narrow size distribution. Further, the organic solvent isopropanoi was a good solvent of choice because (1) it is a class 3 solvent, (2) it can produce microspheres in a wide range (2 - 30%, ν/ν) of concentrations, and (3) it has a relatively high freezing point so its vapors can efficiently be trapped during iyophilization. The protein concentration in the final formulation could be varied (10 14 mg/ml), as could the concentration of counterion (1-5 mM) and isopropanol (2 - 30% ν/ν), without substantial impact on the physical properties of the microspheres or the activity of the DAS181 protein in the microspheres. At higher concentrations of isopropanol (15 - 30%), the mtcrospheres formed while the cocktail was still tiilly liquid. At lower concentrations (2 -15%), ice crystals began to form first, followed by precipitation to form microspheres. C. Yie Id of DAS131 in the microspheres The theoretfcaf yield of DAS181 in the dry microspheres is calculated according to the following formula: Theoretical yield = DAS181 protein, g * protein fraction in Dry Powder {microspheres) The protein fraction value (0.866) was established empirically by analysis of several manufactured batches of DAS181 microspheres. The theoretical yield for the amounts as set forth in Table 2 is 64.56 g + 0.866 = 74.55 g. The actual yield of DAS181 Dry Powder was found to be 64 g. Results: The suitability of the microspheres prepared as described in section Β above for administration by oral inhalation was tested by Andersen Cascade Impaction. Hie results are summarized In Table 7 below. The deposition of pharmaceuticals in the respiratory tract can be predicted by deposition of particles (microspheres) on the stages/collection plates of the cascade impactor. Fora pharmaceutical, e.g., DAS181 microspheres, that is administered to prevent or treat viral infections that Initiate in the respiratory tract, such as influenza, it is desirable to deposit the pharmaceutical in the throat, trachea and bronchi (upper and central respiratory airways). The DAS181 fusion protein delivered to upper and central respiratory airways cleaves off the receptor sialic acids from mucous membranes, thus preventing viral binding and infection at these sites. For optimal delivery of the DAS181 microspheres to sites where respiratory viral infection can be initiated, i.e., in the throat trachea or bronchi, the microspheres must not be (a) so big that they are trapped at the front end in the mouth (i.e., micraspheres are too big, about 8 microns or greater); or (b) bo small that they are deposited in deep lungs and absorbed systemIcally into the blood stream (i.e., 0.5 microns or smaller). For delivery of the DAS181 microspheres to the throat, trachea and • bronchi, a size range of about 1 micron to about 5.5 - 6 microns generally is suitable. DAS181 micnospheres manufactured as described above were characterized by Andersen cascade impaction and found to be suitable for delivery to upper and central respiratory airways with sufficiently low percentage (<5%) deposited in the alveoli.

Scanning Electron Microscopy (FEI Quanta 200 Scanning Electron Microscope, Everhart Thornley (ΕΤ) detector) of.the DAS181 microspheres prepared according to the method described in this Example revealed that the microspheres are present as agglomerates of hundreds and thousands of iindividual particles approximately 0.5 -3 micron in size. The agglomerates however are easily dissipated by air turbulence produced during the actuation through dry powder inha!er (as demonstrated by Andersen Cascade Impaction or laser diffraction). Light microscopy of microspheres dispersed in a liquid surfactant (e.g. Τriton X-100 or Tween 20) or non-polar solvent (e.g., alcohol, acetone, or acetonitrile) that does not dissolve the microspheres, confirmed that aggregates are easily dissipated Into individual uniform microspheres. EXAMPLE 11 Preparation of DAS1S1 microspheres using sulfates other than the sodium salt Studies have shown that in certain instances, e.g., In some asthmatics, the presence pf sodium in formulations for pulmonary administration could carry a risk of Inducing airway hyperresponsiveness (Agrawal at al, Lung, 183;375-387 (2005)). This example therefore tested alternate salts, such as salts of other metals such as potassium, magnesium and calcium. DAS181 microspheres were manufactured as described above in Example 1. Cocktail solutions containihg 12 mg/mL DAS181 and 5% (ν/ν) isopropanoS contained as counterions the indicated sulfates at 2 mM concentration, pH 4.5 - 5.0. The microspheres were formed by cooling the solutions from +25 °C to -45 °C. Upon freezing, the volatiles (water and isopropanol) were removed by sublimation, leaving the dry powder containing microspheres. The aerodynamic particle size distribution of the dry powder was assessed by Andersen Cascade Impaction, and the amount of DAS181 per stage was determined by UV measurement at 226 nm (Α226). The results are shown below in Table 8. The results demonstrate that sulfate salts otherthan the sodium salt can be used as counterion to obtain DAS181 microspheres of a size range such that the majority are delivered to the throat, trachea and bronchi, in an amount that is comparable to the amount delivered when sodium sulfate is used as the counterion.

The relative activity compared to non-Iyophilized DAS181 microspheres stored at 80 °C is shown in Table 9. The results show that the stability of the microspheres prepared using the various metal sulfates as counterions were ’ comparable to that of sodium sulfate, with retention of almost all or all the activity for over 2-months at-37 °C and -retention of almost all (sodium and :· potassium sulfates) or- over 85% [magnesium and zinc sulfates) of the activity . for over 10 days at 53 °C This experiment demonstrates that various ησηsodium containing counterions can produce microspheres with desirable characteristics.

The production of dry DAS181 microspheres was undertaken in a cocktail solution containing 10 mg/mL DAS181,2 mM sodium sulfate, 5% ν/ν isopropanol. To some solutions, 0.01% w/v sugar (sorbitol, mannitol, trehalose or sucrose) was added. The mfcrospheres were formed by cooling the solutions from +25 °C to -45 eC. Upon freezing, the volatiles (water and isopfopanol) were removed by sublimation, leaving the dry powders containing microspheres. A.

Stability of DAS1S1 microspheres formulated with sugars The sialldase activity of DAS181 in the dry powder microsphere formulations containing sugars and in the unlyophilized microsphere formulations stored at -80 eC, were measured using fluorescent substrate 4-MU-NANA as described in Example 1 and as incorporated by reference herein. The dry powder formulations containing no sugar or various sugars as indicated below ΐπ Table 12 were stored at +42 "C for 4 weeks (forced degradation). The results are shown in Table 12. Relative to unlyophilized formulations stored at -80 “C, the formulation containing no sugar retained almost 80% of its activity. The addition of various sugars increase the stability so that about 88-98% of the activity is retained, depending on the sugar.
