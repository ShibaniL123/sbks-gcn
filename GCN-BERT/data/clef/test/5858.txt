AUSTRALIA Patents Act 1990 Complete Specification Standard Patent PORTABLE SEQUENTIAL COMPRESSION DEVICE The following statement is a full description of this invention, including the best method of performing it known to me: Background Field of the Invention [0001] The present invention relates generally to compression devices and, more specifically, to a portable sequential compression device mountable to an appendage designed to facilitate blood circulation through the appendage veins of users that remain sedentary whether bed ridden or sitting for extended periods of time whereby the normal blood flow induced by expansion and contraction of the muscles doesn't occur, which can lead to thrombi and edema within the appendage. [0002] The device comprises a portable pump and a series of bladders transversely encircling the target appendage whether arm or leg that through, the intermittent compression aids blood flow across the capillaries. [0003] The number of bladders arrayed transversely is a design consideration and can be greater than or less than that illustrated in the figures. Description of the Related Art [0004] There are other compression devices designed for compression. While these compression devices may be suitable for the purposes for which they were designed, they would not be as suitable for the purposes of the present invention, as hereinafter described. Summary Of The Invention [0005] It A primary object of the present invention is to provide a portable sequential compression device for appendages. [0006] Another object of the present invention is to provide a portable sequential compression device for appendages comprising a control unit and a compression sleeve. [0007] Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a portable sequential compression device wherein said compression sleeve has a plurality of transverse bladders with mating longitudinal fasteners on each side. [0008] Still yet another object of the present invention is to provide a portable sequential compression device wherein each of said bladders has a value for inflating and a valve for deflating the bladder. [0009] Another object of the present invention is to provide a pump having housing with circuit for actuating said pump using AC or DC current. [0010] Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a pump having switches for setting the amount of pressure for the bladders. [0011] Still yet another object of the present invention is to provide a pump having switches for setting the duration of treatment. [0012] An additional object of the present invention is to provide the pump housing with audio and/or visual indicator that treatment is complete. [0013] Additional objects of the present invention will appear as the description proceeds. [0014] The present invention overcomes the shortcomings of the prior art by providing a portable sequential compression device mountable to an appendage designed to facilitate blood circulation through the appendage veins of users that remain sedentary whether bed ridden or sitting for extended periods of time whereby the normal blood flow induced by expansion and contraction of the muscles doesn't occur, which can lead to thrombi and edema within the appendage. The device comprises a portable pump and a series of bladders transversely encircling the target appendage whether arm or leg that through, the intermittent compression aids blood flow across the capillaries. The number of bladders arrayed transversely is a design consideration and can be greater than or less than that illustrated in the figures. [0015] The foregoing and other objects and advantages will appear from the description to follow. In the description reference is made to the accompanying drawings, which forms a part hereof, and in which is shown by way of illustration specific embodiments in which the invention may be practiced.

This discussion should not be construed, however, as limiting the invention to those particular embodiments, practitioners skilled in the art will recognize numerous other embodiments as well. For definition of the complete scope of the invention, the reader is directed to appended claims. [0031] FIG. 1 is an illustrative view of the portable sequential compression device 10 in use. The portable sequential compression device, illustrated encompassing a user's 12 leg, is a device mountable to an appendage 16 for moving blood through the appendage veins of users that remain sedentary whether bed ridden or sitting for extended periods of time whereby the normal blood flow induced by expansion and contraction of the muscles doesn't occur, which can lead to thrombi and edema within the appendage. [0032] FIG. 2 is another illustrative view of the portable sequential compression device 10 in use. Illustrated is the portable sequential compression device 10 designed to facilitate blood circulation back to the heart through sequential inflation and deflation of a series of bladders 14 transversely encircling the target appendage 16. Illustrated is the device attached to a user's 12 arm to prevent venous blood stasis and through the intermittent compression aid blood flow across the capillaries. The number of bladders 14 arrayed transversely is a design consideration and can be greater than or less than that illustrated in the figures. [0033] FIG. 3 is an illustrative view of the portable sequential compression device 10. The portable sequential compression device provides a sequential compression sleeve 18, a control unit 20 and a conduit 30 communicating therebetween. The compression sleeve 18 comprises a plurality of transverse bladders 14 and longitudinal mating fastener 22 for securing the compression sleeve 18 to an appendage. The control unit 20 has a housing 24 for an air compression pump 26 with external switches 28 for actuating the pump. [0034] FIG. 4 is a diagrammatic view of the present invention 10. Shown is the portable sequential compression device 10 having a plurality of bladders 14 with fill valves 32 and bleed valves 34 for applying a preselected amount of pressure to an appendage within the compression sleeve 18. A power source 36 supplies power to the circuit 38 and the pump 26 that fills the bladders 14. [0035] FIG. 5 is a closed view of the compression sleeve 18 of the present invention 10. It is envisioned that a varying number of bladders 14 can be contained within the compression sleeve 18, such as small medium or large. [0036] FIG. 6 is an open view of the compression sleeve 18 of the present invention 10. As aforementioned, it is envisioned that a varying number of bladders 14 can be contained within the compression sleeve 18, such as small medium or large having mating longitudinal fasteners 22 along the opposing edges. [0037] FIG. 7 is a sectional view of the bladders 14 of the present invention 10. Shown is a sectional view of the individual bladders 14 in the compression sleeve 18. Each bladder 14 has a fill valve and bleed valve that are used to control the amount of pressure within the bladder 14 and the bleed time of the bladder 14. [0038] FIG. 8 is a chart of the portable sequential compression device 10. [0039] The present invention 10 provides for a portable pump having controls for filling and bleeding a plurality of bladders in a predetermined sequence to force blood circulation from the vein to the heart. The control can additionally provide for psi selection, bladder cycle time and sleeve cycle time. [0040] FIG. 9 is a front and side view of the pump controller unit 20 of the present invention 10. The portable pump provides fastener 40 for attaching to an article of apparel and control switches 28 for selecting the amount of bladder pressure, bladder cycle time and treatment time that when expired may include an audio 42 or visual indicator 44 that treatment is completed. [0041] FIG. 10 is a back view of the pump controller unit 20 of the present invention 10. The portable pump also provides for rechargeable batteries 48 and a wall socket cord 46 to either recharge the batteries or run the device using ac current. [0042] FIG. 11 is the portable sequential compression device 10 having an additional element. The present invention 10 further provides for an embodiment of the present invention having the previously disclosed appendage transverse compression and as illustrated a plurality of longitudinal bladders 50 that can be used in concert with the transverse pressure or in lieu of transverse compression. [0043] It will be understood that each of the elements described above, or two or more together may also find a useful application in other types of methods differing from the type described above.
