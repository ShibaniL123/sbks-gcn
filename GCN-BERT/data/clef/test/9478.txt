Hal denotes F, Cl, Br, I and n is 1, 2 or 3 and pharmaceutically usable derivatives, solvates, salts and stereoisomers thereof, including mixtures thereof in all ratios.Preferably, the compounds of formula I show activity as vanin inhibitors. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The term “vanin inhibitor” is preferably defined herein as a compound which, in vitro and/or in vivo: (i) inhibits the activity and/or expression of Vanin-1; and/or (ii) blocks processing of pantetheine into cysteamine and pantothenic acid; and/or (iii) blocks intracellular synthesis of cysteamine and/or of cystamine, the oxidized form of cysteamine. Inhibition and blocking may be total or partial. Vanin-1 and Vanin-3, preferentially expressed by epithelial and myeloid cells, respectively (Martin, 2001). In human and drosophila, this enzyme is encoded by 3 genes (VNN-1, VNN-2, VNN-3). In mouse and human, Vanin-1 and VNN1, respectively, are GPI-anchored to cell membranes and are highly expressed at the brush border of various epithelial cells including intestinal enterocytes, kidney tubular cells, hepatocytes, pancreatic acinar cells, thymic medullary epithelial cells (Galland, 1998; Aurrand-Lions, 1996; Pitari, 2000; Martin, 2001). In drosophila, 4 genes homologous to the mammalian Vanin sequences are identified and preliminary studies show that drosophila has a pantetheinase activity (Granjeaud et al, 1999). Vanin-1 deficient mice develop normally but have no detectable free cyst(e)amine in kidney and liver, in spite of the presence of Vanin-3 (Pitari, 2000). Inactivation of the Vanin-1 gene prevents acute and chronic inflammation since in both cases intestinal injury was moderate in Vanin-1 deficient mice, as compared to controls. The protection was associated with reduced expression of inflammatory molecules, myeloid cell recruitment and mucosal damage in the intestine. Furthermore, glutathione synthesis and storage were increased in liver and intestine (US 2004/0247524). These events were further shown to be associated with the lack of free cysteamine/cystamine, which is undetectable in Vanin-1 deficient mice, since cystamine given orally reversed the inflammatory phenotype. This reverting effect was correlated with inhibition of glutathion synthesis in vivo. Thus, the compounds of formula I, which show pronounced activity as vanin inhibitors, are useful for the treatment of inflammatory disorders. As used herein, “inflammatory disorder” denotes a condition of sustained or chronic inflammation that occurs when tissues are injured by viruses, bacteria, trauma, chemicals, heat, cold or any other harmful stimulus. Preferably, an inflammatory disorder according to the invention is a gastrointestinal inflammatory disorder that may be selected from the group consisting of an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) such as Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, an ulcer resulting from administration of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, such as a peptic ulcer (i.e. a sore that forms in the lining of the stomach or the duodenum), and an inflammatory disorder associated with an infection with Schistosoma mansoni parasite. The term “treating” or “treatment” is meant the prophylactic or curative treatment of a disorder, i.e. reversing, alleviating, inhibiting the progress of, or preventing the disorder or condition to which such term applies, or one or more symptoms of such disorder or condition. The treatment may be associated with another pre-existing treatment in order to improve the efficacy of said pre-existing treatment.

Vanin-1 Enzymatic Assay: Human recombinant Vanin-1 (VNN1) was purchased from Sino Biological Inc. (Catalog Number: 11662-H08H). Measurement of VNN1 inhibition is performed in 384 well format based on fluorescence intensity assay. Purified recombinant human Vanin-1 (0.5 nM) and threefold serial diluted compounds in 3% DMSO (range of concentrations from 30 μM to 1.524 nM) or controls (3.0% DMSO) are incubated for 30 minutes at 30° C. with gentle agitation in assay buffer containing 100 mM potassium Phosphate Buffer (KPi) pH 7.5, 0.001% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA), 0.5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and 0.0025% Brij-35. The reaction is initiated by the addition of the fluorogenic substrate, Pantothenate-AMC, at a concentration of 30 μM. After 60 minutes of incubation at 30° C. with gentle agitation, fluorescence intensity is measured at λex=350 nm and λem=450 nm with a fluorescence reader (BMG Pherastar reader or equivalent). Vanin-1 Cell-Based Mechanistic Assay: The cellular activity of the examples was measured in 96 well format based on fluorescence intensity assay using SUIT-S2 cell line (ATCC # CRL1596) Cells are cultured at 37° C. with 5% CO2 to 80-90% confluence and then washed once with Phosphate Buffer Saline (PBS). Adherent cells are detached with PBS-EDTA and once in suspension 40000 cells are dispensed in 90 μl of PBS in 96-well black plates with clear bottom. Three fold serial dilutions of test compounds are made in DMSO and the solubilized in PBS, dilution range 1:30. Cells and serial diluted test compounds (final concentrations 10 μM to 4.6 nM) or controls (PBS/0.3% DMSO) are incubated for 2 hours at 37° C. with 5% CO2. The reaction is initiated by the addition of the fluorogenic substrate, Pantothenate-AMC, at a concentration of 30 μM. After 30 minutes of incubation at 30° C. with gentle agitation, fluorescence intensity is measured at λex=350 nm and λem=450 nm with a fluorescence reader (BMG Pherastar reader or equivalent). 1-12.
