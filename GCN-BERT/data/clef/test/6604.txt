RELATED APPLICATIONS The present application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. §119 to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61/985,022, which was filed on Apr. 28, 2014, and U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 62/040,047, which was filed on Aug. 21, 2014. The complete disclosures of the above-identified patent applications are hereby incorporated by reference. FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE The present disclosure relates to footwear and footwear accessories, and more particularly to footwear and footwear accessories with magnetic components that selectively secure the shell of the footwear around a wearer's foot. BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE Many styles of traditional footwear, including casual and athletic footwear, include adjustable fasteners for selectively adjusting the size of the foot compartment defined by the footwear's sole and shell, and thereby adjusting the degree to which the footwear is secured around a wearer's foot and/or configured to permit ready insertion or removal of a wearer's foot into/from the foot compartment. Examples of commonly used adjustable fasteners are laces, buckles, zippers, and hook-and-loop straps. While such adjustable fastening mechanisms provide a mechanism for the wearer to selectively adjust the “fit” of the footwear to suit the wearer's current preferences, they typically require manual manipulation, such as by the wearer or another person, to secure/tighten and/or release/loosen the fastener and thereby select and/or restrict the size of the footwear's foot compartment. This contrasts with loafers, slippers, and other slip-on footwear that typically do not include such adjustable fasteners and thus are designed to be donned and removed without requiring use of the wearer's hands. However, such slip-on footwear typically provides a much looser fit, namely, a foot compartment that is only loosely secured around the wearer's foot and/or which does not extend around the heel portion of the wearer's foot. Some wearers of footwear with laces or similar conventional adjustable fasteners may not be able to and/or want to manually manipulate the fasteners to don and/or remove the footwear. For example, a wearer may lack the physical and/or mental ability to provide the required manual manipulation. Other wearers simply may not want to exert the time or effort to do so. With conventional footwear with adjustable fasteners, the primary solution is simply to maintain the fastener in a released, or loosened, configuration that defines a foot compartment that is oversized relative to the wearer's foot, and thereby does not securely fit around the wearer's foot. SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE Magnetic footwear, magnetic footwear fasteners, magnetic couplers, and methods of utilizing the same are disclosed herein. A magnetic footwear fastener includes a pair of magnetic couplers that are selectively (magnetically) coupled together by the magnetic attraction between the magnetic couplers. The magnetic footwear fasteners may be utilized with footwear to selectively secure the footwear in a closed, or sized, configuration around a wearer's foot when the magnetic coupling regions of the pair of magnetic couplers are magnetically coupled together. The magnetic couplers also include mechanical coupling regions that are configured to be attached to footwear, either in a temporary or permanent manner. When the magnetic couplers are temporarily, or removably, coupled to the footwear, the magnetic footwear fastener may be described as a magnetic footwear accessory. The mechanical coupling region of each magnetic coupler of a magnetic footwear accessory may include one or more coupler eyelets through which the footwear's lace extends. When the magnetic couplers are permanently coupled to the footwear, the mechanical coupling regions thereof may be integrated into the shell or other upper region of the footwear.

DESCRIPTION FIGS. 1-24 provide examples of magnetic footwear 10, magnetic footwear fasteners 60, magnetic couplers 62, and methods of using the same according to the present disclosure. Elements that serve a similar, or at least substantially similar, purpose are labeled with like numbers in each of FIGS. 1-24, and these elements may not be discussed in detail herein with reference to each of FIGS. 1-24. Similarly, all elements may not be labeled in each of FIGS. 1-24, but reference numerals associated therewith may be utilized herein for consistency. Elements, components, and/or features that are discussed herein with reference to one or more of FIGS. 1-24 may be included in and/or utilized with any of FIGS. 1-24 without departing from the scope of the present disclosure. As schematically illustrated in FIG. 1 in solid lines, a magnetic footwear fastener 60 according to the present disclosure includes a pair of magnetic couplers 62 that are selectively magnetically coupled together by the magnetic attraction between the magnetic couplers. Magnetic footwear fastener 60 additionally or alternatively may be referred to herein as a magnetic fastener 60, a footwear fastener 60, a magnetic assembly 60, a magnetic coupling 60, a magnetic coupling assembly 60, and/or simply as a fastener 60. Each magnetic coupler 62 may additionally or alternatively be referred to as a magnetic member 62 and/or as a magnetic fastener member 62. Magnetic footwear fastener 60 is configured to be utilized with footwear 10. When utilized with a magnetic footwear fastener 60, footwear 10 may additionally or alternatively be referred to as magnetic footwear 10. Footwear 10 additionally or alternatively be referred to as an article of footwear 10 and/or a footwear article 10, and thus the term “footwear” may refer to an individual article of footwear, such as a shoe. Magnetic footwear 10 is schematically illustrated in FIG. 1 in dash-dot lines. Magnetic footwear fastener 60 is utilized to selectively and magnetically secure the footwear in a closed, or sized, configuration around a wearer's foot. The sized configuration of footwear 10 additionally or alternatively may be referred to as a coupled configuration and/or a closed configuration, and the unsized configuration of footwear 10 additionally or alternatively may be referred to as an uncoupled configuration and/or an open configuration. More specifically, the corresponding magnetic couplers 62 of a magnetic footwear fastener 60 are configured to be magnetically secured together to define a coupled, or sized, configuration of the footwear 10 with which the magnetic footwear fastener is utilized, such as by defining a size of the footwear's foot opening and/or foot compartment. Additionally or alternatively, in the coupled configuration of footwear 10, the magnetic couplers 62 of the magnetic footwear fastener 60 may be described as restricting enlargement of the footwear's foot opening and/or foot compartment. Furthermore, when the magnetic couplers are separated or otherwise uncoupled from each other, the magnetic footwear fastener permits the footwear to be reconfigured to an open, or loosened, configuration in which the wearer's foot may be readily removed from the footwear, and subsequently reinserted therein when the wearer next desires to wear the footwear. As such, the magnetic footwear fastener 60 may permit the footwear's foot opening and foot compartment to be quickly and repeatedly returned to a preselected or predefined size. The utilization of magnetic footwear fasteners 60 with, and optional partial or complete integration of magnetic footwear fasteners 60 into, footwear 10 according to the present disclosure is discussed in more detail herein. As generally indicated in FIG. 1, footwear 10 generally includes a sole 20 and a shell, or upper, 22. The shell and the sole define a foot compartment 24 that is sized to receive a wearer's foot when the footwear is worn. The foot compartment may be described as including a forefoot region 26, a midfoot region 28, and a heel region 30, with these regions generally corresponding to respective forefoot, midfoot, and heel portions, or regions, of a wearer's foot when it is received within and operatively positioned within the foot compartment. When so received within the foot compartment, a wearer's foot generally is positioned on and/or above the sole, and the shell extends at least substantially, if not completely, around the sides and top portion of the wearer's foot. The shell defines a foot opening 32, through which a wearer's foot passes when the wearer's foot is inserted into the footwear's foot compartment, and through which the user's ankle or lower leg extends when the footwear is worn. In some embodiments, footwear 10 includes a channel 34 that extends from the foot compartment, along at least a portion of the midfoot region, and toward the forefoot region 26 of the footwear. The length and width of channel 34 may vary within the scope of the present disclosure. For example, in some embodiments, channel 34 may take the form of a narrow slit between adjacent, or even overlapping, edges 35 of vamp portions 37 of the footwear's upper. In other embodiments, channel 34 may be much wider, with the channel defining an opening, or passage, that extends above a substantial portion of the top of the wearer's foot when the footwear is worn. In such a configuration, edges 35 are spaced farther away from each other, and footwear 10 typically will include a tongue 36 that extends between the edges. In some embodiments, footwear 10 further includes a tongue 36, which extends within and/or spans channel 34. Although many conventional footwear tongues 36 extend beneath such a channel in conventional footwear, it is within the scope of the present disclosure that tongue 36 additionally or alternatively may extend within channel 34 and/or above channel 34. As used herein, a tongue 36 that extends above channel 34 additionally or alternatively may be referred to as a cap 36, a cover 36, an upper cap 36, an upper cover 36, a vamp cap 36, and/or a vamp cover 36. When present, tongue 36 may be fixedly coupled to the shell 22 of the footwear, such as within forefoot region 26. For example, tongue 36 may be stitched to the shell, with the tongue extending from the forefoot region to the foot opening 32 within the foot compartment 24 and beneath, within, and/or above channel 34. Footwear 10 may further include a plurality of footwear eyelets 38, such as which may extend on generally opposed lateral sides of channel 34, and at least one lace 46 that is selectively passed through the footwear eyelets to assist in securing the footwear in a sized configuration. Footwear 10 that includes footwear eyelets 38 and lace 46 may be described as laced footwear 12. Unless specifically set forth herein, laced footwear 12 may include the same components and/or features as other footwear 10 that is illustrated and/or described herein. As discussed, magnetic footwear fasteners 60 facilitate donning and/or removal of footwear 10. For example, when donning footwear 10, the magnetic footwear fastener 60 may permit the footwear to be quickly and repeatedly secured in a preselected coupled configuration without requiring tying of laces, buckling of buckles, etc. Instead, the footwear may be secured in the coupled configuration simply by the magnetic engagement of the magnetic couplers 62. Furthermore, the removal of a wearer's foot from footwear 10 may be performed by a wearer in a hands-free manner, that is, without requiring the wearer to use his/her hands to engage the footwear, such as to untie a lace, to unbuckle a buckle, and/or otherwise manually manipulate the footwear or a fastener thereof. For example, footwear 10 with at least one magnetic footwear fastener 60 according to the present disclosure may be configured to be removed from a wearer's foot by flexing the wearer's foot so that the wearer's foot causes at least one pair of magnetic couplers 62 to become uncoupled and thereby permit a portion of the footwear's upper, such as a tongue, cap, or flaps, to pivot to increase the size of the footwear's foot opening. Thus, the force exerted by the wearer's foot during this flexing motion may configure the footwear to an open, or uncoupled, configuration. An example of a suitable flexing motion is plantar flexing of the wearer's foot, in which the wearer's foot is flexed to extend the wearer's toes away from the wearer's leg. In some circumstances, a wearer may use his/her other foot to engage the heel of the footwear while the wearer flexes his/her foot to remove it from the footwear, with the other foot effectively restricting pivoting of the footwear, for example, so that the flexing action does not significantly lift the footwear's heel off the ground. Additionally or alternatively, a wearer may choose to use the wearer's hands to manually uncouple the magnetic couplers and pivot the footwear's tongue or other upper structure to increase the size of the footwear's foot opening and/or foot compartment for removal (and/or (re)insertion) of the wearer's foot. As discussed in more detail herein, such as in connection with FIGS. 2-12, the magnetic footwear fasteners 60 may be utilized as magnetic accessories 64 for laced footwear, namely, footwear with a plurality of footwear eyelets that conventionally receive a lace that is selectively tightened and tied to secure the lace in a tightened configuration, and which are selectively untied and loosened to configure the footwear to an untied, or loosened, configuration. In such a configuration, the magnetic accessories 64 may be utilized to permit repeated coupling of the footwear to a tightened, or sized, configuration without requiring the repeated tightening, tying, untying, and/or loosening of the footwear's lace. The magnetic accessories 64 may further permit hands-free uncoupling of the magnetic accessories to configure the footwear to a loosened, or unsized, configuration. Alternatively, at least one, if not both, magnetic coupler(s) 62 of a magnetic footwear fastener 60 may be integrated into the footwear 10, such as into the footwear's shell, vamp, tongue, or other upper portion. In such an implementation, the magnetic coupler(s) 62 may be referred to as an integrated magnetic coupler. As used herein, an “integrated” magnetic coupler cannot be removed from the footwear without damage to or destruction of a portion of the footwear, the magnetic coupler, or structure that mechanically secures the magnetic coupler to the footwear. As discussed in more detail herein, such as in connection with FIGS. 16 and 18-24, when both magnetic couplers 62 are integrated into footwear 10, the magnetic footwear fastener 60 may be referred to as an integrated magnetic footwear fastener 66. As also discussed in more detail herein, such as in connection with FIGS. 16-17, when only one of the magnetic couplers 62 of a magnetic footwear fastener 60 is integrated into footwear 10, the magnetic footwear fastener may be referred to as a partially integrated magnetic footwear fastener 68. At least when the magnetic footwear fastener 60 is an integrated magnetic footwear fastener 68, footwear 10 may or may not include footwear eyelets and/or a lace, although the footwear still may include a foot compartment sizing mechanism that is selectively utilized to adjust the size of the footwear's foot compartment. Returning to the schematic representation of magnetic footwear fastener 60 of FIG. 1, it can be seen that magnetic footwear fastener 60 includes at least one magnet 72, optionally may include a plurality of magnets 72, and further optionally may include a magnetic material 74. As used herein, a magnetic material 74 refers to a material that is attracted (magnetically) to magnet 72. Magnetic material 74 may include an iron-containing and/or ferromagnetic material (e.g., a magnetic material that is not permanently magnetized). At least one of the magnetic couplers 62 of each magnetic footwear fastener 60 must include a magnet 72. For example, both magnetic couplers 62 of a magnetic footwear fastener 60 may include at least one magnet 72 disposed to attract the magnet 72 of the complementary (mating) magnetic coupler of the magnetic footwear fastener. As another example, one magnetic coupler 62 may include at least one magnet 72, and the other (mating and/or complementary) magnetic coupler 62 of the magnetic footwear fastener 60 may include a magnetic material 74. Magnets 72 may be discrete magnets, sheet magnets, bar magnets, programmed or correlated magnets (such as which include an ordered series or group of discrete magnetic dipoles), a Halbach (or Halbach-like) array of magnets, an array of magnets oriented to provide a directed magnetic field and/or directed magnetic flux, or any suitable magnet configuration or assembly. When both magnetic couplers 62 include at least one magnet 72, each magnetic coupler may include the same number, type, and/or array of magnets, with magnets of the pair of magnetic couplers being arranged to be complementary to each other, namely, to draw the magnetic coupling surfaces of the magnetic couplers together (as opposed to repelling or otherwise urging the magnetic coupling surfaces away from each other). Each magnetic coupler 62 includes a coupler body, or housing, 70, with the respective magnets 72 and/or magnetic material 74 being secured to or within the body or forming at least a portion of the body. For example, the body 70 of each magnetic coupler may define a cavity, or internal compartment, 76 within which the respective magnets 72 and/or magnetic material 74 are located. Cavity 76 additionally or alternatively may be referred to as a magnet compartment 76, channel 76, magnet-receiving socket 76, and/or magnet receptacle 76. It is within the scope of the present disclosure that coupler body 70 may define more than one magnet cavity 76, with each cavity having a distinct magnet and/or magnetic material position therein. As a further example, magnet(s) 72 and/or magnetic material 74 may be secured to, form at least a portion of, and/or project from the exterior 78 of the coupler body 70. Magnetic couplers 62 according to the present disclosure include and/or define at least one coupling region 88. By this it is meant that magnetic couplers 62 have a region that is configured to be magnetically coupled to the corresponding coupling region of a corresponding magnetic coupler when a magnetic footwear fastener 60 is in its coupled configuration. In general, the coupling region 88 is a region of each magnetic coupler 62 that is configured to provide a strong, and perhaps the strongest, magnetic attraction with the coupling region of a corresponding magnetic coupler 62 of a magnetic footwear fastener 60. As examples, the strength of the magnetic attraction (i.e., the strength of the magnetic bond) between the coupling regions 88 of the magnetic couplers 62 of a magnetic footwear fastener 60, when in the coupled configuration may be at least 50%, at least 75%, at least 90%, or at least 100% stronger than the strength of a magnetic attraction between other portions of the magnetic couplers if such other portions are placed in physical contact with each other. The coupling region 88 may include a coupling surface 90, with the coupling surfaces 90 of the magnetic couplers of a magnetic footwear fastener 60 being sized and/or shaped to correspond to each other to promote a secure magnetic bond between the surfaces. It follows then that when these coupling surfaces are magnetically coupled together, the magnetic couplers will be connected firmly together. Coupling region 88 additionally or alternatively may be referred to as a mating region 88, and coupling surface 90 additionally or alternatively may be referred to as a mating surface 90. Magnetic coupling surface 90 additionally or alternatively may be or form a portion of the exterior surface of the body 70 of the magnetic coupler, and thus magnetic coupling surface 90 further additionally or alternatively may be referred to as an exterior, or external, magnetic coupling surface 90. Magnetic footwear fasteners 60 may be described as being coupled or secured when the corresponding mating regions and/or magnetic coupling surfaces of the fastener's pair of magnetic couplers 62 are magnetically secured together. Magnetic footwear fasteners 60 may be described as being uncoupled or unsecured when the corresponding mating regions and/or magnetic coupling surfaces of the fastener's pair of magnetic couplers are separated or otherwise not magnetically secured together. Magnetic couplers 62 optionally may include a coating, cover, and/or covering material 80, for example, to protect at least the magnetic coupling surface 90 of the magnetic coupler from the environment, to reduce wear of any magnets 72 and/or magnetic materials 74 of the magnetic coupler, and/or to shield and/or redirect the magnetic field of the magnets. Examples of covering materials 80 for environmental protection and general mechanical protection include, and/or may be, coatings, fabric, polymeric material, plastic, epoxy, rubber, and the like. Examples of covering materials for magnetic shielding include high magnetic permeability materials and ferromagnetic materials. Thus, it is within the scope of the present disclosure that some, a majority, at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 90%, at least 95%, or even all of the magnets and/or magnetic material of a magnetic coupler 62 may be enclosed or housed within the magnetic coupler and/or otherwise physically shielded from the environment external the magnetic coupler by covering material 80. The magnetic coupling region 88 and/or magnetic coupling surface 90 of a magnetic coupler 62 may be defined at least in part by the positioning of the magnet(s) 72 and/or magnetic material 74 of magnetic coupler 62. For example, the size, type, number, and orientation of the magnets in a magnetic coupler may affect the magnetic field that is emitted from the magnetic coupler. Thus, the magnets may be selected and/or oriented to concentrate the magnetic field at or proximate the magnetic coupling surface 90 and/or to reduce or limit the magnetic field in one or more other regions of the magnetic coupler (such as on other exterior portions of the body of the magnetic coupler, portions of the magnetic coupler that face away from the footwear's foot compartment when the magnetic footwear fastener is in a coupled configuration, and/or portions of the magnetic coupler proximate the mechanical coupling region thereof). Arrays of magnets 72 having such a configuration may be referred to as a magnetic array and/or a plurality of magnets that has a directed magnetic field and/or a directed magnetic flux. As an example, including a plurality of bar (or similar) magnets with generally parallel axes in which adjacent magnets have oppositely aligned poles may concentrate the magnetic field near the coupling region of the magnetic coupler's body 70 (and/or define such a magnetic coupling region 88 of the body) while reducing the magnetic field in regions of the body that extend parallel to the axes and/or that are spaced farther away from the region of concentrated magnetic field. These regions of reduced magnetic field thus will not be drawn together (magnetically attracted) as strongly as the coupling surfaces of the magnetic couplers. Similarly, reducing the magnetic field emitted by other portions of the magnetic couplers may tend to reduce the likelihood of other magnetic materials being coupled to the magnetic couplers. Reducing the magnetic field additionally or alternatively may reduce the distance from which the magnetic couplers are drawn together simply by the emitted magnetic field. In this latter regard, while the magnetic attraction between the coupling surfaces 90 of a pair of magnetic couplers 62 may assist with alignment and interconnection of the magnetic couplers, too strong of an attraction may cause the magnetic couplers to be drawn into a coupled configuration even when a user desires to maintain the footwear to which the magnetic couplers are attached in a loosened configuration. Arranging a series of magnets with alternating poles also may assist in drawing the corresponding coupling regions 90 of a pair of magnetic couplers 62 together to a predefined, or desired, aligned orientation, as the alternating poles may assist with the coupling regions self-aligning, or being magnetically biased to such an aligned orientation. Similarly, such an alternating pole configuration may reduce the likelihood of the magnetic couplers sliding apart from each other (such as responsive to external forces that might cause the coupling regions to separate other than when the user is intending to uncouple the coupling regions) and/or may increase the need to pivot, rotate, or otherwise “peel” the coupling regions apart when it is desired to uncouple the magnetic couplers. Another example of a suitable arrangement of a series (plurality) of magnets to concentrate the magnetic field at the magnetic coupling surface 90 and to minimize the magnetic field at other portions of the magnetic coupler's body (such as at the mechanical coupling region and/or other portion of the magnetic coupler distal or otherwise spaced apart from the magnetic coupling surface) is a Halbach array, or Halbach array arrangement, of magnets. The coupling surface 90 of a magnetic coupler 62 may be defined at least in part by the shape and configuration of the housing, or body, 70 of the magnetic coupler. For example, the housing of the magnetic couplers may be sized and/or shaped to include smooth complementary engagement surfaces in the coupling regions to contribute to the strength of the magnetic coupling between the coupling members at the coupling surfaces. These complementary engagement surfaces also may assist in the coupling regions being drawn and/or guided into proper alignment with each other and/or may reduce the ability of undesired external forces causing the coupling regions to uncouple from each other. For example, the coupling surfaces may be shaped and/or sized, and/or may be bounded by ribs or projections or guides that facilitate alignment and retention of the coupling regions in a coupled configuration. As another example, the composition and/or thickness of the body may assist in defining the coupling surface. For example, exposing or only thinly covering the magnets or magnetic material at the coupling surface may increase the strength of the magnetic coupling between corresponding coupling surfaces 90. Similarly, increasing the thickness of regions of the body that are not intended to be the coupling surface (e.g., the thickness of material separating the magnetic coupler's magnets or magnetic material from the exterior of the body) may reduce the magnetic field that passes through those regions. The magnetic coupler body 70 may at least partially shield the external environment from magnetic fields of magnet(s) 72 of the magnetic footwear fastener's magnetic couplers. At the coupling surface 90, the magnetic field may be enhanced, concentrated, and/or attenuated to achieve sufficient coupling between mating magnetic couplers 62. Bodies 70 may include, and/or may be, environmental-resistant and/or mechanically robust components such as coatings, coverings, fabric, polymeric materials, plastic, epoxy, rubber, and the like. Bodies also optionally may include, and/or may be, magnetic shielding components such as high magnetic permeability materials, ferromagnetic materials, and the like. Reducing the magnetic field strength outside of portions of the magnetic couplers 62 other than the coupling surface 90 may reduce the attraction of other magnetic materials (e.g., environmental debris) to the magnetic couplers 62. Magnetic footwear fasteners 60, and/or one or both magnetic couplers 62 thereof, may include mating features that are configured to guide and/or to align the magnetic couplers to a particular orientation and/or position when the magnetic couplers are drawn together to a coupled configuration. The mating features, when present, additionally or alternatively may be configured to interlock and/or to resist forces that may separate the magnetic assembly, i.e., to provide increased resistance to forces in a particular direction, relative to the resistance in the absence of the mating feature. For example, mating features may provide resistance to shear forces, which are perpendicular to the orientation of the magnetic pole(s) of the magnet(s). Examples of configurations for magnetic couplers with mating features include the stud and cavity of a magnetic snap, one or more ridges, grooves, slots, tabs, flanges, studs, protrusions, recesses, cavities, and/or holes configured to mate with corresponding structures on mating magnetic couplers. Each magnetic coupler 62 of a magnetic footwear fastener 60 also includes a mechanical coupling region 92 that is configured to mechanically couple or otherwise physically connect the magnetic coupler to footwear 10. This mechanical, or physical, connection may be in a temporary or permanent manner, such as depending upon whether the magnetic footwear fastener is configured to be utilized as a magnetic footwear accessory that is not integrated into the construction of the footwear, or whether the magnetic footwear fastener is at least partially or completely integrated into the construction of the footwear. For example, when magnetic footwear fastener 60 is configured to be utilized as a magnetic footwear accessory 64 for footwear 10, such as conventional laced footwear 12, the mechanical coupling region 92 of each magnetic coupler 62 may include at least one coupler eyelet 94. In such a construction, the footwear's lace may be laced through the coupler eyelets and the footwear's footwear eyelets to couple the magnetic footwear fastener to the footwear and thereby permit selective use of the magnetic footwear fastener to retain the footwear in a closed, or sized, configuration around a wearer's foot when the footwear is worn. Furthermore, the magnetic accessories permit selective release of the footwear to an open, or loosened, configuration without requiring untying or other manipulation of the lace. Instead, by uncoupling the magnetic couplers, the footwear's foot opening may be enlarged to permit ready removal of the wearer's foot from the footwear's foot compartment. Moreover, when the wearer decides to again wear the footwear, after inserting the wearer's foot into the foot compartment, recoupling the magnetic couplers together returns the footwear to the previously selected sized configuration, without requiring retying or other manipulation of the footwear's lace. As another example, when magnetic footwear fastener 60 is configured to be utilized as a fully integrated component of footwear 10, the mechanical coupling region 92 of the magnetic couplers is constructed and/or shaped to be secured to the shell, tongue, or other portion of the footwear's upper in such a manner that it cannot be removed from the footwear without destruction or damage to at least a portion of the footwear, the mechanical coupling region, or any fastener mechanism that is utilized to provide this securement. As examples, the mechanical coupling region 92 may be a portion of the magnetic coupler that is sized, shaped, and/or constructed to be sewn, riveted, glued, laminated, or otherwise fastened to the footwear's shell, tongue, cap, or other upper portion. Such a mechanical coupling region 92 of an integrated magnetic coupler thus may include one or more coupler eyelets 94 or similar apertures that receive a lace, band, rivet, or other fastener that is not designed to be removed or to release the magnetic coupler without damage to the fastener, footwear, or magnetic coupler. As another example, the mechanical coupling region 92 may be sufficiently thin and/or formed of a suitable material to permit the mechanical coupling region to be sewn into the upper portion of the footwear. This thin, sewable portion of the mechanical coupling region 92 may be referred to as a fastening layer 212 and optionally may extend from, or be a portion of, the magnetic coupler's body 70 that is generally opposite/distal the magnetic coupling surface 90 of the magnetic coupler. As a further example, the mechanical coupling region may be or include an adhesion layer, or adhesion surface, 211 that is shaped and/or constructed to be adhered, laminated, or otherwise bonded to an upper portion of the footwear. The above-discussed fastening layer 212 additionally or alternatively may be an adhesion layer 211, although it also is within the scope of the present disclosure that an adhesion layer, or adhesion surface, 211 may not be sewn, stitched, or otherwise suitable for being sewn or stitched to the footwear. For example, exterior portions of body 70 into which magnet(s) 72 and/or magnetic material 74 are received may form such an adhesion surface or adhesion layer. As discussed in more detail herein, the mechanical coupling region 92 of a magnetic coupler optionally also may include an elastic region 213, a biasing mechanism 214, and/or a stiffened region 215. Furthermore, mechanical coupling region 92 may include, or be connected with other portions of body 70 by, a hinge, or pivot, 217. Elastic region 213, when present, may be configured to a portion of the magnetic coupler 62 and/or a corresponding portion of the footwear's vamp portion, tongue, or other upper portion to stretch to accommodate the particular size of the wearer's foot that is inserted into the footwear's foot compartment without interfering with the fastening of the magnetic couplers of the magnetic footwear fastener. Biasing mechanism 214, when present, may be configured to urge one or both magnetic couplers of a magnetic footwear fastener to, and/or to remain in, a particular configuration or orientation, such as to be biased to or toward a coupled configuration or an uncoupled configuration. Stiffened region 215, when present, may facilitate urging of the magnetic couplers to a coupled configuration and/or alignment of the magnetic couplers. Hinge, or pivot, 217, when present, may be configured to permit the portions of a magnetic coupler to pivot or flex in a nondestructive manner relative to other portions of the magnetic coupler. For example, a hinge or pivot may permit the mechanical coupling region 92 of a magnetic coupler to pivot relative to the portion of the magnetic coupler containing magnetic coupling surface 90. As schematically illustrated in FIG. 1 in dashed lines, magnetic footwear fasteners 60, such as one or both of the magnetic couplers 62 thereof, may include such optional additional features as a user engagement portion 110, an anti-pinch structure 120, a guide 130, and/or a lock mechanism 140. User engagement portion 110, when present, is shaped or otherwise configured to be grasped by a user for selective and operative uncoupling of the magnetic couplers 62 of a magnetic footwear fastener 60, and optionally for selective and operative coupling of the magnetic couplers. Examples of user engagement portions 110 include handles, handholds, finger holds, pulls, projecting tabs or ears, and/or a grip. The user engagement portion 110 may be a portion of body 70, such as a portion that extends or projects away from the engagement surface of the body. As another example, the user engagement portion 110 may be a separate structure that is secured to body 70 of one or both magnetic couplers 62. Anti-pinch structure 120, when present, is structure that obstructs, and/or deflects a user's fingers away from, the magnetic coupling surfaces of the magnetic couplers when the magnetic coupling surfaces 90 are drawn together. Anti-pinch structure 120 additionally or alternatively may be referred to as pinch-relief structure 120. Examples of pinch-relief structure 120 include one or more flanges, projections, tapered regions, guards, or similar structures that extend from the body of one or both of the magnetic couplers to obstruct a user's finger or other body portion from being unintentionally positioned between the magnetic coupling surfaces of the magnetic couplers when the magnetic couplers are drawn together to/toward their closed configuration. Magnetic couplers 62 additionally or alternatively may include at least one guide, or guide structure, 130 that projects from the body 70 of the magnetic coupler 62 to extend under/along the body of a corresponding magnetic coupler to facilitate proper alignment of the magnetic couplers when the magnetic coupling surfaces 90 of the magnetic couplers are coupled together. Examples of suitable guides 130 include a projecting plate, a flange, and/or a tongue-depressor. As this latter term suggests, a magnetic coupler 62 with such a projecting guide 130 may be depressed against the tongue 36 of the footwear 10 with which the magnetic coupler is used so that the guide urges and/or maintains the tongue away from coupling surface 90 of not only the magnetic coupler, but also the coupling surface of a corresponding magnetic coupler as that magnetic coupler is moved into engagement with the magnetic coupler that includes guide 130. In addition to preventing interference with this desired positioning of the coupling regions of the magnetic couplers by the footwear's tongue, guide 130 also may provide a surface against, or along, which the other magnetic coupler may be slid or otherwise moved as the corresponding coupling surfaces 90 are drawn together. Lock mechanism 140, when present, selectively retains the magnetic couplers 62 of the magnetic footwear fastener 60 in a coupled configuration, thereby providing a mechanical structure that prevents separation of the magnetic couplers over and above the magnetic attraction between the couplers that resists separation of the couplers. For example, mechanical lock mechanism 140 may be utilized to restrict uncoupling of the magnetic couplers of the magnetic footwear fastener, such as even when forces are applied that otherwise would uncouple the magnetic couplers. As an example, a mechanical lock mechanism may be utilized when a user wants to provide extra assurance that the magnetic footwear fastener will not uncouple. Lock mechanism 140, when present, is a releasable mechanism that may be selectively configured between a locked configuration, in which the magnetic couplers are mechanically secured together and prevented from being uncoupled, and an unlocked configuration, in which the mechanical lock mechanism does not inhibit uncoupling of the magnetic couplers. Lock mechanism 140 may be an accessory that is selectively attached to a magnetic footwear fastener 60 or it may be integrated or permanently attached (e.g., not removable without damage to the magnetic coupler) to one or both magnetic couplers of the magnetic coupling assembly. Examples of mechanical lock mechanisms 140 include clasps, ties, hook-and-loop structures, bands, etc. As discussed, footwear 10, including laced footwear 12, may include magnetic footwear fasteners 60 and/or may be utilized with magnetic footwear fasteners 60. By this it is meant that the magnetic footwear fasteners 60 may be accessories (i.e., magnetic accessories 64) that may be utilized with and/or added to conventional footwear, such as conventional laced footwear. Additionally, or alternatively, the magnetic couplers 62 of the magnetic footwear fasteners may be integrated (i.e., as components of partially integrated magnetic footwear fasteners 68 and/or integrated magnetic footwear fasteners 66) into footwear 10 during the manufacture of the footwear, thereby causing at least a portion of the magnetic couplers not to be removable from the footwear without damage to and/or destruction of at least a portion of the magnetic coupler or another portion of the footwear. An example of a magnetic footwear fastener 60 that is configured to be a magnetic footwear accessory 64 for footwear 10, such as laced footwear 12, is shown in FIGS. 2-4. As shown, accessory 64 includes magnetic couplers 62 with bodies 70. Each body 70 includes a magnetic coupling region 88 with a magnetic coupling surface 90. When the magnetic accessory is in a coupled configuration, such as shown in FIGS. 2-4, the magnetic coupling surfaces 90 of each magnetic coupler 62 abut and magnetically secure the couplers together. One or more magnets 72 and/or magnetic material 74 within the bodies 70 provide this magnetic coupling and resist unintentional separation of the magnetic couplers. In solid lines in FIG. 2, the magnetic coupling surfaces 90 are depicted as planar surfaces, but such a construction is not required. For example, the magnetic coupling surfaces 90 may have nonplanar configurations and/or each magnetic coupling surface 90 may not have the same configuration. This is graphically depicted in dashed lines in FIG. 2, in which an example of nonplanar configurations are shown as arcuate configurations, with one magnetic coupler illustrated with a concave magnetic coupling surface, and the other magnetic coupler illustrated with a convex magnetic coupling surface. When the magnetic coupling surfaces 90 have different shapes and/or configurations, the magnetic coupling surfaces still may be complementary so that the magnetic coupling surfaces of the pair of magnetic couplers 62 still abut when the magnetic footwear accessory is in its coupled configuration. The concave-convex magnetic coupling surfaces 90 that are depicted in dashed lines in FIG. 5 provide a graphical example of such a different but complementary pair of magnetic coupling surfaces 90. A potential effect of utilizing arcuate magnetic coupling surfaces 90 is that the coupling surfaces may remain in abutting engagement with each other even when the magnetic couplers 62 of a magnetic accessory 64 (or other magnetic footwear fastener 60) are pivoted from their coupled configuration. This is graphically depicted in FIG. 5, which depicts magnetic couplers 62 with the concave-convex magnetic coupling surfaces 90 that are shown in dashed lined in FIG. 2. However, in FIG. 5, the magnetic couplers 62 have been pivoted relative to each other and/or away from the coupled configuration that is shown in FIG. 2. Despite this relative movement, however, the arcuate shape of the magnetic coupling surfaces 90 permits the surfaces to remain in abutting contact. As such, the magnetic bond between the magnetic couplers may be stronger than an embodiment in which planar magnetic coupling surfaces are utilized. In some embodiments of magnetic footwear fasteners 60, it may be desirable to utilize planar magnetic coupling surfaces in which the strength of the magnetic attraction between the magnetic couplers quickly decreases if the magnetic couplers are pivoted or otherwise moved relative to each other. In other embodiments, it may be desirable to utilize arcuate magnetic coupling surfaces in which the strength of the magnetic attraction between the magnetic couplers is retained, or at least not as quickly decreased, if the magnetic couplers are pivoted or otherwise moved relative to each other. Thus, both options are within the scope of the present disclosure. Returning to FIGS. 2-4, it can be seen that the magnetic couplers 62 of illustrated magnetic footwear accessory 64 each includes a mechanical coupling region 92 with a plurality of spaced-apart coupler eyelets 94. Each coupler eyelet 94 defines a coupler aperture 96 that is sized for receipt of a lace or other flexible tether that couples the magnetic coupler to the footwear eyelets of the footwear with which the magnetic footwear accessory is utilized. Although three coupler eyelets 94 are shown for each magnetic coupler 62 of FIGS. 2-4, it is within the scope of the present disclosure that the number, shape, and size of the coupler eyelets may vary. As examples, each magnetic coupler may include a single coupler eyelet 94, a pair of coupler eyelets 94, or more than three coupler eyelets 94. For example, FIG. 6 illustrates an example of a magnetic accessory 64 in which each magnetic coupler 62 includes a mechanical coupling region 92 with a pair of spaced-apart coupler eyelets 94. As discussed in connection with FIG. 1, magnetic footwear fasteners 60, including magnetic accessories 64, may include one or more optional features such as user engagement portions 110, anti-pinch structures 120, guides 130, and/or lock mechanism 140. FIG. 2 schematically illustrates the optional inclusion of a user engagement portion 110, an anti-pinch structure 120, a guide 130, and a lock mechanism 140 with one or more magnetic couplers 62 of magnetic footwear accessory 64. FIGS. 7-9 provide additional, less schematic, examples of magnetic couplers 62 that include one or more of these optional features. Although depicted on an example of a magnetic footwear fastener 60 that is configured for utilization as a magnetic footwear accessory 64, the features may be utilized with other magnetic footwear fasteners 60, including magnetic footwear fasteners 60 with partially or fully integrated magnetic couplers, without departing from the scope of the present disclosure. FIG. 7 illustrates a magnetic coupler 62 with a user engagement portion 110 in the form of a pull 112 that extends, and optionally flexibly extends, from body 70 of the magnetic coupler 62. When a magnetic footwear fastener 60 is in a coupled configuration, forces exerted using pull 112 may enable a user to more easily apply the required peel, or split, forces to uncouple the magnetic couplers since the forces are applied to an edge/outer region of the magnetic coupler. When a magnetic footwear fastener 60 is in an uncoupled configuration, forces exerted using pull 112 may enable a user to more easily exert forces to urge the magnetic couplers into a coupled configuration. The pulls similarly can be used to assist the user to position the magnetic couplers into alignment and/or above the footwear's tongue (such as to prevent pinching of the tongue's material). It is within the scope of the present disclosure that a magnetic coupler 62 may include zero, one, two, or more pulls 112. In a magnetic footwear fastener 60, zero, one, or each magnetic coupler 62 may include at least one pull 112. As illustrated, pull 110 includes a head, or grip region, 114 that is configured for a user to grasp. When the user grasps and pulls upon head 114, the user thus exerts forces on the magnetic coupler 62, such as to urge the magnetic coupler to couple with or uncouple from a corresponding magnetic coupler and/or to urge the magnetic coupling surface 90 of a magnetic coupler toward or away from the coupling surface of a corresponding magnetic coupler. As illustrated, pull 112 includes an anchor, or mount, 115, which secures the pull to the body of the magnetic coupler. Pull 112 also includes a flexible tether 116 (such as a cord, wire, extrusion, etc.) that extends through a passage in the body of the magnetic coupler, such as through an aperture 96 of a coupler eyelet 94 and terminates at head 114. Other constructions and/or structures for pull 112 are within the scope of the present disclosure. In general, and when present, pulls 112 will have a flexible construction, at least for tether 116, and a larger and/or more rigid head 114 that facilitates gripping by a user. In FIG. 7, the tether 116 of pull 112 is illustrated extending through coupler aperture 96 of one of the coupler eyelets 94 of the magnetic coupler's mechanical coupling region. However, this construction is not required. For example, tether 116 may extend through a different passage or aperture of the magnetic coupler and/or may be affixed to or within the body 70 of the magnetic coupler. It thus is within the scope of the present disclosure that pull 112, when present, may be an accessory that is selectively attached to a magnetic coupler or it may be integrated into the magnetic coupler or permanently attached (i.e., not removable without damage to the pull or magnetic coupler) to the magnetic coupler. FIG. 7 also illustrates an example of an anti-pinch structure 120 in the form of flared, or projecting, edges 122 of the magnetic coupler's body proximate the magnetic coupling surface 90 of coupling region 88. By projecting away from the magnetic coupling surface, edges 122 may provide a form of guard or barrier to limit the potential for a user's finger, other body part, or other objects to be pinched between the magnetic coupling surfaces of a pair of magnetic couplers 62 when the corresponding magnetic footwear fastener is configured to a coupled configuration. As illustrated, edges 122 have arcuate shapes, but other shapes may be utilized, including edges that project at right angles from the body of the magnetic coupler. FIG. 8 provides a graphical example of another user engagement portion 110, namely, a handle, or handhold, 118 that projects from the body 70 of the magnetic coupler 62. Handle 118 may be a portion of the body itself, or it may be a separate component that is secured to the body. Handle 118 may extend from the body in a fixed orientation, such as at a defined angle away from the magnetic coupling surface 90 of the magnetic coupler. As another option, the handle may be connected to the body by a hinge or other flexible mount or connection that permits a user to adjust the angle of the handle when the handle is utilized, and optionally to urge the handle against the body of the magnetic coupler when the handle is not being utilized. Handle 118 additionally or alternatively may be referred to as a wing 118, ear 118, or pull 118. Similar to pull 112 of FIG. 7, handle 118 optionally may include a head, or other enlarged terminal region, 119 that promotes easier grasping of the handle by a user. FIG. 8 also illustrates an example of a guide, or guide structure 130. As illustrated, the guide 130 takes the form of a plate, or ledge, 132 that extends from the body 70 of the magnetic coupler adjacent to the magnetic coupling surface 90 of the magnetic coupler. Plate 132 is shaped to provide a support or other surface upon which the other magnetic coupler of a magnetic footwear fastener 60 may be slid or otherwise guided when the magnetic couplers are drawn together to a coupled configuration. Plate 132, when present, may take any suitable shape. Typically, plate 132 will be thin and will project away from the magnetic coupling surface. As illustrated in FIG. 8, plate 132 projects perpendicular to magnetic coupling surface 90, although this is not required to all embodiments. Plate 132 additionally or alternatively may be another example of an anti-pinch structure, as the plate projecting across the region in which the magnetic coupling surfaces of a pair of magnetic couplers abut may prevent a user's finger, other body part, or other objects from being pinched between these surfaces as the surfaces are drawn together. As discussed, in some embodiments, the magnet(s) 72 and/or magnetic material 74 of a magnetic coupler may be at least substantially, if not completely, housed and/or enclosed within the body 70 of magnetic coupler 62. However, it also is within the scope of the present disclosure that the magnet(s) 72 and/or magnetic material 74 may be exposed, project from the body, and/or be covered by a protective coating (as opposed to the protective structure of the body itself). These options are schematically illustrated in FIG. 8, which for simplicity illustrates the options in the context of a magnet 72. On the right side of FIG. 8, magnet 72 is exposed or otherwise not fully enclosed within body 70. In such an embodiment, magnet 72 may form at least a portion, if not all, of the magnetic coupling surface 90 of the magnetic coupler. Also shown on the right side of FIG. 8 is an optional protective coating 80 that is applied to at least the portion of magnet 72 that is not enclosed within body 70. On the left side of FIG. 8, magnet 72 is shown enclosed within body 70, such as in internal compartment 76 thereof, with a face, or wall, 84 forming the magnetic coupling surface 90 of the magnetic coupler. As discussed, wall 84 may be thin to reduce the distance between the magnets and/or magnetic material of corresponding magnetic couplers when the coupling surfaces are coupled together. FIG. 9 provides two examples of lock mechanisms 140 that may be selectively utilized to mechanically retain the magnetic couplers 62 of a magnetic footwear accessory 64 or other magnetic footwear fastener 60 in a coupled configuration. As illustrated, the lock mechanisms mechanically secure the magnetic coupling surfaces 90 of the magnetic couplers together, such as in their position when the magnetic footwear fastener is in its coupled configuration. On the left side of FIG. 9, a lock mechanism 140 is shown in the form of a rotatable clasp, or latch, 142 that selectively inter-engages with a pin, or mount, 144 to prevent separation of the magnetic coupling surfaces. On the right side of FIG. 9, a lock mechanism 140 is shown in the form of a band 146 that is secured around the pair of magnetic couplers 62 by a fastener 148. As a further example, band 146 may be secured around the magnetic couplers by a fastener 148 in the form of a hook and loop fastener. As mentioned, and as illustrated in the examples of FIGS. 10-12, magnetic couplers 62 may include more than one magnet 72 and/or (as indicated in dashed lines) magnetic material 74. In FIGS. 10 and 11, five magnets 72 are illustrated, but any suitable number of magnets may be provided, including one magnet 72, more than one magnet 72, two magnets 72, three magnets 72, more than three magnets 72, more than five magnets, etc. As a graphical example, FIG. 12 illustrates an example of a magnetic coupler 62 with eleven magnets 72. Variants of the example of FIG. 12 include versions with less than eleven magnets, such as five, seven, or nine, magnets if adjacent pairs of magnets are removed, or more than eleven magnets (such as if additional adjacent pairs of magnets are added to the illustrated array of (plurality of) magnets 72. Magnets 72 may be oriented with their magnetic poles in any direction relative to the internal compartment and/or magnetic coupling surface 90 of the magnetic coupler without departing from the scope of the present disclosure. In some embodiments, it may be useful to orient the poles perpendicular to the length of the compartment and/or magnetic coupling surface, as doing so may increase the attractive force that retains the magnetic coupling surfaces 90 of the corresponding pair of magnetic couplers of a magnetic footwear fastener, and thus footwear 10, in a coupled configuration, and/or may more securely resist unintentional release of the magnetic footwear fastener. Magnets 72 may be oriented with their magnetic poles in any direction relative to the coupling surfaces 90 and/or the magnetic coupler body 70 without departing from the scope of the present disclosure. In some embodiments, it may be useful to orient the poles perpendicular to the length (longest dimension) of magnetic coupling surface 90, as doing so may increase the magnetic (attractive) force that retains the magnetic coupling surfaces 90 of a pair of magnetic couplers 62 together. In other embodiments, it may be useful to orient the poles parallel to the length of the magnetic coupling surface 90. Near the magnetic poles and in the direction of the magnetic axis (the direction between the north and south poles), magnets 72 generally have the highest field strength. By orienting the poles, the magnetic footwear fasteners 60 may be configured to utilize the magnetic fields to increase the attractive force that retains the mating magnetic couplers 62 together. Thus, the magnetic footwear fasteners 60 may be configured to securely resist unintentional release of the coupled magnetic couplers 62. Doing so also may reduce the likelihood of other ferromagnetic materials being drawn into contact with other regions of the magnetic couplers when the magnetic footwear fastener is in a coupled configuration. As an example of an arrangement of magnets 72 within a magnetic coupler 62, a magnetic coupler may include a plurality of bar (or similar) magnets 72 with generally parallel magnetic axes in which adjacent magnets have oppositely aligned magnetic poles. This alternating pole arrangement may concentrate the magnetic field near a series of regions near the magnetic poles. The concentrated field regions may be configured to be near the magnetic coupling surface 90 and configured to attract the magnetic coupling surface of the mating magnetic coupler. The concentrated field regions may be configured to attract the coupling surface 90 of the mating magnetic coupler 62 more strongly than the interspersed regions of less concentrated magnetic fields. Furthermore, the alternating pole arrangement of magnets may enable the magnetic coupling surfaces 90 of the corresponding magnetic couplers 62 to be self-aligning, in that the alternating pole arrangement in the concentrated field regions will cause the magnetic coupling surfaces to be drawn together with the alternating poles of the magnetic couplers aligned. Such an arrangement also may enable the magnetic couplers to resist sliding of the coupled magnetic coupling surfaces relative to each other, such as responsive to external impacts or other forces applied to the lateral ends of the magnetic couplers. The group of magnets 72 in an alternating pole arrangement may be referred to as a directed field magnet, a directed field array of magnets, and/or an array (and/or plurality) of magnets in a directed field configuration. Magnets 72 in an alternating pole arrangement may have their axes aligned collinearly (a box car arrangement, as schematically represented in FIG. 10) or parallel but in the same plane (such as shown in FIG. 11). In FIG. 12, an example of a directed field array of magnets is shown having a Halbach, or Halbach-type, configuration that concentrates the magnetic field proximate the magnetic coupling surfaces and reduces the magnetic field proximate the top exterior surface of the coupler's body and proximate the mechanical coupling region of the magnetic coupler. As shown, the coupler includes a plurality of magnets 72 in which adjacent magnets have perpendicular axes, and in which the magnets on opposed sides of a particular magnetic have oppositely oriented poles. As discussed, this configuration is not required, and the number of magnets in such a directed field and/or Halbach array may vary, including a greater number of magnets or fewer magnets. Although only a single magnetic coupler 62 is schematically illustrated in solid lines in FIGS. 10 and 11, it should be understood that the corresponding magnetic coupler of a magnetic footwear fastener 60 may have an oppositely and/or complementary aligned array of magnetic poles, as illustrated in dashed lines in FIGS. 10-12. By this it is meant that the magnetic poles of the magnets in the pair of magnetic couplers are oriented to draw the magnetic coupling surfaces of the couplers together, or at least not to urge the magnetic coupling surfaces apart. However, and as discussed, this is not required to all embodiments, as only one of the magnetic couplers 62 of a magnetic footwear fastener 60 is required to include at least one magnet, even though the strength of the magnetic coupling, alignment of the magnetic coupling surfaces, etc. may be enhanced if both magnetic couplers 62 include at least one magnet, or even a series of magnets arranged in an alternating pole arrangement, a directed field configuration, and/or a Halbach array arrangement. In some embodiments, such as seen in the example of FIGS. 10-12, a magnetic coupler 62 of a magnetic footwear fastener 60 may include a backing 82 positioned adjacent to the respective magnet 72 within the body's internal compartment 76. Backing 82, when present, may support the magnet(s) and/or metallic material within the magnetic coupler's body, assist in the placement of the magnet(s) and/or metallic material, and/or assist in the assembly of the magnetic couplers. Backing 82, when present, may be formed from a ferromagnetic or non-ferromagnetic material. When formed from a ferromagnetic material, such as a ferromagnetic metallic material, this optional metal backing may serve to direct the magnetic forces of the magnet in the direction of the opposed magnet in an opposed magnetic coupler. When backing 82 is formed from a ferromagnetic material, it may be referred to as a ferromagnetic backing 82, a metallic backing 82, and/or a ferromagnetic metal backing 82. Expressed in slightly different terms, the inclusion of metal backing 82 may assist in focusing the emitted magnetic field toward the coupling surface 90 of the magnetic coupler and/or may increase the strength of the magnetic field, as compared to a magnetic coupler that is otherwise identical except for not including such a metal backing. FIGS. 13-15 illustrate a magnetic footwear fastener 60 in the form of a magnetic accessory 64 being utilized with footwear 10 in the form of laced footwear 12. To simplify FIGS. 13-15, magnetic footwear fastener 60 is illustrated in the form shown in solid lines in FIGS. 2-4; however, it is within the scope of the present disclosure that any of the embodiments, components, features, options, variants, and the like discussed herein, such as in connection with FIGS. 1-12, may be utilized. While the footwear 10 illustrated in the drawings may generally take the form of a casual shoe or an article of athletic footwear, any type of footwear may incorporate the magnetic footwear fasteners 60 disclosed herein, including (but not limited to) athletic footwear, dress footwear, and casual footwear. FIG. 13 also schematically illustrates in dash-dot lines that more than one magnetic footwear fastener 60 may be utilized with a single article of footwear 10. For example, one magnetic footwear fastener 60 may be coupled to the footwear near foot opening 32, and one magnetic footwear fastener 60 may be coupled to the footwear closer to the forefoot region 26 of the footwear. As illustrated in FIG. 13, footwear shell 22 includes a plurality of footwear eyelets 38 that are sized to receive lace 46. These footwear eyelets additionally or alternatively may be referred to as shell eyelets 38. The footwear eyelets 38 include a left series 42 of footwear eyelets 38 and a right series 44 of footwear eyelets 38 along opposed sides of channel 34. In the illustrated examples of FIGS. 13-15, a total of twelve footwear eyelets 38 are included in the footwear's shell 22, including a left series 42 of six footwear eyelets and a right series 44 of six footwear eyelets; however, any suitable number of footwear eyelets may be present. Thus a greater or lesser number of footwear eyelets 38 are within the scope of the present disclosure. For example, the number of footwear eyelets 38 may be based on such factors as the function, intended use, size, and/or style of the footwear. As illustrated in solid lines in FIG. 13, lace 46 is interwoven directly between a subset 39 of opposing left and right footwear eyelets 38 that are proximal to the forefoot region of the foot compartment. Thus, the size of the foot compartment 24 in this portion of the footwear may be adjusted by selectively loosening or tightening the lace. For a subset 41 of the opposing pairs of footwear eyelets 38 proximal to the foot opening 32, lace 46 is not interwoven directly between the opposing left and right footwear eyelets. Instead, the lace is interwoven directly between the left series 42 of footwear eyelets of subset 41 and the coupler eyelets 94 of the left magnetic coupler 62 proximal to the foot opening. Additionally, the lace is interwoven directly between the right series 44 of footwear eyelets of subset 41 and the coupler eyelets 94 of the right magnetic coupler 62 proximal to the foot opening. The magnetic couplers 62 are therefore operatively laced to the footwear's shell 22 so that they are aligned to be selectively and operatively coupled together by magnetic engagement of a corresponding pair of magnetic couplers. Subset 39 of footwear eyelets 38 may be referred to as a directly laced subset of the footwear's eyelets, whereas subset 41 may be referred to as an indirectly laced subset and/or a coupler laced subset of the footwear's eyelets. It is within the scope of the present disclosure that all of the footwear's eyelets are indirectly laced eyelets, although in many embodiments at least one pair of left and right footwear eyelets will be directly laced eyelets. Although not required to all embodiments, the magnetic couplers 62 in a magnetic footwear fastener 60 (and/or magnetic accessory 64) may be described as being present in the form of a left magnetic coupler and a right magnetic coupler, with the terms “left” and “right” being used from the perspective of a wearer wearing the footwear 10 and looking down at the wearer's foot that is within the foot compartment 24 of the footwear. The left and right magnetic couplers additionally or alternatively may be referred to as first and second magnetic couplers, lateral and medial magnetic couplers, and depending on their relative orientation, upper and lower magnetic couplers and/or front and back magnetic couplers. The coupler and footwear eyelets also may be described in similar relative spacial terms. Lace 46 includes opposite ends 48, with the ends being operatively configured to restrict passage of the ends through the footwear eyelets 38 and/or the coupler eyelets 94, for example, when the magnetic couplers are properly installed on footwear 12. As illustrated in dashed lines in FIG. 13, one or both ends 48 of the lace may be knotted, resulting in a thickness, or girth, of the ends that is larger than the footwear eyelets and/or the coupler eyelets, thereby restricting passage of the knotted portion 50 of the lace through the corresponding eyelet. However, other configurations also are within the scope of the present disclosure. For example, and as schematically illustrated at 52 in dash-dot lines, a lace retainer may be utilized to retain one or both ends 48 of lace 46 and to thereby restrict passage of the end(s) through the eyelets. An example of a lace retainer is disclosed in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2013/0199006. When the lace is knotted, clipped, or otherwise secured to restrict passage through the eyelets, such as a footwear eyelet that is closest to the foot opening 32, the terminal (end) portion of the lace optionally may be cut off or stowed within the foot compartment. In the example shown in FIG. 13, lace 46 is interwoven through all of the footwear eyelets 38. That is, the lace 46 extends through all of the footwear apertures 40 in the footwear eyelets 38. However, such a configuration is not required, and a wearer may choose to selectively skip one or more footwear eyelets (or corresponding pair of left and right footwear eyelets) when interweaving the lace with the footwear eyelets 38 and/or with the coupler eyelets 94. For example, depending on such factors as the desired support/tightness to be provided to the wearer's foot, the size of a wearer's ankle and/or foot, and/or on an intended activity or function of the footwear, a wearer may choose not to use the opposing pair or pairs of footwear eyelets closest to the foot opening. In such an example, the wearer may choose to interweave the lace directly between the magnetic couplers and opposing pairs of footwear eyelets beginning at a pair of opposing footwear eyelets that are not the pair of footwear eyelets closest to the foot opening. As discussed, footwear 10 (and laced footwear 12) may be described as having a coupled configuration and at least one uncoupled configuration. In FIG. 13, the footwear 10 and magnetic footwear fastener 60 are in a closed, or coupled, configuration. In FIGS. 14 and 15, the magnetic footwear fastener 60 is in an open, or uncoupled, configuration, and the footwear 10 is respectively shown in two examples of uncoupled, or loosened, configurations. In the coupled configuration, such as illustrated in FIG. 13, the magnetic couplers 62 of each magnetic footwear fastener 60 are aligned and operatively (magnetically) coupled together, for example, to generally support a wearer's foot within foot compartment 24 and to restrict a wearer's foot from being unintentionally removed from the foot compartment. The coupled configuration additionally or alternatively may be described as a configuration in which the magnetic couplers 62 define the size of, and/or restrict the size of, the footwear's foot opening 32 and/or restrict enlargement of foot compartment 24, such as by preventing portions of the shell on opposed sides of channel 34 from moving away from each other. When the footwear is in the coupled configuration, the footwear may be described as having a sized foot compartment and a sized foot opening. Additionally or alternatively, when the footwear is in the coupled configuration, the foot opening and the foot compartment each may be described as having a coupled size, with the size of the foot opening and the foot compartment typically being enlarged when the footwear is in the uncoupled configuration, such as after a wearer removes the wearer's foot from the foot compartment. Thus, when footwear 10 is in the coupled configuration with a wearer's foot within foot compartment 24, the footwear may be secured around the wearer's foot to provide the support and stability that traditionally would be provided when conventional laces or other fastening mechanisms are utilized and operatively secured. In the coupled configuration, a wearer may not be able to remove the wearer's foot from the footwear's foot compartment, or at least removal of the wearer's foot may be restricted or inhibited due to the magnetic couplers preventing the foot opening and/or foot compartment from enlarging. The coupled configuration additionally or alternatively may be referred to as a fastened configuration, a secured configuration, a wearing configuration, and/or a sized configuration. In contrast, when the coupling assembly and/or footwear 12 is/are in the uncoupled configuration, the magnetic couplers are uncoupled (i.e., not magnetically secured together). As such, increasing the size of the foot opening and/or foot compartment is not restricted by the magnetic couplers of magnetic footwear fastener 60 being secured together. Thus, enlargement of the footwear's foot opening and/or foot compartment is less restricted than when the coupling assembly and/or footwear is in the coupled configuration. A wearer therefore may more easily insert and/or remove the wearer's foot into and out of the foot compartment when the footwear is in an uncoupled configuration. In the uncoupled configuration(s), such as illustrated in FIGS. 14 and 15, the magnetic couplers 62 of at least the magnetic footwear fastener 60 closest to foot opening 32 are uncoupled (i.e., not magnetically secured together). For example, in FIG. 14, the magnetic couplers 62 are shown spaced apart from each other on opposite sides of channel 34. As a result, a wearer's foot is generally less restricted from being removed from the foot compartment of the footwear's shell than when the footwear is in the coupled configuration. More specifically, because the magnetic couplers 62 of the magnetic footwear fastener closest to the footwear's foot compartment are no longer in the coupled, or closed, configuration, the footwear's foot compartment and foot opening are not as restricted, or bounded, as when in the coupled configuration. Comparing FIGS. 13 and 14, it will be noted that the actual size of foot opening 32 and foot compartment 24 have not changed. However, FIG. 13 is still considered to be a coupled, or closed, configuration, and FIG. 14 is still considered to be an uncoupled, or open, configuration. The reason for this is that the magnetic footwear fastener shown in solid lines in FIGS. 13 and 14 restricts enlargement of the foot opening and the foot compartment in FIG. 13, but not in FIG. 14. From the uncoupled configuration of FIG. 14, the footwear may be transitioned to the uncoupled configuration of FIG. 15, in which tongue 36 is moved away from foot opening 32. As illustrated, tongue 36 extends at least partially through a portion of channel 34 through which the tongue does not extend in the coupled configuration, and the foot opening and foot compartment are larger than in FIG. 13. The open configuration of FIG. 15 may be achieved in a variety of ways, as discussed herein, including by flexing of a wearer's foot that is within the foot compartment and subsequent removal of the foot from the foot compartment. The uncoupled configuration of FIG. 15 also may be a useful configuration in which to leave footwear 10 after removal from a wearer's foot, as the enlarged foot opening and foot compartment may facilitate easier (re)insertion of the wearer's foot into the foot compartment when the wearer next wants to wear the footwear. Once the wearer's foot is within foot compartment 32, tongue 36 may be returned to the position shown in FIG. 14, if necessary, and then the magnetic couplers may be returned to their coupled configuration. Doing so also returns footwear 10 to its coupled configuration. Because of the attraction between the magnetic coupling surfaces of the magnetic couplers, it may not be necessary for the wearer to position the magnetic coupling surfaces into contact with each other. Instead, moving the magnetic coupling surfaces near each other may be sufficient, with the magnetic attraction between the magnetic coupling surfaces causing the surfaces to be drawn into contact with each other. When the footwear includes more than one magnetic footwear fastener, the footwear optionally may be described as being in the uncoupled configuration at least when the coupling assembly closest to the foot opening is uncoupled. When footwear 10 includes two or more magnetic footwear fasteners 60 and at least one of the magnetic footwear fasteners is in an uncoupled configuration, the footwear optionally may be described as being in a partially uncoupled configuration. In some embodiments, the uncoupled configuration additionally may be described as having a first subconfiguration and a second subconfiguration. In the first subconfiguration, such as illustrated in the example of FIG. 14, the tongue 36 is within the foot compartment 24 and beneath the open channel 34. In the second subconfiguration, such as illustrated in the example of FIG. 15, the tongue extends through the channel within the midfoot region of the footwear so that a wearer's foot is generally less restricted from being removed from the shell than when the footwear is in the first subconfiguration. In such a second subconfiguration, the foot opening 32 is larger than in the first subconfiguration shown in FIG. 14 and/or in the coupled configuration shown in FIG. 13. Accordingly, a wearer may remove the wearer's foot from footwear 12 by flexing, such as plantar flexing, the wearer's foot so that the wearer's foot causes the magnetic couplers 62 to become uncoupled and the tongue to extend up through the open channel. This results in the second subconfiguration, with a significantly enlarged foot opening 32, thereby permitting easy removal of the wearer's foot from the foot compartment. FIG. 14 illustrates that footwear 10 according to the present disclosure may include a tongue 36 that includes a tongue guide 54 that underlies the magnetic couplers 62 of a magnetic footwear fastener 60 when the magnetic couplers are magnetically coupled together to secure the footwear in a coupled configuration. Tongue guide 54 thus restricts the fabric or other material of the footwear's tongue from being pinched between the magnetic coupling surfaces 90 of the magnetic couplers and also provides a support, or guide, surface against which the magnetic couplers may be supported and/or slid as the magnetic coupling surfaces are drawn together. Examples of suitable tongue guides 54 include a stiffened and/or taut tongue region 56 on the tongue's surface that abuts the magnetic footwear fastener when the fastener is in a coupled configuration. For example, the corresponding portion of the tongue may include a plastic or rubber coating or patch, a cured stiffener, etc. FIG. 14 also illustrates a less schematic example of footwear 10, such as laced footwear 12, that includes more than one magnetic footwear fastener 60, such as more than one magnetic accessory 64. To graphically illustrate that magnetic footwear fasteners 60 may have a variety of shapes and sizes, the magnetic couplers 62 of the magnetic accessory 64 closest to the foot opening each includes three coupler eyelets 94, whereas the magnetic couplers of the magnetic accessory closest to forefoot region 26 of the footwear each includes two coupler eyelets. Also, depending upon such factors as wearer preferences, the number of footwear eyelets, and/or the available sizes of magnetic accessories, the same size/style of magnetic accessories may be used instead of using two different sizes/styles. When installing a magnetic accessory 64 on laced footwear 12, lace 46 may be interwoven through any opposing pair or pairs of footwear eyelets that are going to be directly connected by the lace. In other words, the lace may be interwoven through the footwear eyelets that are not utilized to secure the magnetic accessory to the footwear. Typically, the pair or pairs of footwear eyelets will be closest to the forefoot region of the footwear. Next, left and right end regions of the lace are interwoven between respective left and right sets of footwear and coupler eyelets. After doing so, footwear 12 may resemble the footwear shown in FIG. 13, except that the ends of the lace may still be restrained from passing through the footwear eyelets closest to the foot opening. Also, the end regions of the lace may be much longer than necessary to complete the installation of the magnetic accessory. Next, a wearer's foot may be inserted into the foot compartment, and the magnetic accessory may be configured to be in its coupled configuration. Before securing the ends of the lace to define the size of the foot compartment and foot opening in the closed configuration of the footwear, the lace may be adjusted until the desired size/fit is achieved. After doing so, the ends of the lace may be secured so that they are restrained from being withdrawn through the utilized footwear eyelets that are closest to the foot compartment. As discussed, this may be accomplished by a variety of mechanisms, including knotting the end of the lace and/or securing the end of the lace with a lace retainer. Any excess length of the end regions of the lace may be cut off, or any excess length may be tucked within the foot compartment. When cutting off the excess length of the end region of the lace, some excess length, such as 1-5 centimeters, may be retained to permit readjustment of the size of the foot opening and the foot compartment when the footwear is in the coupled configuration. When two or more magnetic accessories are to be installed on the same article of footwear, the preceding method may still apply. However, the lace may be interwoven sequentially through all of the magnetic accessories, and all of the magnetic accessories should be in a coupled configuration before sizing the lace, and thereby defining the size of the foot compartment and foot opening when the footwear is in the coupled configuration. When a single lace 46 is used to couple the magnetic couplers 62 of one or more magnetic accessories to an article of footwear 10, the lace typically will span channel 34 and/or directly lace at least one pair of left and right footwear eyelets. As a variant to the above methods and embodiments, when it is desirable to indirectly lace all of the footwear's eyelets to a magnetic coupler, a pair of laces 46 may be used (one lace for the left series of footwear eyelets and the corresponding left magnetic coupler(s), and one lace for the right series of footwear eyelets and the corresponding right magnetic coupler(s)). Alternatively, the footwear's lace 46 may be cut into two lace segments prior to installing the magnetic couplers, with one lace segment being use for the left series of footwear eyelets and the corresponding left magnetic coupler(s), and one lace segment being used for the right series of footwear eyelets and the right magnetic coupler(s). Magnetic footwear fasteners 60 in the form of magnetic accessories 64 may be sold with conventional laced footwear. Additionally or alternatively, magnetic accessories 64 may be packaged and/or sold as a kit, which is indicated schematically in dashed lines in FIG. 2 at 150. Kit 150 typically includes at least a pair of magnetic accessories 64, and kit 150 also may include instructions 152. Instructions 152, which also may be referred to as an instruction manual 152 and/or installation manual 152, may include any suitable graphical and/or textual instructions that indicate to a user and/or wearer how to install and/or utilize the magnetic accessories with footwear. As discussed, magnetic footwear fasteners 60 according to the present disclosure are not required to always be magnetic accessories 64 that are selectively and removably utilized with footwear 10, including laced footwear 12. Such embodiments offer the advantage of being able to be utilized with conventional laced footwear, but this is not required to all embodiments. In particular, magnetic footwear fasteners 60 may include magnetic couplers 62 that are partially or completely integrated with footwear 10. In such embodiments, the magnetic couplers additionally or alternatively may be described as not being removable from the footwear without damage or destruction of at least one of the footwear, the magnetic coupler, or any structure or device that secures the magnetic coupler to the footwear. FIG. 16 illustrates an example of footwear 10 with a magnetic footwear fastener 60 in the form of an integrated magnetic footwear fastener 66. Specifically, in FIG. 16, both magnetic couplers 62 of the magnetic footwear fastener are integrated into the footwear's upper 22, such as into the vamp portion 37 thereof on opposed sides of channel 34. In FIGS. 16-24, magnetic footwear fasteners 60 and footwear 10 are illustrated in simplified forms in view of the considerable discussion about each of these components, optional features, variants, constructions, and the like in the preceding discussion and Figures. Thus, the illustrated fasteners 60 and footwear 10 should not be not limited to the simplified forms illustrated in FIGS. 16-24 and instead may include any of the structures, features, components, variants, and the like discussed and/or illustrated elsewhere herein, such as in connection with FIGS. 1-12. As shown in FIG. 16, a plurality of bands 160 are used to interconnect corresponding footwear eyelets 38 and coupler eyelets 94. Bands 160 are designed to permanently interconnect the footwear eyelets and coupler eyelets, and thus magnetic couplers 62 may not be removed from the footwear without damaging at least one of the bands, the magnetic couplers, or footwear 10. Examples of bands 160 include “zip tie” type bands that are not configured to be loosened or removed after being secured in a closed loop. Another example is a band that is clipped, fused, adhered, or otherwise fixed in a defined size and closed-loop configuration in which the band passes through adjacent footwear and coupler eyelets. As a variant to the integrated magnetic footwear fastener 66 discussed above, if bands 160 are instead constructed to be selectively removed and replaced without destruction of the bands, then FIG. 16 may be described as providing a further example of a magnetic accessory 64 because the magnetic couplers 62 may be removed and/or replaced without damage or destruction. As a further variant, if the bands on just the left or right series of footwear eyelets are designed to permanently interconnect the corresponding footwear and coupler eyelets, then the magnetic footwear fastener may be described as being an example of a partially integrated magnetic footwear fastener because one of the magnetic couplers may be selectively removed and replaced without damage to the coupler, footwear, or corresponding bands. For example, the relative position of the removable magnetic coupler may be adjusted to adjust the size of the foot compartment and/or foot opening when the footwear is in a coupled configuration. FIG. 17 provides another example of footwear 10 with a magnetic footwear fastener 60 in the form of a partially integrated magnetic footwear fastener 68. As shown, the right magnetic coupler is integrated into the right series 44 of footwear eyelets 38 with bands 160, whereas the left magnetic coupler is removably (and thus adjustably) coupled to the left series 42 of footwear eyelets 38 by lace 46. FIGS. 16 and 17 illustrate footwear 10 in which the footwear includes a plurality of footwear eyelets 38 on each side of the footwear's channel 34. As such, the footwear of FIGS. 16 and 17 still may be described as being laced footwear 12, in that the footwear eyelets permit conventional use of a lace to size the footwear's foot compartment and foot opening, such as prior to installation of the magnetic footwear fastener or if the magnetic footwear fastener is removed from the footwear. However, it is within the scope of the present disclosure that footwear 10 may not include footwear eyelets and/or may not utilize a lace for selective sizing of the foot compartment. An example of footwear 10 that includes a magnetic footwear fastener 60 in the form of an integrated magnetic footwear fastener 66 and that does not include footwear eyelets or a lace is shown in FIG. 18 and generally indicated 200. As shown, the footwear's upper 22 includes a channel 34 in the form of a narrow opening defined between the edges 35 of opposed vamp portions 37 of the footwear's upper 22. The integrated magnetic footwear fastener's magnetic couplers 62 are integrated into vamp portions 37 on opposed sides of channel 35. Edges 35 may face each other when the magnetic footwear fastener is in the coupled configuration and may face generally away from each other when the magnetic footwear fastener is in an uncoupled configuration. As shown, each magnetic coupler 62 includes a magnetic coupling region 88 with a magnetic coupling surface 90 that generally faces the corresponding magnetic coupling region and magnetic coupling surface of the other magnetic coupler when the magnetic footwear fastener is in the coupled configuration shown in FIG. 18. Upper 22 and/or vamp portions 37 additionally or alternatively may be described as including flaps 37 with edges 35 that are positioned together or in close proximity when the magnetic footwear fastener is in a coupled configuration and which are spaced apart from each other (to a greater relative extent) when the magnetic footwear fastener is in an uncoupled configuration. The flaps and/or vamp portions 37 may be formed of conventional materials from which footwear uppers are formed, including fabric or leather. It also is within the scope of the present disclosure that the flaps and/or vamp portions 37 may be formed from, and/or include a subregion that is formed from, an elastic or otherwise resiliently stretchable material. Including such a stretchable region may enable the flaps and/or vamp portions to adjust their relative size and orientation to adjust to the shape and/or size of the wearer's foot that is received into the footwear's foot compartment 24. In FIG. 18, the magnetic coupling regions 88 are shown extending generally along the corresponding edges 35 of the vamp portions 37 to which the magnetic couplers 62 are integrated. It is within the scope of the present disclosure that the magnetic coupling regions 88 alternatively are configured to be recessed slightly from or extend beyond/over the edges of the vamp portions to which the magnetic couplers are integrated. In addition, the magnetic couplers 62 are shown in FIG. 18 as being beneath the exterior, or outer surface, of the vamp portions 37 to which the magnetic couplers are integrated. It is within the scope of the present disclosure that the magnetic couplers may be secured on top of the vamp portions, secured beneath the vamp portions, or embedded or otherwise positioned within the vamp portions. Similar to magnetic couplers 62 that are utilized as magnetic accessories, integrated magnetic couplers also include a mechanical coupling region 92 that is configured to mechanically couple or otherwise physically connect the magnetic coupler to the footwear, such as to the vamp portion 37 to which the coupler is integrated. In FIG. 18, mechanical coupling region 92 takes the form of a fastening layer 212 that projects from body 70 of the magnetic coupler along and/or with vamp portion 37 of the footwear's upper. Fastening layer 212 may be integrated into the vamp portion by any suitable mechanism, such as by sewing, riveting, adhering, fusing, or otherwise securing the fastening layer 212 in such a manner that the magnetic coupler is securely integrated to the vamp portion. When fastening layer 212 is laminated, fused, or otherwise adhered to the vamp portion, fastening layer 212 additionally or alternatively may be referred to as an adhesion layer 211. Fastening layer 212 additionally or alternatively may be and/or include an elastic region 213 and/or a stiffened region 215. An elastic region 213, when present, may be configured to permit the vamp portion 37 of the footwear's upper to which the magnetic coupler is integrated to stretch to accommodate the particular size of the wearer's foot that is inserted into the footwear's foot compartment without interfering with the fastening of the magnetic coupler to the vamp portion. This may increase the fit and/or comfort of the footwear and also may reduce forces that may urge the magnetic footwear fastener to unintentionally uncouple, such as if the wearer's foot is sufficiently large that the magnetic coupling surfaces of the magnetic couplers may not be fully engaged in the coupled configuration. Elastic region 213 additionally or alternatively may be referred to as a resiliently stretchable region 213 and/or a resilient region 213. Stiffened region 215, when present, may provide a further example of an anti-pinch mechanism and/or guide mechanism that facilitate(s) urging of the magnetic couplers to a coupled configuration. It also is within the scope of the present disclosure that an integrated magnetic coupler may include a mechanical coupling region 92 that does not include a fastening layer 212. As examples, body 70 itself may form the mechanical coupling region, in that the body is adhered, riveted, fastened, fused, or otherwise integrated into the footwear's upper, such as vamp portions 37 thereof. As another example, the mechanical coupling region 92 may be one or more discrete extensions or projections of the body 70, such as to receive stitching or a mechanical fastener to integrate the magnetic coupler to the footwear's upper. As a further example, one or more coupler eyelets or similar apertures may be formed in or extend from the coupler's body to receive a tie, integrated lace, tether, rivet, or other mechanical fastener to secure the mechanical coupling region to the footwear. FIG. 18 also schematically illustrates that the mechanical coupling region 92 of a magnetic coupler 62 may include a hinge, or pivot, 217 that pivotally couples the mechanical coupling region to the footwear and/or that pivotally couples portions of the magnetic coupler together for relative pivotal movement. For example, a hinge 217 may pivotally interconnect mechanical coupling region 92 with the portion of body 70 that contains magnetic coupling surface 90 of the magnetic coupler. Such a construction may permit repeated flexing or pivoting of the portion of the magnetic coupler that contains the magnetic coupling surface relative to the mechanical coupling region 92 and/or the portion of the footwear's upper to which the mechanical coupling region is coupled. Any suitable mechanical construction may be utilized for hinge 217. In FIG. 19, footwear 200 of FIG. 18 is shown in an uncoupled configuration. Footwear 200 may be configured to the uncoupled configuration through any of the methods described herein, such as by flexing of the wearer's foot and/or manual separation of the magnetic couplers by the wearer's hands. As shown, and similar to the preceding discussions of open configurations of footwear 10, the magnetic coupling surfaces 90 of the magnetic couplers are spaced apart from each other relative to their position in the coupled configuration of FIG. 18. Also, foot compartment 24 and foot opening 32 are larger in the uncoupled configuration of FIG. 19 than in the coupled configuration of FIG. 18, in which the integrated magnetic footwear fastener restricts enlargement of the foot compartment and the foot opening. FIG. 19 also illustrates that footwear 10, including footwear 200, may include a biasing mechanism 214 that is configured to urge the magnetic footwear fastener to, and/or to remain in, an uncoupled configuration. When present, biasing mechanism 214 may exert a biasing force that urges the magnetic coupling surfaces 90 of the magnetic couplers away from each other, such as to urge the magnetic couplers and/or corresponding vamp portions of upper 22 to pivot, curl, fold, or otherwise move away from each other. This biasing force exerted by the biasing mechanism should be less than the magnetic force that retains the magnetic coupling surfaces together when the magnetic footwear fastener is in a coupled configuration. Therefore, when the magnetic footwear fastener is in the coupled configuration, the biasing mechanism will not cause the magnetic couplers to separate and the magnetic footwear fastener to thus be reconfigured to the uncoupled configuration. However, when a wearer applies additional separation forces to the magnetic footwear fastener, such as those described above in connection with intentional uncoupling of the magnetic footwear fastener's magnetic couplers, the presence of biasing mechanism 214 may reduce the force that the wearer otherwise needs to apply to intentionally uncouple the magnetic footwear fastener. Additionally or alternatively, biasing mechanism 214, when present, may urge the magnetic coupling surfaces 90 of the magnetic couplers 62 to remain separated from each other when the magnetic footwear fastener is in an uncoupled configuration. Specifically, and as discussed, the magnetic couplers may be designed so that their magnetic coupling surfaces are strongly (magnetically) attracted to each other, but only when placed close to each other due to the magnetic field being concentrated to the magnetic coupling surface. Biasing mechanism 214, when present, may urge the uncoupled magnetic couplers to remain a greater distance apart from each other than the minimum distance in which magnetic coupling surfaces will be drawn, by the exerted magnetic field, into contact with each other. Biasing mechanism 214 additionally or alternatively may be referred to as biasing structure 214 and may take any suitable form and/or may include any suitable structure. As an example, biasing mechanism 214 may be or include a bistable material, a leaf (or other) spring, and/or a resilient material having a neutral state in which the magnetic coupling surfaces are spaced apart and/or away from each other. Footwear 10, including footwear 200, that does not include a lace or straps to adjust the size of the foot compartment and/or foot opening of the footwear still may include an upper-adjustment mechanism 216 that permits selective adjustment of the size of the footwear's foot compartment and/or foot opening. For example, since the connection between magnetic couplers 62 is a rigid connection, including a region of the footwear's upper that is adjustable may permit a more comfortable fit because the wearer may adjust the size of the footwear's foot compartment and/or foot opening. The upper-adjustment mechanism 216, when present, may provide this adjustability by any suitable mechanism and/or structure. For example, the upper-adjustment mechanism 216 may permit selective adjustment within a range of user-selected positions, such as how a user conventionally may adjust the size of a foot compartment by adjusting the position of laces, straps, and similar structure. Upper-adjustment mechanism 216 additionally or alternatively may be referred to as a shell adjustment mechanism 216, a footwear sizing mechanism 216, an upper sizing mechanism 216, a shell sizing mechanism 216, an adjustment mechanism 216, and/or a sizing mechanism 216. An example of an upper-adjustment mechanism 216 is the elastic region(s) described above with respect to FIG. 18. Similarly, FIG. 20 also illustrates an optional upper-adjustment mechanism 216 in the form of at least one elastic region 213 of upper 22. As discussed, this elastic/stretchable region permits selective resilient stretching of the upper to accommodate different sizes of wearers' feet that may be inserted into the footwear's foot compartment. FIG. 20 also provides an example of an upper-adjustment mechanism 216 in the form of a tether, or tie, mechanism 218 that selectively reduces the size of the footwear's foot compartment 24. As shown, tie mechanism 218 includes a series of adjustment eyelets 220 on both sides of region 213, and a tie 222 that extends through the adjustment eyelets 220. By selectively adjusting the length of tie 222 the adjustment eyelets 220 on opposing sides of region 213 are drawn closer together or are permitted to be farther apart from each other, thereby adjusting the size of the foot compartment. The length of tie 222 may be adjusted in any suitable manner, including those described herein in connection with adjusting the size of lace 46. When tie mechanism 218 is utilized, region 213 may be an elastic region, such as discussed above, although it alternatively may simply be a non-elastic portion of the upper, such as which may be formed from leather, fabric, etc. Additional examples of upper-adjustment mechanism 216 include a series of hook-and-eye and/or hook-and-loop structures that selectively adjust the distance between the opposing sides of region 213. FIG. 20 also provides graphical, albeit somewhat schematic, examples of magnetic couplers 62 that are positioned above (i.e., on the exterior surface of) and/or below (i.e., within and/or underneath) the vamp portions 37 of the footwear's upper to which the magnetic couplers are integrated. FIGS. 21 and 22 provide further examples of footwear 10 in the form of footwear 200 with magnetic footwear fasteners 60 in the form of integrated magnetic footwear fasteners 66. FIGS. 21 and 22 also provide further examples of footwear 10 and/or 200 in which the vamp regions 37 include an upper-adjustment mechanism 216 in the form of elastic region 213. In other words, the vamp regions 37 include and/or are formed from an elastic or otherwise resiliently stretchable material that enables the size of the foot compartment 24 to adjust to better conform to the size of the wearer's foot that is inserted into the foot compartment. As indicated in dashed lines in FIGS. 21 and 22, the illustrated footwear additionally may include a biasing mechanism 214 to urge the magnetic coupling surfaces 90 of the integrated magnetic couplers away from their coupled configuration. FIG. 22 also provides an additional example of upper-adjustment mechanism 216 and/or lock mechanism 140. Specifically, the footwear includes at least one strap 230 that is selectively fastened across channel 34 to selectively adjust the size of foot compartment 24 and/or restrict the magnetic coupling surfaces 90 of the magnetic fasteners 62 from separating and thereby transition from a coupled configuration to an uncoupled configuration. A series of spaced-apart straps 230 are shown in FIG. 22, but it is within the scope of the present disclosure that the number of such optional straps 230 may vary. Straps 230 may have any suitable form and/or may be formed from any suitable material, including elastic and nonelastic materials. One or both end regions 232 of each strap may be sewn or otherwise integrated into the upper, such as vamp portion 37. Additionally or alternatively, one or both end regions 232 of each strap may removably coupled to the upper, (such as vamp portion 37) by a releasable fastening mechanism. Examples of releasable fastening mechanisms are discussed herein and include hook-and-loop fasteners, hook-and-eye fasteners, snaps, and clips. At least when end region 232 is coupled to the upper by a releasable fastening mechanism, the corresponding vamp portion 37 or other region of the upper may include a strap-receiver 234 that is configured to receive and selectively and temporarily retain the end region of the strap. As an example, one or both end regions of a strap 230 may include the hook or the loop portion of a hook-and-loop fastener, and the corresponding vamp region or other upper portion may include the other of the hook or the loop portion of a hook-and-loop fastener. By analogy, snap fasteners and/or hook-and-eye fasteners may be utilized in a similar manner. FIGS. 23 and 24 illustrate additional examples of footwear 10 with magnetic footwear fasteners 60 in the form of integrated magnetic footwear fasteners 66. In particular, FIGS. 23 and 24 illustrate examples of footwear 10 in which a pair of magnetic fastening mechanisms 60 are utilized to configure the footwear into its coupled configuration, with each magnetic fastening mechanism 60 including one magnetic coupler 62 that is integrated with the footwear's vamp portion 37 and one magnetic coupler 62 that is integrated with the footwear's tongue 36. As such, the left and right sides (which also may be referred to as the lateral and medial sides) of the footwear's tongue each are magnetically coupled to a corresponding left and right (or lateral and medial) vamp portion when the footwear is in its coupled configuration, such as shown in FIG. 23. In the illustrated example shown in solid lines in FIG. 23, the portion of tongue 36 to which magnetic couplers 62 are integrated proximal the footwear's foot opening 32 extends above vamp portions 37. This portion is generally indicated in FIGS. 23 and 24 at 240. As discussed, such a tongue, or tongue portion, that extends above the vamp portion and corresponding channel 34 when the magnetic footwear fastener is in the coupled configuration additionally or alternatively may be referred to as a cap, or cover. The magnetic couplers 62 on the tongue may be positioned in any suitable location of the tongue to operatively (magnetically) couple to the corresponding magnetic couplers 62 on the footwear's vamp portions to selectively secure the footwear in its coupled configuration. In some embodiments, the magnetic coupling surface of the magnetic couplers 62 on the tongue may be on or extend from an underside of tongue portion 240. In some embodiments, the magnetic coupling surface of the magnetic couplers 62 on the tongue may be on and/or extend from a side (lateral or medial) of the tongue. In some embodiments, the magnetic couplers on the tongue may be integrated within the tongue and thus may be generally hidden from view and protected from external elements, regardless of whether the footwear is in a coupled configuration or an uncoupled configuration. When the footwear of FIG. 23 is urged to its uncoupled configuration, such as is shown somewhat schematically in FIG. 24, it can be seen that the corresponding portion of tongue (or cap) 240 into which the magnetic couplers 62 are integrated may bend, pivot, or otherwise move away from the foot compartment. For example, flexing of the wearer's foot from within the foot compartment may exert sufficient force on the tongue and corresponding magnetic footwear fasteners to cause the magnetic coupling surfaces 90 of the fasteners to separate and permit the pivotal or similar movement of the tongue portion away from the foot compartment. At least portion 240 of tongue 36 may be stiff, or at least stiffer than the material that forms the upper portion of the shell. Portion 240 optionally may include a rigid, or semi-rigid, insert to stiffen the tongue portion. Thus, portion 240 and/or 244 of tongue 36 optionally may include a stiffened region 215, as indicated in FIG. 24. As discussed, footwear 10 and magnetic footwear fasteners 60 according to the present disclosure may have a variety of features, components, variants, etc. It also has been discussed that features, components, variants, etc. that are introduced and/or illustrated with respect to one or more examples may be used with other examples without departing from the scope of the present disclosure. FIGS. 23 and 24 thus include additional examples of such features, components, and/or variants, which accordingly are not going to be discussed again. For example, FIG. 23 illustrates another example of an upper-adjustment mechanism 216, with the depicted example including a plurality of tongue eyelets 242 through which a lace 46 is interwoven. The size of the footwear's foot compartment 24 may be selectively adjusted by tightening or loosening the tension in lace 46, as doing so adjusts the relative distance between the tongue eyelets 242 on the left and right (lateral and medial) sides of the tongue. When the footwear's magnetic fasteners 60 are in their coupled configuration, this relative adjustment of the distance between the tongue eyelets results in a selective adjustment of the width of the tongue and thereby an adjustment of the foot compartment's size. Although tongue eyelets 242 are shown in FIG. 23 on the upper/exterior surface of the tongue, it is within the scope of the present disclosure that the tongue eyelets alternatively may be on the underside (which faces foot compartment 24) of the tongue or that the tongue eyelets may be formed within the tongue and thereby not visible from external the tongue. In either of these optional configurations, at least a portion of the lace that is interwoven through the tongue eyelets may still be accessible from external the tongue to permit a wearer to selectively tighten or loosen the tension in the lace and thereby adjust the relative size of the tongue and the foot compartment. FIG. 23 also illustrates that an additional pair of magnetic footwear fasteners 60 may be utilized to magnetically couple a second portion 244 of the tongue to the footwear's upper. The second portion of tongue 36 is indicated generally in dashed lines at 244 and may be described as being closer to the forefoot region 26 of the footwear's upper than tongue portion 240. The second portion 244 of the tongue optionally also may extend above channel 34 when the footwear is in its coupled configuration. Portion 244 of tongue 36 may be directly secured to the forefoot region of the footwear, as discussed herein; however, it also is within the scope of the present disclosure that a removable fastening mechanism, such as a snap, button, hook-and-loop fastener, and the like may be utilized to connect the tongue to the forefoot region of the footwear. FIG. 24 also illustrates further examples of a biasing mechanism 214 that may be selectively included to urge/retain the magnetic couplers away from their coupled configuration. In FIG. 24, the biasing mechanism 214 is illustrated as biasing the tongue portion(s) away from channel 34, and thereby urging the magnetic couplers that are integrated into the tongue portion(s) away from the corresponding magnetic couplers that are integrated into the footwear's upper, such as the vamp portions thereof. FIG. 24 also illustrates that the footwear may include a guide mechanism 130 that is configured to retain the corresponding magnetic couplers 62 of a magnetic footwear fastener 60 in sufficient alignment that the corresponding magnetic coupling surfaces of the magnetic couplers will be positioned sufficiently close to each other to be magnetically coupled in the coupled configuration when the tongue is pivoted back toward the footwear compartment. Accordingly, upon a wearer uncoupling the magnetic footwear fasteners, at least tongue portion 240 may be biased, or predisposed, to automatically pivot away from the footwear's foot compartment 2. Such a construction may facilitate a wearer inserting the wearer's foot into the footwear's foot compartment to don the footwear, and in some embodiments, removal of the wearer's foot from the foot compartment. For example, the biasing of at least tongue portion 240 to, and/or to remain in, the uncoupled configuration may make it easier for the wearer to insert the wearer's foot into the foot compartment due to the comparatively larger foot opening 32 that is provided to the wearer. Once the wearer's foot is fully positioned within the footwear's foot compartment, the wearer may urge tongue portion 240 to return toward the foot compartment, such as against the bias of biasing mechanism 214. During this movement toward the foot compartment, guide mechanism 130 may urge or retain the magnetic couplers of each magnetic footwear fastener to remain sufficiently aligned. As the corresponding magnetic coupling surfaces of each corresponding pair of magnetic couplers are positioned near each other, the magnetic attraction between the surfaces should urge the surfaces to move together to configure the magnetic footwear fasteners, and thus the footwear, back to the coupled configuration. As used herein, the terms “selective” and “selectively,” when modifying an action, movement, configuration, or other activity of one or more components or characteristics of an apparatus, mean that the specific action, movement, configuration, or other activity is a direct or indirect result of user manipulation of an aspect of, or one or more components of, the apparatus. As used herein, the terms “adapted” and “configured” mean that the element, component, or other subject matter is designed and/or intended to perform a given function. Thus, the use of the terms “adapted” and “configured” should not be construed to mean that a given element, component, or other subject matter is simply “capable of” performing a given function but that the element, component, and/or other subject matter is specifically selected, created, implemented, utilized, programmed, and/or designed for the purpose of performing the function. It also is within the scope of the present disclosure that elements, components, and/or other recited subject matter that is recited as being adapted to perform a particular function may additionally or alternatively be described as being configured to perform that function, and vice versa. Similarly, subject matter that is recited as being configured to perform a particular function may additionally or alternatively be described as being operative to perform that function. As used herein, the term “and/or” placed between a first entity and a second entity means one of (1) the first entity, (2) the second entity, and (3) the first entity and the second entity. Multiple entities listed with “and/or” should be construed in the same manner, i.e., “one or more” of the entities so conjoined. Other entities may optionally be present other than the entities specifically identified by the “and/or” clause, whether related or unrelated to those entities specifically identified. Thus, as a non-limiting example, a reference to “A and/or B,” when used in conjunction with open-ended language such as “comprising” may refer, in one embodiment, to A only (optionally including entities other than B); in another embodiment, to B only (optionally including entities other than A); in yet another embodiment, to both A and B (optionally including other entities). These entities may refer to elements, actions, structures, steps, operations, values, and the like. As used herein, the phrase “at least one,” in reference to a list of one or more entities should be understood to mean at least one entity selected from any one or more of the entity in the list of entities, but not necessarily including at least one of each and every entity specifically listed within the list of entities and not excluding any combinations of entities in the list of entities. This definition also allows that entities may optionally be present other than the entities specifically identified within the list of entities to which the phrase “at least one” refers, whether related or unrelated to those entities specifically identified. Thus, as a non-limiting example, “at least one of A and B” (or, equivalently, “at least one of A or B,” or, equivalently “at least one of A and/or B”) may refer, in one embodiment, to at least one, optionally including more than one, A, with no B present (and optionally including entities other than B); in another embodiment, to at least one, optionally including more than one, B, with no A present (and optionally including entities other than A); in yet another embodiment, to at least one, optionally including more than one, A, and at least one, optionally including more than one, B (and optionally including other entities). In other words, the phrases “at least one,” “one or more,” and “and/or” are open-ended expressions that are both conjunctive and disjunctive in operation. For example, each of the expressions “at least one of A, B and C,” “at least one of A, B, or C,” “one or more of A, B, and C,” “one or more of A, B, or C” and “A, B, and/or C” may mean A alone, B alone, C alone, A and B together, A and C together, B and C together, A, B and C together, and optionally any of the above in combination with at least one other entity.
