The present invention relates to a cosmetic composition, especially a hair composition, based on one or more particular dicarbonyl compounds and/or hydrates thereof and/or salts thereof, and also to a process for straightening keratin fibres, especially the hair, using this composition. In the hair field, consumers wish to have available compositions which make it possible to introduce a temporary change to their head of hair, while targeting good remanence of the effect produced. In general, it is desirable for the change to withstand shampooing operations for a minimum of 15 days, indeed even more, depending on the nature of the said change. Treatments already exist for modifying the colour or the shape of the hair and also, to some extent, the texture of the hair. One of the known treatments for modifying the texture of the hair consists of the combination of heat and of a formaldehyde-comprising composition. This treatment is especially effective for imparting a better appearance to damaged hair and/or for treating long hair and curly hair. The action of formaldehyde is associated with its ability to crosslink proteins by reaction with the nucleophilic sites thereof. The heat used may be that of an iron (flat tongs or crimping iron), the temperature of which may generally be up to 200° C. or more. However, it is increasingly sought to avoid the use of such substances, which may prove to be aggressive to the hair and other keratin materials. Patent application WO 2011/104 282 thus proposed a novel process for semi-permanently straightening the hair, which consists in applying an α-keto acid solution to the hair for 15 to 120 minutes, then drying and, finally, straightening the head of hair with an iron at a temperature of about 200° C. The α-keto acid employed is preferably glyoxylic acid. Patent application WO2012/105985 discloses a method of enhancing the removal of the natural curl from hair comprising the steps of applying an alkaline composition and then an acidic composition having a pH of less than 1.5 which comprises glyoxylic acid and/or glyoxylic amide. However, it has been noted that the use of glyoxylic acid can result in some significant limitations; in particular, at high concentration it may not be well tolerated, in particular when the scalp is sensitive and/or irritated. Its volatility, amplified by the use of heat (iron), can also be a problem. Furthermore, cosmetic formulations having an acidic pH may impair the hair and/or impair its colour. It is already known practice to use glyoxylic acid esters in hair compositions, in particular in hair dye compositions, as described in document DE19859722, and in reducing compositions, as described in document DE19860239. However, the efficacy of these compositions is not yet sufficient. These compositions comprising glyoxylic acid are in point of fact formulated at a very acidic pH. When they are based on emulsions, they may have stability problems, especially at high temperature, for instance during transportation or storage. The instability of the formulations is troublesome in several respects. Besides the inconvenience for the user who is confronted with the use of diversely fluid formulations, this entails an increased risk of exposure to the acidity of these formulations, particularly for the region of the eyes if the product has become too liquid. Moreover, the fatty substances present in the formulations may rise to the surface of the compositions, clog the bottleware and lead to risks of overpressure or of non-uniformity on application. Finally, the cosmetic qualities obtained with the fresh formulations may be lost if the formulations are unstable, the cosmetic agents no longer being in equilibrium or only being present in one of the phases. The aim of the invention is to develop a straightening/relaxing composition which is stable over time and which makes it possible to straighten/relax and/or reduce the volume of the hair in an efficient and persistent manner while limiting damage to the hair, while at the same time retaining comfort at the time of application for the user of the composition, but also for the hairdresser who applies it. Thus, one subject of the present invention is a cosmetic composition comprising one or more dicarbonyl compounds corresponding to formula (I) below and/or hydrates thereof and/or salts thereof: in which formula (I): R represents an atom or group chosen from i) hydrogen, ii) carboxyl —C(O) OH, iii) linear or branched C1-C6 alkyl which is optionally substituted, preferably with at least one hydroxyl —OH radical, carboxyl —C(O)—OH radical or halogen radical such as Br; iv) optionally substituted phenyl, v) optionally substituted benzyl, iv) and v) preferably being optionally substituted with at least one —OH or —C(O) OH radical; vi) an indolyl radical and vii) an imidazolylmethyl radical and tautomers thereof such as with * representing the part linked to the rest of the molecule, the dicarbonyl compounds corresponding to formula (I) and/or hydrates thereof and/or salts thereof being present in an amount ranging from 3 to 15% by weight relative to the total weight of the composition, one or more cationic surfactants,one or more fatty substances, preferably non-liquid fatty substances, and preferably solid fatty substances, the non-liquid fatty substances being present in an amount ranging from 1% to 30% by weight relative to the total weight of the composition, the composition having a pH of less than or equal to 4. A subject of the invention is also a process for straightening keratin fibres, especially the hair, which comprises the application to the hair of the composition of the invention, followed by a straightening step using a straightening iron at a temperature of at least 150° C., preferably ranging from 150 to 250° C. The composition of the invention is stable. The composition of the invention and the process for treating keratin fibres using it allow good straightening of keratin fibres while limiting damage to these keratin fibres, even when the application of the composition is followed by a heat treatment, in particular using a hair-straightening iron, and have an appreciated wear quality, in particular without excessive vaporization of the composition at the time of straightening. The composition and the process for treating keratin fibres according to the invention also make it possible to limit the change in the colour of the fibres and also the problems of breaking of the fibres such as the hair. The composition and the process of the invention will also improve the physical properties of the hair, by reducing the frizziness effect in a long-lasting manner. In the text hereinbelow, the term “at least one” is equivalent to the term “one or more”. Preferably, the composition according to the invention comprises neither a colouring agent nor a reducing agent. According to the present invention, the term “colouring agents” means agents for colouring keratin fibres such as direct dyes, pigments or oxidation dye precursors (bases and couplers). If they are present, their content does not exceed 0.001% by weight relative to the total weight of the composition. Indeed, at such a content, only the composition would be dyed, i.e. no dyeing effect would be observed on the keratin fibres. It is recalled that oxidation dye precursors, oxidation bases and couplers are colourless or sparingly coloured compounds, which, via a condensation reaction in the presence of an oxidizing agent, give a coloured species. With regard to direct dyes, these compounds are coloured and have a certain affinity for keratin fibres. According to the present invention, the term “reducing agent” means an agent that is capable of reducing the disulfide bonds of the hair, such as compounds chosen from thiols, alkali metal sulfites, hydrides and phosphines. In the present invention, the dicarbonyl compounds of formula (I) may be in free form, but also in their hydrate forms or in the form of their salts, preferably in free form or in the form of hydrates. The salts may be salts derived from the interaction of the compounds of formula (I) with acids or bases, it being possible for the acids or bases to be of organic or mineral nature. Preferably, the salts are salts derived from the interaction of the compounds of formula (I) with bases. Mention will be made in particular of the salts of alkali metals or alkaline-earth metals and in particular the sodium salts. Preferably, the dicarbonyl compound(s) corresponding to formula (I) and/or hydrates thereof and/or salts thereof are chosen from the dicarbonyl compounds corresponding to formula (I) in which R represents i) a hydrogen atom or ii) a linear or branched C1-C6 alkyl group optionally substituted with a carboxyl group. More preferably, they are chosen from glyoxylic acid and pyruvic acid and hydrates thereof or salts thereof and more preferentially from glyoxylic acid and the hydrate forms of this compound. Mention may be made of glyoxylic acid and also the hydrate form thereof (HO)2CH—C(O)—OH, for instance the glyoxylic acid as a 50% aqueous solution sold by the company Merck. According to a particularly preferred embodiment, the compound of formula (I) is glyoxylic acid in hydrate form. According to one embodiment, the composition of the invention comprises from 5% to 15% of one or more dicarbonyl compounds corresponding to formula (I) and/or of hydrate forms thereof and/or salts thereof, preferably from 5% to 10% by weight relative to the total weight of the composition. As indicated above, the composition according to the invention comprises at least one cationic surfactant. The term “cationic surfactant” means a surfactant that is positively charged when it is contained in the composition according to the invention. This surfactant may bear one or more permanent positive charges or may contain one or more functions that are cationizable within the composition according to the invention. The cationic surfactant(s) are preferably chosen from optionally polyoxyalkylenated primary, secondary or tertiary fatty amines, or salts thereof, quaternary ammonium salts, and mixtures thereof.

Organopolysiloxanes are defined in greater detail in Walter Noll's Chemistry and Technology of Silicones (1968), Academic Press. They may be volatile or non-volatile. When they are volatile, the silicones are more particularly chosen from those having a boiling point of between 60° C. and 260° C., and more particularly still from: (i) cyclic polydialkylsiloxanes containing from 3 to 7 and preferably from 4 to 5 silicon atoms. These are, for example, octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane sold in particular under the name Volatile Silicone® 7207 by Union Carbide or Silbione® 70045 V2 by Rhodia, decamethylcyclopentasiloxane sold under the name Volatile Silicone® 7158 by Union Carbide, and Silbione® 70045 V5 by Rhodia, and mixtures thereof. Mention may also be made of cyclocopolymers of the dimethylsiloxane/methylalkylsiloxane type, such as Volatile Silicone® FZ 3109 sold by the company Union Carbide, of formula: Mention may also be made of mixtures of cyclic polydialkylsiloxanes with organosilicon compounds, such as the mixture of octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane and tetra(trimethylsilyl)pentaerythritol (50/50) and the mixture of octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane and oxy-1,1′-bis(2,2,2′,2′,3,3′-hexatrimethylsilyloxy)neopentane; (ii) linear volatile polydialkylsiloxanes containing 2 to 9 silicon atoms and having a viscosity of less than or equal to 5×106 m2/s at 25° C. An example is decamethyltetrasiloxane sold in particular under the name SH 200 by the company Toray Silicone. Silicones belonging to this category are also described in the article published in Cosmetics and Toiletries, Vol. 91, January 76, pp. 27-32, Todd & Byers, Volatile Silicone Fluids for Cosmetics. Use is preferably made of non-volatile polydialkylsiloxanes, polydialkylsiloxane gums and resins, polyorganosiloxanes modified with the organofunctional groups above, and mixtures thereof. These silicones are more particularly chosen from polydialkylsiloxanes, among which mention may be made mainly of polydimethylsiloxanes having trimethylsilyl end groups. The viscosity of the silicones is measured at 25° C. according to ASTM standard 445 Appendix C. Mention may be made, among these polydialkylsiloxanes, without implied limitation, of the following commercial products: the Silbione® oils of the 47 and 70 047 series or the Mirasil® oils sold by Rhodia, for instance the oil 70 047 V 500 000;the oils of the Mirasil® series sold by Rhodia;the oils of the 200 series from the company Dow Corning, such as DC200 with a viscosity of 60 000 mm2/s;the Viscasil® oils from General Electric and certain oils of the SF series (SF 96, SF 18) from General Electric.

The composition according to the invention may be obtained by mixing several compositions. The process of the invention comprises the application of the composition described previously, followed by a step of straightening the hair with an iron, preferably at a temperature of at least 150° C. The straightening iron is known in the prior art. It consists in straightening the hair with flat heating tongs, which are generally metallic. The straightening irons are generally used at a temperature ranging from 150 to 250° C. The process of the invention may comprise other intermediate steps aimed at improving the straightening of the hair. According to a particular embodiment, the process of the invention comprises the application of the composition of the invention to dry hair, and a time of contact of the composition with the hair ranging from 10 to 60 minutes and preferably from 20 to 40 minutes. After this leave-on time, straightening with a brush and with a hairdryer (blow-drying) is performed. The hair is then straightened with a straightening iron at a temperature ranging from 150 to 250° C. and preferably from 210 to 230° C. The process of the invention may comprise the application of other hair agents as a pretreatment or post-treatment. In particular, it may comprise the application of a conditioning care product as a post-treatment. According to another embodiment, the hair straightening process comprises a step of washing the hair and then of drying with a hairdryer before applying the composition of the invention. According to this particular embodiment, the steps described above are then encountered, such as the contact time of the composition, the straightening with a straightening iron, the application of a conditioning agent and the rinsing, all these steps possibly being performed independently of each other, blow-drying possibly being intercalated between the contact of the composition according to the invention and the straightening with the iron. According to a particular embodiment, the straightening with the straightening iron is performed in several passes on the hair, in general 8 to 10 passes. The process of the present invention is preferably performed without a step of permanent reshaping at basic pH or based on a reducing agent.

The compositions are applied to curly hair, which may be natural or dyed, or sensitized by a prior bleaching step at a rate of 1 g per 2 g of hair. After 15 minutes, the hair is rinsed, dried with a hairdryer (blow-drying) and then straightened by treating with flat tongs heated to 210° C. It is subsequently shampooed to examine the remanence of the straightening effects and of modification of the mechanical and cosmetic properties of the fibres. During the blow-drying before straightening with flat tongs, a small amount of evolution of fumes is observed. The compositions according to the invention make it possible to obtain good straightening properties in terms of curl relaxation, protection of the natural or artificial colour, resistance of the fibres to mechanical stresses (pulling, rubbing, twisting), in particular by limiting breakage, sheen, smooth feel and smooth look. These effects are also remanent with respect to hair maintenance products such as shampoos, hair conditioners and hair dyes.

Then 2.7 g of composition A was applied to one of the hair lock and 2.7 g of composition B was applied to another hair lock and 2.7 g of composition C was applied to another hair lock. After a leave-on time of 20 minutes on the hair, the locks were blow-dried with a hairdryer (brushing with 15 passes of a brush) and were then straightened with a straightening iron (10 passes). The locks were then washed with a shampoo and let dried naturally (spontaneous). Qualities of use and conditioning performances were improved by using composition A. In particular, the flat iron was easily applied on the hair lock treated with composition A and B. Hair was smoother and silkier after being treated by compositions A and B. The hair was more conditioned after being treated by composition B The hair locks treated with compositions A and B were easier to comb than the hair lock treated with composition C on humid and dry hair. Then, the hair locks were washed again with a second shampoo and then let dried naturally (spontaneous). Better lasting curl reduction was observed while increasing the amount of cetearyl alcohol. 1.
