FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention generally relates to artificial skeletal structures. More particularly, the present invention relates to extracellular matrix (ECM) based osteoinductive skeletal material and bioresorbable, osteoinductive and osteoconductive skeletal constructs formed therefrom. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION As is well known in the art, when bone is damaged or removed as a result of trauma or surgery, e.g., excision of a tumor, new bone must be regenerated or substituted with a prosthetic skeletal structure, e.g. skeletal prosthesis or construct, or bone substitute material. Ideally, the prosthetic skeletal structure and/or bone substitute material is derived from calcified autogenic bone material. However, the availability of autogenic bone material and the risks of allogenic bone initiating an immunologic rejection makes the use of natural bone material and structures formed therefrom impractical and expensive for widespread use. Various alternative materials have thus been developed to form bone substitute compositions and prosthetic skeletal constructs, such as calcium phosphate ceramic materials (i.e. bioceramics), composite materials, bone derivatives, metals, and natural and synthetic polymers. Calcium phosphate ceramic materials; particularly, hydroxyapatites (HAp) have been widely employed in prosthetic applications for several years. The suitability of HAp as a prosthetic material stems from the facts that it is relatively easy and cheap to manufacture, is nontoxic, and appears to attach well to calcified tissues. Moreover, HAp has the advantageous property of being able to conduct bone apposition, i.e. the bone remodeling process that initially establishes fixation of an uncemented prosthetic structure to adjacent bone. There are, however, several drawbacks and disadvantages associated with the use of calcium phosphate ceramic materials. Unsintered calcium phosphate prosthetic structures lack sufficient compressive strength and load bearing capacity to be of substantial benefit as a load bearing prosthesis. Further, sintered calcium phosphate ceramics, while able to bear higher compressive forces, are typically too brittle, and not of sufficient porosity to enable cellular and vascular infiltration of the prosthetic structure to the extent necessary to promote remodeling and resorbtion of the structure. Various metals; particularly, titanium and titanium alloys, have also been widely employed in prosthetic applications. Titanium is, of course, highly biocompatible and exhibits excellent mechanical properties. Metal and metal composite prostheses are typically rendered more biocompatible by coating the surface thereof with biocompatible materials, such as crystalline HAp, which has the further advantage of being able to serve as a pharmacological carrier medium. However, HAp crystals are not easily grown on the surface of metal prostheses; particularly, under the physiological conditions required to retain biological activity of some bioactive agents used in orthopedic applications. Various synthetic materials have also been employed to form prosthetic skeletal constructs. The most prevalent synthetic materials that are employed are mixtures of polymethylmetachlorite (PMMA) and benzoilperoxide. There are similarly several drawbacks and disadvantages associated with the use of synthetic materials. A major drawback is that synthetic materials do not degrade naturally in vivo. Thus, newly growing bone is obstructed by the artificial constructs, resulting in inflammed neighboring tissues. A further major drawback of synthetic materials is that many synthetic materials can, and in many instances will, induce or elicit an inflammatory response. There is thus a need to provide improved bone substitute material and bioresorbable skeletal constructs having sufficient compressive strength and load bearing capacity to be employed in load bearing applications without the drawbacks associated with metal, ceramic and polymeric materials. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide bone substitute material and bioresorbable skeletal constructs that overcome the foregoing and the other disadvantages associated with prior art bone substitution materials and prosthetic structures. It is another object of the present invention to provide a novel extracellular matrix (ECM) based osteoinductive, biodegradable bone substitute material that promotes biocompatible osteoanagenesis. It is another object of the present invention to provide a novel ECM based bone substitution material that is suitable for use in osteoanagenesis and bone morphogenesis. It is another object of the present invention to provide a novel ECM based bone substitution material that exhibits satisfactory biocompatibility, osteoinductivity, osteoconductivity, biodegradability, with freedom from immunogenicity and toxicity to tissues. It is yet another object of the present invention to provide artificial bioresorbable, skeletal constructs that promote angiogenesis. It is yet another object of the present invention to provide artificial bioresorbable, osteoconductive and osteoinductive skeletal constructs that promote osteoanagenesis. It is yet another object of the present invention to provide artificial bioresorbable, osteoconductive and osteoinductive skeletal constructs that function as delivery platforms for pharmacological agents and compositions. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention is directed to novel extracellular matrix (ECM) based osteoinductive, biodegradable bone substitute material that promotes osteoanagenesis and, in some aspects, angiogenesis, and porous, bioresorbable, osteoinductive and osteoconductive skeletal constructs formed therefrom.

DEFINITIONS The term “bioresorbable,” as used herein, means and includes a biocompatible material, composition or object that has the ability to be gradually integrated into a host. When used in the context of the skeletal constructs (or bone implants) of the invention, the term generally refers to the ability of at least a portion of a skeletal construct to gradually be replaced by natural bone, such replacement typically occurring naturally by the physiological process of bone remodeling. Thus, in the context of the presently described embodiments, the term “bioresorbable” is meant to include any material or process that is receptive to or typically associated with bone remodeling, including, but not limited to osteoblast and osteoclast activity, deposition and/or mineralization of new bone matrix, vascular and cellular infiltration and tissue ingrowth. The term “osteoanagenesis,” as used herein, means and includes the regeneration of bone tissue. The term “osteoconductive,” as used herein, means and includes a structure that facilitates or supports the growth of new bone tissue. Preferably, native osteoblasts and other components utilize the osteoconductive structure as a framework upon which to spread and generate new bone. The term “osteoinductive,” as used herein, means and includes a structure, material or composition that induces and/or supports the formation, development and growth of new bone, and/or the remodeling of existing bone. The term “osteogenic agent,” as used herein, means and includes an active agent that can elicit, facilitate and/or maintain the formation and growth of bone tissue. Many osteogenic agents function, at least in part, by stimulating or otherwise regulating the activity of osteoblast and/or osteoclasts. Exemplary osteogenic agents include, without limitation, certain polypeptide growth factors, such as, osteogenin, Insulin-like Growth Factor (IGF)-1, TGF-β1, TGF-β2, TGF-β3, TGF-β4, TGF-β5, osteoinductive factor (OIF), basic Fibroblast Growth Factor (bFGF), acidic Fibroblast Growth Factor (aFGF), Platelet-Derived Growth Factor (PDGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), Growth Hormone (GH), osteogenic protein-1 (OP-1) and any one of the many known bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs), including but not limited to BMP-1, BMP-2, BMP-2A, BMP-2B, BMP-3, BMP-3b, BMP-4, BMP-5, BMP-6, BMP-7, BMP-8, BMP-8b, BMP-9, BMP-10, BMP-11, BMP-12, BMP-13, BMP-14, BMP-15. The terms “cortical portion” and “cortical” are used interchangeably herein, and mean and include a portion of a skeletal construct that functions in a load-bearing capacity and whose function and structure are substantially similar to that of naturally occurring cortical or compact bone. The terms “cancellous portion” and “cancellous” are used interchangeably herein, and mean and include portions of a skeletal construct that is more porous than the cortical portion, and whose structure and function of which are substantially similar to that of naturally occurring trabecular or spongy bone. Due to its high degree of porosity, a cancellous portion has a relatively high surface area and can support tissue ingrowth and infiltration of body fluids and cells. The terms “bone morphogenic protein” and “BMP” are used interchangeably herein, and mean and include a group of polypeptide growth factors belonging to the TGF-β superfamily. BMPs are widely expressed in many tissues, though many function, at least in part, by influencing the formation, maintenance, structure or remodeling of bone or other calcified tissues. The term “bone protein,” as used herein, means and includes a polypeptide factor that supports the growth, remodeling, mineralization or maintenance of calcified tissues. Bone proteins are typically components of or associate with cells and structures that form extracellular matrix structures. Typical examples of bone proteins include, without limitation, alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, bone sialoprotein (BSP) and osteocalcin in secreted phosphoprotein (SPP)-1, type I collagen, type IV collagen, fibronectin, osteonectin, thrombospondin, matrix-gla-protein, SPARC, alkaline phosphatase and osteopontin. The terms “extracellular matrix,” “extracellular matrix material” and “ECM” are used interchangeably herein, and mean and include a collagen-rich substance that is found in between cells in animal tissue and serves as a structural element in tissues. According to the invention, extracellular matrix material can be isolated or derived from various mammalian tissue sources including, without limitation, small intestinal submucosa, stomach submucosa, large intestinal tissue, urinary bladder submucosa, cardiac tissue, e.g., pericardium, epicardium, endocardium and/or myocardium tissue, dura tissue, skin tissue, lung tissue, kidney tissue, pancreatic tissue, prostate tissue, mesothelial tissue, nervous system tissue, fetal tissue, placenta tissue, ureter tissue, cardiovascular tissue, e.g., veins and arteries, heart valves with or without their attached vessels, tissue surrounding the roots of developing teeth, tissue surrounding growing bone, and combinations thereof.

The term “angiogenesis,” as used herein, means a physiologic process involving the growth of new blood vessels from pre-existing blood vessels. The term “neovascularization,” as used herein, means and includes the formation of functional vascular networks that can be perfused by blood or blood components. Neovascularization includes angiogenesis, budding angiogenesis, intussuceptive angiogenesis, sprouting angiogenesis, therapeutic angiogenesis and vasculogenesis. The terms “pharmacological agent,” “active agent,” “drug” and “active agent formulation” are used interchangeably herein, and mean and include an agent, drug, compound, composition of matter or mixture thereof, including its formulation, which provides some therapeutic, often beneficial, effect.
