The present invention relates to new diacylamidobiphenylenedioxydialkyl carboxylic acids and to the process of making the same. It is an object of the invention to provide a process of preparing diacylamidobiphenylenedioxydialkyl carboxylic acid compounds which is inexpensive and easy to carry out, and which results in good yields. Another object is the preparation of a 4,4'-diacetamido-3,3'-biphenylenedioxydialkyl carboxylic acid from a dialkoxybenzidine. Still another object is the preparation of 4,4"-diacetamido-3,3'-diphenylenedioxvdiacetic acid from dianisidine. A still further object is the production of diaminobiphenol as an intermediate in the production of diacylamidobiphenylenedioxydialkylcarboxylic acid. Jn accordance with the present invention a dialkoxy benzidine is dealkylated in any suitable manner and the resulting diaminobiphenol is converted to the dihydroxybiacylanilide by treatment with a suitable acylating agent, and is then treated with an aqueous alkaline compound, and the resulting solution is treated with a halogenoalkylcarboxylic acid in the presence of an acid binding agent to produce the new diacylamidobiphenylenedioxydialkylcarboxylic acid Examples of new compounds produced in accordance with the present invention are 4,4'-diacetamido-3,3"-biphenylenedioxydiacetic acid and 4,4' diacetamido-2,2'-biphenylenedioxydiacetic acid, which are white powders slightly soluble in water and soluble in alkali and are stable against oxidaPrice : ONE RUPEE. tion in handling. The new compounds may be represented by the following generic formula : HOOCRO ORCOOH wherein R is a hydrocarbon radical, such as for example -CH-, -CH 2 CH -, -CH(CoH,)-, -CH=CH=CH -, and the like and Ac represents the residue of a carboxylic acid, such as for example, acetyl-, propionyl-, benzoyl-, and the like. The new compounds are valuable intermediates for dyestuffs. The dealkylation may be carried out in any known manner. Preferably it is carried out by the action of aluminium chloride, and we prefer to employ in this reaction a diluent which imparts sufficient fluiditv to the reacnon mass. Preferably, we employ as the diluent a normally liquid inert solvent which does not interfere with the reaction, but if desired, any suitable inorganic salt may be employed as the diluent. However, the diluent may be omitted if desired. The dealkylation reaction preferably carried out at an elevated temperature, and it wil! be understood that the diluent selected should provide a sufficiently fluid mass at the reaction temperature. Examples of suitable liquid solvent diluents are benzene, nitrobenzene, toluene, xylene, and of inorganic salt diluents are sodium chloride, potassium chloride and the like. The dialkoxybenzidine may be employed in the form of either the free base or its salt and the proportion of aluminium chloride employed preferably is about four times that of the dialkoxybenzidine compound, and the ratio may be even greater if desired, as the excess does not entail any important disadvantages. The diaminobiphenol obtained in the dealkylation reaction preferably isolated by pouring into water, which results in hydrolyzing any complex compound that may be present, and where a liquid solvent is employed, the solvent may be steam distilled off. The diaminobiphenol then may be isolated in any suitable manner from the resulting aqueous solution. For preparing the diacylamidobiphenylenedioxydicarboxylic acid therefrom it converted into the amide of an organic acid in any suitable manner. The resulting product then is dissolved in an aqueous solution of a suitable alkaline compound and reacted with a halogenoalkylcarboxylic acid to produce the diacylamidobiphenylenedioxydicarboxylic acid, which is precipitated out by acidification with a mineral acid. The amide mentioned above may be produced, for example, by reaction with an acid anhydride, acid chloride, or the like. As examples of suitable acid radicals there may be mentioned for example, propionyl-, butyryl-, or benzoylradicals and the like. Examples of the halogenoalkylcarboxylic acids which may be employed are chlorobutyric acid, chlorophenylacetic acid and the like. We prefer to employ chloroacetic acid although other halogenoacetic acids, for example, bromoacetic acid, may be used. The preferred starting material in the process of the present invention bianisidine dihydrochloride, as an increased yield is obtained over the process employing bianisidine. However, the homologous alkoxy compounds of benzidine, such as biphenetidine dihydrochloride and the like may be used as starting material. The dealkylation thereof preferably is carried ut under anhydrous conditions by heating with aluminium chloride at any suitable temperature. The reaction mass then is poured into water, and the diaminobipheno! is precipitated in the form of its mineral acid salt. The salt then is treated to liberate the free base which is reacted with acetic anhydride to form the dihydroxybiacetanilide which is then reacted with a suitable alkaline compound, such as caustic soda solution. The resulting solution then is reacted with chloroacetic acid in an acid binding medium, such as caustic soda, to produce the diacetamidobiphenylenedioxydiacetic acid. The invention will be described in greater detail in connection with the following examples which are given to illustrate the invention. Temperatures are centigrade, and parts are by weight. Example 1 parts of bianisidine dihydrochloride are charged into a suitable reaction vessel containing about 330 parts of toluene, and 210 parts of aluminum chloride are added under good agitation. The reacnon mass then heated refluxing temperature for about one-quarter hour, and then the reaction mass is cooled to about 80 ° and 25 parts of bianisidine dihydrochloride are added after which the reaction mass is again heated to produce a slight refluxing. After about one-quarter hour, the charge again cooled about 80° and 25 parts of bianisidine dihydrochloride are added and the temperature again raised to refluxing where it is held for about two hours, after which time the reaction is complete. The lowering of the temperature before each addition of aluminium chloride is preferred to prevent violent reaction. During the reaction methyl chloride is formed and escapes from the reaction mass. The reaction mass then is cooled and poured into water which results in hydrolyzing any aluminium chloride complex present, and the toluene is steam distilled off with the addition of a small amount of hydrochloric acid to keep the aluminium salt in solution. The resulting aqueous solution, which is substantially free of toluene, then treated with sodium sulfate to precipitate the dihydroxybenzidine in the form of its sulfate which is then filtered off. The yield is above If desired, instead of proceeding in steps as described in the above example, all the ingredients may be mixed together and reacted according to the following example : Example 2 parts bianisidine dihydroch!oride and 109.5 parts of aluminium chloride are added to about 215 parts of toluene in a suitable vessel, and the temperature of the reaction mass is then raised to refluxing temperature where kept until the reaction is complete. The dihydroxybenzidine can be recovered by following the procedure described in Example 1. In employing the step by step procedure of Example 1, the proportion of toluene and aluminium chloride may be varied to produce a reaction mass of proper fluidity according to the following example: Example 3 The reaction mass of about 97.5 parts bianisidine dihydrochlordide and parts of aluminium chloride in about 650 parts of toluene is heated to re fluxing temperature for a short time, then cooled to about 80°C. and 48.8. parts bianisidine hydrochloride are added. The temperature then again raised re fluxing where it is kept for a short time, and then the temperature reduced to about 80° and another portion of 48.7 parts bianisidine dihydrochloride added. The reaction mass is then heated refluxing temperature where it is kept until the reaction is completed, whereupon the dihydroxybenzidine may be recovered as above described. If desired the-aluminium chloride and the bianisidine dihydrochloride may be added stepwise according to the following example: Example 4 A mixture of 97.5 parts of bianisidine dihvdrochloride and 205 parts of aluminium chloride in 650 parts of toluene are heated to refluxing temperature and after a short time the reaction mass is cooled to about and there then added 97.5 parts of bianisidine dihydrochloride and parts of aluminium chloride. The reaction mass then is again heated refluxing temperature where it is held until the reaction is completed, whereupon the dihydroxybenzidine may be recovered as above described. An inorganic salt may be employed as the diluent according to the following example : Example A mixture of 96 parts sodium chloride and 218 parts aluminium chloride melted together at about 160° and the temperature then is raised about 195 to 200°, and there is then added 65 parts bianisidine dihydrochloride. The reaction mass is maintained at this temperature with agitation for about two hours and is then drowned in about 2,000 parts of water There is then added about 84 parts concentrated hydrochloric acid and about 300 parts of sodium sulphate is added to precipitate the dihydroxybenzidine in the form of its sulphate. The mass is cooled, filtered and washed with a 10 o sodium sulphate solution. The dihydroxy benzidine may be converted into the diacetvl derivative in any suitable manner, for example, by the following procedure: Example 6 78.5 parts, 3,3"-dihydroxybenzidine sulphate are sludged with about parts water at about 90° with the addition of about 26.5 parts sodium carbonate. After cooling the mass to about room temperature, there added about 64 parts acetic anhydride which forms the dihydroxybiacetanilide which is then filtered and washed with water, and becomes the startling material in the following process: Example 7 300 grams of 3,3'-dihydroxy-4X-diacetanilide are introduced into grams of 10% caustic soda solution in a suitable reaction vessel at a temperature of about 5 to 10°C., and the mass is stirred unti! a clear solution obtained. There is then introduced 236.5 grams of monochloroacetic acid. The reaction mass is then refluxed at about 102° for about two hours and is then cooled to about 80 to 85°. A small amount of activated charcoal is then added, the reaction mass is filtered, and residue is washed with water, the washings being combined u ith the filtrate. The filtrate acidified with hydrochloric acid, cooled, again filtered, and the filter cake washed. The filter cake, which consists of 4,4'-diacetamido-3.3--biphenylenedioxydiacetic acid, when dry, is a white powder slightly soluble in alkali. In a similar manner, starting with m-dianisidine there is obtained 2,2'-dihydroxy-4,4'-biacetanilide which may be transformed to 4,4'-diacetamido-2,2'-biphenylenedioxydiacetic acid. 1.
