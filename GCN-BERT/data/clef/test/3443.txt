Step 2: Preparation of 2-methyl-5-(piperazine-1-yl)-1H-imidazo[4,5-b]pyridine
Analogous to the process for preparing Compound d in Step 4 in Example 1, Compound g is deprotected by reacting with trifluoroacetic acid to produce Compound h: 2-methyl-5-(piperazine-1-yl)-1H-imidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (320 mg, yield 82%).
