CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/172,039, filed on Apr. 23, 2009; the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention This invention relates to novel diamide compounds having muscarinic receptor antagonist and β2 adrenergic receptor agonist activity. The invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising such compounds, processes and intermediates for preparing such compounds, and methods of using such compounds as bronchodilating agents to treat pulmonary disorders. 2. State of the Art Pulmonary disorders, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma, are commonly treated with bronchodilators. See, for example, Ziedalski et al., Advances in the Management of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, Expert Opin. Pharmacother., (2003) 4(7), 1063-1082; Tashkin et al., The Role of Long-Acting Bronchodilators in the Management of Stable COPD, Chest, 2004: 125; 249-259; and Donohue, Therapeutic Responses in Asthma and COPD: Bronchodilators, Chest, 2004: 126; 125-137. Such bronchodilators are typically administered by inhalation using a hand-held inhaler device. Commonly-used bronchodilating agents typically have muscarinic receptor antagonist activity (i.e., anticholinergic agents) or β2 adrenergic receptor (adrenoceptor) agonist activity. More recently, compounds having both muscarinic receptor antagonist and β2 adrenergic receptor agonist (MABA) activities in the same molecule have been reported. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 7,141,671, issued Nov. 28, 2006, discloses biphenyl compounds having both muscarinic receptor antagonist and β2 adrenergic receptor agonist activities. Dual-acting MABA compounds are expected to be particularly useful for treating pulmonary disorders because such compounds can be formulated and administered as a single therapeutic agent but, once administered, they provide bronchodilation through two distinct, and possibly synergistic, modes of action. Additionally, MABA compounds have the potential to be combined with an anti-inflammatory agent, such as an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS), to provide triple therapy in a single inhaler using only two therapeutic agents (MABA+ICS). Thus, a need exists for new MABA compounds. In particular, a need exists for new MABA compounds that are highly effective as both a muscarinic receptor antagonist and a β2 adrenergic receptor agonist. Additionally, MABA compounds having a long duration of action, i.e., compounds that provide significant bronchodilation for at least about 24 hours after administration by inhalation, may be particularly useful for treating certain pulmonary disorders where once-daily administration of a bronchodilating agent is desired. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to novel diamide compounds having both muscarinic receptor antagonist and β2 adrenergic receptor agonist activities. Such compounds produce bronchodilation when administered to a mammal by inhalation. In some cases, compounds of this invention have been found to possess a long duration of action, i.e., to produce bronchodilation for at least about 24 hours after administration. Accordingly, compounds of this invention are expected to be useful and advantageous as bronchodilating agents for treating pulmonary disorders.

Such compounds contain one or more chiral centers and therefore, such compounds (and intermediates thereof) can exist as racemic mixtures; pure stereoisomers (i.e., enantiomers or diastereomers); stereoisomer-enriched mixtures and the like. Chiral compounds shown or named herein without a defined stereochemistry at a chiral center are intended to include any or all possible stereoisomer variations at the undefined stereocenter unless otherwise indicated. The depiction or naming of a particular stereoisomer means the indicated stereocenter has the designated stereochemistry with the understanding that minor amounts of other stereoisomers may also be present unless otherwise indicated, provided that the utility of the depicted or named compound is not eliminated by the presence of another stereoisomer. Compounds of formula I also contain several basic groups (e.g., amino groups) and therefore, such compounds can exist as the free base or in various salt forms, such a mono-protonated salt form or a di-protonated salt form or mixtures thereof. All such forms are included within the scope of this invention, unless otherwise indicated. This invention also includes isotopically-labeled compounds of formula I, i.e., compounds of formula I where an atom has been replaced or enriched with an atom having the same atomic number but an atomic mass different from the atomic mass that predominates in nature.

All other terms used herein are intended to have their ordinary meaning as understood by those of ordinary skill in the art to which they pertain. General Synthetic Procedures Compounds of this invention, and intermediates thereof, can be prepared according to the following general methods and procedures using commercially-available or routinely-prepared starting materials and reagents. The substituents and variables (e.g., R1, R2, Y, a, b, etc.) used in the following schemes have the same meanings as those defined elsewhere herein unless otherwise indicated. Additionally, compounds having an acidic or basic atom or functional group may be used or may be produced as a salt unless otherwise indicated (in some cases, the use of a salt in a particular reaction will require conversion of the salt to a non-salt form, e.g., a free base, using routine procedures before conducting the reaction). Scheme 1 illustrates a typical procedure for preparing compounds of formula (where R6 is hydrogen): wherein G1 is —CHO or —CH2C(O)R5; and P1 is a hydroxyl-protecting group, such as tert-butyldimethylsilyl. In this procedure, compound 1 is reacted with about 0.95 to about 1.5 molar equivalents of compound 2 in the presence of a reducing agent to afford compound 3. Any suitable reducing agent may be used in this reaction including, by way of illustration, a metal hydride reagent, such as sodium borohydride, sodium triacetoxyborohydride, sodium cyanoborohydride and the like, or hydrogen and a metal catalyst, such as palladium on carbon, and the like. This reaction is typically conducted at a temperature ranging from about −20° C. to about 30° C. (e.g., about 0° C. to about 5° C.) for about 1 hour to about 6 hours or until the reaction is substantially complete. Typically, this reaction is conducted in a diluent, such as dichloromethane (DCM), dichloroethane and the like. Optionally, the diluent may contain a protic solvent, such as methanol and the like. Upon completion of the reaction, the product is typically isolated using conventional procedures, such as extraction, recrystallization, chromatography and the like. Alternatively, if desired, the reaction mixture containing compound 3 can be used directly in the next step of the synthesis without further isolation or purification. Compound 3 is then deprotected to provide a compound of formula 1. The particular conditions used to deprotect compound 3 will depend on the protecting group employed. For example, when P1 is a silyl protecting group, such as tert-butyldimethylsilyl, tert-butyldiphenylsilyl, diphenylmethylsilyl, di-tert-butylmethylsilyl, tert-butoxydiphenylsilyl, and the like (i.e., a compound of formula 3a as defined herein), this deprotection reaction is typically conducted by contacting compound 3 with a source of fluoride ion. In a particular embodiment, the source of fluoride ion is triethylamine trihydrofluoride. Other suitable sources of fluoride ion include tetrabutylammonium fluoride, potassium fluoride with 18-crown-6, hydrogen fluoride, pyridine hydrofluoride, and the like. This reaction is typically conducted at a temperature ranging from about 0° C. to about 50° C., (e.g., about 10° C. to about 25° C.) for about 24 to about 72 hours or until the reaction is substantially complete. Typically, this reaction is conducted in a diluent, such as DCM, dichloroethane and the like. Upon completion of the reaction, the product is typically isolated using conventional procedures, such as extraction, recrystallization, chromatography and the like. Compounds of formula 1 are typically prepared by deprotecting the corresponding acetal or ketal intermediate. For example, when G1 is —CHO, compounds of formula 1 are typically prepared by deprotecting an intermediate of formula 4a: wherein P2a and P2b are selected independently from C1-6 alkyl, or P2a and P2b are joined to form C2-6 alkylene, typically C2-4 alkylene. Similarly, when G1 is —CH2C(O)R5, compounds of formula 1 are typically prepared by deprotecting an intermediate of formula 4b: wherein P3a and P3b are selected independently from C1-6 alkyl, or P3a and P3b are joined to form C2-6 alkylene, typically C2-4 alkylene. Deprotection of compound 4a or 4b is typically conducted by reacting 4a or 4b with aqueous acid to hydrolyze the acetal or ketal group and provide the corresponding aldehyde or ketone compound 1. Any suitable acid can be employed in this reaction including, by way of example, hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, methanesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid and the like. The hydrolysis reaction is typically conducted at a temperature ranging from about 0° C. to about 30° C. (e.g., about 20° C. to about 25° C.) for about 1 to about 6 hours or until the reaction is substantially complete. Typically, this reaction is conducted in a diluent, such as methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, dichloromethane/ethanol, acetonitrile and the like. Upon completion of the reaction, the product is typically isolated using conventional procedures, such as extraction, recrystallization, chromatography and the like. Alternatively, the reaction mixture containing compound 1 can be used directly in the next step of the synthesis. Compounds of formula 4a or 4b are typically prepared by coupling a compound of formula 5: with a compound of formula 6a or 6b: wherein G2 is —NH2 and G3 is —COOH; or G2 is —COOH and G3 is —NH2. The coupling reaction between compound 5 and compound 6a or 6b to form compound 4a or 4b is typically conducted using a carboxylic acid—amine coupling reagent. Any suitable carboxylic acid—amine coupling reagent may be used in this reaction including, by way of illustration, benzotriazole-1-yl-oxy-tris-(dimethylamino)phosphonium hexafluorophosphate (BOP); N,N-carbonyldiimidazole (CDI); dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC); 3-(diethoxyphosphoryloxy)-1,2,3-benzotriazin-4(3H)-one (DEPBT); 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethyllaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC HCl); 2-(7-aza-1H-benzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HATU); 2-(1H-benzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU); 2-(6-chloro-1H-benzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethylaminium hexafluorophosphate (HCTU); 1-hydroxy-7-azabenzotriazole (HOAt); N-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt); benzotriazole-1-yl-oxy-tris-pyrrolidinophosphonium hexafluorophosphate (PyBOP); bromo-tris-pyrrolidinophosphonium hexafluorophosphate (PyBrOP); O-(7-azabenzotriazole-1-yl)-N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate (TATU); 2-(1H-benzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate (TBTU); N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-O-(3,4-dihydro-4-oxo-1,2,3-benzotriazin-3-yl)uranium tetrafluoroborate (TDBTU); O—(N-succinimidyl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyl uranium tetrafluoroborate (TSTU); and combinations thereof, such as EDC and HOBt. The coupling reaction is typically conducted by reacting about 0.95 to about 1.5 molar equivalents of the amine compound (5, when G2 is —NH2; or 6a or 6b when G3 is —NH2) with the carboxylic acid (5, when G2 is —COOH; or 6a or 6b when G3 is —COOH) in the presence of the coupling reagent. The coupling reagent is typically used in an amount ranging from about 1.0 to about 1.5 molar equivalents relative to the carboxylic acid. Generally, this reaction is conducted in the presence of a hindered amine, such as diisopropylethylamine (DIEA), N-methylmorpholine (NMM), collidine, 2,3,5,6-tetramethylpyridine (TEMP), 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-dimethylaminopyridine (DBDMAP) and the like, in a diluent, such as dichloromethane, tetrahydrofuran, 1,4-dioxane, acetonitrile, dimethylformamide, dimethyl acetamide, N-methylpyrrolidone or mixtures thereof. The reaction is typically conducted at a temperature ranging from about −20° C. to about 50° C. (e.g., about 20° C. to about 25° C.) for about 1 to about 30 hours or until the reaction is substantially complete. Upon completion of the reaction, the product is typically isolated using conventional procedures, such as extraction, recrystallization, chromatography, and the like. Compounds of formula 5 are typically prepared by coupling a compound of formula 7: with a compound of formula 8a, 8b or 8c: wherein P4 is a carboxyl-protecting group (such as C1-6 alkyl, including methyl, ethyl, n-propyl and the like; or benzyl); and P5 is an amino-protecting group (such as BOC, Fmoc, Cbz and the like). When a compound of formula 8c is used, the nitro group is subsequently reduced to an amino group using standard reagents and procedures, such as zinc, tin or iron metal and acid (such as acetic acid, hydrochloric acid and the like), or catalytic hydrogenation. In this embodiment, p is typically 0. Compounds of formula 8a, 8b and 8c are commercially available, known in the art or can be prepared using routine variations of procedures known in the art. Representative compounds of formula 8a include, by way of example, methyl 4-(methylamino)butyrate, methyl 5-(methylamino)pentanoate, methyl 3-(methylamino)benzoate, methyl 4-(methylamino)benzoate, methyl 3-(methylamino)-4-methylbenzoate, methyl [3-(methylamino)phenyl]acetate and the like.

Representative compounds of formula 8c include, by way of example, N-methyl-3-nitroaniline, N-methyl-4-nitroaniline, N-ethyl-3-nitroaniline, N-ethyl-4-nitroaniline, and the like. The carboxylic acid—amine coupling reaction between compound 7 and compound 8a or 8b to form compound 5 is typically conducted using the reagents and reaction conditions described herein for coupling a carboxylic acid and an amine (e.g., compound 5 and compound 6a or 6b). Upon completion of the reaction, the product is typically isolated using conventional procedures, such as extraction, recrystallization, chromatography, and the like. Compounds of formula 7 are typically prepared by reacting a compound of formula 9: with about 0.95 to about 1.5 molar equivalents of acrylic acid. This reaction is typically conducted in a diluent, such as dichloromethane, at a temperature ranging from about 20° C. to about 70° C. (e.g., about 50° C.) for about 6 to about 30 hours or until the reaction is substantially complete. Upon completion of the reaction, the product is typically isolated using conventional procedures, such as extraction, recrystallization, chromatography, and the like. Compounds of formula 9 are known in the art or can be prepared using routine variations of procedures known in the art. For example, procedures for preparing such compounds are found in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. U.S. 2004/0167167 A1 and R. Naito et al., Chem. Pharm. Bull., 46(8) 1286-1294 (1998). By way of illustration, compounds of formula 9 are typically prepared by reacting a compound of formula 10: with an alcohol of formula 11: wherein P6 is an amino-protecting group, such as benzyl, BOC, Fmoc, Cbz and the like. Representative compounds of formula 10 include, by way of example, 2-(phenyl)phenyl isocyanate, 2-(phenyl)-5-methylphenyl isocyanate, 2-(3-chlorophenyl)-4,6-difluorophenyl isocyanate, 2-(phenyl)-6-fluorophenyl isocyanate, 2-(phenyl)-5-bromophenyl isocyanate, 2-(4-bromophenyl)-5-bromophenyl isocyanate, 2-(phenyl)-4-methoxyphenyl isocyanate, 2-(4-methoxyphenyl)phenyl isocyanate, 2-(phenyl)-5-methoxyphenyl isocyanate, and the like. Representative compounds of formula 11 include, by way of example, 4-hydroxy-1-benzylpiperidine, 4-hydroxypiperidine-1-carboxylic acid tert-butyl ester, 4-hydroxypiperidine-1-carboxylic acid 9H-fluoren-9-ylmethyl ester, 4-hydroxy-4-methyl-1-benzylpiperidine, 2-benzyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-5-ol, 2-benzyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-5-ol, 8-benzyl-8-azabicyclo[3.2.1]oct-6-en-3-ol, 3-benzyl-3-azabicyclo[3.2.1]octan-8-ol, 8-benzyl-8-azabicyclo[3.2.1]octan-3-ol, 3-benzyl-3-azabicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-9-ol, 9-benzyl-9-azabicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3-ol, 8-benzylnortropine, 8-benzylnorpseudotropine, and the like. This reaction is typically conducted by reacting 10 with about 0.95 to about 1.2 molar equivalents of 11 at a temperature ranging from about 20° C. to about 100° C. (e.g., about 60° C. to about 80° C.) for about 6 to about 24 hours or until the reaction is substantially complete. If desired, this reaction can be conducted in a diluent, such as dichloromethane, toluene and the like. Alternatively, this reaction can be conducted in the absence of a diluent. Upon completion of the reaction, the product is typically isolated using conventional procedures, such as extraction, recrystallization, chromatography and the like. Alternatively, the reaction mixture is used directly in the next step of the synthesis without isolation of the product. The amino-protecting group, P6, is then removed using conventional procedures to afford compound 9. For example, when P6 is a benzyl group, the deprotection reaction is typically conducted using hydrogen or ammonium formate, in the presence of a catalyst, such as a palladium catalyst. Representative catalysts include, by way of illustration, palladium on carbon, palladium hydroxide on carbon and the like. This reaction is typically conducted at a temperature ranging from about 20° C. to about 50° C. (e.g., about 40° C.) for about 6 to about 24 hours or until the reaction is substantially complete. Typically, this reaction is conducted in a diluent, such as methanol, ethanol, isopropanol and the like. Upon completion of the reaction, compound 9 is typically isolated using conventional procedures, such as extraction, recrystallization, chromatography and the like. Compounds of formula 2 are known in the art or can be prepared from commercially available starting materials and reagents using known procedures. For example, the preparation of a compound of formula 2, where P1 is tert-butyldimethylsilyl, is described in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2006/0035931, published Feb. 16, 2006. Other protecting groups that can be employed for P1 include, for example, dimethylisopropylsilyl, diethylisopropylsilyl, dimethylhexylsilyl, tert-butyldiphenylsilyl, diphenylmethylsilyl and the like. Additionally, if desired, the hydroxyl group of 2 can also be protected, i.e., a compound of formula 2a can be used: where P1a is a hydroxyl protecting group, such as benzyl group or 4-methoxybenzyl. For example, the preparation of a compound of formula 2a, where P1 is tert-butyldimethylsilyl and the hydroxyl group is protected as a 4-methoxybenzyl group is described in WO 2008/096129. When 2a is used, intermediates such as 3, 12 and the like, will typically contain the P1a group. The P1a is subsequently removed using conventional procedures and reagents. For example, when P1a is a benzyl group, the deprotection reaction is typically conducted using hydrogen or ammonium formate, in the presence of a catalyst, such as a palladium catalyst. When P1a is 4-methoxybenzyl, this group can be removed under acidic hydrolysis conditions, such as 30% TFA in DCM. Alternatively, compounds of formula I are prepared by coupling a compound of formula 5 with a compound of formula 12: wherein G5 is —COOH (when G2 is —NH2); or G5 is —NH2 (when G2 is —COOH). The carboxylic acid—amine coupling reaction between compound 5 and compound 12 is typically conducted using the reagents and reaction conditions described herein for coupling a carboxylic acid and an amine (e.g., compound 5 and compound 6a or 6b). Upon completion of the reaction, the product is typically isolated using conventional procedures, such as extraction, recrystallization, chromatography, and the like. Deprotection of the resulting product (e.g., removal of P1) using standard reagents and conditions then provides a compound of formula I. Compounds of formula 12 are prepared by reacting a compound of formula 2 with a compound of formula 13a or 13b: in the presence of a reducing agent; wherein G5P is selected from: —COOP7, where P7 is a carboxyl-protecting group (such as C1-6 alkyl, including methyl, ethyl, n-propyl and the like; or benzyl); and —NHP8, where P8 is an amino-protecting group (such as BOC, Fmoc, Cbz and the like). Alternatively, G5P is a nitro group, or G5P-(CH2)q— is NC—(CH2)q-1—, wherein the nitro group or the cyano group is subsequently reduced to an amino group using standard reagents and procedures. The reaction of compound 2 with compound 13a or 13b is typically conducted using the reagents and reaction conditions described herein for the reductive alkylation of an amine with an aldehyde or ketone (e.g., compound 1 and compound 2). Upon completion of the reaction, the product is typically isolated using conventional procedures, such as extraction, recrystallization, chromatography, and the like. Compounds of formula 13a and 13b are commercially available, known in the art or can be prepared using routine variations of procedures known in the art. Representative compounds of formula 13a include, by way of example, methyl 3-formylbenzoate, methyl 4-formylbenzoate, methyl(3-formylphenyl)acetate, methyl(4-formylphenyl)acetate, methyl 3-(3-formylphenyl)propionate, methyl 3-(4-formylphenyl)propionate, (3-formylphenyl)carbamic acid tert-butyl ester, (4-formylphenyl)carbamic acid tert-butyl ester, (3-formylbenzyl)carbamic acid tert-butyl ester, (4-formylbenzyl)carbamic acid tert-butyl ester, [2-(3-formylphenyl)ethyl]carbamic acid tert-butyl ester, [2-(4-formylphenyl)ethyl]carbamic acid tert-butyl ester, and the like. Representative compounds of formula 13b include, by way of example, methyl 3-(2-oxoethyl)benzoate, methyl 4-(2-oxoethyl)benzoate, methyl [3-(2-oxoethyl)phenyl]acetate, methyl [4-(2-oxoethyl)phenyl]acetate, methyl 3-[3-(2-oxoethyl)phenyl]propionate, methyl 3-[4-(2-oxoethyl)phenyl]propionate, 2-(3-tert-butoxycarbonylaminophenyl)-acetaldehyde, 2-(4-tert-butoxycarbonylaminophenyl)-acetaldehyde, 2-[3-(tert-butoxycarbonylaminomethyl)phenyl]acetaldehyde, 2-[4-(tert-butoxycarbonylaminomethyl)phenyl]acetaldehyde, 2-{3-[2-(tert-butoxycarbonylamino)-ethyl]phenyl}acetaldehyde, 2-{4-[2-(tert-butoxycarbonylamino)ethyl]phenyl}-acetaldehyde, and the like. Intermediate compounds of formula 12 can also be prepared by reacting a compound of formula 14: with a compound of formula 15: wherein L1 is a leaving group, such as chloro, bromo, iodo, tosyl, nosyl and the like; and P9 is a hydroxyl-protecting group, such as benzyl and the like. The resulting product is then partially deprotected (by removal of P7 or P8, and P9) to provide a compound of formula 12. The reaction of compound 14 with compound 15 is typically conducted by reacting compound 14 with about 0.95 to about 1.1 molar equivalents of compound 15 in the presence of an excess amount of a base. Representative bases include, for example, sodium bicarbonate, sodium carbonate, potassium bicarbonate, potassium carbonate, trialkylamines (such as triethylamine, diisopropylethylamine, etc.) and the like. This reaction is typically conducted at a temperature ranging from about 20° C. to about 120° C., (e.g., about 100° C.) for about 2 to about 24 hours or until the reaction is substantially complete. Typically, this reaction is conducted in a diluent, such as N-methyl-pyrrolidinone, acetonitrile and the like. If desired, this reaction can be facilitated by subjecting the reaction mixture to microwave radiation (e.g., 300 watts). The reaction can also be conducted neat, i.e., in the absence of a diluent. Additionally, if desired, an excess of amine 14 can be used instead of another base. Upon completion of the reaction, the product is typically isolated using conventional procedures, such as extraction, recrystallization, chromatography and the like. The resulting product is then partially deprotected (i.e., P7 or P8 is removed; and P9 is removed, if desired) to provide a compound of formula 12. The particular conditions used to remove the protecting groups will depend on the particular groups employed. For example, when P7 is C1-6 alkyl, such groups are typically removed by hydrolysis of the ester moiety with a base, such as, lithium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide and the like, in a diluent, such as a mixture of methanol and water and the like. This reaction is typically conducted at ambient temperature for about 30 minutes to about 24 hours or until the reaction is substantially complete. When P8 is a tert-butoxycarbonyl group, this group is typically removed under acidic hydrolysis conditions, such as 20% trifluoroacetic acid in DCM at ambient temperature. When P9 is a benzyl group, this group is readily removed by hydrogenolysis. Typically, this reaction is conducted by contacting the compound with hydrogen in the presence of a catalyst, such as a palladium catalyst. Representative catalysts include palladium hydroxide on carbon, palladium on carbon, and the like. Generally, this debenzylation reaction is conducted in the presence of an acid, such as acetic acid, formic acid and the like. This reaction is typically conducted at a temperature ranging from about 10° C. to about 50° C. (e.g. about 25° C.) for about 6 to about 24 hours or until the reaction is substantially complete. Typically, this reaction is conducted in a diluent, such as methanol, ethanol and the like. Upon completion of the reaction, the product can be isolated using conventional procedures, such as extraction, recrystallization, chromatography and the like, or used directly in the next reaction. Compounds of formula 14 are known in the art or can be prepared from commercially available starting materials and reagents using known procedures. For example, compounds of formula 14 can be prepared by reacting 13a or 13b with a benzyl amine under reductive alkylation conditions and then removing the benzyl group by hydrogenolysis to afford the compound of formula 14. Representative benzyl amines that may be used include, benzyl amine, (S)-1-phenylethylamine, (R)-1-phenylethylamine, and the like. In particular, chiral benzyl amines are useful for preparing intermediates of formula 14 where R5 is present (i.e., e=1) and the carbon atom to which R5 is attached has a particular stereochemistry (i.e., R or S). Additionally, compounds of formula 14 where R5 and R6 are independently methyl or ethyl (i.e., not hydrogen) are known in the art or can be prepared using routine procedures as exemplified by the teachings in U.S. Patent Application Publication 2005/0171147 A1, published Aug. 4, 2005; U.S. Patent Application Publication 2005/0277632 A1, published Dec. 15, 2005; WO 2005/092861 A1, published Oct. 6, 2005; and the like. Compounds of formula 15 are also known in the art or can be prepared from commercially available starting materials and reagents using known procedures. For example, the preparation of a compound of formula 15, where L1 is bromo; P1 is tert-butyldimethylsilyl, and P9 is benzyl is described in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2006/0035931, published Feb. 16, 2006. Alternatively, compounds of formula 12 are prepared by reacting a compound of formula 16: with a compound of formula 17: wherein L2 is a leaving group, such as chloro, bromo, iodo, tosyl, nosyl and the like; and P10 is an amino-protecting group, such as benzyl and the like. In this embodiment, R5 and R6 when present, are typically hydrogen. This reaction is conducted under conditions similar to those described for the reaction of 14 and 15. Compounds of formula 16 and 17 are known in the art or can be prepared from commercially available starting materials and reagents using known procedures. For example, the preparation of a compound of formula 17, where P1 is tert-butyldimethylsilyl, P9 is benzyl, and P10 is benzyl is described in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2006/0035931, published Feb. 16, 2006. If desired, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of a compound of formula I is prepared by contacting the free base form of the compound of formula I with a pharmaceutically acceptable acid. Further details regarding specific reaction conditions and other procedures for preparing representative compounds of this invention or intermediates thereof are described in the Examples set forth herein. Pharmaceutical Compositions, Combinations and Formulations Compounds of formula I can be formulated with a carrier or excipient to form a pharmaceutical composition or formulation. Such pharmaceutical compositions will typically contain a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula I. In some cases, however, the pharmaceutical composition may contain more than a therapeutically effective amount, e.g., a concentrated bulk composition; or less than a therapeutically effective amount, e.g., individual unit doses designed for multiple administrations to achieve a therapeutically effective amount. The pharmaceutical composition will typically contain from about 0.01 to about 95 percent by weight of a compound of formula I including, for example, from about 0.01 to about 30 percent by weight; or from about 0.01 to about 10 percent by weight; or from about 0.01 to about 1 percent by weight. Such pharmaceutical compositions are typically prepared using conventional carriers or excipients. The choice of a particular carrier or excipient, or combinations of carriers or excipients, will depend on various factors such as the mode of administration for the composition, or the medical condition or disease state being treated. Many suitable carriers and excipients for preparing pharmaceutical compositions are commercially available. For example, such materials can be purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, Mo.). Procedures and materials for preparing pharmaceutical compositions suitable for a particular mode of administration are described in the pharmaceutical arts including, for example, Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 20th Edition, Lippincott Williams & White, Baltimore, Md. (2000); and H. C. Ansel et al., Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms and Drug Delivery Systems, 7th Edition, Lippincott Williams & White, Baltimore, Md. (1999). Representative examples of materials which can serve as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include, but are not limited to, the following: (1) sugars, such as lactose, glucose and sucrose; (2) starches, such as corn starch and potato starch; (3) cellulose, and its derivatives, such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose and cellulose acetate; (4) powdered tragacanth; (5) malt; (6) gelatin; (7) talc; (8) excipients, such as cocoa butter and suppository waxes; (9) oils, such as peanut oil, cottonseed oil, safflower oil, sesame oil, olive oil, corn oil and soybean oil; (10) glycols, such as propylene glycol; (11) polyols, such as glycerin, sorbitol, mannitol and polyethylene glycol; (12) esters, such as ethyl oleate and ethyl laurate; (13) agar; (14) buffering agents, such as magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide; (15) alginic acid; (16) pyrogen-free water; (17) isotonic saline; (18) Ringer's solution; (19) ethyl alcohol; (20) phosphate buffer solutions; (21) compressed propellant gases, such as chlorofluorocarbons and hydrofluorocarbons; and (22) other non-toxic compatible substances employed in pharmaceutical compositions. The pharmaceutical composition is typically prepared by thoroughly and intimately mixing or blending a compound of formula I with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and any optional ingredients. If necessary or desired, the resulting uniformly blended mixture can then be shaped or loaded into tablets, capsules, pills, canisters, cartridges, dispensers and the like using conventional procedures and equipment. In one embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition is suitable for inhaled administration. Pharmaceutical compositions for inhaled administration will typically be in the form of an aerosol or a powder. Such compositions are generally administered using well-known delivery devices, such as a nebulizer inhaler, a metered-dose inhaler (MDI), a dry powder inhaler (DPI) or a similar delivery device. In a particular embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition comprising the therapeutic agent is administered by inhalation using a nebulizer inhaler. Such nebulizer devices typically produce a stream of high velocity air that causes the pharmaceutical composition comprising the therapeutic agent to spray as a mist that is carried into the patient's respiratory tract. Accordingly, when formulated for use in a nebulizer inhaler, the therapeutic agent is typically dissolved in a suitable carrier to form a solution. Alternatively, the therapeutic agent can be micronized and combined with a suitable carrier to form a suspension of micronized particles. Nebulizer devices suitable for administering therapeutic agents by inhalation are described in the art or such devices are commercially available. For example, representative nebulizer devices or products include the Respimat Softmist Inhalaler (Boehringer Ingelheim); the AERx Pulmonary Delivery System (Aradigm Corp.); the PARI LC Plus Reusable Nebulizer (Pari GmbH); and the like. A representative pharmaceutical composition for use in a nebulizer inhaler comprises an isotonic aqueous solution comprising from about 0.05 μg/mL to about 10 mg/mL of a compound of formula I. In one embodiment, the solution has a pH of about 4 to about 6. In another particular embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition comprising the therapeutic agent is administered by inhalation using a dry powder inhaler. Such dry powder inhalers typically administer the therapeutic agent as a free-flowing powder that is dispersed in a patient's air-stream during inspiration. In order to achieve a free-flowing powder, the therapeutic agent is typically formulated with a suitable excipient such as lactose, starch, mannitol, dextrose, polylactic acid (PLA), polylactide-co-glycolide (PLGA) or combinations thereof. Typically, the therapeutic agent is micronized and combined with a suitable carrier to form a blend suitable for inhalation. Accordingly, in one embodiment, the compound of formula I is in micronized form. A representative pharmaceutical composition for use in a dry powder inhaler comprises dry milled lactose and micronized particles of a compound of formula I. Such a dry powder formulation can be made, for example, by combining the lactose with the therapeutic agent and then dry blending the components. Alternatively, if desired, the therapeutic agent can be formulated without an excipient. The pharmaceutical composition is then typically loaded into a dry powder dispenser, or into inhalation cartridges or capsules for use with a dry powder delivery device. Dry powder inhaler delivery devices suitable for administering therapeutic agents by inhalation are described in the art or such devices are commercially available. For example, representative dry powder inhaler delivery devices or products include Aeolizer (Novartis); Airmax (IVAX); ClickHaler (Innovata Biomed); Diskhaler (GlaxoSmithKline); Diskus/Accuhaler (GlaxoSmithKline); Easyhaler (Orion Pharma); Eclipse (Aventis); FlowCaps (Hovione); Handihaler (Boehringer Ingelheim); Pulvinal (Chiesi); Rotahaler (GlaxoSmithKline); SkyeHaler/Certihaler (SkyePharma); Twisthaler (Schering-Plough); Turbuhaler (AstraZeneca); Ultrahaler (Aventis); and the like. In yet another particular embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition comprising the therapeutic agent is administered by inhalation using a metered-dose inhaler. Such metered-dose inhalers typically discharge a measured amount of the therapeutic agent using a compressed propellant gas. Accordingly, pharmaceutical compositions administered using a metered-dose inhaler typically comprise a solution or suspension of the therapeutic agent in a liquefied propellant. Any suitable liquefied propellant may be employed including hydrofluoroalkanes (HFAs), such as 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane (HFA 134a) and 1,1,1,2,3,3,3-heptafluoro-n-propane, (HFA 227); and chlorofluorocarbons, such as CCl3F. In a particular embodiment, the propellant is hydrofluoroalkanes. In some embodiments, the hydrofluoroalkane formulation contains a co-solvent, such as ethanol or pentane, and/or a surfactant, such as sorbitan trioleate, oleic acid, lecithin, and glycerin. A representative pharmaceutical composition for use in a metered-dose inhaler comprises from about 0.01% to about 5% by weight of a compound of formula 1; from about 0% to about 20% by weight ethanol; and from about 0% to about 5% by weight surfactant; with the remainder being an HFA propellant. Such compositions are typically prepared by adding chilled or pressurized hydrofluoroalkane to a suitable container containing the therapeutic agent, ethanol (if present) and the surfactant (if present). To prepare a suspension, the therapeutic agent is micronized and then combined with the propellant. The formulation is then loaded into an aerosol canister, which typically forms a portion of a metered-dose inhaler device. Metered-dose inhaler devices suitable for administering therapeutic agents by inhalation are described in the art or such devices are commercially available. For example, representative metered-dose inhaler devices or products include AeroBid Inhaler System (Forest Pharmaceuticals); Atrovent Inhalation Aerosol (Boehringer Ingelheim); Flovent (GlaxoSmithKline); Maxair Inhaler (3M); Proventil Inhaler (Schering); Serevent Inhalation Aerosol (GlaxoSmithKline); and the like. In another embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition is suitable for oral administration. Pharmaceutical compositions for oral administration may be in the form of capsules, tablets, pills, lozenges, cachets, dragees, powders, granules; or as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous or non-aqueous liquid; or as an oil-in-water or water-in-oil liquid emulsion; or as an elixir or syrup; and the like; each containing a predetermined amount of a compound of the embodiments as an active ingredient. When intended for oral administration in a solid dosage form (i.e., as capsules, tablets, pills and the like), the pharmaceutical composition will typically comprise a compound of formula I and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, such as sodium citrate or dicalcium phosphate. Optionally or alternatively, such solid dosage forms may also comprise: (1) fillers or extenders, such as starches, lactose, sucrose, glucose, mannitol, and/or silicic acid; (2) binders, such as carboxymethylcellulose, alginates, gelatin, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, sucrose and/or acacia; (3) humectants, such as glycerol; (4) disintegrating agents, such as agar-agar, calcium carbonate, potato or tapioca starch, alginic acid, certain silicates, and/or sodium carbonate; (5) solution retarding agents, such as paraffin; (6) absorption accelerators, such as quaternary ammonium compounds; (7) wetting agents, such as cetyl alcohol and/or glycerol monostearate; (8) absorbents, such as kaolin and/or bentonite clay; (9) lubricants, such as talc, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, solid polyethylene glycols, sodium lauryl sulfate, and/or mixtures thereof; (10) coloring agents; and (11) buffering agents. Release agents, wetting agents, coating agents, sweetening, flavoring and perfuming agents, preservatives and antioxidants can also be present in the pharmaceutical composition. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable antioxidants include: (1) water-soluble antioxidants, such as ascorbic acid, cysteine hydrochloride, sodium bisulfate, sodium metabisulfate sodium sulfite and the like; (2) oil-soluble antioxidants, such as ascorbyl palmitate, butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), lecithin, propyl gallate, alpha-tocopherol, and the like; and (3) metal-chelating agents, such as citric acid, ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), sorbitol, tartaric acid, phosphoric acid, and the like. Coating agents for tablets, capsules, pills and like, include those used for enteric coatings, such as cellulose acetate phthalate (CAP), polyvinyl acetate phthalate (PVAP), hydroxypropyl methylcellulose phthalate, methacrylic acid-methacrylic acid ester copolymers, cellulose acetate trimellitate (CAT), carboxymethyl ethyl cellulose (CMEC), hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose acetate succinate (HPMCAS), and the like. If desired, the pharmaceutical composition may also be formulated to provide slow or controlled release of the active ingredient using, by way of example, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose in varying proportions; or other polymer matrices, liposomes and/or microspheres. Additionally, the pharmaceutical composition may optionally contain an opacifying agent and may be formulated so that the active ingredient released primarily in a certain portion of the gastrointestinal tract or in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions which can be used include polymeric substances and waxes. The active ingredient or a pharmaceutical composition containing the active ingredients can also be in micro-encapsulated form. Suitable liquid dosage forms for oral administration include, by way of illustration, pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, microemulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and elixirs. Such liquid dosage forms typically comprise the active ingredient and an inert diluent, such as, for example, water or other solvents, solubilizing agents and emulsifiers, such as ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, oils (esp., cottonseed, groundnut, corn, germ, olive, castor and sesame oils), glycerol, tetrahydrofuryl alcohol, polyethylene glycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan, and mixtures thereof. Suspensions, in addition to the active ingredient, may contain suspending agents such as, for example, ethoxylated isostearyl alcohols, polyoxyethylene sorbitol and sorbitan esters, microcrystalline cellulose, aluminium metahydroxide, bentonite, agar-agar and tragacanth, and mixtures thereof. When intended for oral administration, the pharmaceutical composition may be packaged in a unit dosage form. The term “unit dosage form” means a physically discrete unit suitable for dosing a patient, i.e., each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active agent calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect either alone or in combination with one or more additional units. For example, such a unit dosage form may be a capsule, tablet, pill, and the like. The compounds of formula I can also be administered transdermally using known transdermal delivery systems and excipients. For example, a compound of the embodiments can be admixed with permeation enhancers, such as propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol monolaurate, azacycloalkan-2-ones and the like, and incorporated into a patch or similar delivery system. Additional excipients including gelling agents, emulsifiers and buffers, may be used in such transdermal compositions if desired. Additionally, a compound of formula I can be administered parenterally, i.e., intravenously, subcutaneously or intramuscularly. For parenteral administration, a compound of formula I is typically dissolved in a carrier acceptable for parenteral administration, such as sterile water, saline, vegetable oil and the like. By way of illustration, an intravenous composition typically comprises a sterile aqueous solution of a compound of formula I, wherein the solution has a pH in the range of about 4 to about 7. If desired, a compound of formula I may be administered in combination with one or more other therapeutic agents. In this aspect of the invention, a compound of formula I is either physically mixed with the other therapeutic agent to form a composition containing both agents; or each agent is present in separate and distinct compositions which are administered to the patient simultaneously or sequentially. For example, a compound of formula I can be combined with second therapeutic agent using conventional procedures and equipment to form a composition comprising a compound of formula I and a second therapeutic agent. Additionally, the therapeutic agents may be combined with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier to form a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of formula I, a second therapeutic agent and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In this embodiment, the components of the composition are typically mixed or blended to create a physical mixture. The physical mixture is then administered in a therapeutically effective amount using any of the routes described herein. Alternatively, the therapeutic agents may remain separate and distinct before administration to the patient. In this embodiment, the therapeutic agents are not physically mixed together before administration but are administered simultaneously or sequentially as separate compositions. For example, a compound of formula I can be administered by inhalation simultaneously or sequentially with another therapeutic agent using an inhalation delivery device that employs separate compartments (e.g. blister packs) for each therapeutic agent. Alternatively, the combination may be administered using separate delivery devices, i.e., one delivery device for each therapeutic agent. Additionally, the therapeutic agents can be delivered by different routes of administration, i.e., one by inhalation and the other by oral administration. Any therapeutic agent compatible with the compounds of formula I may be used in combination with such compounds. In a particular embodiment, the second therapeutic agent is one that is effectively administered by inhalation. By way of illustration, representative types of therapeutic agents that may be used with the compounds of the embodiments include, but are not limited to, anti-inflammatory agents, such as steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (including corticosteroids and glucocorticoids), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs), and PDE4 inhibitors; bronchodilators, such as PDE3 inhibitors, adenosine 2b modulators and β2 adrenergic receptor agonists; antiinfective agents, such as Gram-positive antibiotics, Gram-negative antibiotics, and antiviral agents; antihistamines; protease inhibitors; afferent blockers, such as D2 agonists and neurokinin modulators; and muscarinic receptor antagonists (antichlolinergic agents). Numerous examples of such therapeutic agents are well known in the art. Suitable doses for the other therapeutic agents administered in combination with a compound of the embodiments are typically in the range of about 0.05 μg/day to about 500 mg/day. In a particular embodiment, a compound of formula I is administered in combination with a steroidal anti-inflammatory agent. Representative examples of steroidal anti-inflammatory agents that can be used in combination with the compounds of the embodiments include, but are not limited to, beclomethasone dipropionate; budesonide; butixocort propionate; 20R-16α,17α-[butylidenebis(oxy)]-6α,9α-difluoro-11β-hydroxy-17β-(methylthio)androsta-4-en-3-one (RPR-106541); ciclesonide; dexamethasone; 6α,9α-difluoro-17α-[(2-furanylcarbonyl)oxy]-11β-hydroxy-16α-methyl-3-oxoandrosta-1,4-diene-17β-carbothioic acid S-fluoromethyl ester; 6α,9α-difluoro-11β-hydroxy-16α-methyl-17α-[(4-methytl-1,3-thiazole-5-carbonyl)oxy]-3-oxoandrosta-1,4-diene-17β-carbothioic acid S-fluoromethyl ester; 6α,9α-difluoro-11β-hydroxy-16α-methyl-3-oxo-17α-propionyloxyandrosta-1,4-diene-17β-carbothioic acid (S)-(2-oxotetrahydrofuran-3S-yl) ester; flunisolide; fluticasone furoate; fluticasone propionate; methyl prednisolone; mometasone furoate; prednisolone; prednisone; rofleponide; ST-126; triamcinolone acetonide; and the like, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts or solvates thereof. Such steroidal anti-inflammatory agents are commercially available or can be prepared using conventional procedures and reagents. For example, the preparation and use of steroidal anti-inflammatory agents is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,537,983, issued Mar. 25, 2003; U.S. Pat. No. 6,750,210 B2, issued Jun. 15, 2004; U.S. Pat. No. 6,759,398 B2, issued Jul. 6, 2004; U.S. Pat. No. 6,858,596 B2, issued Feb. 22, 2005; U.S. Pat. No. 7,101,866 B2, issued Sep. 5, 2006; and the references cited therein. When employed, the steroidal anti-inflammatory agent is typically administered in an amount that produces a therapeutically beneficial effect when co-administered with a compound of the embodiments. Typically, the steroidal anti-inflammatory agent will be administered in an amount sufficient to provide from about 0.05 μg to about 500 μg per dose. The following examples illustrate representative pharmaceutical compositions: A. Dry Powder Composition A micronized compound of formula I (100 mg) is blended with milled lactose (25 g) (e.g., lactose in which not greater than about 85% of the particles have a MMD of about 60 μm to about 90 μm and not less than 15% of the particles have a MMD of less then 15 μm). This blended mixture is then loaded into individual blisters of a peelable blister pack in an amount sufficient to provide about 10 μg to about 500 μg of the compound of formula I per dose. The contents of the blisters are administered using a dry powder inhaler. B. Dry Powder Composition A micronized compound of formula I (1 g) is blended with milled lactose (200 g) to form a bulk composition having a weight ratio of compound to milled lactose of 1:200. The blended composition is packed into a dry powder inhalation device capable of delivering between about 10 μg to about 500 μg of the compound of formula I per dose. C. Dry Powder Composition A micronized compound of formula I (100 mg) and a micronized steroidal anti-inflammatory agent (500 mg) are blended with milled lactose (30 g). This blended mixture is then loaded into individual blisters of a peelable blister pack in an amount sufficient to provide about 10 μg to about 500 μg of the compound of formula I per dose. The contents of the blisters are administered using a dry powder inhaler. D. Metered-Dose Inhaler Composition A micronized compound of formula I (10 g) is dispersed in a solution prepared by dissolving lecithin (0.2 g) in demineralized water (200 mL). The resulting suspension is spray dried and then micronized to form a micronized composition comprising particles having a mean diameter less than about 1.5 μm. The micronized composition is then loaded into metered-dose inhaler cartridges containing pressurized 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane in an amount sufficient to provide about 10 μg to about 500 μg of the compound of formula I per dose when administered by the metered dose inhaler. E. Nebulizer Composition A compound of formula I (25 mg) is dissolved in citrate buffered (pH 5) isotonic saline (125 mL). The mixture is stirred and sonicated until the compound is dissolved. The pH of the solution is checked and adjusted, if necessary, to pH 5 by slowly adding aqueous IN sodium hydroxide. The solution is administered using a nebulizer device that provides about 10 μg to about 500 μg of the compound of formula I per dose. F. Hard Gelatin Capsules A compound of formula I (50 g), spray-dried lactose (440 g) and magnesium stearate (10 g) are thoroughly blended. The resulting composition is loaded into a hard gelatin capsule (500 mg of composition per capsule) that is administered orally. G. Injectable Composition A compound of formula I (0.2 g) is blended with 0.4 M sodium acetate buffer solution (2.0 mL). The pH of the resulting solution is adjusted to pH 4 using 0.5 N aqueous hydrochloric acid or 0.5 N aqueous sodium hydroxide, as necessary, and then sufficient water for injection is added to provide a total volume of 20 mL. The mixture is then filtered through a sterile filter (0.22 micron) to provide a sterile solution suitable for administration by injection. Utility The compounds of formula I possess both muscarinic receptor antagonist activity and β2 adrenergic receptor agonist and therefore, such compounds are expected to be useful as therapeutic agents for treating medical conditions mediated by muscarinic receptors and/or β2 adrenergic receptors, i.e., medical conditions that are ameliorated or moderated by treatment with a muscarinic receptor antagonist or a β2 adrenergic receptor agonist. Such medical conditions are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art as exemplified by the teachings of Eglen et al., Muscarinic Receptor Subtypes: Pharmacology and Therapeutic Potential, DN&P 10(8), 462-469 (1997); Emilien et al., Current Therapeutic Uses and Potential of beta-Adrenoceptor Agonists and Antagonists, European J. Clinical Pharm., 53(6), 389-404 (1998); and the references cited therein. Such medical conditions include, by way of example, pulmonary disorders or diseases associated with reversible airway obstruction, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (e.g., chronic and wheezy bronchitis and emphysema), asthma, pulmonary fibrosis, adult/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), chronic respiratory obstruction, bronchial hyperactivity, allergic rhinitis, pneumoconiosis (such as aluminosis, anthracosis, asbestosis, chalicosis, ptilosis, siderosis, silicosis, tabacosis and byssinosis), and other pulmonary disorders of unknown origin which benefit from therapeutic agent-induced bronchodilation. Additionally, other conditions known to be treatable, at least in part, with a muscarinic receptor antagonist or a β2 adrenergic receptor agonist include premature labor, depression, congestive heart failure, skin diseases (e.g., inflammatory, allergic, psoriatic and proliferative skin diseases), conditions where lowering peptic acidity is desirable (e.g., peptic and gastric ulceration) and muscle wasting disease. Accordingly, one embodiment of this invention relates to a method for treating a pulmonary disorder, the method comprising administering to a patient in need of treatment a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula I. When used to treat a pulmonary disorder, the compounds of formula I will typically be administered by inhalation in multiple doses per day, in a single dose per day or a single dose per week. Generally, the dose for treating a pulmonary disorder is expected to range from about 10 μg/day to about 1500 μg/day; such as about 25 μg/day to about 1000 μg/day; including about 50 μg/day to about 500 μg/day. In one of its method aspects, this invention relates to a method of treating chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma, the method comprising administering to a patient a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula I. Generally, the dose for treating COPD or asthma is expected to range from about 10 μg/day to about 1500 μg/day. In particular, this method includes alleviating the symptoms of COPD or asthma. The term “COPD” is understood by those of ordinary skill in the art to include a variety of respiratory conditions, including chronic obstructive bronchitis and emphysema, as exemplified by the teachings of Barnes, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, N. Engl. J. Med., 2000: 343:269-78, and the references cited therein. When administered by inhalation, the compounds of formula I typically have the effect of producing bronchodilation. Accordingly, in another of its method aspects, the invention relates to a method of producing bronchodilation in a mammal, the method comprising administering to the mammal a bronchodilation-producing amount of a compound of formula I. Generally, the dose for producing bronchodilation will range from about 10 μg/day to about 1500 μg/day. When used as a therapeutic agent, the compounds of formula 1 are optionally administered in combination with another therapeutic agent or agents. In particular, by administering the compounds of formula I with a steroidal anti-inflammatory agent, triple therapy, i.e., muscarinic receptor antagonist activity, β2 adrenergic receptor agonist activity, and anti-inflammatory activity, is expected using only two therapeutic agents. Since pharmaceutical compositions (and combinations) containing two therapeutic agents are typically easier to formulate and/or administer compared to compositions containing three therapeutic agents, such two component compositions provide a significant advantage over compositions containing three therapeutic agents. Accordingly, in particular embodiments, the pharmaceutical compositions, combinations and methods of this invention further comprise a steroidal anti-inflammatory agent. Since compounds of formula I possess both muscarinic receptor antagonist and activity β2 adrenergic agonist activity, such compounds are also useful as research tools for investigating or studying biological systems or samples having muscarinic receptors or β2 adrenergic receptors. Additionally, such compounds are useful in screening assays to discover, for example, new compounds having both muscarinic receptor antagonist activity and adrenergic agonist activity. The biological systems or samples employed may comprise muscarinic receptors or β2 adrenergic receptors or both. Any suitable biological system or sample having muscarinic receptors and/or β2 adrenergic receptors may be employed in such studies which may be conducted either in vitro or in vivo. Representative biological systems or samples suitable for such studies include, but are not limited to, cells, cellular extracts, plasma membranes, tissue samples, mammals (such as mice, rats, guinea pigs, rabbits, dogs, pigs, etc.), and the like. When used as a research tool, a biological system or sample comprising a muscarinic receptor and/or a β2 adrenergic receptor is typically contacted with a muscarinic receptor-antagonizing or β2 adrenergic receptor-agonizing amount of a compound of formula I. The effects on the biological system or sample produced by the compound are then determined or measured using conventional procedures and equipment, such as by measuring binding in a radioligand binding assays or ligand-mediated changes in a functional assay or by determining the amount of bronchoprotection provided by the compound in a bronchoprotection assay in a mammal. Representative functional assays include ligand-mediated changes in intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP); ligand-mediated changes in activity of the enzyme adenylyl cyclase (which synthesizes cAMP); ligand-mediated changes in incorporation of guanosine 5′-O-(thio)triphosphate ([35S]GTP S) into isolated membranes via receptor catalyzed exchange of [35S]GTP S for GDP; ligand-mediated changes in free intracellular calcium ions (measured, for example, with a fluorescence-linked imaging plate reader or FLIPR® from Molecular Devices, Inc.); and the like. Compounds of formula I are expected to antagonize or decrease the activation of a muscarinic receptor or agonize or cause activation of a β2 adrenergic receptor and in the functional assays listed herein or in assays of a similar nature. The compounds of formula I will typically be used in these studies at a concentration ranging from about 0.1 nanomolar to about 100 nanomolar. Additionally, the compounds of formula I can be used as research tools for evaluating other chemical compounds. In this aspect, a compound of formula I is used as a standard in an assay to allow comparison of the results obtained with a test compound and the compound of formula I. For example, muscarinic receptor and/or β2 adrenergic receptor binding data (as determined, for example, by in vitro radioligand displacement assays) for a test compound or a group of test compounds is compared to the muscarinic receptor and/or β2 adrenergic receptor binding data for a compound of formula I to identify those test compounds that have desirable binding, i.e. test compounds having binding about equal or superior to a compound of formula I, if any. Alternatively, for example, bronchoprotective effects can be determined for test compounds and a compound of formula I in a bronchoprotection assay in a mammal and this data compared to identify test compounds providing about equal or superior bronchoprotective effects or duration of action. This aspect includes, as separate embodiments, both (i) the generation of comparison data (using the appropriate assays) and (ii) the analysis of the test data to identify test compounds of interest. The properties and utility of the compounds of formula I can be demonstrated using various in vitro and in vivo assays known to those of ordinary skill in the art. For example, representative assays are described in further detail in the following Examples.

Biological Assays and Preparations Example A Cell Culture and Membrane Preparation from Cells Expressing Human M1, M2, M3 and M4 Muscarinic Receptors CHO cell lines stably expressing cloned human hM1, hM2, hM3 and hM4 muscarinic receptor subtypes, respectively, were grown to near confluency in Hams F-12 media supplemented with 10% FBS and 250 μg/mL Geneticin. The cells were grown in a 5% CO2, 37° C. incubator and lifted with 2 mM EDTA in dPBS. Cells were collected by 5 minute centrifugation at 650×g, and cell pellets were either stored frozen at −80° C. or membranes were prepared immediately for use. For membrane preparation, cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer and homogenized with a Polytron PT-2100 tissue disrupter (Kinematica AG; 20 seconds×2 bursts). Crude membranes were centrifuged at 40,000×g for 15 minutes at 4° C. The membrane pellet was then resuspended with re-suspension buffer and homogenized again with the Polytron tissue disrupter. The protein concentration of the membrane suspension was determined by the method described in Lowry et al., 1951, Journal of Biochemistry, 193, 265. All membranes were stored frozen in aliquots at −80° C. or used immediately. Aliquots of prepared hM5 receptor membranes were purchased from PerkinElmer, Inc. (Wellesley, Mass.) and were stored at −80° C. until use. Example B Radioligand Binding Assay for Muscarinic Receptors Radioligand binding assays for cloned muscarinic receptors were performed in 96-well microtiter plates in a total assay volume of 100 μL. CHO cell membranes stably expressing either the hM1, hM2, hM3, hM4 or hM5 muscarinic subtype were diluted in assay buffer to the following specific target protein concentrations (μg/well): 10 μg for hM1, 10-15 μg for hM2, 10-20 μg for hM3, 10-20 μg for hM4, and 10-12 μg for hM5 to get similar signals (cpm). The membranes were briefly homogenized using a Polytron tissue disruptor (10 seconds) prior to assay plate addition. Saturation binding studies for determining KD values of the radioligand were performed using L-[N-methyl-3H]scopolamine methyl chloride ([3H]-NMS) (TRK666, 84.0 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Buckinghamshire, England) at concentrations ranging from 0.001 nM to 20 nM. Displacement assays for determination of Ki values of test compounds were performed with [3H]-NMS at 1 nM and eleven different test compound concentrations. The test compounds were initially dissolved to a concentration of 400 μM in dilution buffer and then serially diluted 5× with dilution buffer to final concentrations ranging from 10 pM to 100 μM. The order of addition and volumes added to the assay plates were as follows: 25 μL radioligand, 25 μL diluted test compound, and 50 μL membranes. Assay plates were incubated for 6 hours at 37° C. Binding reactions were terminated by rapid filtration over GF/B glass fiber filter plates (PerkinElmer, Inc.) pre-treated in 1% BSA. Filter plates were rinsed three times with wash buffer (10 mM HEPES) to remove unbound radioactivity. The plates were then air-dried and 50 μL Microscint-20 liquid scintillation fluid (PerkinElmer, Inc.) were added to each well. The plates were then counted in a PerkinElmer Topcount liquid scintillation counter (PerkinElmer, Inc.). Binding data were analyzed by nonlinear regression analysis with the GraphPad Prism Software package (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, Calif.) using the one-site competition model. Ki values for test compounds were calculated from observed IC50 values and the KD value of the radioligand using the Cheng-Prusoff equation (Cheng Y; Prusoff W H. (1973) Biochemical Pharmacology, 22(23):3099-108). Ki values were converted to pKi values to determine the geometric mean and 95% confidence intervals. These summary statistics were then converted back to K; values for data reporting. In this assay, a lower Ki value means the test compound has a higher binding affinity for the receptor. hM3 receptor binding (Ki) data for compounds of this invention are shown in Table III. Example C Cell Culture and Membrane Preparation from Cells Expressing Human β1, β2 or β3 Adrenergic Receptors Human embryonic kidney (HEK-293) cell lines stably expressing cloned human β1 and β2 adrenergic receptors or Chinese hamster ovarian (CHO) cell lines stably expressing cloned human β3 adrenergic receptors were grown to near confluency in DMEM or Hams F-12 media with 10% FBS in the presence of 500 μg/mL Geneticin. The cell monolayer was lifted with 2 mM EDTA in PBS. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 1,000 rpm, and cell pellets were either stored frozen at −80° C. or membranes were prepared immediately for use. For preparation of β1 and β2 receptor expressing membranes, cell pellets were re-suspended in lysis buffer (10 mM HEPES/HCl, 10 mM EDTA, pH 7.4 at 4° C.) and homogenized using a tight-fitting Dounce glass homogenizer (30 strokes) on ice. For the more protease-sensitive β3 receptor expressing membranes, cell pellets were homogenated in lysis buffer (10 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.4) supplemented with one tablet of “Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Tablets with 2 mM EDTA” per 50 mL buffer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, Ind.). The homogenate was centrifuged at 20,000×g, and the resulting pellet was washed once with lysis buffer by re-suspension and centrifugation as described herein. The final pellet was then re-suspended in ice-cold binding assay buffer (75 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.4, 12.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA). The protein concentration of the membrane suspension was determined by the methods described in Lowry et al., 1951, Journal of Biological Chemistry, 193, 265; and Bradford, Analytical Biochemistry, 1976, 72, 248-54. All membranes were stored frozen in aliquots at −80° C. or used immediately. Example D Assay for Determining Adrenergic Receptor Agonist Potency cAMP assays were performed in a radioimmunoassay format using the Flashplate Adenylyl Cyclase Activation Assay System with [125I]-cAMP (NEN SMP004, PerkinElmer Life Sciences Inc., Boston, Mass.), according to the manufacturers instructions. For this assay, HEK-293 cell lines stably expressing cloned human β1 or β2 receptors were grown to near confluency in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and Geneticin (500 μg/mL); or CHO-K1 cell lines stably expressing cloned human β3 adrenergic receptors were grown to near confluency in Hams F-12 media supplemented with 10% FBS and Geneticin (250 μg/mL). Cells were rinsed with PBS and detached in dPBS (Dulbecco's Phosphate Buffered Saline, without CaCl2 and MgCl2) containing 2 mM EDTA or Trypsin-EDTA solution (0.05% trypsin/0.53 mM EDTA). After counting cells in Coulter cell counter, cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 1,000 rpm and re-suspended in stimulation buffer containing TBMX (PerkinElmer Kit) pre-warmed to room temperature to a concentration of 1.6×106 to 2.8×106 cells/mL. About 40,000 to 80,000 cells per well were used in this assay. Test compounds (10 mM in DMSO) were diluted into PBS containing 0.1% BSA in Beckman Biomek-2000 and tested at 11 different concentrations ranging from 100 μM to 1 pM. Reactions were incubated for 10 min at 37° C. and stopped by adding 100 μL of cold detection buffer containing [125I]-cAMP (NEN SMP004, PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, Mass.). The amount of cAMP produced (pmol/well) was calculated based on the counts observed for the samples and cAMP standards as described in the manufacturer's user manual. Data were analyzed by nonlinear regression analysis with the GraphPad Prism Software package (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, Calif.) with the sigmoidal equation. The Cheng-Prusoff equation (Cheng Y, and Prusoff W H., Biochemical Pharmacology, 1973, 22, 23, 3099-108) was used to calculate the EC50 values. In this assay, a lower EC50 value means the test compound has a higher functional activity at the receptor tested. hβ2 efficacy (EC50) data for compounds of this invention are shown in Table III. Example E Einthoven Assay This assay measures the ability of a test compound to provide bronchoprotection against methacholine (MCh)-induced bronchoconstriction in a rat. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (Harlan, Indianapolis, Ind.), weighing between 200 g and 350 g, were used for all studies. Test compound or vehicle (sterile deionized water) were dosed by inhalation (IH) over a 10 min period in a pie shaped inhalation chamber (R+S Molds, San Carlos, Calif.) using 5 mL of dosing solution. Rats were exposed to an aerosol, which was generated from an LC Star Nebulizer Set Model 22F51 (PART Respiratory Equipment, Inc. Midlothian, Va.) driven by Bioblend (5% CO2/95% atmospheric air) at a pressure of 22 psi. Rats were dosed with 100 μg of test compound unless otherwise indicated. At predetermined time points, rats were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal (IP) injection of 120 mg/kg inactin (thiobutabarbital). A supplemental dose (40 mg/kg, IP) was administered if the animal responded to physical stimuli (e.g. toe pinch). The surgical site was shaved and a 1-2 cm midline incision of the ventral aspect of the neck was made. The jugular vein was isolated and cannulated with a saline-filled polyethylene catheter (PE-50) to allow IV infusion of MCh. Trachea was dissected free and cannulated with a 14G needle (#NE-014, Small Parts, Miami Lakes, Fla.). After placement of the tracheal cannula, each rat was ventilated using a respirator (Model 683, Harvard Apparatus, Inc., MA) set at a stroke volume of 1 mL/100 g body weight (but not exceeding 2.5 mL volume) and a rate of 90 strokes per minute. A T-connector was placed along the respirator expiratory tubing to allow for measurement of changes in ventilation pressure (VP) using a Biopac transducer that was connected to a Biopac (TSD 137C) pre-amplifier. Body temperature was maintained at 37° C. using a heating pad. Changes in VP were recorded using the Acknowledge Data Collection Software (Santa Barbara, Calif.). Baseline values were collected for at least 2.5 min. Rats were then challenged with non-cumulative intravenous (IV) infusions of 40 and 80 μg/kg MCh. MCh was infused intravenously for 2.5 minutes from a syringe pump (sp210iw, World Precision Instruments, Inc., Sarasota, Fla.) at a rate of 2 mL/kg/min, with a 2 minute interval between the two doses of MCh. Changes in ventilation pressure (cm H2O) in treated animals are expressed as % inhibition of MCh response relative to control animals. Other bronchoconstrictors, such as histamine and acetylcholine, can be used in place of MCh in this assay. Additionally, guinea pigs can be used instead of rats. In this assay, a higher % inhibition of the MCh response indicates that the test compound provided a greater bronchoprotective effect. Inhibition greater than or equal to 30 percent at 24 h is indicative of a long duration of action. Bronchoprotection data for compounds of this invention are shown in Table III.
