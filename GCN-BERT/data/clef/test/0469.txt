SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR ESTIMATING THE SOLID FEED CONSUMPTION BY ANIMALS ON A FARM ON AN ANIMAL INDIVIDUAL LEVEL, SYSTEM FOR MANAGING ANIMALS, AND METHODS FOR MANAGING ANIMALS, PREPARING SOLID FEED, AND FEEDING ANIMALS TECHNICAL FIELD The technical field relates generally to systems and methods for estimating the solid feed consumption by animals on a farm on an animal individual level, to systems for managing animals, and to methods for managing animals, preparing solid feed, and feeding animals on the farm. RELATED ART The by far highest single cost on a dairy farm is the feed cost. Feed efficiency measured as kg of milk per kilogram of feed varies immensely between herds. Studies of herds with basically the same feed composition show a range between l.i to 1.8 with an average of 1.4 on herd level. Further, feed efficiency is closely associated with the environmental load per kilogram of milk from the dairy production. It is therefore extremely important to keep track of feeding efficiency on both individual and group level. Globally, most of the ingested feed in dairy production is emanating from a TMR (total mixed ration) on the feeding table and thus not possible to trace down to an individual animal, which would not only be important in terms of feeding efficiency, but also, it would be an extremely powerful instrument to identify animals at risk of having disturbances, to estimate the severity of a disease and also to follow animals on the recovery from diseases. Today, only research herds possess facilities where feed consumption can be accurately measured. To overcome this gap, tools to estimate feeding time as a proxy to feed consumption have been developed. However, as the feeding speed varies considerably between individual animals, the evaluation of feed consumption is very inaccurate. SUMMARY It is an aim of this document to reveal novel systems and methods for estimating the solid feed consumption by animals on a farm on an animal individual level, which are accurate, precise, and easy to implement on full size commercial farms. A first aspect refers to a system for estimating the solid feed consumption or dry matter intake by animals, such as e.g. cows, on a farm on an animal individual level, wherein the solid feed comprises sodium and/ or potassium and the animals are allowed to drink water only at one or more water supply positions. At each of the water supply positions and each time an animal is present at the water supply position, an animal identifying device is configured to identify the animal present at the water supply position and a water amount measuring device is configured to measure the amount of water the animal present at the water supply position drinks. At each water supply position, the water may be supplied via a water bowl or trough, to which only one animal at a time has access. Each of the animal identifying devices maybe any known animal identification used for automatically identifying animals such as cows on a farm arranged to identify any animal that gets access to the respective water bowl or trough. Each of the water amount measuring devices may be any kind of level sensor or flow sensor arranged to measure the consumption of water by each identified animal at a respective one of the water bowls or troughs. A processing device is operatively connected to the animal identifying devices and the water amount measuring devices to obtain, for each of the identifications, the identity of the animal and the measured amount of water drunk by the animal, wherein the processing device is configured to receive a value of the content of sodium and/or potassium in the solid feed and, for each of the animals, to estimate the solid feed consumption of the animal based on the measured amounts of water drunk by the animal together with the received value of the content of sodium and/or potassium in the solid feed. The processing device may be configured to estimate the absolute solid feed consumption of the animal, e.g. in kilogram solid feed, based on the measured amounts of water drunk by the animal. For estimation of the solid feed consumption on an absolute level, accuracy is greatly improved if a calibration is made wherein for each of the animals, measured amounts of water drunk by the animal are correlated with known amounts of consumed solid feed, e.g. as measured manually by means of weighing the solid feed given to the animal, wherein preferably the solid feed contains amounts of sodium and/or potassium which are known. Measured amounts of water drunk by the animal may alternatively be correlated with known amounts of consumed sodium and/or potassium, e.g. through manual determinations or rationing. By the above system, an accurate and precise approach is obtained for estimating dry matter intake on an animal individual level, which is also suitable to be implemented on full size commercial farms. It has been discovered that the amount of urine produced by an animal correlates well with the mineral intake of the animal. Since the amount of urine produced correlates strongly with the water intake, the dry matter intake can be estimated from the water intake on an animal individual level, if the mineral content (sodium and/or potassium) of the feed is known. That is, if the content of sodium and/or potassium in the solid feed is varying over time, but the content is known, the variations can be compensated for in the estimation of the solid feed consumption. In countries such as Sweden, the potassium content in dry matter may vary heavily while the sodium content is normally low, and if such feed is used, the potassium content has to be tracked and correlated for, or potassium has to be added such that a constant level of potassium in the dry matter is maintained over time. The value of the content of sodium and/or potassium in the solid feed can be entered manually into the system or measured automatically. The value does not have to be exact - it can be a simple estimation based on previous experience with a particular type of feed. The content of sodium and/ or potassium in the solid feed may e.g. be between about o.i and 5 % by weight, preferably between about 0.5 and 5 % by weight, and most preferably between about 1 and 3 % by weight. Devices for automatically measuring the content of sodium and/or potassium in the solid feed may comprise NIR (near infrared spectroscopy) apparatuses or other kind of measuring apparatuses arranged at a system for preparing solid feed or at a system for feeding each animal with solid feed, such as e.g. at a feeding wagon. In one embodiment, the animals are dairy animals and the processing device is configured, for each of the animals, to receive a value of the amount and/or fat content of milk drawn from the animal and to estimate the solid feed consumption also based on the received value of the amount and/or fat content of milk drawn from the animal. In particular, the water content of the milk produced by each animal may be measured and subtracted from the water intake of the animal. The water intake from which the water in the milk produced is subtracted correlates more strongly to the amount of urine produced by the animal, and is thus better correlated to the dry matter intake. In another embodiment, the processing device is configured to receive a value of the ambient temperature and/or humidity and, for each of the animals, to estimate the solid feed consumption also based on the received value of the ambient temperature and/or humidity. Typically, the temperature and/or humidity in normal ranges will only affect the water intake to a lesser degree. However, if the temperatures are very high and/or the humidity is very high, the water intake may increase for a given dry matter intake. Compensations in the estimation of the dry matter intake may be made if high temperatures and/or humidity are prevailing. In yet another embodiment, the processing device is configured, for each of the animals, to receive a value of a parameter of the urine produced by the animal and to estimate the solid feed consumption also based on the received value of the parameter of the urine produced by the animal. As explained above, the urine produced by the animal is strongly correlated to the dry matter intake, and thus, a measure of a parameter of the urine produced by the animal can be used to make the estimation of the dry matter intake more accurate and precise. The parameter may be the content of creatinine in the urine produced by the animal. In still another embodiment, the processing device is configured, for each of the animals, to receive a value of a parameter indicative of a weight, size or shape of the animal and to estimate the solid feed consumption also based on the received value of the parameter indicative of the weight, size or shape of the animal. In particular, the weight of the animal may be used to normalize the content of creatinine in the urine produced by the animal, which is then used as a measure of the amount of produced urine. As explained above, it is believed that it is the amount of urine produced by of an animal which is directly related to the mineral intake, and a measure of the amount of urine produced by of the animal would thus be the best parameter for estimating dry matter intake. However, the water intake of the animal, or the water intake from which the water in the milk produced by the animal is subtracted, is typically easier to measure, and it can be seen as a measure of the urine produced by the animal, which in turn is a measure of, or at least correlated with, the dry matter intake (or the sodium and/or potassium intake). A second aspect refers to an arrangement for managing animals on a farm comprising the system for estimating the solid feed consumption of the first aspect and a system configured to perform an operation with respect to each of one or more of the animals based on the estimated solid feed consumption by that animal. The arrangement may be a free stall or loose housing arrangement, in which animals can move. The system configured to perform operation with respect to an animal may be an alarm system configured to alert a farmer based on the estimated solid feed consumption of the animal, e.g. if the estimated solid feed consumption meets a feed consumption condition. Alternatively, the system configured to perform operation with respect to an animal may be a gate system guiding the animal to an area such as an evaluation or treatment area based on the estimated solid feed consumption of the animal. Yet alternatively, the system configured to perform operation with respect to an animal may be a control system controlling the milking of the animal based on the estimated solid feed consumption of the animal. In one embodiment, a system is configured to prepare solid feed for each of one or more of the animals based on the estimated solid feed consumption by that animal or those animals. The solid feed may be TMR (total mixed ration) or PMR (partly mixed ration) feed, forage such as silage or haylage, or concentrate. The composition, amount, and/or energy density of the solid feed may be controlled and/or adjusted based on the estimated solid feed consumption by one or more identified animals. Typically TMR and PMR feed rations are given to a group of animals, whereas the concentrate is given on an animal individual basis in fodder stations, in which the animals are identified. The composition, amount, and/or energy density of the concentrate can thus be controlled and/or adjusted for each animal individually based on the estimated solid feed consumption by that animal. Further, a feeding system may be configured to feed each of one or more of the animals with the solid feed prepared for that animal. Hereby, feed efficiency can be improved dynamically and continuously. A third aspect refers to a method for estimating the solid feed consumption by animals on a farm on an animal individual level, wherein the animals are allowed to drink water only at one or more water supply positions. According to the method, solid feed containing a known content of sodium and/or potassium is provided, each animal is automatically identified each time the animal is present at a water supply position, for each of the animals, the amounts of water the animal drinks at the water supply positions are automatically measured, and, for each of the animals, the solid feed consumption of that animal is estimated based on the measured amounts of water drunk by the animal together with the content of sodium and/or potassium in the solid feed. The content of sodium and/or potassium may be manually entered by the user of automatically measured by the system. The value does not have to be exact - it can be a simple estimation based on previous experience with a particular type of feed. The solid feed may be provided with a content of sodium and/or potassium which is constant over time. Sodium and/or potassium may thus be added to the solid feed to provide a content of sodium and/or potassium which is constant over time. A fourth aspect refers to a method for managing animals on a farm comprising the method of the third aspect, wherein an operation is performed with respect to each of one or more of the animals based on the estimated solid feed consumption by that animal. One example of an operation is performed with respect to each of one or more of the animals based on the estimated solid feed consumption by that animal is preparing solid feed based on the estimated solid feed consumption by that animal. The solid feed may be TMR or PMR feed or concentrate. Further, each of one or more of the animals may be fed with the solid feed prepared for that animal. Other examples are given above with respect to the second aspect. A fifth aspect refers to a system for estimating the solid feed consumption by animals on a farm on an animal individual level, wherein the solid feed comprises a known content of sodium and/or potassium. The system comprises, for each of the animals, a system configured to measure a parameter indicative of the amount of urine produced by the animal, and, for each of the animals, a processing device configured to estimate the solid feed consumption of the animal based on the measured parameter indicative of the amount of urine produced by the animal together with the content of sodium and/or potassium in the solid feed. Further, a system may be configured, for each of the animals, to measure a parameter indicative of a weight, size or shape of the animal, wherein the processing device is configured, for each of the animals, to estimate the solid feed consumption also based on the measured parameter indicative of the weight, size or shape of the animal. The parameter indicative of the amount of urine produced by an animal may be the content of creatinine in the urine produced by the animal, optionally normalized to the weight of the animal. By the above system, an accurate and precise approach is obtained for estimating dry matter intake on an animal individual level, and which is also suitable to be implemented on full size commercial farms. The amount of urine produced by an animal (as measured as the creatinine content of the urine) correlates well with the mineral intake of the animal. The dry matter intake can thus be estimated from the water intake on an animal individual level, if the mineral content (sodium and/or potassium) of the feed is known. A sixth aspect refers to a method for estimating the solid feed consumption by animals on a farm on an animal individual level, wherein the solid feed comprises a known content of sodium and/or potassium. According to the method, for each of the animals, a parameter indicative of the amount of urine produced by the animal is measured, and, for each of the animals, the solid feed consumption of the animal is estimated based on the measured parameter indicative of the amount of urine produced by the animal together with the content of sodium and/or potassium in the solid feed. Advantages of the approaches disclosed above include the following: Accurate and precise estimation of dry matter intake on an animal individual level is enabled. Feed efficiency can be improved on an animal individual level and on a group level. Detection of deviations and follow ups can be performed on an animal individual level. Also the severity of a disease can be assessed from the estimation of dry matter intake. The approach can be used for genetic improvement. The dry matter intake of all animals including dry and young animals can be estimated. Groups of animals within a pen, such as e.g. first calvers, animals of same age, animals of same breed, etc., can be evaluated by the use of the approach. The system is based on an assembly of existing devices. No weighing of feed delivery and input of data of feed on a daily basis are required. Further characteristics and advantages will be evident from the detailed description of embodiments given hereinafter, and the accompanying Figs. 1-6, which are given by way of illustration only.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS Fig. l illustrates, schematically, in a block diagram an embodiment of an arrangement 10 for managing animals on a farm, wherein the animals are allowed to drink water only at one or more water supply positions 12, 13, 14. The arrangementio comprises a system 11 for estimating the solid feed consumption by animals on an animal individual level, a milking system 16 for milking the animals, a system 17 for measuring ambient temperature and/or humidity, a system 18 for measuring a parameter indicative of the amount of urine produced by each animal, a system 19 for measuring a parameter indicative of a weight, size or shape of the animal, a system 20 for preparing solid feed containing sodium and/or potassium for each animal, and a feeding system 21 for feeding each animal with solid feed. Here, it is assumed that the animals are dairy animals, but most of the approaches disclosed in this document are equally applicable to other kind of animals. The arrangement 10 may be a free stall or loose housing arrangement, in which animals can move, and the milking system 16 may be an automatic milking system provided with equipment for automatically measuring milk quantity and milk quality parameters. The system 17 for measuring ambient temperature and/or humidity may be based on any kind of known sensors, the system 18 for measuring a parameter indicative of the amount of urine produced by each animal may be a system for measuring the content of creatinine in the urine of the animals, the system 19 for measuring a parameter indicative of a weight, size or shape of the animal may comprise a weighing apparatus and/or an image based system for determining size and shape, such as a system for determining the BCS [body condition score) of the animals. The system 11 for estimating the solid feed consumption by animals on an animal individual level comprises, at each of the water supply positions 12, 13, 14, an animal identifying device 12a, 13a, 14a configured, each time an animal is present at the water supply position 12, 13, 14, to identify the animal present at the water supply position 12, 13, 14. The system 11 further comprises, at each of the water supply positions 12, 13, 14, a water amount measuring device 12b, 13b, 14b configured to measure the amount of water the animal present at the water supply position 12, 13, 14 drinks. Hereby, the water intake of each animal is monitored thoroughly. At each water supply position 12, 13, 14, the water may be supplied via a water bowl or trough (not illustrated), to which only one animal at a time has access. Each of the animal identifying devices 12a, 13a, 14a may be any known animal identification device used for automatically identifying animals such as cows on a farm, arranged to identify any animal that gets access to the respective water bowl or trough. Each of the water amount measuring devices 12b, 13b, 14b maybe any kind of level sensor or flow sensor arranged to measure the consumption of water by each identified animal at a respective one of the water bowls or troughs. A processing device 15 is operatively connected to the animal identifying devices 12a, 13a, 14a and the water amount measuring devices 12b, 13b, 14b to obtain, for each of the identifications, the identity of the animal and the measured amount of water drunk by the animal. The processing device 15 is further configured to receive a value of the content of sodium and/or potassium in the solid feed and, for each of the animals, configured to estimate the solid feed consumption of that animal based on the measured amounts of water drunk that the animal together with the received value of the content of sodium and/or potassium in the solid feed. The processing device 15 may be a computer provided with suitable software. The value of the content of sodium and/or potassium in the solid feed can be entered manually into the system or measured automatically. The value does not have to be exact - it can be a simple estimation based on previous experience with a particular type of feed. Devices for automatically measuring the content of sodium and/or potassium in the solid feed may comprise NIR (near infrared spectroscopy) apparatuses or other kind of measuring apparatuses (not illustrated) arranged at the system 20 for preparing solid feed or at the system 21 for feeding each animal with solid feed. The content of sodium and/or potassium in the solid feed may e.g. be between about 0.1 and 5 % by weight, preferably between about 0.5 and 5 % by weight, and most preferably between about 1 and 3 % by weight. In one embodiment, the system 20 may be configured to prepare solid feed for an animal or a group of animals based on the estimated solid feed consumption by that animal or that group of animals. The solid feed may be TMR (total mixed ration) or PMR (partly mixed ration) feed, forage such as silage or haylage, or concentrate. The composition, amount, and/or energy density of the solid feed may be controlled and/or adjusted based on the estimated solid feed consumption by the animal or the group of animals. Typically TMR and PMR feed rations are given to a group of animals, whereas concentrate is given on an animal individual basis in fodder stations, in which the animals are identified. The composition, amount, and/or energy density of the concentrate can thus be controlled and/or adjusted for each animal individually based on the estimated solid feed consumption by that animal. The system 21 is configured to feed the animal or the group of animals with the prepared solid feed. Fig. 2 illustrates, schematically, in a diagram water intake in liters per day versus potassium intake in grams per day for a plurality of animals. It can be seen that the water intake is essentially proportional to the potassium intake via the feed. The slope and the offset at the y axis may be different for different animals, but the essentially linear relationship between water intake and potassium intake can be noted for each of the animals. By correlating measured amounts of water drunk by each animal with known amounts of consumed solid feed or known amounts of consumed sodium and/or potassium (e.g. as rations given by a farmer), e.g. at start up, the system can be calibrated and be configured to reliably estimate the solid feed consumption by each animal on an absolute level. Alternatively, or additionally, the processing device 15 may be configured, for each of the animals, to receive a value of the amount and/or fat content of milk drawn from the animal and to estimate the solid feed consumption also based on the received value of the amount and/or fat content of milk drawn from the animal. Such values may be received from the milking system 16. Yet alternatively, or additionally, the processing device 15 may be configured to receive a value of the ambient temperature and/or humidity and, for each of the animals, to estimate the solid feed consumption also based on the received value of the ambient temperature and/or humidity. Such value can be received from the system 17 for measuring ambient temperature and/ or humidity. Yet alternatively, or additionally, the processing device 15 may be configured, for each of the animals, to receive a value of a parameter of the urine produced by the animal, such as the content of creatinine in the urine, and to estimate the solid feed consumption also based on the received value of the parameter of the urine produced by the animal. It has been noted that this parameter can be used in fine tuning the estimation of the feed intake. This value may be received from the 18 for measuring a parameter indicative of the amount of urine produced by each animal. Yet alternatively, or additionally, the processing device 15 may be configured, for each of the animals, to receive a value of a parameter indicative of a weight, size or shape of the animal and to estimate the solid feed consumption also based on the received value of the parameter indicative of the weight, size or shape of the animal. This value may be received from the system 19 for measuring a parameter indicative of a weight, size or shape of the animal. Fig. 3 illustrates, schematically, in a diagram, produced urine in kilograms per day versus potassium intake in grams per day for an animal. It can be seen that the produced urine is essentially proportional to the potassium intake via the feed. In one embodiment, the system for estimating the solid feed consumption by animals on a farm on an animal individual level comprises, for each of the animals, a system configured to measure a parameter indicative of the amount of urine produced by the animal, such as e.g. content of creatinine in the urine, and a processing device configured to receive a value of the content of sodium and/or potassium in the solid feed and, for each of the animals, estimate the solid feed consumption of the animal based on the measured parameter indicative of the amount of urine produced by the animal together with the received value of the content of sodium and/or potassium in the solid feed. The content of creatinine in the urine can be measured by a suitable sensor. This system maybe configured, for each of the animals, to measure a parameter indicative of a weight, size or shape of the animal, wherein the processing device is configured, for each of the animals, to estimate the solid feed consumption also based on the measured parameter indicative of the weight, size or shape of the animal. In one embodiment, the content of creatinine in the urine is normalized with respect to the weight of the animal, and the normalized content of creatinine in the urine is used as a measure of the urine produced by the animal, wherein the feed intake is estimated based on the normalized content of creatinine in the urine. By correlating measured contents of creatinine or normalized creatinine in the urine produced by each animal with known amounts of consumed solid feed or known amounts of consumed sodium and/or potassium (e.g. as rations given by a farmer), e.g. at startup, the system can be calibrated and be configured to estimate the solid feed consumption by each animal on an absolute level. Fig. 4 illustrates, schematically, in a diagram water intake and produced urine in kilograms per day versus potassium intake in grams per day for an animal. It can be seen that the slope is similar, meaning that the sensitivities for the two parameters water intake and produced urine as measures of feed intake are similar. Figs. 5 illustrates, schematically, in a flow scheme an embodiment of a method for estimating the solid feed consumption by animals on a farm on an animal individual level, wherein the animals are allowed to drink water only at one or more water supply positions. According to the embodiment, solid feed containing a known content of sodium and/or potassium is, in a step 51, provided. Each animal, each time the animal is present at a water supply position, is, in a step 52, automatically identified. The amount of water each animal drinks at the water supply positions is, in a step 53, measured. Finally, the solid feed consumption by each animal is, in a step 54, estimated based on the measured amounts of water drunk by the animal together with the content of sodium and/or potassium in the solid feed. Figs. 6 illustrates, schematically, in a flow scheme an embodiment of a method for estimating the solid feed consumption by animals on a farm on an animal individual level, wherein the animals are allowed to drink water only at one or more water supply positions. According to the embodiment, a parameter indicative of the amount of urine produced by each animal is, in a step 61, measured, and the solid feed consumption of each animal is, in a step 62, estimated based on the measured parameter indicative of the amount of urine produced by the animal together with the content of sodium and/or potassium in the solid feed. The parameter indicative of the amount of urine produced by the animal is advantageously the content of creatinine in the urine produced by the animal. For each of the animals, a parameter indicative of a weight, size or shape of the animal may be measured and the solid feed consumption may be estimated also based on the measured parameter indicative of the weight, size or shape of the animal.
