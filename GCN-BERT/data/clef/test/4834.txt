Background This invention generally relates to a method for preparing hydrophobically modified acrylic rheology modifiers. Aqueous formulations typically use thickeners to obtain a desired rheology profile. For example, an aqueous paper coating composition requires rheology modifiers to provide sufficient low shear viscosity to allow pickup and application of the coating composition onto a paper substrate as well as the appropriate high shear viscosity to allow metering of the excess applied coating composition to obtained a desired coating weight. One class of thickeners suitable for thickening aqueous formulations are alkali-soluble thickeners. These thickeners, also referred to as alkali-swellable thickeners, are copolymers formed by the polymerization of ethylenically unsaturated monomers and contain acid groups pendant to backbone of the copolymer. Alkali-soluble thickeners have also been prepared containing pendant nonionic surfactant groups or hydrophobes. These thickeners, known in the art as hydrophobically-modified alkali-soluble (swellable) thickeners, are characterized by increased thickening efficiency compared to alkali-soluble thickeners of similar composition and molecular weight. U.S. Patent 4,384,096 discloses a method for preparing rheology modifiers containing hydrophobes. However, the disclosed process is a thermally initiated polymerization. The issue addressed by the present invention is to improve the method for preparing hydrophobically modified (meth) acrylate rheology modifiers to obtain rheology modifiers with an improved viscosity profile. The discussion of documents, acts, materials, devices, articles and the like is included in this specification solely for the purpose of providing a context for the present invention. It is not suggested or represented that any or all of these matters formed part of the prior art base or were common general knowledge in the field relevant to the present invention as it existed before the priority date of each claim of this application. Where the terms "comprise", "comprises", "comprised" or "comprising" are used in this specification (including the claims) they are to be interpreted as specifying the presence of the stated features, integers, steps or components, but not precluding the presence of one or more other features, integers, steps or components, or group thereof.

Detailed Description of the Invention All percentages are weight percentages (wt%), unless otherwise indicated and all temperatures are in °C, unless otherwise indicated. Weight average molecular weights, Mw, are measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) using polyacrylic acid standards, as is known in the art. The techniques of GPC are discussed in detail in Modern Size Exclusion Chromatography, W. W. Yau, J. J. Kirkland, D. D. Bly; Wiley-Interscience, 1979, and in A Guide to Materials Characterization and Chemical Analysis, J. Ρ. Sibilia; VCH, 1988, ρ. 81-84. The molecular weights reported herein are in units of daltons. As used herein the term “(meth)acrylic” refers to acrylic or methacrylic. A “C3-C6 carboxylic acid monomer” is a mono-ethylenically unsaturated compound having one or two carboxylic acid groups, e.g., (meth)acrylic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, itaconic acid, maleic anhydride, crotonic acid, etc. Alkyl groups are saturated hydrocarbyl groups which may be straight or branched. Aralkyl groups are alkyl groups substituted by aryl groups. Examples of aralkyl groups include, e.g., benzyl, 2-phenylethyl and 1-phenylethyl. Aralkylphenyl groups are phenyl groups having one or more aralkyl substituents, e.g... 2,4,6-tris(l-phenylethyl)phenyl. The redox systems used in the method of this invention use one or more oxidants in combination with a suitable reductant and a metal catalyst. Preferably, at least 40 wt% of total monomer is polymerized in the presence of the redox system, preferably at least 50 wt%, preferably at least 60 wt%, preferably at least 70 wt%, preferably at least 80 wt%. The total weight of monomers includes any monomer which already has been polymerized at the time the redox system is added. Suitable oxidants include, e.g., t-alkyl hydroperoxides, t-alkyl peroxides, and t-alkyl peresters, wherein in each case the t-alkyl group has fewer than 5 carbon atoms; hydrogen peroxide, sodium peroxide, potassium peroxide, persulfate, percarbonate, perborate, perphosphoric acid and salts thereof, potassium permanganate, and ammonium or alkali metal salts of peroxydisulfuric. acid. Preferred oxidants include persulfate, percarbonate and perborate; preferably persulfate. In the method of this invention, polymerization occurs substantially in the absence of a peroxide, hydroperoxide or perester containing an alkyl group having at least five carbon atoms. Herein, the phrase “substantially in the absence” means that the oxidant contains less than 5 wt% of peroxides, hydroperoxides or peresters having C5 or larger alkyl groups, preferably less than 2 wt%, preferably less than 1 wt %, preferably less than 0.5 wt%, preferably less than 0.1 wt%, preferably 0 wt%. In some preferred embodiments, polymerization is conducted substantially in the absence of any peroxides, hydroperoxides or peresters.

The redox portion of the process can be a gradual feed, a shot, a feed followed by a shot, or a shot followed by a feed, or other possible combinations. A shot addition is one in which monomer is added over a relatively short time, e.g., less than 20 minutes, preferably less than 15 minutes, preferably less than 10 minutes, so that the reaction mixture will contain substantial unreacted monomer after the addition.

Preferably, the rheology modifier is provided as an aqueous composition containing the polymer as discrete particles dispersed in an aqueous medium. In this aqueous dispersion, the average particle diameter of the polymer particles is typically in the range of from 20 to 1,000 nm, preferably in the range of from 50 to 500 nm, and more preferably, in the range of from 75 to 350 nm. Particle sizes herein are those determined using a Brookhaven Model Bl-90 particle sizer manufactured bv Brookhaven Instruments Corporation, Holtsville, NY, reported as “effective diameter”. The level of polymer particles in the aqueous dispersion is typically in the range of from 15 to 60 weight %, based on the weight of the aqueous dispersion. Preferably, the rheology modifier is provided as an aqueous composition containing the polymerized monomers as a partly or fully solubilized polymer in an aqueous medium. Partly soluble polymer refers to a polymer that is not fully soluble in the aqueous medium, such as a swellable polymer particle that is enlarged by imbibing the aqueous medium but still retains some aspect of the particle shape. The solution containing the partly or completely solubilized polymer is characterized as having a translucent, semi-transparent, or transparent appearance. Suitable pH ranges for the aqueous solution of this embodiment are related to the level of pendant ionic groups attached to the polymer. A polymer containing less than 70 weight % acid monomer as polymerized units, based on the total weight of the polymer, is typically partly or completely soluble in an aqueous medium having a pH that is at or above the pKa of the pendant acid groups. For example, a polymer containing from 25 to 65 weight % polymerized acid monomer, based on the total weight of the polymer, is typically partly or completely soluble at a pH in the range of 5 to 14. Suitable bases to adjust the pH of the polymer dispersion include mineral bases such as sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide; ammonium hydroxide; and organic bases such as triethylamine. Mixtures of bases may be used. Suitable acids to adjust the pH of the aqueous medium include mineral acid such as hydrochloric acid, phosphorus acid, and sulfuric acid; and organic acids such as acetic acid. Mixtures of acids may be used. Suitable polymerization techniques for use in the method of this invention include emulsion polymerization and solution polymerization. Aqueous emulsion polymerization processes typically are conducted in an aqueous reaction mixture, which contains at least one monomer and various synthesis adjuvants such as the free radical sources, buffers, and reductants in an aqueous reaction medium. The aqueous reaction medium is the continuous fluid phase of the aqueous reaction mixture and contains greater than 50 weight % water and optionally one or more water miscible solvents, based on the weight of the aqueous reaction medium. Suitable water miscible solvents include methanol, ethanol, propanol, acetone, ethylene glycol ethyl ethers, propylene glycol propyl ethers, and diacetone alcohol. Preferably, the aqueous reaction medium contains greater than 90 weight % water, and more preferably, greater than 95 weight % water, based on the weight of the aqueous reaction medium. Most preferred is an aqueous reaction medium containing from 98 to 100 weight % water, based on the weight of the aqueous reaction medium. The hydrophobically modified rheology modifier is useful as a thickener for paints and other coating compositions, additive for cement products, paper coating thickener, rheology modifier for personal care products (e.g., shampoo, body wash), thickener for laundry detergent formulations, deicing fluids and adhesives, and as an additive for oilfield applications, e.g., oil-water clarification and water-in-oil separation. The rheology modifier may be used in a “back-acid” formulation wherein the formulated polymer is partially neutralized at high pH, then re-acidified to lower the pH, as described in ΕΡ 1,272,159. The rheology modifier also may be used in formulations containing synthetic clays as co-thickeners, e.g., Laponite clays.

A latex unthickened paint composition, Pre-paint #1, was prepared by combining: KRONOS 4311 titanium dioxide slurry 263.4 g Water 150.4 g Ethylene glycol 24.3 g ROPAQUE Ultra 49.8 g RHOPLEX SG-30 binder 421.8 g TEXANOL 19.2 g TRITON X-405 2.5 g DREWPLUS L-475 4.1 £ Total 935.5 g KRONOS 4311 is a product of KRONOS Incorporated, Chelmsford, ΜΑ. TRITON Χ-405, ROPAQUE Ultra and RHOPLEX SG-30 are products of The Dow Chemical Company, Midland, MI. DREWPLUS L-475 is a product of Ashland Specialty Chemical Company, Dublin, OH. AMP-95 is a product of Angus Chemicals, Buffalo Grove, IL. The formulated paint was obtained by adding thickener and water to 935.5 g of Pre-paint # 1. To maintain constant solids of the fully formulated paint, the combined weight of added thickener, AMP-95 and water equals 79.9 g. The density of the fully formulated paint was 1015.4 pounds per 100 gallons (1.2 kg per liter). Thickeners were added as aqueous dispersions at 15% weight solids. Formulated paints were made by the following method. To 935.5 g Pre-paint #1, an amount of aqueous thickener dispersion and an amount of water and an amount of AMP-95 were slowly added and stirred on a lab mixer for ten minutes. The total combined amount of aqueous thickener dispersions, AMP-95 and water is 79.9 grams. Final paint pH is 8.9. Sufficient thickener was added to provide a paint with a initial Stormer viscosity of 103 KU. In the following data presentation, thickener concentrations in the thickened paint are described in terms of dry grams of thickener added. g thickener (dry) Stormer viscosity (KU) ICI viscosity (poise) Ex. 7 (comp.) 3.39 103 0.75 Ex. 5 2.65 103 0.75 “Stormer viscosity” is a measure of the mid-shear viscosity as measured by a Stormer viscometer. The Stormer viscometer is a rotating paddle viscometer that is compliant with ASTM-D562. Stormer viscosity was measured on a Brookfield Krebs Unit Viscometer KU-1 + available from Brookfield Engineering Labs, Middleboro, ΜΑ. “KU” indicates Krebs units. “1C1 viscosity” is the viscosity, expressed in units of poise, measured on a high shear rate, cone and plate viscometer known as an IC1 viscometer. An 1C1 viscometer is described in ASTM D4287. It measures the viscosity of a paint at approximately 10,000 sec'1. ICI viscosities of paints were measured on a viscometer manufactured by Research Equipment London, Ltd. An equivalent ICI viscometer is the ELCOMETER 2205 manufactured by ELCOMETER, Incorporated in Rochester Hills, Michigan. The ICI of a paint typically correlates with the amount of drag force experienced during brush application of the paint. Example 12 Paper Coatings Data Four identical paper coating master batches were made by blending on a benchtop mixer 172.5 g of OMYACARB H-90 calcium carbonate (76.09% solids slurry from Omya), 61.48 g of KAOGLOSS # 1 clay (71.16% solids slurry), 39.16 g of GENCRYL 9780 binder (49.15% solids from Rohmnova Solutions, Inc.). The coating thickened with 0.12% of Example 8 was produced by adding 1.17 g of Example 8, 15.13 g of water and 1.28 g of 15% by weight sodium hydroxide aqueous solution to one of the four master batches. The coating thickened with 0.12% of Example 6 was produced by adding 1.22 g of Example 6, 14.86 g of water and 1.58 g of 15% by weight sodium hydroxide aqueous solution. The coating thickened with 0.18% of Example 8 was produced by adding 1.76 g of Example 8, 14.44 g of water and 1.75 g of 15% by weight sodium hydroxide aqueous solution. The coating thickened with 0.18% of Example 6 was produced by adding 1.83 g of Example 6, 14.19 g of water and 1.98 g of 15% by weight sodium hydroxide aqueous solution. Final pH values of all paper coatings were 8.6 . The paper coatings were equilibrated for one hour in a 25°C constant temperature room before measurements were recorded. The rate of water loss from the coating was measured three times for each coating on a AA-GWR device. A lower rate of water loss indicates better water retention. Better water retention is a desirable property in a paper coating.
