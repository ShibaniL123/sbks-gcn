Technical Field of the Invention The present invention relates to the formulation of ivermectin into topical pharmaceutical compositions useful for the treatment of rosacea. This invention also relates to topical pharmaceutical compositions suited for administration to humans, comprising ivermectin. 2. Description of Background and/or Related and/or Prior Art Ivermectin is a mixture of two compounds belonging to the avermectin class, 5-O-demethyl-22,23-dihydroavermectin A1a and 5-O-demethyl-22,23-dihydroavermectin A1b. They are also known as 22,23-dihydroavermectin B1a and 22-23-dihydroavermectin B1b. Ivermectin contains at least 80% of 22,23-dihydroavermectin B1a and less than 20% of 22,23-dihydroavermectin B1b. This active agent is part of the avermectin class, a group of macrocyclic lactones produced by the bacterium Streptomyces avermitilis (Reynolds J E F (Ed) (1993) Martindale). The extra pharmacopoeia, 29th Edition, Pharmaceutical Press, London). In the middle of the 1980s, ivermectin was presented as a broad-spectrum anti-parasitic medicinal product for veterinary use (W. C. CAMPBELL, et al., (1983). Ivermectin: a potent new anti-parasitic agent, Science, 221, 823-828). It is effective against most common intestinal worms (except tapeworms), most acarids and some lice. It in particular exhibits considerable affinity for the glutamate-dependent chloride channels present in invertebrate nerve cells and muscle cells. Its binding to these channels promotes an increase in membrane permeability to chloride ions, resulting in hyperpolarization of the nerve or muscle cell. Neuromuscular paralysis which can lead to the death of certain parasites results therefrom. Ivermectin also interacts with other ligand-dependent chloride channels, such as those involving the neuromediator GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid). Ivermectin is more particularly an anthelmintic. It has already been described in humans in the treatment of river blindness caused by Onchocerca volvulus, of gastrointestinal strongyloidiasis (anguillulosis) (product Stromectol®), and of human scabies (Meinking T L et al., N. Engl. J. Med., 1995 Jul. 6; 333(1):26-30, “The treatment of scabies with ivermectin”) and also in the treatment of microfilaraemia diagnoses or suspected in individuals suffering from lymphatic filariasis due to Wuchereria bancrofti. U.S. Pat. No. 6,133,310 discloses the use of ivermectin topically in the form of a prototype of a lotion consisting of a mixture of ivermectin and water, and also mentions the possibility of a prototype of a cream consisting, for its part, of a mixture of ivermectin and an excipient such as propylene glycol or sodium lauryl sulfate, but describes no pharmaceutical composition as such. These mixtures are similar to experimental preparations used in the context of initial results of proof of concept. In fact, the elements disclosed in that patent provide no teaching to those skilled in the art regarding the feasibility of industrially acceptable pharmaceutical compositions containing ivermectin, in particular having good cosmetic properties and a shelf-life which is sufficiently long for an industrial pharmaceutical product (minimum of 2 years). SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Despite the fact that all these uses in humans are limited to oral administration or to the use of experimental preparations, topical pharmaceutical compositions have now been developed suited for the treatment of humans, containing ivermectin. In addition, it has now been found that the compositions according to the invention exhibit very good stability, in particular at different pHs, and good tolerance on the skin. In fact, it has now been found that same are particularly suitable for the treatment of dermatological conditions, and more particularly well suited for the treatment of rosacea. The present invention also features the formulation of ivermectin into topical pharmaceutical compositions useful for the treatment of rosacea, topical pharmaceutical compositions suited for human administration, comprising ivermectin, and the use of these topical pharmaceutical compositions for the treatment of rosacea (whether regime or regimen). DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF BEST MODE AND SPECIFIC/PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION The ivermectin according to the invention contains at least 80% of 22,23-dihydroavermectin B1a and less than 20% of 22,23-dihydroavermectin B1b. The pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention are suited for treating the skin and may be in liquid, pasty or solid form, and more particularly in the form of ointments, creams, milks, pomades, powders, impregnated pads, syndets, towelettes, solutions, gels, sprays, foams, suspensions, lotions, sticks, shampoos or washing bases. They may also be in the form of suspensions of microspheres or nanospheres or of lipid or polymeric vesicles or of polymeric patches and of hydrogels for controlled release. These compositions for topical application may be in anhydrous form, in aqueous form of in the form of an emulsion. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention are in the form of an emulsion of the cream or lotion type, of a gel, or of a solution. More preferably, the compositions according to the invention are in the form of an emulsion. Conventional emulsions as described in the prior art are unstable virtually homogeneous systems of two immiscible liquids, one of which is dispersed in the other in the form of fine droplets (micelles). This dispersion is stabilized by virtue of the action of surfactant-emulsifiers which modify the structure and the ratio of the forces at the interface, and therefore increase the stability of the dispersion by decreasing the interface tension energy. Surfactant-emulsifiers are amphiphilic compounds which possess a hydrophobic component having affinity for oil and a hydrophilic component having affinity for water, thus creating a link between the two phases. Ionic or nonionic emulsifiers therefore stabilize oil/water emulsions by adsorbing to the interface and forming lamellar layers of liquid crystals. The emulsifier power of nonionic surfactants is closely linked to the polarity of the molecule. This polarity is defined by the HLB (hydrophilic/lipophilic balance). Conventional emulsions are generally stabilized by a mixture of surfactants, the HLBs of which can be quite different but the proportion of which in the mixture corresponds to the required HLB of the fatty phase to be emulsified. The compositions according to the invention will contain this type of ingredient. The compositions according to the invention are described as stable emulsions in that they exhibit good physical and chemical stability over time, even at a temperature above ambient temperature (for example 45-55° C.), as shown in the examples described hereinafter. The ivermectin in the compositions according to the invention also, surprisingly, exhibits good chemical stability in the case of pH variation.

Example 9 Study of Tolerance and of Acceptability of the Composition of Example 5 A randomized single-blind intra-individual study was carried out on 15 individuals with skin tending to be affected by rosacea. The composition of Example 5 was tested in comparison with a gel and with an emulsion having compositions different from the compositions according to the invention. The individuals presented themselves three times in order to perform the various applications. In the course of each of the visits, 2 of the three products were applied so as to cover each half-face. Each product was tested twice during the study. After application and at each visit, the individuals filled in, for each product tested, a questionnaire for evaluating the clinical tolerance and the cosmetic acceptability. The following clinical tolerance parameters were evaluated: stinging sensation, burning, dry skin, tightness or itching. The following cosmetic acceptability parameters were evaluated: creaminess, texture, lack of a sensation of greasy and sticky skin, nourishing nature, feeling of comfort and of softness to the touch. For all the tolerance parameters, the composition according to the invention was judged to be well tolerated by the individuals, to the same extent as the two other compositions. In general, for all the acceptability parameters, the individuals gave their approval (good or excellent), with respect to the parameters, regarding the composition of the Example 5 in 76.66% of the cases where it was tested. This formulation therefore tends to distinguish itself from the gel-cream composition, having a 66.66% approval, and from the other emulsion, having a 63.32% approval. Example 10 Study of Irritation Over 21 Days A study of irritation over 21 days was carried out in order to test the irritation induced by the three compositions tested in the preceding example. No product was considered to be irritant under the conditions tested.
