The invention relates to therapies by injection of insulin(s) for treating diabetes. Insulin therapy, or therapy for diabetes by injection of insulin, has experienced remarkable progress over the past few years by virtue in particular of the development of new insulins which offer better correction of blood glucose level in patients in comparison with human insulin and which make it possible to simulate more closely the physiological activity of the pancreas. When type II diabetes is diagnosed in a patient, a gradual treatment is put in place. The patient firstly takes oral antidiabetics (OADs) such as Metformin. When OADs alone are no longer sufficient to regulate the glucose level in the blood, a change in the treatment must be made and, depending on the patients' specificities, various treatment combinations can be put in place. The patient can, for example, have a treatment based on a basal insulin of glargine or detemir type as a supplement to the OADs, then subsequently, depending on the progression of the disease, a treatment based on basal insulin and prandial insulin. Moreover, today, in order to ensure the transition from treatments with OADs, when the latter are no longer able to control the glucose level in the blood, to a basal insulin/prandial insulin treatment, the injection of GLP-1 analogs is recommended. GLPs-1, for Glucagon-Like Peptides-1, are insulinotropic peptides or incretins, and belong to the family of gut hormones which stimulate insulin secretion when the blood glucose level is too high, for example after a meal. Gut hormones are also called satiety hormones. They comprise in particular GLP-1 (Glucagon-like peptide-1) and GIP (Glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide), oxyntomodulin (a proglucagon derivative), peptide YY, amylin, cholecystokinin, pancreatic polypeptide (PP), ghrelin and enterostatin which have peptide or protein structures. They also stimulate insulin secretion, in response to glucose and to fatty acids, and are therefore in this respect potential candidates for the treatment of diabetes. Among these gut hormones, GLPs-1 are those which have to date provided the best results in the development of medicaments. They have enabled patients suffering from type II diabetes to lose weight while at the same time having a better control of their blood glucose level. GLP-1 analogs or derivatives have thus been developed, in particular to improve their stability. Furthermore, to cover his daily insulin needs, a diabetic patient currently has, schematically, two types of insulins that have complementary actions: prandial insulins (or “fast-acting” insulins) and basal insulins (or “slow-acting” insulins). The prandial insulins allow a rapid management (metabolization and/or storage) of the glucose taken in during meals and snacks. The patient must inject himself with a prandial insulin before each food intake, i.e. approximately 2 to 3 injections per day. The prandial insulins most widely used are: recombinant human insulin, NovoLog® (insulin aspart from NOVO NORDISK), Humalog® (Insulin lispro from ELI LILLY) and Apidra® (insulin glulisine from SANOFI-AVENTIS). The basal insulins maintain the glycemic homeostasis of the patient, outside periods of food intake. They act essentially to block the endogenous production of glucose (hepatic glucose). The daily dose of basal insulin generally corresponds to 40-50% of the total daily insulin needs. Depending on the basal insulin used, this dose is dispensed in 1 or 2 injections, spread out regularly over the course of the day. The basal insulins most widely used are Levemir® (insulin detemir from NOVO NORDISK) and Lantus® (insulin glargine from SANOFI-AVENTIS). It will be noted, in the interests of being thorough, that NPH (NPH insulin for Neutral Protamine Hagedorn; Humuline NPH®, Insulatard®) is the oldest basal insulin. This formulation is the result of a precipitation of human insulin (anionic at neutral pH) using a cationic protein, protamine. The resulting microcrystals are dispersed in an aqueous suspension and dissolve slowly after subcutaneous injection. This slow dissolution provides a prolonged release of the insulin. However, this release does not provide a constant concentration of insulin over time. The release profile is bell-shaped and only lasts between 12 and 16 hours. It is therefore injected twice a day. This NPH basal insulin is much less effective than the modern basal insulins, Levemir® and Lantus®. NPH is an intermediate-action basal insulin. The principle of NPH has evolved with the appearance of the fast-acting insulin analogs to give products called “Premix” that offer both a fast action and an interediate action. NovoLog Mix® (NOVO NORDISK) and Humalog Mix® (ELI LILLY) are formulations comprising a fast-acting insulin analog, Novolog® and Humalog®, partially complexed with protamine. These formulations thus contain insulin analog microcrystals, the action of which is termed intermediate, and an insulin component that has remained soluble, the action of which is fast. These formulations clearly offer the advantage of a fast-acting insulin, but they also have the defect of NPH, i.e. a limited duration of action of between 12 and 16 hours and an insulin with a “bell-shaped” release profile. However, these products allow patients to give themselves, in one go, an injection of an intermediate-action basal insulin with a fast-acting prandial insulin. As it happens, there are many patients who are anxious to reduce their number of injections. The basal insulins currently marketed and currently in clinical development can be classified according to the technical solution which makes it possible to obtain the prolonged action, and, to date, two approaches are used. The first approach, which is that of insulin detemir, is binding to albumin in vivo. Insulin detemir is an analog, which is soluble at pH 7, and which comprises a fatty acid (tetradecanoyl) side chain attached at position B29 which, in vivo, enables this insulin to associate with albumin. Its prolonged action is mainly due to this affinity for albumin after subcutaneous injection. However, its pharmacokinetic profile does not make it possible to cover a day, which means that it is most commonly used as two injections per day. Other basal insulins which are soluble at pH 7, such as Degludec®, are currently in development. Degludec® also comprises a fatty acid side chain attached to the insulin (hexadecandioyl-γ-L-Glu). The second approach, which is that of insulin glargine, is precipitation at physiological pH. Insulin glargine is a human insulin analog obtained by elongation of the C-terminal part of the B chain of human insulin with two arginine residues, and by substitution of asparagine residue A21 with a glycine residue (U.S. Pat. No. 5,656,722). The addition of two arginine residues was considered in order to adjust the pI (isoelectric point) of insulin glargine to physiological pH, and thus render this human insulin analog insoluble in physiological medium. Also, the substitution of A21 was considered in order to render insulin glargine stable at acid pH and thus to be able to formulate it in the form of an injectable solution at acid pH. During subcutaneous injection, the passing of insulin glargine from an acid pH (pH 4-4.5) to a physiological pH (neutral pH) causes it to precipitate under the skin. The slow redissolution of the insulin glargine microparticles provides a slow and prolonged action. The hypoglycemic effect of insulin glargine is virtually constant over a period of 24 hours, which enables most patients to limit themselves to a single injection per day. Insulin glargine is today considered to be the best basal insulin on the market. However, the necessarily acid pH of the formulations of basal insulins, the isoelectric point of which is between 5.8 and 8.5, of insulin glargine type, can be a real drawback since this acid pH of the insulin glargine formulation sometimes causes pain at the injection in patients and especially prevents any formulation with other proteins and in particular with prandial insulins, since the latter are not stable at acid pH. The impossibility of formulating a prandial insulin at acid pH comes from the fact that a prandial insulin undergoes, under these conditions, a side reaction consisting of deamidation in position A21, which does not make it possible to meet the requirement of the US Pharmacopeia, namely less than 5% of by-products after 4 weeks at 30° C. Thus, no one has to date sought to solubilize these basal insulins, of insulin glargine type, the isoelectric point of which is between 5.8 and 8.5, at neutral pH while at the same time maintaining a difference in solubility between the in vitro medium (the container) and the in vivo medium (under the skin), independently of the pH. From the analysis of the compositions described in the literature and the patents, it appears that the insolubility at pH 7 of the basal insulins, of the insulin glargine type, is a prerequisite for having a slow action. Indeed, the principle of how basal insulins of insulin glargine type, the isoelectric point of which is between 5.8 and 8.5, function is that they are soluble at acid pH and precipitate at physiological pH. This diverts those skilled in the art from any solution in which the insulin of insulin glargine type would be solubilized at pH 6-8 while keeping its essential property which is that of precipitating in subcutaneous medium. Furthermore, this acid pH of the formulations of basal insulins, the isoelectric point of which is between 5.8 and 8.5, of insulin glargine type, even prevents any extemporaneous combination with prandial insulins at neutral pH. Indeed, a recent clinical study, presented at the 69th Scientific Sessions of the American Diabetes Association, New Orleans, La., Jun. 5-9, 2009, made it possible to verify this limitation of the use of insulin glargine. A dose of insulin glargine and a dose of prandial insulin (in the case in point, insulin lispro) were mixed just before injection (E. Cengiz et al., 2010; Diabetes care—33(5): 1009-12). This experiment made it possible to demonstrate a significant delay in the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of the prandial insulin, possibly giving rise to postprandial hyperglycemia and to nocturnal hypoglycemia. This study clearly confirms the incompatibility of insulin glargine with the fast-acting insulins currently on the market. Moreover, the instruction leaflet for Lantus®, the commercial product based on insulin glargine from the company SANOFI-AVENTIS, explicitly informs users not to mix with a solution of prandial insulin, whatever it may be, owing to the serious risk of modifying the pharmacokinetics and the pharmacodynamics of the insulin glargine and/or of the prandial insulin mixed together. However, from a therapeutic point of view, it has been demonstrated, as illustrated hereinafter, that treatments combining either an insulin glargine and a prandial insulin, or an insulin glargine and a GLP-1 analog, are of real interest. As regards the combination of an insulin glargine and a prandial insulin, clinical studies made public during the 70th annual scientific sessions of the American Diabetes Association (ADA) of 2010, abstract 2163-PO and abstract number 0001-LB, in particular those carried out by the company SANOFI-AVENTIS, showed that treatments which combine Lantus®, insulin glargine and a prandial insulin are much more effective than treatments based on products of the “Premix” type, Novolog Mix® or Humalog Mix®. As regards the combination of an insulin glargine and a GLP-1 analog, the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) approved, in October 2011, the injection of exenatide (Byetta®, AMYLIN PHARMACEUTICALS, Inc. and ELI LILLY and Company) as therapy supplementing insulin glargine for patients suffering from type II diabetes who are not able to achieve control of their blood glucose level with the basal insulin analog alone. It so happens, owing to the fact that the very principle, set out above, of basal insulins, the isoelectric point of which is between 5.8 and 8.5, is that they are soluble at acid pH and precipitate at physiological pH, all the solutions proposed for combining them with other products, such as prandial insulins or GLP-1 analogs or derivatives, are based on tests for solubilization of the prandial insulins or GLP-1 analogs or derivatives at acid pH, see for example WO2007/121256, WO2009/021955, WO2011/144673, WO2011/147980 or else WO2009/063072. For example, as regards the combinations of insulin glargine and fast-acting insulin, the company BIODEL has described, in particular in patent application U.S. Pat. No. 7,718,609, compositions comprising a basal insulin and a prandial insulin at a pH of between 3.0 and 4.2 in the presence of a chelating agent and of polyacids. This patent teaches how to make compatible a prandial insulin at acid pH in the presence of insulin glargine. It does not teach how to prepare a combination of insulin of insulin glargine type and of a prandial insulin at neutral pH. Likewise by way of example, as regards the solubilization of insulin glargine at neutral pH and the combinations with a GLP-1 analog, mention will be made of patent application WO2011/144676 published on Nov. 24, 2011, in the name of SANOFI-AVENTIS, which describes formulations, at pH 9.5, of glargine with the cyclodextrin SVE4-β-CYD in which the solubility of glargine is improved from 0.75 mM to 1.25 mM. This application also mentions compositions additionally comprising a GLP-1, although they are not exemplified. The solubilizing effect at pH 7.4 in a phosphate buffer is mentioned. These results of solubilization at pH 7.4 are described in the publication entitled “Effect of sulfobutyl ether-β-cyclodextrin on bioavailability of insulin glargine and blood glucose level after subcutaneous injection to rats” (International Journal of Pharmaceutics, 419 (2011), 71-76) in FIG. 3A. The sulfobutyl ether-β-cyclodextrin improves the solubility of the insulin glargine at pH 7.4 from 5 μM to 8 μM, which is of no therapeutic interest, since the commercial concentration of insulin glargine is 600 μM (100 IU/ml). The problem has thus not been satisfactorily solved by the invention described in this patent application. To our knowledge, a formulation which is stable at physiological pH, comprising a basal insulin, the isoelectric point of which is between 5.8 and 8.5, alone or in combination with a prandial insulin and/or a gut hormone, in which the solubility of the insulin is sufficient for a therapeutic treatment, has therefore never been described. The present invention, by solving this problem of solubility at a pH between 6.6 and 7.8, makes it possible: to propose an injectable composition, intended for the treatment of diabetes, comprising a basal insulin, the isoelectric point of which is between 5.8 and 8.5, in the form of a homogeneous solution at a pH of between 6.6 and 7.8, while at the same time retaining its biological activity and its action profile;to propose an injectable composition in the form of a homogeneous solution at a pH of between 6.6 and 7.8, also comprising a combination of a basal insulin, the isoelectric point of which is between 5.8 and 8.5, and of a prandial insulin without modification of the activity profile of the prandial insulin which is soluble at pH 6-8 and unstable at acid pH, while at the same time maintaining the slow action profile specific to the basal insulin;to propose an injectable composition in the form of a homogeneous solution at a pH of between 6.6 and 7.8, also comprising a combination of a basal insulin, the isoelectric point of which is between 5.8 and 8.5, and of a gut hormone derivative or analog, such as GLP-1 or glucagon-like peptide-1,to reduce the number of injections in the context of the treatment of diabetes,for said compositions to comply with the requirements of the US and European Pharmacopeias. Surprisingly, the compositions according to the invention make it possible to solubilize at a pH of between 6.6 and 7.8 a basal insulin, the isoelectric point of which is between 5.8 and 8.5. Surprisingly, the compositions according to the invention make it possible to maintain the duration of the hypoglycemic activity of the basal insulin, the isoelectric point of which is between 5.8 and 8.5, despite its solubilization at a pH of between 6.6 and 7.8 before injection. This notable property comes from the fact that the insulin of insulin glargine type solubilized at a pH of between 6.6 and 7.8 in the composition of the invention precipitates in subcutaneous medium through a change in composition of the medium. The element which triggers the precipitation of the insulin of insulin glargine type is no longer the pH modification, but a modification of the composition of the environment when the pharmaceutical composition passes from the container to the physiological medium. Surprisingly, in the combinations of insulin of insulin glargine type with a prandial insulin, which are subjects of the invention, the fast action of the prandial insulin is preserved despite the precipitation of the insulin of glargine type in subcutaneous medium. The solution according to the invention which makes it possible to solubilize the basal insulin, the isoelectric point of which is between 5.6 and 3.5, at a pH of between 6.6 and 7.8 preserves its biological activity. In the combinations of the insulin of insulin glargine type with a prandial insulin, which are subjects of the invention, the fast action of the prandial insulin is preserved despite the precipitation of the insulin of insulin glargine type in subcutaneous medium. Furthermore, the presence of the prandial insulin does not modify the solubility of the basal insulin at a pH of between 6.6 and 7.8 and likewise does not modify the precipitation properties of the basal insulin. The invention relates to a composition in the form of an injectable aqueous solution, the pH of which is between 6.6 and 7.8, comprising at least: a) a basal insulin, the isoelectric point pI of which is between 5.8 and 8.5;b) a co-polyamino acid bearing carboxylate charges and substituted with hydrophobic groups, chosen from the co-polyamino acids of formula I: in which: A independently represents either a —CH2— group (aspartic unit) or a —CH2—CH2— group (glutamic unit),R1 is a radical chosen from the group consisting of an H, a linear C2 to C10 acyl group, a branched C3 to C10 acyl group, a benzyl, a terminal “amino acid” unit and a pyroglutamate,R2 is an —NR′R″ radical, R′ and R″ which may be identical or different, being chosen from the group consisting of H, linear or branched or cyclic C2 to C30 alkyls and benzyl, and said R′ and R″ alkyls being alkyls which can together form one or more saturated, unsaturated and/or aromatic rings which are carbon-based and/or which can comprise heteroatoms, chosen from the group consisting of O, N and S.R′3 is a radical chosen from the group consisting of the radicals of formulae —OR3, II or II′: in which * indicates the site of attachment of the co-polyamino acid R3 and R″3, which may be identical or different, represent an H or a cationic entity chosen from the group comprising metal cations, —R is a radical chosen from the group consisting of a saturated or unsaturated, linear or branched C8 to C30 radical which can comprise heteroatoms or a C8 to C30 radical which can form rings which are carbon-based or which can comprise heteroatoms, which are saturated, unsaturated and/or aromatic, said rings possibly being ortho-condensed or ped-condensed, or a radical of formula III or III′ as defined below: in which * indicates the site of attachment to the co-polyamino acid, and R4, and R′4, which may be identical or different, represent an H, a cationic entity chosen from the group comprising metal cations, an R″4 radical or an R′″4 radical, and at least one of R4 and R′4 is equal to R″4, R″4 represents a saturated or unsaturated, linear or branched C8 to C30 radical which can comprise heteroatoms or a C8 to C30 radical which can form rings which are carbon-based or which can comprise heteroatoms, which are saturated, unsaturated and/or aromatic, said rings possibly being ortho-condensed or peri-condensed,R′″4 represents a saturated or unsaturated, linear or branched C1 to C7 radical which can comprise heteroatoms or a C1 to C7 radical which can form rings which are carbon-based or which can comprise heteroatoms, which are saturated, unsaturated and/or aromatic, said rings possibly being ortho-condensed or peri-condensed, andB independently represents either a —CH1— group (aspartic unit) or a —CH2CH2— group (glutamic unit),R5 is a radical chosen from the group consisting of an H, a linear or branched C1 to C4 alkyl or a benzyl group, n/(n+m) is defined as the molar degree of grafting with hydrophobic radical of the monomeric units and is between 1 and 50 mol %, n+m represents the degree of polymerization of the co-polyamino acid, i.e. the average number of monomeric units per chain of co-polyamino acid, and 5≦n+m≦1000.

Next, the insulin glargine is assayed in the supernatant by RP-HPLC. The insulin glargine is found predominantly in a precipitated form. Part D: Demonstration of the Pharmacodynamic Properties of the Compositions According to the Invention Example D1 Protocol for Measuring the Pharmacodynamics of the Insulin Solutions 10 domestic pigs weighing approximately 50 kg, previously catheterized at the level of the jugular, are deprived of food for 2.5 hours before the beginning of the experiment. During the hour preceding the insulin injection, 3 blood samples are taken in order to determine the basal glucose level. The insulin injection is given subcutaneously in the neck, under the ear of the animal using the Novopen insulin pen fitted with a 31 G needle. In the case of the double injection given as a control, an injection is given on each side of the neck. Blood samples are then taken every 10 minutes for 1 hour and then every 30 minutes up to 2 hours, and then every hour up to 16 hours. After each sample is taken, the catheter is rinsed with a dilute heparin solution. A drop of blood is taken in order to determine the blood glucose level by means of a glucometer. The glucose pharmacodynamics curves are then plotted and compared. Example D2 Results of Pharmacodynamics of the Insulin Solutions Co- Number Exam- polyamino of ples Insulin Doses acid pigs B2 Double Lispro 100 IU/ml 0.05 IU/kg — 10 B4 injection Glargine 100 0.15 IU/kg IU/ml B32 Combined Lispro + glargine 0.2 IU/kg 5 8 injection (100 IU/ml/300 IU/ml) The pharmacodynamics results obtained with the formulations described in examples B2 and B4 are given in FIG. 1. According to the invention, the analysis of these curves shows (FIG. 1) that the combined insulin glargine (300 IU/ml/insulin lispro (100 IU/ml) formulation at pH 7 (triangles L) with co-polyamino add 5 of example B32 as excipient behaves similarly to the control double injection (solid squares ▪) of formulation B2 and B4. The drop in blood glucose level in the first 30 minutes is similar for the two formulations, indicating that the presence of co-polyamine acid 5 does not disrupt the fast nature of the insulin lispro. Likewise, the profiles between 30 min and 4 h corresponding to the end of the fast-acting insulin and between 4 h and 16 h corresponding to the basal insulin are similar for the control double injection and for the formulation. The combination of the two insulins lispro and glargine in the presence of co-polyamino acid 5 does not therefore change the profile of these two insulins. 1.
