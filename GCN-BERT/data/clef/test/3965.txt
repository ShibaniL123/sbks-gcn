DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides linkers that are conjugated to a suitable group such as an amine group in a payload molecule by alkylation. In one embodiment, the present invention provides hydrophilic linkers comprising one or more hydroxyl groups that are conjugated to a suitable group such as an amine group in a payload molecule by alkylation. The conjugation of the linker by alkylation to form a secondary or tertiary amine in the payload molecule provides several advantages, such as i) retaining of the chemical characteristics of the amine group such as basicity, in contrast to e.g. amide bond formation, ii) formation of a flexible and relatively small chemical group in contrast to e.g. rigid and bulky amide bond, iii) high specificity of the alkylation reaction, and iv) relatively mild reaction conditions suitable for labile payload molecules. The presence of one or more hydroxyl groups in the hydrophilic linker provides several advantages, such as i) higher water solubility of the final product, ii) ability to use higher concentrations of the conjugate in aqueous solutions, iii) ability to link a higher number of payload molecules per molecule of cell binder, iv) ability to achieve higher hydrophilic conjugate concentration inside the target cell, and v) improved sensitivity of multidrug resistant cells.

In one embodiment of the present invention, the pharmaceutical composition comprises a composition for e.g. oral, parenteral, transdermal, intraluminal, intraarterial, intrathecal and/or intranasal administration or for direct injection into tissue. Administration of the pharmaceutical composition may be effected in different ways, e.g. by intravenous, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous, intramuscular, topical or intradermal administration. The pharmaceutical composition of the present invention may further comprise a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Examples of suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers are well known in the art and include e.g. phosphate buffered saline solutions, water, oil/water emulsions, wetting agents, and liposomes. Compositions comprising such carriers may be formulated by methods well known in the art. Dosages and dosage regimens, as known in the art, may vary depending on a number of factors and may be determined depending on e.g. the patient's age, size, the nature of the conjugate, and the administration route. The pharmaceutical composition may further comprise other components such as vehicles, additives, preservatives, other pharmaceutical compositions administrated concurrently, and the like. In one embodiment of the present invention growth of selected cell populations is modulated by contacting the pharmaceutical composition with said cell populations. The present invention also relates to a method for modulating growth of a cell population, comprising the step of contacting the linker-payload conjugate or cell binder-linker-payload conjugate according to the invention or the pharmaceutical composition according to the invention with the cell population. In this context, the term “a cell population” should be understood as referring to one or more cell populations. The linker-payload molecule conjugates of the present invention can be contacted in vitro, in vivo and/or ex vivo to modulate the growth of a cell population, for example, cancer cells, including, for example, cancer of the blood, plasma, lung, breast, colon, prostate, kidney, pancreas, brain, bones, ovary, testes, and lymphatic organs; more preferably lung, colon prostrate, plasma, blood or colon cancer; or in autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, and multiple sclerosis; graft rejections, such as renal transplant rejection, liver transplant rejection, lung transplant rejection, cardiac transplant rejection, and bone marrow transplant rejection; graft versus host disease; viral infections, such as CMV infection, HIV infection, and AIDS; and parasite infections, such as giardiasis, amoebiasis, schistosomiasis, and the like; or, for example, low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 LRP-1 expressing cells such as fibrosarcoma cells. “Modulating the growth of selected cell populations” includes inhibiting the proliferation of said cells from dividing to produce more cells; reducing the rate of increase in cell division as compared, for example, to untreated cells; killing selected cell populations; and/or preventing selected cell populations (such as cancer cells) from metastasizing. The growth of selected cell populations can be modulated in vitro, in vivo or ex vivo.

(e.g. at room temperature i.e. about 20° C.) for from about 0.5 hour to about 24 hours (e.g. five hours at about 20°). The exact molar excess of the modification reagent, reaction temperature and reaction time are optimized for each antibody individually so that antigen binding and effector functions of the antibody are not compromised, or to about on average 2-4 modified lysine side chains per antibody molecule unless otherwise indicated. After the reaction the modified antibody and non-reacted modification reagent are separated by e.g. purification of the antibody by protein G chromatography, filtration or dialysis, or other well-known methods. Preparation of the antibody-drug conjugates is done by Cu(I)-catalyzed alkyne-azide cycloaddition of alkyne-linker-MMAF, e.g. (3), in the presence of Cu(I) stabilizing biocompatible chelator, forming a covalent triazole bond to the linker-MMAF conjugate. The azido-modified protein is dissolved in suitable aqueous buffer solution, e.g. 25 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.3, and per 1 mol of azido-groups in the protein, 2 mol of alkyne-linker-MMAF, 0.5 mol of CuSO4, 5 mol of sodium ascorbate, 2.5 mol of Cu(I) stabilizing biocompatible chelator (e.g. Tris[(1-benzyl-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)methyl]amine, TBTA) are added. Reaction is conducted at RT for 2 hours. The conjugated antibody is purified by size exclusion to give a product with on average 1-4 MMAF per antibody molecule. Example 5 Synthesis of TGTA (tris{[1-(6-D-Galactosyl)-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl]methyl}amine) General experimental details: Reagents and solvents were purchased from commercial sources. Reaction solvents were dried and distilled prior to use when necessary. All reactions containing moisture- or air-sensitive reagents were carried out under an argon atmosphere. The preparation of 1 has been described previously and similar routes were employed in the current synthesis (see for example Yang, J., et al., 2003. J. S. Org. Lett. 5:2223-6). The NMR spectra were recorded with a Bruker Avance spectrometer operating at 600 MHz (1H: 600 MHz, 13C: 150 MHz). Pulse sequences provided by the manufacturer were utilized. The probe temperature during the experiments was kept at 22° C. unless otherwise mentioned. Chemical shifts are expressed on the δ scale (in ppm) using TMS (tetramethylsilane), residual chloroform, acetone, H2O or methanol as internal standards. Coupling constants are given in Hz and provided only once when first encountered. Coupling patterns are given as s, singlet, d, doublet, t, triplet etc. Mass spectra were obtained with a Bruker Ultraflex III MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer operated in positive/negative mode.

The structure of TGTA and its proposed copper(I) chelating mode: Example 6 Synthesis of Cetuximab and Omalizumab Drug Conjugates by Copper(I) Catalyzed Click Reaction To introduce azide-groups into cetuximab or omalizumab, 100 μg (670 pmol) of antibodies in 25 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.3 (80 μl) was incubated with 15-20 molar excess of NHS-PEG4-N3 in DMSO (2 μl) for 2 hours at room temperature. Low molecular weight reagents were removed by Amicon centrifugal filter unit, 30K, with repeated addition of PBS. Antibody-drug conjugates were generated by azide-alkyne cycloaddition reaction as follows: To cetuximab-PEG4-N3 or omalizumab-PEG4-N3 in 25 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.3 (40 μl) was added 20-40× molar excess of N-(6-propargyl-D-galactosyl)-dolastatin 10 in DMSO (2 μl), followed by 10× molar excess of CuSO4 in H2O (1 μl), 50× molar excess of sodium ascorbate in H2O (1 μl) and 25× molar excess of TGTA in H2O (1 μl). Reactions were allowed to proceed at room temperature for 0.5 hour. The drug conjugated antibodies were purified by Amicon centrifugal filter units, 30K, with repeated addition of PBS. The drug-antibody-ratio (DAR) in the conjugates was calculated by isolating the Fc-fragments and light chains. Fc-fragments were released by FabRICATOR enzyme (34 U) at 37° C. for 1.5 hours and recovered with self-manufactured Poros R1 tips by elution with 60% ACN in 0.1% TFA (5 μl). The remaining F(ab′)2 in Poros R1 tip was denatured with 6M guanidine-HCl (30 μl) at 60° C. for 0.5 hour. Disulfide bonds were reduced with 0.1 M dithiothreitol (20 μl) at 60° C. for 0.5 hour. Light chains were eluted with 60% ACN, 0.1% TFA (5 μl). Fc-fragments and light chains were analysed by MALDI-TOF MS using either sinapinic acid or 2,5-dihydroxyacetophenone as the matrix.

To minimize loss of antibody, the reaction was conducted in an Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter unit (30K, 0.5 ml). Low molecular weight reagents were then removed by Amicon centrifugal filter with repeated addition of PBS—5% mannitol—0.1% Tween20. To prepare 2G12-drug conjugate, 50 molar excess of TGTA and sodium ascorbate in H2O (2 μl), 10 molar excess of CuSO4 in H2O (0.34 μl, final concentration 500 μM) and 20 molar excess of N-(6-propargyl-D-galactosyl)-dolastatin 10 in DMSO (4 μl) were added into the solution of 2 nmol of 2G12-PEG4-N3 (40 μl). The reactions were performed at room temperature for 45 minutes. The conjugated antibodies were purified by Amicon centrifugal filter as above. The DAR of the 2G12-drug conjugate was calculated by isolating the Fc-fragments and light chains followed by MALDI-TOF MS analysis as described in Example 6.

Low molecular weight reagents were removed by Amicon centrifugal filter unit, 30K, with repeated additions of PBS. Antibody-drug conjugates were generated by azide-alkyne cycloaddition reaction as follows: To 8 mg of trastuzumab-PEG4-N3 samples in 25 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.3 (1153 μl) was added 20× molar excess of N-(6-propargyl-D-galactosyl)-dolastatin 10 in DMSO (10 μl), followed by 10× molar excess of CuSO4 in H2O (2 μl), 50× molar excess of sodium ascorbate in H2O (5 μl) and 50× molar excess of TGTA in H2O (30 μl). Final reaction volumes were 1200 μl. Reactions were allowed to proceed at room temperature for 1 hour. The drug conjugated antibodies were purified by Amicon centrifugal filter units, 30K, with repeated additions of PBS. The DAR of the trastuzumab-drug conjugates was calculated by isolating the Fc-fragments and light chains followed by MALDI-TOF MS analysis as described in Example 6. The DAR obtained with reaction (1) was on average 1, while that with reaction (2) was about 2-3.

Example 11 In Vitro Cytotoxicity of Drug Derivatives, Cell Binder-Drug Conjugates and Antibody-Drug Conjugates Human ovarian cancer cell line SKOV-3 (EGFR+HER2+), head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma cell line HSC-2 (EGFR+) and multidrug-resistant colorectal carcinoma cell line LS513 (EGFR+) were from the ATCC (Manassas, Va., USA). The cells were grown according to the manufacturer's recommendations. In vitro cytotoxicity assays with the cells were performed as in Example 2 above. Results of exemplary assays are shown in FIG. 2, in which cetuximab-MODO and omalizumab-MODO (monomethyldolastatin 10) conjugates were prepared by copper(I) catalyzed click reaction between compound 12 and azide-modified antibodies. Cetuximab-VC-MODO contains valine-citrulline peptidase sensitive linker without a hydrophilic linker moiety. LSKL-MODO was prepared by conjugating the tetrapeptide with MODO as described in the Examples. All drug concentrations in the y-axis were normalized to actual monomethyldolastatin 10 drug content in each conjugate. A, Cytotoxicity assay with HSC-2 head-and-neck cancer cells. Both cetuximab-MODO and LSKL-MODO were more effective against the cancer cells than either the unspecific antibody-drug conjugate prepared from omalizumab or unconjugated cetuximab. B, Cytotoxicity assay with HSC-2 head-and-neck cancer cells. Cetuximab-MODO was more effective against the cancer cells than the unconjugated linker-dolastatin compound 12. C. Cytotoxicity assay with LS513 multi-drug resistant colorectal cancer cells. Cetuximab-MODO (containing hydrophilic linker moiety) was more effective against the drug-resistant cancer cells than cetuximab-VC-MODO (containing linker that releases free unconjugated drug inside cells). Results are further expressed in Table 2 as IC50 values of various experiments. TABLE 2 Cytotoxicity of drug derivatives and anti-body-drug conjugates.

Example 12 In Vivo Efficacy of Anti-HER2 Antibody-Drug Conjugates A non-randomized study of anti-HER2 humanized IgG1 antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs; test substances prepared by conjugating N-(6-propargyl-D-galactosyl)-dolastatin 10 to NHS-PEG4-N3-modified CHO cell produced trastuzumab as described in the preceding Examples) with two different drug-antibody molar ratios (DAR=1 and DAR=3), unconjugated anti-HER2 humanized IgG1 (trastuzumab) and control (phosphate buffered saline, PBS) was carried out in a xenograft nude mouse model to evaluate in vivo efficacy of the ADCs. The study was conducted according to standard guidelines of the test facility and was approved by appropriate ethical committee (University of Turku and Turku University Hospital, Turku, Finland). Human cancer cell line SKOV-3 (ovarian adenocarcinoma) was implanted s.c. (3×106 cells in 50% matrigel) in one flank of female, adult Harlan HSD:athymic nude Foxn1nu mice. The first dose of the test or control substances was administered when the tumors had grown to average volume of 100 mm3 (4-8 mm diameter). Tumor length (L) and width (W) were recorded in mm. Tumor volumes (V) in mm3 were calculated according to the formula V=½L×W2. Mice with different sized tumors were equally divided into study groups to obtain homogenous groups. TABLE 3 Study groups and dosing of test substances. Study Animal Test group # substance Dose I 1-3 anti-HER2 ADC, 10 mg/kg (c. 200 DAR = 1 μg/mouse in 100 μl PBS) II 4-6 anti-HER2 ADC, 10 mg/kg (c. 200 DAR = 3 μg/mouse in 100 μl PBS) III 7-9 anti-HER2 IgG1 10 mg/kg (c. 200 μg/mouse in 100 μl PBS) IV 10-12 PBS 100 μl PBS Test and control substances (Table 3) were administered i.v. three times at seven days' intervals. Tumor volume, animal weight and clinical signs and general behavior of the animals were followed twice weekly. Any unusual signs or behavior were recorded. End-point of the study was when the tumors had reached the maximum allowed diameter (17 mm) or eight weeks after first dosing. All animals survived for eight weeks (tumor diameter <17 mm) after first dosing of the test or control substances. Anti-HER2 ADC with drug-to-antibody ratio of 3 (DAR=3) showed the highest anti-tumor activity among the tested compounds (FIG. 3A). Both anti-HER2 ADCs with DAR=1 and DAR=3 inhibited tumor growth more than the unconjugated anti-HER2 antibody and control treatment. Average tumor weight in the end of the experiment was less than 20% in anti-HER2 ADC DAR=3 treated mice compared to the control mice receiving only PBS (FIG. 3B). No symptoms of toxicity were observed in the mice during the study.

Example 13 In Vivo Efficacy of Anti-EGFR Antibody-Drug Conjugates A non-randomized study of the anti-EGFR1 ADC (test substance prepared by conjugating N-(6-propargyl-D-galactosyl)-dolastatin 10 to NHS-PEG4-N3-modified CHO cell produced cetuximab as described in the preceding Examples), unconjugated anti-EGFR1 IgG1 and the control substance (phosphate buffered saline) was carried out in a xenograft nude mouse model to evaluate in vivo efficacy of the ADCs towards SKOV-3 s.c. tumors as described in the preceding Example. Test and control substances were administered i.v. three times at seven days' intervals (Table 4). TABLE 4 Study groups and dosing of test substances. Study Animal Test group # substance Dose I 1-3 anti-EGFR1 ADC 10 mg/kg (c. 200 μg/mouse in 100 μl PBS) II 4-6 anti-EGFR1 10 mg/kg (c. 200 IgG1 μg/mouse in 100 μl PBS) III 7-9 PBS 100 μl PBS All animals in study groups I and II survived for eight weeks (tumor diameter <17 mm) and were euthanized at the same time. One mouse in the control group (PBS) was euthanized due to a large tumor (diameter exceeding 17 mm) before eight weeks had passed from the dosing. Smallest tumors were observed in the study group I receiving anti-EGFR1 ADC treatment (FIG. 4), showing that the anti-EGFR1 ADC showed anti-tumor activity in vivo in subcutaneous SKOV-3 xenograft nude mice. No symptoms of toxicity were observed in the mice during the study. FIG. 4A, Tumor volume in subcutaneous SKOV-3 xenograft mice treated with anti-EGFR1 ADC, anti-EGFR1 IgG antibody or PBS (control).

Tumor volume was recorded eight weeks after the first dosing of test or control substances. Example 14 In Vivo Safety and Clearance Rate of Anti-EGFR1 Antibody-Drug Conjugates Three anti-EGFR1 ADC doses containing between 5 μg drug/kg and 100 μg drug/kg dolastatin 10 derivative in form of anti-EGFR ADC (test substance prepared by conjugating N-(6-propargyl-D-galactosyl)-dolastatin 10 to NHS-PEG4-N3-modified CHO cell produced cetuximab as described in the preceding Examples) were administered to healthy nude mice to evaluate single-dose safety and clearance rate of the test compounds. The study was conducted according to the standard guidelines of the test facility and was approved by appropriate ethical committee (University of Turku and Turku University Hospital, Turku, Finland). Female, adult healthy Harlan HSD:athymic nude Foxn1nu mice were used in the experiment. The test substances were administered i.v. in 100 μl of phosphate buffered saline (Table 5). Serum samples were collected for 13 days after the injection, after which all mice were euthanized. TABLE 5 Study groups and dosing of test substances.
