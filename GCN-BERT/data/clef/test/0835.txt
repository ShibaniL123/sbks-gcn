EFFECTS OF INVENTION The method of the present invention allows for provision of an excellent method for promoting plant growth. MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION In the present invention, “growth promotion of a plant” (hereinafter may be referred to as “growth promotion”) refers to an increase in the seedling establishment rate, number of healthy leaves, plant length, plant body weight, leaf area, number or weight of seeds or fruits, or number of set flowers or fruits, or the growth of roots. Growth promotion may be quantified using the following parameters: (1) Seedling Establishment Rate Seeds of plants are sown, for example, in the soil, on a filter paper, on an agar culture medium or on sand, and then allowed to undergo cultivation for a given period of time. During the entire or partial cultivation period, abiotic stress is applied, and the percentage of surviving seedlings is examined. (2) Number or Ratio of Healthy Leaves With respect to each of plants, the number of healthy leaves is counted and the total number of healthy leaves is examined. Alternatively, the ratio of the number of healthy leaves to the number of all leaves of plants is examined. (3) Plant Length With respect to each of plants, the length from the base of the stem of the above-ground part to the branches and leaves at the tip is measured. (4) Plant Body Weight The above-ground part of each of plants is cut and the weight is measured to determine a fresh weight of plants. Alternatively, the cut sample is dried and the weight is measured to determine a dry weight of plants. (5) Leaf Area A photograph of plants is taken by a digital camera and the area of a green portion in the photograph is determined by image analysis software, for example, Win ROOF (manufactured by MITANI CORPORATION), or plants are visually evaluated to obtain a leaf area of plants. (6) Leaf Color After sampling leaves of plants, the chlorophyll content is measured using a chlorophyll gauge (for example, SPAD-502, manufactured by Konica Minolta Holdings, Inc.) to determine the leaf color. The plants are photographed with a digital camera and the green area in the photograph is measured by extracting color for quantification and using image analysis software, such as Win ROOF (manufactured by MITANI CORPORATION). (7) Number or Weight of Seeds or Fruits Plants are grown until they reach fructification or ripening of seeds or fruits, and then the number of fruits per plant is counted or the total weight of fruits per plant is measured. After cultivating plants until seeds undergo ripening, elements constituting the yield, such as the number of ears, ripening rate and thousand kernel weight are examined. (8) Flower Setting Rate, Fruit Setting Rate, Seed Setting Rate and Seed Filling Rate After cultivating plants until they bear fruits, the number of flower setting and the number of fruit setting are counted to calculate the fruit setting rate % (100×number of fruit setting/number of flower setting). After seeds are ripe, the numbers of set seeds and filled seeds are counted to calculate the seed setting rate (%) ((Number of set seeds/Number of set flowers)×100) and the seed filling rate (%) ((Number of filled seeds/Number of set seeds)×100). (9) Increase in the Growth of Roots Plants are cultivated in soil or hydroponics. Then, the length of roots is measured or the roots are cut and measured the fresh weight of the roots. In the method of the present invention, when a plant is treated with the present compound, the plant may be an entire plant or part thereof (e.g., stem and leaf, shoot, flower, fruit, panicle, seed, bulb, tuber and root).

In the method of the present invention, the plant to be treated with the present compound may be a plant which has been or is to be exposed to an abiotic stress. Such “abiotic stress” may be quantified as “intensity of stress” according to the equation shown below. The intensity value may be 105 to 200, preferably 110 to 180, and more preferably 120 to 160. [in-line-formulae]“Intensity of stress”=100×“any one of the plant phenotypes in plants not being exposed to an abiotic stress”/“the one of the plant phenotypes in plants being exposed to the abiotic stress conditions” Equation (I)[/in-line-formulae] As used herein, an “abiotic stress” is defined as a stress that leads to growth inhibition of a plant, when the plant is exposed to an abiotic stress condition, such as temperature stress, i.e., high- or low-temperature stress, water stress, i.e., drought stress or excessive moisture stress, or salt stress, due to reduced physiological function of the cells of the plant and deterioration of the physiological state of the plant. The high-temperature stress refers to a stress that plants experience when they are exposed to a temperature exceeding the suitable temperature for their growth or germination. Specifically, the high-temperature stress may be caused under conditions in which the average growth temperature is 25° C. or higher, more harshly 30° C. or higher, and even more harshly 35° C. or higher in the environment in which the plants are cultivated. The low-temperature stress refers to a stress that plants experience when they are exposed, to a temperature lower than the suitable temperature for their growth or germination. Specifically, the low-temperature stress may be caused under conditions in which the average growth temperature is 15° C. or lower, more harshly 10° C. or lower, and even more harshly 5° C. or lower in the environment in which the plants are cultivated. The drought stress refers to a stress that plants experience when they are exposed to a moisture environment that retards their growth by preventing water absorption due to a reduction in the water content of the soil caused by a shortage of rainfall or irrigation. Specifically, the drought stress may be caused under conditions in which the water content in the soil in which the plants are grown is 15% by weight or less, more harshly 10% by weight or less, and even more harshly 7.5% by weight or less, although these values may vary depending on the type of the soil, or in which the pF value of the soil in which the plants are grown is 2.3 or more, more harshly 2.7 or more, and even more harshly 3.0 or more, although these values may vary depending on the type of the soil. The excessive moisture stress refers to a stress that plants experience when they are exposed to a moisture environment in which the water content in the soil is excessively high, so that the growth of the plants is inhibited. Specifically, the excessive moisture stress may be caused under conditions in which the water content in the soil in which the plants are grown is 30% by weight or more, more harshly 40% by weight or more, and even more harshly 50% by weight or more, although these values may vary depending on the type of the soil, or in which the pF value of the soil in which the plants are grown is 1.7 or less, more harshly 1.0 or less, and even more harshly 0.3 or less, although these values may vary depending on the type of the soil. The pF value of soil may be determined according to the “Method for pF Value Measurement” on pages 61 and 62 of “Dojyo, Shokubutsu Eiyo, Kankyo Jiten (Encyclopedia of Soil, Plant Nutrition and Environment)” (TAIYOSHA Co., Ltd., 1994, Matsuzaka et al.). The salt stress refers to a stress that plants experience when they are exposed to an environment that retards their growth by preventing water absorption due to an increase in the osmotic pressure caused by accumulation of salts contained in the soil or hydroponic solution in which the plants are cultivated. Specifically, the salt stress may be caused under conditions in which the osmotic pressure potential due to the salts contained in the soil or hydroponic solution is 0.2 MPa (NaCl concentration of 2,400 ppm) or higher, harshly 0.25 MPa or higher, and more harshly 0.30 MPa or higher. The osmotic pressure in soil can be calculated according to Raoult's equation, shown below, by diluting the soil with water and analyzing the supernatant for salt concentration: [in-line-formulae]π (atm)=cRT Raoult's Equation[/in-line-formulae] R=0.082 (L·atm/mol·K) T=Absolute temperature (K) c=Ion molar concentration (mol/L) 1 atm=0.1 MPa EXAMPLES While the present invention will be more specifically described by way of formulation examples, seed treatment examples, and test examples in the following, the present invention is not limited to the following examples. In the following examples, the “part” represents “part by weight” unless otherwise specified.

Test Example 1 Evaluation Test for Promotion of Root Growth in Hydroponics of Rice <Test Plants> Rice (cultivar: Nipponbare) <Cultivation and Compound Treatment> A 1/10,000 volume of each DMSO solution containing each of the present compounds 1 to 4 at 10,000 ppm was added to a Hoagland solution for hydroponics (Hoagland and Amon, California Agricultural Experiment Station 1950 Circular 347 pp. 34) at ¼ concentration to obtain a solution for hydroponics containing each of the present compounds 1 to 4 at 1 ppm. These solutions were used in the treated-group. In a non-treated group, a solution for hydroponics obtained by adding a Hoagland solution for hydroponics at ¼ concentration to a 1/10,000 volume of DMSO was used. The rice seeds were immersed in an aqueous solution of 1% sodium hypochlorite for 10 minutes, followed by 70% ethanol solution to sterilize their surfaces. After that, the seeds were washed with distilled water. The sterilized seeds were immersed in each solution for hydroponics containing the test compound at 1 ppm, and incubated at a temperature of 28° C. for 3 days under dark conditions to stimulate the germination of the seeds. Then, 30 ml of each solution for hydroponics containing the test compound at 1 ppm was dispensed into a plastic tube (20 mm in diameter×113 mm in height) covered with a cardboard on the lateral surface for blocking a light. A float made of a styrene board and a vinyl mesh was placed on the water surface of each solution for hydroponics, and the rice seeds obtained after the stimulation of germination were placed on the float. The seeds were cultivated for 3 days under the conditions of an illuminance of 4,000 lux at the top of the tube, a temperature of 26° C., a humidity of 50%, and a day length of 16 hours. <Evaluation Method> The root length of the rice seedlings obtained after the cultivation was measured by using WinRHIZO system (manufactured by REGENT INSTRUMENTS).
