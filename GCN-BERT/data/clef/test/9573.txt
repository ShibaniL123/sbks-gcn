WATER FLOSSER TIP HAVING A CONTAINER FOR TREATMENT TABLETS TECHNICAL FIELD [0001] The embodiments described herein relate generally to dental accessories, and more particularly, to a water flosser having a container for a tablet. BACKGROUND ART [0002] Brushing your teeth with a toothbrush and flossing your teeth with dental floss is not sufficient for deep cleaning the areas between your teeth. Thus, a lot of people use water flossers to clean the areas between their teeth. However, conventional water flossers simply pass pressurized water through the device to clean the areas between your teeth and do not include a convenient way to provide treatment deep into the gum pockets to address periodontal diseases. [0003] Therefore, what is needed is a water flosser capable of providing treatment deep into gum pockets. DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION [0004] Some embodiments of the present disclosure include a water flosser handle for providing treatment deep into a user's gum pockets. The water flosser handle may include a chamber configured to hold a treatment tablet, a flosser tip attached to a distal end of the handle, and a water supply tube attached to a proximal end of the handle. The handle may be configured to allow passage of pressurized water therethrough into a user's mouth. A treatment tablet may be positioned within the chamber such that the water pressure of the water configured to flow through the handle at least partially dissolves and transports the treatment tablet into the user's mouth and gums.

BEST MODE OF THE INVENTION [0015] In the following detailed description of the invention, numerous details, examples, and embodiments of the invention are described. However, it will be clear and apparent to one skilled in the art that the invention is not limited to the embodiments set forth and that the invention can be adapted for any of several applications. [0016] The device of the present disclosure may be used to provide treatment deep into the gum pockets of a user and may comprise the following elements. This list of possible constituent elements is intended to be exemplary only, and it is not intended that this list be used to limit the device of the present application to just these elements. Persons having ordinary skill in the art relevant to the present disclosure may understand there to be equivalent elements that may be substituted within the present disclosure without changing the essential function or operation of the device. 1. Water Flosser Handle 2. Treatment Cavity or Chamber [0017] The various elements of the water flosser for providing a treatment to a user's gum pockets of the present disclosure may be related in the following exemplary fashion. It is not intended to limit the scope or nature of the relationships between the various elements and the following examples are presented as illustrative examples only. [0018] By way of example, and referring to Figs. 1-8, some embodiments of the invention include a water flosser handle for providing treatment deep into a user's gum pockets, the water flosser handle comprising a chamber configured to hold a treatment tablet 20, a flosser tip 10 attached to a distal end 14 of the handle, and a water supply tube 28 attached to a proximal end 22 of the handle, wherein the handle is configured to allow passage of pressurized water therethrough into a user's mouth, and the treatment tablet 20 is positioned within the chamber such that the water pressure of the water configured to flow through the handle at least partially dissolves and transports the treatment tablet into 20 the user's mouth and gums. [0019] As shown in Figs. 1-6, some embodiments of the water flosser handle comprise a tip 10 extending from an distal end 14, a proximal end 22 removably attached to the distal end 14, the proximal end 22 comprising a cavity or chamber configured to hold a treatment, such as a treatment in tablet form 20, and a water supply tube 28 extending from the proximal end 22, the water supply tube 28 configured to removably attach to a conventional water flosser 32. The distal end 14 and the proximal end 22 may be removably attached using any conventional connecting mechanism, so long as a watertight seal is formed between the distal end 14 and the proximal end 22. For example, in some embodiments, the proximal end 22 comprises at least one lock knob 24 configured to engage with at least one lock knob slot 26 in the distal end 14. When the lock knob 24 is inserted into the lock knob slot 26 and the distal end 14 is rotated, the distal end 14 and the proximal end 22 may be connected with a watertight seal. Also, as shown in Figs. 2 and 3, the chamber walls of the proximal end 22 may have such a size that they can be enveloped by the distal end 14. [0020] Embodiments of the device may also comprise additional elements positioned within the chamber of the proximal end 22. For example, a pair of diffusers 18 (or screens) also be positioned within the chamber, such that the tablet 20 is sandwiched between the two diffusers 18. The diffusers 18 may slow down the rate of dissolution of the tablet 20 when the device is in use. Additionally, an O-ring 16 may be placed above the top diffuser 18, such that the O-ring is positioned between the diffuser 18 and the distal end 14, as shown in Figs. 2 and 3. [0021] As mentioned above, and as shown in Fig. 5, the proximal end 22 may have a water supply tube 28 extending therefrom, wherein the water supply tube 28 may be configured to engage with a conventional water flosser 32, such that the device of the present disclosure may replace the use of a conventional water flosser tip. For example, the water supply tube 28 may comprise a water supply tube lock notch 30 configured to engage with a ridge in the water flosser 32, wherein water 34 is configured to flow from the water flosser 32, through the water supply tube 28, through the chamber, and finally through the tip and an orifice in the tip end 12 into the mouth of a user 38. The pressure of the water 34 may aid in dissolving and transporting the treatment tablet 20 through the tip 10 and into a user's gum pockets. [0022] Other embodiments of the water flosser handle may comprise a larger, alternate distal end 44 removably attached to an alternate proximal end 52, wherein the alternate distal end 44 comprises a water tube 48 through which water may flow, and an alternate chamber 46 that has an opening on a bottom surface of the alternate distal end 44, which is configured to engage with a stand 54 attached to the alternate proximal end 52. The alternate chamber 46 may comprise an upper gasket 50, which only allows small pieces of the tablet 20 to flow through the remainder of the alternate distal end 44. The stand 54 may have a grate 56 through which water is capable of flowing. A proximal end of the stand 54 may comprise a lower gasket 58 configured to create a watertight seal between the alternate distal end 44 and the alternate proximal end 52 when the alternate distal end 44 is removably attached to the alternate proximal end 52. To use this embodiment of the water flosser, a user 38 may place the tablet 20 on the tablet stand 54 and attach the alternate distal end 44 to the alternate proximal end 52. The user 38 may then turn the water flosser on by, for example, switching a switch 40 to the "on" position, starting the flow of water through the device. The water may flow through the grate 56 in the stand 54 on the alternate proximal end 52 into the alternate chamber 46. The pressure of the water may aid in dissolving and transporting the tablet 20 through the water tube 48 into the flosser tip 42 and into the mouth and, particularly, the gum pockets of a user 38. [0023] In yet further embodiments, the cavity or chamber configured to hold a treatment, for instance a treatment in tablet form, may be located at any other position throughout the handle of the water flosser, such as in the lower handle. [0024] It embodiments, the treatment may be a partially or completely dissolvable tablet. The tablet may contain any desired treatment for aiding in cleaning the mouth and preventing periodontal diseases. For example, the tablet may be mouthwash in tablet form or the tablet may comprise other treatments, such as fluoride, that may aid in the prevention of gum or dental diseases and may combat bad breath. In some embodiments, the tablets may be flavored to encourage people, such as children, to use the tablets. For example, the tablets may be mint-, bubble gum-, or fruit- flavored. [0025] Persons of ordinary skill in the art may appreciate that numerous design configurations may be possible to enjoy the functional benefits of the inventive systems. Thus, given the wide variety of configurations and arrangements of embodiments of the present invention the scope of the invention is reflected by the breadth of the claims below rather than narrowed by the embodiments described above.
