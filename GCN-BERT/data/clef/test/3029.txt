Non-Pyro Balloon Popping System This invention relates to a device for burst or popping a balloon. On occasion it is desirable that a balloon is deliberately burst to allow its contents to escape. Latex balloons filled with confetti, smaller balloons or other material and foil balloons have been burst or "popped" by using a one of three principle methods. A) a pin or similar sharp object on the end of stick or pole, Β) a pin or similar sharp object operated by actuator connected to a compressed air source or by C) using an electric igniter (sometimes referred to as an electric match or e-match). Method A) has limitations in as much as the pole or stick which has the pin attached must be capable of reaching the balloon, and the person using the device will also be visible. Method Β) has limitations in that the actuator containing the pin must have an air hose attached to the actuator and the compressed air source must be accessible and installed in advance of the balloon popping, sometimes requiring long lengths of air hose to be installed. Method C) requires an electric igniter which is triggered by applying a voltage to the igniter, which in turn triggers the combustion of a pyrotechnic composition. The limitation of this method is that the use of a pyrotechnic device in many countries (including the UK) requires specialist training and numerous venues where it would be desirable to perform a balloon pop ban the use of pyrotechnic devices due to the potential risk of injury. What was required. We deduced that what was required was a method to generate a heat source which would be sufficient to melt a small section of a balloon thus creating a weakness which would result in the bursting of the balloon, yet operate on a low voltage and would not require the use of any pyrotechnic composition. It would have to be easy to use with no special skill or specialist knowledge, but be reliable and produce consistent results and be cost effective. We experimented with various materials and methods and identified that a thin gauge of electrical conductive material could produce a high enough heat for a long enough duration to melt the balloons skin, thus popping the balloon. In the process the conductive material is destroyed, but this is acceptable. How the device is constructed. The conductor is coiled in a spring like configuration and is attached to a circuit board, which in turn has wires are attached. The wires can then be attached to a 9ν power source which is sufficient to generate the heat in the wire. The invention will now be described solely by way of example and with reference to the accompanying drawings in which: Figure 1 illustrates the device design and construction of the key components, Figure 2 illustrate the design and construction of the device from the reverse side. Figure 3 illustrates the application of the device on a balloon. In Figure 1, the conductive material 1) in a spring/coil configuration is soldered to a pcb 2) which has a hole 6) through the pcb to help the balloon burst. The pcb 2) has wires 3) soldered to it which are connected to a power source. Figure 2 illustrates the reverse side of the pcb 2). Figure 3 illustrates the pcb 2) is then attached to the balloon 5), by any suitable method that ensures the close proximity of the conductive material 1) to the surface of the balloon. The device can be attached by various methods such as glue, self-adhesive tape, double sided tape or similar. The key principle of the invention is that it uses a safe, non-pyrotechnic based, low voltage heat source to achieve the goal of bursting the balloon. 1. A balloon bursting device that does not use any pyrotechnic or combustible composition to achieve this. 2. The device according to claim 1, uses heat to melt the skin of the balloon, causing it to fail. 3. The device according to claim 1, operates on a low voltage supply. 4. The device according to claim 1, is designed to operate once and is then destroyed. 5. The device requires no specialist training or knowledge.
