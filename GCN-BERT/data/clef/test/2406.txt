Intermediate 52: 5-Chloro-2-methoxy-6-(trifluoromethyl)-[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyridine
To a solution of 1,6-diamino-2-chloro-3-(trifluoromethyl)pyridin-1-ium 2,4,6-trimethylbenzenesulfonate (Intermediate 9, 100 mg, 0.24 mmol) in AcOH (0.3 mL, 5.24 mmol) was added tetramethoxymethane (0.65 mL, 4.86 mmol). The mixture was heated at 70Â° C. for 2 h. After cooling to rt, the solvent was removed in vacuo. The residue was dissolved in EtOAc and washed with sat. aq. NaHCO3. The aqueous layer was extracted twice with EtOAc. The combined organics were washed with brine, dried over Na2SO4 and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated in vacuo. Purification (FCC, SiO2; 0-50% EtOAc/hexanes) afforded a white solid (21 mg, 34%).
