This invention relates to new catalysts for the polymerisation of olefins, in particular for the polymerisation of propylene and ethylene. The catalyst of the invention comprises a metallocene complex along with an aluminoxane and a boron based cocatalyst. The catalyst is in solid form but is free of an external carrier. This combination remarkably gives rise to catalysts with excellent activity, productivity and stability. BACKGROUND Metallocene catalysts have been used to manufacture polyolefins for many years. Countless academic and patent publications describe the use of these catalysts in olefin polymerisation. Metallocenes are now used industrially and polyethylenes and polypropylenes in particular are often produced using cyclopentadienyl based catalyst systems with different substitution patterns. These metallocenes can be used in solution polymerisation but results of such polymerisations have generally been poor. These metallocenes are therefore conventionally supported on a carrier such as silica. Research has found that heterogeneous catalysis gives rise to better polymer products than homogeneous catalysis (in solution). The use therefore of a support is common place. Despite several years of development of this catalyst technology, there is still room for improved activity of course. In WO03/051934, the inventors proposed an alternative form of catalyst which is provided in solid form but does not require a conventional external carrier material such as silica. The invention is based on the finding that a homogeneous catalyst system containing an organometallic compound of a transition metal can be converted, in a controlled way, to solid, uniform catalyst particles by first forming a liquid/liquid emulsion system, which comprises as the dispersed phase, said solution of the homogeneous catalyst system, and as the continuous phase a solvent immiscible therewith, and then solidifying said dispersed droplets to form solid particles comprising the said catalyst. The invention described in WO03/051934 enabled the formation of solid spherical catalyst particles of said organotransition metal catalyst without using e.g. external porous carrier particles, such as silica, normally required in the art. Thus, problems relating to catalyst silica residues can be solved by this type of catalyst. Further, it could be seen that catalyst particles having improved morphology, will give, due to the replica effect, polymer particles having improved morphology as well. Although a lot of work has been done in the field of metallocene catalysts, both with conventional supported catalysts as well with solid catalysts prepared according to the principles as described in said WO03/051934, there still remain some problems, which relate especially to the productivity or activity of the catalysts. There remains a need therefore to improve the productivity or activity of the catalysts. Furthermore, there is a need to obtain polymers, especially propylene polymers, having particular properties, such as higher melt temperature (Tm). In addition there is a need to keep the activity or productivity at a desired high level and at the same time produce polymers having higher Tm. There remains a need therefore to find new catalysts for olefin polymerisation, which are able to produce polymers with desired properties and which have high activity and/or productivity. Further, it is highly desired in many polymer applications that inorganic residues, e.g. silica residues, in the final product are reduced as much as possible. As a consequence, the inventors set out to develop a catalyst having a superior polymerisation behaviour than the above mentioned polymerisation catalyst systems regarding one or more of the following characteristics: higher activity (for propylene and ethylene homo and copolymerisation, especially for propylene ethylene copolymerisation);superior kinetics (in terms of catalyst performance over time);high melt temperature. Furthermore low ash content is often desired. The present inventors have now found a new class of olefin polymerisation catalysts, which are able to solve the problems disclosed above, and which catalysts are not previously described in the art. In particular, the invention combines the use of boron based and aluminoxane cocatalysts in solid catalysts not containing any external support material, essentially prepared using the basic principles of WO03/05194. The invention provides a solid catalyst material, where no silica support material is used and which exhibits remarkable increase in activity. This avoids any problems relating to the use of the conventionally supported catalysts, such as silica supported catalysts without prejudicing activity and productivity. Whilst both boron based and aluminoxane cocatalysts are well known in the art, they are typically used as alternatives. However, it is also known to use boron activators together with aluminoxanes in some circumstances. EP-A-0574258 discloses use of boron compounds together with aluminoxanes in single site catalysts. The catalysts are homogeneous, however, and they are used in homogeneous polymerisation where activity increase could be observed. In J Macromol. Chem Phys, 199, 2409-2416 (1998), there is a disclosure of the use of constrained geometry metallocene type catalysts with both a methyl aluminoxane and trispentafluorophenyl boron activator. In the context of solution phase polyethylene polymerisation, the blend was found to increase catalyst activity. In the literature, there are also other similar observations, that homogeneous catalyst activity (solution phase polymerisation) was improved by using boron modification, but when heterogeneous catalysis was tried, i.e. when catalysts were supported on silica, activity was lower than that achieved using MAO activators alone. However, WO1998/040418 discloses that when specific types of boron-compounds, in particular alkyl or aryl boronic acids (RB(OR′)2) or cyclic boron compounds, boroxanes, are used with silica supported metallocene catalysts in combination with aluminoxanes, higher activity was seen for ethylene-butene polymerisation. US2011294972 discloses the use of catalysts of specific transition metal complexes comprising mono-anionic, bidentate triazole ligands in combination with MAO and borate type activators supported on silica in ethylene-butene polymerisation. In Macromol. Chem. Phys. 200, 2127-2135 (1999) page 2128, propylene polymerisation is discussed using a bridged biscyclopentadienyl type catalyst in the presence of both MAO and dimethylanilinium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate. When the metallocene is activated with MAO alone, there is a change in the polymer melting point (Tm). In this case, the presence of both MAO and the boron activator decreased the melting point which is the opposite of the desired goal in the present invention. It is surprising that the combination covered in the present invention allows an increase in melting point therefore. The present inventors have surprisingly found that the use of both boron based cocatalysts, especially borates, and aluminoxane cocatalysts in combination in a solid, but unsupported, metallocene catalyst, allows the formation of a catalyst which enables increases in catalyst activities and productivity in olefin polymerisation, such as ethylene and propylene polymerisation. This is particularly true for propylene homo- or copolymerisation with olefin monomers of 2 to 10 C-atoms, and especially for propylene ethylene copolymerisation. Furthermore, with the catalyst of the invention propylene, homo- or copolymers with higher melt temperature can be prepared. SUMMARY OF INVENTION Thus, viewed from one aspect the invention relates to a catalyst comprising (i) a metallocene complex of a group (IV) metal, said metallocene comprising at least two cyclopentadienyl type ligands; (ii) a boron cocatalyst; and (iii) an aluminoxane cocatalyst; said catalyst being in solid form, preferably in solid particulate form, and being free from an external carrier. Preferably the boron cocatalysts are borate-type cocatalysts. Ideally, the solid catalyst of the invention is obtainable by a process in which (a) a liquid/liquid emulsion system is formed, said liquid/liquid emulsion system comprising a solution of the catalyst components (i) to (iii) dispersed in a solvent so as to form dispersed droplets; and (b) solid particles are formed by solidifying said dispersed droplets. Preferably, the process for obtaining the solid catalyst of the invention further involves a prepolymerisation step (c) wherein the solid catalyst from step (b) is prepolymerised with at least one alpha-olefin monomer and optionally one or more C3-C10 alpha-olefin comonomers.

Viewed from another aspect the invention provides a process for the manufacture of a catalyst comprising obtaining (i) a metallocene complex of a group (IV) metal comprising at least two cyclopentadienyl type ligands; (ii) a boron containing cocatalyst; and (iii) an aluminoxane cocatalyst; forming a liquid/liquid emulsion system, which comprises a solution of catalyst components (i) to (iii) dispersed in a solvent so as to form dispersed droplets, and solidifying said dispersed droplets to form solid particles; and prepolymerising said solid particles with at least one alpha-olefin monomer and optionally one or more (different) C3-C10 alpha-olefin comonomers. The invention also provides a prepolymerised catalyst made by this process. Viewed from another aspect the invention provides the use in olefin polymerisation of a catalyst as hereinbefore defined, especially for the formation of a polyolefin, especially a polyethylene or polypropylene, especially copolymers thereof with olefin monomers of 2 to 10 C-atoms, preferably 2 to 6 C-atoms, especially 2, 4 or 6 C-atoms.

Preferably, such a process is a heterogeneous polymerisation process comprising at least one slurry and/or gas phase polymerisation stage. DEFINITIONS The catalysts of the invention are solid but do not contain an external carrier. By external carrier is meant a support such as silica or alumina on which a metallocene might be carried. The solid catalyst of the invention is designed for use in heterogeneous polymerisations. Catalysts in heterogeneous polymerisation stay essentially in solid form in the reaction medium under the polymerisation conditions. The term polypropylene refers to a polymer in which propylene forms the majority of the monomer units present. The term polyethylene refers to a polymer in which ethylene forms the majority of the monomer units present. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Metallocene Complex The invention can be effected with any metallocene complex of a group (IV) metal having at least two cyclopentadienyl type ligands. The cyclopentadienyl type group ligand has been widely described in the scientific and patent literature for about twenty years. Essentially any ligand containing the general structure: can be employed herein. The cyclopentadienyl type ligand can be an unsubstituted or substituted and/or fused cyclopentadienyl ligand, e.g. substituted or unsubstituted cyclopentadienyl, substituted or unsubstituted indenyl, substituted or unsubstituted tetrahydroindenyl or substituted or unsubstituted fluorenyl ligand. Suitable ligands therefore include: which can obviously be substituted. The use of indenyl ligands is preferred. The metallocene complex of the invention should not therefore comprise a single cyclopentadienyl type ligand. Preferably two such cyclopentadienyl type ligands are present, ideally joined by a bridging group. The substitution pattern on the two ligands may be the same or different. Metallocenes of use in this invention can therefore be symmetrical or asymmetrical. The two cyclopentadienyl ligands of the present invention can be bridged or unbridged as is well known in the art. It is generally envisaged that the principles of this invention can be applied to any bis cyclopentadienyl type ligand system. The metallocene complex will comprise at least one metal ion of group (IV) as is well known. This will be η-bonded to the cyclopentadienyl type rings.

Preferably, any heteroatom is an oxygen atom. The heteroatom may form the first atom in a chain, e.g. forming an alkoxy group. The oxidation state of the metal ion is governed primarily by the nature of the metal ion in question and the stability of the individual oxidation states of each metal ion. Typically, however the metal ions will be in the 3+ or 4+ oxidation state especially 4+. It will be appreciated that in the complexes of the invention, the metal ion M is coordinated by ligands X so as to satisfy the valency of the metal ion and to fill its available coordination sites. The nature of these σ-ligands can vary greatly. It is preferred if the two multicyclic ligands making up the complex of formula (II) are identical. It is also preferred if a substituent on one ring is the same as the corresponding substituent on the other. Thus, R2 is preferably the same as R2′ and so on. Preferably, the metallocene compounds of the present invention are in their racemic (rac) or racemic-anti-form. In compounds of formula (II): M is preferably Hf or zirconium, especially Zr. Each X, which may be the same or different, is preferably a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom, a R9, OR9, OSO2CF3, OCOR9, SR9, NR92 or PR92 group wherein R9 is a linear or branched, cyclic or acyclic, C1-C20-alkyl, C2-C20 alkenyl, C2-C20 alkynyl, C6-C20-aryl, C7-C20-alkylaryl or C7-C20-arylalkyl radical; optionally containing heteroatoms belonging to groups 14-16 or is SiR93, SiHR92 or SiH2R9.

Particularly preferred metallocenes include those of WO2002/002576, WO2011/135004, WO2012/084961, WO2012/001052 or WO2011/076780 or WO2006/060544, such as f rac-cyclohexyl(methyl)silanediylbis[2-methyl-4-(4′-tert-butylphenyl)indenyl]zirconium dichloride or bridged 2-methyl-4-phenylindenyl ligands. Synthesis The ligands required to form the catalysts of the invention can be synthesised by any process and the skilled organic chemist would be able to devise various synthetic protocols for the manufacture of the necessary ligand materials. WO2007/116034 discloses the necessary chemistry and is herein incorporated by reference. Synthetic protocols can also generally be found in WO200202576, WO2011/135004, WO2012/084961, WO2012/001052 and WO2011/076780. For example, the following general synthetic scheme can be used to synthesise some asymmetric complexes of the invention: Cocatalyst To form an active catalytic species it is normally necessary to employ a cocatalyst as is well known in the art. The present invention requires the use of both an aluminoxane cocatalyst and a boron containing cocatalyst. The aluminoxane cocatalyst can be one of formula: where n is usually from 6 to 20 and R has the meaning below. Aluminoxanes are formed on partial hydrolysis of organoaluminum compounds, for example those of the formula AlR3, AlR2Y and Al2R3Y3 where R can be, for example, C1-C10 alkyl, preferably C1-C5 alkyl, or C3-10-cycloalkyl, C7-C12-aralkyl or alkaryl and/or phenyl or naphthyl, and where Y can be hydrogen, halogen, preferably chlorine or bromine, or C1-C10 alkoxy, preferably methoxy or ethoxy. The resulting oxygen-containing aluminoxanes are not in general pure compounds but mixtures of oligomers of the formula (I). The preferred aluminoxane in the process according to the invention is methylaluminoxane (MAO). Since the aluminoxanes used according to the invention as cocatalysts are not, owing to their mode of preparation, pure compounds, the molarity of aluminoxane solutions hereinafter is based on their aluminium content. It has been surprisingly found however, that in the context of heterogeneous catalysis, where catalysts are not supported on any external carrier or supported as described above, that higher activities can be achieved if a boron based cocatalyst is also employed as a cocatalyst. It will be appreciated by the skilled man that where boron based cocatalysts are employed, it is normal to preactivate the complex by reaction thereof with an aluminium alkyl compound, such as TIBA. This procedure is well known and any suitable aluminium alkyl, e.g. Al(C1-6-alkyl)3 can be used. The present invention combines the use of boron cocatalysts with aluminoxanes rather than the combination of these simple aluminium alkyls and boron cocatalysts. Boron based cocatalysts of interest include boron compounds containing a borate 3+ ion, i.e. borate compounds. These compounds generally contain an anion of formula: [in-line-formulae](Z)4B− (V)[/in-line-formulae] where Z is an optionally substituted phenyl derivative, said substituent being a C1-6 alkyl group, haloC1-6-alkyl or halo group. Preferred options are methyl, fluoro or trifluoromethyl. Most preferably, the phenyl group is perfluorinated or unsubstituted. Such ionic cocatalysts preferably contain a non-coordinating anion such as tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate and tetraphenylborate. Suitable counterions are protonated amine or aniline derivatives or phosphonium ions. These may have the general formula (VI) or (VII): [in-line-formulae]NQ4+ (VI)[/in-line-formulae] [in-line-formulae]or[/in-line-formulae] [in-line-formulae]PQ4+ (VII)[/in-line-formulae] where Q is independently H, C1-6-alkyl, C3-8 cycloakyl, phenylC1-6-alkylene- or optionally substituted Ph. Optional substituents may be C1-6-alkyl, halo or nitro. There may be one or more than one such substituent. Preferred substituted Ph groups include therefore para-substituted phenyl, preferably p-Br-phenyl or p-nitrophenyl, tolyl or dimethylphenyl. It is preferred if at least one Q group is H, thus preferred compounds are those of formula: [in-line-formulae]NHQ3+ (VI′)[/in-line-formulae] [in-line-formulae]or[/in-line-formulae] [in-line-formulae]PHQ3+ (VII′)[/in-line-formulae] Preferred phenylC1-6-alkyl-groups include benzyl. Suitable counterions therefore include: methylammonium, anilinium, dimethylammonium, diethylammonium, N-methylanilinium, diphenylammonium, N,N-dimethylanilinium, trimethylammonium, triethylammonium, tri-n-butylammonium, methyldiphenylammonium, p-bromo-N,N-dimethylanilinium or p-nitro-N,N-dimethylanilinium, especially dimethylammonium or N,N-dimethylanilinium. The use of pyridinium as an ion is a further option. Phosphonium ions of interest include triphenylphosphonium, triethylphosphonium, diphenylphosphonium, tri(methylphenyl)phosphonium and tri(dimethylphenyl)phosphonium A more preferred counterion is trityl (CPh3+) or analogues thereof in which the Ph group is functionalised to carry one or more alkyl groups. Highly preferred borates of use in the invention therefore comprise the tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate ion. Preferred ionic compounds which can be used according to the present invention include: triethylammoniumtetra(phenyl)borate, tributylammoniumtetra(phenyl)borate, trimethylammoniumtetra(tolyl)borate, tributylammoniumtetra(tolyl)borate, tributylammoniumtetra(pentafluorophenyl)borate, tripropylammoniumtetra(dimethylphenyl)borate, tributylammoniumtetra(trifluoromethylphenyl)borate, tributylammoniumtetra(4-fluorophenyl)borate, N,N-dimethylcyclohexylammoniumtetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate, N,N-dimethylbenzylammoniumtetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate, N,N-dimethylaniliniumtetra(phenyl)borate, N,N-diethylaniliniumtetra(phenyl)borate, N,N-dimethylaniliniumtetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate, N,N-di(propyl)ammoniumtetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate, di(cyclohexyl)ammoniumtetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate, triphenylcarbeniumtetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate, triphenylphosphoniumtetrakis(phenyl)borate, triethylphosphoniumtetrakis(phenyl)borate, diphenylphosphoniumtetrakis(phenyl)borate, tri(methylphenyl)phosphoniumtetrakis(phenyl)borate, tri(dimethylphenyl)phosphoniumtetrakis(phenyl)borate, or ferroceniumtetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate. Preference is given to triphenylcarbeniumtetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate, N,N-dimethylcyclohexylammoniumtetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate or N,N-dimethylbenzylammoniumtetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate, (N,N-dimethylaniliniumtetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate). It has been surprisingly found that certain boron cocatalysts are especially preferred. Preferred borates of use in the invention therefore comprise the trityl ion. Thus the use of N,N-dimethylammonium-tetrakispentafluorophenylborate and Ph3CB(PhF5)4 and analogues therefore are especially favoured. Suitable amounts of cocatalyst will be well known to the skilled man. The ratio of boron to the metal ion of the metallocene in the feed may be in the range 1:10 to 10:1 mol/mol, preferably 1:5 to 5:1, especially 1:5 to 2:1 mol/mol. The ratio of Al in the aluminoxane to the metal ion of the metallocene may be in the range 1:1 to 1200:1 mol/mol, preferably 1:1 to 500:1, especially 1:1 to 250:1 mol/mol. Catalyst Manufacture The metallocene complex of the present invention is used in combination with the cocatalysts as a catalyst for the polymerization of olefins. The catalyst of the invention is in solid, preferably in unsupported form. Thus, no external carrier is used but the catalyst is still presented in solid particulate form. Thus, no external support material such as inert organic or inorganic carrier, such as for example silica is employed. In order to provide the catalyst of the invention in solid form but without using an external carrier, it is preferred if a liquid/liquid emulsion system is used. The process involves forming dispersing catalyst components (i) (the complex) and (ii)+(iii) the cocatalysts) in a solvent, and solidifying said dispersed droplets to form solid particles. In the present case, it is particularly preferred if the aluminoxane is contacted with the metallocene before the borate is added. Both cocatalyst components and the metallocene are preferably present in one solution. In particular, the method involves preparing a solution of the catalyst components; dispersing said solution in an solvent to form an emulsion in which said one or more catalyst components are present in the droplets of the dispersed phase; immobilising the catalyst components in the dispersed droplets, in the absence of an external particulate porous support, to form solid particles comprising the said catalyst, and optionally recovering said particles. This process enables the manufacture of active catalyst particles with improved morphology, e.g. with a predetermined particle size, spherical shape, compact structure, excellent surface properties and without using any added external porous support material, such as an inorganic oxide, e.g. silica. The catalyst particles can have a smooth surface, they may be compact in nature and catalyst active components can be distributed uniformly thorough the catalyst particles. The catalyst forming compounds may be combined in one solution which is dispersed to the immiscible solvent, or, alternatively, at least two separate catalyst solutions for each part of the catalyst forming compounds may be prepared, which are then dispersed successively to the solvent. In a preferred method for forming the catalyst at least two separate solutions for each or part of said catalyst may be prepared, which are then dispersed successively to the immiscible solvent. More preferably, a solution of the complex comprising the transition metal compound and the cocatalysts is combined with the solvent to form an emulsion wherein that inert solvent forms the continuous liquid phase and the solution comprising the catalyst components forms the dispersed phase (discontinuous phase) in the form of dispersed droplets. The droplets are then solidified to form solid catalyst particles, and the solid particles are separated from the liquid and optionally washed and/or dried. The solvent forming the continuous phase may be immiscible to the catalyst solution at least at the conditions (e. g. temperatures) used during the dispersing step. The term “immiscible with the catalyst solution” means that the solvent (continuous phase) is fully immiscible or partly immiscible i.e. not fully miscible with the dispersed phase solution. Preferably said solvent is inert in relation to the compounds of the catalyst system to be produced. Full disclosure of the necessary process can be found in WO03/051934 which is herein incorporated by reference. The inert solvent must be chemically inert at least at the conditions (e.g. temperature) used during the dispersing step. Preferably, the solvent of said continuous phase does not contain dissolved therein any significant amounts of catalyst forming compounds. Thus, the solid particles of the catalyst are formed in the droplets from the compounds which originate from the dispersed phase (i.e. are provided to the emulsion in a solution dispersed into the continuous phase). The terms “immobilisation” and “solidification” are used herein interchangeably for the same purpose, i.e. for forming free flowing solid catalyst particles in the absence of an external porous particulate carrier, such as silica. The solidification happens thus within the droplets. Said step can be effected in various ways as disclosed in said WO03/051934 Preferably solidification is caused by an external stimulus to the emulsion system such as a temperature change to cause the solidification. Thus in said step the catalyst component (s) remain “fixed” within the formed solid particles. It is also possible that one or more of the catalyst components may take part in the solidification/immobilisation reaction. Accordingly, solid, compositionally uniform particles having a predetermined particle size range can be obtained. Furthermore, the particle size of the catalyst particles of the invention can be controlled by the size of the droplets in the solution, and spherical particles with a uniform particle size distribution can be obtained. The invention is also industrially advantageous, since it enables the preparation of the solid particles to be carried out as a one-pot procedure. Continuous or semicontinuous processes are also possible for producing the catalyst. Dispersed Phase The principles for preparing two phase emulsion systems are known in the chemical field. Thus, in order to form the two phase liquid system, the solution of the catalyst component (s) and the solvent used as the continuous liquid phase have to be essentially immiscible at least during the dispersing step. This can be achieved in a known manner e.g. by choosing said two liquids and/or the temperature of the dispersing step/solidifying step accordingly. A solvent may be employed to form the solution of the catalyst component (s). Said solvent is chosen so that it dissolves said catalyst component (s). The solvent can be preferably an organic solvent such as used in the field, comprising an optionally substituted hydrocarbon such as linear or branched aliphatic, alicyclic or aromatic hydrocarbon, such as a linear or cyclic alkane, an aromatic hydrocarbon and/or a halogen containing hydrocarbon. Examples of aromatic hydrocarbons are toluene, benzene, ethylbenzene, propylbenzene, butylbenzene and xylene. Toluene is a preferred solvent. The solution may comprise one or more solvents. Such a solvent can thus be used to facilitate the emulsion formation, and usually does not form part of the solidified particles, but e.g. is removed after the solidification step together with the continuous phase. Alternatively, a solvent may take part in the solidification, e.g. an inert hydrocarbon having a high melting point (waxes), such as above 40° C., suitably above 70° C., e. g. above 80° C. or 90° C., may be used as solvents of the dispersed phase to immobilise the catalyst compounds within the formed droplets. In another embodiment, the solvent consists partly or completely of a liquid monomer, e.g. liquid olefin monomer designed to be polymerised in a “prepolymerisation” immobilisation step. Continuous Phase The solvent used to form the continuous liquid phase is a single solvent or a mixture of different solvents and may be immiscible with the solution of the catalyst components at least at the conditions (e.g. temperatures) used during the dispersing step. Preferably said solvent is inert in relation to said compounds. The term “inert in relation to said compounds” means herein that the solvent of the continuous phase is chemically inert, i.e. undergoes no chemical reaction with any catalyst forming component. Thus, the solid particles of the catalyst are formed in the droplets from the compounds which originate from the dispersed phase, i.e. are provided to the emulsion in a solution dispersed into the continuous phase. It is preferred that the catalyst components used for forming the solid catalyst will not be soluble in the solvent of the continuous liquid phase. Preferably, said catalyst components are essentially insoluble in said continuous phase forming solvent. Solidification takes place essentially after the droplets are formed, i.e. the solidification is effected within the droplets e.g. by causing a solidifying reaction among the compounds present in the droplets. Furthermore, even if some solidifying agent is added to the system separately, it reacts within the droplet phase and no catalyst forming components go into the continuous phase. The term “emulsion” used herein covers both bi- and multiphasic systems. In a preferred embodiment said solvent forming the continuous phase is an inert solvent including a halogenated organic solvent or mixtures thereof, preferably fluorinated organic solvents and particularly semi, highly or perfluorinated organic solvents and functionalised derivatives thereof. Examples of the above-mentioned solvents are semi, highly or perfluorinated hydrocarbons, such as alkanes, alkenes and cycloalkanes, ethers, e.g. perfluorinated ethers and amines, particularly tertiary amines, and functionalised derivatives thereof. Preferred are semi, highly or perfluorinated, particularly perfluorinated hydrocarbons, e.g. perfluorohydrocarbons of e.g. C3-C30, such as C4-C10. Specific examples of suitable perfluoroalkanes and perfluorocycloalkanes include perfluoro-hexane, -heptane, -octane and -(methylcyclohexane). Semi fluorinated hydrocarbons relates particularly to semifluorinated n-alkanes, such as perfluoroalkyl-alkane. “Semi fluorinated” hydrocarbons also include such hydrocarbons wherein blocks of —C—F and —C—H alternate. “Highly fluorinated” means that the majority of the —C—H units are replaced with —C—F units. “Perfluorinated” means that all —C—H units are replaced with —C—F units. See the articles of A. Enders and G. Maas in “Chemie in unserer Zeit”, 34. Jahrg. 2000, Nr. 6, and of Pierandrea Lo Nostro in “Advances in Colloid and Interface Science”, 56 (1995) 245-287, Elsevier Science. Dispersing Step The emulsion can be formed by any means known in the art: by mixing, such as by stirring said solution vigorously to said solvent forming the continuous phase or by means of mixing mills, or by means of ultra sonic wave, or by using a so called phase change method for preparing the emulsion by first forming a homogeneous system which is then transferred by changing the temperature of the system to a biphasic system so that droplets will be formed. The two phase state is maintained during the emulsion formation step and the solidification step, as, for example, by appropriate stirring. Additionally, emulsifying agents/emulsion stabilisers can be used, preferably in a manner known in the art, for facilitating the formation and/or stability of the emulsion. For the said purposes e.g. surfactants, e.g. a class based on hydrocarbons (including polymeric hydrocarbons with a molecular weight e.g. up to 10 000 and optionally interrupted with a heteroatom(s)), preferably halogenated hydrocarbons, such as semi- or highly fluorinated hydrocarbons optionally having a functional group selected e.g. from —OH, —SH, NH2, NR″2. —COOH, —COONH2, oxides of alkenes, —CR″═CH2, where R″ is hydrogen, or C1-C20 alkyl, C2-20-alkenyl or C2-20-alkynyl group, oxo-groups, cyclic ethers and/or any reactive derivative of these groups, like alkoxy, or carboxylic acid alkyl ester groups, or, preferably semi-, highly- or perfluorinated hydrocarbons having a functionalised terminal, can be used. The surfactants can be added to the catalyst solution, which forms the dispersed phase of the emulsion, to facilitate the forming of the emulsion and to stabilize the emulsion. Alternatively, an emulsifying and/or emulsion stabilising aid can also be formed by reacting a surfactant precursor bearing at least one functional group with a compound reactive with said functional group and present in the catalyst solution or in the solvent forming the continuous phase. The obtained reaction product acts as the actual emulsifying aid and or stabiliser in the formed emulsion system. Examples of the surfactant precursors usable for forming said reaction product include e.g. known surfactants which bear at least one functional group selected e.g. from —OH, —SH, NH2, NR″2. —COOH, —COONH2, oxides of alkenes, —CR″═CH2, where R″ is hydrogen, or C1-C20 alkyl, C2-20-alkenyl or C2-20-alkynyl group, oxo-groups, cyclic ethers with 3 to 5 ring atoms, and/or any reactive derivative of these groups, like alkoxy or carboxylic acid alkyl ester groups; e.g. semi-, highly or perfluorinated hydrocarbons bearing one or more of said functional groups. Preferably, the surfactant precursor has a terminal functionality as defined above. The compound reacting with such surfactant precursor is preferably contained in the catalyst solution and may be a further additive or one or more of the catalyst forming compounds. Such compound is e.g. a compound of group 13 (e.g. MAO and/or an aluminium alkyl compound and/or a transition metal compound). If a surfactant precursor is used, it is preferably first reacted with a compound of the catalyst solution before the addition of the transition metal compound. In one embodiment e.g. a highly fluorinated C1-n (suitably C4-30- or C5-15) alcohol (e.g. highly fluorinated heptanol, octanol or nonanol), oxide (e.g. propenoxide) or acrylate ester is reacted with a cocatalyst to form the “actual” surfactant. Then, an additional amount of cocatalyst and the transition metal compound is added to said solution and the obtained solution is dispersed to the solvent forming the continuous phase. The “actual” surfactant solution may be prepared before the dispersing step or in the dispersed system. If said solution is made before the dispersing step, then the prepared “actual” surfactant solution and the transition metal solution may be dispersed successively (e. g. the surfactant solution first) to the immiscible solvent, or be combined together before the dispersing step. Solidification The solidification of the catalyst component(s) in the dispersed droplets can be effected in various ways, e.g. by causing or accelerating the formation of said solid catalyst forming reaction products of the compounds present in the droplets. This can be effected, depending on the used compounds and/or the desired solidification rate, with or without an external stimulus, such as a temperature change of the system. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the solidification is effected after the emulsion system is formed by subjecting the system to an external stimulus, such as a temperature change. Temperature differences of e.g. 5 to 100° C., such as 10 to 100° C., or 20 to 90° C., such as 50 to 90° C. The emulsion system may be subjected to a rapid temperature change to cause a fast solidification in the dispersed system. The dispersed phase may e. g. be subjected to an immediate (within milliseconds to few seconds) temperature change in order to achieve an instant solidification of the component (s) within the droplets. The appropriate temperature change, i. e. an increase or a decrease in the temperature of an emulsion system, required for the desired solidification rate of the components cannot be limited to any specific range, but naturally depends on the emulsion system, i.a. on the used compounds and the concentrations/ratios thereof, as well as on the used solvents, and is chosen accordingly. It is also evident that any techniques may be used to provide sufficient heating or cooling effect to the dispersed system to cause the desired solidification. In one embodiment the heating or cooling effect is obtained by bringing the emulsion system with a certain temperature to an inert receiving medium with significantly different temperature, e. g. as stated above, whereby said temperature change of the emulsion system is sufficient to cause the rapid solidification of the droplets. The receiving medium can be gaseous, e. g. air, or a liquid, preferably a solvent, or a mixture of two or more solvents, wherein the catalyst component (s) is (are) immiscible and which is inert in relation to the catalyst component (s). For instance, the receiving medium comprises the same immiscible solvent used as the continuous phase in the first emulsion formation step. Said solvents can be used alone or as a mixture with other solvents, such as aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbons, such as alkanes. Preferably a fluorinated solvent as the receiving medium is used, which may be the same as the continuous phase in the emulsion formation, e. g. perfluorinated hydrocarbon. Alternatively, the temperature difference may be effected by gradual heating of the emulsion system, e. g. up to 10° C. per minute, preferably 0.5 to 6° C. per minute and more preferably in 1 to 5° C. per minute. In case a melt of e. g. a hydrocarbon solvent is used for forming the dispersed phase, the solidification of the droplets may be effected by cooling the system using the temperature difference stated above. Preferably, the “one phase” change as usable for forming an emulsion can also be utilised for solidifying the catalytically active contents within the droplets of an emulsion system by, again, effecting a temperature change in the dispersed system, whereby the solvent used in the droplets becomes miscible with the continuous phase, preferably a fluorous continuous phase as defined above, so that the droplets become impoverished of the solvent and the solidifying components remaining in the “droplets” start to solidify. Thus the immiscibility can be adjusted with respect to the solvents and conditions (temperature) to control the solidification step. The miscibility of e.g. organic solvents with fluorous solvents can be found from the literature and be chosen accordingly by a skilled person. Also the critical temperatures needed for the phase change are available from the literature or can be determined using methods known in the art, e. g. the Hildebrand-Scatchard-Theorie. Reference is also made to the articles of A. Enders and G. and of Pierandrea Lo Nostro cited above. Thus according to the invention, the entire or only part of the droplet may be converted to a solid form. The size of the “solidified” droplet may be smaller or greater than that of the original droplet, e. g. if the amount of the monomer used for the prepolymerisation is relatively large. The solid catalyst particles recovered can be used, after an optional washing step, in a polymerisation process of an olefin. Alternatively, the separated and optionally washed solid particles can be dried to remove any solvent present in the particles before use in the polymerisation step. The separation and optional washing steps can be effected in a known manner, e. g. by filtration and subsequent washing of the solids with a suitable solvent. The droplet shape of the particles may be substantially maintained. The formed particles may have an average size range of 1 to 500 μm, e.g. 5 to 500 μm, advantageously 5 to 200 μm or 10 to 150 μm. Even an average size range of 5 to 60 μm is possible. The size may be chosen depending on the polymerisation the catalyst is used for. Advantageously, the particles are essentially spherical in shape, they have a low porosity and a low surface area. The formation of solution can be effected at a temperature of 0-100° C., e.g. at 20-80° C. The dispersion step may be effected at −20° C.-100° C., e.g. at about −10-70° C., such as at −5 to 30° C., e.g. around 0° C. To the obtained dispersion an emulsifying agent as defined above, may be added to improve/stabilise the droplet formation. The solidification of the catalyst component in the droplets is preferably effected by raising the temperature of the mixture, e.g. from 0° C. temperature up to 100° C., e.g. up to 60-90° C., gradually. E.g. in 1 to 180 minutes, e.g. 1-90 or 5-30 minutes, or as a rapid heat change. Heating time is dependent on the size of the reactor. During the solidification step, which is preferably carried out at about 60 to 100° C., preferably at about 75 to 95° C., (below the boiling point of the solvents) the solvents may preferably be removed and optionally the solids are washed with a wash solution, which can be any solvent or mixture of solvents such as those defined above and/or used in the art, preferably a hydrocarbon, such as pentane, hexane or heptane, suitably heptane. The washed catalyst can be dried or it can be slurried into an oil and used as a catalyst-oil slurry in polymerisation process. All or part of the preparation steps can be done in a continuous manner Reference is made to WO2006/069733 describing principles of such a continuous or semicontinuous preparation methods of the solid catalyst types, prepared via emulsion/solidification method. The formed catalyst preferably has good stability/kinetics in terms of longevity of reaction, high activity and the catalysts enable low ash contents. Activities of 50 kg polymer per g catalysts/h can be achieved, preferably at least 60 kg polymer per g/h. Catalyst kinetics are also good. Catalysts should have at least a 30 minute period without any drop off in performance, preferably at least 1 h. Catalyst Preparation/Prepolymerisation The use of the heterogeneous, non-supported catalysts, (i.e. “self-supported” catalysts) might have, as a drawback, a tendency to dissolve to some extent in the polymerisation media, i.e. some active catalyst components might leach out of the catalyst particles during slurry polymerisation, whereby the original good morphology of the catalyst might be lost. These leached catalyst components are very active possibly causing problems during polymerisation. Therefore, the amount of leached components should be minimized, i.e. all catalyst components should be kept in heterogeneous form. Furthermore, the self-supported catalysts generate, due to the high amount of catalytically active species in the catalyst system, high temperatures at the beginning of the polymerisation which may cause melting of the product material. Both effects, i.e. the partial dissolving of the catalyst system and the heat generation, might cause fouling, sheeting and deterioration of the polymer material morphology. In order to minimise the possible problems associated with high activity or leaching, it is preferred to “prepolymerise” the catalyst before using it in polymerisation process. It has to be noted that prepolymerisation in this regard is part of the catalyst preparation process, being a step carried out after a solid catalyst is formed. This catalyst prepolymerisation step is not part of the actual polymerisation configuration, which might comprise a conventional process prepolymerisation step as well. After the catalyst prepolymerisation step, a solid catalyst is obtained and used in polymerisation. Catalyst “prepolymerisation” takes place following the solidification step of the liquid-liquid emulsion process hereinbefore described. Prepolymerisation may take place by known methods described in the art, such as that described in WO 2010/052263, WO 2010/052260 or WO 2010/052264. Preferable embodiments of this aspect of the invention are described herein. As monomers in the catalyst prepolymerisation step preferably alpha-olefins are used. Preferable C2-C10 olefins, such as ethylene, propylene, 1-butene, 1-pentene, 1-hexene, 4-methyl-1-pentene, 1-heptene, 1-octene, 1-nonene 1-decene, styrene and vinylcyclohexene are used. Most preferred alpha-olefins are ethylene and propylene. The catalyst prepolymerisation may be carried out in gas phase or in an inert diluent, typically oil or fluorinated hydrocarbon, preferably in fluorinated hydrocarbons or mixture of fluorinated hydrocarbons. Preferably perfluorinated hydrocarbons are used. The melting point of such (per)fluorinated hydrocarbons is typically in the range of 0 to 140° C., preferably 30 to 120° C., like 50 to 110° C.. Where the catalyst prepolymerisation is done in fluorinated hydrocarbons, the temperature for the prepolymerisation step is below 70° C., e.g. in the range of −30 to 70° C., preferably 0-65° C. and more preferably in the range 20 to 55° C. Pressure within the prepolymerisation vessel is preferably higher than atmospheric pressure to minimize the eventual leaching of air and/or moisture into the catalyst vessel. Preferably the pressure is in the range of at least 1 to 15 bar, preferably 2 to 10 bar. The prepolymerisation vessel is preferably kept in an inert atmosphere, such as under nitrogen or argon or similar atmosphere. Prepolymeristaion is continued until the prepolymerisation degree defined as weight of polymer matrix/weight of solid catalyst before prepolymerisation step is reached. The degree is below 25, preferably 0.5 to 10.0, more preferably 1.0 to 8.0, most preferably 2.0 to 6.0. Use of the catalyst prepolymerisation step offers the advantage of minimising leaching of catalyst components and thus local overheating. After prepolymerisation, the catalyst can be isolated and stored. Polymerisation The olefin polymerized using the catalyst or prepolymerised catalyst of the invention is preferably propylene or a higher alpha-olefin. It may also be ethylene or a mixture of ethylene and an α-olefin. Alternatively, it may also be mixture of alpha olefins, for example C2-20 olefins, e.g. ethylene, propylene, 1-butene, 1-hexene, 4-methyl-1-pentene, 1-octene etc. The olefins polymerized in the method of the invention may include any compound which includes unsaturated polymerizable groups. Thus for example unsaturated compounds, such as C6-20 olefins (including cyclic and polycyclic olefins (e.g. norbornene)), and polyenes, especially C4-20 dienes, may be included in a comonomer mixture with lower olefins, e.g. C2-5 α-olefins. Diolefins (i.e. dienes) are suitably used for introducing long chain branching into the resultant polymer. Examples of such dienes include α,ω linear dienes such as 1,5-hexadiene, 1,6-heptadiene, 1,8-nonadiene, 1,9-decadiene, etc. The catalysts of the present invention are particularly suited for use in the manufacture of polyethylene and especially polypropylene polymers, either copolymers or homopolymers thereof. As comonomers to propylene are preferably used ethylene, or higher olefins, e.g. C4-C12 olefins, like 1-butene, 1-hexene, 1-octene or any mixtures thereof, preferably ethylene. It is especially preferred if the copolymer is a propylene ethylene random copolymer. The ethylene content in such a polymer may be up to to 20 wt %, like 0.5 to 10 wt-% Most especially, the catalyst are used to manufacture polypropylene, especially isotactic polypropylene. Polymerization in the method of the invention may be effected in one or more, e.g. 1, 2, 3 or even 4, polymerization reactors, using conventional polymerization techniques, e.g. gas phase, slurry or bulk polymerization. Polymerisations are preferably heterogeneous as the catalyst does not dissolve in the reaction medium. In general, a combination of slurry (or bulk) and at least one gas phase reactor is often preferred, particularly with the reactor order being slurry (or bulk) then one or more gas phase reactors. In case of propylene polymerisation for slurry reactors, the reaction temperature will generally be in the range 60 to 110° C. (e.g. 60-90° C.), the reactor pressure will generally be in the range 5 to 80 bar (e.g. 20-60 bar), and the residence time will generally be in the range 0.1 to 5 hours (e.g. 0.3 to 2 hours). In propylene polymerisation the monomer is usually used as reaction medium For gas phase reactors, the reaction temperature used will generally be in the range 60 to 115° C. (e.g. 70 to 110° C.), the reactor pressure will generally be in the range 10 to 25 bar, and the residence time will generally be 0.5 to 8 hours (e.g. 0.5 to 4 hours). The gas used will be the monomer optionally as mixture with a non-reactive gas such as nitrogen or propane. Ethylene polymerisation usually takes place in an inert diluent, typically a hydrocarbon diluent such as methane, ethane, propane, n-butane, isobutane, pentanes, hexanes, heptanes, octanes etc., or their mixtures. Preferably the diluent is a low-boiling hydrocarbon having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms or a mixture of such hydrocarbons. An especially preferred diluent is propane, possibly containing minor amount of methane, ethane and/or butane. The temperature in the slurry polymerization is typically from 50 to 115° C., preferably from 60 to 110° C. and in particular from 70 to 100° C. The pressure is from 1 to 150 bar, preferably from 10 to 100 bar. It is sometimes advantageous to conduct the slurry polymerization above the critical temperature and pressure of the fluid mixture. Such operation is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,391,654. In such operation the temperature is typically from 85 to 110° C., preferably from 90 to 105° C. and the pressure is from 40 to 150 bar, preferably from 50 to 100 bar. Typically the fluidized bed polymerization reactor (gas phase reactor) for ethylene polymerisation is operated at a temperature within the range of from 50 to 100° C., preferably from 65 to 90° C. The pressure is suitably from 10 to 40 bar, preferably from 15 to 30 bar. In addition to actual polymerisation steps and reactors, the process can contain any additional polymerisation steps, like a process prepolymerisation step, and any further after reactor handling steps as known in the art. Generally the quantity of catalyst used will depend upon the nature of the catalyst, the reactor types and conditions and the properties desired for the polymer product. As is well known in the art hydrogen can be used for controlling the molecular weight of the polymer. It is a feature of the invention that the claimed catalysts enable the formation of polymers with remarkably high catalyst activities. We observe increases of 20% or more in activity relative to experiments carried out in the presence of MAO alone. These features can be achieved at commercially interesting polymerisation temperatures, e.g. 60° C. or more. It is a preferred feature of the invention that the catalysts of the invention are used to polymerise propylene at a temperature of at least 60° C., preferably at least 65° C., such as at least 70° C. Polypropylenes made by the metallocenes of the invention can be made with MFR2 values in the whole range of interest, that is from very high (as high as 2000, for example 1000 or 500 g/10 min) to very low, that is fractional values (<1). Hydrogen can be used to manipulate MFR as is well known. Values of MFR2 of 1 to 30 such as 5 to 20 g/10 min are typical values for many applications. These values may be reduced by around 4 to 10 g/10 min relative to otherwise identical polymers produced in the absence of the boron cocatalyst. However, as is well known, different applications may need polymer with very low MFR2 values or very high MFR2 values, which are outside the typical values above. Applications The polymers made by the catalysts of the invention are useful in all kinds of end articles such as pipes, films (cast, blown or BOPP films, such as for example BOPP for capacitor film), fibers, moulded articles (e.g. injection moulded, blow moulded, rotomoulded articles), extrusion coatings and so on. The invention will now be illustrated by reference to the following non-limiting examples and figures. FIG. 1 is an SEM picture of the catalyst of example 1. EXAMPLES Chemicals All the chemicals and chemical reactions were handled under an inert gas atmosphere using Schlenk and glovebox techniques, with oven-dried glassware, syringes, needles or cannulas. MAO was purchased from Albermarle and used as a 30 wt-% solution in toluene. The mixture of perfluoroalkylethyl acrylate esters (CAS 65605-70-1) used as surfactant was purchased from the Cytonix corporation, dried over activated molecular sieves (2 times) and degassed by argon bubbling prior to use. Perfluoro-1,3-dimethylcyclohexane (PFC, CAS 335-27-3) was dried over activated molecular sieves (2 times) and degassed by argon bubbling prior to use. Triethylaluminum was purchased from Crompton and used in pure form. Hydrogen is provided by AGA and purified before use. Propylene is provided by Borealis and adequately purified before use. Triphenylcarbeniumtetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate (alternative name trityl tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate) (CAS 136040-19-2) was purchased from Acros N,N-dimethylanilinium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate has CAS no 118612-00-3 Measurement Methods ICP Analysis (for Al, B, P) The elemental analysis of a catalyst was performed by taking a solid sample of mass, m. The catalyst was deactivated by substituting the inert storing conditions with ambient air, first passively through a needle and the actively by applying vacuum three times to the sampling container. Samples were dissolved to a volume V by first cooling on dry ice while adding freshly deionised water (5% of V) and nitric acid (HNO3, 65%, 5% of V). The samples were transferred in full to volumetric flasks using deionised water and rinsing the sampling containers. Hydrofluoric acid (HF, 40%, 3% of V) was added to the volumetric flasks and volume V obtained by addition of freshly deionised water. The prepared sample solutions were left to stabilise for two hours. The analysis was run at room temperature using a Thermo Elemental iCAP 6300 Inductively Coupled Plasma—Optical Emission Spectrometer (ICP-OES) which was calibrated using a blank (a solution of 5% HNO3, 5% HF in deionised water), and 6 standards of 0.5 ppm, 1 ppm, 10 ppm, 50 ppm, 100 ppm and 300 ppm of Al, with 0.5 ppm, 1 ppm, 5 ppm, 20 ppm, 50 ppm and 100 ppm of B and P in solutions of 5% HNO3, 3% HF in deionised water. Immediately before analysis the calibration is ‘resloped’ using the blank and 100 ppm Al, 50 ppm B, P standard, a quality control sample (20 ppm Al, 5 ppm B, P in a solution of 5% HNO3, 3% HF in DI water) is run to confirm the reslope. The QC sample is also run after every 5th sample and at the end of a scheduled analysis set. The content of boron was monitored using the 249.773 nm line and the content of phosphorus using 177.495 nm and 178.284 nm lines. The content of aluminium was monitored via the 167.079 nm line, when Al concentration in ICP sample was between 0-10 ppm (calibrated only to 100 ppm) and via the 396.152 nm line for Al concentrations above 10 ppm. The content of hafnium was monitored using the 282.022 nm and 339.980 nm lines and the content for zirconium using 339.198 nm line. The reported values are an average of three successive aliquots taken from the same sample and are related back to the original catalyst by inputting the original mass of sample, m, and the dilution volume, V, into the software. DSC Analysis The melting point (Tm) and crystallization temperature (Tc) were determined on a DSC200 TA instrument, by placing a 5-7 mg polymer sample, into a closed DSC aluminum pan, heating the sample from −10° C. to 210° C. at 10° C./min, holding for 5 min at 210° C., cooling from 210° C. to −10° C., holding for 5 min at −10° C., heating from −10° C. to 210° C. at 10° C./min. The reported Tm is the maximum of the curve from the second heating scan and Tc is the maximum of the curve of the cooling scan. Melt Flow Rate The melt flow rate (MFR) is determined according to ISO 1133 and is indicated in g/10 min. The MFR is an indication of the flowability, and hence the processability, of the polymer. The higher the melt flow rate, the lower the viscosity of the polymer. The MFR is determined at 230° C. and may be determined at different loadings such as 2.16 kg (MFR2) or 21.6 kg (MFR21). GPC: Molecular weight averages, molecular weight distribution, and polydispersity index (Mn, Mw, Mw/Mn) Molecular weight averages (Mw, Mn), Molecular weight distribution (MWD) and its broadness, described by polydispersity index, PDI=Mw/Mn (wherein Mn is the number average molecular weight and Mw is the weight average molecular weight) were determined by Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC) according to ISO 16014-4:2003 and ASTM D 6474-99. A Waters GPCV2000 instrument, equipped with differential refractive index detector and online viscosimeter was used with 2×GMHXL-HT and 1×G7000HXL-HT TSK-gel columns from Tosoh Bioscience and 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene (TCB, stabilized with 250 mg/L 2,6-Di tert butyl-4-methyl-phenol) as solvent at 140° C. and at a constant flow rate of 1 mL/min. 209.5 μL of sample solution were injected per analysis. The column set was calibrated using universal calibration (according to ISO 16014-2:2003) with at least 15 narrow MWD polystyrene (PS) standards in the range of 1 kg/mol to 12 000 kg/mol. Mark Houwink constants for PS, PE and PP used are as per ASTM D 6474-99. All samples were prepared by dissolving 0.5-4.0 mg of polymer in 4 mL (at 140° C.) of stabilized TCB (same as mobile phase) and keeping for max. 3 hours at max. 160° C. with continuous gentle shaking prior sampling into the GPC instrument. Ethylene Content (FTIR C2) Ethylene content was measured with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) calibrated to results obtained by 13C NMR spectroscopy using a method which accounts for regio-irregular propene insertion. When measuring the ethylene content in polypropylene, a thin film of the sample (thickness about 0.220 to 0.250 mm) was prepared by hotpressing at 230° C. (preheat 5 min., press 1 min., cooling (cold water) 5 min.) using a Graseby Specac press. The FTIR spectra of the sample was recorded immediately with Nicolet Protégé 460 spectrometer from 4000 to 400 cm−1, resolution 4 cm−1, scans 64. The area of absorption peak at 733 cm−1 (baseline from 700 cm−1 to 760 cm−1) and height of reference peak at 809 cm−1 (baseline from 780 cm−1 to 880 cm−1) were evaluated. The result was calculated using the following formula [in-line-formulae]Etot=a×A/R+b [/in-line-formulae] where A=area of absorption peak at 733 cm−1 R=height of reference peak at 809 cm−1 Etot=C2 content (wt.-%)a, b are calibration constants determined by correlation of multiple calibration standards of know ethylene content as determined by 13C NMR spectroscopy to A/R. The result was reported as an average of two measurements. Comonomer Content from PE (FTIR) Comonomer content was determined in a known manner based on Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) determination using Nicolet Magna 550 IR spectrometer together with Nicolet Omnic FTIR software. Films having a thickness of about 220 to 250 μm were compression moulded from the samples. Similar films were made from calibration samples having a known content of the comonomer. The thicknesses were measured from at least five points of the film. The films were then rubbed with sandpaper to eliminate reflections. The films were not touched by plain hand to avoid contamination. For each sample and calibration sample at least two films were prepared. The films were pressed from pellets by using a Graceby Specac film press at 150° C. using 3+2 minutes preheating time, 1 minute compression time and 4 to 5 minutes cooling time. For very high molecular weight samples the preheating time may be prolonged or the temperature increased. The comonomer content was determined from the absorbance at the wave number of approximately 1378 cm−1. The comonomer used in the calibration samples was the same as the comonomer present in the samples. The analysis was performed by using the resolution of 2 cm−1, wave number span of from 4000 to 400 cm−1 and the number of sweeps of 128. At least two spectra were run from each film. The comonomer content was determined from the spectrum from the wave number range of from 1430 to 1100 cm−1. The absorbance is measured as the height of the peak by selecting the so-called short or long base line or both. The short base line is drawn in about 1410-1320 cm−1 through the minimum points and the long base line about between 1410 and 1220 cm−1. Calibrations need to be done specifically for each base line type. Also, the comonomer content of the unknown sample needs to be within the range of the comonomer contents of the calibration samples. From the calibration samples a straight line is obtained as follows: C i = k · A 1378 , i s i + b where Ci is the comonomer content of the calibration sample i A1378,i is the absorbance at appr. 1378 cm−1 of sample i si is the thickness of the film made of calibration sample i k is the slope of the calibration line (obtained by regression analysis), and b is the intercept of the calibration line (obtained by regression analysis). By using the thus obtained parameters k and b the comonomer content of the samples were obtained from C x = k · A 1378 , x s x + b where Cx is the comonomer content of the unknown sample A1378,x is the absorbance at appr. 1378 cm−1 of the unknown sample sx is the thickness of the film made of the unknown sample k is the slope of the calibration line obtained from the calibration samples as above b is the intercept of the calibration line obtained from the calibration samples. The method gives the comonomer content in weight-% or in mol-%, depending on which was used in the calibration. If properly calibrated, the same approach may also be used to determine the number of methyl groups, i.e., CH3 per 1000 carbon atoms.

Comparative Example 3 (C3) No Borate Modification Catalyst was prepared according to the procedure of Comparative example 2, but with complex as in example Example 3 (MC-Complex 3). Examples 4-6 (E4-E6) The catalysts as prepared in examples 1 to 3 (E1 to E3) were off-line prepolymerised according to the following procedure: off-line pre-polymerisation experiments were done in a 125 mL pressure reactor equipped with gas-feeding lines and an overhead stirrer. Dry and degassed perfluoro-1,3-dimethylcyclohexane (15 cm3) and the desired amount of the red catalyst to be pre-polymerised were loaded into the reactor inside a glovebox and the reactor was sealed. The reactor was then taken out from the glovebox and placed inside a water cooled bath. The overhead stirrer and the feeding lines were then connected. The feeding line was pressurized with hydrogen, and the experiment was started by opening the valve between the hydrogen feed line and the reactor. At the same time propylene feed was started through the same hydrogen feeding line in order to ensure that all the hydrogen would be fed into the reactor. The propylene feed was left open, and the monomer consumption was compensated by keeping the total pressure in the reactor constant (about 5 barg). The experiment was continued until a polymerisation time sufficient to provide the desired degree of polymerisation. The reactor was then taken back inside the glovebox before opening and the content was poured into a glass vessel. The perfluoro-1,3-dimethylcyclohexane was evaporated until a constant weight was obtained to yield a pre-polymerised pink catalyst. The prepolymerisation degree was determined gravimetrically and/or by analysis of the ash and/or aluminium content of the catalyst. The pre-polymerised catalysts were marked with codes E4 to E6.

The desired amount of hydrogen was then loaded (measured in mmol) and 1100 g of liquid propylene (purified via columns filled with copper-catalyst, molecular sieves and Selexsorb COS) was fed into the reactor. Desired amount of ethylene was fed in to the reactor. The temperature was set to 30° C. The desired amount of catalyst (3 to 30 mg) in 5 mL of PFC is flushed into the reactor with a nitrogen overpressure. The temperature is then raised to 70° C. over a period of 15 minutes. The polymerisation is stopped after 30 minutes by venting the reactor and flushing with nitrogen before the polymer is collected.

The mixture was allowed to react overnight. The following day, the mixture was degassed by argon bubbling (at least 30 minutes). A mixture of the MC-complex 4 (61.49 mg) and MAO (4 ml) was prepared in a septum bottle inside a glove box and stirred for 60 minutes. The borate compound, N,N-dimethylanilinium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate, 110.0 mg was added and allowed to react for 24 h at room temperature (20-25° C.) to form a catalyst solution (B/Zr (mol/mol)=1.81). An emulsion reactor with open baffles was prepared with solidification vessel, so that both reactors are connected to each other with a Teflon tube and to a Schlenk line. An argon atmosphere was applied to the reactors by successive vacuum-pressurization cycles. 40 ml of dry and degassed PFC was added into the emulsion reactor and stirred at 600 rpm while cooling down to −10° C. 100 mL of PFC was added into the solidification vessel and heated to 90° C. under stirring (600 rpm) for at least 30 minutes. The catalyst solution was added to the emulsion reactor followed by 1 mL of the MAO/surfactant solution prepared above. An emulsion was prepared by stirring for 15 minutes at −10/−5° C. The cold emulsion was siphoned off from the emulsion reactor to the hot PFC in the solidification vessel by using the teflon tube. The solidification takes place immediately. The suspension was allowed to cool to room temperature by lowering the oil bath temperature, whilst decreasing the stirring speed down to 300 rpm. Stirring of the catalyst suspension was stopped after 15 min. The catalyst floats on the top of the solvent. The solvent was siphoned out from the reactor. The catalyst was dried at +50° C. for 2 hours over an argon flow. An SEM picture of the boron doped catalyst is shown in FIG. 1. Comparative Catalyst Preparation C4 No Boron Modified Catalyst (MC-Complex 4) 0.2 ml of surfactant was dissolved in 3 ml toluene in a septa bottle. 0.5 ml of this solution was added into 6 ml MAO (30 w % MAO in toluene). It was stirred for 30 min at 20° C. 84.4 mg of MC-complex 4 was mixed and a bright red complex solution was formed. Into the emulsion reactor 50 ml PFC was added. It was cooled down to −9° C. for 20 min. An emulsion was made by adding 6 ml of previously prepared metallocene/MAO/surfactant-solution. Colour of the emulsion was red. Emulsion was stirred for 15 min (612 rpm) at −5° C. The glass receiving reactor (volume 250 ml) was connected to the argon line and heated at 90° C. The circulated, filtered and argon bubbled PFC (100 ml) was added by using a syringe to the glass reactor. Then the solvent was heated at 90° C. for 30 min with stirring. The emulsion was transferred into the 100 ml of hot PFC (stirring 612 rpm) by using a teflon tube. Temperature decreased from +89° C. to−80° C. during the addition of the emulsion. A solid catalyst particles were formed immediately. The mixture was let cool down to 35° C. under stirring for 35 min. PFC was siphoned out and the remaining red catalyst dried in argon flow at 50° C. for one hour. Polymerisation Examples (PP Homopolymerisation) (P10 and CP4) The polymerisations were performed in a 5 L reactor. 200 μl of triethylaluminum was fed as a scavenger in 5 mL of dry and degassed pentane. The desired amount of hydrogen (15 mmol) was then loaded (measured in mmol) and 1100 g of liquid propylene was fed into the reactor. The temperature was set to 30° C. The desired amount of catalyst (E7, C4) in 5 mL of hexadecafluoro-1,3-dimethylcyclohexane was flushed into the reactor with a nitrogen overpressure. The temperature was then raised to 70° C. over a period of 15 minutes (=“RAMP” time). The polymerisation was stopped after 30 minutes (or 60 or 120 minutes) by venting the reactor and flushing with nitrogen before the polymer was collected. The catalyst activity was calculated on the basis of the 30 minutes period according to the following formula: Catalyst activity was determined according to: [in-line-formulae]Activity kg/g(cat)/h=amount of polymer produced in kg/(catalyst loading in grams×polymerization time in hours)[/in-line-formulae] Homopolymerisation Results Using Boron Modified Catalyst E7 (P10) Vs.

Also the kinetic profile is more favourable with boron activators, because the catalyst shows accelerating reaction rate after 2 hours polymerisation when the comparison catalyst is loosing its activity. Polyethylene Formation Example 8 Catalyst Preparation (E8) As complex was used bis(n-butylcyclopentadienyl)Hf dibenzyl (n-BuCp)2Hf(CH2Ph)2 40 ml of dried PFC was filled in 50 ml glass reactor. In another septum bottle catalyst solution was prepared by reacting 100 mg of the complex with 5 ml of 30 wt-% MAO solution in toluene one hour. (MAO was modified with 1 g of 2,6-ditert-butyl-4-methylphenol in 2.5 ml toluene) and 104 mg of borate (Ph3CB(PhF5)4. Prepared catalyst solution as well 0.15 ml of surfactant (3-perfluoro-octyl-1,2-propenoxide)) were added to the glass reactor at a temperature of 0° C. Reaction mixture was stirred 15 minutes at 0° C. with 550 rpm. Formed emulsion was transferred via 1×2 mm Teflon tube to 100 ml of hot PFC (heated up with oil bath to 95° C.) and under stirring with 430 rpm. Oil bath was switched off and stirring was continued for 35 minutes and after that the stirring speed was reduced to 210 rpm for 35 min. The catalyst was left to settle up on top of PFC and after 45 minutes the liquid phase was siphoned off. Solid catalyst powder was dried for 2 hours at 50° C. over argon flow. 0.95 g free flowing light catalyst powder was obtained. Catalyst E8 was used in polymerisation example P11. Comparative Example 5 (C5) Catalyst was prepared as in example 8, but the amount of complex was 109 mg and no borate was used. 1.20 mg of catalyst was obtained. Catalyst C5 was used in polymeriwation example CP5, Polymerisation Examples P11 and CP5 Ethylene polymerisations were carried out in 5 liter reactor, which was filled with 1100 g of propane. 55.5 ml of 1-hexene was added along with ethylene. 78.90 mg of catalyst as prepared above was injected under 30 bar N2 over pressure and temperature was raised to 80° C. within 10 to 15 minutes. Hydrogen amount, corresponding 54 bar/677 ml at room temperature, was added to the reactor. Pressure was kept at 38 bar (ethylene partial pressure 5 bar). The polymerization was continued for 60 minutes. Polymerisation results are disclosed in Table 6 TABLE 6 P11 CP5 Catalyst E8 C5 Productivity kg/PE/g cat 6.2 1.3 MW g/mol 210000 189000 Mn g/mol 90800 85900 Mz g/mol 400000 344000 Hexane (FTIR) wt-% 4.3 3.9 As can be seen by boron modification activity was increased from 1.3 kgPE/g cat up to 6.2 kgPE/g cat. Catalyst Preparation Example 9 (E9) Boron Modified Catalyst Synthesis with MC Complex 4: rac-cyclohexyl(methyl)silanediylbis[2-methyl-4-(4′-tert-butylphenyl)indenyl]zirconium dichloride (CAS no 888227-55-2, WO2006/060544, Obtained from Commercial Source) Inside the glovebox, 0.08 mL (80 μL) of surfactant was mixed with 2 mL of MAO in a septum bottle. Inside the glove box, 10 mg oft rac-cyclohexyl(methyl)silanediylbis[2-methyl-4-(4′-tert-butylphenyl)indenyl]zirconium dichloride (MC complex 4) was dissolved with 2 mL of 30 wt-% MAO in a septum bottle. This was stirred for 30 minutes. 1.6 ml of MAO was placed in another septa bottle, then 0.4 ml of the MAO/metallocene complex mixture was added just 30 min before 27 μL the surfactant as defined hereinbefore was added. This was left overnight in glove box. A mixture of 61.5 mg of the MC 4 and 4 ml of MAO was prepared in a septum bottle inside the glove box and stirred for 60 minutes. Borate cocatalyst was added and reacted overnight at room temperature. Borate type and amounts in preparation as B/Zr mol/mol ratio are disclosed in table 7. In a 50 mL emulsification glass reactor (equipped with “open baffles” and an overhead stirrer), a liquid-liquid 2-phase system was generated at −10° C. from 40 mL of perfluoro-1,3-dimethylcyclohexane (PFC) (degassed for at least 30 min with Argon). The emulsion reactor was cooled down to −10° C. and the complex+MAO+borate added followed by 1 ml of MC 4+MAO+surfactant mixture. The reaction mixture was stirred for 3 min, and stirring was continued further 15 min at ˜−10° C. and 600 rpm, after which the emulsion was transferred via 2/4 teflon tube and under stirring to 100 mL of hot perfluoro-1,3-dimethylcyclohexane (heated up with an oil bath at 90° C., and stirred at 600 rpm). Stirring was continued for 15 min, the oil bath was taken down and the mixing speed was reduced to 300 rpm for and finally switched off. Catalyst was let to float for 35 min and siphonated nicely separated PFC away. The catalyst was dried for 2 hours at 50° C. over a flow of Argon. 0.44 g of nice red catalyst was yielded. All other catalysts (E10-E12), were prepared accordingly with variation of the boron compound and amounts thereof as indicated in Table 7.
