FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates generally to peripheral blood biomarkers related to colorectal tumors, and methods of use thereof. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Worldwide, colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer, following lung and breast cancer and leading cause of 650,000 cancer related deaths per year (Jemal, A., Siegel, R., Ward, E., Hao, Y., Xu, J., Thun, M. Cancer Statistics 2009. CA Cancer J Clin 2009; 59; 225-249). In Europe, it is the second largest form of cancer and the second largest cause of death, following lung cancer. However, the CRC screening rates remain suboptimal (˜20%) and lag far behind those for breast, cervical and prostate cancer. Thus, there is urgent need for new and more compliant screening method for CRC. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to biomarkers and relative methods for screening, detecting, diagnosing and monitoring colorectal tumors. The present invention provides a method that includes the steps of (a) measuring in a sample obtained from a subject the amount of each biomarker of a biomarker panel including at least one high priority biomarker and at least two core biomarkers selected from the group consisting of IL1B, PTGS2, S100A8, LTF, CXCL10 and CACNB4; (b) (b) calculating a probability score based on the measurement of step (a); and (c) ruling out colorectal tumor for the subject if the score in step (b) is lower than a pre-determined score; or ruling in the likelihood of colorectal tumor for the subject if the score in step (b) is higher than a pre-determined score. The likelihood of colorectal tumor can further be determined by the sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value (NPV) or positive predictive value (PPV) associated with the score. The present invention also provides a method that includes the steps of (a) measuring in a sample obtained from a subject the amount of each biomarker of a biomarker panel including at least one high priority biomarker and at least two core biomarkers selected from the group consisting of IL1B, PTGS2, S100A8, LTF, CXCL10 and CACNB4; (b) comparing the amount measured in step (a) to a reference value; and (c) classifying the subject as more likely to have colorectal tumor when an increase or a decrease in the amount of each biomarker of the biomarker panel relative to the reference value is detected in step (b).

DETAILED DESCRIPTION The present invention is partially based upon the discovery that a small panel of biomarkers in the blood is able to specifically identify and distinguish subjects with malignant and benign colorectal lesions from subject without such lesions. Accordingly, the invention provides unique advantages to the patient associated with early detection of colorectal tumor in a patient, including increased life span, decreased morbidity and mortality, decreased exposure to radiation during screening and repeat screenings and a minimally invasive diagnostic model. Importantly, the methods of the invention allow for a patient to avoid invasive procedures, thus increasing patient's compliance. Currently, colorectal cancer (CRC) screening rates remain suboptimal (˜20%) and lag far behind those for breast, cervical and prostate cancer. Countries across the European Union have introduced CRC screening programs using colonoscopy, sigmoidoscopy, guaiac or immunochemical fecal occult blood testing (FOBT and FIT) for people aged over 50 years. Lack of compliance with screening recommendations is largely attributed to the unpleasant and cumbersome aspects of these methods. Therefore, it is imperative that a reliable, non-invasive, easy to use screening test is found to meet the needs of a large unscreened and aging population. A blood test would have the highest chance of acceptance by patients and by medical community. The design and characteristics of the invention disclosed herein, in particular the use of blood and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) as testing specimen, establishes a new and more compliant screening method for pre-colonoscopy CRC testing. Specifically, the present invention provides biomarkers related to colorectal tumors that, when used together in combinations of at least two core biomarkers with at least one high priority biomarker, which is individually selected from a panel of biomarker candidates, such biomarker combinations can be used to detect colorectal tumors. Accordingly, the present invention provides methods for screening, detecting, diagnosing and monitoring colorectal tumors by measuring the amount of each biomarker of at least three biomarkers of Table 1 in a sample (such as PBMCs or blood cells). Particularly, the present invention provides a method that includes steps of (a) measuring in a sample obtained from a subject the amount of each biomarker of a biomarker panel including at least three biomarkers of Table 1; (b) calculating a probability score (or a probability value) based on the measurement of step (a); and (c-1) ruling out colorectal tumor for the subject if the score in step (b) is lower than a pre-determined score (or a pre-determined threshold) or (c-2) ruling in the likelihood of colorectal tumor for the subject if the score in step (b) is higher than a pre-determined score (or a pre-determined threshold). In some embodiments, the method includes steps of (a) collecting a nucleic acid sample from a biological sample (e.g., peripheral blood mononuclear cells or blood cells) obtained from a subject; (b) measuring in the nucleic acid sample the amount of each biomarker of a biomarker panel including at least three biomarkers of Table 1; (c) calculating a probability score (or a probability value) based on the measurement of step (b); and (d-1) ruling out colorectal tumor for the subject if the score in step (c) is lower than a pre-determined score (or a pre-determined threshold) or (d-2) ruling in the likelihood of colorectal tumor for the subject if the score in step (c) is higher than a pre-determined score (or a pre-determined threshold). For example, the at least three biomarkers of Table 1 include at least one high priority biomarker and at least two core biomarkers selected from the group consisting of IL1B, PTGS2, S100A8, LTF, CXCL10 and CACNB4, For example, the at least three biomarkers of Table 1 include IL1B, PTGS2 and S100A8. When colorectal tumor is ruled out the subject does not receive a treatment protocol. However, when colorectal tumor is ruled in the subject receives a treatment protocol. The treatment protocol may include, but is not limited to, a colonoscopy, a biopsy, a surgery, a chemotherapy, a radiotherapy, or any combination thereof. The probability score can be calculated according to any method known in the art. For example, the probability score is calculated from a logistic regression prediction model applied to the measurement. For example, the probability score is calculated by: log  ( Pr  ( y i = 1 ) 1 - Pr  ( y i = 1 ) ) = β 0 + β 1  x 1 , i + … + β m  x m , i and where xm,i is a measured value for the biomarker m and subject i and (β0, β1, . . . , βm) is a vector of coefficients. In other words, β0 is a panel-specific constant, and βm is the corresponding logistic regression coefficient of the biomarker m. In some embodiments, the likelihood of colorectal tumor is also determined by the sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value (NPV) or positive predictive value (PPV) associated with the score. The present invention also provides a method that includes steps of (a) measuring in a sample obtained from a subject the amount of each biomarker of a biomarker panel including at least three biomarkers of Table 1; (b) comparing the amount measured in step (a) to a reference value; and (c) classifying the subject as more likely to have colorectal tumor when an increase or a decrease in the amount of each biomarker of the biomarker panel relative to the reference value is detected in step (b). In some embodiments, the method includes the steps of (a) collecting a nucleic acid sample from a biological sample (e.g., peripheral blood mononuclear cells or blood cells) obtained from a subject; (b) measuring in the nucleic acid sample the amount of each biomarker of a biomarker panel including at least three biomarkers of Table 1; (c) comparing the amount measured in step (b) to a reference value; and (d) classifying the subject as more likely to have colorectal tumor when an increase or a decrease in the amount of each biomarker of the biomarker panel relative to the reference value is detected in step (c). For example, the at least three biomarkers of Table 1 include at least one high priority biomarker and at least two core biomarkers selected from the group consisting of IL1B, PTGS2, S100A8, LTF, CXCL10 and CACNB4. For example, the at least three biomarkers of Table 1 include IL1B, PTGS2 and S100A8. In some embodiments, the method further includes a step of (i) selecting a treatment regimen (or protocol) for the subject classified as more likely to have colorectal tumor or (ii) administering to the subject classified as more likely to have colorectal tumor a therapeutically effective amount of at least one colorectal cancer-modulating agent. Treatment regimen for colorectal cancer is standard of care for the treatment of colorectal tumor (e.g., colorectal polyps such as adenomas and colorectal carcinomas) as described in the most current National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines. The treatment regimen may include administering a therapeutically effective amount of at least one colorectal cancer-modulating agent. The one or more colorectal cancer-modulating agents can comprise an alkylating agent, an antibiotic agent, an antimetabolic agent, a hormonal agent, a plant-derived agent, a retinoid agent, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, a biologic agent, a gene therapy agent, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, other anti-cancer agent, or combinations thereof. Exemplary colorectal cancer-modulating agents include, but are not limited to, Adrucil (Fluorouracil), Avastin (Bevacizumab), Bevacizumab, Camptosar Orinotecan Hydrochloride), Capecitabine, Cetuximab, Efudex (Fluorouracil), Eloxatin (Oxaliplatin), Erbitux (Cetuximab), Fluoroplex (Fluorouracil), Fluorouracil, Irinotecan Hydrochloride, Leucovorin Calcium, Oxaliplatin, Panitumumab, Regorafenib, Stivarga (Regorafenib), Vectibix (Panitumumab), Wellcovorin (Leucovorin Calcium), Xeloda (Capecitabine), Zaltrap (Ziv-Aflibercept), and Ziv-Aflibercept. “Treating” or “treatment” as used herein with regard to a condition may refer to preventing the condition, slowing the onset or rate of development of the condition, reducing the risk of developing the condition, preventing or delaying the development of symptoms associated with the condition, reducing or ending symptoms associated with the condition, generating a complete or partial regression of the condition, or some combination thereof. For example, the improvements in colorectal cancer risk factors as a result of treatment with one or more colorectal cancer-modulating agents can comprise a reduction in polyp formation, a reduction in polyp size, a reduction in polyp number, a reduction in symptoms of ulcerative colitis, inflammatory bowel disease, and/or Crohn's disease, or combinations thereof. The present invention also provides at least three biomarkers of Table 1 for use in a method of determining the likelihood of colorectal tumor, detecting colorectal tumor, diagnosing colorectal tumor and/or monitoring colorectal tumor. The method may include the steps of: (I) (a) measuring in a nucleic acid sample from a biological sample (e.g., peripheral blood mononuclear cells or blood cells) the amount of each biomarker of the at least three biomarkers of Table 1; (b) calculating a probability score based on the measurement of step (a); and (c-1) ruling out colorectal tumor for the subject if the score in step (c) is lower than a pre-determined score (or a pre-determined threshold) or (c-2) ruling in the likelihood of colorectal tumor for the subject if the score in step (b) is higher than a pre-determined score (or a pre-determined threshold); or(II) (a) measuring in a nucleic acid sample from a biological sample (e.g., peripheral blood mononuclear cells or blood cells) the amount of each biomarker of the at least three biomarkers of Table 1; (b) comparing the amount measured in step (a) to a reference value; and (c) classifying the subject as more likely to have colorectal tumor when an increase or a decrease in the amount of each biomarker of the biomarker panel relative to the reference value is detected in step (b). For example, the at least three biomarkers of Table 1 include at least one high priority biomarker and at least two core biomarkers selected from the group consisting of IL1B, PTGS2, S100A8, LTF, CXCL10 and CACNB4. For example, the at least three biomarkers of Table 1 include IL1B, PTGS2 and S100A8. The measuring step of any method or use described herein may include a step of contacting the nucleic acid sample obtained from the subject with one or more primers described herein that specifically hybridize to the biomarker of interest. The measuring step may further include a step of amplifying the biomarker of interest with such one or more primers. The actual measurement of levels of the biomarkers can be determined at the nucleic acid or protein level using any method known in the art. For example, at the nucleic acid level, the biomarkers can be measured by extracting ribonucleic acids from the sample and performing any type of quantitative PCR on the reverse-transcribed nucleic acids. Another way to detect the biomarkers can also be by a whole transcriptome analysis based on high-throughput sequencing methodologies, e.g., RNA-seq, or on microarray technology, e.g., Affymetrix arrays. By way of example, other methods that can be used for measuring the biomarker may involve any other method of quantification known in the art of nucleic acids, such as but not limited to amplification of specific sequences, oligonucleotide probes, hybridization of target genes with complementary probes, fragmentation by restriction endonucleases and study of the resulting fragments (polymorphisms), pulsed field gels techniques, isothermic multiple-displacement amplification, rolling circle amplification or replication, immuno-PCR, among others known to those skilled in the art. By using information provided by database entries for the biomarker sequences, biomarker expression levels can be detected and measured using techniques well known to one of ordinary skill in the art. For example, biomarker sequences within the sequence database entries, or within the sequences disclosed herein, can be used to construct probes and primers for detecting biomarker mRNA sequences in methods which specifically, and, preferably, quantitatively amplify specific nucleic acid sequences such as reverse-transcription based real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Levels of biomarkers can also be determined at the protein level, e.g., by measuring the levels of peptides encoded by the gene products described herein, or activities thereof. Such methods are well known in the art and include, e.g., immunoassays based on antibodies to proteins encoded by the genes, aptamers or molecular imprints. Alternatively, a suitable method can be selected to determine the activity of proteins encoded by the biomarker genes according to the activity of each protein analyzed. The biomarker proteins, polypeptides, mutations, and polymorphisms thereof can be detected in any suitable manner, but is typically detected by contacting a sample from the subject with an antibody which binds the biomarker protein, polypeptide, mutation, or polymorphism and then detecting the presence or absence of a reaction product. The antibody may be monoclonal, polyclonal, chimeric, or a fragment of the foregoing, as discussed in detail above, and the step of detecting the reaction product may be carried out with any suitable immunoassay. The sample from the subject is typically a biological sample as described above, and may be the same sample used to conduct the method described above. Those skilled in the art will be familiar with numerous specific immunoassay and nucleic acid amplification assay formats and variations thereof which may be useful for carrying out the embodiments of the invention disclosed herein. Preferably, expression levels of the biomarkers of the present invention are detected by RT-qPCR, and in particular by real-time PCR, as described further herein. In general, total RNA can be isolated from the target sample, such as peripheral blood or PBMC, using any isolation procedure. This RNA can then be used to generate first strand copy DNA (cDNA) using any procedure, for example, using random primers, oligo-dT primers or random-oligo-dT primers which are oligo-dT primers coupled on the 3′-end to short stretches of specific sequence covering all possible combinations. The cDNA can then be used as a template in quantitative PCR. In real-time PCR quantification of PCR products relies, for example, on increases in fluorescence, released at each amplification cycle of the reaction, for example, by a probe that hybridizes to a portion of the amplification product. Fluorescence approaches used in real-time quantitative PCR are typically based on a fluorescent reporter dye such as FAM, fluorescein, HEX, TET, etc. and a quencher such as TAMRA, DABSYL, Black Hole, etc. When the quencher is separated from the probe during the extension phase of PCR, the fluorescence of the reporter can be measured. Systems like Universal ProbeLibrary, Molecular Beacons, Taqman Probes, Scorpion Primers or Sunrise Primers and others use this approach to perform real-time quantitative PCR. Alternatively, fluorescence can be measured from DNA-intercalating fluorochromes such as Sybr Green. The abundance of target RNA molecules can be performed by real-time PCR in a relative or absolute manner. Relative methods can be based on the threshold cycle determination (Ct) or, in the case of the Roche's PCR instruments, the crossing point (Cp). Relative RNA molecule abundance is then calculated by the delta Ct (delta Cp) method by subtracting Ct (Cp) value of one or more housekeeping genes. An example of housekeeping genes which can be used are reported in Table 2. Alternatively, absolute measurement can be performed by determining the copy number of the target RNA molecule by the mean of standard curves. Table 1 lists an example of forward and reverse primers as well as the identification number of the Universal ProbeLibrary probe (Roche) which could be used for the measurement of the correspondent biomarker by real-time PCR. The biomarkers and methods of the present invention allow one of skill in the art to screen, identify, diagnose, or otherwise assess those subjects who do not exhibit any symptoms of colorectal tumors, but who nonetheless may be at risk for developing colorectal tumors, or for experiencing symptoms characteristic of a cancerous condition. Table 1 provides information including a non-exhaustive list of peripheral blood biomarkers related to colorectal tumors according to the invention. One skilled in the art will recognize that the biomarkers presented herein encompasses proteins, nucleic acids (cDNAs, mRNAs, RNAs, DNAs), and metabolites, together with their polymorphisms, mutants, isoform variants, related metabolites, derivatives, precursors including nucleic acids and pro-proteins, cleavage products, protein-ligand complexes, post-translationally modified variants (such as cross-linking or glycosylation), fragments, and degradation products, as well as any multi-unit nucleic acid, protein, and glycoprotein structures comprised of any of the biomarkers as constituent subunits of the fully assembled structure. All biomarkers expression within blood samples have been validated through experimentation.

A “biomarker” used herein refers to a molecular indicator of a specific biological property; a biochemical feature or facet that can be used to detect colorectal cancer. “Biomarker” encompasses, without limitation, proteins, nucleic acids, and metabolites, together with their polymorphisms, mutants, isoform variants, related metabolites, derivatives, precursors including nucleic acids and pro-proteins, cleavage products, protein-ligand complexes, post-translationally modified variants (such as cross-linking or glycosylation), fragments, and degradation products, as well as any multi-unit nucleic acid, protein, and glycoprotein structures comprised of any of the biomarkers as constituent subunits of the fully assembled structure, and other analytes or sample-derived measures. “Measuring”, “measurement”, “detection” and “detecting” mean assessing the presence, absence, quantity or amount (which can be an effective amount) of either a given substance within a clinical or subject-derived sample, including qualitative or quantitative concentration levels of such substances, or otherwise evaluating the values or categorization of a subject's clinical parameters. “Altered”, “an increase” or “a decrease” refers to a detectable change or difference between the measured biomarker and the reference value from a reasonably comparable state, profile, measurement, or the like. One skilled in the art should be able to determine a reasonable measurable change. Such changes may be all or none. They may be incremental and need not to be linear. They may be by orders of magnitude. A change may be an increase or decrease by 1%, 5%, 10%, 20%,30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 99%, 100%, or more, or any value in between 0% and 100%. Alternatively the change may be 1-fold, 1.5-fold, 2-fold, 3-fold, 4-fold, 5-fold or more, or any values in between 1-fold and five-fold. The change may be statistically significant with a p value of 0.1, 0.05, 0.001, or 0.0001. The term “colorectal tumor” is meant to include a broad spectrum of epithelial-derived tumors ranging from benign growths to invasive cancer. These include colorectal polyps, such as adenomas, and colorectal carcinomas. The terms “adenomatous polyps”, “adenoma” are used interchangeably. The terms “individual”, “host”, “patient”, and “subject” are used interchangeably. As used herein, a “subject” includes a mammal. The mammal can be e.g., a human or appropriate non-human mammal, such as primate, mouse, rat, dog, cat, cow, horse, goat, camel, sheep or a pig. The subject can also be a bird or fowl. In one embodiment, the mammal is a human. A subject can be male or female. A subject can be one who has not been previously diagnosed or identified as having colorectal tumor. A subject can be a healthy subject who is classified as low risk for developing a colon condition (such as colorectal polyps or colorectal cancer). Alternatively, a subject can be one who has a risk of developing colorectal tumor. A risk factor is anything that affects the subject's chance of getting a disease such as colorectal tumor. Risk factors that may increase a person's chance of developing colorectal polyps or colorectal cancer include, but are not limited to, age, history of colorectal polyps or colorectal cancer (especially true if the polyps are large or if there are many of them), history of inflammatory bowel disease (such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease), history of colorectal cancer or adenomatous polyps, inherited genetic syndromes (such as familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer (HNPCC), Turcot syndrome, Peuz-Jegher syndrome, MUTYH-associated polyposis), type—diabetes, lifestyle related factors (diet, weight, and exercise), physical inactivity, obesity, smoking and heavy alcohol use. A “sample” in the context of the present invention is a biological sample isolated from a subject and can include, by way of example and not limitation, whole blood, serum, plasma, blood cells, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, endothelial cells, circulating tumor cells, tissue biopsies, lymphatic fluid, ascites fluid, interstitial fluid, bone marrow, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), saliva, mucous, sputum, sweat, urine, or any other secretion, excretion, or other bodily fluids. In some embodiments, the sample refers to peripheral blood mononuclear cells or blood cells. “Peripheral blood mononuclear cell” (PBMC) refers to any cell present in the blood having a round nucleus. This fraction is conventionally isolated by centrifuging whole blood in a liquid density gradient. It contains mainly lymphocytes and monocytes while excluding red blood cells and granulocytes (eosinophils, basophils, and neutrophils). Rare cells with a round nucleus such as progenitor endothelial cells or circulating tumor cells could also be present in this fraction. The term “primer” refers to a strand of nucleic acid that serves as a starting point for DNA replication. The terms “probe” and “hydrolysis probe” refer to a short strand of nucleic acid designed to hybridize to a region within the amplicon and is dual labeled with a reporter dye and a quenching dye. The close proximity of the quencher suppresses the fluorescence of the reporter dye. The probe relies on the 5′-3′ exonuclease activity of Taq polymerase, which degrades a hybridized non-extendible DNA probe during the extension step of the PCR. Once the Taq polymerase has degraded the probe, the fluorescence of the reporter increases at a rate that is proportional to the amount of template present. The term “gene expression” means the production of a protein or a functional mRNA from its gene. The terms “signature”, “classifier”, “model” and “predictor” are used interchangeably. They refer to an algorithm that discriminates between disease states with a predetermined level of statistical significance. A two-class classifier is an algorithm that uses data points from measurements from a sample and classifies the data into one of two groups. In certain embodiments, the data used in the classifier is the relative expression of nucleic acids or proteins in a biological sample. Protein or nucleic acid expression levels in a subject can be compared to levels in patients previously diagnosed as disease free or with a specified condition. A “reference or baseline level/value” as used herein can be used interchangeably and is meant to be relative to a number or value derived from population studies, including without limitation, such subjects having similar age range, disease status (e.g., stage), subjects in the same or similar ethnic group, or relative to the starting sample of a subject undergoing treatment for cancer. Such reference values can be derived from statistical analyses and/or risk prediction data of populations obtained from mathematical algorithms and computed indices of colorectal cancer. Reference indices can also be constructed and used utilizing algorithms and other methods of statistical and structural classification. In some embodiments of the present invention, the reference or baseline value is the expression level of a particular biomarker of interest in a control sample derived from one or more healthy subjects or subjects who have not been diagnosed with any cancer. In some embodiments of the present invention, the reference or baseline value is the expression level of a particular biomarker of interest in a sample obtained from the same subject prior to any cancer treatment. In other embodiments of the present invention, the reference or baseline value is the expression level of a particular biomarker of interest in a sample obtained from the same subject during a cancer treatment. Alternatively, the reference or baseline value is a prior measurement of the expression level of a particular gene of interest in a previously obtained sample from the same subject or from a subject having similar age range, disease status (e.g., stage) to the tested subject. The term “ruling out” as used herein is meant that the subject is selected not to receive a treatment protocol. The term “ruling in” as used herein is meant that the subject is selected to receive a treatment protocol. “Altered”, “changed” or “significantly different” refer to a detectable change or difference from a reasonably comparable state, profile, measurement, or the like. One skilled in the art should be able to determine a reasonable measurable change. Such changes may be all or none. They may be incremental and need not be linear. They may be by orders of magnitude. A change may be an increase or decrease by 1%, 5%, 10%, 20%,30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 99%, 100%, or more, or any value in between 0% and 100%. Alternatively the change may be 1-fold, 1.5-fold 2-fold, 3-fold, 4-fold, 5-fold or more, or any values in between 1-fold and five-fold. The change may be statistically significant with a p value of 0.1, 0.05, 0.001, or 0.0001. The term “normalization” or “normalizer” as used herein refers to the expression of a differential value in terms of a standard value to adjust for effects which arise from technical variation due to sample handling, sample preparation and mass spectrometry measurement rather than biological variation of protein concentration in a sample. For example, when measuring the expression of a differentially expressed protein (nucleic acid), the absolute value for the expression of the protein (nucleic acid) can be expressed in terms of an absolute value for the expression of a standard protein (nucleic acid) that is substantially constant in expression. This prevents the technical variation of sample preparation and PCR measurement from impeding the measurement of protein (nucleic acid) concentration levels in the sample. The term “score” or “scoring” refers to calculating a probability likelihood (or a probability value) by the model (e.g., a logistic regression model) for a sample. For the present invention, values closer to 1.0 are used to represent the likelihood that a sample is derived from a patient with a colon condition (such as an polyps, adenoma, colorectal carcinomas, or colorectal tumors), values closer to 0.0 represent the likelihood that a sample is derived from a patient without a colon condition (such as an polyps, adenoma, colorectal carcinomas, or colorectal tumors). A “pre-determined score” refers to a probability threshold that has been determined during the modeling/training phase by, for instance, logistic regression and ROC analysis, and that defines the likelihood of colorectal tumor and/or diagnosis of colorectal tumor. A skilled artisan can readily determine such score according to any methods available in the art. The proposed method for analyzing and using a biomarker profile for detection, diagnosis and monitoring of colorectal tumors is to a) extract RNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells, b) reverse-transcribe said RNA into cDNA, c) perform a real-time PCR amplification specific for each biomarker of interest and d) perform statistical data analysis derived from disclosed composition and methods, using, for example, penalized logistic regression to build prediction models. By way of example and not intended to limit any aspect of the present invention, other compositions and methods can be applied for analyzing data derived from the measurement of one or more biomarkers of the present invention. All data and statistical analyses can be conducted on R software (R-CRAN free software environment for statistical computing and graphics), MATLAB (The MathWorks), SPSS (IBM), SYSTAT (Systat Software Inc.), and other supports allowing numerical analyses. Methods that can be used for analyzing data derived from the measurement of said biomarkers related to colorectal tumors involves any art-recognized statistical analysis of data, such as logistic and penalized logistic regression, support vector machine, random forest, fuzzy logic, neural network, gene clustering, data mining tools, and other algorithms or computed indices known in the art and disclosed herein. Logistic regression (McCullagh, P. and Nelder, A. (1983) Generalized linear models, Monographs on Statistics and Applied Probability) is one of the common methods to discriminate two groups. If we define yi as being 0 or 1 according to its group, we can model through a logistic regression as log  ( Pr  ( y i = 1 ) 1 - Pr  ( y i = 1 ) ) = β 0 + β 1  x 1 , i + … + β m  x m , i Where xm,i is a deltaCp value for the biomarker m and subject i and (β0, β1, . . . , βm) is a vector of coefficients (parameters to be estimated) for a multivariate logistic regression. To estimate these parameters one can use the maximum likelihood method. For example, adenoma can be determined by a predictive model equation: log  ( Pr  ( y i = 1 ) 1 - Pr  ( y i = 1 ) ) = - 0.668 + 0.07 × BCL   3 + 0.449 × CACNB   4 - 0.274 × CCR   1 + 0.1  .74 × CXCL   10 - 0.260 × IL   1  B - 0.115 × ITGA   2 - 0.083 × ITGB   5 - 0.130 × LTF - 0.024 × MAP   2  K   3 - 0.213 × MAPK   6 + 0.297 × MMP   11 + 0.001 × PTGES - 0.140 × PTGS   2 - 0.145 × S   100  A   8 - 0.212 × TNFSF   13  B . For example, carcinoma can be determined by a predictive model equation: log  ( Pr  ( y i = 1 ) 1 - Pr  ( y i = 1 ) ) = - 8.544 + 0.707 × CACNB   4 + 0.688 × CXCL   10 - 0.592 × IL   1  B - 0.234 × LTF + 0.044 × MMP   11 + 0.105 × PTGES - 0.143 × PTGS   2 - 1.605 × S   100  A   8. It is noted that for high dimensional data set with multi-co-linearity, the logistic regression can fail. Since some of the selected biomarkers might be highly correlated, a solution is to use penalized logistic regression. Penalized logistic regression is based on mathematical equation derived from logistic regression. More specifically, penalized logistic regression is a ridge regression for logistic model with L2-norm or L1-norm penalty. To estimate the parameters in this method a quadratic (L2) or/and L1-norm penalty is added on the log-likelihood that should be maximized. To choose the best value of A1 and X2, the cross-validation is used with the A1C criteria. To fit the penalized logistic model, the following algorithms (packages in R Cran, statistical software) can be used: glmpath (Park M. Y and Hastie T. (2006) An L1 Regularization-path Algorithm for Generalized Linear Models. A generalization of the LARS algorithm for GLMs and the Cox proportional hazard model), penalized (Goeman, J. (2010) L1 (lasso) and L2 (ridge) penalized estimation in GLMs and in the Cox model) and glmnet (Hasti, T., Tibshirani and R., Friedman, J. (2010). Lasso and elastic-net regularized generalized linear models) with different tuning parameters. The application of logistic regression to biological problems is routine in the art. Various statistical analysis softwares, such as the ones mentioned above, can be used for building logistic regression models. Fitted logistic regression models are tested by asking whether the model can correctly predict the clinical outcome using patient data other than that with which the logistic regression model was fitted, but having a known clinical outcome. After training, the model output from 0 (control) to 1 (cancer) can be calculated in blind fashion by the average error of all N predictions (a validation group). Based on the output values, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve can be built to calculate the outcome of clinical prediction: specificity and sensitivity of CRC cancer detection. They are statistical measures of the performance of a binary classification test. Sensitivity measures the proportion of actual positives which are correctly identified as such (e.g., the percentage of sick people who are correctly identified as having the condition). Specificity measures the proportion of negatives which are correctly identified (e.g., the percentage of healthy people who are correctly identified as not having the condition). A perfect predictor would be described as 100% sensitive (i.e., predicting all people from the sick group as sick) and 100% specific (i.e., not predicting anyone from the healthy group as sick). However, any predictor will possess a minimum error bound. One embodiment of the present invention is a predictive model comprising a combination/profile of peripheral blood mononuclear cell biomarkers detecting colorectal tumors preferably with sensitivity equal or above to 60% and specificity equal or above 84%. The term “sensitivity of a test” refers to the probability that a test result will be positive when the disease is present in the patient (true positive rate). This is derived from the number of patients with the disease who have a positive test result (true positive) divided by the total number of patients with the disease, including those with true positive results and those patients with the disease who haven negative result, i.e., false negative. The term “specificity of a test” refers to the probability that a test result will be negative when the disease is not present in the patient (true negative rate). This is derived from the number of patients without the disease who have a negative test result (true negative) divided by all patients without the disease, including those with a true negative result and those patients without the disease who have a positive test result, e.g. false positive. While the sensitivity, specificity, true or false positive rate, and true or false negative rate of a test provide an indication of a test's performance, e.g. relative to other tests, to make a clinical decision for an individual patient based on the test's result, the clinician requires performance parameters of the test with respect to a given population. The term “positive predictive value” (PPV) refers to the probability that a positive result correctly identifies a patient who has the disease, which is the number of true positives divided by the sum of true positives and false positives. The term “negative predictive value” or “NPV” refers to the probability that a negative test correctly identifies a patient without the disease, which is the number of true negatives divided by the sum of true negatives and false negatives. Like the PPV, it also is inherently impacted by the prevalence of the disease and pre-test probability of the population intended to be tested. A positive result from a test with a sufficient PPV can be used to rule in the disease for a patient, while a negative result from a test with a sufficient NPV can be used to rule out the disease, if the disease prevalence for the given population, of which the patient can be considered apart, is known. A “Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve” as used herein refers to a plot of the true positive rate (sensitivity) against the false positive rate (specificity) for a binary classifier system as its discrimination threshold is varied. A ROC curve can be represented equivalently by plotting the fraction of true positives out of the positives (TPR=true positive rate) versus the fraction of false positives out of the negatives (FPR=false positive rate). Each point on the ROC curve represents a sensitivity/specificity pair corresponding to a particular decision threshold. AUC represents the area under the ROC curve. The AUC is an overall indication of the diagnostic accuracy of 1) a biomarker or a panel of biomarkers and 2) a ROC curve. AUC is determined by the “trapezoidal rule.” For a given curve, the data points are connected by straight line segments, perpendiculars are erected from the abscissa to each data point, and the sum of the areas of the triangles and trapezoids so constructed is computed. In certain embodiments of the methods provided herein, a biomarker protein has an AUC in the range of about 0.75 to 1.0. In certain of these embodiments, the AUC is in the range of about 0.8 to 0.8, 0.9 to 0.95, or 0.95 to 1.0. The methods provided herein are minimally invasive and pose little or no risk of adverse effects. As such, they may be used to diagnose, monitor and provide clinical management of subjects who do not exhibit any symptoms of a colon condition (colorectal tumor) and subjects classified as low risk for developing a colon condition (colorectal tumor). For example, the methods disclosed herein may be used to diagnose colorectal tumor in a subject who does not present with a colorectal polyp and/or has not presented with a colorectal polyp in the past, but who nonetheless deemed at risk of developing a colorectal polyp and/or a colon condition. Similarly, the methods disclosed herein may be used as a strictly precautionary measure to diagnose healthy subjects who are classified as low risk for developing a colon condition. The invention further provides a kit to be used according to the aforementioned method for detecting the presence of colorectal tumors from a peripheral blood sample, in particular from a sample of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). The kit may comprise one or more than one primer pair for measuring one or more biomarkers listed in Table 1, particularly the panel of biomarkers as described herein. Moreover, the kit may comprise primer pairs specific for one or more housekeeping genes, for example for the genes TPT1, RPLP0 and NACA described in Table 2. The kit may further comprise one or more probes, reference samples for performing measurement quality controls, plastic containers and reagents for performing test reactions and instructions for using the reagents in the method of any one of the preceding claims. Optionally, a kit may comprise instructions for use in the form of a label or a separate insert. The kits can contain reagents that specifically bind to proteins in the panels described, herein. These reagents can include antibodies. It is to be understood that while the invention has been described in conjunction with the detailed description thereof, the foregoing description is intended to illustrate and not limit the scope of the invention, which is defined by the scope of the appended claims. Other aspects, advantages, and modifications are within the scope of the present disclosure. The following examples are provided to better illustrate the claimed invention and are not to be interpreted as limiting the scope of the invention. To the extent that specific materials are mentioned, it is merely for purposes of illustration and is not intended to limit the invention. One skilled in the art may develop equivalent means or reactants without the exercise of inventive capacity and without departing from the scope of the invention. EXAMPLE Methods for Colorectal Cancer Detection from a Blood Sample Patients and Samples 181 subjects older than 50 years were prospectively enrolled in a case-control study including six centres. Upon colonoscopy, they were diagnosed to be control subjects (n=75), patients with adenoma≧1 cm (n=61) or patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) stage I-IV (n=45). Written informed consent was obtained from all study participants adhering to the local ethical guidelines. All subjects had no first-degree family history of CRC or a known CRC predisposition, previous history of cancer, no autoimmune or other inflammatory disorders, fever (>38° C.) or infections within the last 4 weeks before colonoscopy, nor any other disease defined in the study. Blood from all subjects has been drawn either up to 30 days before or up to 12 weeks after colonoscopy and prior to any polyp resection or any cancer specific treatment. Adenoma and cancer diagnosis was confirmed histologically from biopsy or surgical specimen. Blood Collection and RNA Extraction All enrolled subjects had a blood sample drawn. Peripheral blood samples for Colox® test were collected into Becton Dickinson (BD) Vacutainer® CPT™ tubes (4×4 ml). Filled CPT™ tubes were kept at room temperature and blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) separation performed within 6 hours according to manufacturer's instructions. PBMC pellets were resuspended in RNAlater® Solution (Life Technologies) and stored at −20° C. Automated purification of total RNA was performed on QIAcube by RNeasy Mini kit (QIAGEN). This included an DNase treatment. RNA concentration was measured by Nanodrop spectrophotometer and RNA quality control was performed by Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies). Samples with a RIN<5 were considered of poor quality and discarded. Isolated total RNA was aliquoted and stored at −80° C. Primers and Probes Real-time PCR assays were purchased from Roche (RealTime ready Custom RT-qPCR Assays) and were based on short hydrolysis Universal ProbeLibrary (UPL) probes. UPL is based on only 165 short hydrolysis probes (8-9 nucleotides). They are labeled at the 5′ end with fluorescein (FAM) and at the 3′ end with a dark quencher dye. In order to maintain the specificity and melting temperature (Tm) that hybridizing qPCR probes require, Locked Nucleic Acids (LNA) are incorporated into the sequence of each UPL probe. LNA's are DNA nucleotide analogues with increased binding strengths compared to standard DNA nucleotides. Forward and reverse primer sequences as well as the UPL probe identification number are listed in table 1. Real-time PCR assays were pre-loaded on RealTime Ready™ Custom panel 384-32, 384-wells LC480 plates (Roche). Quantitative RT-PCR 200 ng of total RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using SuperScript® VILO cDNA Synthesis Kit (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's instructions. Real-time PCR analysis was performed on the Lightcycler 480 instrument. PCR reactions were carried out in duplicates in 384-well plate in 10 μl of total volume. Each well was loaded with 5 μl of RealTime Ready™ DNA Probes Master Mix (Roche) and the cDNA equivalent of 2.5 ng of total RNA by MICROLAB® STARLet pipetting robot (Hamilton). Amplification was performed after 1 minute at 95° C. for the Taq DNA Polymerase activation which was followed by 40 cycles of 2 sec at 95° C. and 30 sec at 60° C. Positive and negative control samples were generated with each RT batch and were included in each plate and for each assay. The negative control was a RT-PCR mixture without RNA and cDNA to confirm no contamination occurred during the assay. The positive control was made with a standardised quantity of Human Universal Reference RNA (Clontech) aliquoted and stored at −80° C. For PCR run validation, the negative control should yield no amplification or a Crossing point (Cp) (the Lightcycler analogue of Ct) value up or equal to 35, and the positive control a Cp value, for each target gene, that falls within a pre-determined range. Cp values are automatically calculated by the Abs Quant/2nd Derivative Max method of the LightCycler 480 analysis software. Gene expression values (Cp) were normalized by the delta Ct method according to the formula: deltaCp=Cptarget−Cpref. In our case the Cpref is the mean Cp value of 3 reference genes (RPLP0, NACA, TPT1). Statistical Analysis Normalized gene expression values (deltaCp) were used for all statistical analyses, which were performed with R software (R-CRAN free software environment for statistical computing and graphics). All the laboratory analyses were performed in a blind fashion. Once the samples were medically reviewed and the data locked according to the Diagnoplex Data Management Manual, the trial statistician became un-blinded for the analysis. 181 subjects were grouped according to diagnosis, gender and country of origin and were randomly assigned to a training and validation set, with the proportion of two third (n=)20) and one third (n=61), respectively. Sample distribution across the three groups under investigation is reported in Table 3. This sample size allowed a significance level α=0.05 and a power 1−β=0.90. TABLE 3 Sample distribution in the control, adenoma and carcinoma groups of Training and Validation set.

The prediction error for the fitted models was estimated on validation set. Predictive classifiers were selected according to the performances on training and validation set. Training and validation set predictions were used to determine the performances of the test such as specificity (true negative/total control) and sensitivity (true positive /total disease) for CRC and adenoma≧1 cm detection. Results Descriptive Analysis Age, gender, sample collection site had no influence on gene expression analysis. Normalized gene expression of 29 biomarkers has been compared across samples and expression levels were in general homogeneous. Analysis of quintile distribution in each biomarker was performed through quintile-quintile plot (Q-Q plot) against a theoretical normal distribution. In general, biomarker expression values were normally distributed and only few biomarkers show a deviation from the reference distribution in the tails. Correlation analysis (Pearson's) and hierarchical clustering of 29 biomarkers have been performed. Only few variables appeared to be strongly correlated (CXCL10 and CXCL11, IL1B and PTGS2, EGR1 and PTGS2: correlation coefficient: 0.8; S110A8 and TNFSF13B, ITGB5 and ITGA2, JUN and IL8 correlation coefficient: 0.7); the remaining genes show only weak or no correlation.

By drawing with replacement from the training set (bootstrap method), sets of samples of equal size as the original set were created. This was repeated independently 1000 times. Student's t-test, univariate logistic regression (Dobson, A. J. (2002) An introduction to generalized linear models, 2nd ed., Chapman & Hall/CRC Texts in Statistical Science Series, McCullagh, P. and Nelder, J. A. (1983) Generalized linear models, Monographs on Statistics and Applied Probability), and Wilcoxon rank test were applied to the training set (Table 5) and to each of the bootstrap-derived sets. Moreover, gene expression fold-change (FC) between control and CRC or large adenomas was calculated for each biomarker in the 1000 sets. The results obtained were summarized for each biomarker by the frequency of significant p-values (<0.01 or 0.05) out of 1000 results and by the mean gene expression fold-change. All test results were categorized by magnitude and a partial score given to each category. A final score was obtained by the sum of partial scores resulting the ranking of the 29 biomarkers (Table 5). Based on the score obtained, six biomarkers, IL1B, CCR1, PTGS2, S100A8, PPARG and, LTF appeared to be very strong in discriminating control from carcinoma samples by univariate analysis. All those genes were upregulated in PBMC from cancer patients. The best three downregulated genes were: CACNB4, MMP11 and CXCL10.

These analyses together with logistic regression analysis results allowed us to prioritize the 29 biomarkers (Table 6) and to define a group of core “indispensible” biomarkers composed of PTGS2 and IL1B, and a group of high priority markers composed of S100A8, LTF, CXCL10 and CACNB4.

The model was re-fit at each bootstrap and validated with the out-of-bag samples. The specificity and sensitivity average values over 1000 bootstraps were calculated at the indicated probability score cut-off and reported in Table 7. Different models are defined by different biomarker combinations. Specificity and sensitivity at different probability score cut-offs were calculated and Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curves generated (FIG. 2).

Best performing models were selected according to the following criteria: 1. Performance. The classifiers were selected according to the best performance in training set and validation set. To evaluate the classifier performances the sum of specificity and sensitivity was used as ranking parameter.2. Stability. Stable classifiers across training set and validation set were defined as the ones showing the minimum of two-dimension Euclidean distance calculated between sensitivity and specificity of training set and validation set.The Euclidean distance in 2 dimensions is given by: [in-line-formulae]p=(x1,y1)[/in-line-formulae] [in-line-formulae]q=(x2,y2)[/in-line-formulae] [in-line-formulae]EuclideanDistance(p,q)=√{square root over ((x1−x2)2+(y1−y2)2)}{square root over ((x1−x2)2+(y1−y2)2)}[/in-line-formulae]The parameters x and y are replaced by the model sensitivity and specificity on training set and validation set. [in-line-formulae]p=(SENSITS,SPECITS)[/in-line-formulae] [in-line-formulae]q=(SENSIVS,SENSIVS)[/in-line-formulae] Based on the criteria explained above, two penalized logistic regression models were selected as the best performing ones: one for the detection of adenoma≧1 cm and one for the detection of colorectal carcinoma. The adenoma predictive model equation is: log  ( Pr  ( y i = 1 ) 1 - Pr  ( y i = 1 ) ) = - 0.668 + 0.07 × BCL   3 + 0.449 × CACNB   4 - 0.274 × CCR   1 + 0.1  .74 × CXCL   10 - 0.260 × IL   1  B - 0.115 × ITGA   2 - 0.083 × ITGB   5 - 0.130 × LTF - 0.024 × MAP   2  K   3 - 0.213 × MAPK   6 + 0.297 × MMP   11 + 0.001 × PTGES - 0.140 × PTGS   2 - 0.145 × S   100  A   8 - 0.212 × TNFSF   13  B . The carcinoma predictive model equation is: log  ( Pr  ( y i = 1 ) 1 - Pr  ( y i = 1 ) ) = - 8.544 + 0.707 × CACNB   4 + 0.688 × CXCL   10 - 0.592 × IL   1  B - 0.234 × LTF + 0.044 × MMP   11 + 0.105 × PTGES - 0.143 × PTGS   2 - 1.605 × S   100  A   8. The CRC predictive model showed, for CRC detection, a specificity of 92% and sensitivity of 67% when it was applied to the training set itself without bootstrap and a specificity of 84% and sensitivity of 60% when it was applied to the independent validation set. On the other side, the adenoma predictive model showed, for adenoma>1 cm detection, a specificity of 88% and sensitivity of 50% when it was applied to the training set itself without bootstrap and a specificity of 76% and sensitivity of 47% when it was applied to the independent validation set.
