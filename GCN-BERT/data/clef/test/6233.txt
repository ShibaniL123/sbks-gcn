FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to matrix carrier compositions, methods for their preparations and uses thereof, for example, in pharmaceutical delivery systems. BACKGROUND Oral delivery is considered to be a convenient and widely accepted route of drug administration. Achieving good oral bioavailability for drugs is a cornerstone for an effective oral therapy. The use of an effective carrier for drugs having low bioavailability enables an effective oral administration with improve drug potency and may be used for new drugs, as well as for old medicines that have not historically been available orally. The term bioavailability with respect to oral administration of drugs is directed to the fraction of drug that has reached the systemic circulation after oral administration, while taking into account both absorption and metabolism of the drug. The bioavailability may be affected/dependent on several factors, some of which are related to the Gastrointestinal (GI) tract and some are related to the metabolism of the drug before entering the systemic circulation. The factors include, for example, such factors as: GI motility, GI pH and enzymatic composition including protease, lipase, nuclease, and the like, Particle (active drug) size, physicochemical interaction with gut content, metabolism of the drug by enzymes and electrolytes in the GI tract, metabolism during the first pass clearance of the drug (such as, for example, metabolism of the drug in the liver), Chemical characteristic of the drug (such as, for example, low lipid solubility, acidity of the drug), and the like. With respect to protein drugs, two main factors limit their use by oral route of administration. One is the rapid degradation of the protein drugs, which occurs in GI tract by intestinal enzymes and in mucosal tissues that generally cover the body cavities. The other factor that limits the oral administration of protein drugs is that most protein drugs are relatively large molecules and therefore do not easily crosses the intestinal epithelium. As a result, the bioavailability of orally administered protein-based drugs is typically extremely low. Accordingly, the most common route of protein drugs administration is the parenteral route, which has several drawbacks, such as, for example, being inconvenient to the patients, and being more expensive in terms of drug administration. There is therefore an unmet medical need for an effective non-parenteral mode of administration of protein drugs that will provide protection against biological degradation, improve pharmacokinetics and reduce toxicity. Although sophisticated non-parenteral pharmaceutical systems, such as intra-nasal or inhaled systems, have been developed, oral administration is more favorable, having the major advantage of convenience for increased patient compliance. Various strategies for oral administration of protein drugs have been suggested, such as for example in the following publications: U.S. Pat. No. 7,090,868, U.S. Pat. No. 7,195,780, U.S. Pat. No. 7,316,818, WO 06/062544, U.S. Pat. No. 6,071,535, U.S. Pat. No. 5,874,105, U.S. Pat. No. 6,551,576, U.S. Pat. No. 6,808,720, U.S. Pat. No. 7,083,572, US 2007/0184076, WO 06/097793, WO 05/094785, WO 03/066859 and EP0491114B1. Additionally, since bioavailability may be low for non-protein drugs there is also a growing need for the development of a drug delivery system that can protect the drug from the environment and may direct the drug to a targeted site or organ, obviating unwanted side effects while simultaneously reducing dose and toxicity, improve potency of the drug, and improve the drug's bioavailability.

In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical agent may include a pharmaceutical drug (a substance intended for use in the medical cure, treatment, prevention and/or diagnosis of health related condition). In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical agent is a nutritional agent (a preparation intended to supplement a diet and provide nutrients, such as, for example, vitamins, minerals, fiber, fatty acids, or amino acids, that may be missing or may not be consumed in sufficient quantity in a person's diet). In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical agent is a cosmetic agent (an agent used to treat, prevent, cosmetic related conditions). In some embodiments, the matrix carrier compositions for use in a delivery system are suitable for oral administration. In some embodiments, the matrix carrier compositions for use in a delivery system are suitable for parenteral administration. As used in the present specification, the following words and phrases are generally intended to have the meanings as set forth below, except to the extent that the context in which they are used indicates otherwise. As used herein, the terms “non-covalent interaction”, “non-covalent bond”, and “non-covalent forces” may be used interchangeably and refer to the interaction, also referenced as association, of a first substance and a second substance wherein a covalent bond is not formed between the two substances. Non-limiting, representative interactions are van der Waals interactions, hydrogen bonding, and electrostatic interactions (also called ionic bonding). As used herein, the terms “treating” and “treatment” with respect to a disease or condition, refer to taking steps to obtain beneficial or desired results, including but not limited to, alleviation or amelioration of one or more symptoms of the disease or condition, diminishment of extent of the disease or condition, prevention of the onset of the disease or condition, delay or slowing of progression, amelioration, palliation or stabilization of the disease or condition, partial or complete remission, prolonged survival and other beneficial results known in the art. As used herein, the term “pharmaceutical agent” is directed to any substance, molecule, and like, which may have an effect on one or more health and/or nutritional and/or cosmetic related conditions. In some embodiments, a pharmaceutical agent may include a “pharmaceutical drug” or a combination of pharmaceutical drugs. The term “pharmaceutical drug” (interchangeably referred to herein as “drug”) refers to a substance which may be intended for use in the medical cure, treatment, prevention and/or diagnosis of a health related condition (such as, for example, a disease). The term “pharmaceutical drug” is intended to include substances having pharmacological and/or pharmaceutical, and/or biological activity. In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical agent may include a nutritional agent or a combination of nutritional agents. The term “nutritional agent” refers to a substance intended to supplement a diet and provide nutrients, such as, for example, vitamins, minerals, fiber, fatty acids, or amino acids, that may be missing or may not be consumed in sufficient quantity in the diet. In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical agent may include a cosmetic agent or a combination of cosmetic agents. The term cosmetic agent refers to a substance used to treat and/or prevent, cosmetic related conditions. In some embodiments the pharmaceutical agent may include any combination of a pharmaceutical drug, a nutritional agent, and/or a cosmetic agent. As used herein, the terms “pharmaceutical composition”, “delivery system” and “pharmaceutical delivery system” may interchangeably by used. The terms refer to any applicable type of delivery system/pharmaceutical composition that may be used with the matrix carrier of the present disclosure to deliver a pharmaceutical agent (as defined herein). As used herein, “intimate mixture” refers to a physical mixture of at least two components which are in direct physical contact with each other. For example, one component may coat the other component or one component may adhere directly to the outer surface of the particle comprising the other component. Alternately, the material of one component may be intermingled or intertwined with the other component. As used herein, the term “potency” refers to the dose of pharmaceutical agent required to produce a specific effect of given intensity as compared to standard reference. Potency is a comparative rather than an absolute expression of the agent activity. Drug potency depends on various factors, such as one or more of bioavailability, targeting, lifetime in body fluid circulation and efficacy. As used herein, “ADME” is an acronym in pharmacokinetics and pharmacology for Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion of an administered pharmaceutical drug, and describes the disposition of a pharmaceutical drug (compound) within an organism. All four ADME criteria may influence the drug levels and kinetics of drug exposure to the tissues and hence may influence the performance and pharmacological activity of the compound as a drug. Absorption may determine the compound's bioavailability whereas the drug's half life is determined by its distribution, metabolism, and removal from the body via excretion. As used herein, the term “bioavailability” refers to the fraction of an administered dose of intact drug that reaches the systemic circulation. Bioavailability is largely determined by the properties of the dosage form, rather than by the pharmaceutical agent's physiochemical properties, which determine absorption potential. By definition, when a drug is administered intravenously (IV), its bioavailability is 100%. When a drug is orally administered, its bioavailability typically decreases. Age, gender, physical activity, genetic phenotype, stress, disorders (such as, for example, achlorhydria and malabsorption syndromes), previous GI surgery (eg, bariatric surgery), and the like, may also affect drug bioavailability. Chemical reactions that reduce absorption can reduce bioavailability. Such reactions include, for example, formation of a complex (for example between tetracycline and polyvalent metal ions), hydrolysis by gastric acid or digestive enzymes (for example, penicillin and chloramphenicol palmitate hydrolysis), conjugation in the intestinal wall (for example, sulfoconjugation of isoproterenol), adsorption to other drugs (for example, digoxin to cholestyramine), and metabolism by luminal microflora. As used herein, the term “half life” refers to the duration of action of a drug, i.e., the period of time required for the concentration or amount of drug in the body to be reduced by one-half. A drug molecule that leaves plasma may have one or more of several fates. For example, the drug molecule can be eliminated from the body by the kidneys or by the liver. The removal of a drug from the plasma is known as clearance, and the distribution of the drug in the various body tissues is known as the volume of distribution. Both of those pharmacokinetic parameters are related to the determination of the half life of a drug. “Branched” as used herein encompasses both biopolymers that are naturally branched and those engineered to be branched by at least one physical treatment, such as thermal and ultrasound treatments. “Branched” is also intended to encompass biopolymers wherein a substituent of a monomer subunit of the biopolymer is replaced by another covalently bonded chain of the biopolymer. In some embodiments, the branched biopolymer is crosslinked. In some embodiments, the branched biopolymer is not crosslinked. As used herein, the term “saccharide” refers to any simple carbohydrate including monosaccharides, monosaccharide derivatives, monosaccharide analogs, and sugars, including those which form the individual units in a polysaccharide. As used herein, the term “monosaccharide” refers to polyhydroxyaldehyde (aldose) or polyhdroxyketone (ketose) and non-polysaccharide derivatives and analogs thereof. As used herein, the term “polysaccharide” refers to polymers formed from about 500 to over 100,000 saccharide units linked to each other by hemiacetal or glycosidic bonds. The polysaccharide may be either straight chain, singly branched, or multiply branched wherein each branch may have additional secondary branches, and the monosaccharides may be standard D- or L-cyclic sugars in the pyranose (6-membered ring) or furanose (5-membered ring) forms such as D-fructose and D-galactose, respectively, or they may be cyclic sugar derivatives, for example amino sugars such as D-glucosamine, deoxy sugars such as D-fucose or L-rhamnose, sugar phosphates such as D-ribose-5-phosphate, sugar acids such as D-galacturonic acid, or multi-derivatized sugars such as N-acetyl-D-glucosamine, N-acetylneuraminic acid (sialic acid), or N-sulfato-D-glucosamine. When isolated from nature, polysaccharide preparations comprise molecules that are heterogeneous in molecular weight. Non-limiting examples of polysaccharides include, among other compounds, galactomanans and galactomannan derivatives; galacto-rhamnogalacturons and galacto-rhamnogalacturon derivatives, and galacto-arabinogalacturon and galacto-arabinogalacturon derivatives. As used herein, the term “beta-glucan” refers to those polysaccharides which comprise D-glucopyranosyl units which are linked together by (1→3) or (1→4) beta-linkages. Beta-Glucans occur naturally in many cereal grains such as oats and barley. The molecular weight of beta-glucan molecules occurring in cereals is, for example, from 200 to 2000 kDa. As used herein, the term “dextrin” refers to a low-molecular-weight carbohydrate produced by the hydrolysis of starch. In some embodiments, the term refers to a linear α-(1,4)-linked D-glucose polymer starting with an α-(1,6) bond or a mixture of same. Dextrins are widely commercially available and can be produced inter alia by digestion of branched amylopectin or glycogen with α-amylase. A non-limiting example of a dextrin is a maltodextrin. But there are many different types of dextrin known, and those different types can be used in other embodiments. As used herein, the term “fibrous polymer” refers to a polymer in the form of a network of discrete thread-shaped pieces. As used herein, the terms “fiber” and “dietary fiber” refer to compounds, including but not limited to indigestible residue, plant cell polysaccharides, and lignin, all of which are resistant to hydrolysis by human digestive enzymes. Non-limiting examples of fibers are members selected from guar gum, pectin, fructo-oligosaccharides and derivatives thereof. Small amounts of other indigestible compounds, such as phytates, tannins, saponins and cutin, may be included in dietary fiber since these compounds are indigestible and associated with dietary fiber polysaccharides. As used herein, “silica” refers to silicon dioxide. Silica is widely recognized as a safe food additive (Thirteenth report of the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives, FAO Nutrition Meetings Report Series; from the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives meeting in Rome, May 27-Jun. 4, 1969). As used herein, the term “silicate” refers to a compound containing silicon and oxygen, e.g. in tetrahedral units of SiO4. In other embodiments, the term refers to a compound containing an anion in which at least one central silicon atom is surrounded by electronegative ligands. Non-limiting, representative examples of silicates are hexafluorosilicate, sodium silicate (Na2SiO3), aluminum silicates, and magnesium silicates. As used herein, the term “wax” means a lipophilic compound, which is solid at room temperature (25° C.), with a reversible solid/liquid change of state, having a melting point of greater than or equal to 30° C., which may be up to 120° C. In some embodiments, the present invention provides a matrix carrier composition, which includes pharmacologically inert nanoparticles, in non-covalent association with a biopolymer and a lipid comprising non-polar and polar bonds, with pharmaceutical agent, wherein the inert nanoparticles include silica nanoparticles, and wherein the diameter of the nanoparticles is between 1-1000 nanometers, and wherein the biopolymer includes a combination of branched and non-branched biopolymers, and wherein the lipid includes a mix of the synthetic and/or natural saturated and unsaturated fatty acids which associated with nanoparticles, biopolymer or carbohydrate and including pharmaceutical agent and in some embodiments enhancer and or targeting agent. Each possibility represents a separate embodiment of the present invention. In some embodiments, the present invention provides a matrix carrier composition, comprising pharmacologically inert nanoparticles, in non-covalent association with a biopolymer, wherein the inert nanoparticles includes silica nanoparticles, and wherein the diameter of the nanoparticles is between 1-1000 nanometers, and the nanoparticle-biopolymer complex is associated with the oil, and wherein the particle diameter of the matrix carrier composition is between 100-500,000 nanometers (nm). In certain preferred embodiments, the particle diameter of the matrix carrier composition is between 100-50,000 nm. In another embodiment, the oil phase of the matrix carrier composition comprises a plurality of oils. Each possibility represents a separate embodiment of the present invention. In another embodiment, the matrix carrier composition is held together by non-covalent forces. In another embodiment, without wishing to be bound by any theory or mechanism of action, the non-covalent forces between the components of the matrix composition enable the matrix composition to self-assemble when the components are mixed together, as described herein. In another embodiment, without wishing to be bound by any theory or mechanism of action, the matrix carrier includes two solid phases containing at least two solid pharmacologically inert materials (nanoparticles and biopolymers) with different properties. In another embodiment, the non-covalent forces cause the nanoparticles and biopolymer to form a mixture. In another embodiment, the matrix composition exhibits an ordered, fractal structure. Each possibility represents a separate embodiment of the present invention. The structure and composition of the matrix carrier may allow the use of the matrix carrier in various administration routes, such as, for example by oral administration, by parenteral routes, topical, and the like. In another embodiment, without wishing to be bound by any theory or mechanism of action, the energy of non-covalent bonds between a pharmaceutical agent and the matrix carrier may be less than about 10 kcal per mole (such as in the range of about 1 to 5 kcal per mole). This value is higher than the energy of thermal fluctuations at 37° C. (about 0.615 kcal per mole), which is enough for keeping or protection the pharmaceutical agent in gastro-intestinal tract. This energy is relatively close, for example, to the bond energy between insulin and its receptor. This may provide a possible control of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the pharmaceutical agent. In some embodiments, the matrix carrier may provide protection from biodegradation of the pharmaceutical agent at 37° C. in the stomach (acid solution of pepsin and other enzymes) and small intestine (neutral solution of the pancreatic enzymes, bile acids salts, etc) for more than 8 hours. In some embodiments, the matrix carrier may release the pharmaceutical agents due to action of synthetic surfactants (such as, for example, TWEEN 20, TWEEN 80, and the like) or natural surfactants of body fluids (such as, for example, blood, lymph, interstitial fluid, and the like). In another embodiment, the nanoparticle-biopolymer complex is dispersed within the oil phase of the matrix composition. In another embodiment, the oil phase is impregnated with the nanoparticle-biopolymer complex of the matrix composition. As provided herein, the present invention provides compositions wherein the nanoparticles and biopolymer form a matrix that is impregnated and completely surrounded by the oil phase. Each possibility represents a separate embodiment of the present invention. Oil having particulate matter associated therewith refers to particulate matter that is in contact with oil. For example “associated with” may include embedded, dispersed, immersed, suspended, and the like, within the oil. The composition as a whole need not be homogeneous with regard to the distribution of the particulate matter. Rather, the particulate matter is capable of being embedded, dispersed, immersed, suspended, and the like, in the oil when agitated. The particulate matter need not be completely homogeneous, but rather is characterized by its containing the ingredients specified herein and its contact with the oil of the present invention. Compositions wherein the particulate matter is agglomerated fall within the scope of the present invention The Matrix Carrier Composition According to some embodiments, there is provided a matrix carrier composition for use in a pharmaceutical composition for administration, comprising an intermolecular association of at least one biopolymer, nanoparticles, and at least one oil. Administration may include various administration routes, such as, for example, but not limited to: oral administration, parenteral administration, topical administration, and the like. That intermolecular association may take place spontaneously and result in the formation of stable structures. The course of that association process, and properties of the resulting product, may depend upon the nature of the components and/or upon the conditions under which the association takes place. According to some embodiments, the volume ratio between the first solid phase and the volume of the second solid phase may be at a desired ratio so as to optimize the protecting properties of the matrix carrier. The ratio of the volume of the first solid phase and the volume of the second solid phase may be determined according to the speed of sound (c) of each solid phase as following: Speed of sound (c) in the material is a function of its density: [in-line-formulae]c=√C/ρ; [/in-line-formulae] Wherein c—is Speed of sound; C—coefficient of stiffness; ρ—density The Second and First Solid phase volume ratio may thus be calculated according to the following equation (equation 1): [in-line-formulae]V1×c1<V2×c2 (Equation 1);[/in-line-formulae] wherein V1—volume of the First Solid Phase; c1—Speed of Sound in the First Solid Phase; V2—volume of the Second Solid Phase; c2—Speed of Sound in the Second Solid Phase. In some embodiments, that intermolecular association comprises a network of non-covalent interactions between the at least one biopolymer, the nanoparticles, and the at least one oil. That is, the recited components may be held together by non-covalent forces. In some embodiments, without wishing to be bound by any theory or mechanism of action, the non-covalent forces enable the components to self-assemble when the components are blended together. In some embodiments, again without wishing to be bound by any theory or mechanism of action, the non-covalent forces cause the nanoparticles and biopolymer to form an intimate mixture. In some embodiments, again without wishing to be bound by any theory or mechanism of action, the association results in an ordered, fractal structure.

For example, silanol groups can be substituted with hydrophobic groups to obtain a hydrophobic silica. The hydrophobic groups can be: trimethylsiloxy groups, which are obtained, for example, by treatment of fumed silica in the presence of hexamethyldisilazane. Silicas thus treated are known as “silica silylate” according to the CTFA (6th edition, 1995). They are sold, for example, under the references “Aerosil R812®” by the company Degussa and “CAB-OSIL TS-530®” by the company Cabot; dimethylsilyloxy or polydimethylsiloxane groups, which are obtained, for example, by treatment of fumed silica in the presence of polydimethylsiloxane or dimethyldichlorosilane. Silicas thus treated are known as “silica dimethyl silylate” according to the CTFA (6th edition, 1995). They are sold, for example, under the references “Aerosil R972®.”, “Aerosil R974®” by the company Degussa, “CAB-O-SIL TS-610®.” and “CAB-O-SIL TS-720®”, by the company Cabot.

In some embodiments, the method of manufacturing the pharmaceutical compositions comprises the steps of: (a) providing a matrix carrier composition;(b) mixing at least one pharmaceutical agent with at least one oil; and(c) combining the matrix carrier composition with the mixture of the pharmaceutical agent with the at least one oil. In some embodiments, the method of manufacturing the pharmaceutical compositions comprises the steps of: (a) mixing nanoparticles with at least one biopolymer;(b) mixing at least one pharmaceutical agent with at least one oil; and(c) combining the mixture of nanoparticles and the at least one biopolymer with the mixture of the pharmaceutical agent with the at least one oil. In some embodiments, the method of manufacturing the pharmaceutical compositions comprises the steps of: (a) mixing at least one biopolymer with at least one oil;(b) mixing nanoparticles with at least one oil;(c) combining the mixture of nanoparticles and the at least one biopolymer with the mixture of the pharmaceutical agent with the at least one oil. In some embodiments, the methods of manufacturing the pharmaceutical compositions described herein further comprise: Formulating the pharmaceutical composition a form suitable for oral delivery. It is within the knowledge of a skilled artisan that the order of mixing and the order of addition of the individual components can be modified to meet any specific needs. In some embodiments, inert gas, such as, for example, N2 or CO2, may be used in the manufacturing process, to prevent oxidation of the at least one oil (or one or more other components) during the manufacturing process. The manufacturing process may be conducted in a closed reactor having an internal impeller. In this reactor, N2 and/or CO2 may be supplied. In some embodiments, a high shear mixer is used. In some embodiments, other means suitable for generating a homogenous formulation, as defined above, from the nanoparticles and the at least one biopolymer is used. In some embodiments, the method further comprises suspending the matrix carrier composition in at least one oil until homogenous distribution, as defined above, of the solid phase is achieved using the airlift or boiling layer technologies. The oil used in preparing the suspension may be the same as or different from the at least one oil used in preparing the matrix carrier composition. The airlift technology involves the insertion of gas bubbles into a liquid composition. The bubble flow efficiently mixes the liquids and/or suspensions and may facilitate particle interaction and/or adsorption. Specifically, the bubble surface adsorbs the different particles and generates shock waves during bubble destruction. This gas “boiling layer” forms flying micro-drops and/or particles in the arising flow of the gas above the liquid surface. Micro-drops may be created by sprinkler with or without an ultrasound transducer. The boiling layer improves the interaction of the particles and the liquid (oil) drops due to increased frequency and energy of collisions. In some embodiments, the biopolymer may undergo dry milling/grounding before use. In some embodiments, decreasing the particle size of the biopolymer (e.g., in order to improve homogeneity) to sizes of, for example, less than 10 μm may be achieved by homogenization of the biopolymer in the at least one oil prior to addition of the nanoparticles. In some embodiments, vacuum methods may be used to remove moisture and air from the biopolymer and/or lyophilized pharmaceutical agent mix (in oil or without oil). In some embodiments, in order to improve adsorption, the biopolymer and nanoparticles surface is released from air micro-bubbles and small water droplets. This may be achieved by vacuum drying and gas removal or/and drying by passing of drying agent (such as, for example, gases like N2, CO2, He or other inert gases) through the mix. Gas removal may also be performed by centrifugation or/and deep vacuum. In some embodiments, the method of manufacturing a matrix carrier composition further comprises the step of adding additional oil following the addition of the at least one oil. The term “additional oil” encompasses an oil or mixture of oils, as described elsewhere herein. In some embodiments, the additional oil, oil or mixture of oils has a higher viscosity than the first-added oil or mixture of oils. In some embodiments, without wishing to be bound by any theory or mechanism of action, the use of a higher viscosity oil or oil mixture at this stage can enable formation of ordered structures in the composition. In some embodiments, the method of manufacturing a matrix carrier composition further comprises the step of adding a third oil or mixture of oils after addition of the above-described at least one oil. In some embodiments, the at least one oil comprises at least one wax. In some embodiments, the at least one wax is heated. In some embodiments, the at least one wax is pulverized. In some embodiments, the at least one wax is both heated and pulverized. In some embodiments, the heating and/or pulverization are performed prior to blending with the other components. In some embodiments, the at least one wax remains hot while blending with the other components begins. In some embodiments, the heating and/or pulverization are performed during blending with the other components. In some embodiments, the heating and/or pulverization are performed both prior to and during blending with the other components. In some embodiments, wax may further be used as an additional stabilizing rheological component. Wax has no hydrophilic surface and has internal energy which is lower than the internal energy of polysaccharides and silica. Low internal energy of wax is related to the low melting point of wax. High melting point may deactivate/denaturate the pharmaceutical agent during the manufacturing process of the composition. To this aim, eutectic mix with lower melting temperature between may be prepared by premixing the wax with additional wax or oil having high thermal stability. Use of the eutectic mix of wax and oil with the pharmaceutical agent mix, while mixing gently (for example, at about 2000-2500 rpm), enables cooling of eutectic mix and thus a solid and a liquid disperse phases are formed. Such a process may further enable the formation of small solid wax droplets. Without wishing to be bound by any theory of mechanism of action, when such small solid fat droplet are formed, then these droplets, after administration, will not be digested by lipases and would go to feces, and hence the effective ratio of the anti-cancer reagent penetration will be increased relatively to liquid composition without wax and the additional solid phase. The choice of type of wax with a desired predetermined melting point and its final concentration as well as method of its insertion in the formulation enables the to regulate the dispersion as well as stability and consistence of the final formulation. The oil or mixture of oils used for each pharmaceutical agent may be the same or different. In some embodiments, two or more different pharmaceutical agents may be combined within a single mixture of nanoparticles associated with the biopolymer and then mixed with the oil components. In some embodiments two or more pharmaceutical agents may be individually combined with the nanoparticles associated with the biopolymer and then these individual mixtures may be further mixed together with the oil components. In some embodiments, the step of mixing a pharmaceutical agent with at least one oil comprises the step of directly dissolving the pharmaceutical agent into the at least one oil. In some embodiments, a solution of the pharmaceutical agent in a solvent, such as water, is mixed with the at least one oil and the solvent is then removed. In some embodiments a solution of the pharmaceutical agent may be lyophilized previously to being added to oil. In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical agent forms a suspension when mixed with the at least one oil. In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical agent is dissolved in the at least one oil. In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical agent is mixed with the at least one oil in the presence of an alcohol. In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical agent is mixed with the at least one oil in the presence of polyethylene glycol present. In some embodiments the polyethylene glycol has a molecular weight in the 200-8000 dalton range. In some embodiments the pharmaceutical agent is mixed with the at least one oil in the presence of perfluorocarbon. In some embodiments the perfluorocarbon is a liquid at room temperature. In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical agent is mixed with the at least one oil under anhydrous conditions. In some embodiments, moisture is present. In some embodiments, an aqueous solution of the pharmaceutical agent is mixed with the at least one oil. In some embodiments the pharmaceutical agent may be dissolved in oil and stay there for 10-48 hours or more previously to formulation preparation. In some embodiments, a combination of several pharmaceutical agents may be formulated into one formulation. In some embodiments, preparation of particulate matter comprising each pharmaceutical agent is done separately and at the last step, the separate particulate matters are put together without additional mixing. Several technologies may be used to prevent comparative adsorption of the pharmaceutical agents on the solid phase as well as chemical interaction between them: the pharmaceutical agents are each formulated in a jell (non liquid formulation) or with any bio-available solidifications; the pharmaceutical agent formulations may be prepared as a mix of small drops or particles from practically solid materials (at room temperature) and/or suspension in liquid lipid phase of solid or semi-solid balls and/or pieces with pharmaceutical agents. In some embodiments, the formulation method of pharmaceutical agents including association of the pharmaceutical agents with the biopolymer and/or nanoparticle may be performed, for example, by the “Sandwich” technology (the “sandwich” technology provides a formation of multilayer structure which consists of consequently adsorbed components. Thus, the process provides sequential spatial and temporal adsorption with predetermined properties) Exposure may be performed for 30 min-72 hours depending on the pharmaceutical agent and the therapy needs (which may effect PK and PD). Further mixing with other ingredients may be preformed, for example: for preliminary adsorption 0 to 100% of nanoparticles or biopolymers may be used, according to required PK and PD. Adsorption activity of nanoparticles and/or biopolymers may be achieved by preliminary treatment in homogenizer and/or by ultra-sound. For some pharmaceutical agents, colloidal metals, such as, for example, Zn, Cu, Fe, and the like, may be used as structure forming element. Controlled electrolysis with further lyophilization or vacuum drying may be used to implement the colloidal metals in the formulation. Also provided are products of the manufacturing processes described herein. According to further embodiments, and as shown in Example 7, in order to extract the pharmaceutical agent from the matrix carrier composition into a solution, an extracting procedure should be used. The use of such extraction procedures is indicative that the pharmaceutical agent is held in the matrix carrier in a complex by non-covalent forces and therefore the use of an organic solvent and surfactant are necessary in order to extract said agent from the matrix. While a number of exemplary aspects and embodiments have been discussed above, those of skill in the art will recognize certain modifications, permutations, additions and sub-combinations thereof. It is therefore intended that the following appended claims and claims hereafter introduced be interpreted to include all such modifications, permutations, additions and sub-combinations as are within their true spirit and scope.

The maturation of the material may be achieved by maintaining under controlled temperature (in the range of 1-25° C.), for 1-72 hours. The maturation may increase viscosity and energy of binding matrix-carrier with the pharmaceutical agent. Example 6 Analysis and Comparison of Insulin within or without the Matrix Carrier LC/MS stability analysis of insulin samples was performed in order to evaluate insulin stability within or without the Matrix Carrier Formulation at different time points (0, 2 weeks, 1 month and 3 months) during storage at 4-5° C. Insulin Bulk row material without the Matrix Carrier Formulation was stored in glass vials. Insulin within the Matrix Carrier Formulation, which composition is detailed in the Example 7, was capsulated into gelatin capsules (Capsugel, size 00). In order to perform HPLC and LC/MS analysis, the samples followed similar extraction procedure as detailed in Example 7 below. FIG. 1, panel A demonstrate the LC/MS of raw bulk insulin (that is, insulin not within the matrix carrier) after 3 month of storage at 4-5°. FIG. 1, panel B demonstrate the LC/MS of insulin extracted from Matrix Carrier Formulation, after 3 month of storage at 4-5°. Comparison of the LC/MS spectrums of FIG. 1 panels A and B show that the two spectrums are similar. The results suggest that the Matrix Carrier Formulation does not reduce the stability of the pharmaceutical agent and that the bounds between the pharmaceutical agent (Insulin) and the Matrix Carrier are not covalent.

Similar results were repeated for Insulin as a pharmaceutical agent in the matrix carrier composition formulation. Furthermore, the Insulin formulation was tested by incubation with intestinal enzymes mix at 37° C. for various time lengths up to 16 hours. The results show no degradation of Insulin. Additional experiments were performed for dissolution of the Insulin formulation by incubation at 37° C. in different mediums such as: pure water, saline, acidic solution with pepsine, fetal porcine serum and saline with 2.5% TWEEN 20. The matrix carrier decomposition was mainly observed in mediums that contain synthetic or natural blood surfactants such as, for example, Tween 20 or serum. Example 8 Injection of Matrix Carrier Composition Comprising Insulin as Compared to Standard Insulin Injection The following Insulin formulations were used: Formulation I—Standard Insulin Formulation Injection of insulin in PBS, 50 IU—Human recombinant Insulin in lyophilized form was dissolved in phosphate buffer at a concentration 50 IU/ml. Formulation II—Matrix Carrier Composition The matrix carrier composition with Insulin formulation, 50 IU—The composition for the formulation is detailed in Example 7, above. Experimental Details The study included 8 animals (rats) in each group. Blood samples were withdrawn under halothan anesthesia from the rat tail. Blood glucose levels were measured from each blood samples by FreeStyle glucose meter, Abbott. After withdrawn, blood samples were kept in ice and then centrifuged at 3500 rpm, 4C for plasma separation. Insulin level in rat plasma was measured by Human Insulin ELISA kit (Millipore kit (Cat. # EZHI-14K). After the withdrawal of the first blood sample, rats were injected with Formulation I (insulin alone, 50 IU) or Formulation II (same Insulin within the matrix carrier composition, 50 IU). Additional blood samples were taken at time intervals after the injection: 3 hours, 6 hours, 9 hours, 12 hours and 24 hours. The results, illustrated in FIG. 2A show that blood glucose levels were reduced after injection of Formulation II, as compared to the standard insulin injection (Formulation I). In addition, the results illustrated in FIG. 2B show that plasma concentration of the injected human insulin in the rats (measured by Human Insulin ELISA Millipore kit (Cat. # EZHI-14K), is still high after 25 hours if the rats were injected with Formulation II, as compared to the standard insulin formulation injection (Formulation I). 1-60.
