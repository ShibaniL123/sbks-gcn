The present invention relates to novel double-walled capsules obtained by coacervation without the use of a crosslinking agent and to the process for obtaining same, and also to the use of these capsules for preparing cosmetic compositions. Coacervation describes the phenomenon of desolvation of macromolecules, such as polymers, resulting in a phase separation within a solution. Simple coacervation relates to processes involving the desolvation of a single polymer through one of the following factors: decrease in temperature, addition of a non-solvent, addition of electrolytes, addition of a second incompatible polymer. When the simultaneous desolvation of two water-soluble polyelectrolytes bearing opposite charges is caused by a modification of the pH of the aqueous medium, the term complex coacervation is used. Complex coacervation is a well-known encapsulation technique which has been industrialized since the 1950s. It makes it possible to encapsulate water-insoluble ingredients. U.S. Pat. No. 2,800,457 of Jul. 23, 1957, describes for example the process for encapsulating oils in a coacervate of two organic polymers: gelatin and gum arabic. Canadian patent CA88263 of Oct. 5, 1971, describes a similar process using an organic polymer and an inorganic polymer. The process for producing microcapsules by this technique is generally carried out in five successive steps. In a first step, the product to be encapsulated (in liquid or solid form, pure or in oily solution) is dispersed in an aqueous solution containing two polymers having opposite charges (step a). In a second step, the coacervation is induced by adjusting the pH of the solution, such that the positive charges of the first polymer cancel out the negative charges of the second (step b). The electrostatic attraction of the two polyelectrolytes causes the appearance of a mixed coacervate. In a third step, the coacervate droplets formed are adsorbed (step c) at the surface of the active material to be encapsulated and form a continuous coating (step d). In the fourth step, this coating is consolidated by crosslinking (step e) of the constituent macromolecules of the coacervate so as to form stable microcapsules. Finally, the microcapsules are separated from the reaction medium by settling out and filtration, before undergoing washing or purifying operations in order to remove the unreacted products, in particular the excess crosslinking agents, and optionally drying operations. Among the organic macromolecules or polymers of cationic nature that can be used in the coacervation technique, mention may be made, in a nonlimiting manner, of animal proteins such as pig or fish gelatin, albumin, vegetable proteins derived, for example, from soya, from potato or from wheat, chitosan and its derivatives, synthetic polymers resulting from the combining of amino acids, such as polylysine, or else polymers of vegetable origin such as guar gum and its derivatives. Among the anionic organic polymers that may be used are natural polymers, such as gum arabic, alginates, carrageenates, cellulose derivatives such as carboxymethylcellulose, starch derivatives such as carboxymethyl starch, or synthetic polymers, such as acrylic, methacrylic, polylactic or polyglycolic polymers, or combinations thereof. The ingredients encapsulated may be cosmetic active ingredients such as sunscreens, essential oils, vitamins A, D or E or their derivatives, or lipoamino acids. In order to obtain capsules which are sufficiently mechanically strong, the crosslinking of step (e) is essential. This operation involves a crosslinking agent. Among the most effective crosslinking agents, mention may be made of formaldehyde or glutaraldehyde. Other crosslinking agents have also been proposed, such as carbodiimides, isocyanates (HDI or hexamethylene diisocyanate, TDI or toluene diisocyanate, IPDI or isopropyl diisocyanate), proanthocyanidins, etc. All these ingredients either have a not insignificant toxicity or are unstable in an aqueous medium and must be used under conditions which complicate the crosslinking step. Other authors have described cross-linking processes with enzymes, such as transglutaminases, or genepin. The costs of these products are such that only a few applications with very strong added values can be envisioned. A crosslinking agent is a chemical compound which makes it possible to link one polymer chain to another via the formation of covalent bonds. In the prior art, it involves in particular a reaction between the aldehyde functions of the crosslinking agent and the residual amine functions of proteins, in particular with the amine functions of lysine units so as to form —N═CH-covalent bonds. Glutaraldehyde is the crosslinking agent most commonly used. It is effective and inexpensive. However, it must be used at high doses, in the region of 1 to 5 mol/kg of gelatin (i.e. 100 to 500 g/kg of protein) and has a not insignificant toxicity both for the handler and for the user. Elimination of the excess glutaraldehyde is essential, in particular for all pharmaceutical, food or cosmetic applications; it requires numerous successive washes which consume water and are time consuming in order to obtain microcapsules containing an acceptable residual level of glutaraldehyde, below about one hundred ppm. A first problem to be solved for the inventors of the present invention is therefore that of producing sufficiently strong microcapsules by means of a complex coacervation technique which does not use a crosslinking agent. Given the very principle of the coacervation process, only lipophilic active agents, which are insoluble in water, may be incorporated into the microcapsules obtained by this technique. This undoubtedly constitutes a limitation of the process while a very large number of water-soluble ingredients must also be incorporated into the microcapsules. An object of the invention is therefore to develop an improved coacervation technique, without the use of toxic or expensive crosslinking agents, which makes it possible to encapsulate both water-soluble and water-insoluble ingredients. Other techniques have been described for encapsulating water-soluble ingredients, such as, for example, granulation by means of hydrophilic polymers, emulsification in oils in the form of water-in-oil emulsions, or absorption on ion exchange resins so as to form resinates. One of the techniques most widely used for encapsulating water-soluble ingredients remains incorporation into microbeads of water-soluble polymers such as chitosans, polyvinyl alcohols or alginates. Said polymers are used in numerous pharmaceutical or food applications for obtaining microbeads by means of a simple coacervation process, also called dripping. By way of example, the description of such a process for encapsulating cells will be found in patent application WO 91/09119 of Jun. 27, 1991. Dripping consists in preparing an aqueous solution containing the water-soluble ingredient to be encapsulated and a polymer such as sodium alginate. This solution is pressurized through calibrated nozzles so as to form drops collected in an aqueous solution of divalent salts such as calcium chloride, magnesium chloride or manganese chloride. The calcium ions react with the sodium alginate so as to immediately form insoluble solid beads of calcium alginate. The beads obtained are separated by filtration or sieving and then generally washed with water so as to remove the excess calcium chloride. In this context, the inventors of the present invention have developed novel double-walled capsules that may contain a lipophilic active agent in the primary capsules and optionally a hydrophilic active agent included in the second with a coacervation process without chemical crosslinking. These original microcapsules consist of a lipophilic core surrounded by a first layer of polymer coacervate and a second layer comprising a hydrogel. They possess good tensile strength performance levels and stand out more particularly by virtue of their non-toxicity since no toxic crosslinking agent is used. They can also be modulated since it is possible to envision encapsulating both a lipophilic active agent in the core and a hydrophilic active agent in a hydrogel matrix. They may be provided either in wet form or in dry form with a reasonable cost price. Thus, a subject of the invention is a process for preparing double-walled capsules comprising the following steps: step a) dispersion of a lipophilic active ingredient in an aqueous solution, said solution containing at least one anionic polymer and at least one cationic polymer; step b) adjustment of the pH of the solution obtained in step a) so that the positive charges of the cationic polymer cancel out the negative charges of the anionic polymer in order to induce a coacervation; step c) adsorption of the coacervate droplets resulting from step b) at the surface of the active ingredient so as to form capsules; step d) introduction of a solution of anionic polymers into the reaction medium containing the capsules obtained in step c); step e) introduction of the mixture resulting from step d) into a means for forming drops; step f) mixing of the drops resulting from step e) with a solution of divalent salts and formation of the double-walled capsules; characterized in that no crosslinking agent is used.

They may also be resuspended in an appropriate solution for being stored, transported and used in liquid form.
