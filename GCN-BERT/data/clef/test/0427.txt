FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to therapeutic conjugates with improved ability to target various cancer cells, infectious disease organisms and for treating autoimmune diseases, which conjugates contain a targeting moiety and a therapeutic moiety. The targeting and therapeutic moieties are linked via an intracellularly cleavable linkage that increases therapeutic efficacy. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION For many years it has been an aim of scientists in the field of specifically targeted drug therapy to use monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for the specific delivery of toxic agents to human cancers. Conjugates of tumor-associated mAbs and suitable toxic agents have been developed, but have had mixed success in the therapy of cancer, and virtually no application in other diseases. The toxic agent is most commonly a chemotherapy drug, although particle-emitting radionuclides, or bacterial or plant toxins have also been conjugated to mAbs. The advantages of using mAb-chemotherapy drug conjugates are that (a) the chemotherapy drug itself is structurally well defined; (b) the chemotherapy drug is linked to the mAb protein using very well defined conjugation chemistries, often at specific sites remote from the mAbs antigen binding regions; (c) mAb-chemotherapy drug conjugates can be made more reproducibly than chemical conjugates involving mAbs and bacterial or plant toxins, and as such are more amenable to commercial development and regulatory approval; and (d) the mAb-chemotherapy drug conjugates are orders of magnitude less toxic than radionuclide mAb conjugates. Relevant early work on mAb-chemotherapy drug conjugates found during in vitro and in vivo preclinical testing that the chemical linkages used often resulted in the loss of a drug's potency. These results indicated that a drug ideally needed to be released in its original form, once it had been internalized into a target cell, for the mAb-chemotherapy drug conjugate to be a useful therapeutic. Accordingly, work during the 1980's and early 1990's focused largely on the nature of the chemical linker between the chemotherapeutic drug and the mAb. Notably, mAb-chemotherapy drug conjugates prepared using mild acid-cleavable linkers were developed, based on the observation that the pH inside tumors was often lower than normal physiological pH (U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,542,225; 4,569,789; 4,618,492; and 4,952,394). This approach culminated in a landmark paper by Trail et al. (Science 261:212-215 (1993)) which showed that mAb-doxorubicin (DOX) conjugates, prepared with appropriate linkers, could be used to cure mice bearing a variety of human tumor xenografts, in preclinical studies. This promising result was achieved with an antibody that bound to a very large number of receptors on the tumor cells being targeted, and the mAb-chemotherapy drug conjugate was substituted with six to eight DOX residues per unit of mAb. Further, the mAb-chemotherapy drug conjugate was given in massive doses on a repeated dosage schedule. During the development of the aforementioned mAb-chemotherapy drug conjugates, the linker between the chemotherapeutic drug and the mAb was thought to be critical for retention of good anti-tumor activity both in vitro and in vivo. In some cases, the mAb-chemotherapy drug conjugates were made with acid-labile (e.g., hydrazone) and reductively labile (e.g., disulfide) bonds between the chemotherapy drugs and the mAb. While the hydrazone bond is apparently stable to in vivo serum conditions, normal disulfide bonds were found to be not stable enough for practical use. Accordingly, mAb-chemotherapy drug conjugates were developed that replaced a standard disulfide linkage with a hindered geminal dimethyl disulfide linkage or a methyl disulfide linkage. Other work in the field has focused on the use of a hydrazone as the cleavable moiety and a thioether group instead of a disulfide linkage. Willner et al. have found superior results by incorporating a hydrazone as a cleavable unit, and attaching DOX to a mAb via a thioether group, instead of a disulfide (U.S. Pat. No. 5,708,146). When linked in such a manner, and using a branched linker capable of doubling the number of DOX units per mAb substitution site, an approximate order of magnitude increase in the efficacy of the new DOX-mAb conjugates was obtained (King et al., Bioconjugate Chem. 10:279-288 (1999)). Another cleavable moiety that has been explored is an ester linkage incorporated into the linker between the antibody and the chemotherapy drug. Gillimard and Saragovi have found that when an ester of paclitaxel was conjugated to anti-rat p75 mAb, MC192, or anti-human TrkA mAb, 5C3, the conjugate was found to exhibit target specific-toxicity. Gillimard and Saragovi, Cancer Res. 61:694-699 (2001). Realizing the importance of the linkers in the construction of mAb-chemotherapy drug conjugates, the inventors have developed novel linkers which may be used generally with a variety of chemotherapeutic drugs and other toxic agents. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In one embodiment, the invention relates to an immunoconjugate comprising: (a) a targeting moiety; (b) a chemotherapeutic moiety; and (c) a linker binding to the targeting moiety via a thiol group, and to the chemotherapeutic moiety via an intracellularly-cleavable moiety other than a hydrazone. In another embodiment, the invention relates to an immunoconjugate comprising: (a) targeting moiety; (b) a chemotherapeutic moiety; and (c) a linker binding to the targeting moiety via a thiol group, and to the chemotherapeutic moiety via an intracellularly-cleavable moiety other than a hydrazone; wherein said linker comprises an amino acid moiety and a thiol-reactive moiety and is linked to the chemotherapeutic moiety via the amino acid moiety and to the targeting moiety via the thiol-reactive moiety. Another embodiment of the invention is a method of treating cancer, a malignancy, an autoimmune disease, an infection, or an infectious lesion with the immunoconjugates described herein. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS Unless otherwise specified, “a” or “an” means “one or more.” In the description that follows, a number of terms are used and the following definitions are provided to facilitate understanding of the present invention. An antibody, as described herein, refers to a full-length (i.e., naturally occurring or formed by normal immunoglobulin gene fragment recombinatorial processes) immunoglobulin molecule (e.g., an IgG antibody) or an immunologically active (i.e., specifically binding) portion of an immunoglobulin molecule, like an antibody fragment. An antibody fragment is a portion of an antibody such as F(ab′)2, F(ab)2, Fab′, Fab, Fv, scFv (single chain Fv) and the like. Regardless of structure, an antibody fragment binds with the same antigen that is recognized by the intact antibody. The term “antibody fragment” also includes any synthetic or genetically engineered protein that acts like an antibody by binding to a specific antigen to form a complex. For example, antibody fragments include isolated fragments consisting of the variable regions, such as the “Fv” fragments consisting of the variable regions of the heavy and light chains, recombinant single chain polypeptide molecules in which light and heavy variable regions are connected by a peptide linker (“scFv proteins”), and minimal recognition units consisting of the amino acid residues that mimic the hypervariable region. The Fv fragments may be constructed in different ways as to yield multivalent and/or multispecific binding forms. In the former case of multivalent, they react with more than one binding site against the specific epitope, whereas with multispecific forms, more than one epitope (either of the antigen or even against the specific antigen and a different antigen) is bound. As used herein, the term antibody component includes both an entire antibody, a fusion protein, and fragments thereof. A naked antibody is generally an entire antibody which is not conjugated to a therapeutic agent. This is so because the Fc portion of the antibody molecule provides effector or immunological functions, such as complement fixation and ADCC (antibody dependent cell cytotoxicity), which set mechanisms into action that may result in cell lysis. However, the Fc portion may not be required for therapeutic function of the antibody, but rather other mechanisms, such as apoptosis, anti-angiogenesis, anti-metastatic activity, anti-adhesion activity, such as inhibition of heterotypic or homotypic adhesion, and interference in signaling pathways, may come into play and interfere with the disease progression. Naked antibodies include both polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies, and fragments thereof, that include murine antibodies, as well as certain recombinant antibodies, such as chimeric, humanized or human antibodies and fragments thereof. As defined in the present invention, “naked” is synonymous with “unconjugated,” and means not linked or conjugated to the therapeutic agent with which it administered. A chimeric antibody is a recombinant protein that contains the variable domains of both the heavy and light antibody chains, including the complementarity determining regions (CDRs) of an antibody derived from one species, preferably a rodent antibody, while the constant domains of the antibody molecule are derived from those of a human antibody. For veterinary applications, the constant domains of the chimeric antibody may be derived from that of other species, such as a cat or dog. A humanized antibody is a recombinant protein in which the CDRs from an antibody from one species; e.g., a rodent antibody, is transferred from the heavy and light variable chains of the rodent antibody into human heavy and light variable domains. The constant domains of the antibody molecule is derived from those of a human antibody. A human antibody is an antibody obtained from transgenic mice that have been “engineered” to produce specific human antibodies in response to antigenic challenge. In this technique, elements of the human heavy and light chain locus are introduced into strains of mice derived from embryonic stem cell lines that contain targeted disruptions of the endogenous heavy chain and light chain loci. The transgenic mice can synthesize human antibodies specific for human antigens, and the mice can be used to produce human antibody-secreting hybridomas. Methods for obtaining human antibodies from transgenic mice are described by Green et al., Nature Genet. 7:13 (1994), Lonberg et al., Nature 368:856 (1994), and Taylor et al., Int. Immun. 6:579 (1994). A fully human antibody also can be constructed by genetic or chromosomal transfection methods, as well as phage display technology, all of which are known in the art. See for example, McCafferty et al., Nature 348:552-553 (1990) for the production of human antibodies and fragments thereof in vitro, from immunoglobulin variable domain gene repertoires from unimmunized donors. In this technique, antibody variable domain genes are cloned in-frame into either a major or minor coat protein gene of a filamentous bacteriophage, and displayed as functional antibody fragments on the surface of the phage particle. Because the filamentous particle contains a single-stranded DNA copy of the phage genome, selections based on the functional properties of the antibody also result in selection of the gene encoding the antibody exhibiting those properties. In this way, the phage mimics some of the properties of the B cell. Phage display can be performed in a variety of formats, for their review, see e.g. Johnson and Chiswell, Current Opinion in Structural Biology 3:5564-571 (1993). Human antibodies may also be generated by in vitro activated B cells. See U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,567,610 and 5,229,275, which are incorporated in their entirety by reference. A therapeutic agent is a molecule or atom which is administered separately, concurrently or sequentially with an antibody component, i.e., an antibody or antibody fragment, or a subfragment thereof, and is useful in the treatment of a disease. Examples of therapeutic agents include antibodies, antibody fragments, immunoconj ugates, drugs, cytotoxic agents, toxins, nucleases, hormones, immunomodulators, chelators, boron compounds, photoactive agents or dyes, radioisotopes or radionuclides, immunoconjugates or combinations thereof. An immunoconjugate is an antibody component conjugated to a therapeutic agent. Suitable therapeutic agents are described above. As used herein, the term antibody fusion protein is a recombinantly-produced antigen-binding molecule in which two or more of the same or different natural antibody, single-chain antibody or antibody fragment segments with the same or different specificities are linked. A fusion protein comprises at least one specific binding site. Valency of the fusion protein indicates the total number of binding arms or sites the fusion protein has to antigen(s) or epitope(s); i.e., monovalent, bivalent, trivalent or multivalent. The multivalency of the antibody fusion protein means that it can take advantage of multiple interactions in binding to an antigen, thus increasing the avidity of binding to the antigen, or to different antigens. Specificity indicates how many different types of antigen or epitope an antibody fusion protein is able to bind; i.e., monospecific, bispecific, trispecific, multispecific. Using these definitions, a natural antibody, e.g., an IgG, is bivalent because it has two binding arms but is monospecific because it binds to one type of antigen or epitope. A monospecific, multivalent fusion protein has more than one binding site for the same antigen or epitope. For example, a monospecific diabody is a fusion protein with two binding sites reactive with the same antigen. The fusion protein may comprise a multivalent or multispecific combination of different antibody components or multiple copies of the same antibody component. The fusion protein may additionally comprise a therapeutic agent. An immunomodulator is a therapeutic agent as defined in the present invention that when present, alters, suppresses or stimulates the body's immune system. Typically, the immunomodulator useful in the present invention stimulates immune cells to proliferate or become activated in an immune response cascade, such as macrophages, B-cells, and/or T-cells. An example of an immunomodulator as described herein is a cytokine, which is a soluble small protein of approximately 5-20 kDs that are released by one cell population (e.g., primed T-lymphocytes) on contact with specific antigens, and which act as intercellular mediators between cells. As the skilled artisan will understand, examples of cytokines include lymphokines, monokines, interleukins, and several related signalling molecules, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interferons. Chemokines are a subset of cytokines. Certain interleukins and interferons are examples of cytokines that stimulate T cell or other immune cell proliferation. In a preferred embodiment, the intracellularly-cleavable moiety is optionally cleavable by intracellular esterases. In a preferred embodiment, the intracellularly-cleavable moiety is an ester moiety.

Targeting moiety is a monoclonal antibody (mAb). In one embodiment, the targeting moiety is a monoclonal antibody (mAb). In a further embodiment, the targeting moiety may be a multivalent and/or multispecific mAb. The targeting moiety may be a murine, chimeric, humanized, or human monoclonal antibody, and said antibody is in intact, fragment (Fab, Fab′, F(ab)2, F(ab′)2), or sub-fragment (single-chain constructs) form. In a preferred embodiment, the targeting moiety is a monoclonal antibody that is reactive with an antigen or epitope of an antigen expressed on a cancer or malignant cell. The cancer cell is preferably a cell from a hematopoietic tumor, carcinoma, sarcoma, melanoma or a glial tumor. The targeting moiety preferably links to at least one chemotherapeutic moiety, more preferably it links to about 7 to 12 said chemotherapeutic moieties. A preferred linker has the formula: The linker optionally comprises a functional group at the N-terminus, a water-solubilizing moiety at the C-terminus, and one or more internal basic amino acids with side chains available for attachment to said chemotherapeutic moiety.

In particular, the pathogen may be selected from the group consisting of Streptococcus agalactiae, Legionella pneumophilia, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Neisseria gonorrhosae, Neisseria meningitidis, Pneumococcus, Hemophilis influenzae B, Treponema pallidum, Lyme disease spirochetes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Mycobacterium leprae, Brucella abortus, mycobacterium tuberculosis, rabies virus, influenza virus, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus I, herpes simplex virus II, human serum parvo-like virus, respiratory syncytial virus, varicella-zoster virus, hepatitis B virus, measles virus, adenovirus, human T-cell leukemia viruses, Epstein-Barr virus, murine leukemia virus, mumps virus, vesicular stomatitis virus, sindbis virus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, wart virus, blue tongue virus, Sendai virus, feline leukemia virus, reo virus, polio virus, simian virus 40, mouse mammary tumor virus, dengue virus, rubella virus, Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax, Toxoplasma gondii, Trypanosoma rangeli, Trypanosoma cruzi, Trypanosoma rhodesiensei, Trypanosoma brucei, Schistosoma mansoni, Schistosoma japanicum, Babesia Bovis, Elmeria tenella, Onchocerca volvulus, Leishmania tropica, Trichinella spiralis, Theileria parva, Taenia hydatigena, Taenia ovis, Taenia saginata, Echinococcus granulosus, Mesocestoides corti, Mycoplasma arthritidis, M. hyorhinis, M. orale, M. arginini, Acholeplasma laidlawii, M. salivarium and M. pneumoniae. The immunoconjugates may also be used to treat autoimmune disease, including class III autoimmune diseases. Preferred class III autoimmune diseases for treatment according to the invention are selected from the group consisting of immune-mediated thrombocytopenias, dermatomyositis, Sjögren's syndrome, multiple sclerosis, Sydenham's chorea, myasthenia gravis, systemic lupus erythematosus, lupus nephritis, rheumatic fever, rheumatoid arthritis, polyglandular syndromes, bullous pemphigoid, diabetes mellitus, Henoch-Schonlein purpura, post-streptococcal nephritis, erythema nodosum, Takayasu's arteritis, Addison's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, sarcoidosis, ulcerative colitis, erythema multiforme, IgA nephropathy, polyarteritis nodosa, ankylosing spondylitis, Goodpasture's syndrome, thromboangitis ubiterans, primary biliary cirrhosis, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, thyrotoxicosis, scleroderma, chronic active hepatitis, polymyositis/dermatomyositis, polychondritis, pamphigus vulgaris, Wegener's granulomatosis, membranous nephropathy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, tabes dorsalis, giant cell arteritis/polymyalgia, pernicious anemia, rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis and fibrosing alveolitis. The immunoconguates are preferably administered parenterally. In one aspect of the preferred embodiments of the present invention, the invention relates to an immunoconjugate comprising a targeting moiety, a chemotherapeutic moiety and a linker binding to the targeting moiety via a thiol group, and to the chemotherapeutic moiety via an intracellularly-cleavable moiety other than a hydrazone. In a preferred embodiment, the intracellularly-cleavable moiety other than a hydrazone are moieties that may be cleaved once internalized into the cell to which the mAb recognizes and binds to a receptor, and particularly cleaved by esterases and amidases. In a preferred embodiment, the chemotherapeutic moiety is separately activated at neutral pH such that it contains a thiol-reactive group. It is within the skill of the ordinary skilled artisan to develop chemistries that would allow for the incorporation of thiol-reactive groups into any chemotherapeutic moiety. In a preferred embodiment, however, the chemotherapeutic moiety may be activated such that the group bearing the thiol-reactive group is spaced from the chemotherapeutic moiety by an amino acid radical. In a preferred embodiment, the α-amino group of the amino acid may reacted with a reagent bearing a thiol-reactive group, such as maleimide, chloroacetamide, bromoacetamide, iodoacetamide, and vinylsulfone. Preferably, said reagent bearing a thiol-reactive group is succinimidyl [4-maleimidomethyl]cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (SMCC). In the case of SMCC, the thiol-reactive group is a maleimide group. The product resulting from the reaction of SMCC and the chemotherapeutic moiety comprising an amino acid radical is the general compound illustrated below: wherein R is the side chain of any amino acid. While not wishing to be bound by this theory, the maleimido cyclohexyl carboxylate group is thought to be particularly useful in the context of the preferred embodiments of the present invention for two reasons. First, the cyclohexyl group in the linker is thought to stabilize the amide functionality formed from the reaction of SMCC and the amino acid α-amino group. Second, the ester formed between the drug and the amino acid carboxylate is cleaved once the immunoconjugate is internalized into the cell. An example of intracellularly cleaved ester bond is paclitaxel-MC192 immunoconjugate (Gillimard and Saragovi, supra). In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the chemotherapeutic moiety comprising an amino acid radical, as shown above, contains the linker; that is, the linker binding to the targeting moiety via a thiol group. The linker is the portion of the molecule shown below: However, the scope of the preferred embodiments of the present invention is not so limited. The linker may be a moiety that simply comprises an amino acid radical and a thiol-reactive group. The amino acid radical and the thiol-reactive group may be spaced by any moieties known to the skilled artisan, including the 4-methylene cyclohexane-1-carbonyl moiety shown above. The immunoconjugate of the preferred embodiments of the present invention is obtained from the reaction of the activated chemotherapeutic moiety with an antibody using methods well known in the art. The chemotherapeutic moiety may be attached to the mAb through the thiol-reactive group after reduction of the mAb inter-chain disulfide bonds. This approach generates an average of eight free thiol groups per molecule of antibody, and does so in a reproducible manner at the limiting levels of thiol used in the reduction reaction. For conjugating to lysine groups of an antibody, the antibody is first derivatized to contain a thiol-reactive group, with the chemotherapeutic moiety containing a thiol group. Methods for introducing thiol groups on to antibodies by modifications of mAb's lysine groups are well known in the art (Govindan et al. Bioconjugate Chemistry, 7:290-297, 1996; Wong in Chemistry of protein conjugation and cross-linking, CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, Fla. (1991), pp 20-22). In this way, the bifunctional chemotherapeutic moiety is conjugated to antibody fragments and subfragments including single-chain constructs. Conversely, the chemotherapeutic moiety contains a thiol-reactive group which reacts with the thiol(s) of a reduced mAb. The targeting moiety is preferably an antibody (including fully human, non-human, humanized, or chimeric antibodies) or an antibody fragment (including enzymatically or recombinantly produced fragments) and binding proteins incorporating sequences from antibodies or antibody fragments. The antibodies, fragments, and binding proteins may be multivalent and multispecific or multivalent and monospecific as defined above. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, antibodies, such as mAbs, are used that recognize or bind to markers or tumor-associated antigens that are expressed at high levels on target cells and that are expressed predominantly or only on diseased cells versus normal tissues, and antibodies that internalize rapidly. Antibodies useful within the scope of the present invention include mAbs with properties as described above (and show distinguishing properties of different levels of internalization into cells and microorganisms), and contemplate the use of, but are not limited to, in cancer, the following mAbs: LL1 (anti-CD74), LL2 (anti-CD22), RS7 (anti-epithelial glycoprotein-1(EGP-1)), PAM-4 and KC4 (both anti-MUC1), MN-14 (anti-carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA, also known as CD66e), Mu-9 (anti-colon-specific antigen-p), Immu 31 (an anti-alpha-fetoprotein), TAG-72 (e.g., CC49), Tn, J591 (anti-PSMA (prostate-specific membrane antigen)), G250 (an anti-carbonic anhydrase IX mAb) and L243 (anti-HLA-DR). Other useful antigens that may be targeted using these conjugates include HER-2/neu, BrE3, CD19, CD20 (e.g., C2B8, hA20, 1F5 Mabs) CD21, CD23, CD80, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), VEGF, EGF receptor, PlGF, MUC1, MUC2, MUC3, MUC4, PSMA, gangliosides, HCG, EGP-2 (e.g., 17-1A), CD37, HLA-DR, CD30, Ia, A3, A33, Ep-CAM, KS-1, Le(y), S100, PSA (prostate-specific antigen), tenascin, folate receptor, Thomas-Friedenreich antigens, tumor necrosis antigens, tumor angiogenesis antigens, Ga 733, IL-2, IL-6, T101, MAGE, antigen to which L243 binds, CD66 antigens, i.e. CD66a-d or a combination thereof. The CD66 antigens consist of five different glycoproteins with similar structures, CD66a-e, encoded by the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) gene family members, BCG, CGM6, NCA, CGM1 and CEA, respectively. These CD66 antigens are expressed mainly in granulocytes, normal epithelial cells of the digestive tract anc tumor cells of various tissues. A number of the aforementioned antigens are disclosed in U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60/426,379, entitled “Use of Multi-specific, Non-covalent Complexes for Targeted Delivery of Therapeutics,” filed Nov. 15, 2002. In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, antibodies are used that internalize rapidly and are then re-expressed, processed and presented on cell surfaces, enabling continual uptake and accretion of circulating immunoconjugate by the cell. An example of a most-preferred antibody/antigen pair is LL1, an anti-CD74 mAb (invariant chain, class II-specific chaperone, Ii). The CD74 antigen is highly expressed on B-cell lymphomas, certain T-cell lymphomas, melanomas and certain other cancers (Ong et al., Immunology 98:296-302 (1999)), as well as certain autoimmune diseases. The diseases that are preferably treated with anti-CD74 antibodies include, but are not limited to, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, melanoma and multiple myeloma. Continual expression of the CD74 antigen for short periods of time on the surface of target cells, followed by internalization of the antigen, and re-expression of the antigen, enables the targeting LL1 antibody to be internalized along with any chemotherapeutic moiety it carries as a “payload.” This allows a high, and therapeutic, concentration of LL1-chemotherapeutic drug immunoconjugate to be accumulated inside such cells. Internalized LL1-chemotherapeutic drug immunoconjugates are cycled through lysosomes and endosomes, and the chemotherapeutic moiety is released in an active form within the target cells. In another aspect, the invention relates to a method of treating a subject, comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of a therapeutic conjugate of the preferred embodiments of the present invention to a subject. Diseases that may be treated the therapeutic conjugates of the preferred embodiments of the present invention include, but are not limited to B-cell malignancies (e.g., non-Hodgkins lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia using, for example LL2 mAb; see U.S. Pat. No. 6,183,744), adenocarcinomas of endodermally-derived digestive system epithelia, cancers such as breast cancer and non-small cell lung cancer, and other carcinomas, sarcomas, glial tumors, myeloid leukemias, etc. In particular, antibodies against an antigen, e.g., an oncofetal antigen, produced by or associated with a malignant solid tumor or hematopoietic neoplasm, e.g., a gastrointestinal, lung, breast, prostate, ovarian, testicular, brain or lymphatic tumor, a sarcoma or a melanoma, are advantageously used. As used herein, the term “subject” refers to any animal (i.e., vertebrates and invertebrates) including, but not limited to mammals. The term subject also includes rodents (e.g., mice, rats, and guinea pigs). It is not intended that the term be limited to a particular age or sex. Thus, adult and newborn subjects, as well as fetuses, whether male or female, are encompassed by the term. In another preferred embodiment, the therapeutic conjugates comprising the Mu-9 mAb of the preferred embodiments of the present invention can be used to treat colorectal, as well as pancreatic and ovarian cancers as disclosed in U.S. application Ser. No. 10/116,116, filed Apr. 5, 2002 and by Gold et al. (Cancer Res. 50: 6405 (1990), and references cited therein). In addition, the therapeutic conjugates comprising the PAM-4 mAb of the preferred embodiments of the present invention can be used to treat pancreatic cancer, as disclosed in U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60/388,314, filed Jun. 14, 2002. In another preferred embodiment, the therapeutic conjugates comprising the RS-7 mAb of the preferred embodiments can be used to treat carcinomas such as carcinomas of the lung, stomach, urinary bladder, breast, ovary, uterus, and prostate, as disclosed in U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60/360,229, filed Mar. 1, 2002 and by Stein et al. (Cancer Res. 50: 1330 (1990) and Antibody Immunoconj. Radiopharm. 4: 703 (1991)). In another preferred embodiment, the therapeutic conjugates comprising the anti-AFP mAb of the preferred embodiments can be used to treat hepatocellular carcinoma, germ cell tumors, and other AFP-producing tumors using humanized, chimeric and human antibody forms, as disclosed in U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60/399,707, filed Aug. 1, 2002. In another preferred embodiment, the therapeutic conjugates comprising anti-tenascin antibodies can be used to treat hematopoietic and solid tumors and conjugates comprising antibodies to Le(y) can be used to treat solid tumors. In another preferred embodiment, diseases that may be treated using the therapeutic conjugates of the preferred embodiments of the present invention include, but are not limited to immune dysregulation disease and related autoimmune diseases, including Class III autoimmune diseases such as immune-mediated thrombocytopenias, such as acute idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, dermatomyositis, Sjögren's syndrome, multiple sclerosis, Sydenham's chorea, myasthenia gravis, systemic lupus erythematosus, lupus nephritis, rheumatic fever, polyglandular syndromes, bullous pemphigoid, diabetes mellitus, Henoch-Schonlein purpura, post-streptococcal nephritis, erythema nodosum, Takayasu's arteritis, Addison's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, sarcoidosis, ulcerative colitis, erythema multiforme, IgA nephropathy, polyarteritis nodosa, ankylosing spondylitis, Goodpasture's syndrome, thromboangitis ubiterans, Sjogren's syndrome, primary biliary cirrhosis, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, thyrotoxicosis, scleroderma, chronic active hepatitis, rheumatoid arthritis, polymyositis/dermatomyositis, polychondritis, pamphigus vulgaris, Wegener's granulomatosis, membranous nephropathy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, tabes dorsalis, giant cell arteritis/polymyalgia, pernicious anemia, rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis and fibrosing alveolitis, as disclosed in U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60/360,259, filed Mar. 1, 2002. Typical antibodies useful in these diseases include, but are not limited to, those reactive with HLA-DR antigens, B-cell antigens (e.g., CD19, CD20, CD21, CD22, CD23, CD4, CD5, CD8, CD14, CD15, CD19, CD20, CD21, CD22, CD23, CD25, CD33, CD37, CD38, CD40, CD40L, CD46, CD52, CD54, CD74, CD80, CD126, B7, MUC1, Ia, HM1.24, and HLA-DR). Since many of these autoimmune diseases are affected by autoantibodies made by aberrant B-cell populations, depletion of these B-cells by therapeutic conjugates involving such antibodies bound with the drugs used in this invention, is a preferred method of autoimmune disease therapy, especially when B-cell antibodies are combined, in certain circumstances, with HLA-DR antibodies and/or T-cell antibodies (including those which target IL-2 as an antigen, such as anti-TAC antibody). In another preferred embodiment, the therapeutic conjugates of the preferred embodiments can be used against pathogens, since antibodies against pathogens are known. For example, antibodies and antibody fragments which specifically bind markers produced by or associated with infectious lesions, including viral, bacterial, fungal and parasitic infections, for example caused by pathogens such as bacteria, rickettsia, mycoplasma, protozoa, fungi, and viruses, and antigens and products associated with such microorganisms have been disclosed, inter alia, in Hansen et al., U.S. Pat. No. 3,927,193 and Goldenberg U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,331,647, 4,348,376, 4,361,544, 4,468,457, 4,444,744, 4,818,709 and 4,624,846. In a preferred embodiment, the pathogens are selected from the group consisting of Streptococcus agalactiae, Legionella pneumophilia, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Neisseria gonorrhosae, Neisseria meningitidis, Pneumococcus, Hemophilis influenzae B, Treponema pallidum, Lyme disease spirochetes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Mycobacterium leprae, Brucella abortus, mycobacterium tuberculosis, rabies virus, influenza virus, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus I, herpes simplex virus II, human serum parvo-like virus, respiratory syncytial virus, varicella-zoster virus, hepatitis B virus, measles virus, adenovirus, human T-cell leukemia viruses, Epstein-Barr virus, murine leukemia virus, mumps virus, vesicular stomatitis virus, sindbis virus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, wart virus, blue tongue virus, Sendai virus, feline leukemia virus, reo virus, polio virus, simian virus 40, mouse mammary tumor virus, dengue virus, rubella virus, Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax, Toxoplasma gondii, Trypanosoma rangeli, Trypanosoma cruzi, Trypanosoma rhodesiensei, Trypanosoma brucei, Schistosoma mansoni, Schistosoma japanicum, Babesia bovis, Elmeria tenella, Onchocerca volvulus, Leishmania tropica, Trichinella spiralis, Theileria parva, Taenia hydatigena, Taenia ovis, Taenia saginata, Echinococcus granulosus, Mesocestoides corti, Mycoplasma arthritidis, M. hyorhinis, M. orale, M. arginini, Acholeplasma laidlawii, M. salivarium and M. pneumoniae, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,440,416. In one embodiment, antibiotics are delivered as chemoconjugates incorporating siderophore components for use against infection with Gram-negative bacterial pathogens. Siderophores are iron-chelating bis catecholates of di- or triamines, and are used as delivery vehicles. The iron chelate of siderophores are recognized by specific receptors on the bacterial membrane, thus leading to active transport inside the bacterila cell (Heinisch et al. J. Medicinal Chemistry, 45: 3032-3040, 2002). Within the context of the present invention, a peptide is assembled with protected lysine as the N-terminus. The carboxyl end of the peptide, liberated from the resin support, is then activated, and coupled to amine-containing antibiotic such as penicillin N. The protecting groups at the N-terminus are cleaved, and the amino groups of the N-terminal lysine are then conjugated to 2,3-diacetoxybenzoyl chloride to ultimately furnish the required bis catecholate-appended penicillin conjugate. The diacetyl derivative of the catechol moiety is also effective as siderophore component (Heinisch et al. supra). In a preferred embodiment, the antibodies that are used in the treatment of human disease are human or humanized (CDR-grafted) versions of antibodies; although murine and chimeric versions of antibodies can be used. For veterinary uses, the same-species IgG would likely be the most effective vector, although cross-species IgGs would remain useful. Same species IgG molecules as delivery agents are mostly preferred to minimize immune responses. This is particularly important when considering repeat treatments. For humans, a human or humanized IgG antibody is less likely to generate an anti-IgG immune response from patients. Targeting an internalizing antigen, antibodies such as hLL1 and hLL2 rapidly internalize after binding to target cells, which means that the chemotherapeutic drug being carried is rapidly internalized into cells. However, antibodies that have slower rates of internalization can also be used to effect selective therapy with this invention. In a preferred embodiment of this invention, a more effective incorporation into cells and pathogens can be accomplished by using multivalent, multispecific or multivalent, monospecific antibodies. Multivalent means the use of several binding arms against the same or different antigen or epitope expressed on the cells, whereas multispecific antibodies involve the use of multiple binding arms to target at least two different antigens or epitopes contained on the targeted cell or pathogen. Examples of such bivalent and bispecific antibodies are found in U.S. patent application 60/399,707, filed Aug. 1, 2002; 60/360,229, filed Mar. 1, 2002; 60/388,314, filed Jun. 14, 2002; and Ser. No. 10/116,116, filed Apr. 5, 2002, all of which are incorporated by reference herein. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, camptothecin (CPT) and its derivatives are preferred chemotherapeutic moieties, although the invention is not so limited. Other chemotherapeutic moieties that are within the scope of the invention are taxanes (e.g., baccatin III, taxol), epothilones, anthracycline drugs (doxorubicin (DOX), epirubicin, morpholinodoxorubicin (morpholino-DOX), cyanomorpholino-doxorubicin (cyanomorpholino-DOX), and 2-pyrrolinodoxorubicin (2-PDOX); see Priebe W (ed.), ACS symposium series 574, published by American Chemical Society, Washington D.C., 1995. (332 pp) and Nagy et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93:2464-2469, 1996), benzoquinoid ansamycins exemplified by geldanamycin (DeBoer et al., Journal of Antibiotics 23:442-447, 1970; Neckers et al., Invest. New Drugs 17:361-373, 1999), and the like. Preferably, in the immunoconjugates of the preferred embodiments of the present invention, the targeting moiety links to at least one chemotherapeutic moiety; preferably 1 to about 5 chemotherapeutic moieties; most preferably about 7 to about 12 chemotherapeutic moieties. CPT derivatives are a class of potent antitumor agents. Irinotecan (also referred to as CPT-11) and topotecan are CPT analogs which are approved cancer therapeutics (Iyer and Ratain, Cancer Chemother. Phamacol. 42: S31-S43 (1998)). CPTs act by inhibiting topoisomerase I enzyme by stabilizing topoisomerase I-DNA complex (Liu, et al. in The Camptothecins: Unfolding Their Anticancer Potential, Liehr J. G., Giovanella, B. C. and Verschraegen (eds), NY Acad. Sci., NY (2000), pp 1-10). CPTs present a set of caveats in the preparation of immunoconjugates. One caveat is the insolubility of most CPT derivatives in aqueous buffers. Secondly, CPTs provide very few options for structural modification for conjugating to macromolecules. For instance, CPT itself contains only a tertiary hydroxyl group in ring-E. The hydroxyl functional group in the case of CPT must be coupled to a linker suitable for subsequent protein conjugation. Thirdly the lability of the δ-lactone moiety of the E-ring of their structures, under physiological conditions, results in greatly reduced antitumor potency of these products. Therefore, the conjugation protocol is performed such that it is carried out at a pH of 7 or lower to avoid the lactone ring opening. Typically conjugation of a bifunctional CPT possessing an amine-reactive group such as an active ester would require a pH of 8 or greater. Fourth, an intracellularly-cleavable moiety is to be incorporated in the linker/spacer connecting the CPTs and the antibodies. The problem of δ-lactone opening under physiological conditions has been previously addressed. One approach has been to acylate the C-20 hydroxyl group with an amino acid, and couple the α-amino group of the amino acid to poly-L-glutamic acid. This approach relies on the passive diffusion of a polymeric molecule into tumor sites. This glycine conjugation has also been reported as a method of making water-soluble derivative of CPT (U.S. Pat. No. 4,943,579) and in the preparation of a PEG-derivatization of CPT (Greenwald, et al. J. Med. Chem. 39: 1938-1940 (1996). In the latter case, the approach has been devised in the context of developing water-soluble and long acting forms of CPT, whereby CPT's in vivo half-life is enhanced, and the drug is gradually released from its conjugate while in circulation in vivo. In a preferred embodiment, the present invention devises methods for preparing immunoconjugates of CPTs, taking into consideration the four caveats described above. The preferred embodiments of the present invention address the caveats in the following ways. First, the water-solubility of CPT is increased by placing an aminopolycarboxylate between the chemotherapeutic moiety (i.e., CPT) and the antibody. In a preferred embodiment the aminopolycarboxylate is selected from the group consisting of DTPA (diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid), NOTA (1,4,7-triazacyclononane-N,N′,N″-triacetic acid), DOTA (1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-N,N′,N″,N′″-tetraacetic acid), and TETA (1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclotetradecane-1,4,8,11-tetraacetic acid). In a preferred embodiment, the aminopolycarboxylate is DTPA. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the DTPA is attached to the chemotherapeutic moiety by way of a reagent bearing the same. Preferably, said reagent bearing an aminopolycarboxylate is: wherein “Trt” is a trityl group and the R groups on the carboxylates are either hydrogen or alkyl (wherein alkyl means a straight or branched chain C1-C6-alkyl group). The ordinary skilled artisan would be able to develop other reagents bearing an aminopolycarboxylate that would be useful in the practice of the preferred embodiments of the present invention. The reagent bearing a hapten can be attached to the chemotherapeutic moiety via the carboxylic acid of the thiourea moiety by methods well know in the art. One such method well know in the art is described in Example 8. Where R is alkyl, the esters are deprotected to ultimately obtain the corresponding DIVA derivative. The reagent bearing an aminopolycarboxylate may be attached to the chemotherapeutic moiety directly or by way of an amino acid spacer. In a preferred embodiment, the reagent bearing an aminopolycarboxylate is attached to the chemotherapeutic moiety via a glycine spacer, and more preferably via valine spacer. The use of more hindered valinate ester has been shown to provide a hydrolytically stable moiety (Lerchen H-G et al., J. Med. Chem. 44:4186-4195 (2001)). The derivatization of C-20 hydroxyl as an ester can also involve a dipeptide or a polypeptide. When the chemotherapeutic moiety is 10-hydroxy CPT, the glycyl spacer is attached either at the A-ring hydroxyl group or at the C-20 hydroxyl group as shown in Example 7, below; most preferably, the glycyl or other spacers mentioned above is attached at the C-20 hydroxyl group. In a preferred embodiment, the water-solubility of the chemotherapeutic moiety is increased via the incorporation of the following moiety (A) at a hydroxyl group on the chemotherapeutic moiety: wherein “PEG” denotes polyethylene glycol. This moiety not only increases the water solubility of the chemotherapeutic moiety, but it also incorporates a thiol reactive group. In the case of 10-hydroxy CPT, the aforementioned moiety may be attached at the A-ring hydroxyl group or at the C-20 hydroxyl group. For attachment to the C-20 hydroxyl, the C-10 hydroxyl is first protected. The C-20 hydroxyl is then converted to, for example, the glycinate ester. At this point, the C-10 hydroxyl may be deprotected. The free amino group of the C-20 glycinate ester can then be suitably elaborated to contain, for example, an intracellularly cleavable ‘Phe-Lys’ dipeptide linkage which is recognized and cleaved by intracellular Cathepsin B enzyme. The PEG-containing moiety shown above is then installed at the free amino group at the end of the C-20 glycinate-Phe-Lys dipeptide. Second, the δ-lactone is stabilized via derivatization of the C-20 hydroxyl group with an amino acid radical. The use of an amino acid linker/spacer at the C-20 hydroxyl of CPT is advantageous for further elaboration of the amine with a thiol-reactive moiety. Moreover, the amino acid linker/spacer acts as an intracellularly-cleavable moiety. At this point, the immunoconjugate effectively becomes an intracellularly-activated prodrug. That is, the release of the chemotherapeutic moiety from the immunoconjugate would depend upon the binding of the immunoconjugate to tumor-specific antigens, subsequent internalization, routing to lysosomal compartment, and finally processing of the conjugate by lysosomal enzymes resulting in the release of the drug. Finally, the conjugation protocol is based on a thiol-maleimide or a thiol-vinylsulfone reaction which is facile at neutral or acidic pH. This obviates the need for higher pH conditions for conjugations as, for instance, would be necessitated when using active esters. In another aspect, the present invention relates to a modular approach for introducing a water-solubilizing moiety and a thiol-reactive moiety (e.g., maleimide groups) into the immunoconjugates of the preferred embodiments of the present invention. The water-solubilizing moiety and the thiol-reactive moiety are conveniently introduced onto a template such as: MCC-Gly-Lys-Lys(R′)—NH2, wherein MCC is 4-maleimidomethyl-cyclohexyl-1-carbonyl (the maleimide derivative of choice derived from SMCC), and wherein R′ is a water solubilizing entity, such as an aminopolycarboxylate (e.g., DTPA) or a derivative of piperazine. The derivatization of CPT or its analog as an ester at the C-20 hydroxyl, through the use of an amino acid or a dipeptide as enumerated in the embodiments described already, results in an amino group which is available for activation. The amino group can be converted to an isothiocyanato group by methods well known in the art; the latter is linked to the side chain amino group of the internal lysine moiety of the peptide template described above. In this way, a water-solubilizing group and an antibody-reactive group are added in a single step. Moreover, by modifying the peptide template to contain more than one central lysine or other side-chain-amine-containing amino acid, such as arginine, multiple chemotherapeutic drug moieties can be added. It is contemplated that the above-mentioned approach can be useful in introducing 1 to 5, more preferably 1 to 2 chemotherapeutic drug moieties onto the linker. In yet another preferred embodiment, a pH-sensitive intracellularly-cleavable moiety is used as a linker binding the targeting moiety to the chemotherapeutic moiety. An advantage with this approach is that intratumoral release of the chemotherapeutic moiety will not depend upon the extent of expression of specific enzymes for the breakage of the bonds of the intracellularly-cleavable moiety that links the targeting moiety to the chemotherapeutic moiety. For example, the 20-hydroxyl group of CPT can be attached under acid catalysis to a pH-sensitive intracellularly-cleavable moiety comprising a dihydropyran moiety, a tetrahydrofuran moiety or an orthoester moiety which, in turn, comprises a thiol-reactive moiety (e.g., maleimide), and water solubilizing group (e.g., piperazine). See Chart 1. pH-sensitive intracellularly-cleavable moieties comprising a dihydropyran, tetrahydrofuran or an orthoester moiety all comprise an ether bond that is susceptible to cleavage under the acidic pH of intracellular compartments. A linker with structure-1 in the chart below is used. In this example, the central piperazine portion will allow for water-solubility. The substituted dihydropyran at the ‘left end’ of the molecule is for coupling to the hydroxyl group(s) in CPT derivatives, while the maleimide at the ‘right end’ of the molecule is a prototypical thiol-reactive group for conjugating to disulfide-reduced antibody. Herein, ‘CPT’ is used as a general term, and can be CPT, 10-hydroxy-CPT, or SN-38, as shown in the Chart. In the case of 10-hydroxy-CPT and SN-38, derivatizations can be envisaged at both 10-hydroxy and 20-hydroxy positions. The bonding of CPT to the cross-linker is via a tetrahydropyran moiety. This bond is slowly cleaved at pH 4-6, but stable above pH 6 (Greene T W, Wuts PGM: Protective groups in organic synthesis, second edition; John Wiley & Sons: New York, 1991; pp 413-416.) This approach takes advantage of the acidic nature of intracellular compartment; generally about 5. (Poznansky M J and Juliano R L, Pharmacol Rev 36:277-336, 1984.) This acidic pH in intracellular compartments causes the release the drug intact from the antibody. As mentioned above, tetrahydrofuranyl moieties are contemplated as integral parts of pH-sensitive intracellularly-cleavable moieties. (Greene T W, Wuts PGM: Protective groups in organic synthesis, second edition; John Wiley & Sons: New York, 1991; pp 267-269.) When the pH-sensitive intracellularly cleavable moiety comprises a tetrahydrofuranyl moiety, the cleavage of the CPT C20-oxygen-tetrahydrofuran bond cleaves faster than when a tetrahydropyranyl moiety is used. Suitable routes of administration of the immunoconjugates of the preferred embodiments of the present invention include, without limitation, oral, parenteral, rectal, transmucosal, intestinal administration, intramuscular, subcutaneous, intramedullary, intrathecal, direct intraventricular, intravenous, intravitreal, intraperitoneal, intranasal, or intraocular injections. The preferred routes of administration are parenteral. Alternatively, one may administer the compound in a local rather than systemic manner, for example, via injection of the compound directly into a solid tumor. The present invention is illustrated by the following examples, without limiting the scope of the invention. EXAMPLES Example-1 Preparation of C-20-O—(N-‘MCC’)glycinate derivative of 10-hydroxycamptothecin, where MCC is 4-(N-maleimidomethyl)-cyclohexane-1-carbonyl residue 10-Hydroxycamptothecin (0.2081 g; 0.57 mmol) was dissolved in 20 mL of anhydrous dimethyl formamide (DMF) and 0.22 mL of diisopropylethylamine (DIEA). To this was added 0.1248 g (0.619 mmol) of 4-nitrophenyl chloroformate, and the reaction mixture was stirred under argon, at the room temperature, for 4 h. A solution of 4-piperidinopiperidine (0.2403 g) in 4 mL of DMF was added in one lot, and the mixture was stirred for another 2 h. Solvent removal furnished the crude product, which was purified by flash chromatography on silica gel (230-400 mesh) using methanol-dichloromethane gradient elution to obtain 52.8 mg of the intermediate 2. Electrospray mass spectrum showed a clean peak at m/e 559 (M+H) in the positive ion mode, and peaks at m/e 557 (M−H) and 593 (M+Cl) in the negative ion mode. The intermediate 2 (25 mg) was reacted with BOC-glycine (8.9 mg), N,N-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) (2 mg) and dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DIC) (0.058 mL of 1 M solution in dichloromethane) in 10 mL of dichloromethane (DCM) for 18 h (room temperature, under argon). The reaction mixture was worked up and purified by flash chromatography to obtain C-20-O-(BOC)glycinate in ˜50% yield. This product was reacted with a 10% DCM solution of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), for 1-to-2 h, to obtain 20-O-glycinate derivative. The latter was derivatized with 1.2 molar equivalent of succinimidylmaleimidomethylcyclohexanecarboxylate (SMCC) and 1.5 equivalent of DIEA in DMF for ˜3 h (room temperature, under argon). Solvent removal and flash chromatography resulted in the recovery of 7.8 mg of pure 3 as gummy solid. 3: Analytical HPLC (C18 column, gradient elution using solution A changing to solution ‘B’ in 10 minutes at 3 mL/min, then maintained at 100% ‘B’ for 5 min.; ‘A’: 0.1% aq. TFA; ‘B’: 90% CH3CN/0.1% TFA) showed single peak 9.48 min (absorbance at 360 nm). Electrospray mass spectrum showed mass peak at m/e 835 (M+H). Example-2 Preparation of C-20-O—(N-‘MCC’)glycinate derivative of irinotecan (CPT-11), where MCC is 4-(N-maleimidomethyl)-cyclohexane-1-carbonyl residue Starting from CPT-11 (4), the product 5 was prepared in a 3-step procedure by reacting with BOC-glycine (purified product showed M+H at m/e 744 in electrospray mass spectrum), deprotection with TFA (M+H peak at m/e 644 in mass spectrum), and coupling to SMCC, as in Example-1. Product purifications were carried out as in Example-1. The final product 5 showed an intense peak at m/e 863 in the positive ion mode electrospray mass spectrum, and a clean peak in analytical HPLC at 9.69 min. Pure product 5 was obtained as a white solid, and was produced in 25 mg amount. Example-3 Preparation of 10-piperazinocarbonyloxy Camptothecin (6) and its Coupling to a Heterobifunctional Poly(Ethyleneglycol), Maleimide-PEG-NHS The preparation of the intermediate 6 in the Scheme-3 above was achieved along the lines of the preparation of 2 in Scheme-1 by using piperazine in place of piperidinopiperidine. After flash chromatographic purification, 6 was obtained in 43.3% yield (orange solid). Electrospray mass spectrum showed M+H at m/e 477 and M−H (negative ion mode) at m/e 475. For the preparation of 7, the precursor 6 was mixed with 0.5 molar equivalent of poly(ethylene glycol-α-N-hydroxysuccinimidyl propionate, β-maleimide, MW 3400 (obtained from Shearwater Polymers, Huntsville, Ala.) in DMF, and incubated for 30 min. The reaction mixture was used as such without purification. The molar content of the activated CPT was considered equal to that of the limiting PEG reagent used. Example-4 General Procedure for Conjugating CPT Derivatives 3 or 5 or 7 with Monoclonal Antibodies The antibody was treated with a 20-to-40-fold molar excess of dithiothreitol and ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) (˜5 mM final conc.) at pH 7.4, flushed with argon, and incubated for 45 min. at 37° C. The cooled contents were then purified on two successive 3-mL columns of Sephadex G50/80 in 50 mM sodium acetate-150 mM sodium chloride pH 5.3 (“ABS buffer”) under centrifuged elution conditions (centrifuged SEC). The eluate was analyzed for protein concentration using absorbance at 280 nm, and thiol content by Ellman's assay. The reduced antibodies contained 7-to-9 thiol groups. The reduced antibody was reacted with a 20-fold molar excess of the CPT derivative in DMF such that the final concentration of DMF in the conjugation mixture was ≦5% v/v, and incubated on ice (˜4° C.) for 20-to-30 min. Two successive centrifuged-SEC purifications on Sephadex G50/80 in ABS buffer, followed by passing the eluate through a hydrophobic column to remove non-covalently bound CPT derivative, furnished the final conjugate. In the case of conjugates using 7, additional purification by ultrafiltration on a30K MWCO centrifugal filter proved necessary. In all the conjugate preparations, the reaction mixtures as well as the purified conjugates were clear solutions, indicating that the water-soluble nature of CPT derivatives used. Analysis by SE-HPLC was carried out on an analytical SEC250 column, fitted with a guard column and an in-line absorbance detector, using 0.2 M sodium phosphate pH 6.8 as eluent and 1 mL/min as the flow rate. The product was also analyzed by spectrophotometric absorbance scan in the 260-540 nm region. Absorbance at 360 nm was correlated with that obtained with a CPT-11 standard to determine the CPT concentration in the conjugate. Absorbance at 280 nm, corrected for spillover from CPT derivative, was used to calculate the antibody concentration. This way, the CPT derivative-to-IgG molar ratio was determined. The product was mixed with 10% v/v of 1 M sucrose, aliquoted in 1 mg and 0.1 mg lots, and lyophilized. The lyophilized preparations were stored in freezer after argon flush.

Example-8 A General Method for the Preparation of Aminopolycarboxylate-Appended Bifunctional CPT(s), Suitable for Conjugation to Lysine or Thiol Group on an Antibody The general approach is shown in Scheme-4. Briefly, CPT and 10-hydroxy-CPT were converted to the corresponding C-20-O-glycinate by the method of Singer (supra). In a parallel synthesis, isothiocyanatobenzyl DTPA penta t-butyl ester was generated from the corresponding amine precursor, and then coupled to S-trityl cysteine. Flash chromatographic purification gave the intermediate 11 (mass spectrum: M+Na m/e 1207; M−H: 1183). Intermediate 11 was then coupled to the CPT derivative 9. TFA-mediated deprotection of t-butyl groups of carboxylates and S-trityl group, using scavengers to capture t-butyl cation, then furnished the DTPA-appended bifunctional CPT derivative (R═H or OH), suitable for conjugating to maleimide groups appended to IgG. The thiol group is also derivatized with excess divinylsulfone to produce an intermediate possessing a vinylsulfone group, which is suitable for conjugating to thiol groups of disulfide-reduced antibodies. Intermediate 13 is another example of an aminopolycarboxylate which can be used in place of isothiocyanatobenzyl DTPA in these transformations. Example-9 Method for the Preparation of SN-38 Conjugates SN-38 is the active drug which is metabolically converted, in vivo, from the prodrug CPT-11 (Liehr, Giovanella, Verschraegen (eds) (supra). SN-38 is the active chemotherapeutic drug which is 3 orders of magnitude more potent than CPT-11 in inhibiting topoisomerase I activity. Bifunctional SN-38, suitable for antibody conjugation is simply prepared as follows: [CPT-11]-20-O-valinate, with its valine N-terminus protected as BOC, is selectively cleaved at its C-10-carbamate using one equivalent of a base such as hydroxide. “Anhydrous hydroxide”, such as that derived from 2 equivalents of potassium t-butoxide and one equivalent of water (Gassman and Schenk, J. Org. Chem., 42:918-920 (1977)), is advantageously used for this purpose. The valinate ester of CPT has been shown to be stable to 1 equivalent of 1N aq. sodium hydroxide for at least 1 hour. This way, the C-10-carbamate is selectively cleaved. The amino group of the valine moiety is then converted to isothiocyanate, and coupled to the peptide template MCC-Gly-Lys-Lys(R′)—NH2. Alternatively, SN-38 itself is derivatized by first protecting the C10-hydroxyl group as an acid sensitive derivative, such as methoxytrityl derivative. The C20-hydroxyl group is then converted to the valinate ester. At this point, the methoxytrityl group at C-10 position is removed. A different option would be to first prepare the 20-valinate ester (or any other ester) derivative of SN-38 via protection of C-10 hydroxyl as the corresponding ‘BOC’ ester, derivatization of 20-hydroxyl group, and deprotection. This is then followed by treatment with trimethylsilyl chloride to derivatize both C-10 hydroxyl and the amino group of the ester at C-20, reacting with amine-reactive heterobifunctional cross-linker, such as maleimide-PEG-NHS, and deprotecting trimethylsilyl group at C-10 position. The above approach is not limited to CPT derivatives, and is applicable to other hydrophobic drugs such as paclitaxel, geldanamycin, and the like.
