Field of the Invention The present invention relates generally to compositions that can be used to improve the skin's visual appearance. In particular, the present invention concerns topical skin care compositions that include kakadu plum (Terminalia ferdinandiana) extract and/or acai berry extract (Euterpe oleracea). B. Description of Related Art With ageing, chronic exposure to adverse environmental factors, or malnutrition, the visual appearance, physical properties, and physiological functions of skin can change in ways that are considered visually undesirable. The most notable and obvious changes include the development of fine lines and wrinkles, loss of elasticity, increased sagging, loss of firmness, loss of color evenness or tone, coarse surface texture, and mottled pigmentation. Less obvious, but measurable changes which occur as skin ages or endures chronic environmental insult include a general reduction in cellular and tissue vitality, reduction in cell replication rates, reduced cutaneous blood flow, reduced moisture content, accumulated errors in structure and function, alterations in the normal regulation of common biochemical pathways, and a reduction in the skin's ability to remodel and repair itself. Many of the alterations in appearance and function of the skin are caused by changes in the outer epidermal layer of the skin, while others are caused by changes in the lower dermis. Several different approaches have been used to treat damaged skin caused by aging, environmental factors, chemicals, or malnutrition. One approach involves the use of specific agents to directly stimulate or inhibit selected biochemical targets. Examples include the use of retinoids to stimulate collagen and glycosaminoglycan synthesis by fibroblasts (Schiltz, et al., 1986). Another approach is to use agents or processes that stimulate the rate at which the epidermis replaces itself, a process known as epidermal cell renewal. Increases in epidermal cell renewal rates usually result from a more rapid rate of replication of epidermal basal cells, and can be caused by diverse stimuli such as chemical or physical injury, adverse environmental conditions, or direct stimulators of basal cell division. Some examples of chemical injury include allergic or non-allergic contact irritation, pH extremes, or interaction of the stratum corneum with household or industrial chemicals or pollutants. Physical injury can include skin abrasion, friction (i.e. on the soles and heels of the feet), or removal of the stratum corneum by physical exfoliation (i.e. cosmetic masks) or by tape stripping. Agents that directly or indirectly stimulate basal cell division include retinoids and barrier disrupters. For example, U.S. Patent No. 5,720,963 discloses that a combination of hydroxy acids, retinoids, and cerebrosides causes chronic injury to the stratum corneum and results in epidermal and dermal repair of the structurally-deteriorated skin. U.S. Patent No. 6,495,126, for example, uses a combination of surfactants and chelating agents to stimulate an endogenous stratum corneum chymotryptic proteinase that causes a loosening of corneocytes, resulting in an increased rate of epidermal replacement and chronic anti-aging benefits. Adverse environmental exposures that can result in more rapid epidermal turnover rates include UVA, UVB, and IR radiation from the sun and cold coupled with low relative humidity (i.e. low dew point). Several of the above methods have been shown to have various drawbacks, such as significant irritation to the skin or skin toxicity. In addition, most of these methods involve the invocation of chronic damage to the skin, which sets up repair mechanisms. For most of the existing treatments, there will be a period of time, up to several weeks or months, during which the skin becomes irritated and after which tolerance sets in and the symptoms of irritation may decrease and/or cease. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention overcomes deficiencies in the art by providing compositions that can be used in skin treatment applications. The compositions of the present invention can include kakadu plum extract and/or acai berry extract. Further, as shown in the figures and examples (which are incorporated into this section by reference), the inventors have discovered that the combination of kakadu plum extract and acai berry extract produce synergistic and complimentary effects that are beneficial to skin.

DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS In today's image conscious society, people are continually looking for a product that can improve the visual appearance of their skin. Often times, aged skin, uneven skin tone, or skin damaged by environmental factors such as UV light, chronic sun exposure, environmental pollutants, chemicals, disease pathologies, or smoking, is associated with unattractive skin. Previous attempts to improve the visual appearance of skin has been shown to have various drawbacks such as skin irritation and prolonged recovery periods. The present invention is an effective alternative to the use of retinoid compounds or other compositions and ingredients currently used to treat aged skin, environmentally-damaged skin, uneven skin tone, and other skin conditions. In one non-limiting aspect, the present invention can be used to improve the skin's visual appearance, physiological functions, clinical properties, or biophysical properties by providing kakadu plum extract and/or acai berry extract containing compositions. These and other aspect of the present invention are described in further detail below. A. Kakadu Plum Extract Kakadu plum (Terminalia ferdinandiana), also called Billygoat plum, Gubinge, or Murunga, is a flowing plant from the family Combretacae. Kakadu plum can be found in the tropical woodlands from northwestern Australia to eastern Arnhem Land. This fruit has a high vitamin C concentration, containing up to 4000 mg of vitamin C per 100 g of fruit. Kakadu plum also has a high ORAC value. Kakadu plum also includes phytochemicals such as gallic acid, ellagic acid, and related compounds. These phytochemicals have antioxidant properties that have been implicated in cancer inhibition. Gallic acid has an antibacterial, antiviral and antifungul activities and also shows anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, anti-mutigenic and anti-bronchodilatory activities. Ellagic acid has anti-carcinogenic effects against a wide range of carcinogens in many human tissues. Kakadu plum extract is available commercially and can also be isolated by a person of ordinary skill in the art using standard isolation techniques. For instance, kakadu plum can be disrupted by mechanical means which results in a puree. The puree is then processed to be substantially free of impurities or undesired solids, e.g., stems. The puree can then poured into a shallow vessel and quickly exposed to low temperature, i.e., flash frozen, for example at -20° C. or lower, preferably under a vacuum for removal of water content (lyophilization). The resultant plum extract can then be used in the compositions of the present invention. Alternatively, U.S. Publication No. 2005/0163880, which is incorporated by reference, describes an additional non-limiting method of preparing kakadu plum powder. In summary, the method includes: disintegrating kakadu plum fruit; treating the disintegrated kakadu plum material with enzymes to at least partially digest the material; juicing the kakadu plum material and drying the juice to produce a powder. In other non-limiting aspects, the kakadu plum extract can further be enriched with ingredients that have beneficial properties for skin. Non-limiting examples of such ingredients include those listed throughout this specification, including for, example, antioxidants, vitamins, minerals, and amino acids. In certain aspects, enriching the kakadu plum can increase the ORAC value of the kakadu plum extract and/or the compositions of the present invention. B. Acai Berry Extract Acai berries can be obtained from a species of a palm tree (Euterpe oleracea) that grows in the Amazon rain forests of Brazil. The fruit is born in bunches of 3 to 8. The Acai berry contains vitamins, minerals, and essential fatty acids. This list includes vitamin B1, B2, and B3, vitamin C, vitamin E, iron, potassium, phosphorus, calcium, essential fatty acids Omega 6 and Omega 9, all the essential amino acids, flavonoids and protein. Flavonoids found in the acai berry include anthocyanins such as proanthrocyanadin, cyanidin-3-glucoside and cyanidin-3-rutinoside. Acai berries are also high in polyphenols. It has also been reported that acai berry has up to 33 times the antioxidant content as red wine grapes and has the highest ORAC value for any berry. Acai berry extract is available commercially from a variety of companies, including, for example, Global Laboratories and NHS Labs Inc., Eagle, Idaho. Additionally, a person of ordinary skill in the art would be able to isolate acai berry extract from whole acai berry by using any suitable method known in the art. In one non-limiting example, acai berry can be disrupted by mechanical means which results in a puree. The puree is then processed to be substantially free of impurities or undesired solids, e.g., stems. The puree can then poured into a shallow vessel and quickly exposed to low temperature, i.e., flash frozen, for example at -20° C. or lower, preferably under a vacuum for removal of water content (lyophilization). The resultant berry extract can then be used in the compositions of the present invention. In other non-limiting aspects, the acai berry extract can further be enriched with ingredients that have beneficial properties for skin. Non-limiting examples of such ingredients include those listed throughout this specification, including for, example, antioxidants, vitamins, minerals, and amino acids. In certain aspects, enriching the acai berry can increase the ORAC value of the acai berry extract and/or the compositions of the present invention. C. Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity Oxygen Radical Absorption (or Absorbance) Capacity (ORAC) is an assay that measures the antioxidant activity of an ingredient or composition. In essence, it can quantify the degree and length of time it takes to inhibit the action of an oxidizing agent such as oxygen radicals that are known to cause damage cells (e.g., skin cells). The ORAC value of the kakadu plum extract, acai berry extract and compositions of the present invention can be determined by methods known to those of ordinary skill in the art (seeU.S. Publication Nos. 2004/0109905 and 2005/0163880; Cao et al. (1993)), all of which are incorporated by reference). In summary, the assay described in Cao et al. (1993) measures the ability of antioxidant compounds in test materials to inhibit the decline of B-phycoerythrm (B-PE) fluorescence that is induced by a peroxyl radical generator, AAPH. D.

EXAMPLE 2 Bioefficacy of Kakadu Plum Extract As An Anti-oxidant The ability of kakadu plum extract to act as an anti-oxidant was evaluted in terms of its ability to (1) reduce existing internal oxidation in cells; and (2) reduce external oxidative damage to cells. Peroxide Assay: Cellular peroxides are measured flow cytometrically using the peroxide-specific dye, 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA). DCFH-DA is initially non-fluorescent and is rapidly concentrated within living cells by an enzyme-dependent process. Following modification by cellular peroxides, this dye exhibits an intense green fluorescence when excited by laser light. Basal peroxide production, generated by normal cellular metabolism, will induce a gradual development of low levels of peroxide-specific cellular fluorescence. As such, a measurement of this fluorescence without any treatment can act as a negative control for comparative purposes. Furthermore, extracellular peroxides (i.e., H2O2, added exogenously) can readily permeate the cell membrane and cause a rapid and dramatic increase in the peroxide-specific fluorescence of the cell. This assay can be used to characterize the effect of test articles on basal peroxide levels and/or the ability of extracellular peroxides to influence cellular peroxide levels. If the test article functions as an antioxidant, this assay can also be used to determine if the test article can permeate the cell membrane to quench intracellular peroxide or if it can only affect extracellular peroxide levels. Human adult epidermal keratinocytes were cultured at 37°C and 5.0% CO2 in standard growth medium. At 70-80% confluent, cells were removed from plates using 0.025% Trypsin/EDTA. When the cells become rounded, the Trypsin/EDTA containing cells are removed from the culture dish and neutralized. Cells were centrifuged and the resulting pellet resuspended in media to generate a single cell suspension. Cellular peroxides were measured cytometrically by loading cultured keratinocytes with DCFH-DA (10mM final conc.). Cells were treated with increasing concentrations of plant extract in triplicate followed with or without exogenous addition of hydrogen peroxide (60mM). The level of induced or un-induced cellular peroxide was analyzed. To confirm that antioxidant activity of the cells could be adduced, positive controls for an antioxidant response using Trolox™ (an analog of vitamin E and a known antioxidant) were employed. The peroxide-specific fluorescence of the cells was measured using a flow cytometer and the Mean Fluorescence Intensity (MFI). Debris was excluded from analysis using a gate created on a dual-parameter light scattergram. These experiments were repeated in triplicate, and the percent reduction of oxidative damage compared to untreated control was calculated (FIG. 1). Kakadu plum extract reduced oxidative damage from external insults. EXAMPLE 3 Collagen Production in Human Fibroblast Dermal Cells in the Presence of Kakadu Plum Extract The ability of kakadu plum extract to increase collagen production in human fibroblast dermal cells was studied. Collagen production protocol: Normal human dermal fibroblast (NHDF) cells were grown to subconfluence from a frozen vial in tissue culture flasks (T25's). Two confluent T25's were trypsinized, washed, resuspended to 16 mls and seeded heavily into a 96 well plate (200 µl/well) (Columns 4 - 12 only). Cells were allowed to grow overnight or until the cells reached 100% confluence. Upon reaching confluence, the spent media was aspirated and 200 µl of fresh media with or without samples of interest (in triplicate) were added. The liquid extract in FIG. 2 is 1.0% (20µl of 100X stock) and 0.1% (2µl of 100X stock) kakadu extract and was diluted into a final volume of 200µl NHDF growth medium (note that the liquid extract is listed at 20-30% W/W with 10-20% denatured alcohol and >50% 1,3 butylene glycol. A 10% stock of this extract was prepared by dilution is water (2-3% fruit extract) which was further diluted in the assay to 1.0% and 0.1% (0.2-0.3% and 0.02-0.03% kakadu fruit extract, based upon the amount in the original extract). One set of cells was treated with L-ascorbic acid (vitamin C), an agent known to increase collagen production, at a final concentration of 18 µg/ml in triplicate as a positive control. Cells were incubated for 3 days in the presence of the samples at 37°C/5%CO2. Supernatants were harvested and frozen at -80°C until assayed with the Procollagen Peptide (PIP) kit (Takara Bio Inc.), designed to measure procollagen peptide in the range of 40 to 640 ng/ml. The cells in this system can be expected to produce at least 3000 ng/ml of procollagen peptide (media control). Tissue culture supernatants need to be diluted 1:100 with the sample diluent included in the kit. The protocol supplied with the kit was followed. Brief instructions are provided: Allow plate to reach room temperature before opening the foil package. Allow the supernatants to thaw to room temp. slowly.Add 1 ml dH2O to Vial 3: PIP Standard - Mix gently and allow to stand at room temp. for 10 min. prior to use.Add 11 ml H2O to Vial 2: Antibody-POD Conjugate - Mix gently and allow to stand at room temp. for 10 min. prior to use.Prepare Standard curve as directed in protocol booklet.Dilute all supernatants 1:40 with sample diluent (supplied with kit).Transfer 100 µl of POD conjugate/well with a multichannel pipet. Subsequently add 20 µl of diluted standard or sample/well in triplicate.Incubate (covered) for 3 hours at 37°C.Wash plate 4 times with 400 µl of wash solution (see protocol booklet for complete washing instructions).Add 100 µl substrate solution/well and incubate at room temp for 15 min.Add 100 µl stop solution/well. Tap plate gently to mix.Measure absorbance at 450 nm with a plate reader within 1 hour.The standard curve is plotted using a 4 parameter curve fit. The concentration of the procollagen peptide was determined from the standard curve. The results from the standard curve must be multiplied by the dilution factor to yield the total number of ng/ml of the procollagen peptide. Collagen production in dermal cells in the presence of 1% kakadu plum extract increased significantly compared to untreated control dermal cells (FIG. 2). EXAMPLE 4 Reducing Inflammation in Human Epidermal Keratinocytes Using Kakadu Plum Extract The ability of kakadu plum extract to reduce inflammation in human epidermal keratinocytes was studied using a cytokine array assay. Cytokine array: Human epidermal keratinocytes were cultured to 70-80% confluency. The media in the plate was aspirated and 0.025% trypsin/EDTA was added. When the cells became rounded, the culture dish was gently tapped to release the cells. The trypsin/EDTA containing cells were removed from the culture dish and neutralized. Cells were centrifuged for 5 min. at 180 x g. The cells formed a pellet and the supernatant was aspirated. The resulting pellet was resuspended in EpiLife™ media (Cascade Biologies). The cells were seeded in 6-well plates at approximately 10-20% confluency. After the cells became approximately 80% confluent, the media was aspirated and 1.0 ml of EpiLife™, along with phorbol 13-Myristate 12-acetate ("PMA") (a known inducer of inflammation) and the test article dilution were added to two replicate wells (i.e., 1.0% (100µl of 100X stock) and 0.1% (10µl of 100X stock) kakadu extract as prepared in paragraph [0034] above was diluted into a final volume of 1 ml EpiLife Growth Medium). The media was gently swirled to ensure adequate mixing. In addition, 1.0 ml of EpiLife™ was added to the control wells, with and without additional PMA. The plates were then incubated at 37±1°C and 5.0±1% CO2 for approximately 5 hours after dosing. Following this 5-hour incubation, all media was collected in conical tubes and frozen at -70°C and the frozen media was subsequently shipped to the sponsor on dry ice. 16-pad FAST slides arrayed in triplicate with 16 anti-cytokine antibodies plus experimental controls were purchased from Whatman BioSciences. On the day of the analysis, a 16-pad hybridization chamber was attached to the slides, and the slides were placed into a FASTFrame (4 slides per frame) for processing. Arrays were blocked for 15 min. at room temp. using 70 ml S&S Protein Array Blocking buffer (Whatman Schleicher and Scheull). Blocking buffer was removed and 70 ml of each supernatant sample was added to each array. Arrays were incubated for 3 hours at room temp. with gentle agitation. Arrays were washed 3 times with TBS-T. Arrays were treated with 70 ml of an antibody cocktail, containing one biotinylated antibody corresponding to each of the arrayed capture antibodies. Arrays were incubated for 1 hour at room temp. with gentle agitation. Arrays were washed 3 times with TBS-T. Arrays were incubated with 70 ml of a solution containing streptavidin-Cy5 conjugate for 1 hour at room temp. with gentle agitation. Arrays were washed 3 times with TBS-T, quickly rinsed in de-ionized water, and dried. Slides were imaged in a Perkin-Elmer ScanArray 4000 confocal fluorescent imaging system. Array images were saved as 16-bit TIF files, with 10 micron pixel resolution. Images were analyzed using Imaging Research ArrayVision software. Briefly, spot intensities were determined by subtracting background signal. Spot replicates from each sample condition were averaged and then compared to the appropriate controls. Microsoft Excel and GraphPad Prism were used for additional analysis and data presentation. The percent reduction in certain inflammatory cytokines can be seen in FIG. 3. While kakadu plum extract reduced the inflammatory response associated with several types of cytokines, the extract is particularly effective at reducing the inflammatory responses of IL-8 and IL-6. In this manner, then, the reduction in inflammatory responses as seen with kakadu plum extract and acai berry extract are complementary (seeFIG. 7).

EXAMPLE 6 Bioefficacy of Acai Berry Extract: Action As An Anti-oxidant The ability of acai berry extract to act as an anti-oxidant was evaluted in terms of its ability to (1) reduce existing internal oxidation in cells; and (2) reduce external oxidative damage to cells. The Peroxide Assay described in Example 2 was used, wherein H202, DCFH-DA dye and acai berry extract (in place of kakadu plum extract) were used in the same amounts. These experiments were repeated in triplicate, and the percent reduction of oxidative damage was calculated (FIG. 5). Acai berry extract reduces oxidative damage from both internal and external insults. EXAMPLE 7 Collagen Production in Human Fibroblast Dermal Cells in the Presence of Acai Berry Extract The ability of acai berry extract to increase collagen production in human fibroblast dermal cells was studied. The collagen production protocol as described in Example 3 was employed, utilizing the same amount of acai berry extract in place of the kakadu plum extract. Collagen production in dermal cells in the presence of 1% acai berry extract increased significantly compared to control dermal cells (FIG. 6), but less than the percent collagen produced in the presence of the same amount of kakadu plum extract as shown in FIG. 2. EXAMPLE 8 Reducing Inflammation in Human Epidermal Keratinocytes Using Acai Berry Extract The ability of acai berry extract to reduce inflammation in human epidermal keratinocytes was studied using a cytokine array assay. The cytokine assay of Example 4 was employed, using acai berry extract in place of kakadu plum extract. The percent reduction of certain inflammatory cytokines can be seen in FIG. 6. While acai berry extract reduced the inflammatory response associated with several types of cytokines, the extract is particularly effective at reducing the inflammatory responses of IL-2 and ICAM-6. the reduction in inflammatory responses as seen with kakadu plum extract and acai berry extract are complementary (FIG. 7).

EXAMPLE 10 Determining Efficacy of the Compositions of the Present Invention The efficacy of compositions of the present inventions can be determined by methods known to those of ordinary skill in the art. The following are non-limiting procedures that can be used in the context of the present invention. It should be recognized that other testing procedures can be used, including, for example, objective and subjective procedures. Skin moisture/hydration can be measured by using impedance measurements with the Nova Dermal Phase Meter. The impedance meter measures changes in skin moisture content. The outer layer of the skin has distinct electrical properties. When skin is dry it conducts electricity very poorly. As it becomes more hydrated increasing conductivity results. Consequently, changes in skin impedance (related to conductivity) can be used to assess changes in skin hydration. The unit can be calibrated according to instrument instructions for each testing day. A notation of temperature and relative humidity can also be made. Subjects can be evaluated as follows : prior to measurement they can equilibrate in a room with defined humidity (e.g., 30-50%) and temperature (e.g., 68-72C). Three separate impedance readings can be taken on each side of the face, recorded, and averaged. The T5 setting can be used on the impedance meter which averages the impedance values of every five seconds application to the face. Changes can be reported with statistical variance and significance. Skin clarity and the reduction in freckles and age spots can be evaluated using a Minolta Chromometer. Changes in skin color can be assessed to determine irritation potential due to product treatment using the a* values of the Minolta Chroma Meter. The a* value measures changes in skin color in the red region. This is used to determine whether a composition is inducing irritation. The measurements can be made on each side of the face and averaged, as left and right facial values. Skin clarity can also be measured using the Minolta Meter. The measurement is a combination of the a*, b, and L values of the Minolta Meter and is related to skin brightness, and correlates well with skin smoothness and hydration. Skin reading is taken as above. In one non-limiting aspect, skin clarity can be described as L/C where C is chroma and is defined as (a2+ b2)1/2. Skin dryness, surface fine lines, skin smoothness, and skin tone can be evaluated with clinical grading techniques. For example, clinical grading of skin dryness can be determined by a five point standard Kligman Scale: (0) skin is soft and moist; (1) skin appears normal with no visible dryness; (2) skin feels slightly dry to the touch with no visible flaking; (3) skin feels dry, tough, and has a whitish appearance with some scaling; and (4) skin feels very dry, rough, and has a whitish appearance with scaling. Evaluations can be made independently by two clinicians and averaged. Clinical grading of skin tone can be performed via a ten point analog numerical scale: (10) even skin of uniform, pinkish brown color. No dark, erythremic, or scaly patches upon examination with a hand held magnifying lens. Microtexture of the skin very uniform upon touch; (7) even skin tone observed without magnification. No scaly areas, but slight discolorations either due to pigmentation or erythema. No discolorations more than 1 cm in diameter; (4) both skin discoloration and uneven texture easily noticeable. Slight scaliness. Skin rough to the touch in some areas; and (1) uneven skin coloration and texture. Numerous areas of scaliness and discoloration, either hypopigmented, erythremic or dark spots. Large areas of uneven color more than 1 cm in diameter. Evaluations were made independently by two clinicians and averaged. Clinical grading of skin smoothness can be analyzed via a ten point analog numerical scale: (10) smooth, skin is moist and glistening, no resistance upon dragging finger across surface; (7) somewhat smooth, slight resistance; (4) rough, visibly altered, friction upon rubbing; and (1) rough, flaky, uneven surface. Evaluations were made independently by two clinicians and averaged. Skin smoothness and wrinkle reduction can also be assessed visually by using the methods disclosed in Packman et al. (1978). For example, at each subject visit, the depth, shallowness and the total number of superficial facial lines (SFLs) of each subject can be carefully scored and recorded. A numerical score was obtained by multiplying a number factor times a depth/width/length factor. Scores are obtained for the eye area and mouth area (left and right sides) and added together as the total wrinkle score. Skin firmness can be measured using a Hargens ballistometer, a device that evaluates the elasticity and firmness of the skin by dropping a small body onto the skin and recording its first two rebound peaks. The ballistometry is a small lightweight probe with a relatively blunt tip (4 square mm-contact area) was used. The probe penetrates slightly into the skin and results in measurements that are dependent upon the properties of the outer layers of the skin, including the stratum corneum and outer epidermis and some of the dermal layers. Skin softness/suppleness can be evaluated using the Gas Bearing Electrodynamometer, an instrument that measures the stress/strain properties of the skin. The viscoelastic properties of skin correlate with skin moisturization. Measurements can be obtained on the predetermined site on the cheek area by attaching the probe to the skin surface with double-stick tape. A force of approximately 3.5 gm can be applied parallel to the skin surface and the skin displacement is accurately measured. Skin suppleness can then be calculated and is expressed as DSR (Dynamic Spring Rate in gm/mm). The appearance of lines and wrinkles on the skin can be evaluated using replicas, which is the impression of the skin's surface. Silicone rubber like material can be used. The replica can be analyzed by image analysis. Changes in the visibility of lines and wrinkles can be objectively quantified via the taking of silicon replicas form the subjects' face and analyzing the replicas image using a computer image analysis system. Replicas can be taken from the eye area and the neck area, and photographed with a digital camera using a low angle incidence lighting. The digital images can be analyzed with an image processing program and the are of the replicas covered by wrinkles or fine lines was determined. The surface contour of the skin can be measured by using the profilometer/Stylus method. This includes either shining a light or dragging a stylus across the replica surface. The vertical displacement of the stylus can be fed into a computer via a distance transducer, and after scanning a fixed length of replica a cross-sectional analysis of skin profile can be generated as a two-dimensional curve. This scan can be repeated any number of times along a fix axis to generate a simulated 3-D picture of the skin. Ten random sections of the replicas using the stylus technique can be obtained and combined to generate average values. The values of interest include Ra which is the arithmetic mean of all roughness (height) values computed by integrating the profile height relative to the mean profile height. Rt which is the maximum vertical distance between the highest peak and lowest trough, and Rz which is the mean peak amplitude minus the mean peak height. Values are given as a calibrated value in mm. Equipment should be standardized prior to each use by scanning metal standards of know values. Ra Value can be computed by the following equation: Ra = Standardize roughness; lm = the traverse (scan) length; and y = the absolute value of the location of the profile relative to the mean profile height (x-axis). In other non-limiting aspects, the efficacy of the compositions of the present invention can be evaluated by using a skin analog, such as, for example, MELANODERM™. Melanocytes, one of the cells in the skin analog, stain positively when exposed to L-dihydroxyphenyl alanine (L-DOPA), a precursor of melanin. The skin analog, MELANODERM™, can be treated with a variety of bases containing the compositions and whitening agents of the present invention or with the base alone as a control. Alternatively, an untreated sample of the skin analog can be used as a control. All of the compositions and/or methods disclosed and claimed in this specification can be made and executed without undue experimentation in light of the present disclosure. While the compositions and methods of this invention have been described in terms of particular embodiments, it will be apparent to those of skill in the art that variations may be applied to the compositions and/or methods and in the steps or in the sequence of steps of the method described herein without departing from the concept, spirit and scope of the invention. More specifically, it will be apparent that certain agents which are both chemically and physiologically related may be substituted for the agents described herein while the same or similar results would be achieved. All such similar substitutes and modifications apparent to those skilled in the art are deemed to be within the spirit, scope and concept of the invention as defined by the appended claims.
