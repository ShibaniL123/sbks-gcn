Example 86A
4-{[(6-Bromo-3-methyl-2-phenylquinolin-4-yl)carbonyl]amino}bicyclo[2.2.2]octane-1-carbonyl chloride
At RT, a drop of DMF and then, slowly, 0.14 ml (1.60 mmol) of oxalyl chloride were added to a suspension of 395 mg (0.80 mmol) of the compound from Example 1 in 10 ml of dichloromethane, and the mixture was then stirred at RT for 1 h. The mixture was then concentrated under reduced pressure, the residue was once more taken up in dichloromethane and the mixture was then re-concentrated under reduced pressure. This procedure was repeated several times. The residue was finally dried under reduced pressure. This gave 410 mg (100% of theory) of the title compound which were used directly in the subsequent chemical conversions.
