TECHNICAL FIELD The technical field relates to a sugar product and fabricating method thereof. BACKGROUND The world is facing problems such as the gradual extraction and depletion of petroleum reserves, and changes to the earth's atmosphere due to the greenhouse effect. In order to ensure the sustainability of human life, it has become a world trend to gradually decrease the use of petrochemical energy and petroleum feedstock and to develop new sources of renewable energy and materials. Lignocellulose is the main ingredient of biomass, which is the most abundant organic substance in the world. Lignocellulose mainly consists of 38-50% cellulose, 23-32% hemicellulose and 15-25% lignin. Cellulose generates glucose through hydrolysis. However, it is difficult for chemicals to enter the interior of cellulose molecules for depolymerization due to strong intermolecular and intramolecular hydrogen bonding and Van de Waal forces and the complex aggregate structure of cellulose with high-degree crystallinity. The main methods of hydrolyzing cellulose are enzyme hydrolysis and acid hydrolysis. However, there is significant imperfection in these two technologies, therefore, it is difficult to apply widely. Generally speaking, enzyme hydrolysis can be carried out at room temperature, which is an environmentally friendly method due to the rarity of byproducts, no production of anti-sugar fermentation substances, and integration with the fermentation process. However, a complicated pretreatment process is required, hydrolytic activity is low, the reaction rate is slow, and cellulose hydrolysis enzyme is expensive. Dilute acid hydrolysis generally uses comparatively cheap sulfuric acid as a catalyst, but it must operate in a corrosion-resistant pressure vessel at more than 200°C, requiring high-level equipment; simultaneously, the temperature of the dilute acid hydrolysis is high, the byproduct thereof is plentiful, and the sugar yield is low. Concentrated acid hydrolysis can operate at lower temperature and normal pressure. However, there are problems of strong corrosivity of concentrated acid, complications in the post-treatment process of the hydrolyzed solution, large consumption of acid, and difficulties with recycling, among other drawbacks. WO 2006/007691 A1 discloses a sugar product which comprises glucose and a sugar monomer selected from the group consisting of xylose, arabinose, mannose, galactose and a combination thereof and acetic acid and also comprises an inorganic salt and acetate salt.

One embodiment of the disclosure provides a method for fabricating a sugar product, comprising: mixing formic acid or acetic acid and lithium chloride, magnesium chloride, calcium chloride, zinc chloride, iron chloride, lithium bromide, magnesium bromide, calcium bromide, zinc bromide, iron bromide, or heteropoly acid to form a mixing solution; adding a cellulosic biomass to the mixing solution for a dissolution reaction; and adding water to the mixing solution for a hydrolysis reaction to obtain a sugar product. A detailed description is given in the following embodiments. DETAILED DESCRIPTION In the following detailed description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the disclosed embodiments. It will be apparent, however, that one or more embodiments may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are schematically shown in order to simplify the drawing. In one embodiment of the disclosure, a sugar product is provided. The sugar product comprises a sugar mixture, an acid compound, and a salt compound. The sugar mixture comprises glucose, xylose, mannose, arabinose and oligosaccharides thereof with a weight ratio of about 2-15wt% in the sugar product. The acid compound may comprise formic acid or acetic acid with a weight ratio of about 48-97wt% in the sugar product. The salt compound may comprise lithium chloride, magnesium chloride, calcium chloride, zinc chloride, iron chloride, lithium bromide, magnesium bromide, calcium bromide, zinc bromide, or iron bromide with a weight ratio of about 1-50wt% in the sugar product. In one embodiment of the disclosure, a method for fabricating a sugar product is provided, comprising the following steps. First, formic acid or acetic acid and lithium chloride, magnesium chloride, calcium chloride, zinc chloride, iron chloride, lithium bromide, magnesium bromide, calcium bromide, zinc bromide, iron bromide, or heteropoly acid are mixed to form a mixing solution. A cellulosic biomass is added to the mixing solution for a dissolution reaction. Water is added to the mixing solution for a hydrolysis reaction to obtain a sugar product. The formic acid has a weight ratio of about 50-97wt% in the mixing solution. The lithium chloride or lithium bromide has a weight ratio of about 5-20wt% or 10-20wt% in the mixing solution. The magnesium chloride or magnesium bromide has a weight ratio of about 10-30wt% or 15-20wt% in the mixing solution. The calcium chloride or calcium bromide has a weight ratio of about 12-40wt% or 12-30wt% in the mixing solution. The zinc chloride or zinc bromide has a weight ratio of about 5-45wt% or 20-30wt% in the mixing solution. The iron chloride or iron bromide has a weight ratio of about 1-50wt% or 5-10wt% in the mixing solution. The heteropoly acid may comprise H3PW12O40, H4SiWi2O40, H3PMo12O40 or H4SiMo12O40 with a weight ratio of about 1-5wt% or 2-5wt% in the mixing solution. The cellulosic biomass may be derived from wood, grass, leaves, algae, waste paper, corn stalks, corn cobs, rice straw, rice husk, wheat straw, bagasse, bamboo, or crop stems. The cellulosic biomass may comprise cellulose, hemicellulose, or lignin with a weight ratio of about 1-20wt% or 5-15wt% in the mixing solution. The dissolution reaction has a reaction temperature of about 40-90 or 50-70 and a reaction time of about 20-360 minutes or 30-120 minutes. In the hydrolysis reaction, the amount of water added is larger than the total molar equivalent of monosaccharides hydrolyzed from the cellulosic biomass. The hydrolysis reaction has a reaction temperature of about 50-150°C or 60-105 °C and a reaction time of about 30-180 minutes or 30-120 minutes. The sugar product fabricated by the method may comprise a sugar mixture, an acid compound, and a salt compound. The sugar mixture may comprise glucose, xylose, mannose, arabinose and oligosaccharides thereof with a weight ratio of about 2-15wt% in the sugar product. The acid compound may comprise formic acid or acetic acid with a weight ratio of about 48-97wt% in the sugar product. The salt compound may comprise lithium chloride, magnesium chloride, calcium chloride, zinc chloride, iron chloride, lithium bromide, magnesium bromide, calcium bromide, zinc bromide, or iron bromide with a weight ratio of about 1-50wt% in the sugar product. In one embodiment, the method further comprises adding inorganic acid to the mixing solution before, during or after the dissolution reaction. The inorganic acid may comprise sulfuric acid or hydrochloric acid. The inorganic acid has a weight ratio of about 1-2wt% in the mixing solution. When the inorganic acid is added, the adding amount of the chloride salt or the bromide salt may be reduced, for example, the weight ratio of the magnesium chloride, the magnesium bromide, the calcium chloride or the calcium bromide in the mixing solution may be reduced to about 1-10wt%, and the weight ratio of the lithium chloride, the lithium bromide, the zinc chloride, the zinc bromide, the iron chloride or the iron bromide in the mixing solution may be reduced to about 1-5wt%. In the disclosure, formic acid or acetic acid (weak acid) is mixed with lithium chloride, magnesium chloride, calcium chloride, zinc chloride, iron chloride, lithium bromide, magnesium bromide, calcium bromide, zinc bromide, or iron bromide to be utilized as a solvent with the characteristic of dissolving cellulose under low temperature (<90°C) and rapid reaction time (<6 hours) to generate a homogeneous liquid. In the disclosed method, cellulose is dissolved in the solvent formed by chloride salt or bromide salt and formic acid or acetic acid to generate a homogeneous liquid at 40-150°C, and a sugar product is further obtained through hydrolysis. This method achieves the technical goals of low temperature, normal pressure, rapid reaction time and high sugar yield and without use of a strong acid corrosion-resistant reactor.
