BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a dishwasher, and more particularly, to a dishwasher that can adjust a dish reception space of a basket for accommodating dishes. 2. Description of the Related Art Generally, a dishwasher is a home appliance that allows food leftovers on the surface of dishes to be washed by wash water sprayed at a high pressure from a spray nozzle. The wash water includes a wash tub defining a space in which dishes are washed and a sump disposed under the wash tub to store wash water. Wash water moves to the spray nozzle by the pumping action of a wash pump mounted in the sump, and wash water moved to the spray nozzle is sprayed at a high pressure through an spray hole formed at the end portion of the spray nozzle. Then, wash water sprayed at a high pressure hits the surfaces of dishes, allowing food leftovers on dishes to drop on the bottom of the wash tub. The dishwasher includes a basket for receiving dishes. Various kinds of dishes are provided to the basket, and dishes have various shapes according to the types of dishes. In this case, it is necessary to design the basket such that the basket can support various kinds of dishes with different shapes. Various sizes of baskets are disposed inside the wash tub in a multi-layer, enabling efficient utilization of the space. However, in order to receive dishes or cooking utensils with relatively large diameters, a user needs to secure an additional space. In this case, there is a limitation in that a portion of the baskets has to be removed to receive the large-sized dishes or cooking utensils.

The lower basket 300 may be divided into a first lower basket 300 and a second lower basket 300 that are disposed side by side at left and right sides. However, for convenience of explanation, the lower basket 300 will be exemplified as being integrally formed. The whole bottom of the lower basket 300 may be divided into a first lower bottom (not shown) located under the first upper basket 311 and a second lower bottom (not shown) located under the second upper basket 312. The first lower bottom and the second lower bottom may form the whole bottom of the lower basket 300. The first lower bottom may become the bottom of the first lower reception space SI. The second lower bottom may become the bottom of the second lower reception space S2. When the first upper basket 311 and the second upper basket 312 are disposed side by side, a space S3 may be formed over the first lower reception space SI. The space S3 may be a space between the bottom of the first upper basket 311 and the ceiling of the wash tub 4. A space S4 may be a space between the bottom of the second upper basket 312 and the ceiling of the wash tub 4. The heights of the first lower reception space SI and the second lower reception space S2 may be determined by a distance from an obstacle located on the top of the lower basket 300. For convenience of explanation, although the first upper basket 311 and the second upper basket 312 move, the first lower bottom and the second lower bottom will be defined as being not moved and deformed. The first and second lower reception spaces SI and S2 may be determined by a relation with an obstacle located on the top of the first and second lower bottoms that are defined as above. The first and second lower reception capacities may be determined by a relation with an obstacle located on the top of the first and second lower bottoms that are defined as above. For example, when the first upper basket 311 is removed from the wash tub 4, the first lower reception space SI may mean a space from the first lower bottom defined as above to the ceiling of the wash tub 4. As another example, when the first upper basket 311 is placed on the second upper basket 312, the first lower reception space SI may mean a space from the first lower bottom defined as above to the ceiling of the wash tub 4. In the above two examples, the first lower reception space SI may be recognized as being the same. In one embodiment, the first lower reception space SI may be formed between the first upper basket 311 and the lower basket 300. The first low reception space SI may be a space between the first lower bottom and the first upper basket 311 located over the first lower bottom. The second upper basket 312 may be disposed side by side with the first upper basket 311. The second lower reception space S2 may be formed between the second upper basket 312 and the lower basket 300. The second lower reception space S2 may be a space between the second lower bottom and the second upper basket 312. The movement parts 321 and 323 may be configured to move the first upper basket 311 to the second upper basket 312. The movement parts 321 and 323 may increase or decrease the first lower reception space SI. The movement parts 321 and 323 may increase the height from the first lower bottom on which dishes can be placed.

FIG. 12 is a view illustrating still another exemplary use of a dishwasher 1 according to an example of the present disclosure. FIG. 13 is a view illustrating even another exemplary use of a dishwasher 1 according to an example of the present disclosure. Referring to FIGS. 10 to 13, the dishwasher 1 may include a first upper basket 311 and a second upper basket that are disposed side by side. The height of the first upper basket 311 may be equal to the height of the second upper basket 312. The maximum height of a dish containable in the first upper basket 311 and the second upper basket 312 may be the sum of the heights Η2 and Η3. The dish reception capacities of the first upper basket 311 and the second upper basket 312 may be equal to each other. The dish reception spaces of the first upper basket 311 and the second upper basket 312 may be equal to each other. The spaces S3 and S4 may be equal to each other. In one embodiment, the dishwasher may include a first upper basket 311 that inclines to one side. The height of the first upper basket 311 may be obliquely formed. The height of a dish containable in the first upper basket 311 may be oblique. The first upper basket 311 may contain a dish, one side of which is higher than the other side. In one embodiment, the dishwasher 1 may include a first upper basket 311 and a second upper basket that is disposed at a higher location than the first upper basket 311. The first upper basket 311 may be disposed at a location diagonal to the second upper basket 312. The maximum height of a dish containable in the first upper basket 311 may be higher than the maximum height of a dish containable in the second upper basket 312. For example, the first upper basket 311 can contain rice bowls or soup bowls. The second upper basket 312 may contain spoons and chopsticks. In one embodiment, the dishwasher 1 may include a first upper basket 311 and a second upper basket that is disposed over the first upper basket 311. The maximum height of a dish containable in the lower basket 300 may be higher at one side of the lower basket. In this case, the maximum height of a dish containable at one side of the low basket 300 may become the height Η4. The maximum height of a dish containable at the other side of the low basket 300 may become the height HI minus the height Η2. A dishwasher according to an embodiment of the present invention has at least one of the following effects. First, the height of a basket can be adjusted according to a necessity of a user. Second, the capacity of dishes contained in the basket can be increased. Third, it is possible to prevent a user from removing baskets to increase a space between baskets. The effects of the present invention are not limited to the above; other effects that are not described herein will be clearly understood by the persons skilled in the art from the following claims. Hereinafter, the operation of the dish washer 1 configured as above will bedescribed as follows. A user may open the door 2 and may pull the frame 220 to the front side to expose the basket 200. The basket 200 may contain dishes. A user may adjust the height of the basket 200 according to a necessity. A user may obliquely place the basket 200. The adjustment part 230 may also be disposed on both front and rear sides of the frame 220. First, when a user increases the height of the basket 200, a user may pull the lever 237. The lever 237 may rotate the rotation protrusion 235. The rotation protrusions 235 may be connected to the connection part 233. The support part 231 may also rotate according to the rotation degree of the lever 237. The support part 231 may rotate on the rotation protrusion 235 from the lower end of the frame 220 to the upper end of the frame 220. The support part 231 may support the bottom of the basket 200. The support part 231 may lift the basket 200 in a direction of the lower end of the frame 220 to the upper end of the frame 220. The lever 237 may move toward the curved part 245 along the stopping part 243 that is upwardly and convexly curved. Since the lever 237 moving along the curved part 245 is bent toward the side surface of the curved part 245, the lever 237 may be inserted into and mounted in the curved part 245. Since the curved part 245 includes a protrusion step 244, the movement of the lever 237 may be limited. Accordingly, the basket 200 may be maintained at a certain height. A user may increase the height of the basket 200 using a plurality of adjustment parts 230. When a user reduces the height of the basket 200, a user may push the release part 247. On the whole, the holder 240 may be formed of an appropriately elastic material or may be formed to have a shape with an appropriate elasticity. Accordingly, when the release part 247 is pushed, the curved part 245 may also be pushed. The protrusion step 244 may also move downward together with the curved part 245. Accordingly, the lever 237 may be released from the protrusion step 244. Since the basket 200 applies a force to the support part 231 in the gravity direction, the support part 231 may naturally rotate. The rotation of the support 231 may also allow the lever 237 to rotate. The rotation of the lever 237 may be stopped by the limit part 249. Since the basket 200 also moves downward together with the support part 231, the height of the basket 200 may be lowered. Through the foregoing operation steps, a user may adjust only the height of one side of the basket 200 or may adjust the height of both sides of the basket 200. When the height of the basket 200 is adjusted, the height from the basket 200 to the ceiling of the wash tub 4 is also changed. Accordingly, the amount or height of dishes containable in the basket 200 can also be adjusted. Also, when the basket 200 is disposed in plurality at upper and lower sides and the height of the basket 200 disposed at the upper side varies, the dish reception capacity of the basket 200 disposed at the lower side can also be adjusted.
