Step 3: Synthesis of methyl 4-(4-(3-fluoro-4-(7-hydroxyhepta-1,3-diyn-1-yl)phenyl)-3,6-dihydropyridin-1(2H)-yl)-2-methyl-2-(methylsulfonyl)butanoate
To a solution of 7-(2-fluoro-4-(1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridin-4-yl)phenyl)hepta-4,6-diyn-1-ol hydrochloride (570 mg, 1 eq) in DMF (12 ml) was added with N,N-diisopropylethylamine (0.93 ml, 3 eq) and methyl 4-bromo-2-methyl-2-(methylsulfonyl)butanoate (Intermediate 1) (584 mg, 1.2 eq). The mixture was stirred for 12 hr at 60Â° C., cooled down to room temperature, and extracted with ethyl acetate and water. The organic layer was washed with brine, dried over anhydrous MgSO4 and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was purified with column chromatography to prepare the title compound (230 mg, 27%).
