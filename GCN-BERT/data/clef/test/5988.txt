Example 93: Synthesis of compound 11610, N-(3-chloro-4-fluorophenyl)-N-(4-(5-(difluoromethyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl)-2-fluorobenzyl)-2-(1,1-dioxidothiomorpholino)acetamide
2-((3-chloro-4-fluorophenyl)(4-(5-(difluoromethyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl)-2-fluorobenzyl)amino)-2-oxoethyl methanesulfonate (0.050 g, 0.098 mmol) synthesized in step 6 of Example 85, thiomorpholine 1,1-dioxide (0.020 g, 0.148 mmol) and N,N-diisopropylethylamine (0.034 mL, 0.197 mmol) were dissolved in acetonitrile (5 mL) at room temperature, and the solution was stirred at the same temperature for 18 hours. Water was added to the reaction mixture, followed by extraction with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed with saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution, dried with magnesium sulfate anhydrous, filtered, and then concentrated under reduced pressure. The concentrate was purified by column chromatography (SiO2, 12 g cartridge; methanol/dichloromethane = from 0% to 5%) and concentrated to give the title compound (0.030 g, 55.7%) as a white solid.
