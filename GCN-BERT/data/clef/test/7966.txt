FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention generally relates to peptides for stimulating subcutaneous adipogenesis. The invention also relates to pharmaceutical and cosmetic compositions containing such peptides, and to various methods of using such peptides and compositions to reduce scarring, improve the appearance of skin, improve tissue volume, smooth skin, recruit stem cells to formation of subcutaneous fat, reconstruct tissue, and reduce heel pain. BACKGROUND RHAMM is an hyaluronan (HA)-binding protein that is either poorly expressed or not expressed in most normal adult tissues but is highly expressed in aggressive human tumors (Adamia et al. (2005) Curr. Drug Targets Cardiovasc. Haematol. Disord., 5: 3-14; Tammi et al. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277: 4581-4584; Toole (2004) Nat. Rev. Cancer, 4: 528-539). RHAMM (gene name HMMR) is the Receptor for Hyaluronic Acid Mediated Motility, also known as CD168. RHAMM is a non-integral cell surface protein (CD168) and an intracellular hyaluronan binding protein. Analyses of animal models suggest roles for RHAMM in tumorigenesis and in other disease processes such as arthritis, consistent with its well-documented in vitro functions in cell migration and proliferation and apoptosis (Turley et al. (2002) J. Biol. Chem., 277: 4589-4592). Although cell migration and proliferation and apoptosis are essential functions for morphogenesis and tissue homeostasis, genetic deletion of RHAMM does not appear to affect embryogenesis or adult homeostasis (Tolg et al. (2003) Oncogene 22: 6873-6882). To date, a primary physiological function for RHAMM has remained elusive. RHAMM was originally isolated from subconfluent migrating fibroblasts in vitro (Turley (1982) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 108: 1016-1024) and subsequently cloned from mesenchymal cells (see, e.g., Hardwick et al. (1992) J. Cell Biol., 117: 1343-1350). Since antibodies prepared against a shed form of RHAMM blocked HA-stimulated-fibroblast motility, RHAMM was originally described as a cell surface protein that can transduce motogenic signaling pathways in culture (Turley et al. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277: 4589-4592). However, HA-bound RHAMM was later detected in intracellular compartments such as the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons, nucleus and cytoplasm (Adamia et al. (2005) Curr. Drug Targets Cardiovasc. Haematol. Disord., 5: 3-14). More recently, RHAMM has been shown to decorate centrosomes and mitotic spindles. RHAMM appears to be required for mitotic spindle formation in culture and acts on the BRCA1/BARD1 pathway to regulate mitotic spindle integrity (Joukov et al. (2006) Cancer Cell, 127: 539-52). Collectively, these results suggest that RHAMM may have both extracellular and intracellular functions, (Nickel (2005) Traffic 6: 607-614; Samuel et al. (1993) J. Cell Biol., 123: 749-758; Zhang et al. (1998) J. Biol. Chem., 273: 11342-11348) thus resembling a group of proteins including epimorphin/syntaxin-2, and autocrine motility factor/phosphoglucose isomerase that are also found at the cell surface where they transmit signals across the cell membrane even though, like RHAMM, they lack both Golgi-ER export peptides and membrane spanning sequences (Nickel (2005) Traffic 6: 607-614). Although the intracellular versus extracellular functions of RHAMM have not yet been clearly dissected, accumulating data suggest that both forms may contribute to mesenchymal phenotypes, at least during disease. For example, RHAMM expression in culture is increased in transformed fibroblasts by fibrogenic cytokines such as TGF-β (Samuel et al. (1993) J. Cell Biol., 123: 749-758). Cell surface RHAMM is required for activation through fibrogenic cytokines such as PDGF (Zhang et al. (1998) J. Biol. Chem., 273: 11342-11348). It has also been demonstrated that RHAMM expression is high in clinically aggressive mesenchymal tumors (fibromatoses or desmoid tumors) (see, e.g., Tolg et al. (2003) Oncogene 22: 6873-6882). In a mouse model susceptible to desmoid and upper intestinal tract tumors, genetic deletion of RHAMM strongly reduces desmoid initiation and invasion but not upper intestinal tract tumors. Fibroproliferative processes such as aggressive fibromatosis resemble proliferative/migratory stages of wound healing (Cheon et al. (2002) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 99: 6973-6978). Furthermore, the expression of RHAMM is modulated during wounding (Lovvorn et al. (1998) J. Pediatr. Surg., 33: 1062-1069; discussion 1069-1070). It has been found that factors that regulate fibroblast function play dual roles in wound repair and tumorigenesis (Bissell (2001) Exp. Mol. Med., 33: 179-190; Park et al. (2000) Mol. Med. Today, 6: 324-329) and mesenchymal stem cell trafficking/differentiation into wound sites has become a topic of study (see, e.g., Fu et al. (2006) Wound Repair Regen., 14: 325-35; Mansilla et al. (2006) Transplant Proc. 38: 967-969; Shumakov (2003) Bull. Exp. Biol. Med., 136: 192-195). Mesenchymal stem cells and resident fibroblasts in wounds have immune-modulatory functions that affect the timing and extent of fibrosis during wound repair (Domaszewska and Oszewski (2006) Ann. Transpint. 11: 45-52). Genetic loss of RHAMM or blocking RHAMM function using peptides mimicking its hyaluronan binding sequence or antibodies to this sequence have been shown to promote subcutaneous adipogenesis. One such peptide (STMMSRSHKTRSHHV (SEQ ID NO: 1), P-1 peptide, also referred to herein as peptide P15-1) isolated from a random page library has been shown to bind to hyaluronan, is adipogenic and resembles the hyaluronan binding region of RHAMM, a mesenchymal factor involved in wound repair. Another peptide, peptide B (KLKDENSQLKSEVSK (SEQ ID NO: 2)), which contains several key residues required for an interaction of RHAMM with HA, is strongly adipogenic. It was reported in PCT Publication No. WO 2008/140586 that RHAMM displays an effect in modulation of adipose tissue development. In particular, histology analysis of tissue sections through unwounded skin of RHAMM−/− mice showed that the subcutaneous layer of fat was two to three times thicker than in wild-type littermate skin and fibroblasts grown from RHAMM−/− wounds incorporated high levels of fat droplets and reduced smooth muscle actin. Furthermore, RHAMM−/− dermal fibroblasts converted to adipocytes when grown in adipogenic medium. In contrast fibroblasts grown from litter matched wild-type wounds did not exhibit fat droplets, and expressed abundant smooth muscle actin. RHAMM-rescued dermal fibroblasts do not undergo adipogenic conversion when grown in adipogenic medium. Conversely, image analysis of RHAMM−/− mice showed that they have significantly less visceral fat and a lower bone density than wild-type litter mates. These data were said to indicate that RHAMM has a differential effect on visceral vs. subcutaneous adipogenesis. It is also believed that RHAMM is selective in its regulation of subcutaneous vs. visceral fat, and that this regulation is associated with effects on bone marrow stem cells since bone density provides a measure of stem cell activity. This indicates that RHAMM affects subcutaneous fat deposition through its ability to regulate mesenchymal stem cell differentiation, a conclusion substantiated by the effect of RHAMM loss on another mesenchymal stem cell type, myofibroblasts. Furthermore, hyaluronan/RHAMM interactions play a role in this effect on mesenchymal differentiation since HA binding peptides also promote adipogenesis. In addition to these in vivo effects, RHAMM−/− dermal fibroblasts spontaneously develop into adipocytes when cultures become crowded while wild type dermal fibroblasts do not.

DEFINITIONS The term “peptide” as used herein refers to a polymer of amino acid residues typically ranging in length from about 5 to about 31 amino acids. The amino acid residues of the peptide can be “L-form” amino acid residues, “D” amino acid residues, or a combination thereof. L-, D-, or β-amino acid versions of the peptide sequence as well as retro, inverso, and retro-inverso isoforms are included. “β-peptides” are comprised of “β amino acids”, which have their amino group bonded to the β carbon rather than the a-carbon as in the 20 standard biological amino acids. The terms “standard” and “natural” as applied to peptides herein refer to peptides constructed only from the standard naturally-occurring amino acids: alanine (Ala, A), cysteine (Cys, C), aspartate (Asp, D), glutamate (Glu, E), phenylalanine (Phe, F), glycine (Gly, G), histidine (His, H), isoleucine (Ile, I), lysine (Lys, K), leucine (Leu, L), methionine (Met, M), asparagine (Asn, N), proline (Pro, P), glutamine (Gln, Q), arginine (Arg, R), serine (Ser, S), threonine (Thr, T), valine (Val, V), tryptophan (Trp, W), and tyrosine (Tyr, Y). A peptide of the invention “corresponds” to a natural peptide if it elicits a biological activity (e.g., adipogenic activity) related to the biological activity and/or specificity of the naturally occurring peptide. The elicited activity may be the same as, greater than or less than that of the natural peptide. The terms “non-standard,” and “non-natural,” and “analogue” as applied to peptides herein refer to peptides which contain one or more amino acids which are not standard amino acids and/or which are not naturally-occurring amino acids. A skilled artisan would be familiar such non-standard and non-naturally occurring amino acids and would be able to select suitable non-standard and non-naturally occurring amino acids for use in the peptides of the present invention. Amino acid analogues include amino acids that occur in nature but which are non-standard (e.g., norvaline, norleucine), as well as synthetic amino acids that do not occur in nature. For example, various amino acid analogues include, but are not limited to 2-aminoadipic acid, 3-aminoadipic acid, beta-alanine (beta-aminopropionic acid), 2-aminobutyric acid, 4-aminobutyric acid, piperidinic acid, 6-aminocaproic acid, 2-aminoheptanoic acid, 2-aminoisobutyric acid, 3-aminoisobutyric acid, 2-aminopimelic acid, 2,4 diaminobutyric acid, desmosine, 2,2′-diaminopimelic acid, 2,3-diaminopropionic acid, n-ethylglycine, n-ethylasparagine, hydroxylysine, allo-hydroxylysine, 3-hydroxyproline, 4-hydroxyproline, isodesmosine, allo-isoleucine, n-methylglycine, sarcosine, n-methylisoleucine, 6-n-methyllysine, n-methylvaline, norvaline, norleucine, ornithine, and the like. These modified amino acids are illustrative and not intended to be limiting. The term “conservative substitution” is used to refer to an amino acid substitution that does not substantially alter the activity (e.g., adipogenic activity and/or specificity) of the peptide. Conventional conservative amino acid substitutions involve substituting one amino acid for another amino acid with similar structure and chemical properties (e.g., charge or hydrophobicity). Such conventional substitutions include, but are not limited to, the following: 1) glycine (G)/alanine (A), 2) arginine (R)/lysine (K), 3) serine (S)/threonine (T)/tyrosine (Y), 4) leucine (L)/isoleucine (I)/valine (V), 5) aspartic acid (D)/glutamic acid (E), 6) glutamine (Q)/asparagine (N), and 7) phenylalanine (F)/tyrosine (Y)/tryptophan (W). Other functional conservative substitutions include, but are not limited to 8) glycine (G)/alanine (A)/proline (P), 9) tyrosine (Y)/histidine (H), 10) arginine (R)/lysine (K)/histidine (H), 11) serine (S)/threonine (T)/cysteine (C), 12) leucine (L)/isoleucine (I)/valine (V)/methionine (M), 13) alanine (A)/serine (S)/threonine (T)/methionine (M)/glycine (G), and 14) methionine (M)/lysine (K) (under hydrophobic conditions). Conservative substitutions also include “analog substitutions” where a standard amino acid is replaced by a non-standard (e.g., rare, synthetic, etc.) amino acid differing minimally from the standard amino acid. Such analog substitutions can be derived synthetically from the standard amino acids, are isomers, or are metabolite precursors. Examples of such “analog substitutions” include, but are not limited to, 1) Lys→ornithine (Orn), 2) Leu→Norleucine, 3) Lys→Lys[TFA], 4) Phe→phenylglycine, and 5) δ-amino butylglycine→ξ-amino hexylglycine, where [TFA] refers to trifluoroacetyl. Conservative substitutions also include a replacement of an amino acid with another amino acid having shared properties as shown in FIG. 1. Such substitutions include substitutions of one amino acid in one of the following groups with another amino acid in the same group: 1) aromatic amino acids: phenylalanine (F)/tyrosine (Y)/histidine (H)/tryptophan (W); 2) aliphatic amino acids: isoleucine (I)/valine (V)/leucine(L)/alanine (A)/glycine (G); 3) positively charged amino acids: histidine (H)/lysine (K)/arginine (R); 4) negatively charged amino acids: aspartate (D)/glutamate (E); and 5) tiny amino acids: cysteine (C)/alanine (A)/glycine (G)/serine (S). Conservative substitutions also include substitutions of amino acids having uncharged polar side chains, i.e., serine (S)/threonine (T)/asparagine (N)/glutamine (Q)/tyrosine (Y)/cysteine(S). Where amino acid sequences are disclosed herein, amino acid sequences comprising one or more of the above-identified conservative substitutions are also contemplated. The term percent “identity” refers to two or more sequences that have a specified percentage of amino acid residues that are the same, when compared and aligned for maximum correspondence, as measured using standard sequence comparison algorithms or by visual inspection. For sequence comparison, typically one sequence acts as a reference sequence, to which test sequences are compared. By a peptide having an amino acid sequence with at least, for example, 50% identity to a reference amino acid sequence, it is intended that up to 50% of the amino acid residues in the test sequence may be inserted, deleted, or substituted with another amino acid. These alterations of the test sequence may occur at the amino or carboxy terminal positions of the reference amino acid sequence or anywhere between those terminal positions, interspersed either individually among residues in the reference sequence or in one or more contiguous groups within the reference sequence. Sequence identity of a test sequence is determined over the full length of the reference peptide or over a specified portion of the reference peptide. For example, in considering the amino acid sequence TMMS (SEQ ID NO: 67) as the reference sequence of the full sequence STMMSR (SEQ ID NO: 51), some test sequences with amino acid substitutions (e.g., TMAQ (SEQ ID NO: 68), TRMW (SEQ ID NO: 69), TVLS (SEQ ID NO: 70), IGMS (SEQ ID NO: 71), and KMTS (SEQ ID NO: 72)) have 50% sequence identity with the reference sequence, as do some test sequences with amino acid deletions (e.g., MM, MS, TM, TS), and some test sequences with amino acid insertions (e.g., TMMAAAAS (SEQ ID NO: 73), TAAMMSAA(SEQ ID NO: 74), TMAAAMAS (SEQ ID NO: 75)). Some test sequences with insertions, deletions, and/or substitutions will also have 50% sequence identity with the reference sequence. For example, again considering the amino acid sequence TMMS (SEQ ID NO: 67) as the reference sequence, sequences such as TCS or AMS (having one deletion and one substitution as compared to the reference sequence), or TLLMMT (SEQ ID NO: 76) or AMLIMS (SEQ ID NO: 77) (having two insertions and one substitution as compared to the reference sequence), have 50% identity with the reference sequence, as can be seen from the following sequence alignments: TMMS T-CS TMMS -AMS T--MMS TLLMMT TM--MS AMLIMS By contrast, sequences such as TAAM (SEQ ID NO: 78) or FTMA (SEQ ID NO: 79) (having one substitution, one insertion, and one deletion as compared to the reference sequence), TCCRS (SEQ ID NO: 80) (having one insertion and two substitutions as compared to the reference sequence), or TLALM (SEQ ID NO: 81) (having two insertions, one substitution, and one deletion as compared to the reference sequence) have less than 50% sequence identity with the reference sequence TMMS (SEQ ID NO: 67), as can be seen in the following sequence alignments: TM-MS TAAM- (40% sequence identity) -TMMS FTMA- (40% sequence identity) TMM-S TCCRS (40% sequence identity) T-M-MS TLALM- (33% sequence identity) When using a sequence comparison algorithm, test and reference sequences are entered into a computer, subsequence coordinates are designated, if necessary, and sequence algorithm program parameters are designated. The sequence comparison algorithm then calculates the percent sequence identity for the test sequence(s) relative to the reference sequence, based on the designated program parameters. Optimal alignment of sequences for comparison can be conducted, for example, by the local homology algorithm of Smith & Waterman (1981) Adv. Appl. Math. 2: 482, by the homology alignment algorithm of Needleman & Wunsch (1970) J. Mol. Biol. 48: 443, by the search for similarity method of Pearson & Lipman (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA, 85: 2444, by computerized implementations of these algorithms (GAP, BESTFIT, FASTA, and TFASTA in the Wisconsin Genetics Software Package, Genetics Computer Group, 575 Science Dr., Madison, Wis.), or by visual inspection. One illustrative but non-limiting method for determining a global sequence alignment is through use of the FASTDB computer program based on the algorithm of Brutlag et al. (1990) Comp. App. Biosci. 6: 237-245. Use of such alignment algorithms is known to one of ordinary skill in the art. If the test sequence is shorter than the reference sequence due to N- or C-terminal deletions, not because of internal deletions, a manual correction is typically made to the results. This is because the FASTDB program does not account for N- and C-terminal truncations of the test sequence when calculating global percent identity. For test sequences truncated at the N- and C-termini, relative to the reference sequence, the percent identity is corrected by calculating the number of residues of the reference sequence that are N- and C-terminal of the test sequence, which are not matched/aligned with a corresponding test residue, as a percent of the total bases of the reference sequence. Whether a residue is matched/aligned is determined by results of the FASTDB sequence alignment. This percentage is then subtracted from the percent identity, calculated by the above FASTDB program using the specified parameters, to arrive at a final percent identity score. This final percent identity score is what is used for the purposes of the present invention. Only residues to the N- and C-termini of the test sequence, that are not matched/aligned with the reference sequence, are typically considered for the purposes of manually adjusting the percent identity score. That is, only reference residue positions outside the farthest N- and C-terminal residues of the test sequence. For example, a 3-amino acid residue test sequence is aligned with a 4-residue reference sequence to determine percent identity. The deletion occurs at the N-terminus of the test sequence and therefore, the FASTDB alignment does not show a matching/alignment of the first residue at the N-terminus. The unpaired residue represents 25% of the sequence (number of residues at the N and C-termini not matched/total number of residues in the reference sequence) so 25% is subtracted from the percent identity score calculated by the FASTDB program. If the remaining 3 residues were perfectly matched the final percent identity would be 75%. In another example, a 3 residue test sequence is compared with a 4 residue reference sequence. This time the deletions are internal deletions so there are no residues at the N- or C-termini of the test sequence which are not matched/aligned with the reference. In this case the percent identity calculated by FASTDB is not manually corrected. Once again, only residue positions outside the N- and C-terminal ends of the test sequence, as displayed in the FASTDB alignment, which are not matched/aligned with the reference sequence, are manually corrected for. No other manual corrections are typically made or necessary. The term “variant” refers to a peptide differing from a peptide of the invention, but retaining essential properties thereof (e.g., the ability to inhibit RHAMM activity and/or the ability to induce subcutaneous adipogenesis). Generally, variants are overall closely similar, and may be identical, in many regions, to a peptide sequence of the invention. Besides conservative amino acid substitution, a variant peptide can include (i) substitutions with one or more of non-conserved amino acid residues, where the substituted amino acid residues may or may not be a standard amino acid and may or may not be a naturally occurring amino acid, and/or (ii) conservative substitutions with one or more non-standard or non-naturally occurring amino acid residues, and/or (iii) fusion of the peptide with another compound, such as a compound to increase the stability and/or solubility of the peptide (for example, polyethylene glycol), and/or (iv) fusion of the peptide with additional amino acids, such as, for example, an IgG Fc fusion region peptide, or leader or secretory sequence, or a sequence facilitating purification. Methods of making such variant peptides are within the skill of one of ordinary skill in the art. For example, peptide variants containing amino acid substitutions of charged amino acids with other charged or neutral amino acids may produce peptides with improved characteristics, such as less aggregation. Aggregation of pharmaceutical formulations both reduces activity and increases clearance due to the aggregate's immunogenic activity (see, e.g., Pinckard et al. (1967) Clin. Exp. Immunol. 2: 331340; Robbins et al. (1987) Diabetes 36: 838-845; Cleland et al. (1993) Crit. Rev. Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems, 10: 307-377). The terms “subject,” “individual,” and “patient” may be used interchangeably and refer to a mammal, preferably a human or a non-human primate, but also domesticated mammals (e.g., canine or feline), laboratory mammals (e.g., mouse, rat, rabbit, hamster, guinea pig), and agricultural mammals (e.g., equine, bovine, porcine, ovine, capra, and the like). The subject can be a human (e.g., adult male, adult female, adolescent male, adolescent female, male child, female child) under the care of a physician, nurse practitioner, or other health worker in a hospital, as an outpatient, or in other clinical contexts. Alternatively, the subject may not be under the care or prescription of a physician, nurse practitioner, or other health worker.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION Peptides and mimetics are identified that promote subcutaneous adipogenesis without inducing undesired visceral adipogenesis. These peptides are useful in a variety of cosmetic and therapeutic applications. Without being bound to a particular theory, it is believed that the peptides described herein achieve the adipogenic activity by inhibiting (fully or partially) RHAMM binding to hyaluronan and/or RHAMM biological activity (e.g., binding to CD44). The peptides of the invention are short in length having only about 5 to 31 amino acids. The peptides preferably have a length of 5 to 14 amino acids, and even more preferably have a length of 6 to 8 amino acids. The peptides are thus preferably shorter than other peptides known in the art to have adipogenic activity, such as the P-1 Peptide (peptide P15-1; SEQ ID NO: 1). The “short” peptides offer certain advantages such as reduced cost of production, reduced immunogenicity, increased activity, and increased penetration into skin when applied topically. Peptide P15-1 (SEQ ID NO: 1) was isolated by screening a random phage library for peptides having the ability to bind to hyaluronan (HA). Alignments were performed to assess the similarity of the P15-1 (SEQ ID NO: 1) peptide to peptide B (SEQ ID NO: 2), a peptide derived from the HA-binding region of RHAMM. Since these peptides bind to hyaluronan and resemble a RHAMM sequence and have been shown to be adipogenic, it was possible to identify conserved motifs that are believed to be responsible for the adipogenic properties of the peptides. It is also believed that the use of RHAMM-inhibiting peptides described herein provides signals that force differentiation into adipocytes. In addition, RHAMM−/− dermal fibroblasts express very low levels of smooth muscle actin indicating that RHAMM also regulates development of this mesenchymal stem cell lineage. With respect to mesenchymal and other skin stem cells, a unique advantage of using the RHAMM-inhibiting peptides described herein for increasing subcutaneous fat is that its effects are selective. Thus, visceral fat, whose increased accumulation on body organs is associated with disease is decreased while subcutaneous fat is increased. This is an unusual effect and differentiates RHAMM's effects from other adipocyte promoting factors such as leptin that affect accumulation of both types of adipocytes. Accordingly, it is believed the peptides described herein will not increase visceral fat. Another property of RHAMM is related to its very restricted expression in the adult human tissues. RHAMM is poorly expressed or not expressed physiologically but is increased following tissue injury or transformation to the neoplastic state. Therefore, the RHAMM-inhibitory peptides described herein should have low toxicity. In fact, it is believed that blocking RHAMM function can be beneficial to those with a tumor load or with inflammation-based diseases such as arthritis since RHAMM has pro-oncogenic, pro-inflammatory functions.

The same type of modification may be present in the same or varying degrees at several sites in a peptide. Also, a peptide may contain many types of modifications. Peptides may be branched, for example, as a result of ubiquitination, and they may be cyclic, with or without branching.

Such variants include deletions, insertions, inversions, repeats, and substitutions (e.g., conservative substitutions) selected according to general rules well known in the art so as have little effect on activity. Peptoids are also contemplated wherein the peptoid has an essentially corresponding monomer sequence, where a natural amino acid is replaced by an N-substituted glycine derivative, if the N-substituted glycine derivative resembles the original amino acid in hydrophilicity, hydrophobicity, polarity, etc. The following are illustrative, but non-limiting N-substituted glycine replacements: N-(1-methylprop-1-yl)glycine→isoleucine (I), N-(prop-2-yl)glycine→valine (V), N-benzylglycine→phenylalanine (F), N-(2-hydroxyethyl)glycine→serine (S), and the like. In certain aspects of the invention, substitutions need not be “exact”. Thus for example, in certain aspects of the invention, N-(2-hydroxyethyl)glycine may substitute for S, T, C, and/or M; N-(2-methylprop-1-yl)glycine may substitute for V, L, and/or I; N-(2-hydroxyethyl)glycine can be used to substitute for T or S. In general, one may use an N-hydroxyalkyl-substituted glycine to substitute for any polar amino acid, an N-benzyl- or N-aralkyl-substituted glycine to replace any aromatic amino acid, an N-alkyl-substituted glycine such as N-butylglycine to replace any nonpolar amino acid (e.g., L, V, I, etc.), and an N-(aminoalkyl)glycine to replace any basic polar amino acid (e.g., L and R). Functionalization and Protecting Groups. While the various peptides described herein are shown without protecting groups, they can bear one or more protecting groups. The protecting groups can be coupled to the C- and/or N-terminus of the peptide and/or to one or more internal residues of the peptide. Thus, for example, any of the peptides described herein can bear, e.g., an acyl group protecting the amino terminus and/or an amide group protecting the carboxyl terminus. These blocking groups enhance the helix-forming tendencies of the peptides. Without being bound by a particular theory, it is believed that blockage, particularly of the amino and/or carboxyl termini of the peptide can improve ex vivo and/or in vivo peptide stability and/or can improve skin penetration when administered topically. Suitable protecting groups include, but are not limited to, acetyl, amide, and alkyl groups with acetyl and alkyl groups being particularly preferred for N-terminal protection and amide groups being preferred for carboxyl terminal protection. Alkyl protecting groups include, but are not limited to, alkyl chains as in fatty acids such as propionyl, formyl, and others. For example, the alkyl can be 3- to 20-carbon alkyl. Carboxyl protecting groups include amides, esters, and ether-forming protecting groups. Such blocking groups include alkyl groups of various lengths, e.g., groups having the formula: CH3—(CH2)n—CO— where n ranges from about 1 to about 20, preferably from about 1 to about 16 or 18, more preferably from about 3 to about 13, and most preferably from about 3 to about 10. Other suitable protecting groups include, but are not limited to, fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (FMOC), t-butoxycarbonyl (t-BOC), 9-fluoreneacetyl, 1-fluorenecarboxylic, 9-florenecarboxylic, 9-fluorenone-1-carboxylic, benzyloxycarbonyl, xanthyl (Xan), trityl (Trt), 4-methyltrityl (Mtt), 4-methoxytrityl (Mmt), 4-methoxy-2,3,6-trimethyl-benzenesulphonyl (Mtr), mesitylene-2-sulphonyl (Mts), 4,4-dimethoxybenzhydryl (Mbh), tosyl (Tos), 2,2,5,7,8-pentamethyl chroman-6-sulphonyl (Pmc), 4-methylbenzyl (MeBz1), 4-methoxybenzyl (MeOBzl), benzyloxy (BzlO), benzyl (Bzl), benzoyl (Bz), 3-nitro-2-pyridinesulphenyl (Npys), 1-(4,4-dimentyl-2,6-diaxocyclohexylidene)ethyl (Dde), 2,6-dichlorobenzyl (2,6-DiCl—Bzl), 2-chlorobenzyloxycarbonyl (2-Cl—Z), 2-bromobenzyloxycarbonyl (2-Br—Z), benzyloxymethyl (Bom), cyclohexyloxy (cHxO), t-butoxymethyl (Bum), t-butoxy (tBuO), t-Butyl (tBu), acetyl (Ac), and trifluoroacetyl (TFA). Protecting/blocking groups are well known to those of skill as are methods of coupling such groups to the appropriate residue of the peptide (see, e.g., Greene et al., (1991) Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 2nd ed., John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Somerset, N.J.). For example, acetylation can be accomplished during synthesis when the peptide is on the resin using acetic anhydride. Amide protection can be achieved by the selection of a proper resin for the synthesis. During the synthesis of the peptide, rink amide resin can used. After the completion of the synthesis, the semipermanent protecting groups on acidic bifunctional amino acids such as Asp and Glu, the basic amino acid Lys, and the hydroxyl of Tyr are all simultaneously removed. The peptides released from such a resin using acidic treatment have the N-terminus protected with acetyl and the carboxy-terminus protected with NH2 with the simultaneous removal of all of the other protecting groups. The peptides may comprise one or more D-amino acids (dextro rather than levo). Every other, or even every amino acid (e.g., every enantiomeric amino acid) of the peptide can be a D-amino acid. For example, at least 50%, at least 80%, at least 90% or even all of the enantiomeric amino acids can be D-amino acids. The peptides can also be functionalized with a polymer (e.g., polyethylene glycol and/or a cellulose or modified cellulose) to increase bioavailability. Peptide Mimetics. Peptide analogs are commonly used in the pharmaceutical industry as non-peptide drugs with properties analogous to those of the template peptide. These types of non-peptide compounds are termed “peptide mimetics” or “peptidomimetics” (Fauchere (1986) Adv. Drug Res. 15: 29; Veber and Freidinger (1985) TINS p. 392; and Evans et al. (1987) J. Med. Chem. 30: 1229) and are usually developed with the aid of computerized molecular modeling. Peptide mimetics that are structurally similar to peptides of the invention may be used to produce an equivalent therapeutic or prophylactic effect. Peptidomimetics are structurally similar to a peptide (e.g., KSEVSK (SEQ ID NO: 3)), but have one or more peptide linkages optionally replaced by a linkage such as —CH2NH—, —CH2S—, —CH2—CH2—, —CH═CH— (cis and trans), —COCH2—, —CH(OH)CH2—, or —CH2SO— by methods known in the art and further described in the following references: Spatola (1983) p. 267 in Chemistry and Biochemistry of Amino Acids, Peptides, and Proteins, B. Weinstein, eds., Marcel Dekker, New York; Spatola (1983) Vega Data 1(3) Peptide Backbone Modifications. (general review); Morley (1980) Trends Pharm Sci pp. 463-468 (general review); Hudson et al.

(1983) Tetrahedron Lett 24:4401-4404 (—C(OH)CH2—); and Hruby (1982) Life Sci., 31:189-199 (—CH2—S—)). A particularly useful non-peptide linkage is —CH2NH—. Such peptide mimetics may have significant advantages over peptides, such as more economical production, greater chemical stability, enhanced pharmacological properties (half-life, absorption, potency, efficacy, etc.), and/or reduced antigenicity. Circular permutations of the peptides described herein or constrained peptides (including cyclized peptides) comprising the motifs described herein or a substantially identical motif can be generated by methods known in the art (Rizo and Gierasch (1992) Ann. Rev. Biochem. 61: 387), for example, by adding internal cysteine residues capable of forming intramolecular disulfide bridges which cyclize the peptide. Peptide Preparation. In various aspects of the invention, the peptides described herein can be chemically synthesized using standard chemical peptide synthesis techniques or, particularly where the peptide does not comprise D-amino acid residues, the peptide can be recombinantly expressed. Where polypeptides containing one or more D-amino acids are to be recombinantly expressed, a host organism (e.g. bacteria, plant, fungal cells, etc.) can be cultured in an environment where one or more of the amino acids is provided to the organism exclusively in a D-form. Recombinantly expressed peptides in such a system then incorporate those D-amino acids. Also, D-amino acids can be incorporated in recombinantly expressed peptides using modified amino acyl-tRNA synthetases that recognize D-amino acids. The peptides (containing D- and/or L-amino acids) can be chemically synthesized by any of a number of fluid or solid phase peptide synthesis techniques known to those of skill in the art. Solid phase synthesis in which the C-terminal amino acid of the sequence is attached to an insoluble support followed by sequential addition of the remaining amino acids in the sequence is a preferred method for the chemical synthesis of the polypeptides of the invention. Techniques for solid phase synthesis are well known to those of skill in the art and are described, for example, by Barany and Merrifield (1963) Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis; pp. 3-284 in The Peptides: Analysis, Synthesis, Biology. Vol. 2: Special Methods in Peptide Synthesis, Part A.; Merrifield et al. (1963) J. Am. Chem. Soc., 85: 2149-2156, and Stewart et al. (1984) Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis, 2nd ed. Pierce Chem. Co., Rockford, Ill. The peptides can be synthesized by the solid phase peptide synthesis procedure using a benzhydrylamine resin (Beckman Bioproducts, 0.59 mmol of NH2/g of resin) as the solid support. The carboxy terminal amino acid (e.g., t-butylcarbonyl-Phe) is attached to the solid support through a 4-(oxymethyl)phenacetyl group. This is a more stable linkage than the conventional benzyl ester linkage, yet the finished peptide can still be cleaved by hydrogenation. Transfer hydrogenation using formic acid as the hydrogen donor can be used for this purpose. It is noted that in the chemical synthesis of peptides, particularly peptides comprising D-amino acids, the synthesis usually produces a number of truncated peptides in addition to the desired full-length product. Thus, the peptides are typically purified using, e.g., HPLC. D-amino acids, beta amino acids, non-natural amino acids, non-standard amino acids, and the like can be incorporated at one or more positions in the peptide simply by using the appropriately derivatized amino acid residue in the chemical synthesis. Modified residues for solid phase peptide synthesis are commercially available from a number of suppliers (see, e.g., Advanced Chem Tech, Louisville; Nova Biochem, San Diego; Sigma, St Louis; Bachem California Inc., Torrance, etc.). The D-form and/or otherwise modified amino acids can be completely omitted or incorporated at any position in the peptide as desired. When the peptides are synthesized using recombinant expression systems, a DNA sequence that encodes the desired peptide is typically created, and placed in an expression cassette under the control of a promoter to express the peptide in a host cell. The expressed peptide is isolated and, if required, renatured. DNA encoding a peptide of the invention can be prepared by any suitable method, including, for example, cloning and restriction of appropriate sequences or direct chemical synthesis. This nucleic acid can be easily ligated into an appropriate vector containing appropriate expression control sequences (e.g. promoter, enhancer, etc.), and, optionally, containing one or more selectable markers (e.g. antibiotic resistance genes). A nucleic acid sequence encoding a peptide described herein can be expressed in a variety of host cells, including, but not limited to, E. coli, other bacterial hosts, yeast, fungus, and various higher eukaryotic cells such as insect cells (e.g. SF3), the COS, CHO and HeLa cells lines and myeloma cell lines. The recombinant protein gene will typically be operably linked to appropriate expression control sequences for each host. For E. coli this can include a promoter such as the T7, trp, or lambda promoters, a ribosome binding site and preferably a transcription termination signal. For eukaryotic cells, illustrative control sequences can include a promoter and often an enhancer (e.g., an enhancer derived from immunoglobulin genes, SV40, cytomegalovirus, etc.), and a polyadenylation sequence, and may include splice donor and acceptor sequences. The plasmids can be transferred into the chosen host cell by well-known methods such as calcium chloride transformation for E. coli and calcium phosphate treatment or electroporation for mammalian cells. Cells transformed by the plasmids can be selected by resistance to antibiotics conferred by genes contained on the plasmids, such as the amp, gpt, neo and hyg genes. Once expressed, the recombinant peptides can be purified according to standard procedures of the art, including, but not limited to, ammonium sulfate precipitation, affinity columns, column chromatography, and gel electrophoresis (see, generally, R. Scopes, (1982) Protein Purification, Springer-Verlag, N.Y.; Deutscher (1990) Methods in Enzymology Vol. 182: Guide to Protein Purification., Academic Press, Inc. N.Y.). Substantially pure compositions of at least about 90 to 95% homogeneity are preferred, and 98 to 99% or more homogeneity are most preferred. One of skill in the art would recognize that after chemical synthesis, biological expression, or purification, the peptide may possess a conformation substantially different than desired native conformation. In this case, it may be necessary to denature and reduce the peptide and then to cause the molecule to re-fold into the preferred conformation. Methods of reducing and denaturing proteins and inducing re-folding are well known to those of skill in the art (see, e.g., Debinski et al. (1993) J. Biol. Chem., 268: 14065-14070; Kreitman and Pastan (1993) Bioconjug. Chem., 4: 581-585; and Buchner, et al., (1992) Anal. Biochem., 205: 263-270). Debinski et al., for example, describes the denaturation and reduction of inclusion body proteins in guanidine-DTE. The protein is then refolded in a redox buffer containing oxidized glutathione and L-arginine. One of skill would recognize that modifications can be made to the peptides of the invention without diminishing their biological activity. Some modifications may be made to facilitate the cloning, expression, or incorporation of the targeting molecule into a fusion protein. Such modifications are well known to those of skill in the art and include, for example, a methionine added at the amino terminus to provide an initiation site, or additional amino acids (e.g., poly His) placed on either terminus to create conveniently located restriction sites or termination codons or purification sequences. Pharmaceutical and Cosmetic Formulations Pharmaceutical and cosmetic compositions comprising any one or more of the peptides described herein and a pharmaceutically or cosmetically acceptable carrier are also provided. For example, the pharmaceutical or cosmetic composition can comprise any one or more, any two or more, any three or more, any four or more, or any five or more, of the peptides described herein. The peptides described herein are administered to a subject (e.g., a mammal) in need thereof, e.g., to induce or potentiate subcutaneous adipocyte recruitment or formation (e.g., to induce subcutaneous adipogenesis). These peptides can be administered in the “native” form or, if desired, in the form of salts, esters, amides, prodrugs, derivatives, and the like, provided the salt, ester, amide, prodrug or derivative is suitable pharmacologically, i.e., effective in the present method(s). Salts, esters, amides, prodrugs and other derivatives of the peptides can be prepared using standard procedures known to those skilled in the art of synthetic organic chemistry and described, for example, by March (1992) Advanced Organic Chemistry; Reactions, Mechanisms and Structure, 4th Ed. N.Y. Wiley-Interscience. Methods of formulating such derivatives are known to those of skill in the art. For example, the disulfide salts of a number of delivery agents are described in PCT Publication WO 2000/059863. Similarly, acid salts of therapeutic peptides, peptoids, or other mimetics, and can be prepared from the free base using conventional methodology that typically involves reaction with a suitable acid. Generally, the base form of the peptide is dissolved in a polar organic solvent such as methanol or ethanol and the acid is added thereto. The resulting salt either precipitates or can be brought out of solution by addition of a less polar solvent. Suitable acids for preparing acid addition salts include, but are not limited to, both organic acids, e.g., acetic acid, propionic acid, glycolic acid, pyruvic acid, oxalic acid, malic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, benzoic acid, cinnamic acid, mandelic acid, methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, or salicylic acid, as well as inorganic acids, e.g., hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, or phosphoric acid. An acid addition salt can be reconverted to the free base by treatment with a suitable base. Certain particularly preferred acid addition salts of the peptides described herein include halide salts, such as may be prepared using hydrochloric or hydrobromic acids. Conversely, preparation of basic salts of the peptides s described herein are prepared in a similar manner using a pharmaceutically acceptable base such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, ammonium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, or trimethylamine. Basic salts include alkali metal salts, e.g., the sodium salt, and copper salts. For the preparation of salt forms of a peptide, the pKa of the counterion is preferably at least about 2 pH lower than the pKa of the agent. Similarly, for the preparation of salt forms of acidic agent, the pKa of the counterion is preferably at least about 2 pH greater than the pKa of the agent. This permits the counterion to bring the solution's pH to a level lower than the pHmax to reach the salt plateau, at which the solubility of salt prevails over the solubility of free acid or base. The generalized rule of difference in pKa units of the ionizable group in the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) and in the acid or base is meant to make the proton transfer energetically favorable. When the pKa of the API and counterion are not significantly different, a solid complex may form but may rapidly disproportionate (i.e., break down into the individual entities of peptide and counterion) in an aqueous environment. Typically, the counterion is a pharmaceutically acceptable counterion. Suitable anionic salt forms include, but are not limited to, acetate, benzoate, benzylate, bitartrate, bromide, carbonate, chloride, citrate, edetate, edisylate, estolate, fumarate, gluceptate, gluconate, hydrobromide, hydrochloride, iodide, lactate, lactobionate, malate, maleate, mandelate, mesylate, methyl bromide, methyl sulfate, mucate, napsylate, nitrate, pamoate (embonate), phosphate and diphosphate, salicylate and disalicylate, stearate, succinate, sulfate, tartrate, tosylate, triethiodide, valerate, and the like, while suitable cationic salt forms include, but are not limited to aluminum, benzathine, calcium, ethylene diamine, lysine, magnesium, meglumine, potassium, procaine, sodium, tromethamine, zinc, and the like. Preparation of peptide esters typically involves functionalization of hydroxyl and/or carboxyl groups that are present within the molecular structure of the peptide. For example, the esters are typically acyl-substituted derivatives of free alcohol groups, i.e., moieties that are derived from carboxylic acids of the formula RCOOH where R is alkyl, and preferably is lower alkyl. Esters can be reconverted to the free acids, if desired, by using conventional hydrogenolysis or hydrolysis procedures. Amides of the peptides can also be prepared using techniques known to those skilled in the art. For example, amides can be prepared from esters, using suitable amine reactants, or they can be prepared from an anhydride or an acid chloride by reaction with ammonia or a lower alkyl amine. The peptides can be formulated for subcutaneous, parenteral, topical, oral, nasal (or otherwise inhaled), rectal, or local administration, such as by aerosol or transdermally. The compositions can be administered in a variety of unit dosage forms depending upon the method of administration. Suitable unit dosage forms, include, but are not limited to powders, tablets, pills, capsules, lozenges, suppositories, patches, nasal sprays, injectables, implantable sustained-release formulations, lipid complexes, etc. The peptides described herein can also be combined with a pharmaceutically or cosmetically acceptable carrier to form a pharmacological or cosmetic composition. Cosmetic compositions can additionally include a filler (e.g., a hyaluronic filler such as JUVÉDERM® XC, BELOTERO BALANCE, EMERVEL®, RESTYLANE, RADIESSE, a polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) microspheres and collagen filler such as ARTEFILL®, Calcium Hydroxylapatite (CaHA) microspheres such as RADIESSE®, and the like). The composition is preferably for topical, subcutaneous, or transdermal administration. The composition can be a composition for injection. The composition can further comprise collagen (e.g., a bovine, porcine, or human collagen). The collagen can be a synthetic collagen. The composition can further comprise an anesthetic (e.g., lidocaine). The composition can be a skin cream (e.g., a face cream). Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include those approved by a regulatory agency of the Federal or a state government or listed in the U.S. Pharmacopeia or other generally recognized pharmacopeia for use in or on animals, and more particularly humans. A “carrier” refers to, for example, a diluent, adjuvant, excipient, auxiliary agent or vehicle with which one or more of the peptides described herein is administered. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers can contain one or more physiologically acceptable compounds that act, for example, to stabilize the composition or to increase or decrease the absorption of the peptide. Physiologically acceptable compounds can include, for example, carbohydrates, such as glucose, sucrose, or dextrans, antioxidants, such as ascorbic acid or glutathione, chelating agents, low molecular weight proteins, protection and uptake enhancers such as lipids, compounds that reduce the clearance or hydrolysis of the peptides, or other excipients, stabilizers and/or buffers. Other physiologically acceptable compounds, particularly of use in the preparation of tablets, capsules, gel caps, and the like include, but are not limited to binders, diluent/fillers, disentegrants, lubricants, and suspending agents. To manufacture an oral dosage form (e.g., a tablet), an excipient (e.g., lactose, sucrose, starch, mannitol, etc.), an optional disintegrator (e.g. calcium carbonate, carboxymethylcellulose calcium, sodium starch glycollate, crospovidone etc.), a binder (e.g. alpha-starch, gum arabic, microcrystalline cellulose, carboxymethylcellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, hydroxypropylcellulose, cyclodextrin, etc.), and an optional lubricant (e.g., talc, magnesium stearate, polyethylene glycol 6000, etc.), for instance, are added to the peptide and the resulting composition is compressed. Where necessary, the compressed product is coated using known methods for masking taste or for enteric dissolution or sustained release. Suitable coating materials include, but are not limited to ethyl-cellulose, hydroxymethylcellulose, polyoxyethylene glycol, cellulose acetate phthalate, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose phthalate, and EUDRAGIT (Rohm & Haas, Germany; methacrylic-acrylic copolymer). Other physiologically acceptable compounds that can be formulated with the peptides include wetting agents, emulsifying agents, dispersing agents or preservatives that are particularly useful for preventing the growth or action of microorganisms. Various preservatives are well known and include, for example, phenol and ascorbic acid. One skilled in the art would appreciate that the choice of pharmaceutically acceptable carrier depends, for example, on the route of administration of the peptide and on the particular physio-chemical characteristics of the peptide. Preferably, the excipients are sterile and generally free of contaminants. These compositions can be sterilized by conventional, well-known sterilization techniques. For various oral dosage form excipients, such as tablets and capsules, sterility is not required; the USP/NF standard is usually sufficient. Nanoemulsion Formulations. The peptides described herein can be formulated in a nanoemulsion. Nanoemulsions include, but are not limited to, oil-in-water (O/W) nanoemulsions, and water-in-oil (W/O) nanoemulsions. Nanoemulsions can be defined as emulsions with mean droplet diameters ranging from about 20 to about 1000 nm. Usually, the average droplet size is between about 20 nm or 50 nm and about 500 nm. The terms sub-micron emulsion (SME) and mini-emulsion are used as synonyms. Illustrative oil-in-water (O/W) nanoemulsions include, but are not limited to: (1) surfactant micelles, which are micelles composed of small molecules, surfactants or detergents (e.g., SDS/PBS/2-propanol) which are suitable for predominantly hydrophobic peptides; (2) polymer micelles, which are micelles composed of polymer, copolymer, or block copolymer surfactants (e.g., Pluronic L64/PBS/2-propanol) which are suitable for predominantly hydrophobic peptides; (3) blended micelles, which are micelles in which there is more than one surfactant component or in which one of the liquid phases (generally an alcohol (e.g., ethanol) or fatty acid compound) participates in the formation of the micelle (e.g., octanoic acid/PBS/EtOH) which are suitable for predominantly hydrophobic peptides; (4) integral peptide micelles, which are blended micelles in which the peptide serves as an auxiliary surfactant, forming an integral part of the micelle (e.g., amphipathic peptide/PBS/mineral oil) which are suitable for amphipathic peptides; and (5) pickering (solid phase) emulsions, which are emulsions in which the peptides are associated with the exterior of a solid nanoparticle (e.g., polystyrene nanoparticles/PBS/no oil phase) which are suitable for amphipathic peptides. Illustrative water-in-oil (W/O) nanoemulsions include, but are not limited to: (1) surfactant micelles, which are micelles composed of small molecules surfactants or detergents (e.g., dioctyl sulfosuccinate/PBS/2-propanol, isopropylmyristate/PBS/2-propanol, etc.) which are suitable for predominantly hydrophilic peptides; (2) polymer micelles, which are micelles composed of polymer, copolymer, or block copolymer surfactants (e.g., PLURONIC® L121/PBS/2-propanol), which are suitable for predominantly hydrophilic peptides; (3) blended micelles, which are micelles in which there is more than one surfactant component or in which one of the liquid phases (generally an alcohol (e.g., ethanol) or fatty acid compound) participates in the formation of the micelle (e.g., capric/caprylic diglyceride/PBS/EtOH) which are suitable for predominantly hydrophilic peptides; (4) integral peptide micelles, which are blended micelles in which the peptide serves as an auxiliary surfactant, forming an integral part of the micelle (e.g., amphipathic peptide/PBS/polypropylene glycol) which are suitable for amphipathic peptides; and (5) pickering (solid phase) emulsions, which are emulsions in which the peptides are associated with the exterior of a solid nanoparticle (e.g., chitosan nanoparticles/no aqueous phase/mineral oil) which are suitable for amphipathic peptides. As indicated above, the nanoemulsions can comprise one or more surfactants or detergents. For example, the surfactant can be a non-anionic detergent (e.g., a polysorbate surfactant or a polyoxyethylene ether). Surfactants that find use in the present invention include, but are not limited to, surfactants such as the TWEEN®, TRITON®, and TYLOXAPOL® families of compounds. Preferably, the surfactant is a polysorbate surfactant (e.g., TWEEN 20®, TWEEN 40®, TWEEN 60®, and TWEEN 80®), a phenoxypolyethoxyethanol (e.g., TRITON® X-100, X-301, X-165, X-102, and X-200, and TYLOXAPOL®), or sodium dodecyl sulfate. The nanoemulsion can further comprise an emulsifying agent to aid in the formation of the emulsion. Emulsifying agents include compounds that aggregate at the oil/water interface to form a kind of continuous membrane that prevents direct contact between two adjacent droplets. Some oil-in-water emulsion compositions can readily be diluted with water to a desired concentration without impairing their anti-pathogenic properties. In addition to discrete oil droplets dispersed in an aqueous phase, oil-in-water emulsions can also contain other lipid structures, such as small lipid vesicles (e.g., lipid spheres that often consist of several substantially concentric lipid bilayers separated from each other by layers of aqueous phase), micelles (e.g., amphiphilic molecules in small clusters of 50-200 molecules arranged so that the polar head groups face outward toward the aqueous phase and the apolar tails are sequestered inward away from the aqueous phase), or lamellar phases (lipid dispersions in which each particle consists of parallel amphiphilic bilayers separated by thin films of water). These lipid structures are formed as a result of hydrophobic forces that drive apolar residues (e.g., long hydrocarbon chains) away from water. The lipid preparations can generally be described as surfactant lipid preparations (SLPs). SLPs are minimally toxic to mucous membranes and are believed to be metabolized within the small intestine (see e.g., Hamouda et al., (1998) J. Infect. Disease 180: 1939). The emulsion can comprise a discontinuous oil phase distributed in an aqueous phase, a first component comprising an alcohol (e.g., ethanol) and/or glycerol, and a second component comprising a surfactant or a halogen-containing compound. The aqueous phase can comprise any type of aqueous phase including, but not limited to, water (e.g., deionized water, distilled water, water-for-injection, tap water) and solutions (e.g., phosphate buffered saline solution, or other buffer systems). The oil phase can comprise any type of oil including, but not limited to, plant oils (e.g., soybean oil, avocado oil, flaxseed oil, coconut oil, cottonseed oil, squalene oil, olive oil, canola oil, corn oil, rapeseed oil, safflower oil, and sunflower oil), animal oils (e.g., fish oil), flavor oil, water insoluble vitamins, or mineral oil. Generally, the oil phase comprises about 30 to about 90 volume % of the oil-in-water emulsion (i.e., constitutes 30-90% of the total volume of the final emulsion), more preferably from about 50 to about 80 volume % of the emulsion. The emulsion can also include a halogen-containing compound such as a chloride salt (e.g., NaCl, KCl, etc.), a cetylpyridinium halide, a cetyltrimethylammonium halide, a cetyldimethylethylammonium halide, a cetyldimethylbenzylammonium halide, a cetyltributylphosphonium halide, a dodecyltrimethylammonium halide, a tetradecyltrimethylammonium halide, cetylpyridinium chloride, cetyltrimethylammonium chloride, cetylbenzyldimethylammonium chloride, cetylpyridinium bromide, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, cetyldimethylethylammonium bromide, cetyltributylphosphonium bromide, dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide, or tetradecyltrimethylammonium bromide.

Nanoemulsion formulations and methods of making such are well known to those of skill in the art and described for example in U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,476,393, 7,468,402, 7,314,624, 6,998,426, 6,902,737, 6,689,371, 6,541,018, 6,464,990, 6,461,625, 6,419,946, 6,413,527, 6,375,960, 6,335,022, 6,274,150, 6,120,778, 6,039,936, 5,925,341, 5,753,241, 5,698,219, an d5,152,923 and in Fanun et al. (2009) Microemulsions: Properties and Applications (Surfactant Science), CRC Press, Boca Raton Fl. Cosmetic Formulations. One or more of the peptides described herein can be incorporated into formulations for cosmetic use. Such cosmetic formulations can be for topical application and can be formulated as skin creams (e.g., face creams) or body lotions, wrinkle-removing creams, or incorporated into cosmetics, sunscreens, or moisturizers. The peptides can be incorporated into formulations that optionally further include fillers, moisturizers, vitamins (e.g., vitamin E), and/or colorants/tints. Suitable injectable cosmetic formulations include, but are not limited to, formulations incorporating one or more of the peptides in combination with one or more filler materials. Illustrative materials usable as injectable cosmetic wrinkle fillers include, but are not limited to, temporary (absorbable) fillers such as collagen (e.g., synthetic collagen, bovine collagen, porcine collagen, human collagen, etc.), hyaluronic acid gel, calcium hydroxylapatite (typically implanted in the form of a gel), or poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA). The peptides can also be incorporated into injectable cosmetic formulations containing permanent (non-absorbable) fillers. Illustrative “permanent” fillers include, but are not limited to, polymethylmethacrylate beads (PMMA microspheres). The peptides described herein can be incorporated into or administered in conjunction with commercial dermal fillers (e.g., RADIESSE® volumizing filler (about 30% by volume calcium hydroxylapatite (CaHA) microspheres (diameter of 25 μm to 45 μm) suspended in a sodium carboxymethylcellulose gel carrier)), JUVEDERM® injectable gel (a crosslinked hyaluronic acid produced by Streptococcus equi bacteria, formulated to a concentration of 24 mg/mL, optionally with 0.3% w/w lidocaine, in a physiologic buffer), RESTYLANE® dermal filler (a gel of 20 mg/mL hyaluronic acid generated by Streptococcus species of bacteria, chemically crosslinked with BDDE, and suspended in phosphate buffered saline), SCULPTRA® Aesthetic injectable implant (suspension containing microparticles of poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA), carboxymethylcellulose, non-pyrogenic mannitol and sterile water for injection). Such injectable formulations can additionally include an anesthetic (e.g., lidocaine or an analog thereof). The injectable formulations are substantially sterile or sterile and/or meet regulatory agency guidelines for subcutaneous injectable fillers Dose/Administration The peptides described herein can be administered to a subject using any route known in the art, including e.g., by injection (e.g., intravenous, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous, intramuscular, or intradermal), inhalation, transdermal application, rectal administration, vaginal administration, or oral administration. Preferred routes of administration include subcutaneous, transdermal, or topical application. An effective amount of the peptides can be administered via local (i.e., non-systemic) administration, such as by peripheral administration which includes, but is not limited to, peripheral intramuscular, intraglandular, and subcutaneous administration. Administration of the peptides can be in any convenient manner, e.g., by injection, intravenous and arterial stents (including eluting stents), catheter, oral administration, inhalation, transdermal application, rectal administration, and the like The peptides can be formulated with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, e.g., as described above, prior to administration. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers are determined in part by the particular composition being administered, as well as by the particular method used to administer the composition. Accordingly, there are a wide variety of suitable formulations for the peptides described herein (see, e.g., Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 17th ed., 1989). The dose administered to a subject, in the context of the methods described herein should be sufficient to effect a beneficial therapeutic response (e.g., increased subcutaneous adipogenesis) in the subject over time. The dose will be determined by the efficacy of the particular vehicle/delivery method employed, the site of administration, the route of administration, and the condition of the subject, as well as the body weight or surface area of the subject to be treated. The size of the dose also will be determined by the existence, nature, and extent of any adverse side-effects that accompany the administration of a particular peptide in a particular subject. The terms “effective amount” or “amount effective to” or “therapeutically effective amount” refers to an amount sufficient to induce a detectable therapeutic (or cosmetic) response in the subject (e.g. an amount sufficient to induce or to potentiate adipogenesis). In determining the effective amount of peptide to be administered, the attending physician will decide the dosage with which to treat each individual patient, taking into consideration a variety of factors, such as age, body weight, general health, diet, sex, peptide and formulation to be administered, route of administration, the severity of the condition being treated and the response of the subject and any adverse effects (e.g., irritation or allergies). The peptides described herein can also be administered at a rate determined by the LD50 of the peptide and/or the therapeutic efficacy/activity of the peptide, and the side-effects of the peptide at various concentrations, as applied to the mass and overall health of the subject. The dose of peptide can vary widely, and will be selected primarily based on activity of the active ingredient, and body weight in accordance with the particular mode of administration selected and the subject's needs. Concentrations, however, will typically be selected to provide dosages ranging from about 0.1 to about 50 mg/kg/day or more. Typical dosages range from about 1 mg/kg/day to about 50 mg/kg/day, about 2 mg/kg/day to about 30 mg/kg/day, or about 3 mg/kg/day to about 20 mg/kg/day, such as about 3 mg/kg/day to about 3.5 mg/kg/day, preferably from about 3.5 mg/kg/day to about 7.2 mg/kg/day, more preferably from about 7.2 mg/kg/day to about 11.0 mg/kg/day, or most preferably from about 11.0 mg/kg/day to about 15.0 mg/kg/day. Dosages of peptides can range from about 10 mg/kg/day to about 50 mg/kg/day. Alternatively, the dosages can range from about 20 mg to about 50 mg given twice daily. It will be appreciated that such dosages may be varied to optimize a therapeutic and/or cosmetic regimen in a particular subject or group of subjects. Administration can be accomplished via single or divided doses, e.g., doses administered on a regular basis (e.g., once daily or twice daily) for a period of time (e.g., 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 days or 1-3 weeks or more). The peptides described herein can be administered systemically (e.g., orally, or as an injectable) in accordance with standard methods well known to those of skill in the art. Peptides can be administered to the oral cavity in various forms such as lozenges, aerosol sprays, mouthwash, coated swabs, and the like. Various buccal, and sublingual formulations are also contemplated. The peptides can be administered in a depot formulation when formulated as an injectable to provide treatment over a period of time. The peptides can be administered topically, e.g., to the skin surface, to a topical lesion or wound, to a surgical site, and the like. The peptides can also be delivered through the skin using conventional transdermal drug delivery systems, i.e., transdermal “patches” wherein the peptides are typically contained within a laminated structure that serves as a drug delivery device to be affixed to the skin. In such a structure, the drug composition is typically contained in a layer, or “reservoir,” underlying an upper backing layer. The term “reservoir” in this context refers to a quantity of active ingredient that is ultimately available for delivery to the surface of the skin. Thus, for example, the “reservoir” may include the active ingredient peptide in an adhesive on a backing layer of the patch, or in any of a variety of different matrix formulations known to those of skill in the art. The patch may contain a single reservoir, or it may contain multiple reservoirs. For example, the reservoir can comprise a polymeric matrix of a pharmaceutically acceptable contact adhesive material that serves to affix the system to the skin during drug delivery. Examples of suitable skin contact adhesive materials include, but are not limited to, polyethylenes, polysiloxanes, polyisobutylenes, polyacrylates, polyurethanes, and the like. Alternatively, for example, the drug-containing reservoir and skin contact adhesive are present as separate and distinct layers, with the adhesive underlying the reservoir which, in this case, may be either a polymeric matrix as described above, or it may be a liquid or hydrogel reservoir, or may take some other form. The backing layer in these laminates, which serves as the upper surface of the device, preferably functions as a primary structural element of the “patch” and provides the device with much of its flexibility. The material selected for the backing layer is preferably substantially impermeable to the peptides and any other materials that are present. Other formulations for topical delivery include, but are not limited to, ointments, gels, sprays, fluids, and creams. Ointments are semisolid preparations that are typically based on petrolatum or other petroleum derivatives. As with other carriers or vehicles, an ointment base should be inert, stable, nonirritating and nonsensitizing. Creams containing the selected peptide are typically viscous liquid or semisolid emulsions, often either oil-in-water or water-in-oil. Cream bases are typically water-washable, and contain an oil phase, an emulsifier and an aqueous phase. The oil phase, also sometimes called the “internal” phase, is generally comprised of petrolatum and a fatty alcohol such as cetyl or stearyl alcohol; the aqueous phase usually, although not necessarily, exceeds the oil phase in volume, and generally contains a humectant. The emulsifier in a cream formulation is generally a nonionic, anionic, cationic or amphoteric surfactant. The specific ointment or cream base to be used, as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, is one that will provide for optimum drug delivery. One or more peptides described herein can be provided as a “concentrate”, e.g., in a storage container (e.g., in a premeasured volume) ready for dilution, or in a soluble capsule ready for addition to a volume of water, alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, or other diluent. For example, the peptides can be lyophilized for later reconstitution. Uses The adipogenic peptides (or mimetics thereof) described herein find use in a number of applications. For example, enhancing the formation of subcutaneous fat has use in plastic surgery procedures since subcutaneous fat provides plumpness and firmness to skin. Aging skin contains less subcutaneous fat. Therefore administering one or more peptides described herein to the desired area to promote subcutaneous fat formation results in plumper and more youthful appearing skin. This approach can replace current methods for transplanting adipocytes from other areas of the body (e.g., the thigh or buttocks), a procedure that often exhibits a low success rate. The peptides described herein can be administered to selectively enhance subcutaneous adipose tissue (e.g., to enhance subcutaneous adipose tissue without substantially increasing visceral adipose and/or other adipose tissue). In response to administration of the peptides, adipocyte formation occurs in dermal fibroblasts and volume is added in a selected subcutaneous area in the subject. The peptides described herein can be used to reducing scarring. This can be accomplished by administering one or more of the peptides in an amount sufficient to reduce the area of scarring, and/or to improve the appearance of a scarred area. The scarring, for example, can be scarring produced by a burn, scarring produced by surgery, scarring produced by acne, scarring produced by a biopsy, or scarring produced by an injury. The peptides described herein can be used, e.g., in various cosmetic procedures, to improve the appearance of skin. This can be accomplished by administering one or more of the peptides in an amount sufficient to improve the appearance of skin in an area of a subject. Such administering can include subcutaneously administration to a region such as lips, eye lids, cheeks, forehead, chin, neck, and the like. The peptides can be used in these methods, or others to reduce wrinkles, reduce sagging skin, improve the surface texture of skin, diminish, remove or fill-in wrinkles, remove or diminish age spots, and/or remove dark circles under the eyes. These cosmetic applications are illustrative and not intended to be limiting. In view of the teachings provided herein, other cosmetic applications will be recognized by and available to one of skill in the art. The peptides described herein can be used to improve tissue volume in an area of a subject. This can be accomplished by administering one or more of the peptides described herein in an amount sufficient to increase tissue volume in an area of a subject. For example, the increase of tissue volume can involve firming or augmenting breast tissue and/or firming or augmenting tissue in the buttocks or other regions of the body or face. The peptides can also be used to smooth skin in an area of a subject. This can be accomplished by administering one or more of the peptides described herein in an amount sufficient to smooth skin in the desired area. The smoothing can include smoothing skin scarred by acne, smoothing areas of cellulite, smoothing or reducing stretch marks, and/or smoothing out wrinkles. The peptides described herein can be used to recruit stem cells to the formation of subcutaneous fat in a subject. This can be accomplished by administering one or more of the peptides described herein in an amount sufficient to recruit stem cells to the formation of subcutaneous fat. This has utility, for example, in various reconstructive surgical procedures and the like. The peptides described herein can be used to reconstructing tissue in a subject. Such reconstruction can include, for example, breast reconstruction (e.g. after surgery to remove tumors), or face or limb reconstruction (e.g. after car accident or burning). This can be accomplished by administering one or more of the peptides described herein in an amount to increase the volume of the tissue during or after a tissue reconstruction procedure. The peptides are optionally used in conjunction with tissue grafting material or other procedures that enhance youthful skin or repair of damaged tissues. The peptides can also be used to reduce heel pain in a subject by administering one or more of the peptides described herein in an amount sufficient to reduce heel pain experienced by the subject when walking. The peptides described herein can be administered for augmentation of subcutaneous fat to improve thermoregulation and/or improve immune function. The subject can be treated with the peptides to prevent disease or to treat ongoing disease associated with increased organ fat including but not limited to cardiovascular disease, and other obesity associated diseases. The administration in any of these methods can be local or systemic, and can be by any route described herein, such as topical, subcutaneous, transdermal, oral, nasal, vaginal, and/or rectal administration. Preferably, the peptides are administered by subcutaneous injection. Alternatively, the peptides are preferably administered topically in the form of a skin cream such as a face cream, or transdermally via a transdermal patch. While the uses and methods are described with respect to use in humans, they are also suitable for animal, e.g., veterinary use. Thus certain preferred organisms include, but are not limited to humans, non-human primates, canines, equines, felines, porcines, ungulates, largomorphs, and the like. Having described the invention in detail, it will be apparent that modifications and variations are possible without departing from the scope of the invention defined in the appended claims. EXAMPLES The following examples are offered to illustrate, but not to limit the claimed invention. Example 1 Assays to Measure Adipogenesis The following assays were used to assess adipogenic activity of the peptides in the experiments described below in Example 2. Assay 1 Reagents: (1) 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) solution: 0.5M in DMSO; (2) Insulin solution: 10 mg/mL recombinant human insulin; (3) Dexamethasone solution in 10 mM in ethanol; (4) Oil Red O (0.36% in 60% isopropanol) or BODIPY dye (BODIPY 493/503 (4,4-difluoro-1,3,5,7-tetramethyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene-8-propionic acid, succinimidyl ester) from Invitrogen at 4-10 μM). Preparation of Media: Adipogenesis Initiation Media: mesenchymal stem cell expansion media/0.5 mM IBMX/1 μM dexamethasone. Mesenchymal stem cell expansion media is commercially available from Millipore. The IBMX Solution was diluted 1:1000 and the Dexamethasone Solution was diluted 1:10,000 in expansion media containing antibiotics and antimycotics. The prepared media was stored at 4° C. Adipogenesis Progression Media for positive control: mesenchymal stem cell expansion media/10 μg/mL insulin. The Insulin Solution was diluted 1:1000 in the expansion media and stored at 4° C. Experimental Adipogenesis Progression Media: mesenchymal stem cell expansion media/1-100 μg/mL RHAMM antagonist peptides. Adipogenesis Maintenance Media: mesenchymal stem cell expansion media containing antibiotics and antimycotics. Negative Control Media: DMEM/10% normal calf serum. Assay Method: Pre-adipocyte stem cells including bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells and fibroblasts including reticular and papillary dermal fibroblasts were propagated using standard tissue culture methods. Cells were trypsinized to remove the cells from the substratum. The trypsin was neutralized and cells were counted using a hemocytometer. Cells were resuspended at 30,000 cells/mL in expansion media. 1 mL of cell suspension was plated per well of 24-well plate, with several wells left empty for blank well staining. Cells were incubated for 1-2 days until they reached confluency. Approximately 1.8 mL of media was removed from each well and replaced with 2 mL Adipogenesis Initiation Media. For negative control wells, expansion media only was used at this step and for subsequent media changes. For all media changes, media was replaced as gently as possible to avoid disturbing the monolayer. Cells were incubated for 48 hours at 37° C., 5% CO2. 2 mL media was removed from each well, and replaced with 2 mL either positive control or experimental Adipogenesis Progression Media per well. Cells were again incubated for 48 hours at 37° C., 5% CO2. 2 mL of media was removed from each well and replaced with 2 mL Adipogenesis Maintenance Media per well. In addition, media was added to the empty wells reserved for blank well staining Cells were incubated for at least 48 hours at 37° C., 5% CO2. Media was replaced every 48-72 hours. Accumulation of intracellular lipid droplets continued for at least 5 days. Quantification of Adipogenesis: Oil Red O Staining For quantification of Oil Red O staining, media was removed and cells were washed twice with PBS, using care to gently add the PBS. 0.5 mL Oil Red O solution was added per well of 24-well plate, including to the wells lacking cells, but containing media. Cells were incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature. The staining solution was then removed and wells were washed three times with 1 mL of phosphate buffered saline (PBS). In some experiments, following removal of the last wash, stained plates were scanned or photographed. Adipogenesis was quantified using a spectrophotometer or fluorometer. 0.25 mL Dye Extraction Solution (isopropyl alcohol) was added per well, and the plate was set on an orbital shaker or platform rocker for 15-30 minutes. Extracted dye was transferred into a cuvette and absorbance was read in a spectrophotometer at visible range for oil red 0 or transferred to a 96-well plate and quantified in a plate reader. BODIPY Staining For quantification of BODIPY dye uptake, media was removed and cells were washed twice with PBS, using care to gently add the PBS. Cells were then fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde, washed in PBS then incubated for 1 hour in the dark with the BODIPY solution, prepared in PBS. Monolayers were washed and then extracted for measurement of dye in a fluorometer or mounted on slides and examined in a confocal fluorescent microscope. Blank Well Staining The stain extracted from wells lacking cells represents non-specific binding of the dye to the plate. This value was subtracted from the absorbances of experimental wells to obtain a more accurate assessment of specific staining. Assay 2 Reagents: The dexamethasone, insulin, and Oil Red O solutions were the same as described above for assay 1. Indomethacin Solution contained 10 mM indomethacin in methanol. The BODIPY 493/503 dye was used at a concentration of 4 μM. Preparation of Media: Adipogenesis Maintenance Media was prepared as described above. Adipogenesis Induction Media: To prepare 501 mL of Adipogenesis Induction Media, 50 μL of the 10 mM stock solution of dexamethasone, 500 μL of the 10 mg/ml stock solution of insulin, 5 ml of a 10 mM stock solution of indomethacin, and 5 mL of a 100× stock solution of penicillin and streptomycin were added to 490 mL of mesenchymal stem cell expansion media. Assay Method: Pre-adipocyte stem cells, bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells and fibroblasts such as dermal reticular and papillary fibroblasts were propagated using standard tissue culture methods. Cells were trypsinized to remove cells from the substratum, the trypsin was neutralized, and cells were counted using a hemocytometer. Cells were resuspended at 60,000 cells/ml in low glucose DMEM containing 10% calf serum. 1 mL of cell suspension per well was plated in a 24-well plate, with several wells left empty for blank well staining. Cells were incubated overnight and had reached confluency at this point. Approximately 1.8 ml of media was removed from each well and replaced with 2 ml Adipogenesis Induction Media. For negative control wells, expansion medium only was used at this step and for subsequent media changes. For all media changes, media was replaced as gently as possible to avoid disturbing the monolayer. Cells were incubated for 3 days at 37° C., 5% CO2, media was replaced with fresh Adipogenesis Induction Media, and cells were incubated for an additional three days, at which point adipogenesis could be observed in about 5-10% of cells. Media was removed and replaced with 2 ml of maintenance medium containing either RHAMM antagonist peptides (experimental group) or insulin (concentration as in the induction medium used as positive control). Cells were incubated for 3 days at 37° C., 5% CO2. Media was removed and BODIPY or Oil Red O staining was performed as described above for assay 1. Example 2 Identification and Testing of Adipogenic Peptides Ablation of RHAMM expression promotes adipogenesis (Tolg et al., 2006, J Cell Biol). A RHAMM carboxy-terminal sequence [AA681LDAFEAEKQA LLNEHGATQE QLNKIRDSYA QLLGHQNLKQ KIKHVVKLKD ENSQLKSEVS KLRSQLVKRK QNELRLQGEL DKALGIRHFD PSKAFCHASK ENFTPLKEGN PNCCaa794 (SEQ ID NO: 91)] was produced as a recombinant protein, and antibodies were prepared to this protein fragment. It was shown that both the protein fragment and the antibody promoted adipogenesis using a commercially available mesenchymal stem cell kit. The results indicated that this 114 amino acid protein fragment contains adipogenic activity. We hypothesized that the fragment and the antibody were blocking RHAMM function by competitive inhibition and by direct binding/blocking of RHAMM, respectively. Using truncation analyses, the size of the peptide was further reduced to 32 amino acids (LKQKIKHVVKLKDENSQLKSEVSKLRSQLVKR (SEQ ID NO: 92)) and it was shown that adipogenic activity is localized to a 15 amino acid peptide (KLKDENSQLKSEVSK (SEQ ID NO: 2); “peptide B” or “B-1” herein) shown in FIG. 2. This peptide was chemically synthesized to use as a competitive blocker, and antibodies were prepared against this sequence tagged with keyhold lymphocyte hemacyanin (KLH) to directly bind/block RHAMM function. Both reagents effectively block RHAMM function and promote adipogenesis in tissue culture and in vivo. The RHAMM sequence that contains adipogenic activity also contains the hyaluronan binding region of this protein. An unbiased screening of a random phage library for peptides that bind to hyaluronan was therefore performed, and identified a hyaluronan binding peptide (SEQ ID NO: 1, peptide P15-1, also referred to as P-1) that similarly promotes adipogenesis in tissue culture and in vivo. The sequence of peptide P15-1 is shown in FIG. 7. Examples of the adipogenic effects of RHAMM antagonists (peptide B (SEQ ID NO: 2), peptide P15-1 (SEQ ID NO. 1), and the antibody to peptide B) are summarized in Table 1. Peptide P15-1, peptide B, and a RHAMM antibody were assayed for their effects on pre-adipocyte stem cells in culture and when injected into the dermis of aged rats. Reagents were ranked on a scale of 0-5 with 5 representing the highest possible score and a completely filled in Harvey ball. “2D” refers to two-dimensional tissue culture. TABLE 1 The adipogenic potential of peptide and antibody reagents. 2D rat Pre- 2D human adipocytes (rat In vivo Pre- mesenchymal stem cells) Rat skin adipocytes peptide P15-1 2 2 2 (SEQ ID NO: 1) peptide B 5 5 5 (SEQ ID NO: 2) Antibody 4 4 4 All of these reagents can replace insulin in their ability to promote adipogenesis in mesenchymal stem cells or papillary fibroblasts. However, peptide B (SEQ ID NO: 2) was the most adipogenic of these reagents (Table 1) and was therefore further characterized in culture for dose range activity and several animal models in vivo. FIG. 3A shows the adipogenic effect of insulin in assays 1 and 2 in bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells. The negative controls in this experiment were cells cultured in maintenance medium only. As shown in FIGS. 3B and 3C, and the micrographs in FIG. 4, in bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells, a maximum adipogenic effect was obtained at 1-5 μg of peptide B (SEQ ID NO: 2), depending upon the screening assay used. FIG. 4 shows the adipogenic effect of peptide B in rat bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells using assay 1. The arrows in FIG. 4 indicate lipid droplets, and “priming stimulus” refers to the treatment of the cells with dexamethasone and IBMX. In vivo, 25-50 μg of peptide B (SEQ ID NO: 2)/injection site in a rat dermal skin model of adipogenesis induced significant fat accumulation (fat pads shown in FIG. 10). There was not an obvious difference between the two types of adipogenic reagents (antibody and peptide B) in vivo and both were most effective in old females (see, FIGS. 5A and 5B). In FIGS. 5A and 5B, data are shown as a ratio of the area (“surface area”) of fat pads expressed as a ratio of experimental/control values. FIG. 5A shows the effect of the antibody to peptide B and FIG. 5B shows the effect of peptide B. Peptide B (SEQ ID NO: 2) was also tested for its effect in nude guinea pigs since their skin structure resembles human facial skin. In particular, the skin of this animal model is more similar to human skin than is rat skin, in that it is hairless and the keratinocyte layer is thicker than in the rat model. As shown in FIGS. 6, H and E staining revealed an increase in subcutaneous fat deposition was observed on the upper back of these animals and in the ear fat pad after injection of peptide B in both locations (control animals were injected with a collagen gel vehicle only). Thus, peptide B was effective in promoting adipogenesis in this nude guinea pig model. In order to identify additional adipogenic peptides and to identify the key adipogenic sequences, two approaches were used. In the first, an unbiased screen was performed to identify hyaluronan-binding peptides using 15-mer random phage libraries. Peptide sequences identified in this screen were sorted for: (a) their alignment to the HA binding region of RHAMM, and (b) their lack of alignment to the HA binding region of CD44. Peptide P15-1 was identified in this manner. Peptide P15-1 has the sequence STMMSRSHKTRSHHV (SEQ ID NO: 1). In the second approach, a series of truncations and alanine mutagenesis on peptide B (SEQ ID NO: 2) were performed in order to identify the smallest active sequence. Fragments of peptide B were prepared and assayed for adipogenesis. First, fragments corresponding to the two halves of peptide B were prepared (KLKDENS (SEQ ID NO:93) and SQLKSEVSK (SEQ ID NO: 44)). Only the SQLKSEVSK (SEQ ID NO: 44) fragment was found to be adipogenic. This fragment was then further shortened to LKSEVSK (SEQ ID NO: 42) and KSEVSK (SEQ ID NO: 3), both of which were also found to be adipogenic. Thus, the truncation experiments identified a 9-mer (SQLKSEVSK (SEQ ID NO: 44)), a 7-mer (LKSEVSK (SEQ ID NO: 42)) and a 6-mer (KSEVSK (SEQ ID NO: 3)) that exhibited adipogenic activity (see FIGS. 7, 8, and 9). In FIG. 7, the 7-mer is referred to as Fragment A and the 9-mer is referred to as Fragment C. In FIGS. 8 and 9, “−ve control” refers to the negative control, and “+ve control” refer so the positive control). FIG. 8 shows the adipogenic effects of the 6-mer (KSEVSK (SEQ ID NO: 3)) in assays 1 and 2. In FIG. 9, the upper panel of micrographs shows results from assays 1 and 2, and the lower panel of micrographs shows results from assay 1. In the upper panel of FIG. 9, the panels labeled “control” are a positive control (induction plus insulin). In the lower panel of FIG. 9, the cells in the untreated control were treated only with maintenance medium. Peptide P15-1 (SEQ ID NO: 1) was also truncated to create a 9-mer having the sequence STMMSRSHK (“Fragment B”; SEQ ID NO: 62). As shown in FIG. 7, this 9-mer also has adipogenic activity. As shown in FIG. 7, these fragments all had approximately the same adipogenic activity suggesting that the specific activity (activity per weight unit) is highest for the 6-mer KSEVSK (SEQ ID NO: 3). Specific activities (Table 2) were calculated for peptide B (SEQ ID NO: 2) and the 9-mer, 7-mer and 6-mer fragments (SEQ ID NOs: 44, 42, and 3, respectively) using adipogenesis data obtained in assays 1 and 2 as described above, and it was unexpectedly found that the 6-mer had the highest specific activity. TABLE 2 Specific activity of peptide B and the 9-, 7-, and 6-mers in rat mesenchymal stem cells. Specific Molecular Fold adipogenic activity weight induction vs. (activity/1000 Assay 1 (daltons) negative control daltons) Peptide B (15mer) 1839.03 1.85 1.0 (SEQ ID NO: 2) 9mer (SEQ ID NO: 44) 1135.22 2.4 2.11 7mer (SEQ ID NO: 42) 883.99 2 2.26 6mer (SEQ ID NO: 3) 752.81 2.83 3.76 Specific Molecular Fold adipogenic activity weight induction vs. (activity/1000 Assay 2 (Daltons) negative control daltons) 15mer (SEQ ID NO: 2) 1839.03 4.0 2.17 9mer (SEQ ID NO: 44) 1135.22 3.0 2.64 7mer (SEQ ID NO: 42) 883.99 3 3.39 6mer (SEQ ID NO: 3) 752.81 2.5 3.32 These results were surprising and unexpected and show that a shorter peptide is more active than longer peptides. In particular, the increased specific activity of the 6-mer (KSEVSK; SEQ ID NO: 3) as compared to peptide B (SEQ ID NO: 2; a 15-mer) was unexpected, since both the 6-mer and peptide B contain the same number key hyaluronan binding sequences. The 6-mer (KSEVSK; SEQ ID NO: 3) was tested for adipogenic effect in rat skin in vivo. The results of this testing are shown in the photographs in FIG. 10. The 6-mer is able to induce large fat pads, possibly larger than peptide B. Example 3 Adipogenic Activity of Peptide B (SEQ ID NO: 2) and the KSEVSK 6-Mer (SEQ ID NO:3) in Rat Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Stem Cells Further experiments were performed to characterize the adipogenic activity of peptide B (SEQ ID NO: 2) and the KSEVSK 6-mer (SEQ ID NO:3) using rat bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells. FIG. 11 shows the adipogenic effects of 0.1-25 μg of peptide B (FIG. 11A) and the KSEVSK 6-mer (FIG. 11B) as quantified by absorption of Oil Red O at 520 nm. Results are based on fold increase compared with negative control. The data are presented as mean±standard error (n=3). Assay 1 as described above in Example 1 was used to generate the results shown in FIG. 11. Both peptide B and the KSEVSK 6-mer significantly stimulated adipogenesis as compared to the negative control. The adipogenic effects of peptide B and the KSEVSK 6-mer in rat bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells were also quantified using image analysis and measurement of the number of fat droplets relative to negative controls. The results of these experiments are shown in FIGS. 12A (peptide B) and 12B (KSEVSK 6-mer). Both peptide B and the KSEVSK 6-mer significantly stimulated adipogenesis as compared to the negative control. Results are based on fold increase compared with negative control. Data presented as mean±standard error (n=3). Assay 1 as described above in Example 1 was used to generate the results shown in FIG. 12. Example 4 Adipogenic Activity of Peptide B (SEQ ID NO: 2) and the KSEVSK 6-Mer (SEQ ID NO:3) in Human Primary Cells The above examples illustrate that peptide B and the KSEVSK 6-mer promote adipogenesis in multi-potential stem cells such as bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells. These cells are minor contributors to subcutaneous fat pads. Therefore, the adipogenic effects of peptide B (SEQ ID NO: 2) and the KSEVSK 6-mer (SEQ ID NO: 3) were also examined in human primary cells directly isolated from human subcutaneous fat or dermal tissue. Subcutaneous fat depots are rich sources of multi-potential stem cells, which have varying levels of progenitor capability. Human adipose-derived stem cells (h-ADSCs) can differentiate into multiple mesenchymal phenotypes including adipocytes, osteoblasts and chondrocytes and this population of adipose derived stem cells includes bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells that have previously trafficked into subcutaneous fat depots. Other adipose derived stem cells are progenitor cells in that they are more restricted in their differentiation repertoire. Thus, pre-adipocytes are restricted to differentiate into adipocytes upon appropriate stimulation. Fibroblasts, in particular those derived from the lower dermis or reticular dermal layer of skin, have also been reported trans-differentiate adipocytes. This hierarchy is shown in FIG. 13. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells traffic to skin and are multipotential, giving rise to committed adipocyte progenitors as well as other mesenchymal cell types. Pre-adipocyte progenitors are committed to differentiating into adipocytes. Adipocytes can give rise to dermal fibroblasts, which retain the ability to revert to adipocytes. The inset in FIG. 13 shows the subcutaneous fat layer in skin, which contains fat cells (arrows), lipid in vacuoles, and the stem cells shown in the diagram in FIG. 13. Differentiation of Human Adipose-Derived Stem Cells (h-ADSCs) Human adipose-derived stem cells (h-ADSCs) were cultured in 24-well dishes and differentiated into adipocytes using a commercial adipogenic cocktail (Adipocyte Differentiation Medium (ZenBio, Chapel Hill, N.C., catalog no. DM-2)) as the positive adipogenic stimulus. The Adipocyte Differentiation Medium contained DMEM/Ham's F-12 (1:1 v/v), HEPES pH 7.4, fetal bovine serum, biotin, penicillin, streptomcyin, amphotericin B, pantothenate, human insulin, dexamethasone, isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX) and a PPARγ agonist. This positive stimulus was used as the positive control. As shown in FIG. 14, h-ASDCs differentiated into adipocytes in response to the adipogenic cocktail (darkly staining cells in the positive control panels of FIG. 14) while negative controls that did not receive an adipogenic stimulus did not undergo differentiation. The upper right panel and the lower left panel of FIG. 14 provide two different fields of view of the h-ASDCs exposed to the adipogenic cocktail at 4× magnification. Monolayers that were maintained in Preadipocyte Medium only (ZenBio catalog no. PM-1, containing DMEM/Ham's F-12 (1:1 v/v), HEPES 7.4, fetal bovine serum, penicillin, streptomcyin, and amphotericin B) or monolayers that were exposed to the adipogenic cocktail without insulin and PPARγ agonist were both used as negative controls. These negative controls exhibited similar low levels of adipogenesis. The negative controls shown in FIG. 15 were exposed to Preadipocyte Medium only. The positive control resulted in levels of adipogenesis that were most often intermediate between the negative control and the adipogenic peptides (FIG. 15A). The adipogenic peptides (peptide B and the KSEVSK 6-mer) were mixed into adipogenic cocktail that lacked the PPARγ agonist and/or insulin and used as the experimental condition. The adipogenic cocktail (positive control) stimulated the appearance of adipocytes, detected by presence of lipid droplets (FIG. 15A, upper right panel) in h-ADSC monolayers two weeks after the initiation of the assay. In this experiment, the 6-mer KSEVSK peptide (SEQ ID NO: 3) was more effective at promoting adipogenesis than the positive control (FIG. 15A, lower panel; “Six-mer RHAMM peptide”). To quantify the adipogenic activity of the KSEVSK 6-mer (SEQ ID NO: 3) and the B peptide (SEQ ID NO: 2), h-ADSCs were exposed to 5 μg/ml of these peptides in the adipogenic cocktail in the absence of insulin and PPARγ agonist). The experiment was terminated two weeks after the addition of adipogenic mixtures. At this time, photographs of monolayers were taken and the lipid droplet accumulation was quantified by measuring the absorbance of extracted Oil Red 0. As shown in FIG. 15B, both the KSEVSK 6-mer (SEQ ID NO: 3) and the B peptide (SEQ ID NO: 2) strongly promoted adipogenesis compared to the negative control (p<0.05). The peptides stimulated adipogenesis to a similar extent when the PPARγ agonist alone or both the PPARγ agonist and insulin were deleted from the adipogenic cocktail (not shown). These results show that both the 15-mer B peptide and the KSEVSK 6-mer peptide are able to substitute for adipogenic stimuli acting through PPARγ (e.g. insulin). In further studies using h-ADSCs, two different protocols were used. In the first of these protocols, h-ADSCs were exposed to the adipogenic cocktail plus the KSEVSK 6-mer (SEQ ID NO: 3) or B peptide (SEQ ID NO: 2) at concentrations of 5 μg/ml or 20 μg/ml. Results were compared to the effects of the cocktail alone and to negative controls, which did not receive an adipogenic stimulus. In the second of these protocols, h-ADSCs were exposed to adipogenic cocktail in which the PPARγ agonist was replaced with either the KSEVSK 6-mer or the B peptide at concentrations of 5 μg/ml or 20 μg/ml. FIG. 16 shows that h-ADSCs underwent adipogenesis in response to 5 μg/ml of the B peptide in the presence (upper panels) or absence (lower panels) of PPARγ agonist. FIG. 17 shows that h-ADSCs underwent adipogenesis in response to 5 μg/ml (upper panels) or 20 μg/ml (lower panels) of the KSEVSK 6-mer peptide (SEQ ID NO: 3) in the presence of PPARγ agonist. FIG. 18 shows that h-ADSCs underwent adipogenesis in response to 5 μg/ml (upper panels) or 20 μg/ml (lower panels) of the KSEVSK 6-mer peptide in the absence of PPARγ agonist. Adipogenesis was quantified by absorption detection of Oil Red O at 520 nm as shown in FIG. 19. Statistical analysis were performed compared to negative control. Data presented as mean±standard error (n=3). Differentiation of Human Subcutaneous Pre-Adipocytes Human subcutaneous pre-adipocytes were cultured in 24-well dishes and differentiated into adipocytes using the commercial adipogenic cocktail described above (Adipocyte Differentiation Medium (ZenBio catalog no. DM-2)) as the positive adipogenic stimulus. As noted above, this adipogenic cocktail contained pantothenate, dexamethasone, isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX), human insulin and a PPARγ agonist. For these experiments, the following conditions were used as negative controls: (1) Preadipocyte Medium only; (2) the adipogenic cocktail without PPARγ agonist (PPARγ-); and (3) the adipogenic cocktail without PPARγ agonist or human insulin. Oil red 0 staining for the negative and positive control conditions is shown in FIG. 20. The three types of negative controls were not significantly different from one another and FIG. 21 uses values for the monolayers maintained in Preadipocyte Medium only as the negative control. FIG. 21 shows the adipogenic effects of the B peptide (SEQ ID NO: 2) and the KSEVSK 6-mer (SEQ ID NO:3) in human subcutaneous pre-adipocytes. The positive control for FIG. 21 was the complete adipogenic medium containing both the PPARγ agonist and insulin: The experimental cocktail contained the B peptide or the KSEVSK 6-mer, but lacked PPARγ agonist and insulin. Adipogenesis levels were quantified by measuring extracted Oil Red 0. The pre-adipocytes maintained in Preadipocyte Medium alone (negative controls) did not differentiate into adipocytes (FIG. 21). The positive control stimulated appearance of lipid droplets (data not shown), which was statistically significant vs. the negative control (p<0.05). The addition of either the KSEVSK 6-mer or B peptide both significantly (p<0.05) increased adipogenesis above the negative control levels. FIGS. 22-24 show Oil Red O staining for human primary subcutaneous pre-adipocytes. FIG. 22 shows that the KSEVSK 6-mer (SEQ ID NO: 3) stimulates adipogenesis of human primary subcutaneous preadipocytes in the absence of PPARγ agonist. FIG. 23 shows that the KSEVSK 6-mer also stimulates adipogenesis of human primary subcutaneous preadipocytes in the absence of both insulin and PPARγ agonist. FIG. 24 shows that the B peptide (SEQ ID NO: 2) stimulates adipogenesis of human primary subcutaneous preadipocytes in the absence of both insulin and PPARγ agonist. FIG. 25 shows the adipogenic effect of peptide B (SEQ ID NO:2) and the KSEVSK 6-mer (SEQ ID NO: 3) on human subcutaneous pre-adipocytes as quantified by absorption detection of Oil Red O at 520 nm. The following conditions were used as negative controls: (Ctr no-γ)=monolayers cultured in adipogenic cocktail but without PPARγ agonist, (Ctr no-γ, no-Ins)=monolayers cultured in adipogenic cocktail but without PPARγ agonist or human insulin. To test the adipogenic activity of the KSEVSK 6-mer and B peptides, the human pre-adipocytes were exposed to the above negative controls plus either the KSEVSK 6-mer or the B peptide at concentrations of 5 μg/ml and 20 μg/ml. Statistical analysis were performed compared to negative control. Data presented as mean±standard error (n=3) Differentiation of Human Reticular Fibroblasts The B peptide and the KSEVSK 6-mer were also tested for their adipogenic effect on primary human dermal fibroblasts from the upper (papillary) and lower (reticular) dermal layers. The primary human fibroblasts were obtained from dermatome sections of biopsies from human volunteers. Cells were cultured and exposed to adipogenic medium. In these experiments, the B peptide and the KSEVSK 6-mer replaced insulin as the adipogenic stimulus. The peptides were used at a concentration of 5 μg/ml. Adipogenesis was assessed by Oil Red O staining. The B peptide (SEQ ID NO: 2) and the KSEVSK 6-mer (SEQ ID NO: 3) similarly stimulated the transdifferentiation of human reticular fibroblasts (HRF) into adipocytes but had no effect on human papillary fibroblasts (HPF) (FIGS. 26 and 27). White arrows show fat droplets. FIG. 28 shows further Oil Red O staining results for HRF and HPF treated with the B peptide. The B peptide stimulated the trans-differentiation of HRF into adipocytes but had no effect on HPF. Collectively, the results described in this Example indicate that blocking RHAMM function with antagonist RHAMM peptides (the B peptide and the KSEVSK ti-mer) promotes adipogenesis in at least three target cell populations including multi-potential stem cells resident in skin, lineage restricted pre-adipocytes and subpopulations of fibroblasts (e.g. reticular fibroblasts). These results are summarized in FIG. 29, where the size of the star indicates the relative degree of stimulating effect of the peptides. Our results suggest that the effect of RHAMM peptides is stronger on multi-potential stem cells than committed or differentiated (fibroblast) skin cells but that there are multiple targets for these peptides in human skin. Example 5 Adipogenic activity of peptide B in 3D Culture The adipogenic activity of peptide B (SEQ ID NO:2) was also examined using a three-dimensional (3D) culture system that models human skin. Human pre-adipocytes were cultured in 3D collagen gels in the presence of the adipogenic cocktail described above (Adipocyte Differentiation Medium (ZenBio catalog no. DM-2)) and exposed to peptide B (SEQ ID NO: 2). As shown in FIG. 30, peptide B promoted adipogenesis as detected by the appearance of light refractory lipid droplets. These results show that peptide B promotes adipogenesis of human adipocyte progenitor cells under more physiological conditions. The 3D results predict the ability of the B peptide to promote adipogenesis in vivo. Example 6 In vivo Adipogenic Activity of the KSEVSK 6-mer in a Rat Model The adipogenic activity of the KSEVSK 6-mer (SEQ ID NO: 3) was also evaluated in vivo in a female retired breeder rat model. Female Fisher retired breeder rats (>9 months old) were used in these studies. The rats were injected subcutaneously with a 100 μg dose of the KSEVSK 6-mer peptide in 1 ml of a collagen vehicle or with collagen vehicle alone. The collagen vehicle contained 1 mg/ml of rat tail Type I collagen. As illustrated in FIG. 31, each rat received injections at four sites on their backsides. Rats were injected with KSEVSK 6-mer peptide and collagen vehicle at sites A and C and with collagen vehicle only at sites B and D. Animals were maintained on a regular diet for 7 days and then euthanized Skin was harvested by cutting around the injected area, ensuring that underlying adipose tissue was retained with the skin at the injection sites. The tissue was then photographed and fat accumulation was assessed. FIG. 31 shows fat pad formation in a rat following subcutaneous injection of a 100 μg dose of the KSEVSK 6-mer peptide in 1 ml of a collagen vehicle as compared to injection of collagen alone. The upper panel of FIG. 31 shows the injection sites for the collagen+KSEVSK 6-mer peptide and for the collagen vehicle alone. The lower panel of FIG. 31 shows subcutaneous fat formation in the rats injected with the KSEVSK 6-mer as compared to collagen vehicle alone (“control”). Dotted lines in the lower panel of FIG. 31 mark the outlines of fat pads. FIG. 32 shows the effect of the KSEVSK 6-mer (SEQ ID NO: 3) on fat pad surface area following subcutaneous injection of a 100 μg dose of the KSEVSK 6-mer into the rat model. Fat pads resulting from exposure to the KSEVSK 6-mer peptide were significantly larger those induced by collagen vehicle alone. In FIG. 32, “total top” refers to the average accumulated fat for injections at injection site A (collagen+peptide) or B (collagen only), and “total bottom” refers to the average accumulated fat for injections at site C (collagen+peptide) or D (collagen only). Example 7 Alanine Mutagenesis of the KSEVSK 6-Mer (SEQ ID NO:3) To identify the key amino acids needed for an adipogenic effect, alanine mutagenesis of the KSEVSK 6-mer (SEQ ID NO: 3) was performed. Each amino acid of the KSEVSK 6-mer was mutated to an alanine residue to create the following peptides: ASEVSK (SEQ ID NO: 38), KAEVSK (SEQ ID NO: 39), KSAVSK (SEQ ID NO: 32), KSEASK (SEQ ID NO: 22), KSEVAK (SEQ ID NO: 40), and KSEVSA (SEQ ID NO: 41). The adipogenic effect of each of these peptides was assessed in rat mesenchymal stem cells using Assays 1 and 2 as described above in Example 1. Adipogenesis was quantified by Oil Red O staining Each peptide was tested at concentrations of 0.5, 5, and 50 μg/ml over a period of 3 weeks. Cells were plated in 48-well culture plates, and the purity of the peptides was >95%. All data are presented as the fold change relative to the negative control (Ctr(−))±standard error. Since there appeared to be a link between hyaluronan binding and adipogenesis and since hyaluronan binding requires basic residues, the flanking lysine (K) residues were first mutated. The results of these experiments are shown in FIGS. 33 (Assay 1) and 34 (Assay 2). As shown in FIG. 33, in Assay 1, unexpectedy the substitution of either of the flanking lysine residues (positions 1 and 6) with alanine residues did not not reduce adipogenic activity. Single amino acid substitution of the glutamate residue at position 3, the valine residue at position 4, and the serine residue at position 5 with alanine was also performed. The substitutions at position 3 and 4, and to a lesser extent the substitution at position 5, resulted in a decrease in adipogenic activity in Assay 1, indicating that these amino acids contribute to the adipogenic effects of the peptides (FIG. 33). In Assay 2, single alanine substitutions generally had no effect on the adipogenic activity of the peptides (FIG. 34). Peptides in which two residues of the KSEVSK 6-mer were mutated to alanines were also synthesized and tested for adipogenic activity. In particular, peptides wherein the amino acids at positions 1 and 6, 2 and 5, or 3 and 4 were replaced with alanine residues were synthesized. The results of these studies are shown in FIGS. 33 and 34. As shown in FIG. 33, in assay 1, the ASEVSA double mutant (SEQ ID NO: 93) was unexpectedly found to have significantly increased adipogenic activity as compared to both the negative control and the KSEVSK 6-mer (SEQ ID NO: 3). By contrast, in Assay 2, double substitutions reduced adipogenic activity (FIG. 34). As described above in Example 1, two different adipogenesis assays were used herein to assess the adipogenic effects of the peptides in rat mesenchymal stem cells. Assay 1 is an assay that is typically used to promote transdifferentiation of fibroblasts into adipocytes, whereas Assay 2 is typically used to promote differentiation of multi-potential mesenchymal progenitor cells into adipocytes. Immortalized rat bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells were used for both assays. These cells contain cells of different lineages, including fibroblasts, pre-adipocytes, pre-chondrocytes and pre-osteoblasts. Thus, Assay 1 was used to promote transdifferentiation of the fibroblast lineages into adipocytes and Assay 2 was used to promote differentiation of the pre-adipocytes into adipocytes. As described in Example 1 above, the priming stimulus for Assay 1 includes IBMX (3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine) and dexamethasone, and then insulin as the final adipogenic stimulus. The priming stimulus for assay 2 includes IBMX, dexamethasone and indomethacin, and then insulin as the final adipogenic stimulus. It was unexpectedly found that the amino acid requirements in the KSEVSK sequence are much less stringent for differentiation of pre-adipocytes into adipocytes than for trans-differentiation of fibroblasts into adipocytes. For example, the amino acids at positions 3, 4, 5, and 6 were found to be important for transdifferentiation of fibroblasts, but single amino acid changes at these positions had only minor effects on pre-adipocyte differentiation. Rather, dual mutations were necessary in order to ablate adipogenic activity of the KSEVSK 6-mer in the pre-adipocyte assay (Assay 2). Mutating both amino acids 1 and 6 to alanine resulted in an unexpected increase in adipogenic activity relative to the KSEVSK peptide in the transdifferentiation assay (assay 1), but these modifications ablated adipogenic activity in the pre-adipocyte assay (assay 2). Collectively, these results indicate that the effect of blocking RHAMM function in conditions that promote fibroblast differentiation into adipocytes are different from those that promote pre-adipocte differentiation into adipocytes. These results further show that it is possible to design peptides that will selectively target specific cell types (e.g., fibroblasts vs. progenitor cells) to very selectively promote adipogenesis. Example 8 Truncation of the KSEVSK 6-Mer (SEQ ID NO:3) In addition, shorter sequences were also examined and it was discovered that pentamers also exhibited adipogenic activity. Pentamers in which each of the flanking lysine residues were deleted were also synthesized. As shown in FIG. 35, these pentamers (KSEVS (SEQ ID NO. 82) and SEVSK (SEQ ID NO: 83)) were both much less active than the KSEVSK (SEQ ID NO: 3) hexamer, confirming the importance of the terminal lysine residues. However, both pentamers still exhibited a low level of adipogenic activity (in FIG. 13, A2-Ctrl(−)X10 is the negative control, A2-1X10 is a dose of 1 μg, A2-5X10 is a dose of 5 μg, and A2-25X10 is a dose of 25 μg; y-axes are absorbance at 520 nm). The results of truncating the KSEVSK (SEQ ID NO: 3) peptide to pentamer peptides and the alanine substitution experiments show that the substitution of the flanking lysine residues does not ablate adipogenic activity, and indicate that substitution of of the two lysine residues with hydrophobic residues such as alanine can produce a peptide that has a higher level of adipogenic activity than the original RHAMM sequence of KSEVSK. Example 9 Identification and Characterization of KSEVSK-Like Adipogenic Sequences To identify a minimal motif sufficient to impart adipogenic activity to a peptide, the KSEVSK (SEQ ID NO: 3) hexamer was used to query the BLAST database to identify evolutionarily conserved sequences in RHAMM proteins from other organisms. The results of this query are shown below in Table 3. TABLE 3 Evolutionary conservation of the KSEVSK (SEQ ID NO: 3) sequence in RHAMM proteins from various species. Human, mouse, rat, cow, KSEVSK (SEQ ID NO: 3) and maccaca Goat KSEVLK (SEQ ID NO: 7) Xenopus laevis KQEVSK (SEQ ID NO: 4) Ciona intestinalis KQENTK (SEQ ID NO: 6) Taeniopygia guttata KQDVSK (SEQ ID NO: 8) Danio rerio* KQELDR (SEQ ID NO: 9) KQEVDK (SEQ ID NO: 5) KQEVSK (SEQ ID NO: 4) Thermatoga thermerum LEEIFK (SEQ ID NO: 10) Thermodesulfovibrio LSELEK (SEQ ID NO: 11) yellowstonii *The BLAST database includes Danio rerio RHAMM proteins sequences including each of the three listed sequences. In addition, a BLAST query of the KSEVSK (SEQ ID NO: 3) sequence identified a number of similar sequences found in other proteins linked to both adipogenesis and hyaluronan, for example Sox 2, Sox 21, and upstream binding factor-1. These sequences are shown below in Table 4. TABLE 4 KSEVSK (SEQ ID NO: 3)-like sequences found in proteins linked to adipogenesis and hyaluronan.

In view of the diversity of the amino acids at the second, third, fourth, and fifth positions of these sequences, it is expected that alanine mutagenesis at these positions will yield peptides having at least some adipogenic activity. Therefore, in generating the broadest motifs discussed herein, it was assumed that an alanine residue could be present at the second, third, fourth, or fifth position of the peptide. The peptides KSELRK (SEQ ID NO: 23), KSEVGK (SEQ ID NO: 19), and LSELEK (SEQ ID NO: 11) were tested for adipogenic effects in rat mesenchymal stem cells using Assays 1 and 2 as described above in Example 1. Adipogenesis was quantified by Oil Red O staining Each peptide was tested at concentrations of 0.5, 5, and 50 μg/ml over a period of 3 weeks. Cells were plated in 48-well culture plates, and the purity of the peptides was >95%. All data are presented as the fold change relative to the negative control (Ctr(−))±standard error. The results of these experiments are shown in FIGS. 36 (Assay 1) and 37 (Assay 2). In Assay 1, conservative changes at position 4 (e.g., a V to L) or position 1 or 5 did not strongly affect adipogenic activity. These results are consistent with the alanine substitution experiments described above. In Assay 2, the data suggest that single substitutions in amino acids do not strongly modify adipogenesis as predicted by the alanine substitution analyses for Assay 2, while double substitutions have a stronger effect (e.g., changing amino acids 1, 4, and 5 increased adipogenesis as shown by the results for LSELEK. These results indicate that KSEVSK peptide can be modified to increase, decrease or target adipogenic effects to specific cell types or differentiation programs (e.g., Assay 1 vs. Assay 2). Example 10 Identification and Characterization of STMMSR-Like Adipogenic Sequences As noted above, peptide P15-1 (SEQ ID NO: 1) was truncated to create a 9-mer having the sequence STMMSRSHK (“Fragment B”; SEQ ID NO: 62), and this 9-mer was shown to have adipogenic activity. Alignments of peptide P15-1 with the KSEVSK (SEQ ID NO: 3) hexamer using the COBALT and MUSCLE alignment tools revealed that the sequence KSEVSK aligns with the STMMSR portion of peptide P15-1, as shown below: KSEVSK--------- STMMSRSHKTRSHHV Thus, it is expected that shorter fragments of peptide P15-1 (SEQ ID NO: 1), and in particular the hexamer sequence STMMSR (SEQ ID NO: 51), will also have adipogenic activity. A BLAST query of the STMMSR sequence identified a number of similar sequences found in other proteins linked to both adipogenesis and hyaluronan, for example calcium binding protein 1, ribonuclease P protein, ADP ribosylation factor protein 5, transmembrane protein 236, plasma serine protease inhibitor, CD80, lysophosphatidic acid receptor, plasma serine protease inhibitor, angiopoietin 2, ADP-ribosylation factor binding protein, ubiquitin protein 2, clathrin heavy chain 2, metastasis suppressor protein 1, polycystin 2, and tetratricopeptide repeat protein 17. These sequences are shown below in Table 5. TABLE 5 STMMSR-like sequences found in proteins linked to adipogenesis and hyaluronan. Sequence (SEQ ID NO) Source Protein(s) SIMMSR (52) B-cell/CLL lymphoma protein 9 STLMSR (53) FAM 212B, olfactory receptor 5R1 STVMSR (54) dipeptidyl peptidase 4, splicing factor 3B STGLSR (55) E3 ubiquitin ligase RFWD2 STTMSR (56) metastasis suppressor 1 STRMSR (57) E3 ubiquitin ligase, RFWD2 STLMRR (58) mucin 16 STPVSR (59) mucin 16 The sequences in Table 5 were aligned with one another and with the STMMSR sequence (SEQ ID NO: 51) to generate the motifs described herein. The peptides STRMSR (SEQ ID NO: 57) and STTMSR (SEQ ID NO: 56) were tested for adipogenic effects in rat mesenchymal stem cells using Assays 1 and 2 as described above in Example 1. Adipogenesis was quantified by Oil Red O staining Each peptide was tested at concentrations of 0.5, 5, and 50 μg/ml over a period of 3 weeks. Cells were plated in 48-well culture plates, and the purity of the peptides was >95%. All data are presented as the fold change relative to the negative control (Ctr(−))±standard error. The results of these experiments are shown in FIGS. 38 (Assay 1) and 39 (Assay 2). The data show that the this group of peptides were weakly adipogenic in both Assays 1 and 2. In addition, as shown in FIGS. 38 and 39, the peptide STMMRSH (SEQ ID NO: 97) was also tested and was found to have significantly greater adipogenic activity than the negative control in Assay 1 at all concentrations tested, resembling KSEVSK in this assay, while in Assay 2 it was active at the 0.5 μg/ml concentration. The peptide SIMMSR (SEQ ID NO. 52) was also tested and was found to be weaky adipogenic in both Assays 1 and 2.
