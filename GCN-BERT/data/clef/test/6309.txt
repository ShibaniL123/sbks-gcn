BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates generally to a nursing aid and more specifically it relates to a nursing assistance device for aiding with the delivery of breast milk and/or formula while augmenting breastfeeding. 2. Description of the Related Art Any discussion of the related art throughout the specification should in no way be considered as an admission that such related art is widely known or forms part of common general knowledge in the field. In recent decades, it has become widely accepted that a mother's breast milk is preferable to formula in most infants. However, breastfeeding can be a challenge even with full term pregnancies with uncomplicated deliveries. The challenge of breastfeeding can be multiplied exponentially when there are delivery complications or pre-term infants. Most hospitals these days employ at least one lactation consultant due to the prevalence of problems with nursing. Pre-term infants often do not have the musculature or well-developed cheek fat pads necessary to properly latch onto a nipple and nurse. Also, mothers after complicated deliveries or with pre-term infants may experience difficulties with their milk supply and thus require at least partial use of formula. These mothers still often have a desire to experience nursing their newborn infant. Because of the inherent problems with the related art, there is a need for a new and improved nursing assistance device for aiding with the delivery of breast milk and/or formula while augmenting breastfeeding and facilitating nipple stimulation to increase a mother's milk supply. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The invention generally relates to a nursing aid which includes a housing adapted to be secured to the breast to aid in nursing. The housing includes an inner channel in which a syringe dispenser or dispenser tube may be positioned. Each of the dispensers includes an outlet tube through which fluids such as formula and/or breast milk may be dispensed alongside the nipple. The dispenser tube may be connected to various sources of fluid, such as a pouch. The lower surface of the housing includes a securing member such as a silicone adhesive pad, which will allow the lower surface of the housing to be removably and comfortably secured to the breast during use. The outlet tube is positioned directly alongside the nipple so that the infant may latch onto both the nipple and the outlet tube to augment breast feeding and facilitate nipple stimulation to increase a mother's milk supply. There has thus been outlined, rather broadly, some of the features of the invention in order that the detailed description thereof may be better understood, and in order that the present contribution to the art may be better appreciated. There are additional features of the invention that will be described hereinafter and that will form the subject matter of the claims appended hereto.

The securing member 50 may be comprised of various structures, including the use of a securing pad 50 as shown in the figures. The lower surface of the securing member 50 will be adapted to removably secure to the breast 12 and the upper surface of the securing member 30 may be fixedly or removably secured to the inner surface 22 of the housing 20 as shown throughout the figures. In some embodiments, the housing 20 may be adapted to directly engage with the skin of the breast 12 without a separate securing member 50, such as through use of an adhesive. In some embodiments, a securing member 50 may be omitted entirely. In a preferred embodiment, the securing member 50 will be comprised of a silicon adhesive pad as shown in the figures, though other types of pads and the like may be utilized to secure the housing 20 to the breast 12. For certain adhesive substances, a cover 42 may be positioned over the securing member 50 to retain its adhesiveness prior to use. The cover 42 may thus be removed just prior to securing the housing 20 to the breast 12. C. Dispensers As shown throughout the figures, a dispenser 50, 60 is positioned within the inner channel 30 of the housing 20 such that an outlet 57, 67 of the dispenser 50, 60 extends out of the front end 23 of the housing 20. The dispenser 50, 60 is utilized to store and/or dispense fluids through the outlet 57, 67 adjacent to the nipple 13 as shown in the figures. It should be appreciated that a wide range of dispensers 50, 60 may be utilized with the present invention. The figures illustrate two exemplary embodiments; a syringe dispenser 50 as shown in FIGS. 3 and 4 and a tube dispenser 60 as shown in FIGS. 1 and 2. The syringe dispenser 50 generally comprises a conventional syringe configuration as is known in the art. The syringe dispenser 50 thus includes a first end 51 and a second end 52 with a chamber 53 extending therebetween. The chamber 53 of the syringe dispenser 50 acts as a fluid source for the syringe dispenser 50. A plunger 54 is slidably positioned within the chamber 53 via an opening at the second end 52 of the syringe dispenser 50. The plunger 54 is utilized to force any fluids stored within the chamber 53 out of the syringe outlet 55 at the first end 51 of the syringe dispenser 50 as shown in the figures. The syringe dispenser 50 will generally fit within the second portion 34 of the inner channel 30 as shown in FIG. 4. To extend the reach of the syringe dispenser 50 out of the front end 23 of the housing 20, a coupler 56 may be provided that secures to the syringe outlet 55 as shown in FIG. 3. The coupler 56 connects the syringe outlet 55 with a tube outlet 57 which extends through the first portion 33 of the inner channel 30 and out the front end 23 of the housing 20. The tube outlet 57 will generally comprise an elongated tube which is fluidly interconnected with the syringe outlet 55. Any type of couplers 56 may be utilized. In some embodiments, a coupler 56 may be omitted, with the tube outlet 57 being integral with the syringe dispenser 50. The tube dispenser 60, best shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, comprises an elongated tube having a first end 61 and a second end 62. The second end 62 of the tube dispenser 60 is fluidly connected with a fluid source such as a pouch 64 as shown in the figures. The tube dispenser 60 may be directly connected to the pouch outlet 65 of the pouch 64 (or even integrally formed therewith) or, as shown in the exemplary figures, may be connected to the pouch outlet 65 via a pouch coupler 63. In such embodiments, any type of pouch coupler 63 may be utilized to fluidly connect the pouch 64 to the tube dispenser 60. In some embodiments, the tube dispenser 60 may extend through the entire inner channel 30 and out of the front end 23 of the housing 20. In the exemplary embodiments shown in the figures, a separate tube outlet 67 comprised of a narrow, elongated tube may be secured to the first end 61 of the tube dispenser 60, such as via a coupler 66. In other embodiments, the tube dispenser 60 may be an integral tube having varying diameters, with a wider diameter for the portion inserted within the second portion 34 of the inner channel 30 and a narrower diameter for the portion inserted within the first portion 33. In any embodiment, the tube outlet 67 extends out of the front end 23 of the housing 20 to be positioned near the nipple 13 for use. In embodiments using a tube dispenser 60, a separate adapter 70 may be utilized to securely fit the tube dispenser 60 within the inner channel 30 of the housing 20. FIG. 5 best illustrates such an adapter 70. The adapter 70 includes a receiver opening 72 in which the tube dispenser 60 may be positioned, as well as a first flange 73 and a second flange 74 which rest on the upper surface 21 of the housing 20 as shown in FIG. 6. The adapter 70 is thus positioned within the inner channel 30 to reduce its effective width for a more snug fit when installing the tube dispenser 60. D. Operation of Preferred Embodiment In use, either the chamber 53 of the syringe dispenser 50 or the pouch 64 of the tube dispenser 60 are filled with a fluid such as breastmilk, milk, or formula. The syringe dispenser 50 or tube dispenser 60 is positioned within the inner channel 30 of the housing 20. An adapter 70 may be utilized to snugly fit the tube dispenser 60 in the inner channel 30 if needed. The flange of the syringe dispenser 50 may be secured within the syringe slots 36, 37 in such embodiments. The housing 20 may be secured to the breast 12 using the securing member 40. FIGS. 13 and 14 illustrate proper positioning of the housing 20, with the tube outlet 57, 67 extending alongside and terminating at a flush position with the nipple 13 of the breast 12. The infant may then be positioned so as to latch onto both the nipple and the outlet 57, 67 of the housing 20. Thus, an infant may be fed from the housing 20 while still latching onto the breast, simulating breastfeeding for both the mother and infant. To dispense the fluid, the plunger 54 of the syringe dispenser 50 may be activated. For tube dispenser 60 embodiments, the pouch 64 may be constricted to force flow of fluid through the tube dispenser 60. Alternatively, suction or gravity may be utilized to allow fluid flow.
