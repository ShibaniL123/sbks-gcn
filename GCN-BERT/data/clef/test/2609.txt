FIELD OF THE INVENTION Provided herein are pharmaceutical compositions and formulations comprising salts of gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB). In a preferred embodiment, the salts encompass more than one type of cation. Also provided herein are methods of making the pharmaceutical compositions and formulations, and methods of their use for the treatment of disorders including fibromyalgia and sleep disorders. Such sleep disorders include apnea, sleep time disturbances, narcolepsy, cataplexy, sleep paralysis, hypnagogic hallucination, sleep arousal, insomnia, and nocturnal myoclonus. 3. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB), also known as “oxybate,” is an endrogenous compound with hypnotic properties that is found in many human body tissues. GHB is present, for example, in the mammalian brain and other tissues. In the brain, the highest GHB concentration is found in the hypothalamus and basal ganglia and GHB is postulated to function as a neurotransmitter (See Snead and Morley, 1981, Brain Res. 227(4): 579-89). The neuropharmacologic effects of GHB include increases in brain acetylcholine, increases in brain dopamine, inhibition of GABA-ketoglutarate transaminase and depression of glucose utilization but not oxygen consumption in the brain. GHB treatment substantially reduces the signs and symptoms of narcolepsy, i.e., daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, sleep paralysis, and hypnagogic hallucinations. In addition, GHB increases total sleep time and REM sleep, and it decreases REM latency, reduces sleep apnea, and improves general anesthesia (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,472,431; 6,780,889; 7,262,219; 7,851,506; 8,263,650; and 8,324,275; each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). Sodium oxybate (Na.GHB), commerically sold as Xyrem®, is approved for the treatment of excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy in patients with narcolepsy. Na.GHB has also been reported to be effective for relieving pain and improving function in patients with fibromyalgia syndrome (See Scharf et al., 2003, J. Rheumatol. 30: 1070; Russell et al., 2009, Arthritis. Rheum. 60: 299), and in alleviating excessive daytime sleepiness and fatigue in patients with Parkinson's disease, improving myoclonus and essential tremor, and reducing tardive dyskinesia and bipolar disorder (See Ondo et al., 2008, Arch. Neural. 65: 1337; Frucht et al., 2005, Neurology 65: 1967; Berner, 2008, J. Clin. Psychiatry 69: 862). Xyrem®, for use with patients with narcolepsy, is a chronically used product which requires high levels of the drug. The amount of sodium intake from the drug significantly increases the dietary sodium intake for patients, which is undesirable for patients with hypertension, heart disease, renal disease or at risk of stroke. Further, despite a general record of safety when used as prescribed, there are risks of abuse and misuse of Xyrem® which can cause serious medical problems, including seizures, loss of consciousness, coma, and death (see, e.g., FDA product label dated Nov. 13, 2006 for NDA no. 021196). Little research has been done on salts of GHB, other than Na.GHB, and we are not aware of any combining multiple salts (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,393,236; 4,983,632; 6,472,431; Ferris and Went, 2012, Forensic Science International 216: 158-162). Thus, there is a need for GHB formulations that minimize the undesirable side effects of the sodium, particularly in patients with hypertension, heart disease, renal disease or at risk of stroke, yet provide additional health benefits from the presence of the other salts. It is desirable that such modified formulations provide good solubility, stability and purity in order to provide safe, effective and consistent doses to patients, and also display acceptable pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties. 4.

Accordingly, in certain embodiments, the composition has a pH of about 3.5 to about 4.0, about 4.0 to about 4.5, about 4.5 to about 5.0, about 5.5 to about 6.0, about 6.0 to about 6.5, about 6.5 to about 7.0, about 7.0 to about 7.5, about 7.5 to about 8.0, about 8.0 to about 8.5, or about 8.5 to about 9.0. In certain embodiments, the composition has a pH of about 3.5, about 4.0, about 4.5, about 5.0, about 5.5, about 6.0, about 6.5, about 7.0, about 7.5, about 8.0, about 8.5, or about 9.0. In certain embodiments, the composition has a pH of about 7.0 to about 9.0, about 7.0 to about 8.5, about 7.3 to about 8.5, or about 7.5 to about 9.0. In certain embodiments, the composition has a pH of about 7.3 to about 8.5. In certain embodiments, the composition is chemically stable and resistant to microbial growth. In certain embodiments, the composition is free of preservatives. It will also be understood that the pH of the aqueous solution affects the resistance of the composition to microbial growth at about 500 mg/ml GHB. For example, Na.GHB at this concentration in an aqueous medium that is between about pH 5 and pH 9 is resistant to microbial growth, with compositions at about pH 6 to about pH 7.5 being particularly resistant to microbial growth. However, at concentrations of GHB greater than about 750 mg/ml above about pH 7.5, the resistance to microbial growth is reduced. It will be further understood that the concentration of GHB in the composition, when evaluated in relationship to the pH, affects the resistance of the GHB composition to microbial challenge. For example, compositions of Na.GHB at or below 150 mg/ml are poorly resistant to microbial challenge from a pH range of about pH 3 to about pH 9. However, concentrations of Na.GHB of greater than about 150 mg/ml, up to about 1000 mg/ml of GHB, are believed to be suitably resistant to microbial contamination at these pH ranges. It will be further understood that the chemical stability of GHB is affected by pH. Accordingly, the method for preparing GHB, as described herein, particularly as disclosed in the specific examples, varies with pH. GBL begins to form if the pH is about 6 or less. Compositions with a pH of greater than about 6.0 are preferred to produce chemically stable formulations of GHB. Thus, a preferred range to produce chemically stable GHB would be from about pH 6 to about pH 9. However, any pH or range of pH values where a clinically acceptable amount of GBL is produced is also contemplated as being preferred, and is encompassed by the present invention. The range of GBL could be regulatory broadened with availability of sufficient toxicological data. In certain embodiments, a pH adjusting or buffering agent may be added to the composition. The choice of a pH adjusting or buffering agent may affect the resistance to microbial challenge and/or the stability of GHB, as measured by the reduction in assayable GHB. Compositions of GHB, pH adjusted or buffered with malic acid are resistant to both microbial growth and chemical degradation of GHB, and are preferred. Other pH adjusting or buffering agents may be selected. Agents that adjust pH that are selected on this basis will undergo a taste testing study. However, any pH adjusting or buffering agent disclosed herein or as would be known to those skilled in the art is contemplated as being useful from the compositions or formulations disclosed herein. Of course, any salt, flavoring agent, excipient, or other pharmaceutically acceptable addition described herein or as would be known to those skilled in the art is contemplated as being useful for the compositions or formulations disclosed herein. In certain embodiments, the pH adjusting or buffering agent is an acid. In certain embodiments, the pH adjusting or buffering agent is an inorganic acid or an organic acid. In certain embodiments, the pH adjusting or buffering agent is selected from the group consisting of malic acid, citric acid, acetic acid, boric acid, lactic acid, hydrochloric acid, phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid, sulfonic acid, and nitric acid. In certain embodiments, the pH adjusting or buffering agent is malic acid. The aqueous solutions disclosed herein typically comprise an effective amount of GHB, which may be dissolved or dispersed in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and/or an aqueous medium. As used herein, “pharmaceutically acceptable carrier” includes any and all solvents, dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic and absorption delaying agents and the like. The use of such media and agents for pharmaceutical active substances is well known in the art. Insofar as any conventional media or agent is incompatible with the active ingredient, its use in the therapeutic compositions is not appropriate. Supplementary compatible active ingredients can be incorporated into the compositions. For human administration, preparations should meet sterility, pyrogenicity, general safety and purity standards as required by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). 6.2.4 Formulations In certain embodiments, the compositions disclosed herein are provided in a formulation, preferably, a liquid formulation, although solid formulations are also contemplated. In certain embodiments, the formulation is chemically stable and resistant to microbial growth. In certain embodiments, the formulation is free of preservatives. In certain embodiments, the level of gamma-butyrolacetone (GBL) is 0.1% or less of the formulation. In certain embodiments, the formulation is suitable for oral administration. In certain embodiments, the formulation additionally comprises a flavoring agent. Preferred sweeteners or flavoring agents would be microbially non-metabolizable. Especially preferred sweeteners or flavoring agents would be carbohydrates such as xylitol and sorbitol. Such flavoring agents include, but are not limited to, acacia syrup, anethole, anise oil, aromatic elixir, benzaldehyde, benzaldehyde elixir-compound, caraway, caraway oil, cardamom oil, cardamom seed, cardamom spirit, cardamom tincture-compound, cherry juice, cherry syrup, cinnamon, cinnamon oil, cinnamon water, citric acid, citric acid syrup, clove oil, coca, coca syrup, coriander oil, dextrose, eriodictyon, eriodictyon fluidextract, eriodictyon syrup-aromatic, ethyl acetate, ethyl, vanillin, fennel oil, ginger, ginger fluidextract, ginger oleoresin, glucose, glycerin, glycyrrhiza, glycyrrhiza elixir, glycyrrhiza extract, glycyrrhiza extract-pure, glycyrrhiza fluidextract, glycyrrhiza syrup, honey, non-alcoholic elixir, lavender oil, citrus extract or oil, lemon oil, lemon tincture, mannitol, methyl salicylate, nutmeg oil, orange-bitter-elixir, orange-bitter-oil, orange flower oil, orange flower water, orange oil, orange peel-bitter, orange-peel-sweet-tincture, orange spirit-compound, compound, orange syrup, peppermint, peppermint oil, peppermint spirit, peppermint water, phenylethyl alcohol, raspberry juice, raspberry syrup, rosemary oil, rose oil, rose water, saccharin, saccharin calcium, saccharin sodium, sarsaparilla syrup, sorbitol solution, spearmint, spearmint oil, sucralose, sucrose, syrup, thyme oil, tolu balsam, tolu balsam syrup, vanilla, vanilla tincture, vanillin or wild cherry syrup. In certain embodiments, the formulation additionally comprises a coloring agent. Preferred coloring agents would be microbially non-metabolizable. In certain embodiments, the formulation is administered in a single or multiple dosage regimen. Any of the above formulations may be prepared and/or packaged as a powdered or dry form for mixing with an aqueous medium before oral administration, or they may be prepared in an aqueous medium and packaged. After mixing with an aqueous medium, preferably to prepare a solution, these formulations are resistant to both microbial growth and chemical conversion of GHB to GBL, thereby increasing the shelf-life of therapeutic formulations of GHB in an aqueous medium. These formulations then provide an easily titratable liquid medium for measuring the dosage of GHB to be administered to a patient. Additional embodiments of the composition and methods of preparation are described below and in the examples. The GHB may be lyophilized for more ready formulation into a desired vehicle or medium where appropriate. The active compounds may be formulated for parenteral administration, e.g., formulated for injection via intravenous, intraarterial, intramuscular, sub-cutaneous, intralesional, intraperitoneal or other parenteral routes. The preparation of a composition that comprises an aqueous solution that contains a GHB agent as an active component or ingredient will be known to those of skill in the art in light of the present disclosure. Typically, such compositions can be prepared as injectables, either as liquid solutions or suspensions. Solid forms suitable for using to prepare solutions or suspensions upon the addition of a liquid prior to injection can also be prepared; and the preparations can also be emulsified. The pharmaceutical forms suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions; formulations including, e.g., aqueous propylene glycol; and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersions. In all cases the form must be sterile and must be fluid to the extent that easy syringability exists. It must be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi. Solutions of the active compounds as free acid or pharmacologically acceptable salts can be prepared in water suitably mixed with hydroxypropylcellulose and/or a pharmaceutically acceptable surfactant. Dispersions can also be prepared in glycerol, liquid polyethylene glycols, and mixtures thereof as well as in oils. Under ordinary conditions of storage and use, these preparation may best contain a preservative to further prevent the growth of microorganisms. The carrier can also be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, and liquid polyethylene glycol, or the like), suitable mixtures thereof, and vegetable oils. The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a substance, such as lecithin (e.g. a coating), by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants. The prevention of the action of microorganisms can be brought about by any of the preservatives described herein, or as would be known to those skilled in the art, including various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, thimerosal, and the like. In many cases, it will be preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars or sodium chloride. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by the use in the compositions of agents delaying absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate. Sterile injectable solutions are prepared by incorporating the active compounds in the required amount in the appropriate solvent with, various of the other ingredients enumerated above, as required, followed by filtered sterilization. Generally, dispersions are prepared by incorporating the various sterilized active ingredients into a sterile vehicle which contains the basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated above. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, the preferred methods of preparation are vacuum-drying and freeze-drying techniques which yield a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile-filtered solution thereof. The preparation of more, or highly, concentrated solutions for direct injection is also contemplated, where the use of DMSO as solvent (although DMSO may not now be a permitted human drug) is envisioned to result in extremely rapid penetration, delivering high concentrations of the active agents to a small area. Upon formulation, solutions will be administered in a manner compatible with the dosage formulation and in such amount as is therapeutically effective. The formulations are easily administered in a variety of dosage forms, such as the type of injectable solutions described above, but drug release capsules and the like can also be employed. For parenteral administration in an aqueous solution, for example, the solution should be suitably buffered if necessary and the liquid diluent first rendered isotonic with sufficient saline or glucose. These particular aqueous solutions are especially suitable for intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous and intraperitoneal administration. In this connection, sterile aqueous media which can be employed will be known to those of skill in the art in light of the present disclosure. For example, one dosage could be dissolved in 1 ml of isotonic NaCl solution and either added to 1000 ml of fluid or injected at the proposed site of infusion, (see for example, “Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences” 15th Edition, pages 1035-1038 and 1570-1580). Some variation in dosage will necessarily occur depending on the condition of the subject being treated. The person responsible for administration will, in any event, determine the appropriate dose for the individual subject. The active GHB may be formulated within a therapeutic mixture to comprise about 100 to about 10,000 milligrams per dose. Multiple doses can also be administered. In addition to the compounds formulated for parenteral administration, such as intravenous or intramuscular injection, other pharmaceutically acceptable forms include, e.g., tablets or other solids; liposomal formulations; time release capsules; and any other form currently used, including creams, which then may be admixed with an aqueous medium for oral administration. One may also use nasal solutions or sprays, aerosols or inhalants in the present invention. Nasal solutions are usually aqueous solutions designed to be administered to the nasal passages in drops or sprays. Nasal solutions are prepared so that they are similar in many respects to nasal secretions, so that normal ciliary action is maintained. Thus, the aqueous nasal solutions usually are isotonic and slightly buffered to maintain a pH of 5.5 to 6.5, though other pH ranges disclosed herein the specific examples, such as pH 3 to about pH 9, or pH 6 to about 7.5, are contemplated. In addition, preservatives, similar to those used in ophthalmic preparations, and appropriate drug stabilizers, if required, may be included in the formulation. Various commercial nasal preparations are known and include, for example, antibiotics and antihistamines and are used for asthma prophylaxis. The preferred oral formulations may include such normally employed excipients, as, for example, pharmaceutical grades of xylitol, mannitol, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, sodium saccharin, cellulose, magnesium carbonate and the like. These compositions can take the form of solutions, suspensions, tablets, pills, capsules, sustained release formulations or powders to be admixed with an aqueous medium. In certain defined embodiments, oral pharmaceutical compositions will comprise an inert diluent or assimilable edible carrier, or they may be enclosed in hard or soft shell gelatin capsule, or they may be compressed into tablets, or the GHB may be packaged separately from or in combination with the excipients, salts, flavorings or any other components described herein, to be admixed with an aqueous medium for oral or injectable formulations, or they may be incorporated directly with the food (i.e. a beverage) of the diet. For oral therapeutic administration, the active compounds may be incorporated with excipients and used in the form of tablets, buccal tablets or tabs, troches, capsules, elixirs, suspensions, syrups, wafers, and the like, to be admixed with an aqueous medium. Such compositions and preparations should contain at least 0.1% of active compound. The percentage of the compositions and preparations may, of course, be varied and may conveniently be between about 2 to about 75% of the weight of the unit, or preferably between 25-60%. The amount of active compounds in such therapeutically useful compositions is such that a suitable dosage will be obtained. The tablets, troches, pills, capsules and the like may also contain the following: a binder, natural as gum tragacanth, acacia, cornstarch, or gelatin or synthetic as polyvinyl acetate; excipients, such as dicalcium phosphate; a disintegrating agent, such as corn starch, potato starch, alginic acid and the like; a lubricant, such as magnesium stearate; and a sweetening agent, such as sucrose, lactose or saccharin may be added or a natural or synthetic flavoring agent. When the dosage unit form is a capsule for admixing with a specific volume of an aqueous medium, it may contain, in addition to materials of the above type, a liquid carrier. Various other materials may be present as coatings or to otherwise modify the physical form of the dosage unit. For instance, tablets, pills, or capsules may be coated with sugar, natural or synthetic polymers, or both. A syrup or elixir may contain the active compounds, sucrose as a sweetening agent, a preservative, a dye and/or a flavoring. Additionally, any excipient, salt, acid, pH-mediating, adjusting or buffering compound or agent, flavoring, solution, solvent, dispersion, glycerol, glycol, oil, antibacterial and antifungal agents, antibiotics and antihistamines, binders, disintegrating agents, lubricants, sweetening agents, or any other additive or ingredient from those enumerated above or in the examples, or in any pharmaceutically acceptable composition or carrier described herein, or as would be known by one of skill in the art, is contemplated for use in aqueous mediums or solid forms of the GHB compositions of the invention. One or more of these compositions may be packaged with GHB or packaged separately from GHB prior to consumption. If packaged separately, useful compositions of GHB may be obtained by mixing GHB with the other components with an aqueous medium prior to consumption. Such components may be packaged in a kit, described below. Therapeutic kits of the present invention are kits comprising GHB. Such kits will generally contain, in suitable container, a pharmaceutically acceptable formulation of GHB. The kit may have a single container, or it may have distinct container for each component, or distinct container for various combinations of components. When the components of the kit are provided in one or more liquid formulations, the liquid formulation is an aqueous medium, with a sterile aqueous solution being particularly preferred. The GHB compositions may also be formulated into a syringeable composition. In which case, the container means may itself be a syringe, pipette, vial, ampule or other such like apparatus, from which the formulation may be applied to an infected area of the body, injected into an animal, or even applied to and mixed with the other components of the kit. However, the components of the kit may be provided as dried powder(s). When reagents or components are provided as a dry powder, the powder can be reconstituted by the addition of a suitable solvent. It is envisioned that the solvent may also be provided in another container means. The container means will generally include at least one vial, test tube, flask, bottle, pouch syringe or other container means, into which the GHB formulation or components thereof are placed, preferably, suitably allocated. The kits may also comprise a second container means for containing a sterile, pharmaceutically acceptable buffer or other diluent. The kits of the present invention will also typically include a means for containing the vials in close confinement for commercial sale, such as, e.g., injection or blow-molded plastic containers into which the desired vials are retained. In certain embodiments, the kits of the present invention contain one or more bottles of liquid formulation comprising GHB, two dosing cups with child-resistant caps, a liquid measuring device and a medication guide. Irrespective of the number or type of containers, the kits of the invention may also comprise, or be packaged with, an instrument for assisting with the injection/administration or placement of the GHB composition within the body of an animal. Such an instrument may be a drinking cup, syringe, pipette, or any such medically approved delivery vehicle. 6.2.5 Methods of Treatment The compositions and formulations comprising mixed salts of GHB, disclosed herein, are also contemplated to be useful in the treatment of any of these disorders or conditions in patients. GHB has also been used alone as a narcotic in patients with a terminal carcinomatous state.

It will be understood, however, that the specific dose level and frequency of dosage for any particular patient may be varied and will depend upon a variety of factors including: the metabolic stability and length of action, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, mode and time of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, the severity of the particular condition, and the host undergoing therapy. 6.2.6 Methods of Making In certain aspects, provided herein are methods of making the compositions or formulations comprising mixed salts GHB disclosed herein. Several different methods of making have been reported in the literature (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,393,236; 4,983,632; 6,472,431; Ferris and Went, 2012, Forensic Science International 216: 158-162). Those skilled in the art will recognize that these methods can be incorporated in the making of the compositions or formulations comprising mixed salts GHB disclosed herein. In certain embodiments, mixtures of GHB salts can be made by direct reaction of GBL with an aqueous mixture of one of more of the following bases: sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, and magnesium hydroxide. After reaction the mixture may then be filtered under mild vacuum. In certain embodiments, a solvent, such as water, is used to dissolve the GHB salt mixture to a desired concentration, for example, by adjusting the amount of water in the mixture. In certain embodiments, the concentration of a GHB salt solution is adjusted by concentrating the mixture using standard methods, such as evaporators, reverse osmosis, and similar techniques known to those skilled in the art. In certain embodiments, the method of making comprises reacting gamma-butyrolacetone (GBL) with one or more bases selected from the group consisting of sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, and calcium hydroxide. In certain embodiments, the reaction is carried out in a single vessel. For example, a mixture of Na.GHB, K.GHB, Mg.(GHB)2, and Ca.(GHB)2 may be made by direct addition of GBL to in a single vessel containing an aqueous mixture of sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, and calcium hydroxide. In certain embodiments, the reaction is carried out in multiple vessels and the product is subsequently combined. For example, Ca.(GHB)2 may be made by direct addition of GBL to aqueous sodium hydroxide, and the product combined with Mg.(GHB)2. In certain embodiments, the methods of making include methods of making the pharmaceutical compositions and formulations disclosed herein. The following examples are included to demonstrate preferred embodiments of the invention. It should be appreciated by those of skill in the art that the techniques disclosed in the examples which follow represent techniques discovered by the inventor to function well in the practice of the invention, and thus can be considered to constitute preferred modes for its practice. However, those of skill in the art should, in light of the present disclosure, appreciate that many changes can be made in the specific embodiments which are disclosed and still obtain a like or similar result without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. 7. EXAMPLES 7.1 Example 1 Synthesis of Mixture A The following synthetic examples provide exemplary syntheses of mixture of oxybate salts. Alternate methods of synthesizing mixtures of oxybate salts, including methods of synthesizing additional salts of oxybate are described below; still other alternate synthetic methods will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Mixture A of Table 2 was arrived by direct reaction of GBL with an aqueous mixture of four bases. Sodium hydroxide (Sigma Aldrich Reagent, 98.50% assay), potassium hydroxide (Sigma Aldrich ACS Reagent, 86.72% assay), calcium hydroxide (Sigma Aldrich ACS Reagent, 99.0% assay), and magnesium hydroxide (Sigma Aldrich Reagent, 99.5% assay) were weighed as 1.398 grams, 7.337 grams, 6.268 grams, and 2.611 grams, respectively, into a 100 ml Pyrex volumetric flask. To this, 68.03 grams of water (ultrapure by reverse osmosis) was added with mixing and subsequently allowed to cool. GBL (99.9% purity) was added in 1 ml aliquots for a total of 34.38 grams. During addition, reaction occurred immediately and heat was evolved. With cooling, the temperature did not exceed 80° C. After GBL addition, the mixture was placed in a temperature-controlled water bath kit to 80° C. with mixing, and allowed to react to completion in about 3 hours. The mixture was then filtered under mild vacuum, cooled to room temperature, and characterized for final pH, assay (by titration), solids content (by loss on drying), and purity (by reverse-phase gradient HPLC). The pH was 8.04, assay was 100.8% of target, solids content was 42.25%, and impurities consisted of un-reacted GBL (0.169%) and hydroxybutyl butyric acid (HBBA, 0.083%). The filtered solution was clear. The details of this and the mixtures of Examples 2-5 (including, e.g., Mixtures B-G) are provided in Tables 1-6. Example calculations of molar equivalents and % wt/wt for salt mixtures are shown below for Mixture A in Table 1. For Mixture A, 34.38 g of 99.9% GBL were charged, which is (34.38×0.999/68.089×1000)=399.0 mMol. The total base equivalents charged were 404.40 mEq. Hence, the excess base was ((404.40-399.0)/(399.0×100%))=1.35%. TABLE 1 Example calculation % molar Salt Base Grams Base Stoich.

Separately, magnesium oxybate (Mixture C) was made in the same molar strength by reaction of GBL with an aqueous suspension of magnesium hydroxide. The latter reaction was considerably slower, and especially slow as the reaction neared completion and most of the magnesium hydroxide was depleted. Both batches were then filtered. The two mixtures were then combined in a ratio of 0.78:0.22 (v/v) to arrive at Mixture D which is the same composition as Mixture A. Product made in this “2-pot” method has properties comparable to that of the “1-pot” method, but in some circumstances may be preferred. 7.3 Example 3 Synthesis of Mixture E Mixture E was produced at approximately 8-fold larger batch size in a 1-liter vessel. The bases were weighed into the vessel, and water was quickly added with stirring. The temperature rose from 21° C. to 40° C. and was allowed to cool to 23° C. by immersion in a cold water bath. The vessel was then removed from cooling, and GBL was then added in 10 g aliquots while recording temperature. The temperature rose steadily with each aliquot of GBL added until between 75% and 79% addition, at which time the temperature began to fall slowly despite GBL addition, due to cooling. This phenomenon was consistent with the relatively fast reactions of sodium, potassium, and calcium hydroxides, and the much slower reaction of magnesium hydroxide, as the latter was about 23% by stoichiometry. After GBL addition, the vessel was then placed in a water bath controlled to 80° C. After 6.5 hours, the product was filtered and characterized for pH, assay, solids content, and purity. 7.4 Example 4 Synthesis of Mixture F Although it is generally more convenient to add the GBL to a stirred mixture of bases in water, the reverse addition order produced a comparable product. In producing Mixture F, GBL was first loaded into a 100 ml reaction vessel. Separately, an aqueous mixture of the four bases was prepared with stirring, and this mixture was then added to the GBL in 1 ml aliquots. The reaction mixture was then placed in a 80° C. water bath for 3.5 hours, recovered after filtration, and characterized for pH, assay, % solids, and purity. The results are generally comparable to those of Mixture A, which was produced using the opposite order of addition. 7.5 Example 5 Synthesis of Mixture G Mixture G was arrived by direct addition of gamma butyrolactone (GBL) to an aqueous mixture of the four bases. After GBL addition, the mixture was placed in a temperature-controlled water bath kit to 80° C. with mixing, and allowed to react to completion in about 3.5 hours. The mixture was then filtered under mild vacuum, cooled to room temperature, and characterized for final pH, assay (by titration), solids content (by loss on drying), and purity (by reverse-phase gradient HPLC). The pH was 8.27, assay was 97.6% of target, solids content was 41.06%, and impurities consisted of unreacted GBL (0.143%) and hydroxybutyl butyric acid (HBBA, 0.061%). The filtered solution was clear. 7.6 Example 6 Synthesis of Mixtures H and I The oxybate salt mixture composition can be adjusted to produce a mixture having the same overall mass potency as sodium oxybate. In other words, the weighted-average molecular weight per molar equivalent of oxybate is the same (126.09). Thus, the absolute dosing of the oxybate salt mixture, in grams of drug substance, is the same as sodium oxybate. This is particularly useful for avoiding potential confusion and reducing medication errors as a result of switching patients from a sodium oxybate product to a mixed salt product. In other words, 6.0 grams dosing of sodium oxybate is also 6.0 grams dosing of the salt mixture. This feature cannot be achieved in alternative single-salts of oxybate. Two such formulations were produced by the similar procedure as outlined in Example 1. Sodium hydroxide (Sigma Aldrich Reagent, 98.20% assay), potassium hydroxide (Sigma Aldrich ACS Reagent, 86.72% assay), calcium hydroxide (Sigma Aldrich ACS Reagent, 99.0% assay), and magnesium hydroxide (Sigma Aldrich Reagent, 99.5% assay) were weighed as indicated in Table 7, respectively, into a 100 ml Pyrex bottle. To this, water (ultrapure by reverse osmosis) was added with mixing, and finally GBL (99.9% purity) was added in about 2 ml aliquots. During addition, reaction occurred immediately and heat was evolved. After GBL addition, the mixture was placed in a temperature-controlled water bath kit to 80° C. with mixing, and allowed to react to completion. After four hours, the conversion from reaction was about 99.5% and 98.5% (as measured by residual GBL). To speed completion, a small amount of magnesium hydroxide was added. After 5.25 hours, the mixtures were then filtered under mild vacuum and cooled to room temperature. The filtered solutions were clear. The solutions were characterized for final pH, assay by titration, solids content by evaporation at 150° C. (4 h) followed by equilibration at 60° C., and purity by reverse-phase gradient HPLC. The molecular weight per oxybate equivalent of each mixture was calculated from the assay and solids content results, and were in reasonable agreement with sodium oxybate (127.0 and 126.4 g/mol-equiv vs. 126.09 for sodium oxybate).
