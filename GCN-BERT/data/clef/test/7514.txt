VINYL FUNCTIONALIZED URETHANE RESINS FOR POWDER COATING COMPOSITIONS The invention relates to a vinyl functionalized urethane resin (VFUR) useful as a curing agent in thermosetting powder coating compositions, a process for making said vinyl functionalized urethane resin, a vinyl functionalized urethane resin composition (VFURC) useful as a curing agent in thermosetting powder coating compositions, a process for making vinyl functionalized urethane resin composition, a thermosetting powder coating composition (TPCC), a process for the preparation thereof, a cured thermosetting powder coating composition, processes for coating an article with said thermosetting powder coating composition and an article coated with said thermosetting powder coating composition as well as uses of the vinyl functionalized urethane resin or of the vinyl functionalized urethane resin composition or of the thermosetting powder coating composition or of the articles having coated and cured thereon said thermosetting powder coating composition. The invention relates also to thermosetting powder coating composition useful for powder-in-mould coating articles such as reinforced polymeric e.g. polyester resin articles and to powder-in-mould coating methods employing the thermosetting powder coating composition and use of the in-mould coated article. Powder coating compositions (commonly referred to as “powders”) which are dry, finely divided, free flowing, solid materials at room temperature and at atmospheric pressure, have gained considerable popularity in recent years over liquid coating compositions for a number of reasons. For one powder coatings are user and environmentally friendly materials since they are virtually free of harmful volatile organic solvents carriers that are normally present in liquid coating compositions. Therefore, powder coatings give off little, if any, volatile materials to the environment when cured. This eliminates the solvent emission problems associated with liquid coating compositions such as air pollution and dangers to the health of workers employed in coating operations. Powder coating compositions are also clean and convenient to use since they are applied in a clean manner over the substrate because they are in dry solid form. The powders are easily swept up in the event of a spill and do not require special cleaning and spill containment supplies, as do liquid coating compositions. Working hygiene is thus improved. Moreover, powder coating compositions are essentially 100 % recyclable since the sprayed powders can be fully reclaimed and recombined with fresh powder feed. Recycling of liquid coatings during application is often not done, which leads to increased waste and hazardous waste disposal costs. In addition, powder coating compositions are ready to use, i.e., no thinning or dilution is required. Powder coating compositions are typically applied on a substrate via an electrostatic spray process; the powder coating composition is dispersed in an air stream and passed through a corona discharge field where the particles acquire an electrostatic charge. The charged particles are attracted to and deposited on the grounded article to be coated. The article, usually at room temperature, is then placed in an oven where the powder melts and forms a powder coating. A hybrid process based on a combination of high voltage electrostatic charging and fluidized-bed application techniques (electrostatic fluidized bed) has evolved, as well as triboelectric spray application methods. Powder coating compositions and their process of application are the preferred coating compositions and process for coating many familiar items such as lawn and garden equipment, patio and other metal furniture, electrical cabinets, lighting, shelving and store fixtures, and many automotive components. Today, powder coating compositions are widely accepted, with thousands of installations in the factories of original equipment manufacturers (OEMS) and custom coating job shops. Powder coating compositions can be thermosetting or thermoplastic. The invention relates to the field of thermosetting powder coating compositions (TPCC). The preparation of thermosetting powder coating compositions is described by Misev in "Powder Coatings, Chemistry and Technology” (ρρ. 224-300; 1991, John Wiley& Sons Ltd.). As shown by the article Overview of the powder coatings market worldwide” by G. Maggiore in Pitture ℮ Vernice Europe 1/92, ρρ. 15-22 and by the lecture by D. Richart "Powder Coating: Current Developments, Future Trends” (Waterborne, High-Solids and Powder Coatings Symposium, February 22-24, 1995), the search is still continuing for thermosetting powder coating compositions which can be cured with little thermal stress of the substrate and which consequently are suitable for use on heat-sensitive substrates such as, for example, wood and plastic. Vinyl ether terminated urethane resins are extremely reactive and are known to undergo rapid polymerization when exposed to radiation. According to US 6291541 Β1 (column 1, lines 18-55) and to US 6028212 (column 1, lines 14-54), these compounds are particularly useful as curing agents in applications which require high speed curing of a coating formulation such as radiation curable coating compositions. Οη℮ disadvantage attendant to the use of such vinyl ether functionalized urethanes is that their commercial availability is relatively limited. In general the available vinyl ether terminated urethane resins constitute liquid or semi-solid (with extremely low Tg) materials. US 4751273 provides specific examples of such liquid and semi-solid vinyl ether terminated urethane resins. Vinyl ether terminated urethane resins are typically used as curing agents, though extremely useful in liquid radiation curable coatings, have only limited use in thermosetting powder coating compositions and powder coatings. Typically because of their liquid or semi-solid state they cannot be used beyond a few percent (< 5%) in powder coatings. Greater amounts typically cause the powder to block or sinter in storage which renders the powder unsprayable during electrostatic coating applications. Solid vinyl ether terminated urethane resins which are more conductive for use in radiation curable powder coatings have been proposed. ΕΡ 0636669 A provides one example of a crystalline vinyl ether functionalized urethane resin that remains a solid at room temperature (melt range of 90-108 °C). This resin is prepared from the reaction of 4-hydroxybutyl vinyl ether (HBVE) with hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI) monomer in a 1:1 (stoichiometric) molar ratio of hydroxyl to isocyanate groups. The reaction product is a short chain crystalline urethane resin (HBVE-HDI-HBVE). US 6291541 Β1 (column 1, lines 50-55) and US 6028212 (column 1, lines 48-54), further point out one serious disadvantage with the use of such a crystalline vinyl ether terminated urethane resin in powder coatings; the use of said crystalline vinyl ether terminated urethane resin in powder coatings makes manufacture of the powders extremely troublesome. Powders based on crystalline materials take longer to recrystallize after melt extrusion, making subsequent grinding and handling very messy and difficult. In order to overcome the aforementioned problem and provide thermosetting powder coating compositions comprising such reactive type of curing agents as the vinyl ether functionalized urethane resins, each of US 6291541 Β1 and US 6028212 propose the use of an amorphous (non-crystalline) vinyl ether functionalized urethane resin of a specific chemical formula as depicted in claim 1 of each of US 6291541 Β1 and US 6028212. It would be thus desirable to obtain a thermosetting powder coating composition comprising a crystalline and highly reactive vinyl functionalized urethane resin, said powder coating composition having enhanced processability during and after the melt extrusion having for example less stickiness to the cooling rollers of an extruder and/or taking shorter time to recrystallize thus enabling easy manufacturing whilst preferably at the same time said powder coating composition can still be ground, flaked and sieved. Enhanced processability during and after the melt extrusion and/or taking shorter time to recrystallize thus enabling easy manufacturing whilst preferably at the same time said powder coating composition can still be ground, flaked and sieved are useful for commercially viable powders since said compositions can prepared in existing powder paint production lines without major investments in new equipment or fundamentally different processes. Furthermore, it would be desirable said powder coating composition to have good storage stability and upon curing provide powder coatings having acceptable smoothness, good flexibility so that said powder coatings may sustain substrate stresses without been delaminated and/or cracked, would also be desirable. Good flexibility is especially useful when the article to be powder coated has a complex three-dimensional shape and/or when a coating is used on furniture, such as wooden/metal chairs and kitchen cabinets. Additional coating film properties such as resistance to acetone and/or to coffee would also be desirable since liquids such as acetone, coffee are typical stains to coated articles. Furthermore it would be desirable that the scratch resistance of powder coatings is not significantly compromised, preferably is not compromised, even more preferably is enhanced. Moreover, it would be also desirable said powder coating composition to be curable at relatively low temperatures for example 80-150 °C, preferably 80-130 °C, thus been suitable for coating heat-sensitive articles.

For clarity, the term heat curing does not include ultraviolet (UV) or electron beam induced curing. Optionally, a combination of heat and pressure can be used to cure the heat-curable thermosetting powder coating compositions of the invention.

The PSD can be determined for example by the following method: a certain amount of thermosetting powder coating composition, for example 100 g, is brought onto a Fritsch Analysette Spartan sieving apparatus equipped with a 200 micron sieve. The sample is sieved for 15 minutes at a 2.5 mm amplitude. The fraction of the sample which remained on the sieve was weighed after sieving. The fraction of the sample that went through the sieve (sieved fraction) is collected and is placed on a 160 micron sieve and is sieved as mentioned herein above. Once the same measurements (weighing) are performed as mentioned herein above, the same procedure is repeated using sequentially a 140, a 125, a 112, a 100, a 90, a 75, a 50 and a 20 micron sieve; the last sieved fraction with a size smaller than 20 micron is also weighed.

The thermosetting powder coating composition of the invention may be a one component (1Κ) system, but may also be a two component (2Κ) system. Preferably, the composition of the invention is one component (1Κ) system. With a ‘one component system’, also called a 1Κ system, is meant that all (reactive) components of the thermosetting powder coating composition form part of one powder. In a two component system, also called 2Κ system, a thermosetting powder coating composition is composed of at least two different powders with different chemical compositions, which keeps the reactive components physically separated. The at least two different powders may be mixed in a physical blend before the composition of the invention is put in a storage container or may be mixed just before applying the 2Κ system to a substrate to let a curing reaction take place. The compositions of the at least two different powders in the 2Κ system are usually selected such that each powder contains an ingredient which is needed for curing but is absent from the other powder(s). This separation allows preparation of the individual powder composition in a heated state (such as by melt mixing) without the initiation of the cure reaction.

Processes for coating an article with the thermosetting powder coating composition of the invention In another aspect, the invention relates to a process for coating a substrate comprising the steps of: a. applying a thermosetting powder coating composition according to the invention, to a substrate; b. heating the substrate. The composition of the invention may be applied using the techniques known to the person skilled in the art, for example using electrostatic spray or electrostatic fluidized bed or flame spray. Heating of the coated substrate may be done using conventional methods, such as with a convection oven and/or with an (N)IR lamp. Even microwave equipment may be used to heat the substrate. The temperature, at which the thermosetting powder coating compositions of the invention are cured, is preferably in the range of 80 to 225 °C, more preferably in the range 80 to 150 °C, even more preferably from 80 to 140 °C, most preferably from 80 to 130 °C, especially from 90 to 130 °C, more especially from 100 to 130 °C. Preferably, the temperature at which the thermosetting powder coating compositions of the invention are cured, is preferably at most 160, more preferably at most 150, even more preferably at most 140, most preferably at most 130, most preferably at most 120, especially at most 110, more especially at most 100 °C. Preferably, the temperature at which the thermosetting powder coating compositions of the invention are cured, is preferably at least 60, more preferably at least 70, even more preferably at least 75, most preferably at least 80, most preferably at least 85, especially at least 90, more especially at least 100 °C. The curing time of the thermosetting powder coating compositions of the invention is at most 60 min, more preferably is at most 45 min, even more preferably is at most 30 min, most preferably is at most 20 min, especially is at most 10 min, more especially is at most 5 min. Preferably the thermosetting powder coating compositions of the invention are heat-cured at a temperature in the range of 80-150 °C for a time in the range of 5-30 min. The thermosetting powder coating composition of the invention is in particular very suitable for use in a powder-in-mould-coating process in order to obtain a powder coated moulded object. The powder in-mould coating is a known technique for decorating or priming the surface of a moulded article formed in a matched die mould under heat and pressure. The thermosetting powder coating composition upon its application to the hot wall of the mould, it is desirable to flow out well and harden quickly upon heat and/or radiation curing as well as to afford at the same time a powder coating with good appearance. The thermosetting powder coating composition of the invention is especially suitable where a low curing temperature to cure said composition is desired. The reason is that if the temperature needed to cure a thermosetting powder coating composition is too high (for example at a temperature of around 160 °C or higher), the mould may, due to the limited heat resistance of the composite material it is made of, have a rather limited and non-cost effective lifetime. Therefore, by using the thermosetting powder coating composition of the invention, the curing temperature can be lowered (for example to a temperature between 80° C and 150°C) and the life-time of the mould can be substantially extended, thereby providing a substantial economical and environmental advantage. In a powder-in-mould coating process, first a thermosetting powder coating composition is applied, for example through electrostatic spraying to the interior wall of a usually (not necessary though) pre-heated mould (generally temperatures are between 75°C.and 200 °C, typically temperatures are between 100 °C. and 160 °C). The thermosetting powder coating composition melts due to the heat of the mould and coalesces on the mould surface to produce a uniform and continuous layer. The fill compound which constitutes the bulk of the finished article is then inserted in the mould and it is moulded. A fill compound may be put in the mould according to techniques known to the skilled person, for example process techniques like SMC (sheet molding compound), BMC (bulk molding compound), light RTM (Resin Transfer Molding, Vacuum Infusion (VI) or standard HLU (Hand lay-up) or SU (Spray-up). The fill compound can for example be a (glas-) fibre reinforced thermoplast or duroplast resin (for example a sheet molding compound resin from DSM Composite Resins). Subsequently, heating and/or radiation is applied to effect the curing of the thermosetting powder coating composition and may also be used to effect the curing of the fill compound. Heating may be applied in several ways, for example hot air may be circulated over the powder coating composition and/or the fill compound; and/or infrared light may be irradiated on the powder coating composition and/or the fill compound; and/or the mould may be heated. When the curing of the thermosetting powder coating composition and that of the fill resin have advanced sufficiently, and the then formed powder coating and fill resins are integral, the mould is opened and the molding is removed and the moulded article coated with a powder coating is obtained. Preferably, the coating and fill resins are crosslinked across the interface between them to maximize adhesion. Therefore, in another aspect, the invention also relates to a process for making a coated article comprising the steps of: applying a thermosetting powder coating composition of the invention to the interior wall of a mould; subsequently introducing a fill compound in the mould in order said fill compound to form an article said article is selected from the group consisting of articles comprising heat-sensitive components and articles comprising non-heat sensitive components and articles comprising a combination of heat-sensitive and non-heat sensitive components; heating and/or irradiating the thermosetting powder coating composition and optionally also the fill compound to obtain the coated article. The invention also relates to a process for the preparation of a partially or fully coated article, comprising the steps of: - applying a composition according to the invention to the interior surface of a mould covering part or the whole of said surface of the mould; and subsequently putting a fill compound in the mould; and heating the composition; and optionally heating the fill compound; - optionally applying pressure to the mould; and maintaining heat and optionally pressure for a period of time sufficient to obtain an intact and partially or fully coated article. In the context of the invention the above two processes will be referred herein as the “PIMC process” (PIMC stands for: Powder-in-Mould Coating). The step of heating and/or irradiating the thermosetting powder coating composition of the invention may be done at several “times” in the process, for example the thermosetting powder coating composition of the invention may be heated and/or irradiated upon application to the mould and/or the thermosetting powder coating composition of the invention may be heated and/or irradiated upon application of said composition to the mould. Similarly, the optional heating of the fill compound may be done upon entry of the fill compound in the mould and/or after entry of the fill compound in the mould. If heating of the mould is the method of choice, heating of the mould may be performed before, during and/or after the application of the thermosetting powder coating composition of the invention to the interior wall of the mould. A powder-in-mould coating is to be distinguished from a post-molding coating process, wherein the article is formed in the mould before a coating composition is introduced into the mould. It is also to be distinguished from conventional powder coating operations in which the article is formed in the mould and only after release from the mould coated with a powder coating. In general, it is difficult to coat an already moulded article as the surface of such moulded article may contain open pores, which may cause blistering during heat curing of the coating. Furthermore, the moulded article contains release agents, such as magnesium stearate, on the surface of the article which may lead to coating surface defects like craters and to poor adhesion of the coating to surface of the article. Also different from a powder-in-mould coating process are the gelcoat and the liquid-in-mould coating processes, wherein a liquid coating composition is applied to the interior wall of a pre-heated mould. Gelcoat or liquid-in-mould coating processes have a number of disadvantages. For example, gelcoat or liquid coating compositions are difficult to apply uniformly to the interior wall of the mould and the overspray of such coating compositions needs to be collected and removed. Furthermore, the solvents or liquid monomers in the gel or liquid coating compositions tend to flash away when sprayed onto the pre-heated mould, thereby changing the coating formulation, creating bubbles and other irregularities in the coating and making it necessary to contain and to collect the vapour of the volatile ingredients. Also, gelcoats usually contain styrene, which is a reactive solvent under health and safety regulations. Where large objects are cast, such as for example windmill blades, boats and boat parts, automotive parts such as wind deflectors, hoods, trunk lid spoilers, pipes, building parts etc., a metal mould is not preferred (as a metal mould is either too big or very uneconomical to produce) and therefore a composite mould is usually used. In a composite mould, to facilitate obtaining a homogeneous thermosetting powder coating composition layer on the mould, the composite mould may be conductive if said composition is applied using electrostatic (spraying) techniques) and/or the mould may be preheated. In another embodiment, the invention relates to an article obtainable by the PIMC process. In another embodiment, the invention also relates to the use of a thermosetting powder coating composition according to the invention in a process as defined herein above that affords a partially or fully coated moulded article. In another embodiment, the invention also relates to the use of a composition according to the invention in a powder-in-mould-process that affords a partially or fully coated moulded article.

Further aspects of the invention and preferred features thereof are given in the claims herein. The invention will now be described in detail with reference to the following non limiting examples which are by way of illustration only. EXAMPLES The invention is explained in more detail with reference to the following non-limiting examples. In the Examples section, the abbreviation UR represents unsaturated resin comprising ethylenic unsaturations, the abbreviation VFUR represents vinyl functionalized urethane resins used as curing agent, the abbreviation PCC represents thermosetting powder coating composition and the abbreviation PC represents powder coating. In all the examples the unsaturated resin comprising ethylenic unsaturations (UR) were unsaturated polyester resins comprising 2-butenedioic acid ethylenic unsaturations. In all the examples the vinyl functionalized urethane resins (VFUR) used as curing agent were vinyl ether functionalized urethane resins (VEFUR). All powder coating compositions presented in the Examples were thermosetting powder coating compositions. In the Examples section the abbreviation “Comp” denotes a Comparative Example of either the VFUR e.g. CompVFURI, or a thermosetting powder coating composition e.g. CompPCCI, or a powder coating e.g. CompPCI. In the Examples section the abbreviation “Inv” denotes an Inventive Example of either the VFUR e.g. InvVFURI, or a thermosetting powder coating composition e.g. InvPCCI, ora powder coating e.g. InvPCI. In the Examples the abbreviation “n.m.” denotes “not measured”. In the Examples the abbreviation “n.p.e” denotes “not possible to extrude”. In the Examples the abbreviation “n.p.g” denotes “not possible to grind and/or to sieve and/or to flake”. In the Examples the abbreviation “n.a.” denotes “not applicable”. For Tables 5-7, most often “n.a.” is used when material was “n.p.e.” or “n.p.g.” and therefore no coated panels could be prepared and tested. In the Examples, the abbreviation “n.a.b.” denotes “no amorphous unsaturated resin comprising ethylenic unsaturations” and therefore no value could be given. Analytical methods and techniques for the measurement of the properties of the unsaturated polyester resins comprising ethylenic unsaturations and the vinyl functionalized urethane resins used as curing agents in the thermosetting powder coating compositions Unless otherwise stated the theoretical number average molecular weight (Mn) is defined as follows: Mn= (ΣΐΝΜ)/ (ZiNi) where Ni is the number of molecules of molecular weight Mi. In the case of the UR, the Mn was calculated by multiplying the targeted (theoretical) functionality (f) with 56110 and dividing the outcome thereof by the sum of the targeted (theoretical) acid value (AV) (mg KOH/g of the polyester resin) and the targeted (theoretical) hydroxyl value (OHV) (mg KOH/g of the polyester resin) according to the following equation: Mn= (56110 xf) /(AV+OHV) In the case of the VFUR, the Mn was calculated by the following equation: Y?=1(Ni*MWi)-MH20 Mn Ν ΜVFUR whereas Ni = mol of each monomer used for the preparation of the VFUR; MWi = Mn (Da) of each monomer used for the preparation of the VFUR; Μη2ο = mass (g) of water formed during the preparation of the VFUR; Nvfur = mol of VFUR prepared from said monomers. In case Mn refers to a monomer then the Mn corresponds to molecular weight values calculated on the basis of the molecular formula of said monomer, as such calculation is known to one skilled in the art. Melt viscosity (herein mentioned as viscosity, in Pa.s) measurements were carried out at 160°C on a Brookfield CAP 2000+H Viscometer. The applied shear-rate was 70 s"1 and a 19.05 mm spindle [cone spindle CAP-S-05 (19.05 mm, 1.8°)] was used. The acid and hydroxyl values of the unsaturated resins comprising ethylenic unsaturations (UR) that were unsaturated polyester resins comprising 2-butenedioic acid ethylenic unsaturations, were determined titrimetrically according to ISO 2114-2000 and ISO 4629-1978; in addition the targeted (theoretical) acid and hydroxyl values of said resins were also reported herein. 1H-NMR method for the measurement of RvmRor RvmRP.(1H-NMR method R) The Rvfur orRvFURc was measured via 1H-NMR spectroscopy according to the method entitled -for simplicity- “1H-NMR method R” which is presented herein. The estimated margin of error of this method for determining the WPU is +/-1 %; the margin of error was determined on the basis of measuring three samples of the same lot of a VFUR or VFURC. a. 1H-NMR method for the measurement of Rvfur (1H-NMR method Rvfur) The Rvfur was measured via 1H-NMR spectroscopy according to the following Formula I: Rvfur= [peak area of the chemical shift of the urethane proton (...ΝΗ-..,) of the urethane bonds (...-ΝΗ-0(=0)-0-...) in VFUR]/ [peak area of the chemical shift of the methine proton (...-ΟΗ=... ) of the vinyl groups (...-CH=CH2) in VFUR] (Formula I). According to Formula I, Rvfur has no unit. The peak areas of the urethane protons of the urethane bonds and the methine protons (...-ΟΗ=... ) of the vinyl groups (...-CH=CH2) in the VFUR of Formula I were measured as follows: A sample of 75 mg of VFUR was diluted at 40 °C in a mixture of 0.200 ml methanol and 0.600 ml deuterated chloroform containing a known amount (mg) of pyrazine as internal standard for performing 1H-NMR spectroscopy. Subsequently, the 1H-NMR spectrum of the VFUR sample was recorded at 40 °C on a 400 MHz NMR-spectrometer such as those made by BRUKER. Afterwards, the chemical shifts (ppm) of the urethane protons of the urethane bonds and the methine protons (...-ΟΗ=... ) of the vinyl groups (...-CH=CH2) in the VFUR were identified; the chemical shifts (ppm) of the urethane protons of the urethane bonds and the methine protons (...-ΟΗ=... ) of the vinyl groups (...-CH=CH2) in the VFUR of Formula I measured on a 400 MHz BRUKER NMR-spectrometer in methanol and deuterated chloroform were at about 5.2-6.3 and at about 6.4-6.5 ppm, respectively. Subsequently, with the help of suitable commercially available software for analyzing 1H-NMR spectra such as ACD/Spectrus Processor software provided by ACD/Labs, the peak areas of the urethane protons of the urethane bonds and the methine protons (...-CH=... ) of the vinyl groups (...-CH=CH2) in the VFUR of Formula I were measured and from these values the Rvfur was determined according to Formula I. In case in which 75 mg of a VFUR is not soluble at 40 °C in a mixture of 0.200 ml methanol and 0.600 ml deuterated chloroform, then any other suitable solvent or mixture of solvents known to the skilled person for performing the 1H-NMR spectroscopy may be used; for example DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide). The choice of a suitable solvent or a mixture of suitable solvents depends on the solubility of the sample of the VFUR in said solvents. In case in which 0.75 mg of VFUR is soluble in a mixture of 0.200 ml methanol and 0.600 ml deuterated chloroform at 40 °C, then this mixture of methanol and deuterated chloroform is the solvent of choice for performing the 1H-NMR spectroscopy for the VFUR. In case in which a different solvent or mixture of solvents is used for performing the 1H-NMR Method Rvfur, then the chemical shifts of the protons of Formula I may shift from the ones reported herein for the selected solvents for the 1H-NMR Method Rvfur since the actual chemical shifts may depend on the solvent or mixture of solvents used to record the 1H-NMR spectrum; in such case one should identify and determine the chemical shifts of the corresponding protons and apply Formula I for the determination of the Rvfur- b. 1H-NMR method for the measurement of Rvfurc (1H-NMR method Rvfurc) The Rvfurc was measured via 1H-NMR spectroscopy according to the following Formula II: Rvfurc= [peak area of the chemical shift of the urethane proton (.. .ΝΗ-..,) of the urethane bonds (...-ΝΗ-0(=0)-0-...) in VFURC]/ [peak area of the chemical shift of the methine proton (...-ΟΗ=... ) of the vinyl groups (...-CH=CH2) in VFURC] (Formula II). According to Formula II, Rvfurc has no unit. The peak areas of the urethane protons of the urethane bonds and the methine protons (...-ΟΗ= ) of the vinyl groups (...-CH=CH2) in the VFURC of Formula II were measured as follows: A sample of 75 mg of VFURC was diluted at 40 °C in a mixture of 0.200 ml methanol and 0.600 ml deuterated chloroform containing a known amount (mg) of pyrazine as internal standard for performing 1H-NMR spectroscopy. Subsequently, the 1H-NMR spectrum of the VFUR sample was recorded at 40 °C on a 400 MHz BRUKER NMR-spectrometer. Afterwards, the chemical shifts (ppm) of the urethane protons of the urethane bonds and the methine protons (...CH=... ) of the vinyl groups (...-CH=CH2) in the VFURC were identified; the chemical shifts (ppm) of the urethane protons of the urethane bonds and the methine protons (,..-CH=... ) of the vinyl groups (...-CH=CH2) in the VFURC of Formula II measured on a 400 MHz BRUKER NMR-spectrometer in methanol and deuterated chloroform were at about 5.2-6.3 and at about 6.4-6.5 ppm, respectively. Subsequently, with the help of suitable commercially available software for analyzing 1H-NMR spectra such as ACD/Spectrus Processor software provided by ACD/Labs, the peak areas of the urethane protons of the urethane bonds and the methine protons (...-CH=...) of the vinyl groups (...-CH=CH2) in the VFURC of Formula II were measured and from these values the Rvfur was determined according to Formula II. In case in which 75 mg of a VFURC is not soluble at 40 °C in a mixture of 0.200 ml methanol and 0.600 ml deuterated chloroform, then any other suitable solvent or mixture of solvents known to the skilled person for performing the 1H-NMR spectroscopy may be used; for example DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide). The choice of a suitable solvent or a mixture of suitable solvents depends on the solubility of the sample of the VFURC in said solvents. In case in which 0.75 mg of VFURC is soluble in a mixture of 0.200 ml methanol and 0.600 ml deuterated chloroform at 40 °C, then the mixture of methanol and deuterated chloroform is the solvent of choice for performing the 1H-NMR spectroscopy for the VFURC. In case in which a different solvent or mixture of solvents is used for performing the 1H-NMR Method Rvfurc, then the chemical shifts of the protons of Formula II may shift from the ones reported here for the selected solvents for the 1H-NMR Method Rvfurc since the actual chemical shifts may depend on the solvent or mixture of solvents used to record the 1H-NMR spectrum; in such case one should identify and determine the chemical shifts of the corresponding protons and apply Formula II for the determination of the Rvfurc- Estimation the Rvfur of the VFUR or the Rvfurc of the VFURC of the invention a. Estimation of the Rvfur of the VFUR of the invention A way to estimate the Rvfur of the VFUR of the invention (referred herein as “theoretical Rvfur”) can be done by dividing the total equivalents of urethane groups of the VFUR (which corresponds in case of compound A is an isocyanate to the total equivalents of isocyanate groups) by the total equivalents of vinyl ether groups used for the preparation of the VFUR [for examples, see Table 2, CompCCI: 5.00 equivalents of isocyanate groups (2,50 moles of “1,6-hexamethylene diisocyanate” * 2 equivalents isocyanate per “1,6-hexamethylene diisocyanate” monomer) / 5,00 equivalents of vinyl ether (5,00 moles of “4-hydroxybutyl vinyl ether” * 1 equivalent of vinyl ether per 4-hydroxybutyl vinyl ether molecule) = 1,00]. Here, it needs to be stressed out that for the purpose of the invention, the aforementioned way of estimating the RvFURis not by any means meant to replace or substitute the method used to measure the Rvfur that is disclosed herein (see Examples, 1H-NMR method Rvfur)- Any Rvfur value according to the invention must be measured according to the 1H-NMR Method Rvfur as it is disclosed herein. b. Estimation of the RvFURr.of the VFURC of the invention A way to estimate the Rvfurc of the VFURC of the invention (referred herein as “theoretical Rvfurc”) can be done by a calculation based on the following formula A: γη VFi * RyFURi η Li=1 WPUi KVFURC ~ m Li=iWPUi (Formula A) wherein, Wi is the weight of VFURi; Rvfuri is the theoretical Rvfuri of VFURi; WPUi is the theoretical WPU of VFURi; η denotes the amount of vinyl functionalized urethane resins contained in the VFURC; η is an integer of at Ieast2. Alternatively and in case measured values of Wi, Rvfuri and WPU of the VFURi are available, Formula IV may also be used as follows: Wi is the weight of VFURi; Rvfuri is the measured Rvfuri of VFURi; WPUi is the measured WPU of VFURi; ‘n’ denotes the amount of vinyl functionalized urethane resins contained in the VFURC; η is an integer of at least 2. For example, in case the VFURC consists of two VFURs, a FVFUR and a SVFUR, η = 2, Formula A will afford: Rvfurc γ2 Wj * RyFURi Li=1 WPUi V2 wi Li=^WPUi \W1*RVFUR1 , W2*RVFUR2\L WPUI WPU 2 J f ffl , W2 ] WPUI+WPU 2i Here, it needs to be stressed out that for the purpose of the invention, the aforementioned way of estimating the RvFURcis (theoretical Rvfurc) is not meant to replace or substitute the method used to measure the Rvfurc that is disclosed herein (see Examples, 1H-NMR method Rvfurc); any Rvfurc value according to the invention must be measured according to the 1H-NMR Method Rvfurc as it is disclosed herein. 1H-NMR method for the measurement of the WPU (1H-NMR method WPU) The WPU was measured via 1H-NMR spectroscopy according to the method entitled -for simplicity- “1H-NMR method WPU” which is presented herein. The estimated margin of error of this method for determining the WPU is +/- 2 %; the margin of error was determined on the basis of measuring three samples of the same lot of a VFUR or VFURC or UR. More specifically, said WPU was measured via 1H-NMR spectroscopy as explained herein after and it was calculated according to the following Formula III: WPU wrw 1 Ac_JNcn W ■ MW A IN resin pyr pyr pyr (Formula III) wherein, Wpyr and Wresin are the weights of pyrazine (internal standard) and resin, respectively, expressed in the same units. MWpyr is the molecular weight of the pyrazine (= 80 gr/mol). Apyr is the peak area for methine protons attached to the aromatic ring of pyrazine and Npyr is the number of the methine protons of pyrazine (= 4). In case of a VFUR: Ac=c is the peak area for the methine proton (...-CH=...) of the vinyl groups (...CH=CH2) in the VFUR; Nc=c is the number of methine protons (...-ΟΗ=... ) of the vinyl groups (...-CH=CH2) in the VFUR.

The peak areas of the methine protons of pyrazine and methine protons (...-CH=...) of the vinyl groups (...-CH=CH2) in the VFUR of Formula III were measured as follows: A sample of 75 mg of VFUR was diluted at 40 °C in a mixture of 0.200 ml methanol and 0.600 ml deuterated chloroform containing a known amount (mg) of pyrazine as internal standard for performing 1H-NMR spectroscopy. Subsequently, the 1H-NMR spectrum of the VFUR sample was recorded at 40 °C on a 400 MHz BRUKER NMR-spectrometer. Afterwards, the chemical shifts (ppm) of the methine protons of pyrazine and the methine protons (...-ΟΗ=... ) of the vinyl groups (,..-CH=CH2) in the VFUR were identified; the chemical shifts (ppm) of the methine protons of pyrazine and methine protons (...-ΟΗ=... ) of the vinyl groups (...-CH=CH2) in the VFUR of Formula III measured on a 400 MHz BRUKER NMR-spectrometer in methanol and deuterated chloroform were at about 8.6 and at about 6.4-6.5 ppm, respectively. Subsequently, with the help of suitable commercially available software for analyzing 1H-NMR spectra such as ACD/Spectrus Processor software provided by ACD/Labs, the peak areas of the methine protons of pyrazine and methine protons (...CH=...) of the vinyl groups (...-CH=CH2) in the VFUR of Formula III were measured and from these values the WPU was determined according to Formula III. The peak areas of the methine protons of pyrazine and methine protons (...-CH=...) of the vinyl groups (...-CH=CH2) in the VFURC of Formula III were measured as follows: A sample of 75 mg of VFURC was diluted at 40 °C in a mixture of 0.200 ml methanol and 0.600 ml deuterated chloroform containing a known amount (mg) of pyrazine as internal standard for performing 1H-NMR spectroscopy. Subsequently, the 1H-NMR spectrum of the VFURC sample was recorded at 40 °C on a 400 MHz BRUKER NMR-spectrometer. Afterwards, the chemical shifts (ppm) of the methine protons of pyrazine and the methine protons (,..-CH=... ) of the vinyl groups (,..-CH=CH2) in the VFURC were identified; the chemical shifts (ppm) of the methine protons of pyrazine and methine protons (,..-CH=... ) of the vinyl groups (...-CH=CH2) in the VFURC of Formula III measured on a 400 MHz BRUKER NMR-spectrometer in methanol and deuterated chloroform were at about 8.6 and at about 6.4-6.5 ppm, respectively. Subsequently, with the help of suitable commercially available software for analyzing 1H-NMR spectra such as ACD/Spectrus Processor software provided by ACD/Labs, The peak areas of the methine protons of pyrazine and methine protons (...-ΟΗ=,..) of the vinyl groups (...-CH=CH2) in the VFURC of Formula III were measured and from these values the WPU was determined according to Formula III. The peak areas of the methine protons of pyrazine and methine protons (...-ΟΗ=... ) of the ethylenic unsaturations (>C=C<) of the UR in Formula III were measured as follows: A sample of 75 mg of UR was diluted at 25 °C in 1 ml deuterated chloroform containing a known amount (mg) of pyrazine as internal standard for performing 1H-NMR spectroscopy. Subsequently, the 1H-NMR spectrum of the UR sample was recorded at 25 °C on a 400 MHz BRUKER NMR-spectrometer.

Subsequently, with the help of suitable commercially available software for analyzing 1H-NMR spectra such as ACD/Spectrus Processor software provided by ACD/Labs, the peak areas of the methine protons of pyrazine and methine protons (,..-CH=...) of the ethylenic unsaturations (>C=C<) of the UR of Formula III were measured and from these values the WPU was determined according to Formula III. In case in which 75 mg of a VFUR or a VFURC is not soluble at 40 °C in a mixture of 0.200 ml methanol and 0.600 ml deuterated chloroform, then any other suitable solvent or mixture of solvents known to the skilled person for performing the 1H-NMR spectroscopy may be used; for example DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide). In case in which 75 mg of a UR is not soluble at 25 °C in 1 ml of deuterated chloroform, then any other suitable solvent or mixture of solvents known to the skilled person for performing the 1H-NMR spectroscopy may be used; for example DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide). The choice of a suitable solvent or a mixture of suitable solvents depends on the solubility of the sample of the VFUR or VFURC or UR in said solvents. In case in which 0.75 mg of VFUR or VFURC is soluble in a mixture of 0.200 ml methanol and 0.600 ml deuterated chloroform at 40 °C, then a mixture of methanol and deuterated chloroform is the solvent of choice for performing the 1H-NMR spectroscopy for the VFUR or VFURC. In case in which 0.75 mg of UR is soluble in 1 ml. of deuterated chloroform at 25 °C, then deuterated chloroform is the solvent of choice for performing the 1H-NMR spectroscopy for the UR. In case in which a different solvent or mixture of solvents is used for performing the 1H-NMR Method WPU, then the chemical shifts of the protons of Formula III may shift from the ones reported here for the selected solvents for the 1H-NMR Method WPU since the actual chemical shifts may depend on the solvent or mixture of solvents used to record the 1H-NMR spectrum; in such case one should identify and determine the chemical shifts of the corresponding protons and apply Formula III for the determination of WPU. DSC method for the measurement of TG, Tm , Tn, AHm , AHn The glass transition temperature (Tg) (inflection point), the crystallization temperature (Tc), the crystallization enthalpy (AHC), the melting temperature (Tm) and the melting enthalpy (AHm) were measured via Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) on a Mettler Toledo, ΤΑ DSC821 apparatus, in N2 atmosphere as described herein after: A sample of 10 mg was placed in the DSC apparatus. The sample was brought to 25 °C. In the first heating curve, the sample was heated to 150 °C with a heating rate of 5 °C/min. The sample was kept at 150 °C for 1 min. The sample was subsequently cooled to -50 °C with a cooling rate of 5 °C /min, resulting in a cooling curve. After reaching -50 °C the sample was immediately heated to 150 °C with a heating rate of 5 °C/min, affording a second heating curve. The Tc and the AHc were determined from the cooling curve (150 °C to -50 °C, cooling rate 5 °C/min) whereas the Tg, Tm and AHm were determined from the second heating curve (-50 °C to 150 °C, heating rate of 5 °C/min). Measurements and assessment of properties of the thermosetting powder coating compositions After extrusion the sample was evaluated on processability aspects like ease to transport between the cooling rollers and stickiness on these rollers. Also was visually evaluated whether viscosity after extrusion was not too low and whether flaking was possible. Additionally the D value, as described in the method below was taken into account. All formulations with D values of 35°C or lower displays good processing behaviour. Good overall processing results in a ‘very good’ rating, poor overall processing results in a ‘poor’ rating (see Tables 5-8). All thermosetting powder coating compositions described in the Examples and shown in the relevant Tables, had a particle size lower than 90 microns. The physical powder storage stability (PPS) of the thermosetting powder coating compositions of the present invention was tested according to ISO 8130/ part 8, at 25°C for a total of 28 days. Prior to assessing the storage stability the thermosetting powder coating composition was left to cool down to room temperature for at least 2 hours. The extent of the agglomeration was visually assessed and ranked according to the following rating on a 1-10 scale [1: very poor stability (extensive agglomeration, thermosetting powder coating composition was compacted into one solid block) and 10: excellent stability (no agglomeration, free flowing powder, powder flow same as a freshly prepared thermosetting powder coating composition)]. In the context of the present invention thermosetting powder coating compositions that are rated with at least 5, are regarded as “storage stable”. The Tg of the thermosetting powder coating composition was measured after extrusion according to the DSC method mentioned herein. Method for the measurement of D (Method D) The measurement of D was carried out according to the following method: An amount of 0,05 g of a compressed pill of a blend of UR with either i) VFUR or ii) VFURC or iii) VFUR and VFURC (depending on the presence of VFUR and/or VFURC in the thermosetting powder coating composition; see definition of D in the description); the composition of which the D values are to measured), was inserted in a 8mm 0 plate-plate system (plate-plate distance = 0.6 mm) of the Physica MCR301 rheometer, at a temperature of 100 °C. After 5 minutes at 100 °C, the sample is cooled down to 0°C, at a cooling rate of 10 °C/min. This standard cooling procedure is meant to mimic the cooling procedure of a thermosetting powder coating composition leaving the extruder at a temperature of 100 °C. Immediately after the cooling step, the Tg achieved during cooling is measured during an heating step from 0 up to 100 °C, at a heating rate of 10 °C/min. While heating, the sample is subjected to a small oscillatory shear deformation (strain amplitude = 0.001) at a frequency of 1 Hz, in order to monitor the loss modulus (G") as a function of temperature. The Tg is defined as the temperature at which G” reaches its maximum value. The margin of error of this method +/-1 °C. In order to rule out the influence of the measuring method on the Tg value, Tg’s have been considered relative to the Tg values of the UR, measured according to the same procedure. Since all the thermosetting powder coating compositions of the Examples comprised only one UR and one VFUR, the reported D values of the thermosetting powder coating compositions of the Examples were calculated according to the following equation: D= (Tg of UR) - (Tg of a blend of UR with VFUR). Methods for the measurement of properties of the powder coatings derived upon heat-curing of the thermosetting powder coating compositions prepared herein. The properties -as mentioned herein- of the powder coatings CompPC1-16 and InvPCI-15 derived upon heat-curing of their corresponding thermosetting powder coating compositions presented in Tables 5-7 (CompPCC1-16 and lnvPCC1-15) were measured on aluminum panels (type: AL36) cured for 10 minutes at 120°C in a convection oven or on MDF panels (type: Medite MR) cured for 5 minutes at 120°C in a gas-catalytic IR oven by Vulcan or on Class A type sheet molding compound (known also as Class A Type SMC) as described below, cured for 10 minutes at 150°C. Film Konig hardness measurements were carried out on aluminum panels (type: AL36) according to DIN 53157 (Byk 5840 apparatus). Gloss and haze measurements were carried out on aluminum panels (type: AL36) according to ASTM-D-523/70 at 20° and 60° with a haze-gloss meter (Byk-Gardner). Smoothness (or also known in the art as flow) of powder coatings derived upon full cure of the corresponding heat-curable thermosetting powder coating compositions was determined on aluminum panels (type: AL36) by comparing the smoothness of the coating with PCI Powder Coating Smoothness panels (ACT Test Panels Inc., APR22163 (A) Batch: 50708816) at a thickness of approximately 60 pm. The rating of smoothness is from 1 to 10, with 1 representing the roughest coating and 10 representing the smoothest coating. For the heat-curable thermosetting powder coating compositions of the invention, their corresponding powder coatings had smoothness equal or higher to 1, more preferably equal or higher to 2, even more preferably equal or higher to 3, most preferably equal or higher to 4, are desirable. In addition, a score of 0 corresponds to a textured surface, in other words a poorer surface than available on the reference panels. Direct impact on MDF was measured on MDF panels (type: Medite MR) by dropping a steel ball with a diameter of 5/8 inch (16 mm) and a weight of 1 pound (452 gram) from a defined height. The height at which the ball is dropped is measured in inch (1 inch is 25,4 mm). The experiment is repeated by increasing the height with steps of one inch till the coating is damaged. The height at which no damage to the coating is observed when dropping the ball of 1 pound represents the maximal value in “inch pound”. The direct impact resistance is viewed herein as a measure of the flexibility of a powder coating. Ethanol (48 vol% ethyl alcohol) resistance (16 hr), coffee resistance (16 hr), red wine resistance (5 hr) and acetone resistance (10 sec) were carried out according to DIN 68861 1Β on aluminum panels (type: AL36). The minimum depth (mm) of indentation to cause failure [commonly known also as Erichsen Slow Penetration (ESP)] was determined on aluminum panels (type: AL36) according to ISO 1520:2006 (Cupping Test, especially §7.3), 7 days after curing the panels with the heat-curable thermosetting powder coating compositions as described herein (curing conditions 120°C for 10 min). The minimum depth of indentation to cause failure was determined. ISO 1520:2006 specifies an empirical test procedure for assessing the resistance of a coating to cracking and/or detachment from a metal substrate when subjected to gradual deformation by indentation under standard conditions. The method was carried out by gradually increasing the depth of indentation to determine the minimum depth (mm) at which the coating cracks and/or becomes detached from the substrate. The maximum of two valid measurements of the minimum depth of indentation to cause failure was reported. The adhesion was determined on MDF panels (type: Medite MR) using a cross-cut test (‘Gitterschnitt’) in accordance with ISO 2409 (edition 3, dated 15 May 2007). The degree of adhesion of the coating onto the substrate was classified with a scale from 0 to 5; Omeans cross-cut area was not affected (excellent adhesion); 1 means that the affected cross-cut area is significantly greater than 5 %; 2 means that the affected cross-cut area is significantly greater than 5 % but not significantly greater than 15 %; 3 means that the affected cross-cut area is significantly greater than 15 % but not significantly greater than 35 %; 4 means that the affected cross-cut area is significantly greater than 35 % but not significantly greater than 65 %; 5 means any degree of flaking that cannot even be classified by classification 4 (very poor adhesion). A skilled person will appreciate that an adhesion value of 5 or less [as measured in accordance to ISO 2409 (edition 3, dated 15 May 2007)] on any common substrate such as alumimium (AL36), MDF (type: Medite MR), SMC (Class A Type SMC as described herein) of the powder coatings of the invention, is sufficient for the powder coatings of the invention to exhibit the desired advantages described herein; thus an adhesion value as described herein of 5 or less is sufficient to achieve the objects of the invention. The powder coatings of the invention have preferably a good adhesion on MDF; by “good adhesion on MDF” is meant herein that the adhesion (as this is defined and measured in the Examples) of powder coatings derived upon curing of thermosetting powder coating compositions is 5 or less, preferably is 4 or less, more preferably is 3 or less, even more preferably is 2 or less, most preferably is 1 or less. The scratch resistance (in Newtons) of the powder coatings ΐηνΡ014-15 derived upon heat-curing of their corresponding thermosetting powder coating compositions presented in Table 8 (lnvPCC14-15) was measured on sheet molding compounds [Class A Type SMC, prepared from resin Palapreg Ρ 0423-02 (supplied by DSM Composite Resins) suitable for the preparation of a sheet molding compound, impregnated with glass fibers; Palapreg Ρ 0423-02 is an unsaturated polyester resin derived from maleic acid and standard glycols, dissolved in styrene) powder coated with the lnvPCC14-15 and cured for 10 minutes at 150°C in a heated mould as described herein after. The scratch resistance was measured with the Universal Scratch Tester model 413 from Erichsen, according to ΕΝ 438-2:2005 on powder coated class A Type SMC as the latter are exemplified herein. Increasing loads are applied in specified steps to a diamond scratching point of defined geometry. The resistance to scratching of the decorative laminate sheet under test is expressed as a numerical rating which defines the maximum applied load which does not produce a continuous surface scratch. The higher the reported applied load, the better the scratch resistance. The test result is verified by visually confirming that the next higher loadstep produces a continuous scratch. The definition of a scratch mark is where the contrast medium is engrained in the scratch, and is clearly visible as a line of colour contrasting with the colour of the specimen. As contrast medium black stamp pad ink was used.

Preparation of thermosetting powder coating compositions: General procedure The compositions of the thermosetting powder coating compositions are presented in Tables 5-7. The thermal radical initiators for example peroxides, the inhibitors and the pigments used for the preparation of the heat-curable thermosetting powder coating compositions are presented in Table 4. Luparox® Α75 is a dibenzoyl peroxide from Arkema, Kronos® 2310 is titanium dioxide from Kronos Titan GmbH, Resiflow® PV-5 is a flow control agent from Worlee-Chemie GmbH and Byk® 361 is a flow control agent from BYK. The thermosetting powder coating compositions were prepared by first mixing in a blender the unsaturated resin comprising ethylenic unsaturations (UR) (see ΡΕ1-ΡΕ5) and the vinyl functionalized urethane resin (VFUR) used as curing agents (see CompVFUR1-13 and lnvVFUR1-12) as presented in Tables 5-8; said mixture was subsequently extruded in a PRISM TSE16 PC twin screw extruder at 120 °C with a screw speed of 200 rpm and a torque higher than 90 %. The extrudate of UR and VFUR was allowed to cool to room temperature and broken into chips. Subsequently, the extrudate of UR and VFUR was mixed with the rest of the ingredients of the thermosetting powder composition presented in Tables 5-8 in a blender; subsequently, the mixture obtained was extruded in a PRISM TSE16 PC twin screw extruder at 65 °C with a screw speed of 200 rpm and a torque higher than 90 %. The extrudate was allowed to cool at room temperature and broken into chips. These chips were then ground in an ultra-centrifugal mill at 14,000 rpm and sieved in a Retsch ΖΜ100 sieve. The sieve fraction with particle size below 90 pm was collected (by means of a Fritsch Analysette Spartan sieving apparatus equipped with a 90 micron sieve, sieving performed for 15 minutes at 2,5 mm amplitude) and used for further experiments. Preparation of the powder coatings CompPC1-16 and lnvPC1-15 a.

As it can be seen from the comparative Examples in Table 5 most of said comparative compositions demonstrated poor processability (CompPCCI, CompPCC2, CompPCC7-12) whilst the ones who demonstrated good processability (CompPCC3-6), had either at least poor storage stability (< 5) (CompPCC4-6), or at least unacceptable smoothness (<1) (CompPCC3-4), or poor coffee resistance (<3) (CompPCC3-4 and CompPCC6). Thus, it is clear that none of the comparative Examples of Table 5 combined enhanced processability with good storage stability, good smoothness, good coffee resistance. Uracross® Ρ3307 was used as a curing agent in the comparative thermosetting powder coating compositions CompPCCI, CompPCC2, CompPCC7, CompPCCI 0 . Uracross® Ρ3307 is an example of a crystalline solid vinyl functionalized urethane resin which is a vinyl ether terminated urethane resin that does not read on the vinyl functionalized urethane resin of the invention since it has a Rvruf equal to 1.02 that is outside the claimed range of RVRUFfor the VFUR of the invention. The processability of all these comparative thermosetting powder coating compositions comprising Uracross® Ρ3307 as a curing agent was poor since upon extrusion the composition was sticky (on the cooling rollers), was difficult to flake (poor flaking) and it was hard to grind and sieve (poor grinding and sieving). In addition the storage stability of all these comparative thermosetting powder coating compositions comprising Uracross® Ρ3307 as a curing agent was poor (<5) and furthermore all these comparative compositions had a D value of higher than 35 °C. Moreover, CompPCCI and CompPCCIO failed also on acetone resistance whilst CompPCCIO failed further on coffee resistance (<3). Examples of amorphous vinyl functionalized urethane resins (comparative examples) used as a curing agent in thermosetting powder coating compositions, are given Table 6. As it can be seen from the comparative Examples in Table 6 almost all powder coatings comprising an amorphous VFUR (see CompPCCI3-16) failed in processability since these compositions failed during pre-mixing, thus it was not even possible to extrude/prepare these compositions! as a consequence stickiness, flaking, grinding and sieving as well the D values were not assessed/measured; the CompPCCI 6 which had good processability had no flexibility (direct impact resistance equal to 0 inch pounds!). Thus, it is clear that none of the comparative Examples of Table 6 combined enhanced processability with good flexibility. In addition, upon comparing the properties of the comparative thermosetting powder coating compositions and those of their corresponding powder coatings of Table 5 (comparative crystalline VFUR as explained herein) with the properties of the comparative thermosetting powder coating compositions and those of their corresponding powder coatings of Table 6 (amorphous VFUR as explained herein), it is was found that when amorphous vinyl ether functionalized urethane resins were used in thermosetting powder coating compositions said powder coating compositions and their powder coatings presented inferior coating film properties such as smoothness and/or flexibility in comparison to the coating film properties of powder coating compositions and their powder coatings obtained compositions comprising (comparative) crystalline vinyl ether functionalized urethane resins. Examples of crystalline vinyl functionalized urethane resins having a Rvfur within the relevant claimed range (inventive examples) used as a curing agent in thermosetting powder coating compositions, are given Table 7. As it can be seen from the inventive examples in Table 7, all said inventive compositions had enhanced processability, good storage stability, acceptable smoothness, good flexibility, good coffee resistance. Examples of inventive thermosetting powder coating compositions lnvPCC14 and lnvPCC15 and their powder coatings comprising a crystalline vinyl functionalized urethane resin (VFUR) as curing agent, said VFUR having Rvfur within the relevant claimed range are presented in Table 8. The powder coatings of these thermosetting powder coating compositions were produced as described in Examples/b. Preparation of lnvPC14-15 via the powder-in-mould-coating process. As can be seen from Table 8, the inventive thermosetting powder coating compositions had good scratch resistance (>1 Ν). Therefore, as can be seen from the Examples in Tables 5, 6, 7 and 8, thermosetting powder coating compositions having enhanced processability, good storage stability and once cured provided powder coatings having acceptable smoothness, good flexibility, good coffee resistance, good scratch resistance, can only be prepared from a thermosetting powder coating composition comprising a VFUR and/or a VFURC according to 1.
