Synthesis Example 5: Production of Aromatic Amine Derivative (PH5)
In the same manner as in Synthesis Example 2 except for using 4.3 g of the intermediate 15 in place of the intermediate 4 and using 4.8 g of the intermediate 16 in place of the intermediate 5, 4.2 g (yield: 60%) of a white solid was obtained, which was identified as the following compound (PH5) by FD-MS analysis: m/z=696 (theoretical value: 696 for C48H28N2S2).
