This application is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 13/571,026 filed Aug. 9, 2012, which in turn claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/579,966 filed Dec. 23, 2011 and U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/522,031 filed Aug. 10, 2011, the entire disclosures of these prior applications being incorporated herein by reference. The invention relates to therapies by injection of insulin(s) for treating diabetes. Insulin therapy, or diabetes therapy by injecting insulin, has made remarkable progress in recent years by virtue especially of the development of novel insulins that offer correction of patients' glycaemia, which enables better simulation of the physiological activity of the pancreas. To cover his daily insulin needs, a diabetic patient currently has available, schematically, two types of insulin with complementary actions: prandial insulins (or rapid-acting insulins) and basal insulins (or slow-acting insulins). Prandial insulins allow rapid management (metabolization and/or storage) of the glucose provided by meals and snacks. The patient must inject a prandial insulin before each food intake, i.e. about 2 to 3 injections per day. The prandial insulins most commonly used are: the recombinant human insulin, NovoLog® (insulin aspart from Novo Nordisk), Humalog® (insulin lispro from Eli Lilly) and Apidra® (insulin glulisine from Sanofi-Aventis). Basal insulins maintain the patient's glycaemic homeostasis, outside periods of food intake. They act essentially by blocking the endogenous production of glucose (hepatic glucose). The daily dose of basal insulin generally corresponds to 40-50% of the total daily insulin needs. Depending on the basal insulin used, this dose is dispensed in 1 or 2 injections, regularly distributed throughout the day. The basal insulins most commonly used are Levemir® (insulin detemir from Novo Nordisk) and Lantus® (insulin glargine from Sanofi-Aventis). It will be noted, for the sake of completeness, that NPH (NPH insulin, for Neutral Protamine Hagedorn; Humuline NPH®, Insulatard®) is the oldest basal insulin. This formulation is the result of a precipitation of human insulin (anionic at neutral pH) with a cationic protein, protamine. These microcrystals are dispersed in an aqueous suspension and dissolve slowly after subcutaneous injection. This slow dissolution ensures sustained release of the insulin. However, this release does not ensure a constant concentration of insulin over time. The release profile is bell-shaped and lasts only between 12 and 16 hours. It is thus injected twice a day. This NPH basal insulin is much less efficient than the modern basal insulins Levemir® and Lantus®. NPH is an intermediate-acting basal insulin. The principle of NPH changed with the appearance of rapid insulin analogues to give “Premix” products that afford both rapid action and intermediate action. NovoLog Mix® (Novo Nordisk) and Humalog Mix® (Eli Lilly) are formulations comprising a rapid insulin analogue, Novolog® and Humalog®, partially complexed with protamine. These formulations thus contain microcrystals of insulin whose action is said to be intermediate, and a proportion of insulin which has remained soluble, whose action is rapid. These formulations do indeed offer the advantage of a rapid insulin, but they also have the defect of NPH, i.e. a duration of action limited to between 12 and 16 hours and a bell-shaped release of insulin. However, these products enable the patient to carry out a single injection of an intermediate-acting basal insulin with a rapid-acting prandial insulin. In point of fact, many patients are desirous to reduce their number of injections. The basal insulins currently marketed and currently under clinical development may be categorized as a function of the technical solution for obtaining sustained action, and two approaches are used at the present time. The first, that of insulin detemir, is the binding to albumin in vivo. It is an analogue, soluble at pH 7, which comprises a fatty acid (tetradecanoyl) side chain attached to position B29 which, in vivo, enables this insulin to combine with albumin. Its sustained action is mainly due to this affinity for albumin after subcutaneous injection. However, its pharmacokinetic profile does not make it possible to cover a whole day, which means that it is usually used in two injections per day. Other basal insulins which are soluble at pH 7, such as Degludec®, are currently under development. Degludec® also comprises a fatty acid side chain attached to insulin (hexadecandoyl-γ-L-Glu). The second, that of insulin glargine, is the precipitation at physiological pH. This is an analogue of human insulin obtained by elongation of the C-terminal part of the B chain of human insulin with two arginine residues, and by substitution of the asparagine residue A21 with a glycine residue (U.S. Pat. No. 5,656,722). The addition of the two arginine residues was conceived to adjust the pI (isoelectric point) of insulin glargine at physiological pH, and thus make this insulin analogue insoluble in physiological medium. The substitution of A21 was conceived in order to make insulin glargine stable at acidic pH and thus to be able to formulate it in the form of an injectable solution at acidic pH. During subcutaneous injection, the passage of insulin glargine from an acidic pH (pH 4-4.5) to a physiological pH (neutral pH) brings about its precipitation under the skin. The slow redissolution of the insulin glargine microparticles ensures a slow and sustained action. The hypoglycaemic effect of insulin glargine is virtually constant over a period of 24 hours, which allows the majority of patients to limit themselves to a single injection per day. Insulin glargine is nowadays considered as the best basal insulin marketed. However, the acidic pH of the formulations of basal insulins, the isoelectric point of which is between 5.8 and 8.5, of insulin glargine type, prevents any pharmaceutical combination with other proteins and in particular prandial insulins, since the latter are unstable at acidic pH. However, no one has hitherto sought to dissolve these basal insulins, the isoelectric point of which is between 5.8 and 8.5, of insulin glargine type, at neutral pH, while maintaining a difference in solubility between the in vitro medium (containing it) and the in vivo medium (under the skin), independently of the pH. Specifically, the operating principle of basal insulins, of insulin glargine type, outlined above, namely that they are soluble at acidic pH and precipitate at physiological pH, dissuades a person skilled in the art from any solution in which insulin of insulin glargine type would be dissolved at pH 6-8 while maintaining its essential property, which is that of precipitating in subcutaneous medium. Furthermore, the impossibility of formulating a prandial insulin, at acidic pH, arises from the fact that a prandial insulin undergoes, under these conditions, a deamidation side reaction in position A21; this does not make it possible to satisfy the requirement of the US Pharmacopeia, namely less than 5% of by-product after 4 weeks at 30° C. Furthermore, this acidic pH of formulations of basal insulins, the isoelectric point of which is between 5.8 and 8.5, of insulin glargine type, even prevents any extemporaneous combination with prandial insulins at neutral pH. A recent clinical study, presented at the 69th Scientific Sessions of the American Diabetes Association, New Orleans, La., 5-9 Jun. 2009, verified this limitation of use of insulin glargine. A dose of insulin glargine and a dose of prandial insulin (in the case in point, insulin lispro) were mixed together just before injection (E. Cengiz et al., 2010, Diabetes Care, 33(5), 1009-12). This experiment made it possible to demonstrate a significant delay in the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of prandial insulin, which may give rise to postprandial hyperglycaemia and to nocturnal hypoglycaemia. This study indeed confirms the incompatibility of insulin glargine with the currently marketed rapid-acting insulins. Moreover, the instructions for use for Lantus®, the commercial product based on insulin glargine from the company Sanofi-Aventis, explicitly indicates to users that they should not mix it with a solution of prandial insulin, whichever it may be, on account of the serious risk of modifying the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the insulin glargine and/or of the mixed prandial insulin. However, from a therapeutic point of view, clinical studies made public during the 70th annual scientific sessions of the American Diabetes Association (ADA) of 2010, abstract 2163-PO and abstract number 0001-LB, in particular those conducted by the company Sanofi-Aventis, showed that treatments which combine Lantus®, insulin glargine, and a prandial insulin are much more efficient than treatments based on products of the “Premix”, Novolog Mix® or Humalog Mix® type. As regards combinations of insulin glargine and rapid insulin, the company Biodel has notably described, in patent application U.S. Pat. No. 7,718,609, compositions comprising a basal insulin and a prandial insulin at a pH of between 3.0 and 4.2 in the presence of a chelating agent and polyacids. This patent teaches how to make a prandial insulin compatible at acidic pH in the presence of an insulin of insulin glargine type. It does not teach how to prepare a combination of insulin of insulin glargine type and of a prandial insulin at neutral pH. From the analysis of the compositions described in the literature and the patents, it appears that the insolubility at pH 7 of basal insulins of the insulin glargine type is a prerequisite for having its slow action. As a result, all the solutions proposed for combining them with other products, such as prandial insulins, are based on tests of dissolution or stabilization of prandial insulins at acidic pH; see, for example, WO 2007/121256 and WO 2009/021955. Surprisingly, the compositions according to the invention make it possible to dissolve, at pH 7, a basal insulin whose isoelectric point is between 5.8 and 8.5. Surprisingly, the compositions according to the invention allow maintenance of the duration of the hypoglycaemic activity of the basal insulin whose isoelectric point is between 5.8 and 8.5, despite its dissolution at pH 7 before injection. This noteworthy property arises from the fact that the insulin of insulin glargine type dissolved at pH 7 in the composition of the invention precipitates in subcutaneous medium by means of a change of composition of the medium. The factor triggering the precipitation of the insulin of insulin glargine type is no longer the pH modification, but a modification of composition of the environment during the passage of the pharmaceutical composition into the physiological medium. By solving this problem of solubility at pH 7, the present invention makes it possible: to propose an injectable composition, intended for treating diabetes, comprising a basal insulin whose isoelectric point is between 5.8 and 8.5, in the form of a homogeneous solution at pH 7, while retaining its biological activity and its action profile;to propose a composition in the form of a formulation comprising a combination of a basal insulin whose isoelectric point is between 5.8 and 8.5 and a prandial insulin without modification of the activity profile of the prandial insulin which is soluble at pH 6-8 and unstable at acidic pH, while maintaining the basal action profile intrinsic to the basal insulin;to propose an injectable composition, intended for treating diabetes, additionally comprising a combination of a basal insulin whose isoelectric point is between 5.8 and 8.5 and a derivative or an analogue of a gastrointestinal hormone such as GLP-1 or “glucagon-like peptide-1”;for patients to reduce their number of injections;for the said compositions to satisfy the requirements of the American Pharmacopeia and European Pharmacopoeia. Surprisingly, in insulin combinations of insulin glargine type with a prandial insulin, which are subject-matters of the invention, the rapid action of the prandial insulin is preserved despite the precipitation of the insulin of insulin glargine type in subcutaneous medium. The invention relates to a composition in the form of an injectable aqueous solution, the pH of which is between 6.0 and 8.0, comprising at least: a) a basal insulin, the isoelectric point pI of which is between 5.8 and 8.5;b) a dextran substituted by radicals carrying carboxylate charges and hydrophobic radicals of formula I or of formula II: in which: R is —OH or chosen from the group consisting of the radicals: -(f-[A]-COOH)n;-(g-[B]-k-[D])m, D comprising at least one alkyl chain comprising at least 8 carbon atoms;n represents the degree of substitution of the glucoside units by -f-[A]-COOH and 0.1≦n≦2;m represents the degree of substitution of the glucoside units by -g-[B]-k-[D] and 0<m≦0.5;q represents the degree of polymerization as glucoside units, that is to say the mean number of glucoside units per polysaccharide chain, and 3≦q≦50;-(f-[A]-COOH)n: -A- is a linear or branched radical comprising from 1 to 4 carbon atoms; the said -A- radical:being bonded to a glucoside unit via a functional group f chosen from the group consisting of ether, ester and carbamate functional groups;-(g-[B]-k-[D])m: —B— is a linear or branched, at least divalent, radical comprising from 1 to 4 carbon atoms; the said —B— radical:being bonded to a glucoside unit via a functional group g chosen from the group consisting of ether, ester and carbamate functional groups;being bonded to a -D radical via a functional group k; k chosen from the group consisting of ester, amide and carbamate functional groups; the said -D radical: being an —X(-l-Y)p radical, X being an at least divalent radical comprising from 1 to 12 atoms chosen from the group consisting of C, N and O atoms, optionally carrying carboxyl or amine functional groups and/or resulting from an amino acid, a dialcohol, a diamine or a mono- or polyethylene glycol mono- or diamine; Y being a linear or cyclic alkyl group, an alkylaryl or an arylalkyl, of 8 to 30 carbon atoms, optionally substituted by one or more C1 to C3 alkyl groups; p≧1 and l a functional group chosen from the group consisting of ester, amide and carbamate functional groups;f, g and k being identical or different;the free acid functional groups being in the form of salts of alkali metal cations chosen from the group consisting of Na+ and K+;and, when p=1, if Y is a C8 to C14 alkyl, then q*m≧2, if Y is a C15 alkyl, then q*m≧2; and if Y is a C16 to C20 alkyl, then q*m≧1;and, when p≧2, if Y is a C8 to C9 alkyl, then q*m≧2 and, if Y is a C10 to C16 alkyl, then q*m≧0.2; in which: R is —OH or a -(f-[A]-COOH)n radical: -A- is a linear or branched radical comprising from 1 to 4 carbon atoms; the said radical -A-:being bonded to a glucoside unit via a functional group f chosen from the group consisting of ether, ester or carbamate functional groups;n represents the degree of substitution of the glucoside units by -f-[A]-COOH and 0.1≦n≦2;R′ is chosen from the group consisting of the radicals: —C(O)NH-[E]-(o-[F])t;—CH2N(L)z-[E]-(o-[F])t;in which: z is a positive integer equal to 1 or 2,L is chosen from the group consisting of: —H and z is equal to 1, and/or-[A]-COOH and z is equal to 1 or 2, if f is an ether functional group,—CO-[A]-COOH and z is equal to 1 if f is an ester functional group, and—CO—NH-[A]-COOH and z is equal to 1 if f is a carbamate functional group;-[E]-(o-[F])t: -E- is a linear or branched, at least divalent, radical comprising from 1 to 8 carbon atoms and optionally comprising heteroatoms, such as O, N or S;—F— is a linear or cyclic alkyl group, an alkylaryl or an arylalkyl, of 12 to 30 carbon atoms, optionally substituted by one or more C1 to C3 alkyl groups;o is a functional group chosen from the group consisting of ether, ester, amide or carbamate functional groups;t is a positive integer equal to 1 or 2;q represents the degree of polymerization as glucoside units, that is to say the mean number of glucoside units per polysaccharide chain, and 3≦q≦50;the free acid functional groups being in the form of salts of alkali metal cations chosen from the group consisting of Na+ and K+;when z=2, the nitrogen atom is in the form of a quaternary ammonium.

The final pH is adjusted to 7 by addition of concentrated NaOH or HCl. The formulation is clear, testifying to the good solubility of glargine and lispro under these formulation conditions.

The PBS/BSA mixture simulates the composition of the subcutaneous medium. A precipitate appears. Centrifuging at 4000 rev/min is carried out in order to separate the precipitate from the supernatent. Subsequently, Lantus® is assayed in the supernatent. The percentages of precipitation of Lantus® are similar to the control described in Example B13. The results are summarized in Table 6.

Regulations require 95% of native (nondegraded) insulin after 4 weeks at 30° C. After 4 weeks, the formulations studied meet the specifications defined by the regulations. The results are combined in Table 7. TABLE 7 Percentage of native Percentage of native glargine after prandial insulin after Compositions 4 weeks at 30° C. 4 weeks at 30° C.

Example B36 Injectability of the Solutions All the compositions prepared can be injected with the normal systems for the injection of insulin. The solutions described in Examples B7 to B12 and the compositions described in Examples B27 à B33 are injected without any difficulty, both with insulin syringes equipped with 31-gauge needles and with insulin pens from Novo Nordisk, sold under the name of Novopen®, equipped with 31-gauge needles. Example B37 Protocol for Measuring the Pharmacodynamics of the Insulin Solutions Preclinical studies were carried out on pigs for the purpose of evaluating two compositions according to the invention: Lantus®/Apidra® (75/25), formulated with Polysaccharide 4 (6 mg/ml), described in Example B7, and Lantus®/Humalog® (75/25), formulated with Polysaccharide 4 (6 mg/ml), described in Example B8. The hypoglycaemic effects of these compositions were compared with respect to injections carried out with simultaneous but separate injections of Lantus® (pH 4) and then of a prandial insulin Apidra® or Humalog®. Six domesticated pigs weighing approximately 50 kg, catheterized beforehand in the jugular vein, are deprived of food for 2 to 3 hours before the beginning of the experiment. In the hour preceding the injection of insulin, three blood samples are taken in order to determine the basal glucose level. Injection of insulin at a dose of 0.4 IU/kg is carried out by subcutaneous injection into the neck, under the ear of the animal, using the Novopen® insulin pen equipped with at 31 G needle. Blood samples are subsequently taken after 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 90, 120, 240, 360, 480, 600, 660 and 720 minutes. After each sample has been taken, the catheter is rinsed with a dilute heparin solution. A drop of blood is taken in order to determine the glycaemia using a glucose meter. The pharmacodynamic curves of glucose are subsequently plotted. The results obtained are presented in the form of pharmacodynamic curves for glucose represented in FIGS. 1 to 6. Lantus®/Apidra® (75/25), formulated with Polysaccharide 4 (6 mg/ml). FIG. 1: Mean+standard deviation of the mean curves for the sequential administrations of Apidra® and Lantus®, in comparison with a composition according to the invention Polysaccharide 4/Lantus®/Apidra® (75/25). FIG. 2: Apidra® Lantus® individual curves. FIG. 3: Polysaccharide 4/Apidra®/Lantus® individual curves. FIG. 1 presents the mean curves for drop in glycaemia and the standard deviations of the mean for the pigs tested for each formulation. The drop in glycaemia in the first 30 minutes is similar for the two formulations, indicating that the presence of a polysaccharide does not interfere with the rapid-acting nature of Apidra®. On the other hand, between 90 min and 10 h (600 minutes), the sequential administration of Apidra® and Lantus® brings about a heterogeneous drop in glucose with a homogeneous plateau response with regard to three pigs and a heterogeneous response with regard to the other three pigs (FIG. 2). In contrast, the six pigs tested with the Polysaccharide 4/Apidra®/Lantus® formulation have a homogeneous response (FIG. 3). This is reflected by the analysis of the coefficients of variation (CV) between 60 min and 10 h, which are on average 54% (between 21% and 113%) for the Apidra® Lantus® control and 12% (between 5% and 25%) for Polysaccharide 4/Apidra®/Lantus®. Lantus®/Humalog® (75/25), formulated with Polysaccharide 4 (6 mg/ml). FIG. 4: Mean+standard deviation of the mean curves for the sequential administrations of Humalog® and Lantus® in comparison with the administration of a composition according to the invention Polysaccharide 4/Humalog®/Lantus®. FIG. 5: Humalog® Lantus® individual curves. FIG. 6: Polysaccharide 4/Humalog®/Lantus® individual curves. FIG. 4 presents the mean curves for drop in glycaemia and the standard deviations of the mean for the pigs tested with regard to each formulation. The drop in glycaemia in the first 30 minutes is similar for the two formulations, indicating that the presence of Polysaccharide 4 does not interfere with the rapid-acting nature of Humalog®. On the other hand, between 60 min and 8 h (480 minutes), the sequential administration of Humalog® and Lantus® brings about a heterogeneous drop in glucose with a homogeneous plateau response with regard to four pigs and a heterogeneous response with regard to the other two pigs (FIG. 5). In contrast, the 5 pigs tested with the Polysaccharide 4/Humalog®/Lantus® formulation have a homogeneous response (FIG. 6). This is reflected by the analysis of the coefficients of variation (CV) with regard to the data for drop in glycaemia between 60 min and 8 h, which are on average 54% (between 31% and 72%) for the Humalog® Lantus® control and 15% (between 6% and 28%) for Polysaccharide 4/Humalog®/Lantus®. The presence of Polysaccharide 4 thus greatly reduced the variability of Lantus® with regard to the drop in glycaemia. Example B38 Protocol for Measuring the Pharmacodynamics of the Insulin Solutions Preclinical studies were carried out on dogs for the purpose of evaluating six compositions according to the invention: The hypoglycaemic effects of these compositions were compared with respect to injections carried out with simultaneous but separate injections of 100 IU/ml Lantus® (pH 4) and then of a prandial insulin 100 IU/ml Humalog®. Ten domesticated dogs (beagles) weighing approximately 12 kg are deprived of food for 18 hours before the beginning of the experiment. In the hour preceding the injection of insulin, three blood samples are taken in order to determine the basal glucose level. The injection of insulin at a dose of 0.53 IU/kg (unless otherwise mentioned in the examples below) is carried out by subcutaneous injection into the neck of the animal using the Novopen® insulin pen equipped with a 31 G needle. Blood samples are subsequently taken after 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240, 300, 360, 420, 480, 540, 600, 660, 720, 780, 840, 900 and 960 minutes. The first samples are taken with a catheter (up to 180 min) and then directly from the jugular vein. After each sample has been taken, the catheter is rinsed with a dilute heparin solution. A drop of blood is taken in order to determine the glycaemia by means of a glucose meter. The pharmacodynamic curves for glucose are subsequently plotted. The results obtained are presented in the form of pharmacodynamic curves for glucose represented in FIGS. 7 to 12. The Solution of Example B28 FIG. 7: Mean+standard deviation of the mean curves for the sequential administrations of Humalog® (100 IU/ml, 0.13 IU/kg) and Lantus® (100 IU/ml, 0.4 IU/kg), in comparison with a composition according to the invention described in Example B28 (0.53 IU/kg). FIG. 7 presents the mean curves for drop in glycaemia and the standard deviations of the mean for the dogs tested for each formulation. The two curves are similar up to 12 hours with a rapid drop in glycaemia, indicating that the polysaccharide does not influence the rapid-acting effect of Humalog®, a marked return between the peak due to Humalog® and the plateau due to glargine, and then a plateau of the glargine up to 12 h, indicating that the basal effect of glargine is well retained. The Solution of Example B27 FIG. 8: Mean+standard deviation of the mean curves for the sequential administrations of Humalog® (100 IU/ml, 0.13 IU/kg) and Lantus® (100 IU/ml, 0.4 IU/kg) in comparison with a composition according to the invention described in Example B27 (0.47 IU/kg). FIG. 8 presents the mean curves for drop in glycaemia and the standard deviations of the mean for the dogs tested for each formulation. In this comparison, the dose of basal insulin (Lantus®) is identical whereas the dose of Humalog® is half for the composition, with respect to the control. The drop in glucose is greater in the case of the formulation B27 in comparison with the control, whereas this control contains twice as much Humalog®. On the other hand, the duration of the plateau is shorter in the case of the combination, with respect to the control. This indicates that, in this composition, a portion of Lantus® is not precipitated on injection and acts with Humalog®. The Solution of Example B29 FIG. 9: Mean+standard deviation of the mean curves for the sequential administrations of Humalog® (100 IU/ml, 0.13 IU/kg) and Lantus® (100 IU/ml, 0.4 IU/kg) in comparison with a composition according to the invention described in Example B29 (0.53 IU/kg). FIG. 9 presents the mean curves for drop in glycaemia and the standard deviations of the mean for the dogs tested for each formulation. The two curves are similar, with a rapid drop in glycaemia, indicating that the polysaccharide does not influence the rapid-acting effect of Humalog®, a marked return between the peak due to Humalog® and the plateau due to Lantus®, and then a plateau of the Lantus® up to 13 h, indicating that the basal effect of glargine is well retained. The Solution of Example B31 FIG. 10: Mean+standard deviation of the mean curves for the sequential administrations of Humalog® (100 IU/ml, 0.13 IU/kg) and Lantus® (100 IU/ml, 0.4 IU/kg), in comparison with a composition according to the invention described in Example B31 (0.48 IU/kg). FIG. 10 presents the mean curves for drop in glycaemia and the standard deviations of the mean for the dogs tested for each formulation. In this comparison, the dose of basal insulin (Lantus®) is identical, whereas the dose of Humalog® is half, for the composition, with respect to the control. The drop in glucose is greater in the case of the control, with respect to the combination corresponding to Example B31. This response was expected, in view of the concentration of Humalog® in the combination, which was half that of the control. Furthermore, the duration of the Lantus® plateau is identical in the case of the combination, with respect to the control. This indicates that, in this composition and by comparison with the composition described in Example B29 (FIG. 9), it is possible to adjust the amount of Humalog in the combination without modifying the Lantus® basal effect. The Solution of Example B30 FIG. 11: Mean+standard deviation of the mean curves for the sequential administrations of Humalog® (100 IU/ml, 0.24 IU/kg) and Lantus® (100 IU/ml, 0.4 IU/kg) in comparison with a composition according to the invention described in Example B30 (0.64 IU/kg). FIG. 11 presents the mean curves for drop in glycaemia and the standard deviations of the mean for the dogs tested for each formulation. The two curves are similar, with a rapid drop in glycaemia, indicating that the polysaccharide does not influence the rapid-acting effect of Humalog®, a marked return between the peak due to Humalog® and the plateau due to Lantus®, and then a plateau of the Lantus® up to 10 h, indicating that the glargine basal effect is well retained. The Solution of Example B32 FIG. 12: Mean+standard deviation of the mean curves for the sequential administrations of Humalog® (100 IU/ml, 0.13 IU/kg) and Lantus® (100 IU/ml, 0.4 IU/kg) in comparison with a composition according to the invention described in Example B32 (0.53 IU/kg). FIG. 12 presents the mean curves for drop in glycaemia and the standard deviations of the mean for the dogs tested for each formulation. The two curves are similar up to 10 hours, with a rapid drop in glycaemia, indicating that the polysaccharide does not influence the rapid-acting effect of Humalog®, a marked return between the peak due to Humalog® and the plateau due to Lantus®, and then a glargine plateau, indicating that the glargine basal effect is retained up to 10 h. In conclusion, FIGS. 7 to 12 show that, by adjusting the composition of the polysaccharide and the concentrations of lispro and glargine, it is possible to obtain profiles identical to a double injection with different proportions of rapid-acting insulin and basal insulin. It is also possible to adjust the duration of the basal insulin without impacting the rapid-acting insulin or to adjust the amount of rapid-acting insulin without impacting the effect of the basal insulin.

Generalization: Clear solutions of Lantus at 100 IU/ml and at pH 7 were also obtained with concentrations of substituted dextrans at 20 and 40 mg/ml by following the same protocol as that described in Example C3. Thus, a weight of lyophilized polysaccharide among those described in Table 1 is weighed out accurately. This lyophilisate is taken up in the insulin glargine solution of Example B4, so as to obtain a solution whose concentration of substituted dextran is 20 or 40 mg/ml, as described in Table 8.
