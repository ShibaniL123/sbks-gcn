The ninth step
To a solution of Compound 22 (290mg, 0.82mmol) in DMSO (2.9 mL) were added potassium carbonate (455 mg, 3.29 mmol) and 4,4-dimethylpiperidine (936 mg, 6.6 mmol), and the mixture was stirred under nitrogen atmosphere for 2 hours at 120 Â°C. The reaction mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate after addition of water. The organic layer was washed with water and saturated brine, and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. After concentration, the resulting residue was purified by DNH silica gel chromatography (hexane-ethyl acetate) to yield Compound 23 (140 mg, yield 38%). MS(ESI) m/z : 446 [M+H]+
