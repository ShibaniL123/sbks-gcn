The present invention relates to new, distinct, and stable cultivars of double-type Kalanchoe interspecific hybrids that produce one or more flowers with at least 5 full or partial petals per flower. The double-type Kalanchoe interspecific hybrids of the present invention include Kalanchoe blossfeldiana x K. laciniata. The double-type Kalanchoe interspecific hybrids of the present invention also include double-type plants produced from crosses between the above-identified interspecific hybrids (e.g. (K. blossfeldiana x K. laciniata) x (K. blossfeldiana x K. pubescens)). as well as, crosses between interspecific hybrids containing K. blossfeldiana and interspecific hybrids not containing K. blossfeldiana in the genetic background (e.g. (K. blossfeldiana x K. laciniata) x (K. grandiflora x K. pritwitzii)). The double-type interspecific hybrid plants produce one or more flowers having at least 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, or more than 40 petals per flower. The double-type characteristic has been successfully introgressed from double-type K. blossfeldiana into other single-type (4 petals per flower) Kalanchoe species. The double-type interspecific hybrid plants can be used as either male or female parents in crosses to the parents, other selections from the same species as the parents, or selections from other Kalanchoe species. The double-type interspecific hybrid plants can also be selfed. The double-type flowering characteristic from K. blossfeldiana has been combined with many desirable traits from other Kalanchoe species including different flower colors, superior growth characteristics and improved plant habit. Methods for the reliable breeding of the double-type characteristic from K. blossfeldiana, or Kalanchoe interspecific hybrid plants, into diverse single-type Kalanchoe genetic backgrounds, as well as methods for increasing the number of petals per flower, are disclosed. The present invention relates generally to the field of ornamental Kalanchoe plants. The genus of Kalanchoe belongs to the sedum family (Crassulaceae). There are more than 100 different species of Kalanchoe of which more than 60 are found in Madagascar. Many species are found in South Africa and a few in Asia and South America. Kalanchoe belongs to the succulent plant group, which are characterized by their turgid leaves. The leaves enable members of this genus to survive drought conditions. Consequently, Kalanchoe are useful ornamental plants because they can survive in less than optimal growing conditions. Species of Kalanchoe are described in J.T. Baldwin, Amer. J. Bot. 25: 572-579 (1938). Each species of Kalanchoe has traits a breeder would like to incorporate into commercial cultivars. Other traits a breeder will try to avoid. K. blossfeldiana is a valuable ornamental species because it can be readily grown from seed, or reproduced asexually from cuttings, and produces abundant flowers that remain fresh for several weeks. Generally, K. blossfeldiana plants are highly branched and under certain conditions the height of the branches may be up to 30-45 cm. K. blossfeldiana plants generally produce erect flowers, oblong or ovate-oblong leaves, with a corolla that is red. The breeding of Kalanchoe interspecific hybrids with double-type, rose-like flowers, with at least 35 petals per flower, offers a unique flower form that can be combined with diverse Kalanchoe plant characteristics from different species, thereby expanding the range of phenotypic characteristics available in this popular horticultural plant. A chromosomical characterization of Kalanchoe blossfeldiana and different interspecific fertile hybrids having K. blossfeldiana as one of the parental lines are described in A. van Voorst and J.C. Arends, Euphytica 31:573r584 (19812). SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION An object of the present invention is to provide a Kalanchoe interspecific hybrid plant or progeny thereof according to claim 1 having one or more double-type flowers with at least 35 full or partial petals per flower. Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a kalanchoe interspecific hybrid plant or progeny thereof in which substantially all the flowers produced by the plant are double-type with at least 35 full or partial petal per flower.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION: As used herein, "single", or "single-flowering", or "single-type" are each defined as the typical Kalanchoe plant which produces flowers having 4 petals per flower. As used herein, "double", "double-flowering", or "double-type" are each defined as a Kalanchoe interspecific hybrid plant which produces one or more flowers having at least 5 full or partial petals per flower. Preferably, the double-type Kalanchoe interspecific hybrid plant of the instant invention has substantially all double-type flowers. The double-type flowers of the instant invention have 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, or more than 40 petals per flower. A double-type Kalonchoe interspecific hybrid plant of the instant invention may produce flowers with a relatively uniform number of petals per flower and this characteristic is stable through asexual reproduction. Alternatively, a double-type Kalanchoe interspecific hybrid plant of the instant invention may produce flowers with a wide range in the number of petals per flower and this characteristic is also stable through asexual reproduction. As used herein, the "degree of doubleness per flower" is defined as a measure of the number of extra full or partial petals per flower produced beyond the number 4 normally found on Kalanchoe single-type plant. The greater the degree of doubleness per flower, the greater the number of full or partial petals produced per flower. As used herein "the degree of doubleness per plant" is defined as a measure of the number of flowers per plant, which have at least 5 petals per flower. The greater the degree of doubleness per plant, the higher is the percentage of total flowers produced by the plant which have at least 5 full or partial petals per flower. As used herein, "interspecific hybrid" includes the progeny from the cross of two different species of Kalanchoe, as well as progeny resulting from subsequent backcrossing to one of the parents. This backcrossing to one of the parents may be conducted one or more times with the goal of stably combining the double-type trait with desired characteristics. K. blossfeldiana is crossed with K. laciniata to combine advantageous characteristics into unique new cultivars. Advantageous traits obtained from K. laciniata plants include: 1) intense yellow coloration of flower 2) entire, sinuate or parted leaf, 3) shinning texture of leaf 4) good fixation of the leaf to the stem, 5) production of many cuttings and 6) vigorous rooting habit. Traits from K. laciniata that should be avoided in a breeding program include 1) long length of stem, 2) fast and unstable growth habit and 3) poor post-production longevity. K. blossfeldiana x K. laciniata interspecific hybrids typically have leaves that are entire, sinuate or parted with erect and large flowers that are white, pink, purple, yellow, orange, and red. K. blossfeldiana x K. laciniata interspecific hybrids are highly branched, relatively compact and under certain conditions the height of the branches may be up to 30-45 cm. (K. blossfeldiana x K. laciniata) x. (K. blossfeldiana x. K. pubescens) double type interspecific hybrids typically have ovate, as well as, hastate leaves. (K. blossfeldiana x K. laciniata) x. (K. blossfeldiana x. K. pubescens) interspecific hybrids are upright and have s uniform growth habit, and under certain conditions, the height of the branches may be up to 26 cm. Double-type Kalanchoe interspecific hybrid cultivars are genetically stable, as evidenced by the stability of the double-type trait through both asexual propagation and sexual crosses. The data from numerous crosses with K. blossfeldiana indicate that the double-type trait segregates as a single dominant gene. The double-type trait can be reproducibly and predictably introgressed into diverse Kalanchoe species and genetic backgrounds. K. blossfeldiana seeds designated 'MP African' that produce plants carrying the double-type gene or trait, and which can be used as a male or female parent in crosses with Kalanchoe species to produce double-type Kalanchoe interspecific hybrid cultivars, were deposited at the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), P.O. Box 1549, Manassas, VA 20108, U.S.A. As a first step in making interspecific hybrids of the instant invention, a single or double-type Kalanchoe plant selection is crossed with a single-type Kalanchoe selection from another species. Progeny are screened for fertile selections. Large numbers of progeny may have to be screened to identify fertile selections. The fertile selections may be screened for those exhibiting the double-type flower trait if one of the parents was a double-type selection. Alternatively, the single-type fertile interspecific hybrid is crossed, either as the male or female parent, with a double-type Kalanchoe selection. A double-type hybrid progeny plant with desirable phenotypic characteristics is propagated asexually by conventional methods to determine if the phenotypic characteristics are stable. For example, a K. blossfeldiana (tetraploid) x. K. laciniata (diploid) interspecific hybrid is by nature triploid and thus sterile. K. blossfeldiana x K. laciniata interspecific hybrid progeny plants were screened and 'Yellow African', described in U.S. Plant Patent No. 12,299, was identified. This fertile K. blossfeldiana x K. laciniata interspecific hybrid has been used to breed a series of interspecific hybrid cultivars. Recurrent selection is used to increase the number of petals per flower found in the Kalanchoe interspecific hybrid plants of the instant invention. A double-type Kalanchoe interspecific hybrid plant is selfed, or crossed to another double-type Kalanchoe plant; and the progeny screened for plants with double-type flowers with an increased number of petals per flower compared to the double-type parents. 1. General Breeding Methods The Kolanchoe plants of the instant invention were crossed as follows. When the pistil is-fully developed and the anthers have not opened, the pistil is to some extent uncovered. During this time the stigma is susceptible to pollination. Pollen is harvested from the male using a pencil or small brush and transferred to the stigma. Once pollination is complete, the seeds develop within the ovary and the pistils are harvested when ripe. The seeds are dried before sowing in peat-based soil mix. Breeding with double-type K. blossfeldiana requires careful uncovering of the pistil. It is very easy to wound the ovary and thereby hinder germination and development of seeds. In addition, if the female parent is water-stressed during pollination and subsequent seed development, the number of seeds obtained appear to increase. 2. Plant Growth Conditions The Kalanchoe plants described herein were grown in a greenhouse at 64.4 °F during the day and 68°F during the night. The plants were produced in pots with a diameter of 10.5 cm or 13 cm. Cuttings were grown under long-day conditions (16 hours light, 8 hours night) during the first 3-8 weeks following planting, depending on cultivar and pot size. Between 4-9 weeks after planting, the plants were transferred to , short-day conditions (10 hour light and 14 hour dark). The flowering is induced by short-day conditions. Between 13-19 weeks after planting, depending on cultivar, pot size, and time of year, the plants were mature with flowers that were opening or about to open. The plants were grown under natural light conditions supplemented with 70 µmol/m2/s SON-T light when the natural light was less than 100 µmol/m2/s. Plants were grown in a peat based soil mix and were watered with a solution containing 200 parts per million (ppm) nitrogen, 200 ppm potassium, 40 ppm phosphorous, 200 ppm calcium, 40 ppm magnesium, 60 ppm sulphate, 1 ppm iron, 0.6 ppm manganese, 0.1 ppm copper, 0.1 ppm zinc, 0.3 ppm borium, 0.03 ppm molybdenum. The following examples are set forth as representative of the specific and preferred embodiments of the present invention. These examples are not to be construed as limiting the scope of the invention in any manner. EXAMPLE 1 The data from numerous crosses with K. blossfeldiana indicate that the double-type trait segregates as a single dominant gene. A total of 9,787. progeny from crosses of K. blossfeldiana double-type x K. blossfeldiana single-type have been analyzed. Among these 9,787 progeny, 2,956 exhibited the double-type trait. Seeds carrying the double-type trait germinate at a lower frequency than seeds carrying the single-type trait. This lower germination frequency has probably impacted the segregation pattern which is not the 1:1 ratio expected for a trait controlled by a single dominant gene. Regardless of what the genetic basis for control of the double-type trait in Kalanchoe might be, these data demonstrate the double-type trait can be reproducibly and predictably introgressed into diverse Kalanchoe genetic backgrounds. EXAMPLE 2 CULTIVAR 'KJ 2003 0818' The new K. blossfeldiana x. K. laciniata interspecific hybrid 'KJ 2003 0818' was produced using 1) a K. blossfeldiana double-type selection designated 'Leonardo', as the female parent, and is described in pending United States Plant Patent Number PP13,365, and 2) a proprietary single-type selection of K. blossfeldiana x K. laciniata interspecific hybrid 'KJ 1998-469', unpatented. The new Kalanchoe cultivar 'KJ 2003 0818' was discovered and selected as a flowering plant within the progeny of the stated cross in a controlled environment in Hinnerup, Denmark. Asexual reproduction of the new cultivar by vegetative terminal cuttings was first performed in April, 2004, in Hinnerup, Denmark, and has demonstrated that the combination of characteristics as herein disclosed for the new cultivar are firmly fixed and retained through successive generations of asexual reproduction. The new cultivar reproduces true-to-type through asexual reproduction. The following traits have been repeatedly observed and are determined to be unique characteristics of the new Kalanchoe cultivar 'KJ 2003 0818' which in combination distinguish this Kalanchoe as a new and distinct cultivar: 1. a large number of petals per flower resulting in a double-type or multi-petalled trait;2. the large size of petals resulting in a large flower;3. a unique soft pink color with a touch of yellow; and4. a large number of flowers per plant. The new Kalanchoe cultivar 'KJ 2003 0818' has not been observed under all possible environmental conditions. The phenotype of the new cultivar may vary significantly with variations in environment such as temperature, light intensity, and day length without any change in the genotype of the plant. The following Observations, measurements and values describe the new Kalanchoe cultivar 'KJ 2003 01818' as grown in Hinnerup, Denmark under conditions which closely approximate those generally used in commercial practice. Plants of 'KJ 2003 0818' differ from plants of the parental cultivars in the following characteristics: TraitNew CultivarFemale ParentMale Parent'KJ 2003 0818''Leonardo' (patented, PP13,365)'KJ 1998-469' (unpatented)Height of cultivarIs about 25 cmIs about 30 cmIs about 33 cmFlower TypeDouble-typeDouble-typeSingle-typeFlower Diameter20-24 mm15-17 mm20-25 mmFlower number250-350250-300350-400Number of Corolla LobesUp to 43 full or partial petalsBetween 18-25 full or partial petals4 petalsCorolla ColorationRed-purple.Red-purple.Red-purple.Summer coloration: Center of the flower corolla is 65 A.
