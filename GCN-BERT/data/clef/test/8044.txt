73881 7 This invention relates to a dua1 /type of oil filter' ín which part of the flow is through a surface filter element such as pleated paper and the rest of the flow is through a depth filter element such as a thick fíbrous mass. More particularly the present invention resides in an oil filter comprising a shell having housed therein a pleated filter element in the shape of a cylinder having a central liquid passage open at one end; and in the other end of such passage is mounted a thick fibrous filter plug. This dual filter media is simple and inexpensive in construction, as the plug is easily mounted in an end portion of the central bore of the pleated filter element. When so mounted the plug is out of the way and conserves space, and this plug performs an important function which will now be described. It is known that the effective life of a pleated paper filter element depends largely upon whether or not during the early operation of such paper a porous filter cake is formed on its upstream surface. If such porous cake is formed before the pores of the paper become seriously plugged, the lire of the paper filter will be greatly i increased. This is because such porous cake makes an excellent filter and prevents small dirt particles, that would plug the pores of the paperjfrom reaching such pores. Anything that can be done to promote the early formation of a porous filter cake on the surface of the filter paper will greatly increase its filtering life. ï i•i i0 The dual type of filter media above briefly described serves in a highly satisfactory manner to promote the formation of such porous filter cake, and thereby increase the operating life of the filter media. The dual filter media of the present inventioh has been repeatedly tested and is found to have high efficiency and long life as compared with pleated paper alone or with other commercial type of filters now being extensively used. The present filter possesses to a substantial degree the following desirable properties: low restriction, high capacity, and high efficiency. These desirable features result from the fact that in accordance with the present invention a pleated paper element is used that is sufficiently porous to pass, when clean, the major portion or practically all of the oil flow supplied to the filter shell, while only a minor portion of such oil flow passes through the fibrous plug. As dirt accumulates in the pores of the paper, the proportion of the total flow that goes through the plug will increase to modify the pressure built up on the paper. The effect of this is to promote the formation of the desired porous filter cake on the surface of the filter paper. Without such plug, which acts as a partial bypass, the increase in oil pressure against the paper, as dirt lodges in the pores thereof, would pack down the forming cake to render it substantially nonporous. By modifying such pressure build up through the use of such plug, a highly desirable porous cake is quickly formed to increase the filtering lire of the paper. By employing a pleated paper filter element having the above described filter plug associated therewith to relieve the oÆl pressure build up against the paper, it is feasible to use in a full-flow filter a 7BB81 7 high efficiency full-flow paper having sufficiently small pores to remove contamination. This is a departure from the usual practice of employing a very open paper as the full-flow element to prevent early plugging of the paper. The percentage of oil that passes through the plug when clean and as dirt accumulates therein will depend upon the relative porosity of the paper and PlUg. Also it will depend upon the porosity of the plug, its diameter and its thickness; but its maximum diameter is limited by the diameter of the bore of the center tube of the pleated paper, and the thickness of the plug is limited by the length of the center tube it is considered desirable for the plug to occupy. Therefore the porosity of such plug will depend largely upon the size of the fibers forming such plug and their degree of compactness in the plug. The fibers forming such plug are preferably bonded one to the other at their contacting points, and this fibrous mass is preferably molded into a relatively rigid plug. The above and other features of the present invention will be further understood from the following description when read in connection with the acc0mpanying drawing, wherein: Fig. 1 is a side elevation with parts in section of a full-flow throw-away type of oil filter embodying the filter media of the present invention. Fig. 2 on a larger scale is a vertical sectional vìew through the upper portion of the •parts shown in Fig. 1; and Fig. 3 is a perspective view of the porous filter plug shown in Figs. 1 and 2. "3i0 3381 7 The novel features of the present invention may be employed in various types of oil filters but are designed more particularly for use in a full-flow throw-away type of oil filter of the general construction shown in/3. S. Patent No. 2,888,141 which is assigned to the assignee of the present application. In such patent a relíef valve is shown at the upper, end of the oil filter away from the oil inlet and outlet. In the cõnstruction of the present application the relief valve, if provided, is mounted at the opposite end of the filter near the oil inlet and outlet. This is. desirable in the construction shown because the filter plug .forming an important part of the present invention is located at the upper end of the filter element away from the oil inlet and outlet. The filter shell or housing in which the dual filter media is mounted may be variously constructed but is shown as comprising a cup-shaped housing i0 having the closed upper end I0', and secured to the lower end of such shell is the reinforcing plate 11 having a central Opening 12 which is internally threaded as shown. This allows the filter to be readily screwed onto a supporting post such as shown in the patent above cited. To. the lower end of the cup-shaped shell fs secured by a rolled seam the end plate 13 and this end plate is , shown as having a reversely bent annular flange 14 which serves to retain the sealing gasket 15 in place. The relief valve employed in the Construction so far described may be variously formed but as here shown comprises the cupped . member 16 having at its lower end an outwardly extending flange which is supported by the reinforcing plate 11. Resting oN the inner face of the plate 11 is the anti-drain valve 17 comprising a thin '8381 7 rubber disc normally held in its closed position by a weak spríng. The cupped member 16 has formed in its upper face two laterally spaced openings. One such opening designated by 18 permits the filtered oil to pass out of the filter housing in the direction indicated by the arrows. The other passage 19 is normally closed by the relief valve comprising the closure disc 20 normally held in its closed position by a coiled spring 21, which is housed in the metal yoke 22. A space is provided below the closure disc 20 so that the unfiltered oil can press against this disc and force it open if the dual filter media becomes plugged with dirt. The filter construction so far described forms no essential part of the present invention and maybe varied as desired. The dual filter media forming the subject matter of the present invention comprises an annular pleated filter element 23 formed of a porous sheet material, but is preferably formed Of resin-treated porous paper, the pDres of which are sufficiently small to do a good filtering job, Aas long as they are clean-up pass the entire or most of the full flow of oil supplied to the filter housing 10. This pleated filter element 9.3 has adhesively bonded to the upper ends of the pleats a metal or paper cap 24, and similarly bonded to the lower end of the pleats is the paper or metal cap 25. Within the central opening of the pleated paper filter element 23is provided the usual perforated center tube 26. This tube is shown as having the circular corrugations or wave s to stiffen the same. These waves extend the entire length of the tube 26, and the upper portion of this tube which receives the filter plug to be described may or may not be perforated. This tube is provided at some distance from the upper end thereof with the i0 73381 7 internally bent tabs 27, three such tabs being sufficient. These tabs serve to support a perforated metal disc 28 the upper face of which is preferably covered with fabric such as a gauze disc 29. Within the upper end of the metal reinforcing tube 26 is mounted a molded fibrous filter plug 30. In the construction shown the diameter of this plug is reduced at its upper end as indicated by 31. The major diameter of this filter plug 30 is such that it can be easily inserted in the bore of the center tube 26 to rest upon the gauze disc 29 and supporting disc 28. The gauze 29 is provided to prevent migration of loose fibers from the plug 30. It is important to prevent oil from passing downwardly in the metal tube 26 between the inner face of this tube and the outer wall of the plug 30. To accomplish this, a tight seal is provided at the upper end of such plug. This seal is formed by providing a ring member 32 which, as will be apparent from Figure 2, is U-shaped in cross section. This member 32 has the annular outer flange 33 which rests upon and sealingly engages the upper end cap 2 when this ring member 32 is in place. The inner wall of this ring member is of a size to snugly embrace the upper end portion 31 of the filter plug 30, so that oil will not pass this ring member to enter the center tube 26. It is important to maintain a continuous downward pressure on the entire filter assembly to retain the cupped member 16 above described in firm sealing engagement with the gasket 17 resting upon the reinforcing plate ii at the end of the filter housing. This is accomplished in the construction shown by providing the coiled spring 34, the lower end of which is seated in the U-shaped portion of the ring 32, and the upper end of this spring rests against the inner face of the upper end wall I0' of the metal housing i0. !i, 73381 7 The pleated filter element 23 is preferably formed of resin treated paper having fine enough pores to do a good filtering job but which pores are sufficiently open to pass the entire or most of the full flow of oil entering the filter as long as such paper is clean. Therefore this pleated paper element may be described as a high efficiency full-flow paper. The plug 30 mounted in/the upper end portion of the bore of the pleatedpaper element may be variously constructed but is preferably formed of textile fibers such as viscose rayon fibers from one to several inches long. These fibers are preferably bonded one to the other at their contacting points and the fibrous mass is preferably molded into a relatively firm plug, the upper end of which as above stated is tightly embraced by the ring member 32. Having described the preferred embodiment of the present invention the operation of the dual filter media or cartridge forming the subject matter of the present invention will now be described. The oil to be filtered in the construction shown enters the filter shell 10 through the openings 35 formed in the heavy reinforcing plate 11 so that this oil may flow upwardly around the outer face of the pleated filter element 23 to pass inwardly through this filter element and enter the bore of the center tube 26. If then passes downwardly in this center tube as indicated by the arrows to pass out of the filter housing through the central opening 12 of the heavy reinforcing plate. As long as the pleated filter element is relatively clean» most of the oil will pass through the same» but as the pores of this paper begin to fill with dirt more and more oil will pass downwardly through the fibrous filter plug 30. The construction is such that both the pleated paper and plug 30 do a good dirt-removing Job. i0 7.8381 7 As above pointed out the life of the pleated filter paper, the pores of which are sufficiently small to do a good filtering job, will be greatly extended if a porous filter cake forms on the upstream surface of this paper before the pores of the paper become seriously plugged. The primary purpose of the filter plug 30 is to act somewhat as a relief valve or bypass valve to modify the oil pressure build up against the pleated paper as dirt accumulates in the pores of such paper. This modifying of the pressure build up against the paper facilitates the formation of a porous filter cake on the upstream face of the paper. If the filter plug 30 were not employed, the more rapid build up of pressure against the pleated paper would cause the forming filter cake to pack down to such an extent that it would be substantially nonporous and this would shorten the filtering life of the pleated paper. While the construction of the present invention is shown and described as embodied in the screw-on throw-away type of filter housing having the oil inlet and outlet at the same end thereof, it is desired to point out that the dual filter element or cartridge of the present invention may be employed in various types of filter housìngs. It will be seen from the foregoing that by employing the filter plug 30 which is readily mounted in an end portion of the bore of the pleated cartridge a simple and inexpensive construction is produced; and, due to the operation of the filter plug to lessen the pressure build up against the pleated filter paper, a porous filter cake has a good chance of forming on the surface of the pleated paper. This porous filter cake, as above pointed out, will greatly increase the filtering life of the pleated filter paper.
