Example 3
5'-fluoro-N-(1-methyl-3-(pyridin-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)-[2,3'-bipyridine]-6-carboxamide (I-3)
A 1,4-dioxane (3 mL) solution of 6-bromo-N-(1-methyl-3-(pyridin-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)picolinamide (71.6 mg, 0.2 mmol), (5-fluoropyridin-3-yl)boronic acid (42.3 mg, 0.3 mmol), Pd(PPh3)4(23.1 mg, 0.02 mmol), and 2M aqueous solution of Na2CO3 (0.3 mL, 0.6 mmol) was microwaved at 150Â° C. for 60 minutes. Solvent was removed in vacuo, and after silica gel chromatography; 5'-fluoro-N-(1-methyl-3-(pyridin-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)-[2,3'-bipyridine]-6-carboxamide was obtained as a light grey solid: 328.8 mg (88% yield);
