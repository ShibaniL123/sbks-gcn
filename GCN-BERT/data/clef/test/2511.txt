Field of the Invention The present invention relates generally to a process for the production of ethanol from acetic acid. More specifically, the present invention relates to a process including hydrogenating acetic acid utilizing a catalyst composed of cobalt supported on a suitable catalyst support containing one or more metals to form ethanol with high selectivity. Background There is a long felt need for an economically viable process to convert acetic acid to ethanol. Ethanol is an important commodity feedstock for a variety of industrial products and is also used as a fuel additive with gasoline. Ethanol can readily be dehydrated to ethylene, which can then be converted to a variety of products, both polymeric and small molecule-based. Ethanol is conventionally produced from feedstocks where price fluctuations are becoming more significant. That is, fluctuating natural gas and crude oil prices contribute to fluctuations in the cost of conventionally produced, petroleum, natural gas or corn or other agricultural product-sourced ethanol, making the need for alternative sources of ethanol all the greater when oil prices and/or agricultural product prices rise. It has been reported that ethanol can be produced from the hydrogenation of acetic acid, but most of these processes feature several drawbacks for a commercial operation. For instance, United States Patent No. 2,607,807 discloses that ethanol can be formed from acetic acid over a ruthenium catalyst at extremely high pressures of 700-950 bars in order to achieve yields of around 88%, whereas low yields of only about 40% are obtained at pressures of about 200 bar. Nevertheless, both of these conditions are unacceptable and uneconomical for a commercial operation. More recently, it has been reported that ethanol can be produced from hydrogenating acetic acid using a cobalt catalyst again at superatmospheric pressures such as about 40 to 120 bar. See, for example, United States Patent No. 4,517,391 to Shuster et al. However, the only example disclosed therein employs reaction pressure in the range of about 300 bar still making this process undesirable for a commercial operation. In addition, the process calls for a catalyst containing no less than 50 percent cobalt by weight plus one or more members selected from the group consisting of copper, manganese, molybdenum, chromium, and phosphoric acid, thus rendering the process economically non-viable. Although there is a disclosure of use of simple inert catalyst carriers to support the catalyst materials, there is no specific example of supported metal catalysts. United States Patent No. 5,149,680 to Kitson et al. describes a process for the catalytic hydrogenation of carboxylic acids and their anhydrides to alcohols and/or esters utilizing a platinum group metal alloy catalysts. The catalyst is comprised of an alloy of at least one noble metal of group VIII of the Periodic Table and at least one metal capable of alloying with the group VIII noble metal, admixed with a component comprising at least one of the metals rhenium, tungsten or molybdenum. Although it has been claimed therein that improved selectivity to alcohols are achieved over the prior art references it was still reported that 3 to 9 percent of alkanes, such as methane and ethane are formed as by-products during the hydrogenation of acetic acid to ethanol under their optimal catalyst conditions. United States Patent No. 4,777,303 to Kitson et al. describes a process for the productions of alcohols by the hydrogenation of carboxylic acids. The catalyst used in this case is a heterogeneous catalyst comprising a first component which is either molybdenum or tungsten and a second component which is a noble metal of Group VIII of the Periodic Table of the elements, optionally on a support, for example, a high surface area graphitized carbon. The selectivity to a combined mixture of alcohol and ester is reported to be only in the range of about 73 to 87 percent with low conversion of carboxylic acids at about 16 to 58 percent. In addition, no specific example of conversion of acetic acid to ethanol is provided. United States Patent No. 4,804,791 to Kitson et al. describes another process for the productions of alcohols by the hydrogenation of carboxylic acids. In this process, ethanol is produced from acetic acid or propanol is produced from propionic acid by contacting either acetic acid or propionic acid in the vapor phase with hydrogen at elevated temperature and a pressure in the range from 1 to 150 bar in the presence of a catalyst comprising as essential components (i) a noble metal of Group VIII of the Periodic Table of the elements, and (ii) rhenium, optionally on a support, for example a high surface area graphitized carbon. The conversion of acetic acid to ethanol ranged from 0.6 % to 69% with selectivity to ethanol was in the range of about 6% to 97%. From the foregoing it is apparent that existing processes do not have the requisite selectivity to ethanol or existing art employs catalysts, which are expensive and/or non-selective for the formation of ethanol and produces undesirable by-products. Summary of the Invention It has now been unexpectedly found that ethanol can be made on an industrial scale directly from acetic acid with high selectivity and yield. More particularly, this invention provides a process for the selective formation of ethanol from acetic acid comprising: hydrogenating acetic acid over a suitable hydrogenating catalyst in the presence of hydrogen. The catalyst suitable for the process of this invention is comprised of 0.1 weight percent to 20 weight percent of cobalt supported on a suitable catalyst support in combination with one or more metal catalysts selected from the group consisting of palladium, platinum and chromium. Suitable catalyst supports include silica, alumina, calcium silicate, silica-alumina, carbon, zirconia and titania. Detailed Description of the Invention The invention is described in detail below with reference to numerous embodiments for purposes of exemplification and illustration only. Unless more specifically defined below, terminology as used herein is given its ordinary meaning. Mole percent (mole % or %) refer to mole percent unless otherwise indicated. Weight percent (wt % or %) refer to weight percent unless otherwise indicated. "Conversion" is expressed as a mole percentage based on acetic acid in the feed. The conversion of acetic acid (AcOH) is calculated from gas chromatography (GC) data using the following equation: AcOH conversion%=100*mmol AcOH infeed stream-mmol AcOH outGCmmol AcOH infeed stream "Selectivity" is expressed as a mole percent based on converted acetic acid. For example, if the conversion is 50 mole % and 50 mole % of the converted acetic acid is converted to ethanol, we refer to the ethanol selectivity as 50%. Selectivity to ethanol (EtOH)is calculated from gas chromatography (GC) data using the following equation: Selectivity to EtOH%=100*mmol EtOH outGCTotal mmol C outGC2-mmol AcOH outGC Weight percent of a catalyst metal is based on metal weight and the total dry weight of metal and support. The reaction proceeds in accordance with the following chemical equation: In accordance with the invention, conversion of acetic acid to ethanol can be carried out in a variety of configurations, such as for example in a single reaction zone which may be a layered fixed bed, if so desired. An adiabatic reactor could be used, or a shell and tube reactor provided with a heat transfer medium could be used. The fixed bed can comprise a mixture of different catalyst particles or catalyst particles which include multiple catalysts as further described herein. The fixed bed may also include a layer of particulate material making up a mixing zone for the reactants. A reaction mixture including acetic acid, hydrogen and optionally an inert carrier gas is fed to the bed as a stream under pressure to the mixing zone. The stream is subsequently supplied (by way of pressure drop) to the reaction zone or layer. Reaction zone comprises a catalytic composition including a suitable hydrogenating catalyst where acetic acid is hydrogenated to produce ethanol. Any suitable particle size may be used depending upon the type of reactor, throughput requirements and so forth. Although various hydrogenating catalysts known to one skilled in the art can be employed in hydrogenating acetic acid to form ethanol in the process of this invention the hydrogenating catalyst employed contains 0.1 weight percent to 20 weight percent of cobalt on a suitable catalyst support. As noted earlier, it contains as second metal supported on the same catalyst support either palladium, platinum or chromium. Various catalyst supports known in the art can be used to support the catalysts of this invention. Examples of such supports include zeolite, iron oxide, silica, alumina, titania, zirconia, silica-alumina, magnesium oxide, calcium silicate, carbon, graphite and a mixture thereof. Preferred supports are silica, alumina, calcium silicate, carbon, zirconia and titania. More preferably silica is used as a catalyst support in the process of this invention. It is also important to note that higher the purity of silica better it is preferred as a support in this invention. Another preferred catalyst support is calcium silicate. In another embodiment of this invention the preferred catalyst support is carbon. Various forms of carbon known in the art that are suitable as catalyst support can be used in the process of this invention. Particularly preferred carbon support is a graphitized carbon, particularly the high surface area graphitized carbon as described in Great Britain Patent No. 2,136,704. The carbon is preferably in particulate form, for example, as pellets. The size of the carbon particles will depend on the pressure drop acceptable in any given reactor (which gives a minimum pellet size) and reactant diffusion constraint within the pellet (which gives a maximum pellet size). The carbon catalyst supports that are suitable in the process of this invention preferably porous carbon catalyst supports. With the preferred particle sizes the carbon will need to be porous to meet the preferred surface area characteristics. The catalyst supports including the carbon catalyst supports may be characterized by their BET, basal plane, and edge surface areas. The BET surface area is the surface area determined by nitrogen adsorption using the method of Brunauer Emmett and Teller J. Am. Chem. Soc. 60,309 (1938). The basal plane surface area is the surface area determined from the heat of adsorption on the carbon of n-dotriacontane from n-heptane by the method described in Proc. Roy. Soc. A314 pages 473-498, with particular reference to page 489. The edge surface area is the surface area determined from the heat of adsorption on the carbon of n-butanol from n-heptane as disclosed in the Proc. Roy. Soc. article mentioned above with particular reference to page 495. The preferred carbon catalyst supports for use in the present invention have a BET surface area of at least 100 m2/g, more preferably at least 200 m2/g, most preferably at least 300 m2 /g. The BET surface area is preferably not greater than 1000 m2/g, more preferably not greater than 750 m2/g. The preferred carbon support may be prepared by heat treating a carbon-containing starting material. The starting material may be an oleophillic graphite e.g. prepared as disclosed in Great Britain Patent No. 1,168,785 or may be a carbon black. However, oleophillic graphites contain carbon in the form of very fine particles in flake form and are therefore not very suitable materials for use as catalyst supports. We prefer to avoid their use. Similar considerations apply to carbon blacks which also have a very fine particle size. The preferred materials are activated carbons derived from vegetable materials e.g. coconut charcoal, or from peat or coal or from carbonizable polymers. The materials subjected to the heat treatment preferably have particle sizes not less than these indicated above as being preferred for the carbon support. The preferred starting materials have the following characteristics: BET surface area of at least 100, more preferably at least 500 m2/g. The preferred heat treatment procedure for preparing carbon supports having the defined characteristics, comprise successively (1) heating the carbon in an inert atmosphere at a temperature of from 900°C to 3300°C, (2) oxidizing the carbon at a temperature between 300°C and 1200°C, (3) heating in an inert atmosphere at a temperature of between 900°C and 3000°C. The oxidation step is preferably carried out at temperatures between 300° and 600°C when oxygen (e.g. as air) is used as the oxidizing agent. The duration of the heating in inert gas is not critical. The time needed to heat the carbon to the required maximum temperature is sufficient to produce the required changes in the carbon. The oxidation step must clearly not be carried out under conditions such that the carbon combusts completely. It is preferably carried out using a gaseous oxidizing agent fed at a controlled rate to avoid over oxidation. Examples of gaseous oxidizing agents are steam, carbon dioxide, and gases containing molecular oxygen e.g. air. The oxidation is preferably carried out to give a carbon weight loss of at least 10 weight percent based on weight of carbon subjected to the oxidation step, more preferably at least 15 weight percent. The weight loss is preferably not greater than 40 weight percent of the carbon subjected to the oxidation step, more preferably not greater than 25 weight percent of the carbon. The rate of supply of oxidizing agent is preferably such that the desired weight loss takes place over at least 2 hours, more preferably at least 4 hours. Where an inert atmosphere is required it may be supplied by nitrogen or an inert gas. As noted above, the loading levels of cobalt on the catalyst support is in the range of 0.1 weight percent to 20 weight percent. The amount of second metal loading on a support is not very critical in this invention and can vary in the range of 0.1 weight percent to 10 weight percent. A metal loading of about 1 weight percent to 6 weight percent based on the weight of the support is particularly preferred. Thus, for example 0.5 to 2 weight percent of palladium supported on graphite which contains 4 to 12 weight percent of cobalt is particularly a preferred catalyst. Similarly, a catalyst containing 0.5 to 2 weight percent of platinum supported on high purity silica which contains 4 to 12 weight percent of cobalt is also a preferred catalyst. Thus for a cobalt loading of 4 to 12 weight percent the second metal, i.e., chromium loading of 0.5 to 2 weight percent are preferred. The metal impregnation can be carried out using any of the known methods in the art. Typically, before impregnation the supports are dried at 120°C and shaped to particles having size distribution in the range of about 0.2 to 0.4 mm. Optionally the supports may be pressed, crushed and sieved to a desired size distribution. Any of the known methods to shape the support materials into desired size distribution can be employed. For supports having low surface area, such as for example alpha-alumina, the metal solutions are added in excess until complete wetness or excess liquid impregnation so as to obtain desirable metal loadings. As noted above, the hydrogenation catalysts used in the process of this invention are a bimetallic having cobalt as the main metal. Generally, without intending to be bound by any theory, it is believed that one metal acts as a promoter metal and the other metal is the main metal. For instance, in the instant process of the invention, cobalt is considered to be main metal for preparing hydrogenation catalysts of this invention. The main metal can be combined with a promoter metal such as chromium. However, it should be noted that sometimes main metal can also act as a promoter metal or vice versa. The bimetallic catalysts are generally impregnated in two steps. First, the "promoter" metal is added, followed by "main" metal. Each impregnation step is followed by drying and calcination. The bimetallic catalysts may also be prepared by co-impregnation. Each impregnation is followed by drying and calcinations. In most cases, the impregnation may be carried out using metal nitrate solutions. However, various other soluble salts which upon calcination releases metal ions can also be used. Examples of other suitable metal salts for impregnation include metal hydroxide, metal oxide, metal acetate, ammonium metal oxide, such as ammonium heptamolybdate hexahydrate, metal acids, such as perrhenic acid solution, metal oxalate. Thus in one embodiment of this invention, there is provided a hydrogenation catalyst wherein the catalyst support is graphite with a bimetallic loading of cobalt and palladium. In this aspect of the invention, the loading of cobalt is ten (10) weight percent and the loading of palladium is one (1) weight percent. A loading level of cobalt at five (5) weight percent and loading level of palladium at 0.5 weight percent can also be employed if so desired. In another embodiment of this invention, there is further provided a hydrogenation catalyst wherein the catalyst support is high purity silica with a bimetallic loading of cobalt and platinum. In this aspect of the invention, the loading of cobalt is ten (10) weight percent and the loading of platinum is one (1) weight percent. Again in this aspect of the invention, loading levels of cobalt at five (5) weight percent and loading levels of platinum at 0.5 weight percent can also be employed. In general, by the practice of this invention acetic acid can selectivity be converted to ethanol at very high rates. The selectivity to ethanol in general is very high and may be at least 40 percent. Under preferred reaction conditions, acetic acid is selectively converted to ethanol at a selectivity of 60 percent or more preferably at a selectivity of at least 80 percent. Most preferably ethanol selectivity is at least 95 percent. In another aspect of the process of this invention, the hydrogenation is carried out at a pressure just sufficient to overcome the pressure drop across the catalytic bed. The reaction is carried out in the vapor phase. Reaction temperatures are in the range of 200°C to 300°C, preferably 225°C to 275° C. The pressure is generally uncritical to the reaction and subatmospheric, atmospheric or superatmospheric pressures may be employed. In most cases, however, the pressure of the reaction will be in the range of 1 to 30 atmospheres absolute, most preferably the pressure of reaction zone is in the range of 10 to 25 atmospheres absolute. Although the reaction consumes two moles of hydrogen per mole of acetic acid to produce a mole of ethanol, the actual molar ratio of acetic acid to hydrogen in the feed stream may be varied between wide limits, e.g. from 100:1 to 1:100. It is preferred however that such ratio be in the range of 1:20 to 1:2. More preferably the molar ratio of acetic acid to hydrogen is 1:5. The raw materials used in connection with the process of this invention may be derived from any suitable source including natural gas, petroleum, coal, biomass and so forth. It is well known to produce acetic acid through methanol carbonylation, acetaldehyde oxidation, ethylene oxidation, oxidative fermentation, and anaerobic fermentation and so forth. As petroleum and natural gas have become more expensive, methods for producing acetic acid and intermediates such as methanol and carbon monoxide from alternate carbon sources have drawn more interest. Of particular interest is the production of acetic acid from synthesis gas (syngas) that may be derived from any suitable carbon source. United States Patent No. 6,232,352 to Vidalin, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference, for example, teaches a method of retrofitting a methanol plant for the manufacture of acetic acid. By retrofitting a methanol plant the large capital costs associated with CO generation for a new acetic acid plant are significantly reduced or largely eliminated. All or part of the syngas is diverted from the methanol synthesis loop and supplied to a separator unit to recover CO and hydrogen, which are then used to produce acetic acid. In addition to acetic acid, the process can also be used to make hydrogen which is utilized in connection with this invention. United States Patent No. RE 35,377 Steinberg et al., provides a method for the production of methanol by conversion of carbonaceous materials such as oil, coal, natural gas and biomass materials. The process includes hydrogasification of solid and/or liquid carbonaceous materials to obtain a process gas which is steam pyrolized with additional natural gas to form synthesis gas. The syngas is converted to methanol which may be carbonylated to acetic acid. The method likewise produces hydrogen which may be used in connection with this invention as noted above. See also, United States Patent No. 5,821,111 Grady et al., which discloses a process for converting waste biomass through gasification into synthesis gas as well as United States Patent No. 6,685,754 Kindig et al. The acetic acid may be vaporized at the reaction temperature, and then it can be fed along with hydrogen in undiluted state or diluted with a relatively inert carrier gas, such as nitrogen, argon, helium, carbon dioxide. Alternatively, acetic acid in vapor form may be taken directly as crude product from the flash vessel of a methanol carbonylation unit of the class described in United States Patent No. 6,657,078 of Scates et r al.. The crude vapor product may be fed directly to the reaction zones of the present invention without the need for condensing the acetic acid and light ends or removing water, saving overall processing costs. Contact or residence time can also vary widely, depending upon such variables as amount of acetic acid, catalyst, reactor, temperature and pressure. Typical contact times range from a fraction of a second to more than several hours when a catalyst system other than a fixed bed is used, with preferred contact times, at least for vapor phase reactions, between 0.5 and 100 seconds. Typically, the catalyst is employed in a fixed bed reactor e.g. in the shape of an elongated pipe or tube where the reactants, typically in the vapor form, are passed over or through the catalyst. Other reactors, such as fluid or ebullient bed reactors, can be employed, if desired. In some instances, it is advantageous to use the hydrogenation catalysts in conjunction with an inert material to regulate the pressure drop, flow, heat balance or other process parameters in the catalyst bed including the contact time of the reactant compounds with the catalyst particles. In one of the preferred embodiments there is also provided a process for selective and direct formation of ethanol from acetic acid comprising: contacting a feed stream containing acetic acid and hydrogen at an elevated temperature with a suitable hydrogenating catalyst containing 1 weight percent to 15 weight percent of cobalt on a suitable catalyst support and a second metal supported on said support and wherein said second metal is selected from the group consisting of palladium or platinum. In this embodiment of the process of this invention, the preferred hydrogenation catalyst contains one (1) weight percent palladium or platinum with ten (10) weight percent cobalt. In this embodiment of the process of this invention it is preferred that the hydrogenation catalysts is layered in a fixed bed and the reaction is carried out in the vapor phase using a feed stream of acetic acid and hydrogen in the molar range of 1:20 to 1:2 and at a temperature in the range of 225°C to 275°C and at a pressure of reaction zones in the range of 10 to 25 atmospheres absolute, and the contact time of reactants is in the range of 0.5 and 100 seconds. The following examples describe the procedures used for the preparation of various catalysts employed in the process of this invention.
