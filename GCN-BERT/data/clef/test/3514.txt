(2R,3R,4S,5R,6R)-6-(acetoxymethyl)tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2,3,4,5-tetrayl tetraacetate (1)
To a solution of D-glucose (CAS#50-99-7, 36.04 g, 0.2 mol) in anhydrous DMF (80 mL) was added sequentially acetic anhydride (188 mL), pyridine (162 mL, 2 mol), and DMAP (1.22 g, 0.01 mmol). The reaction mixture was stirred at ambient temperature for 3 h and quenched by dilution with water. The aqueous phase was extracted with ethyl acetate (2×300 mL) and the organic phase was washed with 1 N HCl (2×150 mL) and water. The organic layer was washed with saturated aq NaCl, dried over MgSO4 and concentrated. Recrystalization of the crude product from ethanol (400 mL) gave [(2R,3R,4S,5R)-3,4,5,6-tetrakis(acetyloxy)oxan-2-yl]methyl acetate as a white solid (63 g, 81%) white solid.
