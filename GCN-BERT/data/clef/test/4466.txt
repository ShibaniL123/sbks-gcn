FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention is broadly concerned with oligonucleotides useful in methods for detecting and characterizing Aspergillus fumigatus. More particularly, the present invention relates to oligonucleotides having nucleotide sequences derived from the gene encoding the cytochrome P450 14 alpha-sterol demethylase (i.e., the Cyp51A protein) of Aspergillus fumigatus, wherein these oligonucleotides are useful as forward and reverse primers for a polymerase chain reaction using nucleic acids from a biological sample as a template, as probes for detecting any resultant cyp51A-specific amplicon indicating the presence of Aspergillus fumigatus in the sample, and as nucleotide sequencing primers for detecting cyp51A mutations responsible for increased tolerance or resistance of Aspergillus fumigatus, relative to wild-type Aspergillus fumigatus, to at least on triazole. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Aspergillus fumigatus is the causative agent for medical conditions including invasive aspergillosis, which is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients. The survival of such patients depends on early diagnosis and prompt initiation of effective antifungal treatment (see Latge, 1999, Aspergillus fumigatus and spergillosis. Clinical Microbiology Reviews 12:310-350; and Man et al., 2002, Aspergillosis. Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and therapy. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America 16:875-894). Azole-based compounds (e.g., triazoles) are the most commonly used antifungal drugs. The target for these compounds is the Cyp51A protein. This protein is involved in the synthesis of ergosterol, which is a bulk sterol component of fungal cell membranes (see Vanden Bossche, 1985, Biochemical targets for antifungal azole derivatives: hypothesis on the mode of action. Current Topics in Medical Mycology 1:313-351). Unfortunately, conventional laboratory tests for the presence of Aspergillus fumigatus, such as culture and galactomannan detection, lack sensitivity, and are rarely conclusive, resulting in true positive results only at advanced stages of infection or necessitating invasive procedures for formal microbiological evaluation (see Denning, 1998, Invasive aspergillosis. Clinical Infectious Diseases 26:781-803; and Latge, 1999, Aspergillus fumigatus and aspergillosis. Clinical Microbiology Reviews 12:310-350). Furthermore, the emergence of clinical resistance to azole-based drugs impedes successful treatment of infection by Aspergillus fumigatus (see Denning et al., 1997, Itraconazole resistance in Aspergillus fumigatus. Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy 41:1364-1368; Mar et al., 2002, Aspergillosis, Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and therapy. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America 16:875-894; and Steinbach et al., 2003, Review of newer antifungal and immunomodulatory strategies for invasive aspergillosis. Clinical Infectious Diseases 37 Supplement 3:S157-S187). For example, isolates of Aspergillus fumigatus exhibiting increased tolerance to triazoles, relative to wild-type Aspergillus fumigatus, have been identified. Each of these isolates was found to have a mutation in cyp51A responsible for an amino acid substitution at position 54, 138, 220, or 448 of the Cyp51A protein, wherein each of these amino acid substitutions gave rise to the reduced triazole susceptibility. (see Mann et al., 2003, Mutations in Aspergillus fumigatus resulting in reduced susceptibility to posaconazole appear to be restricted to a single amino acid in the cytochrome P450 14 alpha-demethylase. Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy 47:577-581; Nascimento et al., 2003, Multiple resistance mechanisms among Aspergillus fumigatus mutants with high-level resistance to itraconazole. Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy 47:1719-1726; Diaz-Guerra et al., 2003, A point mutation in the 14 alpha-sterol demethylase gene cyp51A contributes to itraconazole resistance in Aspergillus fumigatus. Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy 47:1120-1124; Xiao et al., 2004, Three-dimensional models of wild-type and mutated forms of cytochrome P450 14 alpha-sterol demethylases from Aspergillus fumigatus and Candida albicans provide insights into posaconazole binding. Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy 48:568-574; and Mellado et al., 2004, Substitutions at methionine 220 in the 14 alpha-sterol demethylase (Cyp51A) of Aspergillus fumigatus are responsible for resistance in vitro to azole antifungal drugs. Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy 48:2747-2750). Thus, there exists a critical need to develop techniques to facilitate the early and reliable diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis by detecting the causative agent Aspergillus fumigatus in an infected patient, and to ascertain whether treating this patient with a triazole would be effective by determining whether the infecting Aspergillus fumigatus encodes a Cyp51A protein having one or more of the above-noted amino acid substitutions. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION General Overview of the Present Invention The aforementioned drawbacks in the detection of Aspergillus fumigatus and in the treatment of infection by Aspergillus fumigatus with a triazole are avoided by the present invention. Specifically, this invention is directed to particular oligonucleotides and to combinations of these oligonucleotides, wherein the combinations are useful in a first method for determining whether a sample contains Aspergillus fumigatus, and second, third, fourth, and fifth methods for determining whether a particular isolate of Aspergillus fumigatus is more tolerant to a triazole (e.g., itraconazole, posaconazole, ravuconazole, or voriconazole) than wild-type Aspergillus fumigatus. More specifically, the oligonucleotides of the present invention include forward primers and reverse primers for generating amplicons specific to nucleic acids encoding Cyp51A proteins of Aspergillus fumigatus, probes for detecting these amplicons, and nucleotide sequencing primers for detecting mutations responsible for amino acid substitutions at positions 54, 138, 220, and 448 of the Cyp51A protein of wild-type Aspergillus fumigatus, wherein these mutations give rise to increased tolerance or resistance of Aspergillus fumigatus to at least one triazole. The second, third, fourth, and fifth methods of the present invention are respectively directed to detection of the amino acid substitutions at positions 54, 138, 220, and 448 of the Cyp51A protein. An isolate of Aspergillus fumigatus is more tolerant to a triazole than wild-type Aspergillus fumigatus if (a) amino acid 54 of SEQ ID NO:2 is not Gly and is, e.g., Arg, Glu, Lys, Trp, or Val, (b) amino acid 138 of SEQ ID NO:3 is not Gly and is, e.g., Arg, (c) amino acid 220 of SEQ ID NO:4 is not Met and is, e.g., Val, Lys, or Thr, and (d) amino acid 448 of SEQ ID NO:5 is not Gly, and is, e.g., Ser.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION The following examples are examples of the first and second methods of the present invention. Specifically, these examples illustrate the use of (a) two specific oligonucleotides of the present invention (i.e., one forward primer and one reverse primer) to produce an amplicon specific to cyp51A of Aspergillus fumigatus by the polymerase chain reaction using nucleic acid isolated from a sample as a template, (b) a specific oligonucleotide of the present invention (i.e., probe) to detect this amplicon, thereby determining that an isolate of Aspergillus fumigatus was present in the sample, and (c) a specific oligonucleotide of the present invention (i.e., a sequencing primer) to determine that the identity of amino acid 54 of Cyp51A protein is Gly. These examples are set forth by way of illustration only, and nothing therein shall be taken as a limitation upon the overall scope of the invention. EXAMPLES A region of cyp51A of Aspergillus fumigatus 269 base pairs in length was amplified using the Rotor-Gene 3000 platform (Corbett Research, Sydney, Australia). A dual-labeled DNA probe was employed for real-time monitoring of amplification by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The PCRs were carried out in a volume of 25 μl containing a 300 nM concentration of each primer (forward primer: 5′-TCATTGGGTCCCATTTCTGGGTAG-3′ (SEQ ID NO: 16), reverse primer: 5′-biotin/TAGACCTCTTCCGCATTGACATCC-3′ (SEQ ID NO: 17) with the addition of a biotin moiety), 100 nM probe (5′-6-FAM/AAACCACAGTCTACCTGGGCGTTCA/BHQ-1-3′) (nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:26 with the addition of a 6-FAM moiety and a BHQ-1 moiety, wherein the 6-FAM moiety is 6-carboxy-fluorescein and the BHQ-1 moiety is Black Hole Quencher 1), and 12.5 μl of a 2× concentration of Platinum Quantitative PCR Supermix-UDG (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.). Parameters for the PCRs were as follows: an initial incubation at 50° C. for 2 minutes for UDG activity followed by 95° C. for 2 minutes to inactivate the UDG and activate the Taq DNA polymerase. Next, 45 cycles of denaturation (95° C., 20 seconds) and annealing and extension (60° C., 60 seconds) were performed with fluorescence acquisition (excitation, 470 nM; emission, 510 nM) immediately following each annealing-extension step. A final extension (72° C., 10 minutes) was performed. Fluorescence curves were analyzed with dynamic-tube normalization, slope correction, and automatic threshold determination by a best-fit line of at least three standards using Rotor-Gene version 5.0 software (Corbett Research, Sydney, Australia). The specificity of the real-time PCR was assessed by carrying out the reaction with DNA from a panel of 44 different species of viral, bacterial, and fungal pathogens, including Aspergillus fumigatus SRRC 2006, Aspergillus flavus MC 21, Aspergillus nidulans NRRL 187, Aspergillus niger SN 26, Aspergillus oryzae NRRL 1989, Aspergillus terreus NRRL 255, and Aspergillus versicolor NRRL 238. All isolated cultures were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, Va. DNA was extracted using standard methods described in Ausubel et al., 1997, Short Protocols in Molecular Biology, 3rd edition, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, N.Y. Only DNA from Aspergillus fumigatus was amplified (data not shown). A positive-control plasmid was constructed by subcloning, into the pCR II-TOPO vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.), the amplicon generated by PCR using genomic DNA extracted from isolated Aspergillus fumigatus as a template. The linear detection range was from 108 to 10 copies of positive-control plasmid per reaction in the presence of 500 ng of DNA extracted from Aspergillus-negative whole-blood samples (see FIG. 1A). All extractions of whole blood were performed as described in Van Burik et al., 1998, Panfungal PCR assay for detection of fungal infection in human blood specimens. Journal of Clinical Microbiology 36:1169-1175, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference. The real-time PCR was also able to detect 50 μg of mycelia from a freeze-dried culture of Aspergillus fumigatus (purchased from the American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, Va.) spiked into 1-ml whole-blood samples from two healthy donors with no clinical symptoms of aspergillosis, using the donors' nonspiked whole blood as negative controls (data not shown). To assess the functionality of the real-time PCR with actual clinical samples, DNA extracts from 56 whole-blood samples obtained from different patients and three dilutions of the positive-control plasmid were used as templates (see FIG. 1B). Aspergillus fumigatus DNA was detected in 2 of the 56 samples, which correlates with the results obtained from an independent Aspergillus fumigatus conventional PCR assay targeting the 26S/internal transcribed spacer rRNA gene region as described in Spreadbury et al., 1993, Detection of Aspergillus fumigatus by polymerase chain reaction. Journal of Clinical Microbiology 31:615-621. Neither PCR assay generated a positive result for the other 54 samples. The quality of clinical-sample DNA and the absence of PCR inhibitors were validated by amplification of the human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene by real-time PCR (Biosearch Technologies, Novato, Calif.) (data not shown). The nucleotide sequences of amplicons generated from real-time PCR were determined using a bioluminometric, nonelectrophoretic technique called pyrosequencing, which utilizes a cascade of coupled enzymatic reactions to monitor DNA synthesis. The pyrosequencing method is described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,210,891 and 6,258,568, wherein the entire contents of both patents are hereby incorporated by reference, and Ronaghi et al., 1998, A sequencing method based on real-time pyrophosphate. Science 281:363-365, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference. The pyrosequencing technique has the advantages of speed, accuracy, and parallel processing. The 5′ end of the reverse primer used in the PCR was biotinylated to facilitate amplicon capture and preparation for pyrosequencing directly from the PCR using streptavidin Sephadex (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden) and the Pyrosequencing Vacuum Prep tool (Biotage, Uppsala, Sweden). For the pyrosequencing reaction, a 0.5 nM concentration of the sequencing primer (5′-TCTGGGTAGTACCATCAGT-3′) (SEQ ID NO:18) was used. This sequencing primer possesses a unique sequence found within the amplicon upstream from the codon which encodes the amino acid corresponding to the amino acid at position 54 of the Cyp51A protein. A Pyrosequencing 96MA System (Biotage, Uppsala, Sweden) was programmed with 10 cycles of an AGCT dispensation order. The resulting pyrosequencing data was analyzed with the PSQ 96MA version 2.1 software (Biotage, Uppsala, Sweden). The best-quality DNA sequences resolved were used in subsequent analyses. Typically, 19 to 24 bases of sequence were interpretable when genomic DNA extracted from isolated Aspergillus fumigatus was used (see FIG. 2A). The lengths of the best-quality sequences were significantly shorter from clinical samples but provided enough sequence to identify the target and determine the codon for the amino acid at position 54 (see FIG. 2B). All nucleotide sequences obtained by pyrosequencing were identical to the expected nucleotide sequence of cyp51A of Aspergillus fumigatus. The data presented in these examples justify expansion of the pyrosequencing analysis of cyp51A to determine other sites of mutation conferring tolerance to triazoles, including the codons encoding amino acids corresponding to the amino acid at position 138 of SEQ ID NO:3 (as described in the third method of the present invention), the amino acid at position 220 of SEQ ID NO:4 (as described in the fourth method of the present invention), and the amino acid at position 448 of SEQ ID NO:5 (as described in the fifth method of the present invention). Nucleotide sequences of oligonucleotides potentially useful as forward and reverse primers, probes, and nucleotide sequencing primers are determined using computer programs such as Assay Design Software 1.0.6 (Biotage, Uppsala, Sweden) and Beacon Designer 4.02 (Build 402003) (PREMIER Biosoft International, Palo Alto, Calif.). 1.
