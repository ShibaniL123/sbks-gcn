FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to the conversion of odor-containing fatty acids or odor-containing fatty acids with glycerides to deodorized glycerides with concomitant removal of odor bodies. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Palm-kernel and coconut oil constitute two of the most important seed oils. A substantial portion of fatty alcohols used for surfactant manufacture are produced through hydrogenation of fatty acid methyl esters that are derived from coconut and palm kernel oils. These fatty alcohols are used as a major component of soaps, detergents, and toiletries. Fatty acid distillates (FAD) are by-products of the refining process used to prepare the crude oils for conversion to methyl esters. Without removal of the fatty acids, base catalysts used in methyl ester making will react with the fatty acids, forming soaps and resulting in lower yields. The FAD contains primarily fatty acids, but also contains glycerides and other minor components and impurities. For example, included in the impurities are odor-bodies resulting from the process of extracting the coconut oil from its source (coconuts), during which the coconut shells typically are burned. The burning creates phenols, furans, and other compounds of combustion giving a smoky, tar-like, burnt off-odor to the FAD. In order to prevent these odor bodies from affecting downstream operations (e.g., soap-making), the FADs containing these odor-causing compounds are removed along with the fatty acids as waste. Accordingly, it would be desirable to prevent the yield loss caused by disposal of the FAD, yet still eliminate the odor-bodies from the downstream manufacturing process. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention eliminates the yield loss caused by disposal of the FAD, yet still eliminates the odor-bodies from the downstream manufacturing process. This is accomplished by converting the FAD into a useable material. The fatty acids present in the FAD stream are converted to glycerides, then the odor bodies are removed from the glycerides to form deodorized glycerides. The deodorized glycerides can be added back into the production stream or used in other downstream manufacturing processes (e.g., methyl esters, fatty alcohols). BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIG. 1 is a diagram showing the formation of glycerides from fatty acids according to the present invention. It should be understood that the particular mono- and di-glyceride positional isomers depicted do not limit the present invention to those isomers, but merely are representative of the positional isomers possible for monoglycerides (primary or secondary) and diglycerides (primary-primary or primary-secondary). DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides a method for the production of deodorized glycerides from fatty acids (or mixtures of fatty acids with glycerides) containing odor bodies. This process is shown in FIG. 1. As used herein, “fatty acid” includes (1) aliphatic monocarboxylic acids derived from or contained in esterified forms in an animal or vegetable fat, oil, or wax; (2) free fatty acids and/or glycerides (e.g., mono, di, tri) with odor bodies; and combinations thereof. The fatty acids herein typically have a carbon chain length of C6-C22, or C8-C18. The fatty acid distillate (FAD) stream results from steam stripping of the crude vegetable oil to remove free fatty acids and odor compounds and typically contains about 70% fatty acids (C8 through C18 chain-length) and about 30% glycerides and odor compounds. In order to eliminate overall process yield loss, the present invention relates to converting these fatty acids back into glycerides for further processing (e.g., into methyl esters or fatty alcohols). This is accomplished by an esterification reaction of the FAD with glycerin, which converts the fatty acid first into a monoglyceride, which can react with another fatty acid making a diglyceride, which can react with a third fatty acid molecule making a triglyceride; water is formed in each of these reactions as a by-product. Each of these reactions is equilibrium based, resulting in a final mixture of glycerin, water, fatty acid, monoglycerides, diglycerides, and triglycerides. Accordingly, the invention provides a method for the production of deodorized glycerides from fatty acids containing odor bodies, the method comprising: (a) adding glycerine to the fatty acids to form a first mixture;(b) mixing said first mixture;(c) heating said first mixture at a temperature of from 120° C. to 250° C. to form a heated mixture.(d) removing water and odor bodies from said heated mixture by a means selected from the group consisting of: (1) reducing the pressure of the heated mixture;(2) sparging the heated mixture with inert gas; and(3) combinations thereof;(e) optionally checking the amount of fatty acids remaining in said heated mixture;(f) optionally removing residual odor bodies from said heated mixture, wherein removing is selected from the group consisting of: (1) sparging the heated mixture with an inert gas;(2) steam stripping the heated mixture;(3) reducing the pressure of the heated mixture; and(4) combinations thereof;(g) recovering the deodorized glycerides. While use of the present invention is discussed mainly in terms of coconut oil, it should be understood that the method can be applied to any vegetable oil source as desired, such as palm kernel, palm or soybean. The present invention involves a method for the production of deodorized glycerides from fatty acids; in some cases, the fatty acid material will also comprise glycerides. In either case, the fatty acids (or fatty acids+glycerides) in the FAD are separated from the odor bodies contained therein to produce deodorized glycerides. The method herein comprises adding glycerine to the fatty acids or (fatty acids+glycerides combination) containing odor bodies to form a first mixture. Such added glycerine can be selected from any suitable source, such as refined glycerine, crude glycerine, or combinations thereof. The first mixture is mixed using any appropriate mixing method and/or device as is known in the art. As used herein, “adding glycerine to the fatty acids” is broad enough to include the addition of glycerine to the aforementioned fatty acid+glyceride combination. Thus, unless otherwise indicated, “adding glycerine to the fatty acids” means adding glycerine to fatty acids that optionally may be in combination with glycerides. It should be noted that the stoichiometric molar ratio of glycerine to fatty acid is 1:3 to produce a triglyceride product and water: 1 Glycerin+3 Fatty Acid→1 Triglyceride+3 H2O (as shown in FIG. 1). The process of the present invention need not run stoichiometrically, however. The ratio of glycerine to FAD was determined empirically, targeting for optimization of fatty acid consumption at time and temperature. The preferred ratio of glycerin to FAD was determined to be about 25% by weight. This results in a mixture of mono-, di-, and triglycerides: 1 Glycerin+1, 2, or 3 Fatty Acids→1 Mono-, Di- or Triglyceride+1, 2, or 3 H2O. This process is carried out without the use of catalyst. After the mixing step, the mixture is then heated at a temperature of from 120° C. to 250° C., alternately from 190° C. to 210° C., or from 170° C. to 230° C., to form a heated mixture. As used herein, “heating at a temperature” means the temperature of the mixture being heated, rather than the temperature of the heat source. Water and odor bodies are then removed from the heated mixture by any appropriate means; this step is preferably carried out concurrent with the heating step, wherein fatty acids react to form glycerides. The aforementioned heating and the subsequent process of removing water and odor bodies should be carried out such that the reaction rate is increased without substantially driving off the fatty acids. One skilled in the art will be able to balance the reaction rate with the drive-off of fatty acids to achieve an acceptable result. Means of removing water and odor bodies from the heated mixture during the reaction can include reducing the pressure of the heated mixture, sparging the heated mixture with inert gas (e.g., N2, He, Ar), and/or combinations thereof. At this point, one may optionally wish to check the amount of fatty acids remaining in the heated mixture, for example to compare with that level present in the mixture before heating. This can be accomplished by any suitable means known to one skilled in the art, such as GC, NMR, IR, titration, or other suitable methods. In one embodiment, this checking step comprises confirming that from 50% to 100%, or greater than 95%, of the fatty acids are no longer present in the heated mixture. If an undesired level of odor bodies still remains, these residual odor bodies are removed. Removing such residual odor bodies can be accomplished by any suitable means, such as sparging the heated mixtures with an inert gas (e.g., N2, He, Ar), steam stripping the heated mixture, reducing the pressure of the heated mixture, and/or combinations thereof. In a particular embodiment, steam stripping is carried out for a time sufficient to reduce the level of odor bodies present in the glycerides to the desired level, as can be determined by one skilled in the art in view of this disclosure. Once the desired level of odor body reduction is obtained, the resulting deodorized glycerides are recovered (i.e., when odor body reduction reaches an acceptable level, the glycerides are considered to be “deodorized”). At this point in the process, from 2 to 12 hours, or from 5 to 7 hours, have typically elapsed. The desired level of odor body reduction will depend upon various factors, such as the intended use of the deodorized glycerides. One skilled in the art will be able to determine the desired level of odor body reduction in view of this disclosure.

The samples included both crude oil (prior to FAD removal) and deodorized glycerides (processed using nitrogen sweep, reduced pressure, and/or steam stripping according to the method herein). The panel concluded that the deodorized glyceride samples had a better odor profile than did the crude oil samples. Example 9 Further Processing of Deodorized Glycerides Using procedures available in the chemical literature, deodorized glycerides prepared as outlined above were converted to methyl esters using sodium methoxide and methanol. The obtained methyl esters were hydrogenated using a copper chromite catalyst to form the desired fatty alcohols, followed by conversion of the alcohols to alkyl sulfates using chlorosulfonic acid and sodium hydroxide. The alkyl sulfates were evaluated by a qualified panel and judged to have acceptable odor profiles.
