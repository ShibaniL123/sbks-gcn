The present invention relates to a rhamno-polysaccharide antigen from Enterococcus faecium clonal complex 17 which is useful as a vaccine component for therapy and/or prophylaxis of bacterial infection. Background of the invention Enterococci are among the most important pathogens associated with nosocomial infections. Especially E. faecium have acquired multiple antibiotic resistances and are often resistant to vancomycin, an antibiotic of last resort against multi-resistant Gram-positive bacteria. Furthermore, it has been shown that the determinant for vancomycin resistance can be transferred from E. faecium to the much more virulent Staphylococcus aureus (Chang et al. Infection with vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus containing the vanA resistance gene. N Engl J Med (2003) vol. 348 (14) pp. 1342-7). Specific lineages, such as the "clonal complex" 17, have been associated with hospital outbreaks of vancomycin-resistant E. faecium worldwide (Willems et al. Global spread of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium from distinct nosocomial genetic complex. Emerging Infect Dis (2005) vol. 11 (6) pp. 821-8) and these strains seem to be adapted particularly well to the hospital setting. While some limited information exists regarding the presence and composition of capsular polysaccharides in E. faecalis, almost nothing is known about surface carbohydrates in E. faecium. Huebner et al. (Huebner et al. Isolation and chemical characterization of a capsular polysaccharide antigen shared by clinical isolates of Enterococcus faecalis and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium. Infect Immun (1999) vol. 67 (3) pp. 1213-9) could show that some E. faecium strains seem to be unencapsulated and are effectively killed by sera raised against lipoteichoic acid. However, a majority of strains seems to possess a capsule and are resistant to killing due to antibodies raised against enterococcal lipoteichoic acids (LTA) (unpublished observation). Since there are often virtually no antibiotics available to treat patients with VRE infections, the development of alternative treatment options are of utmost importance. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide new and effective antigens, and in particular polysaccharide (PS)-antigens, in order to develop new promising vaccines for an active or passive immunotherapy of bacteria, and in particular enterococci. The present invention fulfils these needs by providing a rhamno-polysaccharide antigen from E. faecium clonal complex, comprising an antigenic structure of the following formula → 2)-α-L-Rhap-(1→3)-α-L-Rhap-(1→3)-α-L-Rhap-(1→ wherein Rha is selected from rhamnose, and wherein optionally at least one group -OH is replaced by -OW, wherein W is selected from acetyl, C1 to C12-alkyl, and C1 to C12-alkenyl; and salts or solvates thereof. Preferably, Rha is selected from rhamnose. In order to identify targets of opsonic antibodies in E. faecium, the inventors used a clinical isolate belonging to the clonal complex 17 (CC17) (E. faecium E155, Leavis et al. Insertion sequence-driven diversification creates a globally dispersed emerging multiresistant subspecies of E. faecium. PLoS Pathog (2007) vol. 3 (1) pp. e7) that was heat-killed (65°C for 45 min) and injected into a rabbit. The resulting serum was tested in an opsonophagocytic assay, the best surrogate for a protective immune response against bacterial pathogens. The resulting sera showed a killing of 72% at a dilution of 1:20 against the homologous strain (see Fig. 2). The rhamno-polysaccharide antigen of the invention provides a new and effective antigenic target for the development of more efficient strategies to effectively treat and/or prevent infection in vertebrates caused, at least in part, by enterococci or other Gram-positive bacteria, allows for improved vaccination strategies, and allows the development and production of respective vaccines, such as glycoconjugate vaccines. The rhamno-polysaccharide antigen of the invention of the polysaccharide of E. faecium consists of a trisaccharide repeating unit according to the above formula. Thus, further preferred is a rhamno-polysaccharide antigen of the invention, wherein said antigen comprises 1 to 20 trisaccharide repeating units, preferably 1 to 10 units, such as, for example, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, and most preferred 1 to 3 units. The above rhamno-polysaccharide antigen can furthermore include at least one (which is preferred) linker group L, which is preferably attached to one of the ends of the chain of the repeating unit(s) and/or the sugar moieties, in order to be coupled or conjugated to other chemical entities. These linker groups are known in the state of the art, and usually are immunologically inactive, i.e. do not interfere with the immunological properties of the rhamno-polysaccharide antigen. Preferred linkers include, but are not limited to, C1 to C12 alkylamino linkers, which are optionally substituted with other groups, or peptide linkers. Other modifications include the addition of chemical moieties to the rhamno-polysaccharide antigen (also included in "L") in order to carry a detectable label, such as chelating groups or enzymatic groups. Furthermore, peptide (e.g. His) or other "labels" or "tags" can be added in order to be able to purify and/or use the rhamno-polysaccharide antigen, for example in diagnostic assays. Although it is speculated that the immunologic activity of said molecule increases with its length of rhamno-polysaccharide antigen units, the inventors assume that shorter molecules can already be quite effective in their immune response. Another aspect of the invention then relates to a pharmaceutical composition, comprising at least one of the rhamno-polysaccharide antigens according to the present invention and/or at least one antibody according to the present invention as described below, together with at least one pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, adjuvant and/or diluent. Particularly preferred is a pharmaceutical composition according to the present invention, wherein said composition comprises a rhamno-polysaccharide antigen as described herein. Further preferred is a pharmaceutical composition according to the present invention, wherein said composition is formulated as a vaccine, in particular against infections caused by enterococci, in particular antibiotic resistant enterococci, such as VRE strains, preferably of E. faecalis or E. faecium, e.g. E. faecium clonal complex 17. Most preferred is a pharmaceutical composition according to the present invention, wherein said rhamno-polysaccharide antigen according to the present invention is present in a glycoconjugate vaccine. The rhamno-polysaccharide antigen according to the present invention (either present as the antigen alone or in a bacterial extract or cell wall fraction) is preferably used for an enterococcal, staphylococcal, or pneumococcal vaccine, either for active or passive immunization. Thus the invention further provides a pharmaceutical composition, and in particular a vaccine, for the prevention of enterococcal infections in a vertebrate, said pharmaceutical composition comprising at least one rhamno-polysaccharide antigen according to the present invention, optionally together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, adjuvants and/or diluent.

The methods for purifying the selected bacterial fractions containing enterococcal rhamno-polysaccharide antigen are known to the person of skill. Another aspect relates to a pharmaceutical composition or vaccine, wherein the rhamno-polysaccharide antigen as included has been produced, at least in part, through chemical synthesis.

The pharmaceutical composition can be formulated for administration via intramuscular, subcutaneous, topical or other parenteral route. In general, the microorganisms of the present invention are commensal in nature. Thus, oral administration is generally not an effective route of vaccination, and as a consequence, administration via an intramuscular, subcutaneous topical or other parenteral route is preferred. Preferably, the vaccine is formulated for administration via intramuscular, subcutaneous, or inhalation routes. The vaccine may also include cytokines, such as: G-CSF, GM-CSF, interleukins or tumor necrosis factor alpha, used singly or in combination.

The present invention will now be further described in the following preferred non-limiting examples with reference to the accompanying figures. For the purposes of the present invention, all references as cited herein are incorporated in their entireties. Fig. 1 shows the structure of the repeating unit of the PS according to the invention: → 2)-α-L-Rhap-(1→3)-α-L-Rhap-(1→3)-α-L-Rhap-(1→Fig. 2 shows opsonic killing of E. faecium 155 with rabbit serum raised against whole heat-killed bacteria, and inhibition of killing with different amounts of purified E155 rhamno-polysaccharide. Examples In order to identify targets of opsonic antibodies in E. faecium, the inventors used a clinical isolate belonging to the CC17 (E. faecium E155, Leavis et al. Insertion sequence-driven diversification creates a globally dispersed emerging multiresistant subspecies of E. faecium. PLoS Pathog (2007) vol. 3 (1) pp. e7) that was heat-killed (65°C for 45 min) and injected into a rabbit. The resulting serum was tested in an opsonophagocytic assay, the best surrogate for a protective immune response against bacterial pathogens. The resulting sera showed a killing of 72% at a dilution of 1:20 against the homologous strain (see Fig. 2). Bacteria were grown in Columbia broth supplemented with 0.5% glucose at 37°C for 24 h. Bacterial cells were washed in PBS and cell walls were digested by addition of mutanolysin and lysozyme (each at 100 µg/ml in PBS supplemented with 20 mM MgCl2, 20 mNt CaCl2, and 0.05% NaN3) at 37°C for 24 h. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was treated with nucleases (DNase I and RNase A, 100 µg/ml) at 37°C for 6 h followed by addition of proteinase K (100 µg/ml) at 59°C for 24 h. The supernatant was dialyzed against deionized H2O, and lyophilized. For size exclusion chromatography, the material was redissolved in H2O, and applied to a column (1.0 x 90 cm) ofBioGel P-100. Obtained polymeric fraction was dialyzed, lyophilized, resuspended in 20 mM CH3COONH4 (pH 8.0) and applied to an anion-exchange column (Q-Sepharose FF). Bound antigen was eluted from the column by a gradient of 1 M CH3COONH4 (pH 8.0) and fractions were assayed for hexose content, then pooled and controlled by 1H NMR spectroscopy. Fractions eluted at the beginning of gradient were subjected to further chemical and NMR analyses. Sugar analysis of obtained polysaccharide revealed the presence of Rha only. The absolute configuration of monosaccharides was established by GLC of (S,R)- and (S)-but-2-yl glycosides. This experiment demonstrated L-configuration of the Rha residues. The 1H NMR spectrum of PS showed three anomeric signals at δ 5.165 (residue A, 3JH1,H2 <2 Hz), δ 4.980 (residue B, 3JH1,H2 <2 Hz), and δ 4.906 (residue C, 3JH1,H2 <2 Hz ) and signals characteristic of the protons of the methyl groups of 6-deoxysugars (δ 1.268, δ 1.269, and δ 1.232). These signals confirmed presence of Rha which was identified by sugar analysis results. The TOCSY spectrum exhibited three different spin systems, which enabled the identification of all the proton signals belonging to all residues. The proton orders in all spin systems were assigned using the COSY spectrum. All 1H and 13C chemical shifts (see Table 1) were established using 1H, correlated 1H,1H (COSY and TOCSY), as well as correlated 1H,13C HSQC NMR experiments. Anomeric configurations of monosaccharides were defined on the basis of 1JC-1,H-1 coupling constants derived from 1H,13C HSQC NMR experiment (recorded without decoupling). The values of 1JC-1,H-1 were ~ 173 Hz, which revealed the α-anomeric configuration of all 0residues. The six-membered rings of all monosaccharides were assigned by the lack of carbon atom signals in the δ ~83-88 in 13C NMR spectrum. The 1H, 13C HSQC NMR spectrum showed three anomeric carbon signals at δ 100.69 (A), δ 102.06 (B), and δ 101.85 (C). This spectrum also contained the remaining sugar carbon resonances. Low-field shifted signals of carbon atoms demonstrated substitutions at C-2 of A (δ 78.04), C-3 ofB (δ 77.73), and C-3 of C (δ 78.04) residues. The sugar sequence within the trisaccharide repeating unit of PS was assigned from ROESY experiment, which exhibited inter-residual NOE contacts between following anomeric protons and corresponding glycosidically linked protons: A1/B3 (δ 5.165/3.853), B1/C3 (δ 4.980/3.792), and C1/A2 (δ 4.906/4.037). Compositional analyses and NMR data revealed the structure of the repeating unit of the PS as shown in Figure 1: →2)-α-L-Rhap-(1→3)-α-L-Rhap-(1→3)-α-L-Rhap-(1→ Table 1. 1H and 13C NMR data chemical shifts of PS isolated from E. faecium E-155Chemical shifts 1H and 13C [ppm]ResidueH1H2H3H4H5H61JC-1,H-1 [Hz]C1C2C3C4C5C6→2-L-α-Rha (A)5.1654.0373.9103.4603.7891.269173100.6978.0469.7372.1269.2016.64→3-L-α-Rha (B)4.9804.0903.8533.5173.8461.268173102.0669.9077.7371.4269.1616.64→3-L-α-Rha (C)4.9064.1303.7923.5103.7081.232173101.8569.7778.0471.3469.2916.69 The opsonic sera described above were absorbed with the rhamno-polysaccharide at different concentrations.
