GLASS ARTICLE AND METHOD FOR FORMING THE SAME BACKGROUND [0001]This application claims the benefit of priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/952580 filed on March 13, 2014 and U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/989717 filed on May 7, 2014 the content of each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. 1 . Field [0002]This disclosure relates to glass articles, and more particularly to laminated glass articles comprising at least two glass layers having different degradation rates in a reagent and use of such glass articles for making processed glass articles with defect-free surfaces. 2. Technical Background [0003] Processing or handling a glass article such as a glass rod or a glass sheet can damage the surface of the glass article. For example, a glass sheet can be molded to form a molded glass article having any of a variety of different three-dimensional shapes. During the molding process, any defects present on the surface of the mold can be transferred to the surface of the molded glass article. The resulting defects can be removed from the molded glass article by grinding and polishing, which can be time- consuming, expensive, and awkward to perform, especially on non-flat surfaces. Alternatively, the defects can be removed by acid-etching, which can leave the molded glass article with a visibly roughened surface. SUMMARY [0004] Disclosed herein are glass articles and methods for forming glass articles. The glass articles comprise a core and a clad. The core comprises a core glass composition, and the clad comprises a clad glass composition different than the core glass composition. A degradation rate of the clad glass composition in a reagent is greater than a degradation rate of the core glass composition in the reagent. [0005] Disclosed herein is a method comprising forming a glass article. The glass article comprises a core and a clad adjacent to the core. The core comprises a core glass composition. The clad comprises a clad glass composition different than the core glass composition. The clad glass composition comprises from about 45 mol % to about 60 mol % S1O2 and from about 8 mol % to about 19 mol % AI2O3. The clad glass composition is substantially free of As and Cd. A degradation rate of the clad glass composition in a reagent is at least 10 times greater than a degradation rate of the core glass composition in the reagent. [0006] Also disclosed herein is a method comprising forming a laminated glass sheet comprising a core layer disposed between a first cladding layer and a second cladding layer. The first cladding layer and the second cladding layer independently comprise from about 45 mol % to about 60 mol % S1O2 and from about 8 mol % to about 19 mol % AI2O3. The first cladding layer and the second cladding layer are substantially free of As and Cd. An outer surface of the laminated glass sheet is contacted with a processing unit. The first cladding layer and the second cladding layer are contacted with a reagent to at least partially remove the first cladding layer and the second cladding layer. A ratio of a degradation rate of each of the first cladding layer and the second cladding layer in the reagent to a degradation rate of the core layer in the reagent is at least 10. [0007] Also disclosed herein is a glass article comprising a core and a clad adjacent to the core. The core comprises a core glass composition. The clad comprises a clad glass composition. The clad glass composition comprises from about 45 mol % to about 60 mol % S1O2, from about 8 mol % to about 19 mol % AI2O3, a coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of from about 50 x 10"7/°C to about 95 x 10"7/°C, and a liquidus viscosity of at least about 50 kP. The clad glass composition is substantially free of Pb, As, and Cd. A ratio of a degradation rate of the clad glass composition in a reagent to a degradation rate of the core glass composition in the reagent is at least about 10. [0008] Also disclosed herein is a glass article comprising a core and a clad substantially enveloping the core. The core comprises a core glass composition. The clad comprises a clad glass composition. The clad glass composition comprises from about 45 mol % to about 60 mol % SiO2, from about 8 mol % to about 19 mol % AI2O3, a coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of from about 50 x 10"7/°C to about 95 x 10"7/°C, and a liquidus viscosity of at least about 50 kP. The clad glass composition is substantially free of As and Cd. Contacting the glass article with a reagent for about 0.5 hr to about 10 hr causes the clad to be at least partially removed from the core and exposes an outer surface of the core.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION [0026] Reference will now be made in detail to exemplary embodiments which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Whenever possible, the same reference numerals will be used throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like parts. The components in the drawings are not necessarily to scale, emphasis instead being placed upon illustrating the principles of the exemplary embodiments. [0027] As used herein, the term "liquidus viscosity" refers to the shear viscosity of a glass composition at the liquidus temperature of the glass composition. [0028] As used herein, the term "liquidus temperature" refers to the highest temperature at which devitrification occurs in a glass composition. [0029] As used herein, the terms "coefficient of thermal expansion" or "CTE" refer to the coefficient of thermal expansion of a glass composition averaged over a temperature range from about 20°C to about 300°C. [0030] The term "substantially free," when used herein to describe the absence of a particular oxide component in a glass composition, means that the component is absent from the glass composition or present in the glass composition in a trace amount of less than 0.2 mol %. [0031] Throughout this disclosure, the concentrations of constituent components (e.g., S1O2, AI2O3, B2O3, and the like) are given in mole percent (mol %) on an oxide basis, unless otherwise specified. [0032] FIG. 1 is a cross-sectional view of one exemplary embodiment of a glass article comprising a core and a clad adjacent to the core. The clad can be directly adjacent to the core or spaced from the core by one or more intermediate glass layers. In some embodiments, the clad comprises an exterior shell at least partially enveloping the core. The clad can aid in protecting the core during processing and/or handling of the glass article as described herein. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 1 , the glass article comprises a laminated glass sheet 100. Glass sheet 100 can be planar as shown in FIG. 1 or non-planar. The core of glass sheet 100 comprises a core layer 102. The core layer can comprise a single layer as shown in FIG. 1 or a plurality of layers. The clad of glass sheet 100 comprises a first cladding layer 104 and a second cladding layer 106. Each of the first cladding layer and the second cladding layer can comprise a single layer as shown in FIG. 1 or a plurality of layers. Core layer 102 is disposed between first cladding layer 104 and second cladding layer 106. First cladding layer 104 and second cladding layer 106 are exterior layers of glass sheet 100. Core layer 102 comprises a first major surface and a second major surface opposite the first major surface. In some embodiments, first cladding layer 104 is fused to the first major surface of core layer 102. Additionally, or alternatively, second cladding layer 106 is fused to the second major surface of core layer 102. The interface between first cladding layer 104 and core layer 102 and/or between second cladding layer 106 and core layer 102 can be free of any bonding material such as, for example, an adhesive, a coating layer, or any other non-glass material added or configured to adhere the respective cladding layer to the core layer. Thus, one or both of cladding layers 104 and 106 are fused directly to core layer 102 and/or disposed directly adjacent to the core layer. In some embodiments, the glass sheet comprises one or more intermediate layers disposed between the core layer and the first cladding layer and/or between the core layer and the second cladding layer. For example, the intermediate layers comprise intermediate glass layers and/or diffusion layers formed at the interface of the core layer and the cladding layer. The diffusion layer can comprise a blended region comprising components of each layer adjacent to the diffusion layer. In some embodiments, glass sheet 100 comprises a glass-glass laminate (e.g., an in situ fused multilayer glass-glass laminate) in which the interfaces between directly adjacent glass layers are glass-glass interfaces. [0033] FIG. 2 is a cross-sectional view of another exemplary embodiment of a glass article comprising a core and a clad adjacent to the core. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 2, the glass article comprises a laminated glass sheet 1 10. Glass sheet 1 10 is similar to glass sheet 100 described with reference to FIG. 1. For example, glass sheet 1 10 comprises a core layer 1 12 disposed between a first cladding layer 1 14 and a second cladding layer 1 16. Core layer 1 12 comprises a plurality of layers. For example, in the embodiment shown in FIG. 2, core layer 1 12 comprises an inner core layer 1 12a disposed between a first outer core layer 1 12b and a second outer core layer 1 12c. First outer core layer 1 12b is disposed between first cladding layer 1 14 and inner core layer 1 12a. Second outer core layer 1 12c is disposed between second cladding layer 1 16 and inner core layer 1 12a. [0034] In some embodiments, the core comprises a core glass composition, and the clad comprises a clad glass composition that is different than the core glass composition. For example, in the embodiment shown in FIG. 1 , core layer 102 comprises the core glass composition, and each of first cladding layer 104 and second cladding layer 106 comprises the clad glass composition. In other embodiments, first cladding layer 104 comprises a first clad glass composition, and second cladding layer 106 comprises a second clad glass composition that is different than the core glass composition and/or the first clad glass composition. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 2, inner core layer 1 12a comprises an inner core glass composition, and each of first outer core layer 1 12b and second outer core layer 1 12c comprises an outer core glass composition that is different than the inner core glass composition. In other embodiments, first outer core layer 1 12b comprises a first outer core glass composition, and second outer core layer 1 12c comprises a second outer core glass composition that is different than the inner core glass composition and/or the first outer core glass composition. [0035] The glass article can be formed using a suitable process (e.g., a fusion-draw, down-draw, slot-draw, up-draw, rolling, or offline lamination process). In some embodiments, the glass article is formed using a fusion-draw process. FIG. 3 illustrates one exemplary embodiment of a laminate overflow distributor apparatus 200 that can be used to form a glass article such as, for example, glass sheet 100 using a fusion-draw process. Apparatus 200 is configured generally as described in U.S. Patent No. 4,214,886, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. Apparatus 200 comprises a lower overflow distributor 220 positioned beneath an upper overflow distributor 240. Lower overflow distributor 220 comprises a trough 222. A first glass composition 224 (e.g., the core glass composition) is melted and fed into trough 222 in a viscous state. First glass composition 224 forms core layer 102 of glass sheet 100. Upper overflow distributor 240 comprises a trough 242. A second glass composition 244 (e.g., the clad glass composition) is melted and fed into trough 242 in a viscous state. Second glass composition 244 forms cladding layers 104 and 106 of glass sheet 100. [0036] First glass composition 224 overflows trough 222 and flows down opposing outer forming surfaces 226 and 228 of lower overflow distributor 220. Outer forming surfaces 226 and 228 converge at a draw line 230. The separate streams of first glass composition 224 flowing down respective outer forming surfaces 226 and 228 of lower overflow distributor 220 converge at draw line 230 where they are fused together to form core layer 102 of glass sheet 100. [0037] Second glass composition 244 overflows trough 242 and flows down opposing outer forming surfaces 246 and 248 of upper overflow distributor 240. Second glass composition 244 is deflected outward by upper overflow distributor 240 such that the second glass composition flows around lower overflow distributor 220 and contacts first glass composition 224 flowing over outer forming surfaces 226 and 228 of the lower overflow distributor. The separate streams of second glass composition 244 are fused to the respective separate streams of first glass composition 224 flowing down respective outer forming surfaces 226 and 228 of lower overflow distributor 220. Upon convergence of the streams of first glass composition 224 at draw line 230, second glass composition 244 forms cladding layers 104 and 106 of glass sheet 100. [0038] In some embodiments, glass sheet 100 is part of a glass ribbon traveling away from draw line 230 of lower overflow distributor 220 as shown in FIG. 3. The glass ribbon is severed to separate glass sheet 100 therefrom. Thus, glass sheet 100 is cut from the glass ribbon. The glass ribbon can be severed using a suitable technique such as, for example, scoring, bending, thermally shocking, and/or laser cutting. [0039] In some embodiments, the glass article (e.g., glass sheet 100 or glass sheet 1 10) comprises a thickness of at least about 0.05 mm, at least about 0.1 mm, at least about 0.2 mm, at least about 0.3 mm, or at least about 0.5 mm. Additionally, or alternatively, the glass article comprises a thickness of at most about 12.5 mm, at most about 10 mm, at most about 5 mm, at most about 3 mm, at most about 1 .5 mm, or at most about 0.5 mm. For example, the glass article comprises a thickness of from about 0.2 mm to about 12.5 mm. Additionally, or alternatively, the core (e.g., core layer 102 or core layer 1 12) comprises a thickness of from about 0.1 mm to about 12 mm. Additionally, or alternatively, the clad (e.g., each of first cladding layer 104 and second cladding layer 106) comprises a thickness of from about 0.025 mm to about 0.25 mm. [0040] In some embodiments, a ratio of a thickness of the core layer (e.g., core layer 102 or core layer 1 12) to a thickness of the glass sheet is at least about 0.7, at least about 0.8, at least about 0.85, at least about 0.9, or at least about 0.95. Additionally, or alternatively, a ratio of a thickness of inner core layer 1 12a to a thickness of core layer 1 12 is at least about 0.7, at least about 0.8, at least about 0.85, at least about 0.9, or at least about 0.95. In some embodiments, the ratio of the thickness of the core (e.g., core layer 102 or core layer 1 12) to the thickness of the clad (e.g., the combined thickness of cladding layers 104 and 106) is at least about 1 , at least about 3, at least about 5, at least about 7, or at least about 9. Additionally, or alternatively, the ratio of the thickness of the core to the thickness of the clad is at most about 20, at most about 15, or at most about 10. [0041] Although glass sheet 100 shown in FIG. 1 comprises three layers, and glass sheet 1 10 shown in FIG. 2 comprises five layers, other embodiments are included in this disclosure. In other embodiments, a glass sheet can have a determined number of layers, such as two, four, or more layers. For example, one of the first cladding layer or the second cladding layer can be omitted such that the glass sheet comprises a two- layer glass sheet. A glass sheet comprising two layers can be formed using two overflow distributors positioned so that the two layers are joined while traveling away from the respective draw lines of the overflow distributors or using a single overflow distributor with a divided trough so that two glass compositions flow over opposing outer forming surfaces of the overflow distributor and converge at the draw line of the overflow distributor. A glass sheet comprising four or more layers can be formed using additional overflow distributors and/or using overflow distributors with divided troughs. Thus, a glass sheet having a determined number of layers can be formed by modifying the overflow distributor accordingly. In some embodiments, one or more intermediate layers are disposed between the core layer and a cladding layer. Thus, the cladding layers can be exterior layers regardless of the total number of layers included in the laminated glass sheet. [0042] In some embodiments, the glass article can be configured as a glass rod or filament comprising an elongate core and a cladding layer disposed about the core. The glass article can have a suitable cross-sectional shape such as, for example, circular, elliptical, triangular, rectangular, or another polygonal or non-polygonal shape. [0043] In some embodiments, the glass article comprises a pristine outer surface. The pristine outer surface is substantially smooth and uniform. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 1 , glass sheet 100 comprises pristine (i.e., substantially smooth and uniform) outer surfaces (i.e., the outer surfaces of first and second cladding layers 104 and 106). Similarly, in the embodiment shown in FIG. 2, glass sheet 1 10 comprises pristine outer surfaces (i.e., the outer surfaces of first and second cladding layers 1 14 and 1 16). In some embodiments, the pristine outer surfaces of the glass sheet are formed without grinding or polishing. For example, the pristine outer surfaces are formed during the fusion-draw process as described herein. The pristine outer surfaces can be a result of the lack of contact between the outer surfaces and apparatus 200 during formation of the glass sheet. [0044] In some embodiments, the core of the glass article comprises a pristine outer surface. The interface between the core and the clad is substantially smooth and uniform. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 1 , core layer 102 of glass sheet 100 comprises pristine (e.g., substantially smooth and uniform) outer surfaces (i.e., the interfaces between the core layer and each of first and second cladding layers 104 and 106). Similarly, in the embodiment shown in FIG. 2, core layer 1 12 of glass sheet 1 10 comprises pristine outer surfaces (i.e., the interfaces between the core layer and each of first and second cladding layers 1 14 and 1 16). In some embodiments, the pristine outer surfaces of the core layer are formed during the fusion-draw process as described herein. [0045] In some embodiments, the glass article is subjected to processing and/or handling during which the outer surface of the glass article is engaged by one or more glass processing units. The glass processing unit can comprise suitable equipment used during processing, transportation, and/or storage of the glass article such as, for example, a gripping unit (e.g., a suction cup or a clamp), a conveying unit (e.g., a conveyor, a cart, or a rack), a forming unit (e.g., a mold or a die), or another type of equipment that engages the glass article. FIG. 4 is a partial cross-sectional view of the glass article shown in FIG. 1 following engagement by a processing unit. Engagement of the glass article by the glass processing unit may damage the outer surface of the glass article so that the outer surface of the glass article is no longer pristine. For example, in some embodiments, the outer surface of the glass article comprises defects (e.g., indentations, protrusions, or scratches) following engagement by the processing unit such that the outer surface is non-smooth and/or non-uniform. [0046] In some embodiments, the outer surface of glass sheet 100 is contacted by a forming unit. The forming unit comprises a formed surface, and glass sheet 100 is maintained at a sufficiently high temperature that contacting the glass sheet with the forming unit imparts a shape to the glass sheet that is complementary to the shape of the formed surface. The forming unit engages glass sheet 100 to form a molded glass article. In some embodiments, the formed surface of the forming unit comprises imperfections (e.g., indentations or protrusions) that impart defects to the outer surface of glass sheet 100 during forming of the molded glass article. The imperfections on the formed surface can be the result, for example, of manufacturing defects, wear on the formed surface caused by repeated use, or foreign material disposed on the formed surface. In some embodiments, the outer surface of glass sheet 100 is no longer pristine following engagement by the forming unit. For example, the molded glass article comprises a non-smooth and/or non-uniform outer surface as shown in FIG. 4 following engagement by the forming unit. [0047] In some embodiments, the defects on the outer surface of the glass article are confined to the clad and do not extend into the core. For example, the defects are confined to first cladding layer 104 and/or second cladding layer 106 and do not extend into core layer 102 as shown in FIG. 4. The clad protects the core from damage during handling and/or processing. In some embodiments, the clad is partially or substantially entirely removed from the core to expose the outer surface of the core. FIG. 5 is a partial cross-sectional view of the glass article shown in FIGS. 1 and 4 following removal of the clad. The damaged clad is removed from the core to expose the pristine outer surface of the core. For example, in some embodiments, first cladding layer 104 and second cladding layer 106 are removed from core layer 102 to expose the outer surface of the core layer as shown in FIG. 5. The exposed outer surface of core layer 102 comprises a pristine surface. Removing first and second cladding layers 104 and 106 removes the defects in the first and second cladding layers from the glass article, leaving the glass article with a pristine surface substantially free of the defects imparted to the glass article by the processing unit. [0048] FIG. 6 illustrates a simulated response of glass sheet 100 to being contacted with one exemplary embodiment of a forming surface 300 comprising a protrusion 302. In some embodiments, first cladding layer 104 at least partially absorbs the effect of protrusion 302, thereby minimizing the defect of core layer 102 at the interface between the core layer and the first cladding layer resulting from protrusion 302. In other words, the defect in core layer 102 at the interface is wider and smaller in amplitude compared to the defect in first cladding layer 104 at the surface of glass sheet 100 resulting from protrusion 302. [0049] The size of the defect in the core layer resulting from the protrusion on the forming surface relative to the size of the protrusion depends on a core to clad viscosity ratio and the clad thickness. FIGS. 7 and 8 are graphical illustrations of predicted clad thickness sufficient to avoid a visible defect in core layer 102 resulting from protrusion 302 on forming surface 300. The data presented in FIG. 7 are calculated based on protrusion 302 having an amplitude of 5 μιτι and a width of 20 μιτι. The visibility of the defect in the core layer is related to the slope of the defect. Curve 310 corresponds to the defect in core layer 102 having a slope of 1/1000. Curve 312 corresponds to the defect in core layer 102 having a slope of 1/5000. The data presented in FIG. 8 are calculated based on protrusion 302 having an amplitude of 20 μιτι and a width of 20 μιτι. Curve 320 corresponds to the defect in core layer 102 having a slope of 1/1000. Curve 322 corresponds to the defect in core layer 102 having a slope of 1/5000. FIGS. 7-8 illustrate that the clad thickness sufficient to avoid a visible defect in the core decreases as the core to clad viscosity ratio increases. Thus, a thinner clad is sufficient to avoid a visible defect in the core at higher core to clad viscosity ratios. [0050] In some embodiments, at least one of the clad thickness or the core to clad viscosity ratio is adjusted based on a surface condition of the forming surface. For example, the surface condition comprises an expected protrusion size or surface roughness. Thus, the clad thickness and/or the core to clad viscosity ratio is adjusted based on the surface condition of the forming surface to achieve a core that is substantially free of visible defects. For example, the core layer can be made more resistant to visible defects by increasing the core viscosity, decreasing the clad viscosity, and/or increasing the clad thickness. The ability to adjust the resistance of the core layer to visible defects can enable the glass sheet to be tailored to a mold surface. For example, the core viscosity can be increased with increasing mold wear. Additionally, or alternatively, the clad viscosity can be decreased with increasing mold wear. Additionally, or alternatively, the clad thickness can be increased with increasing mold wear. The mold wear can represent, for example, the length of time that a mold is in service or a number of glass articles formed in the mold. [0051] In some embodiments, glass sheet 1 10 is engaged by a glass processing unit as described herein with reference to glass sheet 100. For example, the outer surface of glass sheet 1 10 is contacted by a forming unit that imparts defects to the outer surface of the glass sheet during forming of the molded glass article. In some embodiments, the defects are confined to first cladding layer 1 14 and/or second cladding layer 1 16 and do not extend into core layer 1 12. In some embodiments, first cladding layer 1 14 and second cladding layer 1 16 are at least partially removed from core layer 1 12 to expose the outer surface of the core layer, which can comprise a pristine surface. [0052] Protection of the core by the clad can prevent damage from being caused to the core of the glass article during handling and/or processing. Damage caused to the glass article can be removed by removing the clad. Protection of the core by the clad can enable use of a forming unit with imperfections on the formed surface thereof. This can lengthen the amount of time that the forming unit can be used before replacement or repair or reconditioning of the formed surface (i.e., the useful life of the forming unit). Protection of the core by the clad can enable production of the molded glass article with a pristine outer surface without grinding or polishing the molded glass article. [0053] In some embodiments, the clad is less durable than the core. For example, in the embodiment shown in FIG. 1 , first cladding layer 104 and second cladding layer 106 are less durable than core layer 102. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 2, first cladding layer 1 14 and second cladding layer 1 16 are less durable than first outer core layer 1 12b and second outer core layer 1 12c. In some embodiments, inner core layer 1 12a is enveloped within first and second outer core layers 1 12b and 1 12c. Because inner core layer 1 12a is protected by first and second outer core layers 1 12b and 1 12c, the inner core layer can be more durable or less durable than first and second cladding layers 1 14 and 1 16 or first and second outer core layers 1 12b and 1 12c. The clad glass composition (e.g., of first and second cladding layers 104 and 106 or of first and second cladding layers 1 14 and 1 16) comprises a greater degradation rate in a reagent than the core glass composition (e.g., of core layer 102 or of first and second outer core layers 1 12b and 1 12c). In some embodiments, the degradation rate of the clad glass composition in the reagent is at least 10 times greater than the degradation rate of the core glass composition in the reagent. In some embodiments, the glass article is contacted with the reagent to remove at least a portion of the clad from the core and expose the outer surface of the core. The difference in durability between the clad and the core can enable the clad to be removed from the core by contacting the glass article with the reagent to degrade or dissolve the clad without substantially degrading or dissolving the core. [0054] The reagent comprises a suitable component capable of degrading or dissolving the glass article (e.g., the clad and/or the core). For example, the reagent comprises an acid, a base, another suitable component, or a combination thereof. In some embodiments, the reagent comprises an acid such as, for example, a mineral acid (e.g., HCI, HNO3, H2SO4, H3PO4, H3BO3, HBr, HCIO4, or HF), a carboxylic acid (e.g., CH3COOH), or a combination thereof. For example, in some embodiments, the reagent comprises HCI (e.g., 50 vol % HCI in water). Additionally, or alternatively, the reagent comprises HNO3. In some embodiments, the reagent comprises a base such as, for example, LiOH, NaOH, KOH, RbOH, CsOH, Ca(OH)2, Sr(OH)2, Ba(OH)2, or a combination thereof. [0055] In some embodiments, the reagent is substantially free of HF. HF reacts with many different oxides, and therefore, is highly reactive with most glass compositions. For example, HF reacts with silicon dioxide to form gaseous or water-soluble silicon fluorides. Contacting the core of the glass article with a reagent comprising HF may result in reaction of the HF with the core, which can cause roughening or marring of the core surface. Using a reagent that is substantially free of HF may prevent substantial reaction of the reagent with the core to enable removal of the clad from the core without damaging the core surface. [0056] In some embodiments, the glass article is contacted with the reagent to at least partially remove the clad from the core as described herein. Upon removal of the clad, the core can be at least partially exposed. For example, the core is at least partially exposed in response to contacting the laminated glass article with the reagent for at least about 0.1 hr, at least about 0.5 hr, at least about 1 hr, or at least about 2 hr. Additionally, or alternatively, the core is at least partially exposed in response to contacting the laminated glass article with the reagent for at most about 10 hr, at most about 5 hr, or at most about 2 hr. The conditions under which the glass article is contacted with the reagent (e.g., the concentration of the reagent, the temperature, and/or the use of ultrasonic agitation) can be adjusted to adjust the rate of degradation of the clad. [0057] In some embodiments, the reagent comprises a first reagent and a second reagent. The glass article is contacted with the first reagent to remove a first portion of the clad from the core and then contacted with the second reagent to remove a second portion of the clad from the core. In some embodiments, the first reagent comprises HF. The glass article is contacted with the first reagent for a sufficiently short time that the core remains substantially enveloped within the clad after contacting the glass article with the first reagent and before contacting the glass article with the second reagent. The first reagent comprising HF can be used to degrade the first portion of the clad relatively quickly without contacting the core with the first reagent, which can damage the outer surface of the core. In some embodiments, the second reagent is substantially free of HF. Additionally, or alternatively, the degradation rate of the clad in the second reagent is greater than the degradation rate of the core in the second reagent as described herein. The core can be contacted with the second reagent (e.g., following removal of the second portion of the clad) without damaging the outer surface of the core. [0058] In some embodiments, the outer surface of the core is contacted by the reagent following removal of the clad (e.g., substantially complete or partial removal of the clad). Although the core is more durable than the clad, in some embodiments, the reagent degrades the core to some degree. Upon contacting the core with the reagent, at least a portion of the core can be degraded by the reagent such that an outermost portion of the outer surface of the core is removed. For example, the removed outermost portion is up to about 1 μιτι thick. This can aid in strengthening the core, for example, by blunting fracture tips at the surface of the core. [0059] In some embodiments, ion exchange is caused between the clad and the core. Smaller cations (e.g., monovalent alkali metal cations or divalent alkaline earth metal cations) present in the core (e.g., core layer 102 or first and second outer core layers 1 12b and 1 12c) are replaced with larger cations (e.g., monovalent alkali metal cations, divalent alkaline earth metal cations, or Ag+) present in the clad (e.g., first and second cladding layers 104 and 106 or first and second cladding layers 1 14 and 1 16). For example, in some embodiments, Na+ present in the core is replaced with K+ present in the clad. The smaller cations and the larger cations can have the same valence or oxidation state. The replacement of smaller cations with larger cations creates a surface layer in the core that is under compression or compressive stress (CS). The surface layer extends into the interior or bulk of the core to a depth of layer (DOL). This can aid in increasing the strength of the glass article following removal of the clad. The compressive stress in the surface layer is balanced by a tensile stress (TS) or central tension in an interior region of the core. The ion exchange can be caused by a suitable method such as, for example, heating the glass article prior to removing the clad from the core. [0060] In some embodiments, the first and second outer core layers 1 12b and 1 12c are ion exchangeable. Thus, the glass article can be subjected to an ion exchange process after removal of the clad to create a surface layer in the outer core layers that is under compression or compressive stress. The ion exchange process can include a suitable ion exchange process including, for example, contacting the glass article with a molten salt. [0061] In some embodiments, each of the core glass composition and the clad glass composition comprises properties (e.g., liquidus viscosity, liquidus temperature, and CTE) suitable for formation of the glass article (e.g., the laminated glass sheet 100 or the laminated glass sheet 1 10) using a fusion-draw process as described herein. Additionally, or alternatively, the clad glass composition is less durable than the core glass composition as described herein. [0062] In some embodiments, the core glass composition comprises from about 62 mol % to about 77 mol % S1O2. Additionally, or alternatively, the core glass composition comprises from about 2 mol % to about 13 mol % AI2O3. Additionally, or alternatively, the core glass composition comprises from about 0 mol % to about 10 mol % B2O3. Additionally, or alternatively, the core glass composition comprises an alkali metal oxide selected from the group consisting of Na2O, K2O, and combinations thereof. For example, the core glass composition comprises from about 0 mol % to about 15 mol % Na2O and/or from about 0 mol % to about 12 mol % K2O. Additionally, or alternatively, the core glass composition comprises an alkaline earth oxide selected from the group consisting of CaO, MgO, SrO, BaO, and combinations thereof. For example, the core glass composition comprises from about 0 mol % to about 1 mol % CaO, from about 2 mol % to about 7 mol % MgO from about 0 mol % to about 7 mol % SrO, and/or from about 0 mol % to about 3 mol % BaO. Additionally, or alternatively, the core glass composition comprises from about 0 mol % to about 1 mol % SnO2. In some embodiments, the difference between the alkali metal oxide (R2O) concentration of the core glass composition and the AI2O3 concentration of the core glass composition is from about 1 to about 9. [0063] Although exemplary embodiments of the core glass composition are described herein, the core glass composition can comprise suitable components in suitable amounts such that the core glass composition is compatible with the clad glass composition for formation of the glass article as described herein. For example, the liquidus viscosity, liquidus temperature, and/or CTE of the core glass composition relative to those of the clad glass composition can enable formation of the glass article using a fusion-draw process as described herein. Also for example, the core glass composition can be more durable in the reagent than the clad glass composition as described herein. Thus, the core glass composition is not limited to the exemplary embodiments described herein. [0064] In the embodiments described herein, the clad glass composition comprises S1O2, which can serve as a glass network former. For example, the second glass composition comprises from about 45 mol % to about 60 mol % S1O2. If the concentration of S1O2 is too low, the clad glass composition can be incompatible with Zr, which is a common component found in fusion-draw equipment (e.g., in refractory). If the concentration of S1O2 is too high, the clad glass composition can have an undesirably high durability and can have a sufficiently high melting point to adversely impact the formability of the glass. [0065] In the embodiments described herein, the clad glass composition comprises AI2O3, which can serve as a glass network former. For example, the clad glass composition comprises from about 8 mol % to about 19 mol % AI2O3. The presence of AI2O3 can reduce the liquidus temperature of the clad glass composition, thereby increasing the liquidus viscosity of the clad glass composition. If the concentration of AI2O3 is too low, the clad glass composition can be undesirably soft (e.g., the strain point can be undesirably low) and can have an undesirably high CTE. If the concentration of AI2O3 IS too high, the clad glass composition can be incompatible with Zr and can have an undesirably high durability. [0066] In some embodiments, the clad glass composition comprises B2O3, which can serve as a glass network former. For example, the clad glass composition comprises from about 0 mol % to about 25 mol % B2O3. The presence of B2O3 can reduce the durability of the second glass composition. Additionally, or alternatively, the presence of B2O3 can reduce the viscosity and the liquidus temperature of the clad glass composition. For example, increasing the concentration of B2O3 by 1 mol % can decrease the temperature required to obtain an equivalent viscosity by about 10°C to about 14°C, depending on the glass composition. However, increasing the concentration of B2O3 by 1 mol % can lower the liquidus temperature by about 18°C to about 22°C, depending on the glass composition. Thus, B2O3 can reduce the liquidus temperature of the glass composition more rapidly than it decreases the liquidus viscosity. If the concentration of B2O3 is too low, the clad glass composition can have an undesirably high durability. If the concentration of B2O3 is too high, the clad glass composition can be undesirably soft. [0067] In some embodiments, the clad glass composition comprises an alkali metal oxide selected from the group consisting of Li2O, Na2O, K2O, Rb2O, CS2O, and combinations thereof. For example, the clad glass composition comprises from about 0 mol % to about 8 mol % Li2O. Additionally, or alternatively, the clad glass composition comprises from about 0 mol % to about 21 mol % Na2O. Additionally, or alternatively, the clad glass composition comprises from about 0 mol % to about 12 mol % K2O. The alkali metal oxide can serve as a modifier. For example, the presence of Na2O can reduce the melting temperature of the clad glass composition, which can enhance the formability of the clad glass composition. In embodiments comprising Na2O, if the concentration of Na2O is too low, the clad glass composition can have an undesirably high durability. If the concentration of Na2O is too high, the core glass composition can have an undesirably high CTE. [0068] In some embodiments, the clad glass composition comprises an alkaline earth oxide selected from the group consisting of CaO, MgO, SrO, and combinations thereof. For example, the clad glass composition comprises from about 0 mol % to about 10 mol % CaO. Additionally, or alternatively, the clad glass composition comprises from about 0 mol % to about 2 mol % MgO. Additionally, or alternatively, the clad glass composition comprises from about 0 mol % to about 2 mol % SrO. [0069] In some embodiments, the clad glass composition comprises a fining agent selected from the group consisting of SnO2, Sb2O3, Ce2O3, CI (e.g., derived from KCI or NaCI), and combinations thereof. For example, the clad glass composition comprises from about 0 mol % to about 0.1 mol % SnO2. [0070] In some embodiments, the clad glass composition comprises P2O5. For example, the clad glass composition comprises from about 0 mol % to about 10 mol % [0071] In some embodiments, the clad glass composition comprises trace amounts of ZrO2. For example, the clad glass composition comprises from about 0 mol % to about 0.02 mol % ZrO2. [0072] In some embodiments, the clad glass composition is substantially free of any or all of Pb, As, Cd, and Ba (i.e., constituents comprising the listed elements). For example, the clad glass composition is substantially free of Pb. Additionally, or alternatively, the clad glass composition is substantially free of As. Additionally, or alternatively, the clad glass composition is substantially free of Cd. Additionally, or alternatively, the clad glass composition is substantially free of Ba. [0073] In some embodiments, the glass article can be formed using a fusion-draw process as described herein. In some embodiments, the CTE of the clad glass composition is less than or equal to the CTE of the core glass composition. For example, the CTE of the clad glass composition is from about 0 x 10"7/°C to about 50 x 10"7/°C less than the CTE of the core glass composition, from about 0 x 10"7/°C to about 30 x 10"7/°C less than the CTE of the core glass composition, or from about 0 x 10"7/°C to about 10 x 10"7/°C less than the CTE of the core glass composition. In some embodiments, the clad glass composition comprises a CTE of from about 50 x 10"7/°C to about 95 x 10"7/°C. In some embodiments, a liquidus viscosity of the clad glass composition is at least about 50 kP, at least about 80 kP, or at least about 100 kP. [0074] In some embodiments, the core layer of the glass article comprises a plurality of layers. For example, in the embodiment shown in FIG. 2, the core layer comprises three layers. In some of such embodiments, the CTE of the outer core glass composition is less than or equal to the CTE of the inner core glass composition. For example, the CTE of the outer core glass composition is from about 0 x 10"7/°C to about 50 x 10"7/°C less than the CTE of the inner core glass composition, from about 0 x 10"7/°C to about 30 x 10"7/°C less than the CTE of the inner core glass composition, or from about 0 x 10"7/°C to about 10 x 10"7/°C less than the CTE of the inner core glass composition. Thus, the first and second outer core layers 1 12b and 1 12c comprise a compressive stress, and inner core layer 1 12a comprises a tensile stress as a result of the CTE mismatch between the first and second outer core layers and the inner core layer. The compressive stress can aid in strengthening the glass article following removal of the clad to expose the core. In other words, the core comprises a strengthened core. In some embodiments, the CTE of each of the clad glass composition and the outer core glass composition is less than or equal to the CTE of the inner core glass composition. [0075] In some embodiments, a ratio of the degradation rate of the clad glass composition in the reagent to the degradation rate of the core glass composition in the reagent is at least about 10, at least about 100, or at least about 1000. The degradation rate can be expressed, for example, in terms of weight loss relative to the original weight of the sample after contact with the reagent for a given period of time, in terms of weight loss per surface area of the sample per unit of time upon contact with the reagent, or another suitable manner. For example, the degradation rate of the clad glass composition, expressed in terms of weight loss relative to the original weight of the sample after contact by a 50 vol % aqueous HCI solution at 60°C in an ultrasonic bath for 30 min, is at least about 0.9 %, at least about 5 %, at least about 10 %, or at least about 20 %. Additionally, or alternatively, the degradation rate of the clad glass composition, expressed in terms of weight loss relative to the original weight of the sample after contact by a 50 vol % aqueous HCI solution at 60°C in an ultrasonic bath for 30 min, is at most about 30 %. Additionally, or alternatively, the degradation rate of the core glass composition, expressed in terms of weight loss relative to the original weight of the sample after contact by a 50 vol % aqueous HCI solution at 60°C in an ultrasonic bath for 30 min, is at most about 2 %, at most about 0.1 %, or at most about 0.01 %. [0076] Based on the foregoing, it should be understood that various embodiments of relatively low durability glass compositions (e.g., for use as the clad glass composition of the glass article) are disclosed herein. In one exemplary embodiment, the clad glass composition comprises from about 45 mol % to about 60 mol % S1O2, from about 13 mol % to about 19 mol % AI2O3, from about 5 mol % to about 23 mol % B2O3, and from about 3 mol % to about 21 mol % Na2O. Additionally, or alternatively, the degradation rate of the clad glass composition, expressed in terms of weight loss relative to the original weight of the sample after contact by a 50 vol % aqueous HCI solution at 60°C in an ultrasonic bath for 30 min, is from about 0.9 % to about 29 %. Additionally, or alternatively, the degradation rate of the clad glass composition is at least 10 times greater than the degradation rate of the core glass composition. [0077] In another exemplary embodiment, the clad glass composition comprises from about 55 mol % to about 59 mol % SiO2, from about 12 mol % to about 16 mol % AI2O3, from about 13 mol % to about 17 mol % B2O3, and from about 12 mol % to about 16 mol % Na2O. Additionally, or alternatively, the degradation rate of the clad glass composition, expressed in terms of weight loss relative to the original weight of the sample after contact by a 50 vol % aqueous HCI solution at 60°C in an ultrasonic bath for 30 min, is from about 1 % to about 3 %. Additionally, or alternatively, the degradation rate of the clad glass composition is at least 10 times greater than the degradation rate of the core glass composition. [0078] In another exemplary embodiment, the clad glass composition comprises from about 47 mol % to about 51 mol % SiO2, from about 13 mol % to about 17 mol % AI2O3, from about 17 mol % to about 21 mol % B2O3, from about 13 mol % to about 17 mol % Na2O, and from about 0 mol % to about 4 mol % CaO. Additionally, or alternatively, the degradation rate of the clad glass composition, expressed in terms of weight loss relative to the original weight of the sample after contact by a 50 vol % aqueous HCI solution at 60°C in an ultrasonic bath for 30 min, is from about 22 % to about 25 %. Additionally, or alternatively, the degradation rate of the clad glass composition is at least 10 times greater than the degradation rate of the core glass composition. [0079] In some embodiments, a display (e.g., an LED or LCD display) comprises a glass article as described herein. For example, the display comprises a cover glass comprising the glass article. In some embodiments, the cover glass comprises an integrated cover glass and color filter. In some embodiments, the cover glass comprises an integrated touch cover glass. [0080] In some embodiments, an automotive glazing comprises a glass article as described herein. The automotive glazing comprises, for example, a windshield, a sidelite (e.g., a door glass or a quarter window), a sun roof, a moon roof, a rear backlite, or another suitable glass or window. [0081] In some embodiments, an architectural panel comprises a glass article as described herein.

[0087] A glass article is formed as described herein and comprises a core formed from an exemplary core glass composition (e.g., Sample 1 -1 to 1 -4) and a clad formed from an exemplary clad glass composition (e.g., Sample 2-1 to 2-68). Example 1 [0088] A glass article comprising a core formed from the core glass composition of Sample 1 -2 and a clad formed from the clad glass composition of Sample 2-13 is formed. The ratio of the degradation rate of the clad glass composition in the selected reagent to the degradation rate of the core glass composition in the selected reagent is about 213. The CTE of the clad glass composition is about 10.6 x 10"7/°C less than the CTE of the core glass composition. [0089] FIG. 9 is a graphical representation of predicted clad thickness sufficient to avoid a visible defect in the core of the glass article as a function of the amplitude and the width of a protrusion on a forming surface. For the purposes of FIG. 9, a visible defect is a defect having a slope of greater than 1/5000. The core to clad viscosity ratio is assumed to be 7.5. Example 2 [0090] A glass article comprising a core formed from the core glass composition of Sample 1 -2 and a clad formed from the clad glass composition of Sample 2-49 is formed. The ratio of the degradation rate of the clad glass composition in the selected reagent to the degradation rate of the core glass composition in the selected reagent is about 2285. The CTE of the clad glass composition is about 3.6 x 10"7/°C less than the CTE of the core glass composition. Example 3 [0091] A glass sheet having the general structure shown in FIG. 1 was formed. The core was formed from the core glass composition of Sample 1 -2, and the clad was formed from the clad glass composition of Sample 2-13. The glass sheet had a thickness of 1 mm. The ratio of the core layer thickness to the clad layer thickness was about 7. [0092] FIG. 10 is a graphical representation of the degradation rates of each of the core glass composition and the clad glass composition, expressed as etch thickness as a function of time. For the purposes of FIG. 10, etch thickness is the reduction in thickness of the glass sheet in response to exposure of the glass sheet to a static 50 vol % aqueous HCI solution at room temperature. The degradation rate of the core glass composition is represented by diamond-shaped data points 330. The degradation rate of the clad glass composition is represented by circular data points 332. Thus, as shown in FIG. 10, the ratio of the degradation rate of the clad glass composition to the degradation rate of the core glass composition was greater than about 2000. [0093] The glass sheet was formed into a molded glass article using a vacuum mold. FIG. 11 is a photograph of the molded glass article. As shown in FIG. 11 , the molded glass article had a dished shape comprising a substantially planar central region encompassed by a curved lip. The molded glass article had a hazy or cloudy appearance. Without wishing to be bound by any theory, it is believed that the haziness is a result of the contact between the clad and the mold. [0094] The clad was removed from the molded glass article by exposing the molded glass article to a reagent. FIG. 12 is a photograph of the molded glass article following removal of the clad. The molded glass article had a clear appearance following removal of the clad. In other words, the haziness evident in FIG. 11 does not appear in FIG. 12. [0095] This example demonstrates that it is possible to mold a glass article and then etch the molded glass article to reveal a pristine core surface with little or no polishing following the etching process. Because visible surface damage is removed from the molded glass article during removal of the clad, such a molding and etching process can enable extended mold lifetimes, as more damage can be tolerated from the mold. [0096] Because the core glass composition in this example is ion exchangeable, the molded glass article can be subjected to an ion exchange process following removal of the clad. This can aid in strengthening the molded glass article. Example 4 [0097] A glass sheet having the general structure shown in FIG. 1 was formed as described in Example 3. The glass sheet had a thickness of 2 mm. [0098] The glass sheet was formed into a molded glass article by pressing the glass sheet into a graphite mold with a plunger. The molded glass article had a deep dished shape comprising a substantially planar central region encompassed by a curved lip. The bend between the central region and the lip was near 90°. The clad was removed from about half of the molded glass article by exposing the molded glass article to a reagent. FIG. 13 is a photograph of the molded glass article following removal of the clad from half of the molded glass article. As shown in FIG. 13, the right half of the molded glass article with the clad had a hazy or cloudy appearance, and the left half of the molded glass article without the clad had a clear appearance. [0099] This example further demonstrates that it is possible to mold a glass article and then etch the molded glass article to reveal a pristine core surface with little or no polishing following the etching process, even when the glass article sustains substantial damage during the molding process. Thus, a pristine molded glass article can be formed using a relatively low quality mold. Example 5 [00100] A glass sheet having the general structure shown in FIG. 1 was formed as described in Example 3. The glass sheet had a thickness of 1 mm. The core layer had a thickness of about 0.8 mm. Each of the first and second cladding layers had a thickness of about 0.1 mm. [00101] The glass sheet was formed into molded glass article by sagging the glass sheet onto an outer surface of a cylindrical fused silica substrate. FIG. 14 is a photograph of the molded glass article. As shown in FIG. 14, the molded glass article had a continuous curved shape. The molded glass article had a hazy or cloudy appearance. [00102] The clad was removed from the molded glass article by exposing the molded glass article to a reagent. FIG. 15 is a photograph of the molded glass article following removal of the clad. The molded glass article had a clear appearance following removal of the clad. [00103] This example further demonstrates that it is possible to mold a glass article and then etch the molded glass article to reveal a pristine core surface with little or no polishing following the etching process. [00104] It will be recognized that each exemplary clad glass composition may not be suitable for use with each exemplary core glass composition to form a glass article within the scope of some of the embodiments described herein. For example, the exemplary clad glass composition of Sample 2-68 has a relatively low degradation rate (e.g., less than 0.9 %), and therefore, may not be suitable for use with the each exemplary core glass composition (e.g., Samples 1 -1 or 1 -2) to form a glass article in which the ratio of the degradation rate of the second glass composition to the degradation rate of the first glass composition is at least 10 as described herein with respect to some embodiments. Also for example, the exemplary clad glass compositions of Samples 2-65 to 2-67 have relatively low liquidus viscosities (e.g., less than 50 kP), and therefore, may not be suitable for forming a glass article using a fusion draw process as described herein with respect to some embodiments. [00105] It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention. Accordingly, the invention is not to be restricted except in light of the attached claims and their equivalents. 1 .
