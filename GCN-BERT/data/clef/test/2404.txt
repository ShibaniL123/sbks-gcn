Methods of treating proliferative diseases or FLT-3 mediated diseases in humans, including a specific patient population are also provided. BACKGROUND [0003] Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3), which is also known as FLK-2 (fetal liver kinase 2) and STK-l (stem cell kinase I), plays an important role in the proliferation, and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells. FLT3 receptor kinase is expressed in normal hematopoietic cells, placenta, gonads, and brain. However, this enzyme is expressed in acute myeloid leukemia cells in approximately 90% of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients and in acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells in a fraction of acute lymphoblastic- leukemia (ALL) patients. This enzyme can also be found on cells from patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in lymphoid blast crisis, [0004] It has been reported that PLT3 kinase is mutated in 30% of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and in a subset of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) as well (Gilliland et αℓ., Blood 2WI, 100f .1532-1542; Stirewaltet αℓ.,Ναΐ. Rev. Cancer2003, 3,650-665). The most common activating mutations in FLT3 are internal tandem duplications (IT'D) found within the juxtamomhraae region. The FLT3 ITD mutation has been associated with poor prognosis (Fmhling et αℓ, Blood2002,./0θ, 4372-4380), The second most frequent acti vating mutation of FLT3 is the niissense mutation in the tyrosine kinase domain, mainly at D835 within the activation loop of the tyrosine kinase domain (Yamamoto et ak, Blood2001,97, 2434-2439). In addition, many non-mutated FLT3 patients show evidence of FLT3 activation. The association of FLT3 mutations with poor clinical outcome and the therapeutic effects observed in early stage clinical trials with first generation FLT3 inhibitors strongly implicate FLT3 as an important target for small molecule intervention in AML. [0005] More than a dozen known FLT3 inhibitors are being developed and some have shown promising clinical effects against AML (Levis et αℓ. Int. J. Hematol.2005,82, 100-107). It has been reported that some of small-molecule FLT3 inhibitors are effective in inducing apoptosis in cell lines with FLT3-activating mutations and prolonging survival of mice that express mutated FLT3 in their bone marrow cells (Levis et αℓ., Blood2002,99, 3885-3891; Kelly et αℓ., Cancer Cell2002,1, 421-432; Weisberg et αℓ., Cancer Cell2002,1, 433-443; Yee et αℓ., Blood2002,100, 2941-2949). [0006] Despite the success in identification of small molecules that inhibit protein tyrosine kinases, there continues to be an effective method of using or administering such compounds, particularly to humans having AML and ALL, including compounds useful for the treatment of FLT-3 mediated diseases. Methods with improved therapeutic index, i.e, where adverse or unwanted effects of therapy are reduced while efficacy is maintained, are sought.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION [0022] To facilitate understanding of the disclosure set forth herein, a number of terms are defined below. [0023] The term “remission” refers to where a subject has abatement or lessening of the severity of disease or its symptoms. [0024] The term “complete remission” or CR as it refers to leukemia means a subject has achieved one or more of the following criteria: 1) a morphologic leukemia-free state with no evidence of extramedullary leukemia 2) an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of more than 1 x 109/L and platelet count of more than 100x 109/L 3) normal marrow differential with less than 5% blasts and 4) independence from red blood cell (RBC) and platelet transfusions. In certain embodiments, a subject in CR has achieved criterion 1, or criteria 1 and 3, or criteria 1, 2, and 3. In certain embodiments, a subject in CR has achieved criterion 1, or criteria 1 and 3, or criteria 1, 2, 3 and 4. See, e.g., the recommendations of the International Working Group in 2003 (Cheson et αℓ. J. Clin. Oncol.200321(24): 4642-4649). The definition of “complete remission” is expected to evolve as newer and more sensitive technologies are developed to measure leukemic burden. Other categories of patients who fulfill the morphologic criteria for complete remission are as follows: “complete remission with incomplete platelet recovery (CRp)” where a subject fulfills all of the criteria for CR except for the platelet count, which is less than 100X109/L and “complete remission with incomplete hematological recovery (CRi), where a subject fulfills all of the criteria for CR except for the neutrophil count, which is less than 1 χ 109/L. “Partial remission” or “PR” is used to describe the condition where a subject has achieved the hematological values for a CR and a decrease of least 50% in the percentage of blasts in the bone marrow aspirate to 5% to 25%. [0025] The terms “FLT3-mediated diseases or disorders” shall include diseases associated with or implicating FLT3 activity, for example, the overactivity of FLT3, and conditions that accompany with these diseases. The term “overactivity of FLT3” refers to either 1) FLT3 expression in cells which normally do not express FLT3; 2) FLT3 expression by cells which normally do not express FLT3; 3) increased FLT3 expression leading to unwanted cell proliferation; or 4) mutations leading to constitutive activation of FLT3. Examples of “FLT3-mediated diseases or disorders” include disorders resulting from over stimulation of FLT3 or from abnormally high amount of FLT3 activity, due to abnormally high amount of FLT3 or mutations in FLT3. It is known that overactivity of FLT3 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of a number of diseases, including inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, cell proliferative disorders, neoplastic disorders and cancers as described herein. [0026] The term “FLT3-ITD allelic ratio” refers to the percentage of tumor DNA alleles harboring the FLT3-ITD mutation normalized to the percent blast cells in a patient sample. In one embodiment, a low FLT3-ITD allelic ratio is where less than 25% of normalized tumor DNA alleles is a FLT3-ITD allele. In certain embodiments, an intermediate FLT3-ITD allelic ratio is where between 25% and 50% of normalized tumor DNA alleles is a FLT3-ITD allele. In certain embodiments, a high FLT3-ITD allelic ratio is where greater than 50% of normalized tumor DNA alleles is a FLT3-ITD allele. [0027] The term “proliferative disorder or disease” refers to unwanted cell proliferation of one or more subset of cells in a multicellular organism resulting in harm (i.e., discomfort or decreased life expectancy) to the multicellular organisms. A proliferative disorder or disease can occur in different types of animals and humans. For example, as used herein, “proliferative disorder or disease” includes neoplastic disorders and other proliferative disorders. [0028] The term “neoplastic disorder or disease” or “cancer” refers to a tumor resulting from abnormal or uncontrolled cellular growth. Examples of neoplastic disorders include, but are not limited to, hematopoietic disorders, such as the myeloproliferative disorders, thrombocythemia, essential thrombocytosis (ΕΤ), angiogenic myeloid metaplasia, myelofibrosis (MF), myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia (ΜΜΜ), chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis (IMF), polycythemia vera (PV), the cytopenias, and pre-malignant myelodysplastic syndromes; cancers, such as glioma cancers, lung cancers, breast cancers, colorectal cancers, prostate cancers, gastric cancers, esophageal cancers, colon cancers, pancreatic cancers, ovarian cancers, or hematologic malignancies. In certain embodiments, the tumor is germ cell tumor, melanoma gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), mast cell tumor, melanoma, or neuroblastoma. [0029] The term hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, or HSCT, refers to the transplantation of hematopoietic progenitor cells into a patient. The hematopoietic progenitor cells may be obtained from bone marrow, peripheral blood, or from umbilical cord blood. In certain embodiments, the hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is allogeneic, syngeneic or autologous. In certain embodiments, the hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is allogeneic. [0030] The term “hematologic malignancy” refers to cancer of the body's bloodforming and immune system-the bone marrow and lymphatic tissue. Examples of hematological malignancies include, for instance, myelodysplasia, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), myeloproliferative disorder (MPD) (which includes polcythemia vera (PV or PCV), essential thrombocytosis (ΕΤ) and myelofibrosis), amyloid neuropathy, lymphoma (non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma), Hodgkin’s disease (also called Hodgkin’s lymphoma), multiple myeloma (MM) and its variants, and leukemia such as acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), chronic neutrophilic leukemia (CNL), acute undifferentiated leukemia (AUL), anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL), pro lymphocytic leukemia (PML), juvenile myelomonocyctic leukemia (JMML), adult T-cell ALL, AML with trilineage myelodysplasia (AML/TMDS) and mixed lineage leukemia (MLL). [0031] The term “leukemia” refers to malignant neoplasms of the blood-forming tissues, including, but not limited to, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, chronic myeloid leukemia, chronic myelocytic leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia and acute myeloblastic leukemia. The leukemia can be relapsed, refractory, or resistant to conventional therapy. [0032] The term “promyelocytic leukemia” or “acute promyelocytic leukemia” refers to a malignancy of the bone marrow in which there is a deficiency of mature blood cells in the myeloid line of cells and an excess of immature cells called promyelocytes. It is usually marked by an exchange of parts of chromosomes 15 and 17. [0033] The term “acute lymphocytic leukemia,” “acute lymphoblastic leukemia,” or “ALL” refers to a malignant disease caused by the abnormal growth and development of early nongranular white blood cell or lymphocytes. [0034] The term “T-cell leukemia” refers to a disease in which certain cells of the lymphoid system called Τ lymphocytes or Τ cells are malignant. Τ cells are white blood cells that normally can attack virus-infected cells, foreign cells, and cancer cells; and produce substances that regulate the immune response. [0035] The term MDS, or myelodysplastic syndromes, refers to a diverse set of hematological disorders characterized by the presence of at least one of the following in the bone marrow: blast cells, cytogenetic abnormalities or morphologic abnormalities (dysplasia). In one embodiment, MDS includes the five subtypes defined by the French-American-British Work Group, such as refractory anemia (RA), refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts (RARS), refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB), refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation (RAEB-T) and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) . In another embodiment, MDS includes the subtypes defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) described in Vardiman et αℓ. Blood 2002 100(7):2293-2302. [0036] The term “relapsed” refers to where a subject has a recurrence of disease or its manifestations after an improvement or being in complete remission. Relapse after CR, as defined by the International Working Group in 2003 is the reappearance of leukemic blasts in the peripheral blood or > 5 % blasts in the bone marrow aspirate not attributable to any other cause or reappearance or new appearance of extramedullary leukemia. Molecular and/or genetic relapse is characterized by reappearance of a cytogenetic or molecular abnormality. Relapse after PR is similarly defined as the reappearance of significant numbers of peripheral blasts and an increase in percentage of blasts in the bone marrow aspirate to >25% not attributable to any other cause or reappearance or new appearance of extramedullary leukemia. [0037] The term “first line cancer therapy” refers to therapy administered to a subject as an initial regimen to reduce the number of cancer cells. First line therapy is also referred to as induction therapy, primary therapy and primary treatment. Commonly administered first-line therapy for AML is cytarabine-based therapy in which cytarabine is administered often in combination with one or more agents selected from daunorubicin, idarubicin, doxorubicin, mitoxantrone, tipifamib, thioguanine or gemtuzumab ozogamicin. Common regimens used in cytarabine-based therapy include the “7 + 3” or “5 + 2” therapy comprising administration of cytarabine with an anthracycline such as daunorubicin or idarubicin. Another first-line therapy is clofarabine-based therapy in which clofarabine is administered, often in combination with an anthracycline such as daunorubicin, idarubicin or doxorubicin. Other first-line therapy for AML are etoposide-based therapy in which etoposide is administered, often in combination with mitoxantrone, and optionally, with cytarabine. Another first-line therapy for AML (for subtype M3, also called acute promyelocytic leukemia) is all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA). It is recognized that what is considered “first line therapy” by those of ordinary skill in the art will continue to evolve as new anti-cancer agents are developed and tested in the clinics. A summary of the currently accepted approaches to first line treatment is described in NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology for acute myeloid leukemia and the NCI guidelines on acute myeloid leukemia treatment (see, e.g., http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/treatment/adultAML/HealthProfessional/page7). [0038] The term “second line cancer therapy” refers to a cancer treatment that is administered to a subject who does not respond to first line therapy, that is, often first line therapy is administered or who has a recurrence of cancer after being in remission. In certain embodiments, second line therapy that may be administered includes a repeat of the initial successful cancer therapy, which may be any of the treatments described under “first line cancer therapy”. In certain embodiments, second line therapy is the administration of gemtuzumab ozogamicin. In certain embodiments, investigational drugs may also be administered as second line therapy in a clinical trial setting. A summary of the currently accepted approaches to second line treatment is described in the NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology for acute myeloid leukemia and the NCI guidelines on acute myeloid leukemia treatment (see, e.g., http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/treatment/adultAML/HealthProfessional/page5). [0039] The term “refractory” refers to wherein a subject fails to respond or is otherwise resistant to cancer therapy or treatment. The cancer therapy may be first-line, second-line or any subsequently administered treatment. In certain embodiments, refractory refers to a condition where a subject fails to achieve complete remission after two induction attempts. A subject may be refractory due to a cancer cell’s intrinsic resistance to a particular therapy, or the subject may be refractory due to an acquired resistance that develops during the course of a particular therapy. [0040] The term “primary refractory” refers to a condition where a subject does not respond to first line cancer therapy. [0041] The term “anticancer agent” is meant to include anti-proliferative agents and chemotherapeutic agents, including, but not limited to, antimetabolites (e.g., 5-fluoro uracil, methotrexate, fludarabine, cytarabine (also known as cytosine arabinoside or Ara-C), including HD AC (high dose cytarabine), gemcitabine, azacytidine, clofarabine, fludarabine and troxacitabine ), antimicrotubule agents (e.g., vinca alkaloids, such as vincristine and vinblastine; and taxanes, such as paclitaxel and docetaxel), alkylating agents (e.g., mechlorethamine, chlorambucil, cyclophosphamide, melphalan, melphalan, ifosfamide, carmustine, azacitidine, decitibine, busulfan, cyclophosphamide, dacarbazine, ifosfamide, and nitrosoureas, such as carmustine, lomustine, bischloroethylnitrosurea, and hydroxyurea), platinum agents (e.g., cisplatin, carboplatin, oxaliplatin, satraplatin (JM-216), and CI-973), anthracyclines (e.g., doxorubicin and daunorubicin), antitumor antibiotics (e.g., mitomycin, bleomycin, idarubicin, adriamycin, daunomycin (also known as daunorubicin, rubidomycin, or cerubidine), doxorubicin, mitoxantrone and pixantrone), topoisomerase inhibitors (e.g., etoposide and camptothecins), purine anatagonists, pyrimidine antagonists and nucleoside analogs (e.g., 6-mercaptopurine, 5-fluorouracil, cytarabine, clofarabine, and gemcitabine), cell maturing agents (e.g., arsenic trioxide and tretinoin), DNA repair enzyme inhibitors (e.g., podophyllotoxines, etoposide, irinotecan, topotecan, and teniposide), enzymes that prevent cell survival (e.g., asparaginase and pegaspargase), histone deacetylase inhibitors (e.g., vorinostat), any other cytotoxic agents (e.g., estramustine phosphate, dexamethasone, prednimustine, and procarbazine), hormones (e.g., dexamethasone, prednisone, methylprednisolone, tamoxifen, leuprolide, flutamide, and megestrol), monocolonal antibodies (e.g., gemtuzumab ozogamicin, alemtuzumab, rituximab, and yttrium-90-ibritumomab tiuxetan), immunomodulators (e.g., thalidomide and lenalidomide), Bcr-Abl kinase inhibitors (e.g., ΑΡ23464, AZD0530, CGP76030, PD 180970, SKI-606, imatinib, BMS354825 (dasatinib), ΑΜΝ107 (nilotinib), and VX-680), hormone agonists or antagonists, partial agonists or partial antagonists, kinase inhibitors (e.g., sorafenib, imatinib, sunitinib and other yet unmarketed kinase inhibitors), surgery, radiotherapy (e.g., gamma-radiation, neutron bean radiotherapy, electron beam radiotherapy, proton therapy, brachytherapy, and systemic radioactive isotopes), endocrine therapy, biological response modifiers (e.g., interferons, interleukins, and tumor necrosis factor), hyperthemia and cryotherapy, and agents to attenuate any adverse effects (e.g., antiemetics).

EXAMPLES Example 1: Phase Τ clinical trial [00181] This study was the first human clinical trial of the compound of Formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof in humans having relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia. The study was open labeled and designed to determine the safety, tolerability, dose limiting toxicity (DLT), pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of escalating doses. [00182] The study included adult patients with relapsed or refractory AML, or unsuitable for induction chemotherapy. Demographics and baseline characteristics were as follows: median age was 60 years, with a range of 23-86 years. Sixty percent of the patients were male. Approximately 73% of the patients had a baseline ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 and the median number of prior therapies was 4 with a range of 0 to 9. Eleven (15%) patients had prior allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) and 13 (17%) patients had secondary AML with antecedent MDS or MDS/MPD. A total of 20 patients had FLT3 mutations (17 ITD and 3 D835), 43 were wild-type, and 13 were undetermined. Drug administration [00183] The compound of N-(5-tert-butyl-isoxazol-3-yl)-N'-{4-[7-(2-morpholin-4-yl-ethoxy)imidazo[2,l-b][l,3]benzothiazol-2-yl]phenyl}urea di-hydrochloride salt was administered at 12, 18, 27, 60, 90, 135, 200, 300 and 450 mg for 14 days followed by a 14 day rest period (1 cycle). Patients with clinical benefit were allowed to continue for additional cycles at the discretion of the investigator. The protocol was subsequently amended to allow for continuous dosing of the compound starting at 200 mg on Day 1. In addition to patients included in the 200 mg (17 patients) and 300 mg (8 patients) continuous dosing cohort, there were at least 8 patients who, at the investigators discretion and per protocol, received continuous dosing after cycle 1 of intermittent dosing ranging from 19-187 days. Safety [00184] Overall, treatment with N-(5-tert-butyl-isoxazol-3-yl)-N'-(4-[7-(2- [00185] morpholin-4-yl-ethoxy)imidazo[2,1 -b][ 1,3]benzothiazol-2-yl]phenyl}urea di-hydrochloride salt was well tolerated, and the majority of adverse events observed in the study were those associated with the underlying disease and not considered related to the treatment with the compound of formula I. The frequency and type of adverse events were similar across the dose groups. In addition, the safety profile was similar between patients receiving continuous dosing and those on the intermittent schedule. These included general disorders (e.g., pyrexia and fatigue), gastrointestinal disorders (e.g., nausea, diarrhea and vomiting) and hematologic disorders (eg, anemia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia). The majority of the treatment-related adverse events were CTC Grade 1 and 2 and not considered serious. [00186] Bone marrow hypocellularity was a target organ toxicity in the animal studies however, this toxicity is difficult to assess in the ongoing AML Phase 1/2 study since tumor related myelosuppression is a prevalent AML-related disease manifestation and is present in almost all AML patients enrolled in the ongoing clinical study. In addition, evaluation of clinical chemistry biomarkers (eg, BUN, creatinine, ALT, AST, ALP, and bilirubin) for the other target organ toxicities identified in animal toxicology studies suggest there are no liver or kidney abnormalities occurring in the ongoing clinical study as drug-related serious adverse events. Serious Adverse Events [00187] Out of the 76 patients treated with the compound in this study, 38 patients (50%) reported a total of 94 serious adverse events (SAEs) (defined as CTC Grade 3 or greater). The majority of the SAEs were considered by the investigator to be not related to study treatment. Only 6 patients (7.9%) reported SAEs that were initially considered to be related to treatment with the compound. These included one patient with lung infection, one patient with vomiting and one patient with nausea, anorexia, and upper abdominal pain. The investigator subsequently revised the event of anorexia for the patient to non-serious. In addition, three patients were noted by the site investigators using local ECG analysis to have reported Grade 3 QTc prolongation of >500 ms which was considered to be a dose-limiting toxicity for the study according to the protocol. Cardiac Safety [00188] Based on the site reported dose-limiting toxicity of Grade 3 QTc prolongation, a detailed evaluation of the cardiac safety of the compound was conducted. As defined in the protocol, a single 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) had been performed using standardized equipment at the site at Visits 1 (screen), 2 (Baseline- at Hours 0, 2, and 4), 4 (Day 8 at Hours 0 and 4), and depending on the version of the protocol active at the time of assessment for each patient, 6 (Day 14 or 15), 7 (Day 21 or 22), 8 (Day 28 or 29), 9 (Day 36), 10 (Day 43), 11 (Day 50), 12 (Day 57) and at the end of the study or early termination. ECG assessments and interpretations initially were performed by the site’s cardiologist or other qualified site personnel. To improve upon the accuracy of these locally-analyzed data, a central digitized blinded analysis of all ECGs collected to date was undertaken by a core ECG laboratory (EResearchTechnology in Philadelphia, PA). Due to some issues with readability, 72 patients (out of 76 patients enrolled in the study) were included in this analysis. The data demonstrated a clear dose-related and marked QTc change at the > 200 mg dose level. However, caution must be exercised in viewing these results due to the small sample sizes and lack of intense ECG sampling. The phase I study was not designed to define the ECG effects of the compound, which will be more closely monitored in the phase II study. Deaths [00189] To date, a total of 12 patients have died during the study. All deaths were associated with the disease and/or pre-existing comorbidities and not related to treatment with the compound. Therefore, there is no 30-day treatment-related mortality reported to date. This is in contrast to other AML therapies including standard induction chemotherapy which report 30-day treatment-related mortalities of up to 30% of more than 500 ms which was considered to be the dose-limiting toxicity for the study per protocol. Efficacy [00190] Preliminary response data was evaluated in all 76 patients treated with the compound. Four of the patients on the 200 mg CD cohort and 1 patient on the 300 mg CD cohort were considered non-evaluable due to the limited duration of their treatment to date. [00191] The overall response (CR + PR) observed in all patients treated at dosed from 12 mg-450 mg was 32% (24/76) of the compound. Responses were defined per modified Cheson criteria. Ten patients achieved a complete remission (CR) defined as a decrease of < 5% blast in bone marrow: 2 complete hemologic recovery, 4 with incomplete platelet recovery (CRp) and 4 with incomplete platelet and neutrophil recovery (CRi). One of these patients also had complete resolution of leukemia cutis. Fourteen patients had partial remissions (PR) defined as a decrease of >50% blasts to levels of 5%-25% in the bone marrow but with incomplete peripheral recovery of neutrophils and platelets. Most of the patients report a bone marrow responses (15/22, 68%) within the first 29 days of treatment (defined as Cycle 1). Of the remaining 7 patients, 4 patients reported a response within 57 days (Cycle 2), 3 patients thereafter. Median duration of remission was 14.1 weeks (range, 4 to 61+ weeks). In addition, most patients had a peripheral blast reduction defined as > 25% peripheral blasts at baseline with > 50% decrease post-treatment to 0-25%. [00192] The response in the population the FLT3-ITD mutation was higher with an overall response rate of 65% (11/17) including 6 PR, 3 CRi, 1 CRp and 1 CR. Five of the 7 non-responding patients with FLT3-ITD mutations did not have a repeat bone marrow assessment, and therefore, could not be assessed for bone marrow response. [00193] All of these patients had initial rapid clearing of peripheral blasts with intermittent dosing and subsequently progressed or had disease-related mortality. The FLT3-ITD patient population had very aggressive disease and was generally heavily pretreated with a median of 4 prior treatment regimens (range, 1 to 8) including 5 patients who were previously treated with FLT3 inhibitors. [00194] All FLT3-ITD patients treated with 200 mg CD responded to treatment with an overall response rate (CR +CRp + CRi + PR) of 100% (5/5) including 1 CR, 1 CRp, lCRi and 2 PRs. The duration of response of overall CR was confounded due to dose interruption. Two patients, who had relapsed disease, subsequently responded with a CRp and CRi with the treatment with the compound and were taken off study to go to bone marrow transplant. One patient had dosing interrupted due to a disrupted drug supply. In addition, both patients reporting a PR were heavily pretreated and one was previously treated with a FLT3 inhibiting agent (sorafenib). A total of 2 of the 5 responding patients in this cohort were previously treated with sorafenib. Two additional patients in the 200 mg CD cohort reported CR and CRi but had undetermined genotype due to a lack of sufficient peripheral blasts for testing. Pharmacokinetics [00195] Plasma samples were collected at pre-dose, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 24 hr on Days 1 and 8 to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of N-(5-tert-butyl-isoxazol-3-yl)-N'-{4-[7-(2-morpholin-4-yl-ethoxy)imidazo[2,l-b][l,3]benzothiazol-2-yl]phenyl}urea di-hydrochloride salt. In addition, plasma samples were collected on day 15 (~24 hrs post final dose) to evaluate steady-state trough levels. Bioanalysis of the compound was initially conducted at Consolidated Laboratory Services (CLS), Van Nuys, CA. A similar pharmacokinetic profile was observed in all patients evaluated (η=72), with levels of the compound rising rapidly during the first day of dosing (Figure 1). The compound is orally bioavailable with a long effective half-life, estimated to be approximately 1.5 days. In addition, the compound exhibits minimal peak and trough variation of plasma levels with once daily dosing. The steady-state plasma exposure is achieved by Day 8, sustained between dose intervals and increased in a dose proportional manner from 12 mg to 450 mg daily (Figures 2Α and 2Β). The coefficient of variation (CV%) for AUCO-24 at steady-state is modest at the lowest dose of 12 mg (33%) and high for the 450 mg cohort (82%). While the variability tended to be higher at higher doses, there was not a clear relationship between variability and either dose or high-life. [00196] A pharmacologically active metabolite, compound of formula II, was identified in both preclinical species and human plasma and urine samples. [00197] N-(5-tert-Butyl-isoxazol-3-yl)-N'-{4-[7-(2-morpholin-4-yl-ethoxy)imidazo[2,l-b][l,3]benzothiazol-2-yl]phenyl}urea di-hydrochloride salt and II were subsequently analyzed in human plasma from a subset of patients (η=60) dosed with Ν-(5-tcrt-butyl-isoxazol-3-yl)-N'- (4-[7-(2-morpholin-4-yl-ethoxy)imidazo[2,1 b][l,3]benzothiazol-2-yl]phenyl}urea di-hydrochloride salt. This analysis was conducted at MicroConstants, San Diego, CA. The analysis revealed a ratio of the compounds of formula II/I as high as 3.14 in one patient, with an average steady state ratio of 0.4. Patients dosed at 200 mg the compound of formula I achieve steady-state plasma levels for the compounds of formula I and II of -1000 ng/mL and -300 ng/mL, respectively. These data from MicroConstants indicate that the compound of formula I has a long terminal Τ1/2 at 1.3 ± 0.4 days on Day 1. Pharmacodynamic Effect of N-(5-tert-butyl-isoxazol-3-yl)-N'-{4-[7-(2-morpholin-4-yl-ethoxy)imidazo[2,l-b][l,3]benzothiazol-2-yl]phenyl}urea di-hydrochloride salt [00198] Patient blood samples were drawn pre-dose and at regular intervals post-dose to determine the level of pFLT3 and other downstream markers of target inhibition in circulating blast cells. To date, pFLT3 levels have been evaluated in 41 patient samples at pre- and 24 hr post-dose time-points. The preliminary results indicate that the percentage of patients demonstrating at least 25% pFLT3 inhibition increased dramatically with increased dose of the compound (Figure 3Α). Figures 3Β and 3C show the percentage of patients demonstrating at least 50% and at least 75% pFLT3 inhibition. There was also a dose dependent increase in the degree of pFLT3 inhibition in response to the compound. In the 200 and 300 mg dose cohort, 100% of the patients achieved >25% reduction in pFLT3 activity. In addition, several patients in these two cohorts responded with a greater that 85% inhibition of pFLT3. [00199] It was not always possible to correlate bone marrow response with inhibition of pFLT3 due to the lack of follow-up bone marrow samples for some patients. However, extensive follow-up information on peripheral blast count was available for all patients. A total of 25 out of 41 patients with an assessment of pFLT3, had an evaluation on day 15. As shown in Figure 4, on day 15 of the study, after 14 days of treatment with the compound, there was a high level of correlation of the pFLT3 inhibition with reduction in peripheral blast count (R=0.65, ρ≤0.001). The magnitude of observed reduction in peripheral blasts increased with increased inhibition of pFLT3. All 8 patients harboring the FLT3-ITD mutation that were the FLT3-ITD mutation evaluated had large reductions in both pFLT3 and peripheral blasts in response to treatment with the compound (Figure 4). [00200] A subset of 17 patients has also been evaluated for the effect of N-(5-tert-butyl-isoxazol-3-yl)-N'- (4-[7-(2-morpholin-4-yl-ethoxy)imidazo[2,1 -b] [1,3]benzothiazol-2-yl]phenyl}urea di-hydrochloride salt on pSTAT5. STAT5 is a downstream signaling pathway activated by FLT3 following binding of FLT3 ligand leading to receptor dimerization, increased kinase activity and activation of downstream signaling pathways including STAT5. Although the data on pSTAT5 are very preliminary, the dose-dependent effect is consistent with that observed with pFLT3. Example 2 Preparation of N-(5-tert-butyl-isoxazol-3-yD-Nf-{4-f7-(2-morpholin-4-yl-ethoxy)imidazof2,l-bl fl,31benzothiazol-2-vllphenyllurea di-hydrochloride salt capsules 75 mg [00201] 75 mg of N-(5-tert-butyl-isoxazol-3-yl)-N'-{4-[7-(2-morpholin-4-yl-ethoxy)imidazo[2,l-b][l,3]benzothiazol-2-yl]phenyl}urea di-hydrochloride salt was suspended in a waxy matrix of lauroyl polyoxylglycerides (GELUCIRE® 44/14, Gattefosse). To produce approximately 4,000 Capsules 75 mg, a mixture of N-(5-tert-butyl-isoxazol-3-yl)N'- (4-[7-(2-morpholin-4-yl-ethoxy)imidazo[2,1 -b][ 1,3]benzothiazol-2-yl]phenyl}urea di-hydrochloride salt (300 g) and GELUCIRE® 44/14 (1,900 g) in a suitably sized jacketed vessel was stirred at approximately 70 °C until molten. The molten mixture was slowly charged into the vortex of a container and mixed until a homogeneous suspension was obtained. The suspension was maintained at a blend temperature of 70 °C and deaerated under vacuum. With gentle mixing to avoid incorporation of air, the suspension was allowed to cool to a temperature of 50 °C. The suspension was then charged into a heated hopper attached to a CAPSUGEL® CSF1200 or similar encapsulation machine. Each capsule was filled with the suspension to an average weight of 550 mg. The finished capsules were allowed to cool prior to packaging into appropriate containers. Example 3 Preparation of N-(5-tert-butyl-isoxazol-3-vl)-Nf-{4-[7-(2-morpholin-4-yl-ethoxvMmidazo[2,l-bl[l,31benzothiazol-2-vllphenyllurea di-hydrochloride salt powder in bottle 350 mg [00202] The composition comprises 350 mg of N-(5-tcrt-butyl-isoxazol-3-yl)-N'- (4-[7-(2-morpholin-4-yl-ethoxy)imidazo[2,l-b][l,3]benzothiazol-2-yl]phenyl}urea di-hydrochloride salt and no additional excipients. To produce 2,000 bottles, N-(5-tert-butyl-isoxazol-3-yl)-N'- (4-[7-(2-morpholin-4-yl-ethoxy)imidazo[2,1 -b] [1,3]benzothiazol-2-yl]phenyl}urea di-hydrochloride salt (350 mg) was weighed using a calibrated balance into a 100 mL bottle. Each bottle was sealed with a rubber stopper and a flip off seal. [00203] Powder in Bottle 350 was reconstituted prior to use with a 5% solution of hydroxypropyl-P-cyclodextrin to a concentration of 5 mg/mL of N-(5-tert-butyl-isoxazol-3-yl)-N'-(4-[7-(2-morpholin-4-yl-ethoxy)imidazo[2,1 -b][1,3]benzothiazol-2-yl]phenyl}urea di-hydrochloride salt. The reconstituted N-(5-tert-butyl-isoxazol-3-yl)-N'-{4-[7-(2-morpholin-4-yl-ethoxy)imidazo[2,l-b][l,3]benzothiazol-2-yl]phenyl}urea di-hydrochloride salt was dosed as an oral solution. Example 4 Preparation of N-15-tert-butyl-isoxazol-3-yl)-Nf-{4-[7-(2-morpholin-4-yl-ethoxy)imidazo[2,l-bl [l,31benzothiazol-2-yllphenyllurea di-hydrochloride salt lyophilized powder in bottle 75 mg [00204] The composition comprises of 75 mg of N-(5-tcrt-butyl-isoxazol-3-yl)-N'- (4-[7-(2-morpholin-4-yl-ethoxy)imidazo[2,l-b][l,3]benzothiazol-2-yl]phenyl}urea di-hydrochloride salt and 75 mg of hydroxypropyl-P-cyclodexin. To produce 4,000 bottles, a solution of hydroxypropyl-P-cyclodexin (6 L) was prepared by dissolving hydroxypropyl-P-cyclodexin (3 kg) in a suitable container. With continued agitation, N-(5-tert-butyl-isoxazol-3-yl)-N'- (4-[7-(2-morpholin-4-yl-ethoxy)imidazo[2,1 -b][ 1,3]benzothiazol-2-yl]phenyl}urea di-hydrochloride salt (300 g) was added to the solution, and mixed until dissolved, if necessary, with heat. The solution was filtered before filling. Each 30 mL bottle was filled with f5 mL of the solution. After the filling, the solution in each bottle was flash frozen and lyophilized. The bottle was then sealed tightly. [00205] Prior to dosing, Lyophilized Powder in Bottle 75 was reconstituted by adding f5 mL of water to the bottle and swirling the bottle gently for one minute until powder was dissolved. The reconstituted N-(5-tert-butyl-isoxazol-3-yl)-N'-{4-[7-(2-morpholin-4-yl-ethoxy)imidazo[2,i-b][i,3]benzothiazol-2-yl]phenyl}urea di-hydrochloride salt was dosed as an oral solution.
