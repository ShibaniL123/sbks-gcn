(2)Preparation of tert-butyl 3-iodoazetidin-1-carboxylate
Tert-butyl 3-((methylsulfonyl)oxy)azetidin-1-carboxylate (2.67 g, 10.62 mmol) was dissolved in 20mL N,N-dimethyl formamide, and potassium iodide (5.3 g, 31.93 mmol) was added. The resultant mixture was heated to 110°C and reacted for 16 h. After the reaction, the solvent was removed by rotary evaporation, and 50mL water was added. After extraction with ethyl acetate (3×30mL), the organic phases were combined, dried with anhydrous sodium sulphate, and filtrated. The solvent was removed by rotary evaporation, and the residue was subjected to silica gel column chromatography (petroleum ether: ethyl acetate=4:1) to obtain the product (2.5g, yield: 83%).
