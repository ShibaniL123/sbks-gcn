DETAILED DESCRIPTION The present inventor has recognized example apparatus and methods for a rolling and shaping baking dough such as for pies and pastries. In certain examples, the system assists in providing rolled dough with relatively consistent thickness. In some examples, the thickness of the rolled dough can be selected using the system and methods. In some examples, the dough rolling system can assist in picking up, moving and placing the rolled dough for subsequent baking steps. In some examples, the dough rolling system can include templates for modifying a rolled dough layer, such as for providing decorative cutouts. In certain examples, the system can enable dough to be rolled to a specific shape and to a uniform thickness without the frustration and anxiety many bakers have when shaping and rolling out dough. Such a system can not only save aggravation but also save time. Providing rolled dough using the present system and methods can alleviate excessive handling of the dough and as a result the system can help preserve the texture and quality of the dough. Many different sizes of pies and pizzas can be made, along with crackers, shaped cookies and quiche crusts. With the addition of various depths of rigid rings, or shape and thickness templates, the thickness of the dough can be altered and the applications can be wide-ranging. In certain examples, the rolling board can be shaped into a circle, a rectangle or a square of various sizes to give additional options. FIGS. 1A and 1B illustrate generally an example rolling board 100. In general, the rolling board 100 can be a rigid material such as, but not limited to, wood or plastic and includes two major surfaces 101, 102 opposite each other. In some examples, at least one major surface 101 includes one or more grooves 103, 104, 105, 106 for assisting in rolling and shaping dough, such as dough for baking, for example. In some examples, one of the major surfaces 102 can be plain such as for use as a cutting board. In certain examples, the cutting board surface can include a layer of durable material to extend the useful life of the cutting board surface. In certain examples, the one or more grooves 103, 104, 105, 106 can be shaped for circular pies, pastries and tarts, although other shapes are possible without departing from the scope of the present subject matter. In some examples, the more than one groove 103, 104, 105, 106 can be arranged to provide more than one size rolled dough product. FIG. 2 illustrates generally an example shape and thickness template 210 in the shape of a circle. The grooves 103, 104, 105, 106 are sized and shaped to receive a shape and thickness template, such as the shape and thickness template 210 of FIG. 2. FIG. 3 illustrates generally an example rolling board 100 with an example shape and thickness template 310 inserted in to a groove of a plurality of grooves 303, 304, 306 of the rolling board 300. Each shape and thickness template can seat securely in a corresponding groove and can extend above the surface 301 of the rolling board 300 by a predetermined length. The predetermined length can provide a thickness template. For example, once the shape and thickness template 310 is inserted in a groove, dough can be rolled within the shape formed by the groove and the inserted shape and thickness template 310. As the dough is thinned by the rolling process (e.g. rolling pin), a portion of shape and thickness template 310 that protrudes from the surface 301 of the rolling board 300 can prevent the rolling pin from thinning the dough beyond a certain thickness. In addition, as the dough is thinned, portions of the dough can extend beyond the shape and thickness template 310 and can be separated from the dough of interest as the rolling pin contacts the shape and thickness template 310. The rolling process can be complete when the rolling pin can be rolled along the shape and thickness template 310 and no longer rolls the dough of interest within the interior of the shape and thickness template 310 and any excess dough has been separated from the dough of interest within the interior of the shape and thickness template 310. Upon completion of the rolling process, the shape and thickness template can be removed from the corresponding groove of the rolling board to allow access to the rolled dough. In certain examples, the rolling board can include a cut-out in the side of a groove or in the opposite major surface to allow a tool, such as a skewer or fork, to be used to pry the shape and thickness template from the groove or to push the shape and thickness template from the groove. In certain examples, prior to placing the dough on the rolling board 301 a dough support layer 312 can be placed on the rolling board 300 within the interior of the shape and thickness template 310. In certain examples, the dough support layer 312 can be a thin sheet of plastic or paper product such as cardboard. In some examples, the dough support layer has some rigidity to support a cantilevered portion of the dough upon removal from the rolling board 300. Upon completion of the rolling process and removal of the shape and thickness template 310, the dough support layer 312 can assist in picking up the rolled dough, moving the rolled dough to another location and placing the rolled dough at the other location, such as moving the rolled dough to a pie pan and placing the rolled dough in the pie pan. In certain examples, the dough support layer 312 can have a low friction surface that allows the rolled dough to be easily slid off the dough support layer 312 such as for placing the rolled dough in a pie pan or pastry pan. In certain examples, a low friction surface of the dough support layer 312 can assist in allowing the dough to “roll out” during the rolling process. In certain examples, parchment paper can be used on dough support layer 312 to allow the rolled dough and parchment paper to be slid onto a baking pan or sheet. FIG. 4A illustrates generally a cross-section of an example rolling board 400, shape and thickness template 410, and dough support layer 412. In certain examples, the rolling board 400 can include two major surfaces 401, 402 opposite each other. In certain examples, the rolling board 400 can include one or more grooves 403, 404, 405 extending into the rolling board 400 from the first major surface 401. In certain examples, a rolling board kit can include a shape and thickness template for each groove of the rolling board, such as the shape and thickness template 412 shown inserted in a corresponding groove 405 of the rolling board 400. In certain examples, a rolling board kit can include a number of dough support layers, each corresponding to a particular groove and a particular shape and thickness template, such as the dough support layer 412 corresponding to groove 405 and shape and thickness template 410. In some examples, a kit may include more than one shape and thickness template each template having a different height, to provide various thickness templates for a particular groove. In certain examples, a notch 414 can optionally be associated with a groove 404. The notch 414 can allow a tool such as a fork tine or skewer to be used to remove a shape and thickness template from the groove 404. In certain examples, a via 416 can couple the bottom of a groove 405 with the second major surface 402. The via 416 can allow a tool to be inserted from the second major surface 402. The tool can then be used to eject a shape and thickness template 410 from the corresponding groove 405. In certain examples, the rolling board can include grooves in the first major surface 401 and the second major surface 402. In such a configuration, a single template can provide a first dough thickness when used in a corresponding groove of the first surface and can provide a second dough thickness different from the first dough thickness when used in a a corresponding groove of the second major surface. In certain examples, the rolling board 400 can optionally include three or more caster assemblies 418 coupled to the second major surface 402 to allow the rolling board to be easily rotated or moved about a counter. In certain examples, the caster assemblies 418 can include wheels or retained spheres 420. FIG. 4B illustrates generally a cross-section of an example rolling board 400 with an alternative base 430 that allows rotation of the rolling board 400 while maintaining the relative position of the rolling board 400 on a countertop for example. The example rolling board 400 can include grooves on both major surfaces 401, 402. In certain examples, the grooves 423, 424, 425 within the second major surface 402 can correspond in size to the grooves 403, 404, 405 in the first major surface 401. In certain examples, the depth of the grooves 423, 424, 425 within the second major surface 402 of the rolling board 400 can have a different depth than the groves 403, 404, 405 in the first major surface 401. Such an arrangement can allow the thickness templates 410 to be reused to provide a second dough thickness when used with the grooves 423, 424, 425 in the second major surface 402. In certain examples, the base 430 can include a bottom surface 432 that can resist slipping on a countertop. In certain examples, the base 430 can include an upper surface 431 that can be low friction and can allow the rolling board 400 to be easily moved around when the rolling board 400 sits atop the base 430. In certain examples, the upper surface 431 can include a guide groove 433 that corresponds to a groove of at least one of surfaces 401, 402 of the rolling board 400. In certain examples, a guide ring 434 can be inserted into the guide groove 433 and when the corresponding groove 423 of the rolling board 400 is aligned with the guide ring 434, the rolling board 400 can sit atop the base 430, and the guide ring 434 can allow the rolling board 400 to rotate but maintain relatively centered on the base 430. This allowed movement can assist a user as the dough is rolled out and flattened to the extremes of a thickness template 410. Without the base 430, there is always the opportunity for the rolling board 400 to not remain optimally positioned relative to the user as the user rolls the dough and rotates the rolling board. It is understood that the guide ring can be configured for any one of the grooves of the rolling board without departing from the scope of the present subject matter. In certain examples, instead of a guide ring, a guide pin can be provided that resides in a hole of the base and is extends into a hole at or near a center position of the underside of the rolling board when the rolling board is set upon the base. The guide pin or guide ring is not configured to bear weight of the rolling board. The guide pin or guide ring is configured allow rotational movement of the rolling board relative to the base but to limit lateral movement of the rolling board relative to the base. FIGS. 5A-D illustrate generally example dough support layers that include decorative cut-outs. FIG. 5A illustrates generally an example dough support layer 500 including rectangular cut-outs 521 radiating from a center point. FIG. 5B illustrates generally an example dough support layer 500 including oval-shaped cutouts 522 radiating from a center point. FIG. 5C illustrates generally an example dough support layer 500 including star cut-outs 523. FIG. 5D illustrates generally an example dough support layer 500 including heart-shaped cut-outs 524. It is understood that a dough support layer can include other shaped cut-outs without departing from the scope of the present subject matter. In certain examples, the cut-outs of the dough support layer can emboss the cut-out shapes on rolled dough when the dough support layer is used as described above with a rolling board. Upon cooking the dough, the shapes may be visible through a clear pie dish for example to add a decorative touch to a pie or pastry. The dough support layers 500 including the cut-outs 521, 522, 523, 524 can also be used as a template for a top crust of a pie or pastry. FIG. 6 illustrates generally a top-view of a pie 630 having a decorative top crust where the decorative cut-outs 624 can be formed using a dough support layer such as that shown in FIG. 5D. In addition, the cut-out dough 525 can be used to decorate a different portion of the pie or pastry such as the outer perimeter of the upper crust of a pie 630 as shown in FIG. 6. In certain examples, a rolling board kit can include one or more dough support layers including cut-outs. FIG. 7 illustrates general an example rolling board 700 for making square or rectangular dough sheets of a particular thickness. The rolling board 700 can include a number of straight grooves including base width groove 701, a pair of length grooves 702, 703 oriented at 90 degrees to the base width groove 701, and a plurality of additional width grooves 704 oriented in parallel with the base width groove 701. The plurality of grooves 701, 702, 703, 704 can accept insertion of interlocking template bars that can define an area. A user can place dough in the area and can roll the dough using a rolling pin, for example. As the dough flattens and rolls out under the pressure of the rolling pin, the rolling pin can engage the tops of the template bars and sever the dough such that a final dough sheet remains in the area defined by the template bars. The height of the template bars that extend out of the grooves 701, 702, 703, 704 and above the surface of the rolling board 700 can define the nominal thickness of the final dough sheet. To eliminate damaging the final dough sheet, the template bars can be removed and the final dough sheet can be slid from the surface of the rolling board 700. FIG. 8A illustrates generally an example of a width template bar 810 that can be inserted in to one of the plurality of width grooves of the rolling board of FIG. 7. In some applications, at least one pair of width bars 810 are used and inserted in, for example, the base width groove and one of the addition width grooves. FIG. 8B illustrates generally an example of a length template bar 811 that can be inserted in to one of the length grooves of the rolling board of FIG. 7. In some application, at least one pair of length template bars 811 are used and inserted in the two length grooves of the rolling board of FIG. 7. The template bars 810, 811 of FIGS. 8A and 8B include notches 812, 813, 814 that allow the bars to interlock when inserted into appropriate grooves of the rolling board and to define a closed area. As discussed above, dough can be rolled within the closed area and a final dough sheet having the shape of the closed area and with a particular thickness. In certain examples, the particular thickness can be defined by a combination of the height of the template bars and the depth of the rolling board grooves that accommodate the template bars. FIG. 9A illustrates general an example rolling board 900 with example template bars 910, 911 inserted into some of the plurality of grooves 901, 902, 903, 904 of the rolling board 900. The assembled rolling board can include a base width bar 910 inserted in a left most width groove 901, a pair of length bars 911 inserted in the length grooves 902, 903, and an adjustable width bar 910 inserted in one of the additional width grooves 904. In this example, the width bars 910 are inserted with the notches (FIG. 8, 812) facing up, and the length bars 911 are inserted in the grooves with the notches (FIG. 8, 813) facing down such that the corresponding notches 812, 813 interface. In certain examples, prior to placing dough on the rolling board 900 in the area 920 defined by the interlocked template bars 910, 911, a dough support layer, such as a thin plastic sheet, can be placed in the area. In certain examples, the dough support layer is coextensive with the area 920 defined by the interlocked template bars 910, 911. During the rolling of the dough, the dough support layer can prevent the dough from embedding into grooves (e.g., 904) located within the area 920 defined by the interlocked template bars 910, 911 and can provide a flat bottom surface for the dough. Upon completion of the rolling of the dough, the ends 921 of the unoccupied width grooves 904 can provide a location to place a tool to assist in removing the template bars 911 from the grooves. Upon removal of the template bars 910, 910, the dough can be removed from the rolling board 900, for example, by sliding the dough support layer, with the final dough sheet atop, off of the rolling board. In certain example, the dough support layer can include a non-stick surface, such that the dough can easily slide off of the dough support layer and into a baking utensil such as a pan. FIG. 9B illustrates generally a cross section of length bar interlocked with the width bars as illustrated in FIG. 9A. FIG. 9B also shows a relative position of a dough support layer 922 with respect to the template bars and the rolling board. It is under stood that a dough support layer 922 would not typically be visible in such a cross section as it would lie within the area defined by the interlocked template bars 910, 911. FIG. 10 is a flow chart of an example method 1000 for using an example rolling board as described above. At 1002, a first template can be inserted into one or more first grooves of a rolling board. At 1004, dough can be placed within an area defined by the template. At 1006 and 1008, the dough can be rolled to fill the area using a rolling device such as a rolling pin and flattened until the rolling device contacts a portion of the template extending above a surface of the rolling board to provide a uniform dough thickness within the area. At 1010, the dough can be severed using the interface of the rolling device with the template. At 1012, the template can be removed from the one or more grooves of the rolling board. At 1014, a first completed dough sheet having the uniform dough thickness can be removed without substantial handing of the dough sheet. At 1016, a second template can be inserted in to a second one or more groove to begin preparing a second completed dough sheet of a different size or a different dough thickness than the first completed dough sheet. In certain examples, a dough support layer can be placed within the area defined by the template to assist in handling the completed dough sheet and to isolate unoccupied groove within the area from filling with dough during the rolling process. In certain applications, templates as discussed above with respect to FIGS. 1-10 can allow dough to be rolled into a shape with a uniform thickness of 1/16 inch or less. Dough sheets or shapes with such thin thickness can be very difficult and time consuming to generate even for experienced bakers. The present subject matter allows such dough sheets and shapes to be generated with much less difficulty and in relatively much less time. In certain examples, the dough support sheets discussed above and the removable template or template bars allow dough sheets to be moved from the rolling board to other locations with ease and minimal if any damage or distortion. In some applications, a rolling board kit can provide tools for making baked goods or pastry dough crusts of a predetermined thickness, a predetermined shape and a predetermined size. In certain examples, a kit can provide tools for making and handling baked goods or pastry dough crusts of a predetermined thickness, a predetermined shape and a predetermined size. In some examples, a kit can provide tools for making, handling and decorating baked goods or pastry dough crusts of a predetermined thickness, a predetermined shape, and a predetermined size.
