Preparation of: rac-trans-1-(1-acetyl-4-(4-methoxyphenyl)piperidin-3-yl)-3-(pyrimidin-5-yl)urea (Example 25)
To a stirred solution of rac-trans-1-(3-amino-4-(4-methoxyphenyl)piperidin-1-yl)ethanone hydrochloride (0.051 g, 0.18 mmol, 1 eq) [synthesis described in the synthesis of Example 4] in DCM (10 mL) was added Et3N (0.05 mL, 0.35 mmol, 2 eq) followed by triphosgene (0.022 g, 0.071 mmol, 0.4 eq) at 0Â° C. and stirred for 10 min. Pyrimidin-5-amine (0.05 g, 0.18 mmol, 1 eq) was then added and stirred for 2 h. The reaction mixture was diluted with DCM, washed with brine (10 mL), dried over Na2SO4 and concentrated. The crude product was purified by preparative TLC to afford Example 25 (0.025 g, 39%) as white solid.
