DESCRIPTION The purpose of the device is to prevent the closures (I.e. large button(s), zippers, ) on clothing from rattling and banging on the inside of a clothing dryer during itâ€™s drying cycle. When the article of clothing is ready to be placed into the dryer, the device is slipped over top of the closure to secure it. For example, a jacket has been washed, and is ready for drying. The device would be slipped over the button or zipper, securing it in place and keeping it from clanging on the inside of the metal drum, during the drying cycle.
