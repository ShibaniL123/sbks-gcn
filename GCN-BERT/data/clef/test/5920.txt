Example 108A
tert-Butyl 4-{[(6-bromo-3-methyl-2-phenylquinolin-4-yl)carbonyl]amino}-3,5-dioxobicyclo[2.2.2]octane-1-carboxylate
At RT, 292 mg (0.69 mmol) of Dess-Martin periodinane (1,1,1-triacetoxy-1,1-dihydro-1,2-benziodoxol-3(1H)-one) were added to a solution of 100 mg (0.17 mmol) of the compound from Example 107A in 1.7 ml of dichloromethane, and the mixture was stirred at RT for 1.5 h. 20 ml each of 10% strength aqueous sodium thiosulfate solution and tert-butyl methyl ether were then added, and the mixture was shaken. After phase separation, the organic phase was washed once with 20 ml of saturated aqueous sodium hydrogencarbonate solution und dried over sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated. The residue was then taken up in dichloromethane and purified by column chromatography (25 g of silica gel, Biotage, cyclohexane/ethyl acetate 7:3). This gave 68 mg (68% of theory, purity 100%) of the title compound
