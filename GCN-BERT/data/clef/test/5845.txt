Capsule pharmaceutical dosage form comprising a suspension formulation of an indolinone derivative The present invention relates to a suspension formulation containing the active substance 3-Z-[l-(4-(N-((4-methyl-piperazin-l-yl)-methylcarbonyl)-N-methyl-amino)anilino)-l-phenyl-methylene]-6-methoxycarbonyl-2-indolinone-monoethanesulphonate, to a capsule pharmaceutical dosage form containing said suspension formulation, to a process for preparing said suspension formulation, to a process for preparing said capsule comprising said suspension formulation and to the packaging material for the finished capsule. Background to the invention Some pharmacologically active substances may have biopharmaceutical and/or physicochemical properties which make them difficult to formulate into common administration forms. Such substances may be conveniently administered in liquid form either in a lipophilic or hydrophilic carrier system, either as a solution or a suspension, either mixed with a single carrier excipient or mixed with a complex carrier medium made up of several components. Encapsulation of such liquid formulations in soft gelatin capsules potentially offers a very convenient way of administering such pharmacologically active substances. Solutions To formulate a solution based system the carrier has to dissolve the active substance. Improved gastrointestinal (GI) absorption of poorly absorbable drugs can be achieved by increasing the dissolution rate of the drug in the presence of bile acids. Within the gastrointestinal tract, bile salts behave as biological detergents that, when mixed with phospholipids, form thermodynamically stable mixed micelles. In many instances the choice of formulation will be limited by solvent capacity, and in others the drug will not be sufficiently soluble in any lipid formulations. The carrier medium may be designed to spontaneously form an emulsion or microemulsion in the stomach thereby facilitating absorption of the pharmacologically active substance. These systems are commonly known as self (micro-)emulsifying drug delivery systems (SEDDS or SMEDDS). They have to be accurately prepared and even slight variations in the composition cannot be tolerated without irreversibly upsetting the system, and destroying its beneficial properties. For example, the active substance may precipitate out as a consequence of a change in the solubilizing properties of the capsule formulation. This precipitation process may be irreversible and lead to an under-dosing of the patient. The emulsifying properties of the capsule formulation may also be changed, and, upon administration, an emulsion may not be formed in the stomach. As a consequence, the pharmacologically active substance may not be correctly or reproducibly absorbed. Suspensions As suspensions do represent thermodynamic instable multiphase systems, various characteristics have to be taken into account during development of these systems. The physical stability of the suspension formulation has to be ensured from the perspective of particle growth as well as from the perspective of re-crystallization in a potential polymorphic form which may have a different solubility or from the perspective of sedimentation associated by caking of the sediment. These factors may influence the liberation of the active substance from the dosage form and hence alter the extent of patient's exposure during the shelf-life of the product. Hence no solubility of the active substance in a single carrier excipient or in the carrier system would be the prerequisite for a physically stable system. Lipophilic Carrier Systems Lipophilic excipients are commonly employed as moisture barrier systems to protect chemically instable substances. For this purpose, different types of fats or waxes may be applied on solid dosage forms or on their manufacturing intermediates to prevent migration of ambient water vapour or oxygen and to improve the chemical stability of the active substance. Hot-melt inclusions of the drug into lipophilic binders may as well prevent contact with moisture. Since solid hydrophobic systems poorly disintegrate, drug release in these systems is delayed, in contrast to drug release in low viscous liquid lipid formulations. This delayed drug release is reflected by the specific plasma profiles of the active substance of a modified drug delivery system (Ritschel W. et al., Die Tablette, 2002, 2nd ed., ECV, Aulendorf, ρ. 267f). Hence, viscosity of liquid systems is a crucial parameter and has to be carefully adjusted to ensure adequate dmg release. In practice lipophilic or ‘lipid’ formulations are a diverse group of formulations which have a wide range of properties. These result from the blending of up to five classes of excipients, ranging from pure triglyceride oils, through mixed glycerides, lipophilic surfactants, hydrophilic surfactants and water-soluble cosolvents. Assessment of quality The performance of a formulation may be assessed by measuring its relative bioavailability, i.e. comparing its bioavailability with the bioavailability of an aqueous solution of the active substance. If the systems show a comparable bioavailability, not with respect to the dissolution rate but with respect to the drug permeability, presystemic or systemic metabolization of the active substance will determine the systemic exposure. Thus, (lipid) suspensions may also show satisfactory exposure of the patient due to the adequate solubility of the active substance within physiological conditions. 3-Z-[ 1 -(4-(N-((4-methyl-piperazin-1 -yl)-methylcarbonyl)-N-methyl-amino)-anilino)-1 phenyl-methylene]-6-methoxycarbonyl-2-indolinone-monoethanesulphonate is an innovative substance having valuable pharmacological properties, especially for the treatment of oncological diseases, immunologic diseases or pathological conditions involving an immunologic component, or fibrotic diseases.

Detailed description of the invention It has been found that, surprisingly, a soft gelatin capsule including a liquid formulation comprising a viscous suspension of 3-Z-[l-(4-(N-((4-methyl-piperazin-l-yl)methylcarbonyl)-N-methyl-amino)-anilino)-l-phenyl-methylene]-6-methoxycarbonyl-2- indolinone-monoethanesulphonate in medium chain triglycerides, hard fat and lecithin, meets the adequate bioavailability requirements for the desired dosage range tailored to treatment with the drug substance 3-Z-[l-(4-(N-((4-methyl-piperazin-l-yl)methylcarbonyl)-N-methyl-amino)-anilino)-l-phenyl-methylene]-6-methoxycarbonyl-2- indolinone-monoethanesulphonate. This liquid formulation consists of a lipid suspension of the active substance. An advantage of such soft gelatin capsule containing a lipid suspension is that the water uptake into the formulation is very unlikely. The dosage form is divided into three different compartments, namely (a) a hydrophilic capsule shell and (b) the hydrophobic carrier system in which (c) the slightly hygroscopic powder of active substance is suspended. Due to ambient moisture the content of water may vary within these different compartments. It will migrate by diffusion until an equilibrium state is reached . The water content may affect different properties of the drug product, such as the chemical stability of the active substance (predominantly via hydrolysis) or the elasticity of the capsule shell. The water uptake in the present system is primarily in the capsule shell. This can be shown by water vapour sorption experiments (shown in Figure 1) as well as by the correlation of the mass gain with the softening of the capsule. The water uptake does further not affect the chemical stability of the drug substance. This is confirmed by the stress stability studies of, for example, 1 month at 70°C, and by the long-term (3 years) and accelerated (6 months) stability study results for the systems in accordance with the present invention. Furthermore, studies have shown that there is no mass increase or sticking problem for the capsules in accordance with the present invention when stored in tight packaging materials. Thus, recommended packaging for such capsules are, for example, alu/alu blisters and HDPE bottles. Generally, soft gelatin capsules have a capsule shell made of gelatin, one or more plasticizing agents, in particular glycerol, optionally further auxiliary materials, such as dyes, colorant pigments, flavouring agents, sugar, oligosaccharides or polysaccharides, and a capsule formulation (or capsule filling) containing a solvent, adjuvants and one or more pharmacologically active substances. The term gelatin as used herein includes not only unmodified gelatin as in the European Pharmacopeia but also modified gelatin, such as for example succinated gelatin. As already mentioned hereinbefore, the present invention relates to a lipid suspension formulation of the active substance 3-Z-[l-(4-(N-((4-methyl-piperazin-l-yl)methylcarbonyl)-N-methyl-amino)-anilino)-l-phenyl-methylene]-6-methoxycarbonyl-2- indo linone-monoethanesulphonate. In a preferred embodiment in accordance with the present invention, the lipid suspension formulation of the active substance 3-Z-[l-(4-(N-((4-methyl-piperazin-l-yl)methylcarbonyl)-N-methyl-amino)-anilino)-l-phenyl-methylene]-6-methoxycarbonyl-2- indo linone-monoethanesulphonate comprises a viscous suspension of 3-Z-[l-(4-(N-((4-methyl-piperazin-1 -yl)-methylcarbonyl)-N-methyl-amino)-anilino)-1 -phenyl-methylene]-6-methoxycarbonyl-2-indolinone-monoethanesulphonate in a lipid carrier, a thickener and a glidant/solubilizing agent. In a further preferred embodiment in accordance with the present invention, the amount of 3-Z-[ 1 -(4-(N-((4-methyl-piperazin-1 -yl)-methylcarbonyl)-N-methyl-amino)-anilino)-1 -phenyl-methylene] -6-methoxycarbonyl-2-indolinone-monoethanesulphonate is comprised within the range of 1 to 90 weight% of the lipid suspension formulation, preferably within 10 and 50 %. To avoid the above-mentioned physical stability issues, such as re-crystallization or particle-growth, the active substance must be either completely insoluble or dissolved in the carrier. A solubility screening of lipophilic hydrophilic and amphiphilic excipients and mixtures revealed various potential carriers for formulating the lipid suspension in accordance with the present invention. The choice of these lipid carriers for the lipid suspension in accordance with the present invention represents a further object of the present invention. Thus, in a preferred embodiment, suitable carriers or carrier components for the active substance 3-Z-[l-(4-(N-((4-methyl-piperazin-l-yl)-methylcarbonyl)-N-methyl-amino)anilino)-1 -phenyl-methylene] -6-methoxycarbonyl-2-indo linone-monoethanesulphonate are acetylated monoglycerides, com oil glycerides, ethyl oleate, glycerol mono/dioleate, glycerol mono lino late, macrogolglycerol caprylocaprate, macrogolglycerol linoleate, medium chain partial glycerides, medium chain triglycerides, caprylic-capric triglycerides, caprylic/capric/linoleic triglycerides, caprylic/capric/succinic triglycerides, propylene glycol dicaprylate/dicaprate, oleic acid polyoxyl castor oil, polyoxyl hydrogenated castor oil, propylene glycol monocaprylate, propylene glycol monolaurate, refined animal derived oil, refined soybean oil, refined vegetable oil, sorbitan monostearate, triacetin, triethyl citrate, or mixtures thereof. Stability issues such as hydrolytic degradation of the active substance may also be caused by hydrophilic carrier components. Therefore, carrier systems based on hydrophilic polyethylene glycols will generally show inferior stability than more hydrophobic carriers such as lipid carriers. In accordance with the present invention, the most preferred lipid carrier is medium chain triglycerides. It is comprised within the range of 1 to 90 weight% of the lipid suspension formulation, preferably within 10 and 70 %. Suitable medium chain triglycerides may be the commercial product Miglyol 812®, Miglyol 810®, Miglyol 818®, Miglyol 829® or Miglyol 840®. A thickener adjusts the viscosity of the suspension. It stabilizes the suspension system, ensures optimal processing and guarantees an adequate capsule quality, especially as far as content uniformity or dissolution behaviour are concerned. In a preferred embodiment, suitable thickeners to be used in the present invention are oleogel forming excipients, such as Colloidal Silica or Bentonit, or lipophilic or amphiphilic excipients of high viscosity, such as bees wax, glycerol monostearate, hydrogenated vegetable oil, partially hydrogenated vegetable oil or hard fats. In accordance with the present invention, the most preferred thickener is hard fat. It is preferably comprised within the range of 1 to 30 weight% of the suspension formulation, most preferably within 10 and 30 weight%. The most suitable hard fats have a melting range of 30 °C to 44°C, most preferably a melting range of 33 °C to 40°C. Suitable commercially available products are Gclucirc" 33/01, Witepsol® W35 or Softisan® 378. The determination of the most suitable melting range for hard fats can be performed as shown in Figure 3, by measurement of the effect of the melting range of the hard fat on the in-vitro dissolution behaviour over time. Lecithin is a common excipient for carrier-systems in soft gelatin capsules. It is used as a glidant of the highly concentrated suspension during encapsulation, prevents blocking of ducts and pumps and ensures high mass uniformity of the encapsulated formulation. Furthermore lecithin acts as a surfactant, which may improve distribution of the formulation-droplets during in-vitro dissolution testing as well as in-vivo for drug resorption. Furthermore it may also improve wetting of the active substance crystals. Suitable lecithin may be the commercial product Topcithin®. It was surprisingly found that lecithin, up to a certain content, is useful to improve the dissolution behaviour of the finished capsules. Exceeding amounts do not show an additional benefit during in-vitro dissolution testing, as shown in Figure 2. In a preferred embodiment in accordance with the present invention, the amount of lecithin is comprised within the range of 0.1 to 10 weight% of the lipid suspension formulation, most preferably within 0.25 and 2.5 %. In an alternative embodiment, the present invention relates to a lipid suspension formulation of the active substance 3-Z-[l-(4-(N-((4-methyl-piperazin-l-yl)methylcarbonyl)-N-methyl-amino)-anilino)-l-phenyl-methylene]-6-methoxycarbonyl-2- indolinone-monoethanesulphonate, comprising a viscous suspension of 3-Z-[l-(4-(N((4-methyl-piperazin-1 -yl)-methylcarbonyl)-N-methyl-amino)-anilino)-1 -phenyl-methylene]-6-methoxycarbonyl-2-indolinone-monoethanesulphonate in medium chain triglycerides, hard fat, lecithin and one or more macrogolglycerols, such as for example macrogolglycerol-hydroxystearate (traded for example under the name Eumulgin® FIRE 40 PH) or macrogolglycerol-ricinoleate (also known as polyoxyl castor oil and traded for example under the name Cremophor® EL, Cremophor® RH40 or Eumulgin® RO 35 PH). In a preferred embodiment in accordance with the present invention, the amount of macrogolglycerol(s) is comprised within the range of 0.1 to 50 weight% of the lipid suspension formulation, most preferably within 0.3 and 10 %. Three carrier systems (the hydrophilic Ρ3, lipophilic PI and lipophilic with surfactants Ρ2 semi-solid suspension formulations described in the foregoing) were tested for bioavailability in non-clinical studies and all of them were identified to be suitable options for an oral dosage form of the active substance 3-Z-[l-(4-(N-((4-methylpiperazin-1 -yl)-methylcarbonyl)-N-methyl-amino)-anilino)-1 -phenyl-methylene]-6-methoxycarbonyl-2-indolinone-monoethanesulphonate. However, for reasons of bioavailability, as is evident from the results shown in Figure 4, lipid (lipophilic) suspension formulations comprising a viscous suspension of 3-Z-[l-(4-(N-((4-methyl-piperazin-1 -yl)-methylcarbonyl)-N-methyl-amino)-anilino)-1 -phenyl-methylene]-6-methoxycarbonyl-2-indolinone-monoethanesulphonate in medium chain triglycerides, hard fat and lecithin are preferred. Hence, Figure 4 shows the results of a comparison of the absolute bioavailability (BA in %) tested in the rat over 24 hours for the aqueous solution (S) versus different carrier systems (PI, Ρ2 and Ρ3) of the active substance in accordance with the present invention. The experiment is described in the following. The table below shows the composition of the tested carrier systems (semi-solid suspension formulations). * slight deviations of the quantities towards 100 percent may be caused by rounding errors The semi-solid suspensions are filled in hard gelatin capsules (Capsugel, no. Formulation PI Ρ2 Ρ3 Ingredients [%]* Active Substance 43.48 42.19 31.75 Triglycerides, Medium-Chain 37.83 41.77 - Hard fat 18.26 12.66 - Cremophor RH40 - 2.95 - Lecithin 0.43 0.42 - Glycerol 85% - - 3.17 Purified Water - - 4.76 Macrogol 600 - - 58.10 Macrogol 4000 - - 2.22 Υ0303490). Each capsule contains approximately 15 to 20 mg of the formulation. The capsules are applied to the rats with a special device similar to gavage. For comparison an aqueous solution containing 0.5 % Natrosol 250 ΗΧ is applied via gavage. For calculation of the absolute bioavailability an additional group of rats is dosed intravenously with the compound dissolved in 5% glucose solution (aqueous solution (S)). 5 male Han Wistar rats (strain: CrlGlxBrlHamWI) are used per group. Blood sampling times are 0.5 h, 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, 8 h, 24 h post dose and plasma is analysed by a validated HPFC/MS/MS method. From the plasma level time curves areas under the curve (AUC) are calculated by linear trapezoidal rule. Dose normalised AUCs of the oral formulation are divided by dose normalised AUCs of the intravenous formulation for the calculation of the absolute bioavailability. As can be seen from the results of the experiment shown in Figure 4, the bioavailability is similar for the aqueous solution (S: 11%) and the different carrier systems of active substance (PI: 14%, Ρ2: 10% and Ρ3: 10%), however the inter-individual variation (standard deviation of bioavailability) is smaller for the aqueous solution (S) and the carrier system (PI) when compared to the carrier systems (Ρ2) and (Ρ3) (2.8 and 4.1 versus 7.4 and 7.1), indicating a practically complete relative bioavailability for the tested formulations (PI, Ρ2 and Ρ3) versus the solution (S) but a higher variation in the carrier systems (Ρ2) and (Ρ3). The present invention further relates to a capsule pharmaceutical dosage form consisting of a capsule shell and a capsule formulation (or capsule filling), characterized in that the capsule formulation (or capsule filling) comprises the lipid suspension formulation as hereinbefore described. The capsule pharmaceutical dosage form may be a soft gelatine capsule, a hard gelatine capsule, or an hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC) capsule or a polyvinyl alcohol polymer capsule or a pullulan capsule. In the case of a hard gelatine capsule or an hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC) capsule, a polyvinyl alcohol polymer capsule or a pullulan capsule, the filled in capsule may further be sealed or banded. In a preferred embodiment in accordance with the present invention, the capsule is a soft gelatin capsule consisting of a capsule shell comprising gelatin, one or more plasticizing agents and optionally further auxiliary materials, and a capsule formulation (or capsule filling), characterized in that the capsule formulation (or capsule filling) comprises the lipid suspension formulation as hereinbefore described. The capsule pharmaceutical dosage form according to the invention, and especially the soft gelatin capsules, may be stored in suitable glass containers or in flexible/hard plastic containers, preferably non-PVC materials based, or in plastic (e.g. PVC, PVDC or Aclar®) blisters optionally with an over-packaging of aluminium (aluminium pouch), or in aluminium blisters consisting of e.g a bottom foil of PA/A1/PVC and an aluminium lidding foil, the later providing the highest water protection. Hence, the containers may be designed so as to provide particular protection for the capsule pharmaceutical dosage form according to the invention, and especially the soft gelatin capsules, e.g. to protect them from light, oxygen or water. Flexible plastic containers may contain additional protection, e.g. in the form of an additional aluminium packaging. The capsule pharmaceutical dosage form according to the invention may be prepared by conventional methods of producing capsules known from the literature. The soft gelatin capsule according to the invention may be prepared by conventional methods of producing soft gelatin capsules known from the literature, such as for example the “rotary die procedure”, described for example in Swarbrick, Boylann, Encyclopedia of pharmaceutical technology, Marcel Dekker, 1990, Yol. 2, ρρ 269 ff or in Lachmann et al., "The Theory and Practice of Industrial Pharmacy", 2nd Edition, pages 404-419, 1976, or other procedures, such as those described for example in Jimerson R. F. et al., “Soft gelatin capsule update”, Drug Dev. Ind. Pharm., Vol. 12, No. 8-9, ρρ. 1133-44, 1986. The lipid suspension formulation may be prepared by conventional methods of producing formulations known from the literature, i.e. by mixing the ingredients at a pre-determined temperature in a pre-determined order in order to obtain a homogenized suspension. Alternatively, the lipid suspension formulation may be prepared in accordance with the procedure described in Example 10, which is also an object of the present invention Lipid suspension formulation of the active substance, finished soft gelatin capsules containing same and packaging materials for the packaging of finished soft gelatin capsules according to the invention are illustrated by the Examples and Figures that follow.

Example 10 In the following, a manufacturing process for the preparation of a lipid suspension formulation of the active substance and a process for the encapsulation are described. a: Hard fat and parts of Medium-chain triglycerides are pre-mixed in the processing unit. Subsequently lecithin, the rest of medium-chain triglycerides and the active substance are added. The suspension is mixed, homogenized, deaerated and finally sieved to produce the formulation (Fillmix). The gelatin basic mass components (glycerol, water and gelatine) are mixed and dissolved at elevated temperature. Then, the corresponding colours are added and mixed, producing the Coloured Gelatin Mass. After adjustment of the encapsulation machine, Fillmix and Coloured Gelatin Mass are processed into soft gelatin capsules using the rotary-die process. This process is e.g. described in Swarbrick, Boylann, Encyclopedia of pharmaceutical technology, Marcel Dekker, 1990, Vol. 2, ρρ 269 ff. The initial drying is carried out using a rotary dryer. For the final drying step, capsules are placed on trays. Drying is performed at 15 - 26°C and low relative humidity. After 100% visual inspection of the capsules for separation of deformed or leaking capsules, the capsules are size sorted. Finally, the capsules are imprinted, using an Offset printing technology or an Ink-jet printing technology. Alternatively, the capsule imprint can be made using the Ribbon printing technology, a technology in which the gelatin bands arc imprinted prior to the encapsulation step c. 1.
