Synthesis of 1-(3-chlorophenyl)-4-{3-[4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenyl]-1,2,4-oxadiazole-5-yl}pyrrolidin-2-one (Compound 27)
(27-1) Synthesis of 1-(3-chlorophenyl)-5-oxopyrrolidine-3-carboxylic acid (Compound 27-1)
The mixture of itaconic acid (520 mg, 4 mmol) and 3-chloroaniline (418 µL, 4 mmol) was heated at 120 °C overnight. After removal of the solvent in vacuo, the residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography eluting with hexane-ethyl acetate to obtain the title compound (877 mg, yield 92%).
