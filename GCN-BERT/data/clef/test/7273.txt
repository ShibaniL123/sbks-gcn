BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Thermoplastic vulcanizates (TPVs) are produced via dynamic vulcanization of non-miscible blends of a rubber and a thermoplastic, that is, the selective cross-linking of the rubber, while melt mixing with the thermoplastic. As a result, products are obtained which consist of cross-linked rubber particles dispersed in a thermoplastic matrix, which provides both the elasticity and melt processability of TPVs. Compared to their non-crosslinked TPE counterparts, TPVs have superior properties in terms of heat resistance, compression set, chemical resistance and tensile strength. The majority of commercial TPVs are based on blends of EPDM with polypropylene (PP), which are typically crosslinked using a phenol derivative. Thermoplastic vulcanizates may advantageously be produced by employing a peroxide cure system. “Peroxide-cured EPDM/PP TPV” generally exhibit lower color and lower residues than phenolic-cured TPV products, while maintaining good thermal stability and good compression set. U.S. Pat. No. 3,806,558 discloses that ethylene propylene-diene terpolymers (EPDM) can be partially cured by dynamic vulcanization, in the presence of polypropylene, to provide reprocessable materials with good physical properties. The diene component in polymer chains improves the crosslinking efficiency, but results in poor environmental degradation resistance. Alternatively, an ethylene-α-olefin copolymer without a diene group can be used as rubber phase in peroxide cured TPV. Reference JP 3359505 discloses a thermoplastic polymer composition with improved environmental degradation by using an ethylene-octene copolymer produced by metallocene catalyst. There remains a need for new compositions for TPV applications with improved compression set, extrusion surface quality, and good mechanical properties.

Applications The present invention also provides a process of making TPV composition comprising blending component B and cured component A by dynamic vulcanization. The thermoplastic vulcanizates based on the inventive composition are preferably prepared by utilizing dynamic vulcanization techniques. Dynamic vulcanization is a process whereby a blend of plastic, rubber and rubber curative is masticated, while curing the rubber. The term “dynamic” indicates the mixture is subjected to shear forces during the vulcanization step, as contrasted with “static” vulcanization, wherein the vulcanizable composition is immobile (in fixed relative space) during the vulcanization step. One advantage of dynamic vulcanization is that elastoplastic (thermoplastic elastomeric) compositions may be obtained when the crosslinked rubber is well dispersed in the thermoplastic matrix. Examples of dynamic vulcanization are described in U.S. Pat.

When an extruder is used to prepare the TPV, if additional oil is needed, the oil is preferably added from a port provided in the melt mixing device using a gear pump or the like. Moreover, additional additives or materials, including other resins and elastomers, may be added by a side feeder on the melt mixing device or the like.

Test Methods and Sample Preparations Density Density is measured in accordance with ASTM D-792. Mooney Viscosity (ML 1+4, 121° C.) Mooney Viscosity (ML1+4 at 121° C.) was measured in accordance with ASTM 1646, with a one minute preheat time and a four minute rotor operation time. The instrument is an Alpha Technologies Mooney Viscometer 2000. Melt Index Melt index (I2) for the ethylene-based polymers, in g/10 min, was measured using ASTM D-1238 (Condition 190° C./2.16 kg). The notation “15” refers to a melt index, in g/10 min, measured using ASTM D-1238, Condition 190° C./5.0 kg. The notation “I10” refers to a melt index, in g/10 min, measured using ASTM D-1238, Condition 190° C./10.0 kg. The notation “121” refers to a melt index, in g/10 min, measured using ASTM D-1238, Condition 190° C./21.6 kg. For propylene-based polymers, the melt flow rate (MFR) was measured using ASTM D-1238 (Condition 230° C./2.16 kg). Gel Content Gel content can be measured by a small scale Soxhlet extraction method. Samples are cut into small pieces, ranging from about 35 mg to 86 mg. Three pieces of each sample are individually weighed, to at least four digits, on a top-loading electronic analytical balance. Each piece is placed inside a small cylinder composed of aluminum window screen. The ends of the cylinders are closed with ordinary paper staples. Six aluminum cylinders are placed inside one fritted glass extraction thimble. The thimbles are placed in jacketed Soxhlet extractors, and extracted overnight with refluxing xylenes. At the end of the minimum 12 hour extraction, the still warm thimbles are quenched in methanol. The methanol precipitates the gel, to facilitate removal of the gels, intact from the cylinders. The cylinders containing precipitated gels are purged briefly with nitrogen to drive off free methanol. The gels are removed from the aluminum cylinders with forceps, and placed on aluminum weighing pans. The pans with gels are vacuum dried for one hour at 125° C. The dried, cool gels are removed from aluminum weighing pans, and weighed directly on the top-loading analytical balance. The dry extracted gel weight is divided by the starting weight to give the percent gel content. Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC) Conventional GPC measurements were used to determine the weight-average (Mw) and number-average (Mn) molecular weight of the polymer, and to determine the MWD (=Mw/Mn). Samples were analyzed with a high-temperature GPC instrument (Polymer Laboratories, Inc. model PL220). The method employs the well-known universal calibration method, based on the concept of hydrodynamic volume, and the calibration was performed using narrow polystyrene (PS) standards along with four mixed A, 20 μm columns (PLgel Mixed A from Agilent (formerly Polymer Laboratory Inc.)), operating at a system temperature of 140° C. Samples were prepared at a “2 mg/mL” concentration, in 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene solvent. The flow rate was 1.0 mL/min, and the injection size was 100 microliters. The molecular weight determination was deduced by using narrow molecular weight distribution polystyrene standards (from Polymer Laboratories), in conjunction with their elution volumes. The equivalent polyethylene molecular weights were determined by using appropriate Mark-Houwink coefficients for polyethylene and polystyrene (as described by Williams and Ward in Journal of Polymer Science, Polymer Letters, Vol. 6, (621) 1968) to derive the following equation: [in-line-formulae]Mpolyethylene=a*(Mpolystyrene)b.[/in-line-formulae] In this equation, a=0.4316 and b=1.0. Weight average molecular weight (Mw) and number average molecular weight (Mn) were calculated in the usual manners. For example, Mw was calculated according to the following formula: Mw=Σ wi Mi, where wi and Mi are the weight fraction and molecular weight, respectively, of the ith fraction eluting from the GPC column. Polyethylene equivalent molecular weight calculations were performed using Viscotek TriSEC software Version 3.0. Differential Scanning calorimetry Differential Scanning calorimetry (DSC) can be used to measure melting temperature, crystallization temperature, and crystallinity of ethylene-based polymer (PE) samples and propylene-based polymer (PP) samples. About five to eight mg of sample is weighed and placed in a DSC pan. The lid is crimped on the pan to ensure a closed atmosphere. The sample pan is placed in a DSC cell, and then heated, at a rate of approximately 10° C./min, to a temperature of 180° C. for PE (230° C. for PP). The sample is kept at this temperature for three minutes. Then the sample is cooled, at a rate of 10° C./min, to −60° C. for PE (−40° C. for PP), and kept isothermally at that temperature for three minutes. The sample is next heated at a rate of 10° C./min, until complete melting (second heat). The percent crystallinity is calculated by dividing the heat of fusion (Hf), determined from the second heat curve, by a theoretical heat of fusion of 292 J/g for PE (165 J/g, for PP), and multiplying this quantity by 100 (for example, % cryst.=(Hf/292 J/g)×100 (for PE)). Unless otherwise stated, melting point(s) (Tm) of each polymer sample is determined from the second heat curve, obtained from DSC, as described above. The crystallization temperature (Tc) is measured from the first cooling curve. The Tm is the temperature measured at the peak of the endotherm, as shown on the heating curve. The Tc is the temperature measured at the peak of the exotherm, as shown on the cooling curve. Representative Thermoplastic Vulcanizate (TPV) Preparation: The following components were blended (dry mixed): EAO copolymer (EO or EB), peroxide, and coagent to form a preblend. The preblend was fed using a K-TRON SODER K2LS60 Loss-In-Weight Feeder. The compounding was performed on a 26-mm co-rotating twin screw extruder. The extruder consisted of twelve barrel sections, resulting in a total length-to-diameter ratio (L/D) of 60. The extruder was equipped with a 24 kW motor and a maximum screw speed of 1200 rpm. The feed system for this extrusion line consisted of two “loss-in-weight” feeders. Polypropylene was fed separately into the extruder. The oil was fed continuously to barrel 2 of the extruder using separate gear pumps. The TPV composition was pelletized using an underwater pelletization unit with a 1 hole die. Shore A Hardness Hardness measurements were taken with a Shore A type durometer. The durometer was placed onto a TPV plaque of approximately 3 mm thickness (0.125 inch), prepared according to the injection molding procedure above. Compression Set Compression set was measured according to ASTM D-395 at 23° C., 70° C. and 120° C. Pucks of diameter of 29 mm (±0.5 mm) were extracted from the compression molded plaques of approximately 3 mm (⅛ inch) thickness, as discussed above. For each sample, four pucks were inspected for notches, uneven thickness and inhomogeneity, and plaques that had good visual appearance were stacked, such that the total height was 12.5 mm (±0.5 mm), The final assembly was compressed to compressive strain of 25%. Per each TPV composition tested, the compression set analysis for each temperature/time measurement was performed on two test specimens, and the average of the two test specimens was recorded. The stacked pucks (final assembly) were placed in the compressive device, and locked into place; the apparatus was then placed at the appropriate temperature for specified time (22 hrs at 23° C.; 22 hrs at 70° C., and 70 hrs at 120° C.). In this test, the stress is released at the test temperature, and the thickness of the sample is measured after a 30 minutes equilibration period, at room temperature. Compression set is a measure of the degree of recovery of a sample following compression, and is calculated according to the equation CS=(H0−H2)/(H0−H1), where H0 is the original thickness of the sample, H1 is the thickness of the spacer bar used, and H2 is the final thickness of the sample after removal of the compressive force. Injection Molding Thermoplastic vulcanizate (TPV) pellets were injection molded using a Krauss Maffei injection molder with the axxicon mold system. Table 5 provides the conditions of the injection molding of the test plaques which were “4 inch×6 inch×0.125 inch” in dimension. About twelve test plaques were prepared for each TPV composition.

The die cut specimens were cut from injection molded plaques, which were prepared as described under the above Injection Molding section. Tensile properties (modulus, tensile strength and elongation) were measured at room temperature, following the method of ASTM D-412, in the machine direction, on an INSTRON Model 1122, made by INSTRU-MET Corporation. Tear Strength Tear strength (Die C) were determined according to standard test method ASTM D 624. Test specimens are cut from the injection molded plaque using cutting dies conforming to Type-C shape described in ASTM D624. The test is done on an INSTRON. The rate of jaw separation shall be 500±50 mm/min, the test specimen is strained until it is completely ruptured. The maximum force is recorded and the tear strength is calculated by the formula: [in-line-formulae]Ts=F/d [/in-line-formulae] Where: F=the maximum force, in lb and D=the median thickness of each test specimen, in inch Tape Extrusion: A Haake Rheocord System 9000 torque rheometer with a Rheomix 254 extruder was used to prepare the extruded tapes. The Rheomix 254 is a 25 L/D single screw extruder equipped with ¾ inch screw and four zones. The extrusion process parameters were optimized for each material based on its rheological properties. A 0.25 mm thick tape sample with smooth surface was produced with each TPV material. Extrusion Surface Quality The surface quality of extruded tape made from the TPV compound was evaluated using a visual rating of the tape appearance and smoothness, its uniform edges and smooth surface. Additionally, the surface roughness can be measured using a profilometer. Typically surface roughness can be in the range from 0.0001 to 0.0002 mm. A “fail rating” results when raise surfaces are visually apparent on the tape surface, to give the film a coarse surface texture. A coarse surface texture is indicative of poor dispersion of the rubber phase, and may also represent an incomplete phase inversion (when thermoplastic polymer (e.g., PP) becomes the continuous phase). A “pass rating” results when the tape has a smooth, uniform surface.
