This invention refers to the refinement of vegetal raw fibres, suoh as oooos fibres, fibrous filamente eto., &y tre£ating them, with alkaline liquids at inoreased tem¬ peratures» The vegetal raw fibres obtainable in trade, when freed from, their bedding substanoe after the usual methods, e.g» by roasting and a mechanical after-treatment3 are, as is known, not suited to important praotioal purposes owing to their hardness and insufficient flexibility» In acoordanoe with the present invention it is possible to change raw fibres of this hind, without impair-* ing their breaking or tearing resistanoe, into a soft and, moreover, elastic state by a treatment with diluted alkaline lyes at raised temperatures, eventually followed by an after- : treatment, e*g» with hygrosoopio means or fat'» or oil-like substances, or with means of both kinds. As alkaline sub- stanoes there may be used e*g» oaustio alkalies, alkali car-' bonates and the like, eventually mixtures of various sub-* etanoes of this kind» The concentration of the lyes must be kept rather low, as the fibrous material would be acted upon too strongly when applying lyes of a higher conoentration» For instanoe, in the case of sofia lye, the lye concentration should generally not exceed 10%, but mostly the treatment oan be managed with lyes the oonoentration of whioh, e,g» in oaustio soda, amounts to less than 5%, e.g. S-3%„ It was found that through the aotion of suoh dilut¬ ed lyes on the fibrous material freed from the bedding sub¬ stance at temperatures lying above 100° C», e»g» when working in a olosed vessel, the fibres oan be isolated within a very short time from the crusts rendering them hard, as e,g* sili¬ cic acid, lignine and the like, to suoh an extent that the above mentioned good qualities oonoeming their softness, elastioity eto, will be attained, tfiTlJs this process, the I t duration of the treatment generally requiree considerably lees than one hour and mostly less than 40 minutes; when applying temperatures of e*g« between 120-185° C», it usually takes only 20-30 minutée and sometimes even a shorter time» Further researches have shown that the orusts render-- ing the fibre hard may also be suoessfully treated at low ten-< peratures below the boiling temperature by applying weak al~> kaline liquids. But then the duration of the treatment must be extended so muoh that the diluted lye is allowed to pene¬ trate into the interior of the fibre and there to exercise the emsollient action desired» With the applioation of a soda lye of e.g* 2-3%f the treatment in the open container at tempera¬ tures of between 75 and lOOO c., e.g. suoh of 80-95° C. f gene¬ rally requires more than *£• hours, e.g. 2-3 hours» In this oaee, the duration of the action depends on the degree of tem¬ perature and the concentration of the lye. At temperatures of e+g» from 90-100° the mork mill be effected somewhat more quickly than mith temperatures lying below. In this case, too the use of strongly diluted lyee, e.g. of suoh with 2-3% NaOS, has generally proved expedient. w-u ' ing rne invenovoii may be carried out e.g. by treattitervb the raw fibre freed from the bedding substance with a soda lye of 2,5% in a closed vessel at a temperature of approximately "135° for about 20 minutes, during which process the lye should preferably be kept in oiroulation* When working in the open container with lyes of an equal concentration at temperatures of about 90°, the duration of the treatment is extended to the time required for obtaining the good properties desired, e.g. to 2£ hours and more. As the fibres serving as starting material are practically free from the bedding substance, the lye will not become impure in a considerable degree. Therefore it can be Vl 335718 employed again and again after the oonewned amount of alkali has ï>een. replaeed, e*g« in such a nannef iliat it is led in a oivoulation through the oontainer in whioh the treatment is performed. After the fibres t?i.u8 treated have been washed gnd dried, they are softi remarkably elastic and easily co-> lourable* Moreover, their volume weight is very low, while their resistanoe against moisture and atmospherio influences is great* For some praotioal purposes it has proved ad¬ vantageous that the fibres rendered soft and elastic through the treatment with the lye are submitted, afte? their being completely washed and dried, to an after-treatment with hygroaoopio substances, e*gK with watery glyceric or mag¬ nesium chloride solùHonss or with substances containing fat or oil, e*g» with emulsions of fatty acids, or with sub¬ stances of both kinds. The fibrous material treated in accordance with the invention is refined to such an extent that the fibre can directly be used for spinning. A essential advantage, however, consists in its being an excellent substitute for horsehair and thus represent" ing a first-class stuffing or padding material, either in itself or Jointly with other suitable substances, e.g. animal hair, such as goafs,hair, hogs bristles and the like» As the refined fibre is easily colourable, it can also be made similar to the horsehair on its outside, e.g.by giving it a black dye after the known methods. Their appli¬ cation for upholstering purposes may be effected in /he usual manner, for instance by that the e.g. novel products con¬ sisting of the refined vegetal fibrous material or of mix-- tures of the same with suitable additional substances are fitted on the coating in a similar way» ,»*» 3 -i SSSTls WHAT I CLAIM IS: 1.
