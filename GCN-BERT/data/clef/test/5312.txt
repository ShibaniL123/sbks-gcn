BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention This present invention relates to heterocyclic compounds, which are pyridine derivatives, and which have human neutrophil elastase inhibitory properties. The present invention also relates to the use of such compounds for the treatment of certain diseases and conditions. 2. Discussion of the Background Human neutrophil elastase (FINE) is a 32 kDa serine proteinase found in the azurophilic granules of neutrophils. It has a role in the degradation of a wide range of extracellular matrix proteins, including fibronectin, laminin, proteoglycans, Type III and Type IV collagens as well as elastin (see Bieth, G. In Regulation of Matrix accumulation, Mecham, R. P. (Eds), Academic Press, NY, USA 1986, 217-306, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). HNE has long been considered to play an important role in homeostasis through repair and disposal of damaged tissues via degradation of the tissue structural proteins. It is also relevant in the defense against bacterial invasion by means of degradation of the bacterial body. In addition to its effects on matrix tissues, HNE has been implicated in the upregulation of IL-8 gene expression and also induces IL-8 release from the epithelial cells of the lung. In animal models of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease induced by tobacco smoke exposure, both small molecule inhibitors and protein inhibitors of HNE inhibit the inflammatory response and the development of emphysema (see Wright, J. L. et al. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2002, 166, 954-960; Churg, A. et al. Am. J. Respir. Grit. Care Med. 2003, 168, 199-207, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties). Thus, HNE may play a role both in matrix destruction and in amplifying inflammatory responses in chronic respiratory diseases where neutrophil influx is a characteristic feature. Indeed, HNE is believed to play a role in several pulmonary diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis (CF), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pulmonary emphysema, pneumonia, and lung fibrosis. It is also implicated in several cardiovascular diseases in which tissue remodeling is involved, for example, in heart failure and the generation of ischaemic tissue injury following acute myocardial infarction. COPD is an umbrella term encompassing three different pathological conditions, all of which contribute to limitation of airflow: chronic bronchitis, emphysema and small-airway disease. Generally all three will exist to varying extents in patients presenting with COPD, and all three may be due to neutrophil-mediated inflammation, as supported by the increased number of neutrophils observed in bronchoalveolar leakage (BAL) fluids of COPD patients (see Thompson, A. B.; Daughton, D.; et al. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1989, 140, 1527-1537, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). The major pathogenic determinant in COPD has long been considered to be the protease-anti-protease balance (also known as the ‘elastase:anti-elastase hypothesis’), in which an imbalance of HNE and endogenous antiproteases such as α1-antitrypsin (α1-AT), secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI) and pre-elafin leads to the various inflammatory disorders of COPD. Individuals that have a genetic deficiency of the protease inhibitor α1-antitrypsin develop emphysema that increases in severity over time (see Laurrell, C. B.; Erikkson, S Scand. J. Clin. Invest. 1963 15, 132-140, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). An excess of HNE is therefore destructive, leading to the breakdown of pulmonary morphology with loss of elasticity and destruction of alveolar attachments of airways in the lung (emphysema) whilst simultaneously increasing microvascular permeability and mucus hypersecretion (chronic bronchitis). Thus, there remains a need for compounds which exhibit human neutrophil elastase inhibitory properties. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Accordingly, it is one object of the present invention to provide novel compounds which exhibit human neutrophil elastase inhibitory properties. It is another object of the present invention to provide novel pharmaceutical compositions which contain such a compound. It is another object of the present invention to provide novel methods of treating and/or preventing certain diseases and conditions by administering such a compound. These and other objects, which will become apparent during the following detailed description, have been achieved by the inventors' discovery of novel compounds of formula (I) described below, which are inhibitors of HNE, and are useful in the treatment of diseases or conditions in which FINE activity plays a part.

and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. The therapeutic utility of the present compounds is pertinent to any disease that is known to be at least partially mediated by the action of human neutrophil elastase. For example, the present compounds may be beneficial in the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis (CF), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pulmonary emphysema, pneumonia, Bronchiectasis and lung fibrosis. The invention also concerns pharmaceutical formulations comprising, as an active ingredient, a compound of the invention. Other compounds may be combined with compounds of this invention for the prevention and treatment of inflammatory diseases of the lung. Thus the invention also concerns pharmaceutical compositions for preventing and treating inflammatory diseases of the lung comprising a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention and one or more other therapeutic agents. Suitable therapeutic agents for a combination therapy with compounds of the invention include: (1) a corticosteroid, for example fluticasone or budesonide; (2) a β2-adrenoreceptor agonist, for example salmeterol or formoterol; (3) a leukotriene modulator, for example montelukast or pranlukast; (4) anticholinergic agents, for example selective muscarinic-3 (M3) receptor antagonists such as tiotropium bromide; (5) phosphodiesterase-IV (PDE-IV) inhibitors, for example roflumilast or cilomilast; (6) an antitussive agent, such as codeine or dextromethorphan; and (7) a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent (NSAID), for example ibuprofen or ketoprofen. The weight ratio of the first and second active ingredients may be varied and will depend upon the effective dose of each ingredient. Generally, an effective dose of each will be used. The magnitude of prophylactic or therapeutic dose of a compound of the present invention will, of course, vary with the nature of the severity of the condition to be treated and with the particular compound and its route of administration, and will generally be determined by clinical trial as required in the pharmaceutical art. It will also vary according to the age, weight and response of the individual patient. In general, the daily dose range will lie within the range of from about 0.001 mg to about 100 mg per kg body weight of a mammal, preferably 0.01 mg to about 50 mg per kg, and most preferably 0.1 to 10 mg per kg, in single or divided doses. On the other hand, it may be necessary to use dosages outside these limits in some cases. Another aspect of the invention provides pharmaceutical compositions which comprise a compound of the invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The term “composition,” as in pharmaceutical composition, is intended to encompass a product comprising the active ingredient(s), and the inert ingredient(s) (pharmaceutically acceptable excipients) that make up the carrier, as well as any product which results, directly or indirectly, from combination, complexation or aggregation of any two or more of the ingredients, or from dissociation of one or more of the ingredients, or from other types of reactions or interactions of one or more of the ingredients. Accordingly, the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention encompass any composition made by admixing a compound of the invention, additional active ingredient(s), and pharmaceutically acceptable excipients. The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention comprise a compound of the present invention as an active ingredient or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and may also contain a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and optionally other therapeutic ingredients. The term “pharmaceutically acceptable salts” refers to salts prepared from pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic bases or acids including inorganic bases or acids and organic bases or acids. Any suitable route of administration may be employed for providing a mammal, especially a human, with an effective dosage of a compound of the present invention. In therapeutic use, the active compound may be administered by any convenient, suitable or effective route. Suitable routes of administration are known to those skilled in the art, and include oral, intravenous, rectal, parenteral, topical, ocular, nasal, buccal and pulmonary (by inhalation). Compositions suitable for administration by inhalation are known, and may include carriers and/or diluents that are known for use in such compositions. The composition may contain 0.01 to 99% by weight of active compound. Preferably, a unit dose comprises the active compound in an amount of 1 μg to 10 mg. The most suitable dosage level may be determined by any suitable method known to one skilled in the art. It will be understood, however, that the specific amount for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors, including the activity of the specific compound that is used, the age, body weight, diet, general health and sex of the patient, time of administration, the route of administration, the rate of excretion, the use of any other drugs, and the severity of the disease undergoing treatment. For delivery by inhalation, the active compound is preferably in the form of microparticles. They may be prepared by a variety of techniques, including spray-drying, freeze-drying and micronization. By way of example, a composition of the present invention may be prepared as a suspension for delivery from a nebulizer or as an aerosol in a liquid propellant, for example for use in a pressurised metered dose inhaler (PMDI). Propellants suitable for use in a PMDI are known to the skilled person, and include CFC-12, HFA-134a, HFA-227, HCFC-22 (CCl2F2) and HFA-152 (CH4F2 and isobutane). In a preferred embodiment, a composition of the invention is in dry powder form, for delivery using a dry powder inhaler (DPI). Many types of DPI are known. Microparticles for delivery by administration may be formulated with excipients that aid delivery and release. For example, in a dry powder formulation, microparticles may be formulated with large carrier particles that aid flow from the DPI into the lung. Suitable carrier particles are known, and include lactose particles; they may have a mass median aerodynamic diameter of greater than 90 μm. In the case of an aerosol-based formulation, a preferred composition is: Compound of the invention 24 mg/canister Lecithin, NF Liq. Conc. 1.2 mg/canister Trichlorofluoromethane, NF 4.025 g/canister Dichlorodifluoromethane, NF 12.15 g/canister. Compounds of the present invention may be used in combination with other drugs that are used in the treatment/prevention/suppression or amelioration of the diseases or conditions for which present compounds are useful. Such other drugs may be administered, by a route and in an amount commonly used therefore, contemporaneously or sequentially with a compound of the invention. When a compound of the invention is used contemporaneously with one or more other drugs, a pharmaceutical composition containing such other drugs in addition to the compound of the invention is preferred. Accordingly, the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention include those that also contain one or more other active ingredients, in addition to a compound of the invention. The agents of the invention may be administered in inhaled form. Aerosol generation can be carried out using, for example, pressure-driven jet atomizers or ultrasonic atomizers, preferably using propellant-driven metered aerosols or propellant-free administration of micronized active compounds from, for example, inhalation capsules or other “dry powder” delivery systems. The active compounds may be dosed as described depending on the inhaler system used. In addition to the active compounds, the administration forms may additionally contain excipients, such as, for example, propellants (e.g. Frigen in the case of metered aerosols), surface-active substances, emulsifiers, stabilizers, preservatives, flavorings, fillers (e.g. lactose in the case of powder inhalers) or, if appropriate, further active compounds. For the purposes of inhalation, a large number of systems are available with which aerosols of optimum particle size can be generated and administered, using an inhalation technique which is appropriate for the patient. In addition to the use of adaptors (spacers, expanders) and pear-shaped containers (e.g. Nebulator®, Volumatic®), and automatic devices emitting a puffer spray (Autohaler®), for metered aerosols, in particular in the case of powder inhalers, a number of technical solutions are available (e.g. Diskhaler®, Rotadisk®, Turbohaler® or the inhalers for example as described EP-A-0505321, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). Methods of Synthesis. The present invention further provides a process for the preparation of a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or quaternary salt thereof as defined above. Compounds of the invention may be prepared according to routes illustrated below in Schemes 1-18. The skilled person may introduce, where appropriate, suitable variations to the conditions specifically described in the experimentals in order to adapt the synthetic routes to the provision of further compounds of the invention. Such variations may include, but are not limited to, use of appropriate starting materials to generate different compounds, changes in the solvent and temperature of reactions, replacements of reactives with analogous chemical role, introduction or removal of protection/deprotection stages of functional groups sensitive to reaction conditions and reagents. Also, introduction or removal of specific synthetic steps oriented to further functionalization of the chemical scaffold may be contemplated and is included within the scope of the present invention. Processes, which can be used and are described and reported in Examples and Schemes, should not be viewed as limiting the scope of the synthetic methods available for the preparation of the compounds of the invention. Compounds used as starting materials or intermediates may be commercially available, their preparation may be specifically described in the literature, or they may be prepared according to methods available in the literature and well known to the person skilled in the art. In some instances, procedures for the preparation of intermediates or starting materials may be also provided in the examples. The process described is particularly advantageous as it is susceptible of being properly modulated, through any proper variant known to the skilled person, so as to obtain any of the desired compounds of the invention. Such variants are comprised within the scope of the present invention. From all of the above, it should be clear to the skilled person that any of the described groups may be present as such or in any properly protected form. In particular, functional groups present in the intermediate and compounds and which could generate unwanted side reaction and by-products, need to be properly protected before the alkylation, acylation, coupling or sulfonylation takes place. Likewise, subsequent deprotection of those same protected groups may follow upon completion of the said reactions.

Other features of the invention will become apparent in the course of the following descriptions of exemplary embodiments which are given for illustration of the invention and are not intended to be limiting thereof. EXAMPLES General Experimental Details NMR spectra were obtained on a Varian Unity Inova 400 spectrometer with a 5 mm inverse detection triple resonance probe operating at 400 MHz or on a Bruker Avance DRX 400 spectrometer with a 5 mm inverse detection triple resonance TXI probe operating at 400 MHz or on a Bruker Avance DPX 300 spectrometer with a standard 5 mm dual frequency probe operating at 300 MHz. Shifts are given in ppm relative to tetramethylsilane. The following abbreviations have been used: br=broad signal, s=singlet, d=doublet, dd=double doublet, t=triplet, td=triplet of doublets, q=quartet, m=multiplet. NMR analysis of compounds purified by HPLC showed various amounts of formic acid equivalents (not described). Purification by chromatography refers to purification using the CombiFlash® Companion purification system or the Biotage SP1 purification system. Where products were purified using an Isolute® SPE Si II cartridge, ‘Isolute SPE Si cartridge’ refers to a pre-packed polypropylene column containing unbonded activated silica with irregular particles with average size of 50 μm and nominal 60Å porosity. For alternative purification, where an Isolute® SCX-2 cartridge was used, ‘Isolute® SCX-2 cartridge’ refers to a pre-packed polypropylene column containing a non-end-capped propylsulphonic acid functionalised silica strong cation exchange sorbent. Similarly, where products were purified by ‘Isolute® PE-AX cartridge, this refers to a pre-packed polypropylene column containing a silica-based sorbent with a chemically bonded quaternary ammonium functional group. Where thin layer chromatography (TLC) has been used, it refers to silica gel TLC using plates, typically 3×6 cm silica gel on aluminium foil plates with a fluorescent indicator (254 nm), (e.g. Fluka 60778). All solvents and commercial reagents were used as received. Compounds purified by preparative HPLC were purified using a C18-reverse-phase column (100×22.5 mm i.d Genesis column with 7 μm particle size or 250×21.2 mm i.d. Gemini column with 5 μm particle size), or a Phenyl-cHexyl column (250×21.2 mm i.d. Gemini column with 5 μm particle size), UV detection at 220, 230 or 254 nm, flow 10-20 mL/min, eluting with gradients from 95-5 to 5-95% water/acetonitrile or water/MeOH containing 0.1% TFA or 0.1% formic acid. Fractions containing the required product (identified by TLC and/or LCMS analysis) were pooled, the organic fraction removed by evaporation, and the remaining aqueous fraction lyophilised, to give the final product. Reactions were not carried out under an inert atmosphere unless specified. Microwave experiments were carried out using a Biotage Initiator 60™ which uses a single-mode resonator and dynamic field tuning. Temperature from 40-250° C. can be achieved, and pressures of up to 30 bar can be reached. Compound names were generated using the Autonom 2000 feature in MDL ISIS™/Draw 2.5 SP2 software.

Detailed synthetic pathways and procedures for specific examples are outlined in Examples 1-61. Examples 62-97 were prepared according to procedures described above and their 1H NMR and LCMS data are reported. In the procedures that follow, after each starting material, reference to a compound number is sometimes provided. This is provided merely for assistance to the skilled chemist. The starting material may not necessarily have been prepared from the batch referred to. When reference is made to the use of a “similar” or “analogous” procedure, as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, such a procedure may involve minor variations, for example reaction temperature, reagent/solvent amount, reaction time, work-up conditions or chromatographic purification conditions. Example 1 4-{5-[2-Amino-7-methyl-8-(3-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyridin-6-yl]-pyrazol-1-yl}-benzonitrile Step 1. 5-Bromo-4-methyl-3-(3-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-pyridin-2-ylamine (Intermediate 1) 5-Bromo-3-iodo-4-methyl-pyridin-2-ylamine (20.0 g, 63.9 mmol) and 3-(trifluoromethyl)benzene boronic acid (12.73 g, 67.0 mmol) were mixed with sodium carbonate (2 M, 160 mL, 320 mmol), toluene (570 mL) and IMS (190 mL) and degassed. 1,1′-bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocenepalladium (II) dichloride dichloromethane (3.13 g, 36.83 mmol) was added and the reaction mixture was degassed again before heating to reflux for 2 hrs. A second reaction was carried on 1.08 times the scale. The two batches were combined and the solvent was removed in vacuo and the resulting mixture was partitioned between DCM and water. The organic phase was separated and was washed with water, dried (Na2SO4) and concentrated in vacuo. The resultant residue was purified by flash chromatography through a pad of silica, eluting with a gradient of 5-30% EtOAc in cyclohexane to give the title compound as a beige solid (34.6 g). LC-MS (Method 1): Rt=3.30 min, m/z=331/333 [M+H]+ Step 2. 6-Bromo-7-methyl-8-(3-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyridin-2-ylamine (Intermediate 2) 5-Bromo-4-methyl-3-(3-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-pyridin-2-ylamine (Int. 1, 12.0 g, 36.25 mmol) was stirred in dioxane (250 mL) at RT and ethoxycarbonyl isothiocyanate (4.27 mL, 36.25 mmol) was added dropwise. The reaction mixture was stirred for 18 hrs, then the solvent was evaporated in vacuo. The resultant residue was dissolved in MeOH/IMS (1:1, 460 mL) and hydroxylamine hydrochloride (12.58 g, 181 mmol) was added and the reaction mixture was heated to 60° C. DIPEA (18.6 mL, 109 mmol) was added, and the reaction mixture was heated for a further 4.5 rs before allowing to cool. The resultant precipitate was collected by filtration, washed with MeOH and dried to afford the title compound as a white solid (11.49 g). LC-MS (Method 2): Rt=3.45 min, m/z=371/373 [M+H]+ Step 3. 4-(5-Tributylstannanyl-pyrazol-1-yl)-benzonitrile (Intermediate 3) Hexyl lithium (2.3 M in hexanes) (16.96 mL, 39.01 mmol) was added to a stirred solution of 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-piperidine (6.85 mL, 40.63 mmol) in dry THF (15 mL) at −30° C. and the resulting suspension was stirred for 20 minutes. The suspension was allowed to warm to 10° C. to aid dissolution and was added, via cannula, to a solution of 4-pyrazol-1-yl-benzonitrile (5.50 g, 32.51 mmol, prepared according to Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry Letters, 2006, 16(11), 2955-2959, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety) in THF (85 mL) at −78° C., keeping the internal reaction temperature<-50° C. The resulting reaction mixture was stirred at −75° C. for 4 hrs and tributyl tin(IV) chloride (9.08 mL, 33.49 mmol) was added keeping the internal reaction temperature<-60° C. during addition. The reaction mixture was stirred at −60° C. for 1.5 rsh then allowed to warm to RT. The resulting solution was quenched by addition of EtOAc (100 mL) and then washed with water (2×50 mL) followed by saturated brine (50 mL). The organic extract was dried (Na2SO4), filtered and concentrated in vacuo. The resultant residue was purified by flash chromatography, eluting with a gradient of 0-5% EtOAc in pentane to give the title compound as an amber oil that solidified on standing (10.11 g). LC-MS (Method 1): Rt=5.36 min, m/z=459 [M+H]+ Step 4. 4-{5-[2-Amino-7-methyl-8-(3-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyridin-6-yl]-pyrazol-1-yl}-benzonitrile (Example 1) 6-Bromo-7-methyl-8-(3-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyridin-2-ylamine (Int. 2, 100 mg, 0.27 mmol) and 4-(5-tributylstannanyl-pyrazol-1-yl)-benzonitrile (Int. 3, 115 mg, 0.25 mmol) were dissolved in THF (5 mL) and degassed then bis(triphenylphosphine)palladium (II) dichloride (18 mg, 0.025 mmol) was added. The reaction mixture was stirred at reflux temperature for 21 hrs then allowed to cool before washing with cesium fluoride (saturated aqueous solution) and extracting with EtOAc (2×30 mL). The combined organic extracts were filtered and the filtrate was concentrated in vacuo. The resultant residue was subjected to preparative C18 HPLC, eluting with a gradient 40-90% MeCN in water (+0.1% formic acid) to afford 51 mg of an impure title compound (containing 25% starting material) which was dissolved in THF (3 mL) with 4-(5-tributylstannanyl-pyrazol-1-yl)-benzonitrile (Int. 3, 4.72 g, 0.103 mmol) and degassed before addition of bis(triphenylphosphine)palladium (II) dichloride (10 mg, 0.014 mmol). The reaction mixture was heated at 75° C. for 6.5 h then purified using an SCX-2 cartridge (loading in MeOH/eluting with 2 N NH3 in MeOH). The resultant residue was taken up in MeOH (5 mL) and treated with 3-mercaptopropylethyl sulfide silica (PhosphonicS SPM 32, 0.5 eq by weight) and stirred at 50° C. for 1 hr then filtered and evaporated. The resultant residue was dissolved in DCM then filtered and evaporated in vacuo before further purification by preparative C18 HPLC, eluting with a gradient 40-90% MeCN in water (+0.1% formic acid) to give the title compound as a white solid (25 mg).
