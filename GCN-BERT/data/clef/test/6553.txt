Schnur, et al in U.S. Pat. No. 5,747,498 and EP0817775B1 disclose a process for the preparation of Erlotinib free base and its HCl salt, which follows the pathway as given in the Scheme-1. N-(3-ethynylphenyl)-6,7-bis(2-methoxyethoxy)-4-quinazolinamine (Erlotinib) base is separated chromatographically and converted to the hydrochloride salt in a solvent, such as, chloroform using hydrochloric acid. Though the disclosure provide some acid-addition salt e.g. hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulphuric, phosphoric, methanesulfonic, benzenesulfonic, trifluoroacetic, citric, lactic or maleic acid, however, it only demonstrates predominately the process for the preparation of erlotinib hydrochloride. EP1044969B1 provides a process for preparing N-(3-ethynylphenyl)-6,7-bis(2-methoxyethoxy)quinazolin-4-amine which involves stirring 4-[3-[[6,7-bis(2-methoxyethoxy)-4-quinazolinyl]amino]phenyl]-2-methyl-3-butyn-2-ol with anhydrous sodium hydroxide and 2-methoxyethanol and heating at reflux for 47 hours. The reaction mixture is cooled to 20 to 25 degree C. and concentrated hydrochloric acid is added to it. The resulting mixture is granulated at 20 to 25° C. to crystallize the product. WO 2007/138612 provides a process for preparation of N-(3-ethynylphenyl)-6,7-bis(2-methoxyethoxy)-4-quinazolinamine hydrochloride which involves treatment in the end with a polar solvent containing hydrochloric acid with Erlotinib free base to provide Erlotinib hydrochloride. Norris et al in WO 01/34574 and its equivalent U.S. Pat. No. 6,900,221 described polymorphic Forms-A and B of Erlotinib HCl, and mentioned that the polymorphic form ‘B’ is thermodynamically more stable. This patent, also described that product obtained as per U.S. Pat. No. 5,747,498 was a mixture of polymorphic Forms A and B. Further, Norris et al in U.S. Pat.

Bubendorf et al in U.S. Pat. No. 7,148,231 and its corresponding International Application published as WO 2004/072049 disclosed a novel polymorph E along with its DSC and XRD characteristics. This crystalline polymorphic form E is prepared particularly in (α,α,α)-trifluoro toluene, which is highly flammable and dangerous for the environment. The solvent is not only expensive solvent but also have inconvenience to handle on industrial scale. Jyothi Prasad Ramanadham et al in US 20100261738 A1 disclosed other stable polymorphic forms of Erlotinib HCl designated as Form-M, Form-N and Form-P. These forms were prepared from solvent systems selected from methanol with a solution of HCl in dry methanol or isopropanol (Form-M); isopropanol with isopropanolic HCl (Form-N) and methylene chloride with isopropanolic HCl (Form-P).

Individual embodiments of the present invention are detailed herein below separately. In one embodiment of the present application, it provides Erlotinib hydrochloride (I) crystalline Form-SE characterized by X-ray powder diffraction pattern comprising at least 5 characteristic peaks at diffraction angles (expressed in 2θ°) selected from the XRPD peak set of 5.60, 10.00, 11.40, 13.00, 13.50, 15.20, 18.40, 20.65, 21.86, 23.5, 31.80, 32.13, 32.80, 34.40±0.20 2θ°.

Erlotinib hydrochloride crystalline Form-SE of the present invention is further characterized by X-ray powder diffraction pattern substantially according to FIG. 1, DSC isothermal pattern substantially according to FIG. 2 and IR absorption spectrum substantially according to FIG. 3. Minor variations in the observed 2θ° angles values may be expected based on the analyst person, the specific XRPD diffractometer employed and the sample preparation technique. Further possible variations may also be expected for the relative peak intensities, which may be largely affected by the non-uniformity of the particle size of the sample. Hence, identification of the exact crystalline form of a compound should be based primarily on observed 2 theta angles with lesser importance attributed to relative peak intensities. The 2 theta diffraction angles and corresponding d-spacing values account for positions of various peaks in the X-ray powder diffraction pattern. D-spacing values are calculated with observed 2 theta angles and copper K a wavelength using the Bragg equation well known to those of having skill in the art of XRPD diffractometry science. In view of possibility of marginal error in the assigning 2 theta angles and d-spacings, the preferred method of comparing X-ray powder diffraction patterns in order to identify a particular crystalline form is to overlay the X-ray powder diffraction pattern of the unknown form over the X-ray powder diffraction pattern of a known form. For example, one skilled in the art can overlay an X-ray powder diffraction pattern of an unidentified crystalline form of Erlotinib hydrochloride over FIG. 1 and readily determine whether the X-ray diffraction pattern of the unidentified form is substantially the same as the X-ray powder diffraction pattern of the crystalline form of this invention. If the X-ray powder diffraction pattern is substantially the same as FIG. 1, the previously unknown crystalline form of Erlotinib hydrochloride can be readily and accurately identified as the crystalline Form SE of this invention. The crystalline Form-SE of Erlotinib hydrochloride is an anhydrate, which may be evident from the FIG. 4 showing the TGA thermogram. A sample of the crystalline Form SE prepared by the inventors had moisture content upto about 0.3% w/w by KF method, which also confirmed the anhydrate nature of the compound. While the invention is not limited to any specific theory, it should be understood however that the crystalline form SE of Erlotinib hydrochloride may contain additional residual or unbound moisture without losing its anhydrate character and/or its anhydrate crystalline form-SE characteristics. Nevertheless, one of the skill in the art should be able to determine whether they are same crystalline forms or not, by looking at the overall shape of the X-ray powder diffraction pattern optionally with help of other thermal data like DSC or TGA. In yet another embodiment of the present invention, it provide a process/es for preparing Erlotinib hydrochloride crystalline Form-SE is characterized by X-ray powder diffraction pattern comprising at least 5 characteristic 2θ° peaks selected from the XRPD peak set of 5.60, 10.00, 11.40, 13.00, 13.50, 15.20, 18.40, 20.65, 21.86, 23.5, 31.80, 32.13, 32.80, 34.40±0.20 2θ°, DSC isotherm comprising the endothermic peaks ranging between 213 to 217° C. (Peak -1) and 225 to 235° C. (Peak -2) and IR absorption characteristic peaks at approximately 3278 cm−1, 1948 cm−1, 1871 cm−1, 1632 cm−1, 1164 cm−1, 1024 cm−1, 940 cm−1 and 742 cm−1 comprising the steps of— a. Combining the Erlotinib free base or salt with a mixture of ketone and alcohol solvent both having water content upto less than 0.5% w/wb. raise the temperature upto about 40-70° C.c. Stir the solution at same temperature up to a time between 15 to 60 minutes.d. combine isopropanol and HCl mixturee. optionally maintain the mixture for 10-60 minutesf. cooling the mixture upto about 10-40° C.g. isolating the crystalline material Step of combining the Erlotinib free base or salt with a mixture of ketone and alcohol comprise either mixing or suspending or making solution with Erlotinib free base or salt obtained by any process/any form with a readymade or freshly prepared mixture of ketone and alcohol solvent both having individually as well as after mixing—a water content up to less than 0.5% w/w. In the process of preparing mixed solvent solution, alcohol solvent is selected from C2 to C4 alcohol and ketone solvent may be selected from C3 to C10 ketone. In one of the particular embodiment, C3 alcohol as isopropanol and C6 ketone as methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK) was used for preparing Form-SE. Preparation of mixed solvent solution of ketone and alcohol comprise a mixture of ketone and alcohol solvent having ratio between 30:70 to 70:30 v/v. In one of the particular embodiment, solvent mixture utilized for making Form SE was of alcohol and ketone in ratio of (50:50 v/v). During combining Erlotinib free base or salt with a mixture of ketone and alcohol, a ratio of Erlotinib free base or salt w.r.t. mixture of ketone and alcohol is important in order to obtain the specifics of the crystalline polymorph to meet, which comprise a range between 1:30-70 (w/v). More preferably, this range may be 1:40-60 (w/v). Any form of Crude or Pure Erlotinib base or its hydrochloride salt obtained by known processes may be used for preparing Form-SE. In the step of raising the temperature in the range about 40-70° C., it preferred to raise the heating gradually followed by continued stir the solution at same temperature up to a time ranging between 15 to 60 minutes. In steps of combining isopropanol and HCl mixture, it is comprising of slow addition of isopropanol (IPA) and HCl mixture, wherein isopropanol and HCl mixture prepared earlier by combining HCl gas and IPA is comprising of HCl strength ranging between 5 to 20% w/v. After combining this acidic alcohol mixture, the solution may optionally be maintain under stirring for a time ranging between 10-60 minutes in order to retain the maximum hydro chlorination with unreacted erlotinib base present if any. If the process is started with Erlotinib HCl salt, this step may not be desired and the solution may be subjected to cooling simultaneously. The step of cooling the mixture may be carried out for the mixture upto about 10-40° C. as per need to attain the crystalline material precipitated out with no or minimal possible degradation if any. Simultaneously, it is also essentially required to cool the solution in the successive lower rate of cooling in order to retain the characteristics of Form-SE, while achieving the pure crystal formation. The process related impurities, including unreacted intermediates, side products, degradation products and other medium dependent impurities, that appears in the impurity profile of the Erlotinib hydrochloride can substantially be removed by the process of the present invention resulting in the formation crystalline form-SE. A substantially pure product having purities more than 99.5% (by HPLC) can be obtained by the process of the present invention. In view of maintaining the equilibrium to the impurity profile compliance, the process requires quality checks, while raising the temperature, wherever required upto 40-70° C. The product may be isolated from the reaction mass by conventional processes including filtering and optional drying, which may be carried out at room temperature for the suitable durations to retain the crystalline polymorphic form characteristics. Crystalline Form-SE can be recovered by conventional processes, which are not limited to scrapping, breaking, triturating and if required conventional drying.
