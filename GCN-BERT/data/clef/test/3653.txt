157.3: 2-[5-(2-chloro-3-fluorophenyl)-3-[2-(methylsulphonimidoyl)ethyl]-2,4-dioxo-pyrimidin-1-yl]methyl acetate
1.7 g (5.2 mmol) of iodobenzene diacetate is added to a solution containing 1.4 g (3.5 mmol) of [5-(2-chloro-3-fluorophenyl)-3-(2-methanesulphinyl-ethyl)-2,4-dioxo-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrimidin-1-yl]-methyl acetate, 786 mg (7 mmol) of 2,2,2-trifluoroacetamide, 560 mg (13.9 mmol) of magnesium oxide and 184 mg (0.4 mmol) of dirhodium tetraacetate in 42 ml of dichloromethane. The mixture is stirred at room temperature for 4 hours, then filtered and evaporated. The residue is taken up in 42 ml of methanol, and then 2.4 g (17.4 mmol) of potassium carbonate is added. The mixture is stirred at room temperature for 30 minutes, then the methanol is evaporated and the residue is taken up in ethyl acetate and then water. The aqueous phase is extracted twice with ethyl acetate. The organic phase is washed with water, dried over magnesium sulphate, filtered and evaporated. After purification by silica gel chromatography eluted with ethyl acetate and then with 10% methanol, 460 mg (32%) of 2-[5-(2-chloro-3-fluorophenyl)-3-[2-(methylsulphonimidoyl)ethyl]-2,4-dioxo-pyrimidin-1-yl]methyl acetate is obtained in the form of a pale yellow solid.
