Compound 132B (100 mg, 0.63 mmol), triethoxyphosphine (300 mg, 1.9 mmol) and zinc iodide (302 mg, 0.95 mmol) were dissolved in dioxane (10 mL). The mixture was stirred at 80 Â°C for 14 hours and diluted by addition of water and ethyl acetate. The organic phase was washed with saturated NaCl solution, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by preparative thin layer chromatography to give compound 132C (110 mg, 72%).
