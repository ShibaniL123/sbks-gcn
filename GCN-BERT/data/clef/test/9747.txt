CONTINUITY COMPOSITIONS AND METHODS OF MAKING AND USING THE SAME BACKGROUND [0001] A major focus of the polyolefin industry in recent years has been on the development of new catalysts that deliver new and improved products. In this regard, metallocene catalysts, for example, are now widely used to produce polyolefin polymers, such as polyethylene polymers. While there are many advantages to using metallocene catalysts in olefin polymerization, there remain significant challenges. For example, metallocene catalysts, in particular supported metallocene catalysts, may be more prone to causing reactor fouling which may cause disruption and premature shutdown of the reactor. This is particularly the case in particle forming processes, such as gas and slurry phase processes. Adding other reagents to the polymerization process, such as antifouling agents or continuity additives/aids or continuity compositions, have been used to address such fouling issues. [0002] In order to address reactor fouling problems caused by high activity metallocene catalysts, additives such as metal carboxylate salts may be added to the process, either separately or as part of the supported catalyst composition, such as in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,608,153, 6,300,436 and 5,283,278. [0003] U.S. Pat. Appln. Pubn. No. 2010/0292418 discloses a process for producing olefin based polymers in the presence of a continuity composition comprising an aluminum carboxylate and a fatty amine alkoxylate. The composition is prepared by mixing, for example, solid aluminum distearate and solid ethoxylated stearyl amine in mineral oil. The particular ethoxylated stearyl amine utilized is a commercially available form designated as AS-990, which contains ethoxylated stearyl amine and particulate silica. [0004] However, components employed to address reactor fouling, such as the above mentioned metal carboxylate salts and/or fatty amines, often present handing difficulties. For example continuity compositions based on such components may be time consuming to prepare and often show inconsistent behavior. Mixing solid components, even under slurry conditions, can result in the formation of agglomerates which may adversely affect flowability and make the solid or slurry difficult to dry to the low moisture levels desirable for olefin polymerization. The use of higher temperature drying can be detrimental as this may cause the viscosity of a slurry derived from solid components to significantly increase, possibly through gelling mechanisms, making the slurry difficult to handle. [0005] Therefore, despite the various continuity compositions known, challenges remain. Thus, it would be desirable to provide continuity compositions useful in olefin polymerization that are advantageous to prepare and handle and are also capable of operating in a polymerization process continuously with enhanced reactor operability. SUMMARY [0006] In a first aspect there is provided a continuity composition comprising at least one metal carboxylate salt wherein said metal carboxylate salt is modified with at least one molten fatty amine. [0007] The continuity composition may further comprise at least one liquid vehicle. Non- limiting examples of liquid vehicles include mineral oils, aromatic hydrocarbons or aliphatic hydrocarbons. [0008] The at least one fatty amine may be represented by the formula: (R xN(R2OH)y wherein Ri is a hydrocarbyl radical having from 9 to 40 carbon atoms; R2 is a hydrocarbyl radical having from 1 to 8 carbon atoms; and x has a value of 1 or 2 and x + y = 3. Ri may be a hydrocarbyl radical having from 14 to 26 carbon atoms. R2 may be methyl, ethyl, n- propyl, n-butyl or iso-propyl. [0009] The at least one metal carboxylate salt may be represented by the formula: M(Q)x (OOCR)y where M is a metal from Group 3 to 16 and the Lanthanide and Actinide series, Q is halogen, hydrogen, a hydroxy or hydroxide, alkyl, alkoxy, aryloxy, siloxy, silane or sulfonate group, R is a hydrocarbyl radical having from 1 to 100 carbon atoms; and x is an integer from 0 to 3 and y is an integer from 1 to 4 and the sum of x and y is equal to the valence of the metal. [0010] The at least one metal carboxylate salt may also be represented by the formula: (R!C02)2A10H wherein Ri is a hydrocarbyl radical containing from 12 to 30 carbon atoms. [0011] The at least one metal carboxylate salt may comprise an aluminum carboxylate. Additionally, the metal carboxylate salt may comprise an aluminum mono-stearate, an aluminum di-stearate, an aluminum tri-stearate, or a combination thereof. [0012] When a liquid vehicle is present, the continuity composition may comprise at least one fatty amine in an amount greater than or equal to about 0.5%, or 1%, or 2%, or 3%, or 4%, or 5%, or 6%, or 7%, or 8%, or 10%, or 15% by weight, based on the total weight of the continuity composition including liquid vehicle. [0013] When a liquid vehicle is present, the continuity composition may comprise at least one metal carboxylate salt in an amount greater than or equal to about 0.5%, or 1%, or 2%, or 3%, or 4%, or 5%, or 6%, or 7%, or 8%, or 10% or 15% by weight, based on the total weight of the continuity composition including liquid vehicle. [0014] The continuity composition may comprise: a) 2-20 wt.% of at least one metal carboxylate salt, b) 2-20 wt.% of at least one fatty amine, and c) at least one liquid vehicle; based on the total weight percent of a), b) and c). [0015] The continuity composition may also comprise: a) 3-15 wt.% of at least one metal carboxylate salt, b) 3-15 wt.% of at least one fatty amine, and c) at least one liquid vehicle; based on the total weight percent of a), b) and c). The continuity composition may also comprise any one of or any combination of the features above. [0016] The at least one fatty amine may further comprise a particulate inorganic oxide. Non limiting examples of particulate inorganic oxides include silica or alumina. The at least one fatty amine may also be free of particulate inorganic oxides. The at least one fatty amine may also be free of silica or alumina. The at least one fatty amine may also be substantially free of particulate inorganic oxides.

The terms "substantially free" or "essentially free," when used in this disclosure, mean that the relevant compound comprises less than 1 wt%, less than 0.5 wt%, less than 0.2 wt%, or 0 wt% of the noted material. [0017] The continuity compositions disclosed herein possess advantageous properties. They may be dried to low moisture levels in relatively short periods of time with excellent batch to batch consistency. Metal carboxylate salts which have been contacted with molten fatty amine surprisingly offer continuity compositions which facilitate ease of drying and result in compositions having enhanced flowability and handling qualities. Without wishing to be bound by theory, the molten fatty amine likely favorably interacts with the metal carboxylate salt so as form a coating. The continuity compositions perform well in continuous olefin polymerization processes in terms of catalyst activity and/or process continuity. [0018] Further, modification of metal carboxylates with molten fatty amines presents advantages in moisture removal techniques. For example, the continuity compositions may be dried at higher temperatures, optionally under vacuum, and, further, optionally with the aid of nitrogen purging and/or sparging. This may allow production of continuity compositions of very low moisture content having advantageous application in olefin polymerization processes. Exemplary moisture levels include below 1000 ppm, below 500 ppm, or below 200 ppm. Further, flowability of the continuity compositions is enhanced relative to comparative compositions prepared with non-molten fatty amines.

[0020] Accordingly, there is provided a process for producing a continuity composition, comprising the step of contacting at least one metal carboxylate salt with at least one molten fatty amine.

[0083] Additionally, one or more metallocene catalyst compounds or catalyst systems may be used in combination with one or more conventional-type catalyst compounds or catalyst systems. Non-limiting examples of mixed catalysts and catalyst systems are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4, 159,965, 4,325,837, 4,701,432, 5, 124,418, 5,077,255, 5,183,867, 5,391,660, 5,395,810, 5,691,264, 5,723,399 and 5,767,031 and PCT Publication WO 96/23010 published Aug. 1, 1996. [0084] It is further contemplated that two or more conventional-type transition metal catalysts may be combined with one or more conventional-type cocatalysts. Non-limiting examples of mixed conventional-type transition metal catalysts are described in for example U.S. Pat.

Activators and Activation Methods for Catalyst Compounds [0085] An activator is defined in a broad sense as any combination of reagents that increases the rate at which a transition metal compound oligomerizes or polymerizes unsaturated monomers, such as olefins. The catalyst compounds may be activated for oligomerization and/or polymerization catalysis in any manner sufficient to allow coordination or cationic oligomerization and/or polymerization. [0086] The activator may be a Lewis-base, such as for example, diethyl ether, dimethyl ether, ethanol, or methanol. Other activators that may be used include those described in WO 98/07515 such as tris (2,2 ',2"- nonafluorobiphenyl) fluoroaluminate. [0087] Combinations of activators may be used. For example, alumoxanes and ionizing activators may be used in combinations, see for example, EP-B 1 0 573 120, WO 94/07928 and WO 95/14044 and U.S. Pat. Nos. 5, 153, 157 and 5,453,410. WO 98/09996 describes activating metallocene catalyst compounds with perchlorates, periodates and iodates including their hydrates. WO 98/30602 and WO 98/30603 describe the use of lithium (2,2'-bisphenyl- ditrimethylsilicate).4THF as an activator for a metallocene catalyst compound. WO 99/18135 describes the use of organo-boron-aluminum activators. EP-Bl-0 781 299 describes using a silylium salt in combination with a non-coordinating compatible anion. WO 2007/024773 suggests the use of activator-supports which may comprise a chemically -treated solid oxide, clay mineral, silicate mineral, or any combination thereof. Also, methods of activation such as using radiation (see EP-B l-0 615 981), electro-chemical oxidation, and the like are also contemplated as activating methods for the purposes of rendering the neutral metallocene catalyst compound or precursor to a metallocene cation capable of polymerizing olefins. Other activators or methods for activating a metallocene catalyst compound are described in, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,849,852, 5,859,653 and 5,869,723 and PCT WO 98/32775. [0088] Alumoxanes may also be utilized as an activator in the catalyst composition. Alumoxanes are generally oligomeric compounds containing— A1(R)— O— subunits, where R is an alkyl group. Examples of alumoxanes include methylalumoxane (MAO), modified methylalumoxane (MMAO), ethylalumoxane and isobutylalumoxane. Alkylalumoxanes and modified alkylalumoxanes are suitable as catalyst activators, particularly when the abstractable ligand is a halide. Mixtures of different alumoxanes and modified alumoxanes may also be used. For further descriptions, see U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,665,208, 4,952,540, 5,041,584, 5,091,352, 5,206, 199, 5,204,419, 4,874,734, 4,924,018, 4,908,463, 4,968,827, 5,329,032, 5,248,801, 5,235,081, 5, 157, 137, 5, 103,031 and EP 0 561 476 Al, EP 0 279 586 B l, EP 0 516 476 A, EP 0 594 218 Al and WO 94/10180. [0089] Alumoxanes may be produced by the hydrolysis of the respective trialkylaluminum compound. MMAO may be produced by the hydrolysis of trimethylaluminum and a higher trialkylaluminum such as triisobutylaluminum. MMAO's are generally more soluble in aliphatic solvents and more stable during storage. There are a variety of methods for preparing alumoxane and modified alumoxanes, non-limiting examples of which are described in, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,665,208, 4,952,540, 5,091,352, 5,206,199, 5,204,419, 4,874,734, 4,924,018, 4,908,463, 4,968,827, 5,308,815, 5,329,032, 5,248,801, 5,235,081, 5,157, 137, 5,103,031, 5,391,793, 5,391,529, 5,693,838, 5,731,253, 5,731,451, 5,744,656, 5,847, 177, 5,854, 166, 5,856,256 and 5,939,346 and European publications EP-A-0 561 476, EP-Bl-0 279 586, EP-A-0 594-218 and EP-Bl-0 586 665, WO 94/10180 and WO 99/15534. A visually clear methylalumoxane may be used. A cloudy or gelled alumoxane can be filtered to produce a clear solution or clear alumoxane can be decanted from the cloudy solution. Another alumoxane is a modified methyl alumoxane (MMAO) cocatalyst type 3A (commercially available from Akzo Chemicals, Inc. under the trade name Modified Methylalumoxane type 3A, disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,041,584). [0090] An ionizing or stoichiometric activator, neutral or ionic, such as tri (n-butyl) ammonium tetrakis (pentafluorophenyl) boron, a trisperfluorophenyl boron metalloid precursor or a trisperfluoronapthyl boron metalloid precursor, polyhalogenated heteroborane anions (see, for example, WO 98/43983), boric acid (see, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,942,459) or combinations thereof, may also be used. The neutral or ionic activators may be used alone or in combination with alumoxane or modified alumoxane activators. [0091] Examples of neutral stoichiometric activators may include tri-substituted boron, tellurium, aluminum, gallium and indium or mixtures thereof. The three substituent groups may be each independently selected from the group of alkyls, alkenyls, halogen, substituted alkyls, aryls, arylhalides, alkoxy and halides. The three substituent groups may be independently selected from the group of halogen, mono or multicyclic (including halosubstituted) aryls, alkyls, and alkenyl compounds and mixtures thereof; in a class of embodiments are alkenyl groups having 1 to 20 carbon atoms, alkyl groups having 1 to 20 carbon atoms, alkoxy groups having 1 to 20 carbon atoms and aryl groups having 3 to 20 carbon atoms (including substituted aryls). Alternatively, the three groups are alkyls having 1 to 4 carbon groups, phenyl, napthyl or mixtures thereof. The three groups may be halogenated, in an embodiment fluorinated, aryl groups. In yet other illustrative embodiments, the neutral stoichiometric activator is trisperfluorophenyl boron or trisperfluoronapthyl boron. [0092] Ionic stoichiometric activator compounds may contain an active proton, or some other cation associated with, but not coordinated to, or only loosely coordinated to, the remaining ion of the ionizing compound. Such compounds and the like are described in, for example, European publications EP-A-0 570 982, EP-A-0 520 732, EP-A-0 495 375, EP-Bl-0 500 944, EP-A-0 277 003 and EP-A-0 277 004, and U.S. Pat.

Supports [0093] The above described catalyst compounds may be combined with one or more supports using one of the support methods well known in the art or as described below. For example, in the catalyst compound may be used in a supported form, such as, deposited on, contacted with, or incorporated within, adsorbed or absorbed in, or on the support. [0094] As used herein, the term "support" refers to compounds comprising Group 2, 3, 4, 5, 13 and 14 oxides and chlorides. Suitable supports include, for example, silica, magnesia, titania, zirconia, montmorillonite, phyllosilicate, alumina, silica-alumina, silica-chromium, silica-titania, magnesium chloride, graphite, magnesia, titania, zirconia, montmorillonite, phyllosilicate, and the like.

In some embodiments, the surface area of the support is in the range is from about 100 to about 400 m2/g and the support has a pore volume of from about 0.8 to about 3.0 cc/g and an average particle size of from about 5 to about 100 μιη. [00100] The catalyst compounds may be supported on the same or separate supports together with an activator, or the activator may be used in an unsupported form, or may be deposited on a support different from the supported catalyst compound. [00101] There are various other methods in the art for supporting a polymerization catalyst compound. For example, the catalyst compound may contain a polymer bound ligand as described in, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,473,202 and 5,770,755; the catalyst may be spray dried as described in, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,648,310; the support used with the catalyst may be functionalized as described in European publication EP-A-0 802 203, or at least one substituent or leaving group is selected as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,688,880. Catalyst and Activator Compositions [00102] As indicated hereinbefore, a "catalyst composition" includes one or more catalyst components utilized to polymerize olefins and may also include at least one activator or alternatively, at least one cocatalyst. A catalyst composition may also include other components, for example, supports, and is not limited to the catalyst component and/or activator or cocatalyst alone or in combination. The catalyst composition may include any suitable number of catalyst components in any combination as described herein, as well as any activator or cocatalyst in any combination as described herein. [00103] It will also be understood that a "catalyst composition" may also contain one or more components known in the art to reduce or eliminate reactor fouling. [00104] As used herein, the term "activator composition" is any composition comprising one or more activators or cocatalysts capable of activating a catalyst to polymerize olefins. An activator composition may also include other components, for example, supports, and is not limited to the activator or cocatalyst alone or in combination. The activator composition may include any suitable number of activator components in any combination as described herein. [00105] It will also be understood that an "activator composition" may also contain one or more components known in the art to reduce or eliminate reactor fouling. Continuity Compositions [00106] As used herein, the term "continuity composition" is a composition comprising one or more components or additives or aids, such as solids or liquids, that are useful in gas phase or slurry phase polymerization processes to reduce or eliminate fouling of the reactor, where "fouling" may be manifested by any number of phenomena including sheeting of the reactor walls, plugging of inlet and outlet lines, formation of large agglomerates, or other forms of reactor upsets known in the art. [00107] Common to the continuity compositions described herein is that they comprise at least one metal carboxylate salt which is modified by and/or which has been contacted with at least one molten fatty amine. [00108] As used herein, the term "molten fatty amine" refers to a fatty amine that is substantially in the liquid state. Depending on the melting point of the fatty amine it will be understood that a fatty amine may be a liquid at ambient temperatures. Alternatively a fatty amine may be a solid or a wax at ambient temperatures. The application of heat may suitably convert solid or waxy fatty amines into liquids. The term "molten fatty amine" encompasses fatty amines that are liquids at ambient temperature and also fatty amines that are liquids at temperatures above ambient. Fatty amines which are in the liquid state either at ambient temperature or at a temperature above ambient may remain as liquids when slurried in a suitable liquid vehicle. For example, when a solid fatty amine is melted at a temperature above ambient temperature and the resulting liquid fatty amine added to a liquid vehicle which is at a lower temperature, then a liquid dispersion or emulsion may result. It will be understood that the term "molten fatty amine" includes dispersions of liquid fatty amines in suitable liquid vehicles, for example, dispersions of liquid fatty amines in mineral oil. [00109] The at least one fatty amine may be present in the continuity composition at from about 0.1 to about 90 wt%, based on the total weight of the continuity composition. Within this range, the at least one fatty amine may be present in the continuity composition preferably at greater than or equal to about 0.5%, or 5%, or 10%, or 20%, or 30%, or 40%, or 50%, or 60% or 70%, or 80%, based on the total weight of the continuity composition. Also within this range, the at least one fatty amine may be present in the continuity composition preferably at less than or equal to about 75%, or 65%, or 55%, or 45%, or 35%, or 25%, or 15%, based on the total weight of the continuity composition. The at least one fatty amine may be present in the continuity composition in an amount in the range that comprises any upper and any lower boundary disclosed above. [00110] The at least one metal carboxylate salt may be present in the continuity composition at from about 0.1 to about 90 wt%, based on the total weight of the continuity composition. Within this range, the at least one metal carboxylate salt may be present in the continuity composition at greater than or equal to about 0.5%, or 5%, or 10%, or 20%, or 30%, or 40%, or 50%, or 60% or 70%, or 80%, based on the total weight of the continuity composition. Also within this range, the at least one metal carboxylate salt may be present in the continuity composition at less than or equal to about 75%, or 65%, or 55%, or 45%, or 35%, or 25%, or 15%, based on the total weight of the continuity composition. The at least one metal carboxylate salt may be present in the continuity composition in an amount in the range that comprises any upper and any lower boundary disclosed above. [00111] The at least one fatty amine may be represented by the formula: (R xN(R2OH)y wherein Ri is a hydrocarbyl radical having from 9 to 40 carbon atoms; R2 is a hydrocarbyl radical having from 1 to 8 carbon atoms; and x has a value of 1 or 2 and x + y = 3. Ri may be a hydrocarbyl radical having from 14 to 26 carbon atoms. R2 may be methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, n-butyl or iso-propyl. Ri may also be a hydrocarbyl radical having from 14 to 26 carbon atoms and R2 may be ethyl. A non-limiting example of a fatty amine is octadecyl bis(2- hydroxyethyl)amine. [00112] As used herein, the term "metal carboxylate salt" is any mono- or di- or tri-carboxylic acid salt with a metal portion from the Periodic Table of Elements. Non-limiting examples include saturated, unsaturated, aliphatic, aromatic or saturated cyclic carboxylic acid salts. Examples of the carboxylate ligand include, but are not limited to, acetate, propionate, butyrate, valerate, pivalate, caproate, isobuytlacetate, t-butyl-acetate, caprylate, heptanate, pelargonate, undecanoate, oleate, octoate, palmitate, myristate, margarate, stearate, arachate and tercosanoate. Non-limiting examples of the metal portion includes a metal from the Periodic Table of Elements selected from the group of Al, Mg, Ca, Sr, Sn, Ti, V, Ba, Zn, Cd, Hg, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Pd, Li and Na. [00113] The carboxylate metal salt may be represented by the following general formula: M(Q)x (OOCR)y where M is a metal from Group 3 to 16 and the Lanthanide and Actinide series, preferably from Groups 8 to 13, more preferably from Group 13 with aluminum being most preferred; Q is halogen, hydrogen, a hydroxy or hydroxide, alkyl, alkoxy, aryloxy, siloxy, silane or sulfonate group R is a hydrocarbyl radical having from 1 to 100 carbon atoms; and x is an integer from 0 to 3 and y is an integer from 1 to 4 and the sum of x and y is equal to the valence of the metal. [00114] R in the above formula may be the same or different. Non-limiting examples of R include hydrocarbyl radicals having 2 to 100 carbon atoms that include alkyl, aryl, aromatic, aliphatic, cyclic, saturated or unsaturated hydrocarbyl radicals. R may be a hydrocarbyl radical having greater than or equal to 8 carbon atoms, greater than or equal to 12 carbon atoms, or greater than 14 carbon atoms. R may comprise a hydrocarbyl radical having from 17 to 90 carbon atoms, 17 to 72, or 17 to 54 carbon atoms. R may comprise 6 to 30 carbon atoms, 8 to 24 carbon atoms, or 16 to 18 carbon atoms (e.g., plamityl and stearyl). [00115] Non-limiting examples of Q in the above formula include one or more, same or different, hydrocarbon containing group such as alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, alkenyl, arylalkyl, arylalkenyl or alkylaryl, alkylsilane, arylsilane, alkylamine, arylamine, alkyl phosphide, alkoxy having from 1 to 30 carbon atoms. The hydrocarbon containing group may be linear, branched, or even substituted. Also, Q in one embodiment is an inorganic group such as a halide, sulfate or phosphate. [00116] The metal carboxylate salts may comprise aluminum carboxylates such as aluminum mono, di- and tri- stearates, aluminum octoates, oleates and cyclohexylbutyrates. The carboxylate metal salt may comprise [CH3(CH2)i6COO]3Al, an aluminum tri-stearate, [CH3(CH2)i6COO]2-Al-OH, an aluminum di-stearate, and CH3(CH2)i6COO-Al(OH)2, an aluminum mono-stearate. [00117] Other examples of metal carboxylate salts include titanium stearates, tin stearates, calcium stearates, zinc stearates, boron stearate and strontium stearates. [00118] The metal carboxylate salts for use herein may be essentially free of carboxylic acids, wherein the carboxylic acids are represented by the formula RCOOH, wherein R is a hydrocarbyl radical having from 6 to 30 carbon atoms. The metal carboxylate salt may have less than or equal to about 1 wt% of total free carboxylic acid, based on the total weight of the metal carboxylate salt as determined chromatographically, or less than or equal to about 0.5 wt%, or less than or equal to about 0.1 wt% of total free carboxylic acid, based on the total weight of the metal carboxylate salt. [00119] In an embodiment, the metal carboxylate salt which is essentially free of free acid is produced by extracting a metal carboxylate salt with an organic solvent having a dielectric constant at 25 °C of greater than 3.0. This polar solvent results in an improved extraction of the polar compounds including the free acids present in the crude metal carboxylate salt. In an embodiment, the metal carboxylate salt combined with the catalyst compound has been previously extracted with an organic solvent to remove carboxylic acids, Group 1 salts of carboxylic acids, and/or Group 2 salts of carboxylic acids, wherein the organic solvent is selected from the group consisting of Ci-Cio alcohols, Ci-Cio ketones, Ci-Cio esters, Ci-Cio ethers, Ci-Cio alkyl halides, Ci-Cio alkylonitriles, Ci-Cio dialkyl sulfoxides, and combinations thereof. In another embodiment, the organic solvent is selected from the group consisting of methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, butanol, acetone, methyl-ethyl ketone, methyl acetate, ethyl acetate, methyl propionate, methyl buterate, dimethyl ether, diethyl ether, 1,4-dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, chloroform, dichloromethane, acetonitrile, dimethyl sulfoxide, and combinations thereof. Such metal carboxylate salts, which are essentially free of carboxylic acids, are described in US Patent Application Pubn. No. 20130245215. [00120] The continuity composition may further comprise at least one liquid vehicle. Non- limiting examples of liquid vehicles include mineral oils, aromatic hydrocarbons or aliphatic hydrocarbons. Mineral oils are preferred liquid vehicles. [00121] The continuity composition may be in the form of a slurry in the one or more liquid vehicles at from about 1% to about 60% wt.% based on the total weight of the slurry. Within this range the continuity composition is present in the slurry at greater than or equal to about 1%, or 2%, or 4%, or 6%, or 10%, or 15%, or 20%, or 25%, or 30%, or 40%, or 50%, based on the total weight of the slurry. [00122] When a liquid vehicle is present, the continuity composition may comprise at least one fatty amine in an amount greater than or equal to about 0.5%, or 1%, or 2%, or 3%, or 4%, or 5%, or 6%, or 7%, or 8%, or 10%, or 12%, or 15% by weight, based on the total weight of the continuity composition including liquid vehicle. [00123] When a liquid vehicle is present, the continuity composition may comprise at least one metal carboxylate salt in an amount greater than or equal to about 0.5%, or 1%, or 2%, or 3%, or 4%, or 5%, or 6%, or 7%, or 8%, or 10% or 12% or 15% by weight, based on the total weight of the continuity composition including liquid vehicle. [00124] When a liquid vehicle is present the continuity composition may preferably comprise: a) 2-20 wt.% of at least one metal carboxylate salt, b) 2-20 wt.% of at least one fatty amine, and c) at least one liquid vehicle; based on the total weight percent of a), b) and c). [00125] Alternatively the continuity composition may preferably comprise: a) 3-15 wt.% of at least one metal carboxylate salt, b) 3-15 wt.% of at least one fatty amine, and c) at least one liquid vehicle; based on the total weight percent of a), b) and c). [00126] The fatty amine may further comprise a particulate inorganic oxide. Non limiting examples of particulate inorganic oxides include silica or alumina. The inorganic oxide may possess an average particle size in the range of from about 0.1 to about 100 μιη, or from about 0.5 to about 50 μιη, or from about 0.5 to about 20 μιη, or from about 0.5 to about 10 μιη. The amount of particulate oxide in the fatty amine may be from 1 to 50 wt% based on the total weight of fatty amine and inorganic oxide. The amount of particulate oxide in the fatty amine may be from 5 to 30 wt%, based on the total weight of fatty amine and inorganic oxide. Additionally, the amount of particulate oxide in the fatty amine may be from 7 to 20 wt% based on the total weight of fatty amine and inorganic oxide. Additional Continuity Additives/Aids [00127] In addition to the "continuity compositions" described above, it may also be desirable to use one or more additional continuity additives to, for example, aid in regulating static levels in the reactors. The continuity additive may be used as a part of the catalyst composition or introduced directly into the reactor independently of the catalyst composition. The continuity additive may be supported on the inorganic oxide of the supported catalyst composition described herein. [00128] Non-limiting examples of continuity additives include fatty amines, amide-hydrocarbon or ethoxylated-amide compounds such as described as "surface modifiers" in WO 96/1 1961; carboxylate compounds such as aryl-carboxylates and long chain hydrocarbon carboxylates, and fatty acid-metal complexes; alcohols, ethers, sulfate compounds, metal oxides and other compounds known in the art. Some specific examples of continuity additives include 1,2- diether organic compounds, magnesium oxide, ARMOSTAT 310, ATMER 163, ATMER AS- 990, and other glycerol esters, ethoxylated amines (e.g., N,N-bis(2- hydroxyethyl)octadecylamine), alkyl sulfonates, and alkoxylated fatty acid esters; STADIS 450 and 425, KEROSTAT CE 4009 and KEROSTAT CE 5009. chromium N-oleylanthranilate salts, calcium salts of a Medialan acid and di-tert-butylphenol; POLYFLO 130, TOLAD 511 (a- olefin-acrylonitrile copolymer and polymeric polyamine), EDENOL D32, aluminum stearate, sorbitan-monooleate, glycerol monostearate, methyl toluate, dimethyl maleate, dimethyl furnarate, triethylamine, 3,3-diphenyl-3-(imidazol-l-yl)-propin, and like compounds. [00129] Any of the aforementioned additional continuity additives may be employed either alone or in combination as an additional continuity additive. [00130] Other additional continuity additives useful in embodiments disclosed herein are well known to those in the art. Regardless of which additional continuity additives are used, care should be exercised in selecting an appropriate additional continuity additive to avoid introduction of poisons into the reactor. In addition, in selected embodiments, the smallest amount of the additional continuity additives necessary to bring the static charge into alignment with the desired range should be used. [00131] The additional continuity additives may be added to the reactor as a combination of two or more of the above listed additional continuity additives. The additional continuity additive(s) may be added to the reactor in the form of a solution or a slurry, such as a slurry with a mineral oil, and may be added to the reactor as an individual feed stream or may be combined with other feeds prior to addition to the reactor. For example, the additional continuity additive may be combined with the catalyst or catalyst slurry prior to feeding the combined catalyst-static control agent mixture to the reactor. [00132] The additional continuity additives may be added to the reactor in an amount ranging from about 0.05 to about 200 ppmw, or from about 2 to about 100 ppmw, or from about 2 to about 50 ppmw, based on the polymer production rate. The additional continuity additives may also be added to the reactor in an amount of about 2 ppmw or greater, based on the polymer production rate. Methods of Making the Continuity Compositions [00133] A method for making the present continuity compositions may involve contacting one or more metal carboxylate salts with a molten fatty amine. It is understood that contacting may also refer to combining, blending, mixing, or the like. The contacting may take place in the presence or absence of a suitable liquid vehicle. [00134] The molten fatty amine may be slurried in a suitable liquid vehicle prior to contacting with the one or more metal carboxylate salts. The slurry may be a dispersion or emulsion of the fatty amine in the liquid vehicle. [00135] The at least one metal carboxylate salt and at least one fatty amine may be spray dried or spray congealed. The resulting spray dried powder may be subsequently slurried in a suitable liquid vehicle. The skilled person would be familiar with the various spray drying techniques known in the art. [00136] The product of combining the one or more metal carboxylate salts with the one or more molten fatty amines may be contacted with further metal carboxylate salt. The contacting may take place in the presence or absence of a suitable liquid vehicle. The contacting may take place in the presence of a liquid vehicle. The amount of further metal carboxylate salt added preferably results in a continuity composition having a total amount of metal carboxylate salt between about 2-20 wt.% and an amount of fatty amine between about 2-20 wt.% based on the total weight of metal carboxylate salts, fatty amine and liquid vehicle. [00137] The fatty amine may be heated in order to provide a free flowing liquid prior to contacting with the one or more metal carboxylate salts. The temperature required to melt that fatty amine will depend on its melting point. The temperature may be greater than 20°C, or 30°C, or 40°C, or 50°C, or 60°C, or 70°C, or 80°C, or 90°C, or 100°C, or 110°C, or 120°C, or 130°C. [00138] The molten fatty amine may be dried, that is, subjected to a process to reduce the level of moisture, prior to contacting with the one or more metal carboxylate salts. The drying temperature may be greater than 20°C, or 30°C, or 40°C, or 50°C, or 60°C, or 70°C, or 80°C, or 90°C, or 100°C, or 110°C, or 120°C, or 130°C. [00139] Contacting the one or more metal carboxylate salts with the molten fatty amine may be performed at elevated temperature. The temperature may be greater than 20°C, or 30°C, or 40°C, or 50°C, or 60°C, or 70°C, or 80°C, or 90°C, or 100°C, or 1 10°C, or 120°C, or 130°C. Additionally, the temperature may be greater than 20°C, or 30°C, or 40°C, or 50°C, or 60°C, or 70°C [00140] The continuity composition may be dried to remove residual moisture which may otherwise adversely affect the activity of olefin polymerization catalysts. The continuity composition may be dried at elevated temperatures preferably at greater than 20°C, or 30°C, or 40°C, or 50°C, or 60°C, or 70°C, or 80°C, or 90°C, or 100°C, or 1 10°C, or 120°C, or 130°C. Preferably the drying temperature may be less than 90°C, or 80°C, or 70°C, or 60°C, or 50°C, or 40°C. [00141] Drying of the continuity composition may be performed under vacuum conditions. Drying may also be facilitated by nitrogen purging or sparging through the solid or slurry. [00142] The continuity composition may contain less than 1000 ppm, or 800 ppm or 500 ppm, or 300 ppm, or 200 ppm moisture. Preferably the continuity composition contains no more than 200 ppm moisture. [00143] Techniques and equipment contemplated for use in the methods hereinbefore disclosed are understood. Mixing or contacting techniques may involve any mechanical mixing means, for example shaking, stirring, tumbling, spray drying and rolling. Another technique contemplated involves the use of fluidization, for example, in a fluid bed reactor vessel where circulated gases provide the contacting. Methods of Using the Continuity Compositions [00144] One skilled in the art recognizes that depending on the olefin polymerization composition used, certain conditions of temperature and pressure would be required to prevent, for example, a loss in the activity of the catalyst system. [00145] A continuity composition as hereinbefore described may be introduced directly into the polymerization reactor independently of a catalyst composition. The continuity composition may be in the form of a slurry in a suitable liquid vehicle. [00146] A continuity composition as hereinbefore described may also be introduced into the polymerization reactor along with a catalyst composition. That is, mixed with a catalyst composition. It will be appreciated that the exact method of introduction may vary depending on one or more of the conditions, temperature and pressure, the type of mixing apparatus, the quantities of the components to be combined, and even the mechanism for introducing the catalyst/continuity composition combination into the reactor. [00147] The ratios of amount of continuity composition to the amount of polymer produced in the reactor at any time may be between 0.5 ppm and 1000 ppm, between 1 ppm and 400 ppm , or between 5 ppm and 50 ppm. Polymerization Processes [00148] Polymerization processes may include solution, gas phase, slurry phase and a high pressure process or a combination thereof. In illustrative embodiments, a gas phase or slurry phase polymerization of one or more olefins at least one of which is ethylene or propylene is provided. Optionally, the reactor is a gas phase fluidized bed polymerization reactor. [00149] The continuity compositions as hereinbefore described are suitable for use in any prepolymerization and/or polymerization process over a wide range of temperatures and pressures. The temperatures may be in the range of from -60°C to about 280°C, from 50°C to about 200°C; from 60°C to 120°C, from 70°C to 100°C, or from 80°C to 95°C. [00150] In one embodiment, the present process is directed toward a solution, high pressure, slurry or gas phase polymerization process of one or more olefin monomers having from 2 to 30 carbon atoms, preferably 2 to 12 carbon atoms, and more preferably 2 to 8 carbon atoms. The process is particularly well suited to the polymerization of two or more olefins or comonomers such as ethylene, propylene, 1-butene, 1-pentene, 4-methyl- 1 -pentene, 1-hexene, 1-octene 1- decene or the like. [00151] Other olefins useful in the present process include ethylenically unsaturated monomers, diolefins having 4 to 18 carbon atoms, conjugated or nonconjugated dienes, polyenes, vinyl monomers and cyclic olefins. Useful monomers may include, but are not limited to, norbornene, norbornadiene, isobutylene, isoprene, vinylbenzocyclobutane, styrenes, alkyl substituted styrene, ethylidene norbornene, dicyclopentadiene and cyclopentene. In an illustrative embodiment of the present process, a copolymer of ethylene is produced, where with ethylene, a comonomer having at least one alpha-olefin having from 4 to 15 carbon atoms, preferably from 4 to 12 carbon atoms, and most preferably from 4 to 8 carbon atoms, is polymerized in a gas phase process. In another embodiment of the present process, ethylene or propylene is polymerized with at least two different comonomers, optionally one of which may be a diene, to form a terpolymer. [00152] In one embodiment, the present process is directed to a polymerization process, particularly a gas phase or slurry phase process, for polymerizing propylene alone or with one or more other monomers including ethylene, and/or other olefins having from 4 to 12 carbon atoms. The polymerization process may comprise contacting ethylene and optionally an alpha- olefin with one or more of the continuity compositions as hereinbefore described along with one or more catalyst compositions in a reactor under polymerization conditions to produce the ethylene polymer or copolymer. [00153] Suitable gas phase polymerization processes are described in, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,543,399, 4,588,790, 5,028,670, 5,317,036, 5,352,749, 5,405,922, 5,436,304, 5,453,471, 5,462,999, 5,616,661, 5,668,228, 5,627,242, 5,665,818, and 5,677,375, and European publications EP-A-0 794 200, EP-A-0 802 202, EP-A2 0 891 990, and EP-B-634 421. [00154] A slurry polymerization process generally uses pressures in the range of from about 1 to about 50 atmospheres and even greater and temperatures in the range of 0°C to about 120°C. In a slurry polymerization, a suspension of solid, particulate polymer is formed in a liquid polymerization diluent medium to which ethylene and comonomers and often hydrogen along with catalyst are added. The suspension including diluent is intermittently or continuously removed from the reactor where the volatile components are separated from the polymer and recycled, optionally after a distillation, to the reactor. The liquid diluent employed in the polymerization medium is typically an alkane having from 3 to 7 carbon atoms, preferably a branched alkane. The medium employed should be liquid under the conditions of polymerization and relatively inert. When a propane medium is used the process must be operated above the reaction diluent critical temperature and pressure. Preferably, a hexane or an isobutane medium is employed. [00155] A preferred polymerization process is referred to as a particle form polymerization, or a slurry process where the temperature is kept below the temperature at which the polymer goes into solution. Such technique is well known in the art, and described in for instance U.S. Pat. No. 3,248,179. Other slurry processes include those employing a loop reactor and those utilizing a plurality of stirred reactors in series, parallel, or combinations thereof. Non-limiting examples of slurry processes include continuous loop or stirred tank processes. Also, other examples of slurry processes are described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,613,484. Examples of solution processes are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,271,060, 5,001,205, 5,236,998 and 5,589,555. EXAMPLES [00156] It is to be understood that while the present disclosure has been described in conjunction with the specific embodiments thereof, the foregoing description is intended to illustrate and not limit the scope of the disclosure. Other aspects, advantages and modifications will be apparent to those skilled in the art to which the disclosure pertains. Therefore, the following examples are put forth so as to provide those skilled in the art with a complete disclosure and description of how to make and use the disclosed compositions, and are not intended to limit the scope of the disclosure. Comparative Composition [00157] A comparative continuity composition was prepared as a 50:50 mixture by weight of solid aluminum distearate and solid IRGASTAT AS-990 in Hydrobrite® 380 mineral oil. The reagents were mixed at 30°C and the resulting slurry was dried at 30°C under vacuum with nitrogen purge to less than 200 ppm moisture content. The resulting slurry contained about 10% by weight of each solid component based on the total weight of the slurry. IRGASTAT AS-990 is a commercially available mixture of octadecyl bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amine and amorphous silica. Attempts to dry the slurry at temperatures above 35°C resulted in gelling of the product. Inventive Composition 1 [00158] An inventive continuity composition was prepared as a 50:50 mixture by weight of solid aluminum distearate and molten IRGASTAT AS-990 in mineral oil. Aluminium distearate, prepared according to International Patent Application Publication No. WO 2012/074709 and mineral oil were heated to 75°C with stirring for 30 minutes. Molten AS-990 (80-85°C) was added to the mineral oil and aluminium distearate. The slurry was mixed for an additional 30 minutes at 75°C and then cooled to 15°C. The final composition contained 5 wt% aluminium distearate and 5 wt% AS-990. Inventive Composition 2 [00159] An inventive continuity composition was prepared by combining aluminum distearate and Hydrobrite® 380 mineral oil. The resulting slurry was then heated to about 65°C before molten octadecyl bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amine)was added. The slurry was dried at 65°C under vacuum and with nitrogen purge until the moisture level in the slurry was below 200 ppm. The final slurry contained 10 wt% aluminum distearate, 9 wt% octadecyl bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amine, and 81 wt% of Hydrobrite® 380 oil. Catalysts [00160] In the examples that follow catalyst Ά is bis(n-propyl- cyclopentadiene)hafniumdimethyl and methylalumoxane supported on silica. The catalyst was a dry powder and was injected directly into the fluidized bed of a polymerization reactor using purified nitrogen as a carrier. Methods of preparing the catalyst are disclosed in, for example, International Patent Application Publication No. WO 2014/01 1357. [00161] Catalyst Ά2' is similar in composition to catalyst Ά except that it is supported on a larger particle size silica. [00162] Catalyst 'B' is a bi-metallic catalyst comprising (tetramethylcyclopentadiene)(n- propylcyclopentadiene) zirconium dichloride and bis(2-(pentamethylphenylamido)ethyl)amine zirconium dibenzyl supported on fumed silica with methylalumoxane. Methods of preparing the catalyst are disclosed in, for example, U.S. Patent No. 6,271,325. This catalyst was a slurry in purified mineral oil. [00163] Catalyst 'C is a bi-metallic catalyst comprising bis(n-butylcyclopentadiene) zirconium dichloride and bis(2-(pentamethylphenylamido) ethyl)amine zirconium dibenzyl in a mole ratio of 1 :5.5, supported on fumed silica with methylalumoxane. Methods of preparing the catalyst are disclosed in, for example, U.S. Patent No. 6,271,325. This catalyst was a slurry in a mixture of purified mineral oil and Isopar™ C fluid. Polymerisation Testing [00164] The above described continuity compositions (comparative and inventive 1 and inventive 2) and catalysts (Al, A2, B and C) were tested in three pilot plant reactors of differing scale. Pilot Plant Reactor 1 [00165] A gas phase fluidized bed reactor of 0.35 meters internal diameter and 2.3 meters in bed height was utilized. The fluidized bed was made up of polymer granules and the gaseous feed streams of ethylene and hydrogen together with liquid 1-hexene comonomer were introduced below the reactor bed into the recycle gas line. The individual flow rates of ethylene, hydrogen and 1-hexene were controlled to maintain fixed composition targets. The ethylene concentration was controlled to maintain a constant ethylene partial pressure. The hydrogen was controlled to maintain constant hydrogen to ethylene mole ratio. The concentrations of all the gases were measured by an on-line gas chromatograph to ensure relatively constant composition in the recycle gas stream. The reacting bed of growing polymer particles was maintained in a fluidized state by the continuous flow of the make-up feed and recycle gas through the reaction zone. A superficial gas velocity of 0.6-0.9 meters/sec was used to achieve this. The reactor was operated at a total pressure of 2240 kPa. The reactor was operated at a constant reaction temperature of 105°C. The fluidized bed was maintained at a constant height by withdrawing a portion of the bed at a rate equal to the rate of formation of particulate product. The polymer production rate was in the range of 15-25 kg/hour. The product was removed semi-continuously via a series of valves into a fixed volume chamber. This product was purged to remove entrained hydrocarbons and treated with a small stream of humidified nitrogen to deactivate any trace quantities of residual catalyst. [00166] The continuity composition slurries were charged to an agitated slurry feeding vessel and were metered to the reactor at a rate to maintain the desired concentration in the bed based on polymer production rate. An inert hydrocarbon was used as a carrier medium. Results [00167] Pilot plant reactor 1 was operated using catalyst 'B' described above to produce a bimodal nominally 0.9495 density product. The reaction conditions were: Reaction Temperature 105°C C2 Partial Pressure 220 psia C6/C2 molar ratio 0.0055 H2/C2 molar ratio 0.002 As indicated in Table 1, based on material balance, the inventive 1 continuity composition gave about a 15% improvement in catalyst productivity over the comparative continuity composition. TABLE 1 - Inventive 1 and Comparative Compositions Pilot Plant Reactor 2 [00168] Another set of tests was carried out in a larger continuous pilot-scale gas phase fluidized bed reactor having a 0.6 meters internal diameter and 4.4 meters in bed height. The polymer production rate was in the range of 40-50 kg/hour. [00169] A series of experiments was undertaken to compare the comparative continuity composition with the inventive 2 continuity composition. A total of four experiments; two experiments using catalyst ΆΓ and two experiments using catalyst Ά2' were completed. Reactor gas compositions were held constant for each respective two part experiment to obtain accurate results on catalyst productivity and static differences. There were no significant differences in catalyst productivity and static trends observed. Table 2 below indicates that both continuity compositions gave comparable catalyst productivity based on material balance methods. Furthermore the reactor skin temperatures and static measurements indicated no difference in behavior. TABLE 2 - Comparison of Inventive 2 and Comparative Compositions on Catalyst 'Al' and Ά2' performance refers to the continuity composition feed rate based on polymer production rate. [00170] A further test was performed using catalyst 'B' under different process conditions and the results are summarized in Table 3. The inventive continuity composition showed an increase in catalyst productivity compared to the comparative continuity composition. The two continuity compositions showed comparable performance to each other with no reactor continuity issues experienced. TABLE 3 - Comparison of Inventive 2 and Comparative Compositions on Catalyst 'B' performance refers to the continuity composition feed rate based on polymer production rate. [00171] A further test was performed using catalyst 'C under different process conditions and the results are summarized in Table 4. The results show the catalyst productivity is comparable between the two continuity compositions with no significant differences. There were no significant differences in static or skin temperatures observed and no continuity issues were experienced. TABLE 4 - Comparison of Inventive 2 and Comparative Compositions on Catalyst 'C performance refers to the continuity composition feed rate based on polymer production rate. Pilot Plant Reactor 3 [00172] Another set of tests was performed in a large scale gas phase fluidized bed reactor of 2.44 meters internal diameter and 12.2 meters in bed height and utilizing catalyst 'C Production rate was around 4,500 kg/hr. [00173] The reactor was initially operated using the comparative continuity additive to produce a bimodal product suitable for blow molding applications with 23.7FI, and 0.9579 density. The reactor was then transitioned to the inventive 2 continuity composition and operated for 5 bed turnovers to produce a bimodal blow molding product with 30.2 FI, and 0.9582 density. The reactor was later transitioned from inventive 2 continuity composition to comparative continuity composition to produce a bimodal blow molding product with 30.9 FI, and 0.9584 density and operated for 2 bed turnovers. The reaction conditions for these experiments are as shown in Table 5 below. TABLE 5 - Comparison of Inventive 2 and Comparative Compositions on Catalyst 'C performance refers to the continuity composition feed rate based on polymer production rate The static profile remained close to baseline and was comparable for both inventive and comparative continuity compositions. [00174] Another set of tests was carried out in the large scale gas phase fluidized bed reactor. The reactor was operated using catalyst 'B' and inventive continuity composition 2 to produce a product suitable for pipe application with 5-7 FI and 0.9495 to 0.9505 density. The reactor was then operated under comparable conditions except for switching from inventive 2 to comparative continuity compositions to produce similar product at the following reaction conditions (Table 6). TABLE 6 - Comparison of Inventive 2 and Comparative Compositions on Catalyst 'B' performance refers to the continuity composition feed rate based on polymer production rate. The static profile remained close to baseline throughout the experiments. [00175] For the sake of brevity, only certain ranges are explicitly disclosed herein.
