FIELD The present invention relates to a candesartan cilexetil-containing preparation, and specifically to a stable candesartan cilexetil-containing preparation in which generation of related substances is inhibited during a production process or storage thereof. BACKGROUND Candesartan cilexetil, which is an angiotensin II receptor antagonist, is widely used as a therapeutic drug for hypertension. Regarding candesartan cilexetil, it is known that the crystals thereof are distorted by pressure, friction, heat or the like during granulation, tableting or the like in formulation process thereof, and as a result, the purity is decreased and over-time generation of related substances occurs. So far, various methods have been proposed for stabilizing candesartan cilexetil preparations. For example, Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. Hei 5-194218 describes that in order to stabilize a candesartan cilexetil preparation, a low-melting fatty oil-like substance is incorporated to inhibit the generation of related substances. Japanese PCT National Phase Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 2008-528456 describes that a hydrophilic substance with hydrocolloidal properties is incorporated to adequately stabilize the candesartan cilexetil, against its degradation during the tableting process. Japanese PCT National Phase Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 2010-522692 describes incorporating a pH adjuster to stabilize a candesartan cilexetil compound in the preparation. Japanese PCT National Phase Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 2010-535212 describes incorporating at least one kind of nonionic surfactants at a ratio of about 0.01 to 10% by weight with respect to the pharmaceutical composition. Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 2012-51829 describes incorporating sodium stearyl fumarate. Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 2012-149056 describes incorporating triethyl citrate. Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 2012-153629 describes incorporating stearic acid. Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 2012-162467 describes incorporating D-mannitol to perform fluidized-bed granulation. SUMMARY As described above, a method for improving the stability of the candesartan cilexetil in a preparation is desired. The present invention solves the above-described problems by means of a different method from methods reported so far. An object of the present invention is to provide a stable candesartan cilexetil-containing preparation in which generation of related substances is inhibited during a production process or storage thereof.

DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS The present inventors made a research on an additive capable of inhibiting generation of related substances in a candesartan cilexetil-containing preparation. As a result of the research, the present inventors found that generation of related substances in a candesartan cilexetil-containing preparation could be inhibited during the preparation process or storage thereof by incorporating lauromacrogol thereto, and thus completed the present invention. The present invention reports that lauromacrogol contributes to stabilization of candesartan cilexetil in a tablet for the first time in history. Hereinafter, a candesartan cilexetil-containing preparation according to the present invention will be described with reference to the drawings. The candesartan cilexetil-containing preparation according to the present invention is not limited to any of the following embodiments and examples. A candesartan cilexetil-containing preparation according to the present invention contains lauromacrogol. Specifically, lauromacrogol is contained at a ratio of 0.01 parts by weight or greater and 2.4 parts by weight or less with respect to 100 parts by weight of the candesartan cilexetil-containing preparation. In an embodiment according to the present invention, it is not preferable that lauromacrogol is contained at a ratio greater than 2.4 parts by weight with respect to 100 parts by weight of the candesartan cilexetil-containing preparation. When lauromacrogol is contained at a ratio greater than 2.4 parts by weight, the hardness of the tablet is decreased and the dissolution of candesartan cilexetil is decreased. Candesartan cilexetil is an active ingredient of a candesartan cilexetil-containing preparation according to the present invention, and has a chemical name of (RS)-1-[(cyclohexyloxy)carbonyloxy]ethyl 2-ethoxy-1-{[2â€²-(1H-tetrazole-5-yl)-biphenyl-4-yl]methyl}-1H-benzimidazole-7-carboxylate.

Between the particle size regulation and the tableting, a disintegrant, a lubricant or the like may be mixed. Among these operations, granulation may be performed by use of an apparatus such as, for example, an agitation granulator, a fluidized-bed granulator, a biaxial granulator or the like. Tableting may be performed by use of a commercially available tableting machine. In this embodiment, lauromacrogol is incorporated at a ratio of 2.4 parts by weight or less with respect to 100 parts by weight of the candesartan cilexetil-containing preparation. Preferably, lauromacrogol is incorporated at a ratio of 0.01 parts by weight or greater and 2.4 parts by weight or less with respect to 100 parts by weight of the candesartan cilexetil-containing preparation. In this embodiment, uncoated tablets or post-granulation uncoated granules may be coated. Coating is preferably performed by use of a film coating machine, a fluidized-bed granulator or the like. Coating can be performed with a coating agent well known in the art. Usable coating agents include, for example, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose, methylcellulose, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyethylene glycol, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose acetate succinate, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose phthalate, cellulose acetate phthalate, aminoalkyl methacrylate copolymer E, aminoalkyl methacrylate copolymer RS, methacrylic acid copolymer L, methacrylic acid copolymer LD, methacrylic acid copolymer S, dried methacrylic acid copolymer LD, ethyl acrylate-methyl methacrylate copolymer dispersion, sucrose and the like. According to a method for producing a candesartan cilexetil-containing preparation in this embodiment, lauromacrogol is incorporated.

Thus, the tablets were obtained. (Purity) On the tablets in Examples 1 through 8 and Comparative examples 1 through 4, the purity was evaluated. The purity evaluation was performed as follows. The tablets were stored at 40Â° C. at 75% RH for 2 weeks, and then a test was performed in conformity to the candesartan cilexetil tablet purity test described in the Japanese Pharmacopoeia Sixteenth Edition. Thus, the purity was measured. The measurement results are shown in FIG. 1 and FIG. 2. As can be seen from the results shown in FIG. 1 and FIG. 2, a smaller amount of related substances is detected in Examples 1 through 8 than in Comparative examples 1 and 3, in which lauromacrogol is not incorporated. It is also seen regarding Examples 1 through 8 that when the amount of lauromacrogol is larger, the detected amount of related substances is smaller. A low-melting fatty oil-like substance, such as macrogol 6000, is incorporated to inhibit the generation of related substances in the conventional art, as is described in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. Hei 5-194218. Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. Hei 5-194218 describes that in order to inhibit the generation of related substances, macrogol 6000 is incorporated at a ratio of 5 parts by weight with respect to 100 parts by weight of the candesartan cilexetil-containing preparation in the example. Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 2012-153629 describes that in order to inhibit the generation of related substances, stearic acid is incorporated at a ratio of 3.1 parts by weight or 6.2 parts by weight with respect to 100 parts by weight of the candesartan cilexetil-containing preparation in the example. In Comparative example 2, stearic acid as stabilizing agent in the conventional art is incorporated. In Comparative example 4, macrogol is incorporated. In these comparative examples, the detected amount of related substances is smaller than in Comparative examples 1 and 3 with no incorporation of stabilizing agent. However, stearic acid should be incorporated at a ratio of 6.7 parts by weight with respect to 100 parts by weight of the candesartan cilexetil-containing preparation to inhibit the generation of related substances at the same level as Example 3, as is shown in Comparative example 2. In Comparative example 4, macrogol 6000 should be incorporated at a ratio of 2.0 parts by weight with respect to 100 parts by weight of the candesartan cilexetil-containing preparation to inhibit the generation of related substances at the same level as Example 4 or 5 in which lauromacrogol is contained at a ratio of 0.16 parts by weight or less with respect to 100 parts by weight of the candesartan cilexetil-containing preparation. Stearic acid or macrogol needs to be incorporated in a larger amount than in Examples 1 through 8 in which lauromacrogol is incorporated. From these results, it is understood that the candesartan cilexetil-containing preparations in Examples 1 through 8, owing to containing lauromacrogol, can significantly inhibit generation of related substances with a smaller amount of the stabilizing agent than in the conventional art. (Hardness) Next, on the tablets in Examples 9 through 14, the relationship between the amount of lauromacrogol and the hardness of the tablets was examined. The hardness was measured as follows. The hardness of three tablets in each example was measured by a Schleuniger tablet hardness tester (MODEL 6D), and the average value thereof was set as the hardness of the tablets in the corresponding example. For measuring the hardness of tablets with a score therein, all such tablets were each set such that the surface with the score was directed upward and thus the score was perpendicular to the direction in which the hardness tester would push the tablet. The results of the hardness measurement on the tablets in Examples 9 through 14 are shown in FIG. 3. In addition, the amounts of lauromacrogol of the Examples with respect to 100 parts by weight of the candesartan cilexetil-containing preparation are shown in FIG. 3. As is clear from FIG. 3, regarding Examples 9 through 14, when the amount of lauromacrogol is larger, the hardness of the tablet is lower. (Dissolution) On the tablets in Examples 9 through 14, the relationship between the amount of lauromacrogol and the dissolution of candesartan cilexetil was examined. The dissolution of candesartan cilexetil was measured as follows. A test was performed in conformity to the description on the dissolution of candesartan cilexetil tablet in the Japanese Pharmacopoeia Sixteenth Edition, and the dissolution rate (%) in 45 minutes of candesartan cilexetil was measured. The results of the dissolution measurement of candesartan cilexetil on the tablets in Examples 9 through 14 are shown in FIG. 4. In addition, the amounts of lauromacrogol of the Examples with respect to 100 parts by weight of the candesartan cilexetil-containing preparation are shown in FIG. 4. As is clear from FIG. 4, regarding Examples 9 through 14, when the amount of lauromacrogol is larger, the dissolution of candesartan cilexetil from the tablet is lower. The present invention provides a stable candesartan cilexetil-containing preparation in which generation of related substances is inhibited during a production process or storage thereof. 1.
