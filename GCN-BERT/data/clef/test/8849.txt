Step 2: Synthesis of tert-butyl 4-((trimethylsilyl)ethynyl)-3,6-dihydropyridine-1(2H)-carboxylate
To a solution of tert-butyl 4-hydroxy-4-((trimethylsilyl)ethynyl)piperidine-1-carboxylate (5.8 g, 1 eq) in dichloromethane (195 ml) was added with Et3N (5.44 ml, 2 eq) and methanesulfonyl chloride (3.04 ml, 2 eq) at −10° C. The mixture was stirred for 12 hr at room temperature and then extracted with dichloromethane and water. The organic layer was washed with brine, dried over anhydrous MgSO4 and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was purified with column chromatography to prepare the title compound (3.3 g, 61%).
