Latin name of the genus and species claimed: Fragaria×ananassa Duch. Variety denomination: ‘Amandine’. BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a new and distinct strawberry variety. The varietal denomination of the new variety is ‘Amandine’. The new variety was designated by the breeder as ‘Amadine DA 47’. The new variety of strawberry was created in a breeding program by crossing two parents in 2005 in Le Barp, France; in particular, by crossing as seed parent an undistributed strawberry parent designated ‘88.09.06’ (unpatented) and as pollen parent an strawberry parent designated ‘Mara des Bois’ (U.S. Plant Pat. No. 8,517). Seed parent is a selection from breeder's program and has not been commercialized. The resulting seedling of the new variety was grown and asexually propagated by runners in Segovia, Spain, 3° 59′W., 41° 22′N., 2742 feet elevation. Clones of the new variety were further asexually propagated and extensively tested. This propagation and testing has demonstrated that the combination of traits disclosed herein which characterize the new variety are fixed and retained true to type through successive generations of asexual reproduction. The growing period in Gironde, France, where the observations were made, is between about May, 15 and October, 15 of each year, with a maximum production at about beginning July. ‘Amandine’ is a fully remontant (non flowering runners) variety that benefits from induction to flowering by very low chilling, usually a few hours are sufficient, preferably at temperatures of 7° C. or less. Among the characteristics which appear to distinguish the new variety from other varieties are a combination of traits which include: inflorescence that appears above relative to the foliage, same size of calyx relative to corolla and abundant production of orange red colored, cordiform shaped, and medium firm fruit, large fruit size, and early time of ripening (50% of plants with ripe fruits). The new variety ‘Amandine’ is distinguished there from its Seed parent ‘88.09.06’ (unpatented) in that the new variety is more vigorous and the production of commercial quality fruit of seed parent ‘88.09.06’ (unpatented) is about 478 g/plant compared to that of the new variety ‘Amandine’ of about 513 g/plant. The Seed parent ‘88.09.06’ (unpatented) shows a red fruit color about Medium Orange-Red 34C to Medium Orange-Red 34B less intense than in the new variety ‘Amandine’ about Medium Red 45B to Medium Red 45A. The new variety ‘Amandine’ is distinguished there from its pollen parent ‘Mara des Bois’ (U.S. Plant Pat. No. 8,517) in that the new variety has a larger fruit size of approximate 13 to 15 g/fruit compared to approximate 10 to 12 g/fruit of the pollen parent. The Pollen parent ‘Mara des Bois’ (U.S. Plant Pat. No. 8,517) shows a more intense red fruit color about Medium Red 46B to Dark Red 46A compared to that of the new variety ‘Amandine’ of about Dark Red 45B to Dark Red 45A. The new variety ‘Amandine’ is closest to the variety ‘Charlotte’ (unpatented) but is distinguished therefrom by having a flat globose habit compared to flat in ‘Charlotte’ (unpatented). The shape of base of terminal leaflet in ‘Charlotte’ (unpatented) is obtuse compared to acute in ‘Amandine’, and the new variety ‘Amandine’ has a smaller number of stolons than ‘Charlotte’ (unpatented). Meanwhile, the position relative to the foliage of the inflorescence in ‘Charlotte’ (unpatented) is level with, while it is above in ‘Amandine’. the fruit color of ‘Charlotte’ (unpatented) is about Medium Red 46C to Medium Red 46B, whereas in ‘Amandine’ it is a red fruit color Medium Red 45B to Dark Red 45A, while the color of flesh in fruits of ‘Charlotte’ (unpatented) is about Medium Red 40C to Medium Red 40D, whereas the color of flesh in fruits of ‘Amandine’ is about Medium Orange-Red 31B to Medium Orange-Red 32B. The Predominant shape of fruit in ‘Charlotte’ (unpatented) is conical, than the predominant shape of fruit in ‘Amandine’ is cordiform. The differences in the position of the inflorescence relative to foliage in ‘Amandine’ and ‘Charlotte’ (unpatented) are shown in FIG. 1 and FIG. 5 respectively. The differences in the shape of the base of the terminal leaflet of ‘Amandine’ and ‘Charlotte’ (unpatented) are shown in FIG. 4 and FIG. 5 respectively. The differences in the shape and color of the fruit of ‘Amandine’ and ‘Charlotte’ (unpatented) are shown in FIG. 7 and FIG. 9 respectively. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF PHOTOGRAPHS The accompanying photographs show typical specimens of the new variety, designated ‘Amandine’ in the illustrations, including fruit, foliage and flower, in color as nearly true as it is reasonably possible to make in color illustrations of this character. The plants depicted in the photographs were planted Apr. 12, 2011 in Gironde, France, about 0.70° W., 44.60° N., 165 feet elevation. Photographs were taken June-July, 2011 (about Jun. 25 and Jul. 10, 2011): minimum temperate about 10 to 12° Centigrade, maximum temperate about 24 to 26° Centigrade. FIG. 1 shows several plants of the new variety ‘Amandine’ which exhibit a plant medium dense and the position of the inflorescence relative to foliage is above. FIG. 2 shows several plants of the new variety ‘Amandine’ with several red colored and cordiform shape fruits. FIG. 3 shows the upperside of a complete leave of the new variety ‘Amandine.’. In it we can see that the leaf color of upper side of the new variety ‘Amandine’ is about Medium Green 138C to Medium Green 138B. FIG. 4 shows the upperside of terminal leaflet of the new variety ‘Amandine’. In its we can see that the leaf color of upper side of the new variety ‘Amandine’ is about Medium Green 138C to Medium Green 138B and the shape of the terminal leaflet is acute. FIG. 5 shows the leaves and the terminal leaflet of the strawberry variety ‘Charlotte’ (unpatented). In it we can see that the shape of the base of terminal leaflet is obtuse and the position, relative to the foliage is level with. FIG. 6 shows the flower of the new variety ‘Amandine’. FIG. 7 shows typical whole fruit of the new variety ‘Amandine’ illustrating the typical cordiform shape fruit and red fruit color about Dark Red 45B to Dark Red 45A. FIG. 8 shows typical sliced section, illustrating the typical flesh coloration about Medium Orange-Red 31B to Medium Orange-Red 32B, with a weakly expressed hollow center. FIG. 9 shows typical whole fruit of the strawberry variety ‘Charlotte’ (unpatented) illustrating the typical conical shape fruit and red fruit color about Medium Red 46C to Medium Red 46B. DESCRIPTION OF THE NEW VARIETY Throughout this specification, color names beginning with a small letter signify that the name of that color, as used in common speech is aptly descriptive. Color names beginning with a capital letter designate values based upon The R.H.S. Colour Chart published by The Royal Horticultural Society, London, England, 1995. The color descriptions and other phenotypical descriptions may deviate from the stated values and descriptions depending upon variation in environmental, seasonal, climatic and cultural conditions. The following detailed description of the new variety is based upon observations taken of plants and fruits grown “underglass”, i.e. under tunnel, in Gironde, France, 0.70° W., 44.6° N., 165 feet elevation on Apr. 12, 2011. After planting, plants are grown in tabletop under 5 meters tunnel covered with plastic. Water and fertilizer are applied through drip irrigation. The new variety is principally propagated by way of runners. Although propagation by runners is presently preferred, other known methods of propagating strawberry plants may be used. Strawberries root well after transplanting. The term “blistering” used herein refers to the texture or rugosity or surface ondulation inherent to leaves and is generally a constant characteristic. ‘Amandine’ is a long day variety that needs an induction to flowering by very low chilling, such as occurs at a high elevation nursery. Usually a short time is sufficient. ‘Amandine’ is self-fertile. It produces large quantity of pollen throughout the seasons and pollination is generally good as there are very few malformed fruit. Measurements and descriptions were taken at two different times during the year, i.e. August and October with a sample size of 50 plants per repetition. After planting, plants are grown in tabletop under 5 meters tunnel covered with plastic. Water and fertilizer are applied through drip irrigation. 10% of the flowering occurred on May 10, 2011, the first mature fruits occurred on Jun. 8, 2011 and full maturity (15-20 h/plant) occurred on Jun. 20, 2011.
