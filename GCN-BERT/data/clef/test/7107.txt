Technical field of the invention The present invention relates to a process for the leaching of nickel laterite ores in a mixture of sulphuric acid and urea solution. Background of the invention Leaching of nickel laterites, or in in general of metal laterite ores, with sulphuric acid is a widely applied process. Normally, these processes are either carried out in tanks at elevated temperatures of 85-90 °C for periods of up to 22 hours or in pressure autoclaves under high pressures above 40 atm and temperatures around 250 °C. In some cases, nickel containing materials are subjected to heap leaching for periods up to 18 months. The article 'Recovery of vanadium, potassium and iron from a spent catalyst using urea solution" by Mazurek K, Bialowicz K. Trypuć M.; Hydrometallurgy 103 (1-4), pp. 19-24, 2010' describes a method for leaching of metals (vanadium, iron and potassium) using a mixture of sulphuric acid and urea. Patent US 5,320,665 describes a process for recovery of, particularly, noble metals by leaching the ore with a solution of sulphuric acid and thiourea. Document WO 200508548 describes a process wherein all types of metal including precious metals can be leached or dissolved from different metal containing materials such as soil and crushed rock by exposing the material to a combination of three different chemicals of a metal leachant which preferably comprises urea, a pH adjuster, preferably hydrolic acid, sulphuric acid or sodium sulphate, to lower the pH to a value below 3,5, and an oxidizer, preferably ferric chloride, at low temperatures. Numerous patents and processes are available to explain leaching of metals with sulphuric acid. However, in most of these processes, leaching time is normally rather long for high metal recoveries leading to higher capital and operating expenses. Summary of the invention The object of the invention is to provide a method for efficient recovery of nickel and cobalt from nickel laterite ores where leaching in sulphuric acid/urea mixture is completed in about less than 1 hour. The object is acheived by means of a method comprisng the features of appended claim 1. Preferred further embodiments of the invention are defined in the sub-claims. During the work leading to the present invention it was found possible to leach or dissolve nickel and cobalt from different nickel containing materials such as ores, residues and concentrates within less than 2 hours by exposing the material to a mix solution of sulphuric acid and urea. After about half an hour to two hours of leaching, metal recoveries went up to 98 %. The amount of urea used can be as low as 0.5 % of the feed material. The urea in the solution is believed to attack iron in metal containing materials and thus releases other metals which become soluble in sulphuric acid in a short time. The leachate solution containing dissolved metals is further treated to recover iron, and the remaining solution, in which an acid concentration rises, can either be returned to the leaching or can be processed further to recover nickel and cobalt. The advantages with the method according to the invention is that the method can - in preferred embodiments thereof - be performed at atmospheric pressure and at temperatures varying from ambient to boiling levels. Furthermore, no gases are emitted and due to very short leaching time of preferably under 2 hours simple and inexpensive equipment can be used to perform the method. Thus, the present invention relates to a process for efficient leaching of nickel laterite ores. Additional features of the invention will be evident from the following description and the appended claims. Detailed description of the invention The present invention relates to a process for efficiently dissolving metals from nickel bearing materials, which are, for example, nickel containing wastes and residues, ores and concentrates from mining operations and from processing of ores. The purpose for dissolving the metals from the nickel containing materials is the extraction of metals and their compounds for marketing reasons. The term 'metal' used herein and in the appended claims encompass nickel, cobalt and any other metals that are normally soluble in sulphuric acid and which are associated with iron in a laterite bond. Not all of steps a) through c) as detailed below must be realized in a method according to the invention but may be combined freely in a particular embodiment thereof. a) When nickel laterite ores are subjected to a dilute sulphuric acid solution, metals are dissolved. Addition of urea to the sulphuric acid solution in sufficient amounts increases the dissolution rate and hence the leaching is completed within between half an hour to two hours. During the leaching, the temperature can be 80-95°C and the slurry can be continously agitated.b) Following the separation of residue by conventional methods, i.e. thickening and/or filtration, the residue, which contains mainly silica with or without gypsum, is discarded while the solution is treated further to recover iron.c) Nickel and cobalt in the leach solution can either be recovered by resins at this stage, after which the solution goes to iron recovery, or the leach solution can be treated directly for iron recovery with nickel and cobalt recovery to follow afterwards. Practically, the method can be performed in vessels made from stainless steels or mild steel or concrete tanks, which can be lined with acid resistant bricks. The leaching time is relatively short compared with other leaching techniques. Normally, the time required is from about half an hour to two hours in some cases. The invention will now be further explained in the following examples. These examples are only intended to illustrate the invention and should in no way be considered to limit the scope of the invention. Example The method and the solution according to the invention was used to leach metals from a nickel laterite ore. 100 g of a nickel laterite ore sample ground to 74 microns was subjected to sulphuric acid and urea leaching. The original sample was analyzed by Atomic Absorption AAS. The leaching was conducted in one step for 1 hour at atmospheric pressure at elevated temperature of 90 °C. The solid to liquid ratio was 3 and acid strength was about 200 g/l. After leaching, the residue analysis was performed. The ratio of residue to the original sample was 34,18%.
