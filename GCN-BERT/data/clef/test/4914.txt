The Government has certain rights in the invention. RELATED APPLICATIONS The present application is a U.S. National Phase Application of International Application No. PCT/US2008/073479 (filed Aug. 18, 2008), which claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/935,494 (filed Aug. 16, 2007), all of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The extremely radiation-resistant family Deinococcaceae is comprised of greater than twenty distinct species that can survive acute exposures to ionizing radiation (IR) (10 kGy), ultraviolet light (UV) (1 kJ/m2), and desiccation (years); and can grow under chronic IR (60 Gy/hour). In particular, Deinococcus radiodurans is an extremely ionizing radiation (IR) resistant bacterium that can survive exposures to gamma-radiation that exceed by a factor of one thousand the doses which are cytotoxic and lethal to mammalian cells For extremely resistant bacteria, such as e.g., D. radiodurans, survival following high-doses of IR has been attributed to protection of proteins from oxidation during irradiation, with the result that enzymic repair systems survive and function with far greater efficiency during recovery than in sensitive bacteria, where cellular proteins are highly susceptible to carbonylation. In a report published in Science magazine (Daly et al. (2004), Accumulation of Mn(II) in Deinococcus radiodurans facilitates gamma-radiation resistance, Science 306: 925-1084), intracellular manganese(II) was implicated in facilitating radiation resistance by protecting proteins, but not DNA, during exposure to ionizing radiation; and in a second report published in PLoS Biology (Daly et al. (2007) Protein oxidation implicated as the primary determinant of bacterial radioresistance, PLoS Biology 5(4) e92), radiation resistance was positively correlated to protein protection during irradiation, mediated by a non-enzymic mechanism. Unlike D. radiodurans, most proteins are not radiation-resistant. Similarly, most cells, whether in eukaryotes, prokaryotes or mammals (e.g. humans) are also not radiation resistant. As such, exposure to radiation is quite damaging to protein structure and/or function. For example, ionizing radiation has been shown to induce (cause) cancer in many different species of animals and in almost all parts of the human body. In humans, significant overexposure to radiation can result in radiation poisoning, also called “radiation sickness” or a “creeping dose”. The term is generally used to refer to acute problems caused by a large dosage of radiation in a short period, though this also has occurred with long term exposure to low level radiation. The clinical name for “radiation sickness” is acute radiation syndrome as described by the CDC. A chronic radiation syndrome does exist but is very uncommon; this has been observed among workers in early radium source production sites and in the early days of the Soviet nuclear program. A short exposure can result in acute radiation syndrome; chronic radiation syndrome requires a prolonged high level of exposure. Humans routinely encounter radiation in daily life, including radiation from electronic equipment and cell phones as well as natural background radiation. Individuals that are in close proximity of radioactive elements such as e.g. employees at a nuclear plant or members of the armed forces are particularly likely to encounter higher doses of radiation. Additionally, radiation is used in diagnostic tests such as X-rays and radiation therapy to treat cancers. There are currently very few radioprotectors suitable for treating humans, and those which exist (e.g., amifostine) are cytotoxic and have serious side effects (e.g., loss of consciousness, fast or irregular breathing, itching, nausea and vomiting). Given the great exposure to radiation, there is a significant need for radioprotectors that are non-toxic, preserve protein function, and in particular are suitable for human use. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION This invention provides for methods of radioprotection using compositions containing one or more purine nucleosides and one or more antioxidant. These methods are suitable to protect proteins in vitro and in vivo from the damaging effects of radiation. One embodiment of the invention is a method of treating and/or preventing a side effect of radiation exposure in a subject in need thereof comprising administration of a pharmaceutically effective amount of a composition comprising one or more purine or pyrimidine nucleosides and one or more antioxidants to a subject in need thereof.

The method preserves the function of a protein (such as e.g., an enzyme) during desiccation or when the protein is exposed to radiation (such as e.g., UV light, alpha radiation, beta radiation, gamma radiation, X-ray radiation and neutron radiation). Another embodiment of the invention is a method for storing a protein comprising contacting a protein with a composition comprising one or more purine nucleosides and one or more antioxidants. Yet another embodiment of the invention is a method of treating and/or preventing a side effect of radiation exposure in a subject in need thereof comprising administration of a pharmaceutically effective amount of a D. radiodurans extract comprising one or more purine nucleosides and one or more antioxidants to a subject in need thereof. The method is suitable for treating radiation exposure from a variety of sources. In one embodiment, the radiation is UV light, alpha radiation, beta radiation, gamma radiation, X-ray radiation and neutron radiation. The one or more purine or pyrimidine nucleoside may be adenosine, uridine, β-pseudouridine, inosine, and mixtures thereof.

The extract may also contain about 1 mM to about 12.5 mM of manganese. The D. radiodurans extract may be produced by harvesting a D. radiodurans culture by centrifugation, lying the D. radiodurans culture to create a D. radiodurans lysate, washing the D. radiodurans lysate, centrifuging the D. radiodurans lysate for a time and under conditions sufficient to create a supernatant, passing the supernatant through a less than 3 kiloDalton filter; and boiling the supernatant for about 15 to about 45 minutes. The extract is soluble in butane, resistant to boiling and cell-free. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS The foregoing summary, as well as the following detailed description of the invention, will be better understood when read in conjunction with the appended figures. For the purpose of illustrating the invention, shown in the figures are embodiments of the present invention.

FIG. 1 shows that compounds in D. radiodurans ultrafiltrates protect proteins but compounds ultrafiltrates from in Pseudonomas putida (PP), Escherichia coli (EC), and Thermus thermophilus (TT) do not. Protein-free, ultra-filtrated D. radiodurans (DR) cell extract prevents ionizing radiation (IR)-induced protein oxidation in vitro, but extracts from the radiation sensitive bacteria Pseudomonas putida (PP), Escherichia coli (EC), and Thermus thermophilus (TT) did not. Purified E. coli proteins were incubated in PP-, EC-, or DR-ultra-filtrated extract during irradiation, and subjected to a protein carbonyl assay.

FIG. 2 shows that Adenosine and Uridine Prevent Gamma-Radiation-Induced Protein Breaks and Carbonylation (Oxidation). Adenosine and uridine prevent ionizing radiation (IR)-induced protein oxidation in vitro. Purified E. coli proteins were incubated with the indicated agents. Coomassie-stained polyacrylamide denaturing gel; Carbonyl Western blot, revealing protein oxidation (black) and protection (no signal). For example, when E. coli proteins were irradiated in potassium phosphate buffer (PPB/25 mM)+15 mM adenosine (Ad), the proteins were highly protected from oxidation during irradiation compared to potassium phosphate buffer alone.

For example, when BamH1 is irradiated in 25 mM potassium phosphate buffer (PPB)+3 mM adenosine (Ad)+1 mM MnCl2, the enzyme remains functional after exposure to 17,500 Gy, but not when incubated in potassium phosphate buffer alone, adenosine alone or MnCl2 alone. FIG. 4 shows radioprotection by D. radiodurans protein-free cell extracts of human T-cells compared to well-established radioprotective compounds.

FIG. 5 shows in vivo desiccation-induced oxidative protein damage. The proteins were isolated from the indicated strains after 6 days of desiccation. 20-mg samples were subjected to polyacrylamie denature gel electrophoreses and stained with Coomassie Blue (FIG. 5A).

DETAILED DESCRIPTION General Description The inventors have studied the radio-resistance of D. radiodurans and prepared ultra-purified, protein free-cell extracts that exhibit radioprotective properties. Thus, the invention is based in part on the discovery of radioprotective components of D. radiodurans cell free extract and artificial compositions containing such components. In particular, applicants have shown that D. radiodurans ultra-purified and protein-free cell extracts are extremely radioprotective of proteins exposed to gamma-radiation. Adenosine and uridine are accumulated in D. radiodurans, but these nucleosides were undetectable in radiation sensitive bacteria. In vitro, at doses >10,000 Gy, nucleosides were shown to be highly protective of proteins, preventing ionizing radiation (IR)-induced protein carbonylation and preserve the function enzymes in the presence of Mn(II). A radioprotective composition of adenosine, manganese and phosphate was been developed. Surprisingly, D. radiodurans extracts have been shown to be potent radioprotectors for cultured human T-cells with greater potency than other well-established radioprotective compounds. The present invention provides for radioprotective compositions either synthetic or derived from D. radiodurans and methods of uses of these compositions to protect proteins and/or cells from radiation damage. These compositions are useful to prevent radiation damages in compositions as well as in subjects such as humans. In particular, this invention provides for radioprotective compositions that contain one or more purine nucleoside and one or more antioxidant. The radioprotective compositions may further contain leucine, alanine, and/or valine. Leucine is strongly implicated in scavenging hydrogen peroxide in the presence of Mn(II), and may be components of larger intracellular complexes that include uridine and adenosine. Strong in vitro evidence indicates a synergistic effect between adenosine and manganese. The stoichiometry of adenosine and manganese may be optimized for an apoptosis assay. Applicants have shown that adenosine alone and Mn(II) alone are radioprotective in vivo for a mammalian cell line. Although not being bound by any particular theory, it is believed that compositions comprising purine nucleosides (e.g. adenosine) and an antioxidant (e.g. manganese) act as radioprotectants by shielding a proteins' active site. The purine nucleoside e.g. adenosine (and optionally with the pyrimidine uridine) mediates its radioprotective effects upon accumulation within a cell, which inhibits radiation-induced protein oxidation, and in the presence of Mn(II) preserves enzyme function. Adenosine is thought to protect proteins, and therefore scavenge a subset of ROS. Furthermore, without being bound by any particular theory, it is believed that under aerobic or anaerobic irradiation conditions, superoxide can build up in cells during irradiation because superoxide does not readily cross membranes. Although superoxide does not react with DNA, superoxide will damage and inactivate enzymes with exposed 2Fe-2S or 4Fe-4S clusters, releasing Fe(II). The problem with iron in a cell, when it is unbound and “free”, is that it causes Fenton reactions in the presence of hydrogen peroxide, generating hydroxyl radicals. Therefore, conditions which liberate bound Fe(II) are extremely dangerous, not only because of the generation of hydroxyl radicals, but because the loss of Fe from Fe-dependent enzymes leads to the failure of the biochemical pathways within which they operate. The methods of the instant application optimally protect against these dangerous conditions. Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. Although any methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice or testing of the present invention, the preferred methods, and materials are described. As used herein, “a” or “an” means at least one, unless clearly indicated otherwise. The term “about,” unless otherwise indicated, refers to a value that is no more than 10% above or below the value being modified by the term. For example, the term “about 5% (w/w)” means a range of from 4.5% (w/w) to 5.5% (w/w).

Compared to well-established radioprotectors (such e.g. amifostine), compositions comprising one or more purine and/or pyrimidine nucleosides and one or more antioxidants (e.g., adenosine, uridine and Mn) are relatively non-toxic. The methods of the invention are particularly suitable for pre- and post-exposure treatments of military personnel and civilians accidentally or deliberately exposed to ionizing radiation. The methods may also used prophylactically for individuals exposed to significant chronic levels of radiation such as in nuclear power plants, during long-duration space flight, or on the international space station. A “safe and effective amount” refers to a quantity of a component that is sufficient to yield a desired therapeutic response without undue adverse side effects (such as toxicity, irritation, or allergic response) commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio when used in the manner of this invention. By “therapeutically effective amount” is meant an amount of a component effective to yield a desired therapeutic response, e.g., an amount effective to slow the rate of bacterial cell division, or to cause cessation of bacterial cell division, or to cause death or decrease rate of population growth of the bacteria. The specific safe and effective amount or therapeutically effective amount will vary with such factors as the particular condition being treated, the physical condition of the subject, the type of subject being treated, the duration of the treatment, the nature of concurrent therapy (if any), and the specific formulations employed and the structure of the compounds or its derivatives. Means of application include, but are not limited to direct, indirect, carrier and special means or any combination of means. Direct application of the phage may be by nasal sprays, nasal drops, nasal ointments, nasal washes, nasal injections, nasal packings, bronchial sprays and inhalers, or indirectly through use of throat lozenges, or through use of mouthwashes or gargles, or through the use of ointments applied to the nasal nares, the bridge of the nose, or the face or any combination of these and similar methods of application. The forms in which the phage may be administered include but are not limited to lozenges, troches, candies, injectants, chewing gums, tablets, powders, sprays, liquids, ointments, and aerosols. The therapeutic agent may also be placed in a nasal spray, wherein the nasal spray is the carrier. The nasal spray can be a long acting or timed release spray, and can be manufactured by means well known in the art. An inhalant may also be used, so that the therapeutic agent may reach further down into the bronchial tract, including into the lungs. The therapeutic agent may be added to these substances in a liquid form or in a lyophilized state, whereupon it will be solubilized when it meets body fluids such as saliva. The enzyme may also be in a micelle or liposome. While these methods may be used in any mammalian species such as farm animals including, but not limited to, horses, sheep, pigs, chicken, and cows, the preferred use of compositions is for a human. The effective dosage rates or amounts of the compositions will depend in part on whether the composition will be used therapeutically or prophylactically, the duration of exposure of the recipient to radiation, the type of radiation, the size, and weight of the individual, etc. The duration for use of the composition also depends on whether the use is for prophylactic purposes, wherein the use may be hourly, daily or weekly, for a short time period, or whether the use will be for therapeutic purposes wherein a more intensive regimen of the use of the composition may be needed, such that usage may last for hours, days or weeks, and/or on a daily basis, or at timed intervals during the day. Any dosage form employed should provide for a minimum number of units for a minimum amount of time. The concentration of the active units of phage believed to provide for an effective amount or dosage of phage may be in the range of about 100 units/ml to about 100,000 units/ml of fluid in the wet or damp environment of the nasal and oral passages, and possibly in the range of about 100 units/ml to about 10,000 units/ml. More specifically, time exposure to the radiation may influence the desired concentration of active radioprotective composition units per ml. It should be noted that carriers that are classified as “long” or “slow” release carriers (such as, for example, certain nasal sprays or lozenges) could possess or provide a lower concentration of the composition per ml, but over a longer period of time, whereas a “short” or “fast” release carrier (such as, for example, a gargle) could possess or provide a high concentration of composition per ml, but over a shorter period of time. It will furthermore be appreciated that a therapeutically effective amount of a particular composition can be determined by those of ordinary skill in the art with due consideration of the factors pertinent to the subject. Selection of the preferred effective dose can be determined (e.g., via clinical trials) by a skilled artisan based upon the consideration of several factors which will be known to one of ordinary skill in the art. Such factors include the disease to be treated or prevented, the symptoms involved, the patient's body mass, the patient's immune status and other factors known by the skilled artisan to reflect the accuracy of administered pharmaceutical compositions. The precise dose to be employed in the formulation will also depend on the route of administration and should be decided according to the judgment of the practitioner and each patient's circumstances. Effective doses may be extrapolated from dose-response curves derived from in vitro or animal model test systems. For the prophylactic and therapeutic treatment and/or prevention of the effects of radiation exposure, the compositions comprising purine nucleosides and antioxidants may also be applied by direct, indirect, carriers and special means or any combination of means. Direct application of the phage may be by nasal sprays, nasal drops, nasal ointments, nasal washes, nasal injections, nasal packings, bronchial sprays and inhalers, or indirectly through use of throat lozenges, or through use of mouthwashes or gargles, or through the use of ointments applied to the nasal nares, the bridge of the nose, or the face or any combination of these and similar methods of application. The forms in which the phage may be administered include but are not limited to lozenges, troches, candies, injectants, chewing gums, tablets, powders, sprays, liquids, ointments, and aerosols. For the therapeutic treatment of anthrax, the bronchial sprays and aerosols are most beneficial, as these carriers, or means of distributing the composition, allow the phage to reach the bronchial tubes and the lungs. The compositions of the present invention can be administered via parenteral, subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, transdermal, or buccal routes. For example, an agent may be administered locally to a site of injury via microinfusion. Alternatively, or concurrently, administration may be by the oral route. The dosage administered will be dependent upon the age, health, and weight of the recipient, kind of concurrent treatment, if any, frequency of treatment, and the nature of the effect desired. In one embodiment of the invention, the method comprises administration of the therapeutic agent in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Suitable carriers and their formulations are described in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 2005, Mack Publishing Co. Typically, an appropriate amount of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt is used in the formulation to render the formulation isotonic. Examples of the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier include liquids such as saline, Ringer's solution, and dextrose solution. The pH of the solution is preferably from about 5 to about 8, and more preferably from about 7 to about 7.5. The formulation may also comprise a lyophilized powder. Further carriers include sustained release preparations such as semi-permeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers, which matrices are in the form of shaped articles, e.g., films, liposomes or microparticles. It will be apparent to those persons skilled in the art that certain carriers may be more preferable depending upon, for instance, the route of administration and concentration of proinflammatory cytokine inhibitor being administered. The methods optimally provide therapeutics against numerous redox-related forms of cell injury mediated by protein damage, and facilitate wound healing. Methods of Preparing D. radiodurans Extracts One embodiment of the invention is a method of preparing D. radiodurans cell-free extracts that exhibit radio-protective properties. In one embodiment, the methods has the steps of harvesting a D. radiodurans by e.g., centrifugation, lysing the D. radiodurans culture to create a lysate, washing the D. radiodurans lysate followed by centrifuging the lysate for a time and under conditions sufficient to create a supernatant. After centrifugation, the supernatant is passed through a microfilter, preferably a 3 kiloDalton Microfilter, and boiled for a period for a suitable amount of time. In one embodiment, the supernatant is boiled for about 15 to about 45 minutes after filtration. The resulting D. radiodurans extract contains one or more purine nucleosides and one or more antioxidants, is soluble in butanol, resistant to boiling, and cell-free. In one embodiment, the extract contains adenosine and manganese. In another embodiment, the extract contains adenosine and/or uridine manganese. The cell extracts may also further contain leucine, alanine, and/or valine. In one embodiment, the D. radiodurans extract contains at least adenosine, uridine, leucine, adenine, and manganese. Without further description, it is believed that one of ordinary skill in the art can, using the preceding description and the following illustrative examples, make and utilize the present invention and practice the claimed methods. The following working examples therefore, specifically point out the preferred embodiments of the present invention, and are not to be construed as limiting in any way the remainder of the disclosure. EXAMPLES Example 1 Preparation of Protein-Free Extract from D. radiodurans. D. radiodurans (ATTC BAA-816) was grown to OD600 0.9 in TGY, harvested by centrifugation, and lysed by French pressure treatment. The cells were washed and then lysed in double-distilled, de-ionized sterile water (dH2O). Prior to lysis, cell density was adjusted with dH2O to yield lysates representing approximately 50% intracellular concentration. Crude cell extracts were centrifuged for 20 hours at 175,000×g. The supernatant was passed through a <3 kiloDalton Microcon centrifugal filter (Millipore, USA) and boiled for 30 min. The Coomassie (Bradford) protein assay was used to confirm the virtual absence of proteins in the ultra-purified extracts, which were aliquoted and stored at −80° C. Example 2 Analysis of Protein-Free Extract from D. radiodurans. The D. radiodurans extracts were analyzed using TOF MS and chromatography. Using these techniques, the extracts were found to contain a variety of compounds including but not limited to leucine, adenine, uridine, and adenosine. Previous analysis showed that these extracts also contain manganese. The amino acids leucine, alanine, and valine are very elevated in D. radiodurans and D. geothermalis compared to radiation sensitive bacteria (data not shown). Example 3 Radioprotective Effects in Mammalian Cells. Apoptosis of Human Fetal Osteoblastic 1.19 cell line from ATCC (hFOB) was determined by death and apoptotic markers (Annexin V and propidium iodide PI) using a flow cytometry assay. In brief, hFOB cells were cultured in DMEM-F12 with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2.5 mM L-glutamine and 1% antibiotic to full confluency followed by treatment for experimental groups with adenosine (10 mM) or MnCl2 (0.25 mM) or adenosine and MnCl2 for 6 days period starting 3 h before IR. Apoptotic cell death was measured by flow cytometry with Annexin V and PI staining 6 days after IR. hFOB cells also were plated (1×103/well, 6-well plate) for clonogenic survival assay after IR. Colonies were counted 10 days later. The results of the assay are shown below in Table 1. For the assays, adenosine+/−0.25 mM Mn(II) was added 3 hours prior to irradiation. Cells were assayed 6 days after irradiation by flow cytometry. Annexin-V conjugates allow for the identification of cell surface changes that occur early during the apoptotic process using flow cytometry. Early in the apoptotic process, phosphatidylserine becomes exposed on the cell surface. Propidium Iodide (PI) in un-fixed cells discriminates between apoptosis and necrosis on the basis of dye exclusion. While necrotic cells lose membrane integrity early on in their death throws, apoptotic cells may have compromised membranes.
