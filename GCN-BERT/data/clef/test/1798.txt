FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a polyester resin composition. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Various polyester resins and blends thereof can be useful as engineering resins. Different polyester resins have useful properties and various performance characteristics, and there is an on-going demand for polyester. The mechanical properties and heat resistance of polyester resin can be improved by adding inorganic reinforcing material such as glass fiber. Glass fiber reinforced polyester resin has been used in structural materials and interior and exterior parts of an automobile. Recently, polyester resin has received interest as a material for use in LEDs (light emitting diodes) and EL (electro luminescence) devices, because polyester has excellent energy efficiency and energy lifespan. For example, modified polyester resin reinforced by glass fiber and including benzene rings in the main chains of the polyester has been used in LED components requiring excellent energy efficiency and energy lifespan, such as reflectors, reflector cups, scramblers and LED housings. Polyester resin used in LEDs should exhibit high heat resistance during the manufacture of a light emitting diode, excellent reflectance with an initial high whiteness index, minimal deterioration of whiteness resulting from yellowing, and the ability to block the flow of electricity. LEDs generally include a semiconductor emitting a light, a lead wire, a reflector as a housing, and a transparent sealing product sealing a semiconductor. Among these, the reflector can be made by various materials such as ceramic or heat resistant plastics. Productivity, however, of ceramics can be problematic, and heat resistant plastic can have decreased optical reflectance resulting from a change in color during the injection molding process. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides a polyester resin composition that can have good reflectance, impact strength, heat resistance, humidity resistance and yellowing resistance. The polyester resin composition includes (A) about 100 parts by weight of polyester resin, (B) about 0.1 to about 80 parts by weight of white pigment, and (C) about 0.01 to about 80 parts by weight of filler. In exemplary embodiments of the invention, the (B) white pigment is titanium dioxide. In exemplary embodiments of the invention, the (C) filler is glass fiber. In exemplary embodiments of the invention, the polyester resin composition can have an initial reflectance value of more than about 90 at a wavelength of 440 nm measured using a Minolta 3600D spectrophotometer according to CIE Lab. color difference evaluation criteria as a color-difference meter, and can have a decline of reflectance value of less than about 10 which is measured again after maintaining the polyester resin composition under conditions of 85° C. and 85% relative humidity (RH) for 144 hours. In another embodiment of the invention, the polyester resin can have a change of initial yellow index (ΔYI) of less than about 5 measured by a Minolta 3600D spectrophotometer according to CIE Lab. color difference evaluation criteria as a color-difference meter after maintaining the polyester resin composition under conditions of 85° C. and 85% relative humidity for 144 hours.

The polyester resin composition can include the white pigment (B) in an amount of about 0.1 to about 80 parts by weight, for example, about 5 to about 30 parts by weight, based on about 100 parts by weight of (A).

Further, according to some embodiments of the present invention, the amount of the filler (C) can be in a range from about any of the foregoing amounts to about any other of the foregoing amounts. In the present invention, any conventional organic or inorganic filler can be used. Examples of the filler can include without limitation carbon fibers, glass fibers, boron fibers, glass bids, glass flake, carbon black, diatomaceous earth, clay, kaolin, talc, mica, calcium carbonate, filler in needle form, and the like, and combinations thereof. Examples of the filler in needle form include without limitation wollastonite, potassium titanate whiskers, aluminum boric acid whiskers, zinc oxide whiskers, calcium whiskers and the like and combinations thereof. In exemplary embodiments, filler in needle form can be used to provide an article having excellent surface smoothness. Glass fiber, wollastonite, potassium titanate whiskers, aluminum boric acid whiskers, and the like, and combinations thereof can be used to also provide high whiteness. In exemplary embodiments the filler includes glass fiber. When the filler is glass fiber, formability of the resin can be improved and mechanical properties such as tension strength, flexural modulus, bending stiffness and the like and heat resistance such as heat distortion temperature of the molded object formed by the resin composition can be improved. The average length of the fiber can be about 0.1 to about 20 mm, for example about 0.3 to about 10 mm The aspect ratio (average length of the fiber/average external diameter of the fiber) can be about 10 to about 2000, for example about 30 to about 1000. When the filler has an aspect ratio in the above range, impact strength can be improved. The cross-sectional shape of the glass fiber may be any of various forms, including but not limited to a circular cross-section. Also according to the present invention, the glass fiber may have any of various forms. (D) Additive(s) The polyester resin composition which can have excellent heat resistance and humidity resistance of the present invention may further include one or more additives. Examples of the additives can include without limitation fluorescence brightening agents, lubricants, release agents, nucleating agents, antistatic agents, UV stabilizers, stabilizers, reinforcement materials, inorganic additives, colorants such as dyes and pigments, and the like, and combinations thereof, depending on the intended use of the composition. UV stabilizers can suppress color change and decline of light reflectance of the polyester resin composition when exposed to UV irradiation. Examples of the UV stabilizers include without limitation benzotriazole, benzophenone, triazine and the like and combinations thereof. Fluorescence brightening agents can enhance light reflectance of the polyester resin composition. Examples of the fluorescence brightening agents include without limitation stilbene-bis benzoxazole derivatives such as 4-(benzoxazole-2-yl)-4′-(5-methyl benzoxazole -2-yl)stilbene or 4,4′-bis(benzoxazole -2-yl)stilbene and the like and combinations thereof. Release agents can include without limitation polymers containing fluorine, silicon oils, metal salts of stearic acid, metal salts of montanic acid, ester waxes of montanic acid, polyethylene waxes, and the like, and combinations thereof, Examples of the nucleating agents can include without limitation talc, clay, and the like, and combinations thereof. The polyester resin composition of the present invention can have an initial reflectance of more than about 90 at a wavelength of 440 nm. Further, after maintaining the polyester resin composition under conditions of 85° C. and 85% relative humidity for 144 hours, the polyester resin composition can exhibit a decline in reflectance of less than about 10 at a wavelength of 440 nm and a change of yellowing (ΔYI) of less than about 5. After an extruded pellet formed of the polyester resin composition is maintained under conditions of 85° C. and 85% relative humidity for 48 hours, water uptake measured using a Mettler HR-83 moisture analyzer can be less than about 2% for 20 minutes. Accordingly, the polyester resin composition of the present invention can be used in articles requiring excellent heat resistance and humidity resistance. The polyester resin composition of the present invention not only can have excellent reflectance and impact strength by including proper amounts of white pigment, but also can have improved heat resistance and humidity resistance. Accordingly, the composition can exhibit only a slight decline in reflectance and change of yellowing after exposure to a constant temperature and constant humidity. Therefore, the polyester resin composition can be used as a LED reflector material which can be continuously exposed to a high temperature environment. The polyester resin composition of the present invention can be adapted not only for LED applications but also for other applications reflecting light beams. For example, the polyester resin composition can be used in a reflector plate for a light emitting device such as various electric/electronic products, indoor lighting, indicators, outdoor lighting, automobile lighting, displays, and headlights, among others. Polyamide resin commonly used as a LED reflector can have poor processibility because of its poor humidity resistance. In contrast, however, the polyester resin composition of the present invention does not require a post process treatment step such as vacuum packing and the like because it can have good processibility, formability and humidity resistance and can provide improved economic efficiencies as compared to polyamide resin. The invention may be better understood by reference to the following examples which are intended for the purpose of illustration and are not to be construed as in any way limiting the scope of the present invention, which is defined in the claims appended hereto.
