CROSS REFERENCES This application is a Continuation-In-Part Patent Application claiming the benefit of priority under 35 U.S.C. 120 from U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/078,757 filed Apr. 1, 2011, the entire contents of which are herein incorporated by reference. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates generally to a method of treating gum diseases using a soft tissue diode laser which produces a beam of light having a wavelength in the visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum (400 nm-700 nm). Optionally, the laser light utilizes green wavelength range (520-570 nm) at a laser power of 0.5 to 1.2 watts to treat gum disease. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Laser Assisted Periodontium And Osseus Regeneration (LAPOR) is a protocol which is laser assisted with the use of a substrate such as but not limited the LAPOR periodontal solution, the LAPOR periodontal gel and the LAPOR substrate and thus causes an increase in cell attachment of epithelial cells, gingival fibroblasts, PDL fibroblasts and adhesion of osteogenic cells. This protocol has shown to increase the expression of transcription factors related to the differentiation of osteoblasts/cementoblasts as well as chondroblasts. Enhanced cell migration and proliferation appears to lead to accelerated wound fill rates in vitro using PDL fibroblasts, gingival fibroblasts and osteoblast-like cells. A substrate such as the LAPOR periodontal solution, the LAPOR periodontal gel and the LAPOR substrate, used in the LAPOR protocol, stimulates total protein synthesis and the synthesis of specific extracellular matrix molecules. Studies that evaluate the bone remodeling regulation system indicate that enamel matrix proteins influence this by modulating the OPG and RANKI expression, thus indicating an indirect involvement in the bone remodeling process. The soft tissue diode laser used produces a beam of light having a wavelength in the visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum (400 nm-700 nm). Optionally, a beam of light having a wavelength in the green wavelength range (520-570 nm) at a laser power of 0.5 to 1.2 watts is used in the LAPOR protocol. It has been shown by the LAPOR protocol to biostimulate the healing and regenerative processes of the periodontium, including the biostimulation of new bone and its supporting elements. Previous studies have shown a positive healing effect of low power laser therapy (infrared range of a soft tissue diode laser) on tissue repair. Low power lasers, in the infrared range, have been shown to positively affect several indices of tissue repair. They biostimulate wound healing by acceleration of collagen synthesis, acceleration of inflammation, decrease of healing time, acquisition of strength. They biostimulate regeneration of tissue via elevated metabolic indices of ATP synthesis, elevated fibroblast proliferation, elevated collagen synthesis and increased indices of biomechanical aspects of tissue healing. The soft tissue diode laser used in the LAPOR protocol, biostimulates the healing response of the periodontium nonsurgically, and biostimulates the tissue regeneration of the periodontium, nonsurgically, and prevents long junctional epithelium from migrating downwards into the sulcus (a biomechanical aspect of tissue healing), thereby preserving the tissue height. A soft tissue diode laser used in the LAPOR protocol helps a substrate such as but not limited to enamel matrix proteins to stimulate total protein synthesis and the synthesis of extracellular matrix molecules, nonsurgically. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, there is disclosed a method of treating gum disease using a soft tissue diode laser which generates a beam of light having a wavelength in the visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum (400 nm-700 nm). Optionally, a beam of light having a wavelength in the green range (520-570 nm) at a laser power of 0.5 to 1.2 watts is used to decontaminate the gum tissue and to biostimulate healing and regenerate the periodontium (including cementum of the root surface), thus preventing long junctional epithelium from migrating downwards into the sulcus and thereby preserving the tissue height. The soft tissue diode laser also biostimulates the healing and regenerative response induced by a substrate, i.e. the LAPOR periodontal solution, the LAPOR periodontal gel and the LAPOR periodontal substrate, the method comprising: 1) placing the laser inside the sulcus; 2) penetrating the entire sulcus by moving the laser light intermittently vertically and horizontally throughout the sulcus; and 3) placing the substrate in the sulcus prior to a blood clot forming (which then increases cell attachment, adhesion, migration and proliferation). In another embodiment of the present invention, there is disclosed a root/bone/cartilage conditioner comprised of EDTA 15%, calcium gluconate 20%, methylparaben, propylparaben, Ethanolamine as a buffering agent, carboxymethylcellulose, and green food coloring and sterile water. In still another embodiment of the present invention, there is disclosed a first substrate comprised of: a combination of mono or disodium phosphate and sodium hydroxide in solution with a sodium content of 11 mg/100 g; 60% water; 9% Lysine; 9% Proline; 9% all other essential amino acids wherein the amino acids are chosen from the group consisting of Isoleucine, Leucine, Methionine, Phenylalanine, Threonine, Tryptophan, Valine, Histadine, Asparagine and Selenocysteine; 2% of all other non-essential amino acids wherein the amino acids are chosen from the group consisting of Alanine, Arginine, Aspartate, Cysteine, Glutamate, Glutamine, Glycine, Serine, Tyrosine and Pyrrolsine; 6.9% free bases wherein the free bases are chosen from the group consisting of adenosine, uridine, guanosine, iridin and cytidine; 2% phosphates wherein the phosphates are chosen from the group consisting of ADP, ATP and acetycholine; and 1% benzoic acid at a pH of 7.45.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Definitions As used herein, the term “gum disease” means periodontal disease which can lead to tooth loss and/or other health problems. Examples of periodontal disease include gingivitis, aggressive periodontitis, chronic periodontitis, periodontitis as a manifestation of systemic diseases, and necrotizing periodontal disease. As used herein, the term “patient” means any individual suffering from a disease of the gums and in need of treatment for said gum disease. As used herein, the term “locus” means an exact point of measurement within the sulcus or the immediate surrounding area. As used herein, the term “substrate mixture” means the mixture of the first substrate and the second substrate disclosed herein for treatment of gum disease. As used herein, the term “bone regeneration” means increasing the density of calcium at specific loci in or around the sulcus. As used herein, the term “calcium density” means the measurement of calcium mass around a given loci. The LAPOR protocol can be used in the treatment of gum disease by combining the most effective methods of treatment with the use of a special laser. Approximately 66% of the United States population has some form of gum disease. But many avoid seeking treatment because of the discomfort that often results from gum surgery. LAPOR provides a new choice. The LAPOR protocol is a treatment that is more effective as traditional periodontal surgery, and it is much more beneficial to the patient both in the short term and in the long run. The LAPOR protocol takes only about an hour and only two short follow-up visits. Patients enjoy no downtime with recovery taking only 24 hours. This makes immediate return to work both possible and comfortable. After having the LAPOR protocol performed, gum recession is minimal to none when compared to that which most often follows normal periodontal surgery. This, combined with new cementum formation on the roots, bone formation in previous defects, periodontal ligament formation tooth loss. The special type of laser used in the LAPOR protocol is the diode, a semiconductor coherent light beam used on soft tissues. The laser light used has a wavelength in the visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, between 400 nm-700 nm wavelength. Optionally, the green range (520-570 nm) of the visible spectrum is utilized at a laser power of 0.5 to 1.2 watts, which disinfects the site, leaving the gum tissue bacteria free, and biostimulates healing; in conjunction with treatment with a substrate, the laser biostimulates regeneration of the periodontium. Traditional periodontal therapy removes tissue height of a tooth to reduce the pocket depths. The LAPOR protocol is a regenerative procedure. The patient does not lose tissue volume. Tissue volume is increased and bone is regenerated. The green wavelength is ideally suited for soft tissue procedures since it is highly absorbed by hemoglobin and melanin. This gives the diode laser the ability to, in this case, target the soft tissues. The use of the diode laser in conjunction with routine scaling and root planning is more effective than scaling and root planning alone. It enhances the speed and extent of the patients gingival healing and postoperative comfort. This is accomplished through laser bacterial reduction and biostimulation with a laser light having a wavelength in the visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, between 400 nm-700 nm wavelength. Optionally, the green range (520-570 nm) of the visible spectrum is utilized at a laser power of 0.5 to 1.2 watts. Referring to FIG. 10, there is disclosed a method 10 of using a soft tissue diode laser which produces a beam of light, used intermittently, having a wavelength in the visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, between 400 nm-700 nm wavelength. Optionally, the green range (520-570 nm) of the visible spectrum is utilized at a laser power of 0.5 to 1.2 watts to treat gum disease. Starting at block 12, a perio probe determines the degree of excessive pocket depth and thus helps the dentist better identify diseased tissue and areas of bacterial infection. The dentist removes tartar from the root surface using an ultrasonic scaler and hand instruments, block 14. This action by the dentist helps stimulate a healing response in the sulcus by opening up the capillaries upon scaling. Going to block 18, the laser tip is placed inside the sulcus and a continuous light beam with intermittent stops for tissue temperature control is allowed to penetrate the entire sulcus by moving the tip vertically and horizontally throughout the sulcus. The laser tip is cut at a 45 degree angle during the first pass. The laser is cut at the opposite 45 degree angle during the second pass. This allows for the laser beam to penetrate the existing periodontium to decontaminate the tissue, as the heat of the targeted laser light kills the bacteria. This also allows for biostimulation of the sulcular contents. At block 20, the dentist scales the sulcular area and root surfaces once again to induce a healing response through renewed blood flow. Going to block 22, a substrate, such as but not limited to enamel matrix proteins, is then placed in the sulcus of the tooth prior to the blood clot forming and at block 24, a blood clot is carefully allowed to form by gently helping patient keep their mouth open for 5 minutes, to keep the substrate intact. The LAPOR protocol is much less invasive than traditional surgery and offers advantages and benefits over its counterpart. Recovery time is much faster because most, if not all, damage to healthy tissue is avoided through the use of more advanced technology. Because the LAPOR protocol leaves healthy tissue intact, the height of the gums themselves around the teeth is much better preserved. The LAPOR protocol prevents long junctional epithelium from migrating downwards into the sulcus, thus preserving the tissue height and allowing for the regeneration of the periodontium. Firstly, the root conditioner is applied to the sulcus. The root conditioner comprises the following at Table 1: TABLE 1 Component EDTA 20-25 g. Calcium gluconate 10-20 g. Methylparaben .1-.9 g. Propylparaben .01-.1 g. Ethanolamine 2-8 mls. Carboxymethylcellulose 2-10 g. Green food coloring 1-2 drops Sterile water 100 mls. The conditioner is optionally rinsed out prior to application of additional substrates or laser light. Alternatively, the conditioner is left in the sulcus, with the laser light being applied prior to application of any substrate. In an alternative embodiment, the conditioner is left in with only one substrate applied prior to application of the laser light. Optionally, the conditioner is left in the sulcus and substrate is added prior to any application of laser light. The placement of the substrate into the sulcus containing luminesced blood enables the luminesced blood to coagulate upon the substrate. The substrate contains building blocks for protein synthesis as well as substances used as energy for protein synthesis. The substrate also contains hard components that are able to be used by the body as a “lattice” for regeneration. The substrate also contains a slow release pH increasing agent to increase the pH for optimal regeneration while not “startling” the body such that it will have a negative reaction to the substrate. Optionally, the liquid substrate is comprised of the following, per 1 L of solution, at Table 2: TABLE 2 Essential Amino Acids % Isoleucine 1.125 Leucine 1.125 Methionine 1.125 Phenylalanine 1.125 Threonine 1.125 Tryptophan 1.125 Valine 1.125 Histidine 1.125 Lysine 9 Non-Essential Amino Acids % Alanine 0.25 Arginine 0.25 Aspartate 0.75 Glutamate 0.25 Glycine 0.25 Serine 0.25 Proline 9 Phosphates % ADP 0.667 ATP 0.667 Acetylcholine 0.667 Free Bases % Adenosine 1.725 Uridine 1.725 Guanosine 1.725 Cytidine 1.725 Benzoic Acid 1 Sodium Chloride 1.1 Sterile water 60 Total: 100 Optionally, the total sterile water component is adjusted 20% up or down, depending on the desired viscosity to be achieved. In an alternative embodiment, the liquid substrate is comprised of the following, at Table 3: TABLE 3 Essential Amino Acids Grams Isoleucine 11.25 Leucine 11.25 Methionine 11.25 Phenylalanine 11.25 Threonine 11.25 Tryptophan 11.25 Valine 11.25 Histidine 11.25 Lysine 90 Non-Essential Amino Acids Grams Alanine 2.5 Arginine 2.5 Aspartate 7.5 Glutamate 2.5 Glycine 2.5 Serine 2.5 Proline 90 Phosphates Grams ADP 7-8 ATP 7-8 Acetylcholine 6-7 Free Bases Grams Adenosine 13-14 Uridine 13-14 Guanosine 13-14 Cytidine 13-14 Iridine 13-14 Benzoic Acid 20 Sodium Chloride .1-.9 Sterile water .9-1.2 L Most preferred, the pH of the final solution for the liquid substrate should be 7.45 with a tendency to apply a basic pH. An additional substrate may be applied, the additional substrate comprised of the following: a mixture of tricalcium phosphate and hydroxyapatite crystals. The tricalcium phosphate is precipitated with CaOH/devil's claw oil, in a preferred embodiment. Optionally, the additional substrate include 50% tricalcium phosphate/devil's claw oil precipitated with 50% porous hydroxyapatite crystals. The tricalcium phosphate crystals used are granules in the following sizes: 10-50 μm, 50-150 μm, 100-300 μm, 500-1000 μm, 1-3 mm and 3-6 mm. The tricalcium phosphate crystals may be dense or porous. The additional substrate may be comprised of hydroxyapatite crystals of granules containing the following sizes: 10-50 μm, 50-150 μm, 100-300 μm, 500-1000 μm, 1-3 mm and 3-6 mm. The hydroxyapatite crystals may be dense or porous. In the following examples, the conditioner is applied and is rinsed out. Optionally, the conditioner is left in the sulcus, as the conditioner allowed the micropores within the tooth structures to remain open. After the conditioner is applied, the sulcus is biostimulated with a laser light. After this occurs, the liquid substrate is applied. Optionally, the additional substrate is applied. EXAMPLES I. Analysis of Tooth #15 at 12 Unique Loci A patient's pocket depths at tooth 15 were measured at 12 separate loci. The root of the tooth was then scaled and planed to remove calculus build up on the root surface. After scaling and planning, bleeding occurs in the sulcus. The sulcus was allowed to air dry and immediately thereafter the conditioner is applied to the sulcus and left for 30 seconds before being rinsed with saline. The tooth was next scaled and planed again to renew blood flow. With blood pooling in the sulcus, the 45° laser tip was placed into the sulcus. The laser light used has a wavelength in the visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, between 400 nm-700 nm wavelength. The laser was emitted continuously with only intermittent stops for tissue temperature control. The laser was allowed to penetrate the entire sulcus by moving the tip vertically and horizontally throughout the sulcus for 30 second. The laser tip was cut to 45° in the opposite angle for the second pass into the sulcus and 90° for the third pass to allow the laser bean to penetrate the existing periodontium to decontaminate and biostimulate the sulcular contents. In the meantime, the first substrate and the second substrate were mixed in a glass dish. Some of the patient's blood that has been treated with the laser light in the sulcus was also mixed in the glass dish. This mixture is then placed immediately into the sulcus upon mixture. Enough of the mixture was placed into the sulcus to fill the sulcus while ensuring the mixture stayed 3 mm below the top of the gingival margin and also remained immersed in blood. The patient's mouth was kept open for 5 minutes to ensure the newly formed blood clot containing the substrate mixture remained intact. Treatment was repeated on tooth 15 on four subsequent occasions, at which time the pocket depths at each loci were measured prior to treatment. Measurements are shown in FIG. 11. The data show an increase in calcium density at the specific loci. II. Analysis of Tooth #12 at 17 Unique Loci A patient's pocket depths at tooth 28 were measured at 17 separate loci. The treatment disclosed herein was performed on five subsequent occasions, at which time the pocket depths at each loci were measured prior to treatment. Measurements are shown in FIG. 12. The data show an increase in calcium density across all loci. III. Analysis of Tooth #2, #3 and #15 at 3 Unique Loci Per Tooth A patient's pocket depths at tooth 2, tooth 3 and tooth 15 were measured at three separate loci per tooth. The treatment disclosed herein was performed 3 months after the initial treatment, at which time the pocket depths at each loci were measured prior to treatment. Measurements are shown in FIG. 13. The data show a progression of bone generation.
