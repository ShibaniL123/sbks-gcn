Example 28
To a suspension of 6-(2-amino-5-methylthiazol-4-yl)-3,4-dihydroquinolin-2(1H)-one (0.100 g, 0.386 mmol) and 2,4-dimethylthiazole-5-carboxylic acid (0.067 g, 0.424 mmol), and pyridine (0.14 mL, 1.742 mmol) in acetonitrile (4 mL) in a sealed tube was added propylphosphonic anhydride solution (50 wt % in ethyl acetate, 0.80 mL, 1.352 mmol). The sealed tube was heated to 50Â° C. for 6 days. After cooling, the mixture was quenched with water (3 mL) and the precitate was collected by filtration washing with cold 1:1 acetonitrile/water mixture. The residue was purified by precipitating in dichloromethane and filtration to give 2,4-dimethyl-N-(5-methyl-4-(2-oxo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinolin-6-yl)thiazol-2-yl)thiazole-5-carboxamide (0.12 g, 78%) as an off-white solid.
