METHODS FOR TREATING SKIN INFECTION BY ADMINISTERING AN IL-4R ANTAGONIST FIELD OF THE INVENTION [001] The present invention relates to the treatment and/or prevention of skin infection associated with IL-4R- related conditions. More specifically, the invention relates to the administration of interleukin-4 receptor (IL-4R) antagonists to reduce skin infection in a patient in need thereof. BACKGROUND [002] Skin infections generally occur at the sites of skin damage produced by, for example, atopic dermatitis, burns, cracks in the skin, cuts, blisters, insect bites, surgical wounds, intravenous drug injection or sites of intravenous catheter insertion, or long-term usage of topical steroids. The skin infections may be localized or diffuse with severe inflammation of the epidermal, dermal and sub-cutaneous layers of the skin. They may be caused by various microbes including, but not limited to Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus spp., Herpes simplex virus, molluscum contagiosum virus, and fungi such as Microsporum spp. and Trichophyton spp. [003] Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic/relapsing inflammatory skin disease characterized by intense pruritus (e.g., severe itch) and by scaly and dry eczematous lesions. AD is often associated with other atopic disorders such as allergic rhinitis and asthma. Patients with atopic dermatitis are susceptible to serious skin infections caused by bacteria and viruses including, but not limited to S. aureus and herpes simplex virus. S. aureus causes severe localized and diffuse (e.g., impetigo) skin infections. S. aureus colonization and infections of lesions significantly impacts AD disease activity and severity. [004] Typical treatments include topical lotions and moisturizers, antibiotics, anti-viral and anti-fungal agents. Most treatment options, however, offer only temporary, incomplete, symptom relief. Moreover, in many patients with moderate-to-severe AD, prolonged use of topical corticosteroids or calcineurin inhibitors may lead to increased risk of skin microbial infections. Thus, a need exists in the art for novel targeted therapies for the treatment and/or prevention of skin infections. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [005] According to certain aspects of the present invention, methods are provided for treating, preventing or ameliorating a skin infection in a subject. Also included are methods of reducing the susceptibility to a skin infection or reducing the risk of inflammation due to microbial infection in a subject. In certain embodiments, the invention provides for methods to improve skin barrier function and to reduce microbial colonization of the skin in a subject. The methods of the present invention comprise administering to a subject in need thereof a pharmaceutical composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of an interleukin-4 receptor (IL-4R) antagonist. In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition is administered subcutaneously at a dose of 75 - 600mg. [006] In certain embodiments, the skin infection may be a bacterial infection or a viral infection. In certain embodiments, the skin infection may be caused by a microbe selected from the group consisting of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacteroides spp., Herpes simplex virus, molluscum contagiosum virus, coxsackievirus, vaccinia virus, Candida albicans, Microsporum spp., Trichophyton spp., Penicillium spp., Cladosporium spp., Alternaria spp. , and Aspergillus spp. In certain embodiments, the skin infection is selected from the group consisting of impetigo, cellulitis, infected dermatitis, eczema herpeticum, folliculitis, infected blister, mycosis, tinea versicolor, Staphylococcus aureus infection, and Streptococcus infection. [007] In certain embodiments, the skin infection is caused by S. aureus. In some embodiments, the S. aureus colonization of skin is reduced upon administration of a therapeutically effective amount of an IL-4R antagonist. [008] According to certain embodiments, the present invention provides methods for treating or preventing a skin infection or for reducing microbial colonization of the skin in a subject, wherein the methods comprise sequentially administering to the subject about 50 mg to about 600 mg of a pharmaceutical composition comprising an IL-4R antagonist as an initial dose followed by one or more secondary doses. In certain embodiments, the initial dose and the one or more secondary doses each comprise about 75 mg to about 300 mg of the IL-4R antagonist. In certain embodiments, the IL-4R antagonist is administered at an initial dose of 600mg followed by one or more secondary doses wherein each secondary dose comprises 300mg. According to this aspect of the invention, the pharmaceutical composition may be administered to the subject at a dosing frequency of, e.g., once a week, once in 2 weeks, once in 3 weeks or once in 4 weeks. In one embodiment, each secondary dose is administered 1 week after the immediately preceding dose. In one embodiment, the IL-4R antagonist is administered at an initial dose of 300mg followed by 3 - 15 secondary doses wherein each secondary dose comprises 300mg and is administered weekly. [009] In certain embodiments, the invention provides methods to treat or prevent skin infection in a subject wherein the skin infection is associated with an IL-4R-associated disease or disorder, for example, atopic dermatitis, asthma, or allergy. In one embodiment, the subject has moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. [010] In a related aspect, the invention provides methods for improving skin barrier function comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of a pharmaceutical composition comprising an IL-4R antagonist to a subject in need thereof. In certain embodiments, the skin barrier function is improved in a skin lesion in a patient with atopic dermatitis. In certain embodiments, the improvement in skin barrier function upon administration of the anti-IL-4R antibody is selected from the group consisting of: (i) at least 10% increase from the baseline in Stratum Corneum Hydration (SCH) score; (ii) at least 20% decrease from the baseline in Trans- Epidermal Water Loss (TEWL) score; and (iii) a decrease in skin surface pH to acidic pH. [011 ] Exemplary IL-4R antagonists that can be used in the context of the methods of the present invention include, e.g., small molecule chemical inhibitors of IL-4R or its ligands (IL-4 and/or IL-13), or biological agents that target IL-4R or its ligands. According to certain embodiments, the IL-4R antagonist is an antigen-binding protein (e.g., antibody or antigen- binding fragment thereof) that binds the IL-4Ra chain and blocks signaling by IL-4, IL-13, or both IL-4 and IL-13. In one embodiment, the antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof that specifically binds IL-4R comprises complementarity determining regions (CDRs) in a heavy chain variable region (HCVR)/ light chain variable region (LCVR) sequence pair of SEQ ID NOs: 1/2. In certain embodiments, the antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof comprises a heavy chain CDR (HCDR1 ) having amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 3, a HCDR2 having amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 4, a HCDR3 having amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 5, a light chain CDR (LCDR1 ) having amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 6, a LCDR2 having amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 7, and a LCDR3 having amino acid sequence of SEQ I D NO: 8. One such type of antigen-binding protein that can be used in the context of the methods of the present invention is an anti-IL-4Ra antibody such as dupilumab. [012] In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition is administered subcutaneously or intravenously to the patient. [013] In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition is administered to the patient before, after or concurrent with a second therapeutic agent. In some embodiments, the second therapeutic agent is selected from the group consisting of an anti-bacterial agent, an anti-viral agent, an anti-fungal agent, another IL-4R inhibitor, an IgE inhibitor, a corticosteroid (e.g., topical corticosteroid), a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), and I FNy. [014] In certain embodiments, the present invention provides use of an IL-4R antagonist of the invention in the manufacture of a medicament to treat or reduce or prevent a skin infection in a patient. [015] Other embodiments of the present invention will become apparent from a review of the ensuing detailed description.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION [052] Before the present invention is described, it is to be understood that this invention is not limited to particular methods and experimental conditions described, as such methods and conditions may vary. It is also to be understood that the terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only, and is not intended to be limiting, since the scope of the present invention will be limited only by the appended claims. [053] Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. As used herein, the term "about," when used in reference to a particular recited numerical value, means that the value may vary from the recited value by no more than 1 %. For example, as used herein, the expression "about 100" includes 99 and 101 and all values in between (e.g., 99.1 , 99.2, 99.3, 99.4, etc.). As used herein, the terms "treat", "treating", or the like, mean to alleviate symptoms, eliminate the causation of symptoms either on a temporary or permanent basis, or to prevent or slow the appearance of symptoms of the named disorder or condition. [054] Although any methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice of the present invention, the preferred methods and materials are now described. All publications mentioned herein are incorporated herein by reference to describe in their entirety. Methods for Treating, Preventing or Ameliorating Skin Infections [055] The present invention includes methods which comprise administering to a subject in need thereof a therapeutic composition comprising an IL-4R antagonist. As used herein, the expression "a subject in need thereof" means a human or a non-human animal that exhibits one or more symptoms of a skin infection, and/or who has been diagnosed with a skin infection. [056] In the context of the invention, the term "subject" includes a subject with a skin infection wherein the skin infection is selected from the group consisting of impetigo, cellulitis, infected dermatitis, eczema herpeticum, folliculitis, infected blister, mycosis, tinea versicolor, Staphylococcus aureus infection, and Streptococcus infection. [057] In certain embodiments, the methods of the invention may be used to reduce inflammation, and/or pruritus due to a skin microbial infection. [058] In certain embodiments, the term "subject" includes subjects with an IL-4R-related disease or disorder, e.g., atopic dermatitis, asthma or allergy. [059] The present invention provides methods to reduce microbial colonization of the skin comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of an IL-4R antagonist. As used herein, the term "subject" includes a subject infected with a microbe including, but not limited to Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacteroides spp., Herpes simplex virus, coxsackievirus, molluscum contagiosum virus, vaccinia virus, Candida albicans, Microsporum spp., Trichophyton spp., Penicillium spp., Cladosporium spp., Alternaria spp., and Aspergillus spp. In certain embodiments, the invention provides for methods to reduce colonization of S. aureus on the skin of patients with atopic dermatitis. In some embodiments, the microbial colonization is reduced by at least 10%, at least 15%, at least 20%, at least 25%, at least 30%, at least 35%, at least 40%, at least 45%, at least 50%, at least 55%, at least 60%, at least 65%, at least 70%, or at least 75% as compared to the baseline, upon administration of the IL-4R antagonist. [060] Microbial colonization may be measured with tests and procedures known in the art, e.g., by PCR, microbial culture, microscopy and staining or immunofluorescence. In certain embodiments, microbial colonization may be measured by the presence of microbial protein biomarkers known in the art, e.g., microbial toxin such as staph toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 . Methods for detecting and/or quantifying such biomarkers are known in the art. [061 ] In certain embodiments, the term "subject" includes a subject co-infected with one or more microbes, e.g., a subject co-infected with herpes simplex virus and S. aureus. [062] The present invention includes methods for reducing susceptibility to a skin infection in a subject. As used herein, the term "subject" refers to subjects with increased susceptibility to a skin infection or at greater risk of developing a skin infection, e.g., subjects with atopic dermatitis. In this aspect, the term "subject" includes subjects with severe atopic dermatitis, greater allergen sensitization, and subjects with asthma or food allergy. The term "subject" also includes subjects with elevated levels of serum total and allergen-specific IgE, or serum chemokines (e.g. , CCL17 or CCL27). Methods for Improving Skin Barrier Function [063] The present invention includes methods for improving skin barrier function in a subject comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of an IL-4R antagonist to the subject in need thereof. The "skin barrier function" refers to the protective function of the skin due to the structural permeability barrier of the stratum corneum layer and the secretion of anti-microbial peptides. The permeability barrier as well as the anti-microbial defense collapse or fail when the integrity of the skin is breached due to a skin infection or due to a disease such as atopic dermatitis. As used herein, the term "subject" may include subjects with a reduced skin barrier function or subjects who, prior to treatment, exhibit (or have exhibited) one or more parameters of skin barrier function. For example, the term "subject", as used herein, includes subjects with diminished production of skin anti-microbial peptides. [064] Examples of parameters of skin barrier function include: (a) stratum corneum hydration (SCH), (b) transepidermal water loss (TEWL), (c) skin surface pH, and (d) skin roughness profilometry (Eberlein-Konig et al 2000, Acta Derm. Venereol. 80: 188-191 ). SCH and TEWL may be measured by corneometry and evaporimetry methods known in the art (e.g., Vergananini et al 2010, J. Dermatol. Treatment, 21 : 126-129). [065] To determine whether skin barrier function parameter has "improved," the parameter is quantified at baseline and at one or more time points after administration of the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention. For example, a parameter may be measured at day 1 , day 2, day 3, day 4, day 5, day 6, day 7, day 8, day 9, day 10, day 1 1 , day 12, day 14, day 15, day 22, day 25, day 29, day 36, day 43, day 50, day 57, day 64, day 71 , day 85; or at the end of week 1 , week 2, week 3, week 4, week 5, week 6, week 7, week 8, week 9, week 10, week 1 1 , week 12, week 13, week 14, week 15, week 16, week 1 7, week 18, week 19, week 20, week 21 , week 22, week 23, week 24, or longer, after the initial treatment with a pharmaceutical composition of the present invention. The difference between the value of the parameter at a particular time point following initiation of treatment and the value of the parameter at baseline is used to establish whether there has been an "improvement" (e.g., a decrease) in the parameter. [066] Stratum corneum hydration (SCH): measurements of SCH are performed with a corneometer that registers electrical capacitance of the skin surface as a measurement of skin hydration. The higher the capacitance, the more hydrated the skin. According to certain embodiments of the present invention, administration of an IL-4R antagonist to a patient results in an increase in SCH score. In certain embodiments, the increase in SCH score is at least 10%, at least 20%, at least 30%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 60%, or at least 70% as compared to the baseline. [067] Transepidermal water loss (TEWL): TEWL is recorded using evaporimetry. The higher the measurement, the greater the loss of water from the skin. According to certain embodiments of the present invention, administration of an IL-4R antagonist to a patient results in a decrease in TEWL score. In certain embodiments, the decrease is at least 5%, at least 15%, at least 25%, at least 35%, at least 45%, at least 55%, at least 65%, or at least 75% as compared to the baseline. [068] Skin surface pH: Skin surface pH is measured with a pH meter. Skin surface pH increases due to several kinds of skin inflammation, including due to infection. According to certain embodiments of the present invention, administration of an IL-4R antagonist to a patient results in a decrease in skin surface pH to acidic pH. In certain embodiments, administration of the IL-4R antagonist to a patient results in a decrease in pH to pH 6.0, pH 5.9, pH 5.8, pH 5.7, pH 5.6, pH 5.5, pH 5.4, pH 5.3, pH 5.2, pH 5.1 , pH 5.0, pH 4.9, pH 4.8, pH 4.7, pH 4.6, or pH 4.5. [069] Skin roughness: Skin roughness is measured using a profilometer. Profiles of the skin roughness are obtained as electrical signs. Skin roughness is increased in conditions of skin infection and atopic dermatitis. . According to certain embodiments of the present invention, administration of an IL-4R antagonist to a patient results in a decrease in skin roughness. [070] In certain embodiments, the term "subject" includes subjects with a protein or gene or gene probe ("biomarker") associated with skin barrier function that may be differentially expressed due to reduced skin barrier function. For example, genes which are up-regulated in a subject with skin infection may include genes for markers of epidermal proliferation such as K16, Ki67; and genes which are down-regulated may include genes for terminal differentiation proteins such as filaggrin, loricrin or involucrin. In certain embodiments, the term "subject" refers to a patient with a disease or disorder such as atopic dermatitis. In particular embodiments, the term may include subjects with severe, allergen-driven (or extrinsic) AD disease. [071] According to certain aspects of the invention, methods for treating a skin infection or for improving skin barrier function are provided which comprise: (a) selecting a subject who exhibits a level of at least one parameter or a biomarker prior to or at the time of treatment which signifies the disease state; and (b) administering to the subject a pharmaceutical composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of an IL-4R antagonist. The level of the biomarker is determined or quantified by acquiring a sample from the patient for a biomarker assay known in the art. In certain other embodiments, a patient is selected by acquiring information relating to an elevated level of a biomarker from the patient. lnterleukin-4 Receptor Antagonists [072] The methods of the present invention comprise administering to a subject in need thereof a therapeutic composition comprising an interleukin-4 receptor (IL-4R) antagonist. As used herein, an "IL-4R antagonist" (also referred to herein as an "IL-4R inhibitor," an "IL-4Ra antagonist," an "IL-4R blocker," an "IL-4Ra blocker," etc.) is any agent which binds to or interacts with IL-4Ra or an IL-4R ligand, and inhibits or attenuates the normal biological signaling function a type 1 and/or a type 2 IL-4 receptor. Human IL-4Ra has the amino acid sequence of SEQ I D NO: 9. A type 1 IL-4 receptor is a dimeric receptor comprising an IL-4Ra chain and a yc chain. A type 2 IL-4 receptor is a dimeric receptor comprising an IL-4Ra chain and an IL-13Ra1 chain. Type 1 IL-4 receptors interact with and are stimulated by IL-4, while type 2 IL-4 receptors interact with and are stimulated by both IL-4 and IL-13. Thus, the IL-4R antagonists that can be used in the methods of the present invention may function by blocking IL-4-mediated signaling, IL-13-mediated signaling, or both IL-4- and IL-13-mediated signaling. The IL-4R antagonists of the present invention may thus prevent the interaction of IL-4 and/or IL-13 with a type 1 or type 2 receptor. [073] Non-limiting examples of categories of IL-4R antagonists include small molecule IL-4R inhibitors, anti-IL-4R aptamers, peptide-based IL-4R inhibitors (e.g., "peptibody" molecules), "receptor-bodies" (e.g., engineered molecules comprising the ligand-binding domain of an IL-4R component), and antibodies or antigen-binding fragments of antibodies that specifically bind human IL-4Ra. As used herein, IL-4R antagonists also include antigen-binding proteins that specifically bind IL-4 and/or IL-13. Anti-IL-4Ra Antibodies and Antigen-Binding Fragments Thereof [074] According to certain exemplary embodiments of the present invention, the IL-4R antagonist is an anti-IL-4Ra antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof. The term "antibody," as used herein, includes immunoglobulin molecules comprising four polypeptide chains, two heavy (H) chains and two light (L) chains inter-connected by disulfide bonds, as well as multimers thereof (e.g., IgM). In a typical antibody, each heavy chain comprises a heavy chain variable region (abbreviated herein as HCVR or VH) and a heavy chain constant region. The heavy chain constant region comprises three domains, CH1 , CH2 and CH3. Each light chain comprises a light chain variable region (abbreviated herein as LCVR or VL) and a light chain constant region. The light chain constant region comprises one domain (CL1 ). The VH and VL regions can be further subdivided into regions of hypervariability, termed complementarity determining regions (CDRs), interspersed with regions that are more conserved, termed framework regions (FR). Each VH and VL is composed of three CDRs and four FRs, arranged from amino-terminus to carboxy-terminus in the following order: FR1 , CDR1 , FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3, FR4. In different embodiments of the invention, the FRs of the anti-IL-4R antibody (or antigen-binding portion thereof) may be identical to the human germline sequences, or may be naturally or artificially modified. An amino acid consensus sequence may be defined based on a side-by-side analysis of two or more CDRs. [075] The term "antibody," as used herein, also includes antigen-binding fragments of full antibody molecules. The terms "antigen-binding portion" of an antibody, "antigen-binding fragment" of an antibody, and the like, as used herein, include any naturally occurring, enzymatically obtainable, synthetic, or genetically engineered polypeptide or glycoprotein that specifically binds an antigen to form a complex. Antigen-binding fragments of an antibody may be derived, e.g., from full antibody molecules using any suitable standard techniques such as proteolytic digestion or recombinant genetic engineering techniques involving the manipulation and expression of DNA encoding antibody variable and optionally constant domains. Such DNA is known and/or is readily available from, e.g., commercial sources, DNA libraries (including, e.g., phage-antibody libraries), or can be synthesized. The DNA may be sequenced and manipulated chemically or by using molecular biology techniques, for example, to arrange one or more variable and/or constant domains into a suitable configuration, or to introduce codons, create cysteine residues, modify, add or delete amino acids, etc. [076] Non-limiting examples of antigen-binding fragments include: (i) Fab fragments; (ii) F(ab')2 fragments; (iii) Fd fragments; (iv) Fv fragments; (v) single-chain Fv (scFv) molecules; (vi) dAb fragments; and (vii) minimal recognition units consisting of the amino acid residues that mimic the hypervariable region of an antibody (e.g., an isolated complementarity determining region (CDR) such as a CDR3 peptide), or a constrained FR3-CDR3-FR4 peptide. Other engineered molecules, such as domain-specific antibodies, single domain antibodies, domain- deleted antibodies, chimeric antibodies, CDR-grafted antibodies, diabodies, triabodies, tetrabodies, minibodies, nanobodies (e.g. monovalent nanobodies, bivalent nanobodies, etc.), small modular immunopharmaceuticals (SMIPs), and shark variable IgNAR domains, are also encompassed within the expression "antigen-binding fragment," as used herein. [077] An antigen-binding fragment of an antibody will typically comprise at least one variable domain. The variable domain may be of any size or amino acid composition and will generally comprise at least one CDR which is adjacent to or in frame with one or more framework sequences. In antigen-binding fragments having a VH domain associated with a VL domain, the VH and V|_ domains may be situated relative to one another in any suitable arrangement. For example, the variable region may be dimeric and contain VH-VH, VH-VL or VL-VL dimers. Alternatively, the antigen-binding fragment of an antibody may contain a monomeric VH or VL domain. [078] In certain embodiments, an antigen-binding fragment of an antibody may contain at least one variable domain covalently linked to at least one constant domain. Non-limiting, exemplary configurations of variable and constant domains that may be found within an antigen- binding fragment of an antibody of the present invention include: (i) VH-CH1 ; (ii) VH-CH2; (iii) VH- CH3; (iv) VH-Ch1 -Ch2; (V) VH-CH1 -Ch2-CH3; (vi) VH-CH2-CH3; (vii) VH-CL; (viii) VL-CH1 ; (ix) VL-CH2; (x) VL-CH3; (xi) VL-CH1 -CH2; (xii) VL-CH1 -Ch2-CH3; (xiii) VL-CH2-CH3; and (xiv) VL-CL. In any configuration of variable and constant domains, including any of the exemplary configurations listed above, the variable and constant domains may be either directly linked to one another or may be linked by a full or partial hinge or linker region. A hinge region may consist of at least 2 (e.g., 5, 10, 15, 20, 40, 60 or more) amino acids which result in a flexible or semi-flexible linkage between adjacent variable and/or constant domains in a single polypeptide molecule. Moreover, an antigen-binding fragment of an antibody of the present invention may comprise a homo-dimer or hetero-dimer (or other multimer) of any of the variable and constant domain configurations listed above in non-covalent association with one another and/or with one or more monomeric VH or VL domain (e.g., by disulfide bond(s)). [079] The term "antibody," as used herein, also includes multispecific (e.g., bispecific) antibodies. A multispecific antibody or antigen-binding fragment of an antibody will typically comprise at least two different variable domains, wherein each variable domain is capable of specifically binding to a separate antigen or to a different epitope on the same antigen. Any multispecific antibody format may be adapted for use in the context of an antibody or antigen- binding fragment of an antibody of the present invention using routine techniques available in the art. For example, the present invention includes methods comprising the use of bispecific antibodies wherein one arm of an immunoglobulin is specific for IL-4Ra or a fragment thereof, and the other arm of the immunoglobulin is specific for a second therapeutic target or is conjugated to a therapeutic moiety. Exemplary bispecific formats that can be used in the context of the present invention include, without limitation, e.g., scFv-based or diabody bispecific formats, IgG-scFv fusions, dual variable domain (DVD)-lg, Quadroma, knobs-into-holes, common light chain (e.g., common light chain with knobs-into-holes, etc.), CrossMab, CrossFab, (SEED) body, leucine zipper, Duobody, lgG1 /lgG2, dual acting Fab (DAF)-lgG, and Mab2 bispecific formats (see, e.g., Klein et al. 2012, mAbs 4:6, 1 -1 1 , and references cited therein, for a review of the foregoing formats). Bispecific antibodies can also be constructed using peptide/nucleic acid conjugation, e.g., wherein unnatural amino acids with orthogonal chemical reactivity are used to generate site-specific antibody-oligonucleotide conjugates which then self- assemble into multimeric complexes with defined composition, valency and geometry. (See, e.g., Kazane et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. [Epub: Dec. 4, 2012\). [080] The antibodies used in the methods of the present invention may be human antibodies. The term "human antibody," as used herein, is intended to include antibodies having variable and constant regions derived from human germline immunoglobulin sequences. The human antibodies of the invention may nonetheless include amino acid residues not encoded by human germline immunoglobulin sequences (e.g., mutations introduced by random or site-specific mutagenesis in vitro or by somatic mutation in vivo), for example in the CDRs and in particular CDR3. However, the term "human antibody," as used herein, is not intended to include antibodies in which CDR sequences derived from the germline of another mammalian species, such as a mouse, have been grafted onto human framework sequences. [081] The antibodies used in the methods of the present invention may be recombinant human antibodies. The term "recombinant human antibody," as used herein, is intended to include all human antibodies that are prepared, expressed, created or isolated by recombinant means, such as antibodies expressed using a recombinant expression vector transfected into a host cell (described further below), antibodies isolated from a recombinant, combinatorial human antibody library (described further below), antibodies isolated from an animal (e.g., a mouse) that is transgenic for human immunoglobulin genes (see e.g., Taylor et al. (1992) Nucl. Acids Res. 20:6287-6295) or antibodies prepared, expressed, created or isolated by any other means that involves splicing of human immunoglobulin gene sequences to other DNA sequences. Such recombinant human antibodies have variable and constant regions derived from human germline immunoglobulin sequences. In certain embodiments, however, such recombinant human antibodies are subjected to in vitro mutagenesis (or, when an animal transgenic for human Ig sequences is used, in vivo somatic mutagenesis) and thus the amino acid sequences of the VH and VL regions of the recombinant antibodies are sequences that, while derived from and related to human germline VH and VL sequences, may not naturally exist within the human antibody germline repertoire in vivo. [082] According to certain embodiments, the antibodies used in the methods of the present invention specifically bind IL-4Ra. The term "specifically binds," or the like, means that an antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof forms a complex with an antigen that is relatively stable under physiologic conditions. Methods for determining whether an antibody specifically binds to an antigen are well known in the art and include, for example, equilibrium dialysis, surface plasmon resonance, and the like. For example, an antibody that "specifically binds" IL- 4Ra, as used in the context of the present invention, includes antibodies that bind IL-4Ra or portion thereof with a KD of less than about 1000 nM, less than about 500 nM, less than about 300 nM, less than about 200 nM, less than about 100 nM, less than about 90 nM, less than about 80 nM, less than about 70 nM, less than about 60 nM, less than about 50 nM, less than about 40 nM, less than about 30 nM, less than about 20 nM, less than about 10 nM, less than about 5 nM, less than about 4 nM, less than about 3 nM, less than about 2 nM, less than about 1 nM or less than about 0.5 nM, as measured in a surface plasmon resonance assay. An isolated antibody that specifically binds human IL-4Ra may, however, have cross-reactivity to other antigens, such as IL-4Ra molecules from other (non-human) species. [083] According to certain exemplary embodiments of the present invention, the IL-4R antagonist is an anti-IL-4Ra antibody, or antigen-binding fragment thereof comprising a heavy chain variable region (HCVR), light chain variable region (LCVR), and/or complementarity determining regions (CDRs) comprising any of the amino acid sequences of the anti-IL-4R antibodies as set forth in US Patent No. 7,608,693. In certain exemplary embodiments, the anti- IL-4Ra antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof that can be used in the context of the methods of the present invention comprises the heavy chain complementarity determining regions (HCDRs) of a heavy chain variable region (HCVR) comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 and the light chain complementarity determining regions (LCDRs) of a light chain variable region (LCVR) comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2. According to certain embodiments, the anti-IL-4Ra antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof comprises three HCDRs (HCDR1 , HCDR2 and HCDR3) and three LCDRs (LCDR1 , LCDR2 and LCDR3), wherein the HCDR1 comprises the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 3; the HCDR2 comprises the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 4; the HCDR3 comprises the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 5; the LCDR1 comprises the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 6; the LCDR2 comprises the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 7; and the LCDR3 comprises the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 8. In some embodiments, the anti-IL-4R antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof comprises an HCVR comprising SEQ ID NO: 1 and an LCVR comprising SEQ ID NO: 2. According to certain exemplary embodiments, the methods of the present invention comprise the use of the anti-IL-4Ra antibody comprising HCDR1 -HCDR2- HCDR3-LCDR1 -LCDR2-LCDR3 amino acid sequences of SEQ ID NOs: 3-4-5-6-7-8 (referred to and known in the art as "dupilumab"), or a bioequivalent thereof. [084] In certain embodiments, the methods of the present invention comprise the use of an anti-IL-4R antibody, wherein the antibody comprises a heavy chain comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 10. In some embodiments, the anti-IL-4R antibody comprises a light chain comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 1 . An exemplary antibody comprising a heavy chain comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 10 and a light chain comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 1 is the fully human anti-IL-4R antibody known as dupilumab. According to certain exemplary embodiments, the methods of the present invention comprise the use of dupilumab, or a bioequivalent thereof. The term "bioequivalent", as used herein, refers to anti-IL-4R antibodies or IL-4R-binding proteins or fragments thereof that are pharmaceutical equivalents or pharmaceutical alternatives whose rate and/or extent of absorption do not show a significant difference with that of dupilumab when administered at the same molar dose under similar experimental conditions, either single dose or multiple dose. In the context of the invention, the term refers to antigen-binding proteins that bind to IL-4R which do not have clinically meaningful differences with dupilumab in their safety, purity and/or potency. [085] Other anti-IL-4Ra antibodies that can be used in the context of the methods of the present invention include, e.g., the antibody referred to and known in the art as AMG317 (Corren et ai, 2010, Am J Respir Crit Care Med, 787(8)788-796), or any of the anti-IL-4Ra antibodies as set forth in US Patent No. 7,186,809, US Patent No. 7,605,237, US Patent No. 7,608,693, or US Patent No. 8,092,804. [086] The anti-IL-4Ra antibodies used in the context of the methods of the present invention may have pH-dependent binding characteristics. For example, an anti-IL-4Ra antibody for use in the methods of the present invention may exhibit reduced binding to IL-4Ra at acidic pH as compared to neutral pH. Alternatively, an anti-IL-4Ra antibody of the invention may exhibit enhanced binding to its antigen at acidic pH as compared to neutral pH. The expression "acidic pH" includes pH values less than about 6.2, e.g., about 6.0, 5.95, 5.9, 5.85, 5.8, 5.75, 5.7, 5.65, 5.6, 5.55, 5.5, 5.45, 5.4, 5.35, 5.3, 5.25, 5.2, 5.15, 5.1 , 5.05, 5.0, or less. As used herein, the expression "neutral pH" means a pH of about 7.0 to about 7.4. The expression "neutral pH" includes pH values of about 7.0, 7.05, 7.1 , 7.15, 7.2, 7.25, 7.3, 7.35, and 7.4. [087] In certain instances, "reduced binding to IL-4Ra at acidic pH as compared to neutral pH" is expressed in terms of a ratio of the KD value of the antibody binding to IL-4Ra at acidic pH to the KD value of the antibody binding to IL-4Ra at neutral pH (or vice versa). For example, an antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof may be regarded as exhibiting "reduced binding to IL-4Ra at acidic pH as compared to neutral pH" for purposes of the present invention if the antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof exhibits an acidic/neutral KD ratio of about 3.0 or greater. In certain exemplary embodiments, the acidic/neutral KD ratio for an antibody or antigen-binding fragment of the present invention can be about 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 5.5, 6.0, 6.5, 7.0, 7.5, 8.0, 8.5, 9.0, 9.5, 10.0, 10.5, 1 1 .0, 1 1 .5, 12.0, 12.5, 13.0, 13.5, 14.0, 14.5, 15.0, 20.0, 25.0, 30.0, 40.0, 50.0, 60.0, 70.0, 100.0, or greater. [088] Antibodies with pH-dependent binding characteristics may be obtained, e.g., by screening a population of antibodies for reduced (or enhanced) binding to a particular antigen at acidic pH as compared to neutral pH. Additionally, modifications of the antigen-binding domain at the amino acid level may yield antibodies with pH-dependent characteristics. For example, by substituting one or more amino acids of an antigen-binding domain (e.g., within a CDR) with a histidine residue, an antibody with reduced antigen-binding at acidic pH relative to neutral pH may be obtained. As used herein, the expression "acidic pH" means a pH of 6.0 or less. Pharmaceutical Compositions [089] The present invention includes methods which comprise administering an IL-4R antagonist to a patient, wherein the IL-4R antagonist is contained within a pharmaceutical composition. The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention are formulated with suitable carriers, excipients, and other agents that provide suitable transfer, delivery, tolerance, and the like. A multitude of appropriate formulations can be found in the formulary known to all pharmaceutical chemists: Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Company, Easton, PA. These formulations include, for example, powders, pastes, ointments, jellies, waxes, oils, lipids, lipid (cationic or anionic) containing vesicles (such as LIPOFECTIN™), DNA conjugates, anhydrous absorption pastes, oil-in-water and water-in-oil emulsions, emulsions carbowax (polyethylene glycols of various molecular weights), semi-solid gels, and semi-solid mixtures containing carbowax. See also Powell et al. "Compendium of excipients for parenteral formulations" PDA (1998) J Pharm Sci Technol 52:238-31 1 . [090] The dose of antibody administered to a patient according to the methods of the present invention may vary depending upon the age and the size of the patient, symptoms, conditions, route of administration, and the like. The dose is typically calculated according to body weight or body surface area. Depending on the severity of the condition, the frequency and the duration of the treatment can be adjusted. Effective dosages and schedules for administering pharmaceutical compositions comprising anti-IL-4R antibodies may be determined empirically; for example, patient progress can be monitored by periodic assessment, and the dose adjusted accordingly. Moreover, interspecies scaling of dosages can be performed using well-known methods in the art (e.g., Mordenti et al., 1991 , Pharmaceut. Res. 8:1351 ). Specific exemplary doses of anti-IL4R antibodies, and administration regimens involving the same, that can be used in the context of the present invention are disclosed elsewhere herein. [091] Various delivery systems are known and can be used to administer the pharmaceutical composition of the invention, e.g., encapsulation in liposomes, microparticles, microcapsules, recombinant cells capable of expressing the mutant viruses, receptor mediated endocytosis (see, e.g., Wu et al., 1987, J. Biol. Chem. 262:4429-4432). Methods of administration include, but are not limited to, intradermal, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intravenous, subcutaneous, intranasal, epidural, and oral routes. The composition may be administered by any convenient route, for example by infusion or bolus injection, by absorption through epithelial or mucocutaneous linings (e.g., oral mucosa, rectal and intestinal mucosa, etc.) and may be administered together with other biologically active agents. [092] A pharmaceutical composition of the present invention can be delivered subcutaneously or intravenously with a standard needle and syringe. In addition, with respect to subcutaneous delivery, a pen delivery device readily has applications in delivering a pharmaceutical composition of the present invention. Such a pen delivery device can be reusable or disposable. A reusable pen delivery device generally utilizes a replaceable cartridge that contains a pharmaceutical composition. Once all of the pharmaceutical composition within the cartridge has been administered and the cartridge is empty, the empty cartridge can readily be discarded and replaced with a new cartridge that contains the pharmaceutical composition. The pen delivery device can then be reused. In a disposable pen delivery device, there is no replaceable cartridge. Rather, the disposable pen delivery device comes prefilled with the pharmaceutical composition held in a reservoir within the device. Once the reservoir is emptied of the pharmaceutical composition, the entire device is discarded. [093] Numerous reusable pen and autoinjector delivery devices have applications in the subcutaneous delivery of a pharmaceutical composition of the present invention. Examples include, but are not limited to AUTOPEN™ (Owen Mumford, Inc., Woodstock, UK), DISETRONIC™ pen (Disetronic Medical Systems, Bergdorf, Switzerland), HUMALOG MIX 75/25™ pen, HUMALOG™ pen, HUMALIN 70/30™ pen (Eli Lilly and Co., Indianapolis, IN), NOVOPEN™ I, II and III (Novo Nordisk, Copenhagen, Denmark), NOVOPEN JUNIOR™ (Novo Nordisk, Copenhagen, Denmark), BD™ pen (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ), OPTIPEN™, OPTIPEN PRO™, OPTIPEN STARLET™, and OPTICLIK™ (Sanofi-Aventis, Frankfurt, Germany), to name only a few. Examples of disposable pen delivery devices having applications in subcutaneous delivery of a pharmaceutical composition of the present invention include, but are not limited to the SOLOSTAR™ pen (Sanofi-Aventis), the FLEXPEN™ (Novo Nordisk), and the KWIKPEN™ (Eli Lilly), the SURECLICK™ Autoinjector (Amgen, Thousand Oaks, CA), the PENLET™ (Haselmeier, Stuttgart, Germany), the EPIPEN (Dey, L.P.), and the HUMIRA™ Pen (Abbott Labs, Abbott Park IL), to name only a few. [094] In certain situations, the pharmaceutical composition can be delivered in a controlled release system. In one embodiment, a pump may be used (see Langer, supra; Sefton, 1987, CRC Crit. Ref. Biomed. Eng. 14:201 ). In another embodiment, polymeric materials can be used; see, Medical Applications of Controlled Release, Langer and Wise (eds.), 1974, CRC Pres., Boca Raton, Florida. In yet another embodiment, a controlled release system can be placed in proximity of the composition's target, thus requiring only a fraction of the systemic dose (see, e.g., Goodson, 1984, in Medical Applications of Controlled Release, supra, vol. 2, pp. 115-138). Other controlled release systems are discussed in the review by Langer, 1990, Science 249:1527-1533. [095] The injectable preparations may include dosage forms for intravenous, subcutaneous, intracutaneous and intramuscular injections, drip infusions, etc. These injectable preparations may be prepared by known methods. For example, the injectable preparations may be prepared, e.g., by dissolving, suspending or emulsifying the antibody or its salt described above in a sterile aqueous medium or an oily medium conventionally used for injections. As the aqueous medium for injections, there are, for example, physiological saline, an isotonic solution containing glucose and other auxiliary agents, etc., which may be used in combination with an appropriate solubilizing agent such as an alcohol (e.g., ethanol), a polyalcohol (e.g., propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol), a nonionic surfactant [e.g., polysorbate 80, HCO-50 (polyoxyethylene (50 mol) adduct of hydrogenated castor oil)], etc. As the oily medium, there are employed, e.g., sesame oil, soybean oil, etc., which may be used in combination with a solubilizing agent such as benzyl benzoate, benzyl alcohol, etc. The injection thus prepared can be filled in an appropriate ampoule. [096] Advantageously, the pharmaceutical compositions for oral or parenteral use described above are prepared into dosage forms in a unit dose suited to fit a dose of the active ingredients. Such dosage forms in a unit dose include, for example, tablets, pills, capsules, injections (ampoules), suppositories, etc. [097] Exemplary pharmaceutical compositions comprising an anti-IL-4R antibody that can be used in the context of the present invention are disclosed, e.g., in US Patent Application Publication No. 2012/0097565. Dosage [098] The amount of IL-4R antagonist (e.g., anti-IL-4R antibody) administered to a subject according to the methods of the present invention is, generally, a therapeutically effective amount. As used herein, the phrase "therapeutically effective amount" means an amount of IL- 4R antagonist that results in one or more of: (a) reduced microbial colonization, including reduced colonization of S. aureus on the skin; (b) improved skin barrier function; (c) reduced risk of skin inflammation due to microbial infection; and/or (d) reduced susceptibility to a skin microbial infection. A "therapeutically effective amount" also includes an amount of IL-4R antagonist that inhibits, prevents, lessens, or delays the progression of a skin infection in a subject. In certain embodiments, the phrase "therapeutically effective amount" means an amount of IL-4R antagonist that results in a detectable improvement in one or more symptoms or indicia, including reduced number of flares or exacerbations in a subject with atopic dermatitis. [099] In the case of an anti-IL-4R antibody, a therapeutically effective amount can be from about 0.05 mg to about 600 mg, e.g., about 0.05 mg, about 0.1 mg, about 1 .0 mg, about 1 .5 mg, about 2.0 mg, about 10 mg, about 20 mg, about 30 mg, about 40 mg, about 50 mg, about 60 mg, about 70 mg, about 80 mg, about 90 mg, about 100 mg, about 1 10 mg, about 120 mg, about 130 mg, about 140 mg, about 150 mg, about 160 mg, about 170 mg, about 180 mg, about 190 mg, about 200 mg, about 210 mg, about 220 mg, about 230 mg, about 240 mg, about 250 mg, about 260 mg, about 270 mg, about 280 mg, about 290 mg, about 300 mg, about 310 mg, about 320 mg, about 330 mg, about 340 mg, about 350 mg, about 360 mg, about 370 mg, about 380 mg, about 390 mg, about 400 mg, about 410 mg, about 420 mg, about 430 mg, about 440 mg, about 450 mg, about 460 mg, about 470 mg, about 480 mg, about 490 mg, about 500 mg, about 510 mg, about 520 mg, about 530 mg, about 540 mg, about 550 mg, about 560 mg, about 570 mg, about 580 mg, about 590 mg, or about 600 mg, of the anti-IL-4R antibody. In certain embodiments, 75 mg, 150 mg, or 300 mg of an anti-IL-4R antibody is administered to a subject. [0100] The amount of IL-4R antagonist contained within the individual doses may be expressed in terms of milligrams of antibody per kilogram of patient body weight (i.e., mg/kg). For example, the IL-4R antagonist may be administered to a patient at a dose of about 0.0001 to about 10 mg/kg of patient body weight. Combination Therapies [0101 ] The methods of the present invention, according to certain embodiments, comprise administering to the subject one or more additional therapeutic agents in combination with the IL-4R antagonist. As used herein, the expression "in combination with" means that the additional therapeutic agents are administered before, after, or concurrent with the pharmaceutical composition comprising the IL-4R antagonist. The term "in combination with" also includes sequential or concomitant administration of IL-4R antagonist and a second therapeutic agent. [0102] For example, when administered "before" the pharmaceutical composition comprising the IL-4R antagonist, the additional therapeutic agent may be administered about 72 hours, about 60 hours, about 48 hours, about 36 hours, about 24 hours, about 12 hours, about 10 hours, about 8 hours, about 6 hours, about 4 hours, about 2 hours, about 1 hour, about 30 minutes, about 15 minutes or about 10 minutes prior to the administration of the pharmaceutical composition comprising the IL-4R antagonist. When administered "after" the pharmaceutical composition comprising the IL-4R antagonist, the additional therapeutic agent may be administered about 10 minutes, about 15 minutes, about 30 minutes, about 1 hour, about 2 hours, about 4 hours, about 6 hours, about 8 hours, about 10 hours, about 12 hours, about 24 hours, about 36 hours, about 48 hours, about 60 hours or about 72 hours after the administration of the pharmaceutical composition comprising the IL-4R antagonist. Administration "concurrent" or with the pharmaceutical composition comprising the IL-4R antagonist means that the additional therapeutic agent is administered to the subject in a separate dosage form within less than 5 minutes (before, after, or at the same time) of administration of the pharmaceutical composition comprising the IL-4R antagonist, or administered to the subject as a single combined dosage formulation comprising both the additional therapeutic agent and the IL-4R antagonist. [0103] The additional therapeutic agent may be, e.g., an anti-bacterial agent (including topical and systemic antibiotics, broad-spectrum and narrow-spectrum antibiotics), an anti-viral agent (e.g., acyclovir, or foscarnet), an anti-fungal agent (e.g., fluconazole and econazole nitrate), another IL-4R antagonist, an IgE antagonist, interferon-gamma (IFNy) antibiotics, topical antiseptic lotion, or any other emollient therapy or combinations thereof. [0104] The methods of the invention comprise administering an IL-4R antagonist in combination with a second therapeutic agent for additive or synergistic activity to reduce the risk of skin infections, e.g., in a patient with AD. Administration Regimens [0105] The present invention includes methods comprising administering to a subject a pharmaceutical composition comprising an IL-4R antagonist at a dosing frequency of about four times a week, twice a week, once a week, once every two weeks, once every three weeks, once every four weeks, once every five weeks, once every six weeks, once every eight weeks, once every twelve weeks, or less frequently so long as a therapeutic response is achieved. In certain embodiments involving the administration of a pharmaceutical composition comprising an anti- IL-4R antibody, once a week dosing at an amount of about 75 mg, 150 mg, or 300 mg, can be employed. [0106] According to certain embodiments of the present invention, multiple doses of an IL-4R antagonist may be administered to a subject over a defined time course. The methods according to this aspect of the invention comprise sequentially administering to a subject multiple doses of an IL-4R antagonist. As used herein, "sequentially administering" means that each dose of IL-4R antagonist is administered to the subject at a different point in time, e.g., on different days separated by a predetermined interval (e.g., hours, days, weeks or months). The present invention includes methods which comprise sequentially administering to the patient a single initial dose of an IL-4R antagonist, followed by one or more secondary doses of the IL-4R antagonist, and optionally followed by one or more tertiary doses of the IL-4R antagonist. [0107] The terms "initial dose," "secondary doses," and "tertiary doses," refer to the temporal sequence of administration of the IL-4R antagonist. Thus, the "initial dose" is the dose which is administered at the beginning of the treatment regimen (also referred to as the "baseline dose"); the "secondary doses" are the doses which are administered after the initial dose; and the "tertiary doses" are the doses which are administered after the secondary doses. The initial, secondary, and tertiary doses may all contain the same amount of IL-4R antagonist, but generally may differ from one another in terms of frequency of administration. In certain embodiments, however, the amount of IL-4R antagonist contained in the initial, secondary and/or tertiary doses varies from one another (e.g., adjusted up or down as appropriate) during the course of treatment. In certain embodiments, the initial dose comprises a first amount of the antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof and the one or more secondary doses each comprise a second amount of the antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof. In some embodiments, the first amount of antibody or fragment thereof is 1 .5x, 2x, 2.5x, 3x, 3.5x, 4x, or 5x the second amount of the antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof. In certain embodiments, one or more (e.g., 1 , 2, 3, 4, or 5) doses are administered at the beginning of the treatment regimen as "loading doses" followed by subsequent doses that are administered on a less frequent basis (e.g., "maintenance doses"). For example, an IL-4R antagonist may be administered to a patient with skin infection at a loading dose of about 300mg or about 600mg followed by one or more maintenance doses of about 75mg to about 300mg. In one embodiment, the initial dose and the one or more secondary doses each include 50mg to 600mg of the IL-4R antagonist, e.g., 10Omg to 400mg of the IL-4R antagonist, e.g., 10Omg, 150mg, 200mg, 250mg, 300mg, 400mg or 500mg of the IL-4R antagonist. [0108] In one exemplary embodiment of the present invention, each secondary and/or tertiary dose is administered 1 to 14 (e.g., 1 , 1 ½, 2, 2½, 3, 3½, 4, 4½, 5, 5½, 6, 6½, 7, 7½, 8, 8½, 9, 9½, 10, 10½, 1 1 , 1 1 ½, 12, 12½, 13, 13½, 14, 14½, or more) weeks after the immediately preceding dose. The phrase "the immediately preceding dose," as used herein, means, in a sequence of multiple administrations, the dose of IL-4R antagonist which is administered to a patient prior to the administration of the very next dose in the sequence with no intervening doses. [0109] The methods according to this aspect of the invention may comprise administering to a patient any number of secondary and/or tertiary doses of an IL-4R antagonist. For example, in certain embodiments, only a single secondary dose is administered to the patient. In other embodiments, two or more (e.g., 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or more) secondary doses are administered to the patient. Likewise, in certain embodiments, only a single tertiary dose is administered to the patient. In other embodiments, two or more (e.g., 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or more) tertiary doses are administered to the patient. [0110] In embodiments involving multiple secondary doses, each secondary dose may be administered at the same frequency as the other secondary doses. For example, each secondary dose may be administered to the patient 1 to 6 weeks after the immediately preceding dose. Similarly, in embodiments involving multiple tertiary doses, each tertiary dose may be administered at the same frequency as the other tertiary doses. For example, each tertiary dose may be administered to the patient 2 to 4 weeks after the immediately preceding dose. Alternatively, the frequency at which the secondary and/or tertiary doses are administered to a patient can vary over the course of the treatment regimen. The frequency of administration may also be adjusted during the course of treatment by a physician depending on the needs of the individual patient following clinical examination. [0111 ] The present invention includes methods comprising sequential administration of an IL- 4R antagonist and a second therapeutic agent, to a patient to treat a skin infection. In some embodiments, the present methods comprise administering one or more doses of an IL-4R antagonist followed by one or more doses of a second therapeutic agent. For example, one or more doses of about 75mg to about 300mg of the IL-4R antagonist may be administered after which one or more doses of a second therapeutic agent (e.g., an antibiotic or any other therapeutic agent, as described elsewhere herein) may be administered to treat, alleviate, reduce or ameliorate inflammation due to a skin microbial infection. In some embodiments, the IL-4R antagonist is administered at one or more doses resulting in improved skin barrier function followed by the administration of a second therapeutic agent to reduce pathogenic microbial flora on the skin. Alternative embodiments of the invention pertain to concomitant administration of an IL-4R antagonist and a second therapeutic agent. For example, one or more doses of an IL-4R antagonist are administered and a second therapeutic agent is administered at a separate dosage at a similar or different frequency relative to the IL-4R antagonist. In some embodiments, the second therapeutic agent is administered before, after or concurrently with the IL-4R antagonist. EXAMPLES [0112] The following examples are put forth so as to provide those of ordinary skill in the art with a complete disclosure and description of how to make and use the methods and compositions of the invention, and are not intended to limit the scope of what the inventors regard as their invention. Efforts have been made to ensure accuracy with respect to numbers used (e.g., amounts, temperature, etc.) but some experimental errors and deviations should be accounted for.

[0113] The exemplary IL-4R antagonist used in the following Examples is the human anti-IL- 4R antibody referred to in the art as dupilumab, wherein the antibody comprises three HCDRs (HCDR1 , HCDR2 and HCDR3) and three LCDRs (LCDR1 , LCDR2 and LCDR3), wherein the HCDR1 comprises the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 3; the HCDR2 comprises the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 4; the HCDR3 comprises the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 5; the LCDR1 comprises the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 6; the LCDR2 comprises the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 7; and the LCDR3 comprises the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 8 (also referred to herein as "mAb1 "). Example 1 : Treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis with anti-IL- 4R antibody: analysis of pooled phase 1 b studies [0114] AD efficacy parameters were measured and pooled for analysis from two separate clinical trials in patients with moderate-to-severe AD. "Study A" was a 12-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, sequential ascending dose study to assess the safety and tolerability of administered anti-IL-4R antibody (mAb1 ) in patients with atopic dermatitis. The treatment period was 4 weeks with patients being followed for 8 weeks after the end of the treatment period. Patients were randomized in a 4:1 ratio to receive mAb1 or placebo in each of the three ascending dose cohorts (75 mg, 150 mg, or 300 mg). The study consisted of a screening period (day -14 to day -3), a treatment period (day 1 through day 29), and a follow-up period (day 29 through day 85). During the treatment period, patients were seen in the clinic once weekly for safety, laboratory and clinical effect assessments on days 1 , 4, 8, 15, 22, 25 and 29 (week 4). Patients received a dose of mAb1 or placebo on days 1 , 8, 15 and 22. The end of the treatment period study was on day 29 (week 4). Patients were monitored at the study site for 6 hours after the injection (of mAb1 or placebo) on day 1 , and for 3 hours after the injection on days 8, 15 and 22. During the follow-up period, patients were seen in the clinic for follow-up assessments at days 36, 43, 50, 57, 64, 71 , and 85 (end of study visit). [0115] "Study B" was a 12-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, sequential ascending, repeated-dose study in patients with moderate-to-severe AD. AD subjects were administered 150mg or 300 mg of mAb1 , or placebo on days 1 , 8, 15 and 22 of the study (four weekly doses). All administrations for both studies were subcutaneous. [0116] The patient inclusion criteria for the studies were: (1 ) should be male or female≥ 18 years; (2) have chronic atopic dermatitis for 3 years; (3) have EASI≥ 12; (4) IGA≥ 3; (5)≥ 15% BSA of AD involvement (in the US) or≥ 10% BSA of AD involvement (ex-US); and (6) history of inadequate response to stable regimen of topical corticosteroids (TCS) or calcineurin inhibitors. [0117] The patient exclusion criteria for the study were: (1 ) WBC < 3.5 x 103/μΙ; (2) platelets < 125 x 103/μΙ; (3) neutrophils < 1 .75 x 103/μΙ; (4) AST/ALT > 1 .5x ULN; (5) positive for hepatitis B or hepatitis C; and (6) treatment with TCS or calcineurin inhibitors within 1 week of baseline. [0118] The primary endpoint of the studies was to monitor incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) from baseline through week 12. The exploratory endpoints for efficacy variables were: (i) % achieving an IGA of 0 or 1 through week 4; (ii) % improvement in BSA and EASI from baseline; and (iii) change from baseline in NRS scale. [0119] The exploratory efficacy variables measured in this study included: (1 ) proportion of patients who achieved an investigator's global assessment (IGA) score of 0 or 1 through week 4 and each study visit; (2) change and percent change in body surface area involvement of atopic dermatitis (BSA), eczema area and severity index (EASI), SCORAD, and 5-D pruritus scale from baseline to each visit; (3) weekly change from baseline in pruritus numeric rating scale (NRS); (4) change from baseline in circulating eosinophils, TARC, eotaxin-3, and total IgE through week 4; (5) change from baseline in circulating eosinophils, TARC, eotaxin-3, and total IgE through week 12; and (6) change from baseline in eosinophils, TARC, eotaxin-3, Phadiatop™ results, and total IgE associated with response through week 4. [0120] Baseline for efficacy variable is defined as the last non-missing value on or before the date of randomization. For the patient who has no value on or before his/her randomization date the last non-missing value on or before the date of first dose injection will be used as baseline. [0121] Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA): The IGA is an assessment scale used in clinical studies to determine severity of AD and clinical response to treatment based on a 6-point scale ranging from 0 (clear) to 5 (very severe). The IGA score was assessed at every clinic visit. [0122] Body Surface Area Involvement of Atopic Dermatitis (BSA): BSA affected by AD was assessed for each major section of the body (head, trunk, upper extremities, and lower extremities) and was reported as the total of percentage from each body sections. Patients were assessed for BSA at the following visits: screening, dayl/baseline (pre-dose), and days 15, 29, 36, 43, 57, 71 , and 85 (end of study) or early termination. [0123] Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI): The EASI is a validated measure used in clinical practice and clinical trials to assess the severity and extent of AD (Hanifin et al 2001 , Exp. Dermatol. 10: 1 1 -18). The EASI score calculation is based upon the Physician's Assessment of Individual Signs [erythema (E), induration/papulation (I), excoriation (X), and lichenification (L)], where each sign is scored as 0 = Absent, 1 = Mild, 2 = Moderate, or 3 = Severe, and also upon the Area Score [based on the % (BSA) affected] where 0 = 0% BSA, 1 = 1 -9% BSA, 2 = 10-29% BSA, 3 = 30-49% BSA, 4 = 50-69% BSA, 5 = 70-89% BSA, 6 = 90- 100% BSA. [0124] For each of major section of the body (head, upper extremities, trunk and lower extremities), EASI score = (E+l+X+L) x Area Score. The total EASI score is the weighted total of the section EASI using the weights 10% = head, 20% = upper extremities, 30% = trunk, 40% = lower extremities. The minimum possible EASI score is 0 and the maximum possible EASI score is 72 where a higher score indicates increased severity of atopic dermatitis. Achieving an EASI 50 (50% or greater improvement in EASI score is considered by dermatology investigators to a clinically significant level of improvement to use as an endpoint. [0125] Patients underwent EASI score assessment at the following visits: screening, day 1 /baseline (pre-dose), and days 15, 29, 36, 43, 57, 71 , and 85 (end of study) or early termination. [0126] SCORAD: The SCORAD is a validated tool used in clinical research and clinical practice that was developed to standardize the evaluation of the extent and severity of AD (Dermatology 1993, 186: 23-31 ). The extent of AD is assessed as a percentage of each defined body area and reported as the sum of all areas, with a maximum score of 100% (assigned as "A" in the overall SCORAD calculation). The severity of 6 specific symptoms (erythema, oedema / papulation, excoriations, lichenification, oozing / crusts and dryness) of AD is assessed using the following scale: none (0), mild (1 ), moderate (2), or severe (3) (for a maximum of 18 total points, assigned as "B" in the overall SCORAD calculation). Subjective assessment of itch and sleeplessness is recorded for each symptom by the patient or relative on a visual analogue scale (VAS), where 0 is no itch (or sleeplessness) and 10 is the worst imaginable itch (or sleeplessness), with a maximum possible score of 20. This parameter is assigned as "C" in the overall SCORAD calculation. The SCORAD score is calculated as A/5 + 7B/2 + C. The maximum SCORAD score is 103. [0127] Patients underwent SCORAD assessment at the following visits: screening, day 1 /baseline (pre-dose), and days 15, 29, 36, 43, 57, 71 , and 85 (end of study) or early termination. [0128] 5-D Pruritus Scale: The 5-D Pruritus Scale is a 5-question tool used in clinical trials to assess 5 dimensions of background itch: degree, duration, direction, disability, and distribution (Elman et. al.2010, Brit. J. Dermatol. 162: 587-593). Patients rate their symptoms over the preceding 2-week period as "present" or on a 1 to 5 scale, with 5 being the most affected for each question in degree, duration, direction and disability. Single-item domain scores (duration, degree and direction) are equal to the value indicated below the response choice (range 1 -5). [0129] The disability domain includes four items that assess the impact of itching on daily activities: sleep, leisure/social activities, housework/errands and work/school. The score for the disability domain is achieved by taking the highest score on any of the four items. [0130] For the distribution domain, the number of affected body parts is tallied (potential sum 0-16) and the sum is sorted into five scoring bins: sum of 0-2 = score of 1 , sum of 3-5 = score of 2, sum of 6-10 = score of 3, sum of 1 1 -13 = score of 4, and sum of 14-16 = score of 5. [0131] The scores of each of the five domains are achieved separately and then summed together to obtain a total 5-D score. 5-D scores can potentially range between 5 (no pruritus) and 25 (most severe pruritus). [0132] Patients underwent 5-D pruritus assessment at the following visits: screening, day 1/baseline (pre-dose), and days 15, 29, 43, 57, 71 , and 85 (end of study) or early termination. [0133] Pruritus Numeric Rating Scale (NRS): The Pruritus NRS is a single-question assessment tool that was used to assess the patient's worst itch as a result of AD in the previous 12 hours. Patients call in to the IVRS twice daily from the evening of the screening visit and be asked the following question, "on a scale of 0 - 10, with 0 being 'no itch' and 10 being the 'worst itch imaginable', how would you rate your worst degree of itch experienced during the previous 12 hours?" Patients are instructed on using the IVRS to record their Pruritus NRS score at the screening visit and are queried for compliance at each following clinic visit. Patients complete the rating scale twice daily through the last study visit. [0134] The baseline NRS is defined as the average of the reported NRSs during right after the screening visit and right before the baseline visit. For post-baseline NRS, The mean weekly NRS is calculated as the average of the reported daily NRS within the week (prorated mean). [0135] The IGA, BSA, EASI and SCORAD scores were assessed at every clinic visit. Patients underwent 5-D pruritus assessment at the following visits: screening, day 1/baseline (pre-dose), and days 15, 29, 43, 57, 71 , and 85 (end of study) or early termination. Patients used the IVRS to record their Pruritus NRS score twice daily through the last study visit. [0136] Baseline for efficacy variable is defined as the last non-missing value on or before the date of randomization. For the patient who has no value on or before his/her randomization date the last non-missing value on or before the date of first dose injection will be used as baseline. [0137] The baseline demographics for the patient population are presented below in Table 1 . Table 1 : Baseline Demographics The mean baseline disease characteristics are given in Table 2.

At 4 weeks, 150mg and 300mg mAbl achieved significant improvements vs. placebo for change from baseline in %BSA (p<0.05) (Figure 1 ), IGA (p<0.001 ) (Figure 2), EASI (p<0.001 ) (Figure 3), and pruritus NRS (p<0.01 , 300 mg) (Figure 4). More patients had≥ 50% reduction in EASI score with 150mg mAbl (54.5%) and with 300mg (71 .4%) vs. placebo (18.8%; p<0.05 for both) (Figures 5 and 6). More patients achieved EASI-25, EASI-50, and EASI-75 with mAbl over placebo at week 4 (Figure 7). [0141] For 300 mg mAb1 , significant improvement was seen within 2 weeks in %BSA (p<0.02), IGA (p<0.05), and EASI (p<0.0001 ). Improvements for BSA, IGA and EASI (p<0.05 vs. placebo) were maintained for 8 weeks. The proportion of patients with IGA 0 or 1 at week 4 was higher than placebo, but not statistically significant (Figure 8). [0142] The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) with mAb1 administration were nasopharyngitis (19.6% vs. 12.5% for placebo) and headache (1 1 .8% vs. 6.3% for placebo). Example 2: Repeat-dose Clinical Trial of Subcutaneously Administered anti-IL-4R Antibody (mAbl ) in adult patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis A. Study Design [0143] This study was a 28-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the anti-IL-4R mAb, referred herein as "mAbl ", administered subcutaneously in patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. The treatment period was 12 weeks in duration with the patients followed for a further 16 weeks after end of the treatment. [0144] 109 patients were included and randomized in the ratio of 1 :1 for the study (54 in placebo and 55 for 300mg of the antibody). 43 patients (30 in placebo and 13 in 300 mg group) withdrew from the study. Randomization was stratified according to IgE levels (IgE < 150 kU/L vs.≥ 150 kU/L at the screening visit) to test the efficacy of mAbl in patients with extrinsic or intrinsic form of AD. Patients who met eligibility criteria underwent day 1 /baseline assessments, randomization, and then received 300 mg of mAbl or placebo SC. Each weekly dose of study drug was given as one 2-mL injection, or was split into two 1 -ml_ injections. Patients returned for weekly clinic visits and received an injection of study drug on days 8, 15, 22, 29, 36, 43, 50, 57, 64, 71 , and 78. Patients were closely monitored at the study site for a minimum of 2 hours after each dose of study drug. The end of the treatment period was day 85. Follow-up visits occurred on days 92, 99, 106, 1 13, 120, 127, 134, 141 , 148, 155, 162, 169, 176, 183, 190, and the end of study visit on day 197. [0145] Inclusion criteria for the study were as follows: (1 ) Male or female 18 years or older; (2) Chronic AD, diagnosed by the Eichenfield revised criteria of Hannifin and Rajka, that has been present for at least 3 years before the screening visit; (3) EASI score≥ 16 at the screening and baseline visits; (4) IGA score≥ 3 at the screening and baseline visits; (5)≥ 10% BSA of AD involvement at the screening and baseline visits; (6) history of inadequate response to a stable (≥ 1 month) regimen of topical corticosteroids or calcineurin inhibitors as treatment for AD within the last 3 months before the screening visit; (7) Patients must have applied a stable dose of an additive-free, basic bland emollient twice-daily for at least 7 days before the baseline visit; and (8) Willingness, commitment, and ability to return for all clinic visits and complete all study- related procedures and willing and able to sign the informed consent form (ICF). [0146] Exclusion criteria for the study were as follows: (1 ) Prior treatment with mAb1 ; (2) Presence of any of the following laboratory abnormalities at the screening visit: white blood cell count < 3.5 x 103/μΙ_; platelet count <125 x 103/μΙ_; neutrophil count <1 .75 x 103/μΙ_; aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) >1 .5x the ULN; and CPK > 2x the ULN; (3) Positive or indeterminate results at the screening visit for hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis B core antibody or hepatitis C antibody; (4) Onset of a new exercise routine or major change to a previous exercise routine within 4 weeks prior to screening (visit 1 ). Subjects had to be willing to maintain a similar level of exercise for the duration of the study and to refrain from unusually strenuous exercise for the duration of the trial; (5) Treatment with an investigational drug within 8 weeks or within 5 half-lives, if known, whichever is longer, before the baseline visit; (6) Treatment with a live (attenuated) vaccine within 12 weeks before the baseline visit; (7) Treatment with allergen immunotherapy within 6 months before the baseline visit; (8) Treatment with leukotriene inhibitors within 4 weeks before the baseline visit; (9) Treatment with systemic corticosteroids within 4 weeks before the baseline visit; (10) Treatment with topical corticosteroids, tacrolimus, and/or pimecrolimus within 1 week before the baseline visit; (1 1 ) Systemic treatment for AD with an immunosuppressive/immunomodulating substance, e.g. Cyclosporine, mycophenolate-mofetil, IFN-γ, phototherapy, (narrow band uvB, uvB, uvA1 , psoralen + uvA), azathioprine, methotrexate, or biologies, within 4 weeks before the baseline visit; (12) three or more bleach baths during any week within the 4 weeks before the baseline visit; (13) Treatment of AD with a medical device (eg.

Adequate birth control is defined as agreement to consistently practice an effective and accepted method of contraception throughout the duration of the study and for 16 weeks after last dose of study drug. For females, adequate birth control methods are defined as: hormonal contraceptives, intrauterine device (IUD), or double barrier contraception (i.e., condom + diaphragm, condom or diaphragm + spermicidal gel or foam). For males, adequate birth control methods are defined as: double barrier contraception (i.e., condom + diaphragm, condom or diaphragm + spermicidal gel or foam). For females, menopause is defined as 24 months without menses; if in question, a follicle-stimulating hormone of ≥25 U/mL must be documented. Hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or bilateral tubal ligation must be documented, as applicable. B. Efficacy Variables [0147] The primary endpoint was the percent change in EASI score from baseline to week 12. The secondary endpoints measured in this study included: (1 ) proportion of patients who achieved an investigator's global assessment (IGA) score of 0 or 1 at week 12; (2) proportion of patients who achieved≥ 50% overall improvement in EASI score (also called EASI 50) from baseline to week 12; (3) change in EASI score from baseline to week 12; (4) change and percent change in IGA score, body surface area involvement of atopic dermatitis (BSA), eczema area and severity index (EASI), SCORAD, Pruritus NRS and 5-D pruritus scale from baseline to week 12; (5) Incidence of TEAEs from baseline through week 28; (6) change from baseline in eosinophils, TARC, Phadiatop™ results, and total IgE associated with response; (7) change in QoLIAD from baseline to week 12; (8) proportion of patients who achieve reduction of IGA score of ≥ 2 from baseline to week 12; (9) proportion of patients who achieve reduction of IGA score of ≥ 3 from baseline to week 12; and (10) PD response of circulating eosinophils, TARC and total IgE. [0148] Baseline for efficacy variable is defined as the last non-missing value on or before the date of randomization. For the patient who has no value on or before his/her randomization date the last non-missing value on or before the date of first dose injection will be used as baseline. Investigation Procedures [0149] The efficacy variables IGA, BSA, EASI, SCORAD, 5-D Pruritus scale, and Pruritus NRS rating have been described elsewhere herein (see Example 1 ). [0150] The IGA, BSA, EASI and SCORAD scores were assessed at every clinic visit. Patients underwent 5-D pruritus assessment at the following visits: screening, day 1 /baseline (pre-dose), and days 15, 29, 43, 57, 71 , 85, 99, 1 13, 127, 141 , 155, 169, 183 and 197 (end of study) or early termination. Patients used the IVRS to record their Pruritus NRS score twice daily through the last study visit. [0151 ] Quality of Life Index for Atopic Dermatitis (QoLIAD): The QoLIAD is a 25-item, validated questionnaire used in clinical practice and clinical trials to assess the impact of AD disease symptoms and treatment on QoL (Whalley et al 2004, Br. J. Dermatol. 150: 274-283; Meads et al 2005, Value Health 8: 331 -332). The format is a simple yes/no response to 25 items with a scoring system of 0 to 25; a high score is indicative of a poor QoL. The analysis is sensitive to change with a 2-3 point difference considered as clinically meaningful. The questionnaire was administered to a subset of patients at screening and day 1 /baseline (pre- dose), and days 29, 57, 85, and 197 (end of study) or early termination. The differences between treatments were compared using an analysis of covariance model (ANCOVA) with relative baseline as a covariate. C. Investigational Treatment [0152] mAb1 drug product was supplied as a lyophilized powder in a 5 ml glass vial for SC administration. When delivered SC, the mAb1 drug product was reconstituted with 2.5 ml of sterile water for injection, yielding a solution containing 150 mg/mL of mAb1 . The dose level of mAb1 tested was 300 mg for SC administration. mAb1 or placebo was administered as 1 (2 mL) or 2 (1 mL) SC injections in the clinic on day 1 /baseline and days 8, 15, 22, 29, 36, 43, 50, 57, 64, 71 , and 78. Although it was preferred that each weekly dose of study drug be given as one 2-mL injection, each weekly dose could be split into two 1 -mL injections. Subcutaneous injection sites were alternated between the following sites: back of arms, abdomen (except the navel or waist area), and upper thighs. Administration to the extremities was not allowed due to the possibility of different absorption and bioavailability. If administration of multiple injections were required on the same day, each injection was delivered at a different injection site (e.g., 1 injection administered in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen and the other in the left lower quadrant of the abdomen). Subcutaneous injection sites were alternated so that the same sites were not injected for 2 consecutive weeks. [0153] Placebo matching mAb1 was prepared in the same formulation as mAb1 , but without addition of antibody. [0154] Patients were monitored at the study site for a minimum of 2 hours after each dose of study drug. [0155] In addition, patients were required to apply stable doses of an additive-free, basic bland emollient twice daily for at least 7 days before the baseline visit and throughout study participation. Patients reported compliance with background treatment during the study using the IVRS or IWRS. The system prompted patients to answer the following question about emollient use: "Did you use a moisturizer approved by the study doctor on the affected areas of your skin?" D. Safety Assessment [0156] Safety was assessed throughout the study by monitoring Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events. [0157] An Adverse Event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product. An AE can, therefore, be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal (investigational) product. AEs also include: any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant change in frequency and/or intensity) of a pre-existing condition that is temporally associated with the use of the study drug; abnormal laboratory findings considered by the Investigator to be clinically significant; and any untoward medical occurrence. [0158] A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in death; is life-threatening; requires in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; results in persistent or significant disability/ incapacity; is a congenital anomaly/ birth defect; or is an important medical event. [0159] In addition, laboratory safety variables, vital sign variables, 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG) variables, and physical examination variables were measured throughout the study. [0160] The clinical laboratory data consists of hematology, blood chemistry and urinalysis. Blood samples for hematology testing were collected at every study visit; blood samples for serum chemistry testing and urine samples for urinalysis were collected to measure overall patient health at screening, day 1/ baseline (pre-dose), day 15, day 29, day 43, day 57, day 71 , day 85, day 99, day 1 13, day 141 , day 169, and day 197 (end-of study) or early termination if subject is discontinued from the study. [0161] Vital sign parameters include respiratory rate (bpm), pulse rate (bpm), systolic and diastolic blood pressure (mmHg) and body temperature (eC). Vital signs were collected (pre- dose, on dosing days) at screening and day 1 /baseline, and days 8, 15, 22, 29, 36, 43, 50, 57, 64, 71 , 78, 85, 99, 1 13, 141 , 169 and 197 (end of study) or early termination. Vital signs were taken at 1 and 2 hours post-injection following the study drug dose on days 1 , 8, 15, 22, 29, 36, 43, 50, 57, 64, 71 and 78. [0162] 12-Lead ECG parameters include: Ventricular HR, PR interval, QRS interval, corrected QT interval (QTcF=QT/[RR0 33] and QTcB=QT/[RR05]) ECG status: normal, abnormal not clinical significant or abnormal clinical significant. A standard 12-lead ECG was performed at screening, day 141 , and day 197 (end of study) or early termination. [0163] Research samples (serum/RNA/plasma) were collected at screening and dayl /baseline (pre-dose), and days 8, 15, 22, 29, 57, 85, and 197 (end of study) or early termination, and at unscheduled visits. [0164] A thorough and complete physical examination was performed at screening, day 85, and day 197 (end of study) or early termination. E. Data Analysis 1. Analyses of Exploratory Efficacy Variables [0165] All categorical variables were analyzed using the Fisher's Exact test with nominal p- value and confidence intervals reported. All continuous variables were analyzed by the ANalysis of COVAriance (ANCOVA) using baseline IgE stratum (<150 kU/L vs.≥150 kU/L at the screening visit). Unless otherwise specified, assessments of changes from baseline and construction of confidence intervals for continuous measures were based on an ANCOVA model which includes treatment as the main factor and baseline value as covariates. Point estimate and 95% CI of the difference in adjusted mean change from baseline between two treatment groups are provided. Missing values will be imputed by the last observation carried forward (LOCF) approach. In the event that the model assumptions are not warranted, the Rank-based analysis of covariates will be used. 2. Analysis of Safety Data [0166] The safety analysis is based on the reported AEs, clinical laboratory evaluations, vital signs, and 12-lead ECG. Thresholds for Potentially Clinically Significant Values (PCSV) in laboratory variables, vital signs and ECG are defined in SAP. The time interval to detect any event or abnormality is between the infusion of study medication and end of study. Data collected outside this interval are excluded from the calculation of descriptive statistics and identification of abnormalities for laboratory evaluations, vital signs and ECG. F. Safety: Results [0167] mAb1 was generally well-tolerated with a favorable safety profile. No clinically significant laboratory test results (blood chemistry, hematology, or urinalysis) were reported during the study. No trends were seen in mean/median baseline in any laboratory parameter. There were no significant trends in mean or median changes from baseline in temperature or pulse throughout the study. No clinically significant abnormalities were seen on physical examination results, ECGs or vital signs. [0168] The overall adverse event (AE) profile was characteristic of a healthy population. No deaths were reported. There were 8 patients with SAEs, of which 1 was in mAb1 group (facial bones fracture) and 7 were in the placebo group (angina pectoris, cellulitis, eczema herpeticum, skin bacterial infection, renal failure, asthmatic crisis, lung disorder and atopic dermatitis). There were 8 patients with TEAE resulting in discontinuation from study drug, of which 1 was in the mAb1 group and 7 in the placebo group. There were 87 patients with at least one TEAE (n=43 [78.2%] in mAb1 vs. 44 [81 .5%] in placebo group). The most frequent TEAEs were nasopharyngitis infections in subjects dosed with mAb1 (n=22 [40%] vs. 10 [18.5%] for placebo). Other TEAEs in the treatment group included eye infections, nervous system disorders, and general disorders and administration site conditions. The TEAEs over 28 weeks are summarized in Table 12. Table 12: Treatment Emergent Adverse Events over 28 weeks Due to AE 3 (5.6) 1 (1 .8) Due to lack of efficacy 23 (42.6) 7 (12.7) Infections and Infestations 31 (57.4) 31 (56.4) Most common AEs (≥10%) Nasopharyngitis 10 (18.5) 22 (40.0) Headache 7 (13.0) 9 (16.4) Conjunctivitis 2 (3.7) 7 (12.7) [0169] There were notably fewer skin infections associated with mAb1 treatment (5.5%) compared with placebo (24.1 %). The number and type of skin infections observed in patients on mAb1 versus placebo are shown in Table 13. Table 13: Skin infections in patients on mAbl vs. placebo [0170] Subcutaneous administration of mAbl to adult patients with moderate-to-severe AD was generally safe and we 11 -tolerated. G. Efficacy: Results [0171] The baseline and exploratory efficacy results obtained from the study are summarized in Figures 9 - 28 and Tables 14 - 24. As noted above, patients were treated with 300 mg subcutaneous mAbl once a week for 12 weeks, or with placebo.

Conclusions [0172] Subcutaneous administration of an anti-IL-4R antibody (mAb1 ) to adult patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis was generally safe and well tolerated after 12 weekly doses of 300 mg. Administration of mAb1 at 300 mg resulted in significant improvement in IGA, EASI, BSA, SCORAD and NRS pruritus through day 85 in both mean and absolute and percent change, as compared to baseline (see Tables 14, 16 - 21 ). The proportion of patients achieving an IGA score of 0 or 1 at Day 85 for the 300mg group was 40.0%, while the same number for placebo was 7.4% (Table 22). At Day 85, the proportion of patients who achieved an EASI score percent decrease of 50% ("EASI-50") was 85.5% for the 300 mg group, whereas the EASI-50 for placebo-treated patients at Day 85 was 35.2% (Table 23). The percent change in EASI score from baseline to week 12 of mAb1 was statistically significant from placebo group (-74.0% vs. - 23.0%, p-value<0.0001 ). Treatment with mAb1 significantly reduced all four disease components of EASI compared with placebo: erythema, infiltration/population/edema, excoriation and lichenification (p <0.0001 for all 4 components; Figure 15). The treatment group was statistically significantly different from placebo group in all of the secondary efficacy endpoints. The following were the p-values for: IGA responder (0 or 1 ) (<0.0001 ), EASI responder (<0.0001 ), EASI absolute change from baseline (<0.0001 ), absolute change of IGA from baseline (<0.0001 ), percent change of IGA from baseline (<0.0001 ), absolute change in BSA (<0.0001 ), absolute change in SCORAD (<0.0001 ), absolute change in Pruritus NRS (<0.0001 ), and absolute change in 5-D pruritus scale from baseline to week 12 (<0.0001 ) respectively. Treatment with mAb1 significantly reduced all five components of 5-D Pruritus score: duration, degree, direction, disability and distribution (p < 0.0001 for duration, degree, disability and distribution, p < 0.001 for direction; Figure 24). Administration of 300mg mAb1 significantly improved QoL relative to placebo over the 12-week treatment (Figure 27). Improvement from baseline in QoLIAD was significantly greater with mAb1 relative to placebo at 4 weeks (LS mean difference -5.1 ; 95% CI -7.7, -2.4; P=0.0003), 12 weeks (LS mean difference -6.4; 95% CI -9.0, -3.8; P<0.0001 ), and end of study (LS mean difference -6.3; 95% CI -9.0, - 3.7; P<0.0001 ). At 12 weeks, changes in QoLIAD with mAb1 moderately correlated with changes in disease activity and pruritus, with Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.435 for the EASI score, 0.406 for the pruritus numerical rating score, and 0.494 for the 5D Pruritus Scale score (all P<0.05). Further, treatment with 300mg mAb1 also resulted in fewer skin infections in patients with AD (5.5%) compared with placebo (24.5%), including bacterial, viral and fungal infections. Patients treated with mAb1 showed a reduced susceptibility to microbial infections than those on placebo. Example 3: Skin Barrier Function Analysis [0173] Skin barrier function analysis was conducted on samples taken from subjects who participated in clinical trials of mAb1 . Study A [0174] In 'Study A', AD subjects were administered either mAb1 (75, 150 or 300 mg) or placebo, on days 1 , 8, 15 and 22 of the study (i.e., four weekly doses). Stratum corneum hydration (SCH; corneometry) and transepidermal water loss (TEWL; evaporimetry) (Vergananini et al 2010, J. Dermatol. Treatment 21 : 126-129) were measured at baseline, day 29 (end of treatment) and day 85 (end of study) for a subset of patients in the study. [0175] The median baseline measurements for SCH and TEWL are summarized in Table 25. Table 25: Median baseline SCH and TEWL [0176] For SCH, the higher the capacitance (a.u.), the more hydrated the skin. The median SCH results for both lesional and non-lesional skin were below those reported for "normal" skin (i.e., skin of a person without AD). As expected, the lesional SCH measures were lower than for non-lesional areas (Table 25). [0177] For TEWL, the higher the measurement, the greater the loss of water from the skin. Median baseline TEWL measures were high (thus, too much water evaporation from the skin) in the lesional areas tested compared to those reported for normal skin. Median lesional measures were higher than those for non-lesional areas. Median non-lesional results for the placebo and 150mg groups were close to reported normal values. [0178] Treatment with mAb1 showed increases in SCH of lesional and non-lesional areas in all dose groups. The results show that there is a trend for SCH improvement of lesional areas with mAb1 treatment compared to placebo at day 29 (Figure 29). Non-lesional areas had better SCH at baseline and the magnitudes of post-treatment changes observed were not as large, in general (Figure 30). [0179] For TEWL, there may be a trend for improvement in the lesional areas, with the exception of the 150mg group (Figure 31 ). A trend for a TEWL improvement was observed with measurements taken from non-lesional skin, however this was mostly observed after day 29, when topical treatments were allowed (Figure 32). Study B [0180] Study B was a phase 2b study to assess safety and efficacy of mAb1 in adults with moderate-to-severe AD. The protocol details are disclosed in Example 9 of US Patent Application Publication No. US20140072583, which is incorporated herein in its entirety. [0181 ] After a loading dose, patients received placebo (PBO) or mAb1 (100 mg q4w, 300 mg q4w, 200 mg q2w, 300 mg q2w or 300 mg qw) for 16 weeks (wks), with an additional 16-wk safety follow-up. The most common TEAEs (PBO vs mAb1 ) were nasopharyngitis (26.2% vs 28%), headache (3.3% vs 10.7%), and injection site reaction (3.3% vs 6.9%). A TEWL and stratum corneum hydration (SCH) sub-study was conducted. At baseline lesional areas, mAb1 significantly reduced TEWL at Wk 4 (-27% ± 4 all mAb1 [n=44] vs +696% ± 645 PBO [n=7], p<0.0001 , mean change ± SE) and improved or maintained TEWL through Wk 16 (-42% ± 5 all mAbl [n=31 ] vs +62.3% ± 33 PBO [n=3], p<0.001 ). There was no consistent difference in SCH between mAbl - and PBO-treated patients. Improvement in TEWL correlated with thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC) suppression (mean % change, Wk 16, Spearman r=0.32, p<0.01 ). Mean % changes in the Th2 biomarkers TARC, periostin, or eosinophils were assessed for correlation with mean % changes in other clinical measures. At Wk 16, the strongest correlations were mean % changes in TARC with clinical outcomes (Pruritus 5D, r=0.45; Patient Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM), r=0.40; body surface area, r=0.39; SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD), r=0.36; Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA), r=0.35; Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI), r=0.33; all p<0.0001 ). These correlations were independent of treatment. IL-4Ra blockade with mAbl may improve both inflammatory and barrier impairments driving AD pathogenesis. Example 4: Staphylococcus aureus Skin Colonization [0182] Skin microbial colonization analysis was conducted on samples taken from subjects who participated in clinical trials of mAbl . In 'Study A', AD subjects were administered either mAbl (75, 150 or 300 mg) or placebo, on days 1 , 8, 15 and 22 of the study (i.e., four weekly doses). Skin swabs were collected and cultured for the presence of S. aureus. The percentage of positive samples collected pre- and post-treatment were evaluated. More than 50% of all baseline samples from lesional skin tested positive for S. aureus colonization (Figure 33). In all treatment groups, the percentage of positive samples decreased after treatment at day 29 (end of treatment; Figure 34). A dose response trend for lower colonization with treatment was observed. Day 85 results were mixed, with continued decrease in the 75mg and placebo groups, and the other two mAbl dose groups increasing (but still below baseline). A similar observation was made for the percentage of positive samples from non-lesional skin, however dose dependency was not observed for the percentage decrease (Figures 35-36). The S. aureus culture results from skin swab samples collected in this study suggest that mAb1 treatment may improve S. aureus skin colonization in AD patients.
