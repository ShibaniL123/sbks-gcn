STATEMENT REGARDING SEQUENCE LISTING The Sequence Listing associated with this application is provided in text format in lieu of a paper copy, and is hereby incorporated by reference into the specification. The name of the text file containing the Sequence Listing is 120220—401USPC_SEQUENCE_LISTING.txt. The text file is 117 KB, was created on May 8, 2014, and is being submitted electronically via EFS-Web. TECHNICAL DOMAIN The invention herein aims at augmenting the muscular mass in man or animals. More precisely, it recommends the use of fibromodulin and lumican—in particular, a fraction of these proteins able to bind myostatin, to develop muscular mass and, notably, to treat pathological conditions associated with a muscular wasting, such as muscular dystrophies, and even non-pathological conditions such as muscular waste linked to aging. PRIOR STATE OF THE ART Neuromuscular diseases include various pathologies that are generally associated with a temporary or permanent loss of muscular strength. This loss of strength is usually accompanied by muscular wasting, also referred to amyotrophy. Among these muscular diseases, myopathies constitute an important group that damage the actual muscular fiber. Among them, progressive muscular dystrophies are characterized in that a decrease in muscular strength with, generally, an atrophy of the muscles, as well as anomalies of the muscular biopsy revealing a change in the tissue. This group notably includes Duchenne muscular dystrophy (or DMD), Becker muscular dystrophy (or DMB) and limb girdle muscular dystrophies. For some of these diseases, associated genetic abnormalities have been identified. Thus, Duchenne or Becker muscular dystrophies are linked to alterations in the gene encoding dystrophin, limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 2A (LGMD 2A or calpainopathy) with alterations in the calpain 3 gene, or sarcoglycanopathies or girdle myopathies of LGMD 2C, LGMD 2D, LGMD 2E, or LGMD 2F type to defects in the genes of γ-, α-, β- and δ-sarcoglycan, respectively (McNally E M, Pytel P, Muscle diseases: the muscular dystrophies. Annu Rev Pathol. 2007; Vol 2:87-109). In these cases, different therapeutic approaches, including gene therapies, are being developed but are difficult to implement. However, and more generally in all cases of muscle wasting, there is a clear need to develop technical solutions to increase the mass and/or muscle volume. Thus, document WO 2005/094 446 identified antibodies directed against a localized epitope between residues 40 and 64 of mature human myostatin that can increase muscle mass. However, this strategy based on the recognition of a myostatin by an antibody is not without its difficulties. There is therefore a need to find alternative solutions. Furthermore, WO 2010/106295 reports that decorin, particularly its N-terminal zinc-binding region, is a solution for increasing muscle mass. Decorin is a protein of the extracellular matrix belonging to the family of SLRP (Small Leucine-Rich Proteoglycan) and, more specifically, to the class I of SLRPs. On the structural level, the SLRP protein have in common the possession of leucine-rich sequences (Leucine-Rich Repeat or LRR), cysteine residues conserved in the N-terminal position, and the presence of at least one side chain of glycosaminoglycan (GAG). Five classes SLRPs have been defined, notably on the basis of the pattern containing the cysteine residues (McEwan et al., Structural correlations in the family of small leucine-rich repeat proteins and proteoglycans. J. of Struct. Biol. 155(2006) 294-305). Although the SLRP family proteins have common characteristics, notably structural, their functional involvement remains totally unpredictable. Thus, it has been shown in document Miura et al. (Decorin binds myostatin and modulates its activity to muscle cells. Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications 340 (2006) 675-680) that biglycan, another SRLP of class I like decorin, as having 57% identity therewith, was not capable of binding to myostatin. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention forms part of the search for new solutions to increase muscle mass. Thus, and surprisingly, the Applicant has shown that fibromodulin and lumican, two SRLPs of class II, were able to perform this function. Furthermore, the Applicant has identified fragments of these proteins able to perform that function. Thus according to a first aspect, the present invention relates to a peptide containing a fragment of fibromodulin or lumican capable of binding myostatin. In the context of the invention, “fibromodulin” is the generic name given to the protein described, for example, by Antonsson, P. et al. (Structure and deduced amino acid sequence of the human fibromodulin gene. Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1174 (2), 204-206 (1993)) ou par Saamanen, A. M., et al. (Murine fibromodulin: cDNA and genomic structure, and age-related expression and distribution in the knee joint. Biochem. J. 355 (PT 3), 577-585 (2001)).

(The human lumican gene. Organization, chromosomal location, and expression in articular cartilage. J. Biol. Chem. 270 (37), 21942-21949 (1995)) ou Ying, S. et al.

More generally and advantageously, the protein will come from the same organism as that in which it will be administered. One of the advantages of the solutions proposed in the context of the present invention is that these are naturally-occurring proteins in mammals, especially humans, and therefore a priori not likely to cause side effects or immune responses. Although these proteins in their natural state have a chain glycosaminoglycan (GAG), a protein devoid of GAG (GAG-) may also be used within the scope of the invention. This can for example be obtained by enzymatic treatment. In the context of the invention, the term peptide or polypeptide means a molecule incorporating less than 100 amino acids or residues or, advantageously, less than 50 or less than 40 amino acids, or even less than 35 or even less than 30 amino acids. According to a first definition, the peptide covered by the invention is characterized in that its ability to bind myostatin. This binding can be assessed by different methods, direct or indirect, known to those skilled in the art: by surface plasmon resonance (Miura et al, 2006.) with a plasmid encoding for a reporter gene such as luciferase and containing sequences called CAGA (plasmid called here p(CACA) 12-Luc) (Dennler S, Itoh S, Vivien D, ten Dijke P, Huet S, Gauthier J M. Direct binding of Smad3 and Smad4 to critical TGF beta-inducible elements in the promoter of human plasminogen activator inhibitor-type 1 gene. Embo J. 1998; 17:3091-100; Kurisaki K, Kurisaki A, Valcourt U, Terentiev A A, Pardali K, Ten Dijke P, et al. Nuclear factor YY1 inhibits transforming growth factor beta-and bone morphogenetic protein-induced cell differentiation. Mol Cell Biol. 2003 23:4494-510); by the execution of an ELISA test (see the examples of implementation below); . . . It is known that these two SLRP proteins are a first subfamily of class II that has, in the N-terminal domain, a cysteine-rich consensus region, sequence CX3CXCX9C (C represents a cysteine residue and X an amino acid; in other words: a cysteine followed by 3 aa followed by a cysteine separated by an aa of another cysteine, itself separated by 9 aa from the last cysteine). Advantageously, and with regard to the fibromodulin, a peptide covered includes the sequence CPQECDCPPNFPTAMYC (SEQ ID NO: 1). In other words, the peptide incorporates a fragment of fibromodulin corresponding to residues 76 to 92 of murine fibromodulin (SEQ ID NO: 6). According to a preferred embodiment, the peptide incorporates or consists of the sequence PPPEPRD CPQECDCPPNFPTAMYC DNRNLKYLP (SEQ ID NO: 2). In other words, the peptide incorporates or is composed of a fragment of fibromodulin corresponding to residues 69-101 of murine fibromodulin (SEQ ID NO: 6). The peptide corresponding to residues 69 to 101 of human fibromodulin (SEQ ID NO: 7) has the sequence SEQ ID NO: 10 following: SPPDPRDCPQECDCPPNFPTAMYCDNRNLKYLP Advantageously, and with regard to the lumican, a peptide covered includes the sequence CAPECNCPHSYPTAMYC (SEQ ID NO): 4) corresponding to residues 37 to 53 of murin lumican (SEQ ID NO: 8) or the CAPECNCPESYPSAMYC sequence (SEQ ID NO: 11) corresponding to residues 37 to 53 of human lumican (SEQ ID NO: 9). According to a preferred implementation, the peptide incorporates or consists of the sequence YGQISPNCAPECNCPHSYPTAMYCDDLKLKSVP (SEQ ID NO: 5) corresponding to residues 30 to 62 of murin lumican (SEQ ID NO: 8) or the sequence YGQSSPNCAPECNCPESYPSAMYC DELKLKSVP (SEQ ID NO: 12) corresponding to residues 30 to 62 of human lumican (SEQ ID NO: 9). The peptides described above are defined by their sequence and their ability to bind myostatin. The remainder of the peptide sequence can correspond to the amino acid juxtaposing the fragment identified in the context of the native protein, in which case the peptide is composed of a fragment of fibromodulin or lumican properly speaking. Alternatively, it may be a heterologous sequence, that is to say one which does not juxtapose the fragment in the native protein (e.g., addition of one or several PBA sequences) or that is not derived from these proteins (e.g. TAG sequences), in which case the peptide is a peptide variant or chimeric peptide. Furthermore, the peptide according to the invention may undergo chemical changes, such as grafting of a biotin (biotinylated), or any other modification that does not impair its properties of binding to myostatin (linking of polyethylene glycol moiety, incorporation of unnatural amino acids, phosphorylation, methylation, etc.). The peptides according to the invention have a large number of applications, particularly including: the detection, purification and/or titration of myostatin, particularly in vitro;combating muscle wasting and, therefore, the treatment of pathologies associated with muscle-wasting;increasing muscle mass. In the context of the invention, the term “muscle mass” could be replaced by either muscle weight or muscle volume. There are a number of conditions in which muscle wasting occurs. They can first of all be pathological conditions, especially in the case of neuromuscular diseases. Muscle wasting is a direct consequence of neuromuscular diseases, and it is then a compensatory approach. In this context, Duchenne muscular dystrophy is a pathology particularly targeted, but all forms of neuromuscular diseases, especially muscular dystrophies, can be treated. In addition, cachexia or marasmus is also a medical condition covered by this invention. This condition is characterized in that extreme thinness, particularly in muscle, caused by a long illness or an inadequate protein or caloric intake. This condition is particularly observed in cases of chronic diseases such as cancer or AIDS, or people suffering from either heart failure—there is a skeletal muscle atrophy in 68% of patients—or urinary incontinence. Without being considered pathological as such, some situations are associated with muscle wasting: aging, prolonged immobilization, etc. There is therefore an advantage in increasing the muscle mass. In addition, particularly in the agro-foods sector, the invention provides the ability to increase the production of animal meat. Use of fibromodulin or lumican, or at least an active fragment of these proteins, is therefore of particular interest in animals. The use of a peptide, instead of the corresponding protein, has certain advantages, particularly in terms of its production but also concerning possible adverse in vivo interference risks. However, for the first time, and unexpectedly, it is shown in the context of the present invention that lumican might also be successfully used in the above applications. Also covered by the present invention are active derivatives (or functional equivalents) of lumican and fragments of fibromodulin or lumican. The activity covered that must have these derivatives concerns the ability to bind myostatin and/or the ability to augment muscle mass, which can be easily evaluated through the use of the tests described in this application or otherwise described in the literature. In practice, the compounds advantageously have a 50% identity with one of the sequences SEQ ID NO: 1 to 2 and 4 to 12, still more preferably 60, 70%, 80%, 90% or 95% identity, and retaining their ability to bind to myostatin. The proteins or peptides of the invention may also be in the form of protein/peptide fusion on chimeric protein/peptide, with another group (protein fragment or whatever) at their terminal N or C extremity. These may, for example—but in a non-limitative manner—increase the residence time of the protein or peptide in the body. Such associations can be obtained either from a recombinant cDNA or by chemical bonding of the two parties. The present invention is thus based on an exogenous supply of at least a fragment of fibromodulin or lumican. Indeed, the composition covered by the invention incorporates either the protein or the peptide as such, or a system of production of the protein or peptide. With regard to the protein, it can be the native protein purified from an organism that naturally produces this protein, or a recombinant protein produced using any of the synthetis systems available and known to an appropriately-knowledgeable professional. A peptide according to the invention can be chemically synthesized or produced from a cellular, acellular or other synthesis system. Alternatively, a nucleic acid sequence encoding for said protein or peptide is placed in an expression system, preferably under the control of a promoter in a vector. After introduction into the body, the protein or peptide is produced in vivo. The transfer of nucleic acids (DNA or RNA) can be achieved either with viral approaches to gene transfer (e.g. adeno-associated viruses or AAVs), or with non-viral approaches (e.g. by a single intramuscular injection of a plasmid). For the protein, a genomic DNA can have an interest since, in some cases, the presence of introns stabilizes the pre-spliced mRNA and improves its stability within the core, and its exportation, which leads to a better protein expression. The proteins and peptides that are advantageous according to the invention can be provided in the form of nucleic acids, notably DNA or RNA, in particular coding for the sequences SEQ ID NO: 1, 2, and 4 to 12, advantageously 1,2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12. According to another preferred form of implementation, the composition covered by the invention also includes zinc, for example, in the form of zinc chloride, at a concentration advantageously between 1 and 50 μM or equal to 15 μM. Such a composition may further contain any acceptable compound or excipient, notably pharmaceutical. The route of administration can be both intramuscular and intravenous, or subcutaneous, intraperitoneal or oral. To facilitate the engraftment of stem cells or precursor cells, it may be advantageous to combine the administration of the composition according to the invention with the transplantation of cells (myoblasts, stem cells, etc.). This administration may be simultaneous or staggered in time. It may also be advantageous to combine a gene therapy for the treatment of a neuromuscular disease, with administration of the composition according to the invention. Thus and according to a preferred implementation, a therapeutic gene is associated with the treatment with the aforesaid composition. The administration of the two treatments may be simultaneous or staggered in time. The advantageous effects of fragments of fibromodulin or lumican identified in the context of the present invention give rise to an increase in muscle volume (or mass or weight). These positive effects can be observed for different skeletal muscles, both in an organism suffering from a pathology of the muscle mass, and in a healthy individual. A priori, no side effects and no immunological reaction is to be feared. Furthermore, the present invention highlights the fact that other proteins of the extracellular matrix of the family of SLRPs, other than the decorin already described, are capable of binding myostatin and having a positive impact on muscle mass. Thus, these proteins and the fragments thereof, which are capable of binding myostatin, also form part of the invention: 1/Class I of SLRPs: A protein and a peptide of class I, incorporating a sequence CX3CXCX6C (SEQ ID NO: 76)(C represents a cysteine residue and X an amino acid; in other words: a cysteine followed by any 3 aa then a cysteine separated by an aa of another cysteine, itself separated from the 6 aa of the last cysteine) and capable of binding myostatin, are covered. Advantageously, it is not decorin or a fragment of decorin. In particular, it can be asporine (murine and human sequences SEQ ID NO: 13 and 14, respectively) or a peptide incorporating the CPFGCQCYSRVVHC (SEQ ID NO: 15) and, more precisely, incorporating or consisting of the sequence PVNPFFPFDLFPT CPFGCQCYSRVVHC SDLGLTSVP (SEQ ID NO: 16) corresponding to 55-90 of the murine asporine or the sequence PRSHFFPFDLFPM CPFGCQCYSRVVHC SDLGLTSVP sequence (SEQ ID NO: 17) corresponding to fragment 62-97 of human asporine.

Apart from fibromodulin and lumican, it can be osteoadherin (murine and human sequences SEQ ID NO: 18 and 19, respectively) or a peptide incorporating the sequence of morin origin CAKECFCPTNFPTSMYC (SEQ ID NO: 20) or the sequence of human origin CVSECFCPTNFPSSMYC (SEQ ID NO: 21) and, more precisely, incorporating or consisting of the sequence YGVPFYNNILGCAKECFCPTNFPTSMYCDNRKLKTIP (SEQ ID NO: 22) corresponding to fragment 51-87 of murine osteoadherin or the sequence YGVPFHQYTLGCVSECFCPTNFPSSMYCDNRKLKTIP (SEQ ID NO: 23) corresponding to fragment 51-87 of human osteoadherin.

EXAMPLES OF IMPLEMENTATION The invention and the resulting advantages will come to the fore clearly in the following implementation examples, with reference to the appended Figures. However, the aforesaid Figures have no limitative scope. The invention is illustrated further on by means of a fragment of fibromodulin or recombinant mouse lumican, tested in vitro for binding to myostatin or intramuscularly injected in mdx mice having a gene encoding an altered dystrophin serving as a model for the study of Duchenne myopathy. CAPITIONS IN THE FIGURES FIG. 1 shows the inhibition of the activity of the myostatin by the murine peptide Fmod 69-101 (SEQ ID NO: 2) in HEK293T cells in vitro in the presence or absence of zinc. FIG. 2 shows the inhibition of the activity of the myostatin by the murine Lumican peptide 30-62 (SEQ ID NO: 5) in HEK293T cells in vitro in the presence or absence of zinc. FIG. 3 shows the in vitro interaction between the peptides Fmod 69-101 (SEQ ID NO: 2) and Fmod 69-101 mutated (SEQ ID NO: 3) and myostatin, in the presence or absence of zinc. I) MATERIALS AND METHODS 1. Expression Cassette pGL3-(CAGA)12-Luc: The plasmidic construction pGL3-(CAGA)12-firefly luciferase (notated pGL3-(CAGA)12-Luc) obtained by MTA of the Pr. Carl-Henrik Heldin (Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Sweden) contains 12 CAGA copies of the consensus SBE (Smad Binding Element) consensus sequence and allows to indirectly measure the binding of myostatin to its receptor. Indeed, when myostatin binds to the receptor Activin IIb, the Smad 3 and 4 proteins are activated and will bind to the 12 CAGA copies. The promoter of the cassette pGL3-(CAGA)12-Luc is thus activated, which results in luciferase production. The myostatin/Activin IIb binding can be followed, therefore, by measuring the luciferase. Accordingly, this test can also be used to demonstrate the ability of a compound (protein or peptide) to prevent binding of myostatin to its receptor. 2. In vitro Study of the Inhibition of Myostatin: The ability of the peptides to inhibit the in vitro activity of the myostatin has been evaluated on embryonic human kidney cells 293T by means of the pGL3-(CAGA)12-Luc construction. For this, 350,000 293T cells were placed per well in a 24-well plate. After 24 hours of culture, the cells were transfected with a mixture of 8 μl de PEI (PEI 25 kDa; Sigma) and 2 μg of plasmide pGL3-(CAGA)12-Luc/well. Note that all the transfection experiments were performed in duplicate. Twenty-four hours after transfection, 2.5 nM of recombinant murine myostatin, mixed or not mixed with various quantities of fibromodulin or lumican peptides were added to each well. Prior incubation of 30 minutes at 37° C. was performed for conditions combining myostatin and the potential inhibitor. This pre-incubation—unless otherwise stated—has always performed in the presence of 15 microM of ZnCl2. Twenty-four hours after incubation, the cells were lysed, then collected to be assayed for luciferase activity and the quantity of protein. The following fibromodulin or lumican peptides were used: for the fibromodulin: (SEQ ID NO: 2) Fmod: PPPEPRDCPQECDCPPNFPTAMYCDNRNLKYLP. for the lumican: (SEQ ID NO: 5) mLumican: YGQISPNCAPECNCPHSYPTAMYCDDLKLKSVP. 3. Highlighting of the MSTN/Fibromodulin Peptides (Fmod) Binding The ELISA test (Enzyme Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay) is a test for detecting and/or assaying a protein present in a biological fluid. In the technique known as “sandwich” assay, the wells of a microtiter plate are covered with a capture antibody capable of binding specifically to the desired antigen. During this operation called “coating”, the capture antibody binds to the plastic of the wells by electrostatic interaction. The capture antibody ensures the specificity of the test. The solution to be tested is then deposited into the wells of the microtiter plate and, if the desired antigen is present, it will bind specifically to the capture antibody. A second antibody, the tracer antibody, capable of binding to the captured antigen is then added to the wells, and the unbound tracer antibodies are eliminated by rinsing. The tracer antibody is coupled to an enzyme catalyzing the formation of a colored product. The principle of this technique was used to study the direct interaction of the mature myostatin with the peptides 69-101 Fmod Biotin and 69-101 Fmod Biotin mutated (see sequences below). For this, 3 μl of myostatin at a concentration of 100 ng/μl are taken up in 50 μl of carbonate buffer and added to each well of the assay plate (R&D Systems DY990). After an overnight incubation at 4° C., the plate is washed with 100 μl of PBS-Tween (0.05% Tween 20), then the blocking step to saturate non-specific sites is carried out for 2 hours at room temperature with 100 μl of PBS and 6% of milk per well. Five successive washes with 200 μl of PBS-Tween (0.05% Tween 20) are performed and increasing amounts of biotinylated fibromodulin peptides are then deposited (100 μl final in PBS) and the plate is incubated for 1 hour at 37° C. For the positive control, an antibody of goat anti-myostatin (≠AF788, R&D Systems), which was deposited in the control wells and incubated for 1 hour at 1/100th (0.1 mg/ml) was unused. The wells were then washed 5 times with PBS-Tween (0.05% Tween 20). To detect binding of the biotinylated peptides to MSTN, streptavidin-HRP (≠N100, Pierce) was used at 1/20,000th. was added to the wells. For the controls points with the goat anti-myostatin antibody, an HRP-marked (≠ab6885, Abcam) polyclonal secondary donkey anti-goat antibody was added (at 1/4000th)). After five washes, adding the peroxidase substrate, the TMB Substrate Reagent Set (Tetramehylbenzidine, OptEIA, ≠555214) allows the obtention of a colored reaction proportional to the quantity of HRP present in the wells. The reaction is stopped after 20 minutes by addition of sulfuric acid 2N, and the plate is read at 450 nm on a Discovery HT-R spectrophotometer (Bio-TEK). Buffer Composition: 0.1 M carbonate buffer: 4.2 g NaHCO3, 1.78 g of Na2CO in 500 ml of H20 MilliQ, pH 9,5. Storage at 4° C. Biotinylated Peptide Sequences: Biotin-peptide 69-101 mFibromodulin (Fmod) (SEQ ID NO: 2) Biotine-PPPEPRDCPQECDCPPNFPTAMYCDNRNLK YLP-CONH2 Peptide Biotine-69-101 mFibromodulin mutated (Fmod mutated) (SEQ ID NO: 3) Biotine-PPPEPRDCPQEADAPPNFPTAMYADNR NLKYLP- CONH2 4. Animal Experimentation: a. Mice Mdx mice (C57BL/10ScSn-DmDmax/J) from colonies maintained at Genethon. Mice aged at least six weeks were used. All experiments were performed in accordance with European ethical rules regarding the use of animals for experimental research. b. Anesthesia The mice were anaesthetized prior to each intramuscular injection and prior to each blood collection by an intraperitoneal injection of a mixture of Ketamine 100 mg/kg and xylazine 1 mg/kg (0.1 mL/10 g). c. Intramuscular Injection Intramuscular injection is performed on animals anesthetized at the tibialis anterior muscle (TA). The injected volume was around 20-35 μl. The injection is performed in the middle of TA Left (TAG). An equal volume of NaCl 150 mM/15 μM ZnCl2 was systematically injected into the right anterior tibialis (TAD) to serve as a control. After a specified number of days after the injection, the TAD and TAG were taken after sacrificing the mice, which were weighed and frozen for histological studies. d. Preparation of the Peptide Solution The peptide fibromodulin (Fmod, SEQ ID NO: 2) and lumican (mLumican, SEQ ID NO: 5) were dissolved in water and stored at −80° C. For the injections, the preparation procedure is as follows: 24-40 hours before the injection, the desired quantity of peptide is removed from the stock solution and mixed with a solution of zinc chloride (ZnCl2) and 150 mM NaCl so as to have a final concentration of 15 μM of zinc. The peptide was stored at 4° C. until injection. e. Histological Analyses Laminine Marking: Cryostat sections (8 microns) of the treated muscles and the controls were carried out according to standard techniques. The slides were fixed with Dakopen (DAKO®, Ref.: S 2002) for 10 minutes in the open air and then blocked with a solution of PBS/10% goat serum for 30 min at room temperature and in a humid chamber. The rabbit anti-laminin antibody (DAKO®, Ref: Z0097) was applied to the slides at a dilution of 1:1000 for 12 hours in a humid chamber. The slides were then rinsed in PBS (5 minutes) with stirring and the secondary antibody (Envision HRP Kit Rabbit) was applied to the slides in a humid chamber for 30 mins at room temperature. After rinsing the slides in PBS (5 minutes) under agitation, DAB (DAKO®, Ref: K 3466) was applied to the sections for 2-5 minutes at room temperature and in a humid chamber. The slides were rinsed in constant renewal and were mounted under the fume hood. Analysis of the results was performed using the ELLIX software. HPS Marking: Cryostat sections (8 μm) of the treated muscles and the controls were prepared according to the standard techniques. The slides were dipped in Harris hematoxylin for 3 minutes before being rinsed with running water. They were then soaked in hydrochloric alcohol, rinsed, and immersed in Scott water for one minute. After rinsing, the slides were immersed in Phloxine for 30 seconds, rinsed with running water, and soaked in absolute ethanol for one minute. After exposure to Safran for 3 minutes, they were rinsed with absolute ethanol and mounted with Eukitt resin, of which the solvent is Xylene. Analysis of the results was performed using the CARTOGRAPH software. II) Results 1/Inhibition of Myostatin Activity by the Peptides Fmod 69-101 (SEQ ID NO: 2) and mLum 30-62 (SEQ ID NO: 5) in HEK293T Cells in vitro: The induction of the pCAGA-Luc promoter was measured as per the instructions for the equipment and methods, and is shown in FIGS. 1 and 2. A net inhibition of the promoter in a dose-dependent manner is observed both with the peptide mFmod 69-101 (FIG. 1), with the peptide mLumican 30-62 (FIG. 2). 2/In vitro Study of the Interaction Between the Myostatin and the Fibromodulin Peptides: As shown in FIG. 3, the greater the amount of peptide Fmod 69-101 (SEQ ID NO: 2), the higher the absorbence. This indicates that a direct interaction takes place between the biotinylated mFmod 69-101 peptide and the myostatin. There is a plateau is obtained as from 4.2 μg of mFmod 69-101 peptide. In contrast, no interaction is seen between the peptide mFmod 69-101 and the myostatin in the absence of zinc. The mFmod 69-101 interaction with the myostatin is therefore zinc-dependent. Furthermore, no interaction is visible between the mutated biotin mFmod peptide (SEQ ID NO: 3) and the myostatin, even in the presence of zinc, which shows the importance of the three cysteines mutated to alanine. 3/In vivo Study: Body Mass and Weight of Muscles and Mice on D20 after Injection into the mdx Mice: A first series of experiments was carried out on 5 mdx mice, injected by the IM path in the Tibialis Anterior (TA) with the following formulations: TAG: 50 μg peptide mFmod 69-101 (SEQ ID NO: 2)+15 μM ZnCl2 in 25 μl of NaCl; TAD: 15 μM ZnCl2+25 μl NaCl. On D20, the mice were sacrificed and the weight of the TAG and TAD muscles was measured. The results are shown in the following table: Mouse Muscles Weight (in mg) Growth Mouse 1 TAD 1 71.6 5.31% TAG 1 75.4 Mouse 2 TAD 2 62.2 19.94% TAG 2 74.6 Mouse 3 TAD 3 61.9 5.33% TAG 3 65.2 Mouse 4 TAD 4 65.8 12.31% TAG 4 73.9 Mouse 5 TAG 5 54.4 22.24% TAG 5 66.5 These results show an effect on muscle growth. 4/In vivo Comparative Study of Muscle Hypertrophy 18 Days after Injection of Dystrophic mdx Mice with Decorin Peptide (MdCN 31-71, SEQ ID NO: 75), Fibromodulin (mFmod 69-101) or lumican (mLum 30-62): The TAD and TAG muscles were removed 18 days after injection of the peptides, and then weighed. The experiment was performed on five separate mice. The average results obtained are shown in the following table: Treatment Hypertrophy % mDCN 31-71 (SEQ ID NO: 75) 10.02 ± 8.3 mFmod 69-101 (SEQ ID NO: 2) 29.34 ± 15.76 mLum 30-62 (SEQ ID NO: 5) 37.26 ± 14.69 The difference in muscle mass on day 18 between an mdx mouse having or not having received an intramuscular injection of decorin, fibromodulin or lumican indicates a significant effect for treatments based on peptide mFmod 69-101 and mLumican 30-62.
