Compound 26A (3.00 g, 18.38 mmol) was dissolved in 50 ml of dichloromethane, BBr3 (13.81 g, 55.14 mmol) was added at 0 °C, and then stirred at 15 °C for 2 hours. The reaction solution was concentrated and the reaction was quenched by 5 ml of methanol. Saturated sodium bicarbonate solution (20 ml) was added and stirred for 30 min, then extracted with 20 ml of ethyl acetate three times. The organic phases were combined and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and concentrated to give a crude product. The crude product was purified by silica gel column chromatography (petroleum ether/ethyl acetate was from 3:1 to 1:1) to give compound 26B (1.95 g, the yield was 71.11%).
