FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to game playing apparatus and methods. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Game playing may be based on skill and/or based on chance. In games of chance, a player places a wager on one or more games and may receive a payout based on the outcome of the game and/or the wager. Games of chance may occur through various devices or may be conducted without a device. Examples of devices for games of chance include without limitation video poker, video black jack, mechanical slot machines and video slot machines. Typically, payout from games of chance is in the form of bills, coins, tokens or vouchers printed on paper tickets. Such vouchers (also known as “cashless gaming tickets”) include indicia such as a bar code, and the bar code indicates, among other things, the value of the payout (e.g., $10). The voucher may be inserted into a gaming device and the gaming device reads the bar code. Thus the voucher may be used to place one or more wagers. Such vouchers may also be redeemed for cash by exchanging the voucher at, e.g., a cashier's window. Payout from skill-based games may also be made in a variety of forms known in the art.

Referring to FIG. 10, a flow chart 1000 represents an embodiment of the present invention that may be performed by a gaming device, including without limitation a slot machine. The particular arrangement of elements in the flow chart of FIG. 10, as well as the other flow charts discussed herein, is not meant to imply a fixed order to the steps; the steps can be practiced in any order that is practicable in various embodiments of the present invention. The gaming device permits a player to play a game at the gaming device, in a manner well known in the art (step 1010). Using an example of a player playing at a slot machine, the player typically inserts a monetary amount (e.g., coins, bills, tokens, chips, credit card, cashless gaming ticket), indicates a wager amount (e.g., by pressing buttons), and initiates play (e.g., by pulling a handle or pressing a button). The gaming device prints a ticket that may have various indicia thereon (step 1012). The ticket may be printed in response to a player request to receive some or all of his balance of funds. (e.g., when the player presses a “cashout” button on the gaming device). In various embodiments the ticket may be printed before the player requests to receive some or all of his balance of funds. In various embodiments, the ticket need not be printed by the gaming device at all. The ticket may instead be printed by another device, which may or may not be in communication with the gaming device. The gaming device provides the player with the ticket as a payout for the game (step 1014). The gaming device typically ejects or feeds the ticket through a slot or other opening in a manner known in the art, making the ticket available to the player FIG. 11 depicts an illustration of a ticket 1100. The depicted ticket 1100 is merely one example provided in accordance with one embodiment of the invention, and various other types and forms of ticket are within the scope of the invention. The ticket 1100 includes indicia 1102, 1104 and 1106 that indicate a plurality of values, each with a corresponding form of payout. Any number of such indicia may be included on the ticket. The indicia 1102 indicates a first value ($13) in the form of cash, and the indicia 1104 indicates a second value ($20) in the form of a coupon for a merchant AMAZON.COM™ The indicia 1106 indicates a third value ($18) for use in a subsequent play of the game (or, e.g., another game at the same casino). The ticket 1100 also includes indicia 1110 in the form of a bar code. The generation, printing and form of bar codes are well known in the art. The bar code can uniquely represent any information desired, such as the plurality of values and corresponding forms of payout denoted by the ticket. The bar code could additionally or alternatively represent other information, such as a unique player identifier, the time of the payout, and/or an identifier that uniquely identifies the gaming device. Information represented by a bar code need not be visible on the ticket or otherwise discernible to the player or anyone viewing the ticket. FIG. 12 depicts an illustration of another ticket 1200. The depicted ticket 1200 is merely one example provided in accordance with one embodiment of the invention, and various other types and forms of ticket are within the scope of the invention. The ticket 1200 includes indicia 1210 and 1220 that indicate a plurality of values, each with a corresponding a form of payout. Any number of such indicia may be included on the ticket. The indicia 1210 indicates a first value ($25) in the form of cash, and the indicia 1120 indicates a second value ($35) in the form of a credit on a hotel bill. This form of payment includes a restriction that the value can only be acquired at a certain time (i.e. when the player checks out of the hotel). As described herein, many types of restrictions may be applied, and many others will be readily apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art. The indicia 1225 indicates the name of the player. Players may be identified by the gaming device, typically by the player's use of a player tracking card. This information permits the ticket and the associated payout to be customized to the player, as described herein. The ticket 1200 also includes indicia 1230 in the form of a bar code. Which may represent, e.g., the plurality of values and corresponding forms of payout denoted by the ticket. Referring to FIG. 13, a flow chart 1300 represents an embodiment of the present invention that may be performed by a gaming device, including without limitation a slot machine. The particular arrangement of elements in the flow chart of FIG. 13, as well as the other flow charts discussed herein, is not meant to imply a fixed order to the steps; the steps can be practiced in any order that is practicable in various embodiments of the present invention. The gaming device receives a player tracking card from a player (step 1310) and reads information from the player tracking card in a manner known in the art. Typically, the player tracking card stores a unique player identifier, which is in turn used to access information (e.g., from a record of a database indexed by the player identifier) from the server. The information may be, for example, an entry of the player database. After one or more plays of the gaming device, the gaming device receives a request to cash out from the player (step 1320). The gaming device records the amount of the player's winnings (e.g., the balance of the gaming device) and associates that amount with the player's account identifier (step 1330). For example, the appropriate entry of the player database may include a field that stores a financial account identifier, indicating a bank account, a credit card account or account with the casino. The financial account may be updated (e.g., an amount of funds transferred to the account in accordance with the player winnings. The appropriate entry of the player database may alternatively or additionally include a field that stores the balance, or updates an amount of aggregate balances the player has won. Alternatively, the gaming device can record the amount of the player's winnings and associate that amount with a newly created account identifier. Then the account identifier would be associated with the player (step 1340), typically by storing the account identifier in the appropriate entry of the player database, or by otherwise associating the account identifier with the player identifier of the player tracking card. The gaming device requests a PIN (personal identification number) code from the player (step 1350), typically by displaying appropriate instructions as a textual message and/or an image. The gaming device receives the PIN code (step 1360) entered by the player on, e.g., a touch screen. The gaming device communicates with the server to associate the PIN code with the player (step 1370), typically by storing the PIN code in the appropriate entry of the player database. The PIN code may also constitute the player identifier, and thus may be used to identify the player even if the player does not have or does not use a player tracking card. The server or gaming device then determines payment options (such as values and corresponding forms of payout), and associates those with the player (step 1380), typically by storing data indicating the values and corresponding forms of payout in the appropriate entry of the player database. If the server is responsible for storing the player database and updating the entries as described, the server then transmits the appropriate information to the gaming device (step 1390), which may use some or all of the information for printing on a ticket. Referring to FIG. 14, a flow chart 1400 represents an embodiment of the present invention that may be performed by a gaming device, including without limitation a slot machine. The particular arrangement of elements in the flow chart of FIG. 14, as well as the other flow charts discussed herein, is not meant to imply a fixed order to the steps; the steps can be practiced in any order that is practicable in various embodiments of the present invention. The gaming device transmits a balance of the player to the server (step 1410). In one embodiment, upon cash out the server determines a plurality of values and corresponding forms of payout to provide to the player (step 1420). The gaming device may instead perform all of the described functions of the server. The slot server translates the balance into a plurality of values, each corresponding to a form of payout. In one embodiment each value is based on the balance. However, in other embodiments, not all values are based on the balance. The gaming device prints or otherwise creates a ticket that represents the plurality of values (step 1430). The ticket may be subsequently redeemed by the player for one or more of the plurality of values (step 1440), according to the corresponding forms of payout and any restrictions that may apply to the forms of payment. Referring to FIG. 15, a flow chart 1500 represents an embodiment of the present invention that may be performed by a merchant terminal. The particular arrangement of elements in the flow chart of FIG. 15, as well as the other flow charts discussed herein, is not meant to imply a fixed order to the steps; the steps can be practiced in any order that is practicable in various embodiments of the present invention. The merchant terminal receives from the server an indication that a player will purchase a product of the merchant (steps 1510 and 1520). The indication will may be, for example, data representing a bar code and associated value of a merchandise credit with the merchant (e.g., $20 off the purchase price). The player arrives at the merchant and presents a ticket (step 1530). The ticket may include a bar code, which can be easily read by the merchant terminal with a bar code reader in a manner well known in the art. The bar code and/or the data the bar code represents can be stored into a database of the merchant terminal (step 1540) to indicate, e.g., that the player has redeemed the merchandise credit with a purchase. The merchant terminal deducts the value of the merchandise credit from the price to be paid. The merchant terminal may alternatively reduce the stored value of the player's account (step 1550) by the amount of the purchase, in an embodiment where the player has an account with a balance that may be used for purchases from the merchant. The player has accordingly received the product from the merchant at a discount (step 1560). Referring to FIG. 16, a flow chart 1600 represents an embodiment of the present invention that may be performed by the server. The particular arrangement of elements in the flow chart of FIG. 16, as well as the other flow charts discussed herein, is not meant to imply a fixed order to the steps; the steps can be practiced in any order that is practicable in various embodiments of the present invention. A gaming device, including without limitation a slot machine, transmits to the server the player's balance with the gaming device (step 1610). The server determines a plurality of values and corresponding forms of payout to provide to the player or offer to the player (step 1620). The values may each be based on the balance, but in various embodiments not all of the values are based on the balance. For example, one value and corresponding form of payout may always be a $10 reduction in the player's hotel bill or a $15 credit with a hotel restaurant. The server provides the player (e.g., via the gaming device) with offers from one or more merchants (step 1630). Each offer corresponds to a value and corresponding form of payout described above. The details of the offers (e.g., values, restrictions on redemption) may be received from the merchants periodically (e.g., every week) or may be received in real time (e.g., when the player requests to cash out). The player selects one or more of the merchant offers (step 1640), typically by pressing portions of a touch screen overlaid on a monitor that displays buttons on those portions. The gaming device transmits the player selection(s) to the server (step 1650), and the server stores the selected value(s) and form(s) of payout in the entry of the player database that corresponds to the player. In some embodiments, the payout the player receives may be redeemed for one of a plurality of values, and thus one corresponding form of payout. Typically, one of the forms of payout is cash, which is typically redeemed at a cashier's window in a casino. Other forms of payout include a coupon for a merchant, a merchandise credit such as a credit with a casino shop or a third party, a credit card (which may have a certain credit balance pre-established), a one-time use credit card, a prepaid phone card redeemable for phone time, a credit to play the game (or a different game, or any game in the casino) again, frequent flyer miles, a credit to a bill, a particular product purchase from a merchant, a credit on a hotel bill and a right to purchase a product at a certain price. Typically, at least two of the plurality of values are different from each other. For example, no two values of a plurality of values may be alike. However in other embodiments two or more values may be equal. Similarly, in some embodiments at least two of the forms of payout are different from each other. In addition, two forms of payout may be the same but may have different restrictions on redemption or usage. For example, one may be a $20 reduction in the player's hotel bill if redeemed at checkout, while the other is a $10 reduction in the player's hotel bill if redeemed any other time. Selection of the values and/or forms of payment may be made in a variety of manners. In one embodiment the server determines the values and forms of payout. Such determination may be based on various criteria, such as player characteristics, preferences of merchants, and revenue management requirements of the casino and merchants. In another embodiment the determination may be made by a human. For example, the player may select (e.g., via touch screen at the gaming device) what merchants where he is interested in redeeming the payout. Similarly, a casino may use a waitress or designated payment offer host to present payout offers to a player. For example, a player may be playing at a blackjack table and indicate to the blackjack dealer that he is planning on ending his play in 10 minutes. The black jack dealer may then send an indication to a central computer or Offer Host that a player may be interested in receiving payout offers. At that point, a waitress or payment offer host may come to the blackjack table and present the player with multiple payment offers. It may be noted that increased value can come from the physical and emotional connection that the waitress or offer host can make with the player. For example, the waitress or offer host may ask the player what kinds of payment offers he would like to receive. In another example, the waitress or offer host may present the player with predetermined payment offers. The waitress or offer host may enter the selected form of payment to the server directly or indirectly. Additional Embodiments The following are several examples which illustrate additional embodiments of the present invention. These examples do not constitute a definition of all possible embodiments, and those skilled in the art will understand that the present invention is applicable to many other embodiments. Further, although the following examples are briefly described for clarity, those skilled in the art will understand how to make any changes, if necessary, to the above-described apparatus and methods to accommodate these and other embodiments and applications. The gaming device may perform some or all of the described functions of the server. Similarly, the server may perform some or all of the described functions of the gaming device. Payouts need not be made in the form of ticket. For example, the payout can comprise a data signal that represents the payout. Such a data signal could be transmitted to a player's handheld device (e.g., FDA, cell phone) wirelessly (e.g., radio frequency, infrared) or in another manner (e.g., via physical connection between the player device and the gaming device). Such data could represent the information that represent, e.g., a plurality of values and corresponding forms of payout denoted by the payout. The data could represent anything represented by the bar code, as well as additional information. The data may be encrypted to prevent tampering by the player. Similarly, the payout can comprise a data signal that represents the payout. Such a data signal could be transmitted to the server, where an account could store the players value(s) and forms of payment. The player could redeem the values and the account would be adjusted in accordance with any value redeemed. In one embodiment, the player may be offered the ability to purchase products (e.g., casino products, third party products) with a portion of his winnings. For example, a player may have a balance of $237 and may round down his winnings to $200 in order to purchase a product for the $37 difference. In other words, the offer can be an offer to reduce a value of the payout in exchange for purchasing a product, where the reduced payout is the payout rounded to a predetermined multiple. In one embodiment, the player may be offered to increase his payout in exchange for the player agreeing to perform a specified action. For example, a player may have a winning balance of $85. A casino may round the players $85 up to $100 if the player agrees to come back the next day and play for a certain amount of time. In other words, the offer can be an offer to increase the payout by rounding the payout up to a predetermined multiple. In one embodiment, the form of payout can be that the player receives an increased payout over time (e.g., 10% every day for 10 days). Although the present invention has been described with respect to a preferred embodiment thereof, those skilled in the art will note that various substitutions may be made to those embodiments described herein without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. 1.
