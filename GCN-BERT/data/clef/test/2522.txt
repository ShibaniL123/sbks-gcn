FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to novel azabenzimidazole derivatives that are agonists of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), to processes for their preparation, to pharmaceutical compositions containing these compounds and to their medical use for the prophylaxis and/or treatment of diseases which can be influenced by the modulation of the function of AMPK. Particularly, the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention are suitable for the prophylaxis and/or therapy of metabolic diseases, such as diabetes, more specifically type 2 diabetes mellitus, and conditions associated with the disease, including insulin resistance, obesity, cardiovascular disease and dyslipidemia. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Metabolic diseases are diseases caused by an abnormal metabolic process and may either be congenital due to an inherited enzyme abnormality or acquired due to a disease of an endocrine organ or failure of a metabolically important organ such as the liver or the pancreas. Diabetes mellitus is a disease state or process derived from multiple causative factors and is defined as a chronic hyperglycemia associated with resulting damages to organs and dysfunctions of metabolic processes. Depending on its etiology, one differentiates between several forms of diabetes, which are either due to an absolute (lacking or decreased insulin secretion) or to a relative lack of insulin. Diabetes mellitus Type I (IDDM, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus) generally occurs in adolescents under 20 years of age. It is assumed to be of auto-immune etiology, leading to an insulitis with the subsequent destruction of the beta cells of the islets of Langerhans which are responsible for the insulin synthesis. In addition, in latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA; Diabetes Care. 8: 1460-1467, 2001) beta cells are being destroyed due to autoimmune attack. The amount of insulin produced by the remaining pancreatic islet cells is too low, resulting in elevated blood glucose levels (hyperglycemia). Diabetes mellitus Type II generally occurs at an older age. It is above all associated with a resistance to insulin in the liver and the skeletal muscles, but also with a defect of the islets of Langerhans. High blood glucose levels (and also high blood lipid levels) in turn lead to an impairment of beta cell function and to an increase in beta cell apoptosis. Persistent or inadequately controlled hyperglycemia is associated with a wide range of pathologies. Diabetes is a very disabling disease, because today's common antidiabetic drugs do not control blood sugar levels well enough to completely prevent the occurrence of high and low blood sugar levels. Out of range blood sugar levels are toxic and cause long-term complications for example retinopathy, renopathy, neuropathy and peripheral vascular disease. There is also a host of related conditions, such as obesity, hypertension, stroke, heart disease and hyperlipidemia, for which persons with diabetes are substantially at risk. Obesity is associated with an increased risk of follow-up diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia and an increased mortality. Diabetes (insulin resistance) and obesity are part of the “metabolic syndrome” which is defined as the linkage between several diseases (also referred to as syndrome X, insulin-resistance syndrome, or deadly quartet). These often occur in the same patients and are major risk factors for development of diabetes type II and cardiovascular disease. It has been suggested that the control of lipid levels and glucose levels is required to treat diabetes type II, heart disease, and other occurrences of metabolic syndrome (see e.g., Diabetes 48: 1836-1841, 1999; JAMA 288: 2209-2716, 2002). Sensing and regulating cellular the energy status in response to environmental and/or nutritional stress is highly important and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a major contributor for this task (Hardie et al. (2001) Bioessays 23: 1112; Kemp et al. (2003) Biochem. Soc. Transactions 31: 162). Cellular energy depletion leads to the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) thereby inhibiting ATP consuming and upregulating ATP generating pathways. On a cellular level several substrates are regulated by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) such as acetyl-CoA-carboxylase (ACC) and HMG-CoA-reductase (Carling et al. (1987) FEBS Letters 223: 217), hormone-sensitive lipase (Garton et al. (1989) Eur. J. Biochem. 179: 249), malonyl-CoA-decarboxylase (Saha et al. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275: 24279) and glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (Muoio et al. (1999) Biochem. J. 338: 783). AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) mediated phosphorylation of ACC leads to inhibition of ACC, which then results in a decrease of fatty acid synthesis while fatty acid oxidation is increased. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) mediated phosphorylation and inhibition of HMG-CoA-reductase leads to a decrease in cholesterol synthesis. Triacylglycerol synthesis and fatty acid oxidation is regulated by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) via glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase. In addition AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) stimulates glucose transport in skeletal muscle and regulates the expression of genes involved in fatty acid and glucose metabolism (Hardie et al. (2001) Bioessays 23: 1112; Kemp et al. (2003) Biochem. Soc. Transactions 31: 162). Glucose homeostasis is mediated in liver and muscle by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), wherein activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) leads to an increase in GLUT 4-dependent glucose uptake (Sakamoto et al. (2008) Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 295: E29-E37; Karagounis et al. (2009) Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 41: 2360-2363; Pehmøller et al. (2009) Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 297: E665-E675). Besides energy regulation on a cellular level AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) also regulates whole body energy metabolism. Independently of the cellular AMP level AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) can be activated by the adipocyte derived hormones leptin (Minokoski et al. (2002) Nature 415: 339) and adiponectin (Yamauchi et al. (2002) Nature Medicine 8: 1288). From the points discussed above activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in vivo is expected to result in hepatic stimulation of fatty acid oxidation; inhibition of cholesterol synthesis, lipogenesis and triglyceride synthesis; stimulation of skeletal muscle fatty acid oxidation and glucose uptake; improved insulin action; increase in energy expenditure and hence a decrease body weight.

The cis/trans mixtures may be resolved, for example, by chromatography into the cis and trans isomers thereof. The compounds of general formula I which occur as racemates may be separated by methods known per se into their optical antipodes and diastereomeric mixtures of compounds of general formula I may be resolved into their diastereomers by taking advantage of their different physico-chemical properties using methods known per se, e.g. chromatography and/or fractional crystallization; if the compounds obtained thereafter are racemates, they may be resolved into the enantiomers as mentioned below.

Metabolic Stability The metabolic degradation of the test compound is assayed at 37° C. with pooled human liver microsomes. The final incubation volume of 100 μl per time point contains TRIS buffer pH 7.6 at room temperature (0.1 M), magnesium chloride (5 mM), microsomal protein (1 mg/ml) and the test compound at a final concentration of 1 μM. Following a short preincubation period at 37° C., the reactions were initiated by addition of beta-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, reduced form (NADPH, 1 mM) and terminated by transferring an aliquot into solvent after different time points. Additionally, the NADPH-independent degradation was monitored in incubations without NADPH, terminated at 2 hour time point. The [%] remaining test compound after NADPH independent incubation is reflected by the parameter c (control) (metabolic stability). A c (control) (metabolic stability) value around 100% excludes cofactor independent activities (e.g. from esterases). The quenched incubations are pelleted by centrifugation (10000 g, 5 min). An aliquot of the supernatant is assayed by LC-MS/MS for the amount of parent compound. The half-life (t1/2 INVITRO) is determined by the slope of the semilogarithmic plot of the concentration-time profile.

The gene encoding AMPK alpha1 was cloned into the pACG2T vector (BD Biosciences) to obtain a N-terminal Glutathion S transferase (GST)-fusion protein. The genes encoding AMPK beta1 and gamma1 were cloned into the p2Bac dual multiple cloning site vector (Invitrogen) with beta1 under the control of the p10 promoter and gamma1 under the control of the PH promoter. The transfer vectors containing AMPK were co-transfected individually with AcPNV BacMagic-3 DNA (EMD Millipore) in Sf9 cells and the recombinant baculoviruses were harvested after 5 days, followed by 3 rounds of amplification of the virus stock in Sf9 cells. AMPK (alpha1beta1gamma1) was expressed in High Five 5 cells by co-infection of recombinant alpha1 virus and recombinant beta1/gamma1 virus for 72 h at 27° C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and lysed by 3 freeze/thaw cycles in PBS with 10% glycerol and protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). After centrifugation AMPK a1b1g1 in the supernatant was captured by immobilized glutathione (GE Healthcare), impurities were washed away with PBS and AMPK alpha1beta1gamma1 was eluted with PBS containing 20 mM reduced gluthathione. The protein buffer was then exchanged to PBS with 10% glycerol and protein concentration was determined by UV absorbance. The white 384-well Optiplates (cat. no. 6007299) were purchased from PerkinElmer. The V9101 ADP-Glo Kinase Assay and ultra pure ATP (V915A) was purchased from Promega. The substrate for AMPK (NH2-HMRSAMSGLHLVKRR_CONH2) was purchased from Upstate (12-355). All other materials were of highest grade commercially available. Compounds were tested in either serial dilutions or single dose concentrations. The serial compound dilutions were prepared in 100% DMSO automatically. The final DMSO concentration in the assay was 0.1%. The Compound Stock Solutions were 10 mM in 100% DMSO. The compounds were solubilised at room temperature. In the 384-well plates 1.25 ul of test compound in assay buffer was mixed with 1.25 ul of AMPK and 1.25 μl of the peptide (final concentration of 1 μM) and 1.25 μl of ATP (final concentration of 30 μM), both dissolved in assay buffer. This step was followed by an incubation time of 60 min. Then 5 μl of ADP Glo Reagent was added. This was followed by 40 min of incubation. Then 10 μl of Kinase Detection Reagent was admixed. The plates were sealed and after an incubation period of 30 min, the luminescence signal was measured in an Envision reader. All incubation steps were accomplished at room temperature. Assay buffer: 20 mM HEPES pH 7.0, 0.025% BSA, 15 mM MgCl2, 0.01% Brij Each assay microtiter plate contained wells with vehicle controls instead of compound (0.1% DMSO in water) as reference for the low signal (100% CTL, low signal), and wells with serial dilutions of AMP (final 30 μM) as reference for high signals. The luminescence signal generated was proportional to the ADP concentration produced and was correlated with AMPK activity. The analysis of the data was performed by the calculation of the percentage of ATP consumption of AMPK in the presence of the test compound compared to the consumption of ATP in the presence of AMPK without compound. [in-line-formulae](RLU(sample)/RLU(low control))*100[RLU=relative luminescence units][/in-line-formulae] An activator of the AMPK enzyme gave values above 100% CTL.
