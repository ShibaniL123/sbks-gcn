The invention also relates to methods for preparing the contrast agents. 2. Description of the Related Art When a substance such as human tissue is subjected to a uniform magnetic field (polarizing field B0), the individual magnetic moments of the excited nuclei in the tissue attempt to align with this polarizing field, but precess about it in random order at their characteristic Larmor frequency. If the substance, or tissue, is subjected to a magnetic field (excitation field B1) that is in the x-y plane and that is near the Larmor frequency, the net aligned moment, Mz, may be rotated, or “tipped”, into the x-y plane to produce a net transverse magnetic moment Mt. A signal is emitted by the excited nuclei or “spins”, after the excitation signal B1 is terminated, and this signal may be received and processed to form an image. In magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) systems, the excited spins induce an oscillating sine wave signal in a receiving coil. The frequency of this signal is near the Larmor frequency, and its initial amplitude, is determined by the magnitude of the transverse magnetic moment Mt. The amplitude, A, of the emitted NMR signal decays in an exponential fashion with time, t. The decay constant 1/T*2 depends on the homogeneity of the magnetic field and on T2, which is referred to as the “spin-spin relaxation” constant, or the “transverse relaxation” constant. The T2 constant is inversely proportional to the exponential rate at which the aligned precession of the spins would dephase after removal of the excitation signal B1 in a perfectly homogeneous field. The practical value of the T2 constant is that tissues have different T2 values and this can be exploited as a means of enhancing the contrast between such tissues. Another important factor that contributes to the amplitude A of the NMR signal is referred to as the spin-lattice relaxation process that is characterized by the time constant T1. It describes the recovery of the net magnetic moment M to its equilibrium value along the axis of magnetic polarization (z). T2 relaxation is associated with a decrease in spin coherence, and T1 relaxation occurs due to a paramagnetic shift at the probe site and subsequent exchange of bound protons with the surrounding bulk water. The T1 time constant, which is referred to as the “spin-lattice relaxation” constant or the “longitudinal relaxation” constant, is longer than T2, much longer in most substances of medical interest. As with the T2 constant, the difference in T1 between tissues can be exploited to provide image contrast. The reciprocals of these relaxation time constants are termed relaxation rates and denoted R1 and R2 where R1=1/T1 and R2=1/T2. Contrast agents are exogenous molecules or materials that can alter the relaxation properties of tissue and induce image contrast. Contrast agents are typically paramagnetic, superparamagnetic, or ferromagnetic materials. Contrast agents are also sometimes referred to as imaging probes. The extent to which a given contrast agent can alter the relaxation rate is termed relaxivity. Relaxivity is defined as the difference in the relaxation rate of a sample measured with and without the contrast agent. This relaxation rate difference is then normalized to the concentration of the contrast agent. Relaxivity is expressed as a lowercase “r” with a subscript “1” or “2” which refers to either the longitudinal or transverse relaxivity respectively. For instance longitudinal relaxivity, r1, is defined as r1=)(R1−R10)/C where R1 is the relaxation rate in s−1 measured in the presence of the contrast agent, R10 is the relaxation rate in s−1 measured in the absence of contrast agent, and C is the concentration in mM of the contrast agent. Relaxivity has units of mM−1 s−1. For contrast agents that contain more than one metal ion, relaxivity can be expressed in terms of the metal ion concentration (‘per ion’ or ‘ionic relaxivity’) or in terms of the molecular concentration (‘per molecule’ or ‘molecular relaxivity’). Relaxivity is an inherent property of contrast agents. In an effort to elicit clinically-desired contrasts, MRI contrast agents have been developed that are designed to affect the relaxation periods. Not surprisingly, there are contrast agents that are used clinically to adjust T1 contrast and those that are used clinically to adjust T2 contrast. T1-weighted (T1w) imaging provides image contrast where tissues or regions of the image are bright (increased signal intensity) when the T1 of water in that region is short. One way to increase image contrast is to administer a paramagnetic complex or material based on gadolinium (Gd), manganese (Mn), or iron. This paramagnetic contrast agent shortens the T1 of water molecules that it encounters and results in positive image contrast. The degree to which a given concentration of contrast agent can change T1 is the relaxivity as noted above. Compounds that have higher relaxivity provide greater T1w signal enhancement than compounds with low relaxivity; alternatively a high relaxivity compound can provide equivalent signal enhancement to a low relaxivity compound but at a lower concentration than the low relaxivity compound. Thus, high relaxivity compounds are desirable because they enable greater enhancement of lesions and improve diagnostic confidence; alternately, they can be used at lower doses and thus improve the safety margin of the contrast agent. The majority of magnetic resonance contrast agents in clinical use employ the gadolinium ion in the +3 oxidation state. The manganese ion in the +2 oxidation state can also serve as a T1 relaxation agent. Mangafodipir (sold under the brand name Teslascan as mangafodipir trisodium) is a contrast agent delivered intravenously to enhance contrast in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the liver. It includes paramagnetic manganese (II) ions and the chelating agent fodipir (dipyridoxyl diphosphate). The manganese shortens the longitudinal relaxation time (T1), making the normal tissue appear brighter in a magnetic resonance image. Mn-based agents having relaxivities as high as Gd-based contrast agents have also been described (see, e.g., Inorg Chem 43:6313-23, 2004). One disadvantage of gadolinium magnetic resonance contrast agents is that the gadolinium ion is only stable in the +3 oxidation state under physiological conditions. Additionally, there is well-established connection between the usage gadolinium based contrast agents in renally impaired patients and a rare but serious fibrotic disorder termed nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF), Further advancement of manganese based magnetic resonance contrast agents would be of tremendous utility in contrast enhanced applications. Manganese can assess numerous oxidation states under physiological conditions, with the +2 oxidation state best suited for T1 and T2 contrast. This can be useful in the non-invasive study of tissue redox dynamics. Manganese based contrast agents could also represent a viable alternative to gadolinium in patient groups at increased risk for NSF. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Both intracellular and extracellular redox environments are tightly regulated in healthy tissues and are closely correlated with the physiological state of the cell. However, this regulation is often disrupted during periods of cellular stress, damage or cell death. While the dynamics of local redox status play an important role in mediating various biological processes such as cell-cycle progression, immune response and wound-healing, persistent dysregulation of the extracellular redox environment has been linked to a number of pathologies including chronic inflammation, neoplastic growth, and cancer cell aggressiveness. Indeed, the role of redox in tumor biology continues to be an area of active research and is the focus of many redox-activated prodrugs that are currently in development. New imaging methods will certainly facilitate these endeavors while further advancing our basic understanding of redox dynamics in relation to disease. There have been several redox-activated molecular imaging probes reported, each of which employs a unique mechanism of activation to address specific aspects of redox environment. Some of these probes target tissues that are hypoxic (low oxygen tension), which may result from a disruption in blood supply to the affected area or inadequate vascularization as sometimes occurs in tumors. Positron emission tomography probes 18F-fluoroisonidazole (18F-MISO) and 84Cu-diacetyl-bis(N4-methylthiosemicarbazone) (64CU-ATSM) have been used clinically to image tumor hypoxia. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) imaging and spectroscopy probes based on redox-sensitive nitroxides have proven effective at detecting the relative abundance of thiols as well as other reducing species. Magnetic resonance (MR) probes have also been reported. Examples include Gd(III) complexes in which the ligands are capable of forming reversible disulfide linkages with cysteine side-chains of extracellular proteins thereby providing an indirect view of local redox conditions, a Mn(III)-porphyrin which undergoes reduction to a Mn(II) species with higher relaxivity in hypoxic conditions, and recently, a pair of Eu(III) complexes that can be activated in the presence of β-NADH through reduction of the pendant arms of the ligands. MR is an attractive modality to image redox dynamics as it allows the interrogation of intact, opaque organisms in three dimensions at cellular resolution (˜10 μm) on high field systems and submillimeter resolution on clinical scanners. The deep tissue penetration and high resolution of MRI make it possible to directly translate findings from cells to mice to humans. One approach to a redox-sensitive MR probe is to employ a redox-active metal ion. Gd(III), used in the majority of MR probes has only one stable oxidation state in aqueous media. Manganese, however can exist stably in a number of oxidation states depending on the ligand field. High spin Mn(II) complexes can also yield relaxivities that are comparable to the best Gd(III) complexes, and there has been recent work on Mn(II) complexes as MR probes. Herein we propose a new class of redox-activated MR probes based on the Mn(II)/Mn(III) redox couple. The manganese ion can exist stably or metastably in different oxidation states. We have recognized an advantage of the ability of manganese to exist in different oxidation states. We show that it is possible to make ligands that bind to manganese and stabilize both the +2 and +3 oxidation states. The relaxivity of the Mn(II) complex is much higher than the Mn(III) analog. We also show that it is possible to modify the Mn-binding ligand in ways that result in one oxidation state being preferred. A benefit of such redox active complexes is their ability to act as sensors. For instance, we show that a Mn(III) complex can be reduced to the Mn(II) complex by physiological concentrations of glutathione and this in turn results in an increase in magnetic resonance signal. Thus, these complexes can act as sensors of glutathione or other biological reductants. We also show that certain manganese complexes can change their relaxivity as pH changes. Both phenolate-O and sulfonamide-N ligands are acid dissociable and modulate the interaction of manganese with bulk water, which influences relaxivity. In our examples, relaxivity increases as pH decreases, and thus these compounds can act as sensors of pH and acidosis. The pKa values of both phenolate and sulfonamide donors are highly modular and amenable to synthetic fine tuning. Low extracellular pH is a hallmark of tissue ischemia (e.g., stroke, ischemic heart disease, renal ischemia) and many tumors. We also developed a new ligand called CyP3A. This ligand was designed to chelate Mn(II) in a thermodynamically stable and kinetically inert fashion while allowing for direct interaction of Mn(II) with water. Kinetics data indicate that the manganese complex of CyP3A is more inert to Zn(II) transmetallation than the Mn(II) complex of CDTA (cyclohexanediaminetetraacetic acid), which represents the literature precedence exhibiting the optimal balance of the aforementioned features. The pyridyl-N donor of CyP3A is modular and affords an easy means to append another ligand donor capable of reversible occupying the coordination site occupied by water. This scaffold is ideal for potential pH-sensing applications. Additionally, we prepared a high molecular weight (>2000 MW) multimer containing six Mn(II) chelators. The high molecular weight results in slower tumbling of the molecules in solution and can strongly enhance the Mn(II) relaxivity. A further benefit of Mn-based contrast agents is the existence of positron emitting manganese isotopes (Mn-51 and Mn-52) which enable the use of these complexes as positron emission tomography (PET) agents. In addition, by exchange of natural Mn-55 for a PET isotope, it is possible to easily prepare dual MR-PET probes. Such probes could be employed in new hybrid MR-PET scanners where the probe could be detected using both modalities. A benefit of such an approach would be the ability to have more accurate, quantitative measures of physiological parameters such as pH, reduction potential, or ion flux. These and other features, aspects, and advantages of the present invention will become better understood upon consideration of the following detailed description, drawings, and appended claims.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION There are several requirements for a useful redox-activated MR probe: (1) a redox half-cell potential that is accessible to biologically relevant reducing agents like glutathione (GSH); (2) a ligand that stabilizes both oxidation states such that reduction or oxidation does not result in decomposition; (3) strong signal enhancement upon activation; (4) increased signal change in the presence of pathology, i.e., a turn-on probe; and (5) kinetics that are rapid with respect to the imaging timescale. A key design feature of a redox-active probe is to identify a ligand which stabilizes both oxidation states. EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) forms a very stable 7-coordinate Mn(II) complex with one coordinated water co-ligand, and the 2+ oxidation state is strongly favored, see FIG. 1. By contrast, changing two carboxylato donors to phenolato donors as in HBED (N,N′-di(2-hydroxybenzyl)ethylenediamine-N,N′-diacetic acid) or EHPG (N,N′-ethylene bis[2(o-hydroxyphenyl)] glycine) strongly favors Mn(III) complexes with coordination number 6, see FIG. 1. We hypothesized that HBET (hydroxybenzylethylenediamine triacetic acid) (FIG. 1) with a ligand structure that is intermediate between EDTA and HBED—containing only one phenolato donor—could potentially exhibit metastability toward either oxidation state. The preferred oxidation state of such a species would therefore be highly sensitive to changes in redox environment. To test this hypothesis, we prepared manganese complexes of HBED, HBET, and EDTA to examine how the number of phenolate groups contributes to the half-cell potentials of the Mn(III)/Mn(II) redox couple. Cyclic voltammetry of MnII-HBET in TRIS buffer (see FIG. 2) shows a reversible oxidation peak at 0.356 V (vs. K4Fe(CN)6/K3Fe(CN)6), indicating the potential for using this molecule as a redox probe. Anodic (ia) and cathodic current (ic) are linear with the square root of scan rate (v) over the range of 50-600 mV/s (see FIG. 2b), indicating this is a diffusion controlled process. On the other hand, MnII-EDTA and MnIII-HBED display irreversible oxidation and quasi-reversible reduction peaks with half-cell potentials (MnII/MnIII) of 0.633 V and 0.016 V respectively. HBET (hydroxybenzylethylenediamine triacetic acid) was synthesized from reductive amination of mono BOC-protected ethylene diammine with salicylaldehyde, followed by alkylation with t-butyl bromoacetic acid, and then acid deprotection to give the free ligand in overall 45% yield. The reaction of one equivalent of ligand with MnCl2 led to MnII-HBET in 84% isolated yield. The MnIII-HBET complex was synthesized in 38% yield by aerial oxidation of MnCl2 in the presence of one equivalent of the ligand under basic conditions, followed by RP-HPLC purification. The HBET ligand stabilizes both oxidation states to the extent that MnII-HBET and MnIII-HBET can be easily separated and isolated in their pure forms using a standard RP-HPLC system. Both complexes are also stable in phosphate and carbonate buffers. The T1 relaxivities of the MnII-HBET and MnIII-HBET complexes were measured independently at 1.4 T in Tris buffered saline (TBS: pH 7.4, 37° C.) and the values were 2.76 mM−1 s−1 and 1.05 mM−1 s−1, respectively. This difference in relaxivity is large considering that the MnIII state still has four unpaired electrons. In FIG. 3, we show a T1-weighted MR image at 4.7 T of test tubes containing either pure water or equimolar MnIII-HBET or MnII-HBET. The presence of the paramagnetic complex results in higher signal intensity compared to pure water. The higher relaxivity of MnII-HBET is apparent in its brighter image. T1 measurements at 4.7 T revealed a 3.3-fold higher relaxivity for the reduced MnII-HBET form, see FIG. 3. The MnIII-HBET complex is easily reduced to the MnII state in the presence of glutathione. This conversion appears to proceed directly to the product without the accumulation of any long-lived reaction intermediates or the formation of byproducts. This is demonstrated by the timecourse experiment shown in FIG. 4b where the emergence of the MnIII-HBET complex occurs simultaneously with the consumption of MnIII-HBET. The progress of this reaction can also be followed in real-time by relaxometry (see FIG. 4a) using conditions relevant for clinical imaging (1.4 T, 37° C.). Since the relaxivity of the Mn(II) complex is greater than that of the Mn(III) complex, the longitudinal relaxation rate of water protons (1/M) will increase in proportion to the concentration of MnII-HBET in the reaction. Direct conversion of the Mn(III) complex to the Mn(II) complex is further evidenced by the observation that the rate of formation of the MnIII-HBET species is effectively equivalent to the consumption rate of the oxidized form as measured by UV absorbance (see FIG. 4a). A series of kinetic experiments were conducted at 37° C. (pH 7.4) to determine the empirical rate law for the reduction of MnIII-HBET by glutathione. The MnIII-HBET complex possesses a strong absorbance band at 375 nm (ε=1.38×103 M−1 cm −1) in water that is not present in the UV spectrum of the MnII-HBET complex. This feature allowed us to easily monitor the reduction of MnIII-HBET over time. We measured initial reaction rates at three different glutathione concentrations (5 mM, 10 mM and 20 mM). For each glutathione concentration, the reaction was performed at four different initial concentrations of MIII-HBET (0.3 mM, 0.4 mM, 0.5 mM and 0.6 mM). Based on these experiments, we determined that the reaction was first-order in both [GSH] and [MnIII-HBET] with an overall second-order rate constant of (3.8±0.3)×10−1 M−1 s−1. The kinetic properties of any activatable probe are extremely important when considering its application in biomedical imaging. In the case of a redox-activated probe, conversion to the activated state must occur efficiently within a physiologically relevant redox range and should also be rapid with respect to the rate of probe washout. Concentrations of reduced glutathione within the cell are typically 1-10 mM. In that range, the half-life of the MnIII-HBET complex is roughly 3 to 30 minutes. By comparison, the half-life in blood plasma—where glutathione levels are approximately three orders of magnitude lower—would be greater than one week. Therefore, we expect that probe activation will primarily be limited to regions where the normal mechanisms responsible for regulating extracellular redox have been severely impaired or overwhelmed. In conclusion, the MnIII/MnII-HBET redox couple satisfies a number of the key criteria required of a useful probe for redox imaging. The redox half-cell potential is accessible to biologically relevant reducing agents like glutathione; it displays good signal enhancement upon conversion to the MR-active state; and the activation kinetics are rapid with respect to the imaging timescale. Glutathione kinetic studies confirm that the reduction is fast in the presence of physiological glutathione concentrations. This system is extremely well behaved and the interconversion between the two oxidation states occurs via a simple and reversible one-electron process. Cyclic voltammetry confirms that this is a reversible process. Furthermore, we note that the HBET ligand could be readily modified with appropriate aryl substituents to tune the redox potential, or to incorporate a moiety that imparts specific biological targeting, opening up new avenues in molecular MR imaging. In one example embodiment of the invention, the contrast agent is used in a diagnostic imaging technique such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and/or concurrent MRI and positron emission tomography (PET). A “subject” is a mammal, preferably a human. The form in which the contrast agent is administered to the subject is not critical. For example, the contrast agent of the invention can be administered directly to tissue being diagnostically imaged, to a body fluid that contacts the tissue, or to a body location from which the contrast agent can diffuse or be transported to the tissue being diagnostically imaged. The contrast agent can be administered alone or as part of a pharmaceutically acceptable composition. The relative amounts of the contrast agent of the invention, a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, and any additional active ingredients in a pharmaceutical composition of the invention will vary, depending upon the identity, size, and condition of the subject treated and further depending upon the route by which the contrast agent is to be administered. The contrast agent may include a targeting moiety that can target a region of interest in the subject. The targeting moiety may be selected from proteins, enzymes, peptides, antibodies, and drugs.

When the contrast agent is exposed to an environment of changing pH, the relaxivity increases when pH decreases. Referring to FIG. 41, any of the contrast agents of Formulas (I) to (XII) can be used with a magnetic resonance imaging (“MRI”) system 100. The MRI system 100 includes a workstation 102 having a display 104 and a keyboard 106. The workstation 102 includes a processor 108, such as a commercially available programmable machine running a commercially available operating system. The workstation 102 provides the operator interface that enables scan prescriptions to be entered into the MRI system 100. The workstation 102 is coupled to four servers: a pulse sequence server 110; a data acquisition server 112; a data processing server 114, and a data store server 116. The workstation 102 and each server 110, 112, 114 and 116 are connected to communicate with each other. The pulse sequence server 110 functions in response to instructions downloaded from the workstation 102 to operate a gradient system 118 and a radiofrequency (“RF”) system 120. Gradient waveforms necessary to perform the prescribed scan are produced and applied to the gradient system 118, which excites gradient coils in an assembly 122 to produce the magnetic field gradients Gx, Gy, and Gz used for position encoding MR signals. The gradient coil assembly 122 forms part of a magnet assembly 124 extending about a bore 125 formed there through and includes a polarizing magnet 126 and a whole-body RF coil 128. RF excitation waveforms are applied to the RF coil 128, or a separate local coil (not shown), by the RF system 120 to perform the prescribed magnetic resonance pulse sequence. Responsive MR signals detected by the RF coil 128, or a separate local coil (not shown), are received by the RF system 120, amplified, demodulated, filtered, and digitized under direction of commands produced by the pulse sequence server 110. The RF system 120 includes an RF transmitter for producing a wide variety of RF pulses used in MR pulse sequences. The RF transmitter is responsive to the scan prescription and direction from the pulse sequence server 110 to produce RF pulses of the desired frequency, phase, and pulse amplitude waveform. The generated RF pulses may be applied to the whole body RF coil 128 or to one or more local coils or coil arrays. The RF system 120 also includes one or more RF receiver channels. Each RF receiver channel includes an RF amplifier that amplifies the MR signal received by the coil 128 to which it is connected, and a detector that detects and digitizes the I and Q quadrature components of the received MR signal. The magnitude of the received MR signal may thus be determined at any sampled point by the square root of the sum of the squares of the I and Q components: [in-line-formulae]M=√{square root over (I2+Q2)} Eqn. (1);[/in-line-formulae] and the phase of the received MR signal may also be determined: φ = tan - 1  ( Q I ) . Eqn .  ( 2 ) The pulse sequence server 110 also optionally receives patient data from a physiological acquisition controller 130. The controller 130 receives signals from a number of different sensors connected to the patient, such as electrocardiograph (“ECG”) signals from electrodes, or respiratory signals from a bellows or other respiratory monitoring device. Such signals are typically used by the pulse sequence server 110 to synchronize, or “gate,” the performance of the scan with the subject's heart beat or respiration. The digitized MR signal samples produced by the RF system 120 are received by the data acquisition server 112. The data acquisition server 112 operates in response to instructions downloaded from the workstation 102 to receive the real-time MR data and provide buffer storage, such that no data is lost by data overrun. In some scans, the data acquisition server 112 does little more than pass the acquired MR data to the data processor server 114. However, in scans that require information derived from acquired MR data to control the further performance of the scan, the data acquisition server 112 is programmed to produce such information and convey it to the pulse sequence server 110. For example, during prescans, MR data is acquired and used to calibrate the pulse sequence performed by the pulse sequence server 110. The data processing server 114 receives MR data from the data acquisition server 112 and processes it in accordance with instructions downloaded from the workstation 102. Images reconstructed by the data processing server 114 are conveyed back to the workstation 102 where they are stored. Real-time images are stored in a data base memory cache (not shown), from which they may be output to operator display 112 or a display 136 that is located near the magnet assembly 124 for use by attending physicians. Batch mode images or selected real time images are stored in a host database on disc storage 138. When such images have been reconstructed and transferred to storage, the data processing server 114 notifies the data store server 116 on the workstation 102. The workstation 102 may be used by an operator to archive the images, produce films, or send the images via a network to other facilities. FIG. 42 depicts a PET system 200 that can be used in the method of present invention along with the MRI system 100. The PET system 200 includes an imaging hardware system 210 that includes a detector ring assembly 212 about a central axis, or bore 214. An operator work station 216 including a commercially-available processor running a commercially-available operating system communicates through a communications link 218 with a gantry controller 220 to control operation of the imaging hardware system 210. The detector ring assembly 212 is formed of a multitude of radiation detector units 222 that produce a signal responsive to detection of a photon on communications line 224 when an event occurs. A set of acquisition circuits 226 receive the signals and produce signals indicating the event coordinates (x, y) and the total energy associated with the photons that caused the event. These signals are sent through a cable 228 to an event locator circuit 230. Each acquisition circuit 226 also produces an event detection pulse that indicates the exact moment the interaction took place. Other systems utilize sophisticated digital electronics that can also obtain this information regarding the precise instant in which the event occurred from the same signals used to obtain energy and event coordinates. The event locator circuits 230 in some implementations, form part of a data acquisition processing system 232 that periodically samples the signals produced by the acquisition circuits 226. The data acquisition processing system 232 includes a general controller 234 that controls communications on a backplane bus 236 and on the general communications network 218. The event locator circuits 230 assemble the information regarding each valid event into a set of numbers that indicate precisely when the event took place and the position in which the event was detected. This event data packet is conveyed to a coincidence detector 238 that is also part of the data acquisition processing system 232. The coincidence detector 238 accepts the event data packets from the event locator circuit 230 and determines if any two of them are in coincidence. Coincidence is determined by a number of factors. First, the time markers in each event data packet must be within a predetermined time window, for example, 0.5 nanoseconds or even down to picoseconds. Second, the locations indicated by the two event data packets must lie on a straight line that passes through the field of view in the scanner bore 214. Events that cannot be paired are discarded from consideration by the coincidence detector 238, but coincident event pairs are located and recorded as a coincidence data packet. These coincidence data packets are provided to a sorter 240. The function of the sorter in many traditional PET imaging systems is to receive the coincidence data packets and generate memory addresses from the coincidence data packets for the efficient storage of the coincidence data. In that context, the set of all projection rays that point in the same direction (8) and pass through the scanner's field of view (FOV) is a complete projection, or “view”. The distance (R) between a particular projection ray and the center of the FOV locates that projection ray within the FOV. The sorter 240 counts all of the events that occur on a given projection ray (R, θ) during the scan by sorting out the coincidence data packets that indicate an event at the two detectors lying on this projection ray. The coincidence counts are organized, for example, as a set of two-dimensional arrays, one for each axial image plane, and each having as one of its dimensions the projection angle θ and the other dimension the distance R. This θ by R map of the measured events is call a histogram or, more commonly, a sinogram array. It is these sinograms that are processed to reconstruct images that indicate the number of events that took place at each image pixel location during the scan. The sorter 240 counts all events occurring along each projection ray (R, θ) and organizes them into an image data array. The sorter 240 provides image datasets to an image processing/reconstruction system 242, for example, by way of a communications link 244 to be stored in an image array 246. The image arrays 246 hold the respective datasets for access by an image processor 248 that reconstructs images. The image processing/reconstruction system 242 may communicate with and/or be integrated with the work station 216 or other remote work stations. The invention is further illustrated in the following Examples which are presented for purposes of illustration and not of limitation. EXAMPLES Example 1 Experimental General Materials and Instrumentation. All chemicals and solvents were purchased commercially and used without further purification. NMR spectra were recorded on either 500 MHz or 400 MHz Varian spectrometers. Chemical shifts are reported in δ (ppm). For 1H and 13C NMR spectra, the residual solvent peaks were used as internal reference, except for the 13C NMR of the ligand where tertbutanol was used as the internal reference. Liquid chromatography-electrospray mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was performed using an Agilent 1100 Series apparatus with an LC/MSD trap and Daly conversion dynode detector with UV detection at 220, 254 and 280 nm. The methods used on this system are as follows: (a) Luna C18 column (100×2 mm); eluent A: H2O/0.1% formic acid, B: MeCN/0.1% formic acid; gradient: 5% B to 95% B over 9 minutes; flow rate 0.8 mL/min (used for characterization of organic compounds), and (b) Kromasil C18 column (250×4.6 mm); eluent C: 95% MeCN/5% 10 mM ammonium acetate, D: 10 mM ammonium acetate; gradient 5% C to 8% C over 14 minutes; flow rate 0.8 ml/min (used for characterization of manganese complexes). Reversed-phase semipreparative purification was performed on a Rainin Dynamax HPLC system with UV detection at 254 nm using a Polaris C18 column. The method used for purification is as follows: The mobile phase A was 50 mM ammonium acetate buffer, pH 6.5 and mobile phase B was a mixture of 5% 50 mM ammonium acetate buffer, pH 6.5/95% MeCN. Starting from 5% B, the fraction of B increased to 8% over 23 minutes. The column was washed with 100% B for 2 minutes and then ramped to 5% B. The system was re-equilibrated at 5% B for 3 minutes. Relaxivity measurements were performed on a Bruker mq60 Minispec at 1.4 T and 37° C. Manganese concentrations were determined using an Agilent 7500a ICP-MS system. All samples were diluted with 0.1% Triton X-100 in 5% nitric acid containing 20 ppb of Lu (as internal standard). The ratio of Mn (54.94)/Lu(174.97) was used to quantify the manganese concentration. A linear calibration curve ranging from 0.1 ppb to 200 ppb was generated daily for the quantification. UV-Vis spectra were recorded on a SpectraMax M2 spectrophotometer using quartz cuvette with a 1 cm path length. Cyclic voltammetry of MnIIHBET, MnIIEDTA and MnIIIHBET was recorded using a Nuvant EZstat pro potentiostat in TRIS buffer (pH=7.4), containing 0.5M KNO3 as supporting electrolyte, at 100 mVs-1 scan rate. Glassy carbon was used as the working electrode, Ag/AgCl served as the reference electrode and Pt wire was used as the auxiliary electrode. The K4FeCN6/K3FeCN6 couple was used as the internal standard. Relaxometric Study. T1 was measured with an inversion recovery pulse sequence taking 10 inversion times. Relaxivity was determined from the slope of a plot of 1/T1 vs. concentration of in TRIS buffer, pH=7.4 at 37° C. The concentration of manganese in each stock solution was determined using ICP-MS. Mn:Ligand Stoichiometry: The TFA composition of the ligand species and the amount of ligand needed to fully chelate all Mn(II) in solution was determined in accordance to the following example: to 500 μL samples of 0.91 mM MnCl2 in pH 7.40 buffer (25 mM TRIS) (0.45 μmol present in each), increasingly larger portions of a 1.45 mM 34 (0 to 675 μL in increments of 75 μL; 1.09 μmol present in each 75 μL portion) were added. The T2 value of each sample was subsequently measured and relaxivity plotted as a ratio of ligand to metal (FIG. 35). The point of full Mn consumption was determined by the point where r2 ceased to decrease with added ligand. To probe the speciation of the manganese complexes in solution, pH titrations of 1:1 Mn2+:ligand were performed using a 1 N NaOH under N2 atmosphere (FIG. 21). To determine the species that exists in these two pH ranges the UV spectrum as a function of pH was monitored (see FIGS. 22-24). The deprotonation of the phenol moiety to form phenoxide ion results in characteristic UV bands that indicates that Mn-HBET and Mn-HBET-OMe are protonated at lower pH and the protonation occurs at the phenol. As the pH is increased the phenol deprotonates and coordinates to the manganese center. The speciation in solution was also monitored by measuring the relaxivity of water protons at 1.4 T. FIG. 24 shows the change of relaxivity vs. pH for the three ligand systems. The change in the relaxivity is consistent with the pH dependent speciation as observed in the UV studies. Kinetic Experiments for the Reduction Reaction. This series of kinetic experiments were conducted at 37° C. (pH 7.4) to determine the empirical rate law for the reduction of MnIII-HBET by glutathione. The MnIIIHBET complex possesses a strong absorbance band at 375 nm (ε=1.38×103 M−1 cm−1) in water that is not present in the UV spectrum of the MnII-HBET complex. This feature was used to monitor the reduction of MnIII-HBET over time. Initial reaction rates were measured at a three different glutathione concentrations (5 mM, 10 mM and 20 mM). Additionally, for each glutathione concentration, the reaction was performed at four different initial concentrations of MnIII-HBET (0.3 mM, 0.4 mM, 0.5 mM and 0.6 mM). By using a large excess of glutathione in these experiments, we found the reaction behaved pseudo first-order with respect to the MnIII-HBET complex as expressed in equation S1. [in-line-formulae][MnIII HBET]t=[MnIII HBET]o·e−kobs·t (eq. S1)[/in-line-formulae] Here, the observed rate constant (kobs) is simply the product of the actual rate constant (k) and [GSH], t is time, and the subscripts ‘t’ and ‘o’ refer to the concentration at time T or the initial concentration, respectively. FIG. 14 shows two sets of kinetic experiments in which we have plotted the natural log of [MnIII-HBET]t as a function of time. In this way, the slope of each line is equal to −k·[GSH] and the intercept is ln[MnIII-HBET]o. Based on these experiments, we determined that the reaction was first-order in both [GSH] and [MnIII-HBET] with an overall second-order rate constant of (3.8±0.3)×10−1 M−1 s−1. Oxidation of MnIIHBET with Hydrogen Peroxide. The oxidation of MnIIHBET with H2O2 (1 mM) in TRIS buffer (pH=7.4) was followed using UV-Vis spectroscopy, relaxivity measurements, and LC-MS. Unlike the reduction of MnIIIHBET with glutathione, the oxidation reaction appears to reach equilibrium after 70% conversion to MnIIIHBET as calculated from LC-MS data. MR Imaging. MR imaging was performed using a Bruker Biospec 4.7T system. Three samples (˜500 μL) were placed in a homemade sample holder and imaged using a volume coil. Acquisition matrix=64×256 for 0.234×0.312 mm2 in-plane resolution; slice thickness=5 mm. T1-weighted images were obtained with a fast low angle shot (FLASH) gradient echo sequence: TR/TE/FA=20/5.44/40° with 8 averages. T1 was determined using a 2D rapid acquisition refocused echo (RARE) inversion recovery sequence: TR=3200 ms, TE=9.7 ms. Inversion times (TI): 5, 45, 85, 165, 325, 645, 1285, 1925 and 3205 ms. T1 was obtained from a nonlinear least square fit of the signal intensity (SI(t)) vs. TI curve where T1, SI(0) and a are adjustable parameters, equation S2. [in-line-formulae]SI(t)=SI(0)[1−α,eTI/T1] (eq. S2)[/in-line-formulae] Stability of MnIIHBET and MnIIIHBET Complexes The stability of the manganese complexes were measured in different buffers using concentrations similar to those found in the blood plasma (1 mM phosphate buffer, 25 mM sodium bicarbonate buffer and 0.1 mM citrate buffer). A solution, 0.5 mM, of the manganese complex was incubated in the respective buffers at 37° C. (pH=7.4) and the species were then quantified on the LC-MS using the method as described earlier. The manganese complexes (0.5 mM) were also treated with EDTA (0.5 mM) in TRIS buffer (pH=7.4) and incubated at 37° C. for 1 hour. The species were then quantified on the LC-MS using the method as described earlier. Zn(II) Transmetallation Kinetics. Displacement of Mn(II) by Zn(II) was measured by monitoring the evolution of free Mn(II) concentration by T2-relaxometry. 1 mM Mn(II) complex was challenged with 25 mM Zn(OTf)2 in 50 mM MES buffer (pH 6.00). The r2 data were fit to the below equation [in-line-formulae]r2=r2(free Mn)*(1−e−k*t)+r2o [/in-line-formulae] Synthesis Materials and Instrumentation. All chemicals and solvents were purchased commercially and used without further purification. NMR spectra were recorded on either a 500 MHz or 400 MHz Varian spectrometers.

The synthesis of 2′-((2-((carboxymethyl)(2-hydroxybenzyl)amino)ethyl)azanediyl)diacetic acid (HBET) (3) is shown in FIG. 6. tert-Butyl (2-((2-hydroxybenzyl)amino)ethyl)carbamate (1) To a solution of salicylaldehyde (12 mmol, 1.465 g) in 90 mL methanol, was added a solution of tert-Butyl N-(2-aminoethyl)carbamate (12 mmol, 1.923 g) in methanol (30 mL) and the solution was stirred for 1 hour. To this stirring solution solid NaBH4 (24 mmol, 0.908 g) was added. Rapid evolution of gas was observed and solution turned colorless from pale yellow. After stirring for 3 hours, all volatiles were removed under reduced pressure, and a white solid was obtained. The residue was dissolved in 200 mL CH2Cl2 extracted with 200 mL saturated NaHCO3 solution. The aqueous layer was extracted with CH2Cl2 (2×100 mL).

Then, an aliquot of this standardized ligand solution was mixed with 0.95 eq of MnCl2 in HEPES buffer and the concentration measured by ICP-MS. tert-butyl protected N3P3-(TyOH-EDTA)6 (53) 51 (547 mg, 0.83 mmol) and cesium carbonate (318 mg, 0.97 mmol) were added at 0° C. to a solution of hexachlorocyclotriphosphazene (45.6 mg, 0.131 mmol) in fresh dry acetonitrile (20 mL) under N2. The reaction mixture was stirred at 45° C. for 2 days and 1H NMR (presence of ortho H peak at δ=6.90 for product vs. δ=6.73 for starting material) and 31P NMR (appearance of δ=7.81 peak) were used to monitor the reaction. After the mixture was cooled to room temperature, salts were removed by centrifugation, and the clear solution was concentrated under reduced pressure and subjected to flash chromatography (1% Et3N, DCM/EtOAc) to afford Hexamer-tert-butyl ester as a pale yellow oil (420 mg, 82%). 1H NMR (500 MHZ, CD3C1, δ from TMS): 7.07 (d, J=8.3 Hz, 12H), 6.90 (d, J=8.6 Hz, 12H), 3.47 (d, J=8.3 Hz, 24H), 3.43 (d, J=4.9 Hz, 24H), 3.11-3.07 (m, 6H), 2.93-2.83 (m, 12H), 2.63-2.53 (m, 12H), 1.43 (s, 108H), 1.39 (s, 108H). 13C{1H} NMR (125.7 MHZ, CD3C1, δ from TMS): 171.31, 170.94, 130.15, 120.69, 80.66, 80.56, 63.42, 56.35, 55.40, 53.65, 28.26, 28.24. 31P NMR (202 MHZ, CD3C1, 6): 7.81. ESI: m/z 1934.0 [M+2H]2+; calcd.: 1933.6. N3P3-(TyOH-EDTA)6 (54) 53 (410 mg, 0.11 mmol) was dissolved in a mixture of TFA, water, thioanisole, phenol, and ethanedithiol in a 82.5:5:5 ratio and the reaction solution was stirred for 12 hours at room temperature with reaction monitoring by LC-MS. The solution was cooled in an ice bath and cold diethyl ether (50 mL) was added to precipitate the product. The precipitated product was isolated by centrifugation and washed with three times with ether to obtain a white solid (195 mg, 77%). 1H NMR (500 MHZ, D2O, 6): 7.15 (d, J=8.2 Hz, 12H), 6.84 (d, J=8.2 Hz, 12H), 3.69 (d, J=16.7 Hz, 12H), 3.55 (m, 24H), 3.45 (d, J=16.7 Hz, 12H), 3.29 (m, 6H), 3.11 (m, 12H), 2.78-2.60 (m, 6H). 13C{1H} NMR (125.7 MHZ, D2O, 6): 174.12, 171.36, 163.06, 162.78, 148.66, 133.63, 130.78, 121.30, 117.43, 115.11, 61.16, 57.08, 54.88, 54.61, 31.71. 31P NMR (202 MHZ, D2O, 6): 8.57. Mn6[N3P3-(TyOH-EDTA)6] (55) This complex was prepared in situ. First, a solution of 54 (11.3 mg) in 2.0 mL of HEPES buffer (100 mM, pH=7.4) was prepared along with a 4.19 mM solution of MnCl2 in HEPES. These solutions were mixed at different ratios and the T2 of solvent water was measured at 1.4T to determine the concentration of the Hexamer ligand as described for compound 48. Since the hexamer ligand contains 6 EDTA moieties, one hexamer ligand will bind 6 equivalents of Mn. Based on this result, 60 mg of hexamer ligand was then mixed with 24.3 mg of MnCl2.4H2O in 2.0 mL deionized water and the pH carefully adjusted to 7.4 with addition of 0.2 M NaOH. This represents a slight (2%) excess of MnCl2 to ensure total chelation. The excess Mn2+ was separated from the anionic hexamer complex by passing the solution through a cation exchange column (Alltech, IC-Na) to remove the excess Mn2+. The final product was obtained by lyophilization as white solid (60 mg, 85%). The relaxivities of the compounds for Formulas (XI) and (XII) were determined at different field strengths at 37° C. in pH 7.4 HEPES buffer. The relaxivity was obtained from the slope of a plot of 1/T1 vs. [Mn] for different Mn concentrations. Since Formula (XI) contains 6 Mn per molecule, the ionic (per Mn) and molecular (per molecule) relaxivities are given below.
