FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a device for removing/transporting a person suffering from an injury and to a method for transporting the person. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION There are many situations wherein an injured person must be transported from a first place (usually the place of injury) to a safer location or treatment facility. Although such a situation can occur in many different applications, the description herein will focus on the case of firefighters. However, it will be understood that the device and method may be used in many different situations where it is necessary to transport an injured individual. There are many devices known in the art for transporting injured individuals. They usually consist of a backboard onto which the injured person is secured. Subsequently, the board can be lifted by a pair of individuals. Such a device is particularly useful in the case of back injuries wherein the person can be immobilized on the backboard. Firefighting is inherently a very dangerous occupation and firefighters must undergo in-depth training to respond to a variety of situations. One of the most dangerous situations involves a situation wherein a firefighter has entered a building or other structure and is subsequently trapped in the building. This frequently occurs when debris falls on the firefighter. Most fire departments maintain a staff of individuals who are specifically trained to rescue firefighters who are downed. The situation is extremely difficult and dangerous since there is also a high degree of danger to the rescuers. It is inherently difficult to attempt to rescue an individual in such a situation. It will be understood that the individual represents a dead weight of 250-350 pounds and the rescuers must often operate in situations wherein visibility is limited or nil. Furthermore, the equipment which the firefighters and rescuers utilize is not designed to provide a tactile response in the sense that the gloves do not permit a feedback of what the hands are doing. Other problems which exist are the transportation of the downed firefighter. As above mentioned, the sheer weight of the person with the heavy equipment on poses a substantial problem. At present, the downed firefighter is carried by one or more rescuers to a place of evacuation. Frequently, the only way out of some buildings is by means of a window which presents the problem of passing the person through the window to other firefighters on ladders and the like. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is an object of the present invention to provide an apparatus suitable for transporting an individual from a first location to a second location. It is a further object of the present invention to provide a method of transporting an individual from a first location to a second location. According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a device for transporting an individual from a first location to a second location comprising a first leg having a proximal end and a distal end, a second leg having a proximal end and a distal end, a connecting member, the proximal end of the first leg and the second leg being connected to the connecting member, a grasping element being secured to the connecting member, at least one cross member extending between the first leg and the second leg, and at least one strap secured to at least one of the legs and cross member. According to a further aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method for transporting an individual from a first location to a second location comprising the steps of, supplying a device for transporting an individual from a first location to a second location comprising a first leg having a proximal and a distal end, a second leg having a proximal end and a distal end, a connecting member, proximal end of the first leg and the second leg being connected to the connecting member, a grasping element being secured to the connecting member, at least one cross member extending between the first leg and the second leg and at least one strap secured to at feast one of the legs and cross member, securing an individual to the device using the at least one strap, and securing a cable to the grasping element, placing the distal ends of the first and second legs against an abutting surface, and pulling on the cable to thereby lift one end of the device to a vertical position. The first and second legs provide the rigidity to the structure and accordingly, are formed of a suitable material. Naturally, it is preferred that the material be fire resistant and to this end, a suitable metallic or composite material may be utilized. Preferably, the legs are telescopic in nature. For east of adjustment, this telescopic arrangement is preferably situated proximate the distal end, although other arrangements can be utilized. Various types of telescopic structures are known in the art and any suitable one may be utilized in the practice of the present invention. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Having thus generally described the invention, reference will be made to the accompanying drawings illustrating an embodiment thereof, in which: FIG. 1 is a plan view of a device according to the present invention; FIG. 2 is a side elevational view illustrating use of the device in a first mode; FIG. 3 is a side elevational view illustrating use of the device to extract a fireman; FIG. 4 is a view similar to FIG. 3 illustrating use of the device; and FIG. 5 is a view illustrating the lowering of a rescued fireman. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Referring to the drawings in greater detail and by reference characters thereto, there is illustrated an extraction device for extracting or transporting a person and which device is generally designated by reference numeral 10. Device 10, as may be seen in FIG. 1, has a first leg which is generally designated by reference numeral 12. First leg 12 in turn is formed of an upper portion 14 and a lower portion 16. Upper portion 14 and lower portion 16 are telescopic in nature. Thus, the distal end of upper portion 14 has a series of apertures 24. A pin 26 may be placed through an aperture in lower portion 16 at one of the selected apertures 24 to provide a desired length to the first leg 12. A ring 28 is provided for manipulating pin 26. A second leg is generally designated by reference numeral 18 and in a manner similar to first leg 12, has an upper portion 20 and a lower portion 22. The distal end of upper portion 20 has a series of apertures 30 which permit a pin 32 to be inserted to provide a desired length to second leg 18. A ring 34 is secured to pin 32 for ease of manipulation of pin 32. At their proximal end, upper portion 14 of first leg 12 and upper portion 20 of second leg 18 are secured to a connecting member 36. Preferably, the connection is such that connectors 38 permit pivotable movement of first leg 12 and second leg 18. Extending between upper portion 14 of first leg 12 and upper portion 20 of second leg 18 are a plurality of web members. A first web member 40 extends around upper portions 14 and 20 and are held in position by means of a guide member 45. In the illustrated embodiment, the ends of web member 40 are secured to the main portion thereof. A second web member 42 and a third web member 44 are arranged in a similar fashion. The distal ends of lower portions 16 and 22 are secured together by means of a flexible cable 46. The device includes a strap 48 having buckles 50, 52 at respective ends thereof for securement together about the body of a person to be transported. Device 10 also includes a first longitudinal web 54 and a second longitudinal web 56. First longitudinal web 54 has an end secured through second longitudinal web 56 at point 58. Longitudinal web 54 is also secured to third, second and first web members 44, 42, and 40 at securement points 60, 62 and 64. Similarly, second longitudinal web 56 is secured at points 66, 68 and 70. As will be noted, first and second longitudinal webs 54, 56 are in reality a single piece of material which is looped about a connecting element 72 which is secured to connecting member 36. A grasping element 74 is a ring which is secured to connecting member 36. It will also be noted that there is provided a strap 76 and a grasping ring 78 at the other end of longitudinal webs 54, 56. As shown in FIG. 2, device 10 may be utilized to pull a downed firefighter along a surface. Normally, a single person would be able to use the device to accomplish this. However, it will be understood that the distal end of first leg 12 and second leg 18 could be grasped and carried by a second person. FIGS. 3, 4 and 5 illustrate use of the device 10 to extract a downed firefighter. As may be seen, the device is anchored against a wall W and a cable C is utilized to pick up the downed firefighter. The use of the tool or device permits the passage of the downed firefighter through a window from which he nay be lowered down a ladder. It will be understood that the above described embodiment is for purposes of illustration only and that changes and modifications may be made thereto without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. 1.
