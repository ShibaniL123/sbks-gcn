Step 1: Preparation of t-butyl 4-(5-amino-6-nitropiperidin-3-yl)piperazine-1-carbonate
Analogous to the process for preparing Compound a in Step 1 in Example 1, a compound mono-t-butoxycarbonyl (mono-t-Boc) protected piperazine was subjected to nucleophilic substitution with 5-bromo-2-nitro-3-aminopyridine to obtain Compound s: t-butyl 4-(5-amino-6-nitropiperidin-3-yl)piperazine-1-carbonate (0.7 g, yield 82%).
