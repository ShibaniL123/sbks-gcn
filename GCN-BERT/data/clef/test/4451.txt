LIGAND FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a variant proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL) which binds the B cell maturation antigen (BCMA). Therapeutic agents comprising such a variant APRIL are useful in the treatment of plasma cell diseases such as multiple myeloma. BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION Multiple Myeloma Multiple Myeloma (myeloma) is a bone-marrow malignancy of plasma cells. Collections of abnormal plasma cells accumulate in the bone marrow, where they interfere with the production of normal blood cells. Myeloma is the second most common hematological malignancy in the U.S. (after non-Hodgkin lymphoma), and constitutes 13% of haematologic malignancies and 1 % of all cancers. The disease is burdensome in terms of suffering as well as medical expenditure since it causes pathological fractures, susceptibility to infection, renal and then bone-marrow failure before death. Unlike many lymphomas, myeloma is currently incurable. Standard chemotherapy agents used in lymphoma are largely ineffective for myeloma. In addition, since CD20 expression is lost in plasma cells, Rituximab cannot be used against this disease. New agents such as Bortezamib and Lenolidomide are partially effective, but fail to lead to long-lasting remissions. There is thus a need for alternative agents for the treatment of myeloma which have increased efficacy and improved long-term effects. BCMA BCMA, also known as TNFRSF17, is a plasma cell specific surface antigen which is expressed exclusively on B-lineage haemopoietic cells or dendritic cells. It is a member of the TNF receptor family. BCMA is not expressed on na'ive B cells but is up-regulated during B-cell differentiation into plasmablasts, and is brightly expressed on memory B cells, plasmablasts and bone marrow plasma cells. BCMA is also expressed on the majority of primary myeloma cells. Apart from low levels of mRNA detected on dendritic cells, BCMA expression appears to be absent on other tissues, indicating the potential as a target for novel therapeutics for multiple myeloma. BCMA functions within a network of interconnected ligands and receptors which is shown schematically in Figure 1. Two other TNF receptors share the ligands APRIL and BAFF with BCMA - transmembrane activator and calcium modulator and cyclophilin ligand interactor (TACI, also known as TNFRSF13B), which is found on activated T-cells and all B-cells; and BAFF-R (TNFRSF13C) which is predominantly expressed on B-lymphocytes. Multiple myeloma cells express TACI in some cases and BCMA in most cases, but never BAFF-R. The natural ligand APRIL is potentially useful as or as part of a BCMA-targeting therapeutic. However, cross-reaction with TACI is potentially a problem, because TACI is found on activated T-cells and all B-cells, so treatment with an agent directed to BCMA on myeloma cells may also cause a pathological depletion of noncancerous B and T cell subsets. APRIL is also potentially useful in diagnostic applications to identify plasma cells, in particular the presence of malignant plasma cells in conditions such as multiple myeloma. However, again, the capacity of APRIL to also bind TACI means that APRII-based diagnostics will also identify generally activated T-cells and all B-cells, meaning that the results are ambiguous. There is thus a need to develop anti-BCMA therapeutics and diagnostics which are not associated with these disadvantages. DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES Figure 1 - Ligand Specificity and Function Assignment of APRIL and BAFF B-cell-activating factor (BAFF, TNFSF13B) interacts with BAFF-Receptor (BAFF-R, TNFRSF13C), B-cell membrane antigen (BCMA, TNFRSF17) and transmembrane activator and calcium modulator and cyclophilin ligand interactor (TACI, TNFRSF13B) while A proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL, TNFSF13) interacts with BCMA, TACI and proteoglycans. BAFF-R activation affects peripheral B-cell survival, while BCMA may affect plasma cell survival. APRIL interaction with proteoglycans involves acidic sulphated glycol-saminoglycan side-chain containing amino-terminus of APRIL. Figure 2 - Expression data of BCMA on Myeloma Myeloma cells from bone marrow samples from 39 multiple myeloma patients were isolated by a CD138+ magnetic bead selection. These cells were stained with the anti-BCMA monoclonal antibody J6MO conjugated with PE (GSK). Antigen copy number was quantified using PE Quantibrite beads (Becton Dickenson) as per the manufacturer's instructions. A box and whiskers plot of antigen copy number is presented along with the range, interquartile and median values plotted. We found the range is 348.7-4268.4 BCMA copies per cell with a mean of 1 181 and a median of 1084.9. Figure 3 - Standard design of a Chimeric Antigen Receptor The typical format of a chimeric antigen receptor is shown. These are type I transmembrane proteins. An ectodomain recognizes antigen. This is composed of an antibody derived single-chain variable fragment (scFv) which is attached to a spacer domain. This in turn is connected to a transmembrane domain which acts to anchor the molecule in the membrane. Finally, this is connected to an endodomain which acts to transmits intracellular signals to the cell. This is composed of one or more signalling domains. Figure 4 -Design of the different APRIL-based CARs generated. The CAR design as shown in Figure 3 was modified so that the scFv was replaced with a modified form of APRIL to act as an antigen binding domain: APRIL was truncated so that the proteoglycan binding amino-terminus is absent. A signal peptide was then attached to truncated APRIL amino-terminus to direct the protein to the cell surface. Three CARs were generated with this APRIL based binding domain: A. In the first CAR, the human CD8 stalk domain was used as a spacer domain. B. In the second CAR, the hinge from lgG1 was used as a spacer domain. C. In the third CAR, the hinge, CH2 and CH3 domains of human lgG1 modified with the pva/a mutations described by Hombach et al (2010 Gene Ther. 17:1206-1213) to reduce Fc Receptor binding was used as a spacer (henceforth referred as Fc-pvaa). In all CARs, these spacers were connected to the CD28 transmembrane domain and then to a tripartite endodomain containing a fusion of the CD28, OX40 and the CD3-Zeta endodomain (Pule et al, Molecular therapy, 2005: Volume 12; Issue 5; Pages 933-41 ). Figure 5 - Annotated Amino acid sequence of the above three APRIL-CARS A: Shows the annotated amino acid sequence of the CD8 stalk APRIL CAR; B: Shows the annotated amino acid sequence of the APRIL lgG1 hinge based CAR; C: Shows the annotated amino acid sequence of the APRIL Fc-pvaa based CAR. Figure 6- Expression and ligand binding of different APRIL based CARs A. The receptors were co-expressed with a marker gene truncated CD34 in a retroviral gene vector. Expression of the marker gene on transduced cells allows confirmation of transduction. B. T-cells were transduced with APRIL based CARs with either the CD8 stalk spacer, lgG1 hinge or Fc spacer. To test whether these receptors could be stably expressed on the cell surface, T-cells were then stained with anti- APRIL-biotin/Streptavidin APC and anti-CD34. Flow-cytometric analysis was performed. APRIL was equally detected on the cell surface in the three CARs suggesting they are equally stably expressed. C. Next, the capacity of the CARs to recognize TACI and BCMA was determined. The transduced T-cells were stained with either recombinant BCMA or TACI fused to mouse lgG2a Fc fusion along with an anti-mouse secondary and anti-CD34. All three receptor formats showed binding to both BCMA and TACI. A surprising finding was that binding to BCMA seemed greater than to TACI. A further surprising finding was that although all three CARs were equally expressed, the CD8 stalk and lgG1 hinge CARs appeared better at recognizing BCMA and TACI than that with the Fc spacer. Figure 7 - Function of the different CAR constructs. Functional assays were performed of the three different APRIL based CARs. Normal donor peripheral blood T-cells either non-transduced (NT), or transduced to express the different CARs. Transduction was performed using equal titer supernatant. These T-cells were then CD56 depleted to remove non-specific NK activity and used as effectors. SupT1 cells either non-transduced (NT), or transduced to express BCMA or TACI were used as targets. Data shown is mean and standard deviation from 5 independent experiments. A. Specific killing of BCMA and TACI expressing T-cells was determined using Chromium release. B. Interferon-γ release was also determined. Targets and effectors were co-cultured at a ratio of 1 : 1. After 24 hours, lnterferon-γ in the supernatant was assayed by ELISA. C. Proliferation / survival of CAR T-cells were also determined by counting number of CAR T-cells in the same co-culture incubated for a further 6 days. All 3 CARs direct responses against BCMA and TACI expressing targets. The responses to BCMA were greater than for TACI. Figure 8 - Killing of primary Myeloma cells by APRIL CAR T-cells Since most primary myeloma cells express a low number of BCMA molecules on their surface, it was investigated whether killing of primary myeloma cells occurs despite low-density expression. Three cases were selected which represented the range of BCMA expression described in Figure 2: the first had dim expression (lower than mean); the second case had intermediate expression (approximately mean expression) and the third had bright (above mean expression). A histogram of BCMA staining against isotype control for all three cases is shown on the left. In this assay, only the CD8 stalk and hinge APRIL CARs were tested. On the left, survival of myeloma cells compared with starting numbers is shown at day 3 and day 6 after a 1 :1 co-culture of myeloma cells and CAR T-cells. By day 6, >95% of the myeloma cells were eliminated, including those with dim BCMA expression. Figure 9 - Methods used to develop novel APRIL mutants useful for BCMA targeting. A. Candidate APRIL molecules were displayed in the CD8 stalk CAR format (but without a signalling endodomain) and were co-expressed with CD34 using a foot-and- mouth disease 2A sequence. B. Residues which appeared important for BCMA specificity or affinity from crystallographic data were randomized by splicing-by- overlap PCR using oligonucleotides which were degenerate over the coding codon as primers. These PCR products were ligated into the CD8 stalk CAR format and used to transform bacteria. Individual bacterial colonies (each containing a single mutant) were cultured. Plasmid DNA was isolated from these cultures and used to transfect 293T cells. After transfection, 293T cells were stained with either BCMA-Fc fusion or TACI-Fc fusion separately, along with the marker gene. C. How relative binding to BCMA and TACI was estimated during screening: the slope of fluorescent intensity of CD34 staining versus either BCMA or TACI was calculated. Next, the ratio of this slope to that of wild-type APRIL was calculated. This value was used as the read-out. Figure 10 - Summary of APRIL mutants - single residue mutations. Mutations which show altered binding to BCMA-Fc and TACI-Fc are summarized in comparison with that of wild type APRIL. Figure 11 - Summary of APRIL mutants - multiple residue mutations. Promising mutants were crossed either once or multiply with other mutants and characterized. Altered binding to BCMA-Fc and TACI-Fc is shown here again compared to wild-type APRIL. Figure 12 - BCMA-FC, TACI-FC and APRIL binding of some selected mutants Flow cytometry plots of selected mutants are shown in a table. The first column shows BCMA-Fc staining vs that of CD34. The second column shows TACI-Fc staining vs that of CD34. The third column shows APRIL staining vs that of CD34. The first row shows wild-type APRIL staining as a control. The second row shows CD34 alone control. Figure 13 - Vector co-expressing APRIL based CAR with truncated CD34 A cell line expressing the vector used for screening was incubated with either BCMA- Fc or TACI-Fc and stained with both anti-CD34 and anti-human-Fc PE and FITC conjugated mAbs. The cells were then studied by flow-cytometery. This shows a typical pattern of binding of BCMA and TACI relative to the marker gene CD34. Figure 14A - Schematic diagram illustrating a classical CAR B: Design of the different APRIL-based CARs generated. A signal peptide ias attached to truncated APRIL amino-terminus. This was fused to different spacers: either the hinge, CH2 and CH3 domains of human lgG1 modified with the pvaa mutation described by Hombach et al (2010 Gene Ther. 17:1206-1213) to reduce Fc Receptor binding; the stalk of human CD8a; and the hinge of lgG1. These spacers were connected to a tripartite endodomain containing CD28 transmembrane domain, the OX40 endodomain and the CD3-Zeta endodomain. Figure 15 - Expression of different CARs The receptors were co-expressed with enhanced blue fluorescence protein 2 (eBFP2) using an IRES sequence. Primary human T-cells were transduced and stained with anti-APRIL-biotin/Streptavidin APC. Flow-cytometric analysis was performed. eBFP2 signal is shown against APRIL detection. All three CARs are stably expressed (representative experiment of 3 independent experiments performed using 3 different normal donor T-cells). Figure 16— Chromium release assay Using normal donor peripheral blood T-cells either non-transduced (NT), or transduced to express different spacer CARs as effectors, and SupT1 cells either non-transduced (NT), or transduced to express BCMA or TACI as targets. The T-cells were CD56 depleted to reduce NK activity. This is a representative of three independent experiments and is shown as an example. Cumulative killing data is shown in figure 7A. Specific killing of BCMA and TACI expressing T-cells is seen with no activity against negative target cells. Figure 17 - Interferon-gamma release From a 1 :1 co-culture of effectors and targets is measured by ELISA. The CD8 stalk construct appears to have the best specificity while the hinge construct results in the most Interferon release demonstrates some non-specific activity. This is representative of 3 independent experiments and is shown as an example. Cumulative interferon-gamma release data is shown in figure 7B.

The first panel shows bright BCMA staining in a patient with a plasma cell leukemia (an unusual, advanced and aggressive form of myeloma). The other three cases are clinically and morphologically typical myelomas. They show the intermediate or dim staining typically seen. Staining with isotype control (grey) is superimposed. These are examples of cumulative BCMA expression data shown in figure 2. Figure 19 - Amino acid sequence of APRIL-CARS with a V5 epitope tag.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION APRIL The present invention relates to a variant proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL), which has a higher binding affinity to BCMA than wild-type APRIL; and/or altered binding kinetics compared with wild-type APRIL, and/or a higher BCMA:TACI (transmembrane activator and calcium modulator and cyclophilin ligand interactor) binding ratio than wild-type APRIL. APRIL is also known as TNFSF13. The term "variant" is synonymous with "mutant" or "engineered" and means APRIL comprising one or more mutations, such as substitution(s), addition(s) or deletions(s). Typically the mutation is a substitution. The wild-type sequence of APRIL is available at UNIPROT/075888 and is shown below (SEQ ID No. 1). It is not a classical secreted protein in that it has no signal peptide. It has a furin cleavage site "KQKKQK" (underlined in SEQ ID No. 1). The amino terminus is involved in proteoglycan binding. Kimberley et al (2009, FASEB J 23: 1584-1595) is a study investigating the role of heparin sulphate proteoglycan (HSPG) interaction in APRIL signalling. Point mutations were generated as follows: 1) APRIL-triple (designated WT-triple), containing 3 point mutations: R146S, R189S, H220E; 2) APRIL-HSPG (designated HSPG), containing three point mutations in the hydrophobic motif (QKQKK 13Q); 3) APRIL-HSPG-triple (designated HSPG-triple), in which all 6 amino acids were mutated at both these sites. 4) APRIL-R231A, a form of APRIL capable of binding HSPGs but lacking the ability to bind either TACI or BCMA (Fig. 2) which comprises a key arginine to alanine mutation within the receptor binding region. All mutants except APRIL-R231A retained the ability to bind both BCMA and TACI. The R23IA mutant showed complete loss of binding to both receptors but retained its ability to bind HSPGs. The variant APRIL of the present invention may comprise the BCMA-binding site of APRIL. The variant APRIL may comprise a fragment of APRIL which comprises the BCMA-binding site. The variant APRIL may comprise a truncated APRIL, which lacks the amino terminal end of the molecule. The truncated APRIL may retain BCMA and TACI binding but lose proteoglycan binding. Truncated APRIL can be cleaved at or immediately after the furin cleavage site. Truncated APRIL may lack the amino terminal 116 amino acids from the wild-type APRIL molecule shown as SEQ ID No. 1. Truncated APRIL may comprise the sequence shown as SEQ ID No. 2 (which corresponds to the portion of SEQ ID No. 1 shown in bold) or a variant thereof. This corresponds to the portion of the molecule which is needed for BCMA and TACI binding.

For instance, in some embodiments or applications, the variant APRIL has higher affinity to BCMA than wild-type APRIL. In some embodiments or applications, the variant APRIL has different binding kinetics to BCMA than wild-type APRIL. In some applications, the variant APRIL has a BCMA ACI binding ratio is higher than wild-type APRIL or a combination thereof. The mutant APRIL comprises mutations at one or more of the following positions: A125, V174, T175, M200, P201 , S202, H203, D205 and R206 (shown in grey in SEQ ID No. 1). In particular, the variant APRIL may comprise one of following the single mutations: (SEQ IDs 3 to 26): A125T, V174T, V174G, T175H, T175S, T175G, M200C, M200L, M200G, M200S, M200A, M200N, P201V, P201A, P201 G, P201 R, P201Y, P201W, S202G, S202F, S202D, S202V, S202P, D205P. These mutations have been determined to alter binding to BCMA and TACI in a manner which may be useful to BCMA targeting.

QVVSREGQGRQETLFRCIRSMPEHPDHAYNSCYSAGVFHLHQGDILSVIIPRARAKLNLSPHG TFLGFVKL T CELL ACTIVATION The present invention also provides a bi-specific molecule which comprises (i) a first domain which binds B cell maturation antigen (BCMA) and comprises a mutant APRIL according to the first aspect of the invention; and (ii) a second domain capable of activating a T-cell. The second domain of the molecule of the present invention is capable of activating T cells. T cells have a T cell-receptor (TCR) at the cell surface which recognises antigenic peptides when presented by an MHC molecule on the surface of an antigen presenting cell. Such antigen recognition results in the phosphorylation of immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) by Src family kinases, triggering recruitment of further kinases which results in T cell activation including Ca2+ release. The second domain may cause T cell activation by triggering the same pathway triggered by antigen-specific recognition by the TCR. CLUSTER OF DIFFERENTIATION 3 (CD3) The second domain of the bi-specific molecule of the invention may bind CD3. CD3 is a protein complex composed of four distinct chains: a CD3y chain, a CD36 chain, and two CD3e chains. CD3 associates with the T-cell receptor (TCR) and the ζ- chain on the surface of a T cell to generate an activation signal. The TCR, ζ-chain, and CD3 molecule together comprise the TCR complex. Clustering of CD3 on T cells, e.g. by immobilized anti-CD3-antibodies, leads to T cell activation similar to the engagement of the T cell receptor, but independent from its clone typical specificity. Due to its central role in modulating T cell activity, there have been attempts to develop molecules that are capable of binding TCR/CD3. Much of this work has focused on the generation of antibodies that are specific for the human CD3 antigen. The second domain may comprise an antibody or part thereof which specifically binds CD3, such as OKT3, WT32, anti-leu-4, UCHT-1 , SPV-3TA, TR66, SPV-T3B or affinity tuned variants thereof. As used herein, "antibody" means a polypeptide having an antigen binding site which comprises at least one complementarity determining region CDR. The antibody may comprise 3 CDRs and have an antigen binding site which is equivalent to that of a domain antibody (dAb). The antibody may comprise 6 CDRs and have an antigen binding site which is equivalent to that of a classical antibody molecule. The remainder of the polypeptide may be any sequence which provides a suitable scaffold for the antigen binding site and displays it in an appropriate manner for it to bind the antigen. The antibody may be a whole immunoglobulin molecule or a part thereof such as a Fab, F(ab)'2, Fv, single chain Fv (ScFv) fragment, Nanobody or single chain variable domain (which may be a VH or VL chain, having 3 CDRs). The antibody may be a Afunctional antibody. The antibody may be non-human, chimeric, humanised or fully human. Alternatively the second domain may comprise a CD3-binding molecule which is not derived from or based on an immunoglobulin. A number of "antibody mimetic" designed repeat proteins (DRPs) have been developed to exploit the binding abilities of non-antibody polypeptides. Such molecules include ankyrin or leucine-rich repeat proteins e.g. DARPins (Designed Ankyrin Repeat Proteins), Anticalins, Avimers and Versabodies. The second domain of the bi-specific molecule of the invention may comprise all or part of the monoclonal antibody OKT3, which was the first monoclonal antibody approved by the FDA. OKT3 is available from ATCC CRL 8001. The antibody sequences are published in US 7,381 ,803. The second domain may comprise one or more CDRs from OKT3. The second binding domain may comprise CDR3 from the heavy-chain of OKT3 and/or CDR3 from the light chain of OKT3. The second binding domain may comprise all 6 CDRs from OKT3, as shown below.

BI-SPECIFIC T-CELL ENGAGERS (BITES) BiTES are a new class of therapeutics which approximate a target antigen with the T- cell receptor (TCR). The original design was of two scFvs connected together by a linker with one scFv targeting antigen and the other activating a T-cell. BiTEs are commonly made by fusing an anti-CD3 scFv to an anti-target antigen scFv via a short five residue peptide linker (GGGGS). In 1995, a tandem scFv targeting EpCAM (epithelial 17-1 A antigen) and human CD3 in CHO cells was produced. This new kind of bi-specific antibody format proved to be highly cytotoxic at nanomolar concentrations against various cell lines, using unstimulated human PBMCs in the absence of co-signaling. Later, a fusion between a murine anti-CD19 scFv and a murine anti-CD3 scFv was created. This molecule demonstrated outstanding in vitro properties, including efficient cytotoxicity, without the need of co-signaling (e.g., through CD28). Blinatumomab, a murine anti-human CD3 χ anti-human CD19 was the first BiTE developed and is the most advanced BiTE in clinical trials. The candidate is being studied as a treatment of lymphoma and leukemia. MT110, an anti-human EpCAM χ anti-human CD3 TaFv, was the second BiTE tested in clinical trial and the first directed to a wide spectrum of solid tumors. In vitro characterizations of MT110 have recapitulated the results obtained with MT103 on tumor cell lines, thereby demonstrating the generality of the BiTE format. MT1 10 is currently in clinical trial for lung, colorectal and gastrointestinal cancer patients. The bi-specific molecule of the present invention is based on a BiTE-like format, but instead of having a scFv or other antibody-based binding domain binding the target antigen, it has a binding domain based on the ligand for BCMA, namely APRIL. This "APRILiTE" format is favourable compared with a classical scFv-scFv format for various reasons: (a) a single domain - scFv fusion is likely more stable and easier to make than other formats; (b) the assembly of BCMA and APRIL on the cell surface require trimerization of each binding partner. This induces clustering of T-cell activating domain at a protein level making the protein highly specific and highly potent. The molecule of the present invention may comprise one of the following amino acid sequences, but with a mutation at one of the following positions in the portion of the sequence corresponding to APRIL (with reference to the position numbering shown in SEQ ID No. 1 ): S202, P201 , M200, T175, V174, A125, H203, D205 and R206: SEQ ID No. 66 METDTLLLWVLLLWVPGSTGQVQLQQSGAELARPGASVKMSCKASGYTFTRYTMH WVKQRPGQGLEWIGYINPSRGYTNYNQKFKDKATLTTDKSSSTAYMQLSSLTSEDS AVYYCARYYDDHYCLDYWGQGTTLTVSSSGGGGSGGGGSGGGGSQIVLTQSPAI SASPGEKVTMTCSASSSVSYMNWYQQKSGTSPKRWIYDTSKLASGVPAHFRGS GSGTSYSLTISGMEAEDAATYYCQQWSSNPFTFGSGTKLEINRSDPAEPKSPDKTH TCPPCPKDPKSGGGGSVLHLVPINATSKDDSDVTEVMWQPALRRGRGLQAQGYGV RIQDAGVYLLYSQVLFQDVTFTMGQWSREGQGRQETLFRCIRSMPSHPDRAYNSC YSAGVFHLHQGDILSVIIPRARAKLNLSPHGTFLGFVKL SEQ ID No. 67 METDTLLLVWLLLV PGSTGQVQLQQSGAELARPGASVKMSCKASGYTFTRYTMH WVKQRPGQGLEWIGYINPSRGYTNYNQKFKDKATLTTDKSSSTAYMQLSSLTSEDS AVYYCARYYDDHYCLDYWGQGTTLTVSSSGGGGSGGGGSGGGGSQIVLTQSPAI MSASPGEKVTMTCSASSSVSYMNWYQQKSGTSPKRWIYDTSKLASGVPAHFRGS GSGTSYSLTISGMEAEDAATYYCQQWSSNPFTFGSGTKLEINRSDPTTTPAPRPPT PAPTIASQPLSLRPEACRPAAGGAVHTRGLDFACDSGGGGSVLHLVPINATSKDDS DVTEVMWQPALRRGRGLQAQGYGVRIQDAGVYLLYSQVLFQDVTFTMGQWSRE GQGRQETLFRCIRSMPSHPDRAYNSCYSAGVFHLHQGDILSVIIPRARAKLNLSPHG TFLGFVKL SEQ ID No. 68 MGTSLLCWMALCLLGADHADGVLHLVPINATSKDDSDVTEVMWQPALRRGRGLQA QGYGVRIQDAGVYLLYSQVLFQDVTFTMGQWSREGQGRQETLFRCIRSMPSHPD RAYNSCYSAGVFHLHQGDILSVIIPRARAKLNLSPHGTFLGFVKLSGGGSDPTTTPAP RPPTPAPTIASQPLSLRPEACRPAAGGAVHTRGLDFACDSGGGGSQVQLQQSGAE LARPGASVKMSCKASGYTFTRYTMHWVKQRPGQGLEWIGYINPSRGYTNYNQKFK DKATLTTDKSSSTAYMQLSSLTSEDSAVYYCARYYDDHYCLDYWGQGTTLTVSSSG GGGSGGGGSGGGGSQIVLTQSPAIMSASPGEKVTMTCSASSSVSYMNWYQQKSG TSPKRWIYDTSKLASGVPAHFRGSGSGTSYSLTISGMEAEDAATYYCQQWSSNPFT FGSGTKLEINRS The molecule of the invention may comprise a variant of the sequence shown as SEQ ID No. 66, 67 or 68 having at least 80, 85, 90, 95, 98 or 99% sequence identity, provided that the variant sequence is a molecule as defined in the first aspect of the invention, i.e. a bi-specific molecule which comprises: (i) a first domain which binds B cell maturation antigen (BCMA) and comprises at least part of a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL); and (ii) a second domain capable of activating a T cell. SIGNAL PEPTIDE The bi-specific molecule of the invention may comprise a signal peptide to aid in its production. The signal peptide may cause the bi-specific molecule to be secreted by a host cell, such that the bi-specific molecule can be harvested from the host cell supernatant. The core of the signal peptide may contain a long stretch of hydrophobic amino acids that has a tendency to form a single alpha-helix. The signal peptide may begin with a short positively charged stretch of amino acids, which helps to enforce proper topology of the polypeptide during translocation. At the end of the signal peptide there is typically a stretch of amino acids that is recognized and cleaved by signal peptidase. Signal peptidase may cleave either during or after completion of translocation to generate a free signal peptide and a mature protein. The free signal peptides are then digested by specific proteases. The signal peptide may be at the amino terminus of the molecule. The bi-specific molecule may have the general formula: Signal peptide - first domain - second domain. The signal peptide may comprise the SEQ ID No. 69 or 70 or a variant thereof having 5, 4, 3, 2 or 1 amino acid mutations (insertions, substitutions or additions) provided that the signal peptide still functions to cause secretion of the bi-specific molecule. SEQ ID No. 69: METDTLLLVWLLLWVPGSTG SEQ ID No. 70: MGTSLLCWMALCLLGADHADG The signal peptides of SEQ ID No. 69 and 70 are compact and highly efficient. They are predicted to give about 95% cleavage after the terminal glycine, giving efficient removal by signal peptidase. SPACER The molecule of the present invention may comprise a spacer sequence to connect the first domain with the second domain and spatially separate the two domains. The spacer sequence may, for example, comprise an lgG1 hinge or a CD8 stalk. The linker may alternatively comprise an alternative linker sequence which has similar length and/or domain spacing properties as an lgG1 hinge or a CD8 stalk. The spacer may be a short spacer, for example a spacer which comprises less than 100, less than 80, less than 60 or less than 45 amino acids. The spacer may be or comprise an lgG1 hinge or a CD8 stalk or a modified version thereof. Examples of amino acid sequences for these linkers are given below: SEQ ID No. 71 (lgG1 hinge): AEPKSPDKTHTCPPCPKDPKSGGGGS SEQ ID No. 72 (CD8 stalk): TTTPAPRPPTPAPTIASQPLSLRPEACRPAAGGAVHTRGLDFACD The CD8 stalk has a sequence such that it may induce the formation of homodimers (see Figure 2). If this is not desired, one or more cysteine residues may be substituted or removed from the CD8 stalk sequence. The bispecific molecule of the invention may include a spacer which comprises or consists of the sequence shown as SEQ ID No. 72 or a variant thereof having at least 80, 85, 90, 95, 98 or 99% sequence identity, provided that the variant sequence is a molecule which causes approximately equivalent spacing of the first and second domains and/or that the variant sequence causes homodimerisation of the bi-specific molecule. The molecule of the invention may have the general formula: Signal peptide - first domain - spacer - second domain. The spacer may also comprise one or more linker motifs to introduce a chain-break. A chain break separate two distinct domains but allows orientation in different angles. Such sequences include the sequence SDP, and the sequence SGGGSDP (SEQ ID No. 73). The linker may comprise a serine-glycine linker, such as SGGGGS (SEQ ID No. 74). CHIMERIC ANTIGEN RECEPTORS (CARS) Chimeric antigen receptors (CARs), also known as chimeric T cell receptors, artificial T cell receptors and chimeric immunoreceptors, are engineered receptors, which graft an arbitrary specificity onto an immune effector cell. In a classical CAR (Figure 3), the specificity of a monoclonal antibody is grafted on to a T cell or NK cell. CAR- encoding nucleic acids may be introduced into T cells or NK cells using, for example, retroviral vectors. In this way, a large number of cancer-specific T cells or NK cells can be generated for adoptive cell transfer. Early clinical studies of this approach have shown efficacy in some cancers, primarily when targeting the pan-B-cell antigen CD19 to treat B-cell malignancies. The target-antigen binding domain of a CAR is commonly fused via a spacer and transmembrane domain to a signaling endodomain. When the CAR binds the target- antigen, this results in the transmission of an activating signal to the T-cell it is expressed on. The CAR may comprise: (i) a variant APRIL, acting as the B cell maturation antigen (BCMA)-binding domain; (ii) a optional spacer (iii) a transmembrane domain; and (iv) an endodomain. The endodomain may comprise or associate with an intracellular T-cell signalling domain. The CAR of the present invention may comprise one of the following amino acid sequences, but with a mutation at one of the following positions in the portion of the sequence corresponding to APRIL (with reference to the position numbering shown in SEQ ID No. 1): S202, P201 , M200, T175, V174, A125, H203, D205 and R206: SEQ ID No.75 (dAPRIL-HCH2CH3pvaa-CD280XZ) METDTLLLWVLLLWVPGSTGSVLHLVPINATSKDDSDVTEVMWQPALRRGRGLQAQGYGVRIQ DAGVYLLYSQVLFQDVTFTMGQVVSREGQGRQETLFRCIRSMPSHPDRAYNSCYSAGVFHLHQ GDILSVIIPRARAKLNLSPHGTFLGFVKLSGGGSDPAEPKSPDKTHTCPPCPAPPVAGPSVFL FPPKPKDTLMIARTPEVTCWVDVSHEDPEVKFNWYVDGVEVHNAKTKPREEQYNSTYRWSV LTVLHQDWLNGKEYKCKVSN ALPAPIEK ISKAKGQPREPQVYTLPPSRDELTKNQVSLTCL VKGFYPSDIAVEWESNGQPENNYKTTPPVLDSDGSFFLYSKLTVDKSRWQQGNVFSCSVMHEA LHNHYTQKSLSLSPGKKDPKFWVLWVGGVLACYSLLVTVAFIIFWVRSKRSRLLHSDYMNMT PRRPGPTRKHYQPYAPPRDFAAYRSRDQRLPPDAHKPPGGGSFRTPIQEEQADAHSTLAKIRV KFSRSADAPAYQQGQNQLYNELNLGRREEYDVLDKRRGRDPEMGGKPRRKNPQEGLYNELQKD KMAEAYSEIGMKGERRRGKGHDGLYQGLSTATKDTYDALHMQALPPR SEQ ID No.76 (dAPRIL-CD8STK-CD280XZ) METDTLLLWVLLLWVPGSTGSVLHLVPINATSKDDSDVTEVMWQPALRRGRGLQAQGYGVRIQ DAGVYLLYSQVLFQDVTFTMGQVVSREGQGRQETLFRCIRSMPSHPDRAYNSCYSAGVFHLHQ GDILSVIIPRARAKLNLSPHGTFLGFVKLSGGGSDPTTTPAPRPPTPAPTIASQPLSLRPEAC RPAAGGAVHTRGLDFACDIFWVLVVVGGVLACYSLLVTVAFIIFWVRSKRSRLLHSDYMNMTP RRPGPTRKHYQPYAPPRDFAAYRSRDQRLPPDAHKPPGGGSFRTPIQEEQADAHSTLAKIRVK FSRSADAPAYQQGQNQLYNELNLGRREEYDVLDKRRGRDPEMGGKPRRKNPQEGLYNELQKD MAEAYSEIGMKGERRRGKGHDGLYQGLSTATKDTYDALHMQALPPR SEQ ID No.77 (dAPRIL-HNG-CD280XZ) METDTLLLWVLLLWVPGSTGSVLHLVPINATSKDDSDVTEVMWQPALRRGRGLQAQGYGVRIQ DAGVYLLYSQVLFQDVTFTMGQVVSREGQGRQETLFRCIRSMPSHPDRAYNSCYSAGVFHLHQ GDILS IIPRARAKLNLSPHGTFLGFVKLSGGGSDPAEPKSPDKTHTCPPCPKDPKFWVLWV GGVLACYSLLVTVAFIIFWVRSKRSRLLHSDYMNMTPRRPGPTRKHYQPYAPPRDFAAYRSRD QRLPPDAH PPGGGSFRTPIQEEQADAHSTLAKIRVKFSRSADAPAYQQGQNQLYNELNLGRR EEYDVLDKRRGRDPE GGKPRRKNPQEGLYNELQKDKMAEAYSEIGMKGERRRGKGHDGLYQG LSTATKDTYDALHMQALPPR SEQ ID No.78 (dAPRIL-HCH2CH3pvaa-CD280XZ) MGTSLLCWMALCLLGADHADGKPIPNPLLGLDSTSGGGGSVLHLVPINATSKDDSDVTEVMWQ PALRRGRGLQAQGYGVRI QDAGVYLL YS QVL FQDVT FT GQWS REGQGRQETLFRC I RSMPS HPDRAYNSCYSAGVFHLHQGDILSVIIPRARAKLNLSPHGTFLGFVKLSGGGSDPAEPKSPDK THTCPPCPAPPVAGPSVFLFPPKPKDTLMIARTPEVTCVVVDVSHEDPEVKFNWYVDGVEVHN AKTKPREEQYNSTYRWSVLTVLHQDWLNGKEYKCKVSNKALPAPIEKTISKAKGQPREPQVY TLPPSRDELTKNQVSLTCLVKGFYPSDIAVE ESNGQPENNYKTTPPVLDSDGSFFLYSKLTV DKSRWQQGNVFSCSVMHEALHNHYTQKSLSLSPGKKDPKFWVLWVGGVLACYSLLVTVAFII FWVRSKRSRLLHS DYMNMTPRRPGPTRKHYQPYAPPRDFAAYRSRDQRLPPDAHKPPGGGS F TP I QEEQADAHSTLAKIRVKFSRSADAPAYQQGQNQLYNELNLGRREEYDVLDKRRGRDPE G GKPRRKNPQEGLYNELQKDKMAEAYSE I GMKGERRRGKGHDGLYQGLSTATKDTYDALHMQAL PPR SEQ ID No. 79 (dAPRIL-CD8STK-CD280XZ) MGTSLLCWMALCLLGADHADGKPI PNPLLGLDST SGGGGSVLHLVPINATSKDDS DVTEV WQ PALRRGRGLQAQGYGVRI QDAGVYLLYSQVLFQDVTFTMGQVVSREGQGRQETLFRCIRSMPS HPDRAYNS CYSAGVFHLHQGDILSVI I PRARAKLNLS PHGTFLGFVKLSGGGSDPTTTPAPRP PT PAPTIASQPLSLRPEACRPAAGGAVHTRGLDFACDI FWVLVVVGGVLACYSLLVTVAFI I F WVRS RSRLLHS DYMNMT PRRPGPTRKHYQPYAPPRDFAAYRSRDQRLPPDAHKPPGGGS FRT PIQEEQADAHSTLAKIRVKFSRSADAPAYQQGQNQLYNELNLGRREEYDVLDKRRGRDPEMGG KPRRKNPQEGLYNELQKDKMAEAYSEI GMKGERRRGKGHDGLYQGLSTATKDTYDALHMQALP PR SEQ ID No. 80 (dAPRIL-HNG-CD280XZ) MGTSLLCWMALCLLGADHADGKPI PNPLLGLDSTSGGGGSVLHLVP INATSKDDS DVTEVMWQ PALRRGRGLQAQGYGVRIQDAGVYLLYSQVLFQDVTFTMGQVVSREGQGRQETLFRCIRSMPS HPDRAYNSCYSAGVFHLHQGDI LSVI I PRARAKLNLS PHGTFLGFVKLSGGGS DPAEPKS PDK THTCPPCPKDPKFWVLVVVGGVLACYSLLVTVAFI I FWVRSKRSRLLHS DYMNMTPRRPGPTR KHYQPYAPPRDFAAYRSRDQRLPPDAHKPPGGGS FRT PIQEEQADAHSTLAKIRVKFSRSADA PAYQQGQNQLYNELNLGRREEYDVLDKRRGRDPEMGGKPRRKNPQEGLYNELQKDKMAEAYSE I GMKGE RRRGKGHDGL YQGLS TATKDT YDALHMQAL PPR The molecule of the invention may comprise a variant of the sequence shown as SEQ ID No. 75, 76, 77, 78, 79 or 80 having at least 80, 85, 90, 95, 98 or 99% sequence identity, provided that the variant sequence is a molecule as defined in the first aspect of the invention, i.e. a CAR which comprises: (i) a BC A-binding domain; (ii) a optional spacer domain (iii) a transmembrane domain; and (iv) an endodomain; and comprises a mutation at one of the following positions in the portion of the sequence corresponding to APRIL (with reference to the position numbering shown in SEQ ID No. 1): S202, P201 , M200, T175, V174, A125, H203, D205 and R206.

The invention will now be further described by way of Examples, which are meant to serve to assist one of ordinary skill in the art in carrying out the invention and are not intended in any way to limit the scope of the invention. EXAMPLES Example 1 - characterisation of BCMA as a target for Myeloma Primary myeloma cells were isolated by performing a CD138 immunomagnetic selection on fresh bone marrow samples from Multiple myeloma patients that were known to have frank disease. These cells were stained with the BCMA specific J6MO mAb (GSK) which was conjugated to PE. At the same time, a standard of beads with known numbers of binding sites was generated using the PE Quantibrite bead kit (Becton Dickenson) as per the manufacturer's instructions. The BCMA copy number on myeloma cells could be derived by correlating the mean-fluorescent intensity from the myeloma cells with the standard curve derived from the beads. It was found that the range of BCMA copy number on a myeloma cell surface is low: at 348.7-4268.4 BCMA copies per cell with a mean of 1181 and a median of 1084.9 (Figure 2). This is considerably lower than e.g. CD19 and GD2, classic targets for CARs. Presence of BCMA expression on primary myeloma cells was also confirmed with the Vicky-1 antibody (Abeam Ab17323), examples of which are shown in figure 18. Example 2 - Design and construction of APRIL based CARs. APRIL in its natural form is a secreted type II protein. The use of APRIL as a BCMA binding domain for a CAR requires conversion of this type II secreted protein to a type I membrane bound protein and for this protein to be stable and to retain binding to BCMA in this form. To generate candidate molecules, the extreme amino-terminus of APRIL was deleted to remove binding to proteoglycans. Next, a signal peptide was added to direct the nascent protein to the endoplasmic reticulum and hence the cell surface. Also, because the nature of spacer used can alter the function of a CAR, three different spacer domains were tested: an APRIL based CAR was generated comprising (i) a human lgG1 spacer altered to remove Fc binding motifs; (ii) a CD8 stalk; and (iii) the lgG1 hinge alone (cartoon in Figure 4 and amino acid sequences in Figure 5, and also amino acid sequences in figure 19 which differ from the sequences in figure 5 by having a different signal peptide and the V5 epitope tag). These CARs were expressed in a bicistronic retroviral vector (Figure 6A) so that a marker protein - truncated CD34 could be co-expressed as a convenient marker gene. Example 3 - Expression and function of APRIL based CARs. The aim of this study was to test whether the APRIL based CARs which had been constructed were expressed on the cell surface and whether APRIL had folded to form the native protein. T-cells were transduced with these different CAR constructs and stained using a commercially available anti-APRIL mAb, along with staining for the marker gene and analysed by flow-cytometry. The results of this experiment are shown in Figure 6B where APRIL binding is plotting against marker gene fluorescence. These data show that in this format, the APRIL based CARs are expressed on the cell surface and APRIL folds sufficiently to be recognized by an anti-APRIL mAb. Next, it was determined whether APRIL in this format could recognize BCMA and TACI. Recombinant BCMA and TACI were generated as fusions with mouse lgG2a- Fc. These recombinant proteins were incubated with the transduced T-cells. After this, the cells were washed and stained with an anti-mouse fluorophore conjugated antibody and an antibody to detect the marker gene conjugated to a different fluorophore. The cells were analysed by flow cytometry and the results are presented in Figure 6C. The different CARs were able to bind both BCMA and TACI. Surprisingly, the CARs were better able to bind BCMA than TACI. Also, surprisingly CARs with a CD8 stalk or lgG1 hinge spacer were better able to bind BCMA and TACI than CAR with an Fc spacer. Example 4 - APRIL based chimeric antigen receptors are active against BCMA expressing cells T-cells from normal donors were transduced with the different APRIL CARs and tested against SupT1 cells either wild-type, or engineered to express BCMA and TACI. Several different assays were used to determine function. A classical chromium release assay was performed. Here, the target cells (the SupT1 cells) were labelled with 51 Cr and mixed with effectors (the transduced T-cells) at different ratio. Lysis of target cells was determined by counting 5 Cr in the co-culture supernatant (Figure 6A shows the cumulative data, example data from a single assay with different effector:target ratios is shown in figure 16). In addition, supernatant from T-cells cultured 1 : 1 with SupT1 cells was assayed by ELISA for Interferon-gamma (Figure 6B shows cumulative data, example data from a single assay is shown in figure 17). Measurement of T-cell expansion after one week of co-culture with SupT1 cells was also performed (Figure 6C). T-cells were counted by flow-cytometry calibrated with counting beads. These experimental data show that APRIL based CARs can kill BCMA expressing targets. Further, these data show that CARs based on the CD8 stalk or lgG1 hinge performed better than the Fc-pvaa based CAR. Example 5 - APRIL based CARs are able to kill primary myeloma cells The above data are encouraging since they demonstrate that it in principle, it is possible to make an APRIL based CAR. However, since most primary myeloma cells express a low number of BCMA molecules on their surface, it was investiagated whether such an APRIL based CAR would cause killing of primary myeloma cells, particularly in cases with low-density expression. Three cases were selected which represented the range of BCMA expression described in Figure 2: the first had dim expression (lower than mean); the second case had intermediate expression (approximately mean expression) and the third had bright (above mean expression). Figure 8 shows a histogram of BCMA staining against isotype control for all three cases on the left to illustrate BCMA expression. Since when comparing APRIL based CARs with different spacers it had been determined that CARs with CD8 stalk spacer and lgG1 hinge spacer performed better than the Fc-pvaa spacered CAR, in this assay, only the CD8 stalk and hinge APRIL CARs were tested. On the left, survival of myeloma cells compared with starting numbers is shown at day 3 and day 6 after a 1 :1 co-culture of myeloma cells and CAR T-cells. By day 6, >95% of the myeloma cells were eliminated, including those with dim BCMA expression. Dim BCMA expressing myeloma cells can be targeted by the APRIL CARs albeit with a slower tempo of killing than higher expressers. Example 6 - Construction of a series of "APRILITES" The present inventors have constructed a series of bi-specific engagers which connect a scFv from OKT3 to the extracellular domain of APRIL, as shown in Figure 24A. Several design considerations were made during the construction of these molecules: (a) the proteoglycan binding amino terminus of APRIL was truncated to prevent non-specific binding; (b) in constructs 4, 5 and 6, a signal peptide was attached to the mature ectodomain of APRIL; (c) the OKT3 was re-formatted as a scFv with a linker connecting the heavy and light chain variable regions; (d) various different spacers were tried between the scFv and APRIL. The various different formats were as follows: (1) OKT3 scFv connected to truncated APRIL by the lgG1 hinge; (2) OKT3 scFv connected to truncated APRIL via a (SGGGGS)3 linker; (3) OKT3 scFv connected to truncated APRIL via the CD8 stalk; (4) truncated APRIL connected to OKT3 scFv via an lgG1 hinge; (5) truncated APRIL connected to the OKT3 scFv via a (SGGGGS)3 linker; and (6) truncated APRIL connected to the OKT3 scFv via a CD8 spacer. Constructs (3) and (6) form homodimers through disulphide bonds in the CD8 spacer. The amino acid sequences for constructs(l), (3) and (6) are shown in Figure 30. Example 7 - Expression of APRILiTEs in 293T cells 293 T cells were transfected with expression plasmids coding for the APRILiTE constructs listed above. Supernatant from the 293T cells was run on an acrylamide gel and proteins transferred to a membrane. The membrane was then stained with an antibody which recognized APRIL. The results are shown in Figure 25. Proteins 1 , 3 and 6 were detected at the expected molecular weight. Proteins 2, 4 and 5 were not detected, indicating that these configurations are unstable. Example 8 - Binding to TCR and BCMA It was then investigated whether these proteins could bind either the T-cell receptor (TCR) on one end, and BCMA on the other end. Supernatant from 293T cells transfected was used to stain Jurkat T-cells and a Jurkat T-cell clone which has TCRap knocked out. This demonstrates the APRILiTE binds the TCR (Figure 26b). SupT1 cells engineered to express BCMA and SupT1 cells engineered to express TACI were then stained with the above supernatant, using a secondary anti-APRIL biotin followed by streptavidin PE. The results are shown in Figure 26a. It was found that APRILiTES 1 ,3 and 6 bound BCMA, and TACI to a lesser extent. Example 9 - Stable APRILiTEs trigger IFNy release Normal donor T-cells were cultivated 1 :1 with different SupTls. The SupTIs used were either non-transduced, engineered to express BCMA or engineered to express TACI. The results are shown in Figure 27. It was found that T-cells only released IFNy in the presence of either APRILiTE when exposed with SupT1-cells engineered with BCMA or TACI. The response to BCMA was greater than that with TACI. Example 10 - Stable APRILITEs trigger T-cell mediated killing of BCMA+ targets T-cells were cultured 1 :1 with wild-type SupTI cells, SupTI cells expressing BCMA and SupTI cells expressing TACI in the absence of or in the presence of APRILiTEs 1 ,3 and 6. The results are shown in Figure 28. The remaining T-cells are shown as a proportion of SupTI cells present in the condition with no APRILiTE added. Example 11 - Investigating BCMA expression on primary myeloma cells Four different myeloma samples were stained with the rat anti-human BCMA mAb Vickyl . The results are shown in Figure 29. In clinically and morphologically typical myelomas (panels 2 to 4) intermediate or dim staining is seen. Example 12 - Investigating the effect of APRILiTEs on primary Myeloma Cells Left over material from a diagnostic bone-marrow aspirate from two patients with known multiple BCMA+ myeloma was used. A CD138 magnetic bead selection was performed to purify myeloma cells from the aspirate. These cells were rested in complete culture medium for 48 hours and staining for BCMA was performed to check that they were in fact BCMA positive. It was found that the myeloma cells express BCMA but at low levels (Figure 31 ). Next, normal donor peripheral mononuclear cells which had been stimulated using OKT3 and CD28.2 were CD56 depleted to remove NK cells. A 1 :1 co-culture of CD56 depleted PBMCs and CD 138 selected primary Myeloma cells were performed in the absence or presence of either APRILITE#03 and #06. Insufficient material was present to test APRILiTE#01. The co-cultures were observed by microscopy. Interferon gamma release into supernatant was measured by ELISA. Survival of myeloma cells was measured by Annexin V/PI staining and bead-count controlled flow-cytometry. Clear clumping (a sign of T-cell activation) was seen upon co-culture (see Figure 32). Interferon-gamma release was observed in conditions where PBMCs were cultured with Myeloma cells in the presence of the APRILiTES, albeit at less absolute amounts than when co-cultured with SupTI . BCMA cells (Figure 33). Killing of Myeloma cells was also observed when PBMCs were present with APRILiTE after 6 days of co- culture (Figure 34). These findings demonstrate that APRILiTEs cause T cell activation in the presence of primary myeloma cells at a level sufficient to cause T-cell mediated killing of the myeloma cells. Example 13 - Testing the APRILiTES in vivo A huSCID model is used: NSG (nod-scid gamma, NOD-scid IL2Rgammanu") mice are xenografted with a myeloma cell line which expresses typical levels of BCMA. These lines are engineered to express firefly Luciferase to measure disease by bioluminescence imaging. Normal donor PBMCs are administered via the tail vein during concomitant intraperitoneal administration of APRILiTEs. The following are sequentially measured (1) serum levels of APRILiTEs; (2) serum levels of human Interferon-gamma; (3) peripheral blood T-cell expansion, engraftment and activation by flow cytometry; (4) Bioluminescence measurement of tumour. At take-down, the following are measured: (1) tumour burden by marrow histology; (2) T-cell proliferation and engraftment by flow cytometry of marrow, spleen, blood and lymph nodes; and (3) the remaining tissues are examined grossly and immunohistochemically for any toxicity. Example 14 - Production of APRIL mutants particularly suited to targeting BCMA The aim was to generate APRIL mutants whose binding may be more suitable for CAR. Using crystallographic data described by Hymowitz et al, 2004, The Journal of biological chemistry: Volume 280; Issue 8; Pages 7218-27 and from RCSB deposits 1XU1 and 1XU2, several residues were selected which may alter binding to BCMA or may increase specificity to BCMA over TACI. A strategy to identify mutations at these residues with useful properties is outlined in Figure 31 B. Using splicing by overlap PCR with oligonucleotides degenerate over codons for mutation, libraries of mutant APRILs were generated randomized over key mutants. These libraries were ligated into a scaffold shown in Figure 31A which presents APRIL on a CD8 stalk and co-expresses CD34 with a foot-and-mouth 2A peptide. Typical expression from this construct is shown in Figure 9. These ligation products were transformed into competent bacteria, single colonies picked, individually expanded and the DNA was extracted and transfected into 293T cells. The 293T cells were subsequently incubated separately with either recombinant human BCMA-Fc or TACI-Fc. Cells were then washed and secondarily stained with Jackson polyclonal anti-Fc Alexa fluor 488 and the marker gene stained with anti- CD34 APC. The APRIL mutants were screened in this manner in batches with wild- type APRIL and a CD34 only as controls in each batch. CD34 +ve events were split into 4 gates numbered as shown in Figure 31. The Alexa fluor 488 median fluorescence index(MFI) was calculated for each gate and average gradient between MFI of various gates was calculated using the formula: [(MFI.1 -MFI.2)+ (MFI.2- MFI.3)+ (MFI.3-MFI.4)]/3 (illustrated in Figure 31 C). In this way, an average MFI gradient was calculated for binding to BCMA and TACI for each APRIL mutant. For each mutant, the average MFI gradient of BCMA and TACI binding was converted to a ratio of binding to APRIL WT control in each batch. Plasmids giving rise to potentially useful mutants were sequenced by capillary sequencing. The results of this initial screening are summarized in Table 1 and illustrated in Figure 10. Classes of mutants were then combined together by a similar strategy to that outlined for single mutants, but mutant APRIL coding plasmid was used as template to introduce further mutations. The results of this work are summarized in Table 2 and illustrated in Figure 1 1. It was possible to generate mutants with much higher affinity to BCMA than wild-type: for instance mutant D205R, R206G; we were able to generate mutants with BCMA binding equal to wild-type APRIL but no binding to TACI - for instance mutant T175A, S202P. We were also able to generate mutants with lower binding to BCMA than wild-type (which may paradoxically improve recognition of low-density antigen), but no binding of TACI - for instance mutant V174T, T175A, M200G, S202E. Larger scale, higher quality plasmid DNA from the most promising mutants was generated and repeat transfection and expression data was performed. These data are shown in Figure 2. Example 15 - Secreted and truncated APRIL fused to an Fc spacer recognizes BCMA and TACI In order to investigate whether truncated APRIL in a CAR format (i.e. fused to a trans- membrane domain and anchored to a cell membrane) could bind BCMA and TACI, a basic CAR was engineered in frame with the self-cleaving foot and mouth disease 2A peptide with truncated CD34, as a convenient marker gene. A stable SUPT1 cell line was established which expresses this construct. Secreted truncated BCMA and TACI fused to human (and other species, not shown) Ig Fc domain was also generated and recombinant protein produced. It was shown that both BCMA-Fc and TACI-Fc bind the engineered SUPT1 cell line. Only cells expressing the CD34 marker gene were found to bind BCMA-Fc and TACI-Fc (Figure 9). Example 16 - APRIL based chimeric antigen receptors are stably expressed on the surface of T-cells The CAR spacer domain can alter sensitivity and specificity. Three versions of an APRIL-based CAR were generated with three spacer domains: (i) a human lgG1 spacer altered to remove Fc binding motifs; (ii) a CD8 stalk; and (iii) the lgG1 hinge alone (Figure 14B). Primary human T-cells were transduced with these different CARs and stained using a commercially available anti-APRIL mAb (Figure 15). Example 17 - APRIL based chimeric antigen receptors are active against cognate target expressing cells T-cells from normal donors were transduced with the different APRIL CARs and tested against SupT1 cells either wild-type, or engineered to express BCMA and TACI. Several different assays were used to determine function. A classical chromium release assay was performed. Here, the target cells (the SupT1 cells) were labelled with 51 Cr and mixed with effectors (the transduced T-cells) at different ratio. Lysis of target cells was determined by counting 5 Cr in the co-culture supernatant (Figure 16). In addition, supernatant from T-cells cultured 1 :1 with SupT1 cells was assayed by ELISA for Interferon-gamma (Figure 17). Measurement of T-cell expansion after one week of co-culture with SupT1 cells was also performed. T-cells were counted by flow-cytometry calibrated with counting beads. Initial data (not shown) appears to indicate that the CD8 stalk based construct results in more T-cell proliferation than the other constructs. Example 18 - Production of BCMA-specific APRIL mutants APRIL mutants were generated using degenerate primers targeting specific codons. The codons were identified through in silico analysis of APRIL-BCMA and APRIL- TACI binding. From this analysis, residues that seemed involved in TACI binding but not BCMA binding were targeted. Plasmids were produced encoding (i) cell surface expressed CD34 and (ii) the APRIL mutants. The plasmids were then transformed into bacteria, plated, single colonies picked, individually expanded and the DNA was extracted and transfected into 293T cells. T cells expressing a single APRIL mutant and CD34 were each aliquoted into two and incubated separately with 0.1 pg RND human BCMA-hFc or TACI-hFc chimera. Cells were then washed and secondarily stained with Jackson polyclonal ahFc Alexa fluor 488 and BD aCD34 APC. The APRIL mutants were screened in this manner in batches with wild-type APRIL as a control in each batch. CD34 +ve events were split into 4 gates numbered as shown in Figure 9. The Alexa fluor 488 median fluorescence index(MFI) was calculated for each gate and average gradient between MFI of various gates was calculated using the formula: [(MFI.1-MFI.2)+ (MFI.2-MFI.3)+ (MFI.3-MFI.4)]/3. In this way, an average MFI gradient was calculated for binding to BCMA and TACI for each APRIL mutant. For each mutant, the average MFI gradient of BCMA and TACI binding was converted to a ratio of binding to APRIL WT control in the relevant screened batch. The mutants which showed a higher BCMA ACI binding ratio than wild type were then sequenced. The results are shown in Figures 20 and the sequences of key mutants are shown in Figure 21. The effect of glycine substitution was then examined at the targeted residues. The results, which are shown in Figure 22, show that residues S202, P201 , M200, T175, V174, A125, H203, D205 and R206 on APRILwt are comparatively more important for binding to TACI than BCMA. Example 19 - Demonstration of in vivo function of APRIL CAR T-cells In order to demonstrate APRIL CAR T-cell function in vivo, APRIL CAR T-cells were tested in a human / mouse chimeric model. MM1.s (ATCC CRL-2974) is a human myeloma cell line which expresses intermediate levels of BCMA. The inventors engineered this cell line to express firefly Luciferase to derive the cell-line MM1.s.FLuc. NOD scid gamma (NSG: NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid H2rgtm1WJI/SzJ) mice are profoundly immunosuppressed mice capable of engrafting several human cell lines and human peripheral blood lymphocytes. Three month old female NSG mice received 1 x107 MMls.FLuc cells vial tail-vein injection without any preparative therapy. Engraftment was determined by serial bioluminescence imaging (Figure 23). Robust and increasing intramedullary engraftment was observed in all mice. At day 13, 5x106 APRIL-HNG-CD280XZ CAR T-cells were administered via tail vein injection. Serial bioluminescence was performed which showed rapid decrease in burden of MM1.s (Figure 23) in all treated mice to a complete remission. This response to CAR therapy was confirmed by flow-cytometry and immunohistochemistry. Example 20 - Testing function of various APRIL mutants in a BiTE format Four normal donor PBMCs were incubated with SupT1 cells, SupT1 cells engineered to express BCMA, SupT1 cells engineered to express TACI or alone in the presence of different BiTES based on either WT APRIL or various mutants. Interferon-gamma levels were measured 24 hours later. The results are shown in Figure 35. The mutant M200G shows significantly improved BCMA vs TACI specificity than wild-type.
