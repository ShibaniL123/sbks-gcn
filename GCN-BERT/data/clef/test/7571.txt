Infant Formula With A Low Content Of Medium-Chain Fatty Acids In Specific Proportions, And Its Use In Promoting And/Or Ensuring A Balanced Growth In Infants Technical Field This invention relates to a synthetic infant formula composition with a low content of medium-chain fatty acids (or MCFAs) in specific proportions, and its use in promoting and/or ensuring a balanced growth. This composition is for infants, preferably preterm infants. Background of the Invention A well-nourished mother's breast milk is universally considered to be the optimum nutrition for healthy full term infants during the first months of life. However all infants cannot be breast fed. Furthermore, the needs of more vulnerable infants such as preterm infants cannot be achieved by their mother's milk. The synthetic infant formulas are therefore of high interest. Lipid comprise an important part of infant formulas since they provide approximately half of the energy content, they are a source of n-3 and n-6 essential fatty acids and they are necessary for the intestinal absorption of fat-soluble vitamins. The total fat in infant formulas usually comprises 90 to 96 wt % of fatty acids (Golay et al. Journal ο AOAC International, Vol 92, No 5, 2009). More recently the nutritional importance of the long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids with C20 and C22 carbon atoms (LC-PUFAs) in infant formulas has been appreciated. The efficiency of intestinal absorption of fatty acids from infant formulas is a vital property of the fat blend. As a general principle, short-chain fatty acids are better absorbed than longer chain fatty acids, and unsaturated fatty acids are better absorbed than saturated fatty acids of the same chain length. In order to achieve good fat absorption similar to that in human milk, infant formulas usually contain a high proportion of vegetable oils. Medium-chain triacylglycerols (MCTs) are usually manufactured by refining vegetable oils rich in MCFAs, and they have been widely used in infant formulas till today. The only recommendation of the European Regulations for using these MCFAs in infant formulas is that lauric acid (C12:0) and myristic acid (04:0) are to be provided, separately or as a whole, in a range of from 0 to 20 % of the total fat content (Commission Directive 2006/141/EC of 22 December 2006 on infant formulae and follow-on formulae). US5000975 describes infant formula compositions in which the fat is issued from vegetable oil fat compositions. For preterm and low birth weight infants, MCTs are included in the composition in a total amount of 10 to 25 wt % with respect to the total fat. These MCTs are made up of a mixture of C6:0 (1 to 2%), C8:0 (65 to 75%), 00:0 (25 to 35%) and 02:0 (1 to 2%) fatty acids, derived from coconut oil. These MCTs comprise predominantly C8:0 and 00:0 fatty acids, in amounts of 60 - 70% of caprylic acid and of 25 - 35 % of capric acid. More recently, US 5709888 describes fat mixtures, in particular for infant nutrition, comprising between about 4.8 to about 28.7 % by weight of MCTs in total, with respect to the total fat. In some examples where the total amount of MCTs is of 7.85 to 8.0 wt %, with respect to the total fat, the amount of caprylic acid (C8:0) is around 2.35 to 2.50 wt %, the amount of capric acid (00:0) is of 3.60 to 3.80 wt % and the amount of lauric acid (02:0) is of 1.80 to 2.00 wt %, with respect to the total fat. Flowever the resultant fatty acid pattern is still distinctly different from human milk fat, which represents generally the gold standard in terms of nutrition. Thus, nowadays, there is a need to provide a more balanced diet to infants and young children. This diet should promote health benefits in the long term to the infants. There is a need to provide a nutritional system that enables the convenient, safe and accurate delivery of the most adequate nutrition all along the first months of the life of a baby. There is need to provide a way to ensure that the best adequate individual nutritional solutions are made available to infants and their care-givers, in order to promote health benefits that may not be immediately visible but which consequences occur later in life. There is a need to provide such cited nutritional compositions, especially during the first year of life, which can help ensuring optimal growth and reduction of risk of health conditions later in life, such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, obesity, metabolic syndrome, or depressed immunity. There is, thus, a need to provide a nutritional composition that promotes and/or ensures optimal growth and reduction of risk of health conditions later in life, such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, obesity, metabolic syndrome, or depressed immunity. There is a need for an early-in-life nutritional intervention or control in order to deliver health benefits later-in-life. The compositions of the present invention have been designed to promote and/or ensure balanced growth. It is therefore an object of the invention to provide a synthetic infant formula useful as an alternative for infants, in particular preterm infants, and particularly well adapted for its use in promoting and/or ensuring a balanced growth of infants. Summary of the Invention The present inventors have found surprisingly that the administration of a low content of MCFAs in specific proportions, is particularly effective for promoting and/or ensuring the balanced growth of infants, and in particular of preterm infants. Accordingly, in a first aspect of the invention, there is provided a synthetic infant formula composition comprising, with respect with the total fat: • medium-chain fatty acids, in the form of triglycerides, in a total amount in the range of 2 to 10 wt %, preferably in the range of 4.5 to 8 wt %; • caproic acid in an amount in the range of 0.6 to 1.3 wt %, preferably in the range of 0.7 to 1.1 wt %, more preferably in the range of 0.8 to 1.0 wt %; • caprylic acid in an amount in the range of 0.8 to 1.5 wt %, preferably in the range of 0.9 to 1.2 wt %, more preferably in the range of 1.0 to 1.1 wt %; • capric acid in an amount in the range of 1.4 to 1.9 wt %, preferably in the range of 1.5 to 1.8 wt %, more preferably in the range of 1.6 to 1.7 wt %; and • lauric acid in an amount in the range of 4.0 to 6.0 wt %, preferably in the range of 4.5 to 5.9 wt %, more preferably in the range of 4.5 to 5.5 wt %. The composition is preferably a preterm infant formula. Surprisingly, the relative low amount of MFAs in the infant formula according to the invention, in comparison with the infant formulas of the prior art, as well as a new dosage of these MCFAs in the form of MCTs, lead to an infant formula which promotes and/or ensures the balanced growth of infants, and in particular of preterm infants. Thus, the nutrients of the composition of the invention are associated with balanced growth, especially in infants. Thus, in a second aspect of the invention, this composition is provided for promoting and/or ensuring the balanced growth of infants, and in particular of preterm infants. Detailed description of the invention For a complete understanding of the present invention and the advantages thereof, reference is made to the following detailed description of the invention. It should be appreciated that various embodiments of the present invention can be combined with other embodiments of the invention and are merely illustrative of the specific ways to make and use the invention, and do not limit the scope of the invention when taken into consideration with the claims and the following detailed description. In the present description, the following words are given a definition that should be taken into account when reading and interpreting the description, examples and claims. As used herein, the following terms have the following meanings. According to the Commission Directive 2006/141/EC of 22 December 2006 on infant formulae and follow-on formulae, article 1.2 (a), the term "infant" means child under the age of 12 months. The term "preterm infant" (or "premature infant") means an infant born at least than 37 weeks gestational age. The term "low birth weight infant" means an infant having a live born weight less than 2,500 g. The term "infant formula" means a composition as foodstuff intended for particular nutritional use by infants during the first months of life and satisfying by itself the nutritional requirements of this category of person (according to the Commission Directive 2006/141/EC of 22 December 2006 on infant formulae and follow-on formulae, article 1.2 (c)). It has to be understood that infants can be fed solely with infant formulas, or that the infant formula can be used as a complement of human milk. It is synonymous to the widely used expression "starter formula". According to the Commission Directive 2006/141/EC of 22 December 2006 on infant formulae and follow-on formulae, article 1.2 (d), the term "follow-on formulae" means foodstuffs intended for particular nutritional use by infants when appropriate complementary feeding is introduced and constituting the principal liquid element in a progressively diversified diet of this category of persons. The term "growing-up milk" means a milk-based nutritional composition. The term "human milk fortifier" means a nutritional composition for infants intended to be added to or diluted with human milk. The term "hypoallergenic composition" means a composition which is unlikely to cause allergic reactions. The term "allergy" means an allergy which has been detected by a medical doctor and which can be treated occasionally or in a more durable manner. The term "food allergy" means an allergy with respect to a nutritional composition. The term "sialylated oligosaccharide" means an oligosaccharide having a sialic acid residue. The term "prebiotic" means non-digestible carbohydrates that beneficially affect the host by selectively stimulating the growth and/or the activity of healthy bacteria such as bifidobacteria in the colon of humans (Gibson GR, Roberfroid MB. Dietary modulation of the human colonic microbiota: introducing the concept of prebiotics. J Nutr. 1995; 125:1401-12). The term "probiotic" means microbial cell preparations or components of microbial cells with a beneficial effect on the health or well-being of the host (Salminen S, Ouwehand A. Β℮ηηο Υ. et al. "Probiotics: how should they be defined" Trends Food Sci. Technol. 1999:10 107-10). The term "nutritional" means that it nourishes a subject. This infant formula is a nutritional composition, usually to be taken orally, intragastrically, or intravenously, and usually including a lipid or fat source and a protein source. The term "preterm infant formula" means an infant formula intended for a preterm infant. The terms "promoting and/or ensuring the balanced growth" means favorizing the growth of an infant. These terms encompasses the prevention of obesity. The indicators of normative growth are defined by World Health Organization (WHO) (Acta Paediatrica, 2006; Suppl 450: 76-85). These indicators are: length/height-for-age, weight-for-age weight-for-length, weight-for-height, body mass, index-for-age (BMI-for-age), head circumference-for-age, arm circumference-for-age, subscapular skinfold-for-age, triceps skinfold-for-age, motor development milestones, weight velocity, length velocity and head circumference velocity. Furthermore, each indicator is available independently for male and female gender of the infant. The value of any particular indicator of an infant between 3rd and 97th percentile at a corresponding time point is considered normal and/or optimal. The term "synthetic" means obtained by chemical and/or biological means, to the contrary of "natural (found in the nature)". The term "medium-chain triglycerides" (or MCT) means medium-chain fatty acid esters of glycerol, that is to say a compound formed of a glycerol backbone and three fatty acids, the three fatty acid chains attached to glycerol being medium-chain in length. The medium-chain fatty acids are caproic acid (comprising 6 carbon atoms or C6:0), caprylic acid (comprising 8 carbon atoms or C8:0), capric acid (comprising 10 carbon atoms or 00:0), and lauric acid (comprising 12 carbon atoms or 02:0). The medium-chain fatty acids are mainly (at least 98%) in the form of triglycerides. The term "long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid" (or LC-PUFA) means a polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) having C20 or C22 carbon atoms. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are unsaturated fatty acids that contain more than one double bond in their backbone. All percentages are by weight of total fat unless otherwise stated. As used in this specification, the words "comprises", "comprising", and similar words, are not to be interpreted in an exclusive or exhaustive sense. In other words, they are intended to mean "including", but not limited to. Any reference to prior art documents in this specification is not to be considered an admission that such prior art is widely known or forms part of the common general knowledge in the field. The composition of the invention is designed to meet the nutritional needs of infants. The composition is aimed at promoting and/or ensuring balanced growth in infants and later in life. The synthetic nutritional composition of the invention is designed for consumption by infants from birth to one year old. It is specifically designed to meet the nutritional needs of preterm infants. Preferably, the composition of the invention further contains at least one PUFA, the PUFA(s) being present in an amount generally of at least 15, preferably at least 20%, with respect to the total fatty acids. Polyunsaturated fatty acids can be classified in various groups by their chemical structure. Among those PUFAS one may distinguish the omega-3 and omega-6 PUFAs. Polyunsaturated omega-3 (ω-3 or η-3) fatty acids comprise alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) 18:3, stearidonic acid (SDA) 18:4, eicosatrienoic acid (ΕΤΕ) 20:3, n-3 eicosatetraenoic acid (ETA) 20:4, eicosapentaenoic acid (ΕΡΑ) 20:5, n-3 docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) 22:5, and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) 22:6. Preferably, the PUFAs according to the invention comprise alpha-linolenic acid, which is an essential fatty acid. Polyunsaturated omega-6 (ω-6 or η-6) fatty acids comprise linoleic acid 18:2, gammalinolenic acid (GLA) 18:3, n-6 eicosadienoic acid 20:2, dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA) 20:3, arachidonic acid (ΑΑ or ARA) 20:4, n-6 docosadienoic acid 22:2, and docosapentaenoic acid 22:5. Preferably, the PUFAs according to the invention comprise linoleic acid, which is an essential fatty acid. Preferably, the composition of the invention further contains at least one LC-PUFA, which is preferably a n-3 and/or a n-6 LC-PUFA (that is to say a n-3 LC-PUFA, a n-6 LC-PUFA or, more preferably, a mixture of n-3 and n-6 LC-PUFA), the LC-PUFA(s) being present in an amount generally of at least 0.8 wt %, preferably at least 1.0 wt %, with respect to the total fatty acids. This leads (taking into consideration that the total fat comprises 90 to 96 wt % of fatty acids, see above) to an amount of at least about 0.8 wt %, preferably at least about 1.0 wt %, with respect to the total fat. The n-3 LC-PUFA can be a C20 or a C22 n-3 fatty acid. The C20 or C22 n-3 LC-PUFA is preferably present in an amount of at least 0.4 wt%, with respect to all the fatty acids in the composition. This leads to an amount of at least about 0.4 wt %, with respect to the total fat of the composition. Preferably the n-3 LC-PUFA is docosahexanoic acid (DFIA, C22:6). The n-6 LC-PUFA can be a C20 or a C22 n-6 fatty acid. The C20 or C22 n-6 LC-PUFA is preferably present in an amount of at least 0.4 wt% of all fatty acids in the composition. This leads to an amount of at least 0.4 wt %, with respect to the total fat of the composition. Preferably the n-6 LC-PUFA is arachidonic acid (ARA, C20:4). Preferably, the LC-PUFAs comprise at least 0.4 wt % of docosahexaneoic acid and at least 0.4 wt % of arachidonic acid, with respect to the total fatty acids. The source of LC-PUFA may be, for example, egg lipids, fungal oil, low ΕΡΑ fish oil or algal oil. The LC-PUFA of the composition of the invention may be provided in small amounts of oils containing high quantities of preformed arachidonic acid and docosahexaenoic acid such as fish oils or microbial oils. The presence of LC-PUFAs is especially advantageous for cognitive benefits, as it is known in the art. There are many reports in the literature suggesting that these fatty acids may be essential for optimal cognitive function development. Among its many roles, DFIA influences the function of the blood-brain barrier, the activity of membrane-bound enzymes and ionic channels, dopaminergic and serotoninergic neurotransmission, and signal transduction (Yaboob, Ρ Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2009.29:257-282). The presence of palmitic acid in the form of triglycerides, the palmitic acid being esterified in the sn-2 position of the triglycerides, is especially advantageous for growth benefits, as it is known in the art (Innis SM, Adv Nutr 2011 May 2(3):275-283. According to a particularly preferred embodiment, the composition according to the invention is specially adapted for infants, preferably preterm infants, who were born preterm or with low-birth weight or experienced intra-uterine growth retardation or who suffered from growth delays due to disease and/or malnutrition. The synthetic nutritional composition of the invention may be an infant formula in the form of a powder, liquid or concentrated liquid. The infant formula may be based on a cow's milk, goat's milk or buffalo milk. The infant formula may be a starter formula generally for infants that are less than 6 months old or a follow-on formula generally for infants that are more than 6 months old. The composition of the invention may be a growing up milk, or a human milk fortifier. The quantities of all the components expressed herein as weight % (wt %) with respect to the total fat, reflect the amounts of some components of the fat present in the synthetic nutritional composition, to be consumed by the infant. For example, the composition may be a powdered infant formula that is diluted with water to give a final liquid product. The composition according to the invention may also be a concentrated liquid that is diluted with water to achieve the final liquid product. The composition of the invention may be a liquid product that is directly consumed by the infant as it is. The composition according to the invention may be a human milk fortifier that is added to or diluted with human milk. In this case, the concentration of the components already present in the human milk (to which the human milk fortifier is added) are to be taken as the average values for lactating mothers that are known or predicted from published clinical data. The composition according to the present invention contains a source of lipids. The lipid source may be any lipid or fat which is suitable for use in infant formulae, as far as the content of MCFAs in specific proportions meets the requirements of the invention. Preferred fat sources include palm oleic, high oleic sunflower oil and high oleic sunflower oil. The essential fatty acids linoleic and a-linolenic acid may also be added. In the composition, the fat source (including optional LC-PUFA such as ARA and/or DFIA) preferably has a ratio of n-6 to n-3 fatty acids of about 1:2 to about 10:1, preferably about 5:1 to about 10:1, even more preferably about 7:1 to about 9:1. The composition according to the invention is preferably such that the fat consists of a mixture of 38 to 42% of milk fat; 8 to 10% of high oleic sunflower oil; 12 to 16% of sunflower oil, 10 to 14% of canola oil; 7 to 9% of coconut oil; 13 to 17% of an oil comprising 15 to 25 wt%, preferably 17 to 25 wt%, of palmitic acid in the form of triglycerides, 40 to 70 wt %, preferably 50 to 65 wt%, of the palmitic acid being in the sn-2 position of the triglycerides such as Betapol® (from IOI Loders Croklaan); and 1,5 to 2,5% of a mixture of poly-unsaturated fatty acids ARA and DFIA (such as a mixture in 1:1 proportion of ARASCO® and DFIASCO® from Martek), preferably in a ratio ARA:DFIA of about 1:1, with respect to the total fat. Betapol® could be replaced efficiently by Infat® from AAK/Enzymotec. Each one of these fat sources is a refined oil suitable for infant nutrition applications. Other standard ingredients known to the skilled person for formulating an infant formula, human milk fortifier or growing-up milk may also be present in the compositions of the invention. Thus, the composition of the invention may contain other ingredients which may act to enforce the technical effect of the components, particularly according to the Commission Directive 2006/141/EC of 22 December 2006 on infant formulae and follow-on formulae. The composition according to the present invention can also contain a carbohydrate source, preferably as prebiotics, or in addition to prebiotics. Any carbohydrate source conventionally found in infant formulae such as lactose, saccharose, maltodextrin, starch and mixtures thereof may be used although the preferred source of carbohydrates is lactose. The prebiotics that may be used in accordance with the present invention are not particularly limited and include all food substances that promote the growth of probiotics or health beneficial micro-organisms in the intestines. Preferably, they may be selected from the group consisting of oligosaccharides, optionally containing fructose, galactose, and mannose; dietary fibers, in particular soluble fibers, soy fibers; inulin; or mixtures thereof. Preferred prebiotics are fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS), galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS), isomalto-oligosaccharides (IMO), xylo-oligosaccharides (XOS), arabino-xylo oligosaccharides (AXOS), mannan-oligosaccharides (MOS), oligosaccharides of soy, glycosylsucrose (GS), lactosucrose (LS), lactulose (LA), palatinose-oligosaccharides (ΡΑΟ), malto-oligosaccharides, gums and/or hydrolysates thereof, pectins and/or hydrolysates thereof. In particular, the human milk oligosaccharides, for example sialylated oligosaccharides, described in WO 2012/069416 published on May 31, 2012 may be included in the composition according to the invention. The latter oligosaccharides may act in synergy with the medium-chain fatty acids of the invention to promote the healthy establishment of balanced growth in the developing infant. Probiotic may be added to the composition. All probiotic micro-organisms may be added additionally. Preferably, the probiotic may be selected for this purpose from the group consisting of Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, Enterococcus, Streptococcus, Kluyveromyces, Saccharoymces, Candida, in particular selected from the group consisting of Bifidobacterium longum, Bifidobacterium lactis, Bifidobacterium animalis, Bifidobacterium breve, Bifidobacterium infantis, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus salivarius, Lactobacillus lactis, Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus johnsonii, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus salivarius, Lactococcus lactis, Enterococcus faecium, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Saccharomyces boulardii or mixtures thereof, preferably selected from the group consisting of Bifidobacterium longum NCC3001 (ATCC BAA-999), Bifidobacterium longum NCC2705 (CNCM 1-2618), Bifidobacterium longum NCC490 (CNCM 1-2170), Bifidobacterium lactis NCC2818 (CNCM 1-3446), Bifidobacterium breve strain A, Lactobacillus paracasei NCC2461 (CNCM 1-2116), Lactobacillus johnsonii NCC533 (CNCM 1-1225), Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (ATCC53103), Lactobacillus rhamnosus NCC4007 (CGMCC 1.3724), Enterococcus faecium SF 68 (NCC2768; NCIMB10415), and mixtures thereof. The composition according to the invention can also contain a protein source. The type of protein is not believed to be critical to the present invention provided that the minimum requirements for essential amino acid content are met and satisfactory growth is ensured. Thus, protein sources based on whey, casein and mixtures thereof may be used as well as protein sources based on soy. As far as whey proteins are concerned, the protein source may be based on acid whey or sweet whey or mixtures thereof and may include alpha-lactalbumin and beta-lactoglobulin in any desired proportions. The proteins can be at least partially hydrolyzed in order to enhancement of oral tolerance to allergens, especially food allergens. In that case the composition is a hypoallergenic composition. In a preferred embodiment, the composition may be cow's milk whey based infant formula. The formula may also be a hypoallergenic (HA) formula in which the cow milk proteins are (partially or extensively) hydrolysed. The formula may also be based on soy milk or a non-allergenic formula, for example one based on free amino acids. The composition of the invention can also contain all vitamins and minerals, and other micronutrients, understood to be essential in the daily diet and in nutritionally significant amounts. Minimum requirements have been established for certain vitamins and minerals. Examples of minerals, vitamins and other nutrients optionally present in the composition of the invention include vitamin A, vitamin Bl, vitamin Β2, vitamin Β6, vitamin Β12, vitamin Ε, vitamin Κ, vitamin C, vitamin D, folic acid, inositol, niacin, biotin, pantothenic acid, choline, calcium, phosphorous, iodine, iron, magnesium, copper, zinc, manganese, chlorine, potassium, sodium, selenium, chromium, molybdenum, taurine, and L-carnitine. Minerals are usually added in salt form. The presence and amounts of specific minerals and other vitamins will vary depending on the intended population. If necessary, the composition of the invention may contain emulsifiers and stabilisers such as soy, lecithin, citric acid esters of mono- and di-glycerides, and the like. The composition of the invention may also contain other substances which may have a beneficial effect such as lactoferrin, nucleotides, nucleosides, gangliosides, polyamines, and the like. The preparation of the composition according to the invention will now be described by way of example. The formula may be prepared in any suitable manner. For example, it may be prepared by blending together a protein source, a carbohydrate source, and a fat source including the MCFAs in appropriate proportions. If used, the emulsifiers may be included at this point. The vitamins and minerals may be added at this point but are usually added later to avoid thermal degradation. Any lipophilic vitamins, emulsifiers and the like may be dissolved into the fat source prior to blending. Water, preferably water which has been subjected to reverse osmosis, may then be mixed in to form a liquid mixture. The temperature of the water is conveniently in the range between about 50°C and about 80°C to aid dispersal of the ingredients. Commercially available liquefiers may be used to form the liquid mixture. The liquid mixture is then homogenized, for example in two stages. The liquid mixture may then be thermally treated to reduce bacterial loads, by rapidly heating the liquid mixture to a temperature in the range between about 80°C and about 150°C for duration between about 5 seconds and about 5 minutes, for example. This may be carried out by means of steam injection, an autoclave or a heat exchanger, for example a plate heat exchanger. Then, the liquid mixture may be cooled to between about 60°C and about 85°C for example by flash cooling. The liquid mixture may then be again homogenized, for example in two stages between about 10 MPa and about 30 MPa in the first stage and between about 2 MPa and about 10 MPa in the second stage. The homogenized mixture may then be further cooled to add any heat sensitive components, such as vitamins and minerals. The pH and solids content of the homogenized mixture are conveniently adjusted at this point. The homogenized mixture is transferred to a suitable drying apparatus such as a spray dryer or freeze dryer and converted to powder. The powder should have a moisture content of less than about 5% by weight. Some of the carbohydrate may be added at this stage by dry-mixing along with optional probiotic bacterial strain(s), or by blending them in a syrup form of crystals, along with optional probiotic bacterial strain(s), and spray-dry (or freeze -dry). If a liquid composition is preferred, the homogenized mixture may be sterilized then aseptically filled into suitable containers or may be first filled into the containers and then retorted. In another embodiment, the composition of the invention may be a supplement in an amount sufficient to achieve the desired effect in an infant. This form of administration is usually more suited to preterm infants. The amount of MCFAs to be included in the supplement will be selected according to the manner in which the supplement is to be administered. The supplement may be in the form of powder, tablets, capsules, pastilles or a liquid for example, as long as it is a suitable nutritional composition for the infant. The supplement may further contain protective hydrocolloids (such as gums, proteins, modified starches), binders, film forming agents, encapsulating agents/materials, wall/shell materials, matrix compounds, coatings, emulsifiers, surface active agents, solubilizing agents (oils, fats, waxes, lecithins etc.), adsorbents, carriers, fillers, cocompounds, dispersing agents, wetting agents, processing aids (solvents), flowing agents, taste masking agents, weighting agents, jellifying agents and gel forming agents. The supplement may also contain conventional pharmaceutical additives and adjuvants, excipients and diluents, including, but not limited to, water, gelatine of any origin, vegetable gums, lignin-sulfonate, talc, sugars, starch, gum arabic, vegetable oils, polyalkylene glycols, flavouring agents, preservatives, stabilizers, emulsifying agents, buffers, lubricants, colorants, wetting agents, fillers, and the like. The supplement can be added in a product acceptable to the consumer (who is an infant), such as an ingestible carrier or support, respectively. Examples of such carriers or supports are a pharmaceutical or a food composition. Examples for such compositions are infant formula including preterm formula. Further, the supplement may contain an organic or inorganic carrier material suitable for enteral or parenteral administration as well as vitamins, minerals trace elements and other micronutrients in accordance with the recommendations of Government bodies such as the European Commission Directive 2006/141/EC of 22 December 2006 on infant formulae and follow-on formulae. The composition of the invention is an infant formula (or a follow-on formula or a growing up milk or a human milk fortifier), for infant of less than 12 months, less than 6 months or preferably of 3 months or less. In this case, the composition is a preterm infant formula. It is generally known, or at least hypnotized, that early nutritional interventions can be more effective (in comparison to intervention at later stages in life) in programming the metabolic pathways of the infants to induce optimal balanced growth and thus prevent obesity during infancy and later in life In one embodiment of the invention, the composition of the invention is an infant formula intended and/or especially designed for preterm infants. It is generally known, or at least hypothized, that this subject group is more prone to suffer from unbalanced growth (and, thus, from being obese later in life) due to the immaturity of the metabolic pathways and physiological conditions at birth. Early adaptation and control of the diet is therefore of the highest importance. In one embodiment of the invention, the composition of the invention is an infant formula (or a follow-on formula or a growing up milk or a human milk fortifier), for infants born from mothers or parents having a history of obesity or overweight. It is generally known, or at least hypothized, that these subjects groups are more prone to suffer from unbalanced growth (and, thus, from being obese later in life), due, for example, to genetic or epi-genetic predispositions. It is, therefore, critical to address such issues as early as possible during infancy by a specifically adapted diet. Although the invention has been described by way of example, it should be appreciated that variations and modifications may be made without departing from the scope of the invention as defined in the claims. Furthermore, where known equivalents exist to specific features, such equivalents are incorporated as if specifically referred in this specification. The invention is further described with reference to the following examples. It will be appreciated that the invention as claimed is not intended to be limited in any way by these examples. Example 1 A mixture of fat was carried out, by the mixing of animal and vegetable fat. Advantageously, on the contrary to the oil mixtures of the prior art infant formulae, this mixture has a MCFAs composition close to a human milk reference data. The oil mixture composition was the following, with respect to the total fat: • milk fat: 40%; • high-oleic sunflower oil: 9% ; • sunflower oil: 14% ; • canola oil: 12% ; • coconut oil: 8% ; • oil mixture of ARA and DHA (ratio 1:1): 2% ; • Betapol® (from 101 Loders Croklaan): 15%. Betapol® could be replaced efficiently by Infat® from ΑΑΚ/. Each of these fat sources is a refined oil suitable for infant nutrition applications. The lipid composition of this mixture was characterized by two methods as described below. Determination of triacylglycerols was performed by non-aqueous reversed phase liquid chromatography and hybrid mass spectrometry as recently described in Journal of Lipid Research (2013) volume 54, 290-305. This approach enables the global detection and identification of TAG in their intact form (without chemical derivatization) thus the overview of TAG size distribution is possible and the regioisomeric distribution of various FA including that of Ρ, can be measured simultaneously. Briefly, the identification of the TAG was performed based on the accurate mass and fragmentation pattern obtained by data-dependent fragmentation. The quantitation of TAG was based on the high resolution ion chromatograms, while relative proportion of sn-l(3)/sn-2 regioisomers was calculated based on generalized fragmentation models and the relative intensities observed in the product ion spectra. Determination of fatty acids was performed by gas chromatography flame ionization detection as described in IUPAC method 2.304, but using methyl-undecanoate as internal standard and a cyanopropylpolysiloxane capillary column. This classical reference approach enables the indirect but most sensitive and most precise quantification of individual (including trans) fatty acids. Briefly, the samples are subjected to transmethylation under alkali conditions resulting in the methyl esters of all fatty acids. The identification and quantification of the individual fatty acid methyl esters is performed based on their chromatographic retention time and peak area respectively. The total amount of C8:0 to C12:0 fatty acids was 7.7 g/ 100 g oil. The total amount of triacylglycerol with the total carbon of the acyl chains between C30 and C36, considered as medium chain triglycerides (MCTs), was 9.5 g/ 100 g oil. The sources of the palmitic acidic are as follows, with respect to the total palmitic acid: • milk fat: 55%; • high-oleic sunflower oil: 2% ; • sunflower oil: 5% ; • canola oil: 3% ; • coconut oil: 3% ; • oil mixture of ARA and DHA (1:1): 1% ; • Betapol®: 31%. The total amount of palmitic acid esterified in the sn-1 or sn-3 position was 9.5 g/ 100 g oil (thus 56% in all palmitic acid). The total amount of palmitic acid esterified in the sn-2 position was 7.4 g/ 100 g oil (thus 44% in all palmitic acid). The total amount of PUFAs was 14.0 g/ 100 g oil. The total amount of LC-PUFAs was 0.9 g/ 100 g oil. The detailed composition of the oil mixture, with respect to the total fat, was measured as details in Table 1 below.

The total amount of PUFAs was 48.4 g/ 100 g of fatty acids. The total amount of LC-PUFAs was 0.6 g/ 100 g of fatty acids. The n-6 / n-3 ratio (weight by weight) of these fatty acids, i.e. the ratio of the n-3 fatty acids to the n-6 fatty acids, was equal to 8.7 %.
