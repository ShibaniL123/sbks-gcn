FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a crutch, and more particularly to an axillary crutch which is retracted in a small size easily. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION A conventional axillary crutch is employed to assist injured or disabled user in walking and its length is fixed, so the conventional axillary crutch cannot be retracted in a small size and is portable inconveniently. To overcome such a problem, a collapsible axillary crutch is developed and contains an upper support column and a lower support column between which a spring set and a slidable sleeve are defined. The spring set is biased against the slidable sleeve, and the slidable sleeve is mounted on a bottom end of the upper support column so that the upper support column and the lower support column are maintained at a vertical standing position to assist the user in walking. As desiring to retract the collapsible axillary crutch, the slidable sleeve is pulled by one hand to retract backwardly from the lower support column so that it is kept in an unfixing state, and then the lower support column is bent by the other hand to retract the collapsible axillary crutch. However, this collapsible axillary crutch is retracted with two hands to cause troublesome operation. Moreover, the upper support column and the lower support column are positioned by means of the spring set and the slidable sleeve, hence this positioning structure (including the spring set and the slidable sleeve) are complicated, and an elasticity of the spring set will be fatigued after a period of using time. The present invention has arisen to mitigate and/or obviate the afore-described disadvantages. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The primary object of the present invention is to provide an axillary crutch in which an operating member is gripped and pulled downwardly by one hand so that a first support unit is bent along two first coupling portions and two second coupling portions, and then two first fixing portions remove from two second fixing portions, the first support unit moves close to the second support unit, thereby retracting the axillary crutch easily and quickly. To obtain the above objective, an axillary crutch provided by the present invention contains: a first support unit, a second support unit, and a positioning unit. The first support unit includes two parallel first support columns, an armpit pad disposed on two top ends of the two parallel first support columns, two first connecting segments mounted on two bottom ends of the two parallel first support columns, and a grip bar defined between two middle sections of the two parallel first support columns. The second support unit includes two parallel second support columns and an abutting pad disposed on two bottom ends of the two parallel second support columns, and the two parallel second support columns couple with the two parallel first support columns. The positioning unit includes two first fixing portions secured on the two first connecting segments, an operating member coupled with the two first fixing portions, and two second fixing portions arranged on the parallel second support columns. The two first connecting segments of the first support unit are coupled on two top ends of the two parallel second support columns, and the two first fixing portions are locked with the two second fixing portions, such that when the operating member is pulled, the two first fixing portions remove from the two second fixing portions so that the first support unit and the second support unit are retracted.

The second support unit 20 includes two parallel second support columns 21, an abutting pad 22 disposed on two bottom ends of the two parallel second support columns 21, two second connecting segments 23 mounted on two top ends of the two parallel second support columns 21, and two second coupling portions 24 for connecting with the two first coupling portions 14. Referring further to FIG. 3, two locking elements 25 are axially fixed on the two first coupling portions 14 and the two second coupling portions 24, and two first nuts 26 are screwed with the two locking elements 25 so that the first support unit 10 is in connection with the second support unit 20. Furthermore, each second connecting segment 23 of the second support unit 20 is tubular and has an opening 231, a diameter of each first connecting segment 13 is less than that of each second connecting segment 23 so that each first connecting segment 13 is inserted into each second connecting segment 23 via the opening 231. As shown in FIGS. 3 and 4, the positioning unit 30 includes two first fixing portions 31 secured on the two first connecting segments 13, an operating member 32 coupled with the two first fixing portions 31, and two second fixing portions 33 arranged on the two second connecting segments 23. In this embodiment, each first fixing portion 31 is a bolt element, and each second fixing portion 33 is a through hole. In addition, the two second fixing portions 33 are arranged on two positions of two front sides of the axillary crutch, and the operating member 32 is located at two positions of two rear sides of the axillary crutch opposite to the two second fixing portions 33. When the two connecting segments 13 of the first support unit 10 are coupled with the two second connecting segments 23 of the second support unit 20, the two first fixing portions 31 are locked with the two second fixing portions 33. The two first fixing portions 31 are inserted into two orifices 111 of the two parallel first support columns 11, and each of the two first fixing portions 31 has a threaded section 311 arranged around a rear end thereof. The operating member 32 is formed in an inverted U shape and has two screwing apertures 321 defined on two ends thereof and screwing with two threaded sections 311 of the two first fixing portions 31, such that two screwing apertures 321 of the operating member 32 are screwed with the two threaded sections 311 of the two first fixing portions 31, and two second nuts 34 are locked with the two threaded sections 311 so that the operating member 32 is coupled with the two first fixing portions 31 which are secured on the two first connecting segments 13 of the two parallel first support columns 11. The adjusting unit 40 includes an upper tube 41 and a lower tube 42 inserted into the upper tube 41, and the upper tube 41 has a plurality of pores 411 longitudinally arranged around an peripheral wall thereof, the lower tube 42 has a resilient retaining tab 421 for retaining in one of the plurality of pores 411. The abutting pad 22 of the second support unit 20 is also fixed on a bottom end of the lower tube 42.
