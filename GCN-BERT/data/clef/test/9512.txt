Example 6: Preparation of 2-[3-(2,5-dimethylbenzyloxy)propyl]pyridine
2-[3-(2,5-Dimethylbenzyloxy)propyl]pyridine is prepared in a step according to the following reaction route.
60% sodium hydride (1.75 g, 43.8 mmol) and dry tetrahydrofuran (10 mL) were put in a 200-mL flask and stirred in a nitrogen atmosphere. In a water bath, a dry tetrahydrofuran (5 mL) solution of 2-pyridine-propanol (5.00 g, 36.4 mmol) was dropwise added thereto at 35° C. or lower, taking 20 minutes, and then stirred at room temperature for 40 minutes. The reactor was again put in a water bath, and a dry tetrahydrofuran (5 mL) solution of 2, 5-dimethylbenzyl chloride (6.76 g, 43.7 mmol) was dropwise added thereto at 30° C. or lower, taking 10 minutes, and stirred at room temperature for 6 hours.
Cold water (30 mL) was added to the reaction liquid at 35° C. or lower for quenching, and this was extracted with ethyl acetate (50 mL). The resultant organic layer was washed with 20% saline water (50 mL), dried with sodium sulfate and concentrated to give a crude product (12.06 g). This was purified through silica gel chromatography to give 5.62 g (yield 60.5%, purity 99.1%) of 2-[3-(2,5-dimethylbenzyloxy)propyl]pyridine (invention product 6).
