BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIGS. 1A-1B show a schematic view of the geometry of a microfluidic channel (FIG. 1A) top view, (FIG. 1B) side view, according to one embodiment of the invention. FIGS. 2A-2D show the formation of droplets using wells (FIG. 2A) and the channel is filled with aqueous phase containing fluorescein dye, (FIG. 2B) and (FIG. 2C) oil replaces the aqueous phase producing aqueous droplets in well, and (FIG. 2D) final array of aqueous droplets in wells, according to one embodiment of the invention. DETAILED DESCRIPTION The current invention includes a method of forming uniform and controlled size microdroplets in parallel at precise locations in a microfluidic device by the successive flow of immiscible fluids over microfabricated wells. The current invention solves the problem of how to form and position droplets quickly and efficiently in a 2D array for biological assays and concurrent detection. According to one embodiment, the drops are made in parallel, which increases the speed of droplet production for assays that require a large number of individual droplets. According to one embodiment, a well system is provided to form droplets, where the wells can be cylindrical or hemispherical. The microsystem contains a wide channel of specified height with depressions or wells of greater height. FIG. 1A shows the channel with a height of 50 microns and wells a circular diameter of 100 microns. According to other embodiments of the invention the channel height can be in a range of 0.1 μm to 0.1 cm, the well diameter can be in a range of 0.1 μm to 0.5 cm. FIG. 1B shows a side view one embodiment of the microsystem, where the wells can have a depth in a range of 0.11 μm to 0.1 cm. In one embodiment, the microchannel is primed with an immiscible fluid. Droplets are then formed by first flowing a fluid (such as aqueous solution) into the microchannel to fill the channel (see FIG. 2A). The wells remain coated with a thin film of the immiscible fluid. A second immiscible fluid (such as oil) is flowed into the channel (see FIGS. 2B and 2C). As the oil flows into the channel it displaces the water phase but leaves aqueous droplets in the wells (see FIG. 2D). These aqueous droplets are the same size of the wells. The oils used in this example are 1-octonal. The droplets are then released from the wells by flowing a release fluid through the channel, where the release fluid can include immiscible fluids such as hydrocarbon oils (mineral oil, 1-octanol and hexadecane) and perfluorinated oils (FC-40, Novec 7500). In another embodiment, the release of droplets is by an increase in flow speed of the immiscible fluid, where the flow rate is greater than 0.1 mm/sec. In other embodiments, the flow rates are shown in TABLE 1. TABLE 1 SOLUTION FLOW RATE RANGE Purge of Immiscible Fluid 0.01 mm/sec to 500 mm/sec Aqueous Fluid 0.01 mm/sec to 500 mm/sec Immiscible Fluid 0.01 mm/sec to 500 mm/sec Droplet Release Fluid 1 mm/sec to 1000 mm/sec According to a further embodiment, the invention offers several advantages over conventional techniques. The size of droplets is defined by the size of the depressions and is therefore tunable and robust, where the depressions are formed using lithography. The position of the droplets is predefined and thus the position can be programmed in the detection setup. The formation of droplets is robust and relatively invariant to flow speeds of fluids. Furthermore, the reagents can be flowed through in line, one after the other, removing the need for multiple fluid control systems for aqueous reagents and oil in a device and simplifying the off-chip instrumentation. Moreover, the droplet array can be formed by injecting the fluids using a pipetman for facilitating its application with assays and eliminating the need for external fluid control. The device shown in FIGS. 2A-2D is fabricated using soft lithography. In this example, the device is made of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) bonded permanently to a glass coverslide using a plasma cleaner. In a further embodiment, the surface of the microchannel is rendered superhydrophobic by treatment with 1720 Electronic Grade Coating (3M). According to other embodiments, the process of droplet formation does not depend on device material and therefore suitable materials for the device would include, but not be limited to, glass, PDMS, plastics and polymers. The depth of the channel and well can be varied from 100 nm-1 mm. The width of the well can be varied from 100 nm-1 mm. Suitable average flow speeds for the fluids in the channel would span from 0.01 to 500 mm/sec. Aspect ratios of depth of channel to well can range 1:1.1 to 1:20. Aspect ratio of well diameter to minimum spacing between individual wells can range 20:1 to 1:10. The shape of the wells is variable (top view) and includes spherical, oval or square. The requirement for the fluids is that they be immiscible. This also includes combinations of gas and liquids. Surfactants can be included in either the droplet or external fluid to lower interfacial tension and/or reduce surface wetting of the droplets. Some variations include changing the configuration or shape of the wells could lead to droplets of different size or shape. The system can also be used to produce oil droplets in water. This system can also be used with a fluid/gas system to produce gas bubbles in liquid in predetermined positions. According to another aspect of the invention, the microchannel is treated with a hydrophobic coating, where the microwells comprise the hydrophobic coating. In a further aspect of the invention, the microchannel is treated with a hydrophilic coating, where the microwells comprise the hydrophilic coating. The most prominent application for the current invention is digital Polymerase Chain Reaction PCR, where the invention offers a new and more robust device and method to prepare the droplets for the PCR analysis. It simplifies the requirements relating to fluid control with fluids brought in sequentially by a single entry and exit. The biological preparation (PCR cycles) are performed on-chip with simultaneous detection of the droplet array. In one embodiment, the injection of fluids in the device can be performed using syringe and syringe pumps. However, since only a single entry point is needed, the solutions can be injected using a single syringe or a pipette. The method can also be used to process an emulsion with variable droplet size to create an organized array or to produce homogeneous sized emulsion. The droplets can be ejected from the well array by a high flow rate of the external phase for further processing or collection off-chip. The method can be used to make an array of gels at predetermined positions for cellular or protein assays. In this case, droplets containing gelling reagent (such as alginate or matrigel) would be prepared by the method according to the current invention at a temperature where the reagent remains fluid. After formation of the gel, the temperature is modified to the gelation temperature to provoke gelation. The external oil can be replaced with aqueous solutions such as buffers or media. Other applications of the device are to arrange an array of polymer solutions using the method of the current invention, followed by polymerization in the array (by light, heat or chemical), if needed the beads can be ejected off chip by using a high flow of the external fluid. The invention can also be used to make arrays of unilamellar vesicles or giant-unilamellar vesicles (GUVs). Lipid-stabilized aqueous droplets are produced by the method described. The external oil can then be replaced with an aqueous phase. When the droplets traverse the oil-lipid interface the lipid bilayer of the vesicle is formed. In this way, vesicle arrays of large size (hundreds or thousands of vesicles) can be made by microfabricating holes in the channel surfaces. Asymmetric vesicles can be obtained by switching the dissolved lipid content in the oil phase before introduction of the aqueous phase. Furthermore, multiple oil or water entries can be used to produce vesicles with variable and predictable lipid composition and content through the breadth of the array. After formation the GUVs (or lipid-stabilized aqueous droplets) can be ejected from the wells using a high flow rate of external fluid. The present invention has now been described in accordance with several exemplary embodiments, which are intended to be illustrative in all aspects, rather than restrictive. Thus, the present invention is capable of many variations in detailed implementation, which may be derived from the description contained herein by a person of ordinary skill in the art.
