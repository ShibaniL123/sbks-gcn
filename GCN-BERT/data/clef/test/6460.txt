COMPOSITIONS FOR TREATING OR PREVENTING ALCOHOL-INDUCED SYMPTOMS CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED PATENT APPLICATIONS [0001] This application claims the priority benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Serial No. 61/970,832, filed March 26, 2014, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0002] Veisalgia, more commonly known as an "alcohol hangover," is associated with significant physiological effects and socio-economic consequences. Costs associated with alcohol-induced hangovers and resulting absenteeism, poor job performance, and increased risk of injury in the United States alone have been estimated at $148 billion annually (Wiese et al., Ann of Int Med, 2000, 132(11): 897-902). Most of this cost is associated with light to moderate drinking - 54% of all alcohol-related problems in the workplace are caused by light drinkers, and 87% are caused by light-to moderate drinkers. The primary morbidity that affects light-to- moderate drinkers is the hangover, not the long-term consequences of alcohol abuse, such as cirrhosis. (Stockwell, Alcohol Clin Exp Res, 1998, 22(2 Suppl):63S-69S). [0003] Although individual responses to alcohol and the resultant hangover may vary considerably among the population, alcohol-induced effects include a core set of common symptoms and include headache, tremulousness, nausea, diarrhea, fatigue, anorexia, sleep disturbances, and a poor sense of well-being. The onset of alcohol symptoms usually develop within about 5-12 hours of the consumption of alcohol, but in some individuals and under certain circumstances, can develop within about 3 hours of such consumption. These symptoms are associated with decreased occupational, cognitive, and visual-spatial skill performance. [0004] It is widely established that there is no known proven cure or treatment for the amelioration or prevention of symptoms induced by alcohol consumption. Previous attempts to treat hangovers have been met with little success. In one systematic review (Pittler et al., BMJ (2005) Dec 24;331(7531):1515-8), all randomized controlled trials of any medical intervention for preventing or treating alcohol hangover were analyzed. This meta-analysis concluded that no known conventional or complementary intervention is effective for preventing or treating alcohol hangover. Virtually all analgesics, such as aspirin and ibuprofen, even at high doses, have no effect on hangovers. Caffeine and water do little to relieve the discomfort. Other home- remedies such as fruits/juices, cabbage, ginseng, green tea, charcoal, vitamins, eggs, and honey have failed to provide any significant relief. The only known effective way to avoid the symptoms of alcohol induced hangover is to practice abstinence or moderation. [0005] There is a medical and public health need to find a treatment or method of prevention of alcohol-induced symptoms. Described herein are methods and compositions that are effective in treating patients who develop alcohol-induced symptoms. [0006] All patents, patent applications, publications, documents, and articles cited herein are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.

[0069] These and other aspects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the subsequent detailed description and claims. It is to be understood that one, some, or all of the properties of the various embodiments described herein may be combined to form other embodiments of the present invention. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION [0070] The present invention is based on the unexpected finding that administration of a 5- HTIB/ID receptor agonist effectively prevents the onset of an alcohol-induced symptom, and reduces the intensity and/or the duration of an alcohol-induced symptom. The inventors have further found that when the 5-HTIB/ID receptor agonist is administered in combination with a NSAID, the reduction in the intensity is enhanced, and the duration of an alcohol-induced symptom is further reduced. The inventors believe that the combination of a 5-HTIB/ID receptor agonist and a NSAID which results in an enhanced therapeutic effect, allows low doses of 5- HTiB/iD receptor agonist to be administered for the treatment or prevention of alcohol-induced symptoms. [0071] Described herein are methods and compositions for the treatment or prevention of an alcohol-induced symptom. The compositions of the invention comprise a therapeutically effective amount of a 5-HTIB/ID receptor agonist either alone or with a therapeutically effective amount of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) for prevention of alcohol-induced symptoms prior to the actual consumption of alcohol, prevention of alcohol-induced symptoms prior to the onset of alcohol-induced symptoms, or treatment of alcohol-induced symptoms following the onset of alcohol-induced symptoms. General Techniques [0072] Unless defined otherwise, technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. [0073] The practice of the present invention will employ, unless otherwise indicated, conventional techniques of general chemistry, inorganic chemistry, organic chemistry, medicinal chemistry, protein biology, protein chemistry, pharmacology, molecular biology, microbiology, cell biology, biochemistry, and immunology, which are within the skill of the art.

In the event that any definition set forth below conflicts with any document incorporated herein by reference, the definition set forth shall control. [0075] As used herein, the singular form "a", "an", and "the" includes plural references unless indicated otherwise. Thus, for example, reference to "an alcohol-induced symptom" will refer to one or more alcohol-induced symptoms; "a 5-HT1B/1D agonist" will refer to one or more 5- HTIB/ID agonists; "a triptan" will refer to one or more triptans; and "a NSAID" will refer to one or more NSAIDs. [0076] It is understood that aspects and embodiments of the invention described herein include "comprising," "consisting," and "consisting essentially of aspects and embodiments. [0077] For all compositions described herein, and all methods using a composition described herein, the compositions can either comprise the listed components or steps, or can "consist essentially of the listed components or steps. When a composition is described as "consisting essentially of the listed components, the composition contains the components listed, and may contain other components which do not substantially affect the condition being treated, but do not contain any other components which substantially affect the condition being treated other than those components expressly listed; or, if the composition does contain extra components other than those listed which substantially affect the condition being treated, the composition does not contain a sufficient concentration or amount of the extra components to substantially affect the condition being treated. When a method is described as "consisting essentially of the listed steps, the method contains the steps listed, and may contain other steps that do not substantially affect the condition being treated, but the method does not contain any other steps which substantially affect the condition being treated other than those steps expressly listed. As a non-limiting specific example, when a composition is described as 'consisting essentially of a component, the composition may additionally contain any amount of pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, vehicles, or diluents and other such components which do not substantially affect the condition being treated. [0078] An "effective amount" or "therapeutically effective amount" as used herein refers to an amount of therapeutic compound, such as a 5-HT1B/1D agonist, triptan, or a NSAID, administered to a subject, either as a single dose or as part of a series of doses, which is effective to produce a desired therapeutic effect. [0079] The term "treating" as used herein, refers to retarding or reversing the progress of, or relieving or alleviating one or more alcohol-induced symptoms. The term "treatment," as used herein, refers to the act of treating one or more alcohol-induced symptoms, as the term "treating" is defined above.

In another embodiment, the headache is bilateral. The headache can be described to be pulsating, and can be aggravated by physical activity. As provided herein, when an individual develops a headache as an alcohol-induced, symptom the headache is not a migraine headache. [0092] Migraine headaches differ from alcohol-induced headaches. Both the 2nd and 3rd (beta) editions of the International Classification of Headaches (ICHD) by the International Headache Society (HIS) classifies an alcohol-induced headache and a migraine headache separately. An alcohol-induced headache is defined as a distinct entity and is classified as immediate alcohol- induced headache or a delayed alcohol-induced headache. The HIS ICHD-II and ICHD-III Codes for an immediate alcohol-induced headache and a delayed alcohol-induced headache, are under Section 8, 8.1.4.1 and 8.1.4.2, respectively. In this same classification system in both the ICHD-II and ICHD-III, a migraine headache is listed separately under Sectionl .

In certain embodiments, a selective 5-HT1B/1D agonist is a triptan. The triptans that may be used in the compositions and methods described here include, but are not limited to, sumatriptan or sumatriptan succinate (Imitrex™), eletriptan or eletriptan hydrobromide (Relpax™), rizatriptan or rizatriptan benzoate (Maxalt™), zolmitriptan (Zomig™), frovatriptan or frovatriptan succinate (Frova™), naratriptan or naratriptan hydrochloride (Amerge™), almotriptan or almotriptan malate (Axert™), combinations, salts, esters, amides, precursors, analogues, and derivatives thereof. [0117] The following patents and patent applications exemplify triptans that can be used in the compositions and methods of this invention, and refer to methods of preparing the same: US5554639 (sumatriptan succinate (Imitrex™)); US5545644 and US6110940 (eletriptan hydrobromide (Relpax™)); US5457895 (rizatriptan benzoate (Maxalt™)); US6750237 and US7220767 (zolmitriptan (Zomig™)); US5464864, US5616603, US5637611, US5827871 and US5962501 (frovatriptan succinate (Frova™)); and US5565447 (almotriptan malate (Axert)). [0118] Triptans are generally known in the art for the treatment of migraines. The use of migraine drugs is not known in the art to treat alcohol induced headaches or "hangovers." Migraine headaches differ from alcohol-induced headaches. Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) [0119] The Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) of the invention can be classified as salicylates, propionic acid derivatives, acetic acid derivatives, enolic acid (Oxicam) derivatives, anthranilic acid derivatives (fenamates), COX-2 inhibitors (Coxibs), sulphonanilides, or others. [0120] The salicylates of the invention may include acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), diflunisal, salsalate, and choline magnesium trisalicylate. [0121] The propionic acid derivatives of the invention may include tiaprofenic acid, ibuprofen , ketoprofen, flurbiprofen, naproxen, oxaporozin, dexibuprofen, dexketoprofen, fenoprofen, and loxoprofen. [0122] The acetic acid derivatives of the invention may include diclofenac, tolmetin, ketorolac, indomethacin, sulindac, etodolac, nabumetone, and aceclofenac.

[0128] In one embodiment of the invention, the NSAID is a short-acting NSAID. Short-acting NSAIDs typically have a half-life of six hours or less. [0129] In another embodiment of the invention, the NSAID is a long-acting NSAID. Long- acting NSAIDs typically have a half-life of six hours or greater. [0130] In one embodiment, the NSAID is a salicylate. In one particular embodiment, the NSAID is acetylsalicylic acid. [0131] NSAIDs are well known in the art but are not known for the effective treatment of alcohol-induced symptoms. In a meta-analysis of all known hangover interventions, it was concluded that aspirin and ibuprofen are ineffective (Pittler et al., BMJ (2005) Dec 24;331(7531):1515-8). Drug Dosages [0132] It is expected that the skilled practitioner will adjust the dosages of the compositions provided herein on a case by case basis using methods well established in clinical medicine depending on the severity of the alcohol-induced symptoms, the typical duration of the alcohol- induced symptom, the particular presentation and combination of alcohol-induced symptoms, and the like. The following are provided by way of guidelines only. Dosage of 5-ΗΤ1Β/1τ> Agonists [0133] For 5-HT1B/1D agonists and NSAIDs (particularly with respect to those already on the market) a therapeutically effective amount can include, but is not limited to, the dosage that has been determined as safe and effective. In particular applications, this does not exclude substantially lesser (or greater) dosages than established minimum (or maximum) dosages of a 5-HT1B/1D agonist or NSAID as is generally prescribed. A lower dose of either or both the 5- HT 1B/ ID agonist and the NSAID will minimize adverse effects and maximize recipient safety.
