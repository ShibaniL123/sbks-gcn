TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to an organopolysiloxane, a curable silicone composition primarily comprising the organopolysiloxane, a cured product formed by curing the composition, and an optical semiconductor device produced using the composition. Priority is claimed on Japanese Patent Application No. 2012-235183, filed on Oct. 24, 2012, the content of which is incorporated herein by reference. BACKGROUND ART Curable silicone compositions are used as sealing materials or protective coating materials for optical semiconductor elements in optical semiconductor devices such as light emitting diodes (LEDs). However, since the gas permeability of a cured product of a curable silicone composition is high, problems such as the discoloration of the sealing material due to corrosive gas and the reduction of brightness due to the corrosion of silver plate on the LED substrate occur when used in a high-brightness LED with high optical intensity and a large amount of heat generation. Therefore, a curable silicone composition comprising a branched-chain organopolysiloxane having methylphenylvinylsiloxane units, an organohydrogenpolysiloxane, and an addition reaction catalyst is proposed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2012-052045 as a curable silicone composition which forms a cured product with low gas permeability. However, such a curable silicone composition yields a slow curing reaction, and when curing is insufficient, tackiness occurs on the surface of the cured product, which is problematic in that dirt or dust adheres to the surface. In addition, there is also the problem that a large amount of time and energy are required to complete the curing reaction of such a curable silicone composition. An object of the present invention is to provide an organopolysiloxane having high hydrosilylation reactivity and forming a cured product with low gas permeability, and further to provide a curable silicone composition having high reactivity and forming a cured product with low gas permeability. Another object of the present invention is to provide a cured product with low gas permeability, and further to provide an optical semiconductor device with excellent reliability.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION First, the organopolysiloxane of the present invention will be described in detail. The organopolysiloxane of the present invention is represented by the following average unit formula: [in-line-formulae](R13SiO1/2)a(R2R3R4SiO1/2)b(R52SiO2/2)c(R3SiO3/2)d.[/in-line-formulae] In the formula, R1 are the same or different alkyl groups having from 1 to 12 carbons or alkenyl groups having from 2 to 12 carbons. Examples of the alkyl groups of R1 include methyl groups, ethyl groups, propyl groups, butyl groups, pentyl groups, hexyl groups, heptyl groups, octyl groups, nonyl groups, decyl groups, undecyl groups, and dodecyl groups.

R2 is an alkyl group having from 1 to 12 carbons, and examples of the alkyl group having from 1 to 12 carbons of R2 include the same alkyl groups as those of R1 described above. Of those, methyl groups are preferable. R3 are the same or different aryl groups having from 6 to 20 carbons or aralkyl groups having from 7 to 20 carbons. Examples of the aryl groups of R3 include phenyl groups, tolyl groups, xylyl groups, naphthyl groups, anthracenyl groups, phenanthryl groups, pyrenyl groups, and groups in which the hydrogen atoms of these aryl groups are substituted with alkyl groups such as methyl groups and ethyl groups, alkoxy groups such as methoxy groups and ethoxy groups, or halogen atoms such as chlorine atoms and bromine atoms. Of these, phenyl groups and naphthyl groups are preferable. Examples of the aralkyl groups of R3 include benzyl groups, phenethyl groups, naphthyl ethyl groups, naphthyl propyl groups, anthracenyl ethyl groups, phenanthryl ethyl groups, pyrenyl ethyl groups, and groups in which the hydrogen atoms of these aralkyl groups are substituted with alkyl groups such as methyl groups and ethyl groups, alkoxy groups such as methoxy groups and ethoxy groups, or halogen atoms such as chlorine atoms and bromine atoms. R4 is an alkenyl group having from 2 to 12 carbons, and examples of the alkenyl group having from 2 to 12 carbons of R4 include the same alkenyl groups as those of R1. Of those, vinyl groups are preferable. R5 are the same or different alkyl groups having from 1 to 12 carbons, alkenyl groups having from 2 to 12 carbons, or phenyl groups. Examples of the alkyl group of R5 include the same alkyl groups described for R1. Examples of the alkenyl group of R5 include the same alkenyl groups described for R1. Further, in the formula, “a”, “b”, “c”, and “d” are numbers that satisfy the following conditions: 0.01≦a≦0.45, 0.01≦b≦0.45, 0≦c≦0.7, 0.1≦d<0.9, and a+b+c+d=1. Preferably, “a”, “b”, “c”, and “d” are numbers that satisfy the following conditions: 0.05≦a≦0.45, 0.05≦b≦0.45, 0≦c≦0.5, 0.4≦d<0.85, and a+b+c+d=1.

This is also because the gas permeability of the cured product is reduced when “b” is greater than or equal to the lower limit of the range described above, and stickiness is unlikely to occur in the cured product when “b” is less than or equal to the upper limit of the range described above. This is also because the hardness of the cured product is favorable and the reliability improves when “c” is less than or equal to the upper limit of the range described above. This is also because the refractive index of the cured product is favorable when “d” is greater than or equal to the lower limit of the range described above, and the mechanical characteristics of the cured product improve when “d” is less than or equal to the upper limit of the range described above.

The content of component (B) in this composition is in the range of 0 to 70 mass %, preferably in the range of 0 to 50 mass %, and particularly preferably in the range of 0 to 40 mass % with respect to this composition. This is because when the content of component (B) is less than or equal to the upper limit of the range described above, it is possible to impart the cured product with softness, extensibility, and flexibility without increasing the gas permeability of the cured product, thus making it possible to improve the reliability of an optical semiconductor device produced using this composition. Component (C) is a crosslinking agent of the present composition and is an organopolysiloxane having at least 2 silicon-bonded hydrogen atoms in a molecule. Examples of the bond positions of the silicon-bonded hydrogen atoms in component (C) are molecular chain terminals and/or molecular side chains.

The content of component (C) in the present composition, per 1 mol of total alkenyl groups in components (A) and (B), is in a range such that the silicon-bonded hydrogen atoms in component (C) is in a range of 0.1 to 5 mol, and preferably in a range of 0.5 to 2 mol. This is because when the content of component (C) is greater than or equal to the lower limit of the range described above, the composition is cured sufficiently, and when the content is less than or equal to the upper limit of the range described above, the heat resistance of the cured product improves, thus making it possible to improve the reliability of an optical semiconductor device produced using this composition. Component (D) is a hydrosilylation reaction catalyst for accelerating the curing of this composition, and examples include platinum-based catalysts, rhodium-based catalysts, and palladium-based catalysts. Particularly, component (D) is preferably a platinum-based catalyst so that the curing of the present composition can be dramatically accelerated.

The content of component (D) in this composition is an effective amount for accelerating the curing of the composition. Specifically, in order to be able to sufficiently accelerate the curing reaction of this composition, the content of component (D) is preferably an amount so that the catalyst metal in component (D) is in the range of 0.01 to 500 ppm, more preferably in the range of 0.01 to 100 ppm, and particularly preferably in the range of 0.01 to 50 ppm in mass units with respect to this composition.
