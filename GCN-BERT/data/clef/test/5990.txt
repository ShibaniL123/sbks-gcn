FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention generally relates to molecular biology. More specifically, the present application is in the field of nucleic acid isolation. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Nucleic acid analysis plays a major role in the field of diagnostics and bioanalytics in research and development. Before a nucleic acid can be analyzed in a biospecific assay or used for other processes, it often must be isolated or purified from biological samples containing complex mixtures of different components such as proteins. Moreover, nucleic acids are often present in very small concentrations in a biological sample. As a result, nucleic acid presents a special challenge in terms of isolating them from their natural environment. Therefore, new methods of nucleic acid isolation are needed to improve the efficiency and/or sensitivity.

The following embodiments are put forth so as to provide those of ordinary skill in the art with a complete disclosure and description of how to perform the methods and use the nanostructure disclosed and claimed herein. Efforts have been made to ensure accuracy with respect to numbers (e.g., amounts, temperature, etc.), but some errors and deviations should be accounted for. It must be noted that, as used in the specification and the appended claims, the singular forms “a,” “an,” and “the” include plural forms of the same unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, reference to “a compound” includes a plurality of compounds. In this specification and in the claims that follow, reference will be made to a number of terms that shall be defined to have the following meanings unless a contrary intention is apparent. In one aspect, the present disclosure provides a kit comprising a nanostructure and a binding buffer. The nanostructure comprises at least one core nanoparticle and a silanization coating on the surface of the core nanoparticle. The binding buffer comprises a plurality of ingredients at concentration suitable to adjust the concentration of the plurality of ingredients in a solution containing at least one nucleic acid to concentration suitable for binding the nucleic acid through non-hybridization interaction to the nanostructure. The term “nanostructure” as used herein, refers to a particle having a diameter ranging from about 1 nm to about 1500 nm (e.g. from 1 nm to 1200 nm, from 1 nm to 1000 nm, from 1 nm to 800 nm, from 1 nm to 500 nm, from 1 nm to 400 nm, etc.). Such a nanostructure has been described in US Patent Application Serial No US 20100008862 A1, PCT Application Serial No WO2013112643, which are incorporated in whole and in part to the present application. In certain embodiment, the nanostructure comprises a single particle or a cluster of particles. In certain embodiments, the nanostructure comprises a core nanoparticle and a coating. The core nanoparticle can be a single or a cluster of particles. The coating can be any coating known in the art, for example, a polymer coating such as polyethylene glycol, silane, and polysaachrides (e.g. dextran and its derivatives). In some embodiments, the nanostructures provided herein contain a magnetic material. Suitable magnetic materials include, for example, ferrimagnetic or ferromagnetic materials (e.g., iron, nickel, cobalt, some alloys of rare earth metals, and some naturally occurring minerals such as lodestone), paramagnetic materials (such as platinum, aluminum), and superparamagnetic materials (e.g., superparamagnetic iron oxide or SPIO, and SPIO doped with other elements such as Mg, Cd, Ag, Au, Mn, Co, Ni, Zn, Ca.). The magnetic material has magnetic property which allows the nanostructure to be pulled or attracted to a magnet or in a magnetic field. Magnetic property can facilitate manipulation (e.g., separation, purification, or enrichment) of the nanostructures using magnetic interaction. The magnetic nanostructures can be attracted to or magnetically guided to an intended site when subject to an applied magnetic field, for example a magnetic field from high-filed and/or high-gradient magnets. For example, a magnet (e.g., magnetic grid) can be placed in the proximity of the nanostructures so as to attract the magnetic nanostructures. Any nanostructures having a magnetic property known in the art can be used. In certain embodiments, the nanostructure provided herein comprises a magnetic nanoparticle which comprises a magnetic material. For example, the magnetic nanoparticle of the nanostructure can be a superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) nanoparticle. The SPIO nanoparticle is an iron oxide nanoparticle, either magnemite (γ-Fe2O3) or magnetite (Fe3O4), or nanoparticles composed of both phases. The SPIO nanoparticle can be made using one or more methods. For example, SPIO nanoparticles can be synthesized with a suitable method and dispersed as a colloidal solution in organic solvents or water. Methods to synthesize the SPIO nanoparticles are known in the art (see, for example, Morteza Mahmoudi et al, Superparamagnetic Iron Oxide Nanoparticles: Synthesis, Surface Engineering, Cytotoxicity and Biomedical Applications, published by Nova Science Pub Inc, 2011). In one embodiment, the SPIO nanoparticles can be made through wet chemical synthesis methods which involve co-precipitation of Fe and Fe salts in the presence of an alkaline medium. During the synthesis, nitrogen may be introduced to control oxidation, surfactants and suitable polymers may be added to inhibit agglomeration or control particle size, and/or emulsions (such as water-in-oil microemulsions) may be used to modulate the physical properties of the SPIO nanoparticle (see, for example, Jonathan W. Gunn, The preparation and characterization of superparamagnetic nanoparticles for biomedical imaging and therapeutic application, published by ProQuest, 2008). In another embodiment, the SPIO nanoparticles can be generated by thermal decomposition of iron pentacarbonyl, alone or in combination with transition metal carbonyls, optionally in the presence of one or more surfactants (e.g., lauric acid and oleic acid) and/or oxidatants (e.g., trimethylamine-N-oxide), and in a suitable solvent (e.g., dioctyl ether or hexadecane) (see, for example, US patent application 20060093555). In another embodiment, the SPIO nanoparticles can also be made through gas deposition methods, which involves laser vaporization of iron in a helium atmosphere containing different concentrations of oxygen (see, Miller J. S. et al., Magnetism: Nanosized magnetic materials, published by Wiley-VCH, 2002). In certain embodiments, the SPIO nanoparticles are those disclosed in US patent application US20100008862. In certain embodiments, the nanostructure can further comprise a non-SPIO nanoparticle. The non-SPIO nanoparticles include, for example, metallic nanoparticles (e.g., gold or silver nanoparticles (see, e.g., Hiroki Hiramatsu, F.E.O., Chemistry of Materials 16, 2509-2511 (2004)), semiconductor nanoparticles (e.g., quantum dots with individual or multiple components such as CdSe/ZnS (see, e.g., M. Bruchez, et al, science 281, 2013-2016 (1998))), doped heavy metal free quantum dots (see, e.g., Narayan Pradhan et al, J. Am. chem. Soc. 129, 3339-3347 (2007)) or other semiconductor quantum dots); polymeric nanoparticles (e.g., particles made of one or a combination of PLGA (poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (see, e.g., Minsoung Rhee et al, Adv. Mater. 23, H79-H83 (2011)), PCL (polycaprolactone) (see, e.g., Marianne Labet et al, Chem. Soc. Rev. 38, 3484-3504 (2009)), PEG (poly ethylene glycol) or other polymers); siliceous nanoparticles; and non-SPIO magnetic nanoparticles (e.g., MnFe2O4 (see, e.g., Jae-Hyun Lee et al, Nature Medicine 13, 95-99 (2006)), synthetic antiferromagnetic nanoparticles (SAF) (see, e.g., A. Fu et al, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 48, 1620-1624 (2009)), and other types of magnetic nanoparticles). In certain embodiments, the non-SIPO nanoparticle is a colored nanoparticle, for example, a semiconductor nanoparticle such as a quantum dot. The non-SPIO nanoparticles can be prepared or synthesized using suitable methods known in the art, such as for example, sol-gel synthesis method, water-in-oil micro-emulsion method, gas deposition method and so on. For example, gold nanoparticles can be made by reduction of chloroaurate solutions (e.g., HAuCl4) by a reducing agent such as citrate, or acetone dicarboxulate. For another example, CdS semiconductor nanoparticle can be prepared from Cd(ClO4)2 and Na2S on the surface of silica particles. For another example, II-VI semiconductor nanoparticles can be synthesized based on pyrolysis of organometallic reagents such as dimethyl cadmium and trioctylphosphine selenide, after injection into a hot coordinating solvent (see, e.g., Gunter Schmid, Nanoparticles: From Theory to Application, published by John Wiley & Sons, 2011). Doped heavy metal free quantum dots, for example Mn-doped ZnSe quantum dots can be prepared using nucleation-doping strategy, in which small-sized MnSe nanoclusters are formed as the core and ZnSe layers are overcoated on the core under high temperatures. For another example, polymeric nanoparticles can be prepared by emulsifying a polymer in a two-phase solvent system, inducing nanosized polymer droplets by sonication or homogenization, and evaporating the organic solvent to obtain the nanoparticles. For another example, siliceous nanoparticles can be prepared by sol-gel synthesis, in which silicon alkoxide precursors (e.g., TMOS or TEOS) are hydrolyzed in a mixture of water and ethanol in the presence of an acid or a base catalyst, the hydrolyzed monomers are condensed with vigorous stirring and the resulting silica nanoparticles can be collected. For another example, SAFs, a non-SPIO magnetic nanoparticle, can be prepared by depositing a ferromagenetic layer on each of the two sides of a nonmagnetic space layer (e.g., ruthenium metal), along with a chemical etchable copper release layer and protective tantalum surface layers, using ion-bean deposition in a high vacuum, and the SAF nanoparticle can be released after removing the protective layer and selective etching of copper. In certain embodiments, the nanostructure comprises a combination of SPIO and non-SPIO nanoparticles. The size of the nanoparticles ranges from 1 nm to 900 nm in size (preferable 100-800 nm, 100-700 nm, 100-600 nm, 100-500 nm, 100-400 nm, 100-300 nm, 100-200 nm, 1 nm, 2 nm, 3 nm, 4 nm, 5 nm, 6 nm, 7 nm, 8 nm, 9 nm, 10 nm, 11 nm, 12 nm, 13 nm, 14 nm, 15 nm, 16 nm, 17 nm, 18 nm, 19 nm, 20 nm, 100 nm, 200 nm, 300 nm, 400 nm, 500 nm, 600 nm, 700 nm, 800 nm, 900 nm in size). The size of nanoparticles can be controlled by selecting appropriate synthesis methods and/or systems. For example, to control the size of nanoparticles, synthesis of nanoparticles can be carried out in a polar solvent which provides ionic species that can adsorb on the surface of the nanoparticles, thereby providing electrostatic effect and particle-particle repulsive force to help stabilize the nanoparticles and inhibit the growth of the nanoparticles. For another example, nanoparticles can be synthesized in a micro-heterogeneous system that allows compartmentalization of nanoparticles in constrained cavities or domains. Such a micro-heterogeneous system may include, liquid crystals, mono and multilayers, direct micelles, reversed micelles, microemulsions and vesicles. To obtain nanoparticles within a desired size range, the synthesis conditions may be properly controlled or varied to provide for, e.g., a desired solution concentration or a desired cavity range (a detailed review can be found at, e.g., Vincenzo Liveri, Controlled synthesis of nanoparticles in microheterogeneous systems, Published by Springer, 2006). The shape of the nanoparticles can be spherical, cubic, rod shaped (see, e.g., A. Fu et al, Nano Letters, 7, 179-182 (2007)), tetrapo-shaped (see, e.g., L. Manna et al, Nature Materials, 2, 382-385 (2003)), pyramidal, multi-armed, nanotube, nanowire, nanofiber, nanoplate, or any other suitable shapes. Methods are known in the art to control the shape of the nanoparticles during the preparation (see, e.g., Waseda Y. et al., Morphology control of materials and nanoparticles: advanced materials processing and characterization, published by Springer, 2004). For example, when the nanoparticles are prepared by the bottom-up process (i.e. from molecule to nanoparticle), a shape controller which adsorbs strongly to a specific crystal plane may be added to control the growth rate of the particle. A single nanostructure may comprise a single nanoparticle or a plurality or a cluster of mini-nanoparticles (A. Fu et al, J. Am. chem. Soc. 126, 10832-10833 (2004), J. Ge et al, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 46, 4342-4345 (2007), Zhenda Lu et al, Nano Letters 11, 3404-3412 (2011).). The mini-nanoparticles can be homogeneous (e.g., made of the same composition/materials or having same size) or heterogeneous (e.g., made of different compositions/materials or having different sizes). A cluster of homogeneous mini-nanoparticles refers to a pool of particles having substantially the same features or characteristics or consisting of substantially the same materials. A cluster of heterogeneous mini-nanoparticles refers to a pool of particles having different features or characteristics or consisting of substantially different materials. For example, a heterogeneous mini-nanoparticle may comprise a quantum dot in the center and a discrete number of gold (Au) nanocrystals attached to the quantum dot. When the nanoparticles are associated with a coating (as described below), different nanoparticles in a heterogeneous nanoparticle pool do not need to associate with each other at first, but rather, they could be individually and separately associated with the coating. In certain embodiments, a nanostructure disclosed comprises a plurality of nanoparticles. For example, the nanostructure contains 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 100 s or 1000 s nanoparticles. In certain embodiments, the nanostructure provided herein further comprises a coating. At least one core nanoparticle can be embedded in or coated with the coating. Any suitable coatings known in the art can be used, for example, a polymer coating and a non-polymer coating. The coating interacts with the core nanoparticles through 1) intra-molecular interaction such as covalent bonds (e.g., Sigma bond, Pi bond, Delta bond, Double bond, Triple bond, Quadruple bond, Quintuple bond, Sextuple bond, 3c-2e, 3c-4e, 4c-2e, Agostic bond, Bent bond, Dipolar bond, Pi backbond, Conjugation, Hyperconjugation, Aromaticity, Hapticity, and Antibonding), metallic bonds (e.g., chelating interactions with the metal atom in the core nanoparticle), or ionic bonding (cation π-bond and salt bond), and 2) inter-molecular interaction such as hydrogen bond (e.g., Dihydrogen bond, Dihydrogen complex, Low-barrier hydrogen bond, Symmetric hydrogen bond) and non covalent bonds (e.g., hydrophobic, hydrophilic, charge-charge, or π-stacking interactions, van der Waals force, London dispersion force, Mechanical bond, Halogen bond, Aurophilicity, Intercalation, Stacking, Entropic force, and chemical polarity). In certain embodiments, the nanostructure comprises a silanization coating on the surface of the nanoparticle. In an embodiment, the silanization coating is a coating including silane and/or silane-like molecules (or the reaction products of those molecules with the surface) onto the surface of the SPIO nanoparticles. The coating can be amorphous. The thickness of the coating can be controlled so that coated SPIO nanoparticles can be created for particular applications. In an embodiment, the silanization coating is made by cross-linking of trimethoxyl silanes with appropriate functional groups, such as a mercapto group, an amino group, a mercapto/amino group, a carboxyl group, a phosphonate group, an alkyl group, a polyethylene oxide group (PEG), and combinations thereof.

In an embodiment, the silanization coating can be about 1 to 60 nm thick. In an embodiment, the silanization coating can be about 1 to 100 nm thick. In an embodiment, the silanization coating can be about 1 to 500 nm thick. In an embodiment, the silanization coating can be about 1 to 1000 nm thick. In an embodiment, a silanization thickness of 2-3 nm is enough to provide a robust coating that will keep nanoparticle stable (e.g., no aggregates or sediments formed) inside physiological buffer (e.g., phosphate buffered saline with a pH of about 7.3) for greater than 6 months, greater than a year, 3-5 years, or longer. Thicker silanization coating can also be rationally controlled by adding a larger amount of trimethoxyl silane reagents or using sodium silicate. In certain embodiments, the coating comprises a low density, porous 3-D structure, as disclosed in U.S. Prov. Appl. 61/589,777 and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/460,007 (all references cited in the present disclosure are incorporated herein in their entirety). The low density, porous 3-D structure refers to a structure with density much lower (e.g., 10 s times, 20 s times, 30 s times, 50 s times, 70 s times, 100 s times) than existing mesoporous nanoparticles (e.g., mesoporous nanoparticles having a pore size ranging from 2 nm to 50 nm). (A. Vincent, et. al., J. Phys. Chem. C, 2007, 111, 8291-8298. J. E. Lee, et. al, J. Am. Chem. Soc, 2010, 132, 552-557. Y.-S. Lin, et. al, J. Am. Chem. Soc, 2011, 133, 20444-20457. Z. Lu, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed., 2010, 49, 1862-1866.) In certain embodiments, the low density, porous 3-D structure refers to a structure having a density of <1.0 g/cc (e.g., <100 mg/cc, <10 mg/cc, <5 mg/cc, <1 mg/cc, <0.5 mg/cc, <0.4 mg/cc, <0.3 mg/cc, <0.2 mg/cc, or <0.1 mg/cc) (for example, from 0.01 mg/cc to 10 mg/cc, from 0.01 mg/cc to 8 mg/cc, from 0.01 mg/cc to 5 mg/cc, from 0.01 mg/cc to 3 mg/cc, from 0.01 mg/cc to 1 mg/cc, from 0.01 mg/cc to 1 mg/cc, from 0.01 mg/cc to 0.8 mg/cc, from 0.01 mg/cc to 0.5 mg/cc, from 0.01 mg/cc to 0.3 mg/cc, from 0.01 mg/cc to 1000 mg/cc, from 0.01 mg/cc to 915 mg/cc, from 0.01 mg/cc to 900 mg/cc, from 0.01 mg/cc to 800 mg/cc, from 0.01 mg/cc to 700 mg/cc, from 0.01 mg/cc to 600 mg/cc, from 0.01 mg/cc to 500 mg/cc, from 0.1 mg/cc to 800 mg/cc, from 0.1 mg/cc to 700 mg/cc, from 0.1 mg/cc to 1000 mg/cc, from 1 mg/cc to 1000 mg/cc, from 5 mg/cc to 1000 mg/cc, from 10 mg/cc to 1000 mg/cc, from 20 mg/cc to 1000 mg/cc, from 30 mg/cc to 1000 mg/cc, from 30 mg/cc to 1000 mg/cc, from 30 mg/cc to 900 mg/cc, from 30 mg/cc to 800 mg/cc, or from 30 mg/cc to 700 mg/cc). The density of 3-D structure can be determined using various methods known in the art (see, e.g., Lowell, S. et al, Characterization of porous solids and powders: surface area, pore size and density, published by Springer, 2004). Exemplary methods include, Brunauer Emmett Teller (BET) method and helium pycnometry (see, e.g., Varadan V. K. et al., Nanoscience and Nanotechnology in Engineering, published by World Scientific, 2010). Briefly, in BET method, dry powders of the testing 3-D structure is placed in a testing chamber to which helium and nitrogen gas are fed, and the change in temperature is recorded and the results are analyzed and extrapolated to calculate the density of the testing sample. In helium pycnometry method, dry powders of the testing 3-D structure are filled with helium, and the helium pressure produced by a variation of volume is studied to provide for the density. The measured density based on the dry power samples does not reflect the real density of the 3-D structure because of the ultralow density of the 3-D structure, the framework easily collapses during the drying process, hence providing much smaller numbers in the porosity measurement than when the 3-D structure is fully extended, for example, like when the 3-D structure is fully extended in a buffer solution. In certain embodiments, the density of the 3-D structure can be determined using the dry mass of the 3-D structure divided by the total volume of such 3-D structure in an aqueous solution. For example, dry mass of the core particles with and without the 3-D structure can be determined respectively, and the difference between the two would be the total mass of the 3-D structure. Similarly, the volume of a core particle with and without the 3-D structure in an aqueous solution can be determined respectively, and the difference between the two would be the volume of the 3-D structure on the core particle in an aqueous solution. In certain embodiments, the porous nanostructure can be dispersed as multiple large nanoparticles coated with the 3-D structure in an aqueous solution, in such case, the total volume of the 3-D structure can be calculated as the average volume of the 3-D structure for an individual large nanoparticle multiplied with the number of the large nanoparticles. For each individual large nanoparticle, the size (e.g., radius) of the particle with 3-D structure can be determined with Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) techniques, and the size (e.g., radius) of the particle core without the 3-D structure can be determined under Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM), as the 3-D structure is substantially invisible under TEM. Accordingly, the volume of the 3-D structure on an individual large nanoparticle can be obtained by subtracting the volume of the particle without 3-D structure from the volume of the particle with the 3-D structure. The number of large nanoparticles for a given core mass can be calculated using any suitable methods. For example, an individual large nanoparticle may be composed of a plurality of small nanoparticles which are visible under TEM. In such case, the average size and volume of a small nanoparticle can be determined based on measurements under TEM, and the average mass of a small nanoparticle can be determined by multiplying the known density of the core material with the volume of the small particle. By dividing the core mass with the average mass of a small nanoparticle, the total number of small nanoparticles can be estimated. For an individual large nanoparticle, the average number of small nanoparticles in it can be determined under TEM. Accordingly, the number of large nanoparticles for a given core mass can be estimated by dividing the total number of small nanoparticles with the average number of small nanoparticels in an individual large nanoparticle. Alternatively, the low density, porous 3-D structure refers to a structure having 40%-99.9% (preferably 50% to 99.9%) of empty space or pores in the structure, where 80% of the pores having size of 1 nm to 500 nm in pore radius. The porosity of the 3-D structure can be characterized by the Gas/Vapor adsorption method. In this technique, usually nitrogen, at its boiling point, is adsorbed on the solid sample. The amount of gas adsorbed at a particular partial pressure could be used to calculate the specific surface area of the material through the Brunauer, Emmit and Teller (BET) nitrogen adsorption/desorption equation. The pore sizes are calculated by the Kelvin equation or the modified Kelvin equation, the BJH equation (see, e.g., D. Niu et al, J. Am. chem. Soc. 132, 15144-15147 (2010)). The porosity of the 3-D structure can also be characterized by mercury porosimetry (see, e.g., Varadan V. K. et al, supra). Briefly, gas is evacuated from the 3-D structure, and then the structure is immersed in mercury. As mercury is non-wetting at room temperature, an external pressure is applied to gradually force mercury into the sample. By monitoring the incremental volume of mercury intruded for each applied pressure, the pore size can be calculated based on the Washburn equation. Alternatively, the low density, porous 3-D structure refers to a structure that has a material property, that is, the porous structure (except to the core nanoparticle or core nanoparticles) could not be obviously observed or substantially transparent under transmission electron microscope, for example, even when the feature size of the 3-D structure is in the 10 s or 100 s nanometer range. The term “obviously observed” or “substantially transparent” as used herein means that, the thickness of the 3-D structure can be readily estimated or determined based on the image of the 3-D structure under TEM. The nanostructure (e.g., nanoparticles coated with or embedded in/on a low density porous 3-D structure) can be observed or measured by ways known in the art. For example, the size (e.g., radius) of the nanostructure with the 3-D structure can be measured using DLS methods, and the size (e.g., radius) of the core particle without the 3-D structure can be measured under TEM. In certain embodiments, the thickness of the 3-D structure is measured as 10 s, 100 s nanometer range by DLS, but cannot be readily determined under TEM. For example, when the nanostructures provided herein are observed under Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM), the nanoparticles can be identified, however, the low density porous 3-D structure can not be obviously observed, or is almost transparent (e.g., see FIGS. 2 and 3). This distinguishes the nanostructures provided herein from those reported in the art that comprise nanoparticles coated with crosslinked and size tunable 3-D structure, including the mesoporous silica nanoparticles or coating (see, e.g., J. Kim, et. al, J. Am. Chem. Soc, 2006, 128, 688-689; J. Kim, et. al, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed., 2008, 47, 8438-8441). This feature also indicates that the low density porous 3-D structure provided herein has a much lower density and/or is highly porous in comparison to other coated nanoparticles known in the art. The porosity of the 3-D structure can be further evaluated by the capacity to load different molecules (see, e.g., Wang L. et al, Nano Research 1, 99-115 (2008)). As the 3-D structure provided herein has a low density, it is envisaged that more payload can be associated with the 3-D structure than with other coated nanoparticles. For example, when 3-D structure is loaded with organic fluorophores such as Rhodamin, over 105 Rhodamin molecules can be loaded to 3-D structure of one nanoparticle. In certain embodiments, the low density structure refers to a structure capable of absorbing or carrying a fluorescent payload whose fluorescence intensity is at least 100 fold of that of the free fluorescent molecule (e.g., at least 150 fold, 200 fold, 250 fold, 300 fold, 350 fold, 400 fold, 450 fold, 500 fold, 550 fold or 600 fold). The fluorescence intensity of a loaded nanoparticle can be quantified under the same excitation and emission wave lengths as that of the fluorescent molecules. The fluorescence intensity of the loaded low density structure indicates the payload of the fluorescent molecule, and also indirectly reflects the porosity of the low density structure. In certain embodiments, the low density, porous 3-D structure is made of silane-containing or silane-like molecules (e.g., silanes, organosilanes, alkoxysilanes, silicates and derivatives thereof). In certain embodiments, the silane-containing molecule comprises an organosilane, which is also known as silane coupling agent. Organosilane has a general formula of RxSiY(4-x), wherein R group is an alkyl, aryl or organo functional group. Y group is a methoxy, ethoxy or acetoxy group, x is 1, 2 or 3. The R group could render a specific function such as to associate the organosilane molecule with the surface of the core nanoparticle or other payloads through covalent or non-covalent interactions. The Y group is hydro lysable and capable of forming a siloxane bond to crosslink with another organosilane molecule. Exemplary R groups include, without limitation, disulphidealkyl, aminoalkyl, mercaptoalkyl, vinylalkyl, epoxyalkyl, and methacrylalkyl, carboxylalkyl groups. The alkyl group in an R group can be methylene, ethylene, propylene, and etc. Exemplary Y groups include, without limitation, alkoxyl such as OCH3, OC2H5, and OC2H4OCH3. For example, the organosilane can be amino-propyl-trimethoxysilane, mercapto-propyl-trimethoxysilane, carboxyl-propyl-trimethoxysilane, amino-propyl-triethoxysilane, mercapto-propyl-triethoxysilane, carboxyl-propyl-triethoxysilane, Bis-[3-(triethoxysilyl) propyl]-tetrasulfide, Bis-[3-(triethoxysilyl) propyl]-disulfide, aminopropyltriethoxysilane, N-2-(aminoethyl)-3-amino propyltrimethoxysilane, Vinyltrimethoxysilane, Vinyl-tris(2-methoxyethoxy) silane, 3-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxy silane, 2-(3,4-epoxycyclohexy)-ethyl trimethoxysilane, 3-glycidoxy-propyltriethoxysilane, 3-isocyanatopropyltriethoxysilane, and 3-cyanatopropyltriethoxy silane. In certain embodiments, the silanization coating contains one or more functional groups within in or on the surface of the coating. The functional groups may be introduced during the formation of the coating during the cross-linking process, for example, by adding silicon-containing compounds containing such functional groups during the cross-linking, in particular, during the ending stage of the cross-linking process. The functional groups may also be introduced after the formation of the cross-linking product, for example, by introducing functional groups to the surface of the cross-linking product by chemical modification. In certain embodiments, the functional groups are inherent in the coating. The functional groups serve as linkage between the nanosructure and payioads (e.g., nucleic acids to be captured). Examples of the functional groups include, but are not limited to amino, mercapto, carboxyl, phosphonate, biotin, streptavidin, avidin, hydroxyl, aikyl or other hydrophobic molecules, polyethylene glycol or other liydrophilic molecules, and photo cleavable, thermo cleavable or pH responsive linkers. In certain embodiment, the silanization coating does not contain a carboxyl functional group. As illustrated in Example 6, the nanostructure comprising a silanization coating that does not contain a carboxyl group demonstrates a higher binding efficiency as compared to the nanostructure comprising a carboxyl coating. In certain embodiment, the kit comprises a nanostructure and a binding buffer. The binding buffer comprises a plurality of ingredients at concentration suitable to adjust the concentration of the plurality of ingredients in a solution containing at least one nucleic acid to concentration suitable for binding the nucleic acid through non-hybridization interaction to the nanostructure, wherein the plurality of ingredients of the solution comprises salt and polyethylene glycol. The term “salt” as used herein, refers to a compound produced by the interaction of an acid and a base. Exemplary salts include, but are not limited to, sodium chloride (table salt), sodium iodide, sodium bromide, lithium bromide, lithium iodide, potassium phosphate, sodium bicarbonate, and the like. In water and other aqueous solutions, salts typically dissociate into an “anion” or negatively charged subcomponent, and a “cation” or positively charge subcomponent. For example, when sodium chloride (NaCl) is dissolved in water, it dissociates into a sodium cation (Na+) and a chloride anion (Cl−). Exemplary salts are discussed, e.g., in Waser, Jurg, Quantitative Chemistry, A Laboratory Text, W. A. Benjamin, Inc., New York, page 160, (1966). The term “non-hybridization interaction” used herein refers to the process of establishing a non-covalent, non-sequence-specific interaction between nucleic acid molecules and nanostructure. Through a non-hybridization interaction, binding of different nucleic acid molecules to nanostructure does not require an interaction between two or more complementary strands of nucleic acids or based on the hydrogen bonding between A and T or U, or G and C. The term “nucleic acid” as used herein, refers to a polymer of ribonucleosides or deoxyribonucleosides typically comprising phosphodiester linkages between subunits. Other linkages between subunits include, but are not limited to, methylphosphonate, phosphorothioate, and peptide linkages. Such nucleic acids include, but are not limited to, genomic DNA, cDNA, single strand DNA, hnRNA, mRNA, rRNA, tRNA, fragmented nucleic acid, nucleic acid obtained from subcellular organelles such as mitochondria or chloroplasts, and nucleic acid obtained from microorganisms or DNA or RNA viruses that may be present on or in a biological sample. A “solution containing nucleic acid” can be any aqueous solution, such as a solution containing DNA, RNA and/or PNAs. Such a solution can also contain other components, such as other biomolecules, inorganic compounds and organic compounds. The solution can contain DNA which is the reaction product of PCR amplification. In certain embodiment, the solution is a biological sample. The term “biological sample” is used in a broad sense and is intended to include a variety of biological sources or solutions that contain nucleic acids. Such sources include, without limitation, whole tissues, including biopsy materials and aspirates; in vitro cultured cells, including primary and secondary cells, transformed cell lines, and tissue and cellular explants; whole blood, red blood cells, white blood cells, and lymph; body fluids such as urine, sputum, semen, saliva, secretions, eye washes and aspirates, lung washes, cerebrospinal fluid, abscess fluid, and aspirates. Included in this definition of “biological sample” are samples processed from biological sources, including but not limited to cell lysates and nucleic acid-containing extracts, or serum/plasma samples. A “cell lysate”, as used herein, is a solution containing cells which contain cloned DNA and genomic DNA and whose cell membranes have been disrupted, with the result that the contents of the cell, including the DNA contained therein, are in the solution. Any organism containing nucleic acid may be a source of a biological sample, including, but not limited to, any eukaryotes, eubacteria, archaebacteria, or virus. Fungal and plant tissues, such as leaves, roots, stems, and caps, are also within the scope of the present invention. Microorganisms and viruses that may be present on or in a biological sample are within the scope of the invention. The solution containing nucleic acid may also be an agarose solution. For example, a mixture of DNA is separated, according to methods known to one skilled in the art, such as by electrophoresis on an agarose gel. A plug of agarose containing DNA of interest can be excised from the gel and added to 1-10 volumes of 0.5×SSC (0.75M NaCl, 0.0075M Sodium Citrate, pH 7.0) preferably 4 volumes. The mixture is then melted at a temperature of from about 60 to 80 minutes, to create an agarose solution containing DNA. In some embodiments, the plurality of ingredients of the solution further comprises ingredients selected from the group consisting of acid, base, dNTP, amino acids, sugar, lipid, protein and carbohydrate. In certain embodiments, the polyethylene glycol has a molecular weight of between about 6000 and about 10,000, and wherein the salt is selected from the group consisting of sodium chloride, magnesium chloride, calcium chloride, potassium chloride, lithium chloride, barium chloride and cesium chloride. In certain embodiments, the concentration of the polyethylene glycol suitable for binding the nucleic acid to the nanostructure is between about 5% and about 15% and wherein the concentration of salt suitable for binding the nucleic acid to the nanostructure is between about 0.5 M and about 5.0 M.

The following examples are presented to illustrate the present invention. They are not intended to limiting in any manner. General Methodology The nanostructure used in the following examples were prepared according to the methods disclosed in this application and those disclosed in US Application Series No US 20100008862 and PCT Application Series No W02013112643A1. The nanostructures were 200-800 nm in diameter. The nanostructure is typically made of nanoparticles having a coating with silocon-containing compounds that contains functional groups. The functional groups on the nanoparticles could include amino, mercapto, carboxyl, phosphonate, biotin, streptavidin, avidin, hydroxyl, alikyl or other hydrophobic molecules, polyethylene glycol or other lydrophilic molecules, and photo cleavable, thermo cleavable or pH responsive linker molecules. The functional groups can be introduced to the coating compounds during the cross-linking, in particular, during the ending stage of the cross-linking process. The functional groups may also be introduced after the formation of the cross-linking product, for example, by introducing functional groups to the surface of the cross-linking product by chemical modification. In certain embodiments, the functional groups are inherent in the coating. In general, 20 ng of nanostructure were used per 1000 ng of DNA sample. The nanostructures are stored in 10% PEG 8000, 1M NaCl, 20 mM Tris.Cl storage buffer at a concentration of 2 mg/ml before use. In a typical DNA capture experiment, remove nanostructures from storage and bring them to room temperature. Vortex the nanostructures for 10-20 seconds before use. Remove 20 ng of nanostructures and put into a clean 1.5 ml reaction tube. Collect the nanostructure using magnet and remove the supernatant. Add DNA sample to the nanostructure, vortex or pipette the reaction solution to mix thoroughly. Incubate the nanostructure-DNA reaction at room temperature for 15-30 minutes. After incubation, use the magnet to separate the DNA-bound nanostructure from the solution. Carefully remove the supernatant with a pipette, taking care not to disturb the nanostructure pellet. Keeping the magnet in place, wash the nanostructure pellet by adding 100 ul freshly prepared 70% ethanol. Let stand for 2 minute. Remove and discard the ethanol, repeat the wash step once more. Allow the sample to air dry at room temperature for 5 minutes. Elute the captured DNA from the nanostructures by adding 20 ul of the Elution Buffer, gently pipette to mix well and incubate for 5-10 minute at room temperature, then separate the nanostructures from the eluted DNA with magnet. Transfer the supernatant containing the DNA products to a clean tube. The purified DNA is ready to use for subsequent evaluation. To evaluate the results of DNA capture, eluted DNA may be resolved in agarose by electrophoresis. All agarose gels were using 1%-3% final agarose (Fisher Scientific) with voltage at 100V-150V and with run time from 40-60 minutes. The gels were post-stained with ethidium bromide and visualized and photographed under UV. Example 1 Isolation of Salmon Sperm DNA Using Nanostructure Incubate 20 ul of nanostructure or commercially available nanoparticles (Ampure) with 1000 ng salmon sperm DNA for 30 minutes. The bound DNA were eluted in TE (Tris.Cl EDTA) and analyzed on 3% agarose gel. As shown in FIG. 2, the yield of DNA capture using the nanostructure is comparable to the commercially available nanoparticle. In another experiment, incubate 1000 ng genomic DNA of OC1-LY8 cells and salmon sperm DNA with 20 ul of nanostructure or commercially available nanoparticles (Ampure). DNA captured by nanostructure were eluted and quantified using Picogreen fluorescent reagent (Life Technologies). As shown in FIG. 3, the capturing efficiency of nanostructure and commercially available nanoparticles are comparable. In yet another experiment, incubate 5,000 ng or 10,000 ng of salmon sperm DNA with 20 ul nanostructure or commercially available nanoparticles (Ampure) under room temperature for 1 hour, then eluted and analyzed on 3% agrose gel. As shown in FIG. 4, using nanostructure yield a significant higher binding capacity than commercially available nanoparticles under the saturation conditions.

Collect the nanostructure using magnet and remove the supernatant. Add 100, 250, 500 or 1,000 ng DNA ladder to the nanostructure, vortex or pipette the reaction solution to mix thoroughly. Incubate the nanostructure-DNA reaction at room temperature for 30 minutes. After incubation, use the magnet to separate the DNA-bound nanostructure from the solution. Carefully remove the supernatant with a pipette, taking care not to disturb the nanostructure pellet. Keeping the magnet in place, wash the nanostructure pellet by adding 100 ul freshly prepared 70% ethanol. Let stand for 2 minute. Remove and discard the ethanol, repeat the wash step once more. Allow the sample to air dry at room temperature for 5 minutes. Elute the captured DNA from the nanostructures by adding 20 ul of the Elution Buffer, gently pipette to mix well and incubate for 5-10 minute at room temperature, then separate the nanostructures from the eluted DNA with magnet. Transfer the supernatant containing the DNA products to a clean tube. The purified DNA is quantified using Picogreen fluorescent reagent. As shown in FIG. 6, the recovery rate is above 75% percent and remains stable within all DNA concentration range. Example 3 Isolation of Trace Amount of DNA Using Nanostructure A DNA template of 82 bp was spiked into 1 ml of human blood sample, a biotin-labeled primer was used to specifically target this 82 bp template in blood sample. The blood sample was boiled for 10 minutes to denature DNA, then 10 pmol biotin-labeled primer and 40 ul nanostructure coated with Streptavidin were mixed with the blood sample at room temperature for 1 hour. The DNA template was specifically captured to the nanostructure by Streptavidine-biotin complex. The eluted DNA was further amplified by PCR and analyzed on 3% agrose gel. FIG. 5 shows that Streptavidin coated nanostructure can detect DNA to as low as 50 pg/ml blood, and there is no-unspecific binding.
