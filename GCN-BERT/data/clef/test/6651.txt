Step C: 2-Cyclopropyl-8-ethyl-6-(trifluoromethyl)-[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyridine. To a solution of 1,2-diamino-3-ethyl-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyridin-1-ium 2,4,6-trimethylbenzenesulfonate (400 mg, 0.98 mmol) in AcOH (11.6 mL) were added Cu(OAc)2 (89.5 mg, 0.49 mmol) and cyclopropanecarbaldehyde (0.221 mL, 2.96 mmol). The reaction was heated at 70Â° C. for 6 h, then cooled to rt and diluted with EtOAc. The reaction was cooled to rt and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated in vacuo, and the filtrate was re-dissolved in EtOAc. The organic layer was washed with NH4C1, and re-extracted with EtOAc. The combined organics were washed with brine, dried over Na2SO4 and filtered. Purification (FCC, SiO2; 0-50% EtOAc/hexanes) afforded the title compound as a pale yellow solid (168 mg, 67%).
