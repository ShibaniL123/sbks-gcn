METHODS OF USING PIGMENT EPITHELIUM DERIVED FACTOR (PEDF) FOR THE TREATMENT AND PREVENTION OF AGENT-INDUCED GONADAL OR UTERINE TOXICITY FIELD AND BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention, in some embodiments thereof, relates to methods of using PEDF for the treatment and prevention of agent-induced gonadal or uterine toxicity. Over the past three decades, there has been a remarkable improvement in the survival rates of cancer patients owing to progress in earlier stage diagnosis and improvements in treatment. As a consequence, greater attention has been focused on the delayed effects of cancer treatments on the life quality of healed subjects. The treatment for most cancer types involves cytotoxic treatments such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy that may partially or definitively affect the reproductive function, hinder the hormonal milieu and gonadal reserve, and may subsequently induce either sterility or early menopause. The risk of gonadal and uterine toxicity following cancer therapy appears to be treatment and dose-dependent and age related. Thus, for example the use of Tamoxifen as an antagonist to estrogen receptor for the treatment of breast cancer, for example, results in an agonistic activity in the uterus that results in a range of endometrial pathologies including hyperplasia and endometrial cancer (Obstet Gynecol. 2014 Jun; 123(6): 1394-7). Some of the chemotherapeutic agents e.g., doxorubicin (DXR), cyclophosphamide, busulfan and ifosfamide, which are frequently used for the treatment of various cancers including breast cancer, lymphomas, leukemia and sarcomas, are known to have irreversible gonadotoxic effects. Gonadal dysfunction following radiotherapy may occur when the gonads are close to or within the radiation field [Bryd0y et al. Acta Oncologica (2007). 46: 480-489] . Gonadal dysfunction following cancer treatment has been attributed both to induction of vascular damage leading to ischemia and to direct acute insult to the gonads by apoptosis induction such as by induction of oxidative stress and increase in intracellular calcium [Ben-Aharon et al., Reprod Biol Endocrinol (2010), 8:20; Kampfer et al. Life Sci. (2014) 97(2): 129-36; Bar- Josef et a. Reproductive Toxicology (2010), 30: 566-572; and Bar- Joseph et al. PLoS One (2011) 6: e23492]. Strategies aiming to preserve fertility in patients with different types of malignancies include in-vitro fertilization (IVF), embryo, oocyte and semen cryopreservation, cortical and whole ovary cryopreservation, ovarian transplantation, ovarian transposition, and GnRH agonist protection. To date, embryo and mature oocyte cryopreservation following IVF are the only techniques endorsed by the American Society of Reproductive Medicine. Pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) is a non-inhibitory member of the serine protease inhibitors (serpin) superfamily, which was first described as a neurotrophic factor, able to promote and support the growth of neuronal cells. It was later found that on top of having neurotrophic activity, PEDF has an anti-angiogenic, anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative properties. To date, two distinct PEDF receptors were proposed: an 80kDa PEDF putative receptor (PEDF-RN; PNPLA2) involved in PEDF neuroprotecting, pro-survival functions; and a 60kDa PEDF putative receptor (PEDF-RA; Laminin receptor) involved in PEDF pro-apoptotic, anti-angiogenic activities [Manalo et al. Expert Opin Ther Pat (2011): 21, 121-130; and Yamagishi et al. Cell Tissue Res (2005) 320: 437-445]. Although originally discovered in culture media of retinal pigment epithelial cells, PEDF is widely expressed throughout the body: the nervous system, ovary, uterine, liver and plasma. Despite the significant expression of PEDF in the reproductive system, there is only limited data about its function in the ovary and uterus [Cheung et al., Endocrinology, 2006. 147(9): p. 4179-91; Chuderland et al. J Clin Endocrinol Metab (2013) 98: E258-266; and Chuderland et al. Mol Hum Reprod (2013) 19: 72-81; Pollina et al., Cell Cycle, 2008. 7(13): p. 2056-70; Palmieri et al. Exp Cell Res, 1999. 247(1): p. 142-7.]. Previous work has suggested using PEDF in the treatment of tumors mainly due to its anti-angiogenic effect [Manalo et al. Expert Opin Ther Pat (2011): 21, 121-130]. Additional Related Background Art: U.S. Patent Publication Number US20130053312. U.S. Patent Publication Number US20030216286.

DESCRIPTION OF SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION The present invention, in some embodiments thereof, relates to methods of using PEDF for the treatment and prevention of agent-induced gonadal or uterine toxicity. Before explaining at least one embodiment of the invention in detail, it is to be understood that the invention is not necessarily limited in its application to the details set forth in the following description or exemplified by the Examples. The invention is capable of other embodiments or of being practiced or carried out in various ways. The treatment for most cancer types involves cytotoxic treatments such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy that may partially or definitively induce gonadal or uterine toxicity. PEDF is a multifunctional factor endowed with neurotrophic, anti-angiogenic, anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative properties which is ubiquitously expressed in the body. Despite significant expression in the reproductive system, there is only limited data about PEDF function in the ovary and uterus. Previous work has suggested using PEDF in the treatment of tumors due to its direct anti-tumorigenic and anti-angiogenic effect. However, the role of PEDF in protecting the gonads from the destructive effects of chemotherapy and radiotherapy has never been disclosed. Whilst reducing the present invention to practice, the present inventors have now uncovered that administration of PEDF can prevent gonadal or uterine toxicity induced by toxic agents such as chemotherapy treatment and suggest its use in the treatment or prevention of agent-induced gonadal toxicity and tamoxifen-induced uterine toxicity. As is illustrated herein below (Example 1 and Figures 1A-B and 2A-B), the present inventors have found that the chemotherapeutic agent DXR reduced PEDF mRNA expression in ovaries of DXR-treated mice and that administration of rPEDF after DXR treatment significantly improved the number of the ovulated oocytes in DXR-treated mice. Furthermore, the present inventors have found that oxidative stress induction (e.g., H2O2) had a negative dose dependent effect on PEDF mRNA expression in LH-15 rat granulosa cells and administration of rPEDF significantly attenuated the rate of oxidative stress-related to H2O2 in general i.e., oxidative stress-induced apoptosis, decreased the elevated oxidative stress-induced expression of the pro- apoptotic protein BAX and increased SOD-1 and GPX-1 levels (Example 2 and Figures 4A-B, 5A-C and 6A-B). As further shown in Example 3 and Figures 6A-C and 7A-B, the present inventors have demonstrated that granulosa cells, theca cells and oocytes express the PEDF pro-survival receptor, PNPLA2; and once stimulated by rPEDF, LH- 15 granulosa cells exhibit phosphorylation of AKT indicative of activation of pro- survival cell signaling. Consequently these findings show that administration of PEDF can prevent gonadal toxicity induced by chemotherapy treatment such as DXR and suggest its use in the treatment or prevention of agent-induced gonadal toxicity. As is further illustrated herein below (Example 4 and Figures 8, 9A-B, 15, 16A- C, 18, 19A-B, 20), the present inventors have shown that both sub-acute and prolonged tamoxifen treatment increased uterine weight, upregulated VEGF protein levels, decreased PEDF protein levels and increased the ratio between VEGF and PEDF protein levels in uteri of ovariectomized mice. The present inventors have shown that combined administration of tamoxifen and rPEDF significantly attenuated the adverse effects induced by tamoxifen on uterine weight and VEGF expression. Furthermore, as shown in Example 4 and Figures 10, 13A-B, 14A-B, 17, 21A-B and 22A-B) tamoxifen treatment up-regulated the expression of the PEDF pro-survival receptor, PNPLA2; and combined treatment with tamoxifen and rPEDF induced increase in the phosphorylation of the pro-apoptotic signaling molecule, JNK, a decrease in the phosphorylation of the pro-survival signaling molecule, AKT and a specific decrease in ERa uterine expression. Consequently, these findings show that administration of PEDF can prevent the deleterious effects on the uterus induced by tamoxifen treatment and suggest its use in the treatment or prevention of tamoxif en-induced uterine toxicity. Thus, according to an aspect of the present invention there is provided a method of treating or preventing gonadal toxicity induced by an agent in a subject in need thereof, the method comprising administering to the subject a therapeutically effective amount of pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF), thereby treating or preventing the gonadal toxicity induced by the agent in the subject. According to another aspect of the present invention there is provided a method of treating or preventing gonadal toxicity induced by an agent in a subject in need thereof, the method comprising: (a) determining gonadal function in a subject; and (b) administering to the subject a therapeutically effective amount of pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF), thereby treating or preventing the gonadal toxicity induced by the agent in said subject. According to yet another aspect of the present invention there is provided a pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) for use in the treatment or prevention of gonadal toxicity induced by an agent in a subject. As used herein, "Pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF)", also known as serpin Fl, EPC-1, cell proliferation inducing gene 35 protein and PIG35 and interchangeably referred to rPEDF, refers to a polynucleotide and an expression product e.g. protein of the SERPINF1 gene. According to a specific embodiment, the PEDF protein refers to the human protein, such as provided in the following GenBank Numbers NM_002615.4 (SEQ ID NO: 1), M76979 (SEQ ID NO: 26), or NP_002606.3 (SEQ ID NO: 27). The PEDF of the present invention is functional in at least one of but in some embodiments all of preventing gonadal toxicity, preventing uterine toxicity, interfering with VEGF signaling, inducing pro-survival, anti- angiogenic, anti- inflammatory, anti-tumorigenic and/or anti-oxidative signals. Methods of qualifying PEDF for use in accordance with the present invention are well known in the art (some are described in the Examples section e.g., effect on uterine weight of tamoxifen treated animals, effect on VEGF uterine expression of tamoxifen treated animals, effect on ERa uterine expression of tamoxifen treated animals, effect on the number of ovulated oocytes of DXR treated animals, effect of oxidative stress on apoptosis and expression of apoptosis related proteins of granulose cells, etc.).

According to a specific embodiment, the biological sample comprises an endometrial biopsy. As the present inventors have discovered that treatment with tamoxifen resulted in increased VEGF protein levels, decreased PEDF protein levels and increased VEGF / PEDF protein levels ratio. Thus, according to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of diagnosing tamoxifen-induced uterine toxicity in a subject, the method comprising determining the level of PEDF in a biological sample of the subject following treatment with tamoxifen, wherein a decrease below a predetermined threshold is indicative of the tamoxifen-induced uterine toxicity in the subject. According to a specific embodiment, the method of diagnosing tamoxifen- induced uterine toxicity further comprises determining the level of VEGF in the biological sample, wherein an increase above a predetermined threshold is indicative of the tamoxifen-induced uterine toxicity in the subject. According to another specific embodiment, an increase in the ratio between VEGF and PEDF above a predetermined threshold in the biological sample is indicative of the tamoxifen-induced uterine toxicity in the subject. "Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)", also known as VEGF- A, Vascular permeability factor, VPF, and MVCD1, refers to the polynucleotide and an expression product e.g. polypeptide of the VEGFA gene. According to a specific embodiment, the VEGF protein refers to the human protein, such as provided in the following GenBank Numbers NP_001020537 (SEQ ID NO: 29), NP_001020538 (SEQ ID NO: 30), NP_001020539 (SEQ ID NO: 31), NP_001020540 (SEQ ID NO: 32), NP_001020541 (SEQ ID NO: 33), NP_001028928 (SEQ ID NO: 34), NP_001165093 (SEQ ID NO: 35), NP_001165094 (SEQ ID NO: 36), NP_001165095 (SEQ ID NO: 37), NP_001165096 (SEQ ID NO:38), NP_001165097 (SEQ ID NO: 39), NP_001165098 (SEQ ID NO: 40), NP_001165099 (SEQ ID NO: 41), NP_001165100 (SEQ ID NO: 42), NP_001165101 (SEQ ID NO: 43), NP_001191313 (SEQ ID NO: 44), NP_001191314 (SEQ ID NO: 45), NP_001273973 (SEQ ID NO: 46) and NP_003367 (SEQ ID NO:47). As used herein the term "diagnosing" refers to determining presence or absence of a pathology (e.g., a disease, disorder, condition or syndrome, e.g., uterine toxicity), classifying a pathology or a symptom, determining a severity of the pathology, monitoring pathology progression, forecasting an outcome of a pathology and/or prospects of recovery and screening of a subject for a specific disease. As used herein, the phrases "level of PEDF" or "level of VEGF" refer to the degree of gene expression and/or gene product activity of PEDF or VEGF, respectively, in a biological sample. Accordingly, the level of PEDF and/or VEGF can be determined at the amino acid level using protein detection methods. Thus, the level of PEDF and/or VEGF amino acid sequence (protein) can be determined using a PEDF or VEGF specific antibodies via the formation of an immunocomplex [i.e., a complex formed between the PEDF antigen present in the biological sample and the PEDF specific antibody or a complex formed between the VEGF antigen present in the biological sample and the VEGF specific antibody] . The immunocomplex of the present invention can be formed at a variety of temperatures, salt concentration and pH values which may vary depending on the method and the biological sample used and those of skills in the art are capable of adjusting the conditions suitable for the formation of each immunocomplex. According to the method of this aspect of the present invention, detection of immunocomplex formation is indicative of a diagnosis of the tamoxifen-induced uterine toxicity. Various methods can be used to detect the formation of the PEDF and/or the VEGF immunocomplex of the present invention and those of skills in the art are capable of determining which method is suitable for each immunocomplex and/or the type of cells used for diagnosis. The antibody used in the immunocomplex of the present invention can be labeled using methods known in the art. It will be appreciated that the labeled antibodies can be either primary antibodies (i.e., which bind to the specific antigen, e.g., a PEFD-specific antigen or a VEGF-specific antigen) or secondary antibodies (e.g., labeled goat anti rabbit antibodies, labeled mouse anti human antibody) which bind to the primary antibodies. The antibody can be directly conjugated to a label or can be conjugated to an enzyme. Detection of the PEDF and/or VEGF immunocomplex in a biological sample can be performed using method well known in the art and include, but not limited to, fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS), enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), Western blot and radio-immunoassay (RIA) analyses, immunoprecipitation (IP), immunohistochemistry, or by a molecular weight-based approach. Alternatively or additionally, the level of PEDF and/or VEGF can be determined at the nucleic acid level using mRNA detection methods. RNA or cDNA detection methods can be performed using an isolated polynucleotide (e.g., a polynucleotide probe, an oligonucleotide probe/primer) capable of hybridizing to a PEDF or VEGF nucleic acid sequence such as the PEDF transcript set forth by SEQ ID NO: 1, the VEGF transcript set forth by SEQ ID NO: 28 (NM_001025366) or a portion thereof in the biological sample. Such a polynucleotide can be at any size, such as a short polynucleotide (e.g., of 15-200 bases), an intermediate polynucleotide of 100-2000 bases and a long polynucleotide of more than 2000 bases. Determining the level of PEDF and/or VEGF in either the amino acid or the nucleic acid level is effected in a biological sample taken from a subject which is diagnosed with cancer and may be treated with uterine-inducing toxicity agents. The isolated polynucleotide probe used by the present invention can be any directly or indirectly labeled RNA molecule [e.g., RNA oligonucleotide (e.g., of 17-50 bases), an in vitro transcribed RNA molecule], DNA molecule (e.g., oligonucleotide, e.g., 15-50 bases, cDNA molecule, genomic molecule) and/or an analogue thereof [e.g., peptide nucleic acid (PNA)] which is specific to the PEDF or VEGF RNA transcript of the present invention. Oligonucleotides designed according to the teachings of the present invention can be generated according to any oligonucleotide synthesis method known in the art such as enzymatic synthesis or solid phase synthesis. The isolated polynucleotide used by the present invention can be labeled either directly or indirectly using a tag or label molecule. The above-described polynucleotides can be employed in a variety of RNA and cDNA detection methods such as Northern blot analysis, reverse-transcribed PCR (RT- PCR) [e.g., a semi-quantitative RT-PCR, quantitative RT-PCR using e.g., the Light Cycler™ (Roche)], RNA in situ hybridization (RNA-ISH), in situ RT-PCR stain [e.g., as described in Nuovo GJ, et al. 1993, Intracellular localization of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified hepatitis C cDNA. Am J Surg Pathol. 17: 683-90, and Komminoth P, et al. 1994, Evaluation of methods for hepatitis C virus detection in archival liver biopsies. Comparison of histology, immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and in situ RT-PCR. Pathol Res Pract, 190: 1017-25] and oligonucleotide microarray analysis [e.g., using the Affymetrix microarray (Affymetrix®, Santa Clara, CA)]. As used herein the phrase "a decrease below a predetermined threshold" refers to a decrease in expression of PEDF which is higher than a predetermined threshold such as at least 5 %, at least 10 %, at least 20 %, at least 30 %, at least 40 %, at least 50 %, at least 60 %, at least 70 %, at least 80 %, at least 90 %, at least 95 %, or 100 %, relative to the expression of PEDF in a control sample taken from a healthy subject not treated with tamoxifen or from the same subject before treatment with tamoxifen. Such control level can be obtained from the scientific literature. As used herein the phrase "an increase above a predetermined threshold" refers to an increase in expression of VEGF which is higher than a predetermined threshold such as at least 5 %, at least 10 %, at least 20 %, at least 30 %, at least 40 %, at least 50 %, at least 60 %, at least 70 %, at least 80 %, at least 90 %, at least 95 %, at least 100 % or more, relative to the expression of VEGF in a control sample taken from a healthy subject not treated with tamoxifen or from the same subject before treatment with tamoxifen. Such control level can be obtained from the scientific literature. It will be appreciated that the presence of the tamoxifen-induced uterine toxicity can be further validated using additional assays e.g. ultrasound, endometrial biopsy and hysteroscopy. As used herein, according to this aspect of the present invention, the phrase "subject in need thereof" refers to a mammalian female subject (e.g., human being) who has been treated or is expected to be treated with tamoxifen. Veterinary uses are also contemplated. The subject may be at the reproductive age, under the reproductive age or above the reproductive age. According to specific embodiments the subject is at a reproductive age. According to other specific embodiments, the subject is at the pre-menopausal period. In human, the pre-menopausal period is before the age of 45-55 for most women. According to yet other specific embodiments, the subject is at the postmenopausal period. In human menopause is defined as the state of an absence of menstrual periods for 12 months and in most women the post-menopausal period start between the ages of 45 and 55. According to specific embodiments the subject is diagnosed with cancer. According to a specific embodiment, the cancer is breast cancer. The term "treating" refers to inhibiting or arresting the development of a pathology (disease, disorder, or condition) and/or causing the reduction, remission, or regression of a pathology. Those of skill in the art will understand that various methodologies and assays can be used to assess the development of a pathology, and similarly, various methodologies and assays may be used to assess the reduction, remission or regression of a pathology. As used herein, the term "preventing" refers to keeping a disease, disorder or condition from occurring in a subject who may be at risk for the disease, but has not yet been diagnosed as having the disease. According to specific embodiments, the method or use further comprising administering the agent (i.e., which induces gonadal toxicity) or the uterine inducing toxicity agent e.g., tamoxifen to the subject. According to specific embodiments PEDF is administered concomitant with the agent or the tamoxifen. According to other specific embodiments PEDF is administered following first, second or multiple administrations of the agent or the tamoxifen. According to another specific embodiments, PEDDF is administered prior administration of the agent or the tamoxifen. According to specific embodiments PEDF is administered after accumulation of oxidants in the gonads above a predetermined threshold. As used herein the phrase "accumulation above a predetermined threshold" refers to a fold increase which is higher than a predetermined threshold such as at least about 1.2, at least about, at least about 1.8, at least about twice, at least about three times, at least about four time, at least about five times, at least about six times, at least about seven times, at least about eight times, at least about nine times, at least about 20 times, at least about 50 times, at least about 100 times, at least about 200 times, at least about 350, at least about 500 times, at least about 1000 times, at least about 2000 times, at least about 3000 times relative to a suitable control e.g. the level before treatment with the agent, the level at the beginning of a culture. According to specific embodiments, PEDF can be used alone or in combination with other established or experimental therapeutic regimen to treat or prevent gonadal toxicity or ovarian toxicity, such as GnRH agonist protection. PEDF and the agent or the tamoxifen can be administered to the subject per se, or in a pharmaceutical composition where each or both are mixed with suitable carriers or excipients. As used herein a "pharmaceutical composition" refers to a preparation of the active ingredient described herein with other chemical components such as physiologically suitable carriers and excipients. The purpose of a pharmaceutical composition is to facilitate administration of a compound to an organism. Herein the term "active ingredient" refers to the PEDF, the agent and/or the tamoxifen accountable for the biological effect. The active ingredients may be co- formulated or in separate formulation. Hereinafter, the phrases "physiologically acceptable carrier" and "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" which may be interchangeably used refer to a carrier or a diluent that does not cause significant irritation to an organism and does not abrogate the biological activity and properties of the administered compound. An adjuvant is included under these phrases. Herein the term "excipient" refers to an inert substance added to a pharmaceutical composition to further facilitate administration of an active ingredient. Examples, without limitation, of excipients include calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, various sugars and types of starch, cellulose derivatives, gelatin, vegetable oils and polyethylene glycols. Techniques for formulation and administration of drugs may be found in "Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences," Mack Publishing Co., Easton, PA, latest edition, which is incorporated herein by reference. Suitable routes of administration may, for example, include oral, rectal, transmucosal, especially transnasal, intestinal or parenteral delivery, including intramuscular, subcutaneous and intramedullary injections as well as intrathecal, direct intraventricular, intracardiac, e.g., into the right or left ventricular cavity, into the common coronary artery, intravenous, intraperitoneal, intranasal, or intraocular injections. According to a specific embodiment, administering the PEDF is effected by subcutaneous injection. According to another specific embodiment, administering the PEDF is effected by intravenous injection. Alternately, one may administer the pharmaceutical composition in a local rather than systemic manner, for example, via injection of the pharmaceutical composition directly into a tissue region of a patient (e.g., gonads). Pharmaceutical compositions of some embodiments of the invention may be manufactured by processes well known in the art, e.g., by means of conventional mixing, dissolving, granulating, dragee-making, levigating, emulsifying, encapsulating, entrapping or lyophilizing processes. Pharmaceutical compositions for use in accordance with some embodiments of the invention thus may be formulated in conventional manner using one or more physiologically acceptable carriers comprising excipients and auxiliaries, which facilitate processing of the active ingredients into preparations which, can be used pharmaceutically. Proper formulation is dependent upon the route of administration chosen. For injection, the active ingredients of the pharmaceutical composition may be formulated in aqueous solutions, preferably in physiologically compatible buffers such as Hank's solution, Ringer's solution, or physiological salt buffer. For transmucosal administration, penetrants appropriate to the barrier to be permeated are used in the formulation. Such penetrants are generally known in the art. For oral administration, the pharmaceutical composition can be formulated readily by combining the active compounds with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers well known in the art. Such carriers enable the pharmaceutical composition to be formulated as tablets, pills, dragees, capsules, liquids, gels, syrups, slurries, suspensions, and the like, for oral ingestion by a patient. Pharmacological preparations for oral use can be made using a solid excipient, optionally grinding the resulting mixture, and processing the mixture of granules, after adding suitable auxiliaries if desired, to obtain tablets or dragee cores. Suitable excipients are, in particular, fillers such as sugars, including lactose, sucrose, mannitol, or sorbitol; cellulose preparations such as, for example, maize starch, wheat starch, rice starch, potato starch, gelatin, gum tragacanth, methyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl-cellulose, sodium carbomethylcellulose; and/or physiologically acceptable polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). If desired, disintegrating agents may be added, such as cross-linked polyvinyl pyrrolidone, agar, or alginic acid or a salt thereof such as sodium alginate. Dragee cores are provided with suitable coatings. For this purpose, concentrated sugar solutions may be used which may optionally contain gum arabic, talc, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, carbopol gel, polyethylene glycol, titanium dioxide, lacquer solutions and suitable organic solvents or solvent mixtures. Dyestuffs or pigments may be added to the tablets or dragee coatings for identification or to characterize different combinations of active compound doses. Pharmaceutical compositions which can be used orally include push-fit capsules made of gelatin as well as soft, sealed capsules made of gelatin and a plasticizer, such as glycerol or sorbitol. The push-fit capsules may contain the active ingredients in admixture with filler such as lactose, binders such as starches, lubricants such as talc or magnesium stearate and, optionally, stabilizers. In soft capsules, the active ingredients may be dissolved or suspended in suitable liquids, such as fatty oils, liquid paraffin, or liquid polyethylene glycols. In addition, stabilizers may be added. All formulations for oral administration should be in dosages suitable for the chosen route of administration. For buccal administration, the compositions may take the form of tablets or lozenges formulated in conventional manner. For administration by nasal inhalation, the active ingredients for use according to some embodiments of the invention are conveniently delivered in the form of an aerosol spray presentation from a pressurized pack or a nebulizer with the use of a suitable propellant, e.g., dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichloro- tetrafluoroethane or carbon dioxide. In the case of a pressurized aerosol, the dosage unit may be determined by providing a valve to deliver a metered amount. Capsules and cartridges of, e.g., gelatin for use in a dispenser may be formulated containing a powder mix of the compound and a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch. The pharmaceutical composition described herein may be formulated for parenteral administration, e.g., by bolus injection or continuous infusion. Formulations for injection may be presented in unit dosage form, e.g., in ampoules or in multidose containers with optionally, an added preservative. The compositions may be suspensions, solutions or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and may contain formulatory agents such as suspending, stabilizing and/or dispersing agents. Pharmaceutical compositions for parenteral administration include aqueous solutions of the active preparation in water-soluble form. Additionally, suspensions of the active ingredients may be prepared as appropriate oily or water based injection suspensions. Suitable lipophilic solvents or vehicles include fatty oils such as sesame oil, or synthetic fatty acids esters such as ethyl oleate, triglycerides or liposomes. Aqueous injection suspensions may contain substances, which increase the viscosity of the suspension, such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, sorbitol or dextran. Optionally, the suspension may also contain suitable stabilizers or agents which increase the solubility of the active ingredients to allow for the preparation of highly concentrated solutions. Alternatively, the active ingredient may be in powder form for constitution with a suitable vehicle, e.g., sterile, pyrogen-free water based solution, before use. The pharmaceutical composition of some embodiments of the invention may also be formulated in rectal compositions such as suppositories or retention enemas, using, e.g., conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter or other glycerides. Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for use in context of the present invention include compositions wherein the active ingredients are contained in an amount effective to achieve the intended purpose. As used herein, the phrase "therapeutically effective amount" refers to an amount of active ingredients (e.g., PEDF) effective to prevent, alleviate or ameliorate symptoms of a disorder (i.e., gonadal toxicity, ovarian toxicity or cancer) or prolong the survival of the subject being treated. Determination of a therapeutically effective amount is well within the capability of those skilled in the art, especially in light of the detailed disclosure provided herein. For any preparation used in the methods of the invention, the therapeutically effective amount or dose can be estimated initially from in vitro and cell culture assays. For example, a dose can be formulated in animal models to achieve a desired concentration or titer. Such information can be used to more accurately determine useful doses in humans. Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of the active ingredients described herein can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in vitro, in cell cultures or experimental animals (as described in the Examples section which follows). The data obtained from these in vitro and cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage for use in human. The dosage may vary depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. The exact formulation, route of administration and dosage can be chosen by the individual physician in view of the patient's condition. (See e.g., Fingl, et al., 1975, in "The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics", Ch. 1 p.l). Dosage amount and interval may be adjusted individually to provide levels of the active ingredient that are sufficient to induce or suppress the biological effect (minimal effective concentration, MEC). The MEC will vary for each preparation, but can be estimated from in vitro data. Dosages necessary to achieve the MEC will depend on individual characteristics and route of administration. Detection assays can be used to determine plasma concentrations. Depending on the severity and responsiveness of the condition to be treated, and the type of agent used dosing can be of a single or a plurality of administrations, with course of treatment lasting from several days to several weeks or until cure is effected or diminution of the disease state is achieved using range of dosages such as a minimum effective dose (MED), median effective dose, a sub-maximal dose, maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or optimum biologic dose (OBD). According to a specific embodiment, the agent or the tamoxifen is administered in a MTD. As used herein the term "maximum tolerated dose" or "MTD" refers to the highest dose of an agent that is effective but does not cause excessive toxicity intolerable to the subject. Generally, an MTD can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in vitro, in cell cultures or experimental animals. Generally, MTD is subject specific and is adjusted for the patient's body surface area; a measurement that correlates with blood volume. Ultimately, the MTD can be determined by those having the requisite skill and experience, such as a physician (e.g. oncologist). Exemplary doses of PEDF are provided infra: 0.02-0.4 mg / kg / day, 0.162-0.32 mg / kg / day, 0.01-0.2 mg / kg / day, 0.1-0.4 mg / kg / day, 0.2-0.4 mg / kg / day or 0.05-0.1 mg / kg / day. According to a specific embodiment, the PEDF is administered at a dosage range of 0.02-0.4 mg/kg/day. According to another specific embodiment, the PEDF is administered at a dosage range of 0.162-0.32 mg/kg/day. The amount of a composition to be administered will, of course, be dependent on the subject being treated, the severity of the affliction, the manner of administration, the judgment of the prescribing physician, etc. Compositions of the present invention may, if desired, be presented in a pack or dispenser device, such as an FDA approved kit, which may contain one or more unit dosage forms containing the active ingredient. The pack may, for example, comprise metal or plastic foil, such as a blister pack. The pack or dispenser device may be accompanied by instructions for administration. The pack or dispenser may also be accommodated by a notice associated with the container in a form prescribed by a governmental agency regulating the manufacture, use or sale of pharmaceuticals, which notice is reflective of approval by the agency of the form of the compositions or human or veterinary administration. Such notice, for example, may be of labeling approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for prescription drugs or of an approved product insert. Compositions comprising a preparation of the invention formulated in a compatible pharmaceutical carrier may also be prepared, placed in an appropriate container, and labeled for treatment of an indicated condition, as is further detailed above. According to an aspect of the present invention there is provided an article of manufacture packaging tamoxifen and PEDF for use in treating cancer. Also provided is an article of manufacture packaging the agent and PEDF identified for use in the treatment or prevention of gonadal toxicity induced by the agent. The agent or the tamoxifen and the PEDF can be packaged in separate containers of in c-formulation. The article may be accompanied by instructions for use. According to another aspect of the invention there is provided a method of improving oocyte quality, the method comprising ex-vivo contacting an oocyte in a cell culture comprising said oocyte with an effective amount of pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF), thereby improving oocyte quality ex-vivo. As used herein, the term "an oocyte" refers to an unfertilized oocyte, a fertilized oocyte (also referred to as one cell zygote) and an embryo at any stage of development, including the stages of cleavage until the blastocyst stage. As used herein, the singular form "an oocyte" includes a single oocyte and a plurality of oocytes for examples at least 2, at least 3, at least 4, at least 5, at least 10, at least 15, at least 20 oocytes or more. According to specific embodiments the oocyte is comprised in an ovary or an ovary fragment. According to specific embodiments the oocyte is isolated. According to a specific embodiment, contacting an oocyte with PEDF is effected in-vitro or ex-vivo. Thus, the PEDF is added such that PEDF is in direct contact with the oocyte. According to a specific embodiment, the PEDF is added at an anti-oxidative amount. As used herein, the term "anti-oxidative amount" refers to an amount leading to a decrease of at least 5 % in oxidative stress in comparison to a suitable control e.g. in the absence of PEDF. The decrease in oxidative stress may be in the cell culture in general and/or in the oocyte in particular. According to a specific embodiment, the decrease is in at least 10 %, 30 %, 40 % or even higher say, 50 %, 60 %, 70 %, 80 %, 90 % or more than 100 %. Decreased oxidative stress may be manifested in the form of e.g. an increase in anti-oxidants and/or a decrease in ROS, DNA damage, lipid peroxidation, oxidation of proteins, activation of pro-apoptotic proteins and/or cell death; as further detailed hereinabove. According to another aspect of the present invention there is provided a cell culture comprising an oocyte and an exogenously added PEDF. As used herein, the term "cell culture" refers to a cell population comprising an oocyte that is grown under controlled conditions outside of its natural environment (i.e. in-vitro or ex-vivo). Typically, the cell population is grown with appropriate defined culture medium containing nutrients that nourish the oocyte which support its survival and optimally fertilization. According to specific embodiments, the cell culture is a mammalian cell culture (e.g. human). According to specific embodiments the oocyte is maintained under conditions for in-vitro fertilization (IVF). rVF techniques are known to anyone skilled in the arts. Typically, the female is first treated with fertility drugs to stimulate maturation of multiple oocytes. Drug type and dosage vary depending on the patient profile and the stimulation protocol used. These oocytes are then surgically recovered by microsurgical techniques (e.g. transvaginal oocyte retrieval) directly from the ovary. The recovered oocytes are then placed into a suitable culture dish and exposed to sperm collected from the male for fertilization. The day of oocyte collection and insemination is day 0. In many cases an additional procedure known as intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) is required to increase the chances of fertilization. After fertilization occurs, the fertilized oocyte is allowed to grow to a multicelled embryo for approximately 3-5 days. During this time culture conditions and embryos are evaluated continuously. Following, the embryos are recovered and returned to the female, where implantation of the embryo on the wall of the uterus is expected to occur, resulting, from that time forward, in a normal pregnancy. For additional details on methods involved in IVF procedures see Kuldeep Jain and Pankaj Talwar (IVF techniques for the beginner, JP Medical Ltd 2013). As used herein, the phrase "maintained under conditions for IVF" refers to conditions which allow fertilization of an oocyte by a sperm, division of a fertilized oocyte and/or development of an embryo until a certain stage of maturity outside the body. According to specific embodiments, the oocyte is maintained under conditions which allow development of a zygote, a cleavaging stage embryo, or a blastocyst. According to specific embodiments, the contacting is effected before fertilization of the oocyte. According to specific embodiments the contacting is effected following fertilization of the oocyte. According to other specific embodiments, the contacting is effected concomitant with fertilization of the oocyte. According to specific embodiments, the contacting is effected following accumulation of oxidants in the culture above a predetermined threshold. According to specific embodiments, the contacting is effected prior to freezing or during thawing or following thawing of the oocyte. According to another aspect of the present invention there is provided an IVF grade medium for use in IVF comprising PEDF. Also provided is a kit comprising: (i) An IVF grade medium for use in IVF; and (ii) PEDF.

Animals - DXR damage was evaluated in 7 weeks ICR female mice following treatment for superovulation with pregnant mares' serum (PMSG, 7 IU) SC on day 0 and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG, 7IU) SC on day 2. On day 1, mice were administered with DXR (6 mg/kg) or saline (control) rV. Mice ovaries were retrieved on day 3 (Figure 1A). The ability of rPEDF to overcome the destructive effect of DXR 7 weeks ICR female mice were treated with DXR (6 mg / kg) or saline (control) IV on day 0, rPEDF (2 mg/kg) or TRIS (control) was administered SC on day 1, followed by induction for superovulation with PMSG (7 IU) SC on day 4 and hCG (7 IU) SC on day 6. Mice ovaries were retrieved on day 7 (Figure 2A). The sub-acute effect of tamoxifen on post-menopausal uterine tissue was evaluated in ovariectomized (OVX) ICR mice treated daily for 7 days with various concentrations of tamoxifen (0.3 - 3.3 μg / kg). Mice uteri were excised at day 7. To evaluate the effect of rPEDF administration in the sub-acute model, OVX mice were treated daily for 7 days with tamoxifen (2.5 μg / mouse) and rPEDF (10 mg / kg) SC. Mice treated with tamoxifen alone served as control. The prolonged effect of tamoxifen on post-menopausal uterine tissue was evaluated in OVX ICR mice treated with tamoxifen (2.5 μg / mouse) 5 days per week for one month. To evaluate the effect of rPEDF administration in the prolonged model, mice were further treated with rPEDF (2 mg / kg) SC once every 3 days for one month starting on day 8 of tamoxifen treatment. Mice treated with tamoxifen alone served as control. Evaluation of the number of ovulated oocytes - cumulus-enclosed oocytes were isolated from the oviductal ampullae into M2 medium (Sigma), 16-18hrs after hCG administration. Cumulus cells were removed by a brief exposure to 400 IU / ml hyaluronidase (Sigma) and the number of ovulated oocytes was counted under binocular. Cell culture - Rat granulosa cell line LH-15 [Suh et al. J Cell Biol (1992) 119: 439-450] was cultured in hormone-free DMEM-F12 medium, supplemented with penicillin (100 IU / ml; Biological Industries), streptomycin (100 mg / ml; Biological Industries) and 10 % charcoal- stripped fetal bovine serum (CS-FBS; Invitrogen) (culture medium), as described previously (Breckwoldt et al. 1996, Sasson & Amsterdam 2002). Cells were serum-starved for 16 hours (0.1 % CS-FBS) prior to and during recombinant PEDF (rPEDF) stimulation or incubated in 2 % CS-FBS during Η202 stimulation. Western blot analysis -Samples were homogenized in cold lysis buffer (20mM HEPES, 150mM NaCl and 0.2% Igepal; sigma) and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm, for 15 min, at 4°C). Proteins were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE; 10 %; Bio-Rad, Israel). Separated proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Whatman GmbH, Germany) in a mini tank transfer unit (TE 22, Amersham, UK). Approximate molecular masses were determined by comparison with the migration of pre-stained protein standards (Bio-Rad). Blots were blocked for 1 hour in TBST (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH = 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.05 % Tween 20) containing 5 % skim-milk (Alba, NY, USA) followed by an over-night incubation at 4 °C with primary antibodies. Blots were washed three times in TBST and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Immunoreactive bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; Thermo Scientific, IL, USA) according to manufacturer's guidelines. Intensity of the protein bands was quantified by Image J sportswear (NIH). Immunohistochemistry - Paraffin-embedded sections were deparaffinized, microwave heated while being subjected to an antigen retrieval agent (H-3300, Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA, USA), cooled on ice to room temperature, rinsed in PBS, incubated for 1 hour with PBSTg (0.2 % Tween and gelatin in PBS), washed with PBS, blocked for 10 minutes in blocking solution (Cell Marque Corporation, CA, USA) and incubated overnight with anti PNPLA2 or anti-CD34 primary antibodies. On the following day, sections were washed in PBSTg and PBS before and after applying the appropriate secondary antibodies (goat anti-rat Alexa Flour555-conjugated, Goat anti rabbit Alexa Flour 488-conjugated antibodies (Cell signaling technology) together with a nuclear marker (Hoechst 3342, sigma), rinsed, mounted with Mowiol (Sigma), visualized and photographed by a Leica laser confocal microscope (SP5 Wetzalr, Germany) that was calibrated to a secondary antibody-only control. PEDF production - Human recombinant PEDF (NM_002615.4, SEQ ID NO: 1) was expressed in E. coli BL21. Bacteria were allowed to grow at 300C to OD600 nm of 0.5 - 0.6, induced for 4 - 5 hours by 0.5 mmol / L isopropyl-L-thio-P-D- galactopyranoside, centrifuged and their pellets were lysed. Recombinant proteins were purified by ion metal affinity chromatography with Ni-NTA His-Bind resin (Merck KgaA, Darmstadt, Germany) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Eluted fractions were resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by GelCode (Blue Stain Reagent, Thermo scientific) or western blotted with a specific anti PEDF antibody. Eluates with > 90 % purity were dialyzed against TRIS buffer pH = 10 [Konson et al. Cancer Res (2010) 70 6247-6257]. RNA isolation, reverse transcription (RT), PCR and real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) - Total RNA was isolated from various tissues (ovaries, eyes) or from granulosa cells, using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's instructions, and quantified with the Nano-Drop spectrophotometer (ND-1000; Thermo Scientific). First-strand cDNA was produced by RT (Maxima TM Reverse transcriptase, Thermo Scientific) from a total of 1 μg RNA, using oligo-dt primers (Thermo Scientific). DNA was amplified using 1 μΐ RT reaction and 50 pmol gene-specific primers in ReadyMix™ mixture (Sigma). Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) products were separated by 1.5 % agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Changes in the level of expression of mRNA were detected by SYBR green reagent (SYBR® Green PCR Master Mix, ABI, Carlsbad, CA, USA) along with 15 ng cDNA and specific primers, on a StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Table 1: PCR primers Table 2: RT-PCR primers MTT cell proliferation assay - Equal amount of LH-15 cells were seeded onto 6-well plates to a final volume of 500μ1. Following treatments, each well was incubated for 30 minutes with 10 μΐ of MTT [3-(4, 5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5- diphenyltetrazolium bromide; 5 mg / ml] followed by an additional 2 - 4 hours incubation period at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by addition of 110 μΐ HC1 (0.07 M in isopropanol) and OD 560 nm was measured by the SpectraMax 190 microplate reader (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA). Evaluation of uterine weight -At the end of each experiment, uteri were isolated, excised and weighed. Statistical Analysis - Differences in the intensity of the protein bands were assessed using the t test, with a significance of P < 0.05. Each experiment was repeated at least three times, and the intensity was expressed as percentage of intensity of the control, which was arbitrarily set as 100 %. EXAMPLE 1 THE EFFECTS OF DXR AND EXOGENOUS PEDF ON MICE OVARIES DXR reduces PEDF mRNA level in mice ovaries To evaluate the damage inflicted by DXR on mice ovaries PEDF mRNA level was evaluated in mice ovaries retrieved from mice treated for superovulation with standard PMSG/hCG protocol [Ben-Aharon et al. Reproductive biology and endocrinology : RB&E (2010) 8: 20], followed by treatment with DXR (Figure 1A). As demonstrated in Figure IB, DXR significantly (P < 0.05) reduced PEDF mRNA level. Exogenous PEDF improves ovulation under DXR conditions Based on the negative effect of DXR on the level of PEDF mRNA, the ability of exogenous recombinant PEDF (rPEDF) to overcome the destructive effect of DXR on ovulation was explored. To this end, female mice were treated with DXR followed by administration of rPEDF the day after. On the fourth day of the experiment mice were induced for superovulation with the standard PMSG/hCG protocol [Ben-Aharon et al. Reproductive biology and endocrinology : RB&E (2010) 8: 20]. Mice were sacrificed 16-17 hours after hCG administration (Figure 2A). As demonstrated in Figure 2B, rPEDF significantly (P < 0.05) decreased DXR-induced reduction in number of ovulated oocytes. EXAMPLE 2 THE EFFECTS OF OXIDATIVE STRESS AND EXOGENOUS PEDF ON LH-15 RAT GRANULOSA CELLS H202 affects the viability of LH-15 cells and the mRNA levels of PEDF in these cells To evaluate the damage inflicted by oxidative stress (OS) on granulosa cells a MTT assay was employed and cells viability was followed. Exposure of rat granulosa cell line (referred to as "LH-15 cells") to increasing doses of Η202 (100 - 500 μΜ) for 24 hours caused a statistically significant (P < 0.05), dose dependent, decrease in cells viability (Figure 3A). Furthermore, H202 significantly (P < 0.01) reduced PEDF mRNA level, already at a concentration of 100 μΜ (Figure 3B). Exogenous PEDF attenuates H202-induced cytotoxicity in LH-15 cell Based on the negative effect of H2O2 on the viability of LH-15 cells and the level of PEDF mRNA, the ability of exogenous recombinant PEDF (rPEDF) to overcome the destructive effect of H2O2 in granulosa cells was explored. To this end, LH-15 cells were incubated with 100 or 200 μΜ H2O2 for 24 hours in the presence or absence of rPEDF (1 nM or 5 nM) and cells viability was evaluated by the MTT assay. As demonstrated in Figure 4A, rPEDF significantly (P < 0.05) decreased H202-induced reduction in cells viability. In addition, the expression of the pro-apoptotic protein, BAX and the mRNA levels of the anti-oxidants enzymes SOD-1 and GPX-1 in LH-15 cells under the same stimulatory conditions were followed. The results indicated that while BAX level was elevated following H2O2 treatment, exogenous addition of rPEDF decreased its expression (Figures 4B-C; P < 0.05). In contrast, SOD-1 and GPX-1 mRNA levels were decreased following H2O2 treatment; exogenous addition of rPEDF elevated their expression (Figures 5A-B). EXAMPLE 3 PEDF RECEPTOR, PNPLA2, IS EXPRESSED IN MOUSE OVARIES AND RAT GRANULOSA CELLS The PEDF receptor, PNPLA2, is expressed in mouse ovaries The pro-survival PEDF-R, Patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein 2 (PNPLA2), expression in mice ovaries was evaluated at the protein and mRNA levels. Immunostaining of mice ovaries revealed that the pro-survival PEDF-R, PNPLA2 is expressed in granulosa cells, theca cells and oocytes (Figure 6A). Furthermore, mouse ovaries express PEDF-R mRNA (Figure 6B) and protein (Figure 6C). PEDF receptor, PNPLA2, is expressed in LH-15 cells The observed effect of rPEDF on LH-15 cells suggests that granulosa cells express PEDF receptor/s (PEDF-R). As demonstrated in Figures 3B-C, granulosa cells express the pro-survival PEDF-R, PNPLA2, mRNA (Figure 6B) and protein (Figure 6C). Exogenous PEDF activated AKT in granulosa cells Having shown that granulosa cells express PNPLA2 that mediates PEDF pro- survival functions, the ability of rPEDF to activate AKT, a known factor in the pro- survival signaling pathway (Li et al. Stem Cells 2013), was examined. To this end, serum-starved LH-15 cells were stimulated with 1 nM rPEDF for various durations. The results indicated that stimulation with rPEDF induced prolonged, time-dependent phosphorylation of AKT starting at 5 minutes (Figures 7A-B; P < 0.05). Thus, without being bound by theory, heading towards possible mechanism, rodents granulosa cells, theca cells and oocytes express the pro-survival PEDF receptor, PNPLA2; and once stimulated by rPEDF, granulosa cells exhibit phosphorylation of AKT, a central pro-survival mediator of cell signaling. EXAMPLE 4 THE EFFECTS OF TAMOXIFEN AND EXOGENOUS PEDF ON MICE UTERINE TISSUE Sub-acute tamoxifen treatment affects uterine weight and VEGF and PEDF expression To evaluate the effect of sub-acute administration of tamoxifen on postmenopausal uterine tissue, ovariectomized (OVX) mice were treated daily for 7 days with various concentrations of tamoxifen. As demonstrated in Figure 8, a dose dependent increase of uterine weight was observed following sub-acute tamoxifen administration. In addition, the level of uterine VEGF protein was up-regulated in a dose dependent manner (Figure 9A-B), positively correlating with uterine weight. On the other hand, the expression of PEDF protein was down-regulated (Figures 9 A and 9C) as tamoxifen doses were increased. This reciprocal change in the VEGF and PEDF protein levels in uteri following sub-acute tamoxifen administration resulted in a dramatic significant dose dependent increase in the ration of VEGF/PEDF protein levels (Figure 9D). As PEDF a secreted glycoprotein with autocrine and paracrine activities, the effect of tamoxifen on expression levels of receptors essential for PEDF activity was evaluated. PEDF was shown to function either as a pro-survival factor through the PNAPLA2 receptor, or as an anti-angiogenic factor through Laminin receptor. As shown in Figure 10, sub-acute tamoxifen treatment up-regulated the mRNA levels of both PNPLA2 and Laminin receptors. However, the increase in PNPLA2 receptor was more pronounced than the increase in Laminin receptor. This suggests that following tamoxifen treatment, endogenous PEDF is more likely to bind PNPLA2 and induce cell survival than to promote anti-angiogenic activity through the Laminin receptor. Exogenous PEDF attenuates tamoxifen-induced hyperplasia and VEGF elevation The ability of exogenous recombinant PEDF (rPEDF) to overcome the destructive effect of tamoxifen on uterine weight and VEGF expression was explored. Based on established regimen of rPEDF treatment in mice [Chuderland, D. et al. The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism 98, E258-66 (2013); and Chuderland, D. et al. Human reproduction (Oxford, England) 0, 1-9 (2013)], rPEDF was administered at a dose of 10 mg / kg to the ovariectomized mice treated for 7 days with daily doses of tamoxifen. As demonstrated in Figures 11 and 12A-B, a significant decrease in uterine weight and uterine VEGF protein levels were observed in mice treated with tamoxifen + rPEDF as compared to tamoxifen alone, suggesting that rPEDF abrogated tamoxifen-induced uterine adverse effects, possibly by resisting tamoxifen-induced VEGF elevation. The effect of rPEDF on signaling pathways Analyzing the effect of administration of rPEDF on the levels of AKT and JNK phosphorylation in the sub-acute tamoxifen model revealed a significant decrease in phosphorylation of AKT (Figures 13A-B) and increase in phosphorylation of JNK (Figure 14A-B) in mice treated with tamoxifen + rPEDF when compared to mice treated with tamoxifen alone. Thus, treatment with rPEDF may reduce activation of cancer- associated signaling pathways. Prolonged tamoxifen treatment affects uterine weight and VEGF and PEDF expression Cancer patients are treated daily with tamoxifen for a long period (up to 10 years). Therefore, to evaluate the effects of prolonged tamoxifen administration, mice were administered with tamoxifen (2.5 μg / mouse) 5 days per week for one month. As demonstrated in Figures 15 and 16A-C, prolonged tamoxifen treatment induced similar effects as the sub-acute treatment, i.e. increase in uterine weight (Figure 15), up- regulation of VEGF protein level (Figure 16 A) and down-regulation of PEDF protein level (Figure 16B). As a consequence, the VEGF/PEDF ratio was significantly increased (Figure 16C), complementary with the sub-acute treatment model. Furthermore, evaluation of PEDF's receptors expression after one month of tamoxifen treatment showed that the level of PNPLA2 was significantly increased, whereas that of Laminin receptor did not change significantly (Figure 17); indicating that the dominance of the survival pathway is even more pronounces following long term tamoxifen treatment. Prolonged exogenous PEDF attenuates tamoxifen-induced hyperplasia, VEGF elevation and blood vessel density The ability of exogenous recombinant PEDF (rPEDF) to overcome the destructive effect of prolonged tamoxifen treatment on uterine weight and VEGF expression was explored. Preliminary analysis indicated that treatment with rPEDF was more effective when administered following a short period of initiation with tamoxifen (data not shown); therefore rPEDF was administered to mice starting on day 8 of tamoxifen treatment. As shown in Figure 18 uterine weights were down-regulated in mice treated with tamoxifen + rPEDF, though not statistically significant (p=0.2). The level of expression of uterine VEGF protein was significantly decreased in mice treated with tamoxifen + rPEDF when compared to mice treated with tamoxifen alone (Figures 19A-B), suggesting a durable effect of rPEDF on the uterus after one month of treatment. In addition, immunohistochemical staining using CD34 as a marker for endothelial cells was utilized to evaluate vascular changes following treatment with tamoxifen and tamoxifen + rPEDF. As clearly shown in Figure 20, treatment with tamoxifen alone induced a remarkable increase in the density of uterine blood vessels as compared to control and prolonged treatment with tamoxifen + rPEDF showed a decrease in CD34 staining as compared to tamoxifen alone. Modulation of ERa pattern of expression The expression level of hormone receptors is a key aspect in tamoxifen treatment for breast cancer. Estrogen receptor (ER) mediated-signaling pathways are of particular interest as tamoxifen can exert its activity through binding to ER and therefore, changes in ER expression level may alter the tissue's response to tamoxifen. Hence, in the next step the levels of the hormonal receptors ERa, ERP and progesterone receptor (PR) were determined in the sub-acute and prolonged in vivo tamoxifen treatments models. As shown in Figure 21 A, sub-acute tamoxifen treatment up- regulated the level of ERa mRNA, however had no significant effect on ERP and PR. As also evident from Figure 21 A, rPEDF administration was able to attenuate the subacute tamoxif en-induced reduction in ERa mRNA levels. Furthermore, the protein level of ERa showed a similar trend, though not statistically significant (Figure 2 IB, p=0.1). Prolonged tamoxifen treatment, as shown in Figure 22A, up-regulated the mRNA expression of both ERa and ERp, however had no significant effect on PR expression. As also evident in Figure 22A, rPEDF administration was able to reverse the prolonged tamoxif en-induced reduction in ERa mRNA levels. The level of ERa protein expression was in correlation with its mRNA level, verifying the ability of rPEDF to down-regulate the expression of ERa protein (Figure 22B). Taken together, rPEDF treatment caused a specific decrease in ERa uterine expression, without modifying the expression of ERP and PR. The decrease in ERa expression has dual relevance to tamoxifen-treated uteri; meaning that ER-related signaling, known to mediate hyperplastic responses, is diminished, and that tamoxifen molecule has less receptors to bind to in any given cell; thus reducing uterine response to tamoxifen.
