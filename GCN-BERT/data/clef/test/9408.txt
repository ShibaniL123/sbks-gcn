WO 2011/156573 CA 02802075 2012-12-07 PCT/US2011/039760 LOW-PROFILE, UNIPLANAR BONE SCREW CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED PATENT APPLICATIONS [0001] This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/353,586, filed June 10, 2010, and U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/394,274, filed October 18, 2010, both incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. BACKGROUND Field of Embodiments [0002] The present embodiments relate generally to orthopedic devices. More specifically, the present embodiments relate to screws for orthopedic devices that are typically placed within or adjacent to vertebrae (e.g., pedicles). It should be noted, however, that the screws disclosed herein may also be used in other orthopedic applications. For example, the screws may be used for repositioning fractured bones relative to one another, or used in an external fixator for trauma patients. Description of Related Art [0003] During spinal fusion surgery, bone screws may be fixed to adjacent vertebrae and interconnected with rods that span the screws to stabilize the spine during the healing process. The screw heads typically include a slot that is intended to receive a rod. The rod may be at least partially secured within the slot by a cap or set screw. The rods interconnecting the bone screws may span one or more vertebral levels (e.g., one to two vertebral levels for a spinal fusion of a degenerative condition, eight to twelve vertebral levels for scoliosis, etc.). [0004] During an orthopedic surgical procedure, a number of factors can impact bone screw placement and alignment. These factors include, but are not limited to, spinal curvatures, variations in patient anatomy, and small imprecisions in screw placement by the surgeon. It is generally desirable for bone screws to be configured to be adjustable in order to achieve a desired alignment. However, with conventional bone screws, greater adjustability of the WO 2011/156573 CA 02802075 2012-12-07 PCT/US2011/039760 bone screw typically means the screw is relatively bulky (e.g., relative to its less adjustable counterparts). Bulky bone screws can cause pain and irritation to some patients. [0005] Bone screws can be classified as monoaxial, polyaxial or uniplanar based on their adjustability. [0006] Monoaxial bone screws are the most simplistic and not particularly useful for accommodating screw placement and alignment. The screw head of a monoaxial screw allows adjustment to the rod only in the direction perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the screw. When the rod is secured in the slot of the bone screw, the longitudinal axis of the rod is substantially perpendicular to (i.e., at a 90° angle to) to the longitudinal axis of the bone screw. [0007] Polyaxial screws are commonly used to overcome the variations in screw placement and alignment. The relationship between the screw axis and the rod axis can be variable but still be locked solidly in place (e.g., the screw head of a polyaxial screw may be configured to swivel approximately 20° off the screw axis). This adjustability allows rods to be connected to multiple screws that may be placed medial or lateral to one another and to provide for lordotic and kyphotic spinal alignments. Conventional polyaxial screws are larger and bulkier than monoaxial screws (e.g., because of the structures that provide for the screw head of a polyaxial screw to swivel). [0008] Uniplanar screws have screw heads that may deviate from the screw axis but only in the plane of the slot for the rod; they typically do not adjust to medial or lateral rod positions (like polyaxial screws). This type of screw is more commonly used in scoliosis surgery where there may be a degree of cranial or caudal angulation (such as the sagittal plane of the spine), but there is little medial lateral screw placement deviation and the surgeon additionally needs rigid control of the screw to manipulate it in the coronal and axial plane of the spine. Similar to polyaxial screws, conventional uniplanar screws are large and bulky because of the configuration of their single plane swivel mechanism. WO 2011/156573 CA 02802075 2012-12-07 PCT/US2011/039760 [0009] Because many scoliosis patients are children or smaller-sized adults and because many scoliosis fusions are performed in the kyphotic thoracic spine with less soft tissue coverage, the larger, bulkier polyaxial and uniplanar screws are often prominent and may cause pain and irritation to the patient. In some cases, the pain and irritation may rise to the level where a second surgery to remove the screws and rods is necessary. [0010] A need exists for improved uniplanar bone screws, including bone screws that may address one or more of the above described disadvantages. SUMMARY [00111 One embodiment relates to a uniplanar bone screw for adjusting a position of a rod that comprises a main body, a rocker and a rod-securing element. The main body has a shaft with a threaded part. The rocker is coupled to and moveable relative to the main body. The rocker is configured to at least partially receive the rod. The rod-securing element is configured to secure the rod between the rocker and the rod-securing element and relative to the main body. The rod-securing element includes a fulcrum serving as an axis of rotation about which the rod rotates.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION [0099] Referring generally to the FIGURES, various embodiments of a bone screw that is a low-profile, uniplanar bone screw are shown. An effort has been made to use the same or like reference numbers throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like parts. The lowprofile, uniplanar bone screw may be a reduction screw. The low-profile, uniplanar bone screw preferably includes a rocker. The rocker may be a swing or a sliding rod support where both the swing and the sliding rod support can translate and rotate around a common axis. The rocker is configured to be movable relative to the main body of the bone screw and, thereby, to provide for a rod disposed thereon to be adjustable at least within a single plane. Stated otherwise, by using the rocker, the head of the bone screw need not be movable in order to provide for uniplanar adjustment of the rod relative to the main body of the bone screw. Because the head of the bone screw does not need to be movable, the screw can be configured to be smaller and less bulky than a conventional uniplanar bone screw, thereby decreasing the likelihood of pain and irritation to a patient. As a result, the bone screw is low-profile. Accordingly, the rocker allows for the screw to be less bulky than conventional polyaxial and uniplanar bone screws, while still providing uniplanar movement of the rod relative to the bone screw (e.g., cranial or caudal angulation of the rod axis relative to the screw axis). In general, at least two low-profile, uniplanar bone screws are secured to the patient while a single rod is coupled to each bone screw. [0100] Referring to FIGS. 1-9, a bone screw 10, 1000 having an elongated member shown as a rod 12, 1012 coupled thereto is shown. The bone screw 10, 1000 is a uniplanar bone screw that is configured to provide adjustability of a position of the rod 12, 1012 in a single plane, as will be discussed in more detail below. The bone screw 10, 1000 (e.g., a pedicle screw) includes a main body 14, 1014, a rocker 16, 1016 coupled to and moveable relative to WO 2011/156573 CA 02802075 2012-12-07 PCT/US2011/039760 the main 14, 1014 body and that is configured to at least partially receive the rod 12, 1012, and a rod-securing element 18, 1018 configured to secure the rod 12, 1012 between the rocker 16, 1016 and the rod-securing element 18, 1018 and relative to the main body 14, 1014. The rod-securing element 18, 1018 may be any suitable element, such as a set screw. The rod 12, 1012 is shown elongated along a longitudinal rod axis 72, 1072. The rocker 16, 1016 of FIGS. 1-9 is a sliding rod support. [0101] The main body 14, 1014 includes a shaft 22, 1022 and a screw head 24, 1024 coupled to the shaft 22, 1022. The main body 14, 1014 generally defines a longitudinal screw axis 26, 1026 of the bone screw 10, 1000. The main body 14, 1014 of the bone screw 10, 1000 is configured to be secured to a person's spine (e.g., at a pedicle) to help couple the rod 12, 1012 to the patient's spine. The shaft 22, 1022 includes a threaded portion having a plurality of threads (the threaded portion of the shaft is not shown in FIGS. 5-9). The threaded portion of the shaft 22, 1022 is located at or proximate to a first end 28 of the bone screw 10, 1000 generally opposite a second end 30, 1030. The threaded portion is intended to be at least partially received within a bore (hole, cavity, etc.) formed in the person's spine. The threads of the threaded portion are configured to threadably engage the bore to secure the main body 14, 104 to the spine. [0102] The screw head 24, 1024 is shown located at or proximate to the second end 30, 1030 of the bone screw 10, 1000. The head 24, 1024 is shown including a front side 32 (FIG. 6) generally opposite a rear side 34 (FIG. 6), a first side 36, 1036 generally opposite a second side 38 (FIG. 6), a top side 40 (FIG. 9) generally opposite a bottom side 42 (FIG. 7), and a slot 44, 1044. The slot 44, 1044 is configured to at least partially receive the rod 12, 1012. The slot 44, 1044 is shown extending a distance downward generally along the longitudinal screw axis 26, 1026 from the top side 40 of the head 24, 1024 toward the bottom side 42 of the head 24, 1024. The slot 44, 1044 is further shown extending through the head 24, 1024 from the front side 32 to the rear side 34 in a direction substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal screw axis 26, 1026. Typically, the rod 12, 1012 is positioned into the slot 44, 1044 by moving it from a position generally above the slot 44, 1044 downward. The extension of the slot 44, 1044 through the head 24, 1024 allows the rod 12, 1012 to extend WO 2011/156573 CA 02802075 2012-12-07 PCT/US2011/039760 therethrough (e.g., with the ends to either side). In this way, the rod 12, 1012 may be coupled to other bone screws. It should be noted that the slot 44, 1044 may have any size, shape or position suitable for at least partially receiving a rod. [0103] The slot 44, 1044 is further configured to at least partially receive the sliding rod support 16, 1016, 1026, 1036 and to allow for movement of the sliding rod support 16, 1016, 1026, 1036 relative to the main body 14, 1014 (FIG. 8). Preferably the slot 44, 1044 and sliding rod support 16, 1016, 1026, 1036 are configured to facilitate maintaining the sliding rod support 16, 1016, 1026, 1036 in the slot 44, 1044. The slot 44, 1044 is generally defined by a first interior sidewall 46 (FIG. 7), a second interior sidewall 48 (FIG. 7), and a bottom surface 50 1050 that extends therebetween (i.e. the bottom surface 50, 1050 extends from the first interior sidewall 46 to the second interior sidewall 48). The bottom surface 50 is shown including a fiat portion (FIGS. 1-5) or a generally curved portion, shown as a generally concave portion 52 (FIG. 8). The concave portion 52 is configured to facilitate movement of the sliding rod support 16, 1016, 1026, 1036 relative to the main body 14, 1014. The bottom surface 50, 1050 of the slot 44, 1044 supports the sliding rod support 16, 1016, 1026, 1036. [0104] FIGS. 1-5 and 8 illustrate how the sliding rod support facilitates rotation of the rod about the rod-securing element 18, 1018 where the sliding rod support is configured to translate and/or rotate within the slot 1044. A tip 1085 of the rod-securing element 18, 1018 may include a fulcrum 85, 1085 about which the rod 1012 may rotate and the sliding rod support 16, 1016, 1026, 1036 may include a taper 1095, acting as a fulcrum, which contacts a bottom surface 1099 of the rod 1012 or the bottom surface 1050 of the slot 1044. The sliding rod support 16, 1016 may include a first surface 1096 and a second surface 1097. The first surface 1096 of the sliding rod support 1016 may include the taper 1095. When the taper 1095 contacts the bottom surface 1099 (FIG. 3) of the rod 1012, the second surface 1097 of the rod 1012 may have a greater contact area with the bottom surface 1050 of the slot 1044 than when the taper 1095 contacts the bottom surface 1044 of the slot 1050. When the sliding rod support 16, 1016, 1026, 1036 rotates, the center of the sliding rod support 16, 1016, 1026, 1036 serves as an axis of rotation about which the sliding rod support 16, 1016, 1026, 1036 rotates. WO 2011/156573 CA 02802075 2012-12-07 PCT/US2011/039760 [0105] The distance of the center 1095 of the sliding rod support 1016, 1026, 1036 from the longitudinal axis 26, 1026 of the bone screw 1000 as the rod 1012 pivots about the fulcrum 1085 of the rod-securing element 1018 may determine the amount of rotation 0 of the rod 1012. For example, when the sliding rod support 1016, 1026, 1036 is aligned with the longitudinal axis 1026 of the bone screw 1000 (FIG. 2), the bone screw 1000 does not substantially rotate about the fulcrum 1085 of the rod-securing element 1018, i.e. the axis 1089 of the rod 1012 is substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal axis 1026 of the bone screw 1000. When the center portion of the sliding rod support 1016, 1026, 1036 has traversed a horizontal distance along the bottom surface 1050 of the slot 1044 and is no longer aligned with the longitudinal axis 1026 of the bone screw 1000 (FIGS. 3-5), the rod 1012 rotates about the fulcrum 1085 of the rod-securing element 1018 such that the axis 1089 of the rod 1012 is at an acute angle to the longitudinal axis 1026 of the bone screw 1000. [0106] The amount of rotation of the rod 1012 also depends on the height of the sliding rod support 1016, 1026, 1036 relative to the bottom surface 1050 of the slot 1044. The greater the height of the sliding rod support 1016, 1026, 1036 relative to the bottom surface 1050 of the slot 1044 the less the rod 1012 rotates. The angle of rotation 0 may range from substantially 0° to substantially 20° where the maximum angle of rotation 0 ranges from substantially 12° to substantially 20°. Preferably, the maximum angle of rotation 0 is substantially 15°. [0107] Referring to FIG. 6, which shows a more detailed view of the sliding rod support 1036 within the slot 1044 of FIG. 5, the interior sidewalls 46, 48 of the slot 44 include one or more guide features, shown as projections 54. The projections 54 are configured to be received within corresponding coupling features, i.e. guide channels, of the sliding rod support 16 in order to help guide or facilitate the movement of the sliding rod support relative to the main body 14, as will be discussed in more detail below. The projections 54 are shown generally opposite one another, extending inward from the first interior sidewall 46 and the second interior sidewall 48 of the screw head 24, respectively. WO 2011/156573 CA 02802075 2012-12-07 PCT/US2011/039760 [0108] Referring to FIGS. 6-9, the interior sidewalls 46, 48 defining the slot 44 further include a plurality of threads (not shown) at a portion proximate to the top side 40 of the head 24. The threads are configured to mate with the threads (not shown) of the rod-securing element 18 to secure the rod-securing element 18 to the main body 14. [0109] Referring to FIGS. 8 and 10-12, the sliding rod support 16 includes a body 56 having an upper portion 58 generally above a lower portion 60. The sliding rod support 16 is configured to be coupled and movable relative to the main body 14 to provide for adjustment of the cranial or caudal angulation of the longitudinal rod axis 20 relative to the longitudinal screw axis 26 of the bone screw [0110] Referring in particular to FIGS. 10-11, the upper portion 58 of the sliding rod support 16 includes a surface 62 that is configured to interface with and at least partially support the rod 12. The rod 12 may be disposed on the surface 62, which is shown shaped and sized to generally correspond to the shape and size of the rod. When disposed on the surface 62, the rod 12 is supported a distance above the bottom surface 50 of the slot 44. The rod 12 may also be slidably moved along the surface 62 (e.g., in a direction substantially corresponding to the direction of the longitudinal rod axis 20 to adjust the portion of the rod 12 received within the bone screw 10 before being secured the rod 12 in a desired position). [0111] Referring in particular to FIGS. 10 and 12, the lower portion 60 is configured to at least partially interface with the bottom surface 50 of the slot 44 to facilitate movement of the sliding rod support 16 relative to the main body 14. The lower portion 60 includes a curved portion shown as a convex surface 64. The convex surface 64 is shown shaped to generally correspond to the shape of the concave portion 52 of the bottom surface 50 of the slot 44. When the convex surface 64 of the sliding rod support 16 is disposed in contact with the concave portion 52 of the bottom surface 50, the sliding rod support 16 is able to rotate relative to the main body 14 with less resistance (e.g., from friction). Accordingly, the interaction of the surfaces facilitates rotational (e.g., pivotal)movement of the sliding rod support 16 relative to the main body 14. WO 2011/156573 CA 02802075 2012-12-07 PCT/US2011/039760 [0112] The concave portion 52 of the bottom surface 50 and the convex surface 64 of the sliding rod support 16 are both shown substantially elongated from front-to-back. This elongation facilitates translational movement of the sliding rod support 16 relative to the main body 14, allowing the sliding rod support 16 to function in a sied or cradle-like manner. This configuration also allows relatively large portions of the surface to remain in contact after an adjustment of the position of the sliding rod support 16 relative to the main body 14. This may be particularly beneficial once the rod 12 is secured relative to the bone screw because the friction between the concave portion 52 and the convex surface 64 can help maintain the rod 12 in a desired position relative to the bone screw [0113] Referring further to FIGS. 10 and 12, the guide features of the sliding rod support 16 are shown as guide channels 66. The guide channels 66 are configured to cooperate with the projections 54 to guide the movement of the sliding rod support 16 relative to the main body 14 in a desired path. The guide channels 66 (e.g., guide cavities, apertures, holes, etc.) shown are formed in a first side 68 and a second side 69 of the sliding rod support 16. The projections 54 are configured to be received in the guide channels 66. When the sliding rod support 16 is moved relative to the main body 14, the interaction of the projections 54 with the guide channels 66 of the sliding rod support 16 causes the sliding rod support 16 to move in a desired path. This path is in a plane 72 corresponding to or substantially parallel to the plane in which the rod 12 is adjustable. [0114] Alternatively, the sliding rod support 16 could include a groove instead of the open channel 66. The projections 54 could be a single pin extending into the open channel 66, or could be studs that extend from both interior side walls 46, 48 and sit in the grooves 66 on each side of the sliding rod support 16. The projections 54 could be friction fit pins or studs, screws, or a combination of both. [0115] Alternatively, other features or structures that help guide the movement of the sliding rod support relative to the main body may be used. These features and structures may be included or integrated with the head, may be included or integrated with the sliding rod support or both. It should also be noted that the interaction of the projections and the guide WO 2011/156573 CA 02802075 2012-12-07 PCT/US2011/039760 channels also helps retain the sliding rod support at least partially within the head of the bone screw. [0116] The projection may extend through the walls of the main body. Referring to FIGS. 16A-16D, a bone screw 1410 is shown including a screw head 1424 and a rocker 1416. The rocker is a sliding rod support. The bone screw 1410 is further shown including channels extending from the interior side walls 1446, 1448 of the screw head 1424 to a first exterior side wall 1495 and a second exterior sidewall 1496 of the screw head 1424 to help guide movement of the sliding rod support 1416. It may be easier to manufacture the channels when the channels 25 extend from the interior side walls 1446, 1448 to the first exterior side wall 1495 and the second exterior sidewall 1496 of the screw head 1424 then when the channels 25 do not extend to the first exterior side wall 1495 and the second exterior sidewall 1496 of the screw head. Bone screw 1410 is configured to function in substantially the same manner as bone screw [0117] The position of the guide features may be switched. Referring to FIGS. 13-15, a bone screw 410 is shown including a main body 414 and a rocker 416. The rocker 416 is a sliding rod support. The bone screw 410 is further shown including guide features, shown as projections 454, and guide channels 466. Rather than the main body including the projections and the sliding rod support including the guide channels as shown in FIGS. 1-4 and 10-12, the sliding rod support 416 is shown including the projections 454 and the main body 414 is shown including the guide channels 466. Generally, the slot includes the guide channels 466. Bone screw 410 is configured to function in substantially the same manner as bone screw [0118] Referring to FIGS. 16E-16H, the width of the guide channels 1466 of the sliding rod support 1416 may vary. As shown in FIGS. 16E-16G, the width of the guide channels 1466 may be narrower than the guide channels 66 of FIGS. 8, 10 and 12, thereby allowing the width of the screw head 1414 to be smaller than the width of the screw head 14 of FIGS. 6-9. Alternatively, as shown in FIG. 16H, the width of the guide channel 1576 may be wider than the guide channel of FIGS. 1-4. The width of the guide channel 1576 may range from WO 2011/156573 CA 02802075 2012-12-07 PCT/US2011/039760 substantially 3mm to substantially 12mm and is preferably substantially between 5-6mm. The wider the width of the guide channels relative to the width of the projection, the greater the maximum degree of rotation for the rod can be. Both bone screws 1410 and 1510 are configured to function in substantially the same manner as bone screw 10. The height of the guide channels may range from 0.5mm to 1.2mm. A concave surface of the slot (FIGS. 16E16G) allows for a larger height of the guide channels than a fiat surface of the slot (FIG. 16H). [0119] The fulcrum of the rod-securing element may be pointed or curved. As shown in FIGS. 16E-16H, the fulcrum 1495, 1595 of the rod-securing element 1418, 1518 may be pointed. As shown in FIGS. 17A17C, the fulcrum 1695 of the rod-securing element 1618 may be curved. In contrast to the pointed fulcrum, the curved fulcrum helps prevent the fulcrum 1695 of the rod-securing element 1618 from damaging the rod but allows for a smaller maximum degree of rotation of the rod. Bone screw 1610 is configured to function in substantially the same manner as bone screw [0120] Referring back to FIGS. 6-9, when the rod 12 is supported on the sliding rod support 16, the sliding rod support 16 guides the motion of the rod 12 as it is adjusted. As noted above, the motion of the sliding rod support 16 is in a plane corresponding to or substantially parallel to the plane in which the rod is adjustable. As the angle of the rod 12 is adjusted with the plane 72, the sliding rod support 16 guides the motion of the rod 12 and provides support for the rod 12 relative to the main body 14 of the bone screw 10. Adjusting the rod 12, changes the angle of the longitudinal rod axis 20 relative to the longitudinal screw axis 26 (see, e.g., FIG. 8). For the purposes of discussion, the neutral position of the rod 12 relative to the bone screw 10 is one wherein the longitudinal rod axis 20 is substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal screw axis 26. The rod 12 may be adjusted within the plane 72 to approximately +/- 16 degrees from the neutral position. The structure of the bone screw may be changed to provide for greater adjustability (e.g., approximately +/- 20 degrees) or to limit the adjustability of the rod (e.g., approximately +/- 7 degrees). The rods 1412, 1512, 1612 of FIGS. 16F-16H and 17C may also be adjusted within planes 1472, 1572 and 1672 a similar amount to that of rod 12. WO 2011/156573 CA 02802075 2012-12-07 PCT/US2011/039760 [0121] Referring further to FIGS. 4-9 and 16H, the motion of the sliding rod support 16, 1016, 1516 as it is moved in the path defined by the guide channels 66 includes a translational component of motion. Accordingly, the movement of the rod 12, 1012 as it is adjusted typically may includes localized rotation in addition to a translational component of motion of the sliding rod support 16, 1016, 1516. [0122] Referring further to FIGS. 6-9, rod-securing element 18 is configured to secure the rod 12 in the desired position relative to the bone screw [0123] The rod-securing element 18 includes threads that are configured to mate with the threads, as mentioned above. Positioning a portion of the rod-securing element 18 into the slot 44 and rotating the rod-securing element 18 about an axis substantially corresponding to the longitudinal screw axis 26, threadably engages the rod-securing element 18 with the head 24. [0124] The rod-securing element 18 further includes an upper portion 74 and a lower portion 76. Referring to FIG. 8, the upper portion 74 includes an engagement feature 78. The engagement feature 78 is configured to be engaged by a tool to facilitate rotation, and thereby, securing, of the rod-securing element 18 to the main body 14. Referring to FIGS. 6 and 3, the lower portion 76 is configured to contact the rod 12 and, thereby, to apply a force to the rod 12 that helps maintain the rod 12 in the desired position. This contact point to the rod defines the fulcrum about which the rod rotates in the plane of the screw-head slot. [0125] Further referring to FIG. 8, the lower portion 76 of the rod-securing element 18 is preferably configured to be generally pointed. A surface 80 defining the pointed lower portion 76 of the rod-securing element 18 is angled, providing for improved contact between the rod-securing element 18 and the rod 12 to help hold the rod 12 in position. It should be noted that the translational movement of the rod 12 provided by the sliding rod support 16, helps the rod 12 to be brought into improved contact with the surface 80 of the rod-securing element 18. Without this translational component of motion, the sliding rod support and the rod have the tendency to move toward the neutral position when used with rod-securing element 18. WO 2011/156573 CA 02802075 2012-12-07 PCT/US2011/039760 [0126] The position of the rocker and the pointed lower portion may be switched. Referring to FIGS. 18-21B, a bone screw 510 includes a main body 514, a rocker 516, 1516, a rod-securing element 580, a set screw 518 and a connector 586. Referring to FIG. 18, the main body 514 is shown including a slot 544 and threads 572. The slot 544 is shown including a bottom surface 550 that has a pointed portion 576, similar to the pointed, lower portion 76 of rod-securing element 18. A surface 580 defining the pointed portion 576 is angled, providing for improved contact with a rod when a rod is disposed within slot the 544 and coupled to the bone screw 510. The surface 580 is a rod-securing element. The pointed portion 576 of the rod-securing element 580 serves as a fulcrum and the fulcrum serves as an axis of rotation about which the rod rotates. The threads 572 are configured to receive the set screw 518. [0127] The rocker 516, 1516 is a sliding rod support. As shown in FIGS. 19 and 2 lA, the rocker 516 includes a sliding plate support 571 that allows for rotational movement of the rocker 516 where the rocker 516 rotates about the sliding plate support 571. The sliding rod support 516 may fit within a first or cylindrical portion 586. The first or cylindrical portion 586 is a connector. The surface of the first or cylindrical portion 586 is substantially smooth. A second portion 587 of the sliding rod support 516 is retained within a slot 589 of the connector 586 by a projection 590 that also serves as a pivot point. The projection 590 (e.g., pin) may be received in any suitable corresponding guide or retention feature (e.g., a groove or a channel). The ends 592 of the projection 590 may or may not be flush with the outer surface 591 of the slot 589. When the ends 592 of the projection 590 are not flush with the outer surface 591, the rocker 516 is able to translate with respect to the connector 586. A surface 562 of the sliding rod support 516 is shown facing generally downward, to contact and help guide a rod received in the bone screw 510 and the surface 562 of the sliding rod support 516. [0128] The sliding rod support may include a fiat or curved surface that abuts the connector. FIG. 19 illustrates a sliding rod support 516 that includes a fiat surface 595 that abuts the connector 586. FIG. 20B illustrates a sliding rod support 1516 with a curved WO 2011/156573 CA 02802075 2012-12-07 PCT/US2011/039760 surface 596 that would abut the connector 586. Like the sliding rod support 516, the sliding rod support 1516 also includes a projection 1590. [0129] As shown in FIG. 2lB, the set screw 518 is configured to receive the connector 586. The connector 586 may be received within a groove 588 of the set-screw 518. The interaction between the connector 586 and groove 588 provides for the surface 562 of the sliding rod support 516 to remain substantially parallel to a rod received in the slot 544 of the bone screw 510 when the rod-securing element 580 is coupled to or integrated with the main body 514. [0130] This "inverted embodiment" functions in substantially the same manner as bone screw 10, described above. The motion of the sliding rod support 516 may include a rotational component of motion and a translational component of motion. Accordingly, the movement of a rod that is coupled to the bone screw 510 as it is adjusted typically includes both a rotational and a translational component of motion. [0131] Referring to FIGS. 22-31, a bone screw 110 including a main body 114 and a rocker 116 is shown. [0132] Similar to main body 14, the main body 114 includes a shaft 122 and a head 124. The shaft 122 includes a threaded portion 127 including a plurality of threads 129. The head 124 includes a slot 144 having a first interior sidewall 146 generally opposite a second interior sidewall 148 and a bottom surface 150. The sidewalls 146, 148 are shaped to accommodate the rocker 116 and help retain the rocker 116 within the head 124, as will be discussed in more detail below. The bottom surface 150 includes a curved portion 152 in which the rocker may glide but also retains the rocker from displacing outside of the slot or recess for a dome 157 of the rocker 116. [0133] Referring in particular to FIGS. 25-29, the rocker 116 includes a body 156 having an upper portion 158 generally above a lower portion 160. Similar to the sliding rod support 16, the rocker 116 is configured to be coupled and movable relative to the main body 114 to WO 2011/156573 CA 02802075 2012-12-07 PCT/US2011/039760 provide for adjustment of the cranial or caudal angulation of a longitudinal rod axis 120 relative to the longitudinal screw axis 126. [0134] Similar to sliding rod support 16, the upper portion 158 of the rocker 116 includes a surface 162 that is configured to at least partially support the rod 12, and the lower portion 160 is configured to at least partially interface with the bottom surface 150 of the slot 144 to facilitate movement of the rocker 116 relative to the main body 114. Also similar to the sliding rod support 16, the lower portion 160 includes a curved portion. [0135] However, unlike the convex surface 64 of the sliding rod support 16, the curved portion is shown as a convex portion 164 that is substantially dome-shaped. The interaction between the concave portion 152 (e.g., recess, etc.) of the bottom surface 150 of the slot 144 and the convex portion 164 of the rocker 116 is configured to provide for substantially rotational movement of the rocker 116 relative to the main body 114. The concave portion 152 of the bottom surface 150 of the slot 144 and the convex portion 164 of the rocker 116 is in contact with concave portion 152 of the bottom surface 150. The dome-shaped convex surface 164 is substantially configured to raise a portion of the rocker 116 a distance above the bottom surface 150 of the slot 144 when in contact therewith. This distance facilitates rod rotation in addition to the rocker 116 gliding back-and-forth within the slot 144 substantially.. It should be noted that, the concave portion of the bottom surface may be larger (e.g., larger than shown in FIG. 16) and/or elongated to also provide for translation of the rocker relative to the main body. It should also be noted that the dome may be substantially any at least partially curved projection (e.g., semi-cylinder, etc.). [0136] Further, the rocker 116 does not rely on guide channels and projections to guide it and retain it within the head 124. Rather, the rocker 116 is retained in the head because the slot 144 is shaped to substantially confine the rocker 116. That is, the upper portion 158 of the rocker includes a substantially elliptical portion 182 and wings 184 (i.e. a first wing and a second wing) that are configured to confine the rocker 116 within the screw head 124 of the main body 114. While the wings 184 extend substantially from front-to-back or a first end to a second end of the substantially elliptic portion 182 within the slot 144, the size and shape of WO 2011/156573 CA 02802075 2012-12-07 PCT/US2011/039760 the elliptical portion 182 substantially prevents the rocker 116 from falling out of the head 124. [0137] Referring to FIGS. 32-34, a rocker 216 is shown. The rocker 216 is intended to function similar to rocker 116 in that it is configured to provide for rotational motion in addition to translation of the rocker 216 relative to a main body and is configured to be retained in a head of the main body of a bone screw because of the fit between a substantially elliptical portion 282 of an upper portion 258 and a slot of the head. In contrast to rocker 116, however, the curved portion of rocker 216, shown as convex portion 264, is substantially an elliptical dome rather than a substantially circular dome like convex portion 164. Other curved portions are contemplated. For example, the bottom surface of the bone screw may include a convex portion and the rocker may include a concave portion. [0138] Referring to FIGS. 35-37, a rocker 616 is shown. The rocker 616 is shown substantially similar to rocker 216 except that it includes a guide feature, shown as projections 654, rather than an elliptical portion to help retain it within a head of a bone screw The projections 654 are configured to be received within corresponding guide feature (e.g., guide channels) in a bone screw (e.g., similar to bone screw 410, discussed above). [0139] Referring to FIGS. 38-40, an outrigger 300 configured to be utilized with a bone screw is shown. The outrigger 300 is configured to provide for coupling of a rod 302 to a bone screw 304 such that the rod 302 is offset relative to the bone screw 304. The outrigger 300 is shown including a first member 306, a second member 308, and a rod coupling portion 310. The first member 306 and the second member 308 are shown integrally formed such that they are at an angle to one another (shown here as approximately 90 degrees). The rod coupling portion 310 is shown disposed at the end of the second member 308 distal to where the second member 308 and the first member 306 meet or coincide. It should be noted that the first member and the second member may be disposed at an angle relative to each other that is other than 90 degrees (e.g., 75 degrees). It should also be noted that, while the first member, the second member and the rod coupling portion are shown integrally formed, they need not be. For example, the first member and the second member may be integrally formed WO 2011/156573 CA 02802075 2012-12-07 PCT/US2011/039760 while the rod coupling portion is secured to an end of the second member (e.g., by screws, an adhesive, etc.). [0140] The first member 306 of the outrigger 300 is configured to be received in a slot 312 of the bone screw 304 and secured to a main body 314 of the bone screw 304 in a manner that is substantially similar to how rod 12 is coupled to the main body 14 of bone screw When the first member 306 of the outrigger 300 is received within the slot 312, the second member 308 extends a distance outward to a side of the bone screw 304. [0141] The rod-coupling portion 310 is shown as a clamp. The rod 302 may be positioned in a hook-shaped portion 316 of the clamp 310 and then secured thereto with a screw 318 before or after the first member 306 of the outrigger 300 is at least partially received in the slot 312. As mentioned above, the rod coupling portion 310 is shown disposed at the end of the second member 308 distal to where the second member 308 and the first member 306 meet or coincide. Thus, when the rod 302 is coupled to the outrigger 300 by the rod coupling portion 310, it is offset a distance from the longitudinal screw axis. Alternatively, the rodcoupling portion may be any combination of elements suitable for securing the rod relative to the first and second members. [0142] The bone screw 304 further includes a rocker 320. The rocker 320 is configured to provide for adjustment of the outrigger 300, and, thus, the rod 302, relative to the bone screw 304 in a plane corresponding to or parallel to the plane generally defined by the slot 312. The rocker may be configured in any suitable manner providing for at least rotational (e.g., pivotal, rocking, etc.) motion of the rod relative to the bone screw, as described in more detail above. [0143] Referring to FIG. 41, a low-profile bone screw 710 is shown. The bone screw 710 is shown substantially similar to bone screw 410 except that the bone screw 710 includes a projection 754 from which a rocker 716 is suspended. The rocker 716 is a swing or a swing sliding support. The projection (pin, protrusion, etc.) 754 extends out from an interior wall 746 of a head 724 of a main body 714 of the screw 710. One or more suspension lines 755 (two are shown) suspend the swing 716 in the slot 744 of the screw head 724. The WO 2011/156573 CA 02802075 2012-12-07 PCT/US2011/039760 suspension lines 755 may be rigid, allowing the swing 716 to pivot about projection 754. Thus, the projection 754 acts as a pivot point or hinge. The suspension lines 755 may be a thin rod or wire, or a triangular plate that is integral with the swing 716. The suspension lines 755 may include a hole (not shown) through which the projection 754 is coupled to the suspension line 755. The projection 754 can be a screw or other suitable fastener that extends from wall 746. Alternatively, an end portion of the suspension line 755 includes the projection 754 and the wall 746 includes a receiving hole for the projection 754. [0144] The swing 716 includes an upper surface 762 on which a rod would contact or interface and a bottom convex surface 764. The bottom convex surface contacts or interfaces with a fiat or curved bottom surface 750 of the slot 744. The swing 716 is configured to swing freely without a load or seat firmly against the base or bottom surface 750 of the slot 744 when under a load, such as from a rod. The tolerances at the projection 754 enable the swing 716 to swing freely without the load. In other words, the projection 754 may be smaller than the receiving hole that the projection 754 fits into so that the projection 754 and receiving hole have a loose fit. The rod rotates about the tip of the tapered fixation screw which coincides with the projection or hinge. [0145] As shown in FIGS. 42-44 and 49B-50C, a swing 1216 (FIG. 42) may include holes 1218 for receiving one or more guide features 1254 (e.g. a projection) (FIG. 43) that is configured to couple the swing 1216 to the screw head 1324 of the main body 1314 of the bone screw 1310. The holes 1218 also serve as an axis of rotation about which the swing 1216 rotates. The screw head 1324 includes holes 1325 for receding one or more projections 1354. The projections 1354 are configured to couple the swing 1216 to the bone screw 1310 such that the swing 1216 can rotate about a fulcrum 1385 of a rod securing element 1380 relative to the screw head 1324 of the bone screw 1310. For example, as shown in FIGS. 49A, 49C, 50A and 50C, the swing 1216 may rotate about the fulcrum 1385 from a first position (FIGS. 49A, 49C) where the longitudinal axis 1220 of the rod 1212 is substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal axis 1370 of the bone screw 1310 to a second position (FIGS. 50A, 50C) where the longitudinal axis 1220 of the rod 1212 is at an angle to the longitudinal axis 1370 of the bone screw 1310. When the swing 1216 is coupled to the bone WO 2011/156573 CA 02802075 2012-12-07 PCT/US2011/039760 screw 1310, a bottom surface 1217 of the rod 1312 abuts a surface 1215 of the swing 1216 and the swing 1216 abuts a bottom surface 1350 of the slot 1344. [0146] The screw head 1324 includes a bottom surface 1350. The bottom surface 1350 of the slot 1344 of the bone screw 1310 may be substantially curved in a first direction (FIG. 49C and 50C) and substantially curved in a second direction (FIG. 49D and 50D) where the second direction is substantially transverse to the first direction. The curved surfaces of the bottom surface 1350 allow a lower profile of the bone screw and a larger maximum degree of rotation of the swing 1216 than when the bottom surface is substantially fiat in any direction (FIG. 46C). Bone screw 1310 is configured to function substantially the same way as bone screw [0147] The bottom surface of the bone screw may not be curved. As shown in FIG. 45, the bottom surface 1250 of the bone screw 1210 may be substantially fiat in a first direction and substantially fiat in a second direction that is substantially transverse to the first direction. The substantially fiat bottom surface 1250 in the first and second direction leads to a decreased range of rotational motion of the swing 1216 relative to the fulcrum of the rodsecuring element as compared to the range of rotational motion when the bottom surface is substantially curved in a first and second direction. Bone screw 1210 is configured to function substantially the same way as bone screws [0148] The bottom surface of the bone screw may be curved in one direction and fiat in another direction. As shown in FIGS. 46A-48D, the bottom surface 1850, 1950 of the bone screw 1810, 1910 may be substantially curved in a first direction (FIGS. 46C, 47C, 48C) and substantially fiat in a second direction (FIGS. 46D, 47D, 48D) that is substantially transverse to the first direction. Bone screws 1810, 1910 are configured to function substantially the same way as bone screw [0149] The fulcrum of the bone screw may be spaced a distance from a top surface of the swing hole or may be in line with a top surface of the swing hole. As shown in FIG. 46C, a top surface 1823 of the swing hole 1818 may be spaced a distance from the fulcrum 1885 of the rod-securing element 1880 such that the rod 1812 can move in a direction parallel to the WO 2011/156573 CA 02802075 2012-12-07 PCT/US2011/039760 longitudinal axis of the fulcrum 1885. In contrast, as shown in FIG. 47C, a top surface 1923 of the swing hole 1918 may be in line with a top surface 1923 of the swing hole 1918 such that the rod 1912 can not move in a direction parallel to the longitudinal axis of the fulcrum. Alternatively, the diameter of the swing hole 1918 may be larger than the diameter of the projection that fits within the swing hole 1918 so that the swing can move in a direction parallel to the longitudinal axis of the fulcrum. When the diameter of the swing hole 1918 is substantially equal to the diameter of the projection that fits within the swing hole 1918, the swing cannot move in a direction parallel to the longitudinal axis of the fulcrum. Both the swing hole 1818 and swing hole 1918 serve as an axis of rotation about which the swing rotates. Alternatively, the projection that fits within the swing hole may serve as an axis of rotation about which the swing rotates. When the rod-securing element is secured, the swing may contact the bottom surface of the slot such that a load is distributed and/or the swing may translate (e.g. move in a direction parallel to the longitudinal axis of the fulcrum). [0150] Referring to FIG. 51, a low-profile bone screw 810 is shown. The bone screw 810 includes a main body 814, a head 824 and a slot 844. The bone screw 710 is shown substantially similar to bone screw 410 except that a bottom curved surface 850 of the slot 844 is asymmetric. In some cases, spinal curvatures (e.g., lordosis and kyphosis) have a larger curve than can be accommodated in other screws. The bottom surface 850 of the slot 844 is asymmetrical so as to offer greater angulations of the sliding rod support 816 in one direction. [0151] The sliding rod support 816 for bone screw 810 includes an upper surface 862 and a bottom curved surface 864. The upper surface 862 is arranged to contact or interface with a rod. The bottom curved surface 864 contacts or interfaces with the bottom surface 850 of the slot 844. The sliding rod support 816 includes a projection 854 that is configured to be received within a corresponding guide feature (e.g., guide channel) (not shown) in the bone screw 810. The sliding rod support 816 may also have a groove or channel (e.g., guide channel) (not shown) to accept a projection 854 from the interior wall of the screw head 844. WO 2011/156573 CA 02802075 2012-12-07 PCT/US2011/039760 [0152] Referring to FIGS. 52A-54C, a reduction screw 910 is shown. The reduction screw 910 may be used in spinal deformity patients in which the rod 912 may be positioned away from the patient. The reduction screw 910 may also be used to realign misaligned vertebrae such as spondylolisthesis. The reduction screw 910 includes a main body 914, a rocker 916 coupled to and movable relative to the main body 914 and that is configured to at least partially receive the rod 912 and a rod-securing element 18 configured to secure the rod 912 relative to the main body 914. The rocker 916 is a sliding rod support. The rod-securing element 918 may be any suitable element, such as a set screw. [0153] The main body 914 includes a shaft 922 and a screw head 924 coupled to the shaft 922. The screw head 924 includes a top portion 972, a bottom portion 973 and a slot 944. The top portion 972 is detachably coupled to the bottom portion 973. The shaft 922 includes a threaded portion having a plurality of threads (not shown). The threaded portion is configured to be at least partially received within a bore (hole, cavity, etc.) formed in a person's spine. The threads of the threaded portion are configured to threadably engage the bore to secure the main body 14 to the spine. [0154] The rod 912 may be placed into the slot 944 of the main body 914 and the rodsecuring element 918 may be reduced into the head 924 until the rod 912 is seated in the rocker 916. Once the rod 912 is seated in the rocker 916, the top portion 972 may be decoupled from the bottom portion 973 by any suitable mechanism. For example, the top portion 972 may be manually detached from the bottom portion 973. Alternatively, the top portion 972 may be detached from the bottom portion 973 by any suitable instrument. [0155] FIGS. 52A-52C illustrate the reduction screw 910 when the rod 912 is first placed within the slot 944. FIGS. 53A-53C illustrate the reduction screw 910 after the rod-securing element 918 is reduced into the head 924 such that the rod 912 is seated in the rocker 916. FIGS. 54A-54C illustrate the reduction screw 910 after the top portion 972 is decoupled from the bottom portion 973. Although FIGS. 52A-54C show that the top portion 972 of the head 924 is not decoupled until the rod 912 is seated in the rocker 916, the top portion 972 may be decoupled before the rod 912 is seated in the rocker 916. The reduction screw 1910 is WO 2011/156573 CA 02802075 2012-12-07 PCT/US2011/039760 configured to function substantially the same way as bone screw 10. Unlike non-reduction screws, the reduction screw 910 allows for more space within the screw head 924 for the misaligned vertebrae to traverse relative to the rod, thereby allowing the misaligned vertebrae to be realigned. For example, the reduction screw 910 may be at least partially screwed into a patient's vertebrae. Then the rod 912 may be placed into the slot 944 of the main body 914. A top surface of the rod 912 may abut the fulcrum of the rod-securing element 918 when the rod 912 is placed into the slot 944. Once placed in the slot 944, the rod-securing element 918 may be screwed into the slot 944. As the rod-securing element 918 is screwed into the slot, the rod 912 moves toward the rocker 916. As the rod 912 moves toward the rocker, the misaligned vertebrae moves toward the rod 912 so that the misaligned vertebrae can be realigned. [0156] In ail embodiments, the surface of the rocker can be textured to increase friction and thus prevent the rod from sliding in the direction of the rod axis. The surfaces of the rocker may be textured by etching or grit blasting. w w w [0157] As utilized herein, the terms "approximately," "about," "substantially," and similar terms are intended to have a broad meaning in harmony with the common and accepted usage by those of ordinary skill in the art to which the subject matter of this disclosure pertains.
