This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/973,929 filed Apr. 2, 2014, U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/989,951 filed May 7, 2014, and U.S. Provisional Application No. 62/016,459 filed Jun. 24, 2014, all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to interferon- and ribavirin-free treatment for hepatitis C virus (HCV). BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The HCV is an RNA virus belonging to the Hepacivirus genus in the Flaviviridae family. The enveloped HCV virion contains a positive stranded RNA genome encoding all known virus-specific proteins in a single, uninterrupted, open reading frame. The open reading frame comprises approximately 9500 nucleotides and encodes a single large polyprotein of about 3000 amino acids. The polyprotein comprises a core protein, envelope proteins E1 and E2, a membrane bound protein p7, and the non-structural proteins NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A and NS5B. Chronic HCV infection is associated with progressive liver pathology, including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Chronic hepatitis C may be treated with peginterferon-alpha in combination with ribavirin. Substantial limitations to efficacy and tolerability remain as many users suffer from side effects, and viral elimination from the body is often incomplete. Therefore, there is a need for new therapies to treat HCV infection. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION One aspect of the present invention features methods for treating HCV infection in a subject in need of such treatment. The methods comprise administering at least two direct acting antiviral agents (DAAs) to the subject for a duration of no more than 12 weeks, or for another duration as set forth herein. The at least two DAAs comprise Compound 1 (or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof) and Compound 2 (or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof); and the at least two DAAs can also additionally comprise one or more other DAAs, such as sofosbuvir or another HCV polymerase inhibitor. Preferably, the duration of the treatment is 12 weeks. The duration of the treatment can also last for less than 12 weeks; for example, the duration can last for 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5 or 4 weeks, or no more than 8 weeks. Where three or more DAAs are used in the treatment regimen, the duration of the treatment preferably lasts for no more than 8 weeks; for example, the duration can last for 8, 7, 6, 5 or 4 weeks. Preferably, the two or more DAAs are administered in amounts effective to provide a sustained virological response (SVR) or achieve another desired measure of effectiveness in the subject. The subject is not administered either interferon or ribavirin during the treatment regimen. Put another way, the methods exclude the administration of interferon and ribavirin to the subject, thereby avoiding the side effects associated with interferon or ribavirin. Another aspect of the present invention features methods for treating a population of subjects having HCV infection. The methods comprise administering at least two DAAs to the subjects for a duration of no more than 12 weeks, such as for a duration of 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5 or 4 weeks, or no more than 8 weeks. The at least two DAAs comprise Compound 1 (or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof) and Compound 2 (or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof); and the at least two DAAs can also additionally comprise one or more other DAAs, such as sofosbuvir or another HCV polymerase inhibitor. Preferably, the at least two DAAs are administered to the subjects in amounts effective to result in SVR or another measure of effectiveness in at least about 70% of the population, preferably at least about 80% of the population, or more preferably at least about 90% of the population. In any method described herein, the at least two DAAs comprise (a) Compound 1 or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and (b) Compound 2 or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. The at least two DAAs can also optionally comprise one or more other anti-HCV agents. These other optional anti-HCV agents can be selected from protease inhibitors, nucleoside or nucleotide polymerase inhibitors, non-nucleoside polymerase inhibitors, NS3B inhibitors, NS4A inhibitors, NS5A inhibitors, NS5B inhibitors, cyclophilin inhibitors, or combinations thereof. Non-limiting examples of the other optional antic-HCV agents include PSI-7977 (sofosbuvir), PSI-938, BMS-790052 (daclatasvir), BMS-650032 (asunaprevir), BMS-791325, GS-5885 (ledipasvir), GS-9451 (tegobuvir), GS-9190, GS-9256, BI-201335, BI-27127, telaprevir, VX-222, TMC-435 (simepravir), MK-5172, MK-7009 (vaniprevir), danoprevir, R7128 (mericitabine), and any combination thereof. For example, the DAAs used in a method of the present invention can comprise or consist of (a) Compound 1 or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and (b) Compound 2 or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. For another example, the DAAs used in a method of the present invention can comprise or consist of (a) Compound 1 or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, (b) Compound 2 or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and (c) a HCV polymerase inhibitor, wherein said HCV polymerase inhibitor can be a nucleotide or nucleoside polymerase inhibitor or a non-nucleoside or non-nucleotide polymerase inhibitor. For yet another example, the DAAs used in a method of the present invention can comprise or consist of (a) Compound 1 or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, (b) Compound 2 or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and (c) a nucleotide or nucleoside HCV polymerase inhibitor. For yet another example, the DAAs used in a method of the present invention can comprise or consist of (a) Compound 1 or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, (b) Compound 2 or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and (c) sofosbuvir. For yet another example, the DAAs used in a method of the present invention can comprise or consist of (a) Compound 2 or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and (b) sofosbuvir. In any method described herein, the DAAs can be administered in any effective dosing schemes and/or frequencies; for example, they can each be administered daily. Each DAA can be administered either separately or in combination, and each DAA can be administered once a day, twice a day, or three times a day. Preferably, Compound 1 (or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof) and Compound 2 (or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof) are administered once daily. Preferably, Compound 1 (or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof) is administered from 100 mg to 600 mg once daily, and Compound 2 (or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof) is administered from 50 to 500 mg once daily. More preferably, Compound 1 (or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof) is administered from 200 mg to 600 mg once daily, and Compound 2 (or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof) is administered from 100 to 500 mg once daily. Highly preferably, Compound 1 (or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof) is administered from 400 mg to 600 mg once daily, and Compound 2 (or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof) is administered from 100 to 500 mg once daily. It was unexpectedly found that 200-300 mg Compound 1 has comparable anti-HCV efficacy to 400 mg Compound 1. Therefore, more preferably, Compound 1 (or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof) is administered from 200 mg to 300 mg once daily, and Compound 2 (or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof) is administered from 100 to 500 mg once daily. For example, Compound 1 (or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof) can be administered 200 mg once daily, and Compound 2 (or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof) is administered 120 mg once daily. For another example, Compound 1 (or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof) can be administered 300 mg once daily, and Compound 2 (or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof) is administered 120 mg once daily. For yet another example, Compound 1 (or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof) can be administered 400 mg once daily, and Compound 2 (or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof) is administered 120 mg once daily. For another example, Compound 1 (or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof) can be administered 400 mg once daily, and Compound 2 (or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof) can be administered 240 mg once daily. In yet another aspect, the present invention features a combination of Compound 1 (or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof) and Compound 2 (or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof) for use to treat HCV infection. The treatment comprises administering the DAAs to a subject infected with HCV. The duration of the treatment regimen is no more than twelve weeks (e.g., the duration being 12 weeks; or the duration being 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, or 3 weeks). Preferably, the duration of the treatment regimen is twelve weeks. The duration of the treatment can also last, for example, no more than eight weeks (e.g., the duration being 8 weeks; or the duration being 7, 6, 5, 4, or 3 weeks). The treatment does not include administering interferon or ribavirin (i.e., neither interferon nor ribavirin are administered). Compound 1 (or the salt thereof) and Compound 2 (or the salt thereof) can be administered concurrently or sequentially. Preferably, Compound 1 (or the salt thereof) and Compound 2 (or the salt thereof) can be administered once daily.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The methods of the present invention include administering Compound 1 (or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof) and Compound 2 (or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof) to a subject in need thereof. Compound 1 has the following structure: Compound 1 is a potent HCV protease inhibitor and is described in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2012/0070416. Compound 2 has the following structure: Compound 2 is a potent NS5A inhibitor and is described in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2012/0220562. The current standard of care (SOC) for the treatment of HCV includes a course of treatment of interferon, e.g. pegylated interferon (e.g., pegylated interferon-alpha-2a or pegylated interferon-alpha-2b, such as PEGASYS by Roche, or PEG-INTRON by Schering-Plough) and the antiviral drug ribavirin (e.g., COPEGUS by Roche, REBETOL by Schering-Plough, or RIBASPHERE by Three Rivers Pharmaceuticals). The treatment often lasts for 24-48 weeks, depending on hepatitis C virus genotype. Other interferons include, but are not limited to, interferon-alpha-2a (e.g., Roferon-A by Roche), interferon-alpha-2b (e.g., Intron-A by Schering-Plough), and interferon alfacon-1 (consensus interferon) (e.g., Infergen by Valeant). The interferon/ribavirin-based treatment may be physically demanding, and can lead to temporary disability in some cases. A substantial proportion of patients will experience a panoply of side effects ranging from a “flu-like” syndrome (the most common, experienced for a few days after the weekly injection of interferon) to severe adverse events including anemia, cardiovascular events and psychiatric problems such as suicide or suicidal ideation. The latter are exacerbated by the general physiological stress experienced by the patients. Ribavirin also has a number of side effects, including, anemia, high pill burden (e.g. 5-6 pills a day split BID) and teratogenicity restricting use in women of childbearing age. The methods of the present invention provide effective treatment of HCV infection without the use of interferon or ribavirin and for a shorter period of time, for example and without limitation, a treatment duration of no more than twelve weeks, alternatively no more than eleven weeks, alternatively no more than ten weeks, alternatively no more than nine weeks, alternatively no more than eight weeks, alternatively no more than seven weeks, alternatively no more than six weeks, alternatively no more than five weeks, alternatively no more than four weeks, or alternatively, no more than three weeks. In one aspect, the present invention features methods for treating HCV infection in a subject comprising administering at least two DAAs, in the absence of interferon and ribavirin, to the subject for a duration of no more than twelve weeks, alternatively no more than eight weeks, such as for a duration of 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, or 4 weeks. Put another way, the methods exclude interferon and ribavirin, i.e. neither interferon nor ribavirin are administered. The at least two DAAs comprise Compound 1 (or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof) and Compound 2 (or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof), which can be co-administered, or administered separately or independently, with the same or different dosing frequencies. Preferably, the at least two DAAs are administered once a day. They can also be administered, for example, twice a day or three times a day.

Various measures may be used to express the effectiveness of a method of the present invention. One such measure is SVR, which, as used herein, means that the virus is undetectable at the end of therapy and for at least 8 weeks after the end of therapy (SVR8); preferably, the virus is undetectable at the end of therapy and for at least 12 weeks after the end of therapy (SVR12); more preferably, the virus is undetectable at the end of therapy and for at least 16 weeks after the end of therapy (SVR16); and highly preferably, the virus is undetectable at the end of therapy and for at least 24 weeks after the end of therapy (SVR24). SVR24 is often considered as a functional definition of cure; and a high rate of SVR at less than 24 week post-treatment (e.g., SVR8 or SVR12) can be predictive of a high rate of SVR24. Preferably, a method described herein achieves at least 70% SVR8. More preferably, a method described herein achieves at least 80% SVR8. Highly preferably, a method described herein achieves at least 90% SVR8. Most preferably, a method described herein achieves at least 95% SVR8.

These treatment regimens comprised administration of Compound 1 and Compound 2, but did not include administration of either interferon or ribavirin. Comparable SVR rates are expected for interferon-non responders.

Example 2 Combination of Compound 1 and Compound 2 In Vitro FIG. 9 shows that the combination of Compound 1 and Compound 2 exhibits significant synergistic effect on HCV inhibition as tested in HCV GT 1b Con-1 replication cells. The result was generated using Prichard and Shipman model (Prichard et al. ANTIVIRAL RESEARCH 14:181-205 (1990)). Compound 1 inhibited replication of HCV stable subgenomic replicons containing NS3 genes from GT 1a, 1b, 2a, 3a, 4a, or 6a with EC50 values ranging from 0.85 to 2.8 nM. Of note, Compound 1 was potent against replicon containing GT3a protease, with an EC50 value of 1.6 nM. Compound 1 retained its activity against common GT1a and 1b variants at NS3 amino acid positions 155 and 168 that conferred resistance to other HCV protease inhibitors (Pis). Resistant colony selection studies in GT1a and 1b subgenomic replicon cells identified A156T in GT1a and A156V in GT1b as the most frequent variants, which conferred 1400- and 1800-fold reduced susceptibility to Compound 1, respectively. However, these variants had in vitro replication capacities of only 1.5% and 9.2% that of their corresponding wild-type replicons. In a replicon containing GT3a NS3 protease, Compound 1 selected very few colonies at concentrations ≧100-fold over its EC50 value. The colonies that survived the selection contained either A156G alone, or Q168R co-selected with Y56H, which conferred 1500- or 1100-fold loss in susceptibility to Compound 1, respectively.
