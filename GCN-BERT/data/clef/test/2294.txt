IBRUTINIB COMBINATION THERAPY RELATED APPLICATIONS [0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S provisional patent application no. 61/809,810 entitled “IBRUTINIB COMBINATION THERAPY” filed on April 8, 2013, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0002] Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (Btk), a member of the Tec family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases, is a key signaling enzyme expressed in all hematopoietic cells types except Τ lymphocytes and natural killer cells. Btk plays an essential role in the B-cell signaling pathway linking cell surface B-cell receptor (BCR) stimulation to downstream intracellular responses. [0003] Btk is a key regulator of B-cell development, activation, signaling, and survival. In addition, Btk plays a role in a number of other hematopoietic cell signaling pathways, e.g., Toll like receptor (TLR) and cytokine receptor-mediated TNF-a production in macrophages, IgE receptor signaling in Mast cells, inhibition of Fas/APO-1 apoptotic signaling in B-lineage lymphoid cells, and collagen-stimulated platelet aggregation.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION [0050] Small molecule Btk inhibitors, such as Ibrutinib, are useful for reducing the risk of or treating a variety of diseases affected by or affecting many cell types of the hematopoietic lineage including, e.g., autoimmune diseases, heteroimmune conditions or diseases, inflammatory diseases, cancer (e.g., B-cell proliferative disorders), and thromboembolic disorders. Certain Terminology [0051] Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as is commonly understood by one of skill in the art to which the claimed subject matter belongs. It is to be understood that the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are not restrictive of any subject matter claimed. In this application, the use of the singular includes the plural unless specifically stated otherwise. It must be noted that, as used in the specification and the appended claims, the singular forms “a”, “an” and “the” include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. In this application, the use of “or” means “and/or” unless stated otherwise. Furthermore, use of the term “including” as well as other forms, such as “include”, “includes,” and “included,” is not limiting. [0052] The section headings used herein are for organizational purposes only and are not to be construed as limiting the subject matter described. All documents, or portions of documents, cited in the application including, but not limited to, patents, patent applications, articles, books, manuals, and treatises are hereby expressly incorporated by reference in their entirety for any purpose. [0053] The term “acceptable” or “pharmaceutically acceptable”, with respect to a formulation, composition or ingredient, as used herein, means having no persistent detrimental effect on the general health of the subject being treated or does not abrogate the biological activity or properties of the compound, and is relatively nontoxic. [0054] “Bioavailability” refers to the percentage of Ibrutinib dosed that is delivered into the general circulation of the animal or human being studied. The total exposure (AUC(O-co)) of a drug when administered intravenously is usually defined as 100% bioavailable (F%). “Oral bioavailability” refers to the extent to which Ibrutinib is absorbed into the general circulation when the pharmaceutical composition is taken orally as compared to intravenous injection. [0055] “Blood plasma concentration” refers to the concentration of Ibrutinib in the plasma component of blood of a subject. It is understood that the plasma concentration of Ibrutinib may vary significantly between subjects, due to variability with respect to metabolism and/or possible interactions with other therapeutic agents. In accordance with one embodiment disclosed herein, the blood or plasma concentration of Ibrutinib may vary from subject to subject. Likewise, values such as maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) or time to reach maximum plasma concentration (Tmax), or total area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC(O-co)) may vary from subject to subject. Due to this variability, the amount necessary to constitute “a therapeutically effective amount” of Ibrutinib may vary from subject to subject. [0056] The terms “co-administration” or the like, as used herein, are meant to encompass administration of the selected therapeutic agents to a single patient, and are intended to include treatment regimens in which the agents are administered by the same or different route of administration or at the same or different time. [0057] The terms “effective amount” or “therapeutically effective amount,” as used herein, refer to a sufficient amount of an agent or a compound being administered which will relieve to some extent one or more of the symptoms of the disease or condition being treated. The result can be reduction and/or alleviation of the signs, symptoms, or causes of a disease, or any other desired alteration of a biological system. For example, an “effective amount” for therapeutic uses is the amount of the composition including a compound as disclosed herein required to provide a clinically significant decrease in disease symptoms without undue adverse side effects. An appropriate “effective amount” in any individual case may be determined using techniques, such as a dose escalation study. The term “therapeutically effective amount” includes, for example, a prophylactically effective amount. An “effective amount” of a compound disclosed herein is an amount effective to achieve a desired pharmacologic effect or therapeutic improvement without undue adverse side effects. It is understood that “an effect amount” or “a therapeutically effective amount” can vary from subject to subject, due to variation in metabolism of Ibrutinib, age, weight, general condition of the subject, the condition being treated, the severity of the condition being treated, and the judgment of the prescribing physician. By way of example only, therapeutically effective amounts may be determined by routine experimentation, including but not limited to a dose escalation clinical trial. [0058] The terms “enhance” or “enhancing” means to increase or prolong either in potency or duration a desired effect. By way of example, “enhancing” the effect of therapeutic agents refers to the ability to increase or prolong, either in potency or duration, the effect of therapeutic agents on during treatment of a disease, disorder or condition. An “enhancing-effective amount,” as used herein, refers to an amount adequate to enhance the effect of a therapeutic agent in the treatment of a disease, disorder or condition. When used in a patient, amounts effective for this use will depend on the severity and course of the disease, disorder or condition, previous therapy, the patient's health status and response to the drugs, and the judgment of the treating physician. [0059] The terms “subject”, “patient” and “individual” are used interchangeably. As used herein, they refer to an animal. By way of example only, a subject may be, but is not limited to, a mammal including, but not limited to, a human. The terms do not require the supervision (whether continuous or intermittent) of a medical professional. [0060] The terms “treat,” “treating” or “treatment”, as used herein, include alleviating, abating or ameliorating a disease or condition symptoms, preventing additional symptoms, ameliorating or preventing the underlying metabolic causes of symptoms, inhibiting the disease or condition, e.g., arresting the development of the disease or condition, relieving the disease or condition, causing regression of the disease or condition, relieving a condition caused by the disease or condition, or stopping the symptoms of the disease or condition. The terms “treat,” “treating” or “treatment”, include, but are not limited to, prophylactic and/or therapeutic treatments. [0061] As used herein, the IC5o refers to an amount, concentration or dosage of a particular test compound that achieves a 50% inhibition of a maximal response, such as inhibition of Btk, in an assay that measures such response. [0062] As used herein, EC5o refers to a dosage, concentration or amount of a particular test compound that elicits a dose-dependent response at 50% of maximal expression of a particular response that is induced, provoked or potentiated by the particular test compound.

[00112] B-cell proliferative disorders (BCPDs) are neoplasms of the blood and encompass, inter alia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, multiple myeloma, and leukemia. BCPDs can originate either in the lymphatic tissues (as in the case of lymphoma) or in the bone marrow (as in the case of leukemia and myeloma), and they all are involved with the uncontrolled growth of lymphocytes or white blood cells. There are many subtypes of BCPD, e.g., chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). The disease course and treatment of BCPD is dependent on the BCPD subtype; however, even within each subtype the clinical presentation, morphologic appearance, and response to therapy is heterogeneous. [00113] Malignant lymphomas are neoplastic transformations of cells that reside predominantly within lymphoid tissues. Two groups of malignant lymphomas are Hodgkin's lymphoma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Both types of lymphomas infiltrate reticuloendothelial tissues. However, they differ in the neoplastic cell of origin, site of disease, presence of systemic symptoms, and response to treatment (Freedman et al., "Non-Hodgkin's Lymphomas" Chapter 134, Cancer Medicine, (an approved publication of the American Cancer Society, B.C. Decker Inc., Hamilton, Ontario, 2003). Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphomas [00114] Disclosed herein, in certain embodiments, is a method for treating a non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma in an individual in need thereof, comprising: administering a combination of a Btk inhibitor and a Second anticancer agent. [00115] Disclosed herein, in certain embodiments, is a method for treating a non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma in an individual in need thereof, comprising: administering a combination of Ibrutinib and a Second anticancer agent. [00116] Further disclosed herein, in certain embodiments, is a method for treating relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma in an individual in need thereof, comprising: administering to the individual a combination of a Btk inhibitor and a Second anticancer agent. In some embodiments, the non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma is relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma, or relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma. [00117] Further disclosed herein, in certain embodiments, is a method for treating relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma in an individual in need thereof, comprising: administering to the individual a combination of Ibrutinib and a Second anticancer agent. In some embodiments, the non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma is relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma, or relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma. [00118] Non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) are a diverse group of malignancies that are predominately of B-cell origin. NHL may develop in any organs associated with lymphatic system such as spleen, lymph nodes or tonsils and can occur at any age. NHL is often marked by enlarged lymph nodes, fever, and weight loss. NHL is classified as either B-cell or T-cell NHL. Lymphomas related to lymphoproliferative disorders following bone marrow or stem cell transplantation are usually B-cell NHL. In the Working Formulation classification scheme, NHL has been divided into low-, intermediate-, and high-grade categories by virtue of their natural histories (see "The Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma Pathologic Classification Project," Cancer 49(1982):2112-2135). The low-grade lymphomas are indolent, with a median survival of 5 to 10 years (Homing and Rosenberg (1984) Ν. Engl. J. Med. 311:1471-1475). Although chemotherapy can induce remissions in the majority of indolent lymphomas, cures are rare and most patients eventually relapse, requiring further therapy. The intermediate- and high-grade lymphomas are more aggressive tumors, but they have a greater chance for cure with chemotherapy. However, a significant proportion of these patients will relapse and require further treatment. [00119] A non-limiting list of the B-cell NHL includes Burkitfs lymphoma (e.g., Endemic Burkitt's Lymphoma and Sporadic Burkitfs Lymphoma), Cutaneous B-Cell Lymphoma, Cutaneous Marginal Zone Lymphoma (MZL), Diffuse Large Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL), Diffuse Mixed Small and Large Cell Lymphoma, Diffuse Small Cleaved Cell, Diffuse Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma, Extranodal Marginal Zone B-cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, Lollicular Small Cleaved Cell (Grade 1), Lollicular Mixed Small Cleaved and Large Cell (Grade 2), Lollicular Large Cell (Grade 3), Intravascular Large B-Cell Lymphoma, Intravascular Lymphomatosis, Large Cell Immunoblastic Lymphoma, Large Cell Lymphoma (LCL), Lymphoblastic Lymphoma, MALT Lymphoma, Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL), immunoblastic large cell lymphoma, precursor B-lymphoblastic lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), extranodal marginal zone 13-cell lymphoma-mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma, Mediastinal Large 13-Cell Lymphoma, nodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma, splenic marginal zone B-cell lymphoma, primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma, lymphoplasmocytic lymphoma, hairy cell leukemia, Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia, and primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma. Additional non-Hodgkin's lymphomas are contemplated within the scope of the present invention and apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art. DLBCL [00120] Disclosed herein, in certain embodiments, is a method for treating a DLCBL in an individual in need thereof, comprising: administering a combination of a Btk inhibitor and a Second anticancer agent. [00121] Further disclosed herein, in certain embodiments, is a method for treating a DLCBL in an individual in need thereof, comprising: administering a combination of Ibrutinib and a Second anticancer agent. [00122] As used herein, the term “Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)” refers to a neoplasm of the germinal center Β lymphocytes with a diffuse growth pattern and a highintermediate proliferation index. DLBCLs represent approximately 30% of all lymphomas and may present with several morphological variants including the centroblastic, immunoblastic, Τcell/histiocyte rich, anaplastic and plasmoblastic subtypes. Genetic tests have shown that there are different subtypes of DLBCL. These subtypes seem to have different outlooks (prognoses) and responses to treatment. DLBCL can affect any age group but occurs mostly in older people (the average age is mid-60s). [00123] Disclosed herein, in certain embodiments, is a method for treating diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, activated Β cell-like subtype (ABC-DLBCL), in an individual in need thereof, comprising: administering to the individual a combination of Ibrutinib and a Second anticancer agent. The ABC subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (ABC-DLBCL) is thought to arise from post germinal center Β cells that are arrested during plasmatic differentiation. The ABC subtype of DLBCL (ABC-DLBCL) accounts for approximately 30% total DLBCL diagnoses. It is considered the least curable of the DLBCL molecular subtypes and, as such, patients diagnosed with the ABC-DLBCL typically display significantly reduced survival rates compared with individuals with other types of DLCBL. ABC-DLBCL is most commonly associated with chromosomal translocations deregulating the germinal center master regulator BCL6 and with mutations inactivating the PRDM1 gene, which encodes a transcriptional repressor required for plasma cell differentiation. [00124] A particularly relevant signaling pathway in the pathogenesis of ABC-DLBCL is the one mediated by the nuclear factor (NF)-kB transcription complex. The NF-kB family comprises 5 members (ρ50, ρ52, ρ65, c-rel and RelB) that form homo- and heterodimers and function as transcriptional factors to mediate a variety of proliferation, apoptosis, inflammatory and immune responses and are critical for normal B-cell development and survival. NF-kB is widely used by eukaryotic cells as a regulator of genes that control cell proliferation and cell survival. As such, many different types of human tumors have misregulated NF-kB: that is, NF-kB is constitutively active. Active NF-kB turns on the expression of genes that keep the cell proliferating and protect the cell from conditions that would otherwise cause it to die via apoptosis. [00125] The dependence of ABC DLBCLs on NF-kB depends on a signaling pathway upstream of IkB kinase comprised of CARD11, BCL10 and MALT1 (the CBM complex). Interference with the CBM pathway extinguishes NF-kB signaling in ABC DLBCL cells and induces apoptosis. The molecular basis for constitutive activity of the NF-kB pathway is a subject of current investigation but some somatic alterations to the genome of ABC DLBCLs clearly invoke this pathway. For example, somatic mutations of the coiled-coil domain of CARD 11 in DLBCL render this signaling scaffold protein able to spontaneously nucleate protein-protein interaction with MALT1 and BCL10, causing IKK activity and NF-kB activation. Constitutive activity of the Β cell receptor signaling pathway has been implicated in the activation of NF-kB in ABC DLBCLs with wild type CARD11, and this is associated with mutations within the cytoplasmic tails of the Β cell receptor subunits CD79A and CD79B. Oncogenic activating mutations in the signaling adapter MYD88 activate NF-kB and synergize with Β cell receptor signaling in sustaining the survival of ABC DLBCL cells. In addition, inactivating mutations in a negative regulator of the NF-kB pathway, Α20, occur almost exclusively in ABC DLBCL. [00126] Indeed, genetic alterations affecting multiple components of the NF-kB signaling pathway have been recently identified in more than 50% of ABC-DLBCL patients, where these lesions promote constitutive NF-kB activation, thereby contributing to lymphoma growth. These include mutations of CARD 11 (-10% of the cases), a lymphocyte-specific cytoplasmic scaffolding protein that-together with MALT1 and BCL10-forms the BCR signalosome, which relays signals from antigen receptors to the downstream mediators of NF-kB activation. An even larger fraction of cases (-30%) carry biallelic genetic lesions inactivating the negative NF-kB regulator Α20. Further, high levels of expression of NF-kB target genes have been observed in ABC-DLBCL tumor samples. See, e.g., U. Klein et al., (2008), Nature Reviews Immunology 8:22-23; R.E. Davis et al., (2001), Journal of Experimental Medicine 194:1861-1874; G. Lentz et al., (2008), Science 319:1676-1679; Μ. Compagno et al., (2009), Nature 459:712-721; and L. Srinivasan et al., (2009), Cell 139:573-586). [00127] DLBCL cells of the ABC subtype, such as OCI-LylO, have chronic active BCR signaling and are very sensitive to the Btk inhibitor described herein. The irreversible Btk inhibitor described herein potently and irreversibly inhibits the growth of OCI-LylO (EC50 continuous exposure =10 ηΜ, EC50 1 hour pulse = 50 ηΜ). In addition, induction of apoptosis, as shown by capsase activation, Annexin-V flow cytometry and increase in sub-GO fraction is observed in OCILylO. Both sensitive and resistant cells express Btk at similar levels, and the active site of Btk is fully occupied by the inhibitor in both as shown using a fluorescently labeled affinity probe. OCI-LylO cells are shown to have chronically active BCR signaling to NF-kB which is dose dependently inhibited by the Btk inhibitors described herein. The activity of Btk inhibitors in the cell lines studied herein are also characterized by comparing signal transduction profiles (Btk, PLCy, ERK, NF-kB, ΑΚΤ), cytokine secretion profiles and mRNA expression profiles, both with and without BCR stimulation, and observed significant differences in these profiles that lead to clinical biomarkers that identify the most sensitive patient populations to Btk inhibitor treatment.

Follicular Lymphoma [00128] Disclosed herein, in certain embodiments, is a method for treating a follicular lymphoma in an individual in need thereof, comprising: administering a combination of a Btk inhibitor and a Second anticancer agent. [00129] Further disclosed herein, in certain embodiments, is a method for treating a follicular lymphoma in an individual in need thereof, comprising: administering a combination of Ibrutinib and a Second anticancer agent. [00130] As used herein, the term “follicular lymphoma” refers to any of several types of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in which the lymphomatous cells are clustered into nodules or follicles. The term follicular is used because the cells tend to grow in a circular, or nodular, pattern in lymph nodes. The average age for people with this lymphoma is about 60. CLL/SLL [00131] Disclosed herein, in certain embodiments, is a method for treating a CLL or SLL in an individual in need thereof, comprising: administering a combination of a Btk inhibitor and a Second anticancer agent. [00132] Further disclosed herein, in certain embodiments, is a method for treating a CLL or SLL in an individual in need thereof, comprising: administering a combination of Ibrutinib and a Second anticancer agent. [00133] Chronic lymphocytic leukemia and small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) are commonly thought as the same disease with slightly different manifestations. Where the cancerous cells gather determines whether it is called CLL or SLL. When the cancer cells are primarily found in the lymph nodes, lima bean shaped structures of the lymphatic system (a system primarily of tiny vessels found in the body), it is called SLL. SLL accounts for about 5% to 10% of all lymphomas. When most of the cancer cells are in the bloodstream and the bone marrow, it is called CLL. [00134] Both CLL and SLL are slow-growing diseases, although CLL, which is much more common, tends to grow slower. CLL and SLL are treated the same way. They are usually not considered curable with standard treatments, but depending on the stage and growth rate of the disease, most patients live longer than 10 years. Occasionally over time, these slow-growing lymphomas may transform into a more aggressive type of lymphoma. [00135] Chronic lymphoid leukemia (CLL) is the most common type of leukemia. It is estimated that 100,760 people in the United States are living with or are in remission from CLL. Most (>75%) people newly diagnosed with CLL are over the age of 50. Currently CLL treatment focuses on controlling the disease and its symptoms rather than on an outright cure. CLL is treated by chemotherapy, radiation therapy, biological therapy, or bone marrow transplantation. Symptoms are sometimes treated surgically (splenectomy removal of enlarged spleen) or by radiation therapy ("de-bulking" swollen lymph nodes). Though CLL progresses slowly in most cases, it is considered generally incurable. Certain CLLs are classified as high-risk. As used herein, “high risk CLL” means CLL characterized by at least one of the following 1) 17ρ13-; 2) 1 lq22-; 3) unmutated IgVH together with ΖΑΡ-70+ and/or CD38+; or 4) trisomy 12. [00136] CLL treatment is typically administered when the patient's clinical symptoms or blood counts indicate that the disease has progressed to a point where it may affect the patient's quality of life. [00137] Small lymphocytic leukemia (SLL) is very similar to CLL described supra, and is also a cancer of B-cells. In SLL the abnormal lymphocytes mainly affect the lymph nodes. However, in CLL the abnormal cells mainly affect the blood and the bone marrow. The spleen may be affected in both conditions. SLL accounts for about 1 in 25 of all cases of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. It can occur at any time from young adulthood to old age, but is rare under the age of 50. SLL is considered an indolent lymphoma. This means that the disease progresses very slowly, and patients tend to live many years after diagnosis. However, most patients are diagnosed with advanced disease, and although SLL responds well to a variety of chemotherapy drugs, it is generally considered to be incurable. Although some cancers tend to occur more often in one gender or the other, cases and deaths due to SLL are evenly split between men and women. The average age at the time of diagnosis is 60 years. [00138] Although SLL is indolent, it is persistently progressive. The usual pattern of this disease is one of high response rates to radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy, with a period of disease remission. This is followed months or years later by an inevitable relapse. Re-treatment leads to a response again, but again the disease will relapse. This means that although the short-term prognosis of SLL is quite good, over time, many patients develop fatal complications of recurrent disease. Considering the age of the individuals typically diagnosed with CLL and SLL, there is a need in the art for a simple and effective treatment of the disease with minimum sideeffects that do not impede on the patient’s quality of life. The instant invention fulfills this long standing need in the art. Mantle Cell Lymphoma [00139] Disclosed herein, in certain embodiments, is a method for treating a Mantle cell lymphoma in an individual in need thereof, comprising: administering a combination of a Btk inhibitor and a Second anticancer agent. [00140] Further disclosed herein, in certain embodiments, is a method for treating a Mantle cell lymphoma in an individual in need thereof, comprising: administering a combination of Ibrutinib and a Second anticancer agent. [00141] As used herein, the term, “Mantle cell lymphoma” refers to a subtype of B-cell lymphoma, due to CD5 positive antigen-naive pregerminal center B-cell within the mantle zone that surrounds normal germinal center follicles. MCL cells generally over-express cyclin D1 due to a t(l 1:14) chromosomal translocation in the DNA. More specifically, the translocation is at t(l I;14)(ql3;q32). Only about 5% of lymphomas are of this type. The cells are small to medium in size. Men are affected most often. The average age of patients is in the early 60s. The lymphoma is usually widespread when it is diagnosed, involving lymph nodes, bone marrow, and, very often, the spleen. Mantle cell lymphoma is not a very fast growing lymphoma, but is difficult to treat. Marginal Zone B-cell Lymphoma [00142] Disclosed herein, in certain embodiments, is a method for treating a marginal zone Βcell lymphoma in an individual in need thereof, comprising: administering a combination of a Btk inhibitor and a Second anticancer agent. [00143] Further disclosed herein, in certain embodiments, is a method for treating a marginal zone B-cell lymphoma in an individual in need thereof, comprising: administering a combination of Ibrutinib and a Second anticancer agent. [00144] As used herein, the term “marginal zone B-cell lymphoma” refers to a group of related B-cell neoplasms that involve the lymphoid tissues in the marginal zone, the patchy area outside the follicular mantle zone. Marginal zone lymphomas account for about 5% to 10% of lymphomas. The cells in these lymphomas look small under the microscope. There are 3 main types of marginal zone lymphomas including extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphomas, nodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma, and splenic marginal zone lymphoma. MALT [00145] Disclosed herein, in certain embodiments, is a method for treating a MALT in an individual in need thereof, comprising: administering a combination of a Btk inhibitor and a Second anticancer agent. [00146] Further disclosed herein, in certain embodiments, is a method for treating a MALT in an individual in need thereof, comprising: administering a combination of Ibrutinib and a Second anticancer agent. [00147] The term “mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma”, as used herein, refers to extranodal manifestations of marginal-zone lymphomas. Most MALT lymphoma are a low grade, although a minority either manifest initially as intermediate-grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) or evolve from the low-grade form. Most of the MALT lymphoma occur in the stomach, and roughly 70% of gastric MALT lymphoma are associated with Helicobacter pylori infection. Several cytogenetic abnormalities have been identified, the most common being trisomy 3 or t(l 1;18). Many of these other MALT lymphoma have also been linked to infections with bacteria or viruses. The average age of patients with MALT lymphoma is about 60. Nodal Marginal Zone B-Cell Lymphoma [00148] Disclosed herein, in certain embodiments, is a method for treating a nodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma in an individual in need thereof, comprising: administering a combination of a Btk inhibitor and a Second anticancer agent. [00149] Further disclosed herein, in certain embodiments, is a method for treating a nodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma in an individual in need thereof, comprising: administering a combination of Ibrutinib and a Second anticancer agent. [00150] The term “nodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma” refers to an indolent B-cell lymphoma that is found mostly in the lymph nodes. The disease is rare and only accounts for 1% of all Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphomas (NHL). It is most commonly diagnosed in older patients, with women more susceptible than men. The disease is classified as a marginal zone lymphoma because the mutation occurs in the marginal zone of the B-cells. Due to its confinement in the lymph nodes, this disease is also classified as nodal. Splenic Marginal Zone B-Cell Lymphoma [00151] Disclosed herein, in certain embodiments, is a method for treating a splenic marginal zone B-cell lymphoma in an individual in need thereof, comprising: administering a combination of a Btk inhibitor and a Second anticancer agent. [00152] Further disclosed herein, in certain embodiments, is a method for treating a splenic marginal zone B-cell lymphoma in an individual in need thereof, comprising: administering a combination of Ibrutinib and a Second anticancer agent. [00153] The term “splenic marginal zone B-cell lymphoma” refers to specific low-grade small B-cell lymphoma that is incorporated in the World Health Organization classification. Characteristic features are splenomegaly, moderate lymphocytosis with villous morphology, intrasinusoidal pattern of involvement of various organs, especially bone marrow, and relative indolent course. Tumor progression with increase of blastic forms and aggressive behavior are observed in a minority of patients. Molecular and cytogenetic studies have shown heterogeneous results probably because of the lack of standardized diagnostic criteria. Burkitt Lymphoma [00154] Disclosed herein, in certain embodiments, is a method for treating a Burkitt lymphoma in an individual in need thereof, comprising: administering a combination of a Btk inhibitor and a Second anticancer agent. [00155] Further disclosed herein, in certain embodiments, is a method for treating a Burkitt lymphoma in an individual in need thereof, comprising: administering a combination of Ibrutinib and a Second anticancer agent. [00156] The term “Burkitt lymphoma” refers to a type of Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) that commonly affects children. It is a highly aggressive type of B-cell lymphoma that often starts and involves body parts other than lymph nodes. In spite of its fast-growing nature, Burkitt’s lymphoma is often curable with modem intensive therapies. There are two broad types of Burkitt’s lymphoma - the sporadic and the endemic varieties: [00157] Endemic Burkitt’s lymphoma: The disease involves children much more than adults, and is related to Epstein Barr Vims (EBV) infection in 95% cases. It occurs primarily is equatorial Africa, where about half of all childhood cancers are Burkitt’s lymphoma. It characteristically has a high chance of involving the jawbone, a rather distinctive feature that is rare in sporadic Burkitt’s. It also commonly involves the abdomen. [00158] Sporadic Burkitt’s lymphoma: The type of Burkitt’s lymphoma that affects the rest of the world, including Europe and the Americas is the sporadic type. Here too, it's mainly a disease in children. The link between Epstein Barr Vims (EBV) is not as strong as with the endemic variety, though direct evidence of EBV infection is present in one out of five patients. More than the involvement of lymph nodes, it is the abdomen that is notably affected in more than 90% of the children. Bone marrow involvement is more common than in the sporadic variety. Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia [00159] Disclosed herein, in certain embodiments, is a method for treating a Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia in an individual in need thereof, comprising: administering a combination of a Btk inhibitor and a Second anticancer agent. [00160] Further disclosed herein, in certain embodiments, is a method for treating a Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia in an individual in need thereof, comprising: administering a combination of Ibrutinib and a Second anticancer agent. [00161] The term “Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia”, also known as lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, is cancer involving a subtype of white blood cells called lymphocytes. It is characterized by an uncontrolled clonal proliferation of terminally differentiated Β lymphocytes. It is also characterized by the lymphoma cells making an antibody called immunoglobulin Μ (IgM). The IgM antibodies circulate in the blood in large amounts, and cause the liquid part of the blood to thicken, like syrup. This can lead to decreased blood flow to many organs, which can cause problems with vision (because of poor circulation in blood vessels in the back of the eyes) and neurological problems (such as headache, dizziness, and confusion) caused by poor blood flow within the brain. Other symptoms can include feeling tired and weak, and a tendency to bleed easily. The underlying etiology is not fully understood but a number of risk factors have been identified, including the locus 6ρ21.3 on chromosome 6. There is a 2- to 3-fold risk increase of developing WM in people with a personal history of autoimmune diseases with autoantibodies and particularly elevated risks associated with hepatitis, human immunodeficiency virus, and rickettsiosis. Multiple Myeloma [00162] Disclosed herein, in certain embodiments, is a method for treating a myeloma in an individual in need thereof, comprising: administering a combination of a Btk inhibitor and a Second anticancer agent. [00163] Further disclosed herein, in certain embodiments, is a method for treating a myeloma in an individual in need thereof, comprising: administering a combination of Ibrutinib and a Second anticancer agent. [00164] Multiple myeloma, also known as MM, myeloma, plasma cell myeloma, or as Kahler's disease (after Otto Kahler) is a cancer of the white blood cells known as plasma cells. A type of Β cell, plasma cells are a crucial part of the immune system responsible for the production of antibodies in humans and other vertebrates. They are produced in the bone marrow and are transported through the lymphatic system. Leukemia [00165] Disclosed herein, in certain embodiments, is a method for treating a leukemia in an individual in need thereof, comprising: administering a combination of a Btk inhibitor and a Second anticancer agent. [00166] Further disclosed herein, in certain embodiments, is a method for treating a leukemia in an individual in need thereof, comprising: administering a combination of Ibrutinib and a Second anticancer agent. [00167] Leukemia is a cancer of the blood or bone marrow characterized by an abnormal increase of blood cells, usually leukocytes (white blood cells). Leukemia is a broad term covering a spectrum of diseases. The first division is between its acute and chronic forms: (i) acute leukemia is characterized by the rapid increase of immature blood cells. This crowding makes the bone marrow unable to produce healthy blood cells. Immediate treatment is required in acute leukemia due to the rapid progression and accumulation of the malignant cells, which then spill over into the bloodstream and spread to other organs of the body. Acute forms of leukemia are the most common forms of leukemia in children; (ii) chronic leukemia is distinguished by the excessive build up of relatively mature, but still abnormal, white blood cells Typically taking months or years to progress, the cells are produced at a much higher rate than normal cells, resulting in many abnormal white blood cells in the blood. Chronic leukemia mostly occurs in older people, but can theoretically occur in any age group. Additionally, the diseases are subdivided according to which kind of blood cell is affected. This split divides leukemias into lymphoblastic or lymphocytic leukemias and myeloid or myelogenous leukemias (i) lymphoblastic or lymphocytic leukemias, the cancerous change takes place in a type of marrow cell that normally goes on to form lymphocytes, which are infection-fighting immune system cells; (ii) myeloid or myelogenous leukemias, the cancerous change takes place in a type of marrow cell that normally goes on to form red blood cells, some other types of white cells, and platelets. [00168] Within these main categories, there are several subcategories including, but not limited to, Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), and Hairy cell leukemia (HCL). [00169] Symptoms, diagnostic tests, and prognostic tests for each of the above-mentioned conditions are known. See, e.g., Harrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine©,” 16th ed., 2004, The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. Dey et al. (2006), Cytojoumal 3(24), and the “Revised European American Lymphoma” (REAL) classification system (see, e.g., the website maintained by the National Cancer Institute). [00170] A number of animal models are useful for establishing a range of therapeutically effective doses of irreversible Btk inhibitor compounds, such as Ibrutinib, for treating any of the foregoing diseases. [00171] The therapeutic efficacy of Ibrutinib for any one of the foregoing diseases can be optimized during a course of treatment. For example, a subject being treated can undergo a diagnostic evaluation to correlate the relief of disease symptoms or pathologies to inhibition of in vivo Btk activity achieved by administering a given dose of Ibrutinib. Cellular assays known in the art can be used to determine in vivo activity of Btk in the presence or absence of an irreversible Btk inhibitor. For example, since activated Btk is phosphorylated at tyrosine 223 (Υ223) and tyrosine 551 (Υ551), phospho-specific immunocytochemical staining of Ρ-Υ223 or Ρ-Υ5 51-positive cells can be used to detect or quantify activation of Btk in a population of cells (e.g., by FACS analysis of stained vs unstained cells). See, e.g., Nisitani et αℓ. (1999), Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci, USA 96:2221-2226. Thus, the amount of the Btk inhibitor compound that is administered to a subject can be increased or decreased as needed so as to maintain a level of Btk inhibition optimal for treating the subject’s disease state. [00172] Ibrutinib can irreversibly inhibit Btk and may be used to treat mammals suffering from Bruton’s tyrosine kinase-dependent or Bruton’s tyrosine kinase mediated conditions or diseases, including, but not limited to, cancer, autoimmune and other inflammatory diseases. Ibrutinib has shown efficacy is a wide variety of diseases and conditions that are described herein. [00173] In some embodiments, a Btk inhibitor and a Second anticancer agent are used for the manufacture of a medicament for treating any of the foregoing conditions (e.g., autoimmune diseases, inflammatory diseases, allergy disorders, B-cell proliferative disorders, or thromboembolic disorders). [00174] In some embodiments, Ibrutinib and a Second anticancer agent are used for the manufacture of a medicament for treating any of the foregoing conditions (e.g., autoimmune diseases, inflammatory diseases, allergy disorders, B-cell proliferative disorders, or thromboembolic disorders). Additional Combination Therapies [00175] In certain instances, it is appropriate to administer a Btk inhibitor and a Second anticancer agent in combination with an additional therapeutic agent. In certain instances, it is appropriate to administer Ibrutinib and a Second anticancer agent in combination with an additional therapeutic agent. Additional therapeutic agents are selected for their particular usefulness against the condition that is being treated. In general, the additional therapeutic agent does not need to be administered in the same pharmaceutical composition, at the same time or via the same route and the Ibrutinib and/or Second anticancer agent. In one embodiment, the initial administration is made according to established protocols, and then, based upon the observed effects, the dosage, modes of administration and times of administration, further modified. [00176] In some embodiments, the additional therapeutic agent is administered concurrently (e.g., simultaneously, essentially simultaneously or within the same treatment protocol) or sequentially, depending upon the nature of the disease, the condition of the patient, and the actual choice of compounds used. In certain embodiments, the determination of the order of administration, and the number of repetitions of administration of each therapeutic agent during a treatment protocol, is based upon evaluation of the disease being treated and the condition of the patient. [00177] The dose of the additional therapeutic agent varies depending on the additional therapeutic agent, the disease or condition being treated and so forth.

In some embodiments, the Second anticancer agent is administered once per day, twice per day, or three times per day. In some embodiments, the Second anticancer agent is administered once per day. In some embodiments, Ibrutinib and the Second anticancer agent are co-administered (e.g., in a single dosage form), once per day. In some embodiments, Ibrutinib and the Second anticancer agent are maintenance therapy. [00204] In some embodiments, the compositions disclosed herein are administered for prophylactic, therapeutic, or maintenance treatment. In some embodiments, the compositions disclosed herein are administered for therapeutic applications. In some embodiments, the compositions disclosed herein are administered for therapeutic applications. In some embodiments, the compositions disclosed herein are administered as a maintenance therapy, for example for a patient in remission. [00205] In the case wherein the patient’s status does improve, upon the doctor’s discretion the administration of the compounds may be given continuously; alternatively, the dose of drug being administered may be temporarily reduced or temporarily suspended for a certain length of time (i.e., a “drug holiday”). The length of the drug holiday can vary between 2 days and 1 year, including by way of example only, 2 days, 3 days, 4 days, 5 days, 6 days, 7 days, 10 days, 12 days, 15 days, 20 days, 28 days, 35 days, 50 days, 70 days, 100 days, 120 days, 150 days, 180 days, 200 days, 250 days, 280 days, 300 days, 320 days, 350 days, or 365 days. The dose reduction during a drug holiday may be from 10%-100%, including, by way of example only, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, or 100%. [00206] Once improvement of the patient's conditions has occurred, a maintenance dose is administered if necessary. Subsequently, the dosage or the frequency of administration, or both, can be reduced, as a function of the symptoms, to a level at which the improved disease, disorder or condition is retained. Patients can, however, require intermittent treatment on a long-term basis upon any recurrence of symptoms. [00207] The amount of a given agent that will correspond to such an amount will vary depending upon factors such as the particular compound, the severity of the disease, the identity (e.g., weight) of the subject or host in need of treatment, but can nevertheless be routinely determined in a manner known in the art according to the particular circumstances surrounding the case, including, e.g., the specific agent being administered, the route of administration, and the subject or host being treated. In general, however, doses employed for adult human treatment will typically be in the range of 0.02-5000 mg per day, or from about 1-1500 mg per day. The desired dose may conveniently be presented in a single dose or as divided doses administered simultaneously (or over a short period of time) or at appropriate intervals, for example as two, three, four or more sub-doses per day. [00208] The pharmaceutical composition described herein may be in unit dosage forms suitable for single administration of precise dosages. In unit dosage form, the formulation is divided into unit doses containing appropriate quantities of one or more compound. The unit dosage may be in the form of a package containing discrete quantities of the formulation. Non-limiting examples are packaged tablets or capsules, and powders in vials or ampoules. Aqueous suspension compositions can be packaged in single-dose non-reclosable containers. Alternatively, multiple-dose reclosable containers can be used, in which case it is typical to include a preservative in the composition. By way of example only, formulations for parenteral injection may be presented in unit dosage form, which include, but are not limited to ampoules, or in multi-dose containers, with an added preservative. [00209] The foregoing ranges are merely suggestive, as the number of variables in regard to an individual treatment regime is large, and considerable excursions from these recommended values are not uncommon. Such dosages may be altered depending on a number of variables, not limited to the activity of the compound used, the disease or condition to be treated, the mode of administration, the requirements of the individual subject, the severity of the disease or condition being treated, and the judgment of the practitioner. [00210] Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of such therapeutic regimens can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, including, but not limited to, the determination of the LD50 (the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED50 (the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between the toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio between LD50 and ED50. Compounds exhibiting high therapeutic indices are preferred. The data obtained from cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage for use in human. The dosage of such compounds lies preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include the ED50 with minimal toxicity. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. [00211] In some embodiments, the Btk inhibitor and the Second anticancer agent are administered concurrently. In some embodiments, the Btk inhibitor and the Second anticancer agent are administered simultaneously, essentially simultaneously or within the same treatment protocol. In some embodiments, the Btk inhibitor and the Second anticancer agent are administered sequentially. [00212] In some embodiments, Ibrutinib and the Second anticancer agent are administered concurrently. In some embodiments, Ibrutinib and the Second anticancer agent are administered simultaneously, essentially simultaneously or within the same treatment protocol. In some embodiments, Ibrutinib and the Second anticancer agent are administered sequentially.

Example 2: High throughput screen of ΒΤΚ inhibitor with 99 anti-cancer agents [00231] A high throughput screen of 17 Diffuse Farge Β Cell Fymphoma (DFBCF) cell lines was conducted for their response to Ibrutinib in combination with 99 anti-cancer agents selected from among standard-of-care and emerging therapeutics and targeted agents. The goal of the project was to identify and quantify specific synergies with Ibrutinib to identify pathways that contribute to clinical response. Examples of therapeutics tested included first-line DFBCF therapeutics: RCHOP (Rituximab, Cyclophosphamide, Doxorubicin, Vincristine, Prednisone) or EPOCH (+ Etoposide) and Second-line therapeutics: Dexamethasone, Prednisone, Etoposide, Vincristine, Gemcitabine, Carboplatin, Ifosfamide, Bendamustine, Cyclophosphamide, Rituximab, Fenalidomide, and Anthracycline. [00232] The 17 DFBCF cell lines tested were DB, DOHH-2, HBF-1, ΗΤ, NU-DHF-1, OCI-Fyl, OCI-FylO, OCI-Fyl8, OCI-Fyl9, OCI-Fy3, OCI-Fy7, Pfeiffer, SU-DHF-5, SU-DHF-6, SU-DHF-8, TMD8 and Toledo. Eight of the cell lines were screened in human MSC-conditioned medium (hMSC-CM) and nine of the cell lines were screened with hMSC-CM + lug/ml each of anti-IgM and anti-IgG. The assay was performed in a 384-well format (6x6 HFDR format) with intra-plate replicates (Ibrutinib η=4; enhancers η=2; combination η=1), inter-plate replicates (η=3) and 20 self-crosses. The dose-response matrix screening was designed to detect both types of multi-target interaction, potency shifts or efficacy boosts. [00233] The cells were seeded 24h before dosing. Cells were dosed with ibrutinib (INJ-02) and the test compounds at varying concentrations as depicted in Figures 18-39. At TO (Oh after dosing) and Τ72 (72h after dosing) ATP-lite raw values were obtained. Growth inhibition of the cell culture was measured as follows: [00234] Measure untreated at time 0 (VO) (the time at which drugs are added), treated (Τ) and untreated (V) (at assay end point (72h). [00235] If Τ > V0 - 100% * 1 - [(Τ - VO) / (V - VO)] [00236] If Τ < VO- 100% * 1 - [(Τ - VO) / VO] [00237] 0% (no growth inhibition) - treatment viability signal and 72h vehicle viability signal are matched. (Τ = V) [00238] 100% (Total growth inhibition) - treatment viability signal and Oh vehicle viability signal are matched. (Τ = V0) [00239] 200% (complete kill) - treatment viability signal is 0. (Τ = 0) [00240] The growth inhibition measure is sensitive to the cell doubling time (e.g., it measures the fraction of (net) growth inhibition during the assay period). Growth inhibition gives additional valuable information. For example, 0% - 100% (growth inhibition) represents % reduction in net increase in the cells with vehicle during drug incubation period, 100% represents no net increase in viability signal at Τ72 and TO) (i.e., cytostatic) and 100% - 200% (killing zone) represents cytotoxic effects.
