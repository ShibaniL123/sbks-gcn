Step 2-7, preparation of 3-[4-(4-amino-piperidin-1-yl)-3-(3-chloro-5-methyl-phenyl)-cinnolin-6-yl]-2-hydroxy-benzonitrile: To a solution of {1-[3-(3-chloro-5-methyl-phenyl)-6-(3-cyano-2-methoxymethoxy-phenyl)-cinnolin-4-yl]-piperidin-4-yl}-carbamic acid tert-butyl ester (34.8 mg, 0.0567 mmol) in dioxane (0.5 mL) was added 4 N HCl in dioxane (1.0 mL). The mixture was stirred at RT for 1 hr. The solid was collected by vacuum filtration and washed with dioxane and hexanes to afford the title compound as 2 HCl salt (25.7 mg, 84.4% yield) as an orange solid. MS (M+H)+=470.5.
