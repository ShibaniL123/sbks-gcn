CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. §119 of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61/499,144 filed Jun. 20, 2011; the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Bacterial resistance to antibiotics has long been recognized, and it is today considered to be a serious worldwide health problem. As a result of resistance, some bacterial infections are either difficult to treat with antibiotics or even untreatable. This problem has become especially serious with the recent development of multiple drug resistance in certain strains of bacteria, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae (SP), Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and Enterococcus. The appearance of Vancomycin resistant enterococcus was particularly alarming because Vancomycin was formerly the only effective antibiotic for treating this infection, and had been considered for many infections to be the drug of “last resort”. While many other drug-resistant bacteria do not cause life-threatening disease, such as enterococci, there is the fear that the genes which induce resistance might spread to more deadly organisms such as Staphylococcus aureus, where methicillin resistance is already prevalent (De Clerq, et al., Current Opinion in Anti-infective Investigational Drugs, 1999, 1, 1; Levy, “The Challenge of Antibiotic Resistance”, Scientific American, March, 1998). Another concern is how quickly antibiotic resistance can spread. For example, until the 1960's SP was universally sensitive to penicillin, and in 1987 only 0.02% of the SP strains in the U.S. were resistant. However, by 1995 it was reported that SP resistance to penicillin was about seven percent and as high as 30% in some parts of the U.S. (Lewis, FDA Consumer magazine (September, 1995); Gershman in The Medical Reporter, 1997). Hospitals, in particular, serve as centers for the formation and transmission of drug-resistant organisms. Infections occurring in hospitals, known as nosocomial infections, are becoming an increasingly serious problem. Of the two million Americans infected in hospitals each year, more than half of these infections resist at least one antibiotic. The Center for Disease Control reported that in 1992, over 13,000 hospital patients died of bacterial infections that were resistant to antibiotic treatment (Lewis, “The Rise of Antibiotic-Resistant Infections”, FDA Consumer magazine, September 1995). As a result of the need to combat drug-resistant bacteria and the increasing failure of the available drugs, there has been a resurgent interest in discovering new antibiotics. One attractive strategy for developing new antibiotics is to inhibit DNA gyrase and/or topoisomerase IV, bacterial enzymes necessary for DNA replication, and therefore, necessary for bacterial cell growth and division. Gyrase and/or topoisomerase IV activity are also associated with events in DNA transcription, repair and recombination. Gyrase is one of the topoisomerases, a group of enzymes which catalyze the interconversion of topological isomers of DNA (see generally, Kornberg and Baker, DNA Replication, 2d Ed., Chapter 12, 1992, W. H. Freeman and Co.; Drlica, Molecular Microbiology, 1992, 6, 425; Drlica and Zhao, Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews, 1997, 61, pp. 377-392). Gyrase itself controls DNA supercoiling and relieves topological stress that occurs when the DNA strands of a parental duplex are untwisted during the replication process. Gyrase also catalyzes the conversion of relaxed, closed circular duplex DNA to a negatively superhelical form which is more favorable for recombination. The mechanism of the supercoiling reaction involves the wrapping of gyrase around a region of the DNA, double strand breaking in that region, passing a second region of the DNA through the break, and rejoining the broken strands. Such a cleavage mechanism is characteristic of a type II topoisomerase. The supercoiling reaction is driven by the binding of ATP to gyrase. The ATP is then hydrolyzed during the reaction. This ATP binding and subsequent hydrolysis cause conformational changes in the DNA-bound gyrase that are necessary for its activity. It has also been found that the level of DNA supercoiling (or relaxation) is dependent on the ATP/ADP ratio. In the absence of ATP, gyrase is only capable of relaxing supercoiled DNA. Bacterial DNA gyrase is a 400 kilodalton protein tetramer consisting of two A (GyrA) and two B subunits (GyrB). Binding and cleavage of the DNA is associated with GyrA, whereas ATP is bound and hydrolyzed by the GyrB protein. GyrB consists of an amino-terminal domain which has the ATPase activity, and a carboxy-terminal domain which interacts with GyrA and DNA. By contrast, eukaryotic type II topoisomerases are homodimers that can relax negative and positive supercoils, but cannot introduce negative supercoils. Ideally, an antibiotic based on the inhibition of bacterial DNA gyrase and/or topoisomerase IV would be selective for these enzymes and be relatively inactive against the eukaryotic type II topoisomerases. Topoisomerase IV primarily resolves linked chromosome dimers at the conclusion of DNA replication. The widely-used quinolone antibiotics inhibit bacterial DNA gyrase (GyrA) and/or Topoisomerase IV (ParC). Examples of the quinolones include the early compounds such as nalidixic acid and oxolinic acid, as well as the later, more potent fluoroquinolones such as norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and trovafloxacin. These compounds bind to GyrA and/or ParC and stabilize the cleaved complex, thus inhibiting overall gyrase function, leading to cell death. The fluoroquinolones inhibit the catalytic subunits of gyrase (GyrA) and/or Topoisomerase IV (Par C) (see Drlica and Zhao, Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews, 1997, 61, 377-392). However, drug resistance has also been recognized as a problem for this class of compounds (WHO Report, “Use of Quinolones in Food Animals and Potential Impact on Human Health”, 1998). With the quinolones, as with other classes of antibiotics, bacteria exposed to earlier compounds often quickly develop cross-resistance to more potent compounds in the same class. The associated subunits responsible for supplying the energy necessary for catalytic turnover/resetting of the enzymes via ATP hydrolysis are GyrB (gyrase) and ParE (topoisomerase IV), respectively (see, Champoux, J. J., Annu. Rev. Biochem., 2001, 70, pp. 369-413). Compounds that target these same ATP binding sites in the GyrB and ParE subunits would be useful for treating various bacterial infections (see, Charifson et al., J. Med. Chem., 2008, 51, pp. 5243-5263). There are fewer known inhibitors that bind to GyrB. Examples include the coumarins, novobiocin and coumermycin A1, cyclothialidine, cinodine, and clerocidin. The coumarins have been shown to bind to GyrB very tightly. For example, novobiocin makes a network of hydrogen bonds with the protein and several hydrophobic contacts. While novobiocin and ATP do appear to bind within the ATP binding site, there is minimal overlap in the bound orientation of the two compounds. The overlapping portions are the sugar unit of novobiocin and the ATP adenine (Maxwell, Trends in Microbiology, 1997, 5, 102). For coumarin-resistant bacteria, the most prevalent point mutation is at a surface arginine residue that binds to the carbonyl of the coumarin ring (Arg136 in E. coli GyrB). While enzymes with this mutation show lower supercoiling and ATPase activity, they are also less sensitive to inhibition by coumarin drugs (Maxwell, Mol. Microbiol., 1993, 9, 681). Despite being potent inhibitors of gyrase supercoiling, the coumarins have not been widely used as antibiotics. They are generally not suitable due to their low permeability in bacteria, eukaryotic toxicity, and poor water solubility (Maxwell, Trends in Microbiology, 1997, 5, 102). It would be desirable to have a new, effective GyrB and ParE inhibitor that overcomes these drawbacks and, preferably does not rely on binding to Arg136 for activity. Such an inhibitor would be an attractive antibiotic candidate, without a history of resistance problems that plague other classes of antibiotics. As bacterial resistance to antibiotics has become an important public health problem, there is a continuing need to develop newer and more potent antibiotics. More particularly, there is a need for antibiotics that represent a new class of compounds not previously used to treat bacterial infection. Compounds that target the ATP binding sites in both the GyrB (gyrase) and ParE (topoisomerase IV) subunits would be useful for treating various bacterial infections. Such compounds would be particularly useful in treating nosocomial infections in hospitals where the formation and transmission of resistant bacteria are becoming increasingly prevalent. Furthermore, there is a need for new antibiotics having a broad spectrum of activity with advantageous toxicological properties.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING FIG. 1 is a thermal ellipsoid plot of two symmetry independent molecules of compound 23. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The instant compounds are prodrugs of their parent compound, (R)-1-ethyl-3-(6-fluoro-5-(2-(2-hydroxypropan-2-yl)pyrimidin-5-yl)-7-(tetrahydrofuran-2-yl)-1H-benzo[d]imidazol-2-yl)urea. Thus, the activity exhibited upon administration of the prodrug is principally due to the presence of the parent compound that results from cleavage of the prodrug. The term “prodrug” refers to compounds which are drug precursors which, following administration and absorption, release the drug in vivo via some metabolic process. In general, a prodrug possesses less biological activity than its parent drug. A prodrug may also improve the physical properties of the parent drug and/or it may also improve overall drug efficacy, for example through the reduction of toxicity and unwanted effects of a drug by controlling its absorption, blood levels, metabolic distribution and cellular uptake. The term “parent compound” or “parent drug” refers to the biologically active entity that is released via enzymatic action of a metabolic or a catabolic process, or via a chemical process following administration of the prodrug. The parent compound may also be the starting material for the preparation of its corresponding prodrug. The monovalent cations defined by M+ include ammonium, alkali metal ions such as sodium, lithium and potassium ions, dicyclohexylamine ion, and N-methyl-D-glucamine ion. Also included are amino acid cations such as ions of arginine, lysine, ornithine, and so forth. Also, the basic nitrogen-containing groups may be quaternized with such agents as: lower alkyl halides, such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, and butyl chloride, bromides and iodides; dialkyl sulfates like dimethyl, diethyl, dibutyl; diamyl sulfates; long chain halides such as decyl, lauryl, myristyl and stearyl chlorides, bromides and iodides; aralkyl halides like benzyl bromide and others. The phrase “optionally substituted” is used interchangeably with the phrase “substituted or unsubstituted.” Unless otherwise indicated, an optionally substituted group may have a substituent at each substitutable position of the group, and each substitution is independent of the other. The term “alkyl”, used alone or as part of a larger moiety refers to a hydrocarbon group which may be linear or branched and having the number of carbon atoms designated (i.e. “(C1-C20)” means one to twenty carbons, “(C1-C4)” or “C1-C4” means one to four carbons, etc.). The term “alkenyl” used alone or as part of a larger moiety refers to an unsaturated hydrocarbon group which may be linear or branched and having the number of carbon atoms designated (i.e. “(C1-C20)” means one to twenty carbons, “(C1-C4)” or “C1-C4” means one to four carbons, etc.). The term “halo” or “halogen”, by itself or as part of a substituent refers to fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine atom. The term “carbocycle”, as used herein, means a cyclic hydrocarbon group that is completely saturated or that contains one or more units of unsaturation, that has a single point of attachment to the rest of the molecule. The term “5-6 membered carbocyclic” refers to a C5 or C6 cyclic alkyl group that is completely saturated or contains one or more units of unsaturation, but which is not aromatic. Suitable ““5-6 membered carbocyclic” groups include cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, cyclopentenyl, cyclohexenyl, cyclopentylmethyl, and the like. The term “heterocycle”, “heterocyclic”, “heterocyclyl”, or “heterocyclic aliphatic ring system” refers to a saturated or unsaturated non-aromatic ring containing at least one heteroatom (typically 1 to 4 heteroatoms) selected from nitrogen, oxygen or sulfur. Preferably, these groups contain 0-4 nitrogen atoms, 0-2 sulfur atoms and 0-2 oxygen atoms. More preferably, these groups contain 0-3 nitrogen atoms, 0-1 sulfur atoms and 0-1 oxygen atoms. Examples of heterocycle groups include pyrrolidine, piperidine, imidazolidine, pyrazolidine, butyrolactam, valerolactam, imidazolidinone, hydantoin, dioxolane, piperidine, 1,4-dioxane, morpholine, thiomorpholine, thiomorpholine-S-oxide, thiomorpholine-S,S-dioxide, piperazine, pyran, pyridone, 3-pyrroline, thiopyran, pyrone, tetrahydrofuran, tetrahydrothiophene, and the like. Isotopically-labeled forms of compounds of formula (I) wherein one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature are also included herein. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and fluorine, such as 2H, 3H, 13C, 14C, 15N, 18O, and 17O.

The prodrugs of the present invention are characterized by unexpectedly high aqueous solubility. This solubility facilitates administration of higher doses of the prodrug, resulting in a greater drug load per unit dosage. One embodiment of this invention relates to a method of controlling, treating or reducing the advancement, severity or effects of a bacterial infection in a patient, comprising administering to said patient a therapeutically effective amount of a compound having the formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. According to another embodiment, the invention provides a method of decreasing or inhibiting bacterial quantity in a biological sample. This method comprises contacting said biological sample with a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.

The term “biological sample” also includes living organisms, in which case “contacting a compound of this invention with a biological sample” is synonymous with the term “administrating said compound for composition comprising said compound) to a mammal”. One embodiment comprises contacting said biological sample with a phosphate ester prodrug of (R)-1-ethyl-3-(6-fluoro-5-(2-(2-hydroxypropan-2-yl)pyrimidin-5-yl)-7-(tetrahydrofuran-2-yl)-1H-benzo[d]imidazol-2-yl)urea, as defined by formula (I). Pharmaceutical compositions useful for such methods are described below. The gyrase and/or topoisomerase IV inhibitors of this invention, or pharmaceutical salts thereof, may be formulated into pharmaceutical compositions for administration to animals or humans. These pharmaceutical compositions effective to treat or prevent a bacterial infection which comprise the gyrase and/or topoisomerase IV inhibitor in an amount sufficient to measurably decrease bacterial quantity and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, adjuvant, or vehicle are another embodiment of the present invention. The term “measurably decrease bacterial quantity”, as used herein means a measurable change in the number of bacteria between a sample containing said inhibitor and a sample containing only bacteria. Agents which increase the susceptibility of bacterial organisms to antibiotics are known. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,523,288, U.S. Pat. No. 5,783,561 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,140,306 describe methods of using bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein (BPI) for increasing antibiotic susceptibility of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Agents that increase the permeability of the outer membrane of bacterial organisms have been described by Vaara, M. in Microbiological Reviews (1992) pp. 395-411, and the sensitization of gram-negative bacteria has been described by Tsubery, H., et al, in J.

The term “pharmaceutically effective amount” refers to an amount effective in treating or ameliorating a bacterial infection in a patient. The term “prophylactically effective amount” refers to an amount effective in preventing or substantially lessening a bacterial infection in a patient. Depending upon the particular condition, or disease state, to be treated or prevented, additional therapeutic agents, which are normally administered to treat or prevent that condition, may be administered together with the inhibitors of this invention. Such therapeutic agents include, but are not limited to, an antibiotic, an anti-inflammatory agent, a matrix metalloprotease inhibitor, a lipoxygenase inhibitor, a cytokine antagonist, an immunosuppressant, an anti-cancer agent, an anti-viral agent, a cytokine, a growth factor, an immunomodulator, a prostaglandin or an anti-vascular hyperproliferation compound. The compounds of this invention may be employed in a conventional manner for controlling bacterial infections levels in vivo and for treating diseases or reducing the advancement or severity of effects which are mediated by bacteria. Such methods of treatment, their dosage levels and requirements may be selected by those of ordinary skill in the art from available methods and techniques. For example, a compound of this invention may be combined with a pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvant for administration to a patient suffering from a bacterial infection or disease in a pharmaceutically acceptable manner and in an amount effective to lessen the severity of that infection or disease. Alternatively, the compounds of this invention may be used in compositions and methods for treating or protecting individuals against bacterial infections or diseases over extended periods of time. The compounds may be employed in such compositions either alone or together with other compounds of this invention in a manner consistent with the conventional utilization of enzyme inhibitors in pharmaceutical compositions. For example, a compound of this invention may be combined with pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvants conventionally employed in vaccines and administered in prophylactically effective amounts to protect individuals over an extended period of time against bacterial infections or diseases. In some embodiments, compounds of formula (I) may be used prophylactically to prevent a bacterial infection. In some embodiments, compounds of formula (I) may be used before, during or after a dental or surgical procedure to prevent opportunistic infections such as those encountered in bacterial endocarditis. In other embodiments, compounds of formula (I) may be used prophylactically in dental procedures, including but not limited to extractions, periodontal procedures, dental implant placements and endodontic surgery. In other embodiments, compounds of formula (I) may be used prophylactically in surgical procedures including but not limited to general surgery, respiratory surgery (tonsillectomy/adenoidectomy), gastrointestinal surgery (upper GI and elective small bowel surgery, esophageal sclerotherapy and dilation, large bowel resections, acute appendectomy), trauma surgery (penetrating abdominal surgery), genito-urinary tract surgery (prostatectomy, urethral dilation, cystoscopy, vaginal or abdominal hysterectomy, cesarean section), transplant surgery (kidney, liver, pancreas or kidney transplantation), head and neck surgery (skin excisions, neck dissections, laryngectomy, head and neck cancer surgeries, mandibular fractures), orthopaedic surgery (total joint replacement, traumatic open fractures), vascular surgery (peripheral vascular procedures), cardiothoracic surgery, coronary bypass surgery, pulmonary resection and neurosurgery. The term “prevent a bacterial infection” as used herein, unless otherwise indicated, means the prophylatic use of an antibiotic, such as a gyrase and/or topoisomerase IV inhibitor of the present invention, to prevent a bacterial infection. Treatment with a gyrase and/or topoisomerase IV inhibitor could be done prophylactically to prevent an infection caused by an organism that is susceptible to the gyrase and/or topoisomerase IV inhibitor. One general set of conditions where prophylactic treatment could be considered is when an individual is more vulnerable to infection due to, for example, weakened immunity, surgery, trauma, presence of an artificial device in the body (temporary or permanent), an anatomical defect, exposure to high levels of bacteria or possible exposure to a disease-causing pathogen. Examples of factors that could lead to weakened immunity include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, diabetes, advanced age, HIV infection, and transplantation. An example of an anatomical defect would be a defect in the heart valve that increases the risk of bacterial endocarditis. Examples of artificial devices include artificial joints, surgical pins, catheters, etc. Another set of situations where prophylactic use of a gyrase and/or topoisomerase IV inhibitor might be appropriate would be to prevent the spread of a pathogen between individuals (direct or indirect). A specific example of prophylactic use to prevent the spread of a pathogen is the use of a gyrase and/or topoisomerase IV inhibitor by individuals in a healthcare institution (for example a hospital or nursing home). The compounds of formula (I) may also be co-administered with other antibiotics to increase the effect of therapy or prophylaxis against various bacterial infections. When the compounds of this invention are administered in combination therapies with other agents, they may be administered sequentially or concurrently to the patient. Alternatively, pharmaceutical or prophylactic compositions according to this invention comprise a combination of a compound of formula (I) and another therapeutic or prophylactic agent.

The additional therapeutic agents described above may be administered separately, as part of a multiple dosage regimen, from the inhibitor-containing composition. Alternatively, these agents may be part of a single dosage form, mixed together with the inhibitor in a single composition. The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may be administered orally, parenterally, by inhalation spray, topically, rectally, nasally, buccally, vaginally or via an implanted reservoir. The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may contain any conventional non-toxic pharmaceutically-acceptable carriers, adjuvants or vehicles. In some cases, the pH of the formulation may be adjusted with pharmaceutically acceptable acids, bases or buffers to enhance the stability of the formulated compound or its delivery form. The term parenteral as used herein includes subcutaneous, intracutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, intra-articular, intrasynovial, intrasternal, intrathecal, intralesional and intracranial injection or infusion techniques. The pharmaceutical, compositions may be in the form of a sterile injectable preparation, for example, as a sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspension. This suspension may be formulated according to techniques known in the art using suitable dispersing or wetting agents (such as, for example, Tween 80) and suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally-acceptable diluent or solvent, for example, as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are mannitol, water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose, any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. Fatty acids, such as oleic acid and its glyceride derivatives are useful in the preparation of injectables, as are natural pharmaceutically-acceptable oils, such as olive oil or castor oil, especially in their polyoxyethylated versions. These oil solutions or suspensions may also contain a long-chain alcohol diluent or dispersant, such as those described in Pharmacopeia Helvetica, or a similar alcohol. The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may be orally administered in any orally acceptable dosage form including, but not limited to, capsules, tablets, and aqueous suspensions and solutions. In the case of tablets for oral use, carriers which are commonly used include lactose and corn starch. Lubricating agents, such as magnesium stearate, are also typically added. For oral administration in a capsule form, useful diluents include lactose and dried corn starch. When aqueous suspensions and solutions and propylene glycol are administered orally, the active ingredient is combined with emulsifying and suspending agents. If desired, certain sweetening and/or flavoring and/or coloring agents may be added. The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may also be administered in the form of suppositories for rectal administration. These compositions can be prepared by mixing a compound of this invention with a suitable non-irritating excipient which is solid at room temperature but liquid at the rectal temperature and therefore will melt in the rectum to release the active components. Such materials include, but are not limited to, cocoa butter, beeswax and polyethylene glycols. Topical administration of the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention is especially useful when the desired treatment involves areas or organs readily accessible by topical application. For application topically to the skin, the pharmaceutical composition should be formulated with a suitable ointment containing the active components suspended or dissolved in a carrier. Carriers for topical administration of the compounds of this invention include, but are not limited to, mineral oil, liquid petroleum, white petroleum, propylene glycol, polyoxyethylene polyoxypropylene compound, emulsifying wax and water. Alternatively, the pharmaceutical composition can be formulated with a suitable lotion or cream containing the active compound suspended or dissolved in a carrier. Suitable carriers include, but are not limited to, mineral oil, sorbitan monostearate, polysorbate 60, cetyl esters wax, cetearyl alcohol, 2-octyldodecanol, benzyl alcohol and water. The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may also be topically applied to the lower intestinal tract by rectal suppository formulation or in a suitable enema formulation. Topically-administered transdermal patches are also included in this invention. The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may be administered by nasal aerosol or inhalation. Such compositions are prepared according to techniques well-known in the art of pharmaceutical formulation and may be prepared as solutions in saline, employing benzyl alcohol or other suitable preservatives, absorption promoters to enhance bioavailability, fluorocarbons, and/or other solubilizing or dispersing agents known in the art. According to another embodiment, compounds of formula (I) may also be delivered by implantation (e.g., surgically), such as with an implantable or indwelling device. An implantable or indwelling device may be designed to reside either permanently or temporarily in a subject. Examples of implantable and indwelling devices include, but are not limited to, contact lenses, central venous catheters and needleless connectors, endotracheal tubes, intrauterine devices, mechanical heart valves, pacemakers, peritoneal dialysis catheters, prosthetic joints, such as hip and knee replacements, tympanostomy tubes, urinary catheters, voice prostheses, stents, delivery pumps, vascular filters and implantable control release compositions. Biofilms can be detrimental to the health of patients with an implantable or indwelling medical device because they introduce an artificial substratum into the body and can cause persistent infections. Thus, providing compounds of formula (I) in or on the implantable or indwelling device can prevent or reduce the production of a biofilm. In addition, implantable or indwelling devices may be used as a depot or reservoir of compounds of formula (I). Any implantable or indwelling device can be used to deliver compounds of formula (I) provided that a) the device, compounds of formula (I) and any pharmaceutical composition including compounds of formula (I) are biocompatible, and b) that the device can deliver or release an effective amount of compounds of formula (I) to confer a therapeutic effect on the treated patient. Delivery of therapeutic agents via implantable or indwelling devices is known in the art. See for example, “Recent Developments in Coated Stents” by Hofma et al. published in Current Interventional Cardiology Reports 2001, 3:28-36, the entire contents of which, including references cited therein, incorporated herein by reference. Other descriptions of implantable devices can be found in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,569,195 and 6,322,847; and U.S. Patent Application Numbers 2004/0044405, 2004/0018228, 2003/0229390, 2003/0225450, 2003/0216699 and 2003/0204168, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In some embodiments, the implantable device is a stent. In one specific embodiment, a stent can include interlocked meshed cables. Each cable can include metal wires for structural support and polymeric wires for delivering the therapeutic agent. The polymeric wire can be dosed by immersing the polymer in a solution of the therapeutic agent. Alternatively, the therapeutic agent can be embedded in the polymeric wire during the formation of the wire from polymeric precursor solutions. In other embodiments, implantable or indwelling devices can be coated with polymeric coatings that include the therapeutic agent. The polymeric coating can be designed to control the release rate of the therapeutic agent. Controlled release of therapeutic agents can utilize various technologies. Devices are known that have a monolithic layer or coating incorporating a heterogeneous solution and/or dispersion of an active agent in a polymeric substance, where the diffusion of the agent is rate limiting, as the agent diffuses through the polymer to the polymer-fluid interface and is released into the surrounding fluid. In some devices, a soluble substance is also dissolved or dispersed in the polymeric material, such that additional pores or channels are left after the material dissolves. A matrix device is generally diffusion limited as well, but with the channels or other internal geometry of the device also playing a role in releasing the agent to the fluid. The channels can be pre-existing channels or channels left behind by released agent or other soluble substances. Erodible or degradable devices typically have the active agent physically immobilized in the polymer. The active agent can be dissolved and/or dispersed throughout the polymeric material. The polymeric material is often hydrolytically degraded over time through hydrolysis of labile bonds, allowing the polymer to erode into the fluid, releasing the active agent into the fluid. Hydrophilic polymers have a generally faster rate of erosion relative to hydrophobic polymers. Hydrophobic polymers are believed to have almost purely surface diffusion of active agent, having erosion from the surface inwards. Hydrophilic polymers are believed to allow water to penetrate the surface of the polymer, allowing hydrolysis of labile bonds beneath the surface, which can lead to homogeneous or bulk erosion of polymer. The implantable or indwelling device coating can include a blend of polymers each having a different release rate of the therapeutic agent. For instance, the coating can include a polylactic acid/polyethylene oxide (PLA-PEO) copolymer and a polylactic acid/polycaprolactone (PLA-PCL) copolymer. The polylactic acid/polyethylene oxide (PLA-PEO) copolymer can exhibit a higher release rate of therapeutic agent relative to the polylactic acid/polycaprolactone (PLA-PCL) copolymer. The relative amounts and dosage rates of therapeutic agent delivered over time can be controlled by controlling the relative amounts of the faster releasing polymers relative to the slower releasing polymers. For higher initial release rates the proportion of faster releasing polymer can be increased relative to the slower releasing polymer. If most of the dosage is desired to be released over a long time period, most of the polymer can be the slower releasing polymer. The device can be coated by spraying the device with a solution or dispersion of polymer, active agent, and solvent. The solvent can be evaporated, leaving a coating of polymer and active agent. The active agent can be dissolved and/or dispersed in the polymer. In some embodiments, the co-polymers can be extruded over the device. Dosage levels of between about 0.01 and about 100 mg/kg body weight per day, preferably between 0.5 and about 75 mg/kg body weight per day and most preferably between about 1 and 50 mg/kg body weight per day of the active ingredient compound are useful in a monotherapy for the prevention and treatment of bacterial infections. Typically, the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention will be administered from about 1 to 5 times per day or alternatively, as a continuous infusion. Alternatively, the compositions of the present invention may be administered in a pulsatile formulation. Such administration can be used as a chronic or acute therapy. The amount of active ingredient that may be combined with the carrier materials to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated and the particular mode of administration. A typical preparation will contain from about 5% to about 95% active compound (w/w). Preferably, such preparations contain from about 20% to about 80% active compound. When the compositions of this invention comprise a combination of a compound of formula (I) and one or more additional therapeutic or prophylactic agents, both the compound and the additional agent should be present at dosage levels of between about 10% to 80% of the dosage normally administered in a monotherapy regime. Upon improvement of a patient's condition, a maintenance dose of a compound, composition or combination of this invention may be administered, if necessary. Subsequently, the dosage or frequency of administration, or both, may be reduced, as a function of the symptoms, to a level at which the improved condition is retained when the symptoms have been alleviated to the desired level, treatment should cease. Patients may, however, require intermittent treatment on a long-term basis upon any recurrence or disease symptoms. As the skilled artisan will appreciate, lower or higher doses than those recited above may be required. Specific dosage and treatment regimens for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors, including the activity of the specific compound employed, the age, body weight, general health status, sex, diet, time of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, the severity and course of the disease, and the patient's disposition to the disease and the judgment of the treating physician. According to another embodiment, the invention provides methods for treating or preventing a bacterial infection, or disease state, comprising the step of administering to a patient any compound, pharmaceutical composition, or combination described herein. The term “patient”, as used herein, means an animal, preferably a mammal, and most preferably a human. The compounds of this invention are also useful as commercial reagents which effectively bind to the gyrase B and/or topoisomerase IV enzymes. As commercial reagents, the compounds of this invention, and their derivatives, may be used to block gyrase B and/or topoisomerase IV activity in biochemical or cellular assays for bacterial gyrase B and/or topoisomerase IV or their homologs or may be derivatized to bind to a stable resin as a tethered substrate for affinity chromatography applications. These and other uses which characterize commercial gyrase B and/or topoisomerase IV inhibitors will be evident to those of ordinary skill in the art. The compounds of this invention may be prepared by first synthesizing (R)-1-ethyl-3-(6-fluoro-5-(2-(2-hydroxypropan-2-yl)pyrimidin-5-yl)-7-(tetrahydrofuran-2-yl)-1H-benzo[d]imidazol-2-yl)urea (Compound 23 below) in accordance with general methods known to those skilled in the art for analogous compounds, as taught by U.S. Pat. No. RE40245 E; U.S. Pat. No. 7,495,014 B2; U.S. Pat. No. 7,569,591 B2; U.S. Pat. No. 7,582,641 B2; U.S. Pat. No. 7,618,974 B2; and U.S. Pat. No. 7,727,992 B2. All six of said patents are incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein. The details of the conditions used for preparing the compounds of the present invention are further set forth in the Examples. The (R)-1-ethyl-3-(6-fluoro-5-(2-(2-hydroxypropan-2-yl)pyrimidin-5-yl)-7-(tetrahydrofuran-2-yl)-1H-benzo[d]imidazol-2-yl)urea 23 may then be converted to the phosphate or phosphate salt prodrugs according to Scheme 1 below. Reagents and conditions: (a) R1OH, DIPEA, 23° C., DCM; (b) 23, tetrazole, MeCN, DMF, 23° C.; (c) mCPBA, 0-23° C., DMF; (d) aq M+OH−; (e) aq H.

Part V: Enzymology Studies The enzyme inhibition activities of selected compounds of this invention were determined in the experiments described below: Part VA. DNA Gyrase ATPase Assay The ATP hydrolysis activity of S. aureus DNA gyrase was measured by coupling the production of ADP through pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase to the oxidation of NADH. This method has been described previously (Tamura and Gellert, 1990, J. Biol. Chem., 265, 21342). ATPase assays were carried out at 30° C. in buffered solutions containing 100 mM TRIS pH 7.6, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 150 mM KCl. The coupling system contains final concentrations of 2.5 mM phosphoenol pyruvate, 200 μM nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), 1 mM DTT, 30 ug/ml pyruvate kinase, and 10 ug/ml lactate dehydrogenase. The enzyme (90 nM final concentration) and a DMSO solution (3% final concentration) of the selected compound were added. The reaction mixture was allowed to incubate for 10 minutes at 30° C. The reaction was initiated by the addition of ATP to a final concentration of 0.9 mM, and the rate of NADH disappearance was monitored at 340 nanometers over the course of 10 minutes. The Ki values were determined from rate versus concentration profiles. Selected compounds of the present invention were found to inhibit S. aureus DNA gyrase. Table 1 shows the inhibitory activity of these compounds in the S. aureus DNA gyrase inhibition assay. TABLE 1 Inhibition of S. aureus DNA Gyrase Selected Compound Ki (nM) Compound 23 9 Compound X <9 Compound Y 13 Compound Z <9 Part VB. DNA Topo IV ATPase Assay The conversion of ATP to ADP by S. aureus TopoIV enzyme was coupled to the conversion of NADH to NAD+, and the progress of the reaction was measured by the change in absorbance at 340 nm. TopoIV (64 nM) was incubated with the selected compound (3% DMSO final) in buffer for 10 minutes at 30° C. The buffer consisted of 100 mM Tris 7.5, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 200 mM K·Glutamate, 2.5 mM phosphoenol pyruvate, 0.2 mM NADH, 1 mM DTT, 5 μg/mL linearized DNA, 50 μg/mL BSA, 30 μg/mL pyruvate kinase, and 10 μg/mL lactate dehyrodgenase (LDH). The reaction was initiated with ATP, and rates were monitored continuously for 20 minutes at 30° C. on a Molecular Devices SpectraMAX plate reader. The inhibition constant, Ki, was determined from plots of rate vs. concentration of selected compound fit to the Morrison Equation for tight binding inhibitors. Selected compounds of the present invention were found to inhibit S. aureus DNA Topo IV. Table 2 shows the inhibitory activity of these compounds in the S. aureus DNA gyrase inhibition assay. TABLE 2 Inhibition of S. aureus DNA Topo IV Selected Compound Ki (nM) Compound 23 9 Compound X 45 Compound Y 24 Compound Z 80 Part VI: Aqueous Solubility Study The aqueous solubilities of compounds 23, X, Y, and Z were determined according to the following procedure. Preparation of Samples. Aqueous samples of each compound were prepared as follows. Compounds were weighed (20-30 mg compound) in 4 ml clear vials prior to adding water (0.5 mL) and stirring by magnetic stirrer. 1.0N HCl was added to the suspension to adjust the pH to the desired range. After stirring for 96 hours at room temperature, the suspension was filtered through a 0.22 micron filter (Millipore, Ultrafree centrifugal filters, Durapore PVDF 0.22 μm, Cat# UFC30GVNB). The filtrate was collected and the pH measured with a pH meter. The filtrates containing compounds X and Z were diluted 100-fold and 400-fold, respectively, to provide an appropriate concentration for HPLC analysis. The filtrates containing compounds 23 and Y did not require dilution. Preparation of Standard Solutions. Standard solutions of each compound were prepared according to the following procedure. 1 to 2 mg of each compound was accurately weighed into a 10 mL volumetric flask and either water (for compounds X and Z), methanol (for compound Y), or 1:1 methanol:0.1N HCl (for compound 23) was added to completely dissolve the compounds. Sonication was performed for compound 23 to assist with the dissolution in 1:1 methanol:0.1N HCl. When all solids dissolved, additional solvent was added to adjust the volume of each solution to 10 ml. The resulting solutions were thoroughly mixed to give the standard solutions of each compound. Each standard solution was then diluted with solvent by 2-fold, 10-fold, and 100-fold. Solubility Analysis. Aliquots of each sample and each standard solution were analyzed by HPLC analysis (Agilent 1100, injection volume 10 μL, wavelength 271 nm, column XTerra® Phenyl 5 μm, 4.6×50 mm, Part No. 186001144, mobile phase: A: 0.1% TFA in water 0.1% TFA in AcN). Each standard solution was injected three times, and each of the samples was injected twice. Standard curves were obtained by plotting the average of the peak area from the HPLC versus the concentrations of the standard solutions (with appropriate corrections of the weights of the standards based on total water content of the solid as determined by elemental analysis). The concentration of each sample was calculated from the peak area of the aqueous sample from the HPLC results and the slope and intercept of the standard curves. The solubility values listed in Table 3 below were derived from the product of the concentration of the sample and the dilution factor of the sample.
